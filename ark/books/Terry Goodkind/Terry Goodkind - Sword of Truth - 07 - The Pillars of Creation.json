Startled, she sat backon her heels. The raw breeze ruffled her hair as she stared wide-eyed at thewords written in precise, blocky letters on the small square of paper. The paperhad been folded in half twice, carefully, so that the edges had been even. Sheblinked, half expecting the words to vanish, like some grim illusion. Theyremained solid and all too real.Foolish though she knew the thought was, she still felt as if the dead soldiermight be watching her for any reaction. Showing none, outwardly, anyway, shestole a look at his eyes. They were dull and filmy. She had heard people say ofthe deceased that they looked like they were only sleeping. He didn’t. His eyeslooked dead. His pale lips were taut, his face was waxy. There was a purplishblush at the back of his bull neck.Of course he wasn’t watching her. He was no longer watching anything. With hishead turned to the side, toward her, though, it almost seemed as if he might belooking at her. She could imagine he was.Up on the rocky hill behind her, bare branches clattered together in the windlike bones clacking. The paper in her trembling fingers seemed to be rattlingwith them. Her heart, already thumping at a brisk pace, started to pound harder.Jennsen prided herself in her levelheadedness. She knew she was letting herimagination get carried away. But she had never before seen a dead person, aperson so grotesquely still. It was dreadful seeing someone who didn’t breathe.She swallowed in an attempt to compose her own breathing, if not her nerves.Even if he was dead, Jennsen didn’t like him looking at her, so she stood,lifted the hem of her long skirts, and stepped around the body. She carefullyfolded the small piece of paper over twice, the way it had been folded when shehad found it, and slipped it into her pocket. She would have to worry about thatlater. Jennsen knew how her mother would react to those two words on the paper.Determined to be finished with her search, she squatted on the other side of theman. With his face turned away, it almost seemed as if he were looking back upat the trail from where he had fallen, as if he might be wondering what hadhappened and how he had come to be at the bottom of the steep, rocky gorge withhis neck broken.His cloak had no pockets. Two pouches were secured to his belt. One pouch heldoil, whetstones, and a strop. The other was packed with jerky. Neither containeda name.If he’d known better, as she did, he would have taken the long way along thebottom of the cliff, rather than traverse the trail across the top, wherepatches of black ice made it treacherous this time of year. Even if he didn’twant to retreat the way he had come in order to climb down into the gorge, itwould have been wiser for him to have made his way through the woods, despitethe thick bramble that made travel difficult up there among the deadfall.Done was done. If she could find something that would tell her who he was, maybeshe could find his kin, or someone who knew him. They would want to know. Sheclung to the safety of the pretense.Almost against her will, Jennsen returned to wondering what he had been doingout here. She feared that the carefully folded piece of paper told her only tooclearly. Still, there could be some other reason.If she could just find it.She had to move his arm a little if she was to look in his other pocket.“Dear spirits forgive me,” she whispered as she grasped the dead limb.His unbending arm moved only with difficulty. Jennsen’s nose wrinkled withdisgust. He was as cold as the ground he lay on, as cold as the sporadicraindrops that fell from the iron sky. This time of year, it was almost alwayssnow driven before such a stiff west wind. The unusual intermittent mist anddrizzle had surely made the icy places on the trail at the top even slicker. Thedead man only proved it.She knew that if she stayed much longer she would be caught out in theapproaching winter rain. She was well aware that people exposed to such weatherrisked their lives. Fortunately, Jennsen wasn’t terribly far from home. If shedidn’t get home soon, though, her mother, worried at what could be taking solong, would probably come out after her. Jennsen didn’t want her mother gettingsoaked, too.Her mother would be waiting for the fish Jennsen had retrieved from baited linesin the lake. For once, the lines they tended through holes in the ice hadbrought them a full stringer. The fish were lying dead on the other side of thedead man, where she had dropped them after making her grim discovery. He hadn’tbeen there earlier, or she would have seen him on her way out to the lake.Taking a deep breath to gird her resolve, Jennsen made herself return to hersearch. She imagined that some woman was probably wondering about her big,handsome soldier, worrying if he was safe, warm, and dry.He was none of that.Jennsen would want someone to tell her mother, if it were she who had fallen andbroken her neck. Her mother would understand if she delayed a bit to try to findout the man’s identity. Jennsen reconsidered. Her mother might understand, butshe still wouldn’t want Jennsen anywhere near one of these soldiers. But he wasdead. He couldn’t hurt anyone, now, much less her and her mother.Her mother would be even more troubled once Jennsen showed her what was writtenon the little piece of paper.Jennsen knew that what really drove her search was the hope for some otherexplanation. She desperately wanted it to be something else. That frantic needkept her beside his dead body when she wanted nothing so much as to run forhome.If she didn’t find anything to explain away his presence, then it would be bestto cover him and hope that no one ever found him. Even if she had to stay out inthe rain, she should cover him over as quickly as possible. She shouldn’t wait.Then no one would ever know where he was.She made herself push her hand down into his trouser pocket, all the way to theend. The flesh of his thigh was stiff. Her fingers hurriedly gathered up thenest of small objects at the bottom. Gasping for breath at the awful task, shepulled it all out in her fist. She bent close in the gathering gloom and openedher fingers for a look.On top were a flint, bone buttons, a small ball of twine, and a foldedhandkerchief. With one finger, she pushed the twine and handkerchief to theside, exposing a weighty clutch of coins-silver and gold. She let out a softwhistle at the sight of such wealth. She didn’t think that soldiers were rich,but this man had five gold marks among a larger number of silver marks. Afortune by most any standard. All the silver pennies-not copper, silver-seemedinsignificant by contrast, even though they alone were probably more than shehad spent in the whole of her twenty years.The thought occurred to her that it was the first time in her life that she hadever held gold-or even silver-marks. The thought occurred to her that it mightbe plunder.She found no trinket from a woman, as she had hoped, so as to soften her worryabout what sort of man he had been.Regrettably, nothing in the pocket told her anything of who he might be. Hernose wrinkled as she went about the chore of returning his possessions to hispocket. Some of the silver pennies spilled from her fist. She picked them all upfrom the wet, frozen ground and forced her hand into his pocket again in orderto return them all to their rightful place.His pack might tell her more, but he was sprawled atop it, and she wasn’t sureshe wanted to try to have a look, since it was likely to hold only supplies. Hispockets would have held anything he considered valuable.Like the piece of paper.She supposed all the evidence that she really needed was in plain sight. He worestiff leather armor under his dark cloak and tunic. At his hip was a simple butruggedly made and wickedly sharp soldier’s sword in a torn utilitarian blackleather scabbard. The sword was broken at midlength, no doubt in the long tumblefrom the trail.Her eyes glided more carefully over the remarkable knife sheathed at his belt.The hilt of the knife, gleaming in the gloom, was what had riveted her attentionfrom the first instant. The sight of it had held her frozen until she realizedits owner was dead. She was sure that no simple soldier would possess a knifethat exquisitely crafted. It had to be more expensive than any knife she hadever seen.On the silver hilt was the ornate letter “R.” Even so, it was a thing of beauty.From a young age, her mother had taught her to use a knife. She wished hermother could have a knife as fine as this.Jennsen.Jennsen jumped at the whispered word.Not now. Dear spirits, not now. Not here.Jennsen.Jennsen was not a woman who hated much in life, but she hated the voice thatsometimes came to her.She ignored it, now, as always, forcing her fingers to move, to try to discoverif there was anything else about the man that she should know. She checked theleather straps for concealed pockets but found none. The tunic was a plain cut,without pockets.Jennsen, came the voice again.She gritted her teeth. “Leave me be,” she said aloud, if under her breath.Jennsen.It sounded different, this time. Almost as if the voice wasn’t in her head, asit always was.“Leave me alone,” she growled.Surrender, came the dead murmur.She glanced up and saw the man’s dead eyes staring at her.The first curtain of cold rain, billowing in the wind, felt like the icy fingersof spirits caressing her face.Her heart galloped yet faster. Her breath caught against her ragged pulls, likesilk catching on dry skin. With her wide-eyed gaze locked on the dead soldier’sface, she pushed with her feet, scuttling back across the gravel.She was being silly. She knew she was. The man was dead. He wasn’t looking ather. He couldn’t be. His stare was fixed in death, that’s all, like her stringerof dead fish-they weren’t looking at anything. Neither was he. She was beingsilly. It only seemed he was looking at her.But even if the dead eyes were staring at nothing, she would just as soon thatthey weren’t doing it in her direction.Jennsen.Beyond, above the sharp rise of granite, the pine trees swayed from side to sidein the wind and the bare maple and oak waved their skeletal arms, but Jennsenkept her gaze fixed on the dead man as she listened for the voice. The man’slips were still. She knew they would be. The voice was in her head.His face was still turned toward the trail from where he had fallen to hisdeath. She had thought his lifeless sight had been turned in that direction,too, but now his eyes seemed to be turned more toward her.Jennsen curled her fingers around the hilt of her knife.Jennsen.“Leave me be. I’ll not surrender.”She never knew what it was that the voice wanted her to surrender. Despitehaving been with her nearly her whole life, it had never said. She found refugein that ambiguity.As if in answer to her thought, the voice came again.Surrender your flesh, Jennsen.Jennsen couldn’t breathe.Surrender your will.She swallowed in terror. It had never said that before-never said anything shecould understand.Often, she would faintly hear it-as if it were too far away to be clearlyunderstood. Sometimes she thought she could hear the words, but they seemed tobe in a strange language.She often heard it when she was falling asleep, calling to her in that distant,dead whisper. It spoke other words to her, she knew, but never so as she couldunderstand more than her name and that frighteningly seductive single-wordcommand to surrender. That word was always more forceful than any other. Shecould always hear it even when she could hear no other.Her mother said that the voice was the man who, nearly Jennsen’s whole life, hadwanted to kill her. Her mother said that he wanted to torment her.“Jenn,” her mother would often say, “it’s all right. I’m here with you. Hisvoice can’t hurt you.” Not wanting to burden her mother, Jennsen often didn’ttell her about the voice.But even if the voice couldn’t hurt her, the man could, if he found her. At thatmoment, Jennsen desperately wished for the protective comfort of her mother’sarms.One day, he would come for her. They both knew he would. Until then, he sent hisvoice. That’s what her mother thought, anyway.As much as that explanation frightened her, Jennsen preferred it to thinkingherself mad. If she didn’t have her own mind, she had nothing.“What’s happened here?”Jennsen gasped in a cry of fright as she spun, pulling her knife. She droppedinto a half crouch, feet spread, knife held in a death grip.It was no disembodied voice, this. A man was walking up the gully toward her.With the wind in her ears, and the distraction of the dead man and the voice,she hadn’t heard him coming.As big as he was, as close as he was, she knew that if she ran, and if he was ofa mind, he could easily run her down."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2The man slowed when he saw her reaction, and her knife.“I didn’t mean to give you a scare.”His voice was pleasant enough.“Well, you did.”Although the hood of his cloak was up and she couldn’t see his face clearly, heseemed to be taking in her red hair the way most people did when they saw her.“I can see that. I apologize.”She didn’t slacken her defensive posture in acceptance of the apology, butinstead swept her gaze to the sides, checking to see if he was alone, to see ifanyone else was with him and might be sneaking up on her.She felt a fool for being caught by surprise like that. In the back of her mindshe knew she couldn’t ever really be safe. It didn’t necessarily take stealth.Even simple carelessness on her part could at any time bring the end. She felt asense of forlorn doom at how easily it could happen. If this man could walk upin broad daylight and startle her so easily, what did that say of her hopelesslyextravagant dream that one day her life could be her own?The dark rock wall of the cliff glistened in the wet. The windswept gully wasdeserted of anyone but her and the two men, the dead one and the one alive.Jennsen was not given to imagining sinister faces lurking in forest shadows, asshe had been as a child. The dark places in among the trees were empty.The man stopped a dozen paces away. By his posture, it wasn’t fear of her knifethat halted him, but fear of causing her a worse fright. He stared openly ather, seemingly lost in some private thought. He quickly recovered from whateverit was about her face that so held his gaze.“I can understand why a woman would have cause to be frightened when a strangersuddenly walks up on her. I would have passed on by without alarming you, but Isaw that fellow on the ground and you there, bent over him. I thought you mightneed help, so I rushed over.”The cold wind pressed his dark green cloak against his sinewy build and liftedthe other side away to reveal his well-cut but simple clothes. His cloak’s hoodcovered his head against the first trailers of rain, leaving his face somewhatindistinct in its shadow. His smile was one of courteous intent, no more. Hewore the smile well.“He’s dead” was all she could think to say.Jennsen was unaccustomed to speaking to strangers. She was unaccustomed tospeaking to anyone but her mother. She was unsure as to what to say-how toreact-especially under the circumstances.“Oh. I’m sorry.” He stretched his neck a little, without coming any closer,trying to see the man on the ground.Jennsen thought it a considerate thing to do-not trying to come closer tosomeone who was clearly nervous. She hated that she was so obvious. She hadalways hoped she might appear to others somewhat inscrutable.His gaze lifted from the dead man, to her knife, to her face. “I suppose you hadcause.”Perplexed for a second, she finally grasped his meaning and blurted out, “Ididn’t do it!”He shrugged. “Sorry. From over here I can’t tell what happened.”Jennsen felt awkward holding a knife on the man. She lowered the arm with theweapon.“I didn’t mean to ... to appear a madwoman. You just startled the wits out ofme.”His smile warmed. “I understand. No harm done. So, what happened?”Jennsen gestured with her empty hand toward the cliff face. “I think he fellfrom the trail up there. His neck’s broken. At least I think it is. I only justdiscovered him. I don’t see any other footprints. My guess is that he was killedin a fall.”As Jennsen returned her knife to its sheath on her belt, he considered thecliff. “Glad I took the bottom, rather than the trail up there.”She inclined her head in invitation toward the dead man. “I was looking forsomething that might tell me who he was. I thought maybe I should ... notifysomeone. But I haven’t found anything.”The man’s boots crunched through the coarse gravel as he approached. He knelt onthe other side of the body, rather than beside her, perhaps to give theknife-wielding madwoman a precautionary bit of space so she would feet a littleless jumpy.“I’d guess you were right,” he said, after taking in the abnormal cant of thehead. “Looks like he’s been here at least part of the day.”“I was through here earlier. Those are my tracks, there. I don’t see any othersabout.” She gestured toward her catch lying just behind her. “When I went to thelake to check my lines, earlier, he wasn’t here.”He twisted his head in order to better study the still face. “Any idea who hewas?”“No. I don’t have a clue, other than that he’s a soldier.”The man looked up. “Any idea what kind of soldier?”Jennsen’s brow drew tight. “What kind? He’s a D’Haran soldier.” She loweredherself to the ground in order to look at the stranger more directly. “Where areyou from that you wouldn’t recognize a D’Haran soldier?”He ran his hand under his cloak’s hood and rubbed it along the side of his neck.“I’m just a traveler, passing through.” He looked as tired as he sounded.The answer perplexed her. “I’ve moved around my whole life and I don’t know ofanyone who wouldn’t know a D’Haran soldier when they saw one. How can you not?”“I’m new to D’Hara.”“That’s not possible. D’Hara covers most of the world.”This time, his smile betrayed amusement. “Is that so?”She could feel her face heat and she knew it must be going red with how ignorantof the world at large she had shown herself to be. “Well, doesn’t it?”He shook his head. “No. I’m from far to the south. Beyond the land that isD’Hara.”She stared in wonder, her chagrin evaporating in light of the implications thatcame into her head at such an astonishing notion. Perhaps her dream might not beso extravagant.“And what are you doing, here, in D’Hara?”“I told you. Traveling.” He sounded weary. She knew how exhausting it could beto travel. His tone turned more serious. “I know he’s a D’Haran soldier. Youmisunderstood me. What I meant was, what kind of soldier? A man belonging to alocal regiment? A man stationed here? A soldier on his way home for a visit? Asoldier going for a drink in town? A scout?”Her sense of alarm rose. “A scout? What would he be scouting for in his ownhomeland?”The man looked off at the low dark clouds. “I don’t know. I was only wonderingif you knew anything of him.”“No, of course not. I just found him.”“Are these D’Haran soldiers dangerous? I mean, do they bother folks? Folks justtraveling through?”Her gaze fled his questioning eyes. “I-I don’t know. I guess they could be.”She feared to say too much, but she wouldn’t want him to end up in troublebecause she said too little.“What do you suppose a lone soldier was doing way out here? Soldiers aren’toften alone.”“I don’t know. Why do you suppose a simple woman would know more aboutsoldiering than a man of the world who travels about? Don’t you have any ideasof your own? Maybe he was just on his way home, for a visit, or something. Maybehe was thinking about a girl back home, and so he wasn’t paying attention likehe should have been. Maybe that’s why he slipped and fell.”He rubbed his neck again, as if he were in pain.“I’m sorry. I guess I’m not making much sense. I’m a little tired. Maybe I’m notthinking clearly. Maybe I was only concerned for you.”“For me? What do you mean?”“I mean that soldiers belong to units of one sort or another. Other soldiersknow them and know where they’re supposed to be. Soldiers don’t just go offalone when they want to. They aren’t like some lone trapper who could vanish andno one would know.”“Or some lone traveler?”An easy grin softened his expression. “Or some lone traveler.” The grinwithered. “The point is, other soldiers will likely look for him. If they comeupon his body, here, they’ll bring in troops to prevent anyone from leaving thearea. Once they gather anyone they can find, they’ll start asking questions.“From what I’ve heard about D’Haran soldiers, they know how to ask questions.They’ll want to know every detail about every person they question. “Jennsen’s middle cramped in sick, churning consternation. The last thing in theworld she wanted was D’Haran soldiers asking questions of her or her mother.This dead soldier could end up being the death of them.“But what are the chances-”“I’m only saying that I’d not like to have this fellow’s friends come along anddecide that someone has to pay for his death. They might not see it as anaccident. Soldiers get stirred up by the death of a comrade, even if it was anaccident. You and I are the only two around. I’d not like to have a bunch ofsoldiers discover him and decide to blame us.”“You mean, even if it was an accident, they might seize an innocent person andblame them for it?”“I don’t know, but in my experience that’s the way soldiers are. When they’reangry they find someone to blame.”“But they can’t blame us. You weren’t even here, and I was only going to tend myfishing lines.”He planted an elbow on his knee and leaned over the dead man toward her. “Andthis soldier, going about his business for the great D’Haran Empire, saw abeautiful young woman strutting along and was so distracted by her that heslipped and fell.”“I wasn’t ‘strutting’!”“I don’t mean to suggest you were. I only meant to show you how people can findblame when they decide they want to.”She’d not thought of that. They were D’Haran soldiers. Such behavior wouldhardly be out of the question.The rest of what he’d said registered in her mind. Jennsen had never before hada man call her beautiful. It flustered her, coming so unexpectedly and out ofplace, as it did, in the middle of such a worry. Since she didn’t have any ideahow to react to the compliment, and since there were so many more importantthoughts commanding her emotions, she ignored it.“If they find him,” the man said, “then, at the least, they’re going to collectanyone around and question them long and hard.”All the ugly implications were becoming all too real. The day of doom wassuddenly looming near.“What do you think we should do?”He thought it over a moment. “Well, if they do come by, but don’t find him, thenthey won’t have any reason to stop and question the people here. If they don’tfind him, they’ll go somewhere else to keep looking for him.”He rose and looked around. “Ground’s too hard to dig a grave.” He pulled hishood farther forward to shield his eyes from the mist as he searched. He pointedto a spot near the base of the cliff. “There. There’s a deep cleft that looksbig enough. We could put him in there and cover him over with gravel and rocks.Best burial we can manage this time of year. “And probably more than he deserved. She would just as soon leave him, but thatwouldn’t be wise. Covering him up was what she had planned on doing before thestranger happened along. This would be a better way to do it. There would beless chance that animals would uncover him for passing soldiers to discover.Seeing her trying to hastily weigh the various ramifications, and mistaking itfor reluctance, he spoke in soft assurance. “The man is dead. Nothing can bedone about it. It was an accident. Why let that accident bring trouble? Wedidn’t do anything wrong. We weren’t even here when it happened. I say we buryhim and go on with our lives-without D’Haran soldiers becoming unjustlyinvolved.”Jennsen stood. The man might be right about soldiers coming upon a dead friendand deciding to question people. There was abundant reason to be worried aboutthe dead D’Haran soldier without this new concern. She thought again about thepiece of paper she’d found in his pocket. That would be reason enough-withoutany other.If the piece of paper was what she thought it might be, then questioning wouldonly be the beginning of the ordeal.“Agreed,” she said. “If we’re to do it, let’s be quick.”He smiled, more relief than anything, she thought. Then, turning to face hermore squarely, he pushed his hood back off his head, the way men did out ofrespect for a woman.Jennsen was shocked to see, even though he was at most only six or seven yearsolder than she, that his cropped hair was as white as snow. She gazed at it withmuch the same sense of wonder as people gazed at her red hair. With the shadowsof the hood gone, she saw that his eyes were as blue as hers, as blue as peoplesaid her father’s had been.The combination of his short white hair and those blue eyes was arresting. Theway they both went with his clean-shaven face was singularly appealing. It allfit together with his features in a way that seemed completely right.He held his hand out across the dead soldier.“My name is Sebastian.”She hesitated a moment, but then offered her hand in return. Even though his wasbig and no doubt powerful, he didn’t squeeze her hand to prove it, the way somemen did. The unnatural warmth of the hand surprised her.“Are you going to tell me your name?”“I’m Jennsen Daggett.”“Jennsen.” He smiled his pleasure at the sound of it.She felt her face going red again. Instead of noticing, he immediately set tothe task by grabbing the soldier under his arms and giving him a tug. The bodymoved only a short distance with each mighty pull. The soldier had been a hugeman. Now he was a huge dead weight.Jennsen seized the soldier’s cloak at the shoulder to help. Sebastian moved hishold to the cloak at the other shoulder and together they dragged the weight ofthe man, who loomed as dangerous to her in death as he would have in life,across the gravel and slick patches of smooth rock.Still panting from the effort, and before pushing the soldier into the crevicethat was to be his final resting place, Sebastian rolled him over. Jennsen sawfor the first time that he wore a short sword strapped over his shoulder, underhis pack. She hadn’t seen it before because he was lying on it. Hooked on theweapons belt around his waist, at the small of his back, hung a crescent-bladedbattle-axe. Jennsen’s level of apprehension rose at seeing how heavily armed thesoldier had been. Regular soldiers didn’t carry this many weapons. Or a knifelike he had.Sebastian tugged the straps of the pack down off the arms. He unstrapped theshort sword and set it aside. He pulled off the weapons belt and tossed it atopthe sword.“Nothing too unusual in the pack,” he said after a brief inspection. He addedthe pack to the short sword, the weapons belt, and the axe.Sebastian started searching the dead man’s pockets. Jennsen was about toquestion what he was doing when she recalled that she had done the same. She wassomewhat more disturbed when he returned the other items after picking out themoney. She thought it rather cold-blooded, stealing from the dead.Sebastian held the money out to her.“What are you doing?” she asked.“Take it.” He offered the money again, more insistently this time. “What good isit going to do in the ground? Money is of use to relieve the suffering of theliving, not the dead. You think the good spirits will ask him for the price of abright and pleasant eternity?”He was a D’Haran soldier. Jennsen expected the Keeper of the underworld wouldhave something somewhat more dark in store for this man’s eternity.“But ... it’s not mine.”He frowned a reproving look. “Consider it partial compensation for all you’vesuffered.”She felt her flesh go cold. How could he know? They were always so careful.“What do you mean?”“The years taken off your life by the fright this fellow gave you today.”Jennsen finally was able to let her breath go in a silent sigh. She had to stopfearing the worst in what people said.She allowed Sebastian to put the coins in her hand. “All right, but I think youshould have half for helping me.” She handed three gold marks back.He grasped her hand with his other and pressed all three coins into her palm.“Take it. It’s yours, now.”Jennsen thought of what this much money could mean. She nodded. “My mother hashad a hard life. She could use it. I will give it to my mother. ““I hope it helps you both, then. Let it be this man’s last good act, helping youand your mother.”“Your hands are warm.” By the look in his eyes, she thought she knew why. Shesaid no more.He nodded and confirmed her suspicion. “I’ve got a touch of fever. I came downwith it this morning. When we get finished with this business I’m hoping to getto the next town and rest up in a dry room for a while. I just need some rest toregain my strength.”“Town is too far for you to make today.”“You sure? I can make good time. I’m used to traveling.”“So am I,” Jennsen said, “and it takes me most of a day to make it. There’s onlya couple of hours of light left-and we have yet to finish with this task. Noteven a fast horse would get you near town today.”Sebastian let out a sigh. “Well, I guess I’ll make do.”He knelt again and rolled the soldier partway over in order to unstrap theknife. The sheath, fine-grain black leather, was trimmed with silver to matchthe handle and decorated with the same ornate emblem. On one knee, Sebastianheld the gleaming, sheathed knife up to her.“Silly to bury such a fine weapon. Here you go. Better than that piece of junkyou showed me before.”Jennsen stood stunned and confused. “But, you should keep it.”“I’ll take the others. More to my taste anyway. The knife is yours. Sebastian’srule.”“Sebastian’s rule?”“Beauty belongs with beauty.”Jennsen blushed at the intended compliment. But this was not a thing of beauty.He had no idea of the ugliness this represented.“Any idea what the ‘R’ in the hilt stands for?”Oh yes, she wanted to say. She knew only too well what it represented. That wasthe ugliness.“It stands for the House of Rahl.”“House of Rahl?”“Lord Rahl-the ruler of D’Hara,” she said in simple explanation of a nightmare."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3By the time they were finished with the laborious task of covering thetroublesome body of the dead D’Haran soldier, Jennsen’s arms were weak withfatigue. The damp wind scything through her clothes felt like it cut to thebone. Her ears and nose and fingers were numb.Sebastian’s face was covered in a sheen of sweat.But the dead man was at last buried under gravel and then rocks that were inabundance at the base of the cliff. Animals were not likely to be able to digthrough all the heavy stone to get at the body. The worms would feastundisturbed.Sebastian had said a few simple words, asking the Creator to welcome the man’ssoul into eternity. He made no plea for mercy in His judgment, and neither didJennsen.As she finished scattering gravel with a heavy branch and her feet, obscuringthe marks left by their work, she gave the area a critical examination and wasrelieved to see that no one would ever suspect that a person lay buried there.If soldiers came through they wouldn’t realize that one of their own had met hisend here. They would have no reason to question local people, except, perhaps,to ask if anyone had seen him. That would be a simple enough lie to feed themand one easily swallowed.Jennsen pressed her hand against Sebastian’s forehead. It confirmed her fears.“You’re burning with fever.”“We’re done, now. I can rest more easily, not having to worry that soldiers willbe rousting me out of my bedroll to ask me questions at the point of a sword.”She wondered where he was going to sleep. The drizzle was thickening. Sheexpected it would soon be raining. Given the persistence of the darkeningclouds, once it started it would likely rain the whole night. Cold rain soakinghim to the skin would only further inflame his fever. Such a winter rain couldeasily kill someone who lacked proper shelter.She watched as Sebastian strapped the weapons belt around his waist. He didn’tplace the axe at the small of his back the way the soldier had worn it, butrather positioned it at his right hip. After testing its edge and finding itsatisfactory, he fastened the short sword to the left side of the belt. Bothweapons were placed so as to come readily to hand.When he’d finished he flipped his heavy green cloak closed over it all. Heseemed again a simple traveler. She suspected he was more. He had his secrets.He wore them casually, almost in the open. She wore hers uneasily, and heldclose.He handled the sword with the kind of smooth ease that came only with longacquaintance. She knew because she handled a knife with effortless grace, andsuch proficiency had come only with experience and continual practice. Somemothers taught their daughters to sew and cook. Jennsen’s mother didn’t thinksewing would save her daughter. Not that a knife would, either, but it wasbetter protection than needle and thread.Sebastian lifted the dead man’s pack and threw back the flap. “We’ll divide thesupplies. Do you want the pack?”“You should keep the supplies and the pack,” Jennsen said as she retrieved herstringer of fish.He agreed with a nod. He appraised the sky as he cinched the pack closed. “I’dbest be on my way, then.”“Where?”His weary eyelids blinked at the question. “No place special. Traveling. I guessI’ll walk for a while and then I suppose I’d better try to find some shelter. ““Rain is coming,” she said. “It doesn’t take a prophet to tell that.”He smiled. “Guess not.” His eyes bore the prospect of what lay ahead withresigned acceptance. He swiped his hand back over his wet spikes of white hair,then pulled up his hood. “Well, take care of yourself, Jennsen Daggett. Give mybest to your mother. She raised a lovely daughter.”Jennsen smiled and acknowledged his words with a single nod. She stood facingthe damp wind as she watched him turn and start off across. the flat expanse ofgravel. Craggy rock walls rose up all around, their snow-crusted shouldersdisappearing into the low gray overcast that concealed the bulk of the mountainsand the nearly endless range of high peaks.It seemed so funny, so freakish, so futile that in all this vast country theirpaths should cross so briefly, at that instant in time, for such a tragic momentas one life ended, and then that they would both go off again into that infiniteoblivion of life.Jennsen’s heart pounded in her ears as she listened to his footsteps crunchingacross the jagged gravel, watched his long strides carrying him away. With asense of urgency, she debated what she should do. Was she always to turn awayfrom people? To hide?Was she always to forfeit even small snatches of what it was to live lifebecause of a crime she did not commit? Dare she risk this?She knew what her mother would say. But her mother loved her dearly, and sowould not say it out of cruelty.“Sebastian?” He looked back over his shoulder, waiting for her to speak. “If youdon’t have shelter, you may not live to see tomorrow. I wouldn’t like it if Iknew you were out here with a fever getting soaked to the skin.”He stood watching her, the drizzle drifting between them.“I wouldn’t like that, either. I’ll mind your words and do my best to find someshelter.”Before he could turn away again, she lifted her hand, gesturing off in the otherdirection. She saw that her fingers were trembling. “You could come home withme.”“Would your mother mind?”Her mother would be in a panic. Her mother would never allow a stranger, despitewhat help he had been, to sleep in the house. Her mother wouldn’t sleep a winkall night with a stranger anywhere near. But if Sebastian stayed out with afever he could die. Jennsen’s mother would not wish that on this man. Her motherhad a kind heart. That loving concern, not malice, was the reason she was soprotective of Jennsen.“The house is small, but there’s room in the cave where we keep the animals. Ifyou wouldn’t mind, you could sleep there. It’s not as bad as it sounds. I’veslept there myself, on occasion, when the house felt too confining. I’d make youa fire near the entrance. You’d be warm and could get the rest you need.”He looked reluctant. Jennsen held up her stringer of fish.“We could feed you,” she said, sweetening the offer. “You would at least have agood meal along with a warm rest. I think you need both. You helped me. Let mehelp you?”His smile, one of gratitude, returned. “You’re a kind woman, Jennsen. If yourmother will allow it, I will accept your offer.”She lifted her cloak open, displaying the fine knife in its sheath, which shehad tucked behind her belt. “We’ll offer her the knife. She will value it. “His smile, warm and suddenly lighthearted with amusement, was as pleasant asmile as Jennsen had ever seen.“I don’t think two knife-wielding women need lose any sleep over a stranger witha fever.”That was Jennsen’s thought, but she didn’t admit it. She hoped her mother wouldsee it that way, too.“It’s settled then. Come along before the rain catches us out.”Sebastian trotted to catch up with her as she started out. She lifted the packfrom his hand and shouldered it. With his own pack, and his new weapons, he hadenough to carry in his weakened condition."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4“Wait here,” Jennsen said in a low voice. “I’ll go tell her that we have aguest.”Sebastian dropped heavily onto a low projection of rock that made a convenientseat. “You just tell her what I said, that I’ll understand if she doesn’t want astranger spending the night at your place. I know it wouldn’t be an unreasonablefear.”Jennsen considered him with a calm and somber demeanor.“My mother and I have reason not to fear a visitor.”She was not alluding to common weapons, and by her tone he knew it. For thefirst time since she had met him, she saw a spark of uncertainty in Sebastian’ssteady blue eyes-a shadow of uneasiness not elicited by her expertise with aknife.A hint of a smile came in turn to Jennsen’s lips as she watched him consideringwhat manner of dark danger she might represent. “Don’t worry. Only thosebringing trouble would have cause to fear being here.”He lifted his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Then I’m as safe as a babe inhis mother’s arms.”Jennsen left Sebastian to wait on the rock while she made her way up the windingpath, through sheltering spruce, using twisted roots as steps up, toward herhouse set back in a clutch of oak on a small shelf in the side of a mountain.The flat patch of grassy ground was, on a better day, a sunny open spot amongthe towering old trees. There was room enough to yard their goat along with someducks and chickens. Steep rock to the back prevented any visitors happening uponthem from that direction. Only the path up the front provided an approach.Should they be threatened, Jennsen and her mother had constructed a well-hiddenset of footholds up the back, to a narrow ledge, and out a twisting side way viadeer paths that would take them through a ravine and away. The escape route wasnearly inaccessible as a way in unless you knew the precise course through themaze of rock walls, fissures, and narrow ledges, and even then they had madecertain that key passages were well hidden by strategically placing deadwood andbrush they’d planted.Ever since Jennsen was young they had moved often, never staying in one placetoo long. Here, though, where they felt safe, they had stayed for over twoyears. Travelers had never discovered their mountain hideaway, as sometimes hadhappened in other places they had stayed, and the people in Briarton, thenearest town, never ventured this far into such a dark and forbidding wood.The seldom-used trail around the lake, from where the soldier had fallen, was asclose as any trail came to them. Jennsen and her mother had gone into Briartononly once. It was unlikely that anyone even knew they were living out in thevast trackless mountains far from any farmland or city. Except for the chanceencounter with Sebastian down closer to the lake, they’d never seen anyone neartheir place. This was the most secure spot she and her mother had ever had, andso Jennsen had dared to begin to think of it as home.Since she was six, Jennsen had been hunted. As careful as her mother always was,several times they had come frighteningly close to being snared. He was noordinary man, the one who hunted her; he was not bound by ordinary means ofsearching. For all Jennsen knew, the owl watching her from a high limb as shemade her way up the rocky path could be his eyes watching her.Just as Jennsen reached the house, she met her mother, throwing her cloak aroundher shoulders as she came out the door. She was the same height as Jennsen, withthe same thick hair to just past her shoulders but more auburn than red. She wasnot yet thirty-five, and the prettiest woman Jennsen had ever seen, with afigure the Creator Himself would marvel at. In different circumstances, hermother’s life would have been one of countless suitors, some, no doubt, willingto offer a king’s ransom for her hand. Her mother’s heart, though, was as lovingand beautiful as her face, and she had given up everything to protect herdaughter.When Jennsen sometimes felt sorry for herself, for the normal things in lifethat she couldn’t have, she would then think of her mother, who had willinglygiven up all those same things and more for the sake of her daughter. Her motherwas as close as it came to a guardian spirit in the flesh.“Jennsen!” Her mother rushed to her and seized her shoulders. “Oh, Jenn, I wasstarting to worry so. Where have you been? I was just coming to look for you. Ithought you must have had some trouble and I was-”“I did, Mother,” Jennsen confided.Her mother paused only momentarily; then, without further question, she embracedJennsen in protective arms. After such a frightening day, Jennsen openlywelcomed the balm of her mother’s hug. Finally, with a comforting arm encirclingJennsen’s shoulders, her mother urged her toward the door.“Come inside and get yourself dry. I see you have quite the catch. We’ll have agood dinner and you can tell me. . . “Jennsen was dragging her feet. “Mother, I have someone with me.”Her mother halted, suddenly searching her daughter’s face for any outward signof the nature and depth of the trouble. “What do you mean? Who would you havewith you?”Jennsen flicked a hand back toward the path. “He’s waiting down there. I toldhim to wait. I told him I’d ask you if he could sleep in the cave with theanimals-”“What? Stay here? Jenn, what were you thinking? We can’t-”“Mother, please, listen to me. Something terrible happened today. Sebastian-”“Sebastian?”Jennsen nodded. “The man I brought with me. Sebastian helped me. I came across asoldier who fell from the path-the high trail around the lake. “Her mother’s face went ashen. She said nothing.Jennsen took a calming breath and started again. “I found a D’Haran soldier deadin the gorge below the high trail. There were no other tracks. I looked. He wasan extraordinarily big soldier, and he was heavily armed. Battle-axe, sword athis hip, sword strapped over his shoulder.”Her mother canted her head with an admonishing expression. “What aren’t youtelling me, Jenn?”Jennsen wanted to hold it back until she explained Sebastian, first, but hermother could read it in her eyes, hear it in her voice. The terrible threat ofthat piece of paper with the two words on it seemed almost to be screaming itspresence from her pocket.“Mother, please, let me tell it my way?”Her mother cupped a hand to the side of Jennsen’s face. “Tell me, then. Yourway, if you must.”“I was searching the soldier, looking for anything important. And I foundsomething. But then, this man, a traveler, came upon me. I’m sorry, Mother, Iwas frightened by the soldier being there and by what I found and I wasn’tpaying attention as I should have. I know I behaved foolishly. “Her mother smiled. “No, baby, we all have lapses. None of us can be perfect. Weall sometimes make mistakes. That doesn’t make you foolish. Don’t say that aboutyourself.”“Well I felt foolish when he said something and I turned around and there hewas. I had my knife out, though.” Her mother was nodding with a smile ofapproval, “He saw then that the man had fallen to his death. He-Sebastian,that’s his name-he said that if we just left him there, then, more likely thannot, other soldiers would find him and start questioning us all and maybe blameus for their fellow soldier being dead.”“This man, Sebastian, sounds like he knows what he’s talking about.”“I thought so, too. I had intended to cover the dead soldier, to try to hidehim, but he was big-I could never have dragged him over to a cranny by myself.Sebastian offered to help me bury the body. Together we were able to drag himover and roll him into a deep split in the rock. We covered him over good.Sebastian put some heavy rocks atop the gravel I scooped in. No one will findhim.”Her mother looked more relieved. “That was wise.”“Before we buried him, Sebastian thought we should take anything valuable,rather than let it go to waste in the ground.”One eyebrow arched. “Did he, now?”Jennsen nodded. She pulled the money from her pocket, the pocket that didn’thave the piece of paper in it. She dumped all the money in her mother’s hand.“Sebastian insisted that I take it all. There’s gold marks there. He didn’t wantany for himself.”Her mother took in the fortune in her hand, then glanced briefly to the trailwhere Sebastian waited. She leaned closer.“Jenn, if he came with you, then perhaps he thinks he can have the money back atany time of his choosing. That would give him the opportunity to look generousand win your trust-and still be near enough to end up with the money when hechooses.”“I considered that, too.”Her mother’s tone softened sympathetically. “Jenn, it’s not your fault-I’ve keptyou so sheltered-but you just don’t know how men can be.”Jennsen let her gaze drop from her mother’s knowing eyes. “I suppose it could betrue, but I don’t think so.”“And why not?”Jennsen looked back up, more intently, this time. “He has a fever, Mother. He’snot well. He was leaving, without asking to come with me at all. He bid me agood-bye. As tired and feverish as he is, I feared he’d die out in the raintonight. I stopped him, told him that if it was all right with you he couldsleep in the cave with the animals where he could at least be dry and warm.”After a moment of silence, Jennsen added, “He said that if you don’t want astranger near, he will understand and be on his way.”“Did he? Well, Jenn, this man is either very honest, or very clever.” She fixedJennsen with an intent look. “Which do you think it is, hmm?”Jennsen twined her fingers together. “I don’t know, Mother. I honestly don’t. Iwondered the same things as you-I really did.”She remembered, then. “He said that he wanted you to have this, so you wouldn’thave to fear a stranger sleeping nearby.”Jennsen drew the knife in its sheath from behind her belt and held it out to hermother. The silver handle gleamed in the dim yellow light coming from the smallwindow behind her mother.Staring in astonishment, her mother slowly lifted the weapon in both hands asshe whispered, “Dear spirits . . .”“I know,” Jennsen said. “I nearly yelped in fright when I saw it. Sebastian saidthat this was a fine weapon, too fine to bury, and he wanted me to keep it. Hekept the soldier’s short sword and axe for himself. I told him I would give thisto you. He said that he hoped it would help you feel safe. “Her mother slowly shook her head. “This does not make me feel safe atall-knowing that a man carrying this was near us. Jenn, I don’t like that onebit. Not one bit.”Her mother’s eyes showed that she was on to worries bigger than the man Jennsenhad brought home with her.“Mother, Sebastian is sick. Can he stay in the cave? I led him to believe thathe has more to fear from us than we from him.”Her mother glanced up with a sly smile. “Good girl.” They both knew that inorder to survive they had to work as a team, with well-practiced roles they fellinto without the need for formal discussion.She let out a sigh, then, as if with the burden of knowing all the things herdaughter was missing in life. She ran a hand tenderly down Jennsen’s hair,letting it come to rest on her shoulder.“All right, baby,” she said at last, “we’ll let him stay the night.”“And feed him. I told him he would have a hot meal for helping me.”Her mother’s warm smile widened. “And a meal, then.”She drew the blade from its sheath, finally. She gave it a critical appraisal,turning it this way and that, inspecting its design. She tested the edge, andthen the weight. She spun it between her slender fingers to get the feel of it,the balance.At last she held it in her open palm, contemplating the ornate letter “R.”Jennsen could not imagine what terrible thoughts-and memories must be goingthrough her mother’s mind as she silently considered the emblem representing theHouse of Rahl.“Dear spirits,” her mother whispered again to herself.Jennsen didn’t say anything. She entirely understood. It was an ugly evil thing.“Mother,” Jennsen whispered when her mother had looked at the handle for aneternity, “it’s almost dark. May I go get Sebastian and take him back to thecave?”Her mother slid the blade home into its sheath, looking to put a panorama ofpainful memories away with it.“Yes, I suppose you had better go get him. Take him to the cave. Make a fire forhim. I’ll cook some fish and bring some herbs along to help him sleep with hisfever. Wait there with him until I come out. Keep your eye on him. We will eatwith him, out there. I don’t want him in the house.”Jennsen nodded. She touched her mother’s arm, halting her before she could gointo the house. Jennsen had one more thing to tell her mother. She dearly wishedshe didn’t have to. She didn’t want to bring her mother such a worry, but shehad to.“Mother,” she said in a voice barely above a whisper, “we are going to need togo from this place.”Her mother looked startled.“I found something on the D’Haran soldier.”Jennsen pulled the piece of paper from her pocket, unfolded it, and held it outin her open palm.Her mother’s gaze took in the two words on the paper.“Dear spirits . . .” was all she said, was all she was able to say.She turned and looked at the house, taking it all in, her eyes suddenly brimmingwith tears. Jennsen knew that her mother had come to think of it as home, too.“Dear spirits,” her mother whispered to herself again, at a loss for anythingmore.Jennsen thought the weight of it might overcome her, and her mother might breakdown in helpless tears. That was what Jennsen wanted to do. Neither did.Her mother wiped a finger under each eye as she looked back at Jennsen. And thenshe did cry-one brief inhalation of a gasping sob of hopelessness. “I’m sosorry, baby.”It broke Jennsen’s heart to see her mother in such anguish. Everything thatJennsen had missed in life, her mother had missed twice over. Once for herself,and once for her daughter. On top of it, her mother had to be strong.“We’ll leave at first light,” her mother said in simple pronouncement.“Traveling at night, and in the rain, will serve us ill. We’ll have to find anew place to hide. He’s getting too close to this one.”Jennsen’s own eyes overflowed with tears and her voice came only with greatdifficulty. “I’m so sorry, Mama, that I’m such trouble.” Her tears flooded forthin a painful torrent. She crushed the piece of paper as her hands fisted. “I’mso sorry, Mama. I wish you could be free of me.”Her mother caught her up in her arms then, cradling Jennsen’s head to a shoulderas she wept. “No, no, baby. Don’t ever say that. You’re my light, my life. Thistrouble is caused by others. Don’t you ever wear a cloak of guilt because theyare evil. You’re my wonderful life. I would give everything else up a thousandtimes over for you and then once again and be joyous to do so.”Jennsen was glad that she would never have any children, for she knew she didn’thave her mother’s strength. She held on for dear life to the only person in theworld who was a comfort to her.But then she pushed away from her mother’s embrace. “Mama, Sebastian is from faraway. He told me. He said that he’s from beyond D’Hara.There are other places-other lands. He knows of them. Isn’t that wonderful?There is a place that isn’t D’Hara.”“But those places are beyond barriers and boundaries that can’t be crossed.”“Then how can he be here? It must be so, otherwise he could not have traveledhere.”“And Sebastian is from one of these other lands?”“To the south, he said.”“The south? I don’t see how it could be possible. Are you sure that’s what hesaid?”“Yes.” Jennsen added a firm nod of confirmation. “He said the south. He onlymentioned it casually. I’m not sure how it’s possible, but what if it is?Mother, maybe he could guide us there. Maybe, if we asked, he would guide us outof this nightmare land.”As levelheaded as her mother was, Jennsen could see that she was consideringthis wild idea. It wasn’t crazy-her mother was thinking it over, so it couldn’tbe crazy. Jennsen was suddenly filled with a sense of hope that maybe she hadcome up with something that would save them.“Why would he do this for us?”“I don’t know. I don’t even know if he would consider it, or what he would wantin return. I didn’t ask him. I didn’t dare even to mention it until I talked toyou, first. That’s part of why I wanted him to stay here-so you could questionhim. I feared to lose this chance to discover if it really is possible.”Her mother looked around again at the house. It was tiny, only one room, and itwas nothing fancy, built from logs and wood they had shaped themselves, but itwas warm and snug and dry. It was frightening to contemplate striking out in thedead of winter. The alternative of being caught, though, was far worse.Jennsen knew what would happen if they were caught. Death would not comeswiftly. If they were caught, death would come only after endless torture.At last, her mother gathered herself and spoke. “That’s good thinking, Jenn. Idon’t know if anything can come of such an idea, but we’ll talk to Sebastian andsee. One thing is for sure. We have to leave. We dare not delay until spring-notif they’re this close. We’ll leave at dawn.”“Mother, where will we go, this time, if Sebastian won’t lead us away fromD’Hara?”Her mother smiled. “Baby, the world is a big place. We are only two smallpeople. We will simply vanish again. I know it’s hard, but we’re together. Itwill be fine. We’ll see some new sights, now won’t we? Some more of the world.“Now, go get Sebastian and take him to the cave. I’ll get started on dinner.We’ll all need to have a good meal.”Jennsen quickly kissed her mother’s cheek before racing down the trail. The rainwas starting, and it was so gloomy among the trees that she could hardly see.The trees were all huge D’Haran soldiers to her, broad, powerful, grim. She knewshe would have nightmares after seeing a real D’Haran soldier up close.Sebastian was still sitting on the rock, waiting. He stood as she rushed up tohim.“My mother said it was all right for you to sleep in the cave with the animals.She’s started on cooking up the fish for us. She wants to meet you.”He looked too tired to be happy, but he managed to show her a small smile.Jennsen seized his wrist and urged him to follow her. He was already shiveringwith the wet. His arm was warm, though. Fever was like that, she knew. Youshivered even though you were burning up. But with some food and herbs and agood night’s rest, she was sure he would soon be well.What she wasn’t sure of was if he would help them."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5Betty, their brown goat, watched attentively from her pen, occasionally voicingher displeasure at sharing her home, as Jennsen quickly collected straw to theside for the stranger in Betty’s sanctuary. Bleating her distress, Betty finallyquieted when Jennsen affectionately scratched the nervous goat’s ears, pattedthe wiry hair covering her round middle, and then gave her half a carrot fromthe stash up on a high ledge. Betty’s short upright tail wagged furiously.Sebastian shed his cloak and pack, but kept on the belt with his new weapons. Heunstrapped his bedroll from under his pack and spread it out over the mat ofstraw. Despite Jennsen’s urging, he wouldn’t lie down and rest while she kneltnear the cave’s entrance and prepared the fire pit.As he helped her stack dry kindling, she could see by the dim light coming fromthe window of the house on the other side of the clearing that sweat beaded hisface. He repeatedly scraped his knife down the length of a branch, swiftlybuilding a clump of fluffy fibers. He struck a steel to flint several times,sending sparks through the darkness into the tinder he’d made. He cupped thefluff in his hands and with gentle puffs of breath nursed the slow flames untilthey strengthened, then placed the burning tinder beneath the kindling, wherethe flames quickly grew and popped to life among the dry twigs. The branchesreleased a pleasing fragrance of balsam as they caught flame.Jennsen had been planning on running to the house, not far off, to get some hotcoals to start the fire, but he had it going before she could even suggest it.By the way he trembled, she imagined he was impatient for heat, even though hewas burning with fever. She could smell the aroma of the frying fish coming fromthe house, and when the wind among the pine boughs died from time to time, shecould hear the sizzle.The chickens retreated from the growing light into the deep shadows at the backof the cave. Betty’s ears stood at attention as she watched Jennsen for anysigns that another carrot might be forthcoming. Her tail wagged in hopeful fits.The opening in the mountain was simply a place where, in some distant age past,a slab of rock had tumbled out, like some giant granite tooth come loose, toplunge down the slope and leave a dry socket behind. Now, trees below grew amonga collection of such fallen boulders. The cave only ran back about twenty feet,but the overhang of rock at the entrance further sheltered it and helped keep itdry. Jennsen was tall, but the ceiling of the cave was high enough that shecould stand in most of it, and since Sebastian was only a little taller thanshe, his spikes of snow white hair, now a mellow orange in the firelight, didn’tbrush the top as he went to the back to collect some of the dry wood stackedthere. The chickens squawked at being bothered, but then quickly settled backdown.Jennsen squatted on the opposite side of the fire from Sebastian, with her backto the rain that had started, so she could see his face in the firelight as theyboth warmed their hands in the heat of the crackling flames. After a day in thefrigid damp weather, the fire’s warmth felt luxurious. She knew that sooner orlater winter would return with a vengeance. As cold and uncomfortable as it wasnow, it would get worse.She tried not to think about having to leave their snug home, especially at thistime of year. She had known from the first instant she saw the piece of paper,though, that they might.“Are you hungry?” she asked.“Starving,” he said, looking as eager for the fish as Betty was for a carrot.The wonderful smells were making her stomach grumble, too.“That’s good. My mother always says that if you’re ill, and you have anappetite, then it can’t be too serious.”“I’ll be fine in a day or two.”“A rest will do you good.”Jennsen drew her knife from its sheath at her belt. “We’ve never allowed anyoneto stay here before. You will understand that we will be taking precautions.”She could see in his eyes that he didn’t know what she was talking about, but heshrugged his understanding of her prudence.Jennsen’s knife wasn’t anything like the fine weapon the soldier had beencarrying. They could afford nothing like that knife. Hers had a simple handlemade of antler and the blade wasn’t thick, but she kept its edge razor sharp.Jennsen used the blade to slice a shallow cut across the inside of her forearm.With a frown, Sebastian started to rise, to voice a protest. Her challengingglare stopped him cold before he was halfway up. He sank back down and watchedwith growing concern as she wiped the sides of the blade through the crimsonbeads of blood welling up from the cut. She very deliberately looked him in theeye again before turning her back on him and moving out closer to the edge ofthe cave where the rain dampened the ground.With the knife wetted in blood, Jennsen first drew a large circle. FeelingSebastian’s eyes on her, she next pulled the tip of the bloody blade through thedamp earth in straight lines to make a square, its corners just touching theinside of the circle. With hardly a pause, she drew a smaller circle thattouched the insides of the square.As she worked, she murmured prayers under her breath, asking the good spirits toguide her hand. It seemed the right thing to do. She knew that Sebastian couldhear her soft singsong, but not make out the words. It occurred unexpectedly toher that it must be something like the voices she heard in her own head.Sometimes, when she drew the outer circle, she heard the whisper of that deadvoice call her name.Opening her eyes from the prayer, she drew an eight-pointed star, its rayspiercing all the way through the inner circle, the square, and then the outercircle. Every other ray bisected a corner of the square.The rays were said to represent the gift of the Creator, so as she drew theeight-pointed star, Jennsen always whispered a prayer of thanks for the gift ofher mother.When she finished and looked up, her mother was standing before her, as if shehad risen from the shadows, or materialized from the edge of the drawing itself,to be lit by the leaping flames of the fire behind Jennsen. In the light ofthose flames, her mother was like a vision of some impossibly beautiful spirit.“Do you know what this drawing represents, young man?” Jennsen’s mother asked ina voice hardly more than a whisper.Sebastian stared up at her, the way people often stared when they first saw her,and shook his head.“It’s called a Grace. They have been drawn by those with the gift of magic forthousands of years-some say since the dawn of Creation itself. The outer circlerepresents the beginning of the eternity of the underworld, the Keeper’s worldof the dead. The inner circle is the extent of the world of life. The squarerepresents the veil that separates both worlds life from death. It touches bothat times. The star is the light of the gift from the CreatorHimself-magic-extending through life and crossing over into the world of thedead.”The fire crackled and hissed as Jennsen’s mother, like some spectral figure,towered over the two of them. Sebastian said nothing. Her mother had spoken thetruth, but it was truth used to convey a specific impression that was not true.“My daughter has drawn this Grace as protection for you as you rest this night,and as protection for us. There is another before the door to the house.” Shelet the silence drag before adding, “It would be unwise to cross either withoutour consent.”“I understand, Mrs. Daggett.” In the firelight, his face showed no emotion.His blue eyes turned to Jennsen. A hint of a smile came to his lips, even thoughhis expression remained serious. “You are a surprising woman, Jennsen Daggett. Awoman of many mysteries. I will sleep safely, tonight.”“And well,” Jennsen’s mother said. “Besides the dinner, I brought some herbs tohelp you sleep.”Her mother, holding the bowl full of fried fish in one hand, collected Jennsenwith a hand on her shoulder and guided her around to the back of the fire to sitbeside her, on the opposite side of her from Sebastian. By the sober look on hisface, their demonstration had had the desired effect.Her mother glanced at Jennsen and gave her a smile Sebastian couldn’t see.Jennsen had done well.Holding the bowl out, her mother offered Sebastian some fish, saying, “I wouldlike to thank you, young man, for the help you gave Jennsen, today. ““Sebastian, please.”“So Jennsen has told me.”“I was glad to help. It was helping myself, too, really. I’d not like to haveD’Haran soldiers chasing me.”She pointed. “If you would accept it, this one on top is coated with the herbsthat will help you sleep.”He used his knife to stab the darker piece of fish coated in the herbs. Jennsentook another on her own knife after first wiping the blade clean on her skirts.“Jennsen tells me that you are from outside D’Hara.”He glanced up as he chewed. “That’s right.”“I find that hard to believe. D’Hara is bordered by impassable boundaries. In mylifetime no one has been able to come into, or leave, D’Hara. How is itpossible, then, that you have?”With his teeth, Sebastian pulled the chunk of herb-coated fish off his knife. Heinhaled between his teeth to cool the bite. He gestured around with the blade ashe chewed. “How long have you been out here alone in this great wood? Withoutseeing people? Without news?”“Several years.”“Oh. Well, then, I guess it makes sense that you wouldn’t know, but since you’vebeen out here, the barriers have come down.”Jennsen and her mother both took in this staggering, nearly incomprehensiblenews in silence. In that silence, they both dared to begin to imagine the headypossibilities. For the first time in Jennsen’s life, escape seemed conceivable.The impossible dream of a life of their own suddenly seemed only a journey away.They had been traveling and hiding their whole life. Now it seemed the journeymight at last be near the end.“Sebastian,” Jennsen’s mother said, “why did you help Jennsen today?”“I like to help people. She needed help. I could tell how much that man scaredher, even though he was dead.” He smiled at Jennsen. “She looked nice. I wantedto help her. Besides,” he finally admitted, “I don’t much care for D’Haransoldiers.”When she gestured by lifting the bowl toward him, he stabbed another piece offish. “Mrs. Daggett, I’m liable to fall asleep before long. Why don’t you justtell me what’s on your mind?”“We are hunted by D’Haran soldiers.”“Why?”“That’s a story for another night. Depending on the outcome of this night, youmay yet learn it, but for now all that really matters is that we arehunted-Jennsen more so than me. If the D’Haran soldiers catch us, she will bemurdered.”Her mother made it sound simple. He would not let it be so simple. It would bemuch more grisly than any mere murder. Death would be a reward gained only afterinconceivable agony and endless begging.Sebastian glanced over at Jennsen. “I’d not like that.”“Then we three are of a single mind,” her mother murmured.“That’s why the two of you are good friends with those knives you keep at hand,”he said.“That’s why,” her mother confirmed.“So,” Sebastian said, “you fear the D’Haran soldiers finding you. D’Haransoldiers aren’t exactly a rarity. The one today gave you both a scare. Whatmakes you both fear this one, today, so much?”Jennsen added a stout stick to the fire, glad to have her mother to do thetalking. Betty bleated for a carrot, or at least attention. The chickensgrumbled about the noise and light.“Jennsen,” her mother said, “show Sebastian the piece of paper you found on theD’Haran soldier.”Taken aback, Jennsen waited until her mother’s eyes turned her way. They shareda look that told Jennsen her mother was determined to take this chance, and ifshe was to try, then they had to at least tell him some of it.Jennsen drew the crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and handed it past hermother to Sebastian. “I found this in that D’Haran soldier’s pocket.” Sheswallowed at the ghastly memory of seeing a dead person. “Just before you showedup.”Sebastian pulled the crumpled paper open, smoothing it between a thumb andfinger as he cast them both a suspicious look. He turned the paper toward thefirelight so he could see the two words.“Jennsen Lindie,” he said, reading it from the piece of paper. “I don’t get it.Who’s Jennsen Lindie?”“Me,” Jennsen said. “At least it was for a while.”“For a while? I don’t understand.”“That was my name,” Jennsen said. “The name I used, anyway, a few years back,when we lived far to the north. We move around often-to keep from being caught.We change our name each time so it will be harder to track us.”“Then ... Daggett is not a real name, either?”“No.”“Well, what is your real name, then?”“That, too, is part of the story for another night.” Her mother’s tone said thatshe didn’t mean to discuss it. “What matters is that the soldier today had thatname. That can only mean the worst.”“But you said it’s a name you no longer use. You use a different name, here:Daggett. No one here knows you by that name, Lindie.”Her mother leaned toward Sebastian. Jennsen knew her mother was giving him alook that he would find uncomfortable. Her mother had a way of making peoplenervous when she fixed them with that intent, penetrating gaze of hers.“It may no longer be our name, a name we used only far to the north, but he hadthat name written down, and he was here, mere miles from where we are now. Thatmeans he has somehow connected that name with us-with two women somewhere up inthis remote place. Somehow, he connected it, or, more precisely, the man whohunts us connected it, and sent him after us. Now, they search for us here.”Sebastian broke her gaze and took a thoughtful breath. “I see what you mean.” Hewent back to eating the piece of fish skewered on the point of his knife.“That dead soldier would have others with him,” her mother said. “By buryinghim, you bought us time. They won’t know what happened to him. We have that muchluck. We are still a few steps ahead of them. We must use our advantage to getaway before they tighten the noose. We will have to leave in the morning. ““Are you sure?” He gestured around with his knife. “You have a life here. Yourlives are remote, hidden-I would never have found you had I not seen Jennsenwith that dead soldier. How could they find you? You have a house, a goodplace.”“‘Life’ is the word that matters in all that you said. I know the man who huntsus. He has thousands of years of bloody heritage as guidance in hunting us. Hewill not rest. If we stay, sooner or later he will find us here. We must escapewhile we can.”She pulled from her belt the exquisite knife Jennsen had brought her from thedead D’Haran soldier. Still in its sheath, she spun it in her fingers,presenting it, hilt first, to Sebastian.“This letter ‘R’ on the hilt stands for the House of Rahl. Our hunter. He wouldonly have presented a weapon this fine to a very special soldier. I don’t want aweapon which has been presented by that evil man.”Sebastian glanced down at the knife tendered, but didn’t take it. He gave themboth a look that unexpectedly chilled Jennsen to the bone. It was a look thatburned with ruthless determination.“Where I come from, we believe in using what is closest to an enemy, or whatcomes from him, as a weapon against him.”Jennsen had never heard such a sentiment. Her mother didn’t move. The knifestill lay in her hand. “I don’t-”“Do you choose to use what he has inadvertently given you, and turn it againsthim? Or do you choose instead to be a victim?”“What do you mean?”“Why don’t you kill him?”Jennsen’s jaw dropped. Her mother seemed less astonished. “We can’t,” sheinsisted. “He’s a powerful man. He is protected by countless people, from simplesoldiers to soldiers of great skill at killing-like the one you buried today-topeople with the gift who can call upon magic. We are but two simple women.”Sebastian was not moved by her plea. “He won’t stop until he kills you.” Helifted the piece of paper, watching her eyes take it in. “This proves it. Hewill never stop. Why don’t you kill him before he kills you-kills your daughter?Or will you choose to be corpses he has yet to collect?”Her mother’s voice heated. “And how do you propose we kill the Lord Rahl?”Sebastian stabbed another piece of fish. “For starters, you should keep theknife. It’s a weapon superior to the one you carry. Use what is his to fighthim. Your sentimental objection to taking it only serves him, not you-orJennsen. “Her mother sat still as stone. Jennsen had never heard anyone talk like this.His words had a way of making her see things differently than she ever hadbefore.“I must admit that what you say makes sense,” her mother said. Her voice camesoftly and laced with pain, or perhaps regret. “You have opened my eyes. Alittle, anyway. I don’t agree with you that we should try to kill him, for Iknow him all too well. Such an attempt would be simple suicide at best, oraccomplish his goal, at worst. But I will keep the knife and use it to defendmyself and my daughter. Thank you, Sebastian, for speaking sense when I didn’twant to hear it.”“I’m glad you’re keeping the knife, at least.” Sebastian pulled the bite of fishoff his own knife. “I hope it can help you.” With the back of his hand, he wipedthe sweat from his brow. “If you don’t want to try to kill him in order to saveyourself, then what do you propose to do? Keep running?”“You say the barriers are down. I propose to leave D’Hara. We will try to makeit to another land, where Darken Rahl cannot hunt us.”Sebastian looked up as he stabbed another piece of fish. “Darken Rahl? DarkenRahl is dead.”Jennsen, having run from the man since she was little, having awakened countlesstimes from nightmares of his blue eyes watching her from every shadow or of himleaping out to snatch her when her feet wouldn’t move fast enough, having livedevery day wondering if this was the day he would finally catch her, havingimagined a thousand times and then another thousand what terrible brutaltorturous things he would do to her, having prayed to the good spirits every dayfor deliverance from her merciless hunter and his implacable minions, wasthunderstruck. She realized only then that she had always thought of the man asnext to immortal. As immortal as evil itself.“Darken Rahl . . . dead? . . . It can’t be,” Jennsen said as tears ofdeliverance welled up and ran down her cheeks. She was filled with a wild,heart-pounding sense of expectant hope ... and at the same time an inexplicableshadow of dark dread.Sebastian nodded. “It’s true. About two years ago, from what I heard.”Jennsen gave voice to the hope. “Then, he is no longer the threat we thought.”She paused. “But, if Darken Rahl is dead. . .”“Darken Rahl’s son is Lord Rahl, now,” Sebastian said.“His son?” Jennsen felt her hope being eclipsed by that dark dread.“The Lord Rahl hunts us,” her mother said, her voice, calm and enduring,betraying no evidence of even a moment of exalted hope. “The Lord Rahl is theLord Rahl. It is now, as it has always been. As it will always be. “As immortal as evil itself.“Richard Rahl,” Sebastian put in. “He’s the Lord Rahl, now.”Richard Rahl. So, now Jennsen knew her hunter’s new name.A terrifying thought washed over her. She had never before heard the voice sayanything more than “Surrender,” and her name, and occasionally those strangeforeign words she didn’t understand. Now it demanded she surrender her flesh,her very will. If it was the voice of the one who hunted her, as her mothersaid, then this new Lord Rahl must be even more terrifyingly powerful than hiswicked father. Fleeting salvation had left behind grim despair.“This man, Richard Rahl,” her mother said, searching for understanding amid allthe startling news, “he ascended to rule as the Lord Rahl of D’Hara when hisfather died, then?”Sebastian leaned forward, a cloaked rage unexpectedly surfacing in his blueeyes. “Richard Rahl became the Lord Rahl of D’Hara when he murdered his fatherand seized rule. And if you are next going to suggest that perhaps the son isless of a threat than his father, then let me set you straight.“Richard Rahl is the one who brought down the barriers.”At that, Jennsen threw up her hands in confusion. “But, that would only givethose who wish to be free their opening to escape D’Hara, to escape him.”“No. He brought those ancient protective barriers down so he could extend histyrannical rule to the lands that were beyond the reach of even his father.”Sebastian thumped his chest once with a tight fist. “My land he wants! Lord Rahlis a madman. D’Hara is not enough for him to rule. He lusts to dominate theentire world.”Jennsen’s mother stared off into the flames, looking dispirited. “I alwaysthought-hoped, I guess-that if Darken Rahl were dead, then maybe we might have achance. The piece of paper Jennsen found today with her name on it now tells methat the son is even more dangerous than his father, and that I was onlydeluding myself. Even Darken Rahl never got this close to us.”Jennsen felt numb after having been rocked by a turbulent swing of emotions,only to be left more terrified and hopeless than before. But seeing such despairon her mother’s face wounded her heart.“I will keep the knife.” Her mother’s decision said how much she feared the newLord Rahl, and how frightful was their plight.“Good.”Dim light coming from the house reflected off the swollen pools of waterstanding beyond the cave entrance, but the droning rain churned the light intothousands of sparkles, like the tears of the good spirits themselves. In a dayor two, the collection of ponds would be ice. Traveling would be easier in thatcold than in cold rain.“Sebastian,” Jennsen asked, “do you think, well, do you think we could escapeD’Hara? Maybe go to your homeland ... escape the reach of this monster?”Sebastian shrugged. “Maybe. But, until this madman is killed, will there beanywhere beyond his ravenous reach?”Her mother tucked the exquisite knife behind her belt and then folded herfingers together around one bent knee. “Thank you, Sebastian. You’ve helped us.Being in hiding has, regrettably, kept us in the dark. You’ve at least broughtus a bit of light.”“Sorry it wasn’t better news.”“The truth is the truth. It helps us know what to do.” Her mother smiled at her.“Jennsen always was one who sought to know the truth of things. I’ve never keptit from her. Truth is the only means of survival; it’s as simple as that.”“If you don’t want to try to kill him in order to eliminate the threat, maybeyou can think of some way to make the new Lord Rahl lose interest in you-inJennsen.”Jennsen’s mother shook her head. “There are more things involved than we cantell you tonight-things you are in the dark about. Because of them, he willnever rest, never stop. You don’t understand the lengths to which the LordRahl-any Lord Rahl-will go in order to kill Jennsen.”“If that’s so, then perhaps you’re right. Maybe the two of you should run.”“And would you help us-help her-to get away from D’Hara?”He looked from one of them to the other. “If I can, I guess I could try. But I’mtelling you, there is no place to hide. If you ever want to be free, you’ll haveto kill him.”“I’m no assassin,” Jennsen said, not so much out of protest as out of acceptanceof her own frailty in the face of such brutal strength. “I want to live, but Ijust don’t have the nature to be an assassin. I will defend myself, but I don’tthink I could effectively set out to kill someone. The sad fact is, I justwouldn’t be any good at it. He’s a killer by birth. I’m not. “Sebastian met her gaze with an icy look. His white hair cast red by thefirelight framed cold blue eyes. “You’d be surprised what a person can do, ifthey have the proper motivation.”Her mother lifted a hand to halt such talk. She was a practical woman, not givento wasting valuable time on wild schemes. “Right now, the important thing is forus to get away. Lord Rahl’s minions are too close. That’s the simple truth ofit. From the description, and this knife, the dead man you found today wasprobably part of a quad.”Sebastian looked up with a frown. “A what?”“A team of four assassins. On occasion, several quads will work together-if thetarget has proven particularly elusive or is of inestimable worth. Jennsen isboth.”Sebastian rested an arm over his knee. “For someone on the run and in hiding allthese years, you seem to know a lot about these quads. Are you sure you’reright?”Firelight danced in her mother’s eyes. Her voice turned more distant. “When Iwas young, I used to live at the People’s Palace. I used to see those men, thequads. Darken Rahl used them to hunt people. They are ruthless beyond anythingyou could imagine.”Sebastian looked uneasy. “Well, I guess you would know better than I. In themorning, then, we leave.” He yawned as he stretched. “Your herbs are alreadyworking, and this fever has exhausted me. After a good night’s sleep I’ll helpyou both get away from here, away from D’Hara, and on your way to the Old World,if that’s your wish.”“It is.” Her mother stood. “You two eat the rest of the fish.” As she movedpast, her loving fingers trailed along the back of Jennsen’s head. “I’m going togo collect some of our things, get together what we can carry. ““I’ll be right in,” Jennsen said. “Soon as I bank the fire.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6The rain was getting worse. Runoff ran in a rippled sheet over the ledge at thebrow of the cave. Jennsen scratched Betty behind her ears to try to stop herbleating. The always nervous goat was suddenly inconsolable. Perhaps she sensedthat they were going to be leaving. Maybe she was just unhappy that Jennsen’smother had gone into the house. Betty loved that woman, and would often followher around the yard like a puppy. Betty would be only too happy to sleep in thehouse with them both, if they would let her.Sebastian, having had his fill of fish, rolled himself in his cloak. His eyelidsdrooped as he tried to watch her bank the fire. He lifted his head and frownedover at the pacing goat.“Betty will settle down when I go in the house,” Jennsen told him.Sebastian, already half asleep, mumbled something about Betty that Jennsencouldn’t even begin to hear over the noise of the rain. She knew it wasn’timportant enough to ask him to repeat it. He needed sleep. She yawned. Despiteher anxiety over everything that had happened that day, and her worry about whatthe next would bring, the din of the downpour was making her sleepy, too.As much as she ached to ask him about what was beyond D’Hara, she bid him a goodnight’s sleep, even though she doubted that he heard her over the rain. Shewould have time enough to ask him all her questions.Her mother would be waiting for help with selecting what to take and packing it.They didn’t have much, but they would have to leave some of what they had.At least the clumsy dead D’Haran soldier had provided them with money just whenthey would need it most. It was enough money to buy horses and supplies thatwould help them get out of D’Hara. The new Lord Rahl, the bastard son of abastard son in an unbroken long line of bastard sons, had inadvertently providedthem with the means to escape his grasp.Life was so precious. She just wanted her and her mother to be able to livetheir own lives. Somewhere, over the distant dark horizon, lay their new lives.Jennsen threw her cloak around her shoulders. She pulled the hood up to protectherself from the rain, but as hard as it was coming down she expected she waslikely to get wet on the run to the house. She hoped the morning would dawnclear for their first day of travel so they could put distance between them andtheir pursuers. She was pleased to see that Sebastian looked dead to the world.He needed a good sleep. She was thankful that amid all the torment andinjustice, at least he had come into their lives.Jennsen picked up the bowl with the few remaining pieces of fish, tucked itunder her cloak, held her breath, and, lowering her head against the onslaught,dove into the roaring rain. The cold shock of the downpour made her gasp as shesplashed through the dark puddles on her dash to the house.She made the house, her wet lashes turning the dim light of the oil lamps andfirelight coming through the window to a blinking blur. Without looking up, shethrew the door open as she ran in.“It’s cold as the Keeper’s heart!” she called out to her mother as she raced in.Jennsen’s breath left her lungs in a grunt as she crashed into a solid wall thathad never been there before.Rebounding from the collision, she looked up to see a broad back turning, to seea huge hand snatching for her.The hand caught only her cloak. The heavy wool cloak stripped away from her asshe fell back. The bowl thudded to the floor, spinning like a crazy top. Thedoor bounced back from hitting the wall, banging closed behind her, trappingher, just before her back slammed into it.Gasping, Jennsen reacted.It was wild instinct, not deliberate thought.Jennsen.Terror, not technique.Surrender.Desperation, not design.The man’s blocky face was clearly lit by the fire from the hearth. He plungedtoward her. A monster with stringy wet hair. Straining sinew and muscle twistedin rage. The knife in her fist whipped around, powered by stark terror.Her cry was a growl of panicked effort. Her knife slammed into the side of hishead. The blade snapped at midlength as it hit his cheekbone. His head twistedfrom the impact. Blood splashed across his face.Swinging madly, his meaty hand walloped her face. Her shoulder hit the wall. Ashock of pain lanced her arm. She stumbled on something. Thrown off balance, shetumbled past her footing.Her face smacked the floor beside another of the huge men. He was like the deadsoldier she had buried. Her mind grasped at snatches of what she was seeing,trying to make sense of it. Where did they come from? How were they in herhouse?Her leg was draped over the man’s still legs. She pushed herself up. He wasslumped against the wall. His dead eyes stared at her. The handle with theornate “R,” sideways below his ear, reflected sparkles of firelight. The pointof the knife jutted from the other side of his bull neck. He wore a wet redshirt.Surrender.With cold fright, she saw a man coming for her.Gripping her broken knife, she scrambled to her feet, turning toward the threat.She saw her mother on the floor. A man held her by the hair. There was bloodeverywhere.Nothing seemed real.In a nightmare vision, Jennsen saw her mother’s severed arm on the floor,fingers slack and open. Red stab wounds.Jennsen.Panic ruled her mind. She heard her own short, choppy screams. Wet blood,splashed across the floor, glistened in the firelight. Whirling movement. A manslammed into her, driving her to the wall. She lost her breath. Pain crushed herchest.Surrender.“No!” Her own voice seemed unreal.She slashed with her broken knife, ripping the man’s arm. He bellowed a vileoath.The man holding Jennsen’s mother dropped her and made for Jennsen. She stabbedwildly, frantically, at the men around her. Reaching hands shot toward her fromall around. A huge hand clamped her thrashing knife arm.Surrender.Jennsen gasped a cry. She struggled savagely. She kicked. She bit. Men cursed.The second man seized her throat in iron fingers.No breath. No breath. She tried-couldn’t breathe-tried desperately-but couldn’tdraw a breath.He sneered as he squeezed her throat. Pain shot up through her temples. Hischeek, slashed by her knife, laid open from ear to mouth, ran with gouts ofblood. She could see glistening red teeth through the gaping wound.Jennsen struggled, but couldn’t pull a breath. A fist slammed her stomach. Shekicked him. He seized her ankle before she could kick him again. One was dead.Two had her. Her mother down.Her vision was narrowing to a black tunnel. Her chest burned. It hurt so much.So much.Sound was muffled.She heard a bone-jarring thunk.The man in front of her, squeezing her throat, staggered once as his headjerked.It made no sense to her. His grip went slack. She gasped an urgent breath. Hishead tipped forward. A crescent-bladed axe was embedded in the back of the man’sneck, severing his spine.The axe handle swung in an arc as he dropped. Sebastian, measured fury withwhite hair, stood behind him.The last man let go of her arm. His other fist brought up a blood-slick sword.Sebastian was quicker than the man.Jennsen was quicker even than Sebastian.Surrender.She cried out, an animal sound, savage, unbridled, terror and fury. Her brokenblade slashed across the side of the man’s neck.Her half blade ripped bone-deep, cut the artery, severed muscles. He cried out.Blood seemed to float, suspended in midair, as the man pitched against the farwall on his way down. She’d swung so hard she fell sprawling with him.Sebastian’s short sword struck like lightning, slamming through the great barrelchest with bone-cracking power.Jennsen scrambled over the bodies, slipping on blood. She saw only her mother onthe floor, half sitting, leaning against the far wall. Her mother watched hercome. Jennsen couldn’t stop screaming, couldn’t breathe through her hystericalcries.Her mother, covered in blood, eyelids half closed, looked as if she were fallingasleep. But she had that spark of joy at seeing Jennsen. Always that spark inher eyes. Her face had bloody streaks from big fingers down the side. She smiledher beautiful smile at seeing Jennsen.“ Baby. . . “ she whispered.Jennsen couldn’t make herself stop screaming, shaking. She didn’t look down atthe awful red wounds.She saw only her mother’s face.“Mama, Mama, Mama.”One arm embraced her. Her other was gone. Her knife arm gone.The one around Jennsen was love and comfort and shelter.Her mother smiled a weary smile. “Baby ... you did good. Now, listen to me.”Sebastian was there, working frantically to tie something around what was leftof her mother’s right arm, trying to stem the tide of blood. Her mother only sawJennsen.“I’m here, Mama. Everything will be fine. I’m here. Mama-don’t die-Don’t die.Hold on, Mama. Hold on.”“Listen.” Her voice was hardly more than a breath.“I’m listening, Mama,” Jennsen cried. “I’m listening.”“I’m gone. I’m crossing to be with the good spirits, now.”“No, Mama, no, please no.”“Can’t help it, baby.... It’s all right. The good spirits will take good care ofme.”Jennsen held her mother’s face in both hands, trying to see it through thehelpless flood of tears. Jennsen gasped with frantic sobs.“Mama--don’t leave me alone. Don’t leave me. Please oh please don’t. Oh, Mama, Ilove you.”“Love you, baby. More than anything. I’ve taught you all I can. Listen, now. “Jennsen nodded, fearing to miss a single precious word.“The good spirits are taking me. You must understand that. When I go, this bodywon’t be me any longer. Understand? I don’t need it anymore.It doesn’t hurt at all. Not at all. Isn’t that a wonder? I’m with the goodspirits. You must be strong now, and leave what is no longer me,”“Mama,” Jennsen could only sob in agony as she held the face she loved more thanlife itself.“He’s coming for you, Jenn. Run. Don’t stay with this body that isn’t me afterI’m with the good spirits. Understand?”“No, Mama. I can’t leave you. I can’t.”“You must. Don’t foolishly risk your life just to bury this useless body. Itisn’t me. I’m in your heart and with the good spirits. This body isn’t me.Understand, baby?”“Yes, Mama. Not you. You’ll be with the good spirits. Not here.”Her mother nodded in Jennsen’s hands. “Good girl. Take the knife. I took one outwith it. It’s a worthy weapon.”“Mama, I love you.” Jennsen wished for better words but there were none. “I loveyou.”“I love you ... that’s why you must run, baby. I don’t want you to throw yourlife away over what is no longer me. Your life is too precious. Leave this emptyvessel. Run, Jenn. Or he’ll get you. Run.” Her eyes turned toward Sebastian.“Help her?”Sebastian, right there, nodded. “I swear I will.”She looked back at Jennsen and smiled her sweet love. “I’ll always be in yourheart, baby. Always. Love you, always,”“Oh Mama, you know I love you. Always.”Her mother smiled as she watched her daughter. Jennsen’s fingers caressed hermother’s beautiful face. For a fleeting eternity her mother watched her.Until Jennsen realized that her mother was no longer seeing anything in thisworld.Jennsen fell against her mother, dissolving in tears and terror. Choking insobs. Everything had ended. The crazy senseless world had ended.Her arms stretched out toward her mother as she was pulled away.“Jennsen.” His mouth was close to her ear. “We have to do what she wanted. ““No! Please oh please no,” she wailed.He gently pulled. “Jennsen, do as she asked. We must.”Jennsen pounded her fists against the blood-slicked floor. “No!” The world hadended. “ Oh please no. No, it can’t be.”“Jenn, we have to go.”“You go,” she sobbed. “I don’t care. I give up.”“No, Jenn, you don’t. You can’t.”His arm around her middle lifted her, set her on her wobbly legs. Numb, Jennsencouldn’t move. Nothing was real. Everything was a dream. The world was crumblingto ash.Holding her by her upper arms, he shook her. “Jennsen, we have to get out ofhere.”She turned her head and looked at her mother on the floor. “We have to dosomething. Please. We have to do something.”“Yes, we do. We have to leave before more men show up.”His face was dripping. She wondered if it was rain. As if she were watchingherself from some great disconnected distance, her own thoughts seemed crazy toher.“Jennsen, listen to me.” Her mother had said that. It was important. “Listen tome. We have to get out of here. Your mother was right. We have to go.”He turned to the pack beside the lamp on the table at the side of the room.Jennsen slumped to the floor. Her knees hit with a thump. She was empty ofeverything but the hot coals of agony from which she could not pull away. Whydid everything have to be so wrong?Jennsen crawled toward her sleeping mother. She couldn’t die. She couldn’t.Jennsen loved her too much for her to die.“Jennsen! Grieve later! We have to get out of here!”Out the open door, the rain poured down.“I won’t leave her!”“Your mother made a sacrifice for you-so you would have a life. Don’t throw awayher final act of courage.”He was stuffing whatever he could find in a pack. “You have to do as she said.She loves you and wants you to live. She told you to run. I swore I’d help you.We have to leave before they catch us here.”She stared at the door. It had been closed. She remembered crashing into it. Nowit stood open. Maybe the latch broke ...A huge shadow materialized out of the rain, melting through the doorway into thehouse.The brawny man’s eyes fixed on her. Feral fright surged through her. He movedtoward her. Faster and faster.Jennsen saw the knife with the ornate “R” sticking from the side of a dead man’sneck. The knife her mother told her to take. It wasn’t far. Her mother had losther arm-her life-to kill him.The man, seemingly oblivious of Sebastian, dove for Jennsen. She dove for theknife. Her fingers, greasy with blood, seized the handle. The worked metal gavegood grip. Art, with purpose. Deadly art. With teeth gritted, she yanked theblade free and rolled.Before the man reached her, Sebastian growled with the effort of burying his axein the back of the man’s head. The soldier crashed to the floor beside her, hismeaty arm falling across her middle.Jennsen, crying out, wriggled out from under the arm as blood grew in a darkpool beneath his head. Sebastian pulled her up.“Get whatever you want to take,” he ordered.She moved through the room, walking in a dream. The world had gone mad. Perhapsit was she who had finally gone mad.The voice in her head whispered to her, in its strange language. She foundherself listening, almost comforted by it.Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht.“We have to go,” Sebastian said. “Get what you want to take.”She couldn’t think. She didn’t know what to do. She blocked the voice and toldherself to do as her mother said to do.She went to the cupboard and rapidly began picking out things that they alwaystook when they traveled-things always at the ready. Traveling clothes were keptin her pack, ready to leave at a moment’s notice. She threw herbs, spices, anddried food in on top of them. She pulled other clothes, a brush, a small mirror,from a simple chest of woven branches.Her hand paused when she started grabbing her mother’s clothes for her. Shestopped, fingers trembling, focusing on her mother’s orders. She couldn’t think,so she moved like a trained animal, doing as she had been taught. They’d had torun before.She scanned the room. Four dead D’Harans. One that morning. That made five. Aquad plus one. Where were the other three? In the dark outside the door? In thetrees? In the dark woods, waiting? Waiting to take her to Lord Rahl to betortured to death?With both hands, Sebastian seized her wrist. “Jennsen, what are you doing?”She realized she was stabbing at the empty air.She watched as he pried the knife from her fist and returned it to its sheath.He tucked it behind her belt. He scooped up her cloak, which the huge D’Haransoldier had ripped off her as she had first fallen into the nightmare.“Hurry up, Jennsen. Grab anything else you want.”Sebastian rifled through the dead men’s pockets, pulling out money he found,cramming it in his own pockets. He unstrapped all four knives, none as good asthe one he’d tucked behind her belt, the one with the ornate letter “R” on thehandle, the one from the fallen dead man, the one her mother had used.Sebastian slipped the four knives down the side of the pack as he yelled at heragain to hurry. While he took the best sword from one of the men, Jennsen wentto the table. She scooped up candles and stuffed them in the pack. Sebastianattached the scabbard of the sword to his weapons belt. Jennsen collected smallimplements--cooking utensils, pots-pushing them in her pack. She wasn’t reallyaware of what she was taking. She was just picking up whatever she saw andputting it in.Sebastian lifted her pack, took one of her wrists, and stuffed it through thestrap, as if he were handling a rag doll. He put her other arm through the otherstrap he held out for her, then threw her cloak around her shoulders. After hepulled the hood up over her head, he stuffed her red hair in the sides.He held her mother’s pack in one hand. He tugged twice and freed his axe fromthe soldier’s skull. Blood ran down the handle as he hooked the axe on hisweapons belt. With the heel of his sword hand against the small of her back, heurged her onward.“Anything else?” he asked as they moved toward the door. “Jennsen, do you wantanything else from your house before we go?”Jennsen looked over her shoulder at her mother on the floor.“She’s gone, Jennsen. The good spirits are taking care of her, now. She’ssmiling down on you, now.”Jennsen looked up at him. “Really? You think so?”“Yes. She’s in a better world, now. She told us to go from here. We have to dowhat she said.”In a better world. Jennsen clung to that idea. Her world held only anguish.She moved toward the door, doing as Sebastian said to do. He scanned in everydirection. She simply followed, stepping over bodies, over bloody arms and legs.She was too scared to feel anymore, too heartsick to care. Her thoughts seemedcompletely muddled. She had always prided herself on her clear thinking. Wherehad her clear thinking gone?In the rain, he pulled her by her arm toward the path down.“Betty,” she said, digging in her heels. “We have to get Betty.”He gazed at the path, then toward the cave. “I don’t think we need bother withthe goat, but I should get my pack, my things.”She saw he was standing in the downpour without his cloak. He was soaked to theskin. It occurred to her that she wasn’t the only one who wasn’t thinkingclearly. He was so intent on escaping that he almost left his things. That wouldbe the death of him. She couldn’t let him die. Betty would help, but there wasone other thing that she remembered. Jennsen ran back in the house.She ignored Sebastian’s yells. Inside, she wasted no time rushing to a smallwooden chest just inside the door. She looked at nothing else as she pulled outtwo bundled sheepskin cloaks-one hers, one her mother’s. They kept them there,rolled and tied, at the ready, in case they ever had to leave in a hurry. Hewatched from the doorway, impatient, but silent when he saw what she was doing.Without looking death in the eye, she rushed back out of her house for the lasttime.Together, they ran to the cave. The fire was still crackling hot. Betty pacedand trembled but was uncharacteristically silent, as if knowing something wasterribly wrong.“Dry yourself a bit, first,” she said.“We don’t have time! We have to get out of here. The others could come at anymoment.”“You’ll freeze to death if you don’t. Then what good will running do? Dead isdead.” Her own reasoned words surprised her.Jennsen pulled the two rolled sheepskin cloaks from under her wool cloak andstarted working loose the knots in the thongs. “These will help keep the rainout, but you need to get dry, first, otherwise you won’t stay warm enough.”He was nodding as he shivered and rubbed his hands before the fire, the sense ofwhat she said finally overcoming his urgency to be gone. She wondered how hemanaged to do all he had done with a fever and after having taken herbs. Fear,she guessed. Stark-raving fear. That, she understood.Her whole body ached. Not only had she been banged around, but she saw now thather shoulder was bleeding. The cut wasn’t bad, but it throbbed. The sustainedlevel of terror had left her drained and exhausted.She wanted only to lie down and cry, but her mother had told her to get away.Only her mother’s words motivated her now. Without those last commands, Jennsenwould be unable to function. Now she simply did what her mother had told her todo.Betty was beside herself. The distRahlght goat tried to climb the pen to get toJennsen. As Sebastian hovered over the fire, Jennsen tied a rope around Betty’sneck. The goat was as thankful to be going as a goat could be.They would give Betty a chance to return the favor. When they had gotten awayand found at least simple shelter, they would not be able to build a fire onsuch a wet night. If they could find a dry hole, a spot under a rock ledge, orbeneath fallen trees, they would hunker down beside the goat. Betty would keepthem both warm so they wouldn’t freeze to death.Jennsen understood the plaintive calls Betty made toward the house. The goat’sears were at attention. Betty was worried for the woman who wasn’t going.Jennsen collected all the carrots and acorns off the shelf, stuffing them inpockets and packs.When Sebastian was as dry as he was going to allow himself to get, they donnedtheir wool cloaks and topped them with the sheepskin. With Jennsen leading Bettyby the rope, they started out into the drenching darkness. Sebastian headed forthe trail down from the front-the way he had come in.Jennsen seized his arm, stopping him. “They might be waiting down there. ““But we have to get out of here.”“I have a better way. We made an escape route.”He gazed at her a moment through the fall of icy rain separating them, then,without further protest, followed her into the unknown."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Oba Schalk snatched the chicken by the neck and lifted it from the nest box. Thechicken’s head looked tiny above his meaty fist. With his other hand, he fisheda warm brown egg from the bottom of the depression in the straw. He gentlyplaced the egg in the basket with the others.Oba didn’t set the chicken back down.He grinned as he lifted it closer to his face, watching its head twist from sideto side, its beak open and close, open and close. He put his own lips close, sothe beak was touching his lips, then, with all his might, he blew in thechicken’s open mouth.The chicken squawked and flapped, madly trying to escape the viselike fist. Adeep laugh rolled up from Oba’s throat.“Oba! Oba, where are you!”When he heard his mother hollering for him, Oba plopped the chicken back on itsnest. His mother’s voice had come from the nearby barn. Squawking its terror,the chicken fled the henhouse. Oba followed it out of the coop and then trottedtoward the door to the barn.The week before, they had had a rare winter downpour. By the following day, thestanding water had frozen and the rain had turned to snow. Windswept snow nowhid the ice, making for treacherous footing. Despite his size, Oba negotiatedthe icy conditions without much difficulty. Oba prided himself on being light onhis feet.It was important for a person not to let their body or mind become and dull. Obabelieved it was important to learn new things. He believed it was important togrow. He thought it was important for a to use what they had learned. That washow people grew.The barn and house were one small structure made of wattle and woven branchescovered with a mixture of clay, straw, and dung. the house and barn wereseparated by a stone wall. After he’d built house, Oba had made the wall insideby stacking flat gray rocks from the field. He had learned the technique fromobserving a neighbor stack mocks at the side of his field. The wall was a luxurymost homes didn’t have.Hearing his mother yell his name again, he tried to think of what he could havedone wrong. As he perused his mental list of the chores she’d had him to do, hecouldn’t recall one in the barn that he’d failed to do. Oba wasn’t forgetful,and besides, they were chores he did often. There shouldn’t be anything in thebarn to have set her off.True as all that was, none of it shielded him from incurring his mother’s ire.She could think of things that needed doing that had never before needed doing.“Oba! Oba! How many times do I need to call for you!”In his mind’s eye, he could see her mean little mouth all pinched up as she saidhis name, expecting him to appear the instant she screeched for him. The womanhad a voice that could unwind a good rope.Oba turned sideways to fit his shoulders through the small side door into thebarn. Rats squeaked and scurried away at his feet. The barn, with a hayloftabove, housed their milk cow, two hogs, and two oxen. The cow was still in thebarn. The hogs had been turned loose in the oak stand to rut for acorns underthe snow. Oba could see the hind ends of both oxen through the larger barn doorout to the yard on the other side.His mother stood on the low hill of frozen muck, hands on her hips, the coldsmoke of her breath rising from her nostrils like a dragon’s fiery snort.Mother was a big-boned woman, broad in the shoulders and hips. Broad everywhere.Even her forehead was broad. He had heard people say that when his mother wasyounger she had been a handsome woman, and indeed, when he had been a boy, shehad had a number of suitors. Year by year, though, the struggles of life hadworn away her looks, leaving behind deeply etched lines and sagging folds offlesh. The suitors had long ago stopped coming around.Oba made his way across the black, icy ground inside the barn and stood beforeher, hands in his pockets. She walloped the side of his shoulder with a stoutstick. “Oba.” He flinched when she whacked him three times more, each swatpunctuating his name. “Oba. Oba. Oba.”When he had been young, such a thrashing would have left him black and blue. Hewas too big and strong, now, for her stick to hurt him. That made her angry,too.While he wasn’t bothered much by the stick now that he was grown, thecondemnation in her voice whenever she spoke his name still made his ears bum.She reminded him of a spider with a mean little mouth. A black widow spider.He hunched, trying not to look so big. “What is it, Mama?”“Where are you loafing when your mother calls?” Her face screwed up, a plum longago turned to a prune. “Oba the ox. Oba the dimwit. Oba the oaf. Where wereyou!”Oba lifted his arm defensively as she cracked him with the stick again. “I wasgetting the eggs, Mama. Getting the eggs.”“Look at this mess! Don’t it ever occur to you to do anything round here unlesssomeone with brains tells you to?”Oba looked around, but didn’t see what needed doing-other than the regularwork-that would have set her off so. There was always work to do. Rats stucktheir noses out from under boards in the stalls, whiskers twitching as theysniffed, watching with beady black eyes, listening with little rat ears.He looked back at his mother, but had no answer. None would suit her, anyway.She pointed at the ground. “Look at this place! Don’t you ever think to scoopout the muck? Soon as it thaws it’ll be running under the wall and into thehouse where I sleep. Do you think I feed you for nothing? Don’t you think youhave to earn your keep, you lazy oaf? Oba the oaf.”She had already used the last invective. Oba was surprised, sometimes, that shewasn’t more creative, didn’t learn new things. When he had been little she hadseemed to him a mind reader of inscrutable ability, with a talented tongue thatcould cut him with knowing lashes. Now that he had grown so much larger thanher, he sometimes wondered if other aspects of his mother were less formidablethan he had once feared, wondered if her power over him wasn’t somehow ...artificial. An illusion. A scarecrow with a mean little mouth.Yet she still had a way about her that could cut him down to nothing.And she was his mother. A person was supposed to mind their mother. That was themost important thing a person could do. She had taught him that lesson well.Oba didn’t think he could do much more to earn his keep. He worked from sunup tosundown. He prided himself on not being lazy. Oba was a man of action. He wasstrong, and worked as hard as any two men. He could best any man he knew. Mendidn’t give him any trouble. Women, though, stymied him. He never knew what todo around women. Big as he was, women had a way of making him feel puny.He scuffed his boot against the dark, rippled, slick mound underfoot, assessingthe rock-hard mass. The animals added to it continually, much of it freezingbefore it could all be scooped out, allowing it to build in layers throughoutthe long, cold winter. Periodically, Oba scattered straw over the top for betterfooting. He’d not want his mother to slip and fall. It wasn’t long, though,before the layer of straw became slicked over and it was time for another.“But Mama, the ground’s all frozen.”In the past, he had always scooped it out as it thawed and could be worked. Inthe spring, when it got warmer and the flies filled the barn with their constantbuzzing, it would come off in layers where the straw was. But not now. Now, itwas welded together into a solid mass.“Always an excuse. Isn’t that right, Oba? Always an excuse for your mother. Youworthless bastard boy.”She folded her arms, glowering at him. He couldn’t hide from the truth, couldn’tpretend, and she knew it.Oba peered around in the dark barn and saw the heavy steel scoop shovel leaningagainst the wall.“I’ll scoop it, Mama. You go back to your spinning, and I’ll scoop the barngood.”He didn’t exactly know how he was going to scoop the solid frozen muck, onlythat he had to.“Get started now,” she huffed. “Use what light is left of the day. When it getsdark, then I want you to go to town to get me some medicine from Lathea. “Now he knew why she had come to the barn looking for him.“My knees is aching me again,” she complained, as if she wanted to cut off anyobjection he might voice, even though he never did. He thought it, though. Shealways seemed to know what he was thinking.Today you can get started in the barn, and tomorrow you can go back to scrapingthe muck all the way down until you clean it all out. Before the day wears on,though, I want you to go get my medicine.”Oba pulled on his ear as he cast his gaze toward the ground. He didn’t likegoing to see Lathea, the woman with the cures. He didn’t like her. She alwayslooked at him like he was a worm. She was mean as rake. Worse, she was asorceress.If Lathea didn’t like someone, they suffered for it. Everybody was afraid ofLathea, so Oba didn’t feel so singled out. Still, though, he didn’t like goingto see her.“I will, Mama. I’ll fetch your medicine. And don’t you worry, I’ll get to workat scraping the muck out, just like you said.”“I have to tell you every little thing, don’t I, Oba?” Her glare burned intohim. “I don’t know why I bothered raising such a worthless bastard boy,” sheadded under her breath. “Should have done what Lathea told me, in thebeginning.”Oba heard her say this often, when she was feeling sorry for herself, sorry thatno suitors came around anymore, sorry that none had wanted to marry her. Oba wasa curse she bore with bitter regret. A bastard child who’d brought her troublefrom the first. If not for Oba, maybe she would have gotten herself a husband toprovide for her.“And don’t you be staying in town with any foolishness.”“I won’t, Mama. I’m sorry that your knees are bad today.”She whacked him with the stick. “They wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t have tofollow around a big dumb ox seeing that he does what he should already bedoing.”“Yes, Mama.”“Did you get the eggs?”“Yes, Mama.”She eyed him suspiciously, then pulled a coin from her flaxen apron. “TellLathea to make up a remedy for you, too, along with my medicine. Maybe we canyet rid you of the Keeper’s evil. If we could get the evil out of you, maybe youwouldn’t be so worthless.”His mother, from time to time, sought to purge him of what she believed to behis evil nature. She tried all sorts of potions. When he was little she hadoften forced him to drink burning powder she mixed with soapy water; then shewould lock him in a pen in the barn, hoping the otherworldly evil wouldn’t likebeing burned and locked up both, and would flee his restrained earthly body.His pen didn’t have slats, like the pens for the animals did. It was made ofsolid boards. In the summer it was an oven. When she made him take burningpowder and then dragged him by the arm and locked him in the pen, he near todied of terror that she’d never let him out, or never let him have a drink ofwater. He welcomed the beatings she would give him to try to silence hisscreams, just to be let out.“You buy my medicine from Lathea, and a remedy for you.” His mother held up thesmall silver coin as her eyes narrowed into a spiteful squint. “And don’t you gowasting any of this on women.”Oba felt his ears heating. Each time his mother sent him to buy something,whether medicine or leather work or pottery or supplies, she always admonishedhim not to waste the money on women.He knew that when she told him not to waste it on women, she was mocking him.Oba didn’t have the courage to say much of anything to women. He always boughtwhat his mother said to buy. He never once wasted it on anything-he feared hismother’s wrath.He hated that she always told him not to waste the money when he never did. Itmade him feel like she thought he was intending to do wrong even though hewasn’t. It made him guilty even though he had done no wrong. It made what was inhis thoughts, even if he didn’t have them, a crime.He tugged on a burning ear. “I won’t waste it, Mama.”“And dress respectable, not like some dumb ox. You already reflect badly enoughon me.”“I will, Mama. You’ll see.”Oba ran around to the house and fetched his felt cap and brown woolen jacket forhis journey to Gretton, a couple miles northwest. She watched him carefully hangthem on a peg, where they would stay clean until he was ready to go to town.With the scoop shovel, he started in on the rock-hard muck. The steel shovelrang like a bell each time he rammed it at the frozen ground. He grunted witheach mighty blow. Chips of black ice burst forth, splattering his trousers. Eachwas but an infinitesimal speck from the dark mountain of muck. It was going totake a long time and a lot of work. He didn’t mind hard work, though. Time hehad in abundance.Mother watched from the doorway of the barn for a few minutes to make sure hewas working up a sweat as he chipped away at the frozen mound. When she wassatisfied, she vanished from the doorway to go back to her own work, leaving himto think about his coming visit to Lathea.Oba.Oba paused. The rats, back in the small places, stilled. Their little black rateyes watched him watching them. The rats went back to their search for food. Obalistened for the familiar voice. He heard the door to the house close. Mother, aspinster, was going back to spinning her wool. Mr. Tuchmann brought her wool,which she spun into thread for him to use on his loom. The meager pay helpedsupport her and her bastard son.Oba.Oba knew the voice well. He’d heard it ever since he could remember. He nevertold his mother about it. She would be angry and think that it was the Keeper’sevil calling to him. She would want to force him to swallow even more potionsand cures. He was too big to be locked in the pen anymore. But he wasn’t too bigto drink Lathea’s cures.When one of the fat rats scurried past, Oba stepped on its tail, trapping it.Oba.The rat squeaked a little rat squeak. Little rat legs scrambled, trying to getaway. Little rat claws scratched against the black ice.Oba reached down and seized the fat furry body. He peered at the whiskered face.The head twisted futilely. Beady black eyes watched him.Those eyes were filled with fear.Surrender.Oba thought it was vitally important to learn new things.Quick as a fox, he bit off the rat’s head."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8From what seemed to her the least troublesome corner of the room, Jennsen keptan eye on the door as well as the boisterous crowd. Half a room away, Sebastianleaned on the thick wooden plank counter, speaking to the innkeeper. She was abig woman, and with a forbidding scowl that made her look like she was as usedto trouble as she was prepared to deal with it.The roomful of people, mostly men, were a jovial lot. Some of the men played atdice or other table games. Some arm-wrestled. Most were drinking and tellingjokes that would set tables of them off in peals of fist-pounding laughter.Laughter sounded obscene to Jennsen. There was no joy in her world. There couldbe none.The past week was a blur. Or was it more than a week? She couldn’t recallexactly how long they had been traveling. What did it matter? What did anythingmatter?Jennsen was unaccustomed to people. People had always represented danger to her.Groups of them made her nervous-people at an inn, drinking and gambling, evenmore so.When men noticed her standing at the end of the counter near the wall, theyforgot the jokes, or paused at their dice, and lingered on the sight of her.Meeting their gazes, she pushed the hood of her cloak back, letting her thickrings of red hair fall over the front of her shoulders. That was enough to turntheir eyes back to their own business, Jennsen’s red hair spooked people,especially those who were superstitious. Red hair was uncommon enough that itraised suspicion. It gave people a worry that she might be gifted, or perhapsthat she might even be a witch. Jennsen, by boldly meeting their gazes, playedon such fears. It had in the past helped protect her, oftentimes better than aknife could have.Back at her house, it hadn’t helped one little bit.After the men turned away from her and went back to their dice and drinks,Jennsen looked back down the counter. The stout innkeeper was staring at her, ather red hair. When Jennsen met her gaze, the woman quickly turned her attentionback to Sebastian. He asked her another question. She bent closer as she spoketo him. Jennsen couldn’t hear them over the roar of all the talking, joking,betting, cheering, cursing, and laughing. Sebastian nodded to the woman’s wordsspoken close to his ear. She pointed off over the heads of her customers,apparently giving directions.Sebastian straightened and pulled a coin from his pocket, then slid it acrossthe counter toward the woman. After taking the coin, she traded it for a keyfrom a box behind her. Sebastian scooped the key off the counter worn smooth bycountless mugs and hands. He picked up his own mug, and bid the woman a goodday.When he reached the end of the counter, he leaned close to Jennsen so she couldhear him and gestured with his mug. “You sure you wouldn’t like a drink?”Jennsen shook her head.He kept an eye on the roomful of people. They were all once again engaged intheir own business. “It was a good thing you pushed your hood back. Until thewoman of the house saw that red hair of yours, she was playing dumb. After that,her tongue loosened.”“The woman knows her? She is still living here in Gretton, as my mother said?The innkeeper is sure?”Sebastian took a long drink, watching a roll of dice bring a cheer for thewinner. “She gave me directions.”“And you got us rooms?”“Only one room.” As he took another swig, he saw her reaction. “Better to betogether in case of trouble. I thought it would be safer with us both in oneroom.”“I’d rather sleep with Betty.” Realizing how that must have sounded, she lookedaway in embarrassment and added, “Than in an inn, I mean. I’d rather be bymyself than where there are so many people so close all around. I’d feel saferin the woods than closed in a room, here. I didn’t mean-,,“I know what you meant.” Sebastian’s blue eyes took up his smile. “It will doyou good to sleep inside-it’s going to be a bitter night. And Betty will bebetter sheltered at the stable.”The man who ran the stable had been a bit surprised to be asked to stable a goatfor the night, but horses enjoyed the company of goats, so he was accommodating.That first night, Betty had probably saved their lives. Sebastian, with hisfever, might not have survived had Jennsen not found a dry place under a jut ofledge. The back of the small cleft beneath the overhang narrowed to a point, butit was big enough for the two of them. Jennsen had cut balsam and fir limbs toline the depression, lest the cold rock sap their bodies of heat. She andSebastian then wedged themselves into the back. With Jennsen’s urging and withthe aid of the rope, Betty knelt behind the pine boughs positioned over theopening and then lay down close before them. With Betty’s body against them,blocking the cold and providing her warmth, they had a dry, warm bed.Jennsen quietly wept the long miserable night away. She was at least relievedthat Sebastian, feverish, was able to sleep. By morning, his fever had broken.Morning had been the first day of Jennsen’s bleak new life without her mother.Leaving her mother’s body there at the house, all alone, constantly hauntedJennsen. The memory of the horrifying bloody sight gave her nightmares. That hermother was gone brought limitless tears and crushed Jennsen with heartache. Lifeseemed desolate and meaningless.But Sebastian and Jennsen had escaped. They had survived. That instinct tosurvive, and knowing all that her mother had done to give Jennsen life, kept hergoing. At times she wished she were not such a coward and could simply face theend and be done with it. At other times the terror of being pursued kept herputting one foot in front of the other. At yet other moments she felt a sense offierce commitment to life, to not allowing all her mother’s sacrifices to be invain.“We should have some supper,” Sebastian said. “They have lamb stew. Then maybeyou should get a good night’s sleep in a warm bed before we go see this oldacquaintance of yours. I’ll stand watch while you sleep.”Jennsen shook her head. “No. Let’s go see her now. We can sleep later.” She hadseen people eating thick stew from wooden bowls. The thought of food held noappeal for her.Sebastian studied the look on her face and saw that he wasn’t going to talk herout of it. He drained the mug and set it on the counter. “It’s not far. We’re onthe right side of town.”Outside in the gathering dusk, she asked, “Why did you want to stay here, atthis inn? There were other places much nicer, where the people didn’t look so... rough. “His blue-eyed gaze swept the buildings, the dark doorways, the alleys, as hisfingers touched his cloak, seeking the reassurance of the hilt of his sword. “Arough crowd asks fewer questions, especially the kind of questions we don’t wantto answer.”He seemed to her a man who was used to avoiding having questions asked of him.She stepped along the narrow furrow of a frozen rut, following it down the roadtoward the woman’s house, a woman Jennsen only dimly remembered. She held ontightly to the hope that the woman might be able to help. Her mother must havehad some reason for not going to this woman again, but Jennsen could think ofnothing else to try but to seek her aid.Without her mother, Jennsen needed help. The other three members of the quadwere surely hunting her. Five men dead told her that there were at least twoquads. That would mean at least three of those killers were still after her. Itwas entirely possible there were more. It was probable that even if there werenot more, there soon would be.They had escaped by using the hidden trail away from her house-the men probablywouldn’t have been expecting that-so she and Sebastian had gained the temporarysafety of distance. The rain would have done a good job of covering any tracks.It was possible that the two of them had gotten away cleanly and were for thetime being safe. But since her pursuer was the Lord Rahl himself, it was alsopossible that the killers were, by some dark and mysterious means, moment bymoment, closing in on her.After the horrifying encounter with the huge soldiers at her house, the terrorof that possibility always loomed in Jennsen’s fears.At a deserted corner, Sebastian pointed to the right. “Down this street.”They walked past dark buildings, square and windowless, that suggested to herthat maybe they were only used for storage. No one seemed to live down thestreet. Before long, they’d left the buildings behind.Trees, naked before the bitter wind, huddled in clumps. When they came to anarrow road, Sebastian pointed.“By the directions, it’s the house down this road, down at the end, in thatstand of trees.”The road looked to be little used. Weak light from a distant window stolethrough bare branches of oak and alder. The light, rather than warm invitation,shone more like a glowing warning to stay away.“Why don’t you wait here,” she said. “It might be better if I went alone.”She was providing him with an excuse. Most people didn’t want anything to dowith a sorceress. Jennsen, herself, wished she had some other choice.“I’ll go with you.”He had shown a distinct distrust of anything to do with magic. The way his eyeswatched the dark place off through the branches and brush to the sides, he mighthave been trying to sound more brave than he was.Jennsen admonished herself for even thinking such thoughts. He had foughtD’Haran soldiers who not only had been much bigger than he, but had outnumberedhim. He could have simply stayed out in the cave and not risked his life. Hecould have left the scene of such carnage and gone on with his life. Fearingmagic only proved him of sound mind. She, of all people, could understandfearing magic.Snow crunched under their boots as the two of them, after reaching the end ofthe road, made their way along the narrow path through the trees. Sebastianwatched off to the sides while her attention was mostly fixed on the house.Behind the small place, the woods marched off up foothills. Jennsen imaginedthat only those with a strong need dared walk the path toward this door.Jennsen reasoned that if the sorceress lived this near in to town, then she mustbe someone who helped people, someone whom people trusted. It was entirelypossible that the woman was a valued and respected member of the community-ahealer, devoted to helping others. Not someone to fear.As the wind moaned through the trees looming around her, Jennsen rapped on thedoor. Sebastian’s gaze studied the woods to each side. Off behind them thelights from homes and businesses would at least provide light enough for them tofind their way back.As she waited, Jennsen’s gaze, too, was drawn to the gloom all around.She imagined eyes in the darkness watching her. The hairs at the back of herneck lifted.The door finally drew in, but only as wide as the face of the woman peering outat them. “Yes?”Jennsen couldn’t clearly make out the shadowed features of the face, but by thelight coming out through the partly opened door, the woman could see Jennsenplainly enough.“Are you Lathea?” she asked. “Lathea, the ... sorceress?”“Why?”“We were told that Lathea the sorceress lives here. If that’s you, may we comein?”Still the door didn’t open any wider. Jennsen pulled her cloak tighter againstthe cold night air, as well as the chilly reception. The woman’s steady looktook in Sebastian, then Jennsen’s form hidden within a heavy cloak.“I’m not a midwife. If you want to get yourself out of the trouble you two arein, I can’t help with that. Go see a midwife.”Jennsen was mortified. “That’s not why we’re here!”The woman peered out for a moment, considering the two strangers at her door.“What sort of medicine do you need, then?”“No medicine. A ... spell. I’ve met you before, once. I need a spell like youonce cast for me-when I was little.”The face in the shadows frowned. “When? Where?”Jennsen cleared her throat. “Back at the People’s Palace. When I lived there.You helped me when I was little.”“Helped you what? Speak up, girl.”“Helped ... hide me. With some kind of spell, I believe. I was little at thetime, so I don’t recall exactly.”“Hide you?”“From Lord Rahl.There was an awful silence from the house.“Do you remember? My name is Jennsen. I was very little at the time.” Jennsenpushed her hood back so the woman could see her ringlets of red hair lit in thewedge of light coming through the door.“Jennsen. Don’t recall the name, but the hair I remember. It’s not often onesees hair like yours.”Jennsen’s spirits buoyed with relief. “It has been a while. I’m so glad to hearthat-”“I don’t deal in your kind,” the woman said. “Never have. I cast no spell foryou.”Jennsen was stunned speechless. She didn’t know what to say. She was sum thewoman had once cast a spell to help her.“Now, be gone. The both of you.” The door started to close.“Wait! Please-I can pay.”Jennsen reached into a pocket and hurriedly brought out a coin. Only after shepassed it through the door did she see that it had been gold.The woman inspected the gold mark for a time, perhaps considering if it wasworth becoming involved again in what was sure to be a high crime, even for whatamounted to a small fortune.“Now do you remember?” Sebastian asked.The woman’s eyes turned to him. “And who are you?”“Just a friend.”“I need your help again. My mother . Jennsen couldn’t bring herself to say it,and started over in a different direction. “I remember my mother telling meabout you, and how you helped us, once. I was very little at the time, but Iremember having the spell cast over me. It wore off years ago. I need that helpagain.”“Well, you have the wrong person.”Jennsen’s fists tightened on her wool cloak. She had no other ideas. This wasthe only thing she could think of.“Lathea, please, I’m at my wits’ end. I need help.”“She’s given you a goodly sum,” Sebastian put in. “If you say that we have thewrong person, and you don’t want to help, then I guess we should save the goldfor the right person.”Lathea gave him a sly smile. “Oh, I said she had the wrong person, but I didn’tsay I couldn’t earn the payment tendered.”“I don’t understand,” Jennsen said, holding her cloak closed at her throat asshe shivered with cold.Lathea gazed out at her for a moment, as if waiting to be sure they were payingclose attention. “You are looking for my sister, Althea. I am La-thea. She isAl-thea. She is the one who helped you, not I. Your mother probably got ournames mixed up, or you recalled it wrong. It used to be a common mistake, backwhen we were together. Althea and I have different talents with the gift. It wasshe who helped you and your mother, not I.”Jennsen was dumbfounded and disappointed, but at least not defeated.There was still a thread of hope. “Please, Lathea, could you help me this time?In your sister’s place?”“No. I can do nothing for you. I am blind to your kind. Only Althea can see theholes in the world. I cannot.”Jennsen didn’t know what that meant-holes in the world. “Blind ... to my kind?”“Yes. I have told you what I can. Now, go away.”The woman started pulling back from the door.“Wait! Please! Can you at least tell me where your sister lives, then?”She looked back at Jennsen’s expectant face. “This is dangerous business-”“It’s business,” Sebastian said, his voice as cold as the night, “A gold mark’sworth. For that price we should at the least have the place where we can findyour sister.”Lathea considered his words, then in a voice as cold as his had been said toJennsen, “I don’t want nothing to do with your kind. Understand? Nothing. IfAlthea does, that’s her business. Inquire at the People’s Palace. “Jennsen seemed to remember traveling to a woman not terribly far from thepalace. She had thought it was Lathea, but it must have been her sister, Althea.“But can’t you tell me more than that? Where she lives, how I can find her?”“Last time I saw her she lived near there with her husband. You can inquirethere for the sorceress Althea. People will know her-if she still lives.”Sebastian put his hand against the door before the woman could shut it. “That’sa pretty thin bit of information. We should have more than that for the priceoffered.”“For what I have told you the price is paltry. I gave you the information youneed. If my sister wants to tempt her doom, that’s up to her. What I don’t need,for any price, is trouble.”“We mean no trouble,” Jennsen said. “We only need the help of a spell, If youcan’t help with that, then we thank you for your sister’s name. We will seek herout. But there are some important things I need to know. If you could tell me-”“If you had any decency, you’d leave Althea alone. Your kind will only bring usharm. Now go from my door before I set a nightmare upon you.”Jennsen stared at the face in the shadows.“Someone already has,” she said as she turned away."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9Oba, feeling fashionable in his cap and brown wool jacket, walked down the sidesof the narrow streets, humming a tune he had heard played on a pipe at an innhe’d passed. He had to wait for a rider to go by before he turned down Lathea’sroad. The horse’s ears swiveled toward him as it passed. Oba had had a horse,once, and liked to ride, but his mother had decided that they couldn’t afford tokeep a horse. Oxen were more useful and did more work, but they weren’t ascompanionable.As he walked down the dark road, his boots crunching on the crust of snow, acouple came past from the opposite direction, from the direction of Lathea’splace. He wondered if they had gone to the sorceress for a cure. The woman casta wary look his way. On a dark road, such a reaction was not undue, and, too,Oba knew that his size frightened some women. She sidestepped clear of him. Theman with her met Oba’s gaze-many men didn’t.The way they stared reminded Oba of the rat. He grinned at that memory, atlearning new things. Both the man and the woman thought he was grinning at them.Oba tipped his cap to the lady. She returned a weak smile. It was the kind ofempty smile Oba had often seen from women. It made him feel a buffoon. Thecouple melted into the dark streets.Oba stuffed his hands in his jacket pockets and turned back toward Lathea’splace. He hated going there in the dark. The sorceress was fearsome enoughwithout the walk down her dark path. He let out a troubled sigh into the briskwinter air.He wasn’t afraid to confront the strength of men, but he knew he was helplessagainst the mysteries of magic. He knew how much misery her potions inflictedupon him. They burned him going in and coming out. They not only hurt, they madehim lose control of himself, making him seem like he was just an animal. It washumiliating.He had heard tell of others, though, who had angered the sorceress and sufferedworse fates-fevers, blindness, a slow lingering death. One man had gone mad andrun off naked into a swamp. People said he must have crossed the sorceress,somehow. They found him snakebit and dead, all puffed up and purple, floatingamong the slimy weed. Oba couldn’t imagine what the man had done to earn such afate from the sorceress. He should have known better and been more cautious withthe old shrew.Sometimes, Oba had nightmares about what she might do to him with her magic. Heimagined Lathea’s powers could lance him with a thousand cuts, or even strip theflesh from his bones. Boil his eyes in his head. Or make his tongue swell untilhe gagged and choked in a slow, agonizing death.He hurried along the path. The sooner started, the sooner finished. Oba hadlearned that.When he reached the house he knocked. “It’s Oba Schalk. My mother sent me forher medicine.”He watched his breath cloud in the air while he waited. The door finally openeda sliver so she could peer out at him. He thought that, being a sorceress, sheshould be able to see him without having to open the door for a look, first.Sometimes when he was there waiting for Lathea to mix up medicine, someone wouldcome and she would simply open the door. Whenever Oba came, though, she alwayspeered out first to see it was him.“Oba.” Her voice was as sour with recognition as her expression.The door opened to admit him. Cautiously, respectfully, Oba stepped inside. Hepeered about, even though he knew the place well. He was careful not to act tooforward with her. Harboring no fear of him, she swatted his shoulder to spur himto move deeper into the room to give her the leeway to shut the door.“Your mother’s knees, again?” the sorceress asked, pushing the door closedagainst the frigid air.Oba nodded as he stared at the floor. “She says they’re aching her, and she’dlike some of your medicine.” He knew he had to tell her the rest of it. “Sheasked for you to ... to send along something for me, as well.”Lathea smiled in that sly way she had. “Something for you, Oba?”Oba knew that she knew very well what he meant. There were only two cures heever went to her for--one for his mother and the one for him. She liked to makehim say it, though. Lathea was as mean as a toothache.“A remedy for me, too, Mama said.”Her face floated closer. She peered up at him, the snaky smile still playingacross her features. “A remedy for wickedness?” Her voice came in a hiss. “Thatit, Oba? Is that what Mother Schalk wanted you to fetch?”He cleared his throat and nodded. He felt puny before her thin smile, so helooked back down at the floor.Lathea’s gaze lingered on him. He wondered what was in that clever mind of hers,what devious thoughts, what grim schemes. She finally moved off to fetch theingredients she kept in the tall cabinet. The rough pine door squeaked as shepulled it open. She set bottles in the crook of her other arm and carried themto the table in the middle of the room.“She keeps trying, doesn’t she, Oba?” Her voice had gone flat, like she wastalking to herself. “Keeps trying even though it never changes what is.”Oba.An oil lamp on the trestle table lit the collection of bottles as she set themthere, one at a time, her eyes lingering on each. She was thinking aboutsomething. Maybe what vile brew she might mix up for him this time, what sort ofsickly condition she would inflict upon him in an attempt to purge him of hisever present, unspecified, evil.The oak logs in the hearth had checkered in the wavering yellow-orange glow ofthe fire, throwing good heat as well as light into the room. In the middle oftheir room, Oba and his mother had a pit for a fire. He liked the way the smokein Lathea’s fireplace went right up the chimney and out of the house, ratherthan hanging in the room before eventually making its way out a small hole inthe roof. Oba liked a proper fireplace, and thought that he should make one forhim and his mother. Every time he went to Lathea’s place, he studied the way herfireplace was built. It was important to learn things.He also kept an eye on Lathea’s back as she poured liquid from bottles into awide-mouthed jar. She mixed the concoction with a glass rod as each newingredient was slowly added. When she was satisfied, she poured the medicine ina small bottle and stoppered it with a cork.She handed him the little bottle. “For your mother.”Oba passed her the coin his mother had given him. She watched his eyes as herknobby fingers slipped the coin into a pocket in her dress. Oba finally let hisbreath go after she turned back to her table, to her work. She lifted a fewbottles, studying them in the light of the fire, before she began mixing hiscure. His cursed cure.Oba didn’t like speaking with Lathea, but her silence often made him even moreuncomfortable, made him itch. He couldn’t really think of anything worthy ofsaying, but he finally decided that he had to say something.“Mama will be glad for the medicine. She’s hoping it will help her knees.”“And she’s hoping for something to cure her son?”Oba shrugged, regretting his attempt at casual conversation. “Yes, ma’am. “The sorceress peered back over her shoulder. “I’ve told Mother Schalk that Idon’t believe it will do any good.”Oba didn’t think so, either, because he didn’t really believe there was anythingneeding curing. When he had been little, he thought that his mother knew best,and wouldn’t give him the cure if he didn’t need it, but he had since come todoubt that. She no longer seemed to him as smart as he had once believed her tobe.“She must care about me, though. She keeps trying.”“Maybe she’s hoping that the cure might rid her of you,” Lathea said, almostabsently, as she worked.Oba.Oba’s head come up. He stared at the sorceress’s back. He had never consideredsuch a thought. Maybe Lathea was hoping that the cure would rid them both of thebastard boy. His mother sometimes went to see Lathea. Maybe they had discussedit.Had he ignorantly believed the two women were trying to do good for him, to helphim, when the opposite was actually true? Maybe both women had hatched a plan.Maybe they had been conniving all along to poison him.If something happened to him, his mother would no longer have to help supporthim. She often complained about how much he ate. Time and again she told himthat she worked more to feed him than herself, and that because of him she couldnever put any money away. Maybe if she had instead put away the money she’dspent on his cures over the years, she’d have a comfortable nest egg by now.But if something happened to him, his mother would have to do all the work.Maybe both women just wanted to do it out of simple meanness.Maybe they hadn’t thought it all through, as Oba would. His mother oftensurprised him with her simple-mindedness. Maybe both women had been sittingaround one day and had just decided to be mean.Oba watched the flickering light play over the thin strands of the sorceress’sstraight hair. “Today Mama said that she should have done what you always toldher to do, from the beginning.”Lathea, pouring thick brown liquid into the jar, glanced back over her shoulderagain. “Did she, now?”Oba.“What did you say from the beginning that Mama should do?”“Isn’t it obvious?”Oba.Icy realization prickled his flesh.“You mean that she should have killed me.”He had never before come out and said anything so bold. He had never once in anyway dared to confront the sorceress-he feared her too much. But, this time, thewords had just come into his mind, much like the voice did, and he had spokenthem before he had time to consider whether or not it was wise to do so.He had surprised Lathea even more than he had surprised himself. She hesitatedat her bottles, watching him as if he had changed before her very eyes. Maybe hehad.He realized then that he liked the way it felt to speak his mind.He had never before seen Lathea falter. Maybe it was because she felt safedancing around the subject, safe in the shadows of the words, without havingthem brought out into the light of day.“That what you always wanted her to do, Lathea? That it? Kill her bastard boy?”A smile pushed its way onto her thin face. “It wasn’t like you make it sound,Oba.” All the low, slow, haughty intonation had evaporated from her voice. “Notat all.” She addressed him more like a man than she ever had before, rather thanan evil bastard boy she tolerated. She sounded almost sweet. “Women aresometimes better off without a newborn babe. It isn’t so bad, when the babe isnewborn. They’re not such a ... such a person, yet. “Oba. Surrender.“You mean, it would be easier.”“That’s right,” she said, eagerly latching on to his words. “It would be easier.“His own voice slowed and took on an edge that he didn’t know had been in him.“You mean it would be easier ... before they got big enough to fight back.”The range of his latent talents amazed him. It was a night of new wonders.“No, no, that’s not at all what I mean.” But he thought it was. Her voice,reflecting a fresh respect for him, quickened, became almost urgent. “I onlymean that it’s easier before a woman comes to love her child. You know, beforethe child comes to be a person. A real person, with a mind. It’s easier, then,and sometimes it’s best for the mother.”Oba was learning something new, but he hadn’t put it all together, yet. Hesensed that all his new learning was profoundly important, that he was on thecusp of true understanding.“How could it be best?”Lathea stopped pouring the liquid and set the bottle down. “Well, sometimes it’sa hardship to have a new baby. A hardship on both. It’s best for both, really,sometimes ......She walked briskly to the cabinet. When she returned with a new bottle, shestepped around to the other side of the table so her back was no longer to him.Most of the ingredients for his cures were powders or liquids and he didn’t knowwhat they were. The bottle she brought back contained one of the few things herecognized, the dried base of mountain fever roses. They looked like brown,shriveled little circles with stars in the centers. She often added one to hiscure. This time, she poured a pile in her cupped hand, made a fist to crushthem, and dumped the fine brown crumbles in the cure she was mixing.“Best, for both?” Oba asked.Her fingers seemed to be looking for something to do. “Yes, sometimes.” Sheseemed like she didn’t want to talk about it anymore, but couldn’t find a way tomake it end. “Sometimes it’s more of a hardship than a woman can endure, that’sall-a hardship that only endangers her and the rest of her children.”“But Mama had no other children.”Lathea went silent for a moment.Oba. Surrender.He listened to the voice, the voice that had become somehow different. Somehowvastly more important.“No, but all the same you was a hardship on her. It’s difficult for a woman toraise a child by herself. Especially a child-” She caught herself, then startedover. “I only meant that it would be hard.”“But she did it. I guess you were wrong. Isn’t that so, Lathea? You were wrong.Not Mama-you. Mama wanted me.”“And she never married,” Lathea snapped. Her flash of anger had put the flame ofhaughty authority back in her eyes. “Maybe if she ... maybe if she’d married shewould have had a chance to have a whole family, instead of only . . .”“A bastard boy?”Lathea didn’t answer this time. She seemed to regret having taken a stand. Thespark of anger left her eyes. With slightly trembling fingers, she dumpedanother pile of the dried flower buds in her palm, hurriedly crushed them in herfist, and dumped them in the cure. She turned and busied herself studying theflames in the hearth through a liquid in a blue glass bottle.Oba took a step toward the table. Her head came up, her eyes turning to his.“Dear Creator she whispered as she looked into his eyes. He realized she was notspeaking to him, but to herself. “Sometimes, when I look into those blue eyes, Ican see him . .Oba’s brow drew down above his glare.The bottle slipped from her hand, thumped on the table, and rolled to the floor,where it shattered.Oba. Surrender. Surrender your will.This was new. The voice had never before said that.“You wanted Mama to kill me, didn’t you, Lathea?”He took another step toward the table.Lathea stiffened. “Stay where you are, Oba.”There was fear in her eyes. Little rat eyes. This was definitely new. He waslearning new things almost faster than he could note them all.He saw her hands, the weapons of a sorceress, lifting. Oba paused. He stoodcautiously, at attention.Surrender, Oba, and you will be invincible.This was not merely new, it was startling.“I think you want to kill me with your ‘cures,’ don’t you, Lathea? You want medead.”“No. No, Oba. That isn’t true. I swear it isn’t.”He took another step, testing what the voice promised.Her hands rose, a glow of light coming to life around her clawed fingers. Thesorceress was conjuring magic.“Oba”-her voice was more forceful, more sure-”stay where you are, now.”Surrender, Oba, and you will be invincible.Oba felt his thighs bump the table as he advanced. The jars rattled and clankedtogether. One of them wobbled. Lathea watched it teeter and almost right itself,only to topple and spill its thick red liquid.Lathea’s face abruptly twisted with hatred, with rage, with effort. She cast herclawed hands forward, toward him, cast the full force of her power at him.With a thunderous clap, light ignited, the flash making everything in the roomgo white for an instant.He saw a flare of a yellow-white light knife through the air toward him-deadlylightning sent to kill.Oba felt nothing.Behind him, the light blasted a man-sized hole through the wooden wall,scattering flaming splinters out into the night. All the fire fizzled out in thesnow.Oba touched his chest where the full force of her power had been directed. Noblood. No torn flesh. He was unharmed.He thought that Lathea was even more surprised about it than he. Her mouth hungopen in astonishment. Her wide eyes stared.All his life he had feared this scarecrow.Lathea quickly recovered, and again her face twisted with effort as she drew herhands up. This time an eerie blue hiss of light formed. The air smelled likeburning hair. Lathea turned her palms up, sending forth her deadly magic,sending him death. Power no person could withstand shrieked toward him.The blue light scorched the walls behind, but again he felt nothing. Obagrinned.Again, Lathea wheeled her arms, but this time she also whispered a chant ofclipped words he could not understand-rattling off a menace of magic. A columnof light bloomed, undulating in the air before him, a viper of extraordinarymight. Beyond doubt, it was meant to kill.Oba lifted his hands to feel the snaking rope of crackling death she hadspawned. He ran his fingers through it, but could feel nothing. It was likelooking at something in a different world. There, but not.It was as if he were ... invincible.With a howl of outrage, her hands came up again.Quick as thought, Oba seized her by the throat.“Oba!” she screeched. “Oba, no! Please!”This was new. He had never before heard Lathea say please.With her neck in his meaty grip, he dragged her across the table toward him.Bottles scattered, tumbling to the floor. Some thudded and rolled, some brokelike eggs.Oba closed a fist on Lathea’s stringy hair. She clawed at him, desperatelycalling upon her talents. She spoke words that had to be a mystical entreaty tomagic, to her gift, to her sorceress power. While he didn’t recognize the words,he understood their lethal intent.Oba had surrendered, though, and he had become invincible.He had watched her unleash her rage; now he unleashed his.He slammed her up against her cabinet. Her mouth grew wide with a silent scream.“Why did you want Mama to get rid of me?”Her eyes, big and round, were fixed on the object of her terror: Oba. All hislife, she had delighted in terrifying others. Now all that terror had returnedto haunt her.“Why did you want Mama to get rid of me?”A series of small panting cries were her only answer.“Why! Why!”Oba ripped her dress from her body. Coins spilled from the pocket, rainingacross the floor.“Why!”He clutched the white shift she wore underneath the dress.“Why!”She tried to hold the shift to herself, but he stripped it away, sending hertumbling across the floor, bony arms and legs sprawling. Her wasted breasts hunglike shriveled udders. This powerful sorceress was now naked before him, and shewas nothing.Her cries, full and round, came to life at last. Teeth gritted, he snatched herby the hair and hauled her to her feet. Oba rammed her against the cabinet. Woodsplintered. Bottles cascaded out. He seized a bottle as it rolled out and brokeit against the cabinet.“Why, Lathea?” He brought the neck of a broken bottle up against her body.“Why!” She shrieked all the louder. He twisted it against her soft middle.“Why?”“Please ... A dear Creator ... please, no.”“Why, Lathea?”“Because,” she wailed, “you are the bastard son of that monster, Darken RAHL’Oba hesitated. This was stunning news-if it was true.“Mama was forced. She told me so. She said it was some man she didn’t know whofathered me.”“Oh, she knew him she did. She worked at the palace when she was younger. Yourmother had big breasts and bigger ideas, back then. Poorly conceived ideas. Shewasn’t smart enough to realize that she was no more than a night’s diversion fora man with a limitless supply of women, those eager, like her, and those not.”This was definitely something new. Darken Rahl had been the most powerful man inthe world. Could that noble Rahl blood flow in his veins? The heady implicationsmade his head swim.If the sorceress was telling the truth.“My mother would have stayed there at the People’s Palace if she carried DarkenRahl’s son.”“You aren’t his gifted heir.”“But still, if I was his son-”Despite her pain, she managed to give him that smile that said he was but dirtto her. “You are not gifted. Your kind were vermin to him. He ruthlesslyexterminated all he discovered. He would have tortured you and your mother todeath if he knew of you. Once she learned this, your mother fled.”Oba was overwhelmed with new things. They were beginning to become a jumble inhis mind.He pulled the sorceress close. “Darken Rahl was a powerful wizard. If what yousay is true, he would have hunted us.” He slammed her against the cabinet again.“He would have hunted me!” He shook her to elicit an answer. “He would have!”“He did, but he could not see the holes in the world.”Her eyes were rolling. Her frail body was no match for Oba’s strength. Blood ranfrom her right ear.“What?” Oba reasoned that Lathea was babbling nonsense now.“Only Althea can. . . “She had ceased to make sense. He wondered how much of what she had said wastrue.Her head lolled to the side. “I should have ... saved us all ... when I had thechance. Althea was wrong . . .”He shook her, trying to get her to say more. Red froth bubbled from her nose.Despite his yelling, his demanding, his shaking her, no more words came. He heldher close, his heavy, hot breath lifting thin strands of her hair as he glaredinto her aimless eyes.He had learned all he would from her.He remembered all the burning powder he’d had to drink, the potions she hadmixed for him, the days he’d spent in the pen. He remembered all the times he’dvomited his guts out and it still wouldn’t stop burning his insides.Oba growled as he lifted the bony woman. With a roar of anger he slammed heragainst the wall. Her cries were fuel for the fire of his vengeance. He reveledin her helpless agony.He smashed her down against the heavy trestle table, breaking it, and breakingher. With each crash, she became more limp, bloody, incoherent.But Oba had only just begun to rage at her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10Jennsen didn’t want to go back to the inn, but it was dark and cold and shedidn’t know what else to do. It was disheartening that Lathea wouldn’t answertheir questions. Jennsen had pinned her hopes on the woman’s help.“What shall we do tomorrow?” Sebastian asked.“Tomorrow?”“Well, do you still want me to help you leave D’Hara, as you and your motherasked of me?”She hadn’t really thought it out. In view of what little Lathea had told her,Jennsen wasn’t sure what to do. She stared absently out into the empty night asthey trudged across the crusted snow.“If we went to the People’s Palace, I would have some answers,” she said,thinking out loud. “And, hopefully, Althea’s help.”Going to the People’s Palace was by far the most dangerous alternative. But nomatter where she ran, where she hid, Lord Rahl’s magic would haunt her. Altheamight be able to help. Maybe, somehow, she would be able to conceal Jennsen fromhim so she could have her own life.He seemed to give her words serious thought, a long cloud of his breath trailingaway in the wind. “We’ll go to the People’s Palace, then. Find this Altheawoman.”She felt somehow uneasy when she realized that he wasn’t offering any argument,or trying to talk her out of it. “The People’s Palace is the heart of D’Hara.It’s not just the heart of D’Hara, but the home of the Lord Rahl.”“Then he wouldn’t be likely to expect you to go there, would he?”Expected or not, they would still be walking into the enemy’s lair. No predatorlong neglected to notice the prey in his midst. They would be naked before hisfangs.Jennsen glanced over at the shadowed shape walking beside her. “Sebastian, whatare you doing in D’Hara? You seem to have no love for the place. Why would youtravel to a place you don’t like?”Beneath his hood, she saw his smile. “Am I that obvious?”Jennsen shrugged. “I’ve met travelers before. They talk about places they’vebeen, sights they’ve seen. Wonders. Beautiful valleys. Breathtaking mountains.Fascinating cities. You don’t speak of anywhere you’ve been, or anything you’veseen.”“You want the truth?” he asked, his expression now serious.Jennsen looked away. She suddenly felt awkward, nosy-especially in light of whatshe wasn’t telling him.“I’m sorry. I have no right to ask such a thing. Forget I mentioned it.”“I don’t mind.” He looked over at her with a wry smile. “I don’t think you wouldbe one to report me to D’Haran soldiers.”She was appalled at the very idea. “Of course not.”“Lord Rahl and his D’Haran Empire wish to rule the world. I’m trying to helpprevent that. I’m from south of D’Hara, as I told you before. I was sent by ourleader, the emperor of the Old World, Jagang the Just. I am Emperor Jagang’sstrategist.”“Then you’re someone of high authority,” she whispered in astonishment. “A manof high rank.” The astonishment quickly transformed to tingling intimidation.She feared to guess at his importance, his rank. In her mind it rose by themoment, notch by notch. “How am I to address one such as you?”“As Sebastian.”“But, you’re an important man. I’m a nobody.”“Oh, you’re somebody, Jennsen Daggett. The Lord Rahl himself does not huntnobodies.”Jennsen felt an odd and unexpected sense of uneasiness. She harbored no love forD’Hara, of course, but she still felt somewhat uncomfortable to know thatSebastian was there to help bring about the defeat of her land.The twinge of loyalty confused her. After all, the Lord Rahl had sent the menwho had murdered her mother. The Lord Rahl hunted Jennsen, wanted her dead.But it was the Lord Rahl who wanted her dead, not necessarily the people of herland. The mountains, the rivers, the vast plains, the trees and plant life hadalways all sheltered and nurtured her. She’d never really thought it through inthat way before-that she could love her homeland, yet hate those who ruled it.If this Jagang the Just succeeded, though, she would be freed from her pursuer.If D’Hara was defeated, Lord Rahl would be defeated-the rule of evil men wouldbe ended. She would at last be free to live her own life.In light of how open he was with her, she also felt foolish, even ashamed, fornot telling Sebastian who she was and why Lord Rahl hunted her. She didn’t knowit all, herself, but she knew enough to know that Sebastian would share the samefate as she if they caught him with her.As she thought about it, it began to make sense why he might not object to goingto the People’s Palace, why he might be willing to risk such a dangerousjourney. As a strategist for the emperor Jagang, perhaps Sebastian would likenothing better than to sneak a look into the enemy’s lair.“Here we are,” he said.She looked up and saw the white clapboard face of the inn. A metal mug hangingfrom a bracket overhead squeaked as it swung to and fro in the wind. The soundsof singing and dancing spilled out onto the snow-covered silence of the night.With an arm around her shoulders, Sebastian sheltered her as they made their waythrough the great room, shielded her from the prying eyes, and led her to thestairs at the far side. If possible, the place was even more crowded and noisythan before.Without pause, the two of them quickly ascended the stairs. Partway down the dimhall, he unlocked a door to the right. Inside, Sebastian turned the wick up onthe oil lamp sitting on a small table. Alongside the lamp was a pitcher andwashbasin and near the table a bench. Looming to the side of the room sat a highbed covered crookedly with a dark brown blanket.The room was better than the home she had left, but Jennsen didn’t like it. Onewall was overlaid with drab, painted linen. The plastered walls were stained andflyblown. Since the room was on the second floor, the only way down was backthrough the inn. She hated the stink of the room-a sour mixture of pipe smokeand urine. The chamber pot beneath the bed hadn’t been emptied.As Jennsen pulled a few things from her pack and went to the table to wash herface, Sebastian left her to it and went back downstairs. By the time she hadfinished washing and had brushed her hair, he returned with two bowls of lambstew. He had brown bread, too, and mugs of ale. They ate sitting close togetheron the short bench, hunched over the table, close to the wavering light of theoil lamp.The stew didn’t taste as good as it looked. She picked out the chunks of meatbut left the colorless, tasteless, soft vegetables. She sopped up some of thejuice with the hard bread. She gave her ale to Sebastian and drank waterinstead. She wasn’t used to drinking ale. To her the ale smelled as unpleasantas the lamp oil. Sebastian seemed to like it.When she had finished eating, Jennsen paced in the confining room the way Bettypaced in her pen. Sebastian threw a leg to each side of the bench and leanedback against the wall. His blue eyes followed her from the bed to the wall hungwith linen and back again, as she began wearing a path in the plank floor.“Why don’t you lie down and get some sleep,” he said in a soft voice. “I’llwatch over you.”She felt like a trapped animal. She watched him take a long draft of ale fromhis mug. “And what will we do tomorrow?”It wasn’t only her dislike of the inn, of the room. Her conscience was eating ather. She didn’t let him answer.“Sebastian, I have to tell you who I am. You were honest with me. I can’t staywith you and endanger your mission. I don’t know anything about the importantthings you do, but being with me will only put you at great risk. You’ve alreadyhelped me more than I could have hoped, more than I ever could have asked.”“Jennsen, I’m already at risk being here. I am in the land of my enemy.”“And you’re someone of high rank. An important man.” She rubbed her handstogether, trying to bring some warmth to her icy fingers. “If they captured youbecause you were with me ... well, I couldn’t bear it.”“I took the risk of coming here.”“But I haven’t been honest with you-I haven’t lied to you, but I haven’t toldyou what I should have long ago. You’re too important a man to chance being withme when you don’t even know why I’m hunted, or what that attack back at my housewas about.” She swallowed at the painful lump in her throat. “Why my mother losther life.”He said nothing, but simply gave her the time to gather herself and tell him inher own way. From the first moment she had met him, and he hadn’t come closewhen she had been afraid, he always gave her the room she needed in order tofeel safe. He deserved more than she gave him in return.Jennsen finally brought a halt to her pacing and looked down at him, at his blueeyes, blue eyes like hers, like her father’s.“Sebastian, Lord Rahl-the last Lord Rahl, Darken Rahl-was my father.”He took the news without any outward reaction. She couldn’t know what he wasthinking. As he gazed up at her, as calmly as he did when she wasn’t telling himterrible news, she felt safe in his company.“My mother worked at the People’s Palace. She was part of the palace staff.Darken Rahl ... he noticed her. It is the Lord Rahl’s prerogative to have anywoman he wants.”“Jennsen, you don’t-”She lifted a hand, silencing him. She wanted the whole thing out before she losther nerve. Having always been with her mother, she feared being alone now. Shefeared he would abandon her, but she had to tell him what she knew.“She was fourteen,” Jennsen said, beginning the story as calmly as she could.“Too young to really understand about the ways of the world, of men. You saw howbeautiful she was. At that young age, she was already pretty as could be,growing into a woman sooner than many her age. She had a bright smile and aninnocent exuberance for life.“She was a nobody, though, and to an extent excited to be noticed, desired, by aman of such power, a man who could have any woman he wanted. That was foolish,of course, but at her age and station it was flattering, and, in her innocence,I suppose it might have even seemed glamorous.“She was bathed and pampered by older women on the palace staff. Her hair doneup like a real lady. She was dressed in a beautiful gown for her meeting withthe great man himself. When she was brought to him, he bowed and gently kissedthe back of her hand-her, a servant in his great palace, and he kissed her hand.From all accounts, he was so handsome that he shamed the finest marble statues.“She had dinner with him, in a great hall, and ate rare and exotic foods,he hadnever tasted before. Just the two of them at a long dining table with peopleserving her for the first time in her life.“He was charming. He complemented her on her beauty, her grace. He poured winefor her-the Lord Rahl himself.“When she was at last alone with him, she was confronted with the reality of whyshe was there. She was too frightened to resist. Of course, had she not meeklysubmitted, he would have done what he wished anyway. Darken Rahl was a powerfulwizard. He was easily as cruel as he was charming. He could have handled anywoman without the slightest difficulty. He had but to command it, and those whoresisted his will were tortured to death.“But she never gave any thought to resisting. For a brief time, despite herapprehension, that world, at the center of such splendor, such power, hadprobably seemed exciting. When it turned to terror for her, she bore itsilently.“It wasn’t rape in the meaning of being taken against her will, with a knifeheld to her throat, but it was a crime nonetheless. A savage crime.”Jennsen looked away from Sebastian’s blue eyes. “He took my mother to his bedfor a period of time before he tired of her and moved on to other women. Therewere as many women as he could want. Even at that age, my mother didn’t hold anyfoolish illusion that she meant something to him. She knew he was simply takingwhat he wanted, for as long as he wanted, and that when he was finished with hershe would soon be forgotten. She was doing as a servant did. A flatteredservant, perhaps, but still a frightened, innocent young servant who knew betterthan to resist a man above any law but his own.”She couldn’t bear to look at Sebastian. In a small voice, she added the last bitto the tale.“I was the result of that brief ordeal in her life, and the beginning of a fargreater one.”Jennsen had never before told anyone the awful story, the terrible truth. Shefelt cold and dirty. She felt sick. Most of all, she felt deep anguish for whather mother must have gone through, for her young life spoiled.Her mother never told the story all out as Jennsen had just done. Jennsen hadpieced snippets and snatches of it together over her whole life, until it wasfinally a whole picture in her mind. She wasn’t telling Sebastian all thesnippets, either-the true extent of the horror of the way her mother had beentreated by Darken Rahl. Jennsen felt burning shame that she had to be born toremind her mother every day of that terrible memory she could never tell inwhole.When Jennsen looked up through tears, Sebastian was standing close before her.His fingertips gently touched the side of her face. It was as tender a thing asshe had ever felt.Jennsen wiped the tears from under her eyes. “The women and their children meannothing to him. The Lord Rahl eliminates all those offspring who are not gifted.Since he takes many women, children of these couplings are not uncommon. Hecovets only one, his heir, the single child born of his seed who carries thegift.”“Richard Rahl,” Sebastian said.“Richard Rahl,” she confirmed. “My half brother.”Richard Rahl, her half brother, who hunted her as his father before him hadhunted her. Richard Rahl, her half brother, who sent the quads to kill her.Richard Rahl, her half brother, who had sent the quads that had murdered hermother.But why? She could have been no threat to Darken Rahl, and even less of a threatto the new Lord Rahl. He was a powerful wizard who commanded armies, legions ofthe gifted, and countless other loyal supporters. And she? She was nothing butone lone woman who knew few people and wanted only to live her own simple lifein peace. She was hardly a threat to his rule.Even the truth of her story would not so much as raise an eyebrow. Everyone knewthat any Lord Rahl lived by his own laws. No one was even remotely likely todisbelieve her story, but no one would really care, either. At most, they mightwink or give one another a knowing elbow at the lives of powerful men, andDarken Rahl had been the most powerful man alive.Jennsen’s whole life seemed suddenly to come down to that central question: Whywould her father, a man she never knew, have wanted so desperately to kill her?And why would his son, Richard Rahl, her own half brother and now the Lord Rahl,also be so intent on killing her? It made no sense.What could she possibly do that could harm either of them? What threat could shepossibly constitute to such power?Jennsen checked that the knife at her belt-her knife displaying the emblem ofthe House of Rahl-was secure. She lifted the blade to be sure it was free in itsscabbard. The steel made a pleasing metallic click as she pushed it home. Shescooped her cloak off the bed and threw it around her shoulders.Sebastian swiped a hand back across his white spikes of hair as he watched herquickly tie the cloak shut. “What do you think you’re doing?”“I’ll be back in a while. I’m going out.”He reached for his weapons and cloak. “All right, I’ll-”“No. Leave me to it, Sebastian. You’ve put yourself at risk enough on my behalf.I wish to go alone. I’ll be back when I’ve finished.”“Finished what?”She hurried to the door. “What I have to do.”He stood in the center of the room, fists at his sides, apparently hesitant togo against her explicit wishes. Jennsen quickly pulled the door shut tightbehind herself, closing off her view of him. She took the steps two at a time,intent on being quickly out of the inn and gone before he changed his mind andfollowed.The crowd downstairs was as rowdy as they had been before. She ignored the men,their gambling, their dancing, their laughter, and headed for the door. Beforeshe made it, though, a bearded man hooked his arm around her middle and jerkedher back into the press of people. She let out a small cry that was lost in thegale of revelry. Her left arm was pinned against her waist. He swung her around,catching her right hand, dancing her across the floor.Jennsen tried to reach up to pull back her hood, to free her red hair in orderto give him a scare, but she couldn’t liberate her arm. He held her other handin an iron grip. Not only could she not free her hair, she couldn’t reach herknife to defend herself. Her breath came in a frightened pant.The man laughed with his fellows, and swirled her to the music, holding hertight lest he lose his dance with her. His eyes shown with merriment, notmenace, but she knew that was only because she had not yet forcefully resisted.She knew that when he discovered that she was unwilling, his pleasant demeanorwas sure to change.He released her waist and spun her around. With only one hand still entrapped inhis callused fingers, she hoped yet to break the hold. With her left hand, shefumbled for her knife, but it was under her cloak, and not handy to her offhand. The crowd clapped in time with the tune of the pipes and drums. As sheturned and stepped away, another man caught her up around the waist, bumpingagainst her hard enough to knock the wind from her in a grunt. He captured herhand away from the first fellow. She had wasted her chance to pull back her hoodby trying for her knife instead.She found herself adrift in a sea of men. The few other women, serving girlsmostly, were either willing or laughed and were able to alight briefly, and thenmove away, like bugs that were able to walk on water. Jennsen didn’t know howthey performed the trick; she was in danger of drowning among waves of men whopassed her along from one to another.When she caught sight of the door, she yanked away suddenly, breaking the holdof the latest man to have her in his grip. He hadn’t been expecting her tosuddenly break free. The men all laughed at the fellow who had lost hold of her.His merriment, as she had expected, died. The rest of the men were moregood-natured about it than she had expected, and sent up a cheer for her escape.Instead of showing anger, the man from whom she had escaped bowed. “Thank you,my beautiful lass, for the gracious dance. It was a kindness to a lumbering oldsoul such as me.”His grin returned and he winked at her before turning back to clap along withhis fellows in time to the music.Jennsen stood stunned, realizing that it had not been the danger she hadexpected. The men were having a good time, and not really intent on harm. Nonehad touched her in an unseemly manner, or even spoken any crude words to her.They had only smiled, laughed, and danced with her. Still, Jennsen made a quickline for the door.Before she went out, another arm caught her around the waist. Jennsen started tofight and pull away.“I didn’t know you liked to dance.”It was Sebastian. She relaxed, and let him usher her out of the inn.Out in the dark night, the cold air was a relief. She pulled a long breath,happy to be away from the unfamiliar smell of ale, pipe smoke, and sweaty men,happy to be away from the noise of so many people.“I told you to leave me to it,” she said.“Leave you to what?”“I’m going to Lathea’s place. Stay here, Sebastian. Please?”“If you tell me why you don’t want me to go.”She lifted a hand but let it flop back to her side. “Sebastian, you’re animportant man. I feel terrible about the danger you’ve already been in allbecause of me. This is my problem, not yours. My life is . . . I don’t know. Idon’t have a life. You do. I don’t want to get you all tangled up in my mess.”She started out across the crusty snow. “Just wait here.”He stuffed his hands in his pockets as he strode along beside her. -Jennsen, I’ma grown man. Don’t decide for me what I should be doing, all right?”She didn’t answer as she turned the corner down a deserted street.“Tell me why you want to go see Lathea, will you?”She stopped then at the side of the road, close to an uninhabited building notfar from the corner of the road that turned down to Lathea’s place.“Sebastian, my whole life I’ve been running. My mother spent the better part ofher life running from Darken Rahl, hiding me. She died running from his son,Richard Rahl. It was me Darken Rahl was after, me Darken Rahl wanted to kill,and now it’s Richard Rahl who is after me, who wants to kill me, and I don’tknow why.“I’m sick of it. My life is nothing but running, hiding, and being afraid. It’sall I do. All I think about. That’s all my life is-running from a man trying tokill me. Trying to stay a step ahead of him and stay alive.”He didn’t argue with her. “So, why do you want to go to the sorceress?”Jennsen pushed her hands under her cloak, under her arms, to warm them. Shegazed down toward the dark road to Lathea’s place, at the feathery canopy ofbare branches moving in the wind. Some of the limbs creaked and groaned as theyrubbed together.“I even ran from Lathea, earlier. I don’t know why Lord Rahl is chasing me, butshe does. I was afraid to insist she tell me. I was going to travel all the wayto the People’s Palace in order to find her sister, Althea, hoping that maybe asI stand meekly before her door she might deign to tell me, to help me.“What if she doesn’t? What if she, too, dismisses me? Then what? What greaterdanger could there be than for me to go there, to the People’s Palace? And forwhat? The hollow hope that someone will finally volunteer to stoop to help asolitary woman hunted by the mighty force of a nation led by the murderousbastard son of a monster?“Don’t you see? If I would stop taking ‘no’ for an answer, and insist Latheatell me, then maybe I could save a dangerous journey to the even more dangerousheart of D’Hara, and leave, instead. For the first time in my life, I could befree, then. But I was about to throw away that chance because I was afraid ofLathea, too. I’m sick to death of being afraid.”In the dim light, he stood considering their options.“So, let’s just leave. Let me take you away from D’Hara, if that’s what youwant.”“No. Not until I find out why Lord Rahl wants to kill me.”“Jennsen, what difference does it make if-”“No!” Her fists tightened. “Not until I find out first why my mother had todie!”She could feel bitter tears turning icy cold as they ran down her cheeks.Finally, Sebastian nodded. “I understand. Let’s go see Lathea. I’ll help you getan answer from her. Maybe then you’ll let me take you away from D’Hara, to whereyou will be safe.”She brushed back the tears. “Thank you, Sebastian. But, don’t you have some kindof job to do, here? I can’t let my problems get in your way any longer. This ismy trouble. You must live your own life.”He smiled then. “Our people’s spiritual guide, Brother Narev, says that our mostimportant job in this life is helping those who need help.”Such a sentiment lifted her spirits when she didn’t think they could be lifted.“He sounds like a wonderful man.”“He is.”“But you are still on a duty from your leader, Jagang the Just, aren’t you?”“Brother Narev is also a close friend and spiritual guide to Emperor Jagang.Both men would want me to help you, I know they would. After all, the Lord Rahlis our enemy, too. Lord Rahl has caused our people untold hardship. Both men,Brother Narev and Emperor Jagang, would insist I help you. That’s the truth ofit.”She was choked with emotion, and couldn’t speak. She let him put his arm aroundher waist and lead her down the road. Sharing the quiet darkness with him,Jennsen listened to the soft sound of their boots crunching through the hardcrust of snow.Lathea had to help her. Jennsen intended to see to it."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11Oba hated it to end, but he knew it had to. He would have to get home. Hismother would be angry if he stayed too long in town. Besides, he could wring nomore enjoyment out of Lathea. She had given him all the satisfaction she wasever going to give him.It had been fascinating, while it lasted. Boundlessly fascinating. And he hadlearned many new things. Animals simply did not provide the same kind ofsensations as those he had gotten from Lathea. True, watching a person die wasin many ways much like watching an animal die, but at the same time it was oh sovery different. Oba had learned that.Who knew what a rat was really thinking-or if rats could even think at all? Butpeople could think. You could see their mind through their eyes, and you knew.To know they were thinking real people thoughts, not some chicken-rabbit-ratthoughts-behind those human eyes, behind that look that said it all, wasintoxicating. Witnessing Lathea’s ordeal had been rapture. Especially as hewaited for that singular inspirational instant of ultimate anguish when her soulfled her human form, and the Keeper of the Dead received her into his eternalrealm.Animals did give him a thrill, though, even if they lacked that human element.There was tremendous enjoyment to be had in nailing an animal to a fence, or abarn wall, and skinning them while they were still alive. But he didn’t thinkthey had a soul. They just ... died.Lathea had died, too, but it had been a whole new experience.Lathea had made him grin like he had never grinned before.Oba unscrewed the top of the lamp, pulled out the woven wick, and dribbled lampoil across the floor, over the broken pieces of the trestle table, aroundLathea’s medicine cabinet lying facedown in the center of the room.As much as he knew he would enjoy it, he couldn’t just leave her there to bediscovered. There would be questions, if she was found like this. He glancedover at her. Especially if she was found like this.That idea did hold a certain fascination. He would enjoy listening to all thehysterical talk. He would love to hear people tell him all the macabre detailsof the monstrous death Lathea had suffered. The very idea of a man who couldhave taken the powerful sorceress out in such a grisly fashion would cause asensation. People would want to know who had done it. To some folk, he would bean avenging hero. People everywhere would be abuzz. As word spread aboutLathea’s ordeal and gruesome end, the gossip would heat to a fever pitch. Thatwould be fun.As he emptied the last of the lamp oil, he saw his knife, where he’d left it,beside the overturned cabinet. He tossed the empty lamp on the heap of ruin andbent to retrieve his knife. It was a mess. Couldn’t have an omelet withoutbreaking eggs, his mother always said. She said it a lot. In this case, Obathought her tired old saw fit.With one hand, he took Lathea’s favorite chair and tossed it into the center ofthe room, then began carefully cleaning his blade on the quilted throw from thechair. His knife was a valuable tool, and he kept it razor sharp. He wasrelieved to see the shine returning when the blood and slop was wiped off. He’dheard that magic could be troublesome in untold ways. Oba had briefly worriedthat the sorceress might be made up of some kind of dreadful acidsorceress-blood that once spilled would eat through steel.He looked around. No, just regular blood. Lots of it.Yes, the sensation this would create would be exciting.But, he didn’t like the idea of soldiers coming around to ask questions. Theywere a suspicious lot, soldiers. They would poke their noses into it, sure ascows gave milk. They would spoil everything with their suspicion and questions.He didn’t think that soldiers appreciated omelets.No, best if Lathea’s house burned down. That wouldn’t provide nearly theenjoyment that all the conversation and scandal would, but it also wouldn’t beso suspicious. People’s houses burned down all the time-especially in winter.Logs rolled out of fireplaces, spilling flaming coals; sparks shot into curtainsand set homes ablaze; candles melted down and fell. catching things on fire.Happened all the time. Not really suspicious, a fire in the dead of winter. Withall the lightning and sparks the sorceress sent flying willy-nilly, it was awonder the place hadn’t already burned down. The woman was a menace.Of course, someone might notice the blaze way down at the end of the road, butby then it would be too late. By then the fire would be too hot for anyone to beable to come near the place. Tomorrow, if no one found the place ablaze, therewould be nothing but ashes.He let out a sad sigh for the stillborn gossip, for what might have been, if notfor the tragic fire that would be blamed for Lathea’s end.Oba knew about fires. Over the years, several of his homes had burned down.Their animals had been burned alive. That was back when they had lived in othertowns, before they moved to the place where they lived now.Oba liked to watch a place burn, liked to hear the animals scream. He liked itwhen people came running, all in a panic. They always seemed puny in the face ofwhat he created. People were afraid when there was a fire. The uproar caused bya burning building always swelled him with a sense of power.Sometimes, as they yelled for more help, men would throw buckets of water on thefire or beat at the roaring flames with blankets, but that never stopped a fireOba had started. He wasn’t slipshod. He always did good work. He knew what hewas doing.Finally finished cleaning and polishing his knife, he threw the bloody quiltedthrow on the oil-soaked wood beside the overturned cabinet.What was left of Lathea was nailed to the back of the cabinet that lay facedownon the floor. She stared at the ceiling.Oba grinned. Soon, there would be no ceiling for her to stare up at. His grinwidened. And no eyes to stare with.Oba saw a glint of light on the floor beside the cabinet. He bent and recoveredthe small object. It was a gold coin. Oba had never seen a gold mark before thatnight. It must have fallen from the pocket of Lathea’s dress, along with theothers. He slipped the gold coin into his own pocket, where he’d put the rest hehad collected from the floor. He’d also found a fat purse under her sleepingpallet.Lathea had made him rich. Who knew that the sorceress had been so wealthy? Someof that money, earned by his mother from her spinning and used for his hatedcures, had at last returned to Oba. Justice, finally done.As Oba started for the fireplace, he heard the soft but unmistakable crunch offootsteps in the snow outside. He froze in midstride.The footsteps were coming closer. They were approaching the door to Lathea’shouse.Who would be coming to Lathea’s place this late at night? That was just plaininconsiderate. Couldn’t they wait until morning for their cures? Couldn’t theylet the poor woman get her rest? Some people only thought of themselves.Oba snatched up the poker leaning against the fireplace and quickly spilled theburning oak logs out of the hearth and across the oil-soaked floor. The oil, thesplintered wood, the bedsheets, and the quilted throw caught flame with a woosh.Dense white smoke swirled up around Lathea’s pyre.Quick as a fox, Oba scurried out the hole that the troublesome sorceress hadconveniently blown through the back wall when she had tried to kill him with hermagic.She didn’t know that he had become invincible.Jennsen was pulled up short when Sebastian caught her by the arm. She turned tosee his face in the dim light coming from the only window. That orange glowdanced in his eyes. She knew immediately by his serious expression that sheshould remain silent.Sebastian noiselessly drew his sword as he slipped past her on his way to thedoor. In that smooth, practiced movement, she saw a professional, a man familiarwith such business.He leaned to the side, trying for a look through the window without having tostep into the deep snow below it. He turned back and whispered.“Fire!”Jennsen rushed to him. “Hurry. She might be asleep. We have to warn her. “Sebastian considered for only an instant, then burst through the door. Jennsenwas right on his heels. She had difficulty making sense of what she saw inside.The place was washed in whirling orange light that cast monstrous shadows up thewalls. In that wavering light, everything seemed surreal, out of scale, and outof place.When she spotted the debris in the center of the room, it became only too real.She saw a woman’s open hand sticking out beyond the top of what looked to be atall wooden cabinet that had fallen. Jennsen drew a choking gasp of smoke andthe smell of lamp oil. Thinking that maybe &e cabinet had toppled and hurt theold sorceress, Jennsen rushed to help.As she raced around the foot of the splintered chest, she caught the full viewof what was left of Lathea.The shock of it stiffened her. She couldn’t move, couldn’t blink her, wide eyes.She gagged on the sickly stench of butchery and blood. As Jennsen stared, heranguished cry was lost in the leaping roar of flames and crackle of burningwood.Sebastian briefly took in the remains of Lathea nailed to the back of thecabinet, only one detail of many as his gaze scanned the room. By his calculatedmovements, she surmised that he had seen such things enough that the humanelement no longer arrested his attention as it did hers.Jennsen.Jennsen’s fingers tightened around the hilt of her knife. She could feel theornately worked ridges of metal pressing against her palm, the worked metalpeaks and whorls that made up the letter “R.” As she gasped her breath past thenausea welling up inside, she pulled the blade free.Surrender.“They’ve been here,” she whispered. “The D’Haran soldiers have been here. “What she detected in his eyes was more like surprise, or confusion, thananything else.He frowned as he glanced around again. “Do you really think so?”Jennsen.She ignored the echo of the dead voice in her head and thought back to the manthey had met out on the road after they had come to see the sorceress the firsttime. He was big, blond, and good-looking, like most D’Haran soldiers. Shehadn’t thought at the time that he was a soldier. Could he have been one,though?No, if anything, he had seemed more intimidated by them than they were of him.Soldiers didn’t behave the way that man had.“Who else? We didn’t see all of them, before. It had to be the rest of the quadfrom back at my house. When we escaped out the back way, they must have somehowfollowed us.”He was still peering about as the flames grew, now licking at the ceiling. “Iguess you could be right.”Surrender.“Sebastian, we have to get out of here, now, or we’ll be next.” Jennsen clutchedthe cloak at his shoulder, pulling him away. “They may be near-right now.”“But, how could they know?”“Dear spirits, Lord Rahl is a wizard! How does he do anything he does? How didhe find my house?”Sebastian was still looking, prodding at the rubble with his sword. Jennsentugged again at his cloak, urging him toward the open door.“Your house . . . “ he said, frowning. “ Yes, I see what you mean.“We have to get out of here before they catch us!”He nodded, reassuring her. “Where do you want to go?”They both watched the dark doorway over their shoulders as well as the growingconflagration to their other side.“We’ve no choice, now,” Jennsen said. “Lathea was our only hope to find ananswer. We have to go to the People’s Palace, now. Find her sister, Althea.She’s the only one with any answers. She’s a sorceress, too, and the only onewho can see the holes in the world-whatever that means.”“Are you sure that’s what you want to do?”She thought about the voice. It sounded so cold and lifeless in her head. It hadsurprised her. She hadn’t heard it since her mother’s murder.“What other choice do we have, now? If I’m ever to know why Lord Rahl wants tokill me, why he murdered my mother, why I’m hunted, and maybe how to escape hisclutches for good, then I have to go find this woman, Althea. I have to!”He hurried with her through the door and out into the bitter night. “We bettergo back and get our things together. We can get an early start.”“With them this close, I fear to be trapped in the inn while we sleep. I havethe money from my mother. You have what you took from the men. We can buyhorses. We have to leave tonight and hope that no one saw us come here earlier,or again, now.”Sebastian sheathed his sword. His breath streamed out into the night as heconsidered their options.He glanced back through the door. “With the fire, at least there won’t be anyevidence of what happened here. We have that much going for us. No one saw uscome here earlier, so no one will have cause to ask us questions. No one willknow we were here again. They won’t have any reason to tell soldiers about us.”“As long as we get out of here before it’s discovered and everyone getssuspicious,” Jennsen said. “Before soldiers start asking about strangers intown. “He took her arm. “All right. Let’s be quick, then.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12Well, wasn’t this just something. Stranger and stranger. This night was full ofnew things, one right after another.From his hiding place just around the corner of the house, Oba had been able tohear much of the conversation between the two. At first, he had been sure theywould run off to get help. Oba didn’t think the fire could be extinguished, butfor a time he had been concerned, fearing that the man and woman might pullLathea out of the house-rescue her from the blaze so that people could have alook. It would be just like the troublesome sorceress to find a way to come backto torment him, and after all his work.But both the man and the woman wanted to leave Lathea to the fire. They, too,hoped the fire would cover the evidence of the sorceress’s true end. They almostsounded like thieves, the woman talking about taking money from her mother andhim taking money from men. That sounded suspicious.If they had found gold and silver there, they might have taken it. Had theyworked and slaved their whole lives, as he had, to finally recover money thatwas their due? Or had they been forced to suffer the abuse of swallowingLathea’s cursed cures their whole life? Oba didn’t think so. It had beendifferent for him. He had simply recovered money that was rightfully his allalong. He felt a little indignant to be almost in the company of common thieves.This night was just one startling thing after another. It seemed amazing to himhow his life had gone along, day after day, month after month, year after year,always the same, same chores, same work, same everything. Now, in one night, allthat seemed to have changed.First, he had become invincible and in so doing unleashed his righteous innerself, only to discover that Rahl blood coursed through his veins, and now thisodd pair showed up to help him conceal Lathea’s true end. Stranger and stranger.The startling news that he was in fact the son of Darken Rahl still had him in astate of astonished shock. He, Oba Schalk, as it turned out, was someone quiteimportant, someone of noble blood, someone of noble birth.He wondered whether or not he should now properly think of himself as Oba Rahl.He wondered if he was, in fact, a prince.That was an intriguing notion. Unfortunately, his mother had raised him simply,so he didn’t know much about such matters, what station or title was rightfullyhis.He also realized that his mother was a liar. She had hidden his true identityfrom her own son, her flesh and blood. Darken Rahl’s flesh and blood. She wasprobably resentful and envious and didn’t want Oba to know of his greatness.That would be just like her. She was always trying to beat him down. The bitch.The smoke coming through the open door no longer smelled of lamp oil. It nowcarried the aroma of roasting meat. Oba grinned as he peeked through the doorwayto see Lathea’s hand sticking above the cabinet, blackening in the flames,waving to him from the world of the dead.Sneaking across the snow to hide behind the fat trunk of an oak, Oba watched asthe couple hurried down the path, through the trees, toward the road. When theyhad passed out of sight, he followed in their tracks, staying hidden. He was apretty big man to hide behind a tree, but in the darkness it wasn’t difficult.He was puzzled, and troubled, by certain aspects of the encounter. He had beensurprised that the couple wouldn’t want to call for help, and instead ran away.The woman, especially, was eager to escape, thinking that because of Lathea’sdeath, someone was after them. A quad, she had said. That was part of whattroubled him.Oba had vaguely heard of quads before. Assassins of some sort. Assassins sent bythe Lord Rahl himself. Assassins sent after important people. Or people who wereespecially dangerous. Maybe that was it, they were dangerous people and notcommon thieves, after all.Oba had heard her name-Jennsen.But the thing that had really perked up his ears was that Lathea had a sisternamed Althea-yet another cursed sorceress-and Althea was the only one who couldsee the holes in the world. That was most troubling of all, because that was thevery same thing that Lathea had said to him. At the time, he had thought the oldsorceress was already conversing with the spirits in the world of the dead, ormaybe with the Keeper of the underworld himself, but as it turned out, she wasspeaking the truth.Somehow, this Jennsen woman and Oba were both what Lathea called holes in theworld. That sounded important. This Jennsen was somehow like him. They weresomehow connected. That fascinated him.He wished he had gotten a better look at her. The first meeting had been indarkness. The second time he saw her, just now, the fire had provided onlyenough light for a dim and shadowed view. As she had turned away, he only hadtime for a quick glimpse. From that fleeting look, he’d seen that she was aremarkably beautiful young woman.He paused behind a tree before making his way across the open snow toward theconcealment of a more distant tree. These people, like Jennsen, like Oba, whowere holes in the world, were important. Quads were sent after importantpeople-people who were especially dangerous to the Lord Rahl. Lathea had saidthat if he knew of Oba, the Lord Rahl would want to exterminate him.Oba didn’t know if he believed Lathea. She would be jealous of anyone moreimportant than herself. Still, he might be in some kind of danger without evenknowing it-hunted because he was an important man. That seemed prettyfar-fetched, but in view of all the other new things he had learned this night,he didn’t think it was entirely out of the question. An important man, a maninterested in learning new things, didn’t just dismiss such new informationwithout giving it due consideration.Oba was still trying to connect together all the things he had learned. It wasall very complicated-that much he did know. He had to take everything intoaccount if he was to put it all together.As he scurried to the next tree, he decided that it might be best if he went tothe inn and got a better look at Jennsen and Sebastian, the man with her. Hiseyes tracked them as they reached the road that headed back into town.Even though the couple kept looking around, it wasn’t difficult in such darknessfor Oba to follow them without being seen. Once they were back among thebuildings, it was even easier. From around the corner of one building, Oba sawthe light spill out into the road when they opened the door below a metal mugswinging in the wind. Laughter and music spilled out, too-like a celebration ofthe sorceress’s demise. Too bad everyone didn’t know that Oba was the hero whohad done away with the bane of all their lives. If people knew what he hadmanaged to accomplish, he would probably have all the free drinks he could want.He watched as Jennsen and Sebastian were swallowed inside. The door thuddedshut. The stillness of the winter night returned.Oba never got a chance to go to an inn for a drink. He never had any money. Hehad money, now. He had had a hard night, but he had emerged a new man. A richman. Wiping his nose on his jacket sleeve, he made for the door. It was time forhim to go to a cozy inn and have a drink. If anyone deserved one, it was ObaRahl.Jennsen suspiciously scanned the faces at the inn, looking for any that mightbetray murderous design. She still felt sick from the sight of what had beendone to Lathea. This night, there were monsters about. Men looked her way, butthe twinkle in their eyes seemed merry, not murderous. But how would she know,before it was too late?She ached to take the stairs two at a time.“Easy,” Sebastian whispered, apparently believing she was on the verge ofpanicked flight. Maybe she was. His grip on her arm tightened. “Let’s not makepeople suspicious.” They took the stairs one at a time, moving at a measuredpace, just a couple going to their room.In their room, Jennsen burst into motion, gathering the few items they hadremoved from their packs, replacing them, securing the straps and buckles. EvenSebastian, checking his weapons beneath his cloak, seemed unnerved by what hadhappened to Lathea. Jennsen made sure that her knife was free in its scabbard.“You sure you wouldn’t like to get some sleep? Lathea couldn’t have told themanything-she didn’t know we were staying here at the inn. It might be better tostart fresh at dawn.”She shot him a look as she shouldered her pack.“Right,” he said. He caught her arm. “Jennsen, slow down. If you run, peoplewill want to know why you’re running.”He was in enemy territory. He would know how to go about the business of notraising suspicion. Jennsen nodded.“What should I do?”“Just act like we’re going down for a drink, or to listen to the music. If youinsist on going directly out, walk. Don’t call attention to us by running. Maybewe’re just going to visit a friend or relative-who’s to say? But we don’t wantpeople to wonder if there’s something wrong. People forget normal. They rememberwhen things look wrong.”Abashed, she nodded again. “I guess I’m not very good at this. Close-up running,I mean. I’ve been running and hiding my whole life, but not like this, whenthey’re so close I can almost feel their breath on my neck.”He smiled that warm smile of his, the one that looked so good on him. “Youaren’t trained in this kind of thing. I wouldn’t expect you to know how to act.Even so, I don’t think I’ve ever met another woman who was as good as you areunder such pressure. You’re doing fine-you really are.”Jennsen felt a little better to know that she wasn’t acting like a completefool. He had a way about him that gave her confidence, put her at ease, made herable to do things she didn’t think she could. He let her decide on her own whatit was she wanted to do, and then he backed up her decision. Not many men woulddo that for a woman.Down the steps once again, for the last time, she could feel the door on theother side of the room, as if she were drowning and it was the only air. Peopleso close, brushing against her, still made her uneasy, made her feel thedesperate need for that air.She had learned earlier, though, that the men weren’t the threat she hadthought. She was somewhat humbled by how wrong she had been about them. Wherebefore she had seen thieves and cutthroats, she now saw farmers, craftsmen,laborers, joining together for company, companionship, and some harmlessrecreation.Still, there were killers somewhere close this night. After seeing Lathea, therecould be no doubt of that. Jennsen could never have imagined that anyone couldbe that perverted. She knew that if they caught her, they would eventually dothose kinds of things to her, too, before she was allowed to die.She felt her stomach roil with nausea at the vivid memory of what she had seen.She held back her tears, but she needed the air of outdoors and the solitude ofthe night.As she and Sebastian wound their way through the crowd and toward that air, shebumped into a big man as they crossed paths. Stopped by the human wall, shelooked up into the handsome face. She remembered him. He was the man they hadseen on the road to Lathea’s place, earlier.He lifted his cap in greeting. “Evening.” He grinned at her.“Good evening,” she said. She told herself to smile, and make it believable,normal. She wasn’t sure if she was doing a good job of it, but he seemed to findit convincing.He didn’t act as shy as she thought he had seemed before. Even the way hecarried himself, his movements, were more sure. Maybe it was just that her smilewas working as she had hoped.“You two look like you could use a drink.” When Jennsen frowned, not knowingwhat the man meant, he gestured at her face, and then at Sebastian. “Your nosesare red with the cold. May I buy you an ale on this chill night?”Before Sebastian could accept, which she feared he might, she said, “Thank you,no. We have to go ... to check on some business. But it was very kind of you tooffer.” She made herself smile again. “Thank you.”The way the man stared at her made her nervous. The thing was, she found herselfstaring back into his blue eyes just as intently, and she didn’t know why.Finally, she broke the gaze and, after a bow of her head to bid the big man agood night, made her way toward the door.“Something about him look familiar?” she whispered to Sebastian.“Yes. We saw him earlier, out on the streets, when we were on our way toLathea’s house.”She looked back over her shoulder, peering between the milling throng. “I guessmaybe that’s all it is, then.”Before she went out the door, the man, as if he sensed her looking at him,turned. When their eyes met, and he smiled, it was as if no one else existed foreither of them. His smile was polite, no more, but it made her go cold andtingly all over, the way the dead voice in her head sometimes did. There wassomething frightening familiar about the feeling she got looking at him, and theway he looked at her. Something about the look in his eyes reminded her of thevoice.It was as if she remembered him from a deep dream she had completely forgottenuntil that very instant. The sight of him, in her awake life, left her ...shaken.She was relieved to make it out into the empty night and be on their way. Shebundled her cloak’s hood close around her face, against the bitter wind, as theyhurried across the snow and down the street. Her thighs stung with the cold. Shewas glad the stable was not far, but she knew that would be only a briefrespite. It was going to be a long cold night, but there was no choice. LordRahl’s men were too close. They had to run.While Sebastian went to rouse the stableman, Jennsen squeezed through the barndoor. A lantern hanging from a beam provided enough light for her to make herway to the pen where Betty was tied up for the night. The shelter from the wind,along with the warm bodies of the horses and the sweet smell of hay and dustywood, made the stable a cozy haven.Betty bleated plaintively when she saw Jennsen, as if she feared she had beenabandoned for all time. Betty’s upright tail was a happy blur as Jennsen sank toone knee and hugged the goat’s neck. Jennsen stood and stroked her hand alongthe silken ears, a touch Betty mooned over. As the horse in the next stall puther head over the rail to watch her stablemate, Betty stood on her hind legs,joyful to be reunited with her lifelong friend and eager to be closer.Jennsen patted the wiry hair on Betty’s fat middle. “There’s a good girl.” Sheurged the lovable goat down. “Glad to see you, too, Betty.”Jennsen, at ten, had been there for Betty’s birth, and had named her. Betty hadbeen Jennsen’s only childhood friend, and had listened patiently to any numberof worries and fears. When her short horns first began to come in, Betty had inturn rubbed and comforted her head against her faithful friend. Other than herworry of being abandoned by her lifelong companion, Betty’s fears in life werefew.Jennsen groped through her pack until her fingers located a carrot for theever-hungry goat. Betty danced about as she watched, then with her tail waggingin excitement accepted the treat. For reassurance, after the torment of anunusual separation, she rubbed the top of her head against Jennsen’s thigh whilechewing the carrot.The horse in the next stall, her bright intelligent eyes watching, neighedsoftly and tossed her head. Jennsen smiled and gave the horse a carrot alongwith a rub on her white blaze.Jennsen heard the jangle of tack as Sebastian returned, along with thestableman, both carrying saddles. Each man, in turn, laid his load over the railof Betty’s stall. Betty, still wary of Sebastian, backed a few steps.“Sorry to lose the company of your friend, there,” the man said, indicating thegoat, as he came up beside Sebastian.Jennsen scratched Betty’s ears. “I appreciate her care.”“Not much care. The night isn’t over.” The man’s gaze shifted from Sebastian toJennsen. “Why do you two want to leave in the night, anyway? And why do you wantto buy horses? Especially at this hour?”Jennsen froze in panic. She hadn’t expected to have anyone question her and soshe had no answer prepared.“It’s my mother,” Sebastian said in a confidential tone. He let out a convincingsigh. “We just got word that she’s taken ill. They don’t know if she’ll lastuntil we can get there. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t ...Well, we’ll just have to make it in time, that’s all.”The man’s suspicious expression softened with sympathy. Jennsen was surprised athow credible Sebastian sounded. She tried to imitate his look of concern.“I understand, son. I’m sorry-I didn’t realize. What can I do to help?”“Which two horses can you sell us?” Sebastian asked.The man scratched his whiskered chin. “You going to leave the goat?”Sebastian said “Yes” at the same time Jennsen said “No.”The man’s big dark eyes looked from one to the other.“Betty won’t slow us down,” Jennsen said. “She can keep up. We’ll make it toyour mother just the same.”Sebastian leaned a hip against the rail. “I guess the goat will be leaving withus.”With a sigh of disappointment, the man gestured to the horse Jennsen wasscratching behind the ear. “Rusty, here, gets on well with that goat of yours. Iguess she’d be as good to sell as any of the others. You’re a tall girl, so shewould fit you well.”Jennsen nodded her agreement. Betty, as if she had understood every word,bleated hers.“I have a strong chestnut gelding that would better carry your weight,” he saidto Sebastian. “Pete’s down the way, there, on the right. I’d be willing to letyou have him along with Rusty, here.”“Why’s she called Rusty?” Jennsen asked.“Dark as it is in here, you can’t see so well, but she’s a red roan, about asred as they come, all except that white blaze on her forehead.”Rusty sniffed Betty. Betty licked Rusty’s muzzle. The horse snorted softly inresponse.“Rusty it is,” Sebastian said. “And the other, then.”The stableman scratched his stubble again and nodded to seal the agreement.“I’ll go get Pete.”When they returned, Jennsen was pleased to see Pete nuzzle a greeting againstRusty’s shoulder. With danger close on their heels, the last thing she wanted tohave to worry about was handling bickering horses, but these two were friendlyenough. The two men hurried at their work. A mother lay dying, after all.Riding with a blanket on her lap promised to be a welcome relief from travelingon foot. A horse would help keep her warm and make the night ahead moretolerable. They had a long rope for Betty, who tended to get distracted bythings along the way--edible things, especially.Jennsen didn’t know what Sebastian had to pay for the horses and tack, nor didshe care. It was money that had come from her mother’s killers, and would getthem away. Getting away was all that mattered.With a wave to the stableman as he held the big door open for them, they rodeout into the frigid night. Both horses, apparently pleased at the prospect ofactivity, despite the hour, stepped briskly along the street. Rusty turned herhead back, making sure that Betty, at their left, was keeping up.It wasn’t long before they passed the last building on their way out of town.Thin clouds raced before the rising moon, but left enough light to turn thesnow-covered road to a silk ribbon between the thick darkness of the woods alongeach side.Betty’s rope suddenly jerked tight. Jennsen looked over her shoulder, expectingto see the goat trying to nibble at a young branch. Instead, Betty, her legsstiff, had her hooves dug in, resisting any progress.“Betty,” Jennsen whispered harshly, “come on! What’s wrong with you? Come on.”The goat’s weight was no match for the horse, so she was dragged down the snowyroad against her will.When Sebastian’s horse stepped over, jostling Rusty, Jennsen saw the trouble.They were overtaking a man walking down the road. In his dark clothing, theyhadn’t seen him at the right side, against the dark of the trees. Knowing thathorses didn’t like surprises, Jennsen patted Rusty’s neck to assure her that theman wasn’t anything to be frightened of. Betty, though, remained unconvinced,and used all the rope available to swing a wide arc.Jennsen saw then that it was the big blond man from the inn, the man who hadoffered to buy them a drink-the man she thought, for some reason, should dwellonly in her dream life rather than in her waking life.Jennsen kept an eye on the man as they passed him. As cold as she was, it feltas if a door opened into the infinitely colder eternal night of the underworld.Sebastian and the stranger exchanged a brief greeting in passing. Once beyondthe man, Betty scampered ahead, pulling at her rope, eager to put distancebetween her and the man,“Grushdeva du kalt misht. “Jennsen, her breath caught fast at the end of a gasp, turned to stare wide-eyedat the man walking down the road behind. It sounded like it had been he who’dspoken the words. That was impossible; those were the strange words from insideher head.Sebastian made no notice of it, so she didn’t say anything lest he think hercrazy.With Betty’s agreement, Jennsen urged her horse to pick up the pace.Just before they rounded a bend and were away, Jennsen looked back one lasttime. In the moonlight she saw the man grinning at her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13Oba was throwing a hay bale down from the loft when he heard his mother’s voice.“Oba! Where are you? Get down here!”Oba scurried down the ladder. He brushed hay from himself as he straightenedbefore her waiting scowl.“What is it, Mama?”“Where’s my medicine? And your cure?” Her glare swept across the floor. “I seeyou still haven’t gotten the mess out of the barn. I didn’t hear you come homelast night. What took you so long? Look at that stanchion rail! Haven’t youfixed that, yet? What have you been doing all this time? Do I have to tell youevery little thing?”Oba wasn’t sure which question he was supposed to answer first. She always didthat to him, confused him before he could answer her. When he faltered, shewould then insult and ridicule him. After all he had learned the night before,and all that had happened, he thought that he might feel more confident when hefaced his mother.In the light of day, standing back in the barn, with his mother gathered beforehim like a thunderhead, he felt much the same as he always did before herstorming onslaught, ashamed, small, worthless. He had felt big when he camehome. Important. Now he felt as if he were shrinking. Her words shriveled him.“Well, I was-”“You was dawdling! That’s what you was doing-dawdling! Here I am waiting for mymedicine, my knees aching me, and my son Oba the oaf is kicking a rock down theroad, forgetting what I sent him for.”“I didn’t forget-”“Then where’s my medicine? Where is it?”“Mama, I didn’t get it-”“I knew it! I knew you was spending the money I gave you. I worked my fingers tothe bone at spinning to earn that, and you go wasting it on women! Whoring!That’s what you was doing, whoring!”“No, Mama, I didn’t waste it on women.”“Then where’s my medicine! Why didn’t you get it like I told you to!”“I couldn’t because-”“You mean you wouldn’t, you worthless oaf! You only had to go to Lathea’s-”“Lathea is dead.”There, he’d said it. It was out and in the light of day.His mother’s mouth hung open, but no words rained out. He had never seen her gosilent like that before, seen her so shocked that her jaw just hung. He likedit.Oba fished a coin from his pocket, one he had set aside to return so shewouldn’t think he’d spent her money. Amid the drama of such a rare silence, hehanded her the coin.“Dead ... Lathea?” She stared at the coin in her palm. “What do you mean, dead?She went ill?”Oba shook his head, feeling his confidence build as he thought about what he haddone to Lathea, how he’d handled the troublesome sorceress.“No, Mama. Her house burned down. She was killed in the fire.”“Her house burned . . .” His mother’s brow drew together. “How do you know shedied? Lathea isn’t likely to be caught unawares by a fire. The woman is asorceress.”Oba shrugged. “Well, all I know is that when I went to town, I heard a ruckus.People were running toward her house. We all found the place ablaze. A big crowdgathered around, but the fire was so hot that there was no chance of saving theplace.”That last part was, to a degree, true. He had started to leave town, headedhome, because he figured that if no one had spotted the fire, maybe theywouldn’t until morning. He didn’t want to be the one to start yelling “fire.” Inlight of history, that might look suspicious, especially to his mother. She wasa suspicious woman--one of her many peevish traits. Oba had planned on simplytelling his mother the story of what he knew was bound to happen anyway, theblazing ruins, the charred body found.But as he had been walking home after his visit to the inn, not long after thatJennsen woman and the man with her, Sebastian, passed by leaving town on theirjourney to find Althea, he heard people yelling that there was a fire down atLathea’s place. Oba ran down the long dark road with the rest of the people,toward the orange glow off in the trees. He was just a bystander, same aseveryone else. There was no reason to suspect him of anything.“Maybe Lathea escaped the flames.” His mother sounded more like she was tryingto convince herself than him.Oba shook his head. “I stayed, hoping the same as you, Mama. I knew you’d wantme to help her if she was hurt. I stayed to do what I could. That’s why I was solate.”That, too, was partly true; he had stayed, along with the crowd, watching thefire, listening to the talk. He had savored the crowd’s anticipation. Thegossip. The speculation.“She’s a sorceress. Fire isn’t likely to catch such a woman.”His mother was starting to sound suspicious. Oba had figured on this. He leaneda little toward her.“When the fire burned out enough, some of us men threw snow down so we could getin over the smoking rubble. Inside, we found Lathea’s bones.”Oba pulled a blackened finger bone from his pocket. He held it out, offering itto his mother. She stared down at the grim evidence, but folded her arms withouttaking it. Pleased with the effect it had, Oba finally returned the treasure tohis pocket.“She was in the middle of the room, with one hand lifted above her head, likeshe had tried to make it to the door but was overcome by the smoke. The men saidthat a fire’s smoke was what put folks down, and then the fire got at them. Thatmust have been what happened to Lathea. The smoke got her. Then, laying there onthe floor, reaching toward the door, the fire burned her to death.”His mother glared at him, her mean little mouth all pinched up, but silent. Foronce, she had no words. He found her glare, though, was just as bad. In thedaggers of that glare, he could tell that she was thinking he was no good. Herbastard boy.Darken Rahl’s bastard son. Almost royalty.Her arms slipped from their sullen knot as she turned away. “I have to get backto my spinning for Mr. Tuchmann. You get this mess scooped off the floor, youhear?”“I will, Mama.”“And you had better get that stanchion fixed before I come back and see thatyou’ve been loafing away the day.”For several days Oba worked at the frozen muck on the floor, but made littleheadway. The weather had stayed bitterly cold, so the frozen mound, if anything,had only hardened. His efforts at wearing it down seemed interminable, liketrying to chip away granite ledge. Or his mother’s stony disposition.He had his other chores, of course, and he couldn’t let them go. He had fixedthe stanchion and a broken hinge on the barn door. The animals had to beattended to, along with a hundred other small things.In his head, as he worked, he planned the construction of their fireplace. Hewould use the back wall between the house and barn, since it was alreadyexisting. Mentally, he stacked stones against it, creating the shape of thefirebox. He already had his eye on a long stone to use for the lintel. He wouldmortar everything all together properly. When Oba set his mind to doingsomething, he put his all into it. He didn’t do any job he started just halfway.In his mind’s eye, he pictured how surprised and happy his mother would be whenshe saw what he’d built them. She would recognize his worth, then. She wouldfinally acknowledge his value. But he had other work to do before he could beginto build a fireplace.One job, in particular, loomed before him. The surface of the mound of frozenmuck in the barn showed the scars of the battle. It was now pocked with holes,places where he had been able to find a weakness, a place with air or dry strawunderneath that had allowed him to break out a chunk. Each time a piece went“pop” and came lose, he was sure that he had at last found a way into theformidable tomb of ice, but each time had been a false hope. Chipping away withthe scoop shovel was slow going, but Oba was not a quitter.The worry had come to him that perhaps a man of his importance should not bewasting his time on such menial labor. Frozen manure hardly seemed the provinceof a man who was in all likelihood something akin to a prince. At the least, henow knew he was an important man. A man with Rahl blood in his veins. A directdescendant, the son of the man who had ruled D’Hara, Darken Rahl. There probablywasn’t a single person who had not heard of Darken Rahl. Oba’s father.Sooner or later, he would confront his mother with the truth she had beenkeeping from him-the truth of the man he really was. He just couldn’t figure howto do it without her discovering that Lathea had spilled the news before shespilled her blood.Winded from a particularly spirited attack on the frozen mound, Oba rested hisforearms on the shovel’s handle while he caught his breath. Despite the cold,sweat trickled down from his matted blond hair.“Oba the oaf,” said his mother as she strode into the barn. “Standing around,doing nothing, thinking nothing, worth nothing. That’s you, isn’t it? Oba theoaf!She glided to a stop, her mean little mouth all puckered up as she peered downher nose at him.“Mama. I was just catching my breath.” He pointed around at the chips of icelittering the floor, evidence of his strenuous efforts. “I’ve been working atit, Mama. I have.”She didn’t look. She was glaring at him. He waited, knowing she had somethingmore on her mind than the mound of frozen muck. He always knew when she was on amission to trouble him, to make him feel like the muck he stood in. From thedark crevices and hidey-holes around the barn, the rats watched with theirlittle black rat eyes.With her critical gaze locked on him, his mother held out a coin. She held itbetween her thumb and first finger, not simply to convey the coin itself, butits importance.Oba was a little bewildered. Lathea was dead. There was no other sorceressanywhere close, none that he knew of, anyway, who could provide his mother’smedicine-or his cure. He obediently turned his palm up, anyway.“Look at it,” she commanded, dropping the coin into his hand.Oba held it out to the light of the doorway, scrutinizing it with care. He knewshe expected him to find something-what, he didn’t know. He turned it over as hecautiously stole a glance at her. He carefully inspected the other side, butstill saw nothing out of the ordinary.“Yes, Mama?”“Notice anything unusual about it, Oba?”“No, Mama.”“It doesn’t have a scratch along the edge.”Oba puzzled that over for a moment, then looked again at the coin, this timecarefully inspecting the edge.“No, Mama.”“That’s the coin you gave back to me.”Oba nodded, having no reason to doubt her. “Yes, Mama. The coin you gave me forLathea. But I told you, Lathea died in the fire, so I couldn’t buy yourmedicine. That’s why I gave you your coin back.”Her hot glare was murderous, but her voice was arrestingly cool and collected.“It isn’t the same coin, Oba.Oba grinned. “Sure it is, Mama.”“The coin I gave you had a mark on the edge. A mark I put there.”Oba’s grin withered as his mind raced. He tried to think of what to say-what hecould say-that she would believe. He couldn’t contend that he put the coin in apocket and then pulled out a different coin when he gave it back to her, becausehe never had any money of his own. She knew very well that he didn’t have anymoney; she wouldn’t allow it. She thought he was no good, and that he mightwaste it.But he had money, now. He had all the money from Lathea-a fortune. He rememberedhurriedly gathering up all the coins that had spilled from Lathea’s pocket,including the coin he’d only just given her. When he later set aside a coin toreturn to his mother, he hadn’t known that she had marked the one she’d givenhim. Oba had the bad luck of returning a different coin than the one she hadoriginally given him.“But, Mama ... are you sure? Maybe you only thought you marked the coin. Maybeyou forgot.”She slowly shook her head. “No. I marked it so that if you spent it on drinkingor on women I would know because I could go look for it if I had to, and seewhat you had done.”The conniving bitch. She didn’t even trust her own son. What kind of mother wasshe, anyway?What proof did she have other than a missing, tiny scratch on the edge of acoin? None. The woman was a lunatic.“But, Mama, you must be wrong. I don’t have any money-you know I don’t. Wherewould I get a different coin?”“That’s what I’d like to know.” Her eyes were frightening. He could hardlybreathe under their blistering scrutiny. Her voice, though, remained composed.“I told you to buy medicine with that money.”“How could I? Lathea died. I gave you your coin back.”She looked so broad and powerful standing there before him, like an avengingspirit in the flesh come to speak for the dead. Maybe Lathea’s spirit hadreturned to tell on him. He hadn’t considered that possibility. That would bejust like the troublesome sorceress. She was sneaky. This mi2ht be just what shehad done, intent on denying him his importance,his due prestige.“Do you know why I named you ‘Oba’?’“No Mama”“It’s an ancient D’Haran name. Did you know that, Oba?”“No, Mama.” His curiosity got the best of him. “What does it mean?”“It means two things. Servant, and king. I named you ‘Oba,’ hoping you mightsomeday be a king, and if not, then you would at least be a servant of theCreator. Fools are rarely made kings. You will never be a king. That was just asilly dream of a new mother. That leaves ‘servant ‘ Who do you serve Oba?”Oba knew very well who he served. In so doing, he had become invincible.“Where did you get this coin Oba?”“I told you, Mama, I couldn’t get your medicine because Lathea had died in thefire at her place. Maybe the mark on your coin rubbed off against something inmy pocket.”She seemed to consider his words. “Are you sure, Oba?”Oba nodded, hoping that maybe he was at last turning her mind away from the coinmix-up. “Of course, Mama. Lathea died That’s why I gave you your coin back. Icouldn’t get your medicine.His mother lifted an eyebrow. “Really, Oba?”She slowly drew her hand from the pocket of her dress. He couldn’t see what itwas she had, but he was relieved that he was finally bringing her around.“That’s right, Mama. Lathea was dead.” He found he liked saying that.“Really. Oba? You couldn’t get the medicine? You wouldn’t lie to your mother,would you, Oba?”He shook his head emphatically. “No, Mama.“Then what’s this?” She turned over her hand and held out the bottle of medicineLathea had Oven him before he had dealt with her “I found this in your jacketpocket, Oba. “Oba stared at the cursed bottle, at the troublesome sorceress’s revenge. Heshould have killed the woman right off, before she gave him the telltale bottleof medicine. He had completely forgotten that he had put it in a pocket of hisjacket, intending to toss it in the woods on his way home that night. What withall the important new things he had been learning, he had completely forgottenabout the cursed bottle of medicine.“Well, I think ... I think it must be an old bottle-”“And old bottle? It’s full!” Her razor-edged voice was back. “How did you manageto get a bottle of medicine from a woman who was dead-in her house that hadalready burned down? How, Oba? And how is it that you gave me back a differentcoin than the one I gave you to pay with? How!” She took a step closer. “How,Oba? “Oba backed a step. He couldn’t pull his eyes away from the cursed cure. Hecouldn’t look up into his mother’s fierce eyes. If he did, he just knew shewould wither him to tears under her deadly glare.“well, I ... ““Well I what, Oba? Well I what, you filthy bastard boy? You worthless lazy lyingbastard boy. You wretched, scheming, vile bastard boy, Oba Schalk. “Oba’s eyes turned up. He was right, she had him fixed in her deadly glare.But he had become invincible.“Oba Rahl,” he said.She didn’t flinch. He realized then that she had been goading him into admittinghe knew. It was all part of her scheme. That name, Rahl, screamed out how he hadcome to know it, betraying everything to his mother. Oba stood frozen, his mindin a wild state of turmoil, like a rat with a foot on his tail.“The spirits curse me,” she said under her breath, “I should have done whatLathea always told me. I should have spared us all. You killed her. Youloathsome bastard. You contemptible lying-”Quick as a fox, Oba whipped the shovel around, putting all his weight andstrength behind the swing. The steel shovel rang like a bell against her skull.She dropped like a sack of grain pushed out of the loft-whump.Oba rapidly retreated a step, fearful she might skitter toward him, spiderlike,and with her mean little mouth bite him on the ankle. He was positive that shewas fully capable of it. The conniving bitch.Lightning quick, he darted forward and whacked her again with the shovel, righton the same place on her broad forehead, then retreated out of range of herteeth, before she could bite him like a spider. He often thought of her as aspider. A black widow.The ring of steel on skull hung in the otherwise still air of the barn, slowly,slowly, slowly dying away. Silence, like a heavy shroud, settled around him.Oba stood poised, shovel cocked back over his shoulder, ready to swing again. Hewatched her carefully. Nearly clear, pinkish fluid leaked from both her ears,out across the frozen muck.In a frenzy of fear and rage, he ran forward and swung the shovel at her head,over and over. The ringing blows of steel on bone echoed around the barn,creating one long clangorous din. The rats, watching with their little black rateyes, scurried for their holes.Oba staggered back, gasping for air after the violent effort of silencing her.He panted as he watched her still form sprawled atop the mound of frozen muck.Her arms were spread out wide to each side, as if asking for a hug. The sneakybitch. She might be up to something. Trying to make amends, probably. Offering ahug, as if that could make up for the times he’d spent in the pen.Her face looked different. She had an odd expression. He tiptoed closer for alook. Her skull was all misshapen, like a ripe melon broken on the ground.This was so new that he couldn’t gather his thoughts.Mama, her melon head, all broke open.For good measure, he whacked her three more times, quick as he could, thenretreated to a safe distance, shovel at the ready, should she suddenly spring upto start yelling at him. That would be just like her. Sneaky. The woman was alunatic.The barn remained silent. He saw his breath puffing out in the cold air. Nobreath came from his mother. Her chest was still. The crimson pool around herhead oozed down the muck mound. Some of the holes he’d chopped filled with therunny contents of her curious melon head all broken open on the ground.Oba began to feel more confident, then, that his mother was not going to sayhateful things to him anymore. His mother, not being too smart, had probablygone along with Lathea’s nagging, and had been talked into hating him, her onlyson. The two women had ruled his life. He had been nothing but the helplessservant of the two harpies.Fortunately, he had finally become invincible and had rescued himself from themboth.“Do you want to know who I serve, Mama? I serve the voice that made meinvincible. The voice that rid me of you!”His mother had nothing more to say. At long last, she had nothing more to say.Then, Oba grinned.He pulled out his knife. He was a new man. A man who pursued intellectualinterests when they arose. He thought he should have a look at what other oddand curious things might be found inside his lunatic mother.Oba liked to learn new things.Oba was eating a nice lunch of eggs cooked in the hearth he had started to buildfor himself, when he heard a wagon rumbling into the yard. It had been over aweek since his sneaky mother had opened her mean little mouth for the last time.Oba went to the door, opened it a crack, and stood eating his eggs as he peeredout to see the rear of a wagon pulled up close by. A man climbed down.It was Mr. Tuchmann, who regularly brought wool. Oba’s mother was a spinster whomade thread for Mr. Tuchmann. He used the thread on his loom. With so many newthings demanding his attention lately, Oba had forgotten all about Mr. Tuchmann.Oba glanced over to the corner to see how much thread his mother had ready. Notmuch. Bales of wool sat to the side, waiting to be spun into thread. The leasthis mother could have done would be to attend to her work before she started incausing trouble.Oba didn’t know what to do. When he looked back to the doorway, Mr. Tuchmann wasstanding right there, looking in. He was a tall man, thin, with a big nose andears. His hair was graying and as curly as the wool he dealt in. He was recentlywidowed. Oba knew that his mother liked Mr. Tuchmann. Maybe he could haveleached some of the venom from her fangs. Softened her a bit. It was aninteresting theory to contemplate.“Afternoon, Oba.” His eyes, eyes that Oba had always found curiously liquid,were peering in the crack, searching the house. “Is your mother about?”Oba, feeling a little violated by the man’s roving eyes, stood holding the plateof eggs, trying to think what to do, what to say. Mr. Tuchmann’s gaze settled onthe fireplace.Oba, standing ill at ease behind the door, reminded himself that he was a newman. An important man. Important men weren’t unsure of themselves. Important menseized the moment, and created their own greatness.“Mama?” Oba set down his plate as he glanced to the fireplace. “Oh, she’s about,somewhere.”Wool-headed Mr. Tuchmann stared stone-faced at Oba’s grin for a time.“You heard about Lathea? What they found at her place?”Oba thought the man had a mouth kind of like his mother had. Mean. Sneaky.“Lathea?” Oba sucked at a piece of egg stuck between his teeth. “She’s dead.What could they find?”“More precisely, what they didn’t find, I guess you could say. Money. Lathea hadmoney, everyone knew that. But they found none in her house.”Oba shrugged. “Must have burned up. Melted.”Mr. Tuchmann grunted his skepticism. “Maybe. Maybe not. Some folks say maybe itwas gone before the fire started.”Oba felt indignant that people just couldn’t let a thing go. Didn’t they havetheir own business to mind? Why couldn’t they leave well enough alone? Theyshould rejoice that the sorceress was out of their lives and leave it at that.They had to keep picking at it, though. Peck, peck, peck, like a gaggle of geeseat the grain. Busybodies, that’s what they were.“I’ll tell Mama you were here.”“I need the thread she’s spun. I have another load of wool for her. I need to beon my way. Got other people waiting.”The man had a whole bevy of women who spun wool for him. Didn’t he ever give hispoor spinsters a chance to catch their breath?“Well, I’m afraid that Mama hasn’t had time to. . . “Mr. Tuchmann was staring at the fireplace again, only more intently, this time.The look on his face was more than curious; it bordered on anger. The man,accustomed to ordering people around and always more bold than Oba feltcomfortable around, stepped through the door and into the house, to the centerof the room, still staring at the fireplace. His arm rose, pointing.“What’s ... what’s that? Dear Creator . .Oba looked where he was pointing-at the new fireplace being built against thestone wall that separated the house from the barn. Oba thought his work wasquite well done-sturdy and straight. He had studied other fireplaces and learnedhow they were done. Even though the chimney wasn’t built all the way up yet, hewas using it. He had put it to good advantage.Oba saw then, what Mr. Tuchmann was really pointing at.Mama’s jawbone.Well, wasn’t this just something. Oba hadn’t expected visitors, especiallysnoopy visitors. What gave this man the right to poke his nose into otherpeople’s houses, just because they spun wool for him?Mr. Tuchmann started backing toward the door. Oba knew that Mr. Tuchmann wouldtalk about what he’d seen. The man was a gossip, already flapping his tongue toanyone who would listen about Lathea’s missing money-which, after all, wasreally Oba’s, when you considered the lifetime of trouble he had endured to earnit. Who were all these people coming out of the woodwork to stick up for thetroublesome sorceress?When Mr. Tuchmann started blabbing about what he saw in the fireplace, therewere sure to be questions. Everyone would have to stick their noses in it andwant to know whose it was. They would probably start fretting over his mother,now, just like they were doing over the sorceress.Oba, a new man, a man of action, could hardly let that happen. Oba was animportant man, he’d learned. Rahl blood coursed through his veins, after all.Important men acted-handled problems as they arose. Quickly. Efficiently.Decisively.Oba seized Mr. Tuchmann by the back of his neck, halting his retreat. The manstruggled fiercely. He was tall and wiry, but he was no match for Oba’s strengthor speed.With a grunt of effort, Oba plunged his knife up into Mr. Tuchmann’s middle. Theman’s mouth opened wide. His eyes, always so liquid, always so curious, wentwide as well, filled now with a look of terror.Oba followed the obnoxious Mr. Tuchmann to the ground. They had work to do. Obawas never afraid of hard work. First, there was the struggling wool-headed snoopto deal with. Then, there was the matter of his wagon. People would probablycome looking for him. Oba’s life was getting complicated.Mr. Tuchmann called for help. Oba rammed his knife up into the soft part underMr. Tuchmann’s chin. Oba leaned over him, watched the man struggle, knowing hewas going to die.Oba had nothing against Mr. Tuchmann, really-even though the man was impertinentand bossy. This was all that troublesome sorceress’s fault. She was still makingOba’s life difficult. She had probably sent some message to his mother and thento Mr. Tuchmann from beyond in the underworld. The bitch. Then, his mother hadto get all sneaky and suspicious. And now this irksome pest, Mr. Tuchmann. Theywere like a swarm of locusts, come from nowhere to plague him.It was because he was important, he knew.It was probably time for changes. Oba couldn’t stay around and keep havingpeople who knew him pestering him with questions. He was too important to be inthis little nothing of a place, anyway.Mr. Tuchmann grunted in his futile effort to escape. It was time for the unhappywidower to join Oba’s lunatic mother and the troublesome sorceress with theKeeper of the underworld, the world of the dead.And then, the time had come for Oba to take up his important life as a new manand to move on to better places.Just as the realization struck him that he would never again have to go in thebarn and see the mound of frozen muck that he hadn’t been able to dislodge withthe scoop shovel, despite the ranting insistence of his lunatic mother, itoccurred to him that if he had used the pickaxe, that would have made quick workof it.Well, wasn’t that just something."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14With an easy but flawlessly precise turn of his wrist, Friedrich Gilder lifted aleaf of gold on the fine hairs of his brush and laid it over. The gold, lightenough to float on the gentlest breath of air, drew down onto the wet gesso asif by magic. Leaning over his workbench in concentration, Friedrich used asheep’s-wool pad to carefully rub the freshly gilded surface of the smallstylized carving of a bird, checking for any flaws.Outside, the rain occasionally tink-tink-tinked against the window. Thoughmidday, when the prowling clouds passed bearing fits of rain, it darkened as ifto dusk.From the back room where he worked, Friedrich glanced up, looking out throughthe doorway into the main room, watching the familiar movements of his wifecasting her stones over the Grace. Many years ago he had gilded the lines of herGrace, the eight-sided star within a circle within a square within anothercircle-after she had properly drawn it all out, of course. The Grace would havebeen useless had he drawn it. A Grace, to be real, had to be drawn by one withthe gift.He enjoyed doing whatever he could to make the things in her life a little morebeautiful. She was what made his life beautiful. He thought that her smile hadbeen gilded by the Creator Himself.Friedrich saw, too, the woman who had ventured to their home for a telling leanforward expectantly, absorbed in watching the fall of her fate.If they could really see such things, people would not come to Althea for atelling, yet they always watched intently as the stones rolled from his wife’slong slender fingers and out across the board upon which was drawn the Grace.This woman, middle-aged and widowed, was a pleasant sort, and had been to seeAlthea twice before, but that had been several years back. As he hadconcentrated on his own work, he’d absently heard her tell Althea about herseveral grown children who were married and lived close to her, and that herfirst grandchild was on the way. Now, though, it was the drop of stones, not achild, that held the woman’s interest.“Again?” she asked. It was not a question so much as astonishment. “They did itagain.”Althea said nothing. Friedrich burnished the freshly laid gold as he listened tothe familiar sounds of his wife gathering up her stones from the board.“Do they do that, often?” the woman asked, her wide eyes turning from the Graceto Althea’s face. Althea didn’t answer. The woman rubbed her knuckles so hardthat Friedrich thought the skin might come off. “What does it mean?”“Hush,” Althea murmured as she rattled the stones.Friedrich had never heard his wife be so uncommunicative with a customer. Thestones clacking in Althea’s loose fist seemed to have an urgency to their bonyknock. The woman rubbed her knuckles, awaiting her destiny.Again, the seven stones rolled out across the board, come to divulge the holysecrets of the fates.From where he sat, Friedrich couldn’t see the stones fall, but he could hear thefamiliar sound of their uneven shapes rolling across the board. After all theseyears, he rarely watched Althea practice her profession, that is, watched thestones themselves. He did, though, despite the years, savor watching Althea. Ashe looked out, seeing the side of her strong jaw, her hair still mostly a goldensweep down past her jaw, falling like sunlight over her shoulder, he smiled.The woman gasped. “Again!” As if to make the woman’s point, thunder in thedistance rolled over the house. “Mistress Althea, what could it mean?” Her voicecarried the unmistakable timbre of apprehension.Althea, on her pillow on the floor, leaning on one arm, her withered legs out tothe side, used the arm against the floor to straighten herself. She finallylooked at the woman.“It means, Margery, that you are a woman of strong spirit-”“That’s one of those two stones? Me? A strong spirit?”“That’s right,” Althea confirmed with a nod.“And the other, then? It can’t be good. Not there. It can only mean the worst. ““I was about to tell you, that the other stone, which follows with each throw,is also a strong spirit. A man of strong spirit.”Margery peered again at the stones on the board. She rubbed her knuckles. “But,but they both.. . “ She gestured. “They both keep going ... out there. To beyondthe outer circle. To the underworld.” Her troubled eyes searched Althea’s face.Althea pulled on her knees, drawing her legs before herself to cross them.Though her legs were withered and nearly useless, crossing them before herpillow on the floor helped her sit up straight.“No, no, my dear. Not at all. Don’t you see? This is good. Both strong spiritsgoing through life together, and together ever after. It’s the best possibleoutcome of a telling.”Margery cast another worried look at the board. “Really? Really, MistressAlthea? You think it’s good, then, that they keep ... doing that?”“Of course, Margery. Good it is. Two strong spirits joining.”Margery touched a finger to her lower lip as she peered up at Althea. “Who is itthen? Who is this mystery man I’m to meet?”Althea shrugged. “Too soon to tell. But the stones say you will meet a man”-shemade a show of putting her first and second fingers tight together-”and you twowill be fast with each other. Congratulations, Margery. It looks as if you areclose to finding the happiness you seek.”“When? How soon?”Again, Althea shrugged. “Too soon to tell. The stones only say ‘will,’ not‘when.’ Maybe tomorrow, maybe next year. But the important thing is that you arenear to meeting a man who will be good with you, Margery. You must now keep youreyes open. Don’t hide yourself away in your house, or you will miss him.”“But if the stones say-”“The stones say he is strong and he is open to you, but they don’t fix it sure.That’s up to you and the man. Keep yourself open to him when he comes into yourlife, or he may pass without seeing you.”“I will, Mistress Althea.” The conviction in her voice strengthened. “I will.I’ll stay prepared so when he happens into my life, I’ll see him, and he’ll seeme, just as the stones foretell.”“Good”The woman fished around in the leather purse hanging from her belt until shefound a coin. She handed it over eagerly, pleased with the outcome of hertelling.Friedrich had watched Althea give tellings for nearly four decades. In all thattime, he had never before seen her lie to someone.The woman stood, holding out her hand. “May I help you, Mistress Althea?”“Thank you, my dear, but Friedrich will help me, later. I want to stay with myboard for now.”The woman smiled, perhaps daydreaming of the new life waiting for her. “Well,then, I’d best be on my way before it gets any later in the day ... beforenightfall. And then it’s a long ride back.” She leaned to the side and wavedthrough the doorway. “Good day, Master Friedrich.”The rain rattled against the window in earnest. The sky, he noticed, haddarkened, casting a gray gloom over their place in the swamp. Rising from hisbench, Friedrich waved. “Let me see you to the door, Margery. You do havesomeone waiting to take you back, don’t you?”“My son-in-law is up at the rim of the canyon, where the path starts down in,waiting with our horses.” She paused in the doorway and gestured to his work onthe bench. “That’s a fine piece you’ve made.”Friedrich smiled. “I hope to find a customer at the palace who thinks so, too.”“You will, you will. You do fine work. Everyone says so. Those who own a pieceof your work count themselves as lucky.”Margery curtsied happily to Althea, thanking her again, before retrieving herlamb’s-skin cloak from the hook by the door. She smiled out at the angry sky anddonned the cloak, drawing its hood over her head, eager to be on her way to findher new man. It would be a long journey back. Before closing the door, Friedrichwarned Margery to be absolutely certain to stay on the path and to watch herstep up out of the canyon. She said she remembered the instructions and promisedto follow them with care.He watched her hurry off, disappearing into the shadows and mist, before closingthe door tight against the foul weather. Silence settled once more inside thehouse. Outside, thunder rumbled in a deep voice, as if in discontent.Friedrich shuffled up behind his wife. “Here, let me help you to your chair.”Althea had gathered up her stones. Once again, they rattled in her hand like thebones of spirits. As considerate as she always was, it was unlike her not toacknowledge him when he spoke. It was even more unlike her to cast her stonesagain after a customer left. Casting her stones for a telling called upon hergift in ways he could not fully understand, but he did understand how itfatigued her. Casting her stones for a telling drew down her strength so that itleft her detached from the world and wanting anything but to cast them again fora while.Now, though, she was in the spell of some tacit need.She turned her wrist and opened her hand, casting the stones at her board aseasily, as gracefully, as he handled his ethereal leaves of gold. Smooth, dark,irregular-shaped stones rolled forth, bouncing on the board, tumbling across thegilded Grace.In their life together, Friedrich had seen her cast her stones tens of thousandsof times. There were times when, much like her customers, he had tried todiscern a pattern in the fall of the stones. He never could.Althea always did.She saw meaning no mere mortal could see. She saw in the random fall of thestones some obscure omen only a sorceress could decipher. Patterns of magic.There was no pattern expressed through the act of the throw; it was the fall ofthe stones that was touched by powers he dared not consider, powers that spokeonly to the sorceress through her gift. In that random motif of disorder, shecould read the flow of powers through the world of life, and even, he feared,the world of the dead, although she never spoke of it. Despite how close theywere in body and soul, this was one thing they could not share in their lifetogether.This time, as the stones rolled and wobbled across the board, one stopped in theexact center. Two stopped on opposite corners of the square where it touched theouter circle. Two ended up at opposite points where the square and the innercircle touched. The final two stones came to rest beyond the outer circle, whichrepresented the underworld.Lightning flashed, and seconds later thunder clapped.Friedrich stared in disbelief. He wondered what the odds were of the stonescoming to the end of their tumble at these specific points on the Grace. He hadnever before seen them end in any discernible pattern.Althea, too, was staring at her board.“Have you ever seen anything like that before?” he asked.“I’m afraid so,” she said under her breath as she raked the stones up with hergraceful fingers.“Really?” He was sure he would have recalled such an unlikely event, such astartling orderliness. “When was that?”She rattled the stones in her loose fist. “The four previous throws. Thatcasting made five, all the same, each individual stone coming to rest in theidentical place it had before.”Again, she cast the stones at the board. At the same time, the sky seemed toopen, letting rain roar down on the roof. The noise reverberated through thehouse. Involuntarily, he glanced toward the ceiling briefly before watchingalong with Althea as the stones rolled and bounced across the board.The first stone rolled to a halt in the exact center of the Grace. Lightningflashed. The other stones, rolling in what looked to be a completely naturalmanner, came to rest in what appeared a perfectly normal way, except that theystopped in the exact same places they had before.“Six,” Althea said under her breath. Thunder boomed.Friedrich didn’t know if she was speaking to him, or to herself.“But the first four throws were for that woman, Margery. You were casting themfor her. This is for her telling.”Even to himself, it sounded more like a plea than reason.“Margery came for a telling,” Althea said. “That does not mean the stones choseto give her one. The stones have decided that this telling is for me.”“What does it mean, then?”“Nothing,” she said. “Not yet, anyway. At this point it is only potential-athunderhead on the horizon. The stones may yet say this storm is to pass us by.”Watching as she gathered up her stones, he was overcome with a sense of dread.“Enough of this-you need to rest. Why don’t you let me help you up, now, Althea?I’ll make you something to eat.” He watched her pluck the last stone, the one inthe center, off the board. “Leave your stones for now. I’ll make you some nicehot tea.”He never before thought of the stones as anything sinister. Now he felt as ifthey were somehow inviting menace into their lives.He didn’t want her to cast the stones again.He sank down beside her. “Althea-”“Hush, Friedrich.” She spoke the words in a flat tone, not in anger or reproach,but simple necessity. The rain drummed against the roof with rabid intensity.Water cascading off the eaves roared. Darkness out the windows faltered in fitsof lightning.He listened to the stones rattle, like the bones of the dead speaking to her.For the first time in their life together, he felt a kind of defensive hatredfor the seven stones she held, as if they were some lover come to steal her awayfrom him.From her seat atop her gold and red pillow on the floor, Althea cast the stonesdown onto the Grace.As they tumbled across the board, he watched with resignation as they came torest, natural as could be, in the exact same places. He would have beensurprised only if they had fallen differently.“Seven,” she whispered. “Seven times seven stones.”Thunder rumbled in a deep resonant tone, like the voice of discontent of spiritsin the underworld.Friedrich rested a hand on his wife’s shoulder. A presence had come into theirhome-invaded their lives. He couldn’t see it, but he knew it was there. He felta great weariness, as if all his years had come at once to weigh him down,making him feel very old. He wondered if this was in some small way what shefelt all the time when she became so weary from casting a telling. He shudderedto contemplate always swimming in such emotionally turbulent waters. His world,his work of gilding, seemed so simple, so blissful, in its ignorance of theswirl of tempestuous forces all around.The worst of it, though, was that he could not protect her from this unseenthreat. In this, he was helpless.“Althea, what does it mean?”She hadn’t moved. She was staring at the smooth dark stones setting on herGrace.“One who hears the voices is coming.”Lightning ignited in a blinding angry flash, illuminating the room with whiteincandescence. The scintillating contrast between bright light and smotheringshadow was dizzying. The intense strike flickered on as thunder crashed with aboom that shook the ground. A ripping crash followed on its heels, the clamoradding a confusion of sound to match the flashing of light.Friedrich swallowed. “Do you know which one?”She reached up and patted his hand resting on her shoulder. “Tea, you say? Therain gives me a chill. I’d like some tea.”He looked from the crinkled smile showing in her eyes to the stones on theGrace. For whatever reason, she wasn’t going to answer that question, for now.He asked another, instead.“Why did your stones fall like that, Althea? What does something like thatmean?”Lightning struck nearby. The crack of thunder felt as if it split air made ofsolid stone. Fists of rain beat against the window in petulant fits.Althea finally looked away from the window, from Creation’s fury, and turnedback to the board. She reached out and placed her forefinger on the stone in thecenter.“The Creator?” he guessed aloud before she could name it.She shook her head. “Lord Rahl.”“But, the star in the center represents the Creator-his gift.”“It does, in the Grace. But you must not forget, this is a telling. This isdifferent. A telling only uses the Grace, and in this telling the stone in thecenter represents the one with His gift.”“Then it could be anyone,” Friedrich said. “Anyone with the gift.”“No. The lines coming from the eight points of the star represent the gift as itpasses through life, through the veil between the worlds, and beyond the outercircle into the underworld. Thus it represents the gift in a sense that itconveys with no other person: the gift for magic of both worlds, the world oflife, and the world of the dead: Additive and Subtractive. This stone in thecenter touches both.”He glanced back at the stone in the center of the Grace. “But why would thatmean Lord Rahl?”“Because he is the only one born in three thousand years with both aspects ofthe gift. In all that time, until he came into his gift, no stone I have casthas ever landed in that place. None could.“What has it been? Two years, now, since he succeeded his father? Less, sincehis gift came to life in him-which in itself leaves questions with onlytroubling answers.”“But I recall you telling me years ago that Darken Rahl used both sides of thegift.”Gazing off into dark memories, Althea shook her head. “He also used Subtractivepowers, but he did not do so by birth. He offered the pure souls of children tothe Keeper of the underworld in return for the Keeper’s favors. Darken Rahl hadto trade for the limited use of such powers. But this man, this Lord Rahl, hasbeen born with both sides of the gift, as those of old were.”Friedrich wasn’t sure what to make of that, what danger it could be that he sostrongly felt. He remembered quite distinctly the day the new Lord Rahl hadrisen to power. Friedrich had been at the palace to sell his small gildedcarvings when the great event had taken place. That day, he had seen the newLord Rahl, Richard.It had been one of those moments in life never to be forgotten-only the thirdRahl to rule in Friedrich’s lifetime. He remembered quite clearly the new LordRahl, tall, strong, with a raptor gaze, striding through the palace, seemingcompletely out of place, and at the same time belonging. And then there was thesword he carried, a legendary sword not seen in D’Hara since Friedrich had beena boy, way back before the boundaries had been brought into existence, cuttingD’Hara off from the rest of the new world.The new Lord Rahl had been walking through the corridors of the People’s Palacealong with an old man-a wizard, people said-and a sublime woman. The woman, withlong lush hair, wearing a satiny white dress, made the grandeur and majesty ofthe palace seem dull and common by comparison.Richard Rahl and that woman seemed right together. Friedrich recognized thespecial way they looked at each other. The commitment, loyalty, and bond in thegray eyes of that man and the green eyes of that woman was as profound as it wasunmistakable.“What of the other stones?” he asked.Althea gestured out past the larger circle of the Grace, where only the giltrays of the Creator’s gift dared go, to the two dark stones sitting in the worldof the dead.“Those who hear the voices,” Althea said.He nodded at having his suspicions confirmed. In such things dealing with magic,it wasn’t often that he was able to guess the truth from what appeared to beobvious.“And the rest?”Staring at the four stones resting at the cusps of lines, her voice came softly,mingling with the rain. “These are protectors.”“They protect Lord Rahl?”“They protect us all.”He saw then the tears rolling down her weathered cheeks.“Pray,” she whispered, “that they are enough, or the Keeper will have us all.”“You mean to say, there are only these four who protect us?”“There are others, but these four are pivotal. Without them, everything islost.”Friedrich licked his lips, fearful of the fate of the four sentinels standingagainst the Keeper of the dead. “Althea, do you know who they are?”She turned then, putting her arms around him, pressing the side of her face tohis chest. It was as childlike a gesture as he could imagine, one that touchedhis heart and made him ache with his love for her. Gently he put protective armsaround her, comforting her, in spite of the fact that in truth he could donothing to protect her from such things as she rightly feared.“Carry me to my chair, Friedrich?”He nodded, lifting her in his arms as she hugged his neck. Her withered, uselesslegs dangled. A woman of such power as could enforce a warm and rain-swept swamparound them in winter, yet she needed him to carry her to a chair. Him,Friedrich, a mere man she loved-a man without the gift. A man who loved her.“You didn’t answer my question, Althea.”Her arms tightened on his neck.“One of the four protective stones,” she whispered, “is me.”Friedrich’s wide eyes turned back to the Grace with the stones upon it. His jawfell open when he saw that one of the four stones had crumbled to ash.She had no need to look. “One was my sister,” Althea said. Cradled in his arms,he felt her grieving sob. “And now there are three.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15Jennsen moved out of the way of the flood of people flowing up the road from thesouth. Huddling close to Sebastian for shelter from the wind, she brieflyconsidered simply curling up on the frozen ground off to the side and going tosleep. Her stomach grumbled with hunger.When Rusty stepped sideways, Jennsen slid her grip up on the reins, closer tothe bit. Betty, her eyes, ears, and tail alert, pressed up against Jennsen’sthigh for reassurance. The footsore goat occasionally huffed her annoyance atthe passing throngs. When Jennsen patted her fat middle, Betty’s upright tailinstantly became a wagging blur. She glanced up at Jennsen, swiped her tongueout for a brief lick of Rusty’s muzzle, and then folded her legs to lie down atJennsen’s feet.As his sheltering an-n enclosed her shoulders, Sebastian eyed the wagons, carts,and people moving past on their way toward the People’s Palace. The sound of thewagons rumbling by, people talking and laughing, feet shuffling, and horsesclopping all melted together into a steady drone punctuated by jangling metaland the rhythmic squeaking of axles. The clouds of dust lifted by all themovement carried the aroma of food along with the stink of people and animalsand left the taste of dirt on her tongue.“What do you think?” Sebastian asked in a low voice.The cold sunrise bathed the distant sheer cliffs of the huge plateau in glowinglavender light. The cliffs themselves rose what seemed thousands of feet fromthe Azrith Plains, but what man had made atop them rose higher yet. Countlessroofs behind imposing walls collected together into the massive structure thatwas a city founded on the plateau. Low winter sunlight lent the soaring marblewalls and columns a warm glow.Jennsen had been little when her mother had taken her away. Her childhood memoryof having lived here had not prepared her adult sensibilities for the actualsplendor of the palace. The heart of D’Hara stood noble and proud, triumphantabove a barren land. Her awe was dimmed only by the taint of it also being theancestral home of the Lord Rahl.Jennsen swiped a hand over her face, closing her eyes briefly against herpounding headache, against what it meant to be the prey of Lord Rahl. It hadbeen a difficult and exhausting journey. After they had stopped each night,Sebastian used the cover of darkness to scout while she started to make camp. Anumber of times he had rushed back with the horrifying news that their pursuerswere closing in. Despite exhaustion and her tears of frustration, they had topack up and keep running.“I think we came here for a reason,” she finally answered. “Now is a poor timeto lose courage.”“Now is the last chance to lose courage.”She studied the note of caution in his blue eyes for only a moment beforeanswering by wading back into the moving river of people. Betty sprang to herfeet, peering up at the strangers as she pressed in close to Jennsen’s left leg.Sebastian moved in close on the other side.An older woman in a cart beside them smiled down at Jennsen. “Care to sell yourgoat, dear?”Jennsen, one hand grasping Betty’s rope along with Rusty’s reins, her otherholding the hood of her cloak closed against a cold gust of wind, smiled, butshook her head firmly to decline. As the woman in the horsedrawn cart returned adisappointed smile and started to move away, Jennsen saw a sign on the cartproclaiming sausages for sale.“Mistress? Are you here selling your sausages today?”The woman reached behind, pushed aside a lid, and stretched her hand into one ofthe kettles nestled snugly in blankets and cloth. She came up holding a fat coilof sausage.“Fresh cooked this morning. Could I interest you? Only a silver penny and wellworth it.”When Jennsen nodded eagerly, Sebastian passed the woman the coin requested. Hecut the sausage in two and handed half to Jennsen. It was wonderfully warm. Shequickly devoured a few bites, hardly taking the time to chew. It was a relief todull the sharp edge of her gnawing hunger. Only after those bites were down didshe begin to appreciate the taste.“It’s delicious,” she called up to the woman. The woman smiled, seeming not atall surprised at the compliment. Walking abreast with the cart, Jennsen asked,“Would you happen to know of a woman by the name of Althea?”Sebastian swept a furtive gaze around at the people walking within earshot. Thewoman, not at all shocked by the question, leaned down toward Jennsen.“You’ve come for a telling, then?”Although she couldn’t be sure, Jennsen thought it easy enough to guess what thewoman meant. “Yes, that’s right. Would you know where I can find her?”“Well, dear, I don’t know her, but I know of her husband, Friedrich. He comes tothe palace to sell his gilded carvings.”Many of the people moving up the road looked to have come to sell their wares.Jennsen dimly recalled when she was very young the palace being a buzz ofactivity, with throngs coming every day to sell everything from food to jewelry.Many towns near where Jennsen had lived when she was older had a market day. ThePeople’s Palace, though, was a city with the buying and selling of goods takingplace every day. She recalled her mother taking her to booths to buy food and,once, cloth for a dress.“Would you know where we can find this man, Friedrich, or someone else who knowsthe way?”The woman gestured ahead toward the palace. “Friedrich has a small booth in themarketplace. Up top. As I hear told, you’ll need to be invited out to seeAlthea. I’d advise you to talk to Friedrich, up top.”Sebastian put a hand on Jennsen’s back as he leaned past her. “Up top?” he askedthe woman.She nodded. “You know. Up top, where the palace is. I don’t go up there myself.”“Then where do you sell your sausages?” he asked.“Oh, I have my cart and horse, so I stay down along the road, selling to thosegoing to and from the palace. They won’t let you take those horses of yours up,if it be your intention to go look for Althea’s husband. Your goat, neither, forthat matter. There are ramps for horses inside for the soldiers and those withofficial business, but wagons with supplies and such mostly use the cliff roadon the east side. They don’t let just anyone ride their horses up. Only thesoldiers keep horses up top.”“Well,” Jennsen said, “I guess we’ll need to stable them, if we’re to go up tofind Althea’s husband.”“Friedrich doesn’t come often. You’ll be lucky to catch him on a day he’s here.Best, though, if you could talk to him.”Jennsen swallowed another mouthful of sausage. “Do you know if he would be heretoday? Or what days he does come to the palace?”“Sorry, dear, but I don’t.” The woman pulled an oversized red scarf over herhead and fastened it tight with a knot under her chin. “I see him now and then,that’s all I know. I sold him sausages a time or two to take home to his wife.”Jennsen glanced up at the looming People’s Palace. “I guess we’ll just have togo for a look, then.”They weren’t even inside, yet, and already Jennsen’s heart was pounding at afurious pace. She saw Sebastian’s fingers glide over his cloak, touching thehilt of his sword. She couldn’t resist brushing her forearm against her side,checking for the reassuring presence of her knife under her own cloak. Jennsenhoped not to be in the palace long. When they found out where Althea lived, theycould be on their way. The sooner the better.She wondered if Lord Rahl was at the palace, or off making war on Sebastian’shomeland. She felt great empathy for his people being at the mercy of LordRahl-a man she knew to be without a shred of mercy.On their journey to the People’s Palace, she had asked Sebastian about hishomeland. He had shared with her some of the convictions and beliefs of thepeople in the Old World, their sensitivity for the plight of their fellow man,and their longings for the blessings of the Creator. Sebastian spokepassionately about the beloved spiritual leader of the Old World, Brother Narev,and his disciples of Order, who taught that the welfare of others was not onlythe responsibility but also the sacred duty of all people. She had neverimagined a place with people who were so compassionate.Sebastian said that the Imperial Order was fighting back valiantly against LordRahl’s invaders. She, of all people, understood what it was to fear the man. Itwas that fear that worried Jennsen about going into the palace. She feared thatif Lord Rahl was there, his powers might somehow tell him that she was near.An orderly column of soldiers in chain mail and dark leather armor rode out,headed in the opposite direction. Their weapons-swords, axes, lances-flashedmenacingly in the morning sunlight. Jennsen kept her eyes turned to the groundahead and tried not to stare at the soldiers. She feared they could pick her outof the throng by sight, as if she were glowing with some mark only they couldsee. She kept the hood of her cloak pulled up to cover her red hair, fearingthat it would attract unwanted attention.As they drew near the great portals into the plateau the crowds grew thicker.Spread out on the Azrith Plains to the south of the cliffs, vendors had set uptheir stalls in makeshift streets. Those newly arrived settled in wherever theyfound room. Despite the cold, everyone seemed in a good mood as they went aboutsetting out their wares. Many were already doing a brisk business.D’Haran soldiers seemed to be everywhere. They were all big men, all wearing thesame orderly leather, chain mail, and wool uniforms. All were armed with atleast a sword, but most carried additional weapons-an axe, spiked mace, orknives. While the soldiers were alert and watchful, they didn’t appear to bebothering the merchants or hampering their business.The woman selling sausages waved her good wishes to Jennsen and Sebastian beforeshe pulled her cart off the road at an empty space beside three men setting outcasks of wine on a short table. The three men, with the same strong jaws, broadshoulders, and tousled blond hair, were obviously brothers.“Careful who you leave your animals with,” she called after them.Many of the people who set up their stands down on the plain had animals and itseemed easy enough to conduct business where they were, rather than go up to thepalace. Other people roamed the crowds, hawking items to passersby. Perhapstheir simple wares sold better to those come to the open-air market. Some, likethe woman with the cart, came to sell food they had cooked, and since there wereplenty of people down below they had no need to go up inside. Jennsen suspectedthat others were content to be away from what was sure to be the greaterscrutiny of officials and yet more guards in the palace proper.Sebastian took it all in without looking obvious. She imagined in his gaze arunning tally of troops. To others it would appear he was merely looking aboutat the merchants, enticed by the variety of wares for sale, but Jennsen saw thathis vision focused beyond, to the great portals between towering stone columns.“What should we do with the horses?” she asked. “And Betty?”Sebastian gestured to one of the enclosures where horses were picketed. “We’regoing to have to leave them.”In addition to being so close to the home of the man trying to kill her, Jennsendidn’t like being among the press of so many people. She felt so flush with thesense of danger that she couldn’t think straight. Leaving Betty at a stable in atown was one thing, but leaving her lifelong friend out here, among all thesepeople, was something else.She pointed with her chin to the scruffy men minding the livestock enclosure.They were busily engaged in a game of dice.“Do you think we can trust the animals to people like that? They could bethieves, for all we know. Maybe you could stay with the horses while I go lookfor Althea’s husband.”Sebastian turned back from his survey of the soldiers near the entrance. “Jenn,I don’t think it’s a good idea to separate in a place like this. Besides, Idon’t want you going in there alone.”She gauged the concern in his eyes. “And if we get into trouble? Do you reallythink we could fight our way out?”“No. You have to use your head-keep your wits about you. I’ve brought you thisfar, I’m not going to abandon you now and let you go in there alone.”“And if they draw swords on us?”“If it came to that, fighting wouldn’t save us in a place like this. It’s moreimportant to give people a worry, make them think twice about how dangerous youmight be, so that you don’t end up fighting in the first place. You have tobluff.”“I’m not any good at that kind of thing.”He grunted a short laugh. “You do it well enough. You did it with me that firstnight when you drew the Grace.”“But that was just with you, and with my mother there. That’s different than ina place with so many people.”“You did it at the inn in the way you showed the innkeeper your red hair. Yourmanner loosened her tongue. And, you kept the men at bay with nothing but yourbearing and a look. All by yourself you gave all those men worry enough thatthey left you alone.”She had never thought about it in that way. She viewed it more as simpledesperation than calculated deception.As Betty rubbed the top of her head against Jennsen’s leg, she idly stroked thegoat’s ear and watched as the men left their game of dice to take horses fromtravelers. She didn’t like the rough way the men handled the horses, usingswitches instead of a steady hand.Jennsen scanned the crush of people until she spotted the red scarf. She coiledthe slack out of Betty’s rope and started off, pulling Rusty along with her.Surprised, Sebastian stepped quickly to catch up.The woman in the red scarf was setting out pots with her sausages when Jennsenreached her. “Mistress?”She squinted in the sunlight. “Yes, dear? Some more sausages?” She lifted a lid.“They are good, aren’t they?”“Delicious, but I was wondering if you would accept a payment to watch ourhorses, and my goat.”The woman replaced the lid. “The animals? I’m not a stableman, dear.”Jennsen, holding the rope and the reins in one hand, rested her forearm on theside of the cart. Betty folded her legs and laid down beside the wheel. “Ithought you might like the company of my goat for a while. Betty is a fine goatand wouldn’t cause you any trouble.”The woman smiled as she peered down over the edge of her cart. “Betty, is it?Well, I could watch your goat, I guess.”Sebastian handed the woman a silver coin. “If we could picket our horses withyours, it would put our minds at ease that they were in good hands, and that youwere keeping an eye on them.”The woman carefully inspected the coin, then appraised Sebastian morecritically. “How long will you be? When I sell my sausages I’ll want to beheading home, after all.”“Not long,” Jennsen said. “We just want to go find the man you told usabout-Friedrich.”Sebastian, in an offhand manner, pointed at the coin the woman was stillholding. “When we get back, I’ll give you another to thank you for watching ouranimals. If we don’t get back until after your sausages are all sold, then I’llgive you two for your trouble of waiting on us.”Finally, the woman nodded. “All right, then. I’ll be here selling my sausages.Tie your goat to the wheel, there, and I’ll keep my eye on her until you getback.” She gestured over her shoulder. “And you can put your horses with mine,there. My old girl would enjoy the company.”Betty eagerly took the small chunk of carrot from Jennsen’s fingers. Rustynudged her shoulder, insistent that she not be left out, so Jennsen let thehorse have a piece of the rare treat, then passed a chunk to Sebastian so anever-eager Pete wouldn’t be left out.“If you lose track of where I am, just ask around for Irma, the sausage lady.”“Thank you, Irma.” Jennsen smoothed Betty’s ears. “I appreciate your help. We’llbe back before you know it.”As they mingled into the crowd funneling toward the great plateau, Sebastian puthis arm around her waist to keep her close beside him as he escorted her intothe gaping maw of Lord Rahl’s palace.Jennsen could hear in the distance Betty’s plaintive bleating at beingabandoned."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16Soldiers in polished breastplates, all carrying upright pikes with razor-sharpedges glinting in the sunlight, silently studied the people entering between thegreat columns. As their scrutiny turned toward Jennsen and Sebastian, she madesure not to look them in the eye. She kept her head down and moved in step withthe other people shuffling past the ranks of soldiers. She didn’t know if theypaid any particular attention to the two of them, but none reached out to seizeher, so she kept moving.The huge, cavelike entrance was lined in a light-colored stone, giving Jennsen asense of passing into a grand hall rather than through a tunnel into a plateauthe size of a mountain. Hissing torches in iron brackets set into the walls litthe way with a dotted line of light. The air smelled of burning pitch, but itfelt warm inside, out of the winter wind.To the sides, cut into the rock, were rows of rooms. Most were simple openingswith a short front wall behind which vendors sold their wares. Walls in many ofthe small rooms were decorated with brightly colored cloth or painted planks,offering a welcoming touch. It had appeared that anyone outside could set upshop and sell their goods. Jennsen imagined the vendors inside had to pay rentfor the rooms, but, in return, they had a warm and dry place in out of theweather to do business, where customers were more willing to linger.Clumps of chatting people waited near the shoemaker to have their shoesrepaired, while others lined up to buy ale, or bread, or steaming bowls of stew.Another man, with a singsong voice that attracted throngs to his booth, soldmeat pies. At one jammed and noisy place, women were having their hair pinnedup, or curled, or decorated with bits of colored glass set in fine chains. Atanother, they were having their faces made up, or their nails painted. Otherplaces sold beautiful ribbons, some cut to look just like fresh flowers, toadorn dresses. By the nature of many of the businesses, Jennsen realized that alot of the people wanted to look their best before going up to the palace, wherethey meant to be seen, as much as they meant to look.Sebastian seemed to find it all as astonishing as she did. Jennsen stopped at abooth with no customers, where a small man with a lasting smile was setting outpewter mugs.“Could you tell me, sir, if you know of a gilder named Friedrich?”“No man by that name down here. Finer work like that is usually sold up top.”As they were swallowed deeper into the underground entrance, Sebastian’s armreturned to enclose her waist. She found comfort in his close presence, hishandsome face, and those times he smiled at her. His spikes of white hair madehim different from everyone else-unique, special. His blue eyes seemed to holdso many answers to the mysteries of the larger world she had never seen. Healmost made her forget her heartache at missing her mother.A succession of massive iron doors stood open, admitting the advancing throng.It was intimidating going through such doors, knowing that if they closed shewould be trapped inside. Beyond, wide marble stairs, paler than straw andswirled through with white veins, led up to grand landings edged with massivestone balustrades. In contrast to the immense iron doors into the plateau,finely crafted wooden doors closed off some of the rooms. Whitewashed corridorswell lit by reflector lamps distracted from the feeling of being inside theplateau.The stairs seemed endless, in some places branching off in different directions.Some of the landings opened into spacious passageways, the destination for manyof the people. It was like a city in eternal night, lit by the wall lanternswith reflectors and pole lamps by the hundreds. Along the way were beautifulstone benches where people could rest. On some levels were more small shopsselling bread, cheeses, meats, some with tables and benches set outside. Ratherthan feeling dark and forbidding, it seemed cozy inside, perhaps even romantic.Some passageways, barred by huge doors and blocked by guards, appeared as ifthey might be barracks. In one place Jennsen glimpsed a spiral ramp with troopsmoving down on horseback.From her childhood, Jennsen only dimly recalled the city under the palace. Now,with the endless new sights, it was a place of wonder.As her legs grew weary from the effort of climbing the stairs and traversingpassageways, it occurred to her then why many of the people chose to remain downon the plain to do business; it was a long way up, both in distance and in time,and quite the labor. From the conversations she overheard, many of the peoplewho came would lengthen their stay at the palace that was a city by takingrooms.Jennsen and Sebastian were finally rewarded for their effort when they emergedonce again in the daylight. Three tiers of balconies fronted with roped columnssupporting arched openings looked down on the marble hall. Overhead, glassedwindows let in the light, creating a bright corridor unlike anything she hadever seen. If Jennsen was moved by the marvel of it, Sebastian seemedthunderstruck.“How could any people build a place such as this?” he whispered. “Why would theyeven want to?”Jennsen didn’t have an answer to either question. Yet, in spite of how much sheloathed those who ruled her land, the palace still filled her with awe. This wasa place built by people with vision and imagination beyond anything she couldconceive of.“With all the need in the world,” he murmured to himself, “the House of Rahlbuilds this marble monument to themselves.”She thought that there seemed to be many thousands other than the Lord Rahlhimself who benefited from the People’s Palace, those who derived their livingfrom what the palace brought together, people of all kinds, even down to Irmathe sausage lady, but Jennsen didn’t want to just then break her spell ofastonishment to try to explain it.The corridor, stretching off in both directions, was lined with rows of shopsset back under the balconies. Some were open, with a single craftsman, but manywere glass-fronted and quite ornate, with doors, signs hung out, and a number ofpeople working inside. The variety was overwhelming. Shopkeepers cut hair,pulled teeth, painted portraits, made clothes, and sold every sort of thing ascould be imagined, from common produce and herbs to priceless perfumes andjewels. The aromas from the wide variety of foods were distracting. The sightswere dizzying.As she was taking in those sights while looking for the gilder’s place, Jennsenspotted two women in brown leather uniforms. Each wore her long blond hair in asingle braid. She clutched Sebastian’s arm and hauled him into a sidepassageway. Without a word, she rushed him along, trying not to go so fast as tomake people suspicious, but at the same time get them out of sight as quickly aspossible. As soon as she reached the first of the huge pillars lining the sidehall, she ducked behind it, pulling Sebastian along with her. When peopleglanced their way, they both sat down on the stone bench against the wall,trying to look as normal as possible. A statue of a naked man across the waystared down at them as he leaned on a spear.Cautiously, casually, they both peeked out just enough to see. Jennsen watchedthe two leather-clad women stroll past the intersection; their gazes, cool,penetrating, intelligent, took in the people to both sides. These were the eyesof women that in an instant and without regret could decide between life anddeath. When one woman looked toward the side hall, Jennsen sank back behind thepillar, pressing herself up against the wall. She was relieved to finally seethe backs of the two as they continued down the main corridor.“What was that all about?” Sebastian asked as she let out a relieved sigh.“Mord-Sith.”“What?”“Those two women. They were Mord-Sith.”Sebastian carefully peered out for another look, but the two were gone. “I don’tknow much about them, except that they’re guards of some kind.”She realized, then, that being from another land he might not know much aboutthose women. “Yes, in a way. Mord-Sith are very special guards. They are theLord Rahl’s personal guards, I guess. They protect him, and more. They tortureinformation out of gifted people.”He gauged the demeanor in her eyes. “You mean those with simple magic. ““Any magic. Even a sorceress. Even a wizard.”He looked skeptical. “A wizard commands powerful magic. He could simply use hispower to crush those women.”Jennsen’s mother had told her about Mord-Sith, how dangerous they were, and thatshe must avoid them at all cost. Her mother never tried to hide the nature ofdeadly threats.“No. Mord-Sith have a power that enables them to appropriate another’s magic,even a wizard or a sorceress. They capture not only the person, but their magic,as well. There can be no escape from a Mord-Sith unless she releases theperson.”Sebastian seemed only more confused. “What do you mean they appropriateanother’s magic? That makes no sense. What could they do with such magic if itwere another’s power? That would be like pulling out someone’s teeth and tryingto eat with them.”Jennsen swept her hand back over her head, under her hood, replacing the redringlets that had fallen out. “I don’t know, Sebastian. I’ve heard that they usethe person’s own magic against them, to hurt them-to give them pain.”“Then why should we be afraid of them?”“They may torture information out of the gifted enemies of Lord Rahl, but theycan hurt anyone. Did you see the weapon they carry?”“No. I saw no weapon on them. They only carried a small, red leather rod.”“That is their weapon. It’s called an Agiel. They keep it on a chain aroundtheir wrist so it is always at hand. It’s a weapon of magic.”He considered what she said, but clearly didn’t yet understand it. “What do theydo with it, with their Agiel?”His manner had turned from incredulity to a more calm, analytical questioningfor information. He was once again doing the job Jagang the Just had sent him todo.“I’m no expert on the subject, but from what I’ve heard, the mere touch of anAgiel can do anything from causing inconceivable pain, to breaking bones, toinstant death. The Mord-Sith decides how much pain, if the bones are to break,and whether or not you are to die by the touch.”He watched out toward the intersection as he considered what she’d said. “Whyare you so afraid of them? And if you have only heard these things, why do youfear them so?”Now she was the one who was incredulous. “Sebastian, Lord Rahl has been huntingme my whole life. These women are his personal killers. Don’t you think theywould love to bring me to the feet of their master?”“I suppose.”“At least they were wearing their brown leather. They wear red leather when theysense a threat, or when they torture someone. In red leather the blood doesn’tshow so much.”He slid both hands over his eyes and then back over his white spikes of hair.“This is a nightmare land you live in, Jennsen Daggett.”Jennsen Rahl, she almost corrected out of self-pity. Jennsen from her mother,Rahl from her father.“Do you think I don’t know it?”“And what if this sorceress doesn’t want to help you?”She picked at a thread on her knee. “I don’t know.”“He will come after you. Lord Rahl will never let you be. You will never befree.”... unless you kill him were the words she could hear left off.“Althea must help me ... I’m so sick of being afraid,” Jennsen said, near tears,“so sick of running.”He put a gentle hand on her shoulder. “I understand.”No two words could have been more meaningful at that moment. She could only nodher appreciation.His tone turned more impassioned. “Jennsen, we have gifted women like Althea.They’re from a sect, the Sisters of the Light, that used to live at the Palaceof the Prophets in the Old World. Richard Rahl, when he invaded the Old World,destroyed their palace. It was said to be a beautiful and special place, but hedestroyed it. Now the Sisters are with Emperor Jagang, helping him. Maybe oursorceresses would be able to help you, too. “She looked up into his caring eyes. “Really? Maybe those with the emperor wouldknow a way to hide me from my murderous half brother’s wizardry? ... But he’salways only a half step behind, waiting for me to stumble so he can pounce.Sebastian, I don’t think I could make it that far. Althea helped hide me fromLord Rahl once. I must convince her to help me again. If she won’t, I fear I’llhave no chance before I’m caught.”He leaned out again, checking, then gave her a confident smile. “We’ll findAlthea. Her magic will hide you and then you can get away.”Feeling better, she returned the smile.Judging that the Mord-Sith were gone and it was safe, they returned to the hallto search for Friedrich. They each inquired at several places before Jennsenfound someone who knew of the gilder. With fresh hope, she and Sebastian moveddeeper into the palace, following the directions they were given, to a junctureof grand passageways.There, in the center of the intersection of two central corridors, she wassurprised to see a quiet plaza with a square pool of dark water. Tiles, ratherthan the usual marble, surrounded the pool. Four columns at the outer edge ofthe tiles supported the soaring opening to the sky, covered, since it waswinter, by leaded glass panels. The beveled glass gave the light cast downacross the tiles a shimmering, liquid quality.In the pool, off center in a way that seemed right without Jennsen understandingexactly why it felt right, stood a dark pitted rock with a bell atop it. It wasa remarkably quiet sanctuary in the center of such a busy place.Seeing the square with the bell sparked her memory of similar places. When thebell tolled, she recalled, the people came to such squares to bow down and chanta devotion to the Lord Rahl. She suspected that such homage was one price paidfor the honor of being allowed in his palace.People sat on the low wall around the edge, talking in hushed tones, watchingorange fish gliding through the dark water. Even Sebastian stared for a fewminutes before moving on.Everywhere, there were alert soldiers. Some seemed to be stationed at key spots.Squads of guards moved through the halls, watching everyone, stopping somepeople to speak with them. What the soldiers asked, Jennsen didn’t know, but itworried her greatly.“What do we say if they question us?” she asked.“It’s best not to say anything unless you have to.”“But if you have to, then what?”“Tell them that we live on a farm to the south. Farmers are isolated and don’tknow much about anything but life on their farm, so it wouldn’t sound suspiciousif we say we don’t know about anything else. We came to see the palace andperhaps buy a few small things-herbs and such.”Jennsen had met farmers, and didn’t think they were as ignorant of things asSebastian seemed to think. “Farmers grow or collect their own herbs,” she said.“I don’t think they would need to come to the palace to buy them.”“Well, then ... we came to buy some nice cloth so you could make clothes for thebaby.”“Baby? What baby?”“Your baby. You are my wife and only recently found yourself pregnant. You arewith child.”Jennsen felt her face flush to red. She couldn’t say she was pregnant, thatwould only lead to more questions.“All right. We’re farmers, here to buy a few small things-herbs and such. Rareherbs we don’t grow ourselves.”His only answer was a sideways glance and a smile. His arm returned to herwaist, as if to banish her embarrassment.Beyond another intersection of wide passageways, following the directions they’dbeen given, they turned down another hall to the right. It, too, was lined withvendors. Jennsen immediately spotted the booth with a gilded star hanging beforeit. She didn’t know if it was intentional or not, but the gilded star had eightpoints, like the star in a Grace. She had drawn the Grace often enough to know.With Sebastian at her side, she rushed over to the booth. Her heart sank whenthey found the place occupied only by an empty chair, but it was still morning,and she reasoned that maybe he hadn’t come in yet. The closest businessesweren’t yet open, either.She stopped several stalls down at a place selling leather mugs. “Do you know ifthe gilder is here today?” she asked the man working behind the bench.“Sorry, don’t know,” he said without looking up from his work at cuttingdecorations with a fine gouge. “I just started here.”She hurried down to the next occupied booth, a place that sold hangings withcolorful scenes sewn on them. She turned to say something to Sebastian, but sawhim inquiring at another booth not far away.The woman behind the short counter was sewing a blue brook through mountainsstitched on a stretched square of coarsely woven cloth. Some of the scenes weremade up into pillows displayed on a rack to the back.“Mistress, would you know if the gilder is here, today?”The woman smiled up at her. “Sorry, but far as I know, he won’t be in today. ““Oh, I see.” Thwarted by the disappointing news, Jennsen hesitated, not knowingwhat to do next. “Would you know when he will return, at least?”The woman pushed her needle through, making a blue stitch of water. “No, can’tsay as I do. Last time I saw him, over a week ago, he said he may not be backfor a while.”“Why is that? Do you know?”“Can’t say as I do.” She pulled the long thread of the water out taut.“Sometimes he stays away for a spell, working at his gilding, doing up enough tomake it worth his time to travel to the palace.”“Would you happen to know where he lives?”The woman glanced up from under a crinkled brow. “Why do you wish to know?”Jennsen’s mind raced. She said the only thing she could think of-what she hadlearned from Irma, the sausage lady watching Betty for her. “I wish to go for atelling.”“Ah,” The woman said, her suspicion fading as she pulled another stitch through.“It’s Althea, then, that you really want to see.”Jennsen nodded. “My mother took me to Althea when I was young. Since my mother... passed away, I’d like to visit Althea again. I thought it might be a comfortif I went for a telling.”“Sorry about your mother, dear. I know what you mean. When I lost my mother, itwas a hard time for me, too.”“Could you tell me how to find Althea’s place?”She set her sewing down and came to the low wall at the front of her booth.“It’s a goodly ways to Althea’s place-to the west, through a desolate land.”“The Azrith Plains.”“That’s right. Going west, the land turns rugged, with mountains. Around theother side of the largest snowcapped mountain due west of here, if you turnnorth, staying just the other side of the cliffs you will find, following thelow land down lower yet, you will come into a nasty place. A swampy place.Althea and Friedrich live there.”“In a swamp? But not in the winter.”The woman leaned close and lowered her voice. “Yes, even in the winter, peoplesay. Althea’s swamp. A vile place it is, too. Some say it isn’t a natural place,if you know what I mean.”“Her ... magic, you mean?”She shrugged. “Some say.”Jennsen nodded in thanks and repeated the directions. “Other side of the largestsnowcapped peak west of here, stay below the cliffs and go north. Down in aswampy place.”“A nasty, dangerous, swampy place.” The woman used a long fingernail to scratchher scalp. “But you don’t want to be going there unless you’re invited.”Jennsen glanced around briefly, to signal to Sebastian, but she didn’t see himright off. “How does one get invited?”“Most people ask Friedrich. I see them come here to talk to him and leavewithout even looking at his work. I guess he asks Althea if she will see them,and the next time he returns with his gilding, he invites them. Sometimes,people give him a letter to take to his wife.“Some people travel out there and wait. I hear that sometimes he comes out ofthe swamp to meet those people and pass along Althea’s invitation.Some people return from the edge of the swamp without ever being invited in,their long wait for nothing. None dare venture in uninvited, though. Least, nonethat did ever came back to tell about it, if you know what I mean.”“Are you saying I’ll have to go there and just wait? Wait until she or herhusband comes to invite us in?”“Guess so. But it won’t be Althea who comes out. She never comes out of herswamp, as I hear it. You could come back here each day until Friedrich finallyreturns to sell his gilding. He’s never been away for more than a month. I’d sayhe’ll be back to the palace within a few weeks, at most. “Weeks. Jennsen couldn’t stay in one place, waiting weeks, while Lord Rahl’s menhunted her, closing in day by day. From as close as Sebastian said they were,she didn’t think she even had days, much less weeks, before they would have her.“Thank you, then, for all your help. I guess I’ll come back another day to seeif Friedrich has returned and ask him if I might go for a telling.”The woman smiled as she sat back down and picked up her sewing. “That might bebest.” She looked up. “Sorry to hear about your mother, dear. It’s hard, Iknow.”She nodded, her eyes watery, fearing to test her voice just then. The vividscene flashed through her mind. The men, the blood everywhere, the terror ofthem coming for her, seeing her mother slumped on the floor, stabbed, her armsevered. With effort, Jennsen pushed the memory away, lest it consume her ingrief and anger.She had immediate worries. They had made a long and difficult journey in winterto find Althea, to obtain her help. They couldn’t wait around, hoping to beinvited to visit Althea-Lord Rahl’s men were close on their heels. The last timeJennsen had wavered in her determination she had missed her chance-and Latheahad been murdered. The same thing could happen again. She had to get to Altheabefore those men did, at least to tell her about her sister, to warn her, ifnothing else.Jennsen scanned the vast hallway, searching for Sebastian. He couldn’t have gonefar. She saw him, then, his back to her, across the broad corridor, just turningaway from a place that sold silver jewelry.Before she took two steps, she saw soldiers swarm in and surround him. Jennsenfroze in her tracks. Sebastian did, too. One of the soldiers used his sword tocarefully lift back Sebastian’s cloak, uncovering his array of weapons. She wastoo frightened to move, to take another step.Half a dozen gleaming razor-edged pikes lowered at Sebastian. Swords came out ofsheaths. People nearby backed away, others turned to look. In the center of aring of D’Haran soldiers towering over him, Sebastian held his arms out to thesides in surrender.Surrender.Just then a bell, the one back at the square, tolled."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17The single long peal of the bell calling people to the devotion echoed throughthe cavernous halls as two of the big men seized Sebastian by the arms andstarted bearing him away. Jennsen watched helplessly as the rest of the D’Haransoldiers surrounded him in a tight formation bristling with steel meant not onlyto keep their prisoner at bay, but to ward any possible attempt to extricatehim. It was immediately clear to her that these guards were prepared for anyeventuality and took no chances, not knowing if this one armed man might signifya force about to storm the palace.Jennsen saw that there were other men, visitors to the palace like Sebastian,also carrying swords. Perhaps it was that Sebastian carried a variety of combatweapons, and they were all concealed, that so raised the soldiers’ suspicions.But he wasn’t doing anything. It was winter-of course he was wearing a cloak. Hewas causing no harm. Jennsen’s urge was to yell at the soldiers to leave him be,yet she feared that if she did they would take her, too.The people who had spread back away from the potential trouble, along witheveryone else strolling the halls, all began moving toward the square. People inthe shops set down their work to join them. No one paid much attention to thesoldiers’ business. In response to that single chime still hanging in the air,laughter and talking trailed off to respectful whispers.Panic clawed at Jennsen as she saw the soldiers muscling Sebastian down a hallto the side. She could see his white hair amid the dark armor. She didn’t knowwhat to do. This wasn’t supposed to happen. They only came to find a gilder. Shewanted to scream for the soldiers to stop. She dared not, though.Jennsen.Jennsen stood her ground against the current of bodies, trying to keep Sebastianand his captors in sight. The Lord Rahl was after her, and now they hadSebastian. Her mother had been murdered, and now they were taking Sebastian. Itwasn’t fair.As she watched, afraid to do anything to stop the soldiers, her own fear shamedher. Sebastian had done so much for her. He had made so many sacrifices for her.He had risked his life to save hers.Jennsen’s breath came in ragged pulls. But what could she do?Surrender.It wasn’t fair what they were doing to Sebastian, to her, to innocent people.Anger welled up through her fear.Tu vash misht.He was only there because of her. She had asked him to come.Tu vask misht.Now, he was in trouble.Grushdeva du kalt misht.The words sounded so right. They flared through her, carried on flames ofigniting rage.People pushed against her. She growled through gritted teeth as she squeezed herway among the crush of people, trying to follow the soldiers who had Sebastian.It wasn’t fair. She wanted them to stop. Just stop. Stop.Her helplessness frustrated her. She was sick of it. When they wouldn’t stop,when they kept going, it only further enraged her.Surrender.Jennsen’s hand slid inside her cloak. The touch of cold steel welcomed her. Herfingers tightened around the hilt of her knife. She could feel the worked metalof the symbol of the House of Rahl pressing into the flesh of her palm.A soldier gently pushed her, turning her in the direction of the rest of thecrowd. “The devotion square is that way, ma’am.”It was spoken as a suggestion, but wrapped around the core of command.Through the rage, she looked up into his hooded eyes. She saw the dead man’seyes. She saw the soldiers at her house-men on the floor dead, men coming forher, men grabbing her. She saw flashes of movement through a crimson sheen ofblood.As she and the soldier stared into each other’s eyes, she felt the blade at herwaist coming out of its sheath.A hand under her arm tugged at her. “This way, dear. I’ll show you where it is.”Jennsen blinked. It was the lady who had given her directions to Althea’s place.The woman who sat in the palace of the murdering bastard Lord Rahl and sewed thepeaceful scenes of the mountains and brooks.Jennsen stared at the woman, at her inexplicable smile, trying to make sense ofher. Jennsen found everything around her strangely incomprehensible. She onlyknew that her hand was on the hilt of her knife and she longed for the blade tobe free.But, for some reason, the knife stubbornly remained where it was.Jennsen, at first convinced that some malevolent magic had seized her, saw thenthat the woman had a tight, motherly arm around her. Without realizing it, thewoman was keeping Jennsen’s blade in its sheath. Jennsen locked her knees,resisting being pulled along.The woman’s eyes, now, were set with warning. “No one misses a devotion, dear.No one. Let me show you where it is.”The soldier, his expression grim, watched as Jennsen yielded, allowing herselfto be guided by the woman. Jennsen and the woman, swept into the current ofpeople moving toward the square, left the soldier behind. She looked up into thewoman’s smiling face. The whole world seemed to Jennsen to be swimming in astrange light. The voices around her were a smear of sound that in her mind waspierced by the echoes of screams from her house.Jennsen.Through the murmuring around her, the voice, sharp and distinct, caught herattention. Jennsen listened, alert to what it might tell her.Surrender your will, Jennsen.It made sense, in a visceral way.Surrender your flesh.Nothing else seemed to matter anymore. Nothing she had tried in her whole lifehad brought her salvation, or safety, or peace. To the contrary, everythingseemed lost. There seemed nothing else to lose.“Here we are, dear,” the woman said.Jennsen looked around. “What?”“Here we are.”Jennsen felt her knees touch the tiled floor as the woman urged her down. Peoplewere all around. Before them was the square with the pool of quiet water at itscenter. She wanted only the voice.Jennsen. Surrender.The voice had grown harsh, commanding. It fanned the flames of her anger, herrage, her wrath.Jennsen bent forward, trembling, in the grip of rage. Somewhere, in the farcorners of her mind, screamed a distant terror. Despite that remote sense offoreboding, it was rage that was carrying her will away.Surrender!She saw strings of her saliva hanging, dripping, as she panted through partedlips. Tears dropped to the tiles close beneath her face. Her nose ran. Herbreath came in gasps. Her eyes were opened so wide it hurt. She shook all over,as if alone in the coldest darkest winter night. She couldn’t make herself stop.People bowed forward deeply, hands pressed to the tiles. She wanted her knifeout.Jennsen lusted for the voice.“Master Rahl guide us. “It was not the voice. It was the people all around, in one voice, chanting thedevotion. As they began, they all bowed farther forward until their foreheadstouched the tile floor. A soldier moved past close behind, patrolling, watchingas she knelt, bent over, hands to the floor, quaking uncontrollably.Inch by halting inch, as she gasped, panted, shook, Jennsen’s head lowered untilher forehead touched the floor.“Master Rahl teach us. “That was not what she wanted to hear.She wanted the voice. She raged for it. She wanted her knife. She wanted blood.“Master Rahl protect us, “ the people all chanted in unison.Jennsen, pulling ragged jerking breaths, consumed with loathing, wanted only thevoice, and her blade free. But her palms were flat on the tiles.She listened for the voice, but heard only the chant of the devotion.“In your light we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we arehumbled. We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”At first, Jennsen only vaguely remembered it from her youth, from when she hadlived at the palace. Hearing it now, that memory came flooding back. She hadknown the words. She had chanted them when she was little. When they fled thepalace, running from Lord Rahl, she had banished the words of the devotion tothe man who was trying to kill her and her mother.Now, hungering for the voice that wanted her to surrender, almost unbeknownst toher, almost as if it were someone else doing it, her trembling lips began movingwith the words.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”The cadence of those murmured words filled the great hall, many people but onevoice resounding powerfully off the walls. She listened with all her strengthfor the voice that had been her companion for nearly as long as she couldremember, but it wasn’t there.Now, Jennsen was helplessly carried along with all the others. She clearly heardherself speaking the words.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Over and over Jennsen softly spoke the words of the devotion along with everyoneelse. Over and over, without pause but for breath. Over and over, yet withouthaste.The chant filled her mind. It beckoned to her, spoke to her. It was all thatfilled her thoughts as she chanted it over and over and over. It filled her socompletely that it left no room for anything else.Somehow, it calmed her.Time slipped by, incidental, inconspicuous, unimportant.Somehow, the soft chant brought her a sense of peace. It reminded her of howBetty calmed when having her ears smoothed. Jennsen’s rage was being smoothed.She fought against it, but, bit by bit, she was pulled into the chant, into itspromise, smoothed and gentled.She understood, then, why it was called a devotion.Despite everything, it drained her, and then filled her with a profound calm, aserene sense of belonging.She no longer fought the words. She allowed herself to whisper them, lettingthem lift away the shards of pain. For that time, as she knelt, her head to thetiles, with nothing to do but say the words, she was free of anything andeverything.As she chanted along with everyone else, the shadow cast on the floor from themullions of the leaded glass overhead moved past her, leaving her in the glow ofthe full sun. It felt warm and protective. It felt like her mother’s warmembrace. Her body felt light. The soft radiance all around reminded Jennsen ofhow she pictured the good spirits.An instant in time later, the hours of chanting were ended.Jennsen uncurled, slowly pushing away from the floor, to sit up with the others.Without warning, a sob poured forth.“Anything wrong, here?”There was a soldier towering over her.The woman to the side put an arm around Jennsen’s shoulders.“Her mother passed away recently,” the woman quietly explained.The soldier shifted his weight, looking ill at ease.“I’m sorry, ma’am. My heartfelt sympathy to you and your family.”Jennsen saw in his blue eyes that he meant every word.Stunned speechless, she watched as he turned, huge and muscular, layered inleather, Lord Rahl’s killer continuing on his patrol. Empathy in armor. If heknew who she was, he would deliver her into the hands of those who would see toit that she suffered a long and lingering death.Jennsen buried her face in the stranger’s shoulder and wept for her mother,whose embrace had felt so good.She missed her mother beyond endurance. And now, she was terrified forSebastian."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18Jennsen thanked the woman who sewed country scenes and gave directions. Onlyafter Jennsen had started down the hall did she realize that she didn’t evenknow the woman’s name. It didn’t really matter. They both had mothers. Bothunderstood and shared the same feelings.Now that the devotion was over, the noise of all the people in the palace roseagain to resound off marble walls and columns. Laughter could be heard ringingout across the hall. People had gone back to their own concerns, buying,trading, discussing their wants and needs. Guards patrolled, and palace staff,most in light-colored robes, went about their business, carrying messages,seeing to matters Jennsen could only guess at. In one place, workers were at thetask of repairing the hinges on a huge oak double door to a side passageway.The cleaning staff was back, too, busy at dusting, mopping, polishing. Jennsen’smother had once been one of those women, seeing to the work in the sections ofthe palace closed off to the public, official rooms where matters of governancewere conducted, the sections that housed the officials and palace staff, and, ofcourse, Lord Rahl’s rooms.After chanting the devotion for hours, Jennsen’s mind was as clear as if she hadhad a long and needed rest. In that calm but refreshed and wide-awake state, asolution had come to her. She knew what she had to do.She moved quickly, back the way she had come. There was no time to lose. Onbalconies above, people who lived at the People’s Palace gazed down on the hallas they went about their work, watching those who had come to marvel at thegreat place. Jennsen focused on keeping her wits about her as she moved throughthe throngs.Sebastian had warned her not to run and cause people to wonder if there wassomething wrong. He had cautioned her to act normal, lest she give people reasonto take note. Yet, so acute was the danger of being at the palace, that he hadbeen captured despite knowing how to act. If she raised suspicion, then soldierswould surely stop her. If the soldiers got ahold of her, and found out who shewas ...Jennsen ached to have Sebastian back. Her fear for him urged her down the hall.She had to get him away from the D’Haran soldiers before they did somethingterrible to him. She knew that every minute they had him, he was in mortaldanger.If they tortured him, he might not be able to hold out. If he confessed to whohe was, they would put him to death. The thought of Sebastian being executedalmost made her knees give out. Under torture, people would confess to anything,whether true or not. If they decided to torture him to make him confess tosomething, he was doomed. The mental image of Sebastian being tortured made hersick and dizzy.She had to rescue him.But to do that, she had to have the sorceress’s help. If Althea would help her,cast Jennsen a protective spell, then she could try to get Sebastian back.Althea had to help her. Jennsen would convince her. Sebastian’s life hung in thebalance.She reached the stairs where they had come up. People were still emptying upinto the hall, some sweating and buffing with the effort of the climb. Few weregoing down, yet. Standing at the edge, hand on the marble rail, she took acareful look around, making sure she wasn’t being followed or observed. Despiteher urge to run, she made herself look around casualty. Some people looked ather, but no more than they looked at anyone. Patrolling soldiers were a gooddistance off. Jennsen started down.She went as quickly as possible without looking like she was running for herlife-for Sebastian’s life. But she was. If not for Jennsen, he would not be inthis trouble.She thought that going down would be easy, but after hundreds of steps she foundthat going down was tiring on the legs. Her legs burned with the effort. Shetold herself that if she couldn’t run, she could at least not stop but keepgoing and in that way make better time.On the landings, she cut the corners, saving steps. When no one was looking, shetook the stairs two at a time. When she had to traverse passageways, she triedto screen herself behind clumps of people as she went past watchful guards.People sitting on benches, eating bread and meat pies, drinking ale, talkingwith friends, casually noted her along with everyone else who passed, justanother visitor going by.Lord Rahl’s half sister among them.On the steps again, she went quickly, her legs trembling from the nonstopeffort. Her muscles burned with the need of a rest, but she gave them none.Instead, she pushed faster when she had the chance. On an empty flight of stairsbetween two landings screened from sight because they turned from differentdirections, Jennsen raced recklessly down. She slowed again when a couple, armin arm, their heads close together as they giggled over whispered words, reachedthe landing below and headed up.The air grew colder as she descended. On one level, with guards thick as fliesin a barn in spring, one of the soldiers looked right into her eyes and smiled.Stunned to a stop for an instant, she realized that he was smiling at her as aman smiled at a woman, not as a killer smiled at his victim. She returned thesmile, polite, warm, but not so much as to give the impression that she wasencouraging him. Jennsen pulled her cloak tight and turned down the next flightof stairs. When she glanced over her shoulder as she turned the corner on alanding, he stood above, one hand on the rail, watching her. He smiled again andwaved a farewell before turning back to his duties.Unable to contain her fear, Jennsen sprinted down the stairs two at a time andran down the hall, past small stands selling food, brooches, and finelydecorated daggers, past visitors sitting on stone benches set before the marblebalustrade, on toward the next flight of stairs, until she realized that peoplewere staring at her. She stopped running and fell casually into walking, tryingto flounce to make it look as if she had just been dashing from youthfulvivacity. The tactic worked. She saw the people who had been eyeing her seem tochalk it up as nothing more than a spirited girl dashing along. They turned backto their own business. Since it worked, Jennsen intermittently used the sametrick and was able to make better time.Breathing hard from the long descent, she finally made it to the cavelikeentrance with the hissing torches. Since there were so many soldiers at theportal into the great plateau, she slowed and walked close behind an oldercouple to make it look as if she might be a daughter with her parents. Thecouple was engaged in a spirited debate of a friend’s chances of making a go ofit with his new shop selling wigs up in the palace. The woman thought it a goodbusiness. The man thought his friend would run out of willing sellers of theirhair and would end up spending too much of his time looking for more.Jennsen could imagine no more foolish conversation when a man had been takenprisoner and was about to be tortured and probably put to death. To Jennsen, theD’Haran palace was nothing more than a vile death trap. She had to get Sebastianout of there. She would get him out.Neither one of the couple noticed Jennsen close behind, head bowed, matchingtheir slow pace. The gaze of guards skimmed over the three of them. At the mouthof the opening, cold wind swept in to take the breath from Jennsen’s lungs.After being in the lamplit darkness for so long, she had to squint at theexpanse of bright daylight. As soon as they were in the open-air market, sheturned down one of the makeshift streets, hurrying to find Irma, the sausagelady.Stretching her neck, she looked about for the red scarf as she rushed down therows of stalls. The places that before had seemed so splendid now looked shabbyafter she had been in the palace. In the whole of her life, Jennsen had neverseen anything like the People’s Palace. She could not imagine how a place ofsuch beauty could hold such ugliness as the House of Rahl.A hawker pushed in close. “Charms, for the lady? Good luck for sure.” Jennsenkept walking. His breath stank. “Special charms with magic. Can’t go wrong for asilver penny.”“No, thank you.”He walked sideways, right close in front of her but off to the side a bit. “Justa silver penny, my lady.”She thought she would trip over the man’s feet. “No, thank you. Please leave mebe, now.”“A copper penny, then.”“No.” Jennsen shoved him each time he bumped into her as he pushed in close,yammering about his charms. He kept putting his face in front of hers, lookingback up at her as he stooped and shuffled along, grinning at her.“Good charms, they are, my lady.” He kept bumping her as she tried to walk, asshe craned her neck, looking for the red scarf. “Good luck for you.“No, I said.” Almost stumbling over the man, she gave him a stiff shove.“Please, leave me be!”Jennsen sighed in relief as an older man came past going in the oppositedirection and the hawker turned to him. She could hear his voice fade behind,trying to sell the man a magic charm for a silver penny. She thought about theirony that here this man was offering magic, and she turned it down because shewas in a hurry to be off to try to get magic from someone else.Past an empty space, before a table with wine casks, Jennsen halted abruptly.She looked up and saw the three brothers. One was pouring wine into a leathergoblet for a customer while the other two were lifting a full cask from the backof their wagon.Jennsen turned and stared at the empty place. That was where Irma had been. Herheart felt as if it came up in her throat. Irma had their horses. Irma hadBetty.In a panic, she seized the arm of the man behind the table as the customerdeparted.“Please, could you tell me where Irma is?”He looked up, squinting in the sunlight. “The sausage lady?”Jennsen nodded. “Yes. Where is she? She couldn’t be gone already. She had hersausages to sell.”The man grinned. “She said that being beside us, selling our wine, had helpedsell her sausages faster than she ever sold them before.”Jennsen could only stare. “She’s gone?”“Too bad, too. Having sausages for sale next to us really helped sell wine.People ate those spicy goat sausages of hers and had to have some of our wine.”“Her what?” Jennsen whispered.The man’s smile flagged. “Her sausages. What’s wrong, ma’am? You look as if aspirit from the underworld just tapped you on the shoulder.”“What did you say she sells? ... Goat sausages?”He nodded, looking concerned. “Among others. I tried them all, but I liked thespicy goat sausages best.” He lifted a thumb over his shoulder, indicating histwo brothers. “Joe liked her beef sausages best, and Clayton, well he liked thepork, but I favored her goat sausages.”Jennsen was shivering and it wasn’t the cold. “Where is she? I have to findher!”The man scratched his head of disheveled blond hair. “I’m sorry, but I don’tknow. She comes here to sell sausages. Most folks around here have seen herbefore. She’s a nice lady, always a smile and a good word.”Jennsen felt freezing tears run down her cheeks. “But where is she? Where doesshe live? I have to find her.”The man grasped Jennsen’s arm, as if fearing she might fall. “Sorry, ma’am, butI don’t know. Why? What’s wrong?”“She has my animals. My horses. And Betty.”“Betty?”“My goat. She has them. We paid her to watch them until we got back.”“Oh.” He looked gloomy to have no better news for her. “Sorry. Her sausagespretty much sold steady till they were gone. It usually takes her all day longto sell what she cooks up, but sometimes it just goes better, I guess. After hersausages were gone, she sat around and talked to us for a long spell. Finally,she let out a sigh, and said she had to get home.”Jennsen’s mind raced. The world felt as if it were spinning around her. Shedidn’t know what to do. She felt dazed, confused. Jennsen had never felt soalone.“Please,” she said, her voice choked with tears, “please, could I rent one ofyour horses?”“Our horses? Then how would we get our wagon home? Besides, they’re drafthorses. We don’t have any saddle or tack for riding or any-”“Please! I have gold.” Jennsen groped at her belt. “I can pay.”Feeling around at her waist, she couldn’t find her small leather pouch with hergold and silver coins. Jennsen threw back her cloak, searching. There, on herbelt, beside her knife, she found only a small piece of a leather thong, partedcleanly.“My purse ... my purse is gone.” She couldn’t get her breath. “My money . . .”The man’s face sagged with sorrow as he watched her pull the remnant of thedrawstring from her belt. “There are wicked people prowling around, looking tosteal-”“But I need it.”He fell silent. She looked back behind, searching for the hawker selling charms.It all flashed back through her mind. He had bumped into her, jostled her. Hewas really cutting her purse. She couldn’t even recall what he looked like-justthat he was scruffy and ill kept. She hadn’t wanted to look at his face, meethis eyes. She couldn’t seem to get her breath as she frantically looked this wayand that, trying to find the man who had stolen her money.“No . . .” she whined, too overcome to know what to say. “No, oh please no.” Shesank down, sitting on the ground beside the table. “I need a horse. Dearspirits, I need a horse.”The man hurriedly poured wine in a cup and squatted down beside her as shesobbed. “Here, drink this.”“I have no money,” she managed to get out as she wept.“No charge,” he said, giving her a sympathetic, lopsided smile of straight whiteteeth. “It’ll help. Drink it down.”The other two blond-headed brothers, Joe and Clayton, stood behind the table,hands in their pockets, heads lowered with regret for the woman their brotherwas tending to.The man tipped the cup up, trying to get her to drink as she cried. Some spilleddown her chin, some went in her mouth and she had to swallow it.“Why do you need a horse?” the man asked.“I have to get to Althea’s place.”“Althea? The old sorceress?”Jennsen nodded as she wiped wine from her chin and tears from her cheeks.“Have you been invited out there?”“No,” Jennsen admitted. “But I have to go.”“Why?”“It’s a matter of life or death. I need Althea’s help or a man could die.”Crouching beside her, still holding the cup he’d used to give her a drink, hiseyes turned from looking into hers to take in her ringlets of red hair under herhood.The big man put his hands on his knees and stood, going back to his brothers tolet her be as she tried but failed to halt her desperate tears. Jennsen weptwith worry for Betty, too. Betty was Jennsen’s friend and companion, and aconnection to her mother. The poor goat probably felt abandoned and unloved.Jennsen would give anything, just then, to see Betty’s little upright tailwagging.She told herself that she couldn’t just sit there acting like a child. It wouldaccomplish nothing. She had to do something. There could be no help in theshadow of Lord Rahl’s palace, and she had no money to help her. She couldn’tdepend on anyone--except Sebastian, and he had no hope of help but from her. Nowhis life depended on her actions alone. She couldn’t sit there feeling sorry forherself. If her mother had taught her anything, she had taught Jennsen betterthan this.She had no idea what to do to rescue Betty, but she at least knew what she hadto attempt in order to help Sebastian. That was what was most important, andwhat she had to do. She was wasting precious time.Jennsen stood, angrily wiping the tears from her face, and then put a hand toher brow to shield her eyes from the sun. She had been in the palace a longtime, so it was hard to judge, but she figured it to be late afternoon. Takinginto account the sun’s position in the sky at the time of year, she judged whichway was west. If only she had Rusty, she could make better time. If only she hadher money, she could rent or buy another horse.No sense yearning for what was gone and couldn’t be recovered. She would have towalk.“Thank you for the wine,” Jennsen said to the blond-headed man standing therefidgeting as he watched her.“Not at all,” he said as he cast his gaze downward.As she started away, he seemed to gather his courage. He stepped out into thedusty road and grabbed her by the arm. “Hold on there, ma’am. What are youthinking of doing?”“A man’s life depends on my getting out to Althea’s place. I’ve no choice. Ihave to walk.”“What man? What’s going on that his life would hinge on you seeing Althea?”Jennsen, looking up into the man’s sky blue eyes, gently pulled her arm away.Big and blond, with his strong jaw and muscular build, he reminded her of themen who had murdered her mother.“I’m sorry, but I can’t say.”Jennsen held the hood of her cloak tight against a bitter gust of wind as shestruck out again. Before she had taken a dozen steps, he took several longstrides and gently grasped her under her upper arm again to drag her to a halt.“Look,” he said in a quiet voice when she scowled at him, “do you even have anysupplies?”Jennsen’s scowl withered and she had to fight back the tears of frustration.“Everything is with our horses. The sausage lady, Irma, has everything. Exceptmy money-the cutpurse has that.”“So, you have nothing.” It wasn’t a question so much as scorn for sosimpleminded a plan.“I have myself and I know what I must do.”“And you intend to strike out for Althea’s, in the winter, on foot, without anysupplies?”“I’ve lived in the woods my whole life. I can get by.”She pulled, but his big hand held her arm securely. “Maybe so, but the AzrithPlains aren’t the woods. There’s nothing to help you make a shelter. Not a stickof wood to make a fire. After the sun sets it’ll get as cold as the Keeper’sheart. You don’t have any supplies or anything. What are you going to eat?”This time she more forcefully jerked her arm away and succeeded in freeing it.“I don’t have any other choice. You may not understand that, but there are somethings that you have to do, even if it means risking your own life, or else lifemeans nothing and isn’t worth living.”Before he could stop her again, Jennsen ran into the river of people movingalong the makeshift streets. She pushed her way through the crowds, past peopleselling food and drink she could not buy. It all served to remind her that shehad not eaten since the sausage that morning. The knowledge that Sebastian mightnot live to have another meal gave urgency to her steps.She turned down the first road going west. With the southern winter sun on theleft side of her face, she thought about the sunlight in the palace when she hadbeen at the devotion, and how much it felt like her mother’s embrace."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19Jennsen wove her way among the people below the plateau, making her way down thehaphazard streets, imagining she was stepping among trees, moving through theforests where she felt most at home. That was where she wished she were, in aquiet forest, sheltered among the trees, with her mother, the both of themwatching Betty nibble on tender shoots. Some of the people pausing at stalls, orthe merchants behind tables, or those strolling along, cast a gaze in Jennsen’sdirection, but she kept her head bowed and continued along at a brisk pace.She was worried sick about Betty. The sausage lady, Irma, sold goat meat. Thatwas no doubt why she wanted to buy Betty in the first place. The poor goat wasprobably heartsick and terrified at being taken away by a stranger. As sick asJennsen was over Betty, though, and as much as she ached to go find her and haveher back, she couldn’t put that desire ahead of Sebastian’s life.Passing stands selling food only served to remind her of how hungry she was,especially after the effort of climbing all the stairs up to the palace. Shehadn’t eaten since that morning and wished she could buy something to eat, now,but there was no hope of that. People cooked over open fires made with wood theyno doubt had brought with them. Pans sizzled with butter, garlic, and spices.Smoke from roasting meats drifted past. The aromas were intoxicating and madeher hunger nearly unbearable.When her mind wandered to her hunger, Jennsen thought about Sebastian. Everymoment she delayed could mean another lash of a whip for him, another cut,another twist to a limb, another broken bone. Another moment of agony. Thethought of it made bile rise in the back of her throat. No wonder he was here tohelp in the struggle to defeat D’Hara.A thought even more terrifying abruptly jotted her: Mord-Sith. Wherever Jennsenhad traveled with her mother throughout D’Hara, no one feared anything or anyonemore than they feared the Mord-Sith. Their ability to inflict pain and sufferingwas legend. It was said that this side of the Keeper’s hand, a Mord-Sith existedwithout peer.What if the D’Harans used one of those women to torture Sebastian? Even thoughhe had no magic, that wouldn’t matter. With that Agiel of theirs-and who knewwhat else-the Mord-Sith could hurt anyone. They simply had the added ability tocapture a person with magic. A person without magic, like Sebastian, would benothing but a brief blood sport to a Mord-Sith.The crowds thinned as she reached the edge of the open-air market. The temporarylane she was on dwindled to nothing as it reached the last stall, occupied by alanky man selling leather tack and piles of used wagon fittings. There wasnothing beyond his heavily loaded wagon full of pieces and parts but desolateopen land. An endless file of people moved along the road going south. She couldsee a haze of dust in the air marking the more distant sections of the roadsouth, along with others branching off to the southwest and southeast. No roadwent west.A few people at the fringe of the marketplace glanced her way as she struck out,alone, toward the lowering sun. While some people might have looked her way,none followed into the wasteland that was the Azrith Plains. Jennsen wasrelieved to be alone. Being around people had proven as dangerous as she hadalways feared. The market scene was quickly left behind as she marched west.Jennsen slid her hand in under her cloak, feeling the reassuring presence of herknife. Lying against her body, it was warm to the touch, as if it were a livingthing, rather than silver and steel.At least the thief had taken her money and not her knife. Given a choice of thetwo, she would rather have the knife. She had lived her whole life without muchmoney, her and her mother providing for themselves. But a knife was vital tothat means of survival. If you lived in a palace, you needed money. If you livedout-of-doors, you needed a knife, and she had never seen a better knife thanthis one, despite its provenience.Her fingers idly traced the ornate letter “R” on the silver handle. Some peopleneeded a knife even if they lived in a palace, she guessed.She turned back to look, and was relieved to see that no one followed her. Theplateau had shrunk in the distance, until all the people below it looked likeslow little ants moving about. It was good to be away from the place, but sheknew she would have to return, after seeing Althea, if she was to rescueSebastian.As she walked backward for a spell to gain a reprieve from the icy wind in herface, her gaze rose along the road switching back and forth up the steep cliffs,to the massive stone wall surrounding the palace itself. Coming in from thesouth, she hadn’t seen the road. At one place along its length a bridge spanneda particularly treacherous gap in the rock. The bridge was pulled up. As if thecliff itself were not deterrent enough, the high stone walls around the People’sPalace would defeat any attempt to get inside unless you were allowed in.She hoped it would not be that hard to get in to see Althea.Somewhere in that vast complex, Sebastian was held prisoner. She wondered if hethought himself forever abandoned, as Betty probably did. She whispered a prayerto the good spirits asking that he not give up hope, and that the good spiritssomehow let him know she was going to get him out.When she tired of walking backward, and of seeing the People’s Palace, sheturned around. Then, she had to endure the wind buffeting her, sometimes rippingthe breath right out of her mouth. Sharp gusts kicked the dry gritty ground upinto her eyes.The land was flat, dry, and featureless, mostly hardpan cut through here andthere with a swath of coarse sandy soil. In places, the tawny landscape wasstained a darker brown, as if strong tea had been stirred through. There wasonly occasional vegetation, and that was a low, scruffy plant, now winter brownand brittle.Gathered to the west lay a ragged line of mountains. The one in the centerlooked like it might have snow on top, but it was hard to tell against the sun.She had no guess at how far it was. Being unfamiliar with such land, she foundit difficult to judge distances out on the plain. It could be hours, or evendays, for all she knew. At least she didn’t have to trudge through snow, as theyoften had to do on their way up to the People’s Palace.Jennsen realized that, even in winter, she was going to need water. She guessedthat in a swamp there would be water aplenty. She realized, too, that the womanwho had given her directions said that it was a long way, but hadn’t describedwhat was to her a long way. Maybe to her a long way was what Jennsen wouldconsider only a brisk walk of a few hours. Maybe the woman had meant days.Jennsen whispered a prayer under her breath that it wouldn’t be days, eventhough she didn’t at all relish the idea of going into a swamp.When a sound rose to rattle through the wind, she turned and saw a plume of dustrising in the distance behind her. She squinted, finally recognizing that it wasa wagon coming her way.Jennsen turned all the way around, scanning the barren country trying to see ifthere was any place she could hide. She didn’t like the idea of being caught outin the open all alone. It occurred to her that men from back in the open-airmarket might have watched her leave, and then planned to wait until she was allalone, with no one around, to come out and attack her.She started running. Since the wagon was coming from the palace, she ran thedirection she had been walking-west-toward the dark slash of mountains. As sheran, she sucked frigid gasps of air so cold it hurt her throat. The plainstretched out before her, without so much as a crack to hide in. She focused onthe dark line of mountains, running for them with all her effort, but even asshe ran, she knew they were too far.Before long, Jennsen forced herself to stop. She was acting foolish. Shecouldn’t outrun horses. She bent at her waist, hands on her thighs, catching herbreath, watching the wagon come for her. If someone was coming out to attackher, then running, using up her strength, was about as senseless a thing as shecould do.She turned back to face the sun and kept walking, but at a pace that wouldn’twear her out. If she was going to have to fight, she should at least not bewinded. Maybe it was only someone going home, and they would turn in a differentdirection. She had only spotted them because of the noise of the wagon and thedust it raised. They probably didn’t even see her walking.The chilling thought washed through her: maybe a Mord-Sith had already tortureda confession out of Sebastian. Maybe one of those merciless women had alreadybroken him. She feared to think what she would do if someone were methodicallygoing about snapping her bones in two. Jennsen could not honestly say what shewould do under such excruciating torture.Maybe, under unendurable agony, he had given them Jennsen’s name. He knew allabout her. He knew Darken Rahl was her father. He knew Richard Rahl was her halfbrother. He knew she wanted to go to the sorceress for help.Maybe they had promised him they would stop if Sebastian gave her up. Could sheblame him for a betrayal under such conditions?Maybe the wagon racing toward her was full of big, grim, D’Haran soldiers cometo capture her. Maybe the nightmare was only about to begin in earnest. Maybethis was the day she lived in fear of.As tears of fright stung her eyes, Jennsen slipped her hand under her cloak andchecked to be sure that her knife was free in its scabbard. She lifted itslightly, then pushed it back down, feeling its reassuring metallic click as itseated in its sheath.The minutes dragged as she walked, waiting for the wagon to catch her. Shefought to keep her fear in check and tried to run through in her mind everythingher mother had taught her about using a knife. Jennsen was alone, but she wasnot helpless. She knew what to do. She told herself to remember that.If there were too many men, though, nothing would help her. She recalled onlytoo vividly how the men at her house had grabbed her, and how helpless she hadthen been. They had caught her by surprise, but, of course, it mattered not how,really-they had caught her. That was all that mattered. If not for Sebastian ...When she turned again to check, the wagon was bearing down on her. She plantedher feet, keeping her cloak lifted open slightly so she could reach in andsnatch her knife, surprising her attacker. Surprise could be her valuable ally,too, and the only one she could hope to summon.She saw, then, a lopsided grin of straight teeth beaming at her. The big blondman drew his wagon close, scattering gravel and raising dust. As he set thebrake, the dust drifted away. It was the man from market, the man beside Irma’splace, the man who had given her the drink of wine. He was alone.Unsure of his intent, Jennsen kept her tone curt and her knife hand at theready. “What are you doing out here?”He still wore the grin. “I came out to give you a ride.”“What about your brothers?”“I left them back at the palace.”Jennsen didn’t trust him. He had no reason to come give her a ride, “Thank you,but I think you had better go back to your own business.” She started walking.He hopped down off the wagon, landing with a thud. She turned to be ready,should he come at her.“Look, I wouldn’t feel right about it,” he said.“About what?”“I could never forgive myself if I just stood by and let you go out here to yourdeath-which is what it will be with no food, no water, no nothing. I thoughtabout what you said, that there are some things that you have to do, or elselife means nothing and isn’t worth living. I couldn’t live with myself if I knewyou were out here going to your death.” His tenacity faltered and his voiceturned more pleading. “Come on, climb up in the wagon and let me give you aride?”“What about your brothers? Before I found out I’d lost my money, you wouldn’trent me a horse because you said you had to get back.”He hooked a thumb behind his belt, resigned to having to explain himself. “Well,we’ve been doing so well at selling wine today that we made a goodly sum. Joeand Clayton were wanting to stay at the palace, anyway, and have a little funfor a change. It was that Irma, selling her spicy sausages right beside us, thatdid it.” He shrugged. “So, since she helped us do so well, it gives me a chanceto come help you. Since she took your horses and supplies, I figure that givingyou a ride is the least I can do. Kind of makes it even out a little. It’s justa ride. It’s not like I’m risking my life or something. Just a bit of help I’moffering someone who I know needs it.”Jennsen surely could use help, but she feared to trust this stranger.“I’m Tom,” he said, as if reading her thoughts. “I’d be grateful if you wouldlet me do this to help you.”“What do you mean?”“Like you said-some things you have to do to make life a little moremeaningful.” The briefest of glances took in her ringlets of red hair beneaththe cloak’s hood before turning solemn. “That’s the way it would make me feel... grateful to have done something like that.”She broke the gaze first. “I’m Jennsen. But I don’t-”“Come along, then. I have some wine-”“I don’t like wine. It only makes me thirsty.”He shrugged. “I have plenty of water. I brought along some meat pies, too,They’re still hot, I bet, if you hurry and have some now.”She studied his blue eyes, blue like her bastard father’s. Even so, this man’seyes had a simple sincerity about them. His smile wasn’t cocky, but modest.“Don’t you have a wife to get back to?”This time, it was Tom who broke the gaze to look at the ground. “No, ma’am. I’mnot married. I travel around a lot. I don’t imagine a woman would much take tothat kind of life. Besides, it doesn’t afford me much of a chance to come toknow anyone well enough to be thinking about marriage. Someday, though, I dearlyhope to find a woman who would want to share life with me, a woman who makes mesmile, a woman I can live up to.”Jennsen was surprised to see that the very question made his face go red. Itseemed to her as if his boldness in talking to her and offering her this ridemight be more forward than was his customary conduct. As affable as he was, heappeared painfully shy. Something about a man that big and strong beingintimidated by her, a lone woman in the middle of nowhere, by her question aboutmatters of the heart, put her at ease.“If I’m not harming you, your business at earning a living-”“No,” he put in. “No, you’re not-not at all.” He gestured back toward theplateau. “We made a good profit today and we can afford a short rest. Mybrothers don’t mind at all. We travel all over and buy whatever goods we canfind at a reasonable price, everything from wine, to carpets, to springchickens, and then we haul it back here to sell. It would really be doing mybrothers a favor, giving them a break.”Jennsen nodded. “I could use the ride, Tom.”He turned serious. “I know. A man’s life is at stake.”Tom scrambled up onto the wagon and held down a hand. “Careful, ma’am. “She took his big hand and put a boot in the iron rung. “I’m Jennsen.”“So you said, ma’am.” He gently drew her up to the seat.As soon as she was seated, he pulled a blanket from behind and placed it in apile in her lap, apparently not wanting to be so presumptuous as to spread itout over her. As she arranged it on her lap, she smiled her appreciation for thewarm wool cover. Reaching behind again, he rooted around under a pile ofwell-worn packing blankets and came up with a small bundle. Tom grinned hislopsided smile as he presented her with the pie wrapped in a white cloth. He wasas good as his word; it was still warm. He recovered a waterskin, too, and setit on the seat between them.“If you’d prefer, you can ride in back. I brought plenty of blankets to keep youwarm, and they might be more comfortable to sit on than a wooden seat.”“I’m fine up here for now,” she said. She lifted the pie in gesture. “When I getmy supplies back, and my money, I want to pay you back for everything. You keepa tally, and I’ll pay you back for it all.”He released the brake and flicked the reins. “If that’s your wish, but I don’texpect it.”“I do,” she said as the wagon lurched ahead.As soon as they were under way, he turned from her westerly course to a morenorthwest line.She instantly reverted to her suspicion. “What are you doing? Where do you thinkyou’re going?”He looked a little startled at her renewed mistrust. “You said you wanted to goto Althea’s, didn’t you?”“Yes, but I was told to go west until I reached the tallest snowcapped mountain,and then on the other side to turn north and follow cliffs-”“Oh,” he said, realizing then what she was thinking and why. “That’s if you wantit to take an extra day.”“Why would that woman tell me to go a way that would take more time?”“Probably because that’s the way everyone goes to Althea’s and she didn’t knowyou were in a hurry.”“Why send people that way, if it takes more time?”“People go that way because they fear the swamp. That way puts you in closest toAlthea’s at the end, meaning you have to go through the least amount of theswamp. It was probably the only way she knew about.”Jennsen had to grab the rail for support as the wagon bounced over a crease inthe rocky ground. He was right, the wooden seat was hard sitting and with awagon made for hauling heavy loads, it bounced more when empty.“But, shouldn’t I fear the swamp, too?” she finally asked.“I suppose.”“Well then, why should I go this other way?”He looked over, again, taking the briefest glance at her hair. It was a behaviorshe was used to. Most people couldn’t help but to look.“You said a man’s life was at stake,” he said, his timidity gone. “It takes alot less time this way, cutting the corner off the route by going this side ofthat peak she told you about and not having to go up that twisting canyonbeneath the cliffs. The problem is, you have to go in the swamp from the back,so you’ll have more of the swamp to go through to get in to Althea’s.”“And that doesn’t take more time, going through more swamp?”“Yes, but even with having to go through more swamp, I’m betting you’ll stillsave a day each way. That’s two days saved.”Jennsen didn’t like swamps. More to the point, she didn’t like the kinds ofthings that lived in swamps.“Is it much more dangerous?”“You wouldn’t strike out alone with no supplies if it wasn’t pretty important-amatter of life and death. If you were willing to risk your life to do that, thenI figured you’d be looking to save any time you can. If you’d rather, though, Ican take you the long way, with less distance through the swamp. Up to you, butif time is important, it’s two days more by going that way.”“No, you’re right.” The meat pie on her lap was warm. It felt good to have herfingers around it. He was a thoughtful man for bringing it. “Thank you, Tom, forthinking to save time.”“Who is it that’s at the other end of life and death?”“A friend,” she said.“Must be a good friend.”“I’d be dead, now, if not for him.”He was silent as they rolled toward the dark band of mountains in the distance.She brooded about what might lie in the swamp. Worse, she worried about whatwould happen to Sebastian if she didn’t get Althea’s help soon enough.“How long?” Jennsen asked. “How long till we get to the swamp?”“Depends on how much snow is in the pass, and on a few other things. I don’t gothis way often, so I can’t say for sure. If we ride all night, though, I’mreasonably sure we can be to the back reaches of the swamp by morning. ““How long to get to Althea’s, then. Through the swamp, I mean.”He glanced over uneasily. “Sorry, Jennsen, but I don’t know for sure. I’ve neverbeen in Althea’s swamp before.”“Any guess?”“Just knowing the lay of the land, I don’t think it should take more than a dayto go in and come back, but I’m guessing. And that doesn’t count how much timeyou’ll be spending in there with Althea.” His uneasiness returned. “I’ll get youin to Althea’s as quickly as I can.”Jennsen had to talk to Althea about the Lord Rahl-both her father, and thepresent Lord Rahl, Richard, her half brother. It would not be good if Tom wereto discover who she was, or her purpose. His helpfulness would evaporate, at theleast. She also thought that a reason for him to stay behind might be in order,lest he get suspicious.She shook her head. “I think it would be best if you stayed with the wagon andhorses. If you drive all night, then you’ll need to get some rest to be ready assoon as I come out. It will save us time.”He nodded as he considered her words. “That makes sense. But I could still-”“No. I appreciate the ride, the food and water, and the warm blanket, but Iwon’t let you risk your life in there, too. It would be the most help if youwaited with the wagon and were ready to drive back when I come out.”She watched the wind in his blond hair as he thought it over. “All right, ifthose are your wishes. I’m glad you let me help you with my part of it. Where toafter you see Althea?”“Back to the palace,” she said.“Then, with good fortune, I’ll have you back at the palace day after tomorrow. “That was three days for Sebastian. She didn’t know if he had three days, orthree hours. Or even three minutes. As long as there was a chance he was stillalive, though, she had to go into the swamp.Despite Jennsen’s misgivings about the job ahead of her, the meat pie tastedwonderful. Hungry as she was, nearly anything would have tasted good. She pulleda big piece of meat out of the pie, and, holding it between a finger and thumb,fed it to Tom.After he chewed, he said, “The moon will be up not long after sundown, so by thetime I reach the pass through the mountains, I should be able to see well enoughto keep going. There’s plenty of blankets in back. When night comes, you shouldprobably crawl back there and, if you can, get some sleep for tomorrow. You’llbe needing the rest. In the morning, I’ll catch a nap while you go in to seeAlthea. When you come back, I’ll drive all night and get you right back to thepalace. I hope that way we can save enough time for you to help your friend.”She swayed in the seat along with the big man she had only just met, who wasdoing all this for a stranger.“Thank you, Tom. You’re a good man.”He grinned. “My mama always said so.”Just as she took another bite, he added, “I hope Lord Rahl thinks so, too.You’ll tell him when you see him, won’t you?”She didn’t know what he could possibly mean, and feared to ask him. As her mindraced, she chewed, using her mouthful as an excuse to delay. Saying anythingmight inadvertently get her into trouble. Sebastian’s life was at stake. Jennsendecided to smile and play along. She finally swallowed the mouthful.“Of course.”By the slight but sublime smile that lent a curve to the line of his mouth as hetended the reins and watched out ahead, it had been the right answer."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20Light suddenly hurt her eyes. Jennsen held a hand up against the brightness andsaw that Tom was pulling the blankets back off her. She stretched and yawned,but then, realizing fully why she was in the back of a wagon, where they were,and why they were there, her yawn cut short. She sat up. The wagon was stoppedat the edge of a grassy meadow.Jennsen put a hand on the side of the wagon, on the coarse plank worn smoothalong the top edge, and blinked as she looked about. Behind them, craggy grayrock rose up, holding in its cracks and fissures low stalwart bushes, gnarledand hunkered low, as if against an enduring wind. Her gaze rose up the weatheredrock to where it dissolved into mist. Tangled growth lay at the foot of thewalls beyond the edges of the meadow and beside the narrow chasm that cutthrough the rock. Tom had somehow jockeyed the wagon between those steep cliffs.The two big draft horses, still standing in their harnesses, cropped at theshaggy grass.Ahead, beyond the meadow, the ground descended into the gloom among spreadingtrees, trailers of vine, and hanging moss. Strange calls, clicks, and whistlescame from under the verdant shroud.“In the middle of winter. . . “ was all she could think to say.Tom lifted the feed bags from the back of the wagon. “Might be a nice place tospend the winter, too”-he gestured with a nod down the hill, under the tangle ofgrowth-”were it not for what people say comes out of there. If it weren’t true,I’d bet there would be some fool who by now would have tried to give it a go,here. But, if they have, they were pulled in there by some nightmare creatureand never made it back out.”“You mean, you really think here are ... monsters, or something, in there?”He rested his forearms on the wagon’s sides as he leaned in, right over her.“Jennsen, I don’t hold with scaring ladies. When I was a boy, some of the otherboys enjoyed waving a wriggling snake at the girls just to hear them scream. Inever did. I’m not trying to frighten you.“But I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I just allowed you to go boundingin there as if it were some lark and then you ended up never coming out. Maybeit’s just talk; I don’t know; I’ve never gone in there. I don’t know anyone whohas ever gone in there without being invited in-and that’s from the other side.People say you can’t go in the back and live to tell about it. If anyone wouldinsist on attempting it, it would be you. I know you’re here for an importantreason, so I don’t expect you’re going to sit around for days, waiting for aninvitation.”Jennsen swallowed. Her tongue tasted sour. She nodded her thanks, not knowingwhat to say.Tom swiped back his fall of blond hair. “I just wanted to tell you the truth ofwhat I know.” He hoisted the feed bags on his way to the horses.Whatever was in there was in there. She had to go in, that was all there was toit. She didn’t have any choice; if she wanted to get Sebastian away from hiscaptors, she had to go in. If she ever wanted to be free of Lord Rahl, she hadto go in.She reached under her cloak and touched the hilt of her knife. She wasn’t sometown girl, scared of her own shadow, unable to defend herself.She was Jennsen Rahl.Jennsen pushed the blankets the rest of the way off her and climbed out of thewagon bed, using a rear wheel spoke for a step. Tom was coming back aroundcarrying a waterskin.“Drink? It’s water-I kept it hooked over the frame so the horses would keep itfrom freezing.”The cold had dried her out and she drank eagerly. She saw Tom wipe sweat fromhis brow and realized only then how warm it really was. She supposed no properself-respecting swamp full of monsters would allow itself to be frozen over.Tom pulled back the folds of cloth of something he held in one hand.“Breakfast?”She smiled at seeing a meat pie. “You’re a thoughtful man, besides being a goodman.”He grinned as he handed her the pie and then turned to undo the trace chainsfrom the horses. “Don’t forget, you promised to tell Lord Rahl,” he called backto her.Rather than be pulled into any kind of a conversation having to do with herhunter, she diverted him from the subject. “You’ll be right here, then? When Icome back, I mean? You’ll be waiting, so we can get back?”He peered back as he lifted the breaching strap over the horse’s rump. “You havemy word, Jennsen. I won’t desert you here.”By his expression, he was swearing an oath. She smiled her appreciation. “Youshould get some rest. You’ve driven all night.”“I’ll try. “She took another bite of the meat pie. It was cold, but good, and it wasfilling. As she chewed, she glanced at the wall of green beyond the meadow, atthe darkness within, then appraised the iron gray sky.“Any idea what time of day it is?”“Sun’s been up an hour, at most,” he said as he checked the joints on theleather straps. He gestured back the way they had come in. “Before we starteddown into this low place, we were up above this fog and mist. It was sunny upthere.”As somber as it was below the dark overcast, such a notion amazed her. It lookedlike dawn had yet to arrive. It was hard to believe that the sun was shinningnot far off, but she had seen such heavy blankets of fog before as she lookeddown from high places.After she was finished eating the meat pie and had brushed the crumbs from herpalm, Jennsen stood waiting until Tom turned from unbuckling the girth strapfrom around the deep, powerful chest of one of his horses. Both big, well-keptanimals were gray with black manes and tails. They were horses as big as any shehad ever seen. They seemed out of scale, until she took in Tom working besidethem. He made them seem not quite so imposing, especially as he gave themaffectionate strokes. They appeared to welcome his familiar touch.Both horses looked back occasionally at Tom as he removed all their gear, orrolled a dark eye toward Jennsen, but both kept much closer watch on the shadowsbeyond the edge of the meadow. Their ears were at attention, and fixed on theswamp.“I’d better get going. There’s no time to waste.” He offered a single nod.“Thank you, Tom. If I don’t get another chance to say it, thank you for helpingme. Not many people would have done as you did.”His shy grin appeared again to show his teeth. “Most anyone would have helpedyou. But I’m pleased to be the one who was able to.”She was sure he meant something that she didn’t quite understand. Whatever itwas, she had bigger worries.Her eyes turned toward the echoing calls coming out of the swamp. There was notelling how big the trees were because the tops disappeared up into the mist. Aslarge as they looked, the trunks would have to be enormous. Vines descended outof the mist, along with any number of other twisting climbing plants enshroudingthe limbs of the huge trees, as if trying to wrestle them down into the darknessbelow.Jennsen searched the rim and found a ridge descending from the edge of themeadow, like the spine of some huge beast beneath the ground. It ran down inunder the spreading limbs. It wasn’t a path, exactly, but a place to start. Shehad lived in the woods her whole life and could find a trail others would neverknow existed. There was no trail into this place. Nothing, it appeared, everwent in. She would have to find her own way.Jennsen turned back from the edge of the meadow and shared a long look with thebig man’s blue eyes.He offered her a small smile-respect for what she was doing. “May the goodspirits be with you, and watch over you.”“And you, Tom. Get some sleep. When I get back, we’ll need to ride hard back tothe palace.”He bowed. “By your command.”She smiled at his surprising manner, and then turned to the gloom and headeddown in.The swamp held heat gathered under its skirts. The humidity was like a presencewaiting to push intruders back. With every step it grew darker. The quiet was asthick as the damp air, and the few calls reverberating through the darknessbeyond only accentuated the hush and the vast distance that lay below.Jennsen followed the spine of the ridge as it twisted this way and that, goingever lower. Branches of trees off to each side drooped with the weight of mossesand vines draped over them. In some places, as she stepped along the exposedrock of the ridge, she had to squat down to duck under the limbs. In otherplaces, she had to push vines aside to make progress. The stink of decay driftedup to her through the dead still air.Turning, looking back, she saw a tunnel of light back up to the meadow. In thecenter of the circle of dull light at the end, she could see the silhouette of abig man, standing, hands on hips, watching down at her. As dark as it was, hehad no hope of seeing her. She could only see him because he stood against thelight. But he stood watching, anyway.Jennsen couldn’t decide what she thought about him. He was difficult to figureout. He seemed a kindhearted man, but she trusted no one. Except Sebastian. Shetrusted him.As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she saw, looking back, that the way shehad come in was the only way to enter, at least anywhere close that she couldsee. There were steep walls where the rock dropped downward. The meadow had beenlike a mere shelf in the mountainside’s descent into the swamp. Below themeadow, the walls held a wealth of plants that used the rock for support as theyclimbed upward from the swamp below. The ridge she used for her descent was amere fold of rock that provided a way for her to climb down. Without it, thewalls were too steep.Taking a deep breath for resolve as she gazed about, Jennsen started back down,following the ridge of rock as it twisted its way down, deeper and deeper inamong the trees. In places, there were frightening drops to each side of whereshe walked. In one place, there was only darkness to each side below, as if shewere on a thread of stone spanning a rupture in the world. After peering downinto the depths, and imagining the Keeper of the underworld below awaiting theunwary, she trod more carefully.She soon came to realize that many of the trees she had seen up higher had onlybeen the canopy of towering, ancient oaks rising up from ledges in the rock. Sherealized that she had mistaken some of their upper limbs for trunks. Jennsen hadnever seen trees so big. Her fear was almost replaced by awe. She gaped at thelayer upon layer of massive limbs as she climbed down past them. In the distanceshe saw nests, large clumps of twigs and stalks draped with downy moss andlichen, perched in the crotch of limbs. If the nests were occupied, she didn’tsee what sort of bird could have built such imposing havens, but she guessedthey had to be raptors.As she stooped while clambering over rock to squeeze herself under a tightlywoven net of limbs drooping down close over the spine of the ridge, the vistaopened onto a vast land hidden under the thick leafy layers of the upper canopy.It was like a whole new world hidden away, unvisited by anyone before. Shafts ofmuted light hardly dared penetrate down this far. Here and there vines hung downout of the dark growth above. Birds drifted silently through the cavernousgloom. An animal she had never heard before called from the distance. A farawayanswer returned from another direction.As primitive and foreboding as the place seemed, she also thought it was darklybeautiful. It put her in mind of being in a garden of the underworld, whereplants basked in eternal gloom. The underworld might be the Keeper’s colddomain, but the Creator’s everlasting light nourished and warmed good souls.In a way, the swamp reminded her of so much about D’Hara-dark, threatening, anddangerous, but at the same time achingly beautiful. In the same way, her knifeembodied the ugliness of the House of Rahl, yet it was undeniably exquisite.Trees clung to the rocky slope around her with clawlike roots, as if fearing tobe dragged down to what might lurk in the lower reaches. Some of the ancientpines, long dead, lay partly fallen, caught by their brethren before they couldtopple to the ground. The nearby trees embraced them, as if trying to help themup. Dead gray wood was visible in places under the covering of growth climbingup the tilted trunks. Many, though, had collapsed to the ground. One old treelay across her way, as if it had melted there, conforming to every contour,every rise and fall of the ridge. The disintegrating wood was spongy underfoot,and teeming with insects.Up in the branches, an owl watched as she scrambled ever downward. Ants marchedalong the ground, carrying bits of treasures from the damp forest. Roaches, big,hard, and glossy brown, skittered across the leaf litter. Things off in thedense undergrowth disturbed branches as they moved away from her.Jennsen had spent a lifetime in forests and had seen everything from huge bearsto newborn fawns, birds to bugs, bats to newts. There were things that worriedher, like snakes and bears with cubs, but she knew the animals well. For themost part, they feared people and usually wanted only to be left alone, so theygenerally didn’t frighten her. But she didn’t know what animals might be lurkingin this dark and damp place, what poison things with fangs. She didn’t know whatconjured beasts might prowl the nether reaches of this sorceress’s lair, beaststhat feared nothing.She saw spiders, fat, dark, and hairy, their legs slowly raking the dank air,descending smoothly on threads anchored somewhere above. They vanished into theferns growing in sprawling mats across the ground. As warm and humid as it was,Jennsen kept her cloak closed around her and the hood covering her head tobetter protect herself from the likes of spiders.The bite of a spider could be as deadly as any animal. Dead was dead, no matterthe cause. The Keeper of the dead gave no special dispensation because thedeadly poison came from something small and seemingly insignificant. The Keeperof the dead embraced with eternal darkness those come into his domain-forwhatever reason. No grace was granted for how you came to be dead.As at home as Jennsen felt in the out-of-doors, and as hauntingly beautiful asthe swamp was, the place still kept her eyes wide and her pulse racing. Everyvine or green wisp she touched seemed threatening, and more than once made herjump.The whole place felt as though death skulked nearby.And then, before her, the spine of rock, her only path down, ended in a still,flat, rank, moldering, mossy place crisscrossed with a tangle of roots. Itlooked like the trees feared the murky wet, and tried to keep their roots up outof it. To the sides, the ground was grown over with every sort of spreadingvegetation.She spotted the distinctive shape of a leg bone sticking up from the muddyexpanse to the side. The bone was covered with fuzzy green mold, but the generalshape remained recognizable. What sort of animal it could be from, she didn’tknow. At least, she hoped it was an animal bone.She was surprised to come upon muddy spots that actually looked as if the mudwere boiling. Gooey bubbles of dark brown mud bubbled as if at a slow boil,throwing globs of the thick mud and releasing steam. Nothing grew in the sunkenareas of bubbling mud. In some places, the mud had hardened into collections ofshort cones from which rose yellowish vapor.As Jennsen carefully picked a path among the tangle of roots, between steamingvents and boiling mud, wending her way deeper into the shadows at the bottom,she saw that the muddy stretches began to be replaced by standing water. Atfirst, it was pools and puddles that boiled and hissed and released plumes ofacrid vapor. As she left the hot springs behind, the water grew in size to pondssurrounded by tall reeds reaching up toward clouds of tiny bugs flittingtogether in balls.Stagnant water finally took over in earnest, a forest floor that was dark andliquid. Dead trunks stood in the black water, sentinels watching over a landreeking of rot. The whoops and calls of animals carried across the water fromplaces darker still. Duckweed grew in some areas near the edges, under leafybanks, welcoming the unwary with the look of green ground to tread more easilyacross. Jennsen noticed eyes poked up through the duckweed, watching her passnear by.The mossy ground became spongy, until it, too, gradually lowered beneath themotionless water. At first, she could see the bottom, just inches below theglassy surface, but it went deeper until she could see only darkness below.Through that darkness, she saw shapes, darker yet, glide by.Jennsen stepped from root to root, trying to keep her balance without having toput her hands to the often slimy trunks of trees for support. By staying on theprotruding curves of roots, she didn’t have to step down into water. She fearedthe water might hide a hole that could swallow her.With each step, as the roots standing above the surface of the water grewfarther and farther apart, the knot in the pit of her stomach drew tighter. Shehesitated, fearing she was going too far, that she would reach a place where shecouldn’t turn around. She couldn’t really question her judgment that this wasthe best way in, because there had been no opportunity to make a choice; thishad been the only way. She leaned down, squinting into the gloom, peering aheadpast trailers of moss and leafy vines. Through the mist and shadows andundergrowth, she thought that not far ahead the ground rose up again, offering adrier path.Taking a deep breath of the sultry air, Jennsen extended her leg to step acrossto the next fat root, but she couldn’t reach it. She squatted slightly andstretched harder, trying to span the patch of still water, but it was just toofar. She straightened to reconsider.She was going to have to jump to the distant thick bulge of root. It was more ofa hop, really, than a jump. She just didn’t like what would be under her if sheslipped and fell. She also didn’t want to have to balance on the lone root outin the expanse of water. If she jumped with enough speed and hit the root justright, she could spring off it to the far bank.She put her fingertips against the smooth but sticky trunk of a tree forsupport. At least it wasn’t slimy, which could make her hand slip at the worstpossible moment. She studied the distance. As much of a reach as it was, it wasthe closest place that offered a firm dry step. With enough momentum she couldhop to the next root beyond on drier ground.Jennsen took a deep breath and then with a grunt of effort shoved away from thetree, bounding out over the span of open water.Just as she landed on the curve of tree root, the root moved underfoot. Herweight was committed-she couldn’t reverse direction.The root, thicker than her ankle, suddenly writhed beneath her and disappeared.In an instant, a thick coil twisted back around, grasping her calf as anotherlength of cold scales whipped up to seize her around her knee.It was all so fast that part of her was still going for the root that hadgrabbed her as another part of her was trying to recoil. Caught between whereshe’d left and where she was going, she had nothing to help her stay upright.Instinctively, Jennsen grabbed for her knife, but as she did the thing twistedviolently, flinging her down face-first. She threw her arms out to break herfall. Water frothed under her. She just caught the distant roots at the water’sedge, real roots, wet but rough and woody under her clutching fingers.But even as she broke her fall by desperately seizing the roots barely at thelimit of her reach, she was welcomed into the embrace of an enormous snakesurfacing from beneath her through the churning water."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21Jennsen strained with all her might, using the roots to try to pull herselffree. She cried out as living coils wrenched her around, breaking her grip onthe roots, and flipped her onto her back. She frantically reached behind,splashing, groping, trying to snatch for another handhold. She reached, thenstretched again, catching hold of thick roots with first one hand and then theother just in time to prevent herself from being dragged under the water.The head came out of the depths to slink up across her stomach, as if to inspectits stubborn prey. It was the biggest snake Jennsen had ever seen. The body,covered in iridescent green scales, shimmered in the weak light as muscles alongthe powerful trunk flexed. The light intermittently played gleaming stripesalong the length of it. Black bands sweeping back across the fierce yellow eyesmade it look as if it were wearing a mask. Red tongue flicking, the dark greenhead glided up between her breasts, coming for her face.Crying out, she shoved the head aside. In response, the muscular body twistedand contracted, grappled with her, drawing her out into the deeper water.Jennsen’s fingertips held fast to the roots. With all her might she tried topull herself out of the water, but the snake was too heavy and too strong.She tried to kick her legs, but the snake had them both, now. The coilscompressed, tugged, and dragged her in deeper. Coughing up water, Jennsen foughtpanic that clawed at her, just as fiercely, just as tenaciously, as if it, too,were a thing alive.She needed her knife. But to get the knife, she would have to let go of theroots. But if she let go, the beast would pull her down under the black waterand drown her.One hand, she told herself. That was all she needed, one hand. She could get herknife if she let go with one hand. But as the unrelenting snake undulated,steadily working itself up her body, gripping her now around the middle, herpanic locked her fingers all the tighter to the root.As the broad flat head of the snake emerged from the water and once again beganslinking up along her body, Jennsen gripped the root as tight as she could inher left hand. With desperate resolve, she let her right hand go and thrust itin under her cloak. Wet cloth bunched as she pushed. She couldn’t get under it.The snake’s jaw pressed against her chest, as if to let her know that next itwas going to compress her lungs so she couldn’t breathe.She sucked in her stomach and pushed with her fingers, trying to get them inunder the snake, but the heavy body squeezed with paralyzing power against thelength of her torso, preventing her from getting her hand in under her cloak toget her knife.As she struggled madly to get to the weapon, wriggling, worming her fingers, thesnake suddenly lurched, lifting heavy coils higher, pinning her arm to her body.With her one hand, she still tightly gripped the root behind. The weight of thething, though, felt as if it would pull her arm from the socket if she didn’tlet go. She was absolutely certain that letting go would be the worst thing shecould do. But the weight was too much. The snake was pulling her so hard thatshe feared the skin was going to strip from her fingertips.Despite her best effort, she felt her fingers slipping from the root. As tearsof pain stung her eyes, she had no choice. She let go of the root.She plunged into the dark depths of deeper water. Her feet at last contacted thebottom. She used her momentum to go where she was pulled, letting her legs bend,and then with strength powered by terror, she pushed off the submerged roots. Asher body flicked around, she seized the roots on the far side.The snake rolled with her, turning her on her back. She cried out as hershoulder twisted, But in all the movement, the splashing, the rolling, thechoking on water, there was a brief opening in the snake’s grip on her. Shedidn’t waste it. She seized the silver handle.As the broad head, with the thin red tongue flicking, was again coming towardher face, she brought her knife up, wedging the tip of the blade up under thesnake’s jaw. The snake paused, seeming to recognize the threat that therazor-sharp point represented. Both were still, staring at each other. She feltgiddy relief to at last have her knife in hand, even if it was a deadlock.She was on her back, lying in water with the heavy snake wrapped around her. Shewouldn’t be able to balance or use her weight to help her. Her arm was weak fromthe struggle and ached from being twisted. She was exhausted. With all thatworking against her, it would be no easy matter to dispatch an animal so big andpowerful. Even if they were on dry land, such a task would be difficult.The yellow eyes watched her. She wondered if it was a venomous snake. She hadn’tyet seen its fangs. If it went for her face, she wondered if she could be quickenough to stop it.“I’m sorry I stepped on you,” she said. She didn’t actually believe the snakecould understand her; she was, in a way, talking to herself, reasoning out loud.“We’ve both scared each other.”The snake remained stone still as it watched her. The tongue remained inside themouth. Its head, lifted several inches by the tip of the knife, could probablyfeel the sharp point. Maybe it conceived the threat of the blade as a fang.Jennsen didn’t know, she just knew that it would be better not to have to battlesuch a creature.She was in the water, the snake’s domain, and out of hers. Knife or no knife,the outcome was not certain. Even if she killed it, the weight of the creature,its coils locked around her in a death grip, could still drag her under anddrown her. Better to part without a battle, if possible.“Go, now,” she whispered with deadly seriousness. “Or I will have to try to killyou.” She lifted the point of the knife to make herself understood in a languageshe was more confident the snake might possibly understand.Her legs began to throb as she felt the constriction ease. Inch by inch, thehead drew back. Scaled coils loosened and slipped away from her body and legs,leaving her to feel suddenly buoyant. Jennsen followed the head as it backedaway, keeping the point of her knife under the thing’s jaws, prepared at theslightest sign of threat to thrust with all her strength. Finally, it slippedback into the water.As soon as she was free of the weight, she scrambled up onto solid ground. Sherested on her hands and knees, knife gripped in her fist, gasping for air,getting her breath, letting her frayed nerves settle. She had no idea what thesnake thought, or why, or if the same thing might work in another time andplace, but this day it had and she whispered a prayer of thanks to the goodspirits. If indeed they had anything to do with her deliverance from death’sscaly grip, she didn’t want to fail to express her gratitude.With the back of her trembling hand, Jennsen wiped tears of fright from hercheeks before rising up on shaky legs. She turned and looked out at the stillblack water lying beneath the overhanging leaves and mosses. In retrospect, sherecalled her feet touching submerged roots. Looking back at the expanse of watershe had crossed, she could see that perhaps the water had risen a few feet tocover the ground there. Maybe the land had sunk. Either way, if she had justcarefully walked through the shallow area, rather than tried to jump to theroot-turned-snake, it might have proven much less troublesome.On the way back, she planned to cut herself a walking stick to help her wadethrough the low place, to feel ahead, and she would take care not to step on asnake.Still catching her breath, Jennsen turned back to the dark way ahead. She hadyet to get to the sorceress’s place, and she was wasting time standing aroundfeeling sorry for herself. Sebastian needed her help, not for her to feel sorryfor herself.She struck out once more, soaked to the skin. Fortunately, though it was winter,it was warm in the swamp. At least she wouldn’t freeze. She remembered being wetwhen she and Sebastian fled her house after the quad murdered her mother.The ground was mere inches above the expanses of stagnant water, but, with theprofusion of roots woven through it, firm enough to hold her weight. Where thewater came over the ground, it was only for short expanses and shallow. Eventhough the water was only inches deep, Jennsen stepped carefully, watching thatthe roots just below the surface were not lurking snakes. She knew that watersnakes were some of the most dangerous. A poison snake, even if it was only afoot long, could kill a person. Like a spider, the size was immaterial if itsvenom was deadly.She came to another area where steam rose from fissures in the ground. Coloreddeposits, mostly yellow, crusted around the openings where the vapor rose. Thesmell gagged her, and she had to seek a way around that would allow her tobreathe. The brush was thorny and thick.With her knife, she was able to cut several of the heavier branches and make itthrough to a shelf of rock against a rock wall. Following the narrow ledge, sheskirted a dark pool of water. The surface moved with slow ripples as somethingbeneath followed her movement. She kept her knife to hand, trying to watch herfooting and keep an eye out for anything that might lunge at her out of thewater. When she grabbed for a handhold and loose rock came away, almost makingher lose her footing, she threw the rock in the water at the thing she couldn’tsee. It continued to follow her until she reached the far end, where she wasable to climb up onto higher ground that took her into dense growth of tallshoots with broad leaves.It reminded her of moving through a field of cornstalks. Off through the stalks,she could see slow movement. She didn’t know what it could be, but by the sizeof it, she didn’t want to find out, and picked up the pace. Before long, she wasrunning through the thick growth, dodging stems and ducking under branches.The trees grew in close again, and she was soon back to treading among thetangle of roots. They seemed endless, and progress was agonizingly slow. The daywas wearing on. When she came to open areas, or at least open enough, shetrotted to save time. She had been in the swamp for hours. It had to be close tothe middle of the day.Tom had told her that he thought it might be a day of travel in and back out ofthe swamp. But she had been at it so long that she began to worry that she mighthave missed the sorceress’s house. After all, there was no telling how wide theswamp was. She could easily have passed it by and never have seen it. She beganto worry that that was exactly what had happened.What if she couldn’t find the house? What would she do, then? She didn’t relishthe idea of spending the night in the swamp. There was no telling what manner ofcreature would come out at night. She didn’t think there was any chance ofmaking a fire. The thought of being in this place in the dark, with no hope ofeven the light of the moon or stars, gripped her with fear.When she emerged at last on the shore of a broad lake, Jennsen paused to catchher breath. Trees, fat at the bottom where they emerged from the water, stoodlike a series of poles supporting a low roof of green. The light was slightlybrighter over the lake. To the right side was a wall of rock that provided notso much as a handhold, much less a way to traverse it. It dropped straight downinto the water, suggesting how deep that end might be.Scanning the shore to the left, she was startled to see footprints. Jennsen ranover and went to one knee to inspect the depressions in the soft ground. By thesize of them, they looked to be made by a man, but were not fresh. She followedthe prints along the shore and in a few places found fish scales from a catchthat had been cleaned on the spot. The growth beyond was thick and tangled, butthe grass and dry ground at the edge of the lake provided a good path, and thefootprints, hope.At the far side of the still lake, she followed the footprints along a wellwornpath through a dense stand of willow and up onto higher ground. When she peeredthrough an open place in the vegetation, she spotted, off through the trees,beyond the tangled growth of brush and the veil of vines, up on a rise ahead, adistant house. Wood smoke curled from a chimney to blend into the gray fogoverhead, almost as if the smoke itself were creating the ashen overcast.In the gray gloom of the dark swamp, the light coming from a window at the sideof the house shone like a golden jewel, a beacon to welcome the lost, thedesperate, the forsaken and defenseless. The sight of her journey’s end, afterso much terror and loss, brought tears of relief. The tears might have been joy,were it not for her dire need.Jennsen hurried along the path among the willow and oak, up through the tangledundergrowth, past curtains of vines, and soon reached the house. It was set on afoundation of stone, painstakingly fit without mortar. The walls were made ofcedar logs. The roof overhung a narrow porch running around the side, with stepsdown the back to the path to the nearby lake from where she had come.Taking the steps two at a time up to the narrow porch and following it aroundthe house brought her to a door flanked by pillars of stout logs supporting asimple but welcoming portico. From the door, down wide steps, was a broad andwell-maintained path out through the swamp in front. That was the way peoplecame when they were invited to visit the sorceress. After the way she had comein, it looked like a road.Wasting no time, Jennsen knocked. Impatient, she rapped her knuckles again. Herknocking was interrupted when the door swung inward. An older man stood staringout at her in surprise. Gray hair was taking over from the dark brown and lookedto have receded some, but it was still thick. He was neither lean nor stout, andaverage height. His clothes were not the clothes of a trapper or a man of aswamp, but those of a craftsman; his brown trousers, clean and well kept, werenot coarse, but a more expensive tightly woven fabric. Flecks of gold sparkledfrom his green shirt. He was the gilder, Friedrich.His discerning face scrutinized her more carefully, taking in the red hair underher hood. “What are you doing here?” He asked. His deep voice fit well with therest of him, but it was none too friendly.“I came to see Althea, if I may.”His eyes turned to the path, then back to her. “How did you get here?”By his suspicious expression after checking, she reasoned that he had some wayof knowing if someone had been up the path. Jennsen knew of such telltales; sheand her mother used them all the time to be sure that no one had sneaked up onthem.Jennsen gestured off around the house. “I came in the other way. In the back.From beyond the lake.”“No one can go beyond the lake, not even me.” His brow of wiry black and grayhairs drew down without so much as considering her words or questioning herfurther. “You’re lying.”Jennsen was stunned. “I’m not. I came the back way. It’s urgent that I see yourwife, Althea.”“You have not been invited to come here. You must leave. You will not wander offthe trail, this time, if you know what’s good for you. Now, go away! ““But it’s a matter of life and death. I must-”The door slammed shut in her face."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22Jennsen stood unmoving with the suddenly closed door inches from her face. Shedidn’t know what to do. At that moment, she was too stunned for any otheremotion to yet flood in.From inside, she heard a woman’s voice. “Who is it, Friedrich?”“You know who it was.” Friedrich’s voice was nothing like it had been when hehad spoken to Jennsen. It was now tender, respectful, familiar.“Well, let her in.”“But, Althea, you can’t-”“Let her in, Friedrich.” Her voice was scolding without being at all harsh.Jennsen felt relief wash through her. The knot of arguments burgeoning insideher as she prepared to knock again melted away. The door opened, more slowlythis time.Friedrich gazed out at her, not as a man defeated or reprimanded, but as a mancome to face fate with dignity.“Please come in, Jennsen,” he said in a quieter, more kindhearted voice.“Thank you,” Jennsen said in a small voice of her own, somewhat astonished andslightly troubled that he knew her name.She took in everything as she followed him into the home. Despite how warm itwas in the swamp, the small fire crackling in the stone fireplace gave the air asweet smell along with a welcome, dry feel. That was the sense of it, more thanheat-dryness. The furnishings were simple but well made and embellished withcarved designs. The main room had only two small windows, on opposite sidewalls. There were rooms to the back and in one of them a workbench, lined withorderly tools, sat before another small window.Jennsen didn’t remember the house, if indeed this was the same place. Her memoryof coming to Althea’s home was more of an impression of friendly faces than anactual memory of a place. The walls, decorated with things for her eyes to feastupon, seemed familiar. As a child, she would have noticed such visual treats.There were carvings of birds, fish, and animals everywhere, either hanging bythemselves, or grouped on small shelves. That would be the most captivating to asmall child.Some of the carvings were painted, some left plain, but the feathers, scales,and fur had been carved with such fine texture that they looked like animalsmagically turned to wood. Other carvings were more stylized and beautifullygilded. A mirror on one wall, down low, was framed with a starburst, each rayalternately gilded gold and silver.Toward the fireplace, a large red and gold pillow sat on the floor. Jennsen’seye was drawn to a square board with a gilded Grace upon it sitting on the floorbefore the pillow. It was just like the Grace she often drew, but this one, sheknew, was real. Small stones rested in a pile to the side.In a beautifully made chair, with a high back and carved arms, sat a slightwoman with big, dark eyes made all the more striking by golden hair fleckedthrough with gray. The fall of hair surrounded her face and swept down to lieabout her shoulders. Her wrists rested over the arms of the chair while her longslender fingers gracefully traced the curve of the spiral carved in the end.“I am Althea. “ Her voice was gentle, but carried a clear ring of authority. Shedidn’t get up.Jennsen curtsied. “Mistress, please forgive my bursting in uninvited andunexpected like this.”“Perhaps uninvited, but not unexpected, Jennsen.”“You know my name?” Jennsen realized too late how foolish the question sounded.The woman was a sorceress. There was no telling what her powers could discern.Althea smiled, and a pleasant look it was on her. “I remember you. One does notforget meeting one like you.”Jennsen wasn’t sure what that meant, but said “Thank you” anyway.The smile on Althea’s face widened, crinkling her eyes. “My, but you look justlike your mother. Were it not for the red hair, I would think I had flown backin time to when I saw her last, when she was just the age you are now.” She helda hand out level before her. “And you were only this big.”Jennsen felt her face going as red as her hair. Her mother had been beautiful,not just wise and loving. Jennsen didn’t believe she could compare to such aattractive woman, or ever live up to the kind of example her mother set.“And how is she?”Jennsen swallowed. “My mother ... my mother is gone.” In anguish, Jennsen’s gazesank to the floor. “She was murdered.”“I’m so sorry,” said Friedrich, standing behind her. He put a hand to hershoulder in sympathy. “I truly am. I knew her, some, from the palace. She was agood woman.”“How did it happen?” Althea asked.“They finally caught up with us.”“Caught up with you?” Althea’s brow twitched. “Who?”“Why, the D’Haran soldiers. Lord Rahl’s men.” Jennsen drew her cloak back,showing them both the handle of the knife. “This came from one of them.”Althea’s gaze took in the knife, then returned to Jennsen’s face. “I’m so sorry,dear.”Jennsen nodded. “But I have to warn you. I went to see your sister, Lathea-”“Did you see her before she died?”Jennsen stared in surprise. “Yes, I did.”Althea shook her head with a sad smile. “Poor Lathea. How was she? I mean, didshe have a good life?”“I don’t know. She had a nice house, but I only saw her briefly. I got theimpression she lived alone. I went to her because I needed help. I recalled mymother mentioning the name of a sorceress who had helped us, but I guess I gotthe names wrong. I ended up at your sister’s. She didn’t even want to talk tome. She said she could do nothing, that it had been you who had helped mebefore. That’s why I had to come here.”“How did you get in?” Friedrich asked as he gestured to the path out front. “Youmust have wandered off the path.”“Not that way. I came from the back way.”Now, even Althea frowned. “There is no back way.”“Well, there was no path, as such, but I made my way through.”“No one can come in from that side,” Althea insisted. “There are things backthere that ward that side.”“I know. I had a run-in with a huge snake-”“You saw the snake?” Friedrich asked.Jennsen nodded. “I stepped on it accidentally. I thought it was a root. We had atime of it and I had a swim.”They were both peering at her in a way that made Jennsen nervous.“Yes, yes,” Althea said, sounding unconcerned about the snake, waving a hand asif to brush away such petty news, “but, surely, you had to see the otherthings?”Jennsen looked from Friedrich’s wide eyes to Althea’s frown. “I never sawanything but the snake.”“The snake is just a snake,” Althea said, dismissing the fearsome beast withanother impatient wave of her hand. “There are dangerous things back there.Things that would let no one through. No one. How in the name of Creation wereyou able to get past them?”“What sort of things?”“Things of magic,” Althea said in a grim tone.“I’m sorry, but all I can tell you is that I got through, and I never sawanything but the snake.” She frowned toward the ceiling as she thought again.“Although, I did see things in the water-dark things under the water. ““Fish,” Friedrich scoffed.“And in the bushes-I saw things in the bushes. Well, I didn’t see them, exactly,but I saw the bushes move and I know something was in there. They remainedhidden, though.”“These things,” Althea said, “do not hide in bushes. They fear nothing. Theyhide from nothing. They would have come out and torn you apart.”“I don’t know why they didn’t,” Jennsen said. Her gaze darted out through thewindow at the side to the stagnant expanses of murky water beneath a shadowytangle of vines, feeling a pang of worry about her return journey. WithSebastian’s life at stake, she felt frustration at the sorceress’s pointlesstalk about what was in the swamp. After all, she had made it through, so itwasn’t as impossible as the two of them wished her to believe. “Why do you liveout here, anyway? I mean, if you’re so wise and all, then why do you live outhere in a swamp with snakes?”Althea lifted an eyebrow. “I prefer my snakes without arms and legs.”Jennsen took a breath and started again. “Althea, I came because I’m indesperate need of your help.”Althea shook her head as if she didn’t want to hear it. “I can’t help you.”Jennsen was stunned to have her request dismissed so out of hand. “But, youmust.”“Really.”“Please, you helped me before. I need that help again. Lord Rahl is gettingcloser all the time. I’ve only just escaped with my life on more than oneoccasion. I’m at my wits’ end and don’t know what else to do. I don’t evenreally know why my father wanted to kill me in the first place. ““Because you are an ungifted offspring.”“There. You’ve just spoken the very reason why it makes no sense: I’m ungifted.So, what possible threat could I represent? If he was a powerful wizard, whatharm could I cause him? What threat could I possibly represent? Why did he wantso badly to kill me?”“The Lord Rahl destroys any offspring he discovers who are not gifted. ““But why? That he does is the result, not a reason. There must be a reason. If Iat least knew that much of it, I might be able to figure out how to do somethingabout it.”She shook her head again. “I don’t know. It isn’t like the Lord Rahl came todiscuss his business with me.”“After I saw your sister and she wouldn’t help me, I went back to ask her aboutthat very thing, but she had been murdered by the same men who are after me.They must have feared she could tell me something, so they murdered her.”Jennsen smoothed her hair back over her head. “I’m sorry about your sister, Ireally am. But don’t you see? You’re in danger, too, for what you know aboutit.”“I can’t imagine why they would harm her.” Frowning, Althea stared off as sheconsidered. “What you’re saying, that she might know something, makes no sense.She was never involved in any of it. Lathea knew less than I. She wouldn’t haveknown anything of why Darken Rahl would have wanted to rid the world of you. Shecould have told you nothing.”“Well, even if he thought those of us born without the gift were inferior andjust plain worthless-if he wanted to exterminate the runts of the litter, so tospeak-why would his son, my half brother, want just as badly to kill me? Icouldn’t harm my father, and I can’t harm his son, yet Richard, too, sends quadsto hunt me.”Althea still didn’t looked convinced. “Are you sure they are Lord Rahl’s mendoing this? I just don’t see in the stones-”“They came into my house. They killed my mother. I saw them-I fought them. Theywere D’Haran soldiers.” She drew the knife from its sheath at her belt and heldthe handle up for the woman to see. “One was wearing this.”Althea’s gaze took it in with care, the way one would look upon anything deadly,but she said nothing.“Why would Lord Rahl kill my mother? Why does the House of Rahl want me dead?”“I don’t know the answer.” Althea lifted her hands and let them fall back to herlap. “I’m sorry, but that’s the truth.”Jennsen went to her knees before the woman. “Althea, please, even if you don’tknow why, I still need your help. Your sister wouldn’t help, she said only youcould. She said that only you can see the holes in the world. I don’t know whatthat means, but I know it has something to do with all this, with magic. Please,I need help.”The sorceress appeared puzzled. “And what is it you wish me to do?”“Hide me. Like you did when I was little. Cast a spell over me so that theywon’t know who I am or where to find me-so they can’t follow me. I just want tobe left alone. I need the spell that will hide me from Lord Rahl.“But it’s not just for me. I need it to help a friend, too. I need the spell tohide my true identity so that I can go back into the People’s Palace and get himout.”“Get him out? What do you mean? Who is this friend?”“His name is Sebastian. He helped me when the men attacked and murdered mymother. He saved my life. He brought me here, to see you. Your sister said weshould ask at the palace where we could find you. He traveled all that way withme, helped me get here, so I could come to see you to get the help I need. Wewent to the palace to find Friedrich so I could know where you lived, and whilewe were there the guards took Sebastian prisoner.“Don’t you see? He helped me and, because of that, they have him. They willsurely torture him. He was helping me-it’s my fault he’s in this trouble.Please, Althea, I need your help to get him out. I need a spell to hide me so Ican go back in and rescue him.”Incredulous, Althea stared. “Why do you think a spell could accomplish this?”“I don’t know. I don’t know anything about how magic works. I just know that Ineed its help-that I need a spell to hide my true identity.”The woman shook her head, as if she were dealing with a complete lunatic.“Jennsen, what you are envisioning is not how magic works. Do you think I cancast a web and you will then be able to walk into the palace and guards willsomehow fall under this spell and start unlocking doors for you?”“Well, I don’t know-”“Of course you don’t. That is why I’m telling you that it doesn’t work that way.Magic is not a key that opens doors for you. Magic is not somethingthat-poof-spontaneously solves problems. Magic would only compound the problems.If you have a bear in your tent, you don’t invite another in. Two bears will notbe better than the one.”“But Sebastian needs my help. I need the help of magic in order to get him thathelp.”“Were you to go in there, as you think, and use some kind of”-she waved a handaround as if trying to think of a word to describe it-”I don’t know, magic dustor something, to open prison doors to get your friend out, what do you supposewould happen? That you two could then go off happily and that would be the endof it?”“Well, I don’t know ... exactly . . .”Althea leaned forward on an elbow. “Don’t you suppose that the people who runthe palace would want to know how this happened, so they could prevent it fromhappening again? Don’t you suppose that some perfectly innocent people whose jobit is to guard doors there would be in a great deal of trouble for allowing aprisoner to escape and that they might suffer because of it? Don’t you supposethat the palace officials would want their escaped prisoner back? Don’t yousuppose, since such measures were used to get him out, that whatever threat theyfeared this friend of yours might represent, after such an escape they wouldthink that he must be even more dangerous than they originally believed? Don’tyou suppose that some perfectly innocent people might be hurt during the extrememeasures taken to apprehend such an escaped prisoner? Don’t you suppose theywould send out an army and the gifted to comb the countryside before he couldget far?“Don’t you even suppose,” the sorceress finally said in the gravest of tones,“that a wizard as powerful as the Lord Rahl of all of D’Hara might have somedecidedly nasty and painfully protracted fatal surprise in store for anyonedaring to use a pitiful old sorceress’s spell against him-and within his veryown palace walls on top of it?”Jennsen stared at the dark eyes fixed on her. “I never thought of all that. ““You are telling me something I already know.”“But ... how can I get Sebastian back? How can I help him?”“I would suppose you must figure a way to get him out-if he can be gotten out inthe first place-but it must be done in a way that takes all that I have said,and more, into account. Breaking a hole in the wall for him to step through tofreedom would bring out the hounds, now wouldn’t it? It would bring you troublemuch like magic would. You must instead think of a way that convinces them toturn him out on their own. Then they won’t be chasing you to have him back.”That all made sense to her. “How can I accomplish such a thing?”The sorceress shrugged. “If it can be done, I would wager that you can do it.After all, you have so far lived to grow into a fine young woman, escaped quads,found me, and got yourself in here, now didn’t you? You’ve accomplished much.You must only set your mind to it. But you don’t start out by picking up a stickand whacking a hornet’s nest.”“But I can’t see how I can do it without the help of magic. I’m a nobody. ““A nobody,” Althea scoffed as she leaned back. She was becoming a teacherimpatient with a student doing poorly on a lesson. “You are somebody; you areJennsen, a smart girl with a brain. You should not kneel before me and pleadignorance, telling me what you cannot do while asking instead for others to dofor you.“If you want to be a slave in life, then continue going around asking for othersto do for you. They will oblige, but you will find the price is your choices,your freedom, your life itself. They will do for you, and as a result you willbe in bondage to them forever, having given your identity away for a paltryprice. Then, and only then, you will be a nobody, a slave, because you yourselfand nobody else made it so.”“But, maybe, in this case, it’s different-”“The sun rises in the east; there are no special exceptions, just because youwish it. I know of what I speak, and I am telling you, magic is not the answer.What do you think? If you had a spell that they didn’t know you were DarkenRahl’s daughter, then they would fall over themselves to open doors for you?They will open the door of your friend’s cell for no one unless they think itshould be opened. It would make no difference if there were a spell to turn youinto a six-legged rabbit-they would still not open the doors you want openedjust because you were now a sixlegged rabbit by the hand of magic.”“But magic-”“Magic is a tool, not a solution.”Jennsen reminded herself to remain composed even though she wanted to seize thewoman by the shoulders and shake her until she agreed to help. Unlike withLathea, she did not intend to lose this chance for that help. “What do you mean,magic is not a solution? Magic is powerful.”“You have a knife. You showed it to me.”“That’s right.”“And when you are hungry do you wave your knife in someone’s face and demandtheir bread? No. You entice them to give you bread by giving them a coin inexchange.”“You mean you think they can be bribed?”Another sigh. “No. Of all I know, I can tell you that they cannot be bribed-atleast not in the conventional sense. However, the principle is not entirelywithout some parallel.“When Friedrich wishes bread, he doesn’t use his knife to take the bread fromthose who have it-at least not in the sense of how you wish to use magic. Heuses his knife as a tool to carve figures and then he gilds them. He sells whathe made with his knife, and then exchanges that coin for the bread.“You see? If he would use the knife-the tool-to directly solve the problem ofgetting bread, it would do him more harm in the end. He would be a thief andhunted as such. He uses his head, instead, and uses the knife as a tool tocreate something with the aid of his mind, thus solving the problem of obtainingbread with his knife.”“You mean, then, that I need to use magic indirectly? I must somehow use magicas a tool to help me?”Althea sighed heavily. “No, child. Forget magic. You must use your head. Magicis trouble. Use your head.”“I did,” Jennsen said. “It wasn’t easy, but I used my head to come to you to gethelp. It’s a spell I need now as a tool to help me-to hide me. In that way itwill be a tool, as you suggest.”Althea looked away into the hearth, watching the wavering flames. “I cannot helpyou in that way.”“I don’t think you understand. I’m hunted by powerful men. I just need a spellto hide my identity-like you did when I was little, when I lived at the palacewith my mother.”Still, the old woman stared off into the hearth. “I cannot do that. I don’t havethe power.”“But you do. You’ve already done it, once.” A lifetime of frustration, fear,loss, and futility surfaced, bringing with it bitter tears. “I didn’t travel allthis way, suffer all this hardship, to have you tell me no! Lathea told me no,told me that only you can see the holes in the world, and that only you couldhelp me. I must have your help, your spell, to hide me. Please, Althea, I’mbegging for my life.”Althea would not look her in the eyes. “I cannot cast a spell like that foryou.”Jennsen choked back the tears. “Please, Althea, I just want to be left alone.You have the power.”“I do not have what you’ve invented in your mind for me. I have helped you inthe only way I can.”“How can you sit here knowing that other people are suffering and dying-and nothelp? How can you be so selfish, Althea? How can you not help when I need it?”Friedrich put a hand under Jennsen’s arm, lifting her to her feet. “I’m sorry,but you’ve asked what you would. You’ve heard what Althea has to say. If you’rewise, you will use what you’ve learned to help yourself Now, it’s time for youto leave.”Jennsen pulled away. “All I want is the help of a spell! How can she be soselfish!”Friedrich’s eyes blazed with fury, even if his voice did not. “You have no rightto speak to us in that manner. You don’t know anything about it, about thesacrifices she’s made. It’s time for you to-”“Friedrich,” Althea said in a soft voice, “why don’t you make us some tea?”“Althea, there is no reason you should have to explain any of it-least of all toher.”Althea smiled up at him. “It’s all right.”“Explain what?” Jennsen asked.“My husband may sound harsh to you, but it’s because he doesn’t want me toburden you. He knows that some people leave here unhappy with the knowledge Igive them.” Her dark eyes turned up to her husband. “Make us some tea?”Friedrich’s face twisted with a long-suffering expression before he nodded inresignation.“What do you mean?” Jennsen asked. “What knowledge? What is it you aren’ttelling me?”As Friedrich went to a cupboard and retrieved a kettle and cups, setting thecups on the table, Althea gestured for Jennsen to sit on the pillow before her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23Jennsen made herself comfortable on the red and gold pillow on the floor infront of the sorceress.“Many years ago,” Althea began, clasping her hands in her lap atop herblack-and-white print dress, “more than you might believe, I traveled with mysister to the Old World, beyond the great barrier to the south.”Jennsen decided that, for the time being, it might be best just to keep quietand learn what she could, rather than bring up what she already knew-that thenew Lord Rahl, bent on conquest, had destroyed the great barrier to the south inorder to invade the Old World, and that Sebastian had come up from the Old Worldto try to find a way to help the emperor, Jagang the Just, stop the invadingD’Harans. She thought that maybe if she understood it all a little better,herself, then she might be able to come up with a way of convincing Althea tohelp her.“I went to the Old World to go to a place called the Palace of the Prophets,”Althea said. This, too, Jennsen had heard of from Sebastian. “I have a gift fora very primitive form of prophecy. I wanted to learn what I could about it,while my sister wished to learn about cures and such. I also wanted to learnthings about people like you.”“Me?” Jennsen said. “What do you mean?”“The ancestors of Darken Rahl were no different than he. They all eliminated anyungifted offspring they discovered had been born. Lathea and I were young andfull of fire to help those in need, and also those we felt were unjustlypersecuted. We wanted to use our gift to help change the world for the better.While we each hoped to study different things, we both went for much the samereasons.”Jennsen thought that seemed pretty close to how she felt and was just the kindof help she was talking about, but she also knew that right then was not themoment to say it. She asked, instead, “Why did you have to travel all the way tothe Palace of the Prophets to learn these things?”“The sorceresses there are renowned to have experience with many things, withwizards, and magic, and most of all, with matters to do with this world and withthe worlds beyond.”“Worlds beyond?” Jennsen gestured to the space outside the outer gilded ring onthe Grace setting not far away. “You mean, the world of the dead?”Althea leaned back as she reflected. “Well, yes, but not exactly. You understandthe Grace?” Althea waited for Jennsen’s nod. “The sorceresses at the Palace ofthe Prophets have knowledge about the interactions of the gift, the veil betweenworlds, and their interdependent relationships-how it all fits together. Theyare called the Sisters of the Light.”Jennsen recalled with a jolt that Sebastian had said that the Sisters of theLight were with Emperor Jagang, now. Sebastian had offered to take Jennsen tothe Sisters of the Light. He’d said he thought they might be able to help her.It had to be that they had something to do with the Creator’s Light, andespecially the gift, in the center of the Grace.Another thought came to her. “This has something to do with what Lathea said?That you could see the ... holes in the world, as she called it?”Althea smiled with the pleasure of a teacher seeing a student flirting withdiscovery. “That’s the tip of the tooth. You see, the ungifted offspring of theLord Rahl-of every Lord Rahl going back thousands of years-are different thananyone else. You are holes in the world to those of us with the gift.”“What does that mean, exactly-holes in the world?”“We are blind to you.”“Blind? But you see me. Lathea could see me, too. I don’t understand.”“Not blind with our eyes. Blind with our gift.” She swept an arm out towardFriedrich at the fire with an iron kettle, and then toward the window. “Thereare living things all around. You see them with your eyes-you see Friedrich andthe trees and such-just as I do, just as everyone does.” She held up a finger tomake her point. “But through my gift, I also see them.“While our eyes may perceive you, those of us with the gift cannot see you withthat aspect of ourselves. Darken Rahl could not see you any more than I can.Neither can the new Lord Rahl. To those of us with the gift, you are a hole inthe world.”“But, but,” Jennsen stammered in confusion, “that makes no sense. He’s beenhunting me. He sent men after me-they had my name on a piece of paper.”“They may hunt you, but only in the conventional sense. They cannot find youwith magic. His gift is blind to you. He has to use spies, bribes, and threatsto locate you, in addition to his wits and cunning. Were it not so, he mightsend some magic beast to reap your bones for him and be done with it, instead ofsending out men with your name written down on a piece of paper.”“You mean, I’m already invisible to him?”“No. I know you. I remember your red hair. I recognized you because I rememberyour mother, and you look like her. I know you in those ways-the ways anybodyknows and recognizes someone. Darken Rahl, were he alive, might recognize you ifhe remembered your mother. Others who knew him might well see some of him inyou, as I do, in addition to your mother’s looks. He could know you in all thosesame ways common to one without the gift. He can find you by ordinary means. Ofcourse, if he or one with the gift were to actually lay eyes on you, they wouldrealize you are an ungifted offspring of a Rahl-because they could see you.“But, he could not find you with magic. That he cannot do. To those of us withthe gift, you are in many ways like everyone else, except that you are a hole inthe world.”Jennsen was frowning. She only realized it when Althea tapped her thumbstogether, thinking, in response to that face.“When I was at the Palace of the Prophets,” Althea finally said, “I knew a womanthere, a sorceress, like me, named Adie. She had traveled alone to the Old Worldfrom a far-off land in order to learn what she could. But Adie was blind.”“Blind? She could travel alone when she was blind?”Althea smiled at the memory of the woman. “Oh yes. With the use of her gift,rather than her eyes. All sorceress-all people with the gift have uniqueabilities. On top of that, in some the gift is stronger, like people who havebig muscles are stronger than me. Like Friedrich. He is stronger in muscles. Youhave hair like other people, but yours is red. Some have blond, or black, orbrown. Despite what things people have in common, each person has differentattributes.“It’s like that with the gift. It’s not only different in its aspects, but thepower of those aspects differ. With some, it’s very strong, with some, weak.Each of us is an individual. We’re all unique in our ability, our gift, the sameas you are unique in other ways.”“And what about your friend, Adie?”“Ah, well, Adie’s eyes were completely white-blind-but she had learned the trickof seeing with her gift. The gift told her more about the world around her thanmy eyes told me. Adie could see people better with her gift than I could with myeyes. Much like when people who don’t have the gift go blind, they depend moreon their hearing, so they learn to hear more than you or I.“Adie did that with her gift. She saw by sensing that infinitesimal spark of theCreator’s gift that everything has-life itself, and more: Creation.“The point is that, to me, to Darken Rahl, to Adie, you do not exist. You are ahole in the world.”For reasons Jennsen could not at first comprehend, terror washed through her.And then the sense of her terror began to take shape. She could feel her eyesfilling with tears.“The Creator didn’t give me life, like everyone else? I came to exist in someother way? I’m some kind of . . . monster? My father wanted to have me killedbecause I’m some monstrosity of nature?”“No, no, child,” Althea said as she leaned forward and stroked a comforting handdown Jennsen’s hair, “that is not at all what I mean.”Jennsen tried mightily to contain the new shape of dread. Through watery vision,she saw Althea’s concerned face gazing down at her. “I’m not even part ofCreation. That’s why the gift can’t sense me. The Lord Rahl only wanted to ridthe world of an error of nature, an evil thing.”“Jennsen, don’t put words where I have not. Listen to me, now.”Jennsen nodded as she wiped under her eyes. “I’m listening.”“Just because you’re different, that doesn’t make you evil.”“Just what am I, then, if not a monster untouched by Creation?”“My dear child, you are a pillar of Creation.”“But you said-”“I said that those with the gift cannot see you with it. I did not say that youdon’t exist, or that you are not as the rest of us, a part of Creation.”“Then why am I one of those ... things? One of those holes in the world?”Althea shook her head. “I don’t know, child. But our lack of knowledge does notprove something evil. An owl can see at night. Does it make you evil becausepeople can’t see you while the owl can? One person’s limitations don’t conferwickedness on another. It shows only one thing: the existence of limitations.”“But all the offspring of the Lord Rahl are like this?”She considered carefully before answering. “The genuinely ungifted ones, yes.Those who are born with at least some tiny aspect of the gift are not. Thataspect can be so infinitesimal and unusable that it would not even be recognizedto exist by anyone in any other way aside from this one. For all practicalpurposes, those offspring would be thought of as ungifted, except that theywould have this quality that would keep them from being like you-holes in theworld. It also makes them vulnerable. This kind of offspring can be found withmagic and thus eliminated.”“Could it be that most of the offspring of Lord Rahl are like that, and thoselike me, holes in the world, are actually the ones who are more rare?”“Yes,” Althea admitted quietly.Jennsen sensed an undercurrent of tension in the single word answer. “Are yousuggesting that there is something more to all of this than just that we areholes in the world to the gifted?”“Yes. That was one of the reasons I went to study with the Sisters of the Light.I wanted to better understand the interrelationship of the gift with life as weknow it-with Creation.”“Did you discover anything? Were the Sisters of the Light able to help you?”“Unfortunately, no.” Althea gazed off in reflection. “Few if any would agreewith me, but I have come to suspect that all people, with the single exceptionof those like you-offspring of a Lord Rahl born wholly without the gift-havethis imperceptible spark of magic that, while intangible in every other way,connects them to the gifted, and thus to the greater world of Creation.”“I don’t understand what this would mean for me, or for anyone else.”Althea slowly shook her head. “There is more to this, Jennsen, than I know. Isuspect there is something far more important involved.”Jennsen couldn’t imagine what that could be. “How many offspring are bornentirely without the gift?”“As far as I’ve learned, it’s exceedingly rare for more than one offspring ofeach Lord Rahl to be born with the gift, as we think of it-his seed conceivesbut one true heir.” Althea held up a finger as she leaned forward. “But it ispossible that, while the others are ungifted in the conventional sense, manyhave this otherwise invisible and sterile spark of the gift so that they aredetected and destroyed before others, like me, know of them.“It is entirely possible that those like you are the ones who are truly rare, asis the single formally gifted heir, and that’s why you survived for those likeme to notice, thus slanting our idea of which kind is rare, and which common. AsI said, I think there is far more to this than I know or can understand. But ofthose truly like you, devoid of even this otherwise imperceptible glimmer of thegift, all are-”“Pillars of Creation,” Jennsen said, sarcastically.Althea chuckled. “Perhaps that sounds better.”“But to the gifted, we are holes in the world.”Althea’s smile withered. “It is so. Were Adie here, blind as she is with hereyes and seeing only with her gift, were you to stand before her she would seeeverything but you. She would be blind to you. To Adie, able to see with thegift only, you would truly be a hole in the world.”“That doesn’t make me feel very good about myself.”Althea’s smile returned. “Don’t you see, child? It proves only the limitation.To one who is blind, everyone is a hole in the world.”Jennsen thought it over. “Then, it’s only a matter of perception. Some peopleare simply lacking the ability to perceive me in one narrow way.”Althea gave her a single nod. “That’s right. But because those with the giftoften use their ability without conscious thought, like you use your vision,it’s very disturbing to those with the gift to encounter one such as you. ““Disturbing? Why is it disturbing?”“It’s troubling when your senses do not agree.”“But they can still see me, so why do I trouble them?”“Well, imagine if you heard a voice but you could see no source for it.”Jennsen didn’t have to imagine that. She understood quite well how troublingthat was.“Or imagine,” the sorceress said, “if you could see me, but when you reached outto touch me, your hand passed through me as if I wasn’t here. Wouldn’t thattrouble you?”“I suppose,” Jennsen conceded. “Is there anything else about us that’sdifferent? Other than that we are holes in the world to those with the gift?”“I don’t know. It’s exceedingly rare to come across one such as you who is stillalive. While it’s possible that others exist, and I once heard a rumor that onelived with the healers called the Raug’Moss, I only know of you for certain.”When Jennsen had been very young, she had visited the healers, the Raug’Moss,with her mother. “Do you know the name?”“Drefan was the name whispered, but I don’t know if it’s true. Even if it is,the likelihood of him still being alive would be remote. The Lord Rahl is theLord Rahl. He is his own law. Darken Rahl, like most of his ancestors, probablyfathered many children. Hiding the knowledge of such a child’s paternity isdangerous. Few would risk it, so most of your kind were known and immediatelyput to death. The rest are eventually found.”Thinking out loud, Jennsen asked, “Could it be that we’re like this as a form ofprotection? There are animals that have special traits when they’re born thathelp them survive. Fawns, for example, have spots to hide them, to make theminvisible to predators-make them holes in the world.”Althea smiled at the notion. “I suppose that could be as good an explanation asany. Knowing magic, though, I would expect the reason to be more complex.Everything seeks balance. The deer and the wolves strike a balance-the fawns’spots help them survive, but that threatens the existence of wolves who needfood. Such things go back and forth. If the wolves ate all the fawns, then thedeer would die out and the wolves, if they had no other source of food, wouldalso die out because they had altered the balance between them and the deer.They coexist in a balance that allows both species to survive, but at the costof some individuals.“With magic, balance is critical. What on the surface may seem simple oftenturns out to have much more complex causes. I suspect that, with those like you,an elaborate form of balance is being struck, and that being a hole in the worldis merely an ancillary indication.”“And maybe some of the balance is that, like some fawns are caught despite theirspots, some with the gift are able to see me? Your sister said you could see theholes in the world.”“No, I can’t really. I simply learned a few tricks with the gift, in much thesame way Adie did.” Jennsen frowned, feeling bewildered again, so Althea asked,“Can you see a bird on a moonless night?”“No. If there’s not even a moon, it’s impossible.”“Impossible? No, not entirely.” Althea pointed skyward, moving her hand as ifsuggesting something passing overhead. “You will see the stars go dark where thebird passes. If you watch the holes in the sky, you will in a way be seeing thebirds.”“Just a different way of seeing.” Jennsen smiled at such a clever notion. “So,that’s how you see those like me?”“That comparison is the easiest way I can explain it to you. Both, though, havelimitations. It only works to see the bird at night if they’re flying against abackground of stars, if there are no clouds, and so on. With those like you,it’s much the same. I simply learned a trick to help me see those like you, butit’s very limited.”“When you went to the Palace of the Prophets, did you learn about your abilityfor prophecy? Maybe that could somehow help with what I need to do?”“Nothing in relation to prophecy would be of any use to you.”“But why not?”Althea tilted her head forward, as if to question whether or not Jennsen hadbeen paying attention. “Where does prophecy come from?”“Prophets. ““And prophets are strongly gifted with that ability. Prophecy is one form ofmagic. But the gifted cannot see you with their gift, remember? To them, you area hole in the world. Therefore, prophecy, since it comes through prophets,cannot see you, either.“I have a wisp of ability for prophecy, but I am no prophet. When I was with theSisters of the Light, since such things were one of my fields of interest, Ispent decades in their vaults studying prophecy. They had been written down bygreat prophets throughout the ages. I can tell you both from personalexperience, and from all that I read, that the prophecies are as blind to you aswould be Adie. As far as the prophecies are concerned, your kind never existed,do not exist now, and never will exist.”Jennsen sat back on her heels. “Hole in the world, indeed.”“At the Palace of the Prophets, I met a prophet, Nathan, and, while I learnednothing about those like you, I learned some about my talent. Mostly, I onlylearned how limited it is. Eventually, the things I learned there came to hauntme.”“What do you mean?”“The Palace of the Prophets was created many thousands of years ago and is likeno other place that I know of. A unique spell surrounds the entire palace andgrounds. It distorts the way in which those under the spell age.”“It changed you, then, in some way?”“Oh, yes. It changes everyone. Aging is slowed for those living under the spellof the Palace of the Prophets. While those outside the palace went about theirlives and aged roughly ten to fifteen years, those of us in the palace aged onlyone year.”Jennsen made a skeptical face. “How could such a thing be?”“Nothing ever stays the same. The world is always changing. The world back inthe great war three thousand years ago was much different. The world has changedsince then. When the great barrier to the south of D’Hara was put up, wizardswere different. They had vast power, back then.”“Darken Rahl had vast power.”“No. Darken Rahl, as powerful as he was, was nothing compared to the wizards ofthat time. They could control powers Darken Rahl only dreamed of.”“So, wizards like that, with that kind of vast power, all died out? There havebeen no wizards like them born since?”Althea stared off as she answered in a grave tone. “Not since that great war hasthere been one like that born. Even wizards themselves have come to be born lessand less often. But for the first time in three thousand years, one has againbeen born. Your half brother, Richard, is such a man.”It turned out her pursuer was far more fearsome than Jennsen had given himcredit for, even in her all too vivid imagination. Small wonder that her motherhad been murdered and Lord Rahl’s men were so close on Jennsen’s heels. ThisLord Rahl was altogether more powerful and dangerous than had been their father.“Because this was such an epochal event, some of those at the Palace of theProphets knew of Richard long before he was born. There was much anticipationover this one, this war wizard.”“War wizard?” Jennsen didn’t like the sound of that.“Yes. There was much controversy as to the meaning of the prophecy of hisbirth--even to the meaning of the term ‘war wizard.’ While at the palace, I hada chance on two brief occasions to meet the prophet I mentioned, Nathan. NathanRahl.”Jennsen’s mouth fell open. “Nathan Rahl? You mean, a real Rahl?”Althea smiled not only at the memory, but at Jennsen’s surprise. “Oh yes, a realRahl. Commanding, powerful, clever, charming, and inconceivably dangerous. Theykept him locked away behind impenetrable shields of magic, where he could causeno harm, yet he sometimes managed it. Yes, a real Rahl. Over nine hundred yearsold, he was, too.”“That’s impossible,” Jennsen insisted before she had time to think better of it.Friedrich, standing over her, harrumphed. He handed a steaming cup of tea to hiswife and then passed one down to Jennsen. With the question in her eyes, Jennsenlooked back at Althea.“I am close to two hundred years old,” Althea said.Jennsen just stared. Althea looked old, but not that old.“In part, this business with my age and how the spell slowed my aging is how Icame to have dealings with you and your mother when you were young.” Altheasighed heavily and took a sip of tea. “Which brings me back to the story athand, to what you wanted to know-why I cannot help you with magic.”Jennsen sipped, then glanced up at Friedrich, who looked about as old as Althea.“Are you that age, too?”“No,” he gibed, “Althea robbed the cradle for me.”Jennsen saw the looks that passed between them, the kind of intimate glancesbetween two people who were close. Jennsen could see in the eyes of these twothat they could read each other’s slightest expression. She and her mother hadbeen like that, able to see thoughts in the slightest movement of the eyes ofthe other. It was the kind of communication she thought was facilitated not onlythrough familiarity, but through love and respect.“I met Friedrich when I returned from the Old World. I had aged only about thesame as Friedrich. I had lived a much longer time, of course, but my body hadnot aged to show it because I had been under the spell of the Palace of theProphets.“When I came back, I became involved in a number of things, and one of them washow I might help those such as you.”Jennsen hung on every word. “That’s when you met my mother?”“Yes. You see, the spell at the palace, the spell that altered time, sparked anidea of how I might help those like you. I knew that regular means of castingwebs-magic-around your kind never seemed to work out. Others had tried butfailed; the offspring were killed. I struck on the idea, instead, to cast theweb, not on you, but on those who came into contact with you and your mother.”Jennsen leaned forward expectantly, feeling sure that she was finally getting tothe core of what might prove to be the help she sought. “What did you do? Whatsort of magic?”“I used magic to alter people’s perception of time itself.”“I don’t understand. What did that do?”“Well, the only way Darken Rahl could search for you was as I’ve explained-byusing regular means. I tinkered with those regular means. I made it so thatthose who knew of you perceive time differently.”“I still don’t understand. How-what-did you make them perceive? Time is time.”Althea leaned forward with a cunning smile. “I made them think you were justborn.”“When?”“All the time. Whenever they found out some thread of news about you, as a childfathered by Darken Rahl, they perceived you, and reported you, as newborn. Whenyou were two months, ten months, four years, five years, six years old, theywere all still looking for a newborn, despite how long they had known of you.The spell slowed their perception of time, in relation to you alone, so thatthey were always looking for a newborn baby, rather than a girl growing up.“In this way, until you were six, I hid you right under their noses. That threweveryone’s calculations off by six years. To this day, anyone who suspected yourexistence would believe you to be around fourteen or so, when you are actuallymore than twenty, because they thought you were newborn when the spell ended,when you were six. That’s when they began to mark your age.”Jennsen rose up onto her knees. “But that could work. You must only do it again.If you were to cast a spell like that for me now, like you did when I waslittle, it would work the same, wouldn’t it? Then they wouldn’t know I was grownup. They wouldn’t be hunting me. They would be looking for a newborn. Please,Althea, just do that again. Do what you did once before.”From the corner of her eye, Jennsen saw Friedrich, now sitting at his bench in aback room, turn away. By the look on Althea’s face, Jennsen knew that she hadsomehow said the wrong thing, and precisely what the sorceress had planned onher saying Jennsen realized that this had been a trap of sorts, and she had justtalked herself right into it.“I was young and masterful in my skill with magic,” Althea said. In her darkeyes glimmered the spark of recollection of that grand time in her life. “Inthousands of years, few had been through the great barrier and back. I had, Ihad studied with the Sisters of the Light, had audiences with their Prelate, andwith the great prophet. I had accomplished such things as few others had. I waswell over a hundred years old and still young, with a handsome and charming newhusband who believed I could walk to the moon and back if the fancy struck me.“I was well over a hundred years of age, yet still youthful, with a full lifeahead of me; wise with age, yet still young. I was clever, oh so clever, andpowerful in my gift. I was experienced, knowledgeable, and attractive, with manyfriends and a circle of people who hung on my every worldly pronouncement.”With long graceful fingers, Althea pulled up the hem of her skirt, uncoveringher legs.Jennsen drew back at the sight.She saw, then, why Althea had not stood before; her legs were withered,deformed, shriveled bones covered with a dry veneer of pallid flesh, as if theyhad died years ago, but never been buried because the rest of her was stillliving. Jennsen didn’t know how the woman could keep from screaming in constantanguish.“You were six,” the sorceress said in a terribly calm and quiet voice, whenDarken Rahl finally discovered what I had done. He was a very ingenious man.Much more shrewd, as it turned out, than a young sorceress of a hundred-oddyears in age.“I only had time to tell my sister to warn your mother, before he caught me.”Jennsen remembered running. When she was little, she and her mother had fled thepalace. It had been night. It had been shortly after a visitor had come to theirdoor. In the dark hall, there had been whispering. And then they had fled.“But, he ... he didn’t kill you?” Jennsen swallowed. “He showed you mercy-hespared your life.”Althea chuckled without humor. It was an empty laugh at encountering aprofoundly naive notion.“Darken Rahl did not always believe in simply killing those who displeased him.He preferred, instead, that they should live a good long time; death would havebeen a release, you see. If they were dead, how could they regret, how couldthey suffer, how could they serve as an example to others?“You cannot imagine, and I could not begin to tell you, the terror of such acapture, of the long walk to be taken before him, of what it was like being inthe grip of that man, of what it was like to look up into his calm face, hiscold blue eyes, and know you were at the mercy of a man who had none. You cannotimagine what it was like to know in that single terrible instant, thateverything you were, everything you had, everything you had hoped for in life,was about to forever change.“The pain was what you might expect, I suppose. Perhaps my legs can partlyattest to it.”“I’m so sorry,” Jennsen whispered through her tears, hands pressed over herheartache.“But the pain was not the worst of it. Not the worst by far. He stripped me ofeverything I had, but took for granted. He did to my power, to my gift, worsethan he did to my legs. You just cannot see it-you are blind to it. Every day, Isee it. That hurt, I assure you, you cannot begin to imagine.“Even all that, though, was not enough for Darken Rahl. His displeasure at whatI had done to hide you had only begun. He banished me here, to this sunken, foulplace of hot springs and sickening vapors. He imprisoned me here, filling inabout me a swamp with monstrosities created by the very power he had strippedfrom me. He wanted me close, you see. Several times he visited, just to beholdme in my prison.“I’m at the mercy of those things out there that are given life by my own gift,a gift to which I no longer have access. I could never drag myself out by myarms alone, but even if I were to try, or if I had the help of another, thosebeasts, created from my own power, would rip me apart. I can’t call them backeven to save myself.“He left a path, in the front, so that provisions and supplies could be broughtin, so I would be sure to have the things I needed. Friedrich had to build ahome for us, here, because I cannot ever leave. Darken Rahl wished me a longlife-a life I could spend suffering for displeasing him.”Jennsen trembled as she listened, unable to say anything. Althea lifted a handto point with one long graceful finger toward the back room.“That man, who loves me, had to witness it all. Friedrich was thus condemned toa life of tending to a crippled wife he loved, who could no longer be a wife tohim in ways of the flesh.”She ran a hand over her bony limbs, tenderly, as if seeing them as they oncewere. “I have never again had the joy of being with my husband as a woman iswith a man. My husband never again was able to share and enjoy the intimatecharms of the woman he loves.”She paused to regain her composure before going on. “As part of my punishment,Darken Rahl left me with the power to use my gift in the one way which wouldhaunt me every day: prophecy.”Jennsen could not help herself from asking, thinking that this must be onethread of possible comfort left to the woman. “It’s part of your gift can’t itbring you some joy?”Dark eyes fixed on her again. “Did you enjoy the last day with your mother-theday before she died?”“Yes,” Jennsen finally said.“Did you laugh and talk with her?”“Yes.”“What if you had known that the next day she was to be murdered? What if you sawit all, long before it happened? Days, weeks, or even years before? Knew whatwas to happen, when, every ghastly detail? Saw, by the power of your magic, thehorrifying sight of it, the blood, the agony, the dying. Would that please you?Would you still have experienced that joy, that laughter?”Jennsen answered in a small voice. “No.”“So you see, Jennsen Rahl, I cannot help you, not because I am selfish, as youput it, but because even if I were willing, I have no power left to cast you aspell. You must find within yourself the ability to help yourself, the free willto accomplish what you must. Only in that way can you truly succeed in life.“I cannot give you a spell to solve your problems. I have spent a good deal ofmy life suffering for the last spell I cast for you. Were it only me, I wouldendure it willingly, for I was doing what I believe in; this is the fault of anevil man, not the fault of an innocent child. Yet I suffer each day because itwas not just my life forfeit, but Friedrich’s, too. He might have-”“I might have nothing.” He had come up behind Jennsen. “I have considered eachday of my life a privilege because you are in it. Your smile is the sun, gildedby the Creator Himself, and brightens my small existence. If this is the pricefor all of that I have gained, then I paid it willingly. Don’t devaluate thequality of my joy, Althea, by minimizing it or trivializing it.”Althea looked back down at Jennsen. “You see? This is my daily torture: knowingwhat I have not been able to be, to do, for this man.”Jennsen withered, sobbing, at the woman’s feet.“Magic,” Althea whispered from above, “is trouble you don’t need.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24Jennsen’s thoughts were lost in a forlorn fog. The swamp was only there becauseit was beneath her feet, around her, above her, but her mind was in a moreconfused and tangled jumble than all the twisted things around her. So much ofwhat she believed had turned out to be wrong. That meant that not only were manyof her hopes lost, but her solutions, too.Worse yet, Jennsen had come face-to-face with the misery, hardship, andheartbreak her existence had ended up causing others who had tried to help her.Through the tears she could hardly see her way. She moved almost blindly throughthe mire.She stumbled at times, crawled when she fell, sobbing in racking agony when shepaused, supported by the limb of an old, gnarled tree. It was like the day ofher mother’s murder all over again-the anguish, the confusion, the insanity ofit all, the bitter despair-but this time for Althea’s tortured life.Staggering through the dense growth, Jennsen grasped vines for support as shewept. Since her mother’s death, finding the sorceress and getting her help hadgiven Jennsen’s life a direction, a goal. She didn’t know what to do, now. Shefelt lost, in the midst of her life.Jennsen wound her way through an area where steam rose from fissures. All abouther, angry vapor bellowed as it was unleashed from underground in billowingclouds. She plodded past the stench of the boiling vents and back into the thickgrowth. Thorny bushes scratched her hands, broad leaves slashed at her face.Reaching a dark pool she vaguely remembered, Jennsen shuffled along the ledge,gripping rocks for handholds, weeping as she made her way along the brink. Rockcrumbled and came away in her hand. She fought to keep her balance as shesnatched for another handhold, catching on just in time to keep herself fromfalling.She gazed over her shoulder, through blurry vision, at the dark expanse ofwater. Jennsen wondered if it might be better were she to fall, better to beswallowed into the depths and be done with it. It looked a sweet embrace, agentle end to it all. It looked like the peace she sought. Peace at last.If she could just die there, on the spot, the impossible struggle would be over.The heartache and sorrow would be ended. Maybe, then, she could be with hermother and the other good spirits in the underworld.She doubted, though, that the good spirits took people who murdered themselves.To take a life, except to defend life, was wrong. If Jennsen were to give up,all that her mother had done, all her sacrifices, would be for nothing. Hermother, waiting in eternity, might not forgive Jennsen for throwing her lifeaway.Althea, too, had lost nearly everything to help her. How could Jennsen ignoresuch bravery-not just Althea’s, but Friedrich’s, too? Despite how miserablyresponsible she felt, she could not throw her only life away.She felt, though, as if she had stolen Althea’s chance at life. Despite what thewoman had said, Jennsen felt a sense of burning shame for what Althea hadsuffered. Althea would be imprisoned in this miserable swamp forever, every daypaying the price of having tried to hide Jennsen from Darken Rahl. Jennsen’smind might have been telling her that it was Darken Rahl’s doing, but her ownheart said otherwise. Althea would never have her own life back, be free towalk, free to go where she would, free to have the joy of her own gift.What right had Jennsen to expect others to help her, anyway? Why should othersforfeit their life, their freedom, for her sake? What gave her the right to asksuch sacrifice of them? Jennsen’s mother was not the only one to suffer becauseof her. Althea and Friedrich were chained to the swamp, Lathea had beenmurdered, and Sebastian was now held prisoner. Even Tom, waiting for her up inthe meadow, had set aside earning his living to come to her aid.So many people had tried to help her and paid a terrible price. Where had sheever gotten the idea that she could shackle others to her wishes? Why shouldthey have to relinquish their lives and needs for hers? But how could she go onwithout their help?Free of the ledge and deep pool, Jennsen trudged on through an endless tangle ofroots. They seemed to deliberately catch her feet. Twice, she fell sprawling.Both times she got up and continued on.The third time she fell, she hit her face so hard the pain stunned her. Jennsenran her fingers over her cheekbone, her forehead, thinking something surely mustbe broken. She found no blood, nor protruding bone. Lying there among the rootslike so many snakes coiled all about her, she felt shame for all the trouble shehad brought to people’s lives.And then she felt anger.Jennsen.She recalled her mother’s words: “Don’t you ever wear a cloak of guilt becausethey are evil.”Jennsen pushed herself up on her arms. How many others might have tried to helpthose like Jennsen, the offspring of a Lord Rahl, and paid with their lives? Howmany more would? Why should they. like Jennsen, not have their own lives?It was the Lord Rahl who bore the responsibility for lives ruined.Jennsen. Surrender.Would it never stop?Grushdeva du kalt misht.Sebastian was only the latest. Was he being tortured that very moment because ofher? Was he paying with his life, too, for helping her?Surrender.Poor Sebastian. She felt a pang of longing for him. He had been so good to helpher. So brave. So strong.Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht.The voice, insistent, commanding, echoed around in her head, whispering thewords that made no sense. She staggered to her feet. Could she never have herown life-not even her own mind? Must she always be pursued, by Lord Rahl, by thevoice?Jenn-“Leave me be!”She had to help Sebastian.She was moving again, putting one foot in front of the other, pushing vines andleaves and branches aside, cutting through the underbrush. The thick mist anddense canopy of leaves made it dark as dusk. She had no idea how late in the dayit was. It had taken a lot of time to reach Althea’s place. She had been there along time. For all Jennsen knew, it might be near dusk. At best, it could be noearlier than late afternoon. She had hours left before she made it back to themeadow where Tom waited.She had come for help, but that help had been an illusion invented in her ownmind. She had relied on her mother her whole life, and then she had expectedAlthea to help her. She had to accept that it was up to her to do what wasnecessary to help herself.Jennsen. Surrender.“No! Leave me alone!”She was so very tired of it all. Now she was angry, too.Jennsen plunged onward through the swamp, splashing through water, steppingalong roots and rocks when they were available. She had to help Sebastian. Shehad to get back to him. Tom was waiting. Tom would take her back.But what then? How was she going to get him out? She had depended on Althea tohelp her with some kind of magic. Now she knew there could be no such help.Panting from the effort of running through the swamp, she halted when she cameto the expanse of water where the snake had been before. Jennsen gazed out atthe silent, still expanse of water, but didn’t see anything. No roots that werereally a snake protruded above the surface. It was getting gloomy. She couldn’ttell if anything lurked in the dark shadows beneath leaves drooping over thebanks.Sebastian’s life hung in the balance. Jennsen waded into the water.Halfway in, she remembered that she had promised herself that she was going totake a staff to help keep her balance when she returned through the open water.She paused, debating whether or not she should go back to cut a staff. Goingback was just as far as going on, so she kept going. Feeling with her feet, shefound a firm bottom of roots, real roots, and stepped carefully along them.Surprisingly, as long as she stayed on the roots the water came up only to herknees and she was able to hold up her skirts to keep them dry as she wadedthrough the murky water.Something bumped her leg. Jennsen flinched. She saw the flash of scales. Herfoot slipped. She saw with heady relief that it was only a fish darting away.Trying to get her balance, to regain her footing, Jennsen stepped heavily intothe bottomless black depths. She only had time for a short gasp before she wasunder the water.Darkness surrounded her. She saw a whirl of bubbles as she went under.Surprised, she kicked frantically, trying to find bottom, something, anything,to stop her descent. There was nothing. She was in deep water, weighted down bywet clothes. Rather than support her, now, her heavy boots dragged her under.Jennsen flailed her arms, splashing at the surface just long enough to gasp abreath before she was under again. The shock of it was startling. With all herstrength, she moved her arms, trying to swim to the surface, but her clotheswere like a net around her, dampening and hampering any effective action. Eyeswide in fright, red hair floating. she could see shafts of the dim lightwavering and glittering, piercing the murky depths around her.It was all happening so shockingly fast. In spite of how she was trying to seizelife, it was slipping through her fingers. It didn’t seem real.Jennsen.Shapes moved closer around her. Her lungs aching for air, Althea said that noone could come through the swamp by the back way. There were beasts back herethat would tear people apart. Jennsen had been lucky once. In the grip ofterror, she saw a dark shape moving closer. She was not to be lucky twice.She didn’t want to die. She knew she had thought that she did, but she knew nowthat she didn’t. It was her only life. Her precious life. She didn’t want tolose it.She tried to swim toward the surface, toward the light, but everything seemed soslow, so thick, so heavy.Jennsen.The voice sounded urgent.Jennsen.Something bumped her. She saw flashes of iridescent green.It was the snake.Could she, she would have screamed. Struggling, but unable to get away, shecould only watch as the dark length of the thing underneath rolled up aroundher.Jennsen was too exhausted to fight. Her lungs burned for air as she saw herselfsinking down through the shafts of light, getting farther and farther from thesurface, from life. She tried to swim to that light and air, but her leaden armsmerely waved, like weed drifting in the water. It was surprising to her, sinceshe could swim.Jennsen.Now, she was going to drown.Dark coils surrounded her.With all her clothes on, her heavy cloak, her knife, her boots, and as weary asshe had been, not to mention her surprise and her half breath before goingunder, her ability to swim had been overwhelmed.It hurt.She had thought drowning would be the sweet embrace of gentle waters. It wasnot. It hurt worse than anything had ever hurt. The feeling of helplesssuffocation was horrifying. The pain crushing her chest was sharp andunbearable. She desperately wanted it to stop. She struggled in the wateragainst the pain, the panic, consumed with the urgent need of air. Her throatwas locked tight, terrified she might gasp in water, so badly did she need abreath.It hurt.Jennsen felt the coils of the snake under her, touching her, caressing her. Shewondered if she should have tried to kill it when she’d had the chance. Shesupposed she could pull her knife, now. But she was so weak.It hurt.The coils pushed against her. In the silent darkness, she had stoppedstruggling. There was no reason.Jennsen.She wondered why the voice didn’t ask her to surrender, the way it always did.She thought it ironic, since she was at last resigned, that the voice didn’task, but only called her name.Jennsen felt something bump her shoulder. Something hard. Another bumped herhead. Then her thigh.She was being pushed against the bank where the roots went down into the water.Almost without realizing what she was doing, she seized the roots and pulledwith sudden desperation. The thing under her continued its gentle push up.Jennsen broke the surface. Water sluiced off her head in a sudden rush of sound.Mouth open wide, she gasped wildly at the air. She pulled herself up enough tothrow her shoulders up onto the knotted roots. She couldn’t drag herself therest of the way out of the water, but at least her head was up, and she couldbreathe. Her leg s dangled, drifting, floating in the water,Panting, with her eyes closed, Jennsen clung to the roots with trembling fingersto keep herself from slipping back into the water. The desperate pulls of airfelt wonderful as they filled her lungs. With each breath, she could feel herstrength returning.Finally, inch by inch, hand over hand, pulling against the roots, she managed todrag herself up onto the bank. She flopped on her side, panting, coughing,shivering, watching the water lapping only inches away. She felt giddy with thesimple joy of breathing air.She saw then the snake’s head break the surface, easily, gracefully, silently.Yellow eyes in the black band watched her. They stared at each other for a time.“Thank you,” Jennsen whispered.The snake, having seen her there on the bank, seen her breathing, seen herliving, slipped back into the water.Jennsen had no idea what it had thought, or why it hadn’t tried to kill her,again, when it had an easy chance at it. Maybe, after the first time, it thoughtshe might be too big to eat, or might suddenly fight back.But why help her? Could it be a sign of respect? Maybe it simply viewed her ascompetition for food, and wanted her out of its territory but didn’t want tofight her again. Jennsen had no idea why it had pushed her to the surface, butthe snake had saved her life. She hated snakes, and this one had saved her fromdrowning.One of the things that she had feared most had been her salvation.Still trying to catch her breath, to say nothing of recovering her wits aftercoming so close to passing through the veil into death, she began moving again,on her hands and knees, crawling up higher. Water ran from her clothes and hair.She couldn’t get to her feet, yet, didn’t trust her legs, yet, so she crawled.It felt good just to be able to move. Before long, she had recovered enough tostagger her feet. She had to keep going. Her time was running out.Walking revived her further. She had always liked to walk. It made her feelalive again, like her old self. She knew she wanted to live. She wantedSebastian to live, too.Hurrying through the tangle of vines and thorny shrubs, over the twisted rootsand among the trees, her worry eased when she came at last to the place wherethe rock began to rise up from the mossy ground. She started up the spine ofrock, relieved to have found the landmark among the trackless swamp and to beclimbing out of the wet boggy bottom. It was getting darker by the moment andshe remembered that it was a long way up. Jennsen desperately didn’t want tospend the night in the swamp, but she didn’t want to be scaling the spine ofrock in the dark, either.Those fears spurred her on. While there was still light enough, she had to keepmoving. When she stumbled, she recalled how in places the ground dropped offprecipitously to the sides. She admonished herself to be more careful. Nohelpful snake would catch her if she plummeted off a cliff in the dark.While she made her way up, she kept going over in her mind everything thatAlthea had told her, hoping that something in it might be helpful. Jennsendidn’t know how she could get Sebastian out, but she knew she had to try-she washis only hope. He had saved her life, before; she had to help save his, now.She wanted desperately to see his smile, his blue eyes, his spikes of whitehair. She couldn’t bear the thought of them torturing him. She had to get himout of their clutches.But how was she to accomplish such an impossible task? First, she had to getback there, she decided. Hopefully, by then, she would think of a way.Tom would get her back to the palace. Tom would be waiting, worrying. Tom. Whyhad Tom helped her? The nugget of that question stuck out in her mind like alandmark to an answer, like the spine of rock lead up and out of the swamp. Shejust didn’t know where it led.Tom had helped her. Why?She focused her mind on that question as she trudged up the steep rise. He saidhe couldn’t live with himself if he watched her go out onto the Azrith Plainsalone, with no supplies. He said she would die and he couldn’t let that happen.That seemed a decent enough sentiment.She knew there was more, though. He seemed determined to help her, almost as ifhe was duty bound. He never really questioned what it was she had to do, onlyher method of going about it, then did what he could to assist her.Tom said that she should tell Lord Rahl about his help, that he was a good man.That memory kept nagging at her. Even though it had been an offhand comment,he’d been serious. But what had he meant?She kept turning it over in her mind as she ascended the rise of rock, up amongthe trees, among the limbs and leaves. Animals, distant strange creatures,called out through the humid air. Others, more distant, answered with the sameechoing whoops and whistles. The smell of the swamp rose to her on hot waves ofair.Jennsen recalled that Tom had seen her knife when she’d been looking for herpurse that had been stolen. She had pulled back her cloak only to find that theleather thong from her purse of coins had been cut. He had seen the knife then.Jennsen paused in her climb and straightened. Could it be that Tom thought shewas some kind of ... some kind of representative, or agent, of the Lord Rahl?Could it be that Tom thought she was on an important mission on behalf of LordRahl? Could it be that Tom thought she knew Lord Rahl?Was it the knife that made him think she was someone special? Perhaps it hadbeen her pressing determination to go on a seemingly impossible journey. Hecertainly knew how important she thought it was. Perhaps it was that she hadtold him it was a matter of life and death.Jennsen moved on, ducking under heavy limbs drooping down close over the rock.On the other side, she stood and looked around, realizing that darkness wasquickly descending. With a renewed sense of urgency, she scrambled up the steepslope.She recalled how Tom had looked at her red hair. People were often worried abouther because of her red hair. Many thought she had the gift because of it. Shehad often encountered people who feared her because of her red hair. She hadused that fear deliberately to help herself stay safe. That first night, withSebastian, she had made him think she had some kind of magical ability toprotect her if he harbored hostile intent. She had used people’s fear to wardthe men at the inn.All of those things churned together in Jennsen’s mind as she climbed everupward, gasping for breath at the strenuous effort. Darkness was enveloping her.She didn’t know if she could still make it through in such conditions, but sheknew she had to try. For Sebastian, she had to keep going.Just then, something dark swept up, right at her face. Jennsen let out a clippedcry and nearly fell as the dark thing fluttered away. Bats. She put a hand overher racing heart. It was beating as fast as their wings. The little creatureshad come out to snatch the bugs that were so thick in the air.She realized, then, that in her surprise, she might easily have stepped back andfallen. It was frightening to think how a lapse of attention in the dark, afright, a loose rock, or a slip, could put her over an edge from which therecould be no return. She knew, though, that remaining in the swamp at night mightbe just as fatal.Weary from the day’s struggles, the sudden scares, she climbed, stumbling in thedark, feeling the rock, groping her way, trying to stay on the ridge and notwander off what she knew to be steep drops to either side.She worried, too, what creatures might still come out in the darkness to seizeher just as she thought she was nearly free of the swamp.Althea had said that no one could come into the swamp by the back way. A newworry gripped her: maybe after dark, Tom would be in danger. Under cover ofnight, one of the creatures might venture out of the swamp to snatch him. Whatif she reached the meadow only to discover Tom and his horses mauled by themonsters created out of Althea’s magic? What would she do, then?She had worries enough. She told herself not to come up with new ones.Jennsen stumbled suddenly out into the open. There was a fire burning. Shestared, trying to reconcile it.“Jennsen!” Tom jumped up and rushed over. He put his big arm around hershoulders to steady her. “Dear spirits, are you all right?”She nodded, too exhausted to speak. He didn’t see the nod-he was already runningfor the wagon. Jennsen sank down to sit heavily on the grassy ground, catchingher breath, surprised to be there at last, and relieved beyond words to be freeof the swamp.Tom ran back with a blanket. “You’re soaking wet,” he said as he threw theblanket around her. “What happened?”“I went for a swim.”He paused at mopping her face with the corner of the blanket to frown at her. “Idon’t want to tell you your business, but I don’t think that was a good idea.”“The snake would agree with you.”His frown tightened as his face drew closer to hers. “Snake? What happened inthere? What do you mean, the snake would agree with me?”Still struggling to get her breath, Jennsen waved a hand, dismissing it. She hadbeen so afraid of being caught down there in the dark that she had virtuallybeen running up the steep hillside for the last hour, on top of the exertion ofthe rest of it. She was spent.The fear of it all was catching up with her. Her shoulders began to tremble. Sherealized then that she was clutching Tom’s muscular arm for dear life. He seemednot to notice, or if he did, he didn’t comment on it. She drew back, despite howgood it felt to feel his strength, his solid reliable form, his sincere concern.Tom protectively bunched more of the blanket around her. “Did you make itthrough to Althea’s?”She nodded, and when he handed her a waterskin, drank greedily.“I swear, I’ve never heard of anyone ever making it back out of thatswamp-except going in the other side when they were invited. Did you see any ofthe beasts?”“I had a snake, bigger round than your leg, wrapped around me. I got a prettygood look at it-more of a look than I wanted, actually.”He let out a low whistle. “Did the sorceress help you, then? Did you get whatyou needed from her? Is everything all right, then?” He halted abruptly, andseemed to rein in his curiosity. “Sorry. You’re all cold and wet. I shouldn’t beasking you so many questions.”“Althea and I had a long talk. I can’t say that I got what I needed, but justknowing the truth is better than chasing illusions.”Concern showed in his eyes and the way he made sure the warm blanket wascovering her. “If you didn’t get the help you needed, then what will you donow?”Jennsen drew her knife, along with a breath to steel herself. Holding the knifeby the blade, she held it up before Tom’s face, so that the handle was lit bythe firelight. The worked metal that made up the ornate letter “R” glimmered asif it were covered in jewels. She held it out before her like a talisman, likean official proclamation cast in silver, like a demand from on high that couldnot be denied.“I need to get back to the palace.”Without pause, Tom scooped her up in his massive arms, as if she were no moreweight than a lamb, and carried her to the wagon. He lifted her over the sideand gently set her in the back, among the nest of blankets.“Don’t worry-I’ll get you back there. You did the hard part. Now, you just restin those warm blankets and let me get you back there.”Jennsen was relieved to have her suspicions confirmed. In a way, though, it madeher feel slimy, like falling into the swamp again. She was lying to him, usinghim. That wasn’t right, but she didn’t know what else to do.Before he turned away, she seized his arm. “Tom, aren’t you afraid to be helpingme, when I’m involved in something so. . . ““Dangerous?” he finished for her. “What I’m doing is nothing much compared tothe risk you took in there.” He gestured to her matted red hair. “I’m nothingspecial, like you, but I’m glad you allowed me to do the small part I could do.”“I’m not nearly as special as you think I am.” She suddenly felt very small.“I’m just doing as I must.”Tom pulled blankets from the back up toward her. “I see a lot of people. I don’tneed the gift to tell you’re special.”“You know that this is secret business, and I can’t tell you what it is I’mdoing. I’m sorry, but I can’t.”“Of course you can’t. Only special people carry such a special weapon. I’d notexpect you to say a word and I’d not ask.”“Thank you, Tom.” Feeling even more detestable to be using him as she was, andwhen he was such a sincere man, Jennsen squeezed his arm in gratitude. “I cantell you it’s important, and you’re a huge help in it all.”He smiled. “You wrap yourself in those blankets and get yourself dry. We’ll soonbe back out on the Azrith Plains. In case you forgot, it’s winter out there. Wetas you are, you’ll freeze.”“Thank you, Tom. You’re a good man.” Jennsen slumped back into the blankets, tooexhausted from the ordeal to sit up any longer.“I’m counting on you to tell Lord Rahl,” he said with his easy laugh. Tomquickly doused the fire and then climbed up into the wagon seat.Without guile, he was helping her, at what he had to believe was at least somerisk. She feared to think what they might do to him were he to be caught helpingDarken Rahl’s daughter. Here he thought he was helping the Lord Rahl, and he wasdoing the opposite without even knowing the chance he was taking.Before it was over, she would put him at greater risk yet.Despite her fear that they were racing back to the palace of the man who wantedto kill her, the stomach-churning anxiety of what lay ahead, the disappointmentof failing to get the help she had hoped for, the heartbreak of learning all shehad from Althea, the cold that was making her wet clothes feel like ice, and thebouncing wagon, Jennsen was soon fast asleep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25Swaying atop the seat of the wagon, Jennsen watched the immense plateaugradually drawing closer. The morning sun lit the soaring stone walls of thePeople’s Palace, warming them in a pastel glow. Although the wind had died down,the morning air remained bone-chilling cold. After the reeking rot of the swamp,she welcomed the flat, dry, stony scent of the open plain.With her fingertips, Jennsen rubbed her forehead, trying to soothe her dullthrobbing headache. Tom had driven all night and she had slept in the back ofthe bouncing wagon, but not well nor nearly long enough. At least she had sleptsome, and they had made it back.“Too bad Lord Rahl isn’t there.”Shocked out of her private thoughts, Jennsen opened her eyes. “What?”“Lord Rahl.” Tom gestured off to the right, to the south. “It’s too bad he isn’there to help you.”He had pointed south, the direction of the Old World. On occasion, Jennsen’smother had spoken of the bond connecting the D’Haran people with the Lord Rahl.Through its ancient and arcane magic, D’Harans were somehow able to sense wherethe Lord Rahl was. While the strength of the bond varied among D’Haran people,they all shared it to some degree.What the Lord Rahl accrued from the bond, Jennsen didn’t know. She thought of itas yet more chains of domination around his people. In her mother’s case,though, it helped them avoid Darken Rahl’s clutches.From her mother’s descriptions, Jennsen was aware of the bond, but for somereason never felt anything of it. Perhaps it was so weak in her, as it was withsome D’Haran people, that she simply couldn’t feel it. Her mother said it hadnothing to do with one’s level of devotion to the Lord Rahl, that it was purelya link of magic, and, as such, it would be governed by criteria other than herfeelings about the man.Jennsen remembered times when her mother would stand in the doorway of theirhome, or at a window, or pause out in the forest, and stare off toward thehorizon. Jennsen knew at those times that her mother was sensing Darken Rahlthrough the bond, where he was, and how close. It was a shame that it told heronly where the Lord Rahl himself was, and not the brutes he sent after them.Tom, being D’Haran, took that bond to the Lord Rahl for granted, and had justgiven Jennsen a valuable bit of information: Lord Rahl was not at his palace.That news buoyed her hopes. It was one less obstacle, one less thing to worryabout.Lord Rahl was off to the south, probably in the Old World making war on thepeople there, as Sebastian had told her.“Yes,” she finally said, “too bad.”The marketplace below the plateau was already busy. Wisps of dust drifted abovethe crowds gathered there and over the road south. She wondered if Irma thesausage lady was there. Jennsen missed Betty. She wanted so much to see thegoat’s little tail wagging furiously, to hear her bleating with elation at beingreunited with her lifelong friend.Tom pointed his team toward the market, to where he had been set up selling hisload of wine. Maybe Irma would go to the same place. Jennsen would have to leaveBetty again in order to go up through the entrance and into the plateau. Itwould be a long climb up all those stairs, and then she had to find whereSebastian was being held.As the wagon rumbled across the hardpan of the Azrith Plains, Jennsen stared atthe empty road that wound its way up the side of the plateau.“Take the road,” she said.“What?”“Take the road up to the palace.”“Are you sure, Jennsen? I don’t think that’s wise. It’s only for officialbusiness.”Take the road.”In answer, he urged the horses to the left, away from their course toward themarket, and toward the base of the road, instead. From the corner of her eye shesaw him snatch glances at his inscrutable passenger.Soldiers stationed at the base of the plateau, where the road began its ascent,watched them approach. As the wagon rolled closer, Jennsen drew out her knife.“Don’t stop,” she said to Tom.He stared over at her. “What? I have to. They have bows, you know.”Jennsen continued to stare ahead. “Just keep going.”When they reached the soldiers, Jennsen held the knife out, holding it by theblade so that the handle stuck up above her fist. She kept her arm out straightand stiff, pointed down at the cluster of men, so that they might see what shewas announcing. She didn’t look at them, but watched the road ahead, showingthem the knife as if she couldn’t be bothered to talk to them.Every pair of eyes watched that knife handle with the ornate letter “R” upon itas it flashed past their eyes. None moved to stop the wagon, or to nock anarrow. Tom let out a low whistle. The wagon shook and rattled as it rolledonward.The road switched back and forth as it made its way steadily up the plateau. Insome places there was ample room, but occasionally the road narrowed, forcingthe wagon to ride close to the dizzying drop. Each tight bend offered them a newvista, a new view of the expanse of the Azrith Plains spread out far below. Offin the distance the plains were rimmed by dusky blue mountains.When they arrived at the bridge, they finally did have to stop; the bridge waspulled up. Her faith in herself, and her plan, faltered as she realized thatthis, and not her bold bluff, was probably the reason the soldiers below had lether pass so easily. They knew she couldn’t get over the chasm unless the guardslowered the bridge. They knew she couldn’t simply barge into the palace, and atthe same time they didn’t have to challenge a woman who had what very well mightbe an official pass, of sorts, from the Lord Rahl himself. Worse yet, she nowsaw how the soldiers had also isolated, in a place without escape or hope ofrescue by reinforcements, people they deemed potential intruders. Any hostileforay would be stopped cold, here, and in all likelihood, captured or killed onthe spot.It was no wonder Tom had advised against using the road up.Stimulated by the effort of the climb, the big horses tossed their heads at theinterruption. One man stepped in front and took control of the horses’ bits tokeep them still. Soldiers approached the side of the wagon. Jennsen sat on thecliff side, and although she saw men guarding the rear quarter on her side, mostof the men approached on Tom’s side.“Good day, Sergeant,” Tom called out.The man scrutinized the inside of the wagon and, after finding it empty, lookedup at the two in the seat. “Good day.”Jennsen knew that this was no time for her to become timid. If she failed here,everything would be lost. Not only would Sebastian have no hope, but she wouldlikely join him in a dungeon. She could not afford to lose her nerve. When thesoldiers were close enough, she reached past Tom to hold the knife down towardthe sergeant of the guards, showing him the handle as if she were flashing aroyal pass.“Drop the bridge,” she said before he had a chance to ask them anything.The sergeant took in the knife handle before meeting her glare. “What’s yourbusiness?”Sebastian had told her how to bluff. He had explained how she had done it herwhole life, that she was a natural at it. Now she had to do it with deliberateintent if she was to save him, and get out alive, herself. Despite how fast herheart pounded, she showed the man a stem but empty expression.“Lord Rahl’s business. Lower the bridge.”She thought that he was taken back a bit by her tone, or possibly he was worriedby her unexpected words. She could see his level of caution rise, tensing hisfeatures. Nevertheless, he stood his ground.“I need a little more than that, ma’am.”Jennsen twirled the knife, weaving it over and under and between her fingers,the polished metal flashing in the sunlight as it spun, until it came to anabrupt halt with the handle upright in her fist once more, the ornate letter “R”showing to the soldier. In a deliberate manner, she pushed the hood of her cloakback, exposing her fall of red hair to the morning sunlight and the men’sstares. She could see in their eyes that her implication had been clearlyunderstood.“I know you have a job to do,” Jennsen said with terrible calm, “but so do I.I’m on official business for Lord Rahl. I’m sure you can appreciate howdispleased Lord Rahl would be with me were I to discuss his business witheveryone who asked about it, therefore, I have no intention of doing so, but Ican tell you that I wouldn’t be here were it not a matter of life or death. Youare wasting my precious time, Sergeant. Now, lower the bridge.”“And what might be your name, ma’am?”Jennsen leaned farther past Tom in order to more directly scowl at the Sergeant.“Unless you lower that bridge, Sergeant, and right now, you will forever afterremember me as Trouble, sent by Lord Rahl himself.”The sergeant, backed by a few dozen men with pikes, along with crossbows,swords, and axes, didn’t flinch. He looked at Tom.“What’s your part in this?”Tom shrugged. “Just driving the wagon. Were I you, Sergeant, this is one ladyI’d not want to be delaying.”“Is that so?”“It is,” Tom said with conviction.The sergeant gazed long and hard into Tom’s eyes. Finally, he considered Jennsenagain, then turned and rolled his hand, motioning a man to lower the bridge.Jennsen gestured with her knife toward the palace up the road. “How may I findthe place where we hold prisoners?”As the gears started clattering and the bridge began to descend, he turned backto Jennsen.“Inquire with the guards at the top. They can direct you, ma’am.”“Thank you,” Jennsen said with finality, sitting back up straight and puttingher eyes ahead, waiting for the bridge to lower. Once it had thudded into place,the sergeant signaled them ahead. Tom nodded his thanks and flicked the reins.Jennsen had to play the part through the whole way, if this were to have achance of working. She found that her performance was aided by her very realanger. She was disturbed, though, that Tom had played some part in the successof the bluff. She wouldn’t have his help for all of it. She decided that itwould be wise to keep her anger out and in plain view of the other guards.“You want to see the prisoners?” Tom asked.She realized that she never had said why she had to return to the palace. “Yes.They’ve taken a man prisoner by mistake. I’ve come to see that he’s released.”Tom checked the horses with the reins, keeping them wide to negotiate the wagonaround a switchback. “Ask for Captain Lerner,” he said at last.Jennsen glanced over at him, surprised that he had offered a name rather than anobjection. “A friend of yours?”The reins moved ever so slightly, with practiced precision, guiding the horsesaround the bend. “I don’t know if I’d call him a friend. I’ve dealt with him atime or two.”“Wine?”Tom smiled. “No. Other things.”He apparently didn’t intend to say what other things. Jennsen watched the sweepof the Azrith Plains and distant mountains as they rode up the side of theplateau. Somewhere beyond those plains, those mountains, lay freedom.At the top, the road leveled out before a great gate through the massive outerwall of the palace. The guards stationed before the gate there waved themthrough, then blew whistles in a short series of notes to others, unseen, beyondthe walls. Jennsen realized that they had not arrived unannounced.She nearly gasped as they cleared the short tunnel through the massive outerwall. Inside, expansive grounds spread out before them. Lawns and hedgesbordered the road that curved toward a hill of steps well over a half mile away.The grounds inside the walls were teeming with soldiers in smart uniforms ofleather and chain mail covered with wool tunics. Many, with pikes held uprightat precisely the same angle, lined the route. These men were not loafing about.They weren’t the kind to be surprised by what came up the road.Tom took it all in casually. Jennsen tried to keep her eyes pointed ahead. Shetried to look indifferent amid such splendor.Before the hill of steps awaited a reception party of guards over a hundredstrong. Tom pulled the wagon into the pocket they’d formed blocking the road.Jennsen saw, standing on the steps overlooking the soldiers, three men in robes.Two wore silver-colored robes. Between them, one step higher, stood an older manwearing white, both hands held in the opposite sleeves trimmed in golden-coloredbraiding that shimmered in the sunlight.Tom set the brake on the wagon as a soldier took control of the horses to keepthem from moving. Before Tom could begin climbing down, Jennsen put a hand onhis arm to stop him.“This is as far as you go.”“But you-”“You’ve done enough. You helped with the part I needed. I can handle it fromhere on out on my own.”His measured, blue-eyed gaze swept over the guards standing around the wagon. Heseemed reluctant to accede. “I don’t think it could hurt if I went along.”“I’d rather you go back to your brothers.”He glanced to her hand on his arm before looking up into her eyes. “If that’syour wish.” His voice lowered to little more than a whisper. “Will I see youagain?”It sounded more like a request than a question. Jennsen could not bring herselfto deny such a simple thing, not after all he had done for her.“We’ll need to go down to the market to buy some horses. I’ll stop by yourplace, first, right after I’m done inside with getting my friend released, ““Promise?”Under her breath, she said, “I have to pay you for your services, remember?”His lopsided grin reappeared. “I’ve never met anyone like you, Jennsen. I . . .”He noticed the soldiers, remembering then where he was, and cleared his throat.“I’m thankful you let me do my small part, ma’am. I will hold you to your wordon the rest of it.”He had risked enough by bringing her this far-a risk he hadn’t known he wastaking, Jennsen fervently hoped that in her brief smile he would see howgenuinely grateful she was for his help, since she didn’t think she could affordto keep her promise to see him before they left.With his powerful hand gripping her arm to halt her for a final word, he spokein a low but solemn voice. “Steel against steel, that he may be the magicagainst magic.”Jennsen had absolutely no idea what he meant. Staring into his intense gaze, sheanswered with a single, firm nod.Not wanting to let the soldiers suspect that she might really be mildmannered,Jennsen turned away and climbed down from the wagon to stand before the man wholooked to be in charge. She allowed him only a perfunctory look at the knifebefore replacing it in the sheath at her belt.“I need to see the man in charge of any prisoners you’re holding. CaptainLerner, if memory serves me.”His brow drew together. “You want to see the captain of the prison guards?”Jennsen didn’t know his rank. She didn’t know much of anything about militarymatters, except that for most of her life soldiers like these had been trying tokill her. He could be a general, or, for all she knew, a corporal. As sheconsidered the man, his dress, his age, his bearing, she reasoned that hedefinitely looked more than a corporal. She feared to make a mistake with hisrank, though, and decided it would be healthier to ignore it.Jennsen dismissed his question with a curt flick of her hand. “I haven’t got allday. I’ll need an escort, of course. You and some of your men will do, Isuppose.”As she started up the steps, she glanced over her shoulder and saw Tom wink ather. It lifted her heart. The soldiers had parted to let his wagon leave, so heflicked the reins and urged his big horses away. Jennsen hated to see hiscomforting presence go. She turned her mind from her fears.“You,” she said, gesturing to the man in the white robes, “take me to where youhold prisoners.”The man, the top of his head showing through his thinning gray hair, lifted afinger, sending most of the milling guards back to their posts. The officer ofmysterious rank and a dozen of his soldiers remained behind her.“May I see the knife?” the man in the white robes asked in a gentle voice.Jennsen suspected that this man, able to dismiss guards of rank, must be someoneimportant. Important people in Lord Rahl’s palace might have the gift. Itoccurred to her that if he did have the gift, he would see her as a hole in theworld. It also occurred to her that this was a very poor time to blurt out aconfession, and an even worse time to try to bolt for the gate. She had to hopethat he was a palace official and that he wasn’t gifted.Many of the soldiers were still watching. Jennsen casually pulled her knife fromthe sheath at her belt. Without a word, but showing a face that clearly said shewas running out of patience, she held the knife up before the man’s eyes so hecould see the ornate “R” on the handle.He looked down his nose at the weapon before returning his attention to her.“And this is real?”“No,” Jennsen snapped, “I smelted it while sitting around the campfire lastnight. Are you going to take me to where you hold prisoners, or not?”Showing no reaction, the man graciously held out a hand. “If you would follow methis way, madam.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26The palace official’s white robes flowed out behind him as he ascended the hillof steps, flanked by the two men in silver robes. Jennsen remained what shejudged to be an imperious distance behind the men. When the man in white noticedhow she had lagged behind, he slowed to allow her to catch up. She slowed herpace accordingly, maintaining the distance. He nervously checked behind, thenslowed more. She slowed yet more, until the three robed men, Jennsen, and thesoldiers behind her were all pausing ponderously on each step.When they reached the next landing on the broad, sunlit marble steps, the manglanced over his shoulder again. Jennsen gestured impatiently. He finallyunderstood that she had no intention of walking with him, but expected him tolead the procession. The man acceded, quickening his steps, allowing her to havethe distance she demanded, resigned to being what amounted to her lowly crier.The officer of unknown rank and his dozen soldiers climbed the stairs withmincing steps, trying to duplicate the distance she maintained in front of her.It was unanticipated and awkward for her escorts. She wanted it to be; like herred hair, the distraction gave them something to think about, something to worryabout.At intervals, the smooth ascent of marble stairs was broken by broad landingsthat gave the legs a rest before continuing up. At the top of the stairs, tallembossed brass doors were set back beyond colossal columns. The entire front ofthe palace looming over them was one of the grandest sights Jennsen had everseen, but her mind was not on the intricate architecture of the entrance. Shewas thinking about what lay inside.They passed the shadows of the towering columns and swept on through thedoorway; the dozen soldiers still trailed in her wake, their weapons, belts, andmail jangling. The sound of their boots on the polished marble floor echoed offthe walls of a grand entry lined with fluted pillars.Deeper into the palace, people going about their business, or standing in twosand threes talking, or strolling the balconies, paused to watch the unusualprocession, paused to see the officials in their white and silver robes and adozen guards at a respectful distance escorting a woman with red hair. By heroutfit, especially in comparison to the neat clean dress of the others, it wasobvious that she had just traveled in. Rather than being embarrassed by herclothes, Jennsen was pleased that they added to the sense of urgent mystery. Thereaction of the people, too, was bound to infect her escort.After the man in white whispered to the two in silver robes, they nodded and ranon ahead, vanishing around a corner. The guards followed at her measureddistance.The procession wound through a maze of small passageways and funneled downnarrow service stairs. Jennsen and her escorts made a number of turns throughintersecting halls, along dim corridors to doors opening onto wide halls, andintermittently descended a variety of stairs, until she could no longer keeptrack of their route. By the dusty condition of some of the dingy stairs andmusty-smelling, apparently little-used halls, she realized that the man in whiterobes was taking her on a shortcut through the palace in order to get her towhere she wanted to go as swiftly as possible.This, too, was reassuring, because it meant they took her seriously. That helpedher confidence in playing the part. She told herself that she was important, shewas a personal representative of Lord Rahl himself, and she was not going to bedeterred by anyone. They were here for no other purpose but to assist her. Itwas their job. Their duty.Since it was hopeless trying to keep track of all the turns and twists theytook, she put her mind instead to the matter at hand, to what she would do andsay, going over it all in her head.Jennsen reminded herself that no matter what condition Sebastian was in, she hadto keep to her plan. Acting surprised, bursting into tears, falling on him,wailing, would do neither of them any good. She hoped that when she saw him shecould remember all that.The man in white checked his charge before turning down a stone stairwell. Dullred rust showed through chipped paint on the iron railing. The uncomfortablysteep flight of stairs twisted downward, finally ending in a lower passagewaylit by the eerie wavering light from torches in short floor stands, rather thanby lamps and reflectors that were used to light the way above.The two men in silver robes who had gone on ahead were waiting for them at thebottom. Hazy smoke hung near the low beams of the ceiling, leaving the placereeking of burning pitch. She could see her breath in the cold air. Jennsenfelt, viscerally, how deep they were in the People’s Palace. She had a brief,unpleasant memory of what it felt like sinking down beneath the dark, bottomlesswater of the swamp. She felt a similar pressure on her chest in the depths ofthe palace as she imagined the inconceivable weight overhead.Down the murky stone corridor to the right she thought she could see evenlyspaced doors. In some of the doors, it looked like there might be fingersgripping the edge of small openings. From down that hall, in the darkness, camea dry, echoing cough. As she looked off toward the unseen source of the sound,she had the feeling that this was a place where men were sent not forpunishment, but to die.Before an ironbound door sealing off the corridor to the left stood apower-fully built man, feet spread, hands clasped behind his back, chin heldhigh. His bearing, his size, the way his cut-stone gaze locked on her, madeJennsen’s breath falter.She wanted to run. Why did she think she could do this? After all, who was she?Just a nobody.Althea said that wasn’t true unless she made it so herself. Jennsen wished shehad as much faith in her own abilities as Althea seemed to have in her.Looking Jennsen in the eye, the man in white robes held a hand out inintroduction. “Captain Lerner. As you requested.” He turned to the captain andheld his other hand out toward Jennsen. “A personal envoy of Lord Rahl. So shesays.”The captain gave the man in white a grim smile.“Thank you,” she said to the men who had escorted her. “That will be all. “The man in white opened his mouth to speak, then, as he met the look in hereyes, thought better of it and bowed. With his arms held out like a hen herdingchicks, he ushered the other two in silver and then the soldiers away with him.“I’m looking for a man I heard was taken prisoner,” she told the big manstanding before the door.“For what reason?”“Someone messed up. He was taken prisoner by mistake.”“Who says it was a mistake?”Jennsen lifted the knife from its sheath at her belt and held it by the blade,nonchalantly showing the man the handle. “I do.”His iron eyes briefly took in the design on the handle. Still, he stood in thesame relaxed stance, barring the iron door to the passageway beyond. Jennsentwirled the knife through her fingers, caught it by the handle, and returned itsmoothly to its sheath at her belt.“I used to carry one, too,” he said with a nod toward the knife she had returnedto its sheath. “Few years back.”“But not any longer?” She applied gentle pressure to the crossguard until shefelt the knife click home. The soft sound echoed back from the darkness behindher.He shrugged. “It gets wearing, having your life at risk for Lord Rahl all thetime.”Jennsen feared he might ask her something about the Lord Rahl, something shecouldn’t answer, but should be able to. She sought to block that possibility.“You served under Darken Rahl, then. That was before my time. It must have beena great honor to have known him.”“Obviously, you didn’t know the man.”She feared she had just failed her first test. She had thought that everyone whoserved would be a loyal follower. She thought it would be safe to go with thatassumption. It wasn’t.Captain Lerner turned his head and spat. He looked back at her with challenge.“Darken Rahl was a twisted bastard. I’d have liked to put his knife between hisribs and twisted it good.”Despite her anxiety, she showed him no more than a cool expression. “Then whydidn’t you?”“When the whole world is crazy, it doesn’t pay to be sane. I finally told them Iwas getting too old and took a job down here. Someone far better than I ever wasfinally sent Darken Rahl to the Keeper.”Jennsen was thrown off by such an unexpected sentiment. She didn’t know if theman had really hated Darken Rahl, or if he was only saying he did in front ofher so as to show loyalty to the new Lord Rahl, Richard, who had killed hisfather and assumed power. She tried to gather her wits without being obvious.“Well, Tom said you weren’t stupid. I guess he knew what he was talking about.”The captain laughed, a spontaneous, deep, rolling sound that unexpectedly madeJennsen smile at the incongruity of it coming from a man who otherwise lookedlike death’s darling.“Tom would know.” He clapped a fist to his heart in salute. His face softened toan easy smile. Tom had helped her again.Jennsen clapped a fist to her heart, returning the salute. It seemed the rightthing to do. “I’m Jennsen.”“Pleased, Jennsen.” He let out a sigh. “Maybe if I’d have known the new LordRahl, like you do, I might still be serving with you. But I’d already given itup by then and come down here. The new Lord Rahl has changed everything, all therules-he’s turned the whole world upside down, I guess.”Jennsen feared she was treading on dangerous ground. She didn’t know what theman meant and feared to say anything in response. She simply nodded and forgedahead with her reason for being there.“I can see why Tom said that you’d be the one to see.”“What’s this about, Jennsen?”She took a deep, casual breath, preparing herself. She had thought it out ahundred different ways, forward and backward. She was ready to come at it fromany angle.“You know that those of us who serve Lord Rahl in this capacity can’t alwaysallow everyone to know what we’re doing, or who we are.”Captain Lerner was nodding. “Of course.”Jennsen folded her arms, trying to look relaxed, despite how her heart pounded.She had made it past the riskiest assumption; she had guessed correctly.“Well, I had a man working with me,” Jennsen went on. “I heard he was takenprisoner. It wouldn’t surprise me. The fellow sticks out in a crowd-but for whatwe were doing, that was what we needed. Unfortunately, the guards must havenoticed him, too. Because of the mission and the people we were dealing with, hewas well armed, so that would have put the men who stopped him on edge.“He hasn’t been here before, so he wouldn’t know who to trust, and besides, it’straitors we’re hunting.”The captain was frowning in thought as he rubbed his jaw. “Traitors? In thepalace?”“We don’t know for certain. We suspect infiltrators are about-that’s who we’rehunting-so he wouldn’t dare to trust anyone here. If the wrong ears heard who hereally was, it would imperil the rest of us. I doubt he would even give you hisreal name, though he might have Sebastian. With the danger we’re in, he wouldknow that the less he says, then the less risk there is to the others on ourteam.”He stared off, seeming to be caught up in her story.“No ... no prisoner has admitted to that name.” His brow bunched in earnestreflection. “What’s he look like?”“A few years older than me. Blue eyes. Short white hair.”The captain instantly recognized the description. “That one.”“My information was correct, then? You have him.”She wanted to grab the man by his leather and shake him. She wanted to ask ifthey’d hurt Sebastian. She wanted to scream at him to let Sebastian out.“Yes, we have him. If it’s the same man you’re talking about, that is. Matchesyour description, anyway.”“Good. I need him back. I have urgent business for him. I can’t afford to delay.We need to leave at once before the trail gets any colder. It would be best ifwe not make a big show of him being released. We need to slip out with as littlenotice as possible, as little contact with soldiers as possible. The ring ofinfiltrators might have managed to place themselves in the army.”Captain Lerner folded his arms and sighed as he leaned down toward her a little,looking at her as a big brother might look at a little sister. “Jennsen, are yousure he’s one of your men?”Jennsen feared to overplay the bluff. “He was chosen for this assignmentspecifically because soldiers would not suspect he was one of us. Looking athim, you’d never guess. Sebastian has a proven knack for being able to get closeto the infiltrators without them getting wind that he’s one of our men.”“But are you sure of this man’s heart? Are you really sure he’d not bring LordRahl into harm’s view?”“Sebastian is one of mine-that much I know-but I’m not sure the man you have ismy Sebastian. I guess I’d have to see him to be sure. Why?”The captain stared off as he shook his head. “I don’t know. I spent a lot ofyears carrying the knife, like you’re starting out doing, and going places whereyou can’t carry the knife, so you won’t be known for who you really are. I don’thave to tell you how being in such danger all the time sometimes gives you asense about people. Something about that fellow with the white hair makes minestand on end.”Jennsen didn’t know what to say. The captain was twice the size of Sebastian, soit wasn’t Sebastian’s physical presence that would worry the man. Of course,size was no valid indicator of potential threat. Jennsen very well might be ableto beat the captain in a knife fight. Maybe Captain Lerner sensed how deadlySebastian was with weapons. The captain’s eyes had been heedful of the way herfingers handled the knife.Perhaps the captain was able to tell by various small things that Sebastian wasnot D’Haran. That could be troublesome, but Jennsen had thought out a plan toexplain that, too, just in case.“Tom still up to his trouble?” the man asked.“Oh, you know Tom. He’s selling wine, along with the help of Joe and Clayton. “The captain stared incredulously. “Tom-and his brothers? Selling wine?” He shookhis head as a grin spread wide. “I’d like to know what he’s really up to.”Jennsen shrugged. “Well, that’s just what he’s selling at the moment, of course.The three of them travel around, buying goods, bringing them back to sell.”He laughed at that, and slapped her shoulder. “That sounds like he’d want ittold. Small wonder he trusts you.”Jennsen was completely confused and desperately didn’t want to be dragged anyfurther into a dangerous discussion about Tom, or she could soon be found out.She didn’t really know much about Tom; this man apparently did.“I guess I’d better see this fellow you have. If it is Sebastian, I need to kickhis tail and get him on his way.”“Right,” Captain Lerner said with a firm nod. “If he is your man, at least I’llfinally know his name.” He turned to the ironbound door as he rooted around inhis pocket for a key. “If it is him, he’s lucky you came for him before one ofthem women in red showed up to ask him questions. He’d be spouting more than hisname, then. He’d have saved himself and you a lot of trouble if he’d have toldus what he was about in the first place. “Jennsen felt giddy relief to hear that a Mord-Sith hadn’t tortured Sebastian.“When you’re doing Lord Rahl’s business, you keep your mouth shut,” she said.“Sebastian knows the price of our work.”The captain grunted his agreement as he turned the key. The latch unlocked witha cavernous clang. “For this Lord Rahl, I’d keep my mouth shut--even if it was aMord-Sith asking the questions. But you’d have to know the new Lord Rahl betterthan I, so I guess I don’t need to tell you.”Jennsen didn’t understand, but didn’t ask anything, either. As the captaintugged on the door, it slowly swung open, revealing a long hallway lit by a fewcandles along the length of the corridor. To each side were doors with small,barred openings. As they passed some of those openings, as many as half a dozenarms stretched out, imploring, reaching, grabbing. From the darkness throughothers came the clamor of voices calling out vile curses and oaths. From thereaching hands and the collection of voices, she knew that each room beyond heldgroups of men.Jennsen followed behind the captain, deeper into the fortress prison. When eyespeered out and saw it was a woman, the men called out obscenely to her. She wasshocked by the lewd and vulgar things yelled at her, the jeering laughter. Shehid her feelings, her fears, and wore a calm mask.Captain Lerner kept to the center of the passageway, occasionally batting asidea reaching hand. “Watch yourself,” he cautioned.Jennsen was about to ask why when someone threw something sloppy at her. Itmissed, splattering on the opposite wall. She was appalled to see that it wasfeces. Several more men joined in. Jennsen had to duck and dodge to miss it. Thecaptain suddenly kicked a door of a man about to throw more. The bang of thekick echoed up and down the corridor, serving as warning enough to cause men toretreat back into the depths of their cells. Only when the glaring captain wassure his threat was understood did he start out once again.Jennsen couldn’t help but to ask in a whisper, “What are all of these menaccused of?”The captain glanced back over his shoulder. “Various things. Murder, rape-thingslike that. A few are spies-the kind of men you’re hunting.”The stench of the place gagged her. The raw hatred of the prisoners wasunderstandable, she supposed, but no matter how much she sympathized withcaptives of Lord Rahl’s soldiers, men fighting against his brutal rule, theirbehavior only served to support any accusations of perversity. Jennsen stayedclose to Captain Learner’s heels as he turned down a side passageway.From a shelf built into the stone, he collected a lamp, then lit it from anearby candle. The light from the lamp only served to throw a little more lightinto a nightmare and make it all the more frightening. She had terrifyingvisions of being found out and ending up in this place. She couldn’t keep fromimagining being locked in a room with men like these. She knew what they woulddo to her. Jennsen had to remind herself to slow her breathing.Another door had to be unlocked, taking them beyond to a low passageway withdoors spaced much closer. She guessed that they were cells holding a single man.A grasping hand, grimy and covered with open sores, shot out of an opening tocatch her cloak. She shrugged the hand off her and kept moving.Captain Lerner unlocked another door at the end and they entered a space smalleryet, hardly wider than his shoulders. The twisting, cramped opening, like afissure in the rock, made Jennsen’s skin crawl. No hands reached out of the dooropenings in this place. The captain stopped and held up the lamp to look throughthe small hole in the door to the right. Satisfied with what he saw, he handedher the lamp and then unlocked the door.“We put special prisoners in this section,” he explained.He had to use both hands and all his weight to pull on the door. It moved withgrating protest. Inside, Jennsen was surprised to see it was only a tiny, emptyroom with a second door. That was why there were no hands reaching in this hall.The cells had double doors, to make escape even more improbable. After unlockingthe second door, he took back the lamp.The captain ducked through the short doorway, pushing the light in before him,his bulk in the door momentarily throwing her into the darkness. Once through,he extended a hand out to help her so she wouldn’t trip over the high sill.Jennsen held the man’s big hand and stepped into the cell. It was larger thanshe expected. looking to be carved out of the solid stone of the plateau. Tooledgouges in the rock walls testified to how difficult the work had been. Noprisoner was going to die, his way out of such a secure place.On a bench carved in the opposite wall sat Sebastian. His blue eyes were on herfrom the instant she entered. In those eyes she thought she could see how muchhe wanted out. Nevertheless, he showed no emotion and said nothing. From outwardappearances, no one would even know that he knew her.He had neatly folded his cloak and used it as a cushion on the cold stone.Nearby sat a water cup. His clothes were orderly, showing no evidence that theyabused him.It was so good to see his face, his eyes, his spikes of white hair again. Helicked his lips, his beautiful lips that so often had smiled at her. Now,though, he dared not smile. Jennsen had been right. She did want to fall on him,to throw her arms around him, to wail with her relief at seeing him alive andunhurt.The captain gestured with his lamp. “This him?”“Yes, Captain.”Sebastian’s eyes were fixed on her as she stepped forward. She had to pause tobe sure she had her voice under control. “It’s all right, Sebastian. CaptainLerner, here, knows you’re one of my team.” She patted the handle of her knife.“You can trust him to keep your identity confidential.”Captain Lerner extended a hand. “Glad to meet you, Sebastian. Sorry about themix-up. We didn’t know who you were. Jennsen explained your mission. I used toserve, so I understand the need for secrecy.”Sebastian rose to his feet and clasped hands with the man. “No harm done,Captain. I can’t fault our men for doing their job.”Sebastian didn’t know her plan. He appeared to be waiting for her lead. Shegestured impatiently and asked a question she knew he wouldn’t be able to answerand, in that way, let him know what it was she intended him to say.“Did you make contact with any of the infiltrators before you were stopped bythe guards? Did you find out who any of them are and gain their confidence? Didyou at least get any names?”Sebastian took her lead and sighed convincingly. “I’m sorry, no. I’d only justarrived and didn’t have a chance before the guards . . .” His gaze drifted tothe floor. “Sorry.”Captain Learner’s eyes shifted between the two of them.Jennsen assumed a tone of forbearance. “Well, I can’t blame guards for nottaking chances in the palace. We need to be on our way, though. I made someheadway in our search and uncovered some important new contacts. It can’t wait.These men are wary and I need you to approach them. They aren’t likely to let awoman buy them drinks-they’d get the wrong idea-so I’m going to leave it to you.I’ve got other snares to set.”Sebastian was nodding as if he were entirely familiar with the imaginary work.“All right.”The captain held an arm out. “Let’s get you both on your way, then.”Sebastian, following Jennsen out, glanced back. “I’ll need my weapons, Captain.And all the coins that were in the purse. That’s Lord Rahl’s money, and I needit to do his bidding.”“I have it all. Nothing is missing-my word on that.”Outside, in the confining passageway, Captain Lerner pulled the cell door shut.He had the light, so Jennsen and Sebastian waited on him. As she started out,the captain gently reached past Sebastian to grasp her arm, stopping her.Jennsen froze, fearing to breathe. She felt Sebastian’s hand slip around herwaist to the handle of her knife.“Is it true what people say?” the captain asked.Jennsen looked back into his eyes. “What do you mean?”“I mean, about Lord Rahl. About how he’s ... I don’t know, different. I’ve heardmen talk-men who have met him, fought with him. They talk about how he handlesthat sword of his, how he fights and all, but more than that, they talk abouthim as a man. Is it true what they say?”Jennsen didn’t know what he meant. She feared to move, to say anything, notknowing how to answer such a question. She didn’t know what people, especiallyD’Haran soldiers, said about the new Lord Rahl.She knew that she and Sebastian could kill this man, here, now. They would havethe element of surprise. Sebastian, with his hand on her knife, was surelythinking that very thing.But they would still have to make it out of the palace. If they killed him, itwas likely that the body would soon be discovered. The D’Haran soldiers wereanything but lax. Even if they hid the dead captain of the prison guards, acheck of the prisoners would soon reveal that Sebastian was missing. Theirchances of escaping, then, became remote.Worse, though, she didn’t think she could kill this man. Despite the fact thathe was a D’Haran officer, she held no ill feeling for him. He seemed a decentsort, not a monster. Tom liked him, and the captain respected Tom. Stabbing aman who was trying to kill them was one thing. This would be entirely different.She couldn’t do this.“We would lay down our lives for the man,” Sebastian said in an earnest voice.“I’d have let you torture and kill me before I would have said a word, for fearit would endanger Lord Rahl.”“I, too,” Jennsen added in a soft voice, “think of little else but Lord Rahl. Ieven dream about him.”She had spoken the truth, but a truth calculated to deceive. The captain smiled,staring off with an inner satisfaction as his fingers released her arm.Jennsen felt Sebastian’s hand slip away from her knife.“I guess that tells it plain,” the captain said in the near darkness. “I’veserved a long time. I had lost hope of daring to dream such a thing.” Hehesitated, then spoke again. “And his wife? Is she really a Confessor, like theysay? I’ve heard tales about the Confessors, from back before the boundaries, butI never knew if it was really true.”Wife? Jennsen didn’t know anything about Lord Rahl having a wife. Jennsencouldn’t picture him with a wife, or imagine what such a woman would be like.Jennsen couldn’t even conceive of why the Lord Rahl, a man who could possess anywoman he wanted and then discard her at will, would bother to take a wife.And what a “Confessor” could be was a complete mystery to Jennsen, but the verytitle “Confessor” certainly sounded ominous.“Sorry,” Jennsen said. “I’ve not met her.”“Nor I,” Sebastian said. “But I’ve heard much the same about her as you have.”The captain smiled distantly. “I’m glad I’ve lived to see a Lord Rahl like thisfinally come to command D’Hara as it should be commanded.”Jennsen started out again, troubled by the man’s words, troubled that he waspleased this new Lord Rahl was going to conquer and rule the whole world in thename of D’Hara.Jennsen was eager to get out of the prison and out of the palace. The three ofthem moved quickly back through the narrow passageways, back through iron doorsand past the reaching prisoners. The captain’s growled warning silenced them,this time.When they rushed through the last ironbound door before the stairs, they allcame to an abrupt halt. A tall, attractive woman, with a single long blondbraid, stood waiting for them, blocking their escape route. The look on her facewas lightning waiting to strike.She was wearing red leather.It could be nothing other than a Mord-Sith."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27The woman’s hands were clasped casually behind her back. Her expression wasanything but casual. Boot strikes echoed off the stone walls as she steppedforward, a dark thundercloud approaching, a thundercloud that didn’t know fear.A wave of gooseflesh tingled up Jennsen’s body from her knees to the nape of herneck where downy hair stiffened.In a steady, measured pace, the woman strode one full turn around them, lookingthem up and down, a hawk circling, inspecting mice. Jennsen saw an Agiel, theweapon of a Mord-Sith, hanging from a fine chain at the woman’s right wrist.Lethal as Jennsen knew such a weapon could be, it looked like nothing more thana thin leather rod not a foot in length.“A very agitated official came to see me,” the Mord-Sith said in a quiet, silkenvoice. Her deadly glare moved very deliberately from Sebastian to Jennsen. “Hethought I needed to come down here and see what was going on. He mentioned awoman with red hair. He seemed to think she might be trouble of some sort. Whatdo you think he was so worried about?”The captain, who was behind Jennsen, stepped out to the side. “There’s nothinggoing on that you need concern yourself-”With a flick of her wrist, the Agiel spun up into her fist and was pointing atthe captain’s face. “I didn’t ask you. I asked this young woman.”The glare turned back to Jennsen. “Why do you suppose he would say that I neededto come down here? Hmm?”Jennsen.“Because,” Jennsen said, unable to look away from the cold blue eyes,“he’s a pompous dolt and he didn’t like it that I wouldn’t pretend he wasn’t,just because he wore white robes.”The Mord-Sith smiled. It was not humor, but grim respect for the veracity ofwhat Jennsen had said.The smile evaporated as she glanced at Sebastian. When her gaze returned toJennsen, it looked as if it could cut steel. “Pompous or not, that doesn’tchange the fact that there is a prisoner being released for no more cause thanyour word.”Jennsen.“My word is sufficient.” Jennsen irritably lifted the knife at her belt andflashed the handle at the woman. “This backs my word.”“That,” the Mord-Sith said in her silken hiss, “means nothing.”Jennsen could feel her face going red. “It means-”“Do you think we’re stupid?” The Mord-Sith’s skintight red leather creaked asshe leaned closer. “That if you come in here and merely wave that knife handlein our faces, that our faculty of reason will evaporate?”The tight leather outfit revealed a body as shapely as it was powerful.Jennsen felt small and ugly before this flawless creature. Worse, she felttotally inadequate faking a story before a woman as confident as this woman was,a woman who seemed able to see right through their invented tale, but Jennsenknew that if she dared to waver now, she and Sebastian were as good as dead.Jennsen put as much of an edge to her voice as she could manage. “I carry thisknife for Lord Rahl, in his name, and you will yield to it.”“Really. Why?”“Because this knife shows the trust Lord Rahl has placed in me.”“Ah. So just because you happen to carry it, we’re supposed to believe that LordRahl gave it to you? That he trusts you? How are we to know you didn’t find theknife? Hmm?”“Find it? Are you out of your-”“Or perhaps you and this prisoner, here, ambushed the knife’s trueowner-murdered him-for no reason but to get your hands on a coveted object,hoping it would give you credibility.”“I don’t know how you can possibly believe such a-”“Or maybe you’re a coward and murdered the knife’s owner in his sleep? Or maybeyou didn’t even have that much courage, and you bought if from cutthroats whomurdered him. Is that what you did? Simply got it from the real murderer?”“Of course not!”The Mord-Sith leaned closer yet, until Jennsen could feel the woman’s breath onher own face. “Maybe you enticed the man it belong to into lying between yoursweet legs while your partner, here. stole it. Or maybe you’re just a whore andit was the gift of a murderous thief in exchange for your womanly favors?”Jennsen backed away. “I-I wouldn’t-”“Showing us such a weapon proves nothing. The fact is, we don’t know who theknife belongs to.”Surrender.“It’s mine!” Jennsen insisted.The Mord-Sith straightened and lifted an eyebrow. “Really.”The captain folded his arms. Sebastian, standing to Jennsen’s side, didn’t move.Jennsen fought to contain tears of panic trying to surface. She endeavored toshow a defiant face, instead.Jennsen. Surrender.“I have important business on behalf of Lord Rahl,” Jennsen said through grittedteeth. “I don’t have time for this.”“Ah,” the Mord-Sith mocked, “business on behalf of Lord Rahl. Well, that doessound important.” She folded her arms. “What business?”“It’s my affair, not yours.”The cool smile returned. “Magic business? That it? Magic?”“It’s not any of your concern. I’m doing Lord Rahl’s bidding and you would dowell to remember that. He’d not be pleased to know you were meddling.”The eyebrow lifted again. “Meddling? My dear young lady, it is impossible for aMord-Sith to meddle. If you were who you say you are, you would know that much,at least. Mord-Sith exist only to protect Lord Rahl. It would be a derelictionof my duty, don’t you think, were I to ignore such curious goings-on?”“No-I told you-”“And if Lord Rahl finds himself bleeding his life away, and asks me whathappened, before he dies I can tell him that a girl with a pretty knife dancedin here and demanded to have a very suspicious and tight-lipped prisonerreleased, and, well, we were so dazzled by the knife and by her big blue eyesthat we all just thought we ought to let her have her way. That about it?”“Of course you have to-”“Do some magic for me.” The Mord-Sith reached out and tested some of Jennsen’sred hair between a finger and thumb. “Hmm? A bit of magic to prove yourself. Aspell, a charm, a dazzling show of your craft. Call some lightning down, if youwill. If not that, maybe then just a simple flame fluttering in midair?”“I don’t-”“Do some magic, witch.” Her voice was a deadly command.Surrender.Angry at the voice, but more so at the Mord-Sith, Jennsen slapped the hand awayfrom her hair. “Stop it!”Faster than seemed possible, Sebastian went for the woman. Faster yet, her Agielspun into her hand. She rammed the tip against Sebastian’s shoulder as he wasstill flying at her.Sebastian cried out as the weapon stopped him cold. The woman calmly pressed theAgiel against his shoulder, driving him to the ground. Sebastian screamed as helay crumpled on the floor.Jennsen rushed toward the Mord-Sith. In one swift movement, the woman stood andhad the Agiel before Jennsen’s face, halting her. At their feet, Sebastianwrithed in agony.Thinking only of Sebastian, only of getting to him, only of helping him, Jennsengrabbed the Agiel, pushing it and the woman’s hand away. She went to one kneebeside Sebastian. He had rolled to his side, holding himself, trembling, as ifhe’d been struck by lightning.He calmed under her gentle touch as she told him to lie still. As he recoveredsomewhat and tried to sit up, Jennsen put an arm behind his shoulders and helpedhim. He leaned against her, panting, clearly suffering the lingering effect ofthe pain of the weapon. He blinked, trying to clear his watering eyes,struggling to focus his vision. Jennsen, horrified by what the touch of theAgiel could do, stroked a hand down Sebastian’s face. She lifted his chin,trying to see if he recognized her, if he was all right. He could hardly sit upon his own, but he gave her a little nod.“Stand up.” The Mord-Sith towered over them. “Both of you.”Sebastian couldn’t, yet. Jennsen shot to her feet, defiantly facing the woman.“I’ll not tolerate this! When I tell Lord Rahl about this, he’ll have youhorsewhipped!”The woman was frowning. She held the Agiel out. “Touch it.”Again, Jennsen seized the weapon and shoved it aside. “Stop it!”“It works,” the Mord-Sith muttered to herself, “I know it does-I can feel it.”She turned and experimentally pressed the awful thing to the captain’s arm. Hecried out and went to his knees.“Stop it!” Jennsen caught hold of the red rod, pulling it back away from thecaptain.The Mord-Sith stared. “How do you do that?”“Do what?”“Touch it without being hurt? No one is immune to the touch of an Agiel-not evenLord Rahl himself.”Jennsen realized then that something unprecedented had happened. She didn’tunderstand it, but she knew that while the situation was confused, she had toseize the opportunity.“You wanted to see magic-you saw it.”“But how-”“Do you think that Lord Rahl would allow me to carry the knife if I wasn’tcompetent?”“But an Agiel-”The captain was coming to his feet. “What’s the matter with you? I fight for thesame cause as you.”“And that cause is protecting Lord Rahl,” the woman snapped. She held her Agielup. “This is my means of protecting him. I have to know what’s wrong lest I failhim.”Jennsen reached up and curled her fingers around the weapon, holding it tight asshe met the Mord-Sith’s gaze. She told herself that she had to remember who shewas supposed to be and to maintain the pretense. She tried to think of what shewould do if she really were one of Lord Rahl’s elite.“I understand your concern,” Jennsen said with resolve, determined not to missher unexpected chance, even if she didn’t fully understand it herself. “I knowyou want to protect Lord Rahl. We share that devotion and sacred duty. Our livesare his. I have vital business doing the same as you-protecting Lord Rahl. Youdon’t know all that’s involved in this and I don’t have the time to even beginto explain it to you.“I’ve had enough of this. Lord Rahl’s life is in danger. I have no more time tospare. If you don’t let me do my job of protecting him, then you are imperilinghim and I will remove you as I would any threat to his life.”The Mord-Sith considered Jennsen’s words. What she could be thinking, Jennsenhad no idea, but that very notion-thought-was one Jennsen had never ascribed tothe Mord-Sith. She had always considered them to be mindless killers. In thiswoman’s eyes, Jennsen could see cognition.Finally, the Mord-Sith reached down and with a hand under Sebastian’s arm,helped him to his feet. When he was standing steadily, she turned back toJennsen.“I’d gladly suffer the horsewhipping-and far worse-if it would help protect thisLord Rahl. Get going-and be quick about it.” She gave Jennsen a small but warmsmile and then a firm clap on the side of the shoulder. “May the good spirits bewith you.” She hesitated. “But, I need to know how it is that you don’t feel thepower of an Agiel. Such a thing is simply not possible.”Jennsen was taken aback that a person this evil dared to invoke the name of thegood spirits. Jennsen’s mother was a good spirit, now. “I’m sorry, but that’spart of what I have no time to begin to tell you, and besides, Lord Rahl’ssafety hinges on me keeping it secret.”The woman stared long and hard. “I am Nyda,” she said at last. “Swear to me,personally, that you will do as you say, and protect him.”“I swear, Nyda. Now, I have to go. I can’t spare any more time-not foranything.”Before Jennsen could move, the Mord-Sith seized a fistful of her dress and cloakat her shoulder. “This is one Lord Rahl we cannot afford to lose, or we all loseeverything. If I ever find out you’re lying to me, I promise you two things.First, there will never be a hole deep enough for you to hide in that I won’tfind you, and, second, your death will be beyond anyone’s worst nightmare. Do Imake myself clear?”Jennsen could only nod dumbly at the look of fierce resolve in Nyda’s eyes.The woman turned and started up the steps. “Get going, then.”“Are you all right?” the captain asked Sebastian.Sebastian brushed dirt off his knees as he headed for the steps. “I’d haverather had the horsewhipping than that, but I guess I’ll live.”The captain grimaced his sympathy as he comforted his own arm. “I have yourthings up there, locked away. Your weapons and your money.”“Lord Rahl’s money,” Sebastian corrected.Jennsen wanted nothing so much as to be out of the palace. She hurried up thesteps, forcing herself not to break into a dead run.“Oh,” the Mord-Sith called back down the steps. She had paused, her hand on therusty rail as they rushed up after her. “I forgot to tell you.”“Forgot to tell us what?” Jennsen asked. “We’re in a hurry.”“That official who came to get me? The one in white robes?”“Yes?” Jennsen asked as she reached the woman.“After he came for me, he was going to go looking for Wizard Rahl, to bring himdown to see you, too.”Jennsen felt the blood drain from her face.“Lord Rahl is far to the south,” the captain scoffed as he came up the stairsbehind them.“Not Lord Rahl,” Nyda said. “Wizard Rahl. Wizard Nathan Rahl.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28Jennsen remembered that name, Nathan Rahl. Althea had said she met him in theOld World, at the Palace of the Prophets. He was a real Rahl, she said. She saidhe was powerful and inconceivably dangerous, so they kept him locked away behindimpenetrable shields of magic where he could cause no harm, yet he sometimesstill managed it. Althea had said that Nathan Rahl was over nine hundred yearsold.Somehow, the old wizard had escaped those impenetrable shields of magic.Jennsen seized the Mord-Sith by the elbow. “Nyda, what’s he doing here?”“I don’t know. I’ve not met him.”“It’s important he not see us.” Jennsen nudged Nyda ahead, urging her to hurry.“I don’t have time to explain, but he’s dangerous.”At the top of the stairs, Nyda looked both ways before meeting Jennsen’s gaze.“Dangerous? Are you sure about this?”“Yes! ““All right. Come with me, then.”“I need my things,” Sebastian said.“Here.” The captain pointed at a door not far away.While Nyda stood guard, Sebastian followed Captain Lerner inside. Jennsen, herknees trembling, stood in the doorway watching as the captain set the lamp downand unlocked a second door inside. He and Sebastian went into the room beyond,taking the lamp. Jennsen could hear brief words and the sounds of things beingdragged off shelves.With every passing moment, Jennsen could almost hear the wizard’s footstepsbringing him ever closer. If he caught them, Sebastian’s weapons would do themno good. If Wizard Rahl saw them, he would recognize Jennsen for what she was-ahole in the world, the ungifted offspring of Darken Rahl. There would be nobluffing her way out of that. They would have her at last.Sebastian emerged ahead of the captain. “Let’s go.”He simply looked like a man in a dark green cloak, the same as before. Few wouldsuspect the collection of weapons he carried. His blue eyes and spikes of whitehair made him look different from other people; maybe that was why the guardshad stopped him.The captain caught Jennsen by the arm. “As she said” he nodded toward theMord-Sith “may the good spirits be with you always.”He handed her the lamp. Jennsen whispered her sincere gratitude before rushingto follow the other two down the passageway, leaving the captain of the guardsbehind.Nyda led them down dark halls and through empty rooms. They raced through anarrow cleft without a ceiling-at least, when Jennsen looked up she could seenothing but darkness above. The floor appeared to be bedrock. The wall to theright was rather unremarkable fitted stone. To the left, though, the passagewaywas lined with colossal, speckled pink granite blocks. Each smooth-faced blockwas larger than any house Jennsen had ever lived in, yet the joints were sotight that no blade could have slipped between them.At the end of the passageway beside the huge stone blocks, they ducked through alow door and out onto a narrow walkway made of iron and laid with planks tocross on. The thread of a footbridge spanned a wide chasm in the bedrock of theplateau. Jennsen could see by the light of her lamp that the walls of sheer rockto each side dropped straight down, fading away far below. The light of the lampwasn’t enough for her to see the bottom. Standing there on the slender stretchof walkway suspended over the enormous void made her feel as tiny as an ant.The Mord-Sith, a hand on the iron rail as she moved across the bridge, pausedand looked back over her shoulder. “Why is Wizard Rahl dangerous?” It wasobvious that the question had been playing on her mind.“What trouble can he cause you?” The brittle tone of her voice reverberated offthe surrounding rock walls.Stopped there in the center of the walkway over the black abyss, Jennsen couldfeel the bridge swaying underfoot. It was making her dizzy. The Mord-Sithwaited. Jennsen tried to think of something to say. A glance back at Sebastian’sblank expression told her that he had no ideas. She quickly decided to mix insome of the truth, in case Nyda knew anything about the man.“He’s a prophet. He escaped from a place where he was held, a place where hecouldn’t hurt anyone. They had him there because he’s dangerous.”The Mord-Sith pulled her long blond braid over her shoulder, drawing her handdown its length as she considered Jennsen’s words. She clearly didn’t intend tomove, yet. “I’ve heard he’s quite an interesting man.” In her eyes was awakenedchallenge.“He’s dangerous,” Jennsen insisted.“Why?”“He can harm my mission.”“How?”“I’ve already said it-he’s a prophet.”“Prophecy could be a benefit. It might help you in your mission to protect LordRahl.” The Mord-Sith’s frown darkened. “Why wouldn’t you want such help?”Jennsen recalled what Althea said about prophecy. “He might tell me how I’lldie, even the very day. What if you were the one who had to protect Lord Rahlagainst an approaching threat, and you knew that the very next day you weregoing to die in some horrifying fashion? Knew the exact hour, the agonizingdetails. It might put you in a state of paralyzing fear, and in that panic ofknowing exactly when and how you were to die, you would naturally be ill suitedto protect Lord Rahl’s life.”Nyda’s frown eased only slightly. “Do you really think that Wizard Rahl wouldtell you such a thing?”“Why do you think they had him locked away? He’s dangerous. Prophecy could bedangerous for those like me who protect Lord Rahl.”“Or maybe it could help,” Nyda said. “If you knew that something bad was goingto happen, you could stop it.”“Then it wouldn’t be prophecy, now would it?”Nyda ran her hand down her braid as she considered the implications.“But if you knew of some dire foretelling, then maybe you could turn theprophecy aside and avert the disaster.”“If you could turn prophecy aside, that would make it wrong. If it were wrong,if it were prophecy unfulfilled, then it would just be the foolish empty wordsof an old man, wouldn’t it? Then how could prophecy be distinguished from theranting of any lunatic who claimed he was a prophet?”“But it’s not empty ranting,” Jennsen insisted. “It’s prophecy. If this prophetwanted to harm my mission, he might tell me something terrible about my future.If I knew something terrible, I might fail Lord Rahl.”“You mean,” Nyda asked, “that you think it would be like if I were to jab myAgiel at someone? It would make them flinch?”“Yes. Only if we know a prophecy, and flinch, as it were, it’s Lord Rahl whowould be put at risk because of our weakness and fear.”Nyda released her braid and put her hand back on the railing. “But I would notflinch, knowing how I was to die, especially if it was Lord Rahl’s life I wassaving. As a Mord-Sith, I’m always prepared to die. Every Mord-Sith wishes todie fighting for the Lord Rahl, not old and toothless in bed.”Jennsen wondered if the woman was mad, or if she could really be that dedicated.“A brave boast,” Sebastian put in. “But are you willing to bet Lord Rahl’s lifeon it?”Nyda looked him in the eye. “If it were my life on the line? Yes. I would notflinch knowing how and when I was to die.”“Then I admit that you’re a better woman than I,” Jennsen said.Nyda nodded grimly. “I would not expect you to be the same as I. You may carrythe knife, but are not Mord-Sith.”Jennsen wished Nyda would move on. If she couldn’t convince the woman, and hadto fight her, this would be a very bad place to have to do it. The Mord-Sith wasstrong and quick. With Sebastian behind, he could be little help. Besides that,hanging on to the swaying bridge over the chasm, Jennsen’s head was spinning.She didn’t like high places, and had never prided herself in her sense ofbalance.“I’d do my best not to fail Lord Rahl in a situation like that,” Jennsen said,“but I can’t swear I wouldn’t. I’d not like Lord Rahl’s life to hang on theanswer.”Nyda nodded in resignation. “That’s wise.” She finally turned and started outonce more across the footbridge. “I would still try to change the prophecy,though.”Jennsen let out a silent sigh as she shuffled along, following close behind. Insome manner she didn’t understand, her words were swaying the Mord-Sith morethan seemed possible.She glanced over the edge but still saw no bottom. “Prophecy can’t be changed,or it would cease to be prophecy. Prophecy comes from prophets, who are giftedwith it.”Nyda had her braid over her shoulder again, stroking it. “But if he’s a prophet,then he knows the future, and, like you said, that can’t be changed or itwouldn’t be prophecy-so he would only be telling you what is going to happen. Hecan’t change it, you can’t change it. It’s already going to happen whether hetells you or not. If telling you would make you fail to protect Lord Rahl, thenhe would already see such an event, so it is preordained to happen and would bepart of the prophecy to begin with.”Jennsen pulled a strand of her hair out of her eyes as she advanced along thebridge, gripping the rail tightly. In her mind, she furiously raced to come upwith a logical answer. She had no idea if the things she was saying were true ornot, but she thought they sounded convincing and seemed to be working. Theproblem was, Nyda kept asking questions Jennsen had more and more troubleanswering. She felt almost as if she were descending into the void below, eachattempt to climb out only letting her slip deeper. She did her best to keep anytrace of desperation out of her voice.“But don’t you see? Prophets don’t see everything about everyone, as if thewhole world and every single thing that happens is some grand play to be actedout according to a script the prophet has already read. A prophet would only seesome things-maybe even some things of his choosing. But other things, things hedoesn’t see, he might try to influence.”Nyda frowned back at them. “What do you mean?”Jennsen sensed that her only safety was to keep Nyda worried for her Lord Rahl.“I mean, if he wanted to harm Lord Rahl, he might tell me something that wouldmake me flinch, just to make me flinch, even if he didn’t see such an event.”Nyda’s frown grew more serious. “You mean he might lie?”“Yes.”“But why would Wizard Rahl want to harm Lord Rahl? What possible reason would hehave?”“I told you, he’s dangerous. That’s why they had him locked away in the Palaceof the Prophets. Who knows what other things they knew about him that we don’t,things that made them feel it was necessary to lock such a man away.”“That still doesn’t answer why Wizard Rahl would wish to harm Lord Rahl. “Jennsen felt as if she were in a knife fight-trying to protect herself from thiswoman’s razor-sharp verbal blade. “It’s not just prophecy-he’s a wizard. He’sgifted. I don’t know if he’s interested in harming Lord Rahl-maybe he’s not-butI don’t want to risk Lord Rahl’s life to find out. I know enough about magic toknow I don’t like messing around with things of magic that are beyond me. I haveto put Lord Rahl’s life first. I’m not saying that I believe Nathan Rahl is benton harm, I’m just saying that it’s my job to protect Lord Rahl and I don’t wantto take the chance with such magic, magic I can’t ward.”The woman shouldered open the door at the end of the foot bridge. “I can’t arguethat. I don’t like anything to do with magic. But if Lord Rahl is in danger fromthis prophet of a wizard, maybe you had better stay here so we can look intoit.”“I don’t know if Nathan Rahl represents a threat, but I have pressing businessthat I know for certain is a grave danger to Lord Rahl. My responsibility is totend to that.”Nyda tried a door but found it locked. She continued on down the dingy hallway.“But if your suspicions about Nathan Rahl are correct, then we must-”“Nyda, I’m hoping you can keep your eye on this Nathan Rahl for me. I can’t doit all myself. Watch him for me?”“Do you wish me to kill him?”“No.” Jennsen was surprised at how ready the Mord-Sith seemed to be to commit tosuch an act. “Of course not. I’m just saying to pay attention, keep an eye onhim, that’s all.”Nyda reached another door. This time the lever lifted. Before she opened it, sheturned back to the two of them. Jennsen didn’t like the look in her eyes as hergaze shifted between them.“This is all crazy,” Nyda said. “Too much of it makes no sense. Too many thingsdon’t fit. I don’t like it when things don’t make sense.”This was a dangerous creature who could at any moment turn on them.Jennsen had to find a way to close the subject for good. She remembered whatCaptain Lerner had said, how filled with conviction he had been, and spoke thewords softly to Nyda.“The new Lord Rahl has changed everything, all the rules-he’s turned the wholeworld upside down.”Nyda finally let out a deep breath. A wistful smile came to her lips.“Yes, he has,” she said in a soft voice. “Wonder of wonders. That’s why I wouldlay down my life to protect him, why I worry so.”“Me too. I need to do my job.”Nyda turned away and led them to a dark spiral of stairs tunneling down throughthe rock. Jennsen knew that the tale she was spinning wasn’t entirelyconvincing. She was perplexed that it worked anyway.A long journey down seemingly endless stairs and along dark corridors,occasionally cutting through passageways crowded with soldiers, took them everlower in the plateau below the People’s Palace. Sebastian’s hand on her back formuch of the journey was a reassuring comfort, and a relief. Jennsen could hardlybelieve that she had managed to get him free. Soon, they would be out of thepalace and safely away.Somewhere within the interior of the plateau, they emerged into the centralpublic area. Nyda had taken them down a more direct route and saved them time.Jennsen preferred staying within the hidden passageways, but, apparently, thoseshortcuts ended at this place within the common area. They would have to finishtheir descent among the crowds.Small stands selling food lined the way along the route as throngs of peopleshuffled past on their long ascent to the palace above. Jennsen recalled passingthe vendors opposite the stone balusters overlooking the level below on herfirst visit to the palace. The smells, after the dusty places they had been,were temptation almost beyond endurance.Soldiers patrolling nearby noticed them on their way down, moving against thecrowds. Like all the soldiers she had seen in the palace, these were big men,muscular, fit, eyes alert. In their leather and chain mail, weapons hanging fromtheir belts, they were an intimidating sight. As soon as they realized that Nydawas escorting them, the soldiers turned their scrutiny to other people.When Jennsen saw Sebastian pull up his hood, she realized it would be a goodidea to hide her hair and followed suit. The air inside the plateau was frostyand a number of people had their heads covered with hoods or hats, so itwouldn’t raise suspicions.As they reached the far end of a long landing in the lower reaches inside theplateau, just as they turned to descend the next flight of stairs, Jennsenlooked up. At the opposite end of the landing, a tall older man with a full headof straight white hair hanging to his broad shoulders was just coming down offthe stairs. Even though he was old, he was still a strikingly handsome man.Despite his age, he moved with vigor.He looked up. His gaze met Jennsen’s.The world seemed to stop in the man’s dark azure eyes.Jennsen froze. There was something about him that looked vaguely familiar,something in those eyes that seized her attention.Sebastian had stopped two steps below her. Nyda was at her side. The Mord-Sith’sgaze followed Jennsen’s.The man’s hawklike glare was fixed on Jennsen, as if they were the only twopeople in the entire palace.“Dear spirits,” Nyda whispered. “That has to be Nathan Rahl.”“How do you know?” Sebastian asked.She stepped up beside Jennsen, her attention fixed on the man. “He has the eyesof a Rahl, of Darken Rahl. I’ve seen those eyes in enough nightmares. “Nyda’s gaze slid to Jennsen. Her brow drew together.Jennsen realized where she had seen the man’s eyes-in the mirror."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29In the distance, across the landing, Jennsen saw the wizard’s eyes going wide.His hand came up, pointing across the throng of people.“Stop!” He called out in a deep, powerful voice. Even above the racket aroundher, Jennsen could clearly hear that voice ring out. “Stop!”Nyda was staring at her, as if the spark of recognition was but an instant away.Jennsen seized her arm.“Nyda, you have to stop him.”Nyda broke the gaze to look over her shoulder at the man rushing toward them.She looked back at Jennsen.Jennsen remembered Althea saying that she could see some Rahl in Jennsen’slooks, and that others who knew Darken Rahl might recognize her.Jennsen gripped red leather in her fist. “Stop him! Don’t listen to anything hesays!”“But he might only-”Gripping the fistful of red leather tightly, Jennsen shook the woman. “Haven’tyou heard anything I’ve said? He might keep me from helping Lord Rahl. He mighttry to trick you. Stop him. Please, Nyda-Lord Rahl’s life is in grave danger.”Invoking the name of Lord Rahl tipped the balance back.“Go,” Nyda said. “Hurry.”Jennsen nodded and dashed down the steps. She only had time for a brief look.She saw the prophet’s long legs striding toward them, his hand held out, callingfor them to stop. Nyda, Agiel in her fist, ran for him.Jennsen scanned the area for soldiers, then turned back for a look, trying tosee if Nathan Rahl was still coming, trying to see if Nyda was stopping him.Sebastian snatched her hand, pulling her in a headlong rush down the steps.Jennsen didn’t get a chance for another glimpse of her wizard kin.She hadn’t realized how it would affect her to see someone who was related toher. She hadn’t expected to see it in his eyes. There had only been her motherand her, before. It was the strangest feeling-a kind of pensive longing-seeingthis man who was in some way her blood.But if he caught her, her doom would be sealed.Together, she and Sebastian raced down the steps, dodging people who were ontheir way up. Some people grumbled at them to watch where they were going, orcursed them for running. At each landing, she and Sebastian skirted the crowdsand flew down the next flight of stairs.When they reached a level where soldiers were stationed, they slowed. Jennsenpulled her hood up a little tighter, making sure that her hair was hidden, alongwith some of her face, fearing people might recognize her for being the daughterof Darken Rahl. Anxiety knotted her insides at having discovered that there wasthat, too, she now had to worry about.Sebastian’s arm around her waist held her close as he wound his way through theflowing river of people. To avoid soldiers on patrol moving by near thebalusters, he had to guide Jennsen to the side with benches, taking them closeramong the stands, weaving through lines of people.The landing was choked with people buying trinkets and treasures of their visitto the People’s Palace. The air was filled with the aroma of meats and spicesfrom some of the stands. Couples sat on benches eating, drinking, smiling,talking excitedly. Others simply watched people pass. There were shadowy spacesbetween stands and pillars where some couples sat tight together on shortbenches or, where there were no benches, stood close in the dark, cuddling,kissing.When Jennsen and Sebastian reached the edge of the landing, about to head down,they spotted a large patrol of soldiers coming up the steps. Sebastianhesitated. She knew he had to be thinking about the last time soldiers tooknotice of him. This was a large group; it would be impossible to pass themwithout being within an arm’s length. As they marched up the steps, the menlooked carefully at everyone.Jennsen doubted that she would ever again be able to talk Sebastian out of aprison cell. It was likely, since she was with him, that this time they mighttake her in to be questioned. If they detained her, Nathan Rahl would seal herfate. She felt the sense of panic, of doom, closing in on her.Jennsen, not wanting to separate from Sebastian, instead grabbed his arm andpulled him back across the landing, past couples on benches, past those in linesat counters, past people standing back in the shadows, embracing, and into oneof the dark empty niches. Panting from the effort of their long run, she put hershoulders into the narrow nook back between the rear of a stand and a pillar.She drew Sebastian around in front of her, so that his back would be to thesoldiers.With his hood up as it was, they wouldn’t see much of him. If they noticed themat all, they would only see enough to notice she was a woman. They would looklike nothing more than a couple of completely unremarkable people. Jennsen puther arms around Sebastian’s waist so they would took like any of the otherordinary couples spending a few moments alone with each other.It was quieter back in their small sanctuary. The sound of their heavy breathingdrowned out the voices not far away. Most people couldn’t see them, and the oneswho could have were turned to other things. It had made Jennsen uncomfortableand awkward to watch couples snuggled together as she and Sebastian were now, soshe imagined it would be the same for other people. It looked to her that shewas right; no one paid any attention to a young couple embracing and obviouslywanting to be by themselves.Sebastian’s hands were on her waist. Her hands held his back, so that they wouldlook the part as they waited for the soldiers to pass. She was grateful beyondwords that the good spirits had helped her get Sebastian out.“I never thought I’d see you again,” he whispered, for the first time alone withher since he’d been released, for the first time able to say what he wanted.Jennsen looked away from the passing people, into his eyes, and saw how earnesthe was. “I couldn’t leave you there.”He shook his head. “I can’t believe what you did. I can’t believe how you talkedyour way into that place. You had them wrapped around your will. How did youmanage such a thing?”Jennsen swallowed, feeling at the edge of tears from the rush of emotion, thefear, the elation, the panic, the triumph. “I had to, that’s all. I had to getyou out.” She checked to be sure that no one was near before she went on. “Icouldn’t stand the thought of you being in there, or of what they might do toyou. I went to Althea, the sorceress, for help-”“That’s how you managed it, then? Her magic?”Jennsen shook her head as she gazed up into his eyes. “No. Althea couldn’t helpme-it’s a long story. She told me how she’s been to your homeland, to the OldWorld.” She smiled. “Like I said, it’s a long story for another time. It has todo with the Pillars of Creation.”One eyebrow lifted. “You mean, she’s actually been there?”“What?”“The Pillars of Creation-she really went there when she was in the Old World?”His gaze followed a distant soldier for a moment. “You said it has something todo with how she helped you. She actually saw the place?”“What ... ? No ... she couldn’t help me. She said that I had to do it on my own.I was terrified for you. I didn’t know what to do. Then, I remembered what youtold me about bluffing.”Jennsen frowned with a curious squint. “What do you mean about her seeing the .. .”But then her words, her very thought, trailed off as he gazed into her eyes andsmiled that wonderful smile of his.“I’ve never seen anyone pull off anything like that.”It felt unexpectedly wonderful knowing that she had surprised him, pleased him.His arms felt so good, so powerful. Pressed back into the shadows, he washolding her close. She could feel his warm breath on her cheek.“Sebastian ... I was so afraid. I was so afraid I’d never see you again. I wasso afraid for you.”“I know.”“Were you afraid, too?”He nodded. “I could only think about how I’d never see you again.”His face was so close she could feel the warmth radiating from his skin. Shecould feel the entire length of his body, his legs, his torso, pressed againsther as his lips gently brushed hers. Her heart pounded at a furious pace.But then he pulled back, as if having second thoughts. She was thankful for hisarms because, realizing that he had almost kissed her, she wasn’t sure her legswould hold her up, just then. What a heady notion a kiss stolen in the shadowslike this would have been. Almost a kiss.Feet shuffled past nearby, but the people seemed miles away. Jennsen feltcompletely alone with Sebastian, weak in his arms. Safe in his arms.He drew her closer, then, as if overcome, as if he was in the grip of somethinghe could no longer control. She saw in his eyes a kind of helpless surrender.He kissed her.Jennsen stood rock still, surprised that he was actually doing it, kissing her,holding her in his arms, just like she had seen lovers doing. And then her armstightened and she was holding him, too, kissing him back. She had never imaginedthat anything could feel so wonderfully intoxicating.In all her life, Jennsen had never thought such a thing could happen to her. Shehad dreamed of it, of course, but she knew it was only a fantasy, something forother people. She never thought it could happen to her. To Jennsen Rahl.And now, magically, it was.A helpless moan escaped her throat as he held her tight, hugging her fiercely,kissing her with passionate abandon. She was acutely aware of his arm encirclingthe small of her back, his other arm behind her shoulders, her breasts mashedagainst the hard muscles of his chest, his mouth pressed to hers, his ownneedful moan in answer to hers.Unexpectedly, it ended. It was almost as if he had recovered his composure andforced himself back. Jennsen panted, catching her breath. She liked the way itfelt to be held by him. Inches apart, they gazed into each other’s eyes.It was all so startling, so quick, so unexpected. So confusing. So right.She wanted to melt into another embrace, another delicious kiss, but when hechecked who was around, who might be watching, she gathered herself, rememberingwhere they were and why they were pressed back into the dark niche.Nathan Rahl was after them. Only Nyda stood between them. If he told her whoJennsen was, and she believed him, then the entire army would be after them.They had to get out of the palace.When Sebastian pulled away from her, doubts washed into the void.His gaze swept the crowd as he looked to make sure no one was watching them.“Let’s go.”His hand found hers and he was suddenly pulling her away from the sanctuary ofthe shadowy fold in the palace.Jennsen felt light-headed with a flood of confusing emotions, everything fromfear and shame to giddy excitement. He had kissed her. A real kiss. A man-womankiss. Her, Jennsen Rahl, the most hunted woman in D’Hara.She almost didn’t notice the steps as they descended. She tried to look normal,to look like any other person simply leaving the palace after a visit. Shedidn’t feel normal, though. She felt as if everyone who looked at her would knowthat he had just kissed her.When a soldier unexpectedly turned their way, she held Sebastian’s arm in bothhands, pressing her head to his shoulder, and smiled at the man as if in casualgreeting. It was enough of a distraction that they passed him and were awaybefore he even thought to look at Sebastian.“That was quick thinking,” Sebastian whispered, letting out a breath.Once past the soldier, they picked up their pace again. The sights she had seenon the way in were now a blur. She didn’t care about any of it. She just wantedout. She wanted away from the place where they had imprisoned Sebastian, wherethe two of them were in constant danger. She was more exhausted from theunremitting tension of being in the place than she had been from the dangers inthe swamp.At last, the stairs finally ended. The light coming in the huge maw of the grandentrance made it difficult to see, but the opening out of the plateau was awelcome sight. Together, hand in hand, they rushed toward the light.Crowds of people milled about, stopping at stands, watching passersby, gawkingat the size of the place, while still others flowed past on their way up to thestairs. Soldiers near the sides watched people going in, so she and Sebastianmoved toward the middle. The soldiers didn’t seem as interested in those leavingas those entering.Cold daylight greeted them outside the tower of rock. The marketplace below theplateau was a bustle of activity, just as it had been before. The makeshiftstreets past the tents and stands teemed with people looking or sometimesstopping to make a purchase. Others moved toward the entrance to the People’sPalace, with business, with hopes, with small goods, with money. Hawkersstrolled among the visitors, calling out the wonders of their wares.She had told him that the horses and Betty were missing, so Sebastian led herinstead to a nearby enclosure filled with horses of every variety. The manwatching the horses was sitting on a crate that made up part of the rope fence,rubbing his arms in the cold. Saddles sat in a line along the edge of themakeshift fence.“We’d like to buy some horses,” Sebastian said as he approached, checking thecondition of the animals.The man looked up, squinting in the sunlight. “Good for you.”“Well, are you selling or not?”“Not,” the man said. He turned and spat. With the back of his hand he wiped hischin. “These horses belong to people. I’m paid to watch them, not to sell them.I go selling someone’s horse, I’m liable to be skinned alive. ““Do you know who might sell horses?”“Sorry, can’t say as I do. Check around.”They thanked him and moved down the makeshift streets, looking for open areaswhere horses might be picketed. Jennsen didn’t mind walking-that was usually howshe and her mother traveled-but she understood Sebastian’s urgency to find ahorse. With such a narrow escape, and then with the wizard, Nathan Rahl, tryingto stop them, they needed to get far away from the People’s Palace as fast asthey could.At a second place, they got the same answer as the first. Jennsen was hungry,and wished she could get something to eat, but she knew that they would bebetter off making good their escape than lingering to have a meal and end updying on a full stomach. Sebastian, holding her hand tight, pulled her betweenstands, cutting across the crowded streets toward horses picketed in a dustyenclosure.“You able to sell horses?” Sebastian asked a man watching over them.The man, his arms folded, was leaning against a post. “No. I’ve none to sell.”Sebastian nodded. “Thanks anyway.”The man caught Sebastian’s cloak before they moved on. He leaned closer. “You beleaving the area?”Sebastian shrugged. “Going back south. Thought we’d like to pick up a horsewhile we were visiting the palace.”The man leaned out a little and checked both ways. “After dark, come see me.Plan on being around that long? I may be able to help you.”Sebastian nodded. “I have some business that will keep me here the day. I’ll beback after it’s dark.”He took Jennsen’s arm and moved her down the crowded street. They had to stepout of the way of two sisters fawning over necklaces they’d bought as the fatherwalked behind with a load of goods they had purchased. The mother watched hergirls as she pulled a couple of sheep along behind. It gave Jennsen a pang ofheartache for Betty.“Are you crazy?” she whispered at Sebastian, confused as to why he would tellthe man that they would be back after dark. “We can’t stay here all day.”“Of course we can’t. The man is a cutthroat. Since I had to ask if he wasselling horses, he knows I have the money to buy one and would like to relieveme of it. If we go back there after dark he’ll likely have friends hiding in theshadows waiting to do us in.”“He’s a thief? Are you serious?”“This place is full of thieves.” Sebastian leaned in with a stem look. “This isD’Hara-a land where the greedy and perverse prey on the weak, where people carenothing about the welfare of their fellow man, and even less about the future ofmankind.”Jennsen understood what he meant. On their way to the People’s Palace, Sebastianhad told her about Brother Narev and his teachings, his hope for a future wheremankind’s lot was not suffering, a future where there was no starvation orsickness or cruelty. Where every man cared for his fellow man. Sebastian saidthat, along with the help of Jagang the Just and the will of good and decentpeople, the Fellowship of Order would help to bring it about. Jennsen hadtrouble imagining such a wonderful world, a world away from Lord Rahl.“But, if that man was a thief, why would you tell him that you’ll come back?”“Because if I didn’t, if I told him I couldn’t wait, then he might signal hispartners. We wouldn’t know who they are but they would know us and likely find aspot they could surprise us.”“You really think so?”“Like I said, the place is full of thieves. Watch yourself or you might get yourpurse cut right off your belt without even knowing it.”She was just about to confess that that very thing had already happened when sheheard her name being called.“Jennsen! Jennsen!”It was Tom. Big as he was, he stood out like a mountain among foothills, yet hewas holding up his hand, waving for her, as if he feared she would have troublespotting him.Sebastian leaned closer. “You know him?”“He helped me get you out.”Jennsen had no time to explain any more than that before smiling heracknowledgment to the big man waving his arm at her. Tom, happy as a puppy atseeing her, rushed out to meet her in the middle of the street. She saw hisbrothers back at their table.Tom wore a wide grin. “I knew you’d come, just like you promised. Joe andClayton said I was nuts to think you would, but I told them you would keep yourpromise to stop before you left.”“I ... I just came from the palace, just now.” She patted her cloak where itconcealed the knife. “I’m afraid that we’re in a rush and need to be on ourway.”Tom nodded knowingly. He seized Sebastian’s hand and pumped it as if they werefriends long separated.“I’m Tom. You must be the friend Jennsen was helping.”“That’s right. I’m Sebastian.”Tom tilted his head in gesture toward Jennsen. “She’s something, isn’t she?”“I’ve never seen anyone like her,” Sebastian assured him.“A man couldn’t want for more than a woman like this on his side,” Tom said. Hestepped between them, putting an arm around their shoulders, preventing anyescape, and guided them back to his stand. “I’ve got something for you both.”“What do you mean?” Jennsen asked.They didn’t have time for any delay. They needed to get away before the wizardcame out looking for them-or sent troops after them. Now that Nathan Rahl hadseen her, he could describe her to guards. Everyone would know what they lookedlike.“Oh, something,” Tom said, cryptically.She smiled up at the big blond man. “What do you have?”Tom reached into his pocket and came up with a purse. He held it out to her.“Well, first off, I got this back for you.”“My money?”Tom grinned as he watched the astonishment in her eyes as her fingers touchedher familiar worn leather purse. “You’ll be pleased to know that the gentlemanwho had it was reluctant to part with it, but since it wasn’t his, in the end hesaw the light of reason, along with a few stars.”Tom nudged her shoulder as if to say she could figure out what more he meant bythat.Sebastian’s gaze followed as she pulled back her cloak and tied the purse aroundher belt. His expression said that he had no trouble figuring out what hadhappened to it.“But how did you find him?” Jennsen asked.Tom shrugged. “The place looks big to those visiting, but when you’re hereoften, you learn who the regulars are and know what their business is. Irecognized your description of the cutpurse. Early this morning he breezed by,talking his line, trying to gull a woman out of her money. About the time hepassed, I saw his hand below her packages, slipping into her shawl, so Isnatched him by the collar. My brothers and I had a long talk with the fellowabout returning things he’d ‘found’ that didn’t belong to him.”“This place is full of thieves,” Jennsen said.Tom shook his head. “Don’t judge a place by one man. Don’t get me wrong-they’rearound. But most folks here are honest enough. The way I see it, wherever you gothere will always be thieves. Always has been, always will be. The man I fearmost is the one who preaches virtue and a better life while using people’s goodintentions to shade their eyes from the light of truth.”“I guess so,” she said.“Maybe virtue and a better life is a goal worthy of such means,” Sebastian said.“From what I’ve seen in life, a man who preaches a better way at the cost of thetruth is a man who wants nothing more than for himself to be the master and youthe slave.”“I see what you mean,” Sebastian conceded. “I guess I’m fortunate not to havehad dealings with such people.”“Count your blessings,” Tom said.At his table, Jennsen took the hand of both Joe and Clayton. “Thank you forhelping. I can’t believe you got my purse back.”Their grins had much in common with Tom’s.“Most fun we’ve had in a while,” Joe said.“Not only that,” Clayton added, “but we can’t thank you enough for keeping Tombusy so we could spend a couple days visiting the palace. About time Tom gave usa break.”Tom put a hand against Jennsen’s back, urging her around the table, to his wagonbeyond. Sebastian followed the two of them between the wine barrels and thestand beside them selling leather goods, where, before, Irma had sold hersausages.Behind Tom’s wagon, Jennsen saw his big horses. Then, beyond them, she saw theothers.“Our horses!” Jennsen’s jaw dropped. “You got us our horses?”“Sure did,” Tom said, beaming with pride. “Found Irma this morning when she cameto the market with another load of sausages. She had the horses with her. I toldher you’d promised to come see me today before you left, so she was glad to havea chance to get them back to you. All your supplies are there with them.”“That’s good luck,” Sebastian said. “We can’t thank you enough. We’re in a hurryto get going.”Tom gestured to Jennsen’s waist, where she kept the knife under her cloak. “Ifigured.”Jennsen looked around, feeling a rising flood of dismay. “Where’s Betty?”Tom frowned. “Betty?”Jennsen swallowed. “My goat, Betty.” It was a mighty effort to keep her voicesteady. “Where’s Betty?”“I’m sorry, Jennsen. I don’t know anything about a goat. Irma only had thehorses.” Tom’s face sagged. “I never thought to ask about anything else.”“Do you know where Irma lives?”Tom’s head hung. “Sorry, no. She showed up this morning and she had your horsesand things. She sold her sausages and waited around for a while before she saidshe had to get on home.”Jennsen seized his sleeve. “How long ago?”Tom shrugged. “I don’t know. Couple hours ago?” He glanced over his shoulder athis brothers. They both nodded.Jennsen’s jaw trembled. She feared to test her voice again. She knew that sheand Sebastian couldn’t hang around waiting. With the wizard so close, trying tostop her, she knew they would be lucky to get away with their lives. Returningwould be out of the question.A glance to Sebastian’s face confirmed it.Tears stung her eyes. “But ... didn’t you find out where she lived?”Tom’s gaze sank as he shook his head.“Didn’t you ask if she had anything else belonging to us?”He shook his head again.Jennsen wanted to scream and pound her fists against his chest. “Did you eventhink to ask when she would be back?”Tom shook his head.“But we promised her money for watching our horses,” Jennsen said. “She wouldsay when she would be back so she could be paid.”Still looking at his feet, Tom said, “She told me she was owed money forwatching the horses. I paid her.”Sebastian pulled out money, counted out silver coins, and held them out to Tom.Tom refused it, but Sebastian insisted, finally tossing the money on the tableto settle the debt.Jennsen choked back her desperation. Betty was gone.Tom looked heartbroken. “I’m sorry.”Jennsen could only nod. She wiped her nose as she watched Joe and Claytonsaddling their horses for them. The sounds of the market seemed distant. In anumb state, she hardly felt the cold. When she saw the horses she had thought...Now, she could think only of Betty bleating in distress. If Betty was even stillalive.“We can’t stay,” Sebastian answered softly to the pleading look she gave him.“You know that as well as I. We have to be on our way.”She looked back to Tom. “But I told you before, about Betty.” Desperation droveinto her voice. “I told you that Irma had our horses and my goat, Betty. I toldyou-I know I did.”Tom couldn’t meet her eyes. “You did, ma’am. I’m sorry, but I just forgot to askher. I can’t lie to you and tell you anything else or make an excuse. You toldme. I forgot.”Jennsen nodded and put a hand on his arm. “Thank you for getting our horses, andall the other help. I couldn’t have done it without you.”“We have to get going,” Sebastian said, checking his saddlebags and securing theflaps. “It’s going to take time to work our way through the crowds and out ofhere.”“We’ll give you an escort,” Joe said.“People get out of the way of our big draft horses,” Clayton explained. “Comeon. We know the quickest way out. Follow us and we’ll get you through thecrowds.”Both men pulled a horse over so they could step up on a barrel and mount upbareback. They deftly guided the huge horses out of the narrow way between thestands and barrels without so much as jostling anything. Sebastian stood waitingfor her, holding the reins to their horses, Rusty and Pete.On her way past, Jennsen paused and gazed up into Tom’s eyes, sharing with him aprivate, wordless moment among all the people around. She stretched up andkissed his cheek, then held her own cheek against his for a moment. Hisfingertips just touched her shoulder. As she drew away, his wistful gaze stayedon her face.“Thank you for helping me,” she whispered. “I’d have been lost without YOU.”Tom smiled then. “My pleasure, ma’am.”“Jennsen,” she said.He nodded. “Jennsen.” He cleared his throat. “Jennsen, I’m sorry-”Jennsen, holding back her tears, touched her fingers to his lips to silence him.“You helped me save Sebastian’s life. You were a hero for me when I needed one.Thank you from the depths of my heart.”He stuffed his hands in his pockets as his gaze sank to the ground once more.“Safe journey to you, Jennsen, wherever you may go in your life. Thank you forletting me join you for a small part of it.”“Steel against steel,” she said, not even understanding why, but it somehowsounded right. “You helped me in that.”Tom smiled then, with a look of intense pride and gratitude.“That he may be the magic against magic. Thank you, Jennsen.”She patted Rusty’s muscular neck before putting a boot into a stirrup andboosting herself up onto the saddle. She cast the big man a last look over hershoulder. Staying with his things, Tom watched as Jennsen and Sebastian followedJoe and Clayton out into the sea of people. Their two big escorts, yelling andwhistling, moved people out of the way, creating a clear path ahead. Peoplestopped and looked when they heard the commotion coming, then stepped aside atthe sight of the huge horses.Sebastian, flashing a heated scowl, leaned toward her. “What was the big oxbabbling about magic?” he whispered over at her.“I don’t know,” she said in a low voice. She let out a sigh. “But he helped meget you out.”She wanted to tell him that Tom might be big, but he was no ox. She didn’tthough. For some reason, she didn’t want to talk about Tom to Sebastian. Eventhough Tom had been helping her to rescue Sebastian, what they had done togetherfor some reason felt very private to her.When they finally reached the edge of the marketplace, Joe and Clayton wavedthem a farewell as Jennsen and Sebastian urged their horses ahead at a gallop,out onto the cold, empty Azrith Plains."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30Jennsen and Sebastian rode north and west, across the Azrith Plains, not farfrom where only that morning she had ridden back with Tom in his wagon from theswamp around Althea’s place. Her visit to Althea only the day before, along withthe treacherous journey through the swamp, seemed remote to her, now. She hadspent most of the day getting up into the palace, talking her way past guardsand officials, getting Sebastian released, bluffing the Mord-Sith, Nyda, intohelping them, and getting down and out of the plateau with Wizard Rahl at theirheels. With so much of the day already gone, they weren’t able to travel a greatdistance before darkness descended and they had to make camp out in the openplain.“With those cutthroats not all that far away, we don’t dare make a fire,”Sebastian said when he saw her shivering. “They could spot us from miles awayand if we’re night-blinded by a fire we would never know they were sneaking upon us.”Overhead, the moonless sky was a vast glittering mantle of stars. Jennsenthought about what Althea said, that a bird could be seen on a moonless night bynoting the stars it blocked out as it passed overhead. She said that was how shecould see one who was a hole in the world. Jennsen saw no bird, just threecoyotes in the distance, trotting along on a night patrol of their territory. Inthe flat, empty land, they were easy enough to spot by starlight alone as theywent on their hunt for small nocturnal animals.With numb fingers, Jennsen untied her bedroll from the back of the saddle andpulled it down. “And where would you propose we get the wood to make a fire,anyway?”Sebastian turned and stared at her. A smile stole onto his face. “I neverthought of that. I guess we couldn’t have a fire even if we wanted one.”She scrutinized the empty plain as she dragged the saddle off of Rusty’s backand laid it on the ground near Sebastian. Even with only the cold starlight, shecould make out things well enough. “If anyone approached, we could see themcoming. Do you think one of us should keep watch through the night?”“No. Without a campfire and not moving, they’d never find us out in this greatdark expanse. I think it would be better to get some sleep so we can make goodtime tomorrow.”With the horses picketed, she used her saddle for a seat. As she unfurled herbedroll, Jennsen found two white cloth bundles inside. She knew she hadn’t putany such things in her bedroll. She undid the knot at the top of one bundle anddiscovered a meat pie inside. She saw, then, Sebastian making the samediscovery.“Looks like the Creator has provided for us,” he said.Jennsen smiled as she stared down at the meat pie in her lap. “Tom left these. “Sebastian didn’t ask how she knew. “The Creator has provided for us through Tom.Brother Narev says that even when we think someone has provided for us, it isactually the Creator working through them. We in the Old World believe that whenwe give to someone in need, we are really doing the Creator’s good works. That’swhy the welfare of others is our sacred duty.”Jennsen said nothing, fearing that if she did, he might think she wascriticizing Brother Narev, or even the Creator. She couldn’t dispute the word ofa great man like Brother Narev. She had never done any good works like BrotherNarev had. She had never even left anyone meat pies or done anything elsehelpful. It seemed to her that she brought only trouble and suffering topeople-her mother, Lathea, Althea, Friedrich, and who knew how many others. Ifany force worked through her, it certainly wasn’t the Creator.Sebastian, perhaps seeing something of her thoughts in her expression, spokesoftly. “That’s why I’m helping you-I believe it’s what the Creator would wantme to do. That’s how I know Brother Narev and Emperor Jagang would approve of mehelping you. This is the very thing we’re fighting for-to have people care aboutothers by sharing their burdens.”She smiled not just her appreciation, but also at the notion of such nobleintentions. Noble intentions, though, which, for reasons she didn’t even fullyunderstand, felt to her like a knife in the back.Jennsen looked up from the meat pie in her lap. “So, that’s why you’re helpingme, then.” Her smile was forced. “Because it’s your duty.”Sebastian looked almost as if he’d been slapped. “No.” He came closer, goingdown on one knee. “No. I ... in the beginning, of course, but . . . it’s notjust duty.”“You make it sound like I’m a leper you think you have to-”“No-that’s not it at all.” As he searched for words, that radiant smile of hiscame to his face, that smile that made her heart ache. “I’ve never met anyonelike you, Jennsen. I swear, I’ve never laid my eyes on a woman as beautiful asyou, or as smart. You make me feel like I’m ... like I’m a nobody. But then whenyou smile at me, I feel like I’m someone important. I’ve never met anyone whomade me feel this way. At first it was duty, but now, I swear. . . “Jennsen sat in shock at hearing him say such things, at hearing the tendersincerity, the earnest pleading, in his voice.“I never knew.”“I should never have kissed you. I know it was wrong. I’m a soldier in the armyagainst oppression. My life is devoted to the cause of helping my people-allpeople. I don’t have anything to offer a woman like you.”She couldn’t imagine why he would think he had to offer her something. He hadsaved her life. “Then, why did you kiss me?”He gazed into her eyes, looking as if he had to pull words up from some greatpainful depth. “I couldn’t help myself. I’m sorry. I tried not to. I knew it waswrong, but when we were that close, and I was looking into your beautiful eyes,and your arms were holding me, and I was holding you . . . I’d never wantedanything so much in my life . . . I just couldn’t help myself. I had to. I’msorry. “Jennsen’s gaze fell away. She stared down at the meat pie. Sebastian pulled thefamiliar mask of composure around himself and sat back down on his saddle.“Don’t feel sorry,” she whispered without looking up. “I liked the kiss.”He sat forward expectantly. “You did?”Jennsen nodded. “I’m glad to hear that it wasn’t done out of duty.”That made him smile and eased the tension.“No duty ever felt that good,” he said.Together, they laughed-something she couldn’t even remember doing. It felt goodto laugh.As Jennsen devoured one of the meat pies, relishing the flavorful spices andsavory chunks of meat, she felt good again. She hoped she hadn’t been too hardon Tom for forgetting about Betty. She had let her frustrations, fear, and angercome out at him. He was a good man. He had helped her when she needed it most.Her thoughts lingered on Tom, on how good she had felt when she was around him.He made her feel important, feel confident in herself, whereas Sebastian oftenmade her feel humble. Tom had a handsome smile-a different kind of handsome thanSebastian’s smile. Tom had a hearty smile. Sebastian had an inscrutable smile.Tom’s smile made her feel secure and strong. Sebastian’s smile made her feeldefenseless and weak.After she had eaten every crumb of the meat pie, Jennsen wrapped herself inblankets over the top of her cloak. Still shivering, she remembered how Bettyhad kept them warm at night. In the silence, her sense of gloom returned tohaunt her, refusing to allow her to fall asleep, despite her exhaustion fromeverything she had been through the last couple of days.She didn’t look forward to the forlorn prospect of what the future might holdfor her. She could foresee only an endless hunt until Lord Rahl’s men finallycaught her. She felt empty without her mother, without Betty. She realized thatshe didn’t have any idea where she would go, now, other than to keep running.She had been intent on Althea’s help, but even that had proved to be an emptydream. In some distant corner of her mind, Jennsen had held out a spark ofirrational hope that going to her childhood home of the People’s Palace mightsomehow hold a favorable resolution.She shivered not only with the cold, but with the bleak prospect of what thefuture held.Sebastian inched his back up close to her, protecting her from the wind. Theidea of it being more than duty to him was a comfort. She thought about what itfelt like to have his body pressed against the length of her. She thought aboutthe intoxicating feel of his mouth against hers.His words that had so surprised her, “I’ve never laid my eyes on a woman asbeautiful as you,” still echoed around in her head. She wasn’t sure that shebelieved him. Maybe she was afraid to believe him.The first day she had met him he made several complimentary remarks, the firstabout how people might say the dead soldier saw a beautiful young womanstrutting along and thus tripped and fell to his death, and then “Sebastian’srule,” as he called it, giving her the dead soldier’s ornate knife, sayingbeauty belonged with beauty. She had never trusted words offered soeffortlessly.She thought again about the sincerity in his eyes, this time, and howsurprisingly tongue-tied and awkward he’d seemed. Insincerity was often smoothlydelivered, but matters of the heart were more difficult to express because somuch was at stake.It surprised her to hear that her smile made him feel important. She hadn’tsuspected that he might feel the same kinds of emotions she felt. She hadn’tsuspected how good it would feel to have a man like Sebastian, a man of theworld, an important man, think she was beautiful. Jennsen always felt gracelessand plain compared with her mother. She liked knowing that someone thought shewas beautiful.She wondered what it would be like if he rolled over, right there, and embracedher again, kissed her again, this time with no one around. She could feel herheart pounding at the very prospect.“I’m sorry about your goat,” he whispered in the silence, his back still to her.“I know.”“But with Wizard Rahl after us and still this close, the goat would only slow usdown.”As much as she loved Betty, Jennsen knew she had to put other things first.Still, she would give almost anything to hear that singular bleat of Betty’svoice, or see her little upright tail wagging in a blur as her whole bodywiggled with the excitement of Jennsen’s greeting. Jennsen could feel the lumpsof carrots under her head in the pack she was using as a pillow.She knew they couldn’t stay and search for Betty, but that didn’t make it anyeasier to know they were leaving her for good. It broke her heart.Jennsen looked back over her shoulder in the darkness. “Did they hurt you? I wasso worried that they would hurt you.”“That Mord-Sith would have. You came just in time.”“What did it feel like when she touched you with the Agiel?”Sebastian thought a moment. “Like being hit by lightning, I suppose.”Jennsen laid her head back down on the pack. She wondered why she had feltnothing from the power of Mord-Sith’s weapon. He had to be wondering that samething, but if he was, he didn’t ask. She would have had no answer for him,anyway. Nyda had been astonished, too, and said that her Agiel worked oneveryone. Nyda was wrong. For some reason, Jennsen found that strangelyworrisome."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31Stiff and sore from the cold night on the ground, Jennsen woke just as the skywas beginning to take on a faint pink glow. The western sky still displayed asweep of stars. She hadn’t slept much, and wished she could sleep more, but theycould not afford to linger. It could be fatal to be caught out in the open likethey were, where they could be spotted from miles away.Stretching her arms over her head, the first thing Jennsen laid her eyes uponwas the black shape of the plateau against the faint blush of the eastern sky.As she watched, the People’s Palace atop it took on a glow around the edges asthe first golden rays of the morning sun, still beyond the horizon, touched itfrom behind. Standing there, looking at the palace, Jennsen felt a peculiarlonging. This was her homeland. She wanted so much to have some sense of herplace in the world. But her homeland harbored only terror and death for her.Fearing how near they yet were to the palace and Wizard Rahl, they quicklygathered their belongings and saddled the horses. Climbing up onto a frigidsaddle was a miserable experience. Jennsen spread a blanket across her lap sothat Rusty’s heat would help warm her. She patted and rubbed her horse’s neck,both out of affection and to warm her fingers. Rusty’s body heat would keep hersecond meat pie, wrapped in her bedroll tied to the back of the saddle, fromfreezing.They rode hard, walking at times to give the horses a rest, but their effortrewarded them, when, later in the day, the country began to bear evidence thatthey were reaching the edges of the Azrith Plains. Their goal was to escape intothe wall of mountains rimming the western horizon. Their clear view back acrossthe plains revealed no pursuers, so far, anyway.By late in the afternoon they rode into an area of low hills, ravines, scragglyvegetation, and stunted trees. It was as if the unbroken hardpan of the AzrithPlains could no longer keep itself flat and out of boredom had to finally rolland heave into a featured terrain.The hungry horses tore at the shrubs and thick clumps of dry grasses on the waypast. Even though the horses had bits in their mouth, Jennsen didn’t have theheart to deny them a bite to eat. She was hungry, too. The meat pies hadprovided them a good breakfast but were long ago finished off.Before dark, they reached foothills leading up into more rugged country, wherethey made camp in the lee of a rock outcropping. At the base of a cut of rockJennsen found a place that would provide them shelter from the wind and, for thehorses, at last enough grasses to graze on. As soon as the horses wereunsaddled, they eagerly began browsing on the clumps of tough stalks.Jennsen pulled out some of their gear and supplies while Sebastian huntedaround, coming up with remnants of some of the stunted little trees, long deadand dried to a silver gray. He used his battle-axe to cut down the dry wood andbuilt a small fire up close to the cut of rock, where it wouldn’t easily beseen. While she waited for the fire to get hot, he gently laid a blanket aroundher shoulders. Sitting before the fire, with Sebastian close at her side,Jennsen worked salt pork onto sticks and rested them across rocks so the porkcould cook over the fire.“Was it hard to get to Althea’s place?” he asked at last.She realized that, being preoccupied with everything that had happened, shehadn’t told him much at all about what had taken place while he was being heldprisoner.“I had to go through a swamp, but I made it.”She didn’t really want to complain about her difficulties, her fears, her battlewith the snake, or nearly drowning. That was past. She had survived. Sebastianhad all the while been sitting in a prison, knowing that at any moment theymight put him to death, or torture him. Althea was forever a prisoner in theswamp. Others had it worse than she.“The swamp sounds wonderful. It had to be better than this wretched cold. I’venever seen anything like it in all my life.”“You mean it isn’t cold where you come from? In the Old World?”“No. Winters have cold spells-nothing like this, of course-and sometimes it’srainy, too, but we never have that dreadful snow and it’s not like thismiserable cold of the New World. I don’t know why anyone would want to livehere.”She was startled at the idea of a winter without snow and cold. She had troubleeven imagining it.“Where else could we live? We have no choice.”“I guess,” he admitted with a sigh.“Winter is wearing on. Spring will arrive before you know it. You’ll see. ““I hope so. I’d even rather be in that place you mentioned before, the Keeper’sFurnace, than in this frozen wasteland.”Jennsen frowned. “The place I mentioned? I never mentioned any place called theKeeper’s Furnace.”“Sure you did.” Sebastian used his sword to move the logs together so that theflames could build. Sparks swirled up into the darkness. “Back at the palace.Just before we kissed.”Jennsen held her hands out, warming her fingers before the glorious heat. “Idon’t remember.”“You said Althea had been there.”“Where?”“The Pillars of Creation.”Jennsen drew her hands back inside her cloak and stared over at him. “No, Inever said that. She was talking about something else-not anywhere she’d been.”“What was she talking about, then?”Jennsen dismissed his question with an impatient wave of her hand. “It was justidle talk. It’s not important.” She pulled a ringlet of red hair away from herface. “The Pillars of Creation is a place?”He nodded as he banked the white-hot coals together with his sword. “Like Isaid, the Keeper’s Furnace.”Frustrated, she folded her arms. “What does that mean?”He looked up, puzzled by her tone. “You know, hot. Like, when someone says,‘it’s as hot today as the Keeper’s furnace.’ That’s why people will occasionallyrefer to the place as the Keeper’s Furnace, but its name is the Pillars ofCreation.”“And you’ve been there?”“Are you kidding? I don’t even know of anyone who has gone there. People fearthe place. Some think it really is the Keeper’s province, and that only deathexists there.”“Where is it?”He gestured south with his sword. “In a desolate place down in the Old World.You know how it is-people are often superstitious about remote places. “Jennsen stared back into the flames, trying to reconcile it all in her head.There was something about it that wasn’t exactly right. Something about it thatalarmed her.“Why is it called that? The Pillars of Creation?”Sebastian shrugged, frowning again at her tone. “Like I said, it’s a desertedplace, hot as the Keeper’s furnace, so that’s why some people call it that, theheat of the place. As for the actual name, the place is said to be-”“If no one goes there, the how does anyone know all this?”“Over time there have been some people who had gone there, or rather, gone nearthere, and they’ve told others about it. Word spreads, knowledge is accumulated.It’s in a place kind of like the plains here-”“The Azrith Plains?”“Yes, deserted like the Azrith Plains, but much bigger. And it’s always hotthere. Dry, and deathly hot. There are a few trade routes that cross the barrenfringes. Without proper clothing to protect you from the broiling sun andblistering winds, you would bake alive in no time. Without enough water youwon’t last long.”“And this place is called the Pillars of Creation?”“No, that’s just the land you must go through, first. Near the center of thisvast empty land, there is said to be a low place, a broad valley, that’s evenhotter yet-deadly hot, hot as the Keeper’s furnace. That’s the Pillars ofCreation.”“But why is it called the Pillars of Creation?”Sebastian mounded sand with his boot to contain the red-hot coals that droppedfrom the logs down into the wavering heat. “It’s said that down the cliffs, downthe surrounding rugged rock walls and slopes, down in that vast valley, thereare towering rock columns. It’s for those soaring rock formations that the placeis named.”Jennsen turned the sticks with the salt pork. “That would make sense. Rockpillars.”“I’ve seen towers something like that before, in other places, where rock isstacked up like disorderly columns of coins on a table. These are said to bemore extraordinary than any others, as if the world itself were reaching up inhomage toward the Creator, so some consider it a sacred place. But it’s a placeof deadly heat, too, so while it is thought of by some as the Creator’s Forge,it’s also associated with the Keeper-so some call it the Keeper’s Furnace. Inaddition to the heat, everyone has reason enough to fear going there. It remainsfor everyone a place of otherworldly conflict best left alone.”“Creation and destruction-life and death-together?”The firelight danced in his eyes as he looked over at her. “That’s what peoplesay.”“You mean, some think this is a place where death itself is trying to consumethe world of life?”“Death is always stalking the living. Brother Narev teaches that man’s own evilis what brings the Keeper’s shadow to darken the world. If we give in to evilways, that gives evil power in the world of life, then the Keeper will be ableto topple the very Pillars of Creation, and the world will end.”The words chilled Jennsen to the bone, as if the hand of death itself hadtouched her. It would be just like a sorceress to practice sly wiles with words.Jennsen’s mother had warned her that sorceresses never told what they knew, butoften held back important things.What had been Althea’s true intent when she had so casually named Jennsen one of“the pillars of Creation”? Although Jennsen didn’t understand it, it now seemedall too clear that Althea might have had some hidden motive for planting theseed of that name in Jennsen’s mind.“So, what happened with Althea? Why couldn’t she help you?”Jennsen was startled out of her thoughts by his voice. She turned the stickswith the salt pork, seeing that it still needed more cooking, as she consideredhow to answer the question simply.“She told me that she tried to help me, once, when I was little. Darken Rahlfound out and crippled her for it. He twisted her gift, too, so she can’t useher own magic. Now, she couldn’t cast me a spell even if she had wanted to.”“Maybe, without even knowing it, Darken Rahl was doing the Creator’s work.”Jennsen frowned in astonishment. “What do you mean?”“The Imperial Order wants to eliminate magic from the world. Brother Narev saysit’s the Creator’s work we do, because magic is evil.”“And what do you think? Do you really think the gift of the Creator could beevil?”“How is magic used?” His hooded gaze fixed on her, anger clearly evident in hiseyes. “Is it used to help people? Help the Creator’s children in this life? No.It’s used for selfish reasons. You have only to look at the House of Rahl.They’ve used the gift, for thousands of years, to rule D’Hara. And what has thatrule been? Has it been to the help or benefit the people? Or has it been one oftorture and death.”The last of it was not a question, but a statement, and one Jennsen could notargue.“Maybe,” Sebastian added, “the Creator was working through Darken Rahl to liftthe taint of magic from Althea-to mercifully free her from it.”Jennsen rested her chin on her knees as she watched the meat sizzling. Altheasaid that she was left with only the gift of prophecy, complaining that it wastorturous to her.Jennsen’s mother had taught her to draw a Grace and told her that the gift wasgiven by the Creator. In the proper hands, a Grace was magic. Even thoughJennsen had no magic, that magical symbol had on several occasions protectedher. While she knew that people could do evil, Jennsen didn’t like the idea ofthinking that the gift was evil. Even though she couldn’t do magic, she knewthat it could be a wondrous thing.She gently sought to try a different approach. “You said that Emperor Jagang hassorceresses with him, the Sisters of the Light, who might be able to help me.They use magic. If magic is evil-”“They use magic in our cause, so that magic might one day be eliminated from theworld.”“How can that make sense? If you truly believe magic to be evil, then how couldyou think to ally yourselves with what you profess to be evil?”Sebastian checked the salt pork when she held one of the sticks out to him, thenpulled a piece off on the point of his knife. He held up the knife and waggledit for her to see.“People kill other people with knives and swords. If we wanted to eliminateknives and swords so that the killing would stop, we could hardly do so withwords alone. We would have to take away people’s knives and swords by force inorder to stop the madness of violence for the good of everyone. People cling toevil. We would have to use knives and swords in that fight to rid the world ofthose evil things. Then the world would be at peace. Without the means ofmurder, people’s passions would cool and the Keeper would flee their hearts.”Jennsen carved off a chunk of sizzling meat and blew on it to cool it a little.“And so you use magic in that way?”“That’s right.” Sebastian chewed, giving a moan of approval to the taste beforehe swallowed and went on. “We want to eliminate the evil of magic, but to do sowe have to use magic in the fight, or else evil would win. “Jennsen took a juicy bite of the pork, moaning her agreement with his opinion ofthe taste. It was wonderful having something hot to eat.“And do Brother Narev and the Emperor Jagang think that knives and swords areevil, too?”“Of course, because their sole purpose is to maim and kill-naturally we don’tmean tools like bread knives, but weapons, certainly, are evil things. Peoplewill eventually be free of their scourge, though, and then the plague of murderand death will be a thing of the past.”“You mean to say that even soldiers won’t have weapons?”“No, soldiers will always have to be armed in order to defend a free andpeaceful people.”“But, then how can people protect themselves?”“From what? Only the soldiers will carry deadly weapons.”Jennsen tilted her head toward him in admonition. “Were it not for the knife Icarry, soldiers would have easily murdered me along with my mother. ““Evil soldiers. Our soldiers fight only for good, for the defense and securityof the people, not to enslave them. When we defeat the D’Haran forces, thenthere will be peace.”“But even then-”He leaned toward her. “Don’t you see? Eventually, with magic eliminated, weaponswill no longer be needed. It’s the corrupt passions of people which are madelethal because they have access to weapons that result in crimes and murders.”“Soldiers have passions.”He dismissed the thought with a wave of a hand. “Not if they’re trained properlyand are under supervision of good officers.”Jennsen gazed off at the sparkling dome of stars. The world he envisionedcertainly sounded inviting. But if what he claimed were true, then magic, asthey used it, was being used for a good end, so that would mean it could beneither good nor bad, but that, much like her knife, the intent of the personwielding magic actually carried the moral condition, not the magic itself.Rather than say so, she asked another question.“What would a world without magic be like?”Sebastian smiled wistfully. “Everyone would be equal. No one would have anunfair advantage.” He stabbed another piece of meat and pulled it off the stickon the point of his knife. “Everyone would work together, then, because we wouldall be the same. No one would have the unfair use of magic and be able to takeadvantage of others. You, for example, would be free to live your life withoutLord Rahl hunting you with his magic. “Althea said that Richard Rahl had been born with powers of the gift not seen inthousands of years. He had, after all, gotten closer to her than Darken Rahlever had. He had sent those men who had murdered her mother. But Althea had alsosaid that Jennsen was a hole in the world to those with the gift; Lord Rahlcould hunt her, but not with magic.“You will never be free,” Sebastian finally added in a quiet voice, until youeliminate Richard Rahl.”Her eyes turned toward him. “Why me? With all those fighting against him, why doyou say until I eliminate him?”But even as she was asking the question, she began to see the terrible answer.“Well,” he said, leaning back. “I guess what I really meant to say was that youwon’t be free until Lord Rahl is eliminated.”He turned away and pulled a waterskin closer. She watched him take a long drink,then changed the subject.“Captain Lerner said that Lord Rahl was married.”“To a Confessor,” Sebastian confirmed. “If Richard Rahl was looking to find awife who was his match in evil, he found her.”“You know about her, then?”“Only the little I’ve heard from the emperor. I can tell you what I know, if youwant.”Jennsen nodded. With a finger and thumb, she pulled some more salt pork off oneof the long sticks, eating while she watched the firelight dance in his eyes ashe spoke.“The barrier between the Old World to the south and the New World to the northstood for thousands of years-until Lord Rahl destroyed it so that he mightconquer our people. Probably not long before your mother would have been born, Ithink, the New World was itself divided up into three lands. To the far west wasWestland. D’Hara is to the east. After killing his father and seizing rule,Richard Rahl destroyed these boundaries separating the three lands of the NewWorld.“Between Westland and D’Hara is the Midlands, an evil place where magic is saidto hold sway and where the Confessors live. The Midlands is ruled by the MotherConfessor herself. Emperor Jagang told me that, while she is young, maybe myage, she is as smart as she is deadly.”Jennsen was given pause by his chilling words. “Do you know what a Confessor is?What ‘Confessor’ means?”Holding the waterskin, Sebastian draped a forearm over his bent knee. “I don’tknow, except that she’s gifted with frightening power. Her mere touch burns awaya man’s mind, making him into her mindless slave.”Jennsen listened, rapt, appalled by such a notion. “And they really do anythingshe says-simply because she touched them?”Sebastian handed her the waterskin. “Touched them with her evil magic. EmperorJagang told me that her magic is so powerful that if she tells a man so enslavedthat she wants him to die on the spot, he will do so.”“You mean ... he would kill himself right before her eyes?”“No. I mean he would simply drop dead because she commanded it. His heart wouldstop, or something. He would just drop dead.”Shaken by the very idea, Jennsen set the waterskin aside. She drew her blanketup around herself. She was exhausted, and she was weary of learning new thingsabout Lord Rahl. Every time she learned something new, it was more terrible thanthe last thing. Her monster half brother, after he had killed their father,seemed to have wasted no time in assuming the family duty of hunting her.After they’d eaten and seen to the horses, Jennsen curled up under a blanket andher cloak. She wished she could go to sleep and wake to find it had all been abad dream. She almost wished she would never wake to have to face the future.Because they had a fire, Sebastian didn’t sleep with his back to hers. Shemissed the comfort of that. With anguishing thoughts cascading through her mind,she stared into the flames, eyes wide open, as Sebastian fell asleep.Jennsen wondered what she could do, now. Her mother was dead, so she had no realhome. Home had been with her mother, wherever they were. She wondered if hermother was watching her from the world of the dead, along with all the othergood spirits. She hoped her mother was at peace, and had happiness at last.Jennsen felt an empty, desolate sorrow for Althea. There could be no help fromthe sorceress, and none wanted. Jennsen felt shame at the trouble she hadbrought to others who tried to help her. Her mother had died for the crime ofgiving birth to Jennsen. Althea’s sister, Lathea, had been murdered by Jennsen’srelentless hunters. Poor Althea was stuck forever in that awful swamp for thecrime of trying to protect Jennsen when she had been but a child. Friedrich wasalmost as much a prisoner as Althea, his life robbed of many joys.Jennsen remembered the thrill of Sebastian’s kiss. Althea and Friedrich had lostthe pleasure of sharing passion. It was as if there had been that kiss forJennsen, the awakening discovery, the spark of possibility, and then there couldbe no more, ever. She was in her own kind of swamp, also a prison of Lord Rahl’smaking, trapped in the endless flight from killers.She thought about what Sebastian had said, that she would never be free untilshe eliminated Richard Rahl.Jennsen watched Sebastian as he slept. He had come unexpectedly into her life.He had saved her life. She could never have imagined, the first time she sawhim, or the first night when she looked up into his eyes from across the fireafter she had drawn the Grace at the cave entrance, that he would one day end upkissing her.His spikes of white hair had a soft golden glow from the firelight. His face wassuch a pleasure for her.What more was there for them? She didn’t know the answer to that. She didn’tknow what that kiss had meant, or where it could lead them, if anywhere. Shewasn’t sure she wanted it to. She wasn’t sure he did. She feared he didn’t."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32The more open ground closer to the plains was soon behind them, and they began adifficult journey through deepening snow and rugged terrain taking them slowlybut inexorably up into mountainous country. Sebastian had agreed to take herwhere she wanted to go, to the Old World. There, she hoped to be safe, to befree, for the first time in her life. Without Sebastian, such a dream would noteven have been possible.He told her that the rugged range of mountains they were entering, along withtheir vast tracks of forests, skirted the western edge of D’Hara, safely out ofthe way of most people, and would eventually lead them down toward the OldWorld. As they entered the sheltering solitude among the shadows of the toweringpeaks, they finally began to work their way more to the south, following themountains toward a distant liberty.The weather was brutal in the mountains. For several days they had to walk, lestthey kill the poor horses. Rusty and Pete were hungry, and the heavy snow covermade it difficult for them to get at any vegetation. Their thick winter coatswere getting mangy. At least they were still sound, if weak. The same could besaid for her and Sebastian.As the heavy overcast darkened ominously and a light snow began to fall late oneafternoon, they were fortunate to find a small village. They spent the nightthere, letting the horses stay in the small stable, where they had good oats andclean bedding. There was no inn in the town. Sebastian and Jennsen paid a fewcopper pennies to sleep in the hayloft. After having been out in the open solong, Jennsen felt it was a palace.The morning brought a storm with wind and snow, but even worse, the snow wasinterspersed with a heavy wet sleet that came in gales. Traveling in suchconditions would be not only miserable, but dangerous. She was glad, especiallyfor the horses, that it kept them at the stable an extra day and another night.The horses ate and rested while Sebastian and Jennsen told each otherlighthearted stories from their youth. She loved to see the gleam in his eyeswhen he told her some of his misadventures of fishing as a boy. The next daydawned blue, but with a wind. Still, they dared not linger longer.They made their way along roads or trails, since people were few and farbetween. Sebastian was ever cautious, but quietly confident that they would besafe enough. With the ever-present comfort of the knife at her belt, Jennsen,too, felt that it was better to risk the roads and trails rather than attempt tostrike out across remote and unknown territory covered in a thick blanket ofsnow. Traveling cross-country was always difficult, from time to time dangerous,and with the barrier of towering mountains all about, frequently impossible.Winter only made such travel all the more difficult, but worse, hid perilslurking beneath the snow. They feared to have a horse break a leg attempting itneedlessly.That night, as she started building them a shelter by loosely weaving together adozen saplings and covering them with balsam boughs, Sebastian stumbled back totheir camp, panting from effort. His hands were slick with blood.“Soldier,” he said, trying to catch his breath.Jennsen knew what soldiers he meant. “But how could they have followed us? Howcould they!”Sebastian looked away from her fury, her frantic demand. “It’s Lord Rahl’sgifted chasing us.” He pulled a deep breath. “Wizard Nathan Rahl saw you, backat the palace.”That made no sense. She was a hole in the world to the gifted. How could anygifted follow a hole in the world?He saw her dubious expression. “Not too hard to track through snow.”Snow. Of course. She nodded in resignation, her fury turning to fear. “One ofthe quad?”“I’m not sure. It was a D’Haran soldier. He came out of nowhere at me. I had tofight for my life. I killed him, but we must hurry and get out of here in casethere were others nearby.”She was too frightened to argue. They had to keep moving. The thought of mencoming out of the darkness at them lent swiftness to her actions as they saddledthe horses. They were quickly mounted and soon riding hard while there was stillenough light to see by. They had to dismount, then, and walk to let the horsesrest. Sebastian was sure they would have put distance on anyone after them. Thesnow helped them see, so that, even with clouds scudding past a partial moon,they were able to follow the road.By the next night, they were so exhausted that they had to stop, even at therisk of being captured. They slept sitting up, leaning together before a smallfire with their backs to a deadfall.They made slow but steady progress in the days following and saw no sign ofanyone following them. Jennsen took little comfort in that. She knew that theywould not give up.A stretch of sunny days allowed them to make good time. It was no comfort to herbecause they left clear tracks and the soldiers pursuing them would be able tomake equally good time. They stayed to roads that had been traveled, wheneverthey came across them, so as to throw off and delay anyone who followed.But then the storms returned. They pushed onward for five days despitenear-blizzard conditions. As long as they could see the paths and narrow roads,and were able to put one foot in front of the other, they couldn’t afford tostop, because the wind and snow covered their tracks almost as soon as they madethem. Jennsen had spent enough of her life outdoors to know that tracking themwould be impossible in such conditions. It was their first real hope of slippingthe noose from their necks.They selected roads or trails randomly. Each time they came to a crossroads orfork, Jennsen was relieved to see it, because it meant another chance for theirpursuers to choose wrong. Several times they cut crosscountry, the drifting snowmaking it impossible for anyone to know where they had gone. Despite how wearyshe was, Jennsen began to breathe easier.It was exhausting traveling in such conditions and it seemed like the foulweather would never relent, but then it did. Late in the afternoon, as the windfinally died, allowing the quiet of winter to settle back in, they came across awoman struggling along one of the roads. As they rode up behind her, Jennsen sawthat the woman was carrying something heavy.Even though the weather had begun to break, fat snowflakes still drifted in theair. Sun shone through an orange slash in the clouds, lending the gray day apeculiar gilding.The woman heard them coming and stepped aside. As they reached her, she held onearm up.“Help me, please?”It looked to Jennsen like the woman was carrying a small child all bundled up inblankets.By the look on Sebastian’s face, Jennsen feared that he intended to pass on by.He would say that they couldn’t stop when they had killers and maybe even WizardRahl at their heels. Jennsen felt confident that, for the time being at least,they had succeeded in slipping away from their hunters.When Sebastian cast her a sidelong glance, she spoke softly before he had achance to say anything. “Looks like the Creator has provided for this needywoman by sending us to help her.”Whether Sebastian was convinced by her words, or dared not challenge theCreator’s intentions, Jennsen didn’t know, but he drew his horse around to ahalt. As he dismounted and took the reins to both horses, Jennsen slid down offRusty. She struggled through heavy knee-deep snow to reach the woman.She held out her bundle, apparently hoping it would explain everything. Shelooked as if she were ready to accept help from the Keeper himself. Jennsen drewback the flap of bleached wool blanket and saw a boy, maybe three or four, witha blotchy red face. He was still. His eyes were closed. He was burning up withfever.Jennsen lifted the burden from the woman’s arms. The woman, about Jennsen’s age,looked exhausted. She hovered close, worry creasing her face.“I don’t know what’s taken him,” the woman said, on the verge of tears. “He justcame down sick.”“Why are you out here in the weather?” Sebastian asked.“My husband went off hunting two days ago. I don’t expect him back for severaldays more. I couldn’t just wait there with no help.”“But what are you doing out here?” Jennsen asked. “Where are you going?”“To the Raug’Moss.”“The what?” Sebastian asked at Jennsen’s back.“Healers,” Jennsen whispered to him.The woman’s fingers traced their way along her boy’s cheek. Her eyes rarely lefthis little face, but she finally looked up.“Can you help me get him there? I fear he’s getting worse.”“I don’t know if we-”“How far are they?” Jennsen asked, cutting Sebastian off.The woman pointed down the road. “That way, the way you’re going. Not far.”“How far?” Sebastian asked.The woman, for the first time, began to weep. “I don’t know. I had hoped to makeit by tonight, but it will be dark before long. I fear it’s farther than I canmanage. Please, help me?”Jennsen rocked the sleeping boy in her arms as she smiled at the woman. “Ofcourse we’ll help you.”The woman’s fingers clutched Jennsen’s ann. “I’m sorry to trouble you. ““Hush, now. A ride is no trouble.”“We can’t leave you out here with a sick child,” Sebastian agreed. “We’ll takeyou to the healers.”“Let me get up on my horse, and then hand your boy up to me,” Jennsen said asshe returned the child to his mother’s arms.Once mounted, Jennsen stretched her arms down. The woman hesitated, fearing topart with her child, but then quickly handed him up. Jennsen settled thesleeping boy in her lap, making sure he was well balanced and secure, asSebastian clasped arms with the woman and helped lift her up behind him. As theystarted out, the woman held Sebastian tight around the waist, but her eyes wereon Jennsen and the boy.Jennsen took the lead to give the woman the assurance of being able to see thestranger who now held her baby, and her hopes. She urged Rusty ahead through thedeep snow, worried that the child was not really sleeping, but unconscious withfever.The wind billowed snow around them as they raced along the road in the fadinglight. Concern for the boy, wanting to get him to help, made the road seemedendless. Each rise revealed only more forest ahead, each curve in the road yetanother sweep of empty woods. Jennsen was concerned, too, that their horsescouldn’t be pushed so hard through deep snow without a rest or they would drop.Sooner or later, despite the fading light, they would have to slow to give thestruggling horses a rest.Jennsen looked back over her shoulder when Sebastian whistled.“That way,” the woman called, gesturing toward a cutoff to a smaller trail.Jennsen urged Rusty to the right, up the trail. It rose abruptly, switching backand forth to ascend the sharp rise. The trees on the mountainside were huge,with trunks as big around as her horse, rising to a great height before branchesspread overhead to close off the leaden sky. The snow was unbroken by anyonebefore them, but the lay of the trail, the dish in the surface of the snow, theundulating but smooth line it took up through the forest, among rocks andsnow-crusted brush, and the way it followed beneath steep overhangs of rock walland along ledges made it easy enough to follow.Jennsen checked the boy asleep at her lap and found him the same. She watchedthe forest around them for any sign of people, but saw none. After being at thepalace, in Althea’s swamp, and out on the Azrith Plains, it was comforting toagain be in the forest. Sebastian didn’t especially like the woods. He didn’tlike the snow, either, but she found it peaceful the way the snow lent the woodsa sacred silence.The smell of woodsmoke hanging in the air told her that they were close. A lookover her shoulder at the mother’s face told her the same. Breaking over the topof a ridge revealed several small wooden buildings along a gently rising woodedslope. In a clearing behind was a small barn with a fenced paddock. A horse atthe fence rail, its ears alert, watched them approaching. The horse lifted itshead, tossing a whinny their way. Rusty and Pete both snorted a brief greetingin return.Jennsen put two fingers between her teeth and whistled as Rusty plowed throughthe drifts toward the small cabin at the upper end, the only one with smokerising from the chimney.The door opened as she reached the building. A man threw on a flaxen cloak onhis way out to greet them. He wasn’t old. He could be the right age. He pulledup the cloak’s broad hood against the cold before she could get a good look athis face.“We have a sick boy,” Jennsen said as the man took hold of Rusty’s reins. “Areyou one of the healers known as the Raug’Moss?”The man nodded. “Bring him inside.”The mother had already slid down off Sebastian’s horse and was standing besideJennsen to receive her boy into her waiting arms. “Thank the Creator you’rehere, today.”The healer, laying a reassuring hand on the woman’s back, urging her toward thedoor, tilted his head in gesture to Sebastian. “You’re welcome to put yourhorses in the back with mine and then come inside.”Sebastian thanked him and led the horses away while Jennsen followed the othertwo toward the door. In the failing light, she still hadn’t been able to get agood look at the man’s face.It was too much to hope, she knew, but at the very least, this man was aRaug’Moss and could answer her question."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33Inside the cabin, a large hearth made of rounded rocks took up most of the wallto the right. Crude burlap curtains hung to the sides of the two doorways torear rooms. A rough-hewn mantel held a lamp, as did the plank tabletop, neitherlamp lit. Oak logs crackled and popped in the hearth, lending the room a smokybut inviting aroma, as well as the soft flicker of firelight. An iron arm, blackwith soot, held a lidded kettle off to the side of the fire. After so long outin the weather, Jennsen felt it was almost too hot inside.The healer laid the boy on one of several pallets along the wall opposite thehearth. The mother knelt on one knee, watching as he drew back the folds of theblanket. Jennsen left them to examine the child as she casually checked theplace, making sure there were no surprises lurking. There hadn’t been anychimney smoke coming from the other cabins, and she hadn’t seen any tracksthrough the fresh snow, but that didn’t mean there couldn’t be people in thoseother cabins.Jennsen moved across the room, past the trestle table in the center, to warm herhands at the hearth. It gave her the chance to cast a glance into the two roomsat the rear. Each was tiny, with a sleeping pallet and a few items of clothinghanging on pegs. There was no one else in the place. Between the doorways stoodsimple pine cabinets.As Jennsen held her hands up before the heat of the fire and the boy’s mothersang him soft songs, the healer hurried to the cabinet and pulled out a numberof clay jars.“Bring a flame for the lamp, please?” he asked as he set his armload of items onthe table.Jennsen pried a long splinter from one of the logs stacked to the side, thenheld it in the wavering flames until it caught. While she lit the lamp and thenreplaced the tall glass chimney, he took pinches of fine powders from several ofthe jars and added them to a white cup.“How is the boy?” she asked in a whisper.He glanced across the room. “Not good.”“What can I do to help?” Jennsen asked after she had adjusted the wick.He wiggled the stopper from ajar. “Well, if you wouldn’t mind, bring over themortar and pestle from the center cupboard.”Jennsen retrieved the heavy gray stone mortar and pestle for him and set it onthe table beside the lamp. He was adding a mustard-colored powder to the cup. Sointent was he on his task that he hadn’t removed his cloak, but when he pushedthe hood back out of his way she could finally get a good took at him.His face didn’t rivet her, the way Wizard Rahl’s so unexpectedly had. She sawnothing in this man’s round eyes, straight brow, or the pleasant enough line ofhis mouth that looked at all familiar to her. He gestured to a bottle made ofwavy green glass.“If you would, could you please grind one of those for me?”While he hurried to the corner to lift a brown crockery pot down from a highshelf, Jennsen unfastened the wire hold-down and removed the glass lid from thejar. She was astonished to see the strangest little things inside. It was theshape that so surprised her. She turned one over with a finger. It was dark,flat, and round. She could see by the light of the lamp that it was somethingthat had been dried. She jiggled the jar. They all looked the same-like ajarfull of little Graces.Just like the magical symbol, these things had an outer circle, parts thatsuggested a square inside that, and a smaller circle inside the square.Overlaying it all, tying it together, was another structure rather like a fatstar. While not exactly a Grace, the way she had always seen it drawn, it bore aremarkable resemblance.“What is this?” she asked.The healer cast off his cloak and pushed up the sleeves of his simple robes.“Part of a flower-the dried base of the filament from a mountain fever rose.Pretty little things, they are. I’m sure you must have seen them before. Theycome in a variety of colors, depending on where they grow, but they’re bestknown for the common blush color. Hasn’t your husband ever brought you a nosegayof mountain fever roses?”Jennsen felt her face flush. “He’s not-we’re just traveling together. We’refriends, is all.”“Oh,” he said, sounding neither surprised nor curious. He pointed. “See there?The petals are attached to it here, and here. When the petals and stamen areremoved and this selected part of the head is dried, they end up looking likethis.”Jennsen smiled. “It looks like a little Grace.”He nodded, returning her smile. “And like the Grace, it can be beneficial, butit can also be deadly.”“How is it possible to be both beneficial and deadly?”“One of those dried flower heads, ground up and added to this drink, will helpthe boy sleep deeply so he can fight off the fever, help drive it from him. Morethan one, though, actually causes fever.”“Really?”Looking as if he had anticipated her question, he held up a finger as he leanedcloser. “If you were to take two dozen, thirty for certain, there would be nocure. Such a fever is swiftly fatal. It’s for this effect that the plant isnamed.” He showed her a sly smile. “In many ways an apt name for a flower soassociated with love.”“I suppose,” she said, thinking it over. “But if you ate more than one, but lessthan a couple dozen, would you still die?”“If you were foolish enough to crush up ten or twelve and add them to your tea,you would come down with a fever.”“And then you would eventually die, just as if you ate more?” -He smiled at the earnest concern on her face. “No. If you ate that many, itwould cause a mild fever. In a day or two you would be over it.”Jennsen peered carefully in at the whole collection of the deadly littleGrace-like things and then set down the jar.“It’s not going to harm you to touch one,” he said, seeing her reaction to thejarful. “You’d have to eat them to be affected. Even then, as I said, one inconjunction with other things will help the boy’s fever.”Jennsen smiled her embarrassment and reached in with two fingers to retrieveone. She dropped it in the bottom of the mortar, where it looked like nothing somuch as a Grace.“If it was for an adult who was awake, I’d just crush it between my thumb andfinger,” the healer said as he drizzled honey into the cup, “but he’s little andasleep besides. I need to get him to drink it down easily, so grind it to adust.”When he was finished, he added the dark dust of the little fever rose flowerhead Jennsen had crushed for him. Like the Grace it resembled, it could belifesaving, or lethal.She wondered what Sebastian would think of such a thing. She wondered if BrotherNarev would want such mountain fever roses eradicated because they couldpotentially be lethal.Jennsen put away the jars for the healer while he took the honeyed drink to theboy. Along with the mother’s help, they put the cup to his little lips andgently worked at getting him to drink. Drop by precious drop, they coaxed thesleeping boy to suckle and swallow each little bit they dribbled into his mouth.They weren’t able to rouse him, so they had to drip it into his mouth a littleat a time, waiting until he swallowed as he slept, then urge him to drink alittle more.While they worked, Sebastian returned from the barn. Before he closed the door,she saw stars outside. A wave of cold air rolled past her legs, sending a shiverthrough her shoulders. When the wind died like this as the sky cleared, it oftenmeant a bone-chilling cold night.Sebastian made for the fire, eager to warm himself. Jennsen put another log on,using the poker to position it askew so it would catch well. The healer, hishand lying gently on the woman’s shoulder, nodded his assurance to her as sheslowly gave the drink to her sick child. He left her to do the work, and, afterhanging his cloak on a hook just inside the door closest to the hearth, joinedJennsen and Sebastian at the fire.“Are this woman and child kin?” he said.“No,” Jennsen said. With the warmth of the fire, she removed her cloak, too, andlaid it over the bench at the table. “We saw her on the road, and she neededhelp. We just gave her a ride here.”“Ah,” he said. “She will be welcome to sleep here with her boy. I need to keepmy eye on him through the night.” She had forgotten about the singular nature ofthe knife she wore at her belt until he noticed it. “Please,” he said, “helpyourself to the stew I have cooking; we always have plenty at hand for those whomay come here. It’s late to be traveling. You both are welcome to use the cabinsfor the night. They’re all empty at present, so you may each have your own forthe night.”“That would be a kindness,” Sebastian said. “Thank you.”Jennsen was about to say that they could share one cabin, when she realized thathe had said that because she had told him that Sebastian wasn’t her husband. Sherealized how it would look if she said anything to change the plan, so shedidn’t.Besides, the idea of sleeping with Sebastian outdoors was only natural andinnocent enough. Together in a cabin seemed somehow different. She recalled thatseveral times on their long journey north to the People’s Palace they had takenshelter at inns. But that was before he had kissed her.Jennsen gestured to include the general area. “Is this the place of theRaug’Moss?”He smiled at her question, as if he found it amusing but didn’t want to mock herignorance. “By no means. This is just one of several small outposts we use whenwe travel-shelter-and a place where people who need our services can come tous.”“The boy is lucky you were here, then,” Sebastian said.The Raug’Moss studied Sebastian’s eyes for a moment. “If he lives, I will bepleased that I was here to help him. We frequently have a brother at thisstation.”“Why is that?” Jennsen asked.“Outposts such as this help provide the Raug’Moss with income from serving theneeds of people with no other access to healers.”“Income?” Jennsen asked. “I thought that the Raug’Moss helped people out ofcharity, not for profit.”“The stew, the hearth, the roof we offer, they do not appear magically becausethere is a need. People who come to us for the knowledge we’ve spent a lifetimeacquiring are expected to contribute something in exchange for that help. Afterall, if we starve to death, how can we then help anyone else? Charity, if youhave the means, is a personal choice, but charity which is expected or compelledis simply a polite word for slavery.”The healer hadn’t been speaking about her, of course, but Jennsen still feltstung by his words. Had she always expected others to help her, feeling entitledto their help simply because she wanted it? As if her wish for their assistancetook precedence over the best interest of their own lives?Sebastian fished around in a pocket, coming up with a silver mark. He held itout to the man. “We would like to share what we have in return for your sharingwhat you have.”After the briefest of glances at Jennsen’s knife, he said, “In your case, thatisn’t necessary.”“We insist,” Jennsen said, feeling uncomfortable knowing that this money wasn’teven really hers, something she had earned in exchange for the food, shelter,and care of their horses, but was taken from dead men.With a bow of his head, he accepted the payment. “There are bowls in thecupboard on the right. Please help yourselves. I must tend to the boy.”Jennsen and Sebastian sat on a bench at the trestle table and ate two bowls eachof the hearty lamb stew from the big kettle. It was the best meal they had hadsince-since the meat pies Tom had left for them.“This turned out to our advantage,” Sebastian said in a low voice.Jennsen glanced to the side of the room to see the healer and the mother bentover the boy. She leaned closer as he stirred a spoon through his stew.“How so?”His blue eyes turned up to her. “Gives the horses good feed and a good rest. Ustoo. That gives us an advantage over anyone chasing us.”“Do you really think they could have any idea where we are? Or even be close?”Sebastian shrugged as he ate more of his stew. He checked across the room beforehe spoke. “I can’t see how they could, but they’ve surprised us before, haven’tthey?”Jennsen admitted the truth of it with a nod and went back to eating her own mealin silence.“Anyway,” he said, “this gives us and the horses needed food and rest. It canonly help us put more distance on them. I’m glad that you reminded me of how theCreator helps those in need.”Jennsen was warmed by his smile. “I hope it helps that poor boy.”“Me too,” he said.“I’m going to clean up and see if they need any help.”He nodded as he scooped up the last piece of lamb into his spoon. “You take thenext to last cabin. I’ll take the one after, on the end. I’ll go start you afire first while you finish up, here.”After he put his spoon in his empty bowl, Jennsen put a hand over his. “Sleepwell.”She basked in his private smile for her and then watched as he whispered to thehealer. By the man’s nod, she guessed that Sebastian had thanked him and wishedhim a good night. The mother, sitting beside her boy, stroking his brow, alsothanked Sebastian for the help, and hardly noticed the icy air that rushed in ashe went out the door.Jennsen carried a steaming bowl of stew over to the woman. She accepted itpolitely, but absently, her attention on her small worry asleep at her hip. AtJennsen’s urging, the healer sighed in agreement and sat at the table while sheserved him a bowl of his stew.“Quite good, even if I made it,” he said with good humor as she brought him amug of water.Jennsen chuckled, assuring him that she shared his conviction. She let him eat,occupying herself with cleaning the dirty bowls in a wooden wash bucket and thenadding several logs to the fire. The burning logs shot showers of sparks. Oakmade a good fire, but it was messy without a screen. As she arranged the logs,sparks anew swirled up the chimney amid billowing smoke. With a broom from thecorner, she swept the dead ashes back into the hearth.When she saw that the healer was nearly finished with his meal, she sat on thebench, close to him, so that she could speak privately. “We must be leavingearly, so in case I miss you in the morning, I wanted to thank you for all yourhelp this evening, not only for the boy, but for us as well.”Although he didn’t look down, she knew by the expression on his face that heinterpreted her need to be away early as having to do with the knife at herbelt. She said nothing to dissuade that notion.“We appreciate the generous contribution to our sect. It will help in ourefforts to help our people.”Jennsen knew he was just marking time until she said what was really on hermind, so she finally did. “I would like to inquire about a man that I’ve learnedis living with the Raug’Moss. He may even be a healer, I’m not sure. I’d like toknow if you know anything about him.”He shrugged. “Ask. I will tell you what I know.”“His name is Drefan.”For the first time that night, the man’s eyes revealed the fire of emotion.“Drefan was the evil spawn of Darken Rahl.”Jennsen had to force herself not to show any reaction at the power of his words.She reminded herself that he had seen her knife with the symbol of the House ofRahl, and that might be coloring his words. Still, he sounded emphatic.“I know that much. I still need very much to find him.”“You’re too late.” A satisfied smile ghosted across his face. “ ‘Master Rahlprotect us,’ ” he quoted from the devotion.“I don’t understand.”“Lord Rahl, the new Lord Rahl, killed him-spared us all from that bastard son ofDarken Rahl.”Jennsen.Jennsen sat stunned, feeling almost as unseen talons were coming out of a darksky toward her throat.“You’re sure” was all she could think to say. “I mean, you’re sure that LordRahl was the one who did it.”“While there were polite words spoken about Drefan’s death, about how he haddied in service of the people of D’Hara, I believe, as do the rest of theRaug’Moss, that Lord Rahl killed Drefan.”Jennsen.Polite words. Polite words for murder. Jennsen imagined that one did not justcome right out and call it murder to Lord Rahl’s face. Ordinary people weremurdered. Lord Rahl’s victims died in service to the people of D’Hara.Jennsen felt her chest tightening at the fright of Lord Rahl being one murdercloser to her. Darken Rahl had not found Drefan. Richard Rahl had. Richard Rahlwould find her, too.She gripped her trembling hands together in her lap, under the table. She hopedher face didn’t show anything. This man was obviously loyal to the Lord Rahl.She dared not reveal her true revulsion, her true terror.Surrender.Her true anger.Surrender.That single word echoed around in her head behind the tumbling thoughts, herfrustration, her hopeless gloom, her burgeoning anger."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34Jennsen sat alone on the floor before the robust fire Sebastian had made forher, staring into the flames, her unblinking gaze absently fixed on the glowingyellow-orange coals that now and again dropped from the checkering logs. Sheonly dimly recalled the farewells to the healer and the boy’s mother. She washardly aware of the slow shuffle through the snow and cold that had gotten herto the empty cabin.She didn’t know how long she sat there, staring at nothing, as somber thoughtsglided unceasingly through her mind. In his unrelenting effort to get to her,Richard Rahl had taken Jennsen’s mother from her, leaving her with no sense offamily or home. Jennsen missed her mother to the marrow of her bones, missed herso much that the agony seemed unendurable, yet she had no choice but to endureit. There were no tears left. At times, even the pain of the loss seemed to growdistant.Ever since Althea had told her about Drefan, Jennsen had thought that if shecould find this other child of Darken Rahl, her half brother, a hole in theworld like her, she might find strength through that connection. She thoughtthat they might possibly have a sense of kinship and, in their common struggle,together come up with a solution to their shared station in life. Whether or notany of that might have come to pass, she would never know, now.It had been her hope that it would. That hope was dead. Richard Rahl had killedDrefan. Richard Rahl would surely kill her when he found her. And he would findher. She knew that, now. Really knew it. He would find her.Jennsen.A mad torrent of thoughts cascaded through her mind, everything from hope todespair, terror to rage.Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht.The voice, too, was there, beyond the churning thoughts, beyond the turmoil ofemotions, beyond the jumble of disorder, whispering to her in those strangelyseductive words.In the end, all other thoughts melted away in the glowing heat of her anger.Jennsen. Surrender.She had tried everything else. She had no options left. The Lord Rahl had cuther off from any other hope. She had no choice.She knew what she had to do, now.Jennsen rose up, feeling the strange sensation of inner peace at having made thedecision. She threw her cloak around her shoulders and marched out into thestill, frigid, quiet night. The air was so cold that it hurt to breathe it. Thesnow crunched as she made her way through the fresh tracks.Shivering with the cold, or maybe the enormity of what she had decided, sheknocked gently on the door to the last cabin. Sebastian pulled the door inenough to see it was her, and then, quickly, opened it to admit her. She hurriedin though the opening, into the firelight and cocoon of warmth. Delicious heatembraced her.Sebastian was without a shirt. By his clean scent and the towel thrown over hisshoulder, she realized that she must have caught him at the washbowl. He hadprobably filled a washbowl in her cabin, too, though she hadn’t noticed.Concern creased Sebastian’s brow as he stood, posture tense, waiting to see whathad brought her there. Jennsen stepped up close to him, so close that she couldfeel the heat of him. Fists at her sides, she met his eyes boldly.“I intend to kill Richard Rahl.”He studied her face, accepting her determined words calmly, as if he had knownall along that she would someday come to see the inescapable need. He remainedsilent, waiting to hear the rest of what she had to say.“I know, now, that you were right,” she said. “I have to eliminate him or I’llnever be safe. I’ll never be free to live my own life. I’m the only one to doit-the one who must do it.”She didn’t tell him why it had to be her.His hand came up to grip her upper arm. His intense gaze never left hers. “Itwill be difficult getting near such a man in order to do as you must. I’ve toldyou that we have sorceresses with the emperor, sorceresses fighting to end thereign of Lord Rahl. Let me take you to them, first.”Jennsen had been focused on the decision rather than the details of how to goabout it. She had given no thought to the approach or dealing with all thelayers of people who would be protecting him. She would have to get in closeenough for the killing itself. She had only pictured in her mind hitting himwith her fist clutching her knife, yelling at him, screaming how much she hatedhim, how much she wanted him to suffer for all he had done. She had only fixedon the deed, not on how she would come to be standing that close before him.There were practical matters she needed to take into account if she was tosucceed.“Do you think these women could help me with what you said-magic used to endmagic. Do you think they might be able to provide me with the means to go afterhim?”Sebastian nodded. “I wouldn’t suggest it if I didn’t. I know the destructivepower of the magic on Lord Rahl’s side-I’ve seen it with my own eyes-and I knowhow our sorceresses have been able to help us fight back. Magic can’t do it all,but I think they can provide valuable help.”Jennsen held herself erect, her chin up. “I would appreciate it. I will gladlyaccept any assistance they can offer.”A small smile curved the line of his mouth.“But know this,” she added. “With or without their help, I intend to killRichard Rahl. If I must go alone and bare-handed, I intend to kill him. I willnot rest until I do, because I have no life until I kill him-by his choice, notmine. I’m at the end of running. I will run no more.”“I understand. I will take you to our sorceresses, then.”“How far do you think it is to the Old World? Until we can reach them?”“We won’t be going to the Old World for now. In the morning we’ll need to startlooking for a pass to the west, over the mountains. We have to begin looking fora way into the Midlands.”Jennsen pulled a ringlet of her hair back off her face when she noticed himlooking at it. “But, I thought that the emperor and the Sisters of the Lightwere in the Old World.”Sebastian’s expression twisted with a sly smile. “No. We cannot allow Lord Rahlto bring war to our people without answering his aggression, without making himpay a price. We intend to fight, and win-the same as you have finally decided.Emperor Jagang is with our troops, laying siege to their seat of rule in theMidlands, the city of Aydindril. That’s where the Confessors’ Palace is-LordRahl’s wife’s palace. We’re cleaving the New World. When spring arrives, we willtake Aydindril and break the back of the New World.”“I had no idea. Have you known all along that Emperor Jagang would try somethingso bold?”Sebastian half laughed. “I’m his strategist.”Jennsen’s jaw dropped. “You? You thought of it?”He dismissed her wide-eyed astonishment. “Emperor Jagang came to the rule of theOld World because he is a genius. He had two alternatives in this, two differentrecommendations-to attack the Midlands, or to attack D’Hara first. Brother Narevadvised that right is on our side, and that the Creator would grant us victoryeither way, so he had no preference, no military advice to offer.“The emperor himself already had the goal of Aydindril in mind, though he keptsilent on it until he heard the recommendations. My recommendation decided itfor him. Emperor Jagang does not always use my strategy, but I was pleased thatin this he saw what I saw-that taking the city and palace of Lord Rahl’s wifewould not only be a momentous military victory, but will also strike a greatblow at our enemy’s very heart. “Jennsen was seeing him again as she had at first, in awe at how important hetruly was. This was a man who, in part, directed the very course of history. Thefate of nations, and countless lives, hung on Sebastian’s word.“You don’t think the emperor may have taken the Confessor’s Palace by now?”“No,” he said with certainty. “We will not waste our brave men trying to takesuch an important objective until the weather is with us. We will seizeAydindril in the spring, when this wretched winter is over. I think we can yetreach them in time to be there for the great event.”Jennsen was enthralled by the very idea of seeing such a momentous event-theforces of a free people striking a mighty blow against Lord Rahl. At the sametime, she knew it meant the beginning of the end of D’Hara. But it really onlymeant the end of evil rule.In the crackling firelight, it seemed a remarkable night in more ways than one.The world was changing and she was going to be a part of it. She had changedthis night, too.The fire was warm on the side of her face. She realized that she had never seenSebastian without a shirt. She liked the sight.His other hand came up to gently grasp her other arm. “Emperor Jagang will liketo meet you.”“Me? But, I’m no one important.”“Oh, yes, Jennsen, Jagang the Just will be eager to meet you, I can promise youthat, to meet the brave woman who wishes to strike such a blow for ourcourageous people, for the future of a free mankind, and finally bring an end tothe scourge of the House of Rahl. For such an historic event as the taking ofAydindril and the Confessor’s Palace, Brother Narev himself intends to travel upfrom the Old World to witness the great victory on behalf of our people. I’msure he, too, would be most pleased to meet you.”“Brother Narev . .Jennsen thought about the sweep of events that, until now, she had no idea weretaking place. Now she was a part of those momentous events. She felt a kind ofthrill that she would meet Jagang the Just-a real emperor-and maybe even BrotherNarev, who Sebastian said was just about the most important spiritual leaderever to have lived.Without Sebastian, none of it would be possible. He was such a remarkableman--everything from his wonderful blue eyes and his exotic spikes of whitehair, to his handsome smile and extraordinary intellect.“Since you had a hand in planning the campaign, I’m happy that you’ll be thereto see your strategy triumph. I admit, too, that I would be honored to be in thepresence of such great and noble men.”Even though Sebastian seemed as modest as always, she still thought she saw aspark of pride in his eyes, but then he turned serious. “When we meet with theemperor, you mustn’t be alarmed by what you see.”“What do you mean?”“Emperor Jagang has been marked by the Creator with eyes that see more thanordinary men can see. Foolish people are frightened by his looks. I wanted toforewarn you. You mustn’t be frightened of such a great man simply because helooks different.”“I won’t be.”“It’s settled, then.”Jennsen grinned. “I agree to your new strategy. We can leave for the Midlands,the emperor, and the Sisters of the Light in the morning.”It seemed he hardly heard her. His gaze wandered her face, her hair, returningat last to her eyes.“You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met.”Jennsen felt his fingers tighten on her arms, pulling her closer. “You favor mewith such words,” she heard herself say. He was a trusted advisor to an emperor.She was just a girl who grew up in the woods. He influenced history; she simplyran from it. Until now.And yet, he was just Sebastian. A man she talked with, traveled with, ate with.She had seen him yawn from exhaustion and fall asleep countless times.He was a fascinating mix of nobility and commoner. He seemed to chafe at beingheld in awe, yet by his manner he seemed to court it, if not demand it.“I’m sorry at how inadequate those words sound,” he whispered, looking veryhumble. “I mean so much more than that you’re merely beautiful. ““You do?” Her words were more than a question. They were expectant wonder.Sebastian’s mouth met hers in a rush. His arms surrounded her. She held herhands out to the side, afraid to hug him because if she did she would have totouch his naked flesh. She stood in his arms, her own arms held out stiffly, herspine arched back under the press of him.His mouth felt luscious against hers. His arms did more than encircle her; theysheltered her. Her eyes closed as she sagged into his kiss. His whole body feltso hard against hers. His fist seized her hair at the nape of her neck, holdingher as he moaned against her lips, as his warm tongue unexpectedly filled hermouth. Jennsen’s head was spinning with the delicious sensations.The world seemed to be tipping, and she felt as if she were hanging in his arms.She felt the sudden press of the bedding against her. The shock of being on herback, with him atop her, had her suddenly confused and not knowing what to do orhow to react.She wanted to stop him before he went any further. At the same time, she fearedto do anything that would cause him to stop, to believe she was spurning him.It occurred to her how very alone they were. Such isolation worried her. Yet, itexcited her, too. With the two of them so completely alone, only she could stophim. The choices that she made not only decided her own path, but also held swayover Sebastian’s heart. It gave her a comforting sense of power.But it was just a kiss. More of a kiss than in the palace, but still, just akiss. A head-spinning, heart-pounding kiss.She surrendered herself into his embrace, daring to use her tongue as he didhis, and was exhilarated by his ardent response. She felt like a woman-adesirable woman. Her hands ran up the smooth skin of his back, feeling thelandscape of his bone and muscle, unhindered by a veil of cloth, feeling himflex as he pressed against her. She could hardly get her breath with the wonderof such feelings.“Jenn,” he whispered breathlessly into her ear, “I love you.”Jennsen was stunned speechless. It didn’t seem real. It felt like she had to bedreaming it, or living in someone else’s body. She knew she’d heard him say it,but it just didn’t seem real to her.Her heart was racing so fast that she feared it might burst. Sebastian’s breath,too, came in desperate pulls, as if his lust for her were driving him mad. Sheclung to him, eager to feel the warm breath of his words in her ear again.She feared to believe him, though, to allow herself to believe him, to know ifit was real, if this was really happening to her, or if she was only imaginingit.“But ... you can’t mean it.” Her words were a wall to protect her.“I do,” he panted. “I do. I can’t help myself. I love you, Jennsen.”His warm breath tickled her in a way that ran a scrumptious shiver up throughthe core of her.For some reason, the memory of Tom came into her mind. She saw him, in hermind’s eye, smiling at her in that way of his. This would not be Tom’s manner.She didn’t know how she knew that, but she did. Tom would not approach thesubject of love in this fashion.For some reason, she felt a stab of ache for Tom.“Sebastian-”“Tomorrow, we leave to carry out our destiny ......Jennsen nodded against his shoulder, marveling at how those words soundedsomehow passionate. Their destiny. She held on tight, feeling the slick warmthof his back, feeling him push himself against her leg, feeling his arm lyingacross her belly as his hand caressed her hip, in a way hoping he would saysomething to thrill her, to frighten her, at the same time praying he wouldn’t.“But this night is ours, Jenn, if you will only seize it.”Jennsen.“Sebastian-”“I love you, Jennsen. I love you.”Jennsen.She wished the image of Tom would leave her mind.“Sebastian, I don’t know what-”“I never wanted to. It wasn’t my intention to allow myself to feel this way, butI do. I love you, Jenn. I didn’t expect it. Dear Creator, I can’t help myself. Ilove you.”Her eyes closed as he kissed her neck. It felt so good feeling his intimatewhispers in her ear, a whisper that in a way sounded close to a painfulconfession, laced with regret, anger, yet thick with desperate hope.“I love you,” he whispered again.Jennsen.Jennsen shuddered with the pleasure of the sensation, with the pleasure offeeling like a woman, of knowing that her mere existence thrilled a man. She hadnever felt particularly attractive before. Right then, she felt more thanbeautiful-she felt seductively beautiful.Surrender.She kissed his neck as he shifted his weight. She kissed his ear and ran hertongue along it as he had done to her. His whole body felt afire.She froze when his hand slid up under her dress. His fingers glided over herbare knee, over her bare thigh. It was her choice to make, she told herself. Itwas.She gasped, eyes wide, staring up at the dark rafters. His mouth covered hersbefore she could say the word wanting to come out. Her fist pounded hisshoulder, once, in frustration at not being able to say that one, short,important word.She gripped his face to push him away, to allow her to say it. But this was theman who had saved her life. If not for him, she would have been killed alongwith her mother that rainy night. She owed him her very life. Letting him touchher in such a way was nothing in exchange for that. What harm was it? It was asmall thing compared to the way he had opened his heart to her.Besides, she cared for him. He was a man any woman would desire.He was handsome, smart, and important. Moreover, she was excited that he caredso for her. She was. What more could she want?She forcefully banished the unwanted image of Tom from her mind by focusing allher attention on Sebastian and what he was doing to her. His touch weakened herin a way that made her ache.His fingers felt so good that tears ran down her cheeks. She forgot the word,wondering why she would ever have wanted to say it.Her fingers clutched the back of his head, holding on for dear life. Her otherfist pressed against the sides of his ribs as she cried out at what he was doingto her. All she could do was pant as she squirmed, helpless, at the indecentdelight of it.“Sebastian-” she gasped. “Oh, Sebastian-”“I love you so much, Jenn.” He forced her knees farther apart. He pushed himselfbetween her trembling legs. “I need you, Jennsen. I need you so. I can’t livewithout you. I swear I can’t.”It was supposed to be her choice. She told herself that it was.“Sebastian-”Surrender.“Yes,” she breathed. “Dear spirits, forgive me, yes.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35Oba leaned a shoulder against the red-painted side of a wagon set back out ofthe way. Hands in his pockets, he casually surveyed the busy marketplace. Peoplecrowding among the open-air stands seemed in a festive mood, possibly because atlong last spring was nearly at hand, even if winter was not yet ready torelinquish its harsh grip. Despite the biting chill, people chatted andchuckled, bargained and bickered, purchased and perused.Little did the shuffling crowds braving the cold wind know that someoneimportant was among them. Oba grinned. A Rahl was among them. A member of theruling family.Since he had decided to become invincible, and over the course of his longjourney north, Oba had become a new man, a man of the world. At first, after thedeath of the troublesome sorceress and his lunatic mother, he was aswirl innewfound liberty, and hadn’t given any thought to coming to the People’s Palace,but the more he considered the pivotal events that had taken place and all thenew things he had learned, the more he had come to realize that the journey wasvital. There were still bits missing, bits that could lead to trouble.That Jennsen woman had said that quads hunted her. Quads only hunted importantpeople. Oba was concerned that they might turn to hunting him, too, since he wasimportant. Like Jennsen, he was also one of those holes in the world. Latheahadn’t explained to him what that meant, but it made Oba and Jennsen bothspecial in some way. It somehow linked them.It was possible that Lord Rahl had learned about Oba, maybe from the treacherousLathea, and he feared having a rightful rival who could challenge him. Oba was,after all, also a son of Darken Rahl. An equal, in many ways. Lord Rahl hadmagic, but Oba was invincible.With all the potential trouble brewing, Oba thought it best to look after hisown interests by traveling to his ancestral home to learn what he could.Even before he had decided to travel north, Oba had had his concerns. Still, heenjoyed his visits to new places, and had learned many new things. He kept listsof them in his head. Places, sights, people. Everything meant something. Inquiet moments he would go over those mental lists, seeing what things fittogether, what revelations he could divine. It was important to keep the mindactive, he always said. He was a man on his own, now, making his own decisions,choosing his own road, doing as he pleased, but he still had to learn and grow.But no more did Oba have to feed the animals, tend the garden, mend fences andbarns and houses. No longer did he have to haul and fetch and obey every foolishwhim of his lunatic mother. No more did he have to endure the troublesomesorceress’s loathsome cures, her furtive glances. No more did he have to listento his mother’s tirades, her taunts, or be subjected to her venomoushumiliation.To think, she had once had the gall to order him to pick away at a frozen moundof muck-him, the son of Darken Rahl himself. How Oba put up with it, he didn’tknow. He supposed that he was a man of remarkable patience, one of his manystellar traits.Since his maniacal mother had always been so harshly adamant that he never spendmoney on women, Oba had celebrated his freedom from her tyranny, once he reacheda good sized city, by visiting the most expensive whore he could find. Heunderstood, then, why his mother had always been so dead set against him beingwith women-it was enjoyable.He had found, though, that those women, too, could be cruel to a man of hissensitivity. They, too, would sometimes try to make him feel small andunimportant. They, too, would fix him with that calculating, callous,condescending gaze he so hated.Oba suspected that it was his mother’s fault. He suspected that even from theworld of the dead, she might still manage to reach into this world, through awhore’s cold heart, to vex him in his most triumphant moments. He suspected thather dead voice whispered vicious things in the women’s ears. It would be justlike her to do that; even in her eternal rest, she would not be content to lethim have any peace or satisfaction.Oba wasn’t a spendthrift-not by any means-but the money that had so rightly beenhis did bring him some well-deserved pleasures, like clean beds, good food anddrink, and the company of attractive women. He tended his money carefully,though, lest he end up without it. People, he knew, were only too covetous ofhis wealth.He had learned that just having money, though, brought him favors, especiallyfrom women. If he bought them drinks or small gifts-a pretty piece of cloth fora scarf, a trinket for their wrist, a shiny pin for their hair-they were morelikely to cozy up to him. They often took him somewhere quiet, where they couldbe alone with him. Sometimes it was an alley, sometimes it was a deserted wood,sometimes it was a room.He suspected that some of them just wanted to get at his money. Still, it neverfailed to amaze him what entertainment and satisfaction he could derive from awoman. Frequently with the aid of a sharp knife.Being a man of the world, Oba knew about women, now. He had been with many. Now,he knew how to talk to women, how to treat women, how to satisfy women.There were a number of women still waiting, hoping, praying he would one dayreturn to them. Several had even deserted their husbands, expecting they mightwin his heart.Women couldn’t resist him. They fawned over him, delighted over his looks,marveled at his strength, moaned at the way he pleasured them. They especiallyenjoyed it when he hurt them. Anyone less sensitive than he would fail torecognize their tears of joy for what they really were.While Oba enjoyed the company of women, he knew he could always have another, sohe didn’t become entangled in long love affairs. Most were brief. Some verybrief. For now, he had more important matters on his mind than women. Later, hewould have all the women he could ever want. Just like his father had.Now, at last, he could look upon the soaring stone splendor of his true home:the People’s Palace. Someday, it would be his. The voice had told him so.A hawker pushed in close beside him, disturbing Oba’s pleasant thoughts, hisimagining of what lay ahead for him.“Charms, for you, sir? Magic charms. Good luck for sure.”Oba frowned down at the hunched hawker. “What?”“Special charms with magic. Can’t go wrong for a silver penny.”“What do they do?”“Well, sir, the charms are magic, sure. Wouldn’t you like a bit of magic to easethe terrible struggles of life? Make things go your way for a change? Only asilver penny.”Things did go his way, now that his lunatic mother wasn’t around to pester himand keep him down. Still, Oba did like to learn new things.“What will this magic do? What kinds of things?”“Great things, sir. Great things. Give you strength, it will. Strength, andwisdom. Strength and wisdom beyond any normal mortal man.”Oba grinned. “I already have that.”The man was at a loss for words for only a moment. He looked over each shoulder,making sure no one was close before he leaned in closer, pushing against Oba’sside, in order to speak confidentially. He winked up at Oba.“These magic charms will help win the girls for you, sir.”“Women already can’t get enough of me.” Oba was losing interest. This magicpromised only what he already had. The man might as well say that the charmswould give Oba two arms and two legs.The filthy little man cleared his throat, thick with phlegm, as he leaned closeagain. “Well, sir, no man can have enough wealth or the most beautiful-”“I’ll give you a copper penny if you can tell me where I can find the sorceressAlthea.”The man’s breath stank. Oba pushed him back. The hawker lifted a crooked finger.His wiry eyebrows rose as well.“You, sir, are a wise man, just as you said. I knew I saw something keen aboutyou. You, sir, have ferreted out the one man in this market who can tell youwhat you need.” He thumped his chest. “Me. I can tell you all you need to knowon the subject. But, as a man of your wisdom will no doubt realize, such obscureand privileged information will of necessity cost you a great deal more than acopper penny. Yes, sir, a great deal more, and worth it.”Oba frowned. “How much more?”“A silver mark.”Oba grunted a laugh and started walking away. He had the money, but he didn’tappreciate being played for a fool.“I’ll ask around. Decent people can offer such simple help as directions to thesorceress and they will expect nothing more than a tip of my cap. “The hawker scurried along at Oba’s side, eager to renegotiate, speakinghurriedly as he struggled to keep up. Loose ends of his ragged outfit flappedlike flags in the breeze as he dodged people dodging Oba.“Yes, I can see you’re a wise man indeed. I’m afraid I’m no match for you, sir.You’ve bested me-that’s the simple truth of it. But there are more knottymatters you don’t know about, matters a man of your rare sensitivity shouldknow, things which could very well mean your safety in such a dangerous ventureas I think you may be about to undertake, things which not many folks can tellyou true.”Oba was sensitive, that much was true. He gazed down at the man shuffling alongsideways, like a dog begging for a scrap. “A silver penny, then. That’s all I’moffering.”“A silver penny, then,” he conceded with a sigh, “for the valuable informationyou need, sir, which I warrant you will hear nowhere else.”Oba halted, satisfied that the man had caved in to the superior intellect. Handson his hips, he stared down at the hopeful fellow licking his cracked lips. Itwas against Oba’s nature to part with money so easily, but he had plenty, andsomething about this intrigued him. He fished around in his pocket, slipping twofingers into the leather purse he kept there, and drew out a silver penny.He flipped it to the scruffy fellow. “All right, then.” As the man caught thecoin, Oba caught the hawker’s bony wrist. “I will give you the price you ask.But if I don’t think you’re telling it true, or if I suspect that you’re holdingback on me, I’ll take back the coin, and I’ll have to wipe your blood off itbefore I return it to my pocket.”The man swallowed at the dangerous look on Oba’s face. “Sir, I’d not cheatyou--especially not once my word is given.”“You’d best not. So, where is she? How can I find Althea?”“In a swamp, she lives. But I can tell you how to get in to her, for only-”“Do you think I’m a stupid oaf!” Oba twisted the wrist. “I’ve already heard thatpeople go to see this sorceress, that she receives visitors in her swamp, sosomething more than the way in to her place had better be included in the fairprice I’ve given you.”“Yes!” The hawker gulped in pain. “Of course it is.” Oba eased up. Stillwincing, the man was quick to go on. “I was going to say that I will tell youthe secret way to get to her through her swamp for the generous price you’vealready paid. Not just the regular way in, which folks know, but the secret wayin, as well. Few, if any, know of it. All included in the price. I’d not holdanything back from a fair man like you, sir.”Oba glared. “Secret way in? If there is a regular way, a way people use to seeAlthea, why would I care about this other way?”“People go in to see the sorceress Althea for a telling. She’s a powerful one,this sorceress.” He leaned closer. “But you must be invited before you can gosee her for a telling. None dare to go without being invited. People all go inthe same way, so as she can see them coming-after she’s invited them in andwithdrawn her bloodthirsty beasts that guard the path.” A sly smile spread onthe man’s twisty face. “It seems to me that if you were invited in, you wouldn’tneed to ask people how to get there. Have you been invited, sir?”Oba gently pushed the reeking hawker back. “So, there is another way in?”“There is. A back way in. A way to sneak up on her, if you’re of a mind, whileher beasts guard the front door, as it were. A smart man might not choose toapproach a powerful sorceress on her terms.”Oba glanced to the sides, checking that people weren’t listening. “I don’t needto go in a secret back way. I’m not afraid of the sorceress. But as long as I’vealready paid for it all, I’ll hear it all told. Both ways in, and everythingelse about her, too.”The man shrugged. “If you’re of a mind, you can simply ride due west, as thefolks who was invited to Althea’s place do. You travel west across the plainsuntil you come to the largest snowcapped mountain. Beyond the mountain, you turnnorth and follow along the base of the cliffs. The land goes lower until itfinally enters the swamp. Just follow the well-kept path on in through theswamp. Stay on that path-don’t wander off. It leads to the home of the sorceressAlthea.”“But the swamp would be frozen, this time of year.”“No, sir. This is the wicked place of a sorceress and her menacing magic.Althea’s swamp does not bow to winter.”Oba twisted the man’s wrist until he cried out. “Do you think me a fool? Noplace is a swamp in winter.”“Ask anyone!” the man squealed. He swept his other arm around. “Ask anyone andthey’ll tell you Althea’s place doesn’t bow to the Creator’s winter, but is hotand boggy all year round.”Oba let up on the man’s wrist. “You said there was a back way in. Where is it?”For the first time, the man hesitated. He licked his weather-cracked lips. “It’sdifficult to find. There are few landmarks, and they’re hard to spot. I couldtell you how to find the place, but you might miss it, and then you’ll think Ilied to you when it’s only that it’s tricky to find by directions alone ifyou’re not familiar with the land in these parts.”“I’m already thinking about having my coin back.”“I’m only looking to your safety, sir.” He flashed a quick, apologetic smile. “Idon’t like giving a man like you only part of what he needs, for fear I mightlive to regret it. I believe in giving the full measure of my word. ““Go on.”The hawker cleared his wet throat and then spat to the side. He wiped his mouthwith the back of his filthy sleeve. “Well, sir, the best way to find it is if Itake you there.”Oba checked an older couple passing nearby, then pulled the man by his wrist.“Fine. Let’s go.”The hawker dug in his heels. “Now hold on there. I agreed to tell you, and I cando that. Like I said, though, it’s hard to find. But I can’t be expected to giveup my business to go off as a guide. It’s a number of days I’d be away from anincome.”Scowling, Oba leaned down. “And how much is it you want to guide me there?”The man took a heavy breath as he considered, muttering to himself as if toilingat tallying up numbers in his head.“Well, sir,” he said at last, lifting a finger on his free hand that stuck upthrough a short stub of a knit glove. “I guess I could be gone for a few days ifI were to be paid a gold mark.”Oba laughed. “I’m not giving you a mark-gold nor even silver-for the work ofguiding me for a few days. I’d be willing to pay you another silver penny, butthat’s all. Take it or give me back my first silver penny and be gone.”The hawker shook his head as he mumbled to himself. Finally, he squinted up atOba with a look of resignation.“My charms aren’t selling well, of late. To tell the truth, I could use themoney. You have the best of me again, sir. I’ll guide you, then, for a silverpenny.”Oba released the man’s wrist. “Let’s go.”“It’s across the Azrith Plains. We’ll need horses.”“Now, you want me to buy you a horse? Are you out of your mind?”“Well, walking is no good. But I know folks, here, who will give you a good dealon a couple of horses. If we treat the animals right, I’m sure they’d agree tobuy them back once we return-less a small fee for their use.”Oba thought it over. He wanted to go up into the palace to have a look around,but he thought it best if he visited Lathea’s sister, first. There were thingsto learn.“That sounds fair.” Oba gave the hunched hawker a nod. “Let’s go get some horsesand be off, then.”They moved out of the quieter side route into a main road thick with millingthrongs. There were a number of attractive women about. Some of them lookedOba’s way, the invitation and longing clear in their eyes. They met his gaze,hungry for him. Oba gave them smiles, a token suggesting the possibility ofmore, later. He could see that even that much thrilled them.It occurred to him, though, that these women roaming the market were probablylowly peasants. Up in the palace were likely to be the kind of women Oba wantedto meet: women of station. He deserved no less. After all, he was a Rahl,practically a prince, or something comparable. Maybe even something more thanthat.“What’s you name, anyway?” Oba asked. “Seeing as we’ll be traveling together. ““Clovis.”Oba didn’t offer his name. He liked being called “ sir. “ It was, after all,only fitting.“With all the people,” Oba said as his gaze swept the crowds, “how is it thatyour charms aren’t selling? Why is it that you’re having hard times?”The man sighed in apparent misery. “It’s a sad tale, but it’s not your burden,sir.”“Simple enough question, I think.”“I suppose it is.” He shielded his eyes from the sunlight with a hand, partlycovered in a knitted fingerless glove, as he peered up at Oba. “Well, sir, atime ago, back in the thick of winter, I met a beautiful young woman.”Oba looked over at the hunched, wrinkled, disheveled man shuffling along besidehim. “Met her?”“Well, sir, truth be told, I was offering her a charm . . . Clovis’s browtwisted curiously-as if he’d suddenly come across something quite unexpected.“It was her eyes that seized you. Big blue eyes. Blue like you rarely see . . .”Clovis ogled up at Oba. “The thing is, sir, her eyes looked very much likeyours.”It was Oba’s turn to frown. “Like mine?”Clovis nodded earnestly. “They did, sir. She had eyes like yours. Imagine that.Something about her-about you as well-that looks ... somehow, familiar. Can’tsay as I know what it is, though.”“What does this have to do with your hard times? Did you give her all your moneyand fail to get between her legs?”Clovis seemed shocked by the very notion. “No sir, nothing like that. I tried tosell her a charm-so she would have good fortune. Instead, she stole all mymoney.”Oba grunted skeptically. “I’d bet she was batting her eyelashes and smiling atyou while she had her arm in your pocket to her elbow, and you were too eager tosuspect what she was really doing.”“Nothing like that, sir. Nothing like that at all.” His voice turned bitter.“She set a man upon me and he took it all for her. He did it, but it was at herword-I’m sure of it. The two of them stole all my money. Robbed me of everythingI had earned all year.”Something tickled Oba’s memory. He scanned his mental lists of odd and unrelatedthings. Some of those things began to come together.“What did this woman with the blue eyes look like?”“Oh. she was beautiful, sir, with thick ringlets of red hair.” Even if thiswoman had robbed the man of his savings, the distant look in his eye told Obathat he was still clearly taken by her. “Her face was like a vision of a goodspirit, it was, and her figure was enough to take your breath away. But I shouldhave known, by that bewitchingly evil red hair, that there was something moredevious to her than her beauty.”Oba halted and seized the man by the arm. “Was her name Jennsen?”Clovis offered only a regretful shrug. “ Sorry, sir. She never gave me her name.But I don’t imagine there are many women that look like her. Not with those blueeyes, her exquisite looks, and those ringlets of red hair. “Oba didn’t think so, either. The description fit Jennsen perfectly.Well, wasn’t that just something.Clovis pointed. “There, sir. Down there is the man who can sell us horses."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36Oba squinted into the gloom under the thick vegetation. It was hard to believehow dark it was in under the towering trees, down at the bottom of the crookedspine of rock, when it had been such a bright sunny morning up in the meadowabove. It looked wet ahead, too.He turned from the way leading in under the vines and hanging trailers of moss,to look back up the steep rocky incline, toward where he had left Clovis by awarm fire, watching their horses and gear. Oba was glad to finally be free ofthe jumpy little man. He was wearing, like a pesky fly buzzing around all thetime. All the way across the Azrith Plains, the man jabbered on and on at lengthabout everything and nothing. Oba would have rather been rid of the hawker andgone alone, but the man had been right about how difficult it would have been tohave found this place down into the back of Althea’s swamp.At least the man had no intention of going into the swamp with Oba. Clovis hadseemed nervous and edgy about making sure that his customer went in, though. Hewas probably worried that Oba wouldn’t believe him and was eager to provehimself. He waited at the top, watching, shooing with hands covered in tattered,fingerless gloves, impatient for Oba to go in and see that he was being givenhis money’s worth.Oba sighed and started out again, slogging ahead through the underbrush,stooping beneath low branches. He tiptoed across roots where he could, and wadedthrough standing water where he had to. The air was still and as stagnant as thewater. It felt wet, too, besides smelling foul.Strange birds called from far off through the trees, back in the shadows wherelight probably never reached, back beyond vines, thick clumps of leaves, androtting trunks leaning drunkenly against stalwart companions. Creatures movedthrough the water, too. What they could be, fish or reptile or conjured beast,there was no telling. Oba didn’t like the place. Not one bit.He reminded himself that there would be a myriad of new things to learn once hegot to Althea’s place. Not even that cheered him. He thought about the strangebugs and weasels and salamanders he’d seen so far, and the ones he was likelyyet to see. That, too, failed to cheer him; he still didn’t like the place.Ducking under branches, he swept spiderwebs aside. The fattest spider he’d everencountered fell to the ground and darted for a hiding place. Oba, quicker yet,squashed it good. Hairy legs clawed the air in death before going still. Obagrinned as he moved on. He was beginning to like the place better.His nose wrinkled. The farther in he went, the worse it smelled, reeking with astrange, pungent, dank rot. He saw steam rising off through the trees, and beganto detect an odor something like rotten eggs, but more acidic. Oba was beginningnot to like the place, again.He plowed onward, unsure if it had been a good idea to go to see Althea,especially by the route suggested by the hand-wringing hawker. Oba sighed as heslogged through thick brush. The sooner he got in and had a chat with Althea,the sooner he could be out of the disgusting place.Besides, the voice had stirred, restless that he continue.The sooner he was finished with Lathea’s sister, the sooner he could visit hisancestral home, the People’s Palace. It would be wise to learn what he could,first, so that he might know what to anticipate from his half brother.Oba wondered if Jennsen had been to see Althea, yet, and if she had, what shehad found out. Oba was more and more convinced that his fate was somehow linkedto the Jennsen woman. Too many things kept leading back to her for it to be ameaningless connection. Oba was very careful about how things on the lists hekept connected. Other people weren’t so observant, but they didn’t have tobe-they weren’t important.Both he and Jennsen were a hole in the world. Possibly even more interesting,they both had something in their eyes that Clovis had noticed. What it was,exactly, the man wasn’t sure. Oba had pressed him, but he couldn’t say.As the morning wore on, Oba made the best time he could along the twisted tangleof roots that passed for a path, until it sank lower ahead of him into anexpanse of still, dark water. Oba paused, panting, sweat streaming down hisface, checking to the sides, searching for another way across to where theground looked to rise up again. It appeared that the way ahead tunneled onthrough the thick, steamy growth. But first, he had to get across the water. Hotas he was, that didn’t sound half bad.He saw no vines hanging down that might steady him, so he quickly cut a stoutlimb and stripped it of branches to make himself a staff to help him balance ashe crossed the low place.Staff in hand, Oba waded out into a stretch of water. It wasn’t as much of acooling relief as he had hoped; it smelled awful and was full of brown leeches.As he moved through the water, trailing a wake that dislodged debris from thebanks, he had to keep brushing the clouds of biting bugs from his face. He keptchecking, but unless he backtracked to look for another way, he saw that it wasthe only way to dry land beyond. That thought alone convinced him to keep going.There were roots enough under the surface for footing, but Oba soon foundhimself in up to his chest and he wasn’t yet to the middle. As deep as it was,the water made him buoyant, which meant his footing wasn’t as good. The roots atthe bottom were slippery and poor support for the staff, but it at least helpedhim keep his balance.He was a good swimmer, but didn’t like the thought of what else might beswimming with him, and preferred to keep on his feet. Almost to the far bank,Oba was just about to discard the staff and swim the rest of the way to wash thesweat off, when something heavy brushed against his leg. Before he could thinkwhat to do about it, the thing bumped him hard enough to push him from his feet,dumping him into the water. As soon as he plunged into the deeper water, thething enveloped his legs.He instantly thought of the monsters that were said to dwell in the swamp.Throughout their long ride, Clovis had regaled him with stories of the beasts,warning him to be careful, but Oba had scoffed, confident in his own strength.Now, Oba cried out in fright of the monster that had him. He struggledfrantically, in gasping panic, trying to shake his legs free, but thefirebreathing beast had him fast and wouldn’t let go. It reminded him of beinglocked in the pen when he was little, trapped and helpless. Oba’s cry echoed outacross the frothing water, returning threefold from the darkness beyond. Theonly clear thought that came to him was that he was too young to die-especiallyin so awful a fashion. He had so much ahead of him to live for. It wasn’t fairthat this should happen to him.He cried out again as he splashed and fought to escape. He wanted away, just ashe had wanted out of the terrible trapped feeling of being locked in the pen.His screams never helped then, and they didn’t help now; their echo was emptycompanionship.The thing suddenly and forcefully twisted him around, spinning him, and draggedhim under.Oba gasped a breath just in time. As he went under, eyes wide in fright, he sawfor the first time the scales of his captor. It was the biggest snake he hadever seen, but he was also struck with relief because it was still a snake. Itmight be big, but it was just an animal-not a fire-breathing monster.Before his arm could be pinned, Oba snatched the knife in a sheath at his beltand yanked it free. He knew that in water it would be difficult to use the sameforce as on dry land. Still, stabbing the thing would be his only chance, and hehad to do it before he drowned.With his neck stretching for air, but the life-giving surface getting fartherand farther away as the weight around him continued to drag him deeper, his feetunexpectedly found something solid. Rather than continue to fight to reach thesurface for air, he let his legs bend as he sank. When his legs were folded likea bullfrog ready to spring, he tensed his powerful leg muscles and pushed with amighty shove off the bottom.Oba exploded from the water, coils of snake wrapped around him. He landed on hisside, halfway out of the water, up on twisted roots. The snake, its bodycushioning Oba’s weight when they crashed to the ground, clearly didn’tappreciate it. Iridescent green scales shimmered in the weak light as thereeking water sluiced from both combatants.The snake’s head rose over Oba’s shoulder. Yellow eyes peered at him through adark mask. A red tongue flicked out, feeling along its troublesome prey.Oba grinned. “Come closer, my pretty friend.”The snake undulated along his body as the eyes fixed him with a menacing stare.If a snake could get angry, this one was. Lightning quick, Oba snatched thething behind the dark green head, gripping it in his brawny fist. It remindedhim of the wrestling he had done before on rare occasions. He liked wrestling.Oba never lost at wrestling.The snake paused to hiss. With powerful muscles, each held back the other. Thesnake tried to enfold Oba in yet more coils and gain the advantage byconstricting. It was a mighty struggle of strength as each tried to wrestle theother into submission.Oba recalled that ever since he had listened to the voice, he had beeninvincible. He remembered how his life used to be ruled by fear, fear of hismother, fear of the powerful sorceress. Most everyone feared the sorceress, justas most everyone feared snakes. Except Oba had stood up to her dangerous magic.She had sent fire and lightning at him, magic able to blast its way throughwalls and vanquish any opposition, yet he had been invincible. What was a lowlysnake in the face of that kind of opponent? He felt a bit chagrined that he hadcried out in fright. What had he, Oba Rahl, to fear, least of all from a meresnake?Oba rolled farther up onto solid ground, taking the snake with him. He grinnedas he brought the knife up under the scaled jaw. The huge animal went still.With deliberate care, gripping the thing behind the head with one hand, Obapressed the blade upward with his other. The tough scales, like pale whitearmor, resisted penetration. The snake, now under threat from Oba’s deadlyblade, suddenly began struggling-not to dominate, this time, but to escape.Muscular coils unwrapped from Oba’s legs, sweeping across the ground, trying forpurchase against roots and saplings, searching for anything to latch on to. Withhis foot, Oba pulled a length of the shimmering green body back toward him,preventing any escape.The razor-sharp blade, with Oba’s powerful muscles pushing it, suddenly poppedthrough the thick scales under the jaw. Oba watched, fascinated, as blood randown his fist. The snake went wild with fear and pain. Any thoughts of conquestwere long forgotten. Now, it wanted desperately to get away. The animal put allits considerable strength to that effort alone.But Oba was strong. Nothing ever escaped him.Straining with the effort, he dragged the twisting, turning, writhing body uponto higher, drier ground. He grunted as he lifted the heavy beast. Holding italoft, screaming with fury, Oba ran forward. With a mighty lunge, he drove hisknife into a tree, pinning the snake there with the blade through its lower jawand roof of its mouth, like a long, third fang.The snake’s yellow eyes watched, helpless, as Oba drew another knife from hisboot. He wanted to see the life go out of those wicked yellow eyes as theywatched him.Oba made a slit in the pale underbody, in the fold between rows of scales. Not along slit. Not a slit that would kill. Just a slit big enough for his hand.Oba grinned. “Are you ready?” he asked the thing. It watched, unable to doanything else.Oba pushed his sleeve up his arm as far as he could, then wormed his hand inthrough the slit. It was a tight fit, but he wriggled his hand, then his wrist,then his arm into the living body, farther and farther as the snake whipped sideto side, not just in its futile effort to escape, but now in agony. With a knee,Oba pinned the body to the trunk of the tree and with a foot held down thethrashing tail.For Oba, the world seemed to vanish around him as he felt what it was like to bea snake. He imagined he was becoming the animal, in its living body, feeling itsskin around his own as he pushed his arm in. He felt its warm wet insidescompressed around his flesh. He slithered his hand in deeper. He had to standcloser, so that he could get his arm down in farther, until his eyes were onlyinches from the snake’s.Looking into those eyes, he was wildly exhilarated at seeing not just brutalpain, but the most marvelous terror.Oba felt his destination pulsing through the slippery viscera. Then, he foundit-the living heart. It beat furiously in his hand, throbbing and jumping. Asthey gazed deeply into each other’s eyes, Oba squeezed with his powerfulfingers. In a thick, warm, wet gush, the heart burst. The snake thrashed withthe sudden, wild strength of death. But as Oba held the quivering burst heart,each of the snake’s movements became progressively more labored, more sluggish,until with one last rolling flip of its tail, it went still.The whole time, Oba stared into the yellow eyes, until he knew they were dead.It wasn’t the same as watching a person die, because it lacked that singularconnection of human identity-there were no complex human thoughts with which hecould relate-but it was still thrilling to see death enter the living.He was liking the swamp better all the time.Victorious and blood-soaked, Oba squatted at the water’s edge, washing himselfand his knives clean. The entire encounter had been unexpected, rousing, andsatisfying, although he had to admit that it was nowhere near as exciting with asnake as it was with a woman. With a woman, there was the thrill of sex added into the experience, the thrill of having more than his hand inside her as deathentered her, too, to share her body with him.There could be no greater intimacy than that. It was sacred.The dark water was turned red by the time Oba had finished. The color made himthink of Jennsen’s red hair.As he straightened, he checked to make sure he had all his belongings and hadn’tlost anything in the struggle. He patted his pocket for the reassuring presenceof his hard-earned wealth.His money purse wasn’t there.In cold panic, he thrust his hand in his pocket, but the purse was gone. Herealized that he had to have lost it in the water while struggling with thesnake. He kept the purse on the end of a thong he tied to a belt loop so as tobe sure it was safe and couldn’t be accidentally lost. He didn’t see how it waspossible, but the knot in the leather thong must have come loose in thestruggle.He turned a scowl on the dead thing slumped in a heap at the base of the tree.In a screaming rage, Oba lifted the snake by the throat and pounded the lifelesshead against the tree until the scales started sloughing off.Panting and drained from the effort, Oba finally halted. He let the bloody massslip to the ground. Despondent, he decided he would have to dive back into thewater and search for his missing money. Before he did, he made one lastdespairing check of his pocket. Looking closer, he saw, then, that leather thonghe kept tied to his belt loop was still there. It hadn’t come undone, after all.He pulled the short length of leather out in his fingers.It had been cut.Oba turned, looking back the way he had come. Clovis.Clovis was always pushing up close, yammering away, like a pesky fly buzzingaround him. When Oba had bought the horses, Clovis had seen the money purse.With a growl, Oba glared back through the swamp. A light rain had begun to fall,making but a whisper against the living canopy of leaves. The drops felt cool onhis heated face.He would kill the little thief. Slowly.Clovis would no doubt feign innocence. He would beg to be searched to prove hedidn’t have the missing money purse. Oba figured the man would likely haveburied the money somewhere, intending to come back later and retrieve it.Oba would make him confess. There was no doubt in his mind about that. Clovisthought he was clever, but he had not met the likes of Oba Rahl before.Striking out back though the swamp to wring the hawker’s neck, Oba didn’t getfar before he stopped. No. It had taken him a good long time to get this far. Hehad to be close to Althea’s by now. He couldn’t let his anger rule him. He hadto think. He was smart. Smarter than his mother, smarter than Lathea thesorceress, and smarter than a scrawny little thief. He would act out ofdeliberate intent, not out of blind anger.He could deal with Clovis when he was finished with Althea.In a dark mood, Oba started out again toward the sorceress."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37Watching from a distance through the slow fall of rain, Oba didn’t see anyoneoutside the cedar log house that lay beyond the tangled undergrowth and trees.There had been tracks-the boot prints of a man around the shore of a small lake.The tracks weren’t fresh, but they had led Oba up a path to the house. Smokefrom the chimney curled lazily in the stagnant humid air.The house up ahead, almost hidden under trailers of moss and vines, had to bethe home of the sorceress. No one else would be fool enough to live in such amiserable place.Oba crept lightly on the balls of his feet, up the back steps, up onto thenarrow porch. Around in front, columns made of thick logs supported a low,overhanging roof. Out beyond the wide front steps lay a broad path-no doubt theway visitors timidly approached the sorceress for a telling.In the grip of rage, and well beyond any pretense of being polite enough toknock, Oba threw open the door. A small fire burned in the hearth. With only thefire and two little windows, the place was rather dimly lit. The walls werecovered with fussy carvings, mostly of animals, some plain, some painted, andsome gilded. It was hardly the way Oba chose to carve animals. The furnishingswere better than any he had ever grown up with, but not nearly as nice as he hadbecome accustomed to.Near the hearth, a woman with big dark eyes sat in an elaborately carvedchair-the finest of the furnishings-like a queen on her throne, quietly watchinghim over the rim of a cup as she sipped. Even though her long golden hair wasdifferent and she didn’t have that hauntingly austere cast to her face, Obastill recognized her features. Looking into those eyes, there could be no doubt.It was Lathea’s sister.Eyes. That was something on one of the mental lists he kept.“I am Althea,” she said, taking a cup away from her lips. Her voice wasn’t atall like her sister’s. It conveyed a sense of authority, as did Lathea’s voice,yet it didn’t have the haughty ring that went with it. She didn’t rise. “I’mafraid you’ve arrived much sooner than I expected.”Seeking to quickly nullify any potential threat, Oba ignored her and hurried tothe rooms at the rear, checking first the room where he saw a workbench. Clovishad told him that Althea had a husband, Friedrich, and, of course, there hadbeen a man’s boot prints outside. Chisels, knives, and mallets were laid out inan orderly fashion. Each could be a deadly weapon in the right hands. The placehad the tidy look of work put up for a time.“My husband is gone to the palace,” she called from her chair by the fire.“We’re alone.”He checked for himself anyway, looking in the bedroom, and found it empty. Shewas telling the truth. But for the rain on the roof, the place was quiet. Thetwo of them were indeed alone.Finally confident that they would not be disturbed, he returned to the mainroom. Without a smile, without a frown, without worry, she watched him comingtoward her. Oba thought that if she had any brains, she should at least beworried. If anything, she looked resigned, or maybe sleepy. A swamp, with itsheavy humid air, could certainly make a person drowsy.Not far from her chair, on the floor off to the side, rested a square board withan elaborate gilded symbol on it. It reminded him of something on one of hislists of things. A pile of small, smooth, dark stones sat to the side on theboard. A large red and gold pillow lay near her feet.Oba paused, suddenly realizing the connection between one of the things on hislists and the gilded symbol on the board. The symbol reminded him of the driedbase of a mountain fever rose-one of the herbs Lathea used to put in his cures.Most of Lathea’s herbs were already ground up, but that one never was. She wouldcrush a single one of the dried flowers only just before she added it to hiscure. Such an ominous conjunction could only be a warning sign of danger. He hadbeen right; this sorceress was the threat he had been concerned she might be.Fists flexing at his side, Oba towered over the woman as he glared down at her.“Dear spirits,” she whispered to herself, “I thought that I would never againhave to stare up into those eyes.”“What eyes?”“Darken Rahl’s eyes,” she said. Her voice carried a thread of some distantquality, maybe regret, maybe hopelessness, maybe even terror.“Darken Rahl’s eyes.” A grin stole onto Oba’s face. “That’s very generous of youto mention.”Not a trace of a smile visited her. “It was not a compliment.”Oba’s smile curdled.He was only mildly surprised that she knew he was the Darken Rahl’s son. She wasa sorceress, after all. She was also Lathea’s sister. Who knew what thattroublesome woman might have tattled from her eternal place in the world of thedead.“You’re the one who killed Lathea.”Her words were not so much question as condemnation. While Oba felt confident,because he was invincible, he remained wary. Though he had feared the sorceressLathea his whole life, she had in the end turned out to be less formidable thanhe had reckoned.But Lathea was not the equal of this woman, not by any means.Rather than answer her accusation, Oba asked a question of his own.“What’s a hole in the world?”She smiled a private smile, then held a hand out. “Won’t you sit and have sometea with me?”Oba guessed that he had the time. He would have his way with this woman-he wassure of that. There was no rush to be done with it. In a way he regretted havingrushed right into it with Lathea, before he’d thought to get answers toeverything, first. Done was done, he always said.Althea, though, would answer all his questions. He would take his time and besure if it. She would teach him many new things before they were finished. Suchlong-anticipated gratification should be savored, not rushed. He cautiously sankinto the chair. A pot sat on the simple little table between the two chairs, butthere was no second cup.“Oh, I’m sorry,” she said when she noticed his eyes searching and realized theomission. “Please go to the cupboard over there and get a cup?”“You’re the hostess of this tea party, why don’t you go get it for me?”The woman’s slender fingers traced the spiral curves at the ends of the chair’sarms. “I’m afraid that I’m a cripple. I can’t walk. I’m only able to drag myuseless legs around the house and do a few simple things for myself. “Oba stared at her, not knowing if he believed her. She was sweating profusely-asure sign of something. She was sure to be terrified in the presence of the manpowerful enough to do away with her sorceress sister. Maybe she was trying todistract him, hoping to make a run for it as soon as he turned his back.Althea took her skirt between forefingers and thumbs and lifted the hem in adainty manner, allowing him to see her knees and a little higher. He leaned overfor a look. Her legs were mangled and withered. They looked like they had diedages ago and not been buried. Oba found the sight fascinating.Althea lifted an eyebrow. “Crippled, as I said.”“How ?”“Your father’s work.”Well, wasn’t that just something.For the first time, Oba felt a very tangible connection to his father.He had had a difficult and trying morning and was entitled to a leisurely cup oftea. In fact, he found the notion provocative. What he had in mind for her wouldbe thirsty work. Oba crossed the room and retrieved the biggest cup from amongthe collection he found on a shelf. When he set the cup down, she poured it fullof a dark thick tea.“Special tea,” she explained when she noticed the frown on his face. “It can beterribly uncomfortable here in the swamp, what with the heat and humidity. Thishelps clear the head, too, after the onus of a morning’s difficult tasks. Amongother things, it will sweat the weariness from tired muscles-such as from a longwalk.”His head was pounding after his tough morning. Although his clothes were finallydry after his swim, and the blood had all been washed off, he wondered if shecould somehow sense the difficult time he’d had. There was no telling what thiswoman could do, but he wasn’t worried. He was invincible, as Lathea’s end hadproved.“Your tea will help all that?”“Oh yes. It’s a very powerful tonic. It will cure many problems. You’ll see foryourself.”Oba saw that she was drinking the same thick tea. She was sweating, sure, so hefigured she was right about that. She downed the rest of her cupful and pouredherself another.She held her cup up in toast. “To sweet life, while we have it.”Oba thought it an odd toast. It sounded almost as if she was admitting that sheknew she was about to die.“To life,” Oba said, lifting his cup to tap against hers. “While we have it.”Oba took a gulp of the dark tea. He grimaced at recognizing the taste. It waswhat the symbol on the board represented-the mountain fever rose. He had learnedto identify the bitter taste from the times when Lathea crushed one and added itto his cure.“Drink up,” his companion said. Her breathing seemed labored. She took a fewlong swallows. “As I said, it will solve a lot of problems.” She drained therest in her cup.He knew that Lathea, despite her mean streak, sometimes mixed up cures to helpsick people. While he’d waited on her to make cures for him and his mother, hehad seen her crush up a mountain fever rose in many a concoction she mixed forothers. Now, Althea was downing it by the cupful, so she obviously had faith inthe distasteful herb, too. Such heavy humidity always gave Oba a headache.Despite the bitter taste, he took another sip, hoping it would help his soremuscles in addition to clearing his head.“I have some questions.”“You mentioned that,” Althea said, peering at him from over the rim of her cup.“And you expect me to provide answers.”“That’s right.”Oba took another swallow of the heavy tea. He grimaced again. He didn’t know whythe woman called it “tea.” There was no “tea” about it. It was just ground driedmountain fever rose in a little hot water. Her dark-eyed gaze followed as he setthe big cup on the table.The wind had picked up, beating the rain in against the window. Oba guessed he’dmade it to her house just in time. Foul swamp. He turned his attention back tothe sorceress.“I want to know what a hole in the world is. Your sister said that you could seeholes in the world.”“Did she now? I don’t know why she would say such a thing.”“Oh, I had to convince her,” Oba said. “Am I going to have to convince you,too?”He hoped so. He tingled with the anticipation of getting to the bladework. Buthe was in no rush. He had time. He enjoyed playing games with the living. Ithelped him understand how they thought, so that when the time came and he lookedinto their eyes, he was better able to imagine what they were thinking as deathhovered close.Althea tilted her head in gesture to the table between them. “The tea won’t helpif you don’t have enough. Drink up.”Oba waved off her concern and leaned closer on an elbow. “I’ve traveled a longway. Answer my question.”Althea finally looked away from his glare and used her arms to lower her weightfrom her chair down onto the floor. It was quite a struggle. Oba didn’t offer tohelp. It fascinated him to watch people struggle. The sorceress pulled herselfto the red and gold pillow, dragging her useless legs behind. She worked herselfinto a sitting position and folded her dead legs up before herself. It wasdifficult, but she managed with precise and efficient moves that looked wellpracticed.All the effort puzzled him. “Why don’t you use your magic?”She peered up at him with those big dark eyes so filled with silentcondemnation. “Your father did the same to my magic as he did to my legs. “Oba was stunned. He wondered if his father had been invincible, too. Perhaps Obahad always been meant to be his father’s true heir. Perhaps fate had finallystepped in and rescued Oba for better things.“You mean, you’re a sorceress, but you can’t do magic?”As distant thunder rumbled through the swamp, she gestured to a place on thefloor. While Oba sat down before her, she dragged over the board with the gildedsymbol and placed it between them.“I was left with only a partial ability to foretell things,” she said. “Nothingelse. If you wished to, you could strangle me with one hand while finishing yourtea with the other. I could do nothing to stop you.”Oba thought that might take some of the fun out of it. Struggle was part of anygenuinely satisfying encounter. How much could a crippled old woman struggle? Atleast there was still the terror, the agony, and witnessing death’s arrival tolook forward to.“But, you can still do prophecy? That was how you knew I was coming?”“In a way.” She sighed heavily, as if the effort of pulling herself to her redand gold pillow had left her exhausted. As she turned her attention to the boardbefore her, she seemed to shrug off her weariness.“I want to show you something.” She was speaking now like a confidant. “It mayfinally explain some things for you.”He leaned forward expectantly, pleased that she had at last wisely decided toreveal secrets. Oba liked to learn new things.He watched as she sorted through her little pile of stones. She inspectedseveral carefully before she found the one she wanted. She set the others to theside, apparently in some order she understood, though he thought they all lookedthe same.She turned back to him and lifted the single stone up before his eyes. “You,”she said.“Me? What do you mean?”“This stone represents you.”“Why?”“It chose to.”“You mean that you decided it would represent me.”“No. I mean that the stone decided to represent you-or, rather, that whichcontrols the stones decided.”“What controls the stones?”He was surprised to see a smile spread on Althea’s face. It grew to a dangerousgrin. Not even Lathea had ever managed a look as chillingly malevolent.“Magic decides,” she hissed.Oba had to remind himself that he was invincible. He gestured, trying to lookunconcerned.“What about the others? Who are they, then?”“I thought you wanted to learn about yourself, not others.” She leaned towardhim with a countenance of supreme self-confidence. “Other people don’t reallymatter to you, now do they?”Oba glared at her private smile. “I guess not.”She rattled the single stone in her loose fist. Without looking away from hiseyes, she cast the stone down at the board. Lightning flickered. The stonetumbled across the board, rolling to a stop out beyond the outer gilded circle.Thunder rumbled in the distance.“So,” he asked, “what does it mean?”Rather than answer, and without looking down, she scooped up the stone. Her gazedidn’t move off his face as she rattled his stone again. Again, and without aword, she cast it at the board. Lightning flashed. Amazingly, the stone came torest in the same place as it had the first time-not just close to the sameplace, but in the exact same place. Rain drummed against the roof as a stutterof thunder crackled through the swamp.Althea quickly swept up the stone and cast it a third time, again accompanied bya flash of lightning, only this time the lightning was closer. Oba licked hislips as he waited for the fall of the stone that represented him.Goose bumps ran up his arms as he saw the dark little stone roll to a stop inthe same place on the board as it had the two previous times. The instant it hadhalted, thunder boomed.Oba put his hands on his knees and leaned back. “Some trick.”“Not a trick,” she said. “Magic.”“I thought you couldn’t do magic.”“I can’t.”“Then how are you doing that?”“I told you, I’m not doing it. The stones are doing it themselves.”“Well, then, what’s it supposed to mean about me when it stops, there, in thatplace?”He realized that somewhere during the stone-rolling, her smile had gone away.One graceful finger, lit by the firelight, pointed down to where his stone lay.“That place represents the underworld,” she said in a grim voice. “The world ofthe dead.”Oba tried to look only mildly interested. “What does that have to do with me?”Her big dark eyes wouldn’t stop boring into his soul. “That’s where the voicecomes from, Oba.”Goose bumps flitted up his arms. “How do you know my name?”She cocked her head, casting half her face in deep shadow. “I made a mistake,once, long ago.”“What mistake?”“I helped save your life. Helped your mother get you away from the palace beforeDarken Rahl could find out that you existed and kill you. ““Liar!” Oba snatched up the stone from the board. “I’m his son! Why would hewant to kill me!”She hadn’t taken her penetrating gaze from him. “Maybe because he knew you wouldlisten to the voices, Oba.”Oba wanted to cut out her terrible eyes. He would cut them out. He thought itbest, though, if he found out more, first, if he gathered his courage, first.“You were a friend of my mother?”“No. I didn’t really know her. Lathea knew her better. Your mother was but oneyoung woman among several who were in trouble and a great deal of danger. Ihelped them, that’s all. For that, Darken Rahl crippled me. If you choose not tobelieve the truth about his intentions toward you, then I leave it to you toplease yourself with a different answer of your own devising.”Oba considered her words, checking them for any connection they might have toanything on his lists. He didn’t find any links right off.“You and Lathea helped the children of Darken Rahl?”“My sister Lathea and I were at one time very close. We were both committed,each in our own way, to helping those in need. But she came to resent those likeyou, offspring of Lord Rahl, because of the agony it caused me to have tried tohelp. She could not bring herself to witness my punishment and pain. She left.“It was a weakness on her part, but I knew she could not help having suchfeelings. I loved her, so I would not beg her to visit me, here, like this,despite how terribly I missed her. I never saw her again. It was the onlykindness I could do her-let her run away. I would imagine she did not lookkindly upon you. She had her reasons, even if they were misdirected.”Oba was not about to be talked into any sympathy for that hateful woman. Heinspected the dark stone for a time and then gave it back to Althea.“Those three were just luck. Do it again.”“You wouldn’t believe me if I did it a hundred times.” She handed the stoneback. “You do it. Cast it yourself.”Oba defiantly rattled the stone in his loose fist, as he had seen her do. Sheleaned back against her chair as she watched him. Her eyes were getting droopy.Oba threw the stone down at the board with enough force to be certain that itwould roll well beyond the board and prove her wrong. As the stone left hishand, lightning flashed so hard that he flinched and looked up, fearing it wasblasting through the roof. Thunder crashed on its heels, shaking the house. Thestrike felt like it rattled his bones. But then it was over and the only soundwas the rain drumming against the undamaged roof and windows.Oba grinned in relief and looked down, only to see the cursed stone sitting inthe exact same place it had come to rest the three times before.He jumped up as if he’d been bitten by a snake. He rubbed his sweating palmsagainst his thighs.“A trick,” he said. “It’s just a trick. You’re a sorceress and you’re just doingmagic tricks.”“You are the one who has done the trick, Oba. You are the one who invited hisdarkness into your soul.”“And what if I have!”She smiled at his admission. “You may listen to the voice, Oba, but you are notthe one. You are merely his servant, no more. He must choose another if he is tobring darkness upon the world.”“You don’t know what you’re talking about!”“Oh, but I do. You may be a hole in the world, but you are missing a necessaryingredient.”“And what would that be?”“Grushdeva. “Oba felt the hair at the back of his neck stiffen. While he didn’t recognize thespecific word, the source was indisputable. The idiosyncratic nature of the wordbelonged solely to the voice.“A senseless word. It means nothing.”She regarded him for a time with a look that he feared because it seemed to holda world of forbidden knowledge. By the cast of iron resolve in her eyes, he knewthat no mere blade would gain that knowledge for him.“A long time ago, in a faraway place,” she said in her quiet voice, anothersorceress revealed to me a bit of the Keeper’s tongue. That is one of his words,in his primordial language. You would not have heard it unless you were theright one. Grushdeva. It means ‘vengeance.’ You are not the one he has chosen.”Oba thought she might be taunting him. “You don’t know what words I’ve heard oranything about it. I’m the son of Darken Rahl. A rightful heir. You don’t knowanything about what I hear. I will have power you can only imagine.”“Free will is forfeit when dealing with the Keeper. You have sold what is yoursalone and priceless ... for nothing but ashes.“You have sold yourself into the worst kind of slavery, Oba, in return fornothing more than the illusion of self-worth. You have no say in what is to be.You are not the one. It is another.” She wiped the sweat from her brow. “And,that much of it is yet to be decided.”“Now you presume to think you can alter the course of what I have wrought?Dictate what shall be?” Oba’s own words surprised him. They’d seemed to come outbefore he thought to say them.“Such things are not amenable to the likes of me,” she admitted. “I learned atthe Palace of the Prophets not to meddle in that which is above me andungovernable. The grand scheme of life and death are the rightful province ofthe Creator and the Keeper.” She seemed contented behind a sly expression. “ButI am not above exercising my free will.”He’d heard enough. She was only trying to stall, to confuse him. For somereason, he couldn’t make his racing heart slow.“What are holes in the world?”“They are the end of the likes of me,” she said. “They are the end of everythingI know.”It was just like a sorceress to answer with a senseless riddle. “Who are theother stones?” he demanded.At last, she turned her formidable eyes from him to look down at the otherstones. Her movements seemed oddly jerky. Her slender fingers selected one ofthe stones. As she lifted it, she paused to put her other hand across hermiddle. Oba realized that she was in pain. She was trying her best to cover it,but she couldn’t cover it now. The sweat beading her brow was from pain. Theagony came out in a low moan. Oba watched with fascination.Then, it seemed to ebb some. With great effort she straightened her posture andreturned her attention to what she had been doing. She held out her hand, palmup, with the stone sitting in the center.“This one,” she said, her breathing labored, now, “is me.”“You? That stone is you?”She nodded as she cast it at the board without even looking. The stone tumbledto a stop, this time, without the accompaniment of lightning and thunder. Obafelt relieved, even a little foolish, that he had been so rattled by thatbefore. He smiled, now. It was just a silly board game, and he was invincible.The stone had come to rest at one corner of the square that lay within the twocircles.He gestured. “So, what does that mean?”“Protector,” she managed through a shallow pant.Her trembling fingers gathered up the stone. She lifted her hand up before himand opened her slender fingers. The stone, her stone, rested in the center ofher palm. Her eyes were fixed on his.As Oba watched, the stone crumbled to ash in her palm.“Why did it do that?” he whispered, his eyes going wide.Althea didn’t answer. Instead, she slumped and then toppled over. Her armssprawled out before her, her legs to the side. The ash that had been a stonescattered in a dark smear across the floor.Oba leaped to his feet. His goose bumps were back. He had seen enough people dieto know that Althea was dead.Rending slashes of thunderous lightning ignited, lacing the sky with violentflashes of light that lanced in through the windows, throwing blinding whitelight across the dead sorceress. Sweat trickled down his temple and over hischeek.Oba stood staring at the body for a long moment.And then he ran."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38Panting and nearly spent from the effort, Oba stumbled out of the thickvegetation into the meadow. He squinted around in the sudden bright light. Hewas spooked, hungry, thirsty, weary, and in a mood to tear the little thief limbfrom limb.The meadow was empty.“Clovis!” His roar came back to him in an empty echo. “Clovis! Where are you!”Only the moan of the wind between the towering rock walls answered. Oba wonderedif the thief might be nervous, might be reluctant to come out, worried that Obamight have discovered his fortune missing and suspect the truth of whathappened.“Clovis, come here! We need to leave! I must get back to the palace at once!Clovis!”Oba waited, his chest heaving, listening for an answer. With fists at his sides,he again bellowed the little thief’s name into the cold afternoon air.When no answer came, he fell to his knees beside the fire Clovis had startedthat morning. He thrust his fingers into the powdery gray ash. It hadn’t rainedup in the meadow, but the ashes were ice cold.Oba stood, staring up the narrow defile through which they had ridden in earlythat morning. The cold breeze blowing across the empty meadow ruffled his hair.With both hands, Oba ran his fingers back through his hair, almost as if to keephis head from bursting as the awful truth settled in.He realized that Clovis had not buried the money purse he’d stolen. That hadnever been his plan. He’d taken the money and run as soon as Oba had gone downinto the swamp. He’d run with Oba’s fortune, not buried it.With a sick, empty, sinking feeling, Oba understood, then, the full extent ofwhat had really happened. No one ever went in the swamp by this back way. Clovishad talked him into it and guided him there because he believed Oba would perishin the treacherous swamp. Clovis had been confident that Oba would become lostand the swamp would swallow him, if the monsters supposedly guarding Althea’sback didn’t snare him first.Clovis had felt no need to bury the money-he figured Oba was dead. Clovis wasgone, and he had Oba’s fortune.But Oba was invincible. He had survived the swamp. He had bested the snake. Nomonsters had dared come out to challenge him after that.Clovis had probably thought that even if the swamp didn’t finish his benefactor,there were two other mortal dangers he could count on, Althea hadn’t invited Obain; Clovis had probably figured that she would not take kindly to uninvitedguests-sorceresses rarely did. And, they had deadly reputations.But Clovis had not anticipated Oba being invincible.That left the thief only one safeguard against Oba’s wrath, and that one was aproblem-the Azrith Plains. Oba was stranded in a desolate place. He had no food,Water was nearby, but he had no means to take it with him. He had no horse. Hehad even left his wool jacket, unnecessary in a swamp, with the underhandedlittle hawker. Walking out of this place, without supplies, exposed to winter’sweather, would finish anyone who had somehow managed to survive the swamp andAlthea.Oba couldn’t make his feet move. He knew that, given his situation, if he struckout and tried to walk back, he would die. Despite the cold, he could feel sweatrunning down his neck. His head was pounding.Oba turned and stared back down into the swamp. There would be things back atAlthea’s house-food, clothing, and surely something in which he could carrywater. Oba had spent his life making do. He could make a pack, at least a packgood enough to get him back to the palace. He could put together a supply offood from the sorceress’s house. She wouldn’t be there alone and crippledwithout food on hand. Her husband would be back, but maybe not for days. Hewould have left food.Oba could wear layers of clothes to keep himself warm enough to make the trekacross the bitterly cold plains. Althea said her husband went to the palace. Hewould have warm clothes to cross the Azrith Plains, and might have left extraclothes at the house. Even if they didn’t fit, Oba could make do. There would beblankets he could take in a pack and wear as a cloak.There was always the possibility, though, that the husband might come backsooner. By the lack of a trail on this side, he would most likely come in thewide path from the other side of the swamp. He could already be there and havediscovered his wife’s body. Oba wasn’t really concerned about that, though. Hecould deal with the nuisance of a grieving husband. Maybe the man would even bepleased to be out from under the obligation of having to care for a petulantcrippled wife. What good was she, anyway? The man should be glad to be rid ofher. He might offer Oba a drink to help him celebrate his liberation.Oba didn’t feel like celebrating, though. Althea had pulled some evil trick anddenied him the pleasure he had so looked forward to-the pleasure he deservedafter his long and difficult journey. Oba sighed at how trying sorceresses couldbe. At least she could provide him with what he needed in order to get back tohis ancestral home.But when he got back to the People’s Palace, he would have no money, unless hecould find Clovis. Oba knew that was a thin hope. Clovis had Oba’s hard-earnedfortune, now, and might well have decided to travel to fine places, wantonlyspending his ill-gotten gain. The little thief was likely to be long gone.Oba didn’t have a copper penny. How was he to survive? He couldn’t go back tothat pauper’s life, a life like the one he had had with his mother, not now, notafter he had discovered that he was a Rahl-almost royalty.He couldn’t go back to his old life. He wouldn’t.Simmering with anger, Oba plunged back down the spine of rock. It was gettinglate in the day. He had no time to waste.Oba didn’t touch the corpse.He wasn’t at all queasy about the dead. Quite the contrary, the dead fascinatedhim. He had spent a great deal of time with dead bodies. But this woman gave himthe shivers. Even dead, she seemed to watch him as he searched her house,throwing clothes and supplies in a pile in the center of the room.There was something profane-sinful-about the woman sprawled on the floor. Eventhe flies buzzing around the room didn’t light on her. Lathea had beentroublesome, but this woman was different. Althea had pulled some evil trick anddenied him the answers he deserved after his long and difficult journey.Oba fumed at how trying sorceresses could be. At least she could provide himwith what he needed in order to get back to his ancestral home. There wassomething unholy about this woman. She had been able to look right into him.Lathea had never been able to do that. Of course, he had once thought she could,but she couldn’t. Not really. This woman could.She could see the voice in him.Oba wasn’t sure if he was safe around her, even if she was dead. Since he wasinvincible, it was probably only his fertile imagination, he knew, but a personcouldn’t be too cautious.In the bedroom, he found warm wool shirts. They were not nearly large enough,but by ripping out some of the seams a little here, or a little there, he couldget them on. Once he was satisfied with his alterations, he threw the item ofclothing on the pile. They would be good enough to keep him warm. He addedblankets and shirts to the pile in the center of the main room.Annoyed that the tardy husband hadn’t returned, and to distract his mind fromthe smug dead woman who just lay there watching him work, Oba laid plans to killsomeone before he went crazy. Maybe a catty woman. One who had those viciousscowl lines around her eyes like his mother had. He needed to make someone payfor all the trouble he had been through. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t.It was already dark outside. He had to light an oil lamp in order to continuehis search. Oba was in luck; in a lower cupboard he found a waterskin. On hishands and knees, he rummaged through a collection of odd scraps of cloth, cupswith cracks, broken cooking tools, and a supply of wax and wick. From the backhe pulled out a small roll of canvas. He tested its strength and decided hecould stitch a pack from it. There was material from clothes around he could useto make straps. A sewing kit was handy enough on a low shelf nearby.He had noticed that such useful things were on low shelves, where the crippledsorceress with the evil eyes could get to them. A sorceress without magic. Notlikely. She was jealous because the voice chose him and not her. She was up tosomething.He knew it would take him some time to collect everything and stitch together apack for his supplies. He couldn’t leave at night. It would be impossible tomake it out though the swamp at night. He was invincible, not stupid.With the oil lamp close by, he sat at the workbench and started in on sewinghimself a pack. Althea watched him from the floor in the main room. She was asorceress, so he knew it would do no good to throw a blanket over her head. Ifshe could watch him all the way from the world of the dead, a mere blanketwasn’t going to blind her dead eyes. He would just have to be satisfied to haveher watch while he worked.When he had the pack finished and tested to his satisfaction, he set it on thebench and started packing it with food and clothing. She had dried fruit andjerky, along with sausages and cheese. There were biscuits that would be easyenough to carry. He didn’t bother with pots or food that had to be cookedbecause he knew there was nothing on the Azrith Plains from which to build afire, and he certainly wasn’t going to be able to lug firewood along. He’dtravel light and swiftly. He hoped it would only take him a few days to reachthe palace.What he would do once he reached the palace, how he would survive without money,he didn’t know. He briefly considered stealing it, but rejected the idea; hewasn’t a thief and wouldn’t lower himself to being a criminal. He wasn’t surehow he would get by at the palace. He only knew he had to get there.When he had finished putting together what he would take, his eyes were droopingand he was yawning every few minutes. He was sweating from all his work, andfrom the heat of the foul swamp. Even at night the place was miserable. Hedidn’t know how the know-it-all sorceress could stand to live in such a place.No wonder her husband went off to the palace. The man was probably downing alesand moaning to his chums about having to go back to his swamp-wife.Oba didn’t like the idea of sleeping in the same house with the sorceress, butshe was dead, after all. He still didn’t trust her, though. She might be up tosome trick. He yawned again and wiped sweat from his brow.There were two well-stuffed sleeping pallets close together on the floor in thebedroom. One was neatly made, the other was less orderly. Judging from the tidyworkbench, the neatly made bed was likely the husband’s, and the other Althea’s.Since she was dead on the floor way in the other room, he didn’t feel quite souneasy about sleeping on a nice soft pallet.The husband wasn’t going to be coming home in the dark, so Oba wasn’t worriedabout waking to a madman at his throat. Still, he thought it best if he wedged achair against the door lever before he retired for the night. With the house allsecured, he yawned, ready for bed. On his way by, Oba gave Althea the coldshoulder.Oba fell right off to sleep, but it was a fitful slumber. Dreams haunted him. Itwas hot in the swamp house. Since it was winter everywhere else, he hadn’tgotten accustomed to such sudden sultry heat. Outside, bugs kept up a steadybuzzing while night animals hooted and called. Oba tossed and turned, trying toget away from the sorceress’s haunting gaze and knowing smile. They seemed tofollow him no matter which way he turned, watching him, not letting him sleepsoundly.He woke for good just after it had begun to get light out.He was in Althea’s bed.In a rush to untangle himself from the covers and escape her bed, he rolled overonto his hands and knees. His weight abruptly pushed his hand through thestuffed bedding. In wild alarm, Oba threw back the bedding and overturned thepallet to see what vile trick she had planted for him. She had known he wascoming to see her. She was up to something.Under where her pallet had been resting, he saw that a floorboard was loose.That was all it was-a floorboard that had pivoted. Oba frowned in suspicion. Aclose inspection revealed that the plank had pins in the middle so it wouldseesaw.With one careful finger, he pushed the sunken end farther down. The other end ofthe board rose up. A compartment under the board contained a wooden box. Helifted out the box and tried to open it, but it was locked, somehow. There wasno hole for a key, and no readily apparent lid, so there was probably some trickto opening it. It was heavy. When he shook it, it made only a muffled sound frominside. It might have simply been a weighted weapon the crippled woman keptunder her bed in case she was attacked in the night by a snake or something.With the box in his meaty hand, Oba shuffled to the workbench. He sat on thestool and leaned close. As he selected a chisel and mallet, he noticed that thesorceress was still on the floor in the other room, watching.“What’s in the box?” he called to her.Of course she didn’t answer. She had no intention of being cooperative. If shehad been cooperative, she would have answered all his questions, instead ofdropping dead after performing her stone-to-ash trick. It gave him shivers justremembering it. Something about the entire encounter had been more than hewanted to contemplate.Oba used the chisel to pry on the box. He tested every joint, but it wouldn’topen. He hammered on it with the mallet, but he only succeeded in breaking themallet’s handle. He sighed, deciding that it was probably just a weighted weaponAlthea kept for defense.He rose from the bench to go gather his supplies and check that he hadeverything. He’d had enough of the odd goings-on and the puzzling things she’dleft. He needed to be on his way.Oba paused, then, and turned back at some inner urging. If the heavy box was aweapon, she would have kept it easily at hand. Something about this box wasimportant, or it wouldn’t be hidden under a floorboard. Something inside toldhim so.Resolving to get into the box, he sat again at the bench and selected a narrowerchisel and another mallet. He worked the sharp blade between a lengthwise joint,near the edge. Sweat dripping off the end of his nose, he grunted with theeffort of whacking at the end of the chisel handle, trying to open the joint tosee if it was just lead weight inside.All of a sudden, wood split with a loud snap and the box broke open. Gold andsilver coins spilled out like guts from a carp. Oba stood staring at the glut ofgold heaped on the bench. The box hadn’t rattled only because it had been packedfull. There was a fortune-a real fortune.Well, wasn’t that just something.There had to be twenty times as much gold as the little weasel, Clovis, hadstolen from him. Oba had thought that poverty had been inflicted upon him by thecowardly little thief, and it turned out he was richer than ever-richer eventhan his wildest dreams. He truly was invincible. He had suffered throughadversity and misfortune that would have defeated a lesser man, and fate hadjustly rewarded him for all his struggles. He knew that this could be nothingother than divine direction.Oba smiled across the room at the woman who lay there watching his triumph.In the drawers of the bench, he found tools kept in pouches. There were threenice leather pouches containing finely crafted beading planes. The leatherpouches were probably used to keep the sharp edges on the blades from beingdinged and dulled. A cloth pouch held a set of dividers. Another pouch heldrosin, while still others held various odd tools. The husband was exceptionallyorderly. Life with his swamp-wife had probably driven him mad.Oba wiped sweat from his eyes and then scooped all the coins together in thecenter of the bench. He divided them up into equal piles, carefully countingeach pile out so he would know exactly how much money he had earned.Finished counting, he filled the leather and cloth pouches, putting one in eachpocket. For safety’s sake, he tied each pouch with two thongs going in differentdirections to different belt loops. He tied a smaller purse around each leg,letting them rest inside the tops of his boots. He opened his trousers andsecured several of the heaviest purses inside, where no one could get to them.He reminded himself that he would have to be cautious of passionate ladies withfriendly hands, lest they come up with more than he wished to give them.Oba had learned his lesson. From now on, he wouldn’t keep his fortune alltogether. A man as wealthy as he had to protect his holdings. The world was fullof thieves."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39Oba trudged at last into the outer fringes of the open-air market. After theisolation of the barren plains, the Raucous swirl of activity was disorienting.Ordinarily, he would be intrigued by all the goings-on, but this time he paidlittle heed.He had learned before that rooms could be rented up in the palace. That was whathe wanted-to get up into the People’s Palace and get himself a proper room. Onethat was quiet. After some good food and rest to recover his strength, he wouldbuy some new clothes and then have a look around. But now, he only wanted thequiet room and the rest. For some reason, the thought of food sickened him.It seemed somewhat inappropriate to him that a Rahl should lower himself torenting a room in his own ancestral home, but he would have to deal with thatmatter later. Now, he just wanted to lie down. His head was pounding. His eyeshurt every time he turned them to look at something, so, as he plodded alongwith his head hanging, he tried to limit his focus to the patch of dusty groundimmediately before his feet.He had made the long journey from the miserable swamp to the palace by sheerforce of will. Despite the cold, he was sweating. He probably had been too waryof the cold weather he would encounter crossing the Azrith Plains and, with allthe shirts he was wearing, had overdressed for it. After all, with springgetting closer, it wasn’t as cold as it had been in the depths of winter whenhis lunatic mother had saddled him with the humiliating task of chipping away atmounds of frozen muck.Oba dug at a wad of cloth bunching uncomfortably under his armpit. The shirtshad been too small for him, so he had had to rip out seams here and there to getthem all on. Some of the sleeves had come apart on his long trek across thewindswept plain, and had ridden up his arm under the outer layers that now hunglike tattered flags. His canvas pack, made in such haste, was coming apart, too,so that the corners of the dark wool blanket hung down, flapping behind him ashe walked.With all the different colors of cloth showing through the various tom layers,and the brown woolen blanket he wore as a cloak, he mused that he must look likea beggar. He was probably wealthy enough to buy the entire market a dozen timesover. He would buy some fine clothes later. First, he needed a quiet room and agood long rest.No food, though. He definitely didn’t feel like eating anything. He ached allover-even blinking was painful-but it was his gut that was in particular agony.When he had been here before, the savory aromas of cooking had made his mouthwater. Now the tendrils of smoke from cooking fires nauseated him. He wonderedif it was because he had more refined tastes now. He thought that maybe if hewent up into the palace, he could get himself something mild to eat. The thoughtfailed to rally his appetite. He wasn’t hungry, just tired.Eyes drooping, Oba slogged onward through the makeshift streets of the open-airmarket. He aimed himself at the plateau towering over them. The pack on his backfelt as if it weighed as much as three good-sized men. Probably some trick ofthe swamp-witch, some spell she had cast, Knowing he was on his way to herplace, she had probably put some magic lead weights in her sausages. The thoughtof sausages made his stomach roil.Peering up at the palace shining in the sunlight far overhead as he walked, heaccidentally blundered into someone, driving a grunt from their lungs. Oba wasjust about to kick the annoying obstacle out of his path, when the hunchedbundle of rags wheeled to growl a curse.It was Clovis.Before Oba could snatch him, Clovis scrambled out from underfoot and dovebetween two older men passing by. Oba, right behind him, but being wider,knocked the men aside. As the two men fell, Oba staggered through, fighting tokeep his balance, and went for the little thief. Clovis skidded to a stop. Helooked left then right. Seeing his chance, Oba lunged for the thief draped withtattered clothes, but the slight man was able to cut down another street just intime to slip out of Oba’s reaching arms. Oba fell short, capturing only afaceful of dirt and a small flag of cloth from the man’s sleeve.As Oba clambered to his feet, he saw Clovis leap over a fire to the side wherepeople were cooking strips of meat skewered on sticks, and run back betweenpicketed horses. For such a stooped fellow, he could run like smoke in a gale.But Oba was big and strong-and quick. Oba had always prided himself on beinglight on his feet. He cleared the cook fire with room to spare and ran backbetween the horses, trying not to lose sight of his prey.The horses spooked at having men racing recklessly between them. Severalpanicked animals reared, pulling up lines, and bolted. The man watching them,yelling curses and oaths Oba didn’t really hear or care about, jumped out infront of him. His attention fixed on the man he was chasing, Oba clouted theirate fellow out of the way. More horses reared. Without pausing, Oba careeredafter the thief.Oba didn’t really need his money back. He had a fortune now. He had more moneythan he could probably ever spend-even if he was only halfway careful. But thiswas not about money. This was about a crime, a betrayal. Oba had paid the man,trusted him, and he had been cheated for it.Worse, he had been played for a fool. His mother always told him that he was afool. Oba the oaf, she always called him. Oba wasn’t going to allow anyone tomake a fool of him anymore. He wasn’t going to allow his smug mother to beproven right.That Oba had triumphed and come out of the swamp richer than ever was no thanksto Clovis. No, it was thanks only to Oba himself. Just when he thought he was apauper again, he managed to find the secret to a fortune that was, after all,due him for any number of reasons, the least of which was his long and difficultjourney to see Althea, only to have her, too, cheat him out of answers for nomore reason than out-and-out meanness.Clovis had plotted it all out and left him for dead. His intention had been tokill him. The fact that Oba had survived was no thanks to Clovis. The man was amurderer, when you thought about it. A killer. The people of D’Hara would oweOba Rahl a debt of gratitude after he dealt out swift and just retribution tothe wicked little outlaw.Clovis darted around a corner stand displaying hundreds of items made fromsheep’s horn. Oba, being heavier, shot past the corner and, as he tried to turn,he slipped on horse manure. Through mighty effort and sheer skill, he managed tokeep his balance and remain upright. Oba had spent years in such slop, carryingheavy loads, tending animals, and running when his mother yelled for him. He hadhad to do it in all kinds of conditions, too, including icy weather.In a way, all those years of effort had been practice that had prepared Oba formaking the corner when no other man his size and weight would have stood achance. He made it, and in a smooth and swift fashion that was shocking to thethief. As Clovis glanced back with a mocking grin, apparently expecting that Obawas down for sure, he looked stunned to see instead Oba’s full weight bearingdown on him at full speed.Clovis, obviously spurred on by the terror of knowing justice itself wasdescending on him, darted down another of the makeshift streets, a smaller andless peopled byway. But this time, Oba was right there behind him. He snatchedthe flapping rags at a shoulder, spinning Clovis around. The man stumbled. Hisarms windmilled awkwardly as he tried to keep his footing and escape at the sametime.Clovis’s eyes went wide. First from surprise, and then from the pressure of thehand that had clamped around his throat. Whatever sort of squeal or plea wastrying to make its way out didn’t get past Oba’s viselike fingers.Fatigue forgotten, Oba dragged the murderous little thief, kicking and twisting,back between two wagons. The wagons’ canvas tops shaded the narrow spacebetween. To the rear of the tight space was a tall wall of crates. Oba’s backblocked the constricted opening between the wagon beds, closing off the crampedspot from view as effectively as a prison door.Oba could hear people behind him going about their business, laughing andtalking as they hurried by in the brisk air. Others, in the distance, argued andbargained with merchants over the price of goods. Horses clopped past, theirtack jangling. Peddlers plied the streets, calling out the benefits of theirwares in a high-pitched singsong, trying to entice buyers.Only Clovis was silent, but not by choice. The hawker’s lying little mouthopened wide trying to say something. But as Oba lifted him clear of the groundand the man’s eyes rolled from side to side, it was clearly a scream for helptrying unsuccessfully to escape. With his feet kicking only air, Clovis pried atthe powerful fingers around his neck. His dirty fingernails broke backward as heclawed in desperation at the iron fist of justice. His eyes grew as big aroundas the gold marks he had stolen from Oba.Holding him aloft with one hand, pressing him against one of the heavy woodencrates in the back, Oba searched the man’s pockets, but found nothing. Clovisdesperately pointed at his chest. Oba felt a lump under the tattered layers ofrags and shirt. Ripping the shirt open, he saw his familiar fat purse hanging bya leather thong around the thief’s neck.A mighty pull burned the thong down into the man’s flesh until the leathersnapped.Oba slipped his pouch safely back into a pocket. Clovis tried to smile, to makean apologetic face as if to say that everything was square, now.Oba was long past forgiveness. His head pounded with rage unleashed. HoldingClovis’s shoulders up against the heavy wooden crates, Oba rammed his fist upinto the little man’s gut. Clovis was turning purple. Oba threw a heavy punchinto the dirty little face. He felt bone break. He whipped his elbow around andinto the lying, conniving little mouth and broke all the front teeth out. Obagrowled as he walloped the little weasel with three more rapid blows. With eachblow, Clovis’s head snapped back, his greasy hair throwing back blood each timethe back of his skull whacked the crates.Oba was furious. He had suffered the indignity of being a helpless victim of athief who had left him for dead. He had been attacked by a giant snake. He hadnearly been drowned. He had been taunted and tricked by Althea. She had lookedinto his soul without his permission. She had cheated him out of his answers,belittled him for making something of himself, and died before he could kill herbesides. He had suffered through a long march across the Azrith Plains dressedin rags-he, Oba Rahl, practically royalty. The utter indignity was humiliating.He was enraged and aptly so. He could hardly believe that he finally had theobject of that rightful anger at hand. He would not be denied just retribution.Holding Clovis down on the ground, with a knee pressed to the man’s chest, Obaat last let the full and rightful rage of vengeance free. He didn’t feel theblows any more than he felt the aches and pains he had come down with. He cursedthe murderous little thief as he dealt out justice, turning Clovis to a bloodypulp.Copious sweat poured down Oba’s face. He gasped for air as he slugged away. Hisarms felt like lead. As he became worn out, he felt his head pounding as hard ashis fists. He had trouble focusing on the target of his anger.The ground was soaked with blood. What had been Clovis was no longer remotelyrecognizable. His jaw was shattered and hung completely unhinged to the side.One eye socket had been altogether caved in. Oba’s knee had broken the man’ssternum and crushed his chest. It was glorious.Oba felt hands snatching his clothes and arms, pulling him back. He didn’t havethe strength left to try to stand. As he was dragged backward from between thewagons, he saw a crowd of people formed in a half circle-all stricken withhorror. Oba was pleased by that, because it meant that Clovis had gotten what hedeserved. Proper punishment for crimes should horrify people so as to serve asan example. That’s what his father would have said.Oba looked up, closer, at the men hauling him out from between the wagons. Awall of leather armor, chain mail, and steel had poured in to surround him.Pikes and swords and axes glinted in the sunlight. They were all pointing athim. He could only blink, too drained to lift a hand to wave them away.Exhausted, out of breath, and soaked in sweat, Oba couldn’t hold his head up. Ashe started to sag in the arms of the men holding him, blackness enveloped him."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40In a somber daze, Friedrich used the shovel to steady himself as he sank to hisknees. Sitting back on his heels, he let the shovel topple to the cold ground.The chill wind ruffled his hair as well as the long grasses around the freshlyturned soil.His world was ashes.Dazed with grief, his mind wouldn’t focus on any other thought.A sob overwhelmed him. He worried that he might not have done the right thing.It was cold, here. He worried that Althea would be cold. Friedrich didn’t wanther to be cold.But it was sunny, too. Althea loved sunlight. She always said that she liked thefeel of the sun on her face. Despite the heat in the swamp, the sunlight rarelymade it down to the ground, at least anywhere near where she could see it fromher confinement.To Friedrich, though, her hair was golden sunlight. She would always scoff atsuch sentiment, but occasionally, if he hadn’t mentioned it in a while, shewould innocently ask if he thought her hair was brushed enough and looked allright for visitors due for a telling. She always could keep her face blamelesswhen she was angling for what she wanted. Then, he would tell her that her hairlooked like sunshine. She would blush like an adolescent girl and say, “Oh,Friedrich.”Now, the sun would never shine for him again.He had considered what to do, and had decided this would be better for her-to beup here, in the meadow, out of the swamp. If he could never take her out of thatplace in life, at least he could take her out now. The sunny meadow was a betterplace to lay her to rest than in her former prison.He would have given anything to have taken her out before, to show her beautifulplaces again, to see her smile, carefree, in the sunlight. But she could notleave. For everyone else, including him, only the path in the front could besafely traversed. There was no other way past the dark things created of herpower. For her, there was not even that safe passage.Friedrich knew that the dire consequences for anyone who ventured anywhere elsein the swamp were not imaginary. Several times over the years, the unwary or thefoolhardy had wandered off the path, or tried to make it through the back way,where not even he dared go. It had been torturous for Althea, knowing that herpower had ended innocent lives. How Jennsen had made it in the back wayunharmed, not even Althea knew.For her last journey, Friedrich had carried Althea out that back way as a symbolof her freedom reclaimed.Her monsters were gone. She was with the good spirits, now.Now, he was alone.Friedrich bent forward in agony, sobbing over her fresh grave. The world wassuddenly an empty, lonely, dead place. His fingers clutched at the cold groundcovering his love. He felt crushing guilt that he had not been there to protecther. He was sure that if he had been there, she would still be alive. That wasall he wanted. Althea alive. Althea back. Althea with him.He had always delighted in returning home, such as it was, to tell her about anylittle thing he had seen-a bird skimming over a field, a tree with its leavesshimmering in the sunlight, a road lying like a ribbon over rolling hills,anything that would have brought a little of the world home to her in herprison.In the beginning, he hadn’t talked about the world beyond. He thought that if hetold her about the things he had seen outside her swamp, about what was suddenlyout of her reach, she would only feel more confined, more isolated, moreheartsick. Althea smiled that special smile of hers and said that she wanted tohear every detail of what he saw, because in that way she could deny Darken Rahlhis wish to confine her. She said that Friedrich was her eyes, and through them,she could escape her prison. With the descriptions Friedrich brought her,Althea’s mind soared up and away from her confinement. In that way, Friedrichhelped her deny that vile man his wish that she should never again see theworld.To that extent, Friedrich could feel good about leaving the swamp when she hadto remain behind. He wasn’t sure who was giving who the gift. Althea was likethat-making him think he was doing something for her, when it was she who wasreally helping him live his life in the best way he could.Now, Friedrich didn’t know what he would do. His life seemed suspended. He hadno life without Althea. She was a presence that had given him life, given himhimself, made him whole. Without her in his life, life was pointless.How her life had ended, Friedrich didn’t know for sure. The things he’d foundmade little sense to him. She hadn’t been touched, but the house had beenransacked. The strangest things had been taken; their entire lifetime ofsavings, along with food, a few odd supplies, and old clothing of little worth.Yet, other valuable items were left-gilded carvings, gold leaf, and tools. Tryas he might, Friedrich could make no sense or order out of it.The one thing he did understand was that Althea had poisoned herself. And, therehad been another cup. She had tried to poison someone else. Maybe someone whohad come for a telling, someone who hadn’t been invited.Friedrich realized, though, that Althea must have been expecting whoever it wasand had kept that knowledge from him, encouraging him to make a trip to thepalace to sell his gilded carvings. She had seemed somewhat insistent, and hehad thought that, since she had invited no visitors, she must have wanted to bealone for a while, which wasn’t entirely unusual, or perhaps she was justimpatient for him to take a little journey out into the world and see somesights since he hadn’t done so in a while. She had held his face in her hands asshe kissed him that last time. savoring the feel of him.Now he knew the truth. That long kiss had been her farewell. She had wanted himsafely out of the way.Friedrich reached in a pocket and pulled out the note she had left him. Shesometimes wrote notes for him-things she thought of while he was away, thingsshe wanted to remember to tell him. He had checked in the gilded cup he hadcarved for her, which she kept down on the floor under her chair behind thepillow she sat on, and was surprised to find a letter to him. He carefullyunfolded it and read it again, even though he had read it so many times that heknew every word by heart.My beloved Friedrich,I know that you can’t understand right now, but I want you to know that I havenot forsaken my duty to the sanctity of life-rather, I am fulfilling it. Irealize it won’t be easy for you, but you must trust me when I say that I had todo this. I am at peace. I have had a long life-longer by far than nearly anyother person is fortunate enough to have. But the best of it was the part Ilived with you. I have loved you almost since the day you walked into my lifeand awakened my heart. Do not let grief crush your heart; we will be together inthe next world and for all time. But in this world, you, like me, are one of thefibur protectors-the four stones at the corners on my Grace. You remember. Youasked who they were and I told you that Lathea and I were two of the stones inmy last telling. I wish I could have told you then that you are one as well, butI dared not. I am blind to much of what is happening, but with what I do know, Imust do what I can or the chance for others to live and love would be foreverlost. Know that you are always in MY heart, and will be even when I cross theveil to be with the good spirits.The world of life needs you, Friedrich. Your part in this has yet to begin. Ibeg of you that when you are called upon, you will fulfill that purpose.Yours for eternity, Althea.Friedrich wiped the tears from his cheeks and then read Althea’s words again.When he read, he could hear her voice in his head, speaking to him, almost as ifshe were right there beside him. He feared to let go of that voice, but at last,he carefully folded the note and returned it to his pocket. When he looked up, atall man was standing before him. “I was an acquaintance of Althea’s.” Hispowerful voice was solemn and earnest. “I’m terribly sorry for your loss. I cameto pay my respects and to offer my sympathy.” Friedrich slowly rose to his feet,watching the older man’s dark azure eyes. “How could you know? How do you knowwhat happened?” Friedrich’s anger rose, too. “What part have you played inthis?”“The part of a sad witness to that which I cannot change.” The man, much olderbut vigorous-looking, laid a hand on Friedrich’s shoulder, squeezing in a gentlemanner. “I knew Althea from long ago, when she came to study at the Palace ofthe Prophets.”“You didn’t answer my question. How did you know?”“I am Nathan, the prophet.”“Nathan, the prophet ... Nathan Rahl? Wizard Rahl?”The man nodded as he took his hand away, letting his arm slip back under theedge of his open, dark brown cape. Friedrich dipped his head out of deference,but couldn’t muster the concern to do more, to bow, even if he was in thepresence of a wizard, even if this wizard was a Rahl.The man wore brown wool trousers and high boots, not the robes of a wizard. Forthe most part, he didn’t look like what Friedrich expected of a wizard, and helooked not at all like a man Althea had said was close to a thousand years old.His strong jaw was clean-shaven. His straight white hair was long enough totouch his broad shoulders. He was not stooped with age, but had the fluidposture of a swordsman, though he wore no sword, and the effortless bearing ofauthority.His eyes, though, so piercing from under his hawkish brow, were what Friedrichwould expect of such a man. They were the eyes of a Rahl.Friedrich felt a twinge of jealousy. This man knew Althea long before Friedrichhad met her, back when she was young and exquisitely beautiful, a sorceress atthe prime of her power and ability, a woman sought after, a woman courted bymany a great man. A woman who knew what she wanted and went after it with fiercepassion. Friedrich wasn’t so naive as to believe he was the first man in herlife.“I spoke with her briefly a few times,” Nathan said, as if in answer toquestions unspoken, making Friedrich wonder if a man of this ability could alsoread minds. “She had an exceedingly talented gift for prophecy-at least for asorceress. Compared, though, to a true prophet, she was but a child trying toplay at adult games.” The wizard softened his words with a kindly smile. “Thatis not to discount at all her heart or intellect, but merely to put it intoperspective.”Friedrich looked away from the man’s eyes, back to the grave. “Do you know whathappened?” When no answer came, he gazed back up at the tall man watching him.“And if you knew, could you have stopped her?”Nathan considered the question for a moment. “Did you ever know Althea to beable to alter that which she saw when she cast her stones?”“I guess not,” Friedrich admitted.A few times, he had held her as she wept with the sorrow of wishing she couldchange something she saw. She had often told him when he asked about it, orasked what could be done, that such things were not as simple as they seemed tothose without the gift. While Friedrich couldn’t understand many of thecomplexities of her ability, he did know that at times the burden of prophecynearly crushed her with anguish.“Do you know why she would have done this?” Friedrich asked, hopeful for someexplanation that might make the pain more bearable. “Or who it was that broughther to it?”“She made the choice of how she would die,” Nathan said in simple summation.“You must trust that she made that choice of her own free will and for soundreasons. You must understand that what she did was not only done because it wasthe best for her, and for you, but for others as well.”“Others? What do you mean?”“You both know what love brings to life. By her choice, she was doing what shecould so that others might have their chance to know life and love.”“I still don’t understand.”Nathan gazed off distantly as he slowly shook his head. “I know only bits ofwhat is happening, Friedrich. In this, I feel blind in a way I have never feltbefore.”“You mean, this has to do with Jennsen?”Nathan’s brow twitched as his eyes focused abruptly and intently on Friedrich.“Jennsen?” His voice was laced with suspicion.“One of the holes in the world. Althea said that Jennsen is a daughter of DarkenRahl.”The wizard drew back his cape and propped a hand on his hip. “So, that was hername. Jennsen.” His mouth turned up with a private smile. “I’ve never heard thatterm, hole in the world, but I can see how apt it would seem to a sorceress’srestricted gift.” He shook his head. “Despite her talent, Althea couldn’t beginto comprehend what is involved with those like Jennsen. The inability of thegifted to recognize aspects of their existence, and so referring to them as ahole in the world, is but the tail of the bull. The tail is the least importantpart. ‘Hole’ is not even really accurate. I should think ‘void’ would bebetter.”“I’m not so sure you’re right about her not comprehending. Althea was involvedwith those like Jennsen for a long time. She may have been more aware than yourealize. She explained to Jennsen and me that she didn’t know any more, but thatthe most important part was that the gifted were blind to them.”Nathan grunted a short chuckle of respect for the woman buried before them. “Oh,Althea knew more, much more. This hole-in-the-world business was but windowdressing for what Althea knew.”Friedrich dared not contradict the wizard, for he knew how sorceresses keptsecrets, never revealing the true extent of what they knew. Althea did this,too. Even to Friedrich. He knew that it wasn’t a lack of respect, or love, butjust the way sorceresses were. He couldn’t be offended by what was simply hernature.“So, there is more about those like Jennsen, then?”“Oh, yes. This bull has horns, not just a tail.” Nathan sighed. “But despite thefact that I understand much of what Althea did not, even I don’t begin to knowenough to claim to grasp all of what is truly involved in the events beginningto unfold. This part of prophecy is obscured. I know enough, though, to knowthat this can alter the very nature of existence.”“You’re a Rahl. How could you not know of such things?”“At a very young age I was taken away to the Old World by the Sisters of theLight and imprisoned there in the Palace of the Prophets. I am a Rahl, but inmany ways I know little of my ancestral homeland of D’Hara. Much of what I know,I learned through books of prophecy.“Prophecy is silent about those like Jennsen. I only recently have begun todiscover why, and the dire consequences.” He clasped his hands behind his back.“So, this girl, Jennsen, came to see Althea? How did she know of Althea?”“Yes. Jennsen was the cause of . . .” Friedrich’s gaze fell away from the manwatching him, not knowing how he would feel about his kinsman, but then hedecided to say it, even if it brought the man’s wrath. “When Jennsen was young,Althea tried to help protect her from Darken Rahl. Darken Rahl crippled Altheafor it, and imprisoned her in the swamp. He stripped her of her power, exceptfor that of prophecy.”“I know,” Nathan whispered, clearly in sorrow. “Although I never knew the causesbehind it, I saw some of it foretold.”Friedrich took a step forward. “Then why would you not help her?”This time, it was Nathan’s gaze that broke away. “Oh, but I did. I wasimprisoned there at the Palace of the Prophets when she came to see me-”“Imprisoned for what?”“Imprisoned for the unjust fears of others. I am a rarity, a prophet. I amfeared as an oddity, as a madman, as a savior, as a destroyer. All because I seethings others don’t. There are times when I cannot help but to try to changewhat I see.”“If it’s prophecy, how can it be changed? If you changed it, it would be untrue.Then it wouldn’t be prophecy.”Nathan stared off at the cold sky, the wind lifting his long hair back away fromhis face. “I could never explain it adequately to one such as you, one ungifted,but I can explain a small part of it in this way. There are books of prophecygoing back thousands of years. Those books contain events that have not yethappened. In order for free will to exist, there must be questions left open.This is done partly through forked prophecies.”“Forked prophecies? You mean that events could go one of two ways?”Nathan nodded. “At the least-often many ways. Key events, anyway. The books willoften contain a line of prophecy for several outcomes that could result fromfree will. When a particular fork proves to be the one that actually takesplace, one line of prophecy will be true while others, at that moment, becomeinvalid. Up until then, they were all viable. Had another choice been made, thatfork would have turned out to be the valid prophecy. Instead, that branch ofprophecy withers and dies, even though the book with that line of prophecyremains. Prophecy is thus tangled with the deadwood of ages past, with all thechoices not made, the things that never came to be.”Friedrich’s anger rose again. “And so you knew what would happen to Althea? Youmean you could have warned her?”“When she came to me, I told her of a fork. I didn’t know when she would reachit, but I knew that death waited down both paths. With the information I gaveher, she would be able to know when the time was at hand. I had hoped that,somehow, she could find a way around what I saw. Sometimes there are shroudedforks that we are unaware of. I was hoping that was the case this time and shemight find it, if it existed.”Friedrich was incredulous. “You could have done something! You might haveprevented what happened!”Nathan lifted a hand toward the grave. “This is the result of trying to changewhat will be. It does not work.”“But maybe if-”Nathan’s hawklike glare rose in warning. “For your own peace of mind, I willtell you this, but no more. Down the other path was a murder so torturous, sobloody, so painful, so violent, that when you discovered what was left of her,you would have ended your own life rather than continue to live with what youhad seen. Be thankful that did not happen. It did not happen-not because shefeared that death more, but in part because she loved you and didn’t want you tosuffer that.” Nathan gestured to the grave again. “She chose this path.”“This was that fork you told her of, then?”Nathan’s glare softened. “Not exactly. The fork she took was that she would die.She chose how.”“You mean ... she might have chosen another fork, a path in which she wouldlive?”Nathan nodded. “For a time. But had she chosen that path, we would all soon bein the Keeper’s clutches. Because of those involved, I know only that down thatpath everything ended. The choice she made was that there would still be achance.”“A chance? A chance for what?”Nathan sighed. Friedrich suspected that the sigh reflected things more grave,more sweeping, than anything Althea had ever seen.“Althea bought us all time that others might make the right choices when thetime comes for them to act of their free will. This knot of forks in prophecy isobscured unlike any other, but most of the threads lead to nothing. ““To nothing? I don’t understand. What could that mean?”“Existence is at stake.” Nathan’s eyebrow lifted. “Most of those prophecies endin a void, in the world of the dead-for everything.”“But you can see the way though?”“The tangle ahead is a mystery to me. In this, I feel helpless. In this, I knowwhat it feels like to be ungifted and blind. In this, I might as well be. Ican’t even see all of those who are making the critical choices.”“It must be Jennsen. Maybe if you found her ... but Althea said the gifted areblind to the ungifted offspring of Darken Rahl.”“Of any Rahl. The gift is of no use in locating such truly ungifted offspring.There is no telling where they are. Unless you could gather all the people inthe entire world and parade them before the gifted, there would be no practicalway to detect them with the gift. Physical proximity is the only means for thegift to tell you who they are-because your eyes and your gift don’t agree-likewhen I saw Jennsen by accident.”“You think, then, that Jennsen is somehow involved in this?”Nathan threw his cape closed against the bitter wind. “As far as the propheciesare concerned, those like Jennsen don’t even exist. I have no way of telling ifthere are others, and if there are, how many there might be. I have no idea whatpart any of them play in this. I know only that they somehow play a pivotalrole.“I know some of what is involved, and some of those who will stand at criticalforks in prophecy. As I said, though many of those forks in prophecy areobscured.”“But you’re a prophet-a true prophet, according to Althea; how could you notknow what prophecy says if the prophecy exists?”Nathan gauged him from behind intent azure eyes. “Try to understand what I willtell you. It’s a concept that few people can grasp. Perhaps it can help you inyour grief, for it is the point at which Althea found herself. “Friedrich nodded. “Tell me, then.”“Prophecy and free will exist in tension. They exist in opposition. Yet, theyinteract. Prophecy is magic, and all magic needs balance. The balance toprophecy, the balance that allows prophecy to exist, is free will.”“That makes no sense. They would cancel each other.”“Ah, but they don’t,” the prophet said with a sly, knowing smile. “They areinterdependent and yet they are antithetical. Just as Additive and SubtractiveMagic are opposite forces, they both exist. They each serve to balance theother. Creation and destruction, life and death. Magic must have balance tofunction. Prophecy functions by the presence of its counter: free will.”“You’re a prophet, and you’re telling me that free will exists, making prophecyinvalid?”“Does death invalidate life? No, it defines it, and in so doing creates itsvalue.”In the silence, none of it seemed to matter. It was too hard for Friedrich tofathom just then. Besides, it changed nothing for him. Death had come to takeAlthea’s precious life. Her life was all the value he had had. His anguishpoured back in to flood everything else. For Friedrich, it had already allended. There was nothing ahead but blackness.“I came for another reason,” Wizard Rahl said in a quiet voice. “I must callupon you to help in this struggle.”Too tired to stand anymore, too grief-stricken to care, Friedrich sank back tothe ground beside Althea’s grave. “You have come to the wrong person. ““Do you know where Lord Rahl is?”Friedrich looked up, squinting against the bright sky. “Lord Rahl?”“Yes, Lord Rahl. You are D’Haran. You should know.”“I guess I can feel the bond.” Friedrich gestured off to the south. “He’s thatway. But it’s weak. He must be a great distance. Greater than I’ve ever felt ofa Lord Rahl in all my life.”“That’s right,” Nathan said. “He’s in the Old World. You must go to him.”Friedrich grunted. “I’ve no money for a journey. “ It seemed the easiest reason.Nathan tossed down a leather pouch. It hit the ground before Friedrich with aheavy muffled clunk. “I know. I’m a prophet, remember? This is more than wastaken from you.”Friedrich tested the weight of the bag. It was indeed heavy. “Where did all thiscome from?”“The palace. This is official business, so D’Hara will supply you with the moneyyou will need.”Friedrich shook his head. “I thank you for coming and offering your sympathy.But I’m the wrong man. Send another.”“You are the man who is to go. Althea would have known it. She would have leftyou a letter, telling you that you are needed in this struggle. She would haveasked you to accept when called upon. Lord Rahl needs you. I am calling uponyou.”“You know of the letter?” Friedrich asked as he rose to his feet once more.“It’s one of the precious few things I know about in this matter. From prophecy,I know you are the one to go. But you must do so of your own free will. I amcalling upon you to do so.”Friedrich shook his head, this time with more conviction. “I’m not the one to dothis. You don’t understand. I’m afraid that I just don’t care anymore. “Nathan drew something out from under his cloak. He held it out. Friedrich sawthen that it was a small book.“Take it,” the wizard commanded, his voice suddenly full and rich withauthority.Friedrich did so, letting his fingers roam the ancient leather cover as heinspected words embossed with gold leaf. There were four words on the cover, butFriedrich had never seen the language before.“This book is from the time of a great war, thousands of years ago,” Nathansaid. “I only just discovered it in the People’s Palace after a frantic searchamong the thousands of tomes there. As soon as I located it, I rushed here. Ihaven’t had time to translate it, so I don’t even know what’s written in it.”“It’s all written in a different language.”Nathan nodded. “High D’Haran, a language I helped teach Richard. It’s vitallyimportant he get this book.”“Richard?”“Lord Rahl.”The way he said those two words gave Friedrich a chill. “If you’ve not read it,how do you know it’s the right book?”“By the title, there, on the front.”Friedrich ran his fingers lightly over the mysterious words. The gilding wasstill good after all this time. “May I ask the book’s title?”“The Pillars of Creation. “"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41Oba opened his eyes, but for some reason that didn’t seem to help; he couldn’tsee. Dismay stiffened him. He was lying on his back, on something like roughcold stone. It was a complete mystery to him as to where he could be or how hehad gotten there, but his first and most important concern was that he hadsomehow gone blind. Trembling from head to foot, Oba blinked, trying to clearhis vision, but still he could not see.A thought worse by far was what really ignited his panic: he wondered if he wasback in the pen.He feared to move and prove the suspicion true. He didn’t know how they had doneit, but he despaired that those three conniving women-the troublesome sorceresssisters and his lunatic mother-had somehow managed to once again lock him in hisdark, childhood prison. They had probably been plotting from beyond the grave,and in his sleep, they had pounced.Paralyzed by his plight, Oba couldn’t gather his wits.But then, he heard a noise. He turned his eyes toward the sound and sawmovement. He realized as things came into focus that it was only some dark roomand not his pen, after all. Relief washed through him, followed by chagrin. Whathad he been thinking? He was Oba Rahl. He was invincible. It would serve himwell to remember that.Though he was relieved to know it wasn’t what he had at first feared, prudencekept him cautious; the place felt strange and dangerous. He concentrated, tryingto recall what had taken place and how he could have come to be in such a colddark place, but it wouldn’t come to him. His memory was all foggy, just acollection of random impressions; dizzying illness, pounding headache, profoundweakness and nausea, being carried, hands everywhere on him, light hurting hiseyes, darkness. He felt battered and bruised.Someone nearby coughed. From another direction, a man grumbled at him to shutup. Oba lay still as a mountain lion, his muscles tensed. He worked at gatheringhis senses, letting his gaze carefully roam the dark room. It wasn’t completelydark, as he had feared at first. On the wall opposite him a weak light, possiblywavering candlelight, came in through a square opening. There were two darkvertical lines in the opening.Oba’s head still pounded, but it was much better than it had been before. Heremembered, then, how sick he had been. Looking back on it, he realized that hehadn’t even grasped at the time how truly ill he had been. As a youngster he’dhad a fever, once. This had been like that, he supposed, a fever. He hadprobably gotten it visiting Althea, the awful swamp-witch.Oba sat up, but that made him feel light-headed, so he leaned back against thewall. It was rough stone, like the floor. He rubbed his cold, stiff legs, andthen stretched his back. He wiped his knuckles across his eyes, trying to banishthe lingering haze in his head. He saw rats, whiskers twitching, nosing alongthe edge of the wall. Oba was starving, despite the rank stench of the place. Itsmelled of sweat and urine and worse.“Look, the big ox is awake,” someone across the room said. The voice was deepand mocking.Oba peered up and saw men looking at him. Altogether, there were five others inthe room with him. They looked a scruffy lot. The man who had spoken, off in thecorner to the right, was the only other man beside Oba sitting. He leaned backinto the corner as if he owned it. His humorless grin showed that what teethweren’t missing were crooked as could be.Oba looked around at the other four men standing watching him. “You all looklike criminals,” he said.Laughter echoed around the room.“We’re all being wrongly persecuted,” the man in the corner said.“Yeah,” someone else agreed. “We were minding our own business when those guardssnatched us up and threw us in here for nothing at all. They locked us up likewe was common criminals.”More laughter rang out.Oba didn’t think he liked being in a room with criminals. He knew he didn’t likebeing locked in a room. That felt too much like his pen. A cursory inspectionproved his suspicion true, his money was gone. From across the room, under thecrack of the door, a rat watched with beady little rat eyes.Oba looked up from the rat, to the opening with the light. He saw then that thetwo lines were bars.“Where are we?”“In the palace prison, you big ox,” crooked-teeth said. “Does it look like aproper whorehouse to you?”The other men all laughed at his joke. “Maybe the kind he visits,” one of themsaid, and the rest laughed all the louder. Over to the side, another ratwatched.“I’m hungry. When will they feed us?” Oba asked.“He’s hungry,” one of the standing men said in a taunting voice. He spat indisgust. “They don’t feed us unless they feel like it. You might starve, first.”Another man squatted in front of him. “What’s your name?”“Oba.”“What did you do to get yourself thrown in here, Oba? Rob an old maid of hervirginity?”The men guffawed with him.Oba didn’t think the man was funny. “I didn’t do anything wrong, “ he said. Hedidn’t like these men. They were criminals.“So, you’re innocent, eh?”“I don’t know why they would put me in here.”“We heard different,” the man squatting before him said.“Yeah,” the keeper of the corner agreed. “We heard the guards talking, sayingthat you beat a man to death with your bare hands.”Oba frowned in true bewilderment. “Why would they put me in here for that? Theman was a thief. He left me out in a desolate place to die after he’d robbed me.He only got what was coming to him.”“Says you,” crooked-teeth said. “We heard you was probably the one robbing him.”“What?” Oba was incredulous, as well as indignant. “Who said that?”“The guards,” came the answer.“They’re lying, then,” Oba insisted. The men started in laughing again. “Cloviswas a thief and a murderer.”The laughter cut off. Rats stopped and looked up. They sniffed the air, theirnoses twitching.The keeper of the corner sat up straight “Clovis? Did you say Clovis? You meanthe man who sold charms?”Oba ground his teeth at the memory. He wished he could pound on Clovis somemore.“That’s the one. Clovis the hawker. He robbed me and left me for dead. I didn’tkill him, I measured out justice. I should be rewarded for it. They can’timprison me for administering justice to Clovis-he deserved it for his crimes.”The man in the corner rose up. The other men closed in.“Clovis was one of us,” crooked-teeth said. “He was a friend of ours.”“Really?” Oba said. “Well, I pounded him to a bloody pulp. If I’d have had time,I’d have cut some tender pieces off of him before I mashed his head. ““Pretty brave, for a big fellow, when it comes to beating a hunched little manwho’s all alone,” one of the men said under his breath.Another of the men spat at him. Oba’s anger sprang to life. He reached for hisknife, but found it missing.“Who took my knife? I want it back. Which one of you thieves stole my knife?”“The guards took it.” Crooked-teeth snickered. “You really are a dumb oaf,aren’t you?”Oba glared up at the man standing in the center of the room, fists at his sides,his crooked teeth making his lips look lumpy. The man’s powerful barrel chestrose and fell with each seethed breath. His shaved head made him look to be atroublemaker. He took another step toward Oba.“That’s what you are-a big oaf. Oba the oaf.”The others laughed. Oba simmered as he listened to the voice counseling him. Hewanted to cut the tongues out of these men and then go to work on them. Obapreferred doing such things to women, but these men were earning it, too. Itwould be fun to take his time and watch them squirm, to make them cry, to watchthe look in their eyes as death entered their convulsing bodies.As the men closed in around him, Oba remembered that he didn’t have his knife,so he couldn’t have the kind of fun he would have liked to. He needed to get hisknife back. He was tired of this place. He wanted out.“Stand up, Oba the oaf,” crooked-teeth growled.A rat scurried across in front of him. Oba slapped a hand down on its tail. Therat tugged and twisted, but couldn’t get away. Oba snatched the furry thing upin his other hand. It wriggled, wrenching this way and that, trying to escape,but Oba had a good grip on it.As he stood, he bit off the rat’s head. When he had reached his full height, agood head taller than crooked-teeth, he glared into the eyes of the men aroundhim. The only sound was bones crunching as Oba chewed the rat’s head.The men backed away.Oba, still chewing, went to the door and peered out the barred opening. He sawtwo guards standing at the intersection of a nearby hall, talking quietly.“You there!” he called out. “There has been a mistake! I need to speak withyou!”The two men paused in their conversation. “Oh yeah? What’s the mistake?” oneasked.Oba’s gaze moved between the two, but it was not just his gaze. The gaze of thething that was the voice also watched from within him.“I am brother to Lord Rahl.” Oba knew that he was saying aloud what he had neversaid to a stranger before, but he felt compelled to do so. He was somewhatsurprised to hear himself go on as everyone watched him. “I am falselyimprisoned for measuring out justice to a thief, as is my duty. Lord Rahl willnot stand for this false imprisonment. I demand to see my brother.” Oba glaredat the two guards. “Go get him!”Both men blinked at what they saw in his eyes. Without further word, they left.Oba glanced back at the men locked in with him. As he met each man’s eyes inturn, he gnawed a hind leg off the limp rat. They moved aside for him to pace ashe chewed, little rat bones crunch, crunch, crunching. He looked out the openingagain, but saw no one else. Oba sighed. The palace was immense. It might be sometime before the guards returned to let him out.The men in the room with him silently backed out of the way as Oba went back tohis spot against the wall opposite the door and sat down. They stood watchinghim. Oba watched back as he tore another chunk off the rat with the teeth at theside of his mouth.They were all fascinated by him, he knew. He was almost royalty. Maybe he wasroyalty; he was a Rahl. They had probably never seen anyone as important as himbefore, and were in awe.“You said they don’t feed us.” He waved what was left of the limp rat at theirsilent stares. “I’ll not starve.” He pulled off the tail and discarded it.Animals ate rat tails. He was hardly an animal.“You’re not just an oaf,” crooked-teeth said in a quiet voice filled withcontempt, “you’re a crazy bastard.”Oba exploded across the room and had the man by the throat before anyone couldso much as gasp in surprise. Oba lifted the squealing, kicking, crooked-toothedcriminal up to where he could glare eye to eye. Then, with a mighty shove, Obarammed him against the wall. The man went as limp as the rat.Oba looked back and saw that the others had backed against the far wall. He letthe man slip to the floor, where he moaned as he comforted the back of hisshaved head. Oba lost interest. He had more important things to think about thanbashing this man’s brains out, even if he was a criminal.He went back to his place and lay down on the cold stone. He had been ill andmight not be fully recovered; he had to take care of himself. He needed hisrest.Oba lifted his head. “When they come for me, wake me up,” he told the four menstill silently watching him. It amused him to see how fascinated they were byhaving nobility in their midst. Still, they were common criminals; he would havethem executed.“There’s five of us and only one of you,” one of the men said. “What makes youthink you’ll ever wake up again after you close your eyes?” There was nomistaking the threat in his voice.Oba grinned up at him.The voice grinned with him.The man’s eyes widened. He swallowed and backed away until his shoulders smackedthe wall; then he shuffled sideways. When he reached the far corner, he sliddown and pulled his knees up close to himself. Whimpering, tears running downhis cheeks, he turned his face away and hid his eyes behind a tremblingshoulder.Oba laid his head down on his outstretched arm and went to sleep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42The footsteps coming from beyond the door woke Oba from his nap. He opened hiseyes, but he didn’t move or make a sound. The men were peeking out the openingin the door.When the distant footsteps sounded like they began coming closer, all but oneman moved back. The single man remained at the door, standing watch. Hestretched up on his toes, gripped the bars, and pressed his face close, tryingto get a better look down the hall. Off in the distance, Oba could hear themetallic clangs and echoing squeals of doors being unlocked and pulled opened.The man at the door remained motionless for a time as he watched, then hesuddenly stepped back.“They turned this way-they’re coming this way,” he whispered to the others.All five of the men huddled closer on the far side of the room. Whispers passedamong them.“But what if a Mord-Sith comes in, instead,” one of the men whispered.“Makes no difference to us,” another man said. “I know some about their kind.Their magic works to capture those with the gift. It makes them safe from magic,not muscle.”“But their weapon will still work on us,” the first said.“Not if we all overpower her and take it away from her,” came the insistentwhisper in answer. “There are five of us. We’re stronger and we outnumber her.”“But what if-”“What do you think they’re going to do with us?” one of the others whispered ina heated voice. “If we don’t take this chance, we’re as good as dead in here. Idon’t see what other chance we have. I say we do it and get away.”There were nods in turn from each man. Satisfied, they straightened and movedoff to different parts of the room, making it appear as if they wanted nothingto do with one another. Oba knew they were up to something.One man took a quick check out the opening again, then moved away from the door.One of the other men came closer and jostled Oba with the side of his foot.“They’re back. Wake up. You hear?”Oba moaned, feigning sleep.The man nudged with his foot again. “You wanted us to tell you when they cameback. Wake up, now.” He stepped away when Oba stirred, yawning and stretching topretend he was just then waking. The men, all except the one who had alreadyseen more than he wanted to see in Oba’s eyes, glanced his way before theysettled on a spot to stand. While they waited, they struck slouching poses,trying hard to appear detached and disinterested.Down the passageway, two people spoke in words Oba couldn’t quite make out, buthe could hear their voices well enough to tell that their brief conversation wasno more than businesslike. The footsteps finally stopped just outside the door.A key turned in the lock. The clang from the bolt as it snapped back echoedthrough the hall. The men cast quick glances to the door. Outside, a man gruntedwith the effort of a strong tug. The door grated as it yielded, admitting morelight.Oba was astonished to see a woman silhouetted in the doorway.Outside, in the hall, the big guard with her used the candle from a holder onthe wall to light his lamp. While the woman stood just inside the door, casuallyappraising the men to each side, the guard brought the lamp into the room andhung it on the wall to the side. The lamp threw harsh light across the men’sfaces and revealed the grim impenetrable reality of the confines of therough-hewn stone room.Oba saw then, too, what a truly mean and nasty-looking lot the men were. Withcunning animal eyes glinting out from the shadows, they all watched the woman.In the bleak lamplight, Oba saw that she was wearing the strangest outfit he hadever seen-skintight red leather. Tall and shapely, she wore her long blond hairin a single braid. Something dangled from a thin chain around her right wrist asher hand rested on her hip. Though she was not taller than the men, hercommanding presence alone made her seem to tower, like some austere fury come tojudge the living in their last hours.Her scowl was as dark with displeasure as any Oba’s mother had ever worn. ButOba was even more astonished to see her signal with a casual flip of her hand,dismissing the guard who had unlocked the door. If it surprised Oba, it didn’tfaze the guard. After a last glance around at the men, he pulled the heavy doorclosed behind himself and locked it. Oba could hear the guard’s boots againstthe stone floor as he departed back down the hall.The woman’s cool scrutiny swept over the men around her, appraising each,dismissing each, until at last her glare descended on Oba. Her piercing starecarefully studied his face.“Dear spirits . . .” she whispered to herself at what she saw in his eyes.Eyes.Oba grinned. He knew she recognized that he was telling the truth about hispaternity. She could see in his eyes that he was the son of Darken Rahl.Eyes.Understanding suddenly clicked into place for him like a knife into its sheath.And then, bellowing like animals, the men all leaped toward her. Oba expectedher to cry out in fright, or scream for help, or at least flinch. Instead, shestood her ground and casually met their attack.Oba saw some kind of red rod, the one he had seen before hanging near her hand,spin up into her fist. As the first man reached her, she rammed the rod againsthis chest, pushing him back with a twist of her wrist. He dropped like a haybale out of the loft-thud, onto the stone floor.Nearly at the same time, the others pounced from all directions in a fluffy offlailing arms and fists. The woman sidestepped, effortlessly avoiding the trapof meaty arms as it snapped shut. As the men lurched around, hastily trying torenew their attack, she moved with cold grace, meeting each man swiftly andmethodically, and with staggering violence.Without turning, she drove her elbow back into the face of the closest man as hetried to seize her from behind. Oba heard bone crack as his head snapped back,throwing a long string of blood against the wall.The third man, to the side, was checked by her strange red rod against his neck.He crumpled, holding his throat, crying out in a choking gurgling blubber. Bloodfrothed at his mouth as he twisted on the floor, reminding Oba of nothing somuch as the way the snake in the swamp had wriggled in death. Eluding anotherlunge, the woman spun away, past and over the man on the floor. As she did so,she hammered the heel of her boot down, smashing his face to finish him.As she swung around, she delivered three rapid strikes to the neck of the fourthman. His eyes rolled back in his head before he slowly started corkscrewingdown. Her leg swept his feet from under him, pitching him face-forward. Hisforehead smacked the stone floor with a sickening crack.Her economy of motion, the easy flowing evasion followed by a swift and brutalcounterattack, was fascinating to watch.The last man flew at her with his full weight behind the lunge. She wheeledaround, backhanding him across the face so hard that it spun him around like atop. She snatched him by the hair at the back of his head, jerked him from hisfeet, and with a thrust of that strange red rod into his back, drove him to hisknees.It was crooked-teeth. He shrieked louder than Oba had ever been able to getanyone to shriek. Oba was amazed by her ability to inflict pain. She heldcrooked-teeth by the hair, on his knees before her, as he screamed in desperateagony, begging for release as he tried without effect to twist away from her.With a knee in his back, along with the red rod, she bent his head back tocontrol him as easily as if he were a child.And then, as she looked up very deliberately into Oba’s eyes, she pressed thered rod against the base of the man’s skull. His arms thrashed out in a crazyfashion as his entire body convulsed as violently as if he’d been struck bylightning. He went limp, blood running from his ears. Finished with him, thewoman released her fist from his hair and let him pitch forward to the stonefloor. It was clear to Oba by the boneless way he fell that he was already deadand didn’t feel the heavy impact against the unyielding stone.It was all over in what seemed like no more than five heartbeats, one for eachman killed. Blood everywhere glistened in the light from the lamp. All five menlay sprawled in awkward positions around the room. The woman in red leatherwasn’t even breathing hard.She stepped closer. “Sorry to disappoint you, but you won’t escape that easily.”Oba grinned. She wanted him.He reached out and grabbed her left breast.With a grimace of rage, she lashed her strange red rod down on the top of hisshoulder, beside his neck.Oba reached out with his other hand and grabbed her other breast. He gave them aboth a firm squeeze as he grinned at her.“How could you not-” She fell silent as some profound inner understandingsuddenly filled her expression.Oba liked her breasts. They were as nice as any he had ever held. Still, she wasquite the unusual woman. He had a feeling that he would learn many new thingswith her.Her fist came out of nowhere with deadly speed.Oba caught it in the palm of his hand. He closed his fingers tight around herfist, squeezing as he twisted it back, turning her around so that her back wasarched and her shoulders pressed against him. She rammed her free elbow towardhis middle, but he was expecting it and snatched her forearm, using the momentumto wrench it up behind her so he could gather it up with the fingers of hisother hand already holding her other arm.That left him a hand to feel the delights of her feminine form. He slid his freehand around the front of her waist, in under the leather. She twisted with allher strength, trying to get free. She knew how to use leverage to try to wrenchout of an opponent’s grip, but her strength wasn’t anywhere near up to the task.Oba slipped his hand down the front of her skintight leather pants, feeling hertaut flesh.The vixen drove her heel into his shin. Oba recoiled, crying out, just managingto hold on to her. But then she spun around, ducked under his arms, and brokehis grip. Quick as a blink, she was free.Rather than run, she used her momentum to strike at the side of his neck.Oba was able to partially deflect the blow at the last possible instant, but itstill hurt. More than that, it angered him. He was tired of playing gentlegames. He caught her arm, twisting it around until she cried out. He swept hisleg around to knock her feet out from under her first, then threw his fullweight into her. Oba roughly wrestled her around as they crashed to the floor,landing on top of her, driving the wind from her lungs. Before she could get abreath, he slammed a good punch into her middle. He could see in her eyes howmuch it hurt her.He was going to see much more in her eyes before he was done with her.As they struggled on the floor, Oba had the clear advantage, and used it. Hebegan tearing at her clothes. She had no intention of making it easy, and foughtwith everything she had. Her fighting, though, was unexpected in Oba’sexperience. She didn’t fight to get away, as other women did. She fought,instead, to hurt him.Oba knew, then, how desperately she wanted him.He intended to give her the satisfaction she craved, to give her what she hadnever been able to get from any man before.His powerful fingers pulled up on the top of her leather outfit, but it wascinched tight around her middle with a thick overbelt. The back of the outfitwas crisscrossed with a web of tight straps and buckles. It was too strong torip. Oba managed, instead, to strip it up past her ribs. The sight of her fleshignited him. He fought her hands, her feet, even her head as she tried to butthis face.Despite her best efforts, he managed to yank and tug the bottom of her tightoutfit partway down over the curve of her hips. She struggled ever moreviolently, trying every move she could to hurt him. He could sense that shewanted him so badly she was hardly able to control herself.As he was devoting his attention to trying to get her bottom off, her teethseized his other forearm. The shock of pain stiffened him. Instead of pullingback, he rammed the arm in her teeth at her, smacking the back of her headagainst the stone. The second whack against the stone floor took a lot of thefight out of her and he was able to free his arm.Oba didn’t want her unconscious. He wanted her awake. He watched her eyes as herolled on top of her, forcing his knee between her thighs, and was pleased tosee by the way she gritted her teeth, the way her eyes tracked his, that she wasindeed aware of him.Cognition was integral to the experience. It was important that she be aware ofwhat was happening to her, of the transformations that would take place in herliving body. Aware of death stalking near, waiting, watching. It was essentialto Oba that he see all her primal emotions and sensations through her expressiveeyes.He licked the side of her neck, back behind her ear where the fine little hairsfelt soft on his tongue. His teeth raked their way back down. Her neck tasteddelightful. He knew she liked the feel of his lips and teeth on her, but she hadto fight to keep up the pretense, lest he think her promiscuous. It was all partof her game. By the way she struggled, though, he knew how much she itched forhim. As he nuzzled her neck, he worked with his other hand to unbuckle histrousers.“You’ve always wanted it like this,” he whispered hoarsely, nearly deliriouswith his lust for her.“Yes,” she answered, breathlessly. “Yes, you understand.”This was new. He had never been with a woman before who was comfortable enoughwith her own needs to admit them aloud-except through the show of moans andcries. Oba realized that she must be frantic with desire to cast off pretenseand confess her true feelings. It drove him crazy with hunger for her.“Please,” she panted against the shoulder he had pressed to her jaw, holding herhead against the floor, “let me help you.”This was definitely new. “Help me?”“Yes,” she confided urgently up toward his ear. “Let me help you unfasten yourtrousers so that you’ll be free to touch me where I need it most.”Oba was eager to oblige her brazen desires. Leaving her to the treasured task ofopening his trousers left him free to grope her. She was a delightful creature-afitting mate to a man like him, a Rahl, almost a prince. He had never had such awonderfully unexpected and intimate experience. Apparently, knowing that he wasroyalty drove women delirious with uncontrollable yearnings. Oba grinned at hershameless need while her covetous fingers fumbled at unbuttoning his trousers.He shifted his weight to give her a little room for her work as he leisurelyexplored her feminine secrets.“Please,” she breathed in his ear again as she finally got his trousers undone,“let me hold you down there? Please?”She was so hot for him that she had completely abandoned her dignity. He had toadmit, though, that it didn’t put him off. Biting her neck, he grunted hispermission for her to go ahead. Oba lifted his hips so she could get at theobjects of her lewd desire. He moaned with pleasure as she stretched her lithebody to reach down under him. He felt her long cool fingers gathering up hismost private parts into her lovely hand.Driven by his unrestrained passion for her, Oba bit into her sumptuous neckagain. She moaned with the feel of his teeth as she urgently collected his sactogether in her greedy hand. He would reward her with the slowest death he couldgive her.She suddenly wrenched her handful around with such abrupt violence that as Obajerked up, he went blind with the shock.The lightning jolt of pain was so acute that he couldn’t draw a breath. While hewas momentarily immobilized by the trauma, she lunged lower and seized him in amore tenacious grip. Without pause, she mercilessly wrung him even more forciblythe second time. His eyes bulged as he convulsed but once, tenting over her, thespasm fixing his muscles into stiff, stark rigidity. His thinking scrambled. Hecouldn’t hear, see, breathe, or even cry out. He was paralyzed, ironbound inpure agony. Everything was one long, fiery-sharp, twisting pang. It went onwithout end. His mouth rounded, trying to scream, but no sound came out. Itseemed forever before blurred vision started to return, along with jumbledsounds that filled his ringing ears.The room suddenly spun wildly. Tumbling across the stone floor, Oba realized hehad been kicked in his side hard enough to drive the remaining wind from him. Itwas a complete mystery to him. He slammed into the wall and flopped to a stop.He had to pull hard several times before he could draw a breath. The painlancing his side felt like a cow had kicked him, but it was nothing compared tothe searing inferno in his groin.Then Oba saw the guard. The man had come back. That was who had kicked him inthe side. Him, not her. She was still sprawled on the floor, her lovely fleshexposed in a teasing manner.The guard had a sword to hand. He went to one knee near the woman, checking herwith quick glances.“Mistress Nyda! Mistress Nyda, are you all right?”She groaned as she tottered haltingly to her hands and knees while the man, in acrouch, feet spread, watched Oba. He looked like he feared to help her, to evenlook at her, but he didn’t look to fear Oba. Oba lay back against the wall,gathering his wits as he watched the two of them.She didn’t try to cover her hips, her exposed breasts. Oba knew that she wasstill game for him, but with the guard there, she couldn’t show her feelings.She must be insane with lust for him to have provoked him so by what she haddone.Oba pushed himself up a bit, getting his wind back, as the feeling beganreturning to his tingling extremities. He watched the woman, Mistress Nyda, theguard had called her-staggering to her feet.Oba lay still, listening to the voice whispering to him, as he watched sweat runacross her skin. She was divine. He still had much to learn from a woman likethis. There were pleasures untold yet to come.Still recovering his strength, Oba rose up, leaning against the wall, watchingas she provocatively used the back of one hand to wipe blood from her mouth.With her other hand, she tugged at her leather outfit, trying to cover herself.She was dazed, no doubt by her heady brush with lust, and was unable to get hertrembling hands to work right. Having trouble balancing, she staggered sidewaysa couple of steps. It appeared as if it was all she could do to stand. Oba wassurprised that her bones weren’t broken, considering their brief but vigorouslove tussle. There would be time for that.Blood trickled from the love bites on her neck. He noticed that her blond hairwas matted with blood from when he had banged her head against the stone floor.Oba reminded himself to be mindful of his strength, lest he end it prematurely.That had happened before. He had to be careful; women were delicate.Oba, still panting to catch his breath, still hobbled by the throbbing achebetween his legs, fixed his gaze on the guard. The man had remarkable control tostand there so confidently, considering that he was in the presence of a Rahl.Their gazes met. The man took a step forward.The eyes of the voice opened to look at him, too.The man froze.Oba grinned.“Mistress Nyda,” the guard whispered, his eyes staring, fixed on Oba, “I thinkyou’d better get out of here.”She frowned at him as she tried to pull her leather up over her shapely hips.She was still having trouble balancing, and trying to tug her outfit back intoplace wasn’t helping.“We don’t want her to leave,” Oba said.The guard’s wide eyes stared.“We don’t want her to leave,” Oba said again, in unison with the voice. “We canboth enjoy her.”“We don’t want her to leave . . .” the guard repeated.Pausing in her attempt to cover herself, Mistress Nyda looked from the guard toOba.“Bring her to me,” Oba commanded, amazed at what the voice could think of, anddelighted by the very notion. “Bring her over here, and we will both have her.”The woman, still unsteady, followed Oba’s gaze to the guard. When she saw hisface, she tried to snatch her dangling red rod. The guard seized her wrist,preventing her from getting at it. His other hand swept around her waist. Shefought him, but he was a big man, and she was already woozy.Oba grinned as he watched the guard dragging the struggling Nyda closer. Theman’s fingers roamed over her exposed flesh as Oba’s had done.“She feels delightful, don’t you think?” Oba asked.The guard smiled and nodded as he wrestled the woman toward the back of theprison cell where Oba and the voice waited.When they were close enough, Oba reached for her. It was time he finished whathe had started. Finished it good.She seized the guard’s clothes in her fists for support. With stunning speed,her whole body twisted in midair. From nowhere, for just an instant, Oba saw thebottom of the heel of her boot flying at his face like a bolt of lightning.Before he could react, the world went black amid a stunning crash of pain."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43Oba opened his eyes to darkness. He was lying on his back, on a stone floor. Hisface throbbed in pain. He drew his knees up and comforted his aching groin.That vixen, Nyda, had proven as troublesome as any woman he had ever known. Itseemed like he was always being tormented by troublesome women. They were alljealous of him, of his importance. They were all trying to keep him down.Oba was getting weary of waking up in cold dark places, too. He had hated theway, throughout his life, he was always waking up in some confined place. Theywere always hot or cold. No place he had ever been locked in was evercomfortable.He wondered if his lunatic mother, or the troublesome sorceress, Lathea, or herswamp-witch sister had something to do with this. They were selfish, and certainto be bent on revenge. This had all the markings of a vindictive act by thatpompous trio.But they were dead. Oba wasn’t entirely certain that death protected him fromthose three harpies. They were devious in life; death wasn’t likely to havereformed them.The more he thought about it, though, he had to admit that this was most likelyentirely the doing of that vixen in red leather, Nyda. She had cleverlypretended to be dizzy and disoriented until the guard had brought er closeenough to strike, and then she had kicked him. She was something. It was hard tohold a grudge against a woman who wanted him so badly. The thought of not havingOba exclusively probably drove her to it. She wanted to be alone with him. Hesupposed he couldn’t blame her.Now that he had publicly acknowledged his royal standing, Oba had to recognizethat there would be women of such intense passions who would want what he had tooffer. He had to be prepared to live up to the demands of being a true Rahl.Groaning in pain, Oba rolled over. With the aid of his hands, pushing firstagainst the floor and then a wall, he was finally able to lever himself upright.His own discomfort would only heighten the pleasures of the eventual conquest ofhis concubine. He had learned that somewhere. Maybe the voice had told him.He saw a small slit of light, much smaller than the opening in the door in thelast place, but it at least helped him get his bearings. Feeling along the coldstone walls, he began to take stock of the room. Almost immediately he came to acorner. He moved his hand sideways from the corner, along the rough stone of thewall, and was alarmed when he shortly come to another corner. With increasingurgency, he traced the walls and was horrified to discover how tiny the roomwas. He must have been lying corner to corner, for it wasn’t large enough forhim to lie down any other way.The suffocating terror of such a small place welled up, threatening to smotherhim. He couldn’t get his breath. He pressed a hand to his throat, tryingmightily to pull a breath. He was certain he would go mad being confined in sucha small pen.Maybe it wasn’t Nyda, after all. This did have all the marks of his insidiousmother’s doing. Perhaps she had been watching from the world of the dead,gleefully conniving, plotting how she could harass him. The troublesomesorceress had probably helped her. The swamp-witch had no doubt butted in tooffer her assistance. Together, the three women had managed to reach out fromthe world of the dead and help the vixen Nyda lock him back in a tiny place.He raced around the cramped little room, feeling the walls, terrified that theywere shrinking in toward him. He was too big to be in such a small room where hecouldn’t even breathe. Fearing he might use up all the air in the room and thenslowly suffocate, Oba threw himself against the door and pressed his face upagainst the opening, trying to suck in the outside air.Weeping with self-pity, Oba wanted nothing so much at that moment as to bash hislunatic mother’s head in all over again.After a time, he listened to the voice counseling him, reassuring him, calminghim, and began gathering his wits. He was smart. He had triumphed over all thosewho had conspired against him, despite how evil they were. He would get out. Hewould. He had to pull himself together and act up to his station in life.He was Oba Rahl. He was invincible.Oba put his eyes up to the slit to peer out, but he could see little more thananother dim space beyond. He wondered if maybe he was in a box inside a box, andfor a time he pounded at the door, screaming and crying at the terror of such asinister torture.How could they be so cruel? He was a Rahl. How could they do this to animportant person? Why would they treat him this way? First, they locked him upas a common criminal, in with the scum of humanity, for doing the right thingand dispensing justice to rid the land of a lawless thief, and now this wickedpersecution.Oba concentrated, putting his mind to something else. He remembered then thelook on Nyda’s face when she had first gazed into his eyes. She had recognizedhim for who he was. Nyda had known the truth, that he was the son of DarkenRahl, just by looking into his eyes. Small wonder she had wanted him so badly.He was important. Selfish people were like that; they wanted to be near thosewho were great, and then they wanted to keep them down. She was jealous. Thatwas why he was locked up-petty jealousy. It was as simple as that.Oba pondered that look in Nyda’s eyes when she had first seen him. The look ofrecognition on her face had sparked memories that enabled him to put odd bitstogether. He mulled over the new thing he had learned.Jennsen was his sister. They were both holes in the world.It was too bad she was kin; she was seductively beautiful. He thought herringlets of red hair were quite bewitching even if he worried that they mightsignify some magical ability. Oba sighed as he pictured her in his mind. He wastoo principled to consider her as a lover. They shared the same father, afterall. Despite her ravishing looks and the way thinking of her made his groinwake, if painfully, his integrity wouldn’t allow such a breach of decency. Hewas Oba Rahl, not some rutting animal.Darken Rahl had fathered her, too. That was a wonder. Oba wasn’t sure what hethought about that. They shared a bond. The two of them stood against a world ofjealous people who wanted to keep them from greatness. Lord Rahl sent quads tohunt her, so she would have no loyalty there. Oba wondered if it could be thatshe might be a valuable ally.On the other hand, he recalled the anxiety in her eyes when she looked at him.Maybe she recognized in his eyes who he was-that he, too, was the son of DarkenRahl, like she was. Maybe she already had plans of her own that didn’t includehim. Maybe she was upset that he existed. Maybe she, too, would be an adversary,intent on having it all for herself.Lord Rahl-their own brother-wanted to keep them down because they were bothimportant, that much seemed likely. Lord Rahl didn’t want to share all theriches that rightfully belonged to Jennsen and Oba. Oba wondered if Jennsenwould be as selfish. After all, such selfish tendencies seemed to run in thefamily. How Oba had avoided that wicked aspect of heritage was a wonder.Oba felt his pockets, recalling as he did so that he had done the same thingwhen he had been in the other room with the criminals, but his pockets wereempty. Lord Rahl’s people had stripped him of his wealth before locking himaway. They had probably taken it for themselves. The world was full of thieves,all after Oba’s hard-earned wealth.Oba paced, as best he could in such a confined place, trying not to think of howsmall it was. All the while he listened to the voice advising him. The more helistened, the more things made sense to him. More and more items on the mentallists he kept began falling into place. The grand tapestry of lies and deceptionthat had so afflicted him knitted itself together into a broader picture. And,solutions began to solidify.His mother had known all along, of course, how important Oba really was. She hadwanted to keep him down from the first. She had locked him in his pen becauseshe was jealous of him. She was jealous of her own little boy. She was a sickwoman. Lathea had known, too, and had conspired with his mother to poison him.Neither had the bold nerve to simply do away with him. They weren’t that kind.They both hated him for his greatness, and enjoyed making him suffer, so theirplan from the first appeared to have been to poison him slowly. They called it a“cure” so as to soothe their guilty consciences.All along, his mother wore him down with menial chores, treated him withcontempt, heaped endless scorn on him, and then sent him to Lathea to retrievehis own poison. Loving son that he was, he had gone along with their deviousplans, trusting in their words, their instructions, never suspecting that hismother’s love was a cruel lie, or that they might have a secret plan.The bitches. The conniving bitches. They had both gotten what they deserved.And now Lord Rahl was trying to hide him, to deny to the world that he existed.Oba paced, thinking it through. There was too much he still didn’t know.After a time, he calmed and did as the voice told him; he went to the door andput his mouth near the opening. He was, after all, invincible.“I need you,” he spoke into the darkness beyond.He didn’t shout the words-he didn’t have to, because the voice inside added tohis own would make it carry.“Come to me,” he said into the quiet emptiness outside the door.Oba was surprised by the calm confidence-the authority-in his own voice. Hisendless talents amazed him. It was only to be expected that those less endowedwould resent him.“Come to me,” he and the voice spoke into the empty darkness beyond.They had no need to yell. The darkness effortlessly bore their voices, likeshadows traveling on wings of gloom.“Come to me,” he said, bending unsuspecting inferior minds to his will.He was Oba Rahl. He was important. He had important things to do. He couldn’tstay in this place and play their petty games. He had had enough of thisnonsense. It was time to assume the mantle of not just his birthright, but hisspecial nature.“Come to me,” he said, their voices oozing through the dark cracks of the deepdungeon.He kept calling, not loudly, for he knew they could hear him, not urgently, forhe knew they would come, not desperately, for he knew they would obey. Timepassed, but did not matter, for he knew they were on their way.“Come to me,” he murmured into the still darkness, for he knew that a softervoice yet would draw them in.Off in the distance, he heard the faint answer of footsteps.“Come to me,” he whispered, enthralling those beyond to listen.He heard a door in the distance grate open. The footsteps grew louder, closer.“Come to me,” he and the voice cooed.Closer still, he heard men shuffling along a stone floor. A shadow in the dimlight fell across the small opening in the door beyond.“What is it?” a man asked, his echoing voice tentative.“You must come to me,” Oba told him.The man hesitated at so pure and innocent a declaration.“Come to me, now,” Oba and the voice commanded with deadly authority.As Oba listened, the key in the far lock turned. The heavy door rasped open. Aguard stepped into the space between the doors. The shadow of the other guardfilled the outer doorway. The guard edged closer to the small slit where Obawaited on the other side. Wide eyes peered in.“What do you want?” the man asked in a hesitant voice.“We wish to leave, now,” Oba and the voice said. “Open the door. It is time forus to go from here.”The man bent forward and worked at the lock until the bolt snapped back with ametallic clang that echoed in the darkness. The door pulled back, squeaking onrusty hinges. The other man stepped up behind him, looking in with the samelifeless expression.“What would you like us to do?” the guard asked, his eyes unblinking as hestared into Oba’s eyes.“We must leave,” Oba and the voice said. “You two will guide us out of here. “Both guards nodded and turned to lead Oba away from the dark pen. He would neveragain be locked in confining little places. He had the voice to help him. He wasinvincible. He was glad that he had remembered that.Althea had been wrong about the voice; she was just jealous, like all theothers. He was alive, and the voice had helped him. She was just dead. Hewondered how she liked that.Oba told the two guards to lock the doors of his empty cell. That would make itmore likely that it would be a while before he was discovered missing. He wouldhave a small head start to escape Lord Rahl’s greedy grasp.The guards led Oba through a labyrinth of narrow, dark passageways. The menmoved with unerring steps, avoiding those halls where Oba could hear men talkingin the distance. He didn’t want them to know he was leaving. Better if he simplyslipped away without a confrontation.“I need my money back,” Oba said. “Do you know where it is?”“Yes,” one of the guards said in a dead voice.They went through iron doors and onward through passageways lined with coarsestone blocks. They turned down a passageway where there were men in cells toeach side, coughing, snickering, cursing through the openings in the doors. Whenthey approached the row of doors, filthy arms reached out, clawing the air.As the somber guards, carrying lamps, led the way down the center of the widehall, men grabbed for them, or spat at them, or cursed them. As Oba passed, themen all fell silent. The arms drew back in through the openings. Shadows trailedbehind Oba like a dark cape.The three of them, Oba and his escort of two guards, reached a small room at thebottom of narrow twisting stairs. One guard led Oba up the stairs while theother followed. At the top, they took him into a locked room, and then throughanother locked door.The lamps the guards carried in cast angular shadows through the rows of shelvesheaped with things; clothing, weapons, and various personal possessions,everything from canes to flutes to puppets. Oba scanned the shelves crammed withodd things, stooping to look low, stretching up on his tiptoes to check theupper shelves. He guessed that all these things were taken from prisoners beforethey were locked away.Near the end of one row, he spotted the handle of his knife. Behind the knifewas a mound of the tattered clothes that he had taken from Althea’s house sothat he could make it across the Azrith Plains. His boot knife was there, too.Piled in front were the cloth and leather pouches containing his considerablefortune.He was relieved to have his money back. He was even more relieved to once againcurl his fingers around the smooth wooden handle of his knife.“You two will be my escorts,” Oba informed the guards.“Where shall we escort you?” one asked.Oba mulled over the question. “This is my first visit. I wish to see some of thepalace.” He restrained himself from calling it his palace. That would come intime. For now, there were other matters that must come first.He followed them up stone stairwells, through corridors and past intersectionsand myriad flights of stairs. Patrolling soldiers, off in the distance, saw hisguards and paid little attention to the man between them.When they came to an iron door, one of his guards unlocked it and they steppedthrough into a corridor beyond with a polished marble floor. Oba was taken bythe splendor of the hall, the fluted columns to the sides, and the archedceiling. The three of them marched onward, around several corners lit bydramatic silver lamps hung in the center of marble panels.The hall turned again to open into a grand courtyard of such staggering beautythat it cast the hall they had been in, that had been the finest place Oba hadever seen, as little more than a pigsty by contrast. He stood motionless, hismouth hanging, as he stared out at pool of water open to the sky, withtrees-trees-growing on the other side, as if it were a woodland pond. Exceptthat this was indoors, and the pond was surrounded by a low benchlike enclosureof polished rust-colored marble, and the pond was lined with blue glazed tiles.There were orange fish gliding through the pond. Real fish. Real orange fish.Indoors.In his whole life Oba had never been so struck dumb by the grandeur, the beauty,the sheer majesty of a place.“This is the palace?” he asked his escorts.“Only a tiny part of it,” one answered.“Only a tiny part,” Oba repeated in astonishment. “Is the rest as nice as this?”“No. Most places are much more grand, with soaring ceilings, arches, and massivecolumns between balconies.”“Balconies? Inside?”“Yes. People on different levels can look down on lower levels, down on grandcourtyards and quadrangles.”“On some levels vendors sell their wares,” the other man said. “Some areas arepublic areas. Some places are quarters for soldiers, or staff. There are someplaces where visitors may rent rooms.”Oba took this all in as he stared at the well-dressed people moving through theplace, at the glass, marble, and polished wood.“After I’ve seen some more of the palace,” he announced to his two big,uniformed D’Haran escorts, “I will want a quiet and very private room-luxurious,mind you, but someplace out of the way where I won’t be noticed. I will firstwant to purchase some decent clothes and some supplies. You two will stand watchand make sure that no one knows I’m here while I have a bath and get a goodnight’s rest.”“How long will we be watching you?” the other man asked. “We will be missed ifwe’re away for too long. If we’re gone even longer, they will search for us andfind your cell empty. Then they will come looking for you. They will soon knowyou are here.”Oba considered. “Hopefully, I can leave tomorrow. Will you be missed by then?”“No,” one of the two said, his eyes empty of everything but the desire to doOba’s bidding. “We were just leaving at the end of our guard watch. We shouldn’tbe missed before tomorrow.”Oba smiled. The voice had chosen the right men. “By then, I’ll be on my way. Butuntil then, I should enjoy my visit and see some of the palace. “Oba’s fingers glided over the handle of his knife. “Maybe tonight, I might evenlike the company of a woman at dinner. A discreet woman.”Both men bowed. Before he left, Oba would leave the two as nothing more than astain of ashes on the floor of a lonely passageway. They would never tell anyonewhy his cell was empty.And then ... well, it was nearly spring, and in spring, who could tell where hisfancy might turn?One thing for sure, he was going to have to find Jennsen."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44Jennsen’s astonishment was wearing off. She was becoming numb to the sight ofthe endless expanse of men, like some dark flood of humanity across thebottomland. The vast army had churned the broad plain between the rolling hillsto a drab brown. Inestimable numbers of tents, wagons, and horses were crowdedin among the soldiers. The drone of the horde, cut through with yelling, hoots,calls, whistles, the rattle of gear, the clatter of hooves, the rumble ofwagons, the ringing rhythm of hammers on steel, the squeals of horses, and evenoccasional odd cries and screams of what almost sounded to Jennsen like women,could be heard for miles.It was like gazing down on some impossibly huge city, but without buildings orpattern, as if all of man’s ingenuity, order, and works had magically vanished,with the people left behind reduced to near savages under the gathering darkclouds, trying to make do against the forces of nature and having a grim time ofit.Nor was this the worst of the conditions Jennsen had seen. Several weeks beforeand farther to the south, she and Sebastian had passed through the very placewhere the army of the Imperial Order had wintered. An army of this size woreheavily on the land, but she had been shocked at how much worse it was when theystopped for any length of time. It would be years before that vast, festeringwound in the landscape healed.Worse still, throughout the long harsh winter, men by the thousands had fallenill. That dismal place would be forever haunted by an endless expanse ofhaphazardly placed graves marking those left behind when the living had marchedon. It was horrifying to see such a staggering loss of life to sickness; Jennsenfeared to imagine the far worse carnage to come in the battle for freedom.With the frost finally out of the ground, the muddy soil had dried and firmedenough that the army had at last been able to strike out from those befouledwinter quarters, to start their drive toward Aydindril, the seat of power in theMidlands. Sebastian had told her that the force they brought up from the OldWorld was so huge that while the leading edge was stopping here to set up camp,it would be hours before those at the tail end caught up and halted for thenight. In the morning, the head of the great army would have to start off,stretching itself out, long before the end could have room to begin to move.While their spring march north was not yet swift, their advance was inexorable.Sebastian said that once the men smelled their prey, their pulse, and theirpace, would quicken.It was a terrible shame that Lord Rahl’s greed for conquest and rule made thisall necessary, that such a peaceful valley should be given over to men at war.With spring, the grasses were at last coming back to life, so that the hillsrising up to each side of the valley looked as if they were covered in livinggreen velvet. Forests took over on the steeper slopes beyond the hills. In thedistance, off to the west and north, stone peaks still wore heavy mantles ofsnow. Headwaters swollen with the snowmelt roared down the rocky slopes, and,farther to the east, emptied into a mighty river that meandered out into agreat, lush plain. The dirt there was so black, so fertile, that Jennsenimagined even rocks planted there might sprout roots and grow.Before she and Sebastian had come upon the vast stain of the army, the land hadbeen as beautiful as any Jennsen had seen in all her life. She longed to explorethose enchanting forests, and fancied she could contentedly spend the rest ofher life among such timber. It was hard for her to cast the Midlands as a placeof evil magic.Sebastian had told her that those woods were dangerous places where beastsroamed, and where those who wielded magic lurked. With the things she waslearning, she was almost tempted to risk it. She knew, though, that even inthose trackless and seemingly endless forests, Lord Rahl would still find her.His men had already demonstrated their ability to locate her in even the mostremote areas; her mother’s murder was only the first proof of that. Ever sincethat terrible day, his merciless assassins had somehow been able to hound her upthrough D’Hara and halfway across the Midlands.If Lord Rahl’s men caught her, they would take her back to the dungeons whereSebastian had been held, and then Lord Rahl would have her tortured endlesslybefore he granted her a slow, agonizing death. Jennsen could have no safety, nopeace, as long as Lord Rahl pursued her. She intended to catch him, instead, andseize a life for herself.Another clot of sentries spotted her and Sebastian riding over the open groundand moved down the slope from their observation post at the top of a hill tointercept them. When she and Sebastian were closer, and the men saw his spikesof white hair and the casual salute he gave them, they turned and swarmed backup the hill to their campfire and cooking their dinner.Like the rest of the Imperial Order army she had seen, the men were arough-looking lot, in tattered clothes, furs, and hides. Down in the broadvalley, many sat around small campfires outside little tents made of hides oroiled canvas. Most looked to have been set up wherever their owners had foundenough space, rather than to any order. Randomly set among the tents were localcommand centers, mess tables, arms stockpiles, supply wagons, paddocks packedwith livestock or horses, tradespeople laboring, and even blacksmiths working attransportable forges. Scattered here and there were small trading markets wheremen gathered to barter or buy small goods.There were even agitated, angry, rawboned men standing among the throngspreaching to smatterings of vacant onlookers. What exactly the men werepreaching, Jennsen couldn’t hear, but she had seen men preach before. Accordingto her mother, the tempestuous body language prophesying doom and proselytizingsalvation was as unmistakable as it was unchanging.As they rode closer in to the immense encampment, she saw men at their tentsoccupied with everything from laughing and drinking to working at cleaningweapons and gear. Some men stood in crooked lines, arms thrown over the nextfellow’s shoulders, singing songs together. Others cooked by themselves, whilestill others crowded around mess areas, waiting to be fed. Some men wereoccupied with chores and tending animals. She saw some men gambling and arguing.The entire place was dirty, smelly, noisy, and frighteningly confusing.As uncomfortable as she had always felt around crowds, this looked moreterrifying even than a fevered nightmare. Descending toward the churning mass ofhumanity, she wanted to run in the opposite direction. Only her single, burningreason for being there, and nothing else, kept her from doing so.She had reached the brink within, and crossed over. She had embraced the need tokill and resolved with cold deliberate calculation to do it. There could be noturning back.The uniforms the soldiers wore were not that-uniform-but seemed to be amismatched collection of leather set with spikes, fur, chain mail, wool cloaks,hides, and filthy tunics. Almost all the burly men she saw were unshaven, grimy,grim. It was readily apparent why Sebastian was so easily recognized and why noone ever challenged him, yet she remained awed at how, without fail, every manwho laid eyes on him gave him a salute. Sebastian stood out like a swan amongmaggots.Sebastian had explained how difficult it was to amass a huge army to defendtheir homeland and what an arduous undertaking it was to send them on such along journey. He said that they were men far from home with a grisly job to do;they couldn’t be expected to look presentable for womenfolk or pause in theirlife-and-death battles to be mannerly and make tidy camps. These were fightingmen.So were D’Haran soldiers. These men certainly didn’t look anything like D’Haransoldiers looked, nor were they as disciplined, but she didn’t say so.Jennsen could understand, though. As hard as she and Sebastian had beentraveling, all the while taking precautions to evade Lord Rahl’s men by ridinguntil they nearly dropped with exhaustion, often backtracking and working hardat making false trails, she had little time to worry about looking her best.Added to that, it had been a long and difficult journey across mountains inwinter. It often rankled her that Sebastian should see her with her hair alltangled, when she was as filthy and sweaty as her horse and smelling no better.Still, he never seemed fazed by her all too often unkempt appearance. Rather, heusually seemed ignited by the mere sight of her, and often wanted nothing somuch as to do whatever he could to please her.The previous day they had taken a shorter route across hill country in order tomake their way toward the head of the army, and had come across an abandonedfarmhouse. Sebastian had indulged her wish to stay there for the night, eventhough it was early to make camp. After bathing and washing her long hair in theold tub in the tiny washroom, she put the water to use to wash out her clothes.Sitting before the warm fire Sebastian had built in the hearth, Jennsen brushedher hair as it dried. She was nervous about meeting the emperor and wanted tolook presentable. Sebastian, leaning back on an elbow, watching her before theflickering glow of flames, had smiled that wonderful smile of his and said thateven if she went unwashed and with tangled hair, she would be the most beautifulwoman Emperor Jagang had ever seen.Now, as they rode along the fringes of the Imperial Order encampment, herstomach was in knots, even if her hair was not. From the looks of the turbulentclouds moving in past the mountains to the west, a spring storm would be on thembefore long. Off above distant valleys, lightning flickered through the darkclouds. She hoped the rain didn’t arrive to drench her hair and dress rightbefore meeting the emperor.“There,” Sebastian said, leaning forward in his saddle to point. “Those are theemperor’s tents, and those of his important advisors and officers. Not farbeyond, up the valley, will be Aydindril itself.” He looked over with a grin.“Emperor Jagang hasn’t moved to take the city yet. We’ve made it in time.”The huge tents were an imposing sight. The largest was oval, its tripeaked roofpierced by three lofty center poles. The tent’s sides bore brightly coloredpanels. Standards and tassels hung from the eaves. High atop the three poles,colorful yellow and red banners flapped in the gusty wind, while long pennantsstreamed out, undulating like airborne serpents. The emperor’s congregation oftents stood out among the drab little quarters of the regular soldiers the way aking’s palace towered over surrounding huts.Jennsen’s heart raced as they urged their horses down into the thick of theencampment. Both Rusty and Pete, their ears alert, snorted their misgivingsabout entering such a noisy and busy place. She urged Rusty ahead in order totake Sebastian’s hand when offered it.“Your hand is all sweaty,” he said, smiling. “You aren’t nervous, are you?”She was water at a boil, a horse at a gallop. “Maybe a little,” she said.But her purpose stiffened her will.“Well, don’t be. Emperor Jagang will be the one to be nervous, meeting such abeautiful woman.”Jennsen could feel her face heat. She was about to meet an emperor. What wouldher mother think of such a thing? As she rode, she considered how her mother, asa young servant girl on the palace staff-a nobody must have felt when she metDarken Rahl himself. Jennsen could, for the first time, truly begin to empathizewith the enormity of such an event in her mother’s life.As she and Sebastian trotted their horses into camp, men everywhere peeredJennsen’s way. Mobs of men crowded closer to see the woman riding in. She sawthat there were a number of soldiers with pikes forming a rough line along theirroute, holding back the press of men. She realized that the guards were clearingthe way and preventing any of the more celebratory men from getting too close.Sebastian watched her as she took note of the way the soldiers opened a clearpath for them.“The emperor knows we’re coming,” he told her.“But how?”“When we encountered scouts a few days ago, and then sentries this morning as wegot closer, they would have sent runners on ahead to inform Emperor Jagang thatI’ve returned, and that I’m not alone. Emperor Jagang would want to insure thesafety of any guest I would bring.”It appeared to Jennsen that the guards were meant to keep the great mass ofregular soldiers away from the two of them. She thought it an odd thing to do,but by the drunken nature of some of the soldiers, and the rough looks andleering grins of others, she couldn’t say that she was sorry about it.“The soldiers look so ... I don’t know ... brutish, I guess.”“And as you are about to plunge your knife into Richard Rahl’s heart,” Sebastiansaid without pause, “do you intend to curtsy and say please and thank you sothat he will see how well mannered you are?”“Of course not, but-”He turned his halting blue eyes on her. “When those brutes came into your houseand butchered your mother, what sort of men would you have wished were there toprotect her?”Jennsen was taken aback. “Sebastian, I don’t know what that has to do ..”“Would you trust dressy soldiers with polished leather and polite manners-likesome pompous king would have at a fancy dinner party-to be the ones to make adesperate last stand protecting your beloved mother against the onslaught ofvicious killers? Or would you want men even more brutish to be the ones to standbefore your mother, protecting her life? Wouldn’t you want men steeped in themost brutal traditions of combat, to be the ones standing between her and thosesavage men intent on killing her?”“I guess I see what you mean,” Jennsen admitted.“These men are serving in that role for all their loved ones back in the OldWorld.”The unexpected encounter with that terrible memory was so chilling, so painful,that she had to work at putting it out of her mind. She felt humbled, too, bySebastian’s heated words. She was here for a reason. That reason was all thatmattered. If the men arrayed against Lord Rahl’s forces were tough and mean, somuch the better.It wasn’t until they reached the heavily defended compound around the emperor’stents that Jennsen saw other women. They were an odd mix, from young-looking tosome who were stooped with age. Most peered curiously, some frowned, and a feweven appeared alarmed, but all watched as Jennsen rode, closer.“Why do the women all have rings through their lower lip?” she whispered toSebastian,His gaze swept the women near the tents. “As a sign of loyalty to the ImperialOrder, to Emperor Jagang.”Jennsen thought it not just a strange way to show loyalty, but disquieting. Mostof the women wore drab dresses, most had unkempt hair. Some were dressed alittle better, but only a little.Soldiers took the horses when they dismounted. Jennsen stroked Rusty’s ear andwhispered reassuringly to the nervous animal that it was all right to go withthe stranger. Once Rusty was calmed, Pete contentedly followed her toward thestable area. Parting from her constant companion of so long unexpectedlyreminded Jennsen of how she missed Betty.The women moved farther into the background as they watched, as if fearing toget too close. Jennsen was used to such behavior; people feared her red hair. Itwas a rare warm spring day, and it had intoxicated Jennsen with the promise ofmore such days. She had forgotten to put her hood up as they came close to theencampment. She started, then, to put it up, but Sebastian’s hand stayed herarm.“It’s not necessary.” With a tilt of his head, he indicated the women.“Many of them are Sisters of the Light. They don’t fear magic, only strangersentering the emperor’s compound.”Jennsen realized then the reason for the strange looks from a number of thewomen; they were gifted and saw her as a hole in the world. Their eyes wereseeing her, but their gift was not.Sebastian wouldn’t be aware of that. She had never told him exactly what Altheahad explained about the gifted and the offspring of a Lord Rahl. Sebastian had,on more than one occasion, shown a condescending disgust in the details ofmagic. Jennsen had never felt entirely comfortable talking to him about thespecifics of what she had learned from the sorceress, and the even moreimportant things she had figured out on her own. It was all difficult enough forher to reconcile in her own mind, and seemed too personal to reveal to himunless the time and circumstances were right. They never seemed to be.Jennsen forced a smile at the women watching from the shadows of the tent. Theystared back.“Why is the emperor insulated from his men, and guarded?” she asked Sebastian.“With this many men, you can never be absolutely certain that one isn’t aninfiltrator, or even a deranged madman, who might try to make a name for himselfby harming Emperor Jagang. Such a foolish act would deprive us all of our greatleader. With so much at risk, we have to take precautions.”Jennsen supposed she could understand. After all, Sebastian himself had been aninfiltrator in the People’s Palace. Had he come across an important man there,he could have done harm. The D’Harans were troubled by such a threat. They hadeven arrested the right man.Fortunately, Jennsen had been able to get him out. How she had been able toaccomplish such a thing was part of what she had finally come to terms with, butcould never find the right time to share with Sebastian. She didn’t think hewould understand, anyway. He probably wouldn’t even believe such a far-fetchednotion.Sebastian’s arm circled her waist and drew her onward toward two huge, silentmen standing guard outside the emperor’s tent. Stepping between the two afterthey bowed their heads to him, Sebastian lifted aside a heavy doorway curtaincovered with gold and silver medallions.Jennsen had never even imagined, much less seen, such a lavish tent, but whatshe saw as she stepped inside was far more opulent than even the outsidesuggested. The ground was entirely covered with a variety of rich carpets laidevery which way. An assortment of woven hangings decorated with exotic scenesand elaborate designs defined the space. Delicate glass bowls, fine pottery, andtall painted vases sat on the polished tables and chests around the room. To theside there was even a tall glass-fronted bureau filled with painted platesdisplayed on stands. Colorful pillows in a variety of sizes rimmed the floor.Overhead, openings covered with sheer silk let in muted light. Scented candlesshimmered everywhere, while all the carpets and hangings imposed a quiet hush tothe air. The place felt sacred.There were women inside, each wearing the ring through her lower lip, busilygoing about duties. While most appeared absorbed in their work, one of thewomen, polishing a collection of tall, delicate vases in a measured, methodicalmanner, coolly watched Jennsen out of the corner of her eye. She wasmiddle-aged, broad shouldered, and wore a simple floorlength dark gray dressbuttoned to her neck. Her gray and black hair was loosely tied back. For themost part, she appeared unremarkable, except for the knowing, self-satisfiedsmirk that seemed enduringly etched in her face. That look gave Jennsen pause.As their eyes met, the voice stiffed, calling Jennsen’s name in that haunting,dead whisper, calling for her to surrender. For some reason, Jennsen wasmomentarily suffused with the icy sense that the woman knew that the voice hadspoken. Jennsen dismissed the odd notion, deciding that it was merely due to thewoman’s expression, which exuded a demeanor of stark superiority.Another woman busied herself brushing at the carpets with a small hand broom.Yet another was replacing candles that had guttered. Other women-some sure to beSisters of the Light-hurried in and out of rooms beyond, tending to thecollection of pillows, lamps, and even flowers in vases. One thin young manwearing only baggy cotton trousers worked with a comb ordering the fringe of thecarpets set before openings into back rooms. Except for the brown-eyed womanpolishing the tall vases, they were focused on their work and none paid anyparticular notice that visitors had entered the emperor’s tent.Sebastian’s arm held her securely as he guided her deeper into the dimly litroom. The walls and ceiling moved and billowed slightly in the wind. Jennsen’sheart could have pounded no harder were she being led to her own execution. Whenshe realized that her fingers were tightening around the hilt of her knife tocheck if it was clear in its scabbard, she forced herself to let her hand dropaway from it.Near the back of the room sat an ornately carved and gilded chair draped withstreamers of red silks. Jennsen swallowed when she finally made herself look atthe man sitting there, his elbow on the arm of the chair, his chin held by histhumb, his forefinger resting along the side of his face.He was a thick-necked bull of a man. Flickering candlelight reflecting off hisshaved head lent the illusion that he wore a crown of tiny flames. Two long,thin braids of mustache grew down from the corners of his mouth, and anotherbraid grew from the center of his chin. Fine gold chain connected the gold ringsthrough his left nostril and ear, while a collection of much heavier, jeweledchains rested in the cleft of muscles on his powerful chest. Each meaty fingerwas studded with a large ring. The lamb’s-wool vest he wore had no sleeves,revealing his hefty shoulders and brawny arms. While he didn’t appear tall, hismuscled mass was nonetheless imposing.But it was his eyes that, despite Sebastian’s cautionary description, had herholding her breath. No words could have prepared her for being in the presenceof the real thing.His inky eyes had no whites, no irises, no pupils, leaving only glistening darkvoids. Yet somber shapes shifted across those dark voids, like thunderclouds atmidnight. Despite his having no irises or pupils, she was certain beyond anydoubt that he was looking directly and intently at her.Jennsen thought her knees might buckle. When he smiled at her, she was sure ofit.Sebastian’s arm tightened, helping hold her up. He bowed slightly from thewaist.“Emperor, I am thankful that the Creator has watched over you and kept yousafe.”The smile widened. “And you, Sebastian.” Jagang’s voice matched the look of him,husky, powerful, menacing. He sounded as if he were a man who brooked noweakness or excuses. “It has been a long time. Far too long. I’m glad to haveyou back with me.”Sebastian bowed his head toward Jennsen. “Excellency, I have brought animportant guest. This is Jennsen.”Despite Sebastian’s arm around her waist, holding her, she slipped free and wentto her knees of her own accord and before trepidation imposed it. She used theoccasion to bow forward until her head nearly touched the floor. Sebastianhadn’t told her that she was supposed to do so, but she felt an overwhelmingfear that it was what she must do. If nothing else, it momentarily relieved herof the obligation of looking into those nightmare eyes.She supposed that a man like this, a warrior who hoped to prevail against theinvading force from D’Hara, had to be a man of brute strength, iron command, andgrim tenacity. Being the emperor of a people hoping to be saved from thethreatening shadow of enslavement was a job for a man no less than the one sheknelt before.“Your Excellency,” she said in a trembling voice toward the floor. “I am at yourservice.”She heard a booming laugh. “Come, now, Jennsen, no need for that.”Jennsen felt her face going scarlet as she rose with Sebastian’s jovialinsistence and help. Neither the emperor nor Sebastian took note of herembarrassment.“Sebastian, where did you ever find such a lovely young woman?”Sebastian’s blue eyes beheld her with pride. “It’s a long story for anothertime, Excellency. For now, you must know that Jennsen has come to an importantdetermination, one that will bear on us all.”Jagang’s inky gaze returned to Jennsen in a way that made her heart seem to riseup into her throat. He wore the slightest smile, the smirk of an emperor lookingdown indulgently on a nobody.“And what would that determination be, young lady?”Jennsen.An image of her mother lying on the floor of their house, bleeding, dying,flashed into Jennsen’s mind. She would never forget her mother’s last preciousmoments of life. The agonizing grief of having to flee without even being ableto care for and bury her mother’s body still burned unabated in her soul.Jennsen.Rage flooded in to overwhelm any nervousness at answering an emperor’s question.“I intend to kill Lord Rahl,” Jennsen said. “I have come to ask for your help.”In the dead silence, any trace of mirth evaporated from the Emperor Jagang’sface. He watched her with cold, dark, merciless eyes, his brow set in warning.This was clearly a subject that tolerated no humor. Lord Rahl had invaded thisman’s homeland, killed untold thousands of his people, and set the whole worldto war and suffering.Emperor Jagang the Just, the muscles in his jaw flexing, waited, clearlyexpecting her to explain herself.“I am Jennsen Rahl,” she said in answer to his dark glare. She drew her knife,gripped the blade in her rock-steady fist, and thrust the handle up before himon his throne, showing him the ornate letter “R,” the symbol of the House ofRahl.“I am Jennsen Rahl,” she repeated, “Richard Rahl’s sister. I intend to kill him.Sebastian told me that you may be able to provide me some help to that end. Ifyou can, I would be eternally in your debt. If you cannot, then tell me now, forI still intend to kill him and will need to be on my way.”Elbows on the arms of his red-silk-draped throne, he leaned toward her, holdingher in his nightmare gaze.“My dear Jennsen Rahl, sister to Richard Rahl, for a task such as this, I wouldlay the world at your feet. You have but to ask, and anything within my powershall be yours.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45Jennsen sat close to Sebastian, drawing comfort from his familiar presence, yetwishing they could instead be alone by a campfire frying up fish or cookingbeans. She felt more alone at the emperor’s table, with servants hovering allabout, than she’d ever felt by herself in the silence of a forest. WithoutSebastian there, laughing and talking, she didn’t know what she would have done,how she would have behaved. She was uncomfortable enough around regular people;this was far more unnerving.Emperor Jagang was a man who, without effort, fluidly dominated the room.Although he never broke his gracious, courtly manner with her, in someinscrutable way, he made her feel that every breath she took had been grantedher only by his grace. He referenced momentous matters offhandedly, withoutrealizing he was doing it, so common were such responsibilities, so sure hisunflinching rule. He was a mountain lion at rest, sleek and poised, tailswishing lazily, licking his chops.This was not an emperor who was content to sit safely by, back in some remotepalace, and receive reports; this was an emperor who led his men into the thickof battle. This was an emperor who dug his hands down into the bloody muck oflife and death and pulled out what he wanted.Though it seemed an extravagant dinner for what was, after all, an army on themarch, it was still the emperor’s tent and table, and reflected that fact. Therewas food and drink in abundance, everything from fowl to fish, beef to lamb,wine to water.As servants, focused on their tasks, rushed in and out with steaming platters ofbeautifully prepared food, treating her like royalty, Jennsen was struck with asudden gut-wrenching glimpse of how her mother, as a lowly, obscure, humbleyoung woman, must have felt as she sat at Lord Rahl’s table, as she saw suchtempting variety and abundance as she had never imagined, while at the same timetrembling at being in the presence of a man with the power to sentence death,without pausing his meal.Jennsen had little appetite. She pulled dainty strips of meat off of thesucculent piece of pork sitting before her on a thick slab of bread, and nibbledas she listened to the two men talk. Their conversation was trivial. Jennsensensed that when she was not around, the two men would have much more to say toeach another. As it was, they spoke of acquaintances and caught up oninconsequential matters that had taken place since Sebastian had left the armythe previous summer.“What of Aydindril?” Sebastian asked at last as he stabbed a slice of meat onthe point of his knife.The emperor twisted a leg off a crispy goose. He planted his elbows on the edgeof the table as he leaned forward and gestured vaguely with his prize. “I don’tknow.”Sebastian lowered his knife. “What do you mean? I remember the lay of the land.You are but a day or two away.” His voice was respectful, but clearly concerned.“How can you march in without knowing what awaits in Aydindril?”Jagang tore a big bite off the fat end of the goose leg, the bone spanning thefingers of both hands. Grease dripped from the meat, and from his fingers.“Well,” he said at last, waving the bone over his shoulder before casting itaside on a plate, “we sent scouts and patrols to have a look, but none returned.““None of them?” Concern put an edge on Sebastian’s voice.Jagang picked up a knife and sliced off a chunk of lamb from a platter to theside. “None,” he said as he stabbed the piece of meat.With his teeth, Sebastian eased the bite off his knife and then set the bladedown. He rested his elbows on the edge of the table and folded his fingerstogether as he considered.“The Wizard’s Keep is in Aydindril,” Sebastian said at last in a quiet voice. “Isaw it, when I scouted the city last year. It sits on the side of a mountain,overlooking the city.”“I remember your report,” Jagang answered.Jennsen wanted to ask what a “Wizard’s Keep” was, but not enough to break hersilence while the men talked. Besides, it seemed somewhat self-evident,especially by the ominous tone in Sebastian’s voice when he said it.Sebastian rubbed his palms together. “Then may I ask your plan?”The emperor flicked his fingers in command. All the servants vanished. Jennsenwished she could go with them, go hide under her blanket and be a proper nobodyagain. Outside, thunder rumbled and occasional gusts of wind drove fits of rainagainst the tent. The candles and lamps set about the table lit the two men andthe immediate area, but left the soft carpets and walls in near darkness.Emperor Jagang glanced briefly at Jennsen before directing his inky gaze toSebastian. “I intend to move in swiftly. Not with the whole army, as I believethey will expect, but with a small enough force of cavalry to be maneuverable,yet large enough to maintain control of the situation. Of course we will take asizable contingent of the gifted.”In the span of those brief words, the mood had turned deadly serious. Jennsensensed that she was silent witness to the pivotal moments of a momentous event.It was frightening to think of the lives that hung in the balance of the wordsthese two men spoke.Sebastian weighed the emperor’s words for a time before speaking. “Do you haveany idea how Aydindril wintered?”Jagang shook his head. He pulled a chunk of lamb off the point of his knife andspoke as he chewed.“The Mother Confessor is many things; stupid is not one of them. She would haveknown for a long time, by the direction of our push, by the movements she’sobserved, by the cities that have already fallen, the path we have chosen, byall the reports and information she would have gathered, that with spring I willmove on Aydindril. I’ve given them a good long time to sweat as they pondertheir fate. I suspect that by now they’re all shaking in their boots, but Idon’t think she has the heart to flee.”“You think that Lord Rahl’s wife is there?” Jennsen blurted out in astonishment.“In the city? The Mother Confessor herself!”Both men paused and gazed at her. The tent was silent.Jennsen shrank. “Forgive me for speaking.”The emperor grinned. “Why should I forgive you? You’ve just stuck a knife in theprize goose and called it true.” With his blade, he gestured toward Sebastian.“You brought a special woman, a woman with a good head on her shoulders.”Sebastian rubbed Jennsen’s back. “And a pretty head, at that.”Jagang’s black eyes gleamed as he watched her. “Yes, indeed.” His fingersblindly scooped olives from a glass bowl to the side. “So, Jennsen Rahl, what isyour thinking about all this?”Since she had already spoken, she couldn’t now decline to answer. She gatheredherself and considered the question.“Whenever I was hiding from Lord Rahl, I would try not to do anything that wouldlet him know where I was. I tried to do everything I could to keep him blind.Maybe that’s what they are doing, too. Trying to keep you blind.”“That’s what I was thinking,” Sebastian said. “If they’re terrified, they mighttry to eliminate any scout or patrol in order to make us think that they’re morepowerful than they are and to conceal any defensive plans.”“And keep at least some element of surprise on their side,” Jennsen added.“My thought, too,” Jagang said. He grinned at Sebastian. “Small wonder you wouldbring me such a woman-she is a strategist, too.” Jagang winked at Jennsen, thenrang a bell to the side.A woman, the one in the gray dress and tied-back gray and black hair, appearedat a distant opening. “Yes, Excellency?”“Bring the young lady some fruits and sweetmeats.”As she bowed and left, the emperor turned serious again. “That’s why I believeit best to take a smaller force than they are sure to expect, one able tomaneuver quickly in response to what defenses they try to catch us up in. Theymay be able to overpower our small patrols, but not a sizable force of cavalryand gifted. If need be, we can always pour men into the city. After a winter ofsitting on their behinds, they would be more than happy to be unleashed. But I’mreluctant to start out with what those in Aydindril are expecting.”Sebastian was idly poking a thick slab of roast beef with his knife as heconsidered. “She might be in the Confessors’ Palace.” He redirected his gaze tothe emperor. “The Mother Confessor very well might have decided to make herstand at long last.”“I think so, too,” Emperor Jagang said. Outside, the spring storm had picked up,the chill wind moaning among the tents.Jennsen couldn’t restrain herself. “You really think she will be there?”sheasked both men. “You honestly think she would remain there when she knows you’recoming with an enormous army?”Jagang shrugged. “I can’t be sure, of course, but I’ve battled her all the wayup through the Midlands. In the past, she had options, choices, tough thoughthey sometimes were. We drove her army into Aydindril just before winter, thensat at her doorstep. Now, she and her army have run out of choices, and, withthe mountains all around, places to flee. Even she knows that a time comes whenthe choice you are given must be faced. I think this may be where she chooses toat last stand and fight.”Sebastian stabbed a portion of meat. “It sounds too simple.”“Of course it does,” Jagang said, “that’s why I must consider that she may havedecided to do it.”Sebastian gestured north with the red piece of meat on the point of his blade.“She may have pulled back into the mountains, and left only enough men to takeout scouts and patrols, to keep you blind, as Jennsen suggested.”Jagang shrugged. “Possibly. She is a woman who is impossible to predict. Butshe’s running out of places to pull back to. Sooner or later there will be noground left. This may not be her plan, but, then again, it might be so.”Jennsen hadn’t realized that the Old World had made such progress at throwingback the enemy. Sebastian, too, had been away a long time. Matters, for the OldWorld, were not nearly so bleak as she had thought. Still, it sounded a greatrisk to take based on such thin conjecture.“And so you’re willing to gamble your men on such a battle, hoping she will bethere?”“Gamble?” Jagang sounded amused by the suggestion. “Don’t you see? It isn’treally a gamble at all. Either way, we have nothing to lose. Either way, we willhave Aydindril. In so doing, we finally cleave the Midlands, thus cleaving theentire New World in two. Cleave and conquer is the path to victory.”Sebastian licked the blood from his knife. “You know her tactics better than Iand are better able to predict what her next will be. But, as you say, whethershe decides to stand with her people, or leaves them to their fate, we will havethe city of Aydindril and the seat of power in the Midlands.”The emperor stared off. “That bitch has killed hundreds of thousands of my men.She has always managed to stay one step ahead of me, to stay out of my grip, butall the while she was backing toward the wall-this wall.” He looked up in coldrage. “May the Creator grant that I have her at last.” His knuckles were whitearound the handle of his knife, his voice a deadly oath. “I will have her, and Iwill settle the score. Personally.”Sebastian measured the look in the emperor’s dark eyes. “Then perhaps we arenear to the final victory-in the Midlands, at least. With the Midlands won, thefate of D’Hara will be sealed.” He held his knife up. “And if the MotherConfessor is there, then Lord Rahl very well might be, too.”Jennsen, thoughts tumbling through her mind, looked from Sebastian to theemperor. “You mean, you think that her husband, Lord Rahl, is there, too?”Jagang’s nightmare gaze turned toward her as he grinned wickedly. “Exactly,darling.”Jennsen felt a chill run up her spine at the murderous look in his eyes. She wasgrateful to the good spirits that she was on this man’s side, and not his enemy.Still, she had to voice the vital information Tom had told her. She felt a stabof anguish, wishing it had been someone other than Tom who had confirmed it forher, but it was Sebastian who was really the first one to have told her aboutit.“Lord Rahl can’t be there, in Aydindril.” Both men stared at her. “Lord Rahl isfar to the south.”Jagang frowned. “To the south? What do you mean?”“He’s in the Old World.”“Are you sure?” Sebastian asked.Jennsen puzzled at him. “You told me so yourself. That he led his army ofinvasion into the Old World.”A look of recollection came over Sebastian’s face. “Yes, of course, Jenn, butthat was long before I even met you-way back before I left our troops-that I hadheard those reports. That was a long time ago.”“But I know he was in the Old World after that.”“What do you mean?” Jagang asked in a gravely growl.Jennsen cleared her throat. “The bond. The D’Haran people feel a bond to theLord Rahl-”“And do you feel the bond?” Jagang asked.“Well, no. It just isn’t strong enough in me. But when Sebastian and I were atthe People’s Palace, I met people there who said that Lord Rahl was far to thesouth, in the Old World.”The emperor considered her words as he glanced over at a woman who had come inwith platters of dried fruits, sweetmeats, and nuts. She worked at a distantside table, apparently not wanting to come any closer and disturb the emperorand his guests.“But Jenn, you heard that last winter when we were at the palace. Have you heardanyone with the bond confirm it since then?”Jennsen shook her head. “I guess not.”“If the Mother Confessor intends to make her stand in Aydindril,” Sebastiansaid, thoughtfully, “then it’s possible, since we last had this report of him tothe south, that he’s come north to stand by the Mother Confessor.”Jagang leaned in low over the bloody meat before him. “Those two are like that.Evil to the end. I’ve dealt with them both for a long time, now. I know fromexperience that if there’s any way for them to be together, they will be--evenif it’s in death.”The implications were staggering. “Then . . . we might have him,” Jennsenwhispered, almost to herself. “We might have Richard Rahl, too. The nightmaremight be close to over. We could be on the eve of victory for all of us.”Jagang leaned back, drumming his fingers on the table, looking from one to theother. “While I find it hard to believe Richard Rahl would also be there, fromwhat I know about him, he could well decide to stand and lose with her, ratherthan live to see it all slip away from him bit by bloody bit.”Jennsen felt an unexpected pang at the thought of the two of them standingtogether as the end came. It was completely out of character for a Lord Rahl tocare for any woman, much less to stand by one as she was about to lose the warfor her homeland, and her life as well. Lord Rahl would be more concerned aboutpreserving his own life and land.Still, the thought of him being this close was too tantalizing to dismiss, andhad her pulse racing. “If he is this close, then I wouldn’t need the help of theSisters of the Light. I wouldn’t need a spell. I would only have to get a littlecloser, to be with you when you make your drive into the city.”Jagang’s grim, humorless smile was back. “You will ride with me; I will deliveryou to the Confessors’ Palace.” His knuckles were white around his knife again.“I want them both dead. I will see to the Mother Confessor, personally. I grantyou permission to be the one to plunge your knife into Richard Rahl.”Jennsen felt a wild swing of emotion, from giddy elation that the deed was closeat hand, to sickening horror. For an instant, she doubted that she could reallycarry out such a grisly, cold-blooded act.Jennsen.But then she remembered her mother lying in a pool of blood on the floor oftheir home, bleeding to death from those awful ripping stab wounds, her severedarm not far away, a house full of Lord Rahl’s brutes standing over her. Jennsenremembered her mother’s eyes, as she lay dying. She remembered how helpless shefelt as her mother’s life slipped away. The horror of it was as fresh as ever.The rage was as white-hot as ever. Jennsen lusted to plunge her knife into herbastard brother’s heart.That was all she wanted.In the searing haze of righteous anger, as she saw herself slamming the knifeinto Richard Rahl’s chest, she only distantly heard Jagang speak.“But why is it you wish to kill your brother? What is your reason, yourpurpose?”“Grushdeva, “ she hissed.Behind her, Jennsen heard a glass vase hit the floor and shatter. The soundstartled her back to where she was.The emperor frowned at the woman off in the shadows. Her brown eyes were fixedon Jennsen.“I apologize for Sister Perdita’s clumsiness,” Jagang said as he glared at thewoman.“Forgive me, Excellency,” the woman in the dark gray dress said as she backedout between the hangings, bowing all the way.The emperor’s frown turned back to Jennsen.“Now, what was it you said?”Jennsen hadn’t the slightest idea. She knew she’d said something, but she wasn’tsure what. She thought that maybe her grief had tied her tongue in knots rightwhen she went to answer. Her sorrow returned, like a great, grim weight on hershoulders.“You see, Excellency,” Jennsen said as she stared down at her uneaten dinner,“all my life, my father, Darken Rahl, has been trying to murder me because I washis ungifted offspring. When Richard Rahl killed him and assumed rule overD’Hara, he took up in his father’s place, and part of that place was to murderhis ungifted siblings. But in this duty, he was even more vicious than hisfather had been.”Jennsen looked up through watery vision. “Just after I met Sebastian, mybrother’s men finally caught up with us. They brutally murdered my mother. Ifnot for Sebastian being there, they would have had me, too. Sebastian saved mylife. I intend to kill Richard, because, if I don’t, I can’t ever be free. Hewill always send men to hunt me. Besides saving my life, Sebastian helped me tosee that.“Perhaps even more importantly, I must avenge the murder of my mother if I amever to be at peace.”“Our purpose is the welfare of our fellow man. Your story saddens me, and is thevery reason we fight to eradicate the blight of magic.” The emperor finallyshifted his gaze to Sebastian. “I am proud of you for helping this fine youngwoman.”Sebastian had turned moody. She knew how ill at ease he felt under the weight ofpraise. She wished he could feel proud about his accomplishments, hisimportance, his stature with the emperor.He laid his knife down across the scraps of his meal. “Just doing my job,Excellency.”“Well,” Jagang said with an encouraging smile, “I’m glad you’ve returned in timeto see the culmination of your strategy.”Sebastian leaned back, nursing a mug of ale. “Don’t you want to wait for BrotherNarev? Shouldn’t he be here to witness it, if this turns out to be the blow thatends it?”With a thick finger, Jagang pushed an olive around in a little circle on thetable. It was a time before he spoke quietly without looking up.“I’ve not heard from Brother Narev since Altur’Rang fell.”Sebastian came up against the table. “What! Altur’Rang fell? What do you mean?How? When?”Jennsen knew that Altur’Rang was the emperor’s homeland, the city he came from.Sebastian had told her that Brother Narev and the Fellowship of Order werethere, in that great shining city of hope for mankind. A great palace would bebuilt there in homage to the Creator and as a symbol to solidify the unity ofthe Old World.“I received reports not long ago that enemy forces overran the city. Altur’Rangis very distant, and it was cut off. Partly because of winter, the reports werea very long time in reaching me. I await news.“Given this inauspicious turn of fate, I don’t think it wise to wait for BrotherNarev to make it up here. He will be busy throwing the invaders back. If theMother Confessor and Richard Rahl are in Aydindril, we must not wait; we muststrike back swiftly, and with withering force.”Jennsen laid a sympathetic hand on Sebastian’s forearm. “That must have beenwhat you told me about. When I first met you and you told me that Lord Rahl wasinvading your homeland, that must have been what he was after-Altur’Rang.”Sebastian stared at her. “It may be that he isn’t in Aydindril. It may turn outthat he’s still to the south, Jenn, in the Old World. You have to keep that inmind. I don’t want you to invest all your hopes only to have them dashed.”“I hope he is here and it can finally be ended, but, as His Excellency saidabout moving on Aydindril, there is nothing to lose. I didn’t expect to find himhere. If he isn’t in Aydindril, then I’ll still have the help for which youbrought me here in the first place.”“And what is the nature of that help?” Jagang asked.Sebastian answered for her. “I told her that the Sisters might be able to helpwith a spell-so that she can get past all of Lord Rahl’s protection and getclose enough to him to act.”“One way or another, then. If he is in Aydindril, you shall have him.” Jagangplucked up the olive he had been rolling around and popped it in his mouth. “Ifnot, then you shall have the sorceress at your disposal. Whatever help you needfrom the Sisters is yours. You have but to ask, and they will provide it-my wordon that.”His raven eyes were deadly serious.Outside, thunder rumbled. The rain had picked up. Lightning flickered, lightingthe tent from the outside with eerie light that made the candlelight seem allthe darker when each flash of lightning ended, leaving them again in neardarkness, waiting for the roll of thunder.“I just need them to cast me a spell to divert those protecting him, so I canget close enough to him,” Jennsen said after the thunder had died out. She drewher knife from its sheath and held it up to look at the ornate letter “R”engraved in the silver handle. “Then I can put my knife through his evil heart.This knife-his own knife. Sebastian explained how important it is to use what isclosest to an enemy to strike back at them.”“Sebastian has spoken wisely. That is our way, and why, with the Creator’sguidance, we will prevail. Let us pray that we at last have them both and it canfinally be ended, that the scourge of magic will finally be ended, and thatmankind will at last be allowed to live in peace as the Creator intended.”Jennsen and Sebastian both nodded at the invocation.“If we catch them in Aydindril,” Jagang said, looking her in the eyes, “Ipromise that you will be the one to put your blade through his heart, so thatyour mother may finally rest in peace.”“Thank you,” Jennsen whispered in gratitude.He didn’t ask how she could accomplish such a task. Maybe the conviction in hervoice had betrayed the fact that there was more to this than he knew-that shehad some special advantage that would enable her to accomplish such a thing.And there was more to this than he knew, or Sebastian knew.Jennsen had been thinking long and hard about it, putting all the variouselements together. Her whole life had been devoted to thinking about thisproblem. But in the past, her thoughts always revolved around how insoluble itwas, how it was only a matter of time until Lord Rahl caught her and thenightmare began in earnest.She had always been focused on the problem.Now, since meeting Sebastian and the death of her mother, events had acceleratedat a breathtaking pace, but those events had also added, bit by bit, to herunderstanding of the larger picture. Questions were beginning to have answers,answers that seemed so simple, now, looking back on them. She almost felt as if,deep down inside, she must have known all along.Now, she was turning her focus away from the problem; she was beginning to thinkin terms of the solution.Jennsen had learned a great deal from Althea-as it turned out, more, even, thanthe sorceress knew she was revealing. A sorceress of Althea’s power would not betrapped there all those years unless what she said about the beasts in the swampwere true. The snake was different. Friedrich had said that the snake was just asnake.But the beasts were magic.Those beasts kept even a sorceress of Althea’s power locked in her prison.Friedrich said that no one, not even he, could come in by the back way. Tom hadalso said that he had never heard of anyone going in the back way and returningto tell about it. No one used the meadow, either, because of the things thatcame out of that swamp. The things in the swamp were real and they were deadly.All the facts but one were consistent in supporting that.Jennsen had gone in and come out again without ever being approached, much lessattacked or harmed. She had seen nothing of any beasts created from the verysubstance of the gift. That was the one piece that hadn’t fit, at the time. Itdid, now.There had been other indications, too, such as in the People’s Palace, whenJennsen had touched Nyda’s Agiel without it harming her. It had certainly harmedboth Sebastian and Captain Lerner. Nyda had been dumbstruck. She said that noteven Lord Rahl was immune to the touch of an Agiel. Jennsen was.And, Jennsen had been able to bend Nyda’s will to helping, rather than what, byall rights, she should have done, which was to stop this stranger who couldn’tbe touched with the power of an Agiel, stopped a woman who raised so manyunanswered questions, until it all could be sorted out and confirmed. Even whenNathan Rahl tried to stop her, Jennsen had been able to get Nyda to help protecther-from a gifted Rahl. Jennsen knew now that it was more than just a goodbluff. A bluff might have been the kernel, but there was much more wrappedaround it.All of those things and more, over the course of the long and difficult journeyto Aydindril, had at last come together, so that Jennsen finally saw the trueextent of her unique status and why she was the one to kill Richard Rahl.Jennsen had come to understand that she was the only one able to do this-thatshe was born to do this-because, in a central, critical, cardinal way ... shewas invincible.She knew, now, that she had always been invincible."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46From atop Rusty, the chill, gusty breeze ruffling her hair, Jennsen gazed off atthe splendor of the Confessors’ Palace crowning a distance rise. Sebastian satbeside her on a nervous Pete. Emperor Jagang, his magnificent dappled graystallion pawing the road, waited on the other side of Sebastian, a cadre ofofficers and advisors huddled close, but silent. Jagang’s forbidding scowl wasfixed on the palace. Dark, menacing shapes, like a gathering storm, driftedacross the surface of his black eyes.The advance into Aydindril had, so far, been unlike anything anyone hadexpected, leaving everyone tense and on edge.Arrayed behind was a contingent of Sisters of the Light who kept to themselves,apparently concentrating on matters of magic. Although none of the Sisters, asof yet, had had the chance to speak to Jennsen, they were all acutely aware ofher, and kept a close eye on her. Yet more of them had ridden off in variousdirections as the emperor had led the detachment of Imperial Order cavalry, likesome dark floodwater, across farms, roads, and hills, around buildings andbarns, ever onward up roads and then in around buildings, to seep into theoutermost fringes of Aydindril. The great city now lay spread out before them,silent and still.The night before, Sebastian had slept fitfully. Jennsen knew, because, on theeve of such a momentous battle, she had slept hardly at all. Yet, with thethought of finally being able to use the knife sheathed at her belt, she waswide awake.Behind the Sisters, more than forty thousand of the Imperial Order’s elitecavalry waited, some with pikes and lances poised at the ready, some with swordsor axes in hand. Each wore a ring through his left nostril. While most worebeards, and some had long, dark, greasy hair, with good luck charms tied in,there were quite a few with shaved heads, apparently out of open fealty toEmperor Jagang. They were all a tightly coiled spring, destroyers, poised tostorm into the city.Besides being elite members of the cavalry, trusted officers, or Sisters of theLight, every person there, except Jennsen and Sebastian, had one essential thingin common: they knew the Mother Confessor by sight. From what Jennsen was ableto gather, the Mother Confessor had led raids on the Order’s camp and had beenat battles where she had been seen by a number of the men, as well as theSisters. All those chosen to ride into Aydindril with the emperor had to knowthe Mother Confessor by sight. Jagang didn’t want her slipping out of theirsnare by hiding in crowds of people, or escaping by pretending to be a lowlywashwoman. Such a worry had evaporated in the light of what they had so farfound.Chilled not only by the breeze, but by the lust for battle gleaming in thesoldiers’ eyes, Jennsen gripped the horn of her saddle tight in an attempt tomake her hands stop trembling.Jennsen.For the hundredth time that morning, she checked that her knife was clear in itsscabbard. After reassuring herself, she pressed it back down, feeling thesatisfying metallic click as it seated. She was there with the army because shewas a part of this, with a job to do.Surrender.She thought about the irony of how this was the very knife that Lord Rahl hadgiven a man he sent to kill her, and now she was bringing that same knife, athing close to him, back to defeat him.At last, she was the hunter, and not the hunted.Whenever she felt her courage waver, she had but to think of her mother, orAlthea and Friedrich, or Althea’s sister, Lathea, or even Jennsen’s unknown halfbrother, the Raug’Moss healer, Drefan. So many lives had been ruined or forfeitbecause of the House of Rahl, because of Lord Rahl-first her father, DarkenRahl, and now her half brother, Richard Rahl.Surrender your will, Jennsen. Surrender your flesh.“Leave me be,” she snapped, annoyed that the voice wouldn’t leave her alone andat having to repeat it so often when she had important things on her mind.Sebastian frowned over at her. “What?”Chagrined that she had inadvertently said it aloud this time, Jennsen simplyshook her head as if to say it was nothing. He turned back to his own thoughtsas he watched the city spread out before them, studying the imposing maze oftight buildings, streets, and alleyways. There was only one thing missing fromthe city, and that had everyone tense and jumpy.From the corner of her eye, Jennsen saw the Sisters all whispering amongthemselves. All except one, Sister Perdita, the one in the dark gray dress andthe salt and pepper hair loosely tied back. When their eyes met, the womansmiled in that knowing, self-satisfied smirk of hers that seemed able to lookright into Jennsen’s soul. Jennsen thought that it probably looked different toher than the woman intended, so she bowed her head slightly in acknowledgmentand smiled all the smile she could muster before turning away.Along with everyone else, Jennsen watched the palace in the distance, on a hilloverlooking the city. It was hard not to look at it, the way it stood outagainst the gray walls of mountains like snow on slate. Tall windows fronted thebuilding between towering white marble columns topped with gold capitals. To therear, at the center, a domed roof with a belt of windows rose up well clear ofthe high walls. Jennsen had trouble reconciling the splendor of such a beautifulbuilding with the wicked rule of the Mother Confessor.The sinister specter of the Wizard’s Keep, high up on a mountain behind thepalace, seemed like it would be more fitting for the Mother Confessor. Jennsennoticed that no one liked looking up at that baleful place; their eyes werealways quick to turn to less unnerving sights.The Keep watching down on them was larger than any man-made thing Jennsen hadever seen, save the People’s Palace in D’Hara. Ragged gray clouds floated pastdark stone exterior walls that soared to staggering heights. The Keep itself,behind those lofty walls, appeared to be a complex collection of battlements,ramparts, crenellated walls, towers, spires, and connecting bridges andwalkways. Jennsen had never imagined that anything made of stone could look soalive with menace.In the quiet, her gaze sought solace in Sebastian’s spikes of white hair, hisknowing eyes, the familiar contours of his face. His handsome features werecomforting to her, even if he didn’t look her way. What woman wouldn’t behonored to have the love of a man like him? If not for him being there with hersince her mother’s death, Jennsen didn’t know what she would have done, how shewould have gotten by.Sebastian wore his cloak laid back to expose some of his weapons. He surveyedthe scene with studied calm. She wished she could feel so calm. It frightenedher, unexpectedly, to contemplate him having to draw those weapons, of himhaving to fight for his life.“What do you think?” she whispered as she leaned closer to him. “What could itmean?”He gave her a brief shake of his head along with a harsh glance. He didn’t wantto discuss it. That curt gesture told her that she was supposed to be quiet. Shehad known, of course, by the silence of tens of thousands of men right behindher that she was supposed to be quiet, but the anxiety was twisting her insidesinto a knot. She had only wanted a small token of reassurance. Instead, hisabrupt snub cut her down, making her feel like a small nobody.She knew that he had important things on his mind, but his brusque dismissalstill stung like a slap, especially after the night before when he had sodesperately wanted her comfort, wanted her as fiercely as he had ever wantedher. She had understood. She hadn’t turned him away, even though she found itdistressing that they weren’t alone, but had guards standing right outside whoshe suspected could hear everything.Of course, she knew that this was not the time or place he could afford to giveher comfort; they were all on the brink of battle. Still, it hurt.Over the sound of the wind moaning through the bare branches of majestic, maturemaple trees lining the road, she picked up the sound of hooves at a gallop. Alleyes turned to watch bearded, long-haired men, streamers of fur and hidestrailing out behind as they hunched forward over their horses’ withers, chargingin from the road on the right. Jennsen recognized them by the lead horse’spatchy white, pied coloration. They were one of the small reconnoitering partiesthe emperor had sent ahead hours before. In the distance to the west, theircounterpart was returning from the opposite direction, but they were yet tinyspecks riding down out of the far foothills.As the first group of horsemen came storming in before the emperor and hisadvisors, Jennsen covered her mouth with the edge of her cloak to mask hercoughing on the cloud of dust.The husky man at the lead of the riders pulled his pied horse around.His greasy strings of hair whipped around like the horse’s white tail. “Nothing,Excellency.”Jagang, looking in a foul mood and near the end of patience, shifted his weightin his saddle. “Nothing.”“No, Excellency, nothing. No sign of troops anywhere to the east, or on the farside of the city, or all the way up the slopes of the mountains. Nothing. Theroads, the trails-all deserted. No people, no tracks, no horse dung, no wagonruts ... nothing. We could find no sign that anyone has been here for a goodlong time.”The man went on with a detailed account of where they had looked, but withoutresult, as the other knot of men thundered in from the west, their horseslathered and in a high state of excitement.“No one!” the man at the front called out as he hauled in on the reins, layinghis horse’s head over. The horse, eyes wild and keyed up from the hard ride,pivoted around to a halt before the emperor, snorting through flared nostrils.“Excellency, there are no troops-or anyone-to the west.”Jagang glared at the Confessors’ Palace. “What about the road up to the Keep?”he asked in a quiet growl. “Or are you going to tell me that my scouts andpatrols were ambushed by the ghosts of all the vanished people! “The brawny man, layered in hides, looked as fierce as anyone Jennsen had everseen. His top teeth were missing, adding to his savage aspect. He cast acautious look back up at the wide ribbon of road that wound its way up from thecity toward the Wizard’s Keep. He turned back to the emperor.“Excellency, there were no tracks on the road up to the Keep, either.”“Did you go all the way up to the Keep to check?” he asked, his dark gazeturning on the man.The man swallowed under the hot scrutiny of Jagang’s glower. “There is a stonebridge, not far from the top, that crosses a great crevasse. We went that far,Excellency, but still saw no one, nor any tracks. The portcullis was lowered.Beyond, the Keep showed no sign of life.”“That means nothing,” a woman not far behind scoffed.Jennsen turned, along with Sebastian, most of the advisors, officers, andJagang, to look at her. It was Sister Perdita who had spoken. At least shemanaged to keep most of the superior smirk off her face as everyone stared ather.“It means nothing,” she repeated. “I’m telling you, Excellency, I don’t likethis one bit. Something is wrong.”“Something? Like what?” Jagang asked, his voice low and surly.Sister Perdita left the company of several dozen Sisters of the Light and walkedher horse forward to speak more privately to the emperor.“Excellency,” she said only after she was close, “have you ever walked into awood, and realized that there were no sounds, when there should be? That it hadsuddenly gone quiet?”Jennsen had. She was struck by how accurately the Sister had hit upon thepeculiar, uneasy feeling she was having a kind of portent to doom, yet withoutdefinable cause, that made the fine hairs at the back of her neck stand on endlike when she would be lying in her bedroll, almost asleep, and every insect,all at once, went silent.Jagang glared at Sister Perdita. “When I walk into a wood, or anywhere, italways goes silent.”The Sister didn’t argue, but simply started over. “Excellency, we have foughtthese people long and hard. Those of us with the gift know their tricks withmagic. We know when they are using their gift. We’ve learned to know if they’veused magic to set traps, even if those traps are not themselves magic. But thisis different. Something is wrong.”“You still have not told me what,” Jagang said with restrained, impatientirritation, as if he didn’t have time for someone who wouldn’t come to thepoint.The woman, noting his annoyance, bowed her head. “Excellency, I would tell youif I knew. It is my duty to advise you of what I know. We can detect no magicbeing used-none. We sense no traps that have ever been touched by the gift.“But that knowledge still does not set my mind at ease. Something is wrong. I’mtelling you, now, my warning, even though I admit that I don’t know the cause ofmy concern. You have but to search my mind for yourself and you will see I’mspeaking the truth.”Jennsen had no idea what the Sister meant, but after staring at her for amoment, Jagang visibly cooled. He grunted dismissively as he looked back towardthe palace. “I think you’re just nervous after a long idle winter, Sister. Asyou said, you know their tactics and tricks with magic, so if it was somethingreal, you and your Sisters would know it and know the cause.”“I’m not sure that’s true,” Sister Perdita pressed. She cast a quick, troubledglance at the Wizard’s Keep up on the mountain. “Excellency, we know a greatdeal about magic. But the Keep is thousands of years old. Being from the OldWorld, that place is outside my experience. I know next to nothing about thespecific kinds of magic which are likely to be kept in that place, except thatwhatever magic is kept there will be dangerous in the extreme. That is onepurpose of a Keep-to safeguard such things.”“That’s why I want the Keep taken,” Jagang shot back. “Those dangerous thingsmust not be left in the enemy’s hands to later deal us murder.”With her fingertips, Sister Perdita patiently rubbed the creases in her brow.“The Keep is strongly warded. I can’t tell how; the wards were set by wizards,not sorceresses. Such wards could easily have been left untended-no one needsstand guard. Such wards can be triggered by simple trespass-much as with anytrap without magic. Such wards can be cautionary, but, just as likely, they canbe deadly. Even if the place is deserted, those wards could easily killanyone-anyone-who so much as tries to get close, much less take the place. Suchdefensive measures are timeless; they do not wear away. They are just aseffective whether they’ve been there for a month or a millennia. The attempt totake a place so warded could deal us the murder we are trying to avoid.”Jagang nodded as he listened. “We still must untangle those wards so we can gainthe Keep.”Sister Perdita glanced over her shoulder at the dark stone Keep far up on themountainside before she spoke. “Excellency, as I have often tried to explain,our degree of ability and aggregate power doesn’t mean we can untangle or defeatthose wards. Such a thing is not directly relational. A bear, strong as he is,can’t open a lock on a strongbox. Strength isn’t necessarily the key to suchthings. I’m telling you that I don’t like this, that something is wrong.”“You have told me only that you are afraid. Of all those with magic, the Sistersare exceptionally well armed. That is the reason you’re here.” Jagang leanedtoward the woman, his patience appearing to be at an end. “I expect the Sistersto stop any threat from magic. Must I make it any more clear?”Sister Perdita paled. “No, Excellency.” After a bow from her saddle, she pulledher horse around to rejoin her Sisters.“Sister Perdita,” Jagang called after her. He waited until she turned back. “AsI’ve told you before, we must gain the Wizard’s Keep. I don’t care how many ofyou it takes, only that it gets done.”As she returned to her Sisters to discuss the matter, Jagang, along witheveryone else, caught sight of a lone rider racing toward them from the city.Something about the look on the man’s face had everyone checking their weapons.They all waited in tense silence until his horse skidded to a stop before theemperor. The man was drenched in sweat and his narrow-set eyes were wide withexcitement, but he kept his voice under control.“Excellency, I saw no one-no one-in the city. But I smelled horses.”Jennsen saw apprehension etched on the faces of the officers at this furtherconfirmation of their disbelief of the preposterous notion that the city wasdeserted. The Order had driven the enemy forces to Aydindril as winter haddescended, trapping not only the army but the people of the city as well. How aplace this large could be evacuated-in the dead of winter-was beyond theirimagination. Yet no one seemed willing to voice that conviction too strongly tothe emperor as he stared out upon an empty city.“Horses?” Jagang frowned. “Maybe it was a stable.”“No, Excellency. I could not find them, nor hear them, but I could smell them.It was not the smell of a stable, but horses. There are horses there. ““Then the enemy is here, just as we thought” one of the officers said to Jagang.“They’re hiding, but they’re here.”Jagang said nothing as he waited for the man to go on.“Excellency, there is more,” the burly soldier said, nearly bursting withexcitement. “As I searched, I could not find the horses anywhere, so I decidedto return for more men to help ferret out the cowardly enemy.“As I was returning, I saw someone in a window of the palace.”Jagang’s gaze abruptly turned to the man. “What?”The soldier pointed. “In the white palace, Excellency. As I rode out from behinda wall at the edge of the city, before the palace grounds, I saw someone on thesecond floor move away from a window.”With an angry yank on the reins, Jagang checked his stallion’s impatientsidesteps. “Are you sure?”The man nodded vigorously. “Yes, Excellency. The windows there are tall. On mylife, just as I came out from behind the wall and looked up, someone saw me andmoved back from a window.”The emperor peered intently up the road lined with maple trees, toward thepalace, as he considered this new development.“Man or woman?” Sebastian asked.The rider paused to wipe sweat from his eyes and to swallow in an effort tocatch his breath. “It was the briefest look, but I believe it was a woman.”Jagang turned his dark glare on the man. “Was it her?”The maple branches clattered together in the gusts as all eyes watched the man.“Excellency, I could not tell for certain. It might have been a reflection ofthe light on the window, but in that brief look, I thought I saw that she waswearing a long white dress.”The Mother Confessor wore a white dress. Jennsen thought it was prettyfar-fetched to believe it could be a coincidence that there would be areflection on the glass right as a person moved away from the window, areflection that made it look like they were wearing the white dress of theMother Confessor.Yet, it made no sense to Jennsen. Why would the Mother Confessor be alone in herpalace? Making a last stand was one thing. Making it alone was quite another.Could it be, as the man suggested, that the enemy was cowardly and hiding?Sebastian idly tapped a finger against his thigh. “I wonder what they’re up to.”Jagang drew his sword. “I guess we’ll find out.” He looked, then, at Jennsen.“Keep that knife of yours handy, girl. This may be the day you’ve been prayingfor.”“But Excellency, how could it possibly-”The emperor stood in his stirrups and flashed a wicked grin back to his cavalry.He circled his sword high in the air.The coiled spring was unleashed.With a deafening roar, forty thousand men loosed a pent-up battle cry as theycharged away. Jennsen gasped and held on to Rusty for dear life as the horseleaped into a gallop ahead of the cavalry racing toward the palace."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47Nearly out of breath, Jennsen bent forward over Rusty, stretching her arms outto each side of the horse’s neck to give her all the reins she needed as theycharged at a full gallop out of the fringes of the countryside toward thesprawling city of Aydindril. The roar of forty thousand men yelling battle criesalong with the thundering hooves was as frightening as it was deafening.Yet, the rush of it all, the heart-pounding sensation of wild abandon, was alsointoxicating. Not that she didn’t grasp the enormity, the horror, of what washappening, but some small part of her couldn’t help being swept up with theintense emotion of being a part of it all.Fierce men with blood lust in their eyes fanned out to the sides as they racedahead. The air seemed alive with light flashing off all the swords and axes heldhigh, the sharpened points of lances and pikes piercing the muted morning air.The scintillating sights, the swell of sounds, the swirling passions, all filledJennsen with the hunger to draw her knife, but she didn’t; she knew the timewould come.Sebastian rode near her, making sure she was safe and didn’t become lost in thecrazy, headlong, willful stampede. The voice rode with her, too, and would notremain silent, despite how she tried to ignore it, or begged in her mind for itto leave her be. She needed to focus on what was happening, on what might soonhappen. She couldn’t afford the distraction. Not now.As it called her name, called for her to surrender her will, to surrender herflesh, called to her in mysterious but strangely seductive words, thesurrounding roar of masking sound gave Jennsen the anonymity to finally screamat the top of her lungs “Let me be! Leave me alone!” without anyone noticing. Itwas a heady purification to be able to banish the voice with such unrestrainedforce and authority.In what seemed an instant, they suddenly plunged into the city, leaping overfences, skirting poles, and flying past buildings with bewildering speed. Withthe way they had been in the open and then abruptly had to deal with all thethings around them, it reminded her of racing into a stand of woods.The wild charge was not what she had imagined it would be-an ordered marshaledrun across open ground-but instead was a mad dash through a great city; alongwide thoroughfares lined with magnificent buildings; then veering suddenly downdark canyonlike alleys made of tall stone walls that in some places bridged thenarrow slice of open sky overhead; and then abruptly impetuous dashes throughwarrens of narrow twisting side streets among ancient, windowless buildings laidout to no design. There was no slowing for deliberation or decision, but,rather, it was one long, reckless, relentless rush.It was made all the more surreal because there were no people anywhere. Thereshould have been crowds scattering in wild panic, diving out of the way,screaming. In her mind’s eye, she overlaid scenes she had seen in cities before:peddlers pushing carts with everything from fish to fine linen; shopkeepersoutside their businesses tending tables of bread, cheese, meat, wine; craftsmendisplaying shoes, clothes, wigs, and leather goods; windows filled with wares.Now, all those windows were strangely empty-some boarded up, some just left asif the owner would be opening any minute. All the windows lining their routestood empty. Streets, benches, parks, were mute witness to the onslaught ofcavalry.It was frightening to charge at full speed through the convoluted maze ofstreets, cutting around buildings and obstacles, dashing down dirt alleyways,flying at full speed along curving cobblestone roads, cresting rises only toplummet down the far side, like some bizarre, headlong, out of control snow sledride plunging down an icy hill through the trees, and just as dangerous.Sometimes, as they galloped half a dozen abreast, the way suddenly narrowed witha wall or a corner of a building that stuck out. More than one rider went downwith calamitous results. Buildings, colors, fences, poles, and intersectingstreets flashed by in dizzying array.Without the resistance of an enemy force, the unbridled rush felt to Jennsenlike it was out of all control, yet she knew that these were the elite cavalry,so a wanton charge was their specialty. Besides, Emperor Jagang looked incomplete control atop his magnificent stallion.The horses kicked up a shower of sod as they suddenly broke past a wide openingin a wall to find themselves charging up the expansive lawns of the Confessors’Palace. The fury of yelling riders spread out to each side, their horses tearingup the picturesque setting, the crude and filthy bloodthirsty invaders defilingthe deceptively serene beauty of the grounds. Jennsen rode beside Sebastian, notfar behind the emperor and several of his officers, between wide-spread flanksof howling men, straight up the wide promenade lined with mature maple trees,their bare branches, heavy with buds, laced together overhead.Despite everything she had learned, everything she knew, everything she helddear, Jennsen couldn’t understand why she felt such a sense of being aparticipant in a profane violation.The impression melted away as she focused her attention instead on something shespotted ahead. It stood not far from the wide marble steps leading up to thegrand entrance of the Confessors’ Palace. It looked like a lone pole withsomething atop it. A long red cloth tied near the top of the shaft of the poleflew and flapped in the breeze, as if waving to them, calling for theirattention, giving them all, at last, a destination. Emperor Jagang led thecharge directly toward that pole with its red flag flying.As they raced across the lawns, she concentrated on the heat of Rusty’s obedientand powerful muscles flexing beneath her, finding reassurance in her horse’sfamiliar movements. Jennsen couldn’t help gazing up at the white marble columnstowering above them. It was a majestic entrance, imposing, yet elegant andwelcoming. This day, the Imperial Order was at last to own the place where evilhad, for so long, ruled unopposed.Emperor Jagang held his sword high, signaling the cavalry to halt. The cheering,yelling, screaming battle cries died out as tens of thousands of men, all atonce, brought their excited horses down from a charge to a stop. It amazed her,what with so many men with weapons out, that it all happened in seconds andwithout carnage.Jennsen patted the sweaty side of Rusty’s neck before sliding down off herhorse. She hit the ground among a confusion of men, mostly officers andadvisors, but regular cavalry, too, all swarming in to protect the emperor. Shehad never been this close in among the regular soldiers before. They wereintimidating as they eyed her in their midst. They all seemed impatient for anenemy to fight. The men were a filthy, grimy lot, and smelled worse than theirhorses. For some reason, it was that suffocating, sweaty, foul stink thatfrightened her the most.Sebastian’s hand seized her arm and pulled her close. “Are you all right?”Jennsen nodded, trying to see the emperor and what had stopped him. Sebastian,trying to see as well, pulled her along with him as he stepped through a screenof burly officers. Seeing it was him, they made way.She and Sebastian halted when they saw the emperor standing several paces ahead,alone, his back to them, his shoulders slumped, his sword hanging from his fistat his side. It appeared that all his men were afraid to approach him.Jennsen, with Sebastian quickly moving to catch up, closed the distance to reachemperor Jagang. He stood frozen before the spear planted butt end in the ground.He stared with those completely black eyes as if seeing an apparition. Tiedbeneath the long, barbed, razor-sharp metal point of the spear, the long redcloth flapped in the otherwise complete silence.Atop the spear was a man’s head.Jennsen winced at the arresting sight. The gaunt head, severed cleanly atmid-neck, looked almost alive. The dark eyes, beneath a deeply hooded brow, werefixed in an unblinking stare. A dark, creased cap rested halfway down theforehead. Somehow, the austere cap pressed down on the head seemed to match thesevere countenance of the man. Wisps of wiry hair curled out from above his earsto ruffle in the wind. It seemed as if the thin lips, at any moment, might givethem a forbidding smile from the world of the dead. The face looked as if theman, in life, had been as grim as death itself.The way Emperor Jagang stood stupefied, staring at the head right before himimpaled on the point of the spear, and the way not one of the thousands of menso much as coughed, had Jennsen’s heart hammering faster than when she had beenriding Rusty at a reckless gallop.Jennsen cautiously peered over at Sebastian. He, too, stood stunned. Her fingerstightened on his arm in sympathy for the look in his wide, tearful eyes. Hefinally leaned closer to her in order to whisper in a choked voice.“Brother Narev.”The shock of those two barely audible words hit Jennsen like a slap. It was thegreat man himself, the spiritual leader of the entire Old World, EmperorJagang’s friend and closest personal advisor-a man who Sebastian believed wascloser to the Creator than any man who had ever been born, a man whose teachingsSebastian religiously lived by, dead, his head impaled on a spear.The emperor reached out and pulled free a small, folded piece of paper that wasstuck in the side of Brother Narev’s cap. As Jennsen watched Jagang’s thickfingers open the carefully folded small piece of paper, it reminded herunexpectedly of the way she had unfolded the paper she had found on the D’Haransoldier that fateful day she had discovered him lying dead at the bottom of theravine, the day she had met Sebastian. The day before Lord Rahl’s men hadfinally located her and killed her mother.Emperor Jagang lifted the paper out to silently read what it said. For afrightening long time, he just stared at the paper. At last, his arm lowered tohis side. His chest heaved with a terrible, burgeoning wrath as he stared oncemore at Brother Narev’s head on the end of the spear. In a smoldering voice,bitter with indignation, Jagang repeated the words from the note just loudenough for those standing close to hear.“Compliments of Richard Rahl.”The stiff wind moaned through a stand of nearby trees. No one said a word asthey all waited on Emperor Jagang for direction.Jennsen’s nose wrinkled at a foul smell. She looked up to see the head, soperfect only moments before, beginning to putrefy before her very eyes. Theflesh sagged heavily. The bottom eyelids drooped, revealing their redundersides. The jaw sank. The thin line of the mouth opened, almost looking asif the head were letting out a scream.Jennsen, along with everyone else, including Emperor Jagang, took a step back asthe flesh of the face decayed in sudden ghastly ruptures, revealing festeringtissue beneath. The tongue swelled as the jaw dropped lower. The eyeballs sankforward out of their sockets as they shriveled. Reeking flesh fell away inclumps.What would have been long months of decomposition took place in a matter ofseconds, leaving the skull beneath that creased cap grinning at them throughtattered bits of hanging flesh.“It had a web of magic around it, Excellency,” Sister Perdita said, almostsounding as if she were answering a question unspoken. Jennsen hadn’t heard hercome up behind them. “The spell preserved it in that condition until you pulledthe note from the cap, triggering the dissolution of the magic preserving it.Once that magic was withdrawn, the ... remains went through the decompositionthat would ordinarily have taken place.”Emperor Jagang was staring at her with cold dark eyes. What he might bethinking, Jennsen couldn’t be sure, but she could see the fury building withinthose nightmare eyes.“It was a very complex and powerful ward that preserved it until the rightperson touched it-to pull the note free,” Sister Perdita said in a quiet voice.“The ward was likely keyed to your touch, Excellency.”For a long, terrifying moment, Jennsen feared that Emperor Jagang might suddenlyswing his sword with a wild cry and behead the woman.To the side, an officer suddenly pointed up at the Confessors’ Palace.“Look! It’s her!”“Dear Creator,” Sebastian whispered as he, too, looked up and saw someone in thewindow.Other men yelled that they saw her, too. Jennsen rose up on tiptoes, trying tosee around the tall soldiers rushing forward, and the officers pointing, pastthe reflections on the glass, to the person she saw back within the darkinterior. She shielded her eyes, trying to see better. Men whispered excitedly.“There!” another officer on the other side of Jagang cried out. “Look! It’s LordRahl! There! It’s Lord Rahl! “Jennsen froze from the jolt of those words. It didn’t seem real. She ran theman’s words through her mind again, so shocking were they to hear that she feltshe had to check again if it really was what she thought she had heard.“There!” another man yelled. “Moving down that way! It’s both of them!”“I see them,” Jagang growled as he tracked the two fleeing figures in his blackglare. “I’d recognize that bitch in the farthest reaches of the underworld. Andthere! -Lord Rahl is with her!”Jennsen could catch only fleeting flashes of two figures racing away pastwindows.Emperor Jagang sliced the air with his sword, signaling his men. “Surround thepalace so they can’t escape!” He turned to his officers. “I want the assaultcompany to come with me! And a dozen Sisters! Sister Perdita-stay with theSisters out here. Don’t let anyone get by you!”His gaze sought Sebastian and Jennsen. When he found them among those standingclose he fixed Jennsen in his hot glare.“If you want your chance, girl, then come with me!”Jennsen realized, as she and Sebastian raced away after Emperor Jagang, that shehad her knife clenched in her fist.Close on Jagang’s heels, in the shadows of towering marble columns, Jennsenraced up the wide expanse of white marble steps. Sebastian’s reassuring hand wason the small of her back the whole way. Fierce determination etched the faces ofthe savage men bounding up the steps all around her.The men of the assault company, sheathed in layers of leather armor, chain mail,and tough hides, wielded short swords, huge crescent axes, or wicked flails inone hand, while on their other arm they all carried round metal shields forprotection, but the shields were also set with long center spikes to make themweapons as well. The men were even swathed with belts and straps set withsharpened studs to make grappling with them in hand-to-hand combat treacherous,at best. Jennsen couldn’t imagine anyone with the nerve to go against suchvicious men.Storming up the steps, the burly soldiers growled like animals, crashing throughthe carved double doors as if they were made of sticks, never checking to see ifthe doors might be unlocked. Jennsen shielded her face with an arm as she flewthrough the shower of splintered wood fragments.The thunder of the men’s boots echoed through the grand hall inside. Tallwindows of pale blue glass set between polished white marble pillars threwslashes of light across the marble floor where the assault force stormedthrough. Men hooked the marble railing with big hands and swooped up the firststairway, going for the upper floors where they had seen the Mother Confessorand Lord Rahl. The sound of the soldiers’ boots on stone echoed up through thehigh-ceilinged stairwell decorated with ornate moldings.Jennsen couldn’t help being wildly excited that this might be the day it allended. She was but one mighty thrust of her knife from freedom. She was the oneto do it. She was the only one who could. She was invincible.The fact that she was going to kill a man was only dimly important to her. Asshe raced up the steps, she thought only about the horror Lord Rahl had broughtto her life and the lives of others. Filled with righteous rage, she intended toend it once and for all.Sebastian, racing right along with her, had his sword out. A dozen of the bigbrutes were in front of her, led by Emperor Jagang himself. Behind were hundredsmore of the grim assault force, all determined to deliver merciless violence tothe enemy. Between her and those charging soldiers behind, Sisters of the Lightran up the steps, without weapons but for their gift.At the top of the flight of stairs, they all bunched to a halt on a slick oakfloor. Emperor Jagang looked both ways down the hall.One of the panting Sisters pushed through the men. “Excellency! This makes nosense!”His only answer was a glare as he caught his breath, before his gaze moved,searching for his prey.“Excellency,” the Sister insisted, if more quietly, “why would two people-soimportant to their cause-be alone here in the palace? Alone without even a guardat the door? It doesn’t make sense. They would not be here alone.”Jennsen, as much as she wanted Lord Rahl under her knife, had to agree. It madeno sense.“Who says they’re alone?” Jagang asked. “Do you sense any conjuring of magic?”He was right, of course. They might go through a door and encounter a surpriseof a thousand swords waiting for them. But that chance seemed remote. It seemedmore logical that a protecting force, if there was one here, would not havewanted to allow them to all get inside.“No,” the Sister answered. “I sense no magic. But that doesn’t mean it can’t becalled in an instant. Excellency, you are endangering yourself needlessly. Thisis dangerous to go chasing after such people when there are so many things aboutit that make no sense.”She stopped short of calling it foolish. Jagang, seeming to pay minimalattention to the Sister as she spoke, signaled to his men, sending a dozenracing off in each direction down the hall. A snap of his fingers and a quickgesture sent a Sister with each group.“You’re thinking like a green army officer,” Jagang said to the Sister. “TheMother Confessor is far more sly and ten times as cunning as you give her creditfor. She is smarter than to think in such simple terms. You’ve seen some of thethings she’s pulled off. I’ll not let her get away with this one.”“Then, why would she and Lord Rahl be here alone?” Jennsen asked when she sawthat the Sister feared to speak up further. “Why would they allow themselves tobe so vulnerable?”“Where better to hide than in an empty city?” Jagang asked. “An empty palace?Any guards would tip us to their presence.”“But why would they even hide here, of all places?”“Because they know that their cause is in jeopardy. They’re cowards and want toevade capture. When people are desperate and in a panic, they often run fortheir home to hide in a place they know.” Jagang hooked a thumb behind his beltas he analyzed the layout of halls around him. “This is her home. In the end,it’s only their own hides that they think of, not that of their fellow man.”Jennsen couldn’t help herself from pressing, even as Sebastian was pulling herback, urging her to be quiet. She threw her arm out toward the expanse ofwindows. “Why would they allow themselves to be seen, then? If they’re trying tohide, as you suggest, then why would they let themselves be spotted?”“They’re evil!” He leveled his terrible eyes at her. “They wanted to watch mefind Brother Narev’s remains. They wanted to see me discover their profane andheinous butchery of a great man. They simply couldn’t resist such sick delight!”“But-”“Let’s go!” he called to his men.As the emperor charged off, Jennsen seized Sebastian’s arm in exasperation,holding him back. “Do you really think it could be them? You’re a strategist-doyou honestly think that any of this makes sense?”He noted which way the emperor went, followed by a flood of men charging afterhim, then turned a heated glare on her.“Jennsen, you wanted Lord Rahl. This may be your chance.”“But I don’t see why-”“Don’t argue with me! Who are you to think you know better!”“Sebastian, I-”“I don’t have all the answers! That’s why we’re in here!”Jennsen swallowed past the lump in her throat. “I’m only worried for you,Sebastian, and Emperor Jagang. I don’t want your heads to end up on the end of apike, too.”“In war, you must act, not only by careful plan, but when you see an opening.This is what war is like-in war people sometimes do stupid or even seeminglycrazy things. Maybe she and Lord Rahl have simply done something stupid. Youhave to take advantage of an enemy’s mistakes. In war, the winner is often theone who attacks no matter what and presses any advantage. There isn’t alwaystime to figure everything out.”Jennsen could only stare up into his eyes. Who was she, a nobody, to try to tellan emperor’s strategist how to fight a war?“Sebastian, I was only-”He snatched a fistful of her dress and yanked her close. His red face twisted inanger. “Are you really going to throw away what might turn out to be your onlychance to avenge your mother’s murder? How would you feel if Richard Rahl reallyis crazy enough to be here?-Or if he has some plan we can’t even conceive of?-And you just stand here arguing about it!”Jennsen was stunned. Could he be right? What if he was?“There they are!” came a cry from far down the hall. It was Jagang’s voice. Shesaw him among a distant clot of his soldiers, pointing his sword as they allscrambled to turn a corner. “Get them! Get them!”Sebastian seized her arm, spun her around, and shoved her on down the hall.Jennsen caught her footing and ran with wild abandon. She felt ashamed forarguing with people who knew what war was all about when she didn’t. Who did shethink she was, anyway? She was a nobody. Great men had given her a chance, andshe stood around on the doorstep of greatness, arguing about it. She felt afool.As they ran past tall windows-the very windows where the Mother Confessor andLord Rahl had only moments before been seen something outside caught her eye. Acollective groan went up from beyond the panes of glass. Jennsen slid to a stop,her hands out, gathering up Sebastian to stop him, too.“Look!”Sebastian glanced impatiently toward the others racing away, then stepped closerto look out the window as she shook her hand, frantically pointing.Tens of thousand of cavalry men had formed up into a huge battle line out acrossthe palace grounds, stretching all the way down the hill, appearing to chargethe enemy in a great battle. They all brandished swords, axes, and pikes as theyrushed as a single mass, yelling bloodcurdling battle cries.Jennsen watched in stunned silence, seeing nothing yet for them to fight. Still,the men, raising a great cry, ran forward with weapons raised. She expected tosee them run down the hill toward something out beyond the wall. Perhaps theycould see an enemy approaching that she could not from her angle up in thepalace.But then, in the middle of the grounds, with a mighty shock all along the line,there was a resounding crash as they met the wall of an enemy that was notthere.Jennsen couldn’t believe her eyes. Her mind groped to reconcile it, but theterrifying sight outside made no sense. She wouldn’t have believed what she wasseeing, were it not for the shock of sudden carnage. Bodies, man and horse, wererent open. Horses reared. Others went down, tumbling over broken legs. Men’sheads and arms spun through the air, as if lopped off by sword and axe. Allalong the line, blood filled the air. Men were driven back by blows thatexploded through their bodies. The dark and grimy force of Imperial Ordercavalry was suddenly bright red in the muted daylight. The slaughter was sohorrific that the green grass was left red in a swath down the hill.Where there had been battle cries, now there were piercing screams of appallingsuffering and pain as men, hacked to pieces, limbs severed, mortally wounded,tried to drag themselves to safety. Out in that field, there was no such place,there was only confusion and death.Horrified, Jennsen looked up into Sebastian’s baffled expression. Before eithercould say a word, the building shook as if struck by lightning. Following closeon the heels of the thunderous boom, the hall filled with billowing smoke.Flames boiled toward them. Sebastian snatched her arm and dove with her into aside hall opposite the window.The blast roared down the hall, driving chunks of wood, whole chairs, andflaming drapery before it. Fragments of glass and metal shrieked by, slicingthrough walls.As soon as the smoke and flames had rolled past, Jennsen and Sebastian, bothwith weapons to hand, raced out into the hall, running in the direction EmperorJagang had gone.Whatever questions or objections she had were forgotten-such questions weresuddenly irrelevant. It only mattered that-somehow-Richard Rahl was there. Shehad to stop him. This was finally her chance. The voice, too, urged her on. Thistime, she didn’t try to put the voice down. This time, she let it fan the flamesof her burning lust for vengeance. This time, she let it fill her with theoverwhelming need to kill.They raced past tall doors lining the hall. Each of the deep-set windows thatflashed by had a small window seat. The walls were faced with frame and panelwood painted a shade of white warmed with a bit of rose color to it. As theycame to the intersection of corridors and rounded the corner, Jennsen didn’treally notice the elegant silver reflector lamps centered in each of thosepanels; she saw only the bloody handprints smeared along the walls, the longsplashes of blood on the polished oak floor, the disorderly tangle of stillbodies.There were at least fifty of the burly assault soldiers scattered haphazardlydown the hall, each burned, many ripped open by flying glass and splinteredwood. Most of the faces weren’t even unrecognizable as such. Shattered rib bonesprotruded from blood-soaked chain mail or leather. Along with the weapons thatlay scattered, the hall was awash with gore and loose intestines, making it looklike someone had spilled baskets of bloody dead eels.Among the bodies was a woman-one of the Sisters. She had been nearly torn intwo, as had been a number of the men, her slashed face set in death with a fixedlook of surprise.Jennsen gagged on the stench of blood, hardly able to draw a breath, as shefollowed Sebastian, jumping from one clear space to another, trying not to slipand fall on the human viscera. The horror of what Jennsen was seeing was soprofound that it didn’t register in her mind; at least, it didn’t registeremotionally. She simply acted, as if in a dream, not really able to considerwhat she was seeing.Once past the bodies, they followed a trail of blood down a maze of grand halls.The distant sound of men shouting drifted back to them. Jennsen was at leastrelieved to hear the emperor’s voice among them. They sounded like hounds lockedon the scent of a fox, baying insistently, refusing to lose their prey.“Sir!” a man called from far back through a doorway to the side. “Sir! Thisway!”Sebastian paused to look at the man and his frantic hand signals, then pulledJennsen into a resplendent room. Across a floor covered with an elegant carpetof gold and rust-colored diamond designs, past windows hung with gorgeous greendraperies, a soldier stood at a doorway into another hall. There were coucheslike none Jennsen had ever seen, and tables and chairs with beautifully carvedlegs. While the room was elegant, it was not imposingly so, making it seem likea place where people might gather for casual conversations. She followedSebastian as he ran for the soldier at the door on the opposite side of theroom.“It’s her!” the man called to Sebastian. “Hurry! It’s her! I just saw her passby!”The hulking soldier, still trying to catch his breath, sword hanging in hisfist, peeked out the doorway again. Just before they reached him, as he peereddown the hall, Jennsen heard a dull thump. The soldier dropped his sword andclutched at his chest, his eyes going wide, his mouth opening. He fell dead attheir feet, no sign of any wound.Jennsen pushed Sebastian up against the wall before he could go through thedoorway. She didn’t want him encountering whatever had just dropped the soldier.Almost at the same time, from the way they had come, she heard the snapping hissof something otherworldly. Jennsen dropped to the floor, stretching out overSebastian, holding him against the edge of floor and wall, as if he were a childto be protected. She closed her eyes tight, crying out with fright at thethunderous blast behind her that shook the floor. A barrage of rubble shriekedthrough the room.When it finally went still and she opened her eyes, dust drifted through thedestruction. The wall around them was peppered with holes. Somehow, she andSebastian were not hurt. It only served to confirm what she already believed.“It was him!” Sebastian’s arm shot out from under her to point across the room.“It was him!”Jennsen turned but saw no one. “What?”Sebastian pointed again. “It was Lord Rahl. I saw him. As he ran past the doorhe cast in a spell of some kind-a pinch of sparkling dust-just as you pushed meagainst the wall. Then it exploded. I don’t know how we survived in a roomfilled with such flying debris.”“I guess it all missed us,” Jennsen said.The room had been turned inside out. The draperies were shredded, the wallsholed. The furniture that only moments before had been so beautiful was now awreck of splinters and ripped upholstery. The rumpled carpet was covered inwhite dust, pieces of plaster, and splintered wood.A hanging chunk of plaster broke away and crashed to the floor, raising yet moredust as Jennsen made her way through the wreckage of the room, toward the doorthey had come through, the door where Sebastian had pointed, the door where onlymoments before Lord Rahl had been. Sebastian retrieved his sword and quicklyfollowed her out.The hall, its woodwork so tastefully painted, was now smeared with blood. Thebody of another Sister lay crumpled not far away. When they reached her, theysaw her dead eyes staring up at the ceiling in surprise.“What in the name of Creation is going on?” Sebastian whispered to himself.Jennsen thought, by the look on the dead Sister’s face, that she must havewondered the same thing in the last instant of her life.A glance out the window showed a killing ground littered with thousands ofbodies.“You have to get the emperor out of here,” Jennsen said. “This isn’t the simplething it appeared.”“I’d say it was a trap of some kind. But we might still be able to carry out ourobjective. That would make it a success-make it worth it.”Whatever was happening was outside her experience and beyond her ability tocomprehend. Jennsen only knew that she intended to carry out her objective. Asthey raced down halls, chasing the sounds and following the trail of bodies,they worked their way deeper into the mysterious Confessors’ Palace, away fromany outside windows to where the air was hushed and gloomy. The deep shadows inthe halls and rooms, where little light penetrated, added a frightening newdimension to the terrifying events.Jennsen was well past shock, horror, or even fear. She felt as if she werewatching herself act. Even her own voice sounded remote to her. In some distantway, she marveled at the things she did, at her ability to carry on.As they cautiously rounded an intersection, they encountered a few dozensoldiers hunched in the shadows just inside a small room bloodied, but alive.Four Sisters were there, too. Jennsen spotted Emperor Jagang leaning against awall as he panted, his sword gripped tightly in a bloody fist. As she rushed up,he met her gaze, his black eyes filled not with the fear or sorrow she expectedbut with rage and determination.“We’re close, girl. Keep that knife out and you’ll get your chance.”Sebastian moved off to check other doorways, securing the immediate area,several men moving at his direction when he gave them silent hand signals.She could hardly believe what she was hearing, or seeing. “Emperor, you have toget out of here.”He frowned at her. “Are you out of your mind?”“We’re being cut to pieces! There are dead soldiers everywhere. I saw Sistersback there, ripped open by something-”“Magic,” he said with a wicked grin.She blinked at that grin. “Excellency, you have to get out of here before theyhave you, too.”His grin vanished, replaced by red-faced anger. “This is a war! What do youthink war is? War is killing. They’ve been doing it, and I intend to do it backtwice over! If you don’t have the guts to use that knife, then put your tailbetween your legs and run for the hills! But don’t ever ask me to help youagain.”Jennsen stood her ground. “I’ll not run. I’m here for a reason. I only wantedyou out of here so the Order would not lose you, too, after they’ve already lostBrother Narev.”He huffed in disgust. “Touching.” He turned to his men, checking that they werepaying attention. “Half take the room on the right, just ahead. The rest staywith me. I want them flushed out into the open.” He swept his sword before thefaces of the four Sisters. “Two with them, two with me. Don’t disappoint me,now.”With that, the men and Sisters split up and quickly moved off, half through theroom at the right, half charging after the emperor. Sebastian gestured urgentlyfor her. Jennsen joined him, running at his side, as they raced out into thesmoky hall after the emperor.“There he is!” she heard Jagang call from up ahead. “Here! This way! Here!”And then there was a thunderous blast so violent it took Jennsen’s feet fromunder her, sending her sprawling. The hall was suddenly filled with fire andfragments of every sort rebounding off the walls as it all came flying towardthem. Snatching her arm, Sebastian yanked her up and into a recessed doorwayjust in time to miss the bulk of the flying objects that came careening past.Men up the hall let out screams of mortal pain. Such unbridled wails sentshivers up Jennsen’s spine. Following Sebastian, Jennsen ran through thicksmoke, toward the screams. The dark, in addition to the smoke, made it difficultto see very far, but they soon encountered bodies. Beyond the dead, there werestill some men alive, but it was clear by the ghastly nature of their woundsthat they would not live long. The last moments of their lives were to be spentin horrifying agony. Jennsen and Sebastian scrambled past the dying, through thecarnage and rubble piled knee-deep from wall to wall, looking for EmperorJagang.There, among the splintered wood, leaning boards, overturned chairs and tables,glass shards, and fallen plaster, they spotted him. Jagang’s thigh was laid opento the bone. A Sister stood beside him, her back pressed to the wall. A huge,splintered oak board had been driven through her just below her breastbone,pinning her to the wall. She was still alive, but it was evident that there wasnothing to be done for her.“Dear Creator forgive me. Dear Creator forgive me,” she whispered over and overthrough quivering lips. Her eyes turned to watch them approach. “Please,” shewhispered, blood frothing from her nose, “please, help me.”She had been close to the emperor. She had probably shielded him with her gift,deflecting whatever power had been unleashed, and saved his life. Now she wasshivering in mortal agony.Sebastian lifted something from under his cloak, behind his back. With a mightyswing, he brought his axe around. The blade slammed into the wall withresounding thunk, and stuck. The Sister’s head tumbled down, bouncing throughthe dusty rubble.Sebastian yanked once, freeing his axe. As he replaced it in the hanger at thesmall of his back, he turned and came face-to-face with Jennsen. She could onlystare in horror into his icy blue eyes.“If it were you,” he said, “would you want me to let you endure such suffering?”Trembling uncontrollably, unable to answer him, Jennsen turned away and fell toher knees beside Emperor Jagang. She imagined he had to be in frightening pain,but he hardly seemed to notice the gaping wound, except that he knew his legwouldn’t work. He held the two sides of the wound closed as best he could withone hand, but he was still losing a lot of blood. With his other hand, he hadmanaged to drag himself to the side, where he leaned against the wall. Jennsenwas no healer, and didn’t really know what to do, but she did realize the urgentneed to do something to stop the gushing blood.His face streaked with sweat and soot, Jagang pointed with his sword down a sidehall. “Sebastian, it’s her! She was just right here. I almost had her. Don’t lether get away!”Another Sister, wearing a dusty brown wool dress, came clambering over therubble, stumbling toward them in the darkness, passing all the groaningsoldiers. “Excellency! I heard you! I’m here. I’m here. I can help.”Jagang nodded his acknowledgment, one hand resting on his heaving chest. “Sebastian--don’t let her get away. Move!”“Yes, Excellency.” Sebastian took note of the Sister climbing awkwardly over abroken side table, then pressed a hand to Jennsen’s shoulder. “Stay here withthem. She’ll protect you and the emperor. I’ll be back.”Jennsen snatched for his sleeve, but he had already dashed away, collecting allthe remaining men on his way past. He led them off down the hall, disappearinginto the darkness. Jennsen was suddenly alone with the wounded emperor, a Sisterof the Light, and the voice.She snatched up the end of a strip of a sheer curtain and pulled it out fromunder the rubble. “You’re losing a lot of blood. I need to close this as best Ican.” She looked up into Emperor Jagang’s nightmare eyes. “Can you help hold itclosed while I wrap it?”He grinned. Sweat coursed down his face, leaving streaks through the dustygrime. “It doesn’t hurt, girl. Do it. I’ve had worse than this. Be quick aboutit.”Jennsen started threading the filthy curtain under his leg, wrapping it aroundand under again as Jagang held the gaping wound closed as best he could. Thefine fabric almost immediately turned from white to red with all the thick bloodflowing across it. The sister put a hand to Jennsen’s shoulder as she knelt downto help. As Jennsen continued wrapping, the Sister laid her hands flat on eachside of the massive gash in the meat of his thigh.Jagang cried out in pain.“I’m sorry, Excellency,” the Sister said. “I have to stop the bleeding or you’llbleed to death.”“Do it, then, you stupid bitch! Don’t talk me to death!”The Sister nodded tearfully, clearly terrified by what she was doing, yetknowing she had no choice but to do it. She closed her eyes and once morepressed trembling hands to Jagang’s hairy, blood-soaked leg. Jennsen pulled backto give her room to work, watching in the dim light as the woman apparently wovemagic into the emperor’s wound.There was nothing to see, at first. Jagang gritted his teeth, grunting in painas the Sister’s magic began to do its work. Jennsen watched, spellbound, as thegift was actually being used to help someone, instead of cause suffering. Shewondered briefly if the Imperial Order believed that even this magic, used tosave the life of the emperor, was evil. In the murky light, Jennsen saw theblood pumping copiously from the wound abruptly slow to an oozing trickle.Jennsen leaned closer, frowning, trying to see in the shadows, as the Sister,now that the bleeding was nearly stopped, moved her hands, probably to start thework of closing the emperor’s terrible wound. Leaning close as she watched,Jennsen heard Jagang suddenly whisper.“There he is.” Jennsen looked up. He was staring off down the hall. “RichardRahl. Jennsen-there he is. It’s him.”Jennsen followed Emperor Jagang’s gaze, her knife gripped in her fist. It wasdark in the hallway, but there was smoky light down at the far end, silhouettingthe figure standing in the distance, watching them.He lifted his arms. Between his outstretched hands, fire sprang to life. Itwasn’t fire like real fire, like the fire in a hearth, but fire like that out ofa dream. It was there, but somehow not there; real, but at the same time unreal.Jennsen felt as if she were standing in a borderland between two worlds, theworld that existed, and the world of the fantastic.Yet, the lethal danger that the wavering flame represented was all too clear.Frozen in dread, squatted down beside Emperor Jagang, Jennsen could only stareas the figure at the end of the hall lifted his hands, lifted the slowly turningball of blue and yellow flame. Between those steady hands, the rotating flameexpanded, to look frighteningly purposeful. Jennsen knew that she was seeing themanifestation of deadly intent.And then he cast that implacable inferno out toward them.Jagang had said that it was Richard Rahl down at the end of the hall. She couldsee only a silhouetted figure casting out from his hands that awful fire. Oddlyenough, even though the flame illuminated the walls, it left its creator inshadow.The sphere of seething flame expanded as it flew toward them with ever-gatheringspeed. The liquid blue and yellow flame looked as if it burned with livingintent.Yet, it was, in some strange way, nothing, too.“Wizard’s fire!” the Sister shrieked as she sprang up. “Dear Creator! No!”The Sister ran down the dark hall, toward the approaching flame. With wildabandon, she threw her arms up, palms toward the approaching fire, as if shewere casting some magic shield to protect them, yet Jennsen could see nothing.The fire grew as it shot toward them, illuminating the walls, ceiling, anddebris as it wailed past. The Sister cast out her hands again.The fire struck the woman with a jarring thud, silhouetting her against a flareof intense yellow light so bright that Jennsen threw an arm up before her face.In a heartbeat, the flame enveloped the woman, smothering her scream, consumingher in a blinding instant. Blue heat wavered as the fire swirled a moment inmidair, then winked out, leaving behind only a wisp of smoke to hang in thehall, along with the smell of burnt flesh. Jennsen stared, thunderstruck by whatshe had just seen, by a life so cruelly snuffed out.Off down at the end of the hall, Lord Rahl again conjured a ball of the terriblewizard’s fire, nursing it between his hands, urging it to grow and expand. Againhe cast it outward from lifted arms.Jennsen didn’t know what to do. Her legs wouldn’t move. She knew she couldn’toutrun such a thing.The howling sphere of roiling flame tumbled down the hall, wailing toward them,expanding as it came, illuminating the walls it passed, until the burning deathspanned from wall to wall, from floor to ceiling, leaving no place to hide.Lord Rahl started away, leaving them to their fate, as death roared down onJennsen and Emperor Jagang."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49The sound was horrifying. The sight of it was paralyzing.This was a weapon conjured for no reason but to kill. This was deadly magic.Lord Rahl’s magic.This time, there was no Sister of the Light to intercept it.Magic. Lord Rahl’s magic. There, but not.In the last instant before it was on her, Jennsen knew what she had to do. Shethrew herself over Emperor Jagang. In that fraction of a second before the firewas upon her, she covered him with her body where he lay at the edge of thefloor against the wall, protecting him as she would a child.Even through her tightly closed eyes, she could see the brilliant light. Shecould hear the terrible wail of the tumbling flames howling around her.But Jennsen felt nothing.She heard it roaring past her, thundering off down the hall. She opened one eyeto peek out. At the end of the corridor, the orb of living fire exploded throughthe wall, coming apart in a shower of liquid flame, sending a hail of blazingwood out onto the lawn far below.With the wall gone, the hall was better lit. Jennsen pushed herself up.“Emperor-are you alive?” she whispered.“Thanks to you. He sounded stunned. “What did you do? How could you not-”“Hush,” she whispered urgently. “Stay down, or he’ll see you.”There was no time to waste. It had to be ended. Jennsen sprang up and ran downthe hall, knife in hand. She could now see the man standing there in the smokylight at the end of the hall. He had stopped and turned to stare back at her. Asshe raced toward him, she realized that it couldn’t be her half brother. Thiswas an old man, a collection of bones in dark maroon and black robes with silverbands at the cuff of the sleeves. Wavy white hair stuck out in disarray, but didnot diminish his air of authority.Yet he stared in shock at seeing her racing toward him, as if hardly believingit, hardly believing she had survived his wizard’s fire. She was a hole in theworld to him. She could see understanding flooding his hazel eyes.Despite his kindly look, this was a man who had just killed countless people.This was a man doing Lord Rahl’s bidding. This was a man who would kill morepeople unless stopped. He was a wizard, a monster. She had to stop him.Jennsen held her knife high. She was almost there. She heard herself screamingin rage, like the battle cries she had heard from the soldiers, as she plungedforward. She understood those battle cries, now. She wanted his blood.“No . . . “ the old man called to her. “Child, you don’t understand what you’redoing. We don’t have time-l don’t have a moment to spare! Stop! I can’t delay!Let me-”His words were no more to her than those of the voice. She ran through therubble littering the hall as fast as her legs would carry her, feeling the samesense of wild but deliberate fury she had in her house, when the men hadattacked her mother, and then her-that same fierce commitment.Jennsen knew what she had to do, and knew she was the one to do it.She was invincible.Before she reached him, he cast one hand out toward her, but lower than he hadbefore. This time, no fire erupted. She didn’t care if it did. She would not bestopped. She could not be stopped. She was invincible.Whatever he did caused the debris at her feet to suddenly shift, as if he’dgiven the whole lot of it a mighty shove. Before she could jump clear, one foottangled in the debris, breaking through the jumble of broken plaster and lath.Rumpled carpeting and wreckage of furniture ensnared her ankle. With a surprisedgasp, Jennsen pitched violently forward. Pieces of wood and plaster flipped dustand debris up in the air as she crashed to the floor. Her face hit hard,stunning her.Small chunks and scraps rained down on her back. Dust slowly rolled away. Herface stung with dizzyingly intense pain.Jennsen listened to the voice calling to her to get up, to keep moving. But hervision had narrowed down to a tiny spot, as if she were looking through a softfuzzy tube. The world looked dreamlike through that tunnel of sight. She laystill, breathing the settling dust until it coated her throat, unable even tocough.Groaning, Jennsen was at last able to push herself up. Her vision was rapidlyreturning. She began coughing, hacking, trying to clear her windpipe of thechoking dust. Her leg was jammed down among the tangle of debris. She wasfinally able to pry a board to the side, giving her room to pull her foot free.Fortunately, her boot had prevented the splintered wood from slicing her leg.Jennsen realized her hands were empty. Her knife was gone. On her hands andknees, she rummaged madly through the wreckage of wood, plaster, and tangledfabric of draperies, throwing things aside, searching for her knife. She thrusther arm under a nearby overturned table, groping blindly.With the tips of her fingers, she felt something smooth. She groped along ituntil she touched the ornately engraved letter “R.” Grunting with the effort,she shouldered the leg of the overturned table until the whole mess grated as itmoved a little. At last, she was able to reach in far enough to pull her knifefree.When Jennsen was finally able to scramble to her feet, the man was long gone.She went after him anyway. When she reached the intersection of passageways, aquick look revealed only empty halls. She ran down the corridor she thought hehad taken, looking in rooms, searching alcoves, making her way ever deeper intothe murky palace.She could hear people in the distance, soldiers, yelling for others to followthem. She listened for Sebastian’s voice, but didn’t hear him. She heard, too,the sound of magic being unleashed, like the crack of lightning, only indoors.It sometimes shook the entire palace. Sometimes, too, the screams of dying mencould be heard.Jennsen chased after the sounds, trying to find the man who had loosed thewizard’s fire, but found only more empty rooms and passageways.Some places were littered with dead soldiers. She couldn’t tell if they had beenthere from the first, or had been left in the wake of the fleeing wizard.Jennsen heard the sound of running soldiers, their boots rumbling throughcorridors. And then, she heard Sebastian’s voice call out, “That way! It’s her!”Jennsen raced for an intersection and turned down a hall running off in thedirection she had heard Sebastian’s voice. Her footfalls were muted by a longgreen carpet with gold fringe running the length of a grand corridor. It was allthe more startlingly beautiful after coming out of ruined areas. A windowoverhead lit the variegated brown-and-white marble columns that supported archesto each side, like silent sentinels watching her race by.The palace was a maze of corridors and exquisite chambers. Some of the roomsJennsen cut through were lavishly furnished in muted tones, while yet otherswere decorated with carpets, chairs, and draperies in a riot of colors. Shedimly noted that the grand sights were astoundingly beautiful as sheconcentrated on not getting lost. She imagined the place as a vast forest, andnoted landmarks along the way so as to find her way back. She had to help getEmperor Jagang to safety.Racing down the wide passageway lined with granite recesses in the walls to eachside, each holding a delicate object of one kind or another, Jennsen burstthrough double gold-bound doors into an enormous chamber. The sound of the doorsrebounding echoed back from the room beyond. The size of place, the splendor ofthe sight, caught her up short. Overhead, rich paintings of figures in robesswept across the inside of the huge dome. Below the majestic figures a ring ofround windows let in ample light. A semicircular dais sat off to the side, alongwith chairs behind an imposing carved desk. Arched openings around the roomcovered stairways up to curving balconies edged with sinuous, polished mahoganyrailings.Jennsen knew by the imposing architecture that this must be the place from wherethe Mother Confessor ruled the Midlands. All the seating up in the balconiesmust have provided visitors or dignitaries a view of the proceedings.Jennsen saw someone making their way among the columns on the other side of thechamber. Just then, Sebastian burst through another door not far to Jennsen’sright. A company of soldiers funneled through the doors after him.Sebastian lifted his sword, pointing. “There she is!” He was nearly out ofbreath. Rage flashed in his blue eyes.“Sebastian!” Jennsen ran to his side. “We have to get out of here. We need toget the emperor to safety. A wizard came and the Sister was killed. He’s alone.Hurry.”The men were fanning out, a jangling dark mass clad in chain mail and armor andgleaming weapons spreading around the edge of the vast chamber like wolvesstalking a fawn.Sebastian heatedly pointed his sword across the room. “Not until I have her.Jagang will at last have the Mother Confessor.”Jennsen peered off to where he pointed and saw, then, the tall woman across theroom. She wore simple, coarsely woven flaxen robes decorated at the neck with abit of red and yellow. Her black and gray hair was parted in the middle and cutsquare with her strong jaw.“The Mother Confessor,” Sebastian whispered, transfixed by the sight of her.Jennsen frowned back at him. “Mother Confessor . . . ‘ Jennsen couldn’t envisionthe Lord Rahl wedding a woman as old as his great-grandmother. “Sebastian, whatdo you see?”He flashed a smug look. “The Mother Confessor.”“What does she look like? What’s she wearing?”“She’s wearing that white dress of hers.” His heated expression was back. “Howcan you miss her?”“She’s a beautiful bitch,” a soldier on the other side of Sebastian said with agrin, unable to take his eyes from the woman across the room. “But the emperorwill be the one to have her.”The rest of the men, too, started across the room with that same disturbing,lecherous look. Jennsen seized Sebastian by the arm and yanked him around.“No!” she whispered harshly. “Sebastian, it’s not her.”“Are you out of your mind?” he asked as he glared at her. “Do you think I don’tknow what the Mother Confessor looks like?”“I’ve seen her before,” the soldier beside him said. “That’s her all right.”“No, it’s not,” Jennsen whispered insistently, all the while tugging atSebastian’s arm, trying to get him to pull back. “It must be a spell orsomething. Sebastian, it’s an old woman. This whole thing is going terriblywrong. We have to get out-”The soldier on the other side of Sebastian grunted. His sword clattered to themarble floor as he clutched his chest. He toppled, like a tree that had beenfelled, and crashed to the floor. Another soldier, then another, then anotherfell. Thump, thump, thump they hit the floor. Jennsen put herself in front ofSebastian, throwing her arms around him to protect him.The room exploded with a blinding flash of lightning. The sizzling arc twistedthrough the air, yet it unfailingly found its mark, raking down the line of menrunning out around the edge of the room, cutting them down in an instant.Jennsen looked over her shoulder and saw the old woman cast a hand out to theother side, toward men, and a Sister, charging across the room straight towardher. The soldiers, struck down by an invisible power, dropped in their tracks,one at a time. Their heavy crumpled bodies slid across the slick floor a shortdistance when they collapsed in midstride.The Sister cast out her hands, Jennsen assumed to protect herself with magic ofsome kind, although she could see nothing of it. But when the Sister againthrust out an arm, Jennsen not only saw but could hear light forming at the tipsof her fingers.With all the soldiers down-all but Sebastian dead-the old sorceress turned herfull attention on the attacking Sister. With weathered hands, the old womanwarded the attack, sending the thrumming light back on the Sister.“You know you have but to swear allegiance, Sister,” the old woman said in araspy voice, “and you will be free of the dream walker.”Jennsen didn’t understand, but the Sister surely did. “It won’t work! I’ll notrisk such agony! May the Creator forgive me, but it will be easier for us all ifI kill you.”“If that be your choice,” the old woman rasped, “then so be it.”The younger woman started to cast her magic again, but fell to the floor with asudden cry. She clawed at the smooth marble, trying to whisper prayers betweengrunts of terrible agony. She left a smear of blood on the marble, but beforegetting far, she stilled. Her head sank to the floor as she expelled one longlast rattling breath.Knife in hand, Jennsen ran for the murderous old woman. Sebastian followed, buthad taken only a few steps when the woman wheeled and cast a shimmering light athim just as Jennsen stepped into her line of sight. Only that prevented thestreak of glimmering light from hitting him square. The light glanced off hisside in a shower of sparks. Sebastian fell with a cry.“No! Sebastian!” Jennsen started for him. He pressed his hands to the side ofhis ribs, clearly in pain. If hurt, at least he was alive.Jennsen swung back to the old woman. She stood immobile, her head cocked,listening. There was confusion in her manner, and a curious kind of awkwardhelplessness.The sorceress wasn’t looking at her, but instead had an ear turned to her. Beinga little closer, now, Jennsen noticed for the first time that the old woman hadcompletely white eyes. Jennsen stared, at first from surprise, and then withsudden recognition.“Adie?” she breathed, not having intended to say it aloud.Startled, the woman cocked her head the other way, listening with her other ear.“Who be there?” the raspy voice demanded. “Who be there?”Jennsen didn’t answer, for fear of giving away her exact location. The room hadgone silent. Worry wore heavily on the old sorceress’s weathered face. Butdetermination, too, set her jaw as her hand lifted.Jennsen gripped her knife in her fist, not knowing what to do. If this reallywas Adie, the woman Althea had told her about, then, according to Althea, shewould be completely blind to Jennsen. But she was not blind to Sebastian.Jennsen crept a step closer.The old woman’s head turned to the sound. “Child? Do you be a sister of Richard?Why would you be with the Order?”“Maybe because I want to live!”“No.” The woman shook her head with stem disapproval. “No. If you be with theOrder, then you have chosen death, not life.”“You’re the only one intent on bringing death!”“That be a lie. All of you came to me with weapons and murderous intent,” shesaid. “I did not come to you.”“Of course! Because you defile the world with your taint of magic!” Sebastiancalled from behind. “You would smother mankind-enslave us all-with your wickedancient ways!”“Ah,” Adie said, nodding to herself. “It be you, then, who has deluded thischild.”“He’s saved my life! Without Sebastian I would be nothing! I would have nothing!I would be dead! Just like my mother!”“Child,” Adie said in a quiet rasp, “that, too, be a lie. Come away from them.Come with me.”“You’d love that, wouldn’t you!” Jennsen shrieked. “My mother died in my armsbecause of your Lord Rahl. I know the truth. The truth is that you’d love todeliver the prize plum to Lord Rahl, at last.”Adie shook her head. “Child, I don’t know what lies be filling your head, but Ido not have the time for this. You must come away with me, or I cannot help you.I cannot wait a moment longer. Time be in short supply and I have used all Ihave.”As the woman spoke, Jennsen used the opportunity to take small quiet stepsforward. She had to take this chance to end the threat. She knew she could takethis woman out. If it was only a matter of muscle and skill with a knife, thenJennsen would have the distinct advantage. A sorceress’s magic was uselessagainst someone who was invincible-against a pillar of Creation.“Jenn, take her! You can do it! Avenge your mother!”Jennsen was still only a quarter of the distance from Sebastian to Adie. Knifeheld tight, she took another step.“If that be your choice,” Adie rasped at hearing the whisper of the footstep,“then so be it.”When the sorceress lifted her hand out toward Sebastian, Jennsen realized withhorror what she meant: the price of her choice was that Sebastian would beforfeit."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50Sebastian was on the floor, not far away, leaning to the side, propping himselfup on one arm. Jennsen saw blood on the marble floor under him. Since Adiecouldn’t stop Jennsen, she intended to finish him as the price. The appallingreality of seeing Sebastian in pain, of knowing he was about to be murdered,shook Jennsen to her very soul.Sebastian was all she had.The sorceress was but a blink away from loosing lethal magic on him. Jennsen wasa great deal closer to Sebastian than to the sorceress. Jennsen knew she wouldnever reach the sorceress in time to stop her, but she might make it toSebastian in time to protect him. She could only kill the sorceress if she werewilling to forfeit Sebastian to do it. That was the choice Adie had given her.Jennsen abandoned her attack and instead dove for Sebastian, putting herself inthe woman’s line of sight, making a hole in the world where she was trying toaim her terrible conjured fire. The magic the sorceress loosed missed Sebastian,raking crackling lightning across the polished marble floor, ripping it up in aline right beside him. The air was filled with a burst of flying stone shards.Jennsen scooped Sebastian protectively into her arms as she fell to his side.“Sebastian! Can you move? Can you run? We have to get out of here.He nodded. “Help me up.” His voice was labored, his breathing shallow.Jennsen ducked her head under his arm and strained with the effort of liftinghim to his feet. With her help, they hurriedly worked their way toward the door.Behind, Adie lifted her hands again, her white eyes tracking Sebastian’smovements, if not Jennsen’s. Jennsen twisted sideways, putting herself in theway. A blast of lightning laced past, missing them by inches, blowing the heavymetal-clad door off its hinges. The door went skittering down the hall.Jennsen and Sebastian scuttled through the smoking opening and hastened down thewide hall. Jennsen realized, as she watched the heavy doors crashing down thehall, bouncing off walls, tearing out great chunks of stone, that if somethinglike that hit her, she would be crushed. She noticed, too, that her arm wasbleeding from small cuts from the stone shards that had struck her. It wasn’tmagic that had done it, but sharp stone, even if the sharp stone had been sentflying by magic.She might be in some ways invincible, but if magic toppled a massive stonecolumn on her, she would be just as dead as if it had been pushed over by brutestrength instead. Dead was dead.Jennsen suddenly didn’t feel so invincible.At the first intersection, she took them to the right, getting Sebastian out ofthe line of sight of Adie’s gift, and her weapons of magic, as quickly aspossible. Jennsen could feel his warm blood running over the arm she had aroundhim. Despite his injury, Sebastian didn’t ask her to slow to spare him any pain.Together, they rushed through halls and rooms as fast as he was able, crossingthe palace, going back toward where Jennsen had left the emperor.“Are you hurt bad?” she asked, fearing the answer.“Not sure,” he said, nearly out of breath and clearly in pain. “Feels likethere’s a fire burning in my ribs. If you wouldn’t have prevented her fromhitting me square on, I’d be dead for sure.”As they moved through the palace, they came across a squad of their men. Jennsencollapsed next to them, panting, exhausted, unable to hold Sebastian up anotherstep. Her leg muscles trembled from the exertion.“We’re leaving,” Sebastian told the men, his breathing labored with pain. “Wehave to get out. The emperor is hurt. We have to get him out of here.” Hemotioned in different directions. “Some of you go each way. Collect all our men.We need to get everyone we can to protect the emperor and then we have to gethim back to safety. You two, you’ll have to help me.”The bulk of the men immediately rushed off to their tasks. The two remainingbehind threw Sebastian’s arms over their shoulders and easily lifted him. Hewinced in pain. Jennsen led them through the palace, watching for the landmarksshe remembered, desperate to reach Emperor Jagang and to get out of the deathtrap of a palace.The Confessors’ Palace was a confusion of halls, passageways, and rooms. Some ofthe rooms were huge, but when they came to such places, they went around,staying to the maze of passageways; Sebastian said they didn’t want to be caughtin one of those big rooms where they would be an easier target. Intermittently,Jennsen heard the awful thump of magic. Each time, the entire palace shudderedwith the concussion.“This way,” she said, recognizing the yawning breach in the wall at the cornerof a passageway strewn with rubble. That gaping hole through the outer wall,looking out to daylight and overlooking the lawns far below, was where thewizard’s fire, meant for her and Emperor Jagang, had blasted through.Five soldiers made their way down the hall from the other direction, climbingover the tangled debris, bringing a Sister of the Light with them. From behind,nearly a dozen more men appeared. Two Sisters, their faces streaked with soot,came through a nearby room to the side, followed by yet more of the assaultforce. Half the men were bleeding, but all of them were able to move under theirown power.Emperor Jagang was sitting up against the wall where Jennsen had left him. Thedeep jagged gash was partly being held together by the curtain Jennsen hadwrapped around his leg, but the meat of his muscle wasn’t aligned properly andthe terrible wound clearly needed attention. It appeared that the healing magicperformed by the Sister, just before she had been killed, still held, and atleast the emperor wasn’t still losing blood the way he had been.The blood the emperor had lost left him weak-looking and pale, but not as paleas the faces of those who for the first time saw the seriousness of his injury.One of the Sisters knelt down to check his wound. Jagang winced when she triedto better align the two halves of his split leg.“There’s no time to heal it now,” she said. “We’ll need to get him to safety,first.”She immediately set to tightening the bandage of blood-soaked curtain thatJennsen had started to apply. She snatched up more cloth from the rubble.“Did you get her?” Jagang asked as the Sister worked at pulling the injuryclosed with the filthy strip of cloth. “Where is she? Sebastian!” He used aboard to lever himself upright, peering this way and that around the company ofsoldiers as they helped Sebastian make his way through to the emperor. “Thereyou are. Where’s the Mother Confessor? Did you get her?”“It isn’t her,” Jennsen answered in his place.“What?” The emperor glanced around angrily at the people watching him. “I sawthe bitch. I know the Mother Confessor when I see her! Why didn’t you get her!”“You saw a wizard and a sorceress,” Jennsen told him. “They were using magic tomake you think you were seeing Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor. It was atrick.”“I think she’s right,” Sebastian put in before Jagang could scream at her. “Iwas standing right beside her and while I saw the Mother Confessor, Jennsendidn’t.”Jagang turned a dark scowl on her. “But if the others saw her, how could you not. . .”Understanding seemed to come over him. For some reason that Jennsen couldn’texactly fathom, he suddenly recognized the truth in her words.“But why?” the Sister tending the emperor’s injury asked, looking up from herwork of bandaging the wound.“Both the wizard and the sorceress seemed to be in a hurry,” Jennsen said. “Theymust be up to something.”“It’s a diversion,” Jagang whispered, staring off down the empty hall litteredwith rubble. “They wanted to keep us occupied. Keep us away, and busy thinkingabout something else.”“Keep us away from what?” Jennsen asked.“The main force,” Sebastian said, catching Jagang’s line of thought.Another Sister, casting surreptitious glances to the other Sisters afterinspecting Sebastian’s wound, worked quickly at pressing a padded bandageagainst his ribs and then wrapping a long strip of cloth around his chest tohold it in place.“This will only help for a short time,” she muttered, half to herself. “This isnot good.” She glanced again to the other Sister. “We’re going to need to tendto this. We can’t do it here.”Sebastian winced in pain, ignoring her, then spoke. “It’s a trick. They keep ushere, puzzling over where they could be, kept us chasing after illusions, whilethey attack our main force.”Jagang growled a curse. He looked off out the hole the wizard’s fire had blastedin the wall, peering out toward the army they had left a long ride back down theriver valley. He clenched his fist and gritted his teeth.“That bitch! They wanted us busy so our main force would be sitting in placewhile they attack. That filthy scheming bitch! We have to get back!”The small force moved quickly through the halls. Jagang was carried with a manunder each arm, as was Sebastian, so that they could make quick progress backout of the Confessors’ Palace. Sebastian was looking worse.Along the way, they gathered up more of their men. Jennsen was astounded thatthere were still any others alive. Compared with the force they had come inwith, though, they had been cut to pieces. Had they all stayed together, ratherthan the way the emperor and Sebastian continually divided them up, they mighthave all been killed at once. As it was, the Order would still have to leavebehind a great many dead.Once on the lower level, they worked their way along service halls, toward theside of the palace, Sebastian advising that it would be best not to go out bythe main entrance, where they had entered, for fear that such a move might beexpected and they very well could be struck down before they could get away.Everyone moved as silently as possible through the empty kitchens, emerging to agray day in a side courtyard. It was secluded, with a wall screening it off fromthe city.The sight as they came around the side of the palace was horrifying. It lookedlike the entire force had been cut down, that none of the cavalry could possiblystill be alive. Jennsen couldn’t stand the sight of so much carnage, yet it wasso overwhelming that she could not look away. The dead, horses as well as men,lay tangled in a ragged line down the hillside, fallen in the place where theymet the foe head-on at a full charge. In the distance, near the trees, a fewscattered horses, their riders no doubt dead, nibbled at the grass.“There are no enemy dead,” Jagang said, surveying the sight as he limped alongwith the aid of a pike a soldier had handed him. “What could have done this?”“Nothing living,” a Sister said.As they moved quickly down the hill, making their way past the silent battleline, not far in front of the heaps of corpses, others of the cavalry, far downthe slope on the other side of a wall in an area among small garden buildingsand trees, spotted the emperor and raced out to protect him. Soldiers onhorseback-numbering less than a thousand out of the over forty thousand theystarted with-swept in to surround the company returning from the palace. Anumber of the Sisters rode in, pulling in close to the emperor to provide aninner circle of defense.Rusty, trailed by Pete, trotted across the lawns, accompanying the tatteredremnants of the cavalry. When Jennsen whistled, Rusty recognized the call andrushed in to be close to her. The mare, nuzzling Jennsen’s shoulder, voiced aplaintive whinny, eager for comfort. Rusty and Pete weren’t cavalry horses,trained to be accustomed to the terrors of war. Jennsen ran a soothing hand overthe horse’s trembling neck and rubbed her ears. She gave similar comfort to Petewhen he pressed his forehead against the back of her shoulder.“What happened!” Jagang called out in a rage. “How could you let yourselves betaken like this?”The officer leading the men on horseback looked around in dismay. “Excellency,it was ... out of the clear air. It wasn’t anything we could fight. ““Are you trying to tell me it was ghosts!” Jagang bellowed.“I think it was the horses the scout smelled,” another officer said. His arm wasbandaged up high but soaked in blood.“I want to know what’s going on,” Jagang said as he glared around at the faceswatching him. “How could this have happened?”As men brought extra horses, Sister Perdita dismounted close by. “Excellency, itwas some kind of attack involving magic-phantom horsemen invoked by wizardry isthe only explanation I have.”His menacing eyes were leveled at her in a way that made even Jennsen quail.“Then why didn’t you and your Sisters stop it?”“It wasn’t anything like the conjured magic we ordinarily encounter. I believeit had to be a form of constructed magic, or we would have not only detected it,but been able to stop it. At least, that’s what I assume. I’ve never actuallyseen any constructed magic, but I’ve heard of it. Whatever this was thatattacked us would not respond to anything we tried.”The emperor was still frowning darkly at her. “Magic is magic. You should havestopped it. That’s what you were here for.”“Constructed magic is different than conjured, Excellency.”“Different? How?”“Rather than using the gift on the spot, constructed magic has already been madeup in advance. It can be preserved for a great period of time ,thousands ofyears, maybe even forever. When it’s needed, the spell is triggered and themagic is loosed.”“Triggered by what?” Sebastian asked.Sister Perdita shook her head in frustration. “By just about anything, as I’veheard it told. It just depends on how it was constructed. No wizard now is ableto construct such a spell. We know little about those ancient wizards or whatthey could do, but from what little we do know, a constructed spell could besomething kept dry that comes to life when you get it wet-for example somethingto help fertilize crops when the spring rains come. It could be triggered byheating, like a cure taken for a fever the cure carries a construction in andthe fever triggers it. Others are triggered by a little magic, some by anelaborate application of incredibly intricate wizardry and great power.”“So,” Jennsen reasoned, “someone with magic must have unleashed something sopowerful as these phantom horsemen? A wizard, or a sorceress, or something?”Sister Perdita shook her head. “It could be that kind of constructed magic, butit could just as easily be a spell-albeit an incredibly powerful one-kept in athimble, and triggered by exposing the construction to ... anything-horse dung,even.”Emperor Jagang waved off the very notion. “But something that small and easilytriggered wouldn’t be this powerful.”“Excellency,” the Sister said, “in this, you can’t equate the apparent materialsize of the construction or its trigger with the result-they have no relationalvalue, at least not in the terms in which most people think. The trigger has nobearing on the power of the construction. Even the construction and its triggerare not necessarily relational. There is simply no rule by which to judge aconstruction.”The emperor swept an arm out before the tens of thousands of men and horsestangled in death. “But, surely, something of this magnitude had to have beensomething more.”“The army of phantom horsemen who carried out this attack might have beentriggered by a wizard drawing spells in magic dust while speaking an incrediblycomplex invocation, or it could just as easily have been a book containing acavalry counter that is simply opened to the proper page and held out before theattacking force-even from miles away. Even the simple fear of a person holdingout such a construction could be the trigger.”“You mean, anyone might accidentally trigger one, then?” Jennsen asked.“Of course. That’s what makes them so dangerous. But from what I’ve read, thatkind is exceedingly rare. Because they can be so dangerous, most are layered incomplex precautions and fail-safe mechanisms involving the most profoundknowledge of the application of magic.”“But,” Jennsen asked, “once a person-a wizard-with that advanced knowledgeremoves those layers of precautions and fail-safe mechanisms, then they might beset off by one final, simple trigger?”Sister Perdita gave Jennsen a meaningful look. “Exactly.”“So,” Jagang said, gesturing around at the thousands of bodies, “this force ofphantom cavalry might be sent out again at any moment to finish us off.”The Sister shook her head. “As I understand it, a constructed spell is usuallygood only once. It’s used up by doing what it was constructed to do. That’s onereason they’re rare; once used, they’re gone forever, and there are no longerany wizards alive who can make more.”“Why haven’t we encountered such constructed spells before?” Sebastian askedwith growing impatience. “And why now, all of a sudden?”Sister Perdita stared at him for a moment, a picture of bottled anger thatJennsen knew she would never have dared direct at the emperor, even though theattack on the Confessors’ Palace, which he ordered, against her warning, hadresulted in the deaths of many of her Sisters of the Light.With a show of deliberate care, Sister Perdita pointed up at the dark Keep hardagainst the mountain above them. “There are a thousand rooms in the Wizard’sKeep if there’s one,” she said in a low voice. “A good many of them will bestuffed full of nasty things. It’s likely that when we drove them here for thewinter, that wizard of theirs-Wizard Zorander finally had the good long time heneeded to search through the Keep, looking for just the kinds of things hehitherto lacked, so as to be ready for us when spring arrived and we advancedtoward Aydindril. I fear to think what catastrophic surprises he yet has instore for us. That Keep has stood invincible for thousands of years.”Sebastian’s glare turned as dark as Jagang’s “Why haven’t you warned us aboutthis? I never heard you say anything.”“I did. You were gone.”“You’ve also advised against many other things, as well, and we’ve overcomethem,” Jagang growled at her. “When you fight a war, you must expect to takerisks and to take casualties. Only those who dare, win.”Sebastian gestured up at the Keep. “What other things might we expect?”“Constructed spells are only one of the dangers in fighting these people. Noneof us Sisters really considered constructed spells a great threat becausethey’re so rare, but, as you can see, even one constructed spell is profoundlyperilous. Who knows what even more deadly things might be waiting to beunleashed.“What’s more, there’s a whole world of dangers we can’t even begin to conceiveof. Their winter weather, alone, has killed hundreds of thousands of our menwithout the enemy having to lift a finger or risk a single man. That, alone, hasdone more damage to us than almost any battle or calamity of magic. Did weexpect such losses from something so simple as snow and cold weather? Did oursize and strength protect us from it? Are those hundreds of thousands any lessof a loss because they died of fever rather than some fancy application ofmagic? What difference does it make to the dead--or those left to fight?“I admit, to a soldier, winning because your enemy falls ill might not seem veryglamorous or heroic, but dead is dead. Our army outnumbers these people manytimes over, yet we lost those hundreds of thousands to fever because of simpleweather-not the magic you are so worried about us protecting you from.”“But in a real fight,” Sebastian scoffed, “then our numbers really meansomething and will win out.”“Tell that to those who died of fever. Numbers don’t always determine thewinner.”“That’s outlandish,” Sebastian shot back.Sister Perdita pointed at the line of dead. “Tell it to them.”“We must take risks if we’re to win,” Jagang said, settling the matter. “What Iwant to know is if the enemy can be expected to throw more of these constructedspells at us?”Sister Perdita shook her head, as if to say she had no idea. “I doubt thatWizard Zorander knows much about the constructed spells kept there. Such magicis no longer understood well.”“He apparently understood one of them pretty well,” Sebastian said.“And, that might have been the only one he understood well enough to use. As Isaid before, once used, constructed spells are used up.”“But it’s also possible,” Jennsen interrupted, “that there are more constructedspells he does understand.”“Yes. Or, for all anyone knows, this could have been the last constructed spellin existence. On the other hand, he might be sitting in there with a hundred ofthem in his lap, all much worse than this one. There is simply no way to know.”Jagang’s black eyes gazed out at his fallen cavalry elite. “Well, he certainlyused this one to cut-”There was a sudden blinding flash off at the horizon.The world around them lit with the intensity of a flash of lightning, but theflash didn’t die out as lightning did. Jennsen seized the reins just under Rustyand Pete’s bits to keep them from bolting. Other horses spooked, rearing up.White-hot light flared up from the river valley down over the hills-in thedirection of the army. The light was so white, so pure, so hot, that it lit theclouds from underneath all the way to the opposite horizon. It was a light ofsuch power, such intensity, that many of the men dropped to a knee in alarm.The incandescent glow expanded outward with incredible speed, dwarfing thehills, yet it was so distant that they heard nothing. The rocky slopes of themountains ringing the city were all illuminated in the harsh glare.And then Jennsen heard at last a deep rumbling boom that vibrated in her chest.It shook the ground beneath their feet. The powerful, resonant boom stretchedout into a growing, clacking roar.A dark dome expanded up through the light. Jennsen realized that, because of thedistance, what looked to her like a spreading dome of dust had to be debris atleast as big as trees. Or wagons.As the dark cloud expanded upward through the light, it dissipated, as ifevaporating in the might of that consuming heat and light. Jennsen could see awave, like the rings made by tossing a rock in a pond, radiating outward, exceptthis was a single wave racing across the ground.As everyone stood transfixed, gripped in fright, a sudden wall of wind, drivingdirt and sand before it, blasted up the hill toward them. It was the shock ofthe wave that had finally reached them. It was so abrupt and so powerful that ifthe branches were not already bare, they would have been stripped of leavesright then and there. Limbs snapped as trees shuddered under the concussion ofwind.More horses panicked, bucking and bolting. Men dropped to the ground to protectthemselves from what might come next. Jennsen, staggered by the blast of wind,shielded her eyes with a hand while huge soldiers recited prayers learned inchildhood, begging the Creator for salvation.Jagang stood facing the sight with angry defiant challenge.“Dear spirits,” Jennsen finally said, squinting, blinking the dust from her eyesas the aftermath seemed to abate. “What could that have possibly been?”Sister Perdita had gone ashen. “A light web.” Her voice was low and heavy withwhat Jennsen had never detected from her before: dread.“Impossible!” Emperor Jagang roared. “There are Sisters down there warding forlight spells!”Sister Perdita said nothing. She couldn’t seem to take her gaze from thearresting sight.Jennsen could tell that the pain was wearing heavily on Sebastian, but he spokeforcefully. “I’ve been told that a light web can’t do any more damage than”-hegestured back at the palace- “perhaps to destroy a building. “Sister Perdita said nothing, and with that silence offered the evidence to thecontrary that was clearly before his eyes.Jennsen took the reins to both horses in one hand and put the other toSebastian’s back in sympathy. She ached for him and wanted him to be somewheresafe where his injury could be tended to. The Sisters had said that it wasserious and needed their attention. Jennsen suspected that the wound he sufferedat the hands of the sorceress needed the intervention of magic.“How can it be a light web!” Jagang demanded. “There’s not even anyone here! Notroops, no army, no force--except maybe a couple of their gifted.”“That’s all it would take,” Sister Perdita said. “Such a thing needs nosupporting troops. I told you that something was wrong. With the Keep here, inAydindril, there’s no telling what even a lone wizard might be able to do tohold off an army--even our army.”“You mean,” Sebastian asked, “it’s like the way a small force in a high pass,for example, can hold off a whole army?”“That’s right.”Jagang looked incredulous. “You mean to say that you think that even that oneskinny old wizard, in a place like the Keep, might be able to do all that?”Sister Perdita’s gaze shifted to the emperor. “That one skinny old wizard, asyou call him, has just managed to do the impossible. He has not only found whatwas probably a light web constructed thousands of years ago, but, even moreinconceivable, he somehow managed to ignite it.”Jagang turned to stare off to where the light was finally dying. “Dear Creator,”he whispered, “that’s right where the army is.” He wiped a hand back across hisshaved head as he considered the frightening implications. “How could theyignite a light web among our army? We’re warded for that! How!”Sister Perdita’s eyes turned toward the ground. “There is no way for us to tell,Excellency. It could be something as simple as a box containing an ancient lightweb from which he removed all the fail-safes and then left it for us to comeacross. As our men set up camp, maybe a man found it, wondered what was in theinnocent-looking little box, opened it, and the light of day was the finaltrigger. It could be something else entirely else that we could never begin todream up or imagine, much less forestall. We’ll never know. Whoever triggered itis now part of that cloud of smoke hanging over the river valley.”“Excellency,” Sebastian said, “I urgently advise that we get the army out ofhere-move them back.” He paused to wince in pain. “If they’re able to unleashsuch a defense-with all the gifted and their protection we have-then taking theKeep might be impossible.”“But we must!” Jagang roared.Sebastian sagged forward, waiting for a stitch of pain to pass. “Excellency, ifwe lose the army, then Lord Rahl will triumph. It’s as simple as that. Aydindrilis not worth the risk it has proven itself to be.” This was not so much theSebastian Jennsen knew, as it was Sebastian, the Order’s strategist, speaking.“Better for us to withdraw and fight another day on our terms, not theirs. Timeis our ally, not theirs.”In silent fury, the emperor stared off toward his imperiled army as heconsidered Sebastian’s advice. There was no telling how many men had just died.“This is Lord Rahl’s doing,” Jagang finally whispered. “He has to be killed. Inthe Creator’s name, he must be killed.”Jennsen knew that she was the only one who could accomplish such a thing."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 51Jennsen paced in the dimly lit tent, her footsteps silent across the emperor’sopulent carpets. A Sister stood vigil near the outer entry, making sure that noone could come into the tent to disturb the emperor, or, more important, to harmhim. Outside, a massive contingent of guards, including more Sisters, patrolledthe area. Occasionally, the Sister over by the outer entry glanced at Jennsen asshe paced.Pacing was all she could do. Her insides were a painful knot of worry overSebastian. He had lost consciousness on the long ride back to the encampment.Sister Perdita said that he was in danger of losing his life. Jennsen couldn’tbear the thought of losing him. He was all she had.Emperor Jagang was also in grave condition after having lost so much blood andthen having to endure the long hard ride back with the tattered remnants of theelite cavalry, but he’d refused to delay his return for any reason, even his ownwell-being. He never thought of himself, only of getting back to his army. Bothmen were at last now secure in the confines of the emperor’s tents, beingattended to by Sisters of the Light. Jennsen had wanted to stay with Sebastian,but the Sisters chased her out.The emperor had been made worse by the sight of the army. He’d been fit to killanyone who gave him an excuse. Jennsen could understand his rage of emotion.The light web had ignited close to the center of the encampment, Even this manyhours after the event, the place was still mass confusion.Many units had scattered, preparing for the possibility of an imminent attack.Others, it was suspected, had simply run for the hills. In the area where thelight web had ignited there was nothing but a vast depression of blackenedground. In the ensuing chaos, no one had been able to determine how many men hadbeen killed. It was next to impossible, with so many either killed or scattered,to get an accurate count of units, much less individuals, but there was noargument that the devastation was staggering.Jennsen had overheard whispers of over half a million men turned to dust in aninstant, and maybe as many as twice that number. In the end, the number killedmight prove to be much higher; there were inestimable numbers of seriouslyinjured soldiers-men burned or blinded, men severely cut or with limbs taken offby flying debris, men partially crushed by heavy wagons and equipment topplingon them, men made deaf, men so insensate, so stupefied, that they could onlystare unblinking at nothing. There were not enough army surgeons or Sisters ofthe Light to even begin to attend to the tiniest fraction of the wounded. Withevery hour that passed, thousands of those who survived the initial blast diedof their injuries.As staggering a blow as it was, it was not fatal to the great beast of theImperial Order army. The encampment was immense, and precisely because it was sovast, much of it had survived. According to the emperor, it was only a matter oftime before they replaced the dead with fresh troops, and then he would unleashhis men to seek vengeance on the people of the New World.Jennsen was beginning to understand why Sebastian had always been so adamantthat all magic must eventually be eliminated. There was no good that she couldthink of that could offset such wickedness. She hoped magic could at least sparehis life.Despite Emperor Jagang’s conviction that their forces would soon recover, therewere difficult times ahead for them. Much of the food had been destroyed, alongwith vast amounts of equipment and weapons. Every tent in the entire encampmenthad been at least knocked down. It was a cold night and many men would beexposed to the elements. Fortunately, even though the emperor’s tent had beenflattened, men had been able to erect it again for the injured emperor andSebastian.Jennsen paced, burning, not only with worry, but with rage. She doubted that agreater monster than Richard Rahl had ever lived. Surely, no single man had everbeen the cause of so much suffering in the world. It was inconceivable to herthat anyone could have such a lust for power that they would lead a cause thatcould murder so many people. She didn’t see how Richard Rahl could be a part ofCreation; surely, he was the Keeper’s disciple.Tears ran down Jennsen’s cheeks at her gnawing apprehension. She prayedfervently to the good spirits that Sebastian would not die, that the Sisterscould heal him.In agonizing worry, she halted in her pacing and leaned on a table she had notseen the last time she had been in the tent. When the tent had fallen, it hadbeen hastily erected, and this table, probably from the emperor’s privatequarters, apparently hadn’t been replaced in its proper location. There was asmall bookcase at the rear of the top.Looking for something that might divert her mind from the ache of anxiety whileshe waited for word of Sebastian, Jennsen idly scanned the old books. She didn’tunderstand the words on any of them. For some reason, though, one in particulardrew her attention-something about the rhythm of the foreign words. She pulledthe book out and turned it toward the candlelight, trying to read the title. Sheran her fingertips over the four gilded words on the cover. They made no senseto her, yet they seemed somehow almost familiar.Jennsen gasped in surprise when the Sister, who had been over by the door,lifted the book from her hands. “These belong to Emperor Jagang. Besides beingvery old and very fragile, they are quite valuable. His Excellency doesn’t likeanyone to touch his books.”Jennsen watched the woman inspect the book for any damage. “I’m sorry. I meantno harm.”“You are a very special guest, and we have been instructed to accord you everyprivilege, but these are His Excellency’s most prized works. He is a man ofgreat learning. He collects books. As a guest, I think you should respect hiswishes that no one but he touch them.”“Of course. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.” Jennsen chewed her lower lip as shelooked back at the curtain drawn across the doorway to the back, where Sebastianwas being seen to. She wished there would be some word. She turned back to theSister. “I was only puzzled because I’ve never seen such words.”“These are in the tongue of the emperor’s homeland.”“Really?” Jennsen gestured to the book the Sister was returning to its place.“Do you know what it says?”“I don’t know the language very well, but ... let me see if I might be able totell.” In the dim light, the Sister squinted at the book for a time, her lipsmoving silently as she worked at the translation, before finally sliding thevolume back in place.“It says, The Pillars of Creation.”“The Pillars of Creation ... What can you tell me about such a book?”The woman shrugged. “There’s a place in the Old World called by that name. Iwould guess the book must be about that.”Before Jennsen could ask anything else, Sister Perdita suddenly emerged frombehind the rear partition of the tent, the candles casting harsh shadows acrossher somber face.Jennsen rushed to meet her. “How are they?” she asked in an urgent whisper.“They’re both going to be all right, aren’t they?”Sister Perdita’s gaze shifted to the Sister who had just replaced the book.“Sister, you are needed by the others. Please go help them.”“But His Excellency told me to guard-”“His Excellency is the one who needs the help. The healing is not going well. Goand help the Sisters.”At that, the woman nodded and rushed off to the back.“Why isn’t the healing going well?” Jennsen asked after the Sister had vanishedbehind the heavy curtain.“A healing that is started and then interrupted, as Emperor Jagang’s was,creates unique problems-especially since the Sister who started it is dead. Eachperson brings unique ability to the task, so to go in later and try to unravelexactly how it was started, much less build on it, makes the healing much moredifficult and delicate.” She offered a small smile. “But we’re confident thatHis Excellency will be fine. It’s just a matter of some concentrated work by theSisters of the Light. I imagine they will be at it most of the night. Bymorning, I’m sure everything will be under control and the emperor will be asstrong as ever.”Jennsen swallowed. “What about Sebastian?”Sister Perdita appraised her with a cool, unreadable look. “I would say thatdepends on you.”“On me? What do you mean? What do I have to do with healing him?”“Everything.”“But, what is it you could possibly need from me?-You have but to ask. I’ll doanything. Please, you must save Sebastian.”The Sister pursed her lips as she clasped her hands. “His recovery hinges onyour commitment to eliminating Richard Rahl.”Jennsen was baffled. “Well, yes, of course, I want to eliminate Richard-”“I said commitment, not words. I need more than mere words.”Jennsen stared a moment. “I don’t understand. I’ve traveled a long and difficultjourney to come here so that I might secure the help of the Sisters of the Lightso that I can get close enough to Lord Rahl to put my knife in his heart.”Sister Perdita smiled that terrible smile of hers. “Well then, if that’s true,then Sebastian should have nothing to worry about.”“Please, Sister, just tell me what it is you want.”“I want Richard Rahl dead.”“Then we share the same goal. If anything, I’d venture that I feel more stronglyabout it than you ever could.”One of the Sister’s eyebrows lifted. “Really. Emperor Jagang said that theSister who was trying to heal him, up in the palace, was killed by wizard’sfire.”“That’s right.”“And did you see the man who did it?”Jennsen thought it strange that Sister Perdita didn’t ask how it was that shewasn’t also killed by the wizard’s fire. “He was an old man. Skinny, with wavywhite hair sticking out in disarray.”“First Wizard Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander,” the Sister said in a venomous hiss.“Yes,” Jennsen said, “I heard someone call him Wizard Zorander. I don’t knowhim.”Sister Perdita glared. “Wizard Zorander is Richard Rahl’s grandfather. “Jennsen’s jaw dropped. “I didn’t know.”“Yet here was a wizard doing all this damage, nearly killing Emperor Jagang, andyou-who claim to be so committed-failed to kill him.”Jennsen held her hands out in frustration. “But, but, I tried, I did. He gotaway. There was so much going on-”“And you think it will be easier to kill Richard Rahl? Words are easy. When itcomes to true commitment, you couldn’t even stop the threat from his dodderingold grandfather!”Jennsen refused to allow herself to fall to tears. It was a struggle. She feltfoolish and shamed. “But I-”“You came here for the help of the Sisters. You said you wanted to kill RichardRahl.”“I do, but what does that have to do with Sebastian-”Sister Perdita held up a finger, commanding silence. “Sebastian is in gravedanger of dying. He was struck by a dangerous form of magic cast by a verypowerful sorceress. Those shards of magic are still in him. Left alone, theywill shortly kill him.”“Please, you must hurry then-”An incensed expression silenced Jennsen. “That magic is also dangerous to us, tothose trying to heal him. For us Sisters to attempt to remove those embeddedshards of magic endangers our lives, as well as his. If we are to risk the livesof Sisters, then I want in return your commitment to kill Richard Rahl.”“How could you place a condition on the life of a man!”The Sister straightened with contempt. “We will have to let many others die inorder to devote the necessary numbers and time to healing this one man. How dareyou ask that of us? How dare you ask us to let others die so that your lovermight live?”Jennsen had no answer to such a terrible question.“If we are to do this, then it must be for something worth more than those livesthat will be lost without our help. Helping this one man must count forsomething. Would you expect less? Would you not want the same? In return for ussaving this man so dear to you-”“He’s dear to you, too! To the Imperial Order! To your cause! To your emperor!”Sister Perdita waited to see if Jennsen would now be silent. When Jennsen’sangry gaze faltered, and finally sank, the Sister continued.“No one individual is important except for what value he can contribute toothers. Only you can provide that value for him. For us saving this man so dearto you, I must have in return your unqualified commitment to stopping RichardRahl, once and for all. Your material commitment to killing him.”“Sister Perdita, you have no conception of how much I wish to kill RichardRahl.” Jennsen’s hands fisted at her sides. “He ordered the murder of my mother.She died in my arms. His rule resulted in Emperor Jagang nearly being killed.Richard is responsible for hurting Sebastian! For suffering beyond anyimagining! For murders beyond estimate! I want Richard Rahl dead!”“Then let us free the voice.”Jennsen stepped back in shock. “What?”“Grushdeva. “Jennsen’s eyes went wide at encountering that word aloud.“Where did you hear that?”A self-satisfied smirk settled comfortably on Sister Perdita’s face. “From you,dear.”“I never-”“At dinner with His Excellency. He asked you why it was you wished to kill yourbrother, what was your reason, your purpose. You said Grushdeva. ““I never said any such thing.”The smirk soured to condescension. “Oh, but you did. Are you going to lie to me?To deny that word has been whispered in your mind?” When Jennsen stood silent,Sister Perdita went on. “Do you know what it means? That word, Grushdeva?”“No,” Jennsen said in a very small voice.“Vengeance.”“How do you know?”“I know that tongue.”Jennsen stood rigid, her shoulders drawn up. “What is it, exactly, you areproposing?”“Why, I’m proposing to save Sebastian’s life.”“But, what else?”Sister Perdita shrugged. “Some of us Sisters will take you out to a quiet place,where we can be alone, while some of us stay here and save Sebastian’s life,like you want. In the morning, he will be better, and then you and he can be onyour way to kill Richard Rahl. You came here for our help. I am proposing togive you that help. With what we do for you, you will be able to accomplish yourtask.”Jennsen swallowed. The voice was strangely silent. Not a word. It was somehowmore awful that it was silent, right then.“Sebastian is dying. He has only moments before it will be too late for us tosave him. Yes, or no, Jennsen Rahl?”“But, what if-”“Yes, or no! Your time has run out. If you want to kill Richard Rahl, if youwant to save Sebastian, then utter but one word. Do it now, or forever wish youhad.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 52After they picketed their horses, Jennsen gave Rusty a rub on the forehead. Withtrembling fingers, she smoothed her other hand along the underside of the jaw asshe pressed the side of her face against the horse’s nose.“Be a good girl until I get back,” she whispered.Rusty neighed softly in response to the gentle words. Jennsen liked to imaginethat the horse could understand her words. From the way her goat, Betty, hadalways cocked her head and stilled her little upright tail as Jennsen confidedher innermost fears, she had firmly believed that her hairy four-legged friendcould understand every word.Jennsen peered overhead at the clawlike branches swaying in the muted light of afull moon occulted by a milky veil of ethereal clouds drifting across the sky,as if gathering to bear silent witness.“Are you coming?”“Yes, Sister Perdita.”“Hurry, then. The others will be waiting.”Jennsen followed the woman up the side of a bank. The mossy ground was litteredwith leathery dried oak leaves and a layer of small branches. Roots emerginghere and there from the loose loam provided enough footing to climb the steeprise. At the top, the ground leveled out, The Sister’s dark gray dress made hernearly vanish as she moved into the thick brush. For a woman with such bigbones, Jennsen noticed that the Sister moved with disturbing grace.The voice remained silent. In tense times like this the voice always whisperedto her. Now it was silent. Jennsen had always wanted the voice to leave her be.She had come to understand just how frightening such silence could be.The full moon, being only thinly obscured, provided enough light to make theirway. Jennsen could see her breath in the cold air as she followed the Sisterinto the thick of the woods back between the low spreading boughs of balsams andspruce. She had always felt at home in the woods, but, somehow, following aSister into the woods didn’t give her the same comforting feeling.She would rather be alone than in the company of the stern woman. Ever sinceJennsen had given her the only word that would save Sebastian’s life, SisterPerdita had settled into a demeanor of blunt superiority devoid of anytolerance. She was now firmly in command, and was certain that Jennsen knew it.At least she had kept her word. As soon as Jennsen had given hers, SisterPerdita had urgently set other Sisters to saving Sebastian’s life. While otherSisters were sent on ahead to prepare whatever it was they had to prepare,Jennsen was allowed to briefly look in on Sebastian to reassure her thateverything possible to save him was being done.Before she had left his side, Jennsen had bent and softly kissed his beautifullips, run her hand tenderly back over his white spikes of hair, and gentlybrushed her lips across both his closed, sky blue eyes. She had whispered aprayer for her mother, with the good spirits, to watch over him.Sister Perdita had not stopped her, or hurried her, until at the end when shepulled Jennsen back and whispered that the Sisters, huddled all around him, hadto be left to do their work.On her way out, Jennsen had been allowed to put her head into the privatechamber of the emperor, and saw four Sisters bent close over his injured leg.The emperor was unconscious. The four Sisters working feverishly on the emperorseemed to be in pain themselves, sometimes putting their hands to their heads inagony. Jennsen hadn’t known, until she saw the four and Sister Perditaexplained, just how unpleasantly difficult healing could be. The Sisters werenot concerned, though, about the life of the emperor being in immediate danger,as they were about Sebastian.Jennsen held a balsam bough back out of her way as she followed the Sisterdeeper into the forbidding wood.“Why do we have to go so far from the camp?” Jennsen whispered. The horsebackride had taken what seemed hours.Sister Perdita’s tail of hair fell forward over her shoulder when she lookedback, as if it were a particularly inane question. “So we can be alone to dowhat must be done.”Jennsen wanted to ask what must be done, but she knew the Sister wouldn’t tellher. The woman had turned away all questions with answers that were no more thangeneral. She said that Jennsen had given her word, and now it was her duty touphold her end of the bargain-to do as she was told until it was finished.Jennsen tried not to think about what might be ahead. She put her mind, instead,to thinking about leaving in the morning with a healthy Sebastian, about beingback out on the trails, out in the countryside, away from all the people. Awayfrom the grim-looking soldiers of the Imperial Order.She knew that the soldiers were doing an invaluable job fighting against LordRahl, but, still, she just couldn’t help the way those men made her skin crawl.She felt as nervous as a fawn being watched by a pack of drooling wolves.Sebastian just didn’t understand whenever she’d tried to put it into words forhim. He was a man; she supposed he couldn’t understand what it felt like to beleered at. How could she make him understand that it was especially daunting tobe watched by men such as those, men with such lecherous grins and savage eyes?If she just did as Sister Perdita. said, then, by morning, she and Sebastiancould leave. With whatever help the Sisters were planning, they had at leastassured her that she would be better able to kill Richard Rahl. That was allJennsen cared about, now. If she could at last kill Lord Rahl, then she would befree. Her life would be her own. And if that much never came to be for herself,at least the rest of the world would be safe from a butcher of momentousproportions.They had left the horses among trees with bare branches-oaks, mostly. Since thetrees had yet to leaf out, the forest had at first been open, but they movedsteadily into thicker woods of balsam, spruce, and pine, many with thick boughsskirting their trunks all the way to the ground. Although the soaring pines hadno lower branches, their spreading crowns sealed off the weak moonlight. Jennsenfollowed behind the Sister, watching her glide deeper into the silent, gloomywood. Jennsen had spent much of her life in forests. She could follow the trailleft by a chipmunk. Sister Perdita was moving with all the certainty of someonefollowing a road, yet there was no trail Jennsen could detect. The ground wascovered with the typical forest litter; none of it had been moved by anyone’spassing. She saw twigs lying undisturbed, dried leaves intact, delicate mossesthat were untouched by any boot. For all Jennsen could tell, she and the Sisterwere making their way through virgin woods without any reason or destination,yet she knew by the deliberate way the Sister moved that she had to have one,even if only she saw it.And then, Jennsen caught a faint sound drifting through the thick woods. She sawa blush of light on the underside of branches ahead. The chill air had an odd,unpleasant cast like the faint scent of rot, but with a sickening sweet trace toit.As she followed Sister Perdita through thick, tightly spaced evergreens, Jennsenbegan to hear the individual voices joined in a low, rhythmic, guttural chant.She couldn’t understand the words, but they resonated deep in her chest, and,the unusual cadence being disturbingly familiar, in the back of her mind. Evenwithout her hearing the individual words, the cant of them almost seemed to bewhat lent the stench to the air. The words, peculiar yet hauntingly intimate,cramped her stomach with nausea.Sister Perdita paused to look back, to make sure that her charge wasn’tflagging. Jennsen could see the faint moonlight reflecting off the ring throughthe Sister’s lower lip. All the Sisters wore one. Jennsen found the customrevolting, even if it was to show loyalty.When Sister Perdita held a low balsam bough aside for her, Jennsen steppedthrough. Hearing the voices in chant beyond had her heart hammering. She couldsee, through the gap, a clearing in the forest, allowing an open view of the skyand moon overhead.Jennsen glanced at the Sister’s stem expression, then continued on to the brinkof the clearing. Before her lay a broad circle of candles. The candles wereplaced so close together that it almost looked like a ring of fire invoked tohold back demons. Just inside the candles, a circle had been made on the bareground with what looked like white sand that glimmered in the moonlight. Allaround just inside the circle, made with the same strange white sand, weregeometric symbols Jennsen didn’t recognize.Seven women sat in a circle inside the sparkling sand. There was one place whereit looked like someone belonged but was missing, no doubt Sister Perdita. Thewomen had their eyes closed as they chanted in the strange language. Moonlightreflected off the rings through their lower lips as they spoke the gratingguttural words.“You are to sit in the center of the circle,” Sister Perdita said in a lowvoice. “Leave your clothes here.”Jennsen looked over into her hard eyes. “What?”“Remove your clothes and sit in the center facing the breach in the circle. “The command was spoken with such cold authority that Jennsen knew that she hadno choice but to obey. The Sister took her cloak, then watched silently. Afterher dress slipped to the ground, Jennsen hugged her goose-bump-coveredshoulders. Her teeth chattered, but it was more than from just the cold. Seeingthe Sister’s silent glare, Jennsen swallowed in revulsion and then hurriedlytook off the rest of her things.Sister Perdita prodded her with a finger. “Go.”“What is it I’m doing?” Jennsen’s own voice sounded surprisingly powerful toher.Sister Perdita considered the question for a moment before finally answering.“You are going to kill Richard Rahl. To help you, we are breaching the veil tothe underworld.”Jennsen shook her head. “No. No, I’m not doing any such thing.”“Everyone does it. When you die, you cross the veil. Death is part of life. Inorder for you to kill Lord Rahl, you are going to need help. We are giving youthat help.”“But the underworld is the world of the dead. I can’t-”“You can and you will. You have already given your word. If you don’t do this,then how many more will Lord Rahl go on to murder? You will do this, or you willhave the blood of each of those victims on your hands. By refusing, you will beinvoking the death of countless people. You, Jennsen Rahl, will be aiding yourbrother. You, Jennsen Rahl, will be throwing open the doors of death andallowing all those people to die. You, Jennsen Rahl, will be the Keeper’sdisciple. We are asking you to have the courage to reject that, and to turndeath, instead, on Richard Rahl. “Jennsen shivered, tears running down her face, as she considered SisterPerdita’s terrible challenge, her terrible choice. Jennsen prayed to her mother,asking what she should do, but no sign arrived to help her. Even the voice wassilent.Jennsen stepped over the candles.She had to do this. She had to end the rule of Richard Rahl.Thankfully, the center of the whole careful arrangement at least looked dark.Jennsen was mortified being naked in front of strangers, even if they werewomen, but that was the least of her fears at the moment.As she stepped across the circle of glimmering white sand, it felt frighteninglycolder, as if she were stepping into the grip of living winter. She shivered andshook, hugging herself, as she made her way to the center of the circle ofwomen.In the middle was a Grace made of the same white sand, sparkling in themoonlight. She stood staring down at it, a symbol she herself had drawn manytimes, but her hand was not guided by the gift.“Sit,” Sister Perdita said.Jennsen started with a gasp. The woman was standing right behind her. When shepressed on Jennsen’s shoulders, Jennsen sank to the ground, sitting cross-leggedin the center of the eight-pointed star in the center of the Grace. She noticed,then, that each of the Sisters sat at the extension of a ray coming from eachpoint of the star, save one directly in front. That spot was empty.Jennsen sat naked, shivering, in the center of the circle as the Sisters of theLight began their soft chanting again.The woods were dark and gloomy, the trees bare of leaves. The branches clackedtogether in the wind like the bones of the dead Jennsen feared the Sisters werecalling forth.The chanting suddenly halted. Rather than sit in the single empty spot remainingin the circle of Sisters, as Jennsen had expected, Sister Perdita stood behindher and spoke short, sharp words in the strange language.At points in the long, singsong speech, Sister Perdita stressed a word,Grushdeva-and cast her arm out over Jennsen’s head, flinging out dust. The dustignited with a roaring whoosh that made Jennsen jump each time she did it, theharsh light bathing the Sisters briefly in the light of the rolling flame.As the fire ascended, the seven Sisters spoke as if with one voice. “Tu vashmisht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht. “Not only were those words she knew, but Jennsen realized that the voice wasspeaking the words in her head along with the Sisters. It was both frighteningand comforting to have the voice back. The anxiety when the voice had gonestrangely silent had been unbearable.“Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht.Jennsen was lulled by the sound of the chanting, and as it went on, calmed, too.She thought about what it was that had brought her to this point, about theterror her life had been, from the time when she was six and she fled thePeople’s Palace with her mother, to all the times that Lord Rahl had come closeand they’d run for their lives, to that awful rainy night when Lord Rahl’s menwere in her house. Jennsen felt tears coursing down her cheeks as she thoughtabout her mother there on the floor dying. As she thought about Sebastianfighting valiantly. As she thought about her mother’s last words, and having torun and leave her mother there on the bloody floor. Jennsen cried out with theterrible anguish of it.“Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht.Jennsen cried in racking sobs. She missed her mother. She was afraid forSebastian. She felt so terribly alone in the world. She had seen so many peopledie. She wanted it to end. She wanted it to stop.“Tu vash misht. Tu vask misht. Grushdeva du kalt misht. “When she looked up, through her watery vision, she saw something dark sitting inthe spot before her that had moments before been empty. Its eyes glowed like thecandlelight. Jennsen stared into those eyes, as if staring into the voiceitself.“TU vash misht, Jennsen. Tu vask misht, Jennsen, “ the voice before her and inher head said in a low, growling voice. “Open yourself to me, Jennsen. Openyourself for me, Jennsen.”Jennsen could not move in the glowing glare of those eyes. That was the voice,only not in her head. It was the voice in front of her.Sister Perdita, behind her, cast out her dust again, and this time, when itignited, it lit the person sitting there with the glowing eyes.It was her mother.“Jennsen,” her mother cooed. “Surangie.”“What?” Jennsen whimpered in shock.“Surrender.”Tears flooded forth in an uncontrollable torrent. “Mama! Oh, Mama!”Jennsen started to rise, started to go to her mother, but Sister Perdita presseddown on her shoulders, keeping her in place.As the rolling flames lifted and evaporated, as the light faded, her mothervanished into the darkness, and before her was the thing with the glowingcandlelight eyes.“Grushdeva du kalt misht, “ the voice growled.“What?” Jennsen wept.“Vengeance is through me,” the voice growled in translation. “Surangie, Jennsen.Surrender, and vengeance will be yours.”“Yes!” Jennsen wailed in inconsolable agony. “Yes! I surrender to vengeance!”The thing grinned, like a door to the underworld opening.It rose up, a wavering shadow, leaning forward toward her. Moonlight glistenedon knotted muscles as it stretched out, coming toward her, almost catlike,smiling, showing those heart-stopping fangs.Jennsen was beyond knowing what to do, except that she had had all she couldtake, and wanted it to end. She could take none of it any longer. She wanted tokill Richard Rahl. She wanted vengeance. She wanted her mother back.The thing was right before her, shimmering power and form that was there, butnot, partly in this world and partly in another.Jennsen saw then, beyond the thing, beyond the ring of Sisters and sparklingwhite sand and candles, huge shapes out in the shadows-things on four legs.There were hundreds of them, their eyes all glowing yellow in the darkness,breath steaming up from snarls. They looked like they could have come fromanother world, but were most definitely now wholly in this one.“Jennsen,” the voice hovering close over her whispered, “Jennsen,” it cooed,“Jennsen.” It smiled a smile as dark as Emperor Jagang’s eyes, as dark as amoonless night.“What . . .” She whispered through her tears. “What are those things out there?”“Why, the hounds of vengeance,” the voice whispered intimately. “Embrace me, andI shall unleash them.”Her eyes widened. “What?”“Surrender to me, Jennsen. Embrace me, and I shall unleash the hounds in yourname.”Jennsen couldn’t blink as she sank back away from the thing. She could hardlybreathe. A low sound, a kind of purring rattle, came from the throat of thething as it stretched over her, looking down into her eyes.She was trying to think of that little word, that important little word. It wassomewhere in her mind, but as she stared up into those glowing eyes, shecouldn’t think of it. Her mind felt frozen. She wanted that word, but it wasn’tthere.“Grushdeva A kalt misht, “ the voice cooed in that throaty, echoing growl.“Vengeance is through me.”“Vengeance,” Jennsen whispered numbly in answer.“Open yourself to me, open yourself for me. Surrender. Avenge your mother.”The thing passed a long finger over her face, and she could feel where RichardRahl was-as if she could feel the bond that told others where he was. To thesouth. Distant, to the south. She could find him, now.“Embrace me,” the voice breathed, inches from her face.Jennsen was flat on her back. The realization both surprised and alarmed her.She didn’t recall lying back. She felt like she was watching someone else dothese things. She realized that the thing that was the voice was kneelingbetween her open legs.“Surrender your will, Jennsen. Surrender your flesh,” the voice cooed, and Iwill release the hounds for you. I will help you kill Richard Rahl.”The word was gone. Lost. Just like her ... lost.“I ... I,” she stammered as tears ran from her wide eyes.“Embrace me, and vengeance will be yours. Richard Rahl will be yours to kill.Embrace me. Surrender your flesh, and with it, your will.”She was Jennsen Rahl. It was her life.“No.”The Sisters in the circle wailed in sudden pain. They held their hands to theirears, crying in agony, howling like hounds.The glowing candlelight eyes peered down at her. The smile returned, this timevapor hissing from between wet fangs.“Surrender, Jennsen,” the voice rumbled with such terrible command that Jennsenthought it might crush her. “Surrender your flesh. Surrender your will. And thenyou will have vengeance. You will have Richard Rahl. ““No,” she said, shrinking back as the thing stretched closer to her face. Herfingers dug into the dirt. “No! I will surrender my flesh, my will, if that isthe price, if that is what I must do to rid the world of life of the murderingbastard Richard Rahl, but I will not do so until you give me that, first.”“A bargain?” the voice hissed. The glow in the eyes went red. “You wish tobargain with me?”“That is my price. Release your hounds. Help me kill Richard Rahl. When I havevengeance, then I will surrender.”The thing grinned a nightmare grin.A long thin tongue snaked out, licking her, in terrible intimate promise, fromher naked crotch all the way up to between her breasts. It sent a violentshudder through her to her very soul.“Bargain struck, Jennsen Rahl.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 53Friedrich wove his way between the fat clumps of grasses at the edge of thesmall lake, trying not to think about how hungry he was. With the way hisstomach grumbled, he was not having much success. Fish might be nice for achange, but fish had to be cooked, and first he had to catch one. He gazed alongthe water’s edge. Frog legs would be good, too. A meal of dried meat, though,would be quicker. He wished he had gotten a hard biscuit out of his pack thelast time he’d stopped for a respite. At least if he had, he would havesomething to suck on.In some places, shorter grass bowed over to line the lake’s edge like a greenpelt. In other places there were hushed stands of tall reeds. As the sun sankbehind the low hills beyond the lake, it began to turn gloomy in among theimposing trees, contorted by great age, on the other side of the path. The airwas dead still, leaving the mirrored surface of the water gilded with the goldenglow of the western sky.Friedrich paused to stand at ease, stretching his back, as he peered into theshadows among the trees. He needed a brief break to rest his tired legs as heconsidered whether or not he should stop for the night to set up a shelter, orat least get out a biscuit. He could see dark stretches of standing water inamong trees draped with long strands of gauzy moss.The hilly countryside was easy enough traveling, when the path stayed up out ofthe low places. Down in the depressions it tended to be swampy and hard going.He didn’t like the swampy places; they brought back painful memories.Friedrich swished at a small cloud of gnats flitting around his face, thenshifted the shoulder straps of his pack as he tried to decide what to do-makecamp, or push on. Even though he was tired and sore from an arduous day oftraveling, he had grown stronger over the course of such a long journey and wasnow better able to stand the rigors of his new life-at least, much more so thanhe had been at first.As he walked along, Friedrich often talked, in his mind, to Althea. He woulddescribe to her all the sights he was seeing, the terrain, the vegetation, thesky, hoping that in the world beyond she was able to hear him and smiled hergolden smile.With the day drawing to an end, he had to decide what to do. He didn’t want tobe traveling when it grew too dark. It was a new moon, so he knew that, once theafterglow of dusk receded, the darkness would be nearly total. There were noclouds, so at least the starlight would stave off the kind of smothering, totalblackness he hated most, the kind where he couldn’t even see up from down-thatwas the worst. That was when he was most lonely.Even with the stars out, it was difficult to travel unknown regions by starlightalone. In darkness it was easy to wander off the path and end up getting lost.Getting lost would mean that in the morning he would likely have to backtrack tofind a way through an impassable area, or find the trail, and in the end itaccomplished nothing but to waste time.It would be wise to set up camp. It was warm, so he wouldn’t really need a fire,although for some reason he felt as if he wanted one. Still, with a fire, hemight attract notice. He had no real way to know who might be around, and acampfire could be spotted for miles. Best not to have a fire, as much comfort asit would provide, in exchange for the security. At least there would be starsoverhead.He considered, too, the possibility that if he kept going the trail mightshortly lift out of the boggy lowlands and he would come across a better placefor a campsite-a place not as likely to be rife with snakes. Snakes, seekingwarmth, would slither up to be close to a person sleeping on the ground. He’dnot like to wake to find a snake cuddled up to him under his blanket. Friedrichhiked his pack up higher on his back. There was still enough light to push onfor a while.Before he could start out again, he heard a small sound. Even though it wasn’tloud, the inexplicable nature of it made him turn and look back up the trail tothe north, the direction from which he had come. He couldn’t quite put the soundto anything that came to mind, to any frog or squirrel or bird. As he listened,it was again dead quiet.“I’m getting too old for this sort of thing,” he muttered to himself as hestarted out once more.The other reason nagging at him to keep going, the reason that was actually themost important, was that he hated to stop when he was this close. Of course, itcould still be distant enough to require a walk of several days-it was hard forhim to tell with any precision-but it was also possible that he was much closer.If that was the case, stopping for the night would be foolish. Time was of theessence.He could walk for a little longer, at least. There was still time to make camp,if he had to, before it was too dark. He supposed he could push on until hecouldn’t see the trail well enough to follow it and then make himself a place tosleep in the grass beside the lake, but Friedrich didn’t really relish thenotion of sleeping out in the open right beside a trail, either, not when he wasso deep into the Old World, and not when he knew there could be night patrolsabout. He’d been seeing more of the Order’s patrolling troops in recent days.He’d avoided cities and towns, for the most part sticking as close as he couldto a straight course down through the Old World. Several times he’d had tochange that course when the destination had changed. As he traveled, Friedrichhad gone to great pains to avoid troops. Being near any of the Order soldiersmeant there was always the potential of being detained for questioning. While hewasn’t as free of suspicion as a farmer in his own home might be, he knew thatan older man traveling alone didn’t look very threatening to big young soldiersand wasn’t likely to raise suspicions.However, he also knew, from bits of conversation he’d overheard when he had beenin towns, that the Imperial Order had no qualms about torturing people when thefancy struck them. Torture had the great advantage of always eliciting aconfession of guilt, which proved the questioner’s wise judgment in havingsuspicions in the first place, and, if desired, could produce the names of moreconspirators with “wrong thoughts,” as he had heard told. A cruel questionernever ran out of work or guilty people needing punishment.At a snapping sound, Friedrich turned around and stood still as a stump,listening, watching. The sky and lake were mirrored violet. Tree limbs stood outstill and silent, hanging out over sections of the path like claws waiting tosnatch travelers when it became dark enough.The woods were probably full of creatures just coming out from a long day’ssleep to hunt at night. Owls, voles, opossum, raccoons, and other creaturesbecame more active as it got dark. He watched, waiting to see if he heard thesound again. Nothing moved in the hush of twilight.Friedrich turned back to the trail and hurried his steps. It must be somecreature, searching through the forest litter, looking for a grub. His breathingquickened with his increased effort. He tried to wet his mouth by working histongue, but it wasn’t really doing much good. Despite his thirst, he didn’t wantto stop to have a drink of water.He was just imagining things, he knew. He was in a strange land, by a strangewood, and it was getting dark. He wasn’t usually so susceptible to being spookedby the little noises in the woods that frightened most people. He’d lived in theswamp with Althea a good long time, and he knew about truly terrifying beasts;he also knew a great deal about the variety of those creatures that wereinnocent enough, just going about their own lives. This was undoubtedlyinnocent. Still, he no longer felt tired or wanted to stop for the night.Friedrich turned to look over his shoulder as he hurried along the faintly littrail. He had the uncanny feeling that there was something behind him. Somethingwatching him. The thought of being watched made the hair at the nape of his neckstand on end.He kept looking but he saw nothing. It remained quiet behind him. He knew thateither it was too quiet, or else his imagination was too active.Breathing hard, his heart pounding, Friedrich quickened his pace. Maybe if hehurried, he would finally get there, and not have to be all alone in the nightout in the woods.He glanced back over his shoulder again.Eyes were watching him.It startled him so much that he tripped over his own feet and fell sprawling tothe ground. He scrambled around to sit up and face back down the trail as hecrabbed backward on his hands and feet.The skulking eyes were still there. He hadn’t imagined it. Twin, glowing, yelloweyes watching from back in the dark gloom of the woods.In the still hush, he heard a low growl as the beast stole out of the shadowsinto the somber light between the forest and the lake. It was huge-maybe twicethe size of a wolf, with a massive chest and bull neck.It took careful steps, the head hovering low to the ground as it advanced,glowing eyes never leaving him.The thing was stalking.With a cry, Friedrich scrambled to his feet and took off running as fast as hislegs would fly. His age mattered little when powered by such a fright. A quickglance over his shoulder revealed the beast bounding down the trail behind him,easily closing the distance.Worse yet, in that brief glance back, Friedrich saw more pairs of glowing yelloweyes emerging from the woods to join in the pursuit.They were coming out for the night’s hunt.Friedrich was their prey.The howling beast hit his back with such force that it drove the wind from hislungs. He pitched face-first to the ground, hitting with a grunt, slidingthrough the dirt. As he tried to scramble away, the powerful beast pounced onhim. Raging with snarling snapping teeth, it lunged, caught his backpack,tearing it open in a mad effort to get at his bone and muscle.Friedrich vividly envisioned being torn apart.He knew he was about to die."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 54Friedrich screamed in terror as he struggled frantically to escape. Right overhis shoulder the thing howled with vicious fury as snapping teeth tore thoughhis backpack, trying to rip him apart. His backpack, stuffed full of his things,was now a bulwark between Friedrich and the huge teeth tearing at him. Theweight of the savage beast held him down, and the clutching forelegs kept himfrom being able to wriggle away, much less get up and run.With desperate urgency, Friedrich forced his hand under himself, trying to reachhis knife. His fingers caught the handle and pulled it free. Immediately, hestruck out, slamming his blade into the beast. It hit hidecovered shoulder bone,doing little damage. He stabbed again, but failed to make contact. Fighting forall he was worth, he slashed as he rolled, missing the beast, trying to get awaywhen it ducked his blade.Just as he was about to escape to the side, if only to spare himselfmomentarily, more of the beasts bounded into the fray. Friedrich screamed again,slashing with his knife, trying to protect his face with his other arm at thesame time. He managed to get up on his hands and knees, only to have another ofthe beasts pounce and knock him sprawling.Friedrich saw the book tumble out of the inner pocket he’d stitched into hispack. Their teeth had ripped open the sealed compartment. The beasts lunged forthe book. The one that snatched it up in its jaws snarled and shook its headlike a hound with a hare.Just as another of the howling creatures roared toward him, wet fangs stretchingwide, the head abruptly spun crazily away. Hot blood splashed across the side ofFriedrich’s face and neck. It was totally unexpected and completelydisorienting.“In the water!” a man yelled at him. “Jump in the water!”It was all Friedrich could do to roll and twist, trying to keep himself from thesnapping snarling beasts. He certainly had no intention of going into the water;he had no desire to be set upon by such ferocious animals in water. That was afavorite trick of beasts in the swamp-get you in the water, then they had you.Going in the water was the last thing Friedrich wanted.The world seemed to go mad with steel flashing by his face, just over his head,up along the side of him, whistling through the air, slicing beasts apart witheach mighty swing, defending him just before they were on him. Reeking, slipperyinnards spilled across the ground, slopped across his legs.The man above stepped over Friedrich, straddling him. His sword slashed andstabbed with swift, fluid grace that Friedrich found spellbinding. The strangerstood his ground over Friedrich, cutting through the creatures as they charged,seemingly dozens of them, all snarling and howling.Friedrich saw yet more of the wild beasts bound out of the woods. Withfrightening speed and terrifying determination, they leaped at the man standingover him, throwing themselves at him with wild abandon. Friedrich saw anotherswordsman to the side slice into the onslaught. He thought he saw a third personbehind, but with all the furious activity, he wasn’t sure how many rescuersthere might be. The strident snarling, ringing howls, and roaring growls, all soclose, were deafening. When one of the heavy beasts crashed sideways into him,Friedrich stabbed it, only to see that it was already headless.As the second person raced in close to join the fray, the man standing overFriedrich stepped to the side, reached down with one hand, snatched a fistful ofhis shirt, lifted him to his feet, and, with a grunt, heaved him out into thelake. Friedrich had no time to get his balance and only an instant to gasp abreath before he hit the water. He plunged under, unable to tell up from down inthe dark depths.Breaking the surface, gasping for air, splashing for the shore, Friedrichfinally found footing on the muddy bottom and was just able to keep his headabove the surface of the water. To his surprise, none of the beasts came inafter him. Several raced to the shore, but stopped short, unwilling to enter thewater despite how much they hungered to have him. When they saw he was out ofreach, they returned to the attack and were killed as soon as they joined theothers charging the big man.The beasts leaped at the three from all sides, the fierce battle raging on withfrightening intensity. As fast as the animals attacked, they were dispatcheddecisively-beheaded, stabbed, or rent open with mighty swings of a sword.With sudden finality, the dark figure swung upward, lopping the head off a beastas it leaped through the air toward the second person. The night finally fellsilent, but for the heavy breathing of the three people up on the trail.The three stepped out of the pile of unmoving carcasses, to sit wearily on thebank, exhausted, heads hanging as they caught their breath.“Are you all right?” the first of the three, the one who had saved Friedrich’slife, asked. His voice was still filled with the terrible rage of battle. Hisblood-slick sword, still in his hand, glinted in starlight.Friedrich, stunned and shivering, suddenly weak with relief, took several stepstoward the shore, water sluicing off him, until he was standing waist-deep inthe lake before the man.“Yes, thanks to you. Why’d you throw me in the water like that?”The man raked his fingers back through thick hair. “Because,” he said betweendeep breaths pulled not just from exertion, but driven by wrath, “heart houndswon’t go in water. It was the safest place for you.”Friedrich swallowed as his gaze played over the dark heaps of hounds. “I don’tknow how to thank you. You saved my life.”“Well,” the man said, still catching his breath, “I happen not to like hearthounds. They’ve scared the wits out of me on more than one occasion. “Friedrich feared to ask where the man would have seen such fearsome creaturesbefore.“We were way back up the trail when we saw them come out after you.” It was awoman’s voice. Friedrich stared at the figure in the middle who had spoken asshe caught her breath. He could just make out her long fall of hair. “We wereworried that we wouldn’t reach you before the heart hounds had you,” she added.“But ... what are heart hounds?”The three figures stared at him.“The more important question,” the first man said at last in a quiet, measured,but commanding voice, “is why were heart hounds here at all. Do you have anyidea why they might have been after you?”“No, sir. I’ve never seen such creatures before.”“It’s been a long while since I’ve seen heart hounds,” the man said, soundingtroubled. Friedrich almost thought that he’d been going to say more about thehounds, but instead he asked, “What’s your name?”“Friedrich Gilder, sir, and you have my undying gratitude-all of you do. Ihaven’t been that scared since-well, since I don’t know when.” He looked to thethree faces watching him, but it was too dark to clearly make out theirfeatures.The first man put an arm around the woman, in the middle, and in a whisper askedif she was all right. She answered with the kind of nod against his shoulderthat Friedrich knew conveyed true concern and intimate familiarity. When hisfingers reached past, touching the shoulder beyond her, the third figure nodded.These weren’t at all likely to be Imperial Order soldiers. Still, there werealways other risks in such a strange land. Friedrich took a chance.“May I ask your name, sir?”“Richard.”Friedrich took a cautious step closer, but, for some reason, by the way thesilent third person watched him, he feared to step up out of the water anycloser to Richard and the woman.Richard swished his blade clean in the water, then stood. After wiping bothsides dry on his leg, he slid the sword home into its scabbard at his hip. Inthe dim light, Friedrich could see that the lustrous silver and gold wroughtscabbard was secured with a baldric over Richard’s right shoulder. Friedrich waspretty sure that he remembered the look of that baldric and scabbard. Friedrichhad carved for nearly his whole life and also recognized a certain effortlessgrace with a blade-no matter what kind of blade. Artful control was required towield edged steel with mastery. When it was in Richard’s hands, he truly seemedin his element. Friedrich well remembered the sword the man was wearing thatday. He wondered if this could possibly be that same remarkable weapon.With a foot, Richard prodded at parts of heart hounds, searching. He bent andlifted a severed hound head. Friedrich saw then that the beast had somethingclenched in its teeth. Richard tugged at it, but it was impaled on the fangs. Ashe worked it out of the hound’s mouth, off the fangs, Friedrich’s eyes went widewhen he realized that it was the book. The hound had tom it out of the backpack.“Please.” Friedrich lifted a hand, reaching. “Is it ... is it all right?”Richard tossed the heavy head aside, where it thumped down and rolled into thetrees. He peered closely at the book in the dim light. His hand lowered and helooked over at Friedrich standing in waist-deep water.“I think you had better tell me who you are, and why you’re here,” Richard said.The woman rose up at the dark tone in Richard’s voice.Friedrich cleared his throat and swallowed back his worry. “Like I said, I’mFriedrich Gilder.” He took a terrible chance. “I’m looking for a man related toa very old fellow I know named Nathan.”Richard stood staring for a moment. “Nathan. Big man? Tall, long white hair tohis shoulders? Thinks a lot of himself” He sounded not just surprised, butsuspicious as well. “Born-for-mischief Nathan?”Friedrich smiled at the last part, and with relief. His bond had served himwell. He bowed, as best he could standing in the water.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Lord Rahl watched as Friedrich finally straightened, and then extended a handdown. “Come out of the water, Master Gilder,” he said in a gentle voice.Friedrich was somewhat confounded to be offered a helping hand by Lord Rahlhimself, and yet didn’t know how he could refuse what could be judged an order.He took the hand and pulled himself up out of the water.Friedrich went to a knee, bowing forward. “Lord Rahl, my life is yours.”“Thank you, Master Gilder. I’m honored by your gesture, and value the sincerity,but your life is your own, and belongs to no one else. That includes me.”Friedrich stared up in wonder. He had never heard anyone say anything soremarkable, so unimaginable, least of all a Lord Rahl. “Please, sir, would youcall me Friedrich?”Lord Rahl laughed. It was a sound as easy and pleasant as any Friedrich had everheard. It made a smile well up through him, too.“If you’ll call me Richard.”“I’m sorry, Lord Rahl but ... I’m afraid that I just couldn’t bring myself to dosuch a thing. I’ve spent my whole life with a Lord Rahl, and I’m too old tochange it, now.”Lord Rahl hooked a thumb behind his wide belt. “I understand, Friedrich, butwe’re deep in the Old World. If you utter the words ‘Lord Rahl’ and anyone hearsyou, we’re all likely to have a great deal of trouble on our hands, so I wouldgreatly appreciate it if you would do your best to learn to call me Richard.”“I’ll try, Lord Rahl.”Lord Rahl held out an introductory hand. “This is the Mother Confessor, Kahlan,my wife.”Friedrich went to a knee again, bowing his head. “Mother Confessor.” He wasn’tsure how to properly greet such a woman.“Now, Friedrich,” she said with as much of a scolding tone as Lord Rahl’s, butin a voice that he thought revealed a woman of rare grace, command, and heart,“that title, too, will serve us ill, here.” It was as lovely a voice asFriedrich had ever heard, its lucid quality holding him spellbound. He had seenthe woman once, in the palace; the voice fit his memory of her perfectly.Friedrich nodded. “Yes, ma’am.” He thought he might be able to learn to callLord Rahl “Richard,” but he was almost positive that he would never be able tocall this woman anything other than “Mother Confessor.” The familiar name Kahlanseemed a privilege beyond him.Lord Rahl gestured past the Mother Confessor. “And this is our friend, Cara.Don’t let her scare you-she’ll try. Besides being a friend, first, she is avalued protector, who remains always concerned for our safety above all else.”He glanced over at her. “Although, lately, she has been causing more troublethan help.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara growled, “I told you that wasn’t my fault. I had nothing to dowith it.”“You’re the one who touched it.”“Well ... how was I supposed to know!”“I told you to leave it be, but you had to touch it.”“I couldn’t very well just leave it, now could l?”Friedrich didn’t understand a word of the exchange. But even in the neardarkness, he could see the Mother Confessor smile and pat Cara on the shoulder.“It’s all right, Cara,” she whispered reassuringly.“We’ll figure something out, Cara,” Lord Rahl added in a sigh. “We still havetime.” He turned suddenly solemn and switched his line of thought as swiftly ashe changed direction with that sword of his. He waggled the book. “The houndswere after this.”Friedrich eyebrows went up in astonishment. “They were?”“Yes. You were just the treat for doing a good job.”“How do you know?”“Heart hounds would never attack a book. They would have fought to the deathover your heart, first, had they not been sent for another reason.”“So that’s why they’re called heart hounds,” Friedrich said.“That’s one theory. The other is that with those big round ears, they can findtheir victim by the sound of their beating heart. Either way, I’ve never heardof a heart hound going for a book when a human heart was there for the taking.”Friedrich gestured to the book. “Lord-sorry, Richard-Nathan sent me with thisbook. He thought it was very important. I guess he was right.”Lord Rahl turned back from staring at the hounds sprawled across the ground. Ifit had not been dark, Friedrich was sure he would have seen a frown, but hecertainly could hear repressed anger in the man’s voice. “Nathan thinks a lot ofthings are important-usually prophecies.”“But Nathan was sure about this.”“He always is. He’s helped me before, I don’t deny that.” Lord Rahl shook hishead with determination. “But, from the beginning, prophecy has been the causeof more trouble for us than I care to think about. Heart hounds mean we suddenlyhave immediate, deadly danger on our hands. I don’t need Nathan’s propheciesadding to my problems. I know some people think prophecy is a gift, but I regardit as a curse best avoided.”“I understand,” Friedrich said with a wistful smile. “My wife was a sorceress.Her gift was prophecy. She sometimes called it her curse.” His smile faltered.“I sometimes held her as she wept over some foretelling she saw, but could notchange.”Lord Rahl watched him in the awkward silence. “She’s passed away, then?”Friedrich could only nod as he sagged under the pain of the memories.“I’m sorry, Friedrich,” Lord Rahl said in a quiet voice.“So am I,” the Mother Confessor whispered in sad, sincere sympathy. She turnedto her husband, clasping his upper arm. “Richard, I know we don’t have time forNathan’s prophecies, but we can hardly ignore what heart hounds mean.”Distress sounded heavily in Lord Rahl’s sigh. “I know.”“What are we going to do?”Friedrich saw him shake his head in the dim light. “We’ll have to hope they canhandle it, for now. This is more urgent. We’ll need to find Nicci, and fast.Let’s just hope she has some ideas.”The Mother Confessor seemed to accept what he’d said as sensible. Even Cara wasnodding silent agreement.“I’ll tell you what, Friedrich,” the Mother Confessor said in a voice steadywith mettle. “We were about to set up camp for the night. With the heart houndsloose, you had better stay with us until we meet up with some of our friends ina day or two and have better protection. At camp you can tell us what this isall about.”“I’ll listen to what Nathan wants,” Lord Rahl said, “but that’s all I canpromise. Nathan is a wizard; he’s going to have to solve his own problems; wehave enough of our own. Let’s make camp, first, somewhere safe. I’ll at leasttake a look at this book-if it’s still readable. You can tell me why Nathanthinks it’s so important. Just spare me the prophecies.”“No prophecies, Lord Rahl. In fact, the lack of prophecy is the real problem.”Lord Rahl gestured around at the carcasses. “This is the immediate problem. We’dbetter find a spot down there in the swamp, surrounded by water, if we want tolive to see morning. There will be more where these came from.”Friedrich peered nervously around in the darkness. “Where do they come from?”“The underworld,” Lord Rahl said.Friedrich’s jaw dropped. “The underworld? But how is such a thing possible?”“Only one way,” Lord Rahl said in a low voice filled with terrible knowledge.“Heart hounds are, in a way, the guardians of the underworld-the Keeper’shounds. They can only be here because the veil between life and death has beenbreached.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 55The four of them started down the path, heading toward the dark expanse oflow-lying forest, as Friedrich contemplated the staggering significance of theveil between the world of life and the world of the dead being breached. Thelatter part of Althea’s life revolved around the Grace she used in her tellings,so he certainly knew about the veil between worlds. Over the years, Althea hadoften spoken to him about it. In particular, preceding her death, she had toldhim much of what she had come to believe about the interaction of those worlds.“Lord Rahl,” Friedrich said, “I think what you said about the veil between theworld of the living and the dead being tom might be tied in with why Nathanthought it was so vital that I reach you with this book. He doesn’t want you tohelp him-that’s not why he sent me with this book-he meant this to help you.”Lord Rahl snorted a laugh. “Right. That’s the way he always puts it-that he onlywants to help you.”“But I think this is about your sister.”Everyone froze in their tracks.Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor spun around, hovering close to him. Even inthe darkness, Friedrich could see how wide their eyes were open.“I have a sister?” Lord Rahl whispered.“Yes, Lord Rahl,” Friedrich said, taken by surprise that he didn’t know. “Well,a half sister, actually. She, too, is the offspring of Darken Rahl. “Lord Rahl seized him by the upper arms. “I have a sister? Do you know anythingabout her?”“Yes, Lord Rahl. A little, anyway. I’ve met her.”“Met her! Friedrich, that’s wonderful! What’s she like? How old is she?”“Not many years younger than you, Lord Rahl. Early twenties, I’d say.”“Is she smart?” he asked with a grin.“Too smart for her own good, I’m afraid.”Lord Rahl laughed in delight. “I can’t believe it! Kahlan, isn’t that wonderful?I have a sister.”“It doesn’t sound wonderful to me,” Cara growled before the Mother Confessorcould answer. “It doesn’t sound wonderful at all!”“Cara, how can you say that?” the Mother Confessor asked.Cara leaned toward them. “Need I remind you both of the trouble we had when LordRahl’s half brother, Drefan, showed up?”“No . . .” Lord Rahl said, clearly troubled by the mention.Everyone fell silent. “What happened?” Friedrich finally dared to ask.He gasped when Cara snatched him by the collar and jerked him close to her hotglare. “That bastard son of Darken Rahl nearly killed the Mother Confessor! AndLord Rahl! He nearly killed me! He did kill a lot of other people. He nearly goteveryone killed. I hope the Keeper of the dead put Drefan Rahl in a cold darkhole for all of eternity. If you only knew what he did to the Mother Confessor-”“That’s enough, Cara,” the Mother Confessor said in quiet command as she put ahand on the woman’s arm, gently urging her to release Friedrich’s collar.Cara complied, but, in the heat of anger, only with great reluctance. Friedrichcould clearly see why this woman was a guard to the Lord Rahl and the MotherConfessor. Even though he could not see her eyes, he could feel them, like ahawk’s, locked on him even in the dark. This was a woman whose penetratingjudgment could weigh a man’s soul, and decide his fate. This was a woman notonly with the authority, but with the ability, to act on what she decided wasnecessary.Friedrich knew, because he had seen women like this often in the People’sPalace. When her hand came out from under her cloak to snatch him by the collar,he’d seen her Agiel dangling on a chain from her wrist. This was a Mord-Sith.“I’m sorry about your half brother,” Friedrich said. “But I don’t think Jennsenmeans you harm.”“Jennsen,” he whispered, testing his first encounter with the name of someone henever knew existed.“As a matter of fact, Jennsen is terrified of you, Lord Rahl.”“Terrified of me? Why would she be afraid of me?”“She thinks you’re after her.”Lord Rahl stared incredulously. “After her? How can I be after her?I’ve beenstruck down here in the Old World.”“She thinks you want to kill her, that you send men to hunt her down.”He was stunned to silence for a moment, as if each new thing he was hearing waseven more incredible than the last. “But . I don’t even know her. Why would Iwant to kill her?”“Because she is ungifted.”Lord Rahl stepped back, trying to understand what Friedrich was telling him.“What difference does that make? Lots of people are ungifted.”Friedrich pointed to the book in Lord Rahl’s hand. “I think Nathan sent thatbook to explain it.”“Prophecy won’t help explain anything.”“No, Lord Rahl. I don’t think this has to do with prophecy so much as with freewill. You see, I know some about prophecy from my wife. Nathan explained howprophecy needs free will, and that’s why you react so strongly against prophecy,because you are a man who brings free will to balance the magic of prophecy. Hesaid that prophecy had not proclaimed it to be me who was to bring this book toyou, but that I had to bring it of my own free will.”Lord Rahl stared at the book in the darkness. His tone softened. “Nathan can betrouble at times, but I know he’s a friend who has helped me before. His helpcan sometimes cause me considerable trouble, but even if I don’t always agreewith the things he chooses to do, I know he chooses to do them for good reason.”“I loved a sorceress for most of my life, Lord Rahl. I know how complex suchthings as this can be. I would not have come all this way if I didn’t believeNathan in this.”Lord Rahl appraised him for a moment. “Did Nathan say what was in this book?”“He told me the book is from the time of a great war, thousands of years ago. Hesaid he discovered it in the People’s Palace after a frantic search among thethousands of tomes there, and that as soon as he’d located it he brought it tome, to ask that I take it to you. He said time was so urgently short that hedare not take any more to translate the book. Because of that, he didn’t knowwhat was in it.”Lord Rahl looked down at the book with considerably more interest. “Well, Idon’t know how much good it’s going to be able to do us. The hounds did a lot ofdamage to it. I’m beginning to fear why.”“Richard, do you know at least what it says on the cover?” the Mother Confessorasked.“I only saw it in the light long enough to see that it was in High D’Haran. Ididn’t try to translate it. It says something about Creation.”“You’re right, Lord Rahl. Nathan told me the title.” Friedrich tapped the book.“It says, there, on the cover, in gilded letters, The Pillars of Creation. ““Great,” Lord Rahl muttered, seemingly in unhappy recognition of the title.“Well, let’s get to a safe place and set up camp. I don’t want the heart houndsto catch us out in the open in the dark. We’ll make a small fire and maybe I cansee if the book will tell us anything useful.”“You know about the pillars of Creation, then?” Friedrich asked, following afterthe three of them as they started off down the trail.“Yes,” Lord Rahl said back over his shoulder in a troubled tone. “I’ve heard ofthem. Nathan came from the Old World, so I guess he would know about them, too.”Friedrich scratched his jaw in confusion as they crested a small rise in thetrail. “What do the pillars of Creation have to do with the Old World?”“The Pillars of Creation are in the center of a forsaken wasteland.” Lord Rahlpointed ahead, to the south. “It’s not all that far from here, off that way. Wewent past there not long ago. We had to cross the fringes of the place; somevery unpleasant people were after us.”“Their bloody bones are drying in the wasteland,” Cara said with obviouspleasure.“Unfortunately,” Lord Rahl said, “it cost us our horses, too; that’s why we’reon foot. At least we escaped with our lives.”“Wasteland ... but, Lord Rahl, the pillars of Creation are also what my wifecalled-”Friedrich halted when something beside the path caught his eye. Even in the dimlight, the hauntingly familiar dark shape silhouetted against the light color ofthe dusty trail drew him up short.He squatted down to touch it. To his surprise, it felt like what he thought.When he picked it up, he was sure of it. It had the same crooked opening for thedrawstring, the same notch in the supple leather where he had once accidentallynicked it with a sharp gouge when he had been in a hurry.“What’s the matter?” Lord Rahl asked in a suspicious voice as he scanned thenear-dark landscape. “Why did you stop?”“What did you find?” the Mother Confessor asked. “I didn’t see anything therewhen I walked past.”“Neither did I,” Lord Rahl said.Friedrich swallowed as he placed the leather pouch in the palm of his hand. Itfelt like there were coins inside, and, by the weight, it felt like they weregold.“This is mine,” Friedrich whispered in stunned amazement. “How could it possiblybe here?”He couldn’t claim the gold was his, though it certainly could be, but he’dhandled the leather pouch nearly every day for decades. He used it to hold oneof his tools-a small gouge he used often.“What’s it doing here?” Cara asked as her gaze swept the surroundingcountryside. Her Agiel was gripped tightly in her fist.Friedrich stood, still staring at his tool pouch. “It was stolen by the man whoI believe caused the death of my wife.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 56Well, wasn’t that just something.Oba could hardly believe that he had dropped his money purse. He was always socareful. He huffed in exasperation. If it wasn’t one thing, it was another.Either it was a scheming little cutpurse, or some thieving woman, always afterhis money. Was that all that the small-minded little people cared about? Money?After all his troubles, all the envious covetous conniving people trying to getat his hard-earned fortune, Oba had learned that a man of his standing had toalways be careful. He could hardly believe that, this time, he had done it tohimself.He hurriedly checked his pockets, inside his shirt, down in his trousers. Allhis pouches full of his considerable wealth were there, right where theybelonged. He supposed that the one out on the path might not be his, but whatwere the odds that someone else would drop a purse right there?When he checked the top of his boots, he found that one of his money purses wasmissing. Fuming, Oba checked the leather thong he always kept tied around hisankle, and found it had come untied.Someone had untied his money purse.He peered out through the trees, watching the touching scene. His brother,Richard, and his precious wife turned to the man who had found the purse-Oba’spurse, full of his money.“It was stolen by the man who I believe caused the death of my wife.” Oba heardthe man exclaim.Oba’s jaw dropped. It was the husband of the swamp-witch-the obnoxious selfishsorceress who wouldn’t answer Oba’s questions.Oba knew better than to think that this could all be some comical coincidence.He just flat knew better.“Don’t touch it!” Richard Rahl and the Mother Confessor yelled at the same time.“Run!” the other woman yelled.Oba watched them bolt like frightened deer. He realized that the voice was up tosomething. He knew that the voice used what belonged to people to reach out tothem. Oba looked to each side, to the glowing yellow eyes watching with him, andgrinned.The very air shook as if the ground right there where the money purse hit hadbeen struck by lightning. The hounds whined and backed away. Oba plugged eachear with a finger and squinted as he watched the violet concussion spreadoutward in a circle like the rings in a pond when he threw in a dead animal.In a brutal instant, quicker than thought, the people were flattened as the ringof violet light raced outward faster than his eye could follow. Oba’s hair wasblown back as the undulating circle swept past him. In its wake the ground wasleft covered with a still, cottony bed of eerie violet smoke.Oba’s suspicions had been proven right; the voice was planning something grand.He wondered with delight what it could be.The scene had gone still, but Oba watched for a time to be sure the four peoplewouldn’t get up. Only after he was confident that it was safe did he finallyrise up from his secret watching place, the place where the voice had told himto wait.The voice urged him on, now. The hounds stayed well behind, watching, as Obahurried across the smoke-covered ground. It was the strangest smoke he had everseen-a softly glowing bluish violet, but most odd of all, it didn’t swirl as Obaran through it. His legs passed through the still vapor without causing it tostir, as if it were in another world altogether and he wasn’t there with it, butjust walking in the same place in this world.The four lay sprawled on the ground right where they had fallen. Oba cautiouslyleaned closer, while trying to stay at a safe distance, and found them allbreathing, if slowly. Their eyes weren’t closed. He wondered if they could seehim. When he waved his arms, none of the four reacted. Oba bent over RichardRahl, peering into his still face. He waved a hand low, right before hisbrother’s unblinking eyes. There was no response.It was hard to see in the starlight, but Oba was sure he could make out in thoseeyes a bit of the fascinating family resemblance. It was a spooky feeling seeinga man who had a trace of similarity in his looks. Oba looked more like hismother, though. That would be just like her to want him to look more like herthan his father. The woman was completely self-centered. She had tried to denyhim his rightful place at every turn, even in his looks. The selfish bitch.But Richard was the man cheating Oba from his rightful place, now, the placetheir father would have wanted Oba to have. After all, Oba and Darken Rahlshared special qualities that Oba was sure his brother didn’t have.A check showed that the old husband of the swamp-witch was breathing, too. Obarecovered his money purse from nearby and shook it over the man’s staring eyes,but he, too, showed no response. Oba tied the purse back around his ankle, nowthat the voice was finished with it.Oba wasn’t thrilled about the voice using his money for such tricks, but withall the voice had done for him, making him invincible and all, he guessed hecouldn’t begrudge a favor now and again. As long as it didn’t became a habit.The woman with them had a single long braid lying out across the grassy ground.She wore one of those strange rods on a chain around her wrist. He realized thatshe was a Mord-Sith. He squeezed her breasts. She didn’t react. He grinned as helingered at doing it again. With her so willing, and all, he considered whatelse he might do. The idea was startlingly arousing.Oba realized, then, there was someone handy who was even better than aMord-Sith. He peered over at her. His brother’s wife, the woman they called theMother Confessor, was lying there close by for the taking. What better justicethan to have her?Oba crawled over to her, his grin fading with awed reverence when he saw howbeautiful she was. She lay on her back, one arm thrown out to the side, herfingers open and slack, as if pointing the way south. Her other arm lay casuallyacross her stomach. Her eyes, too, stared up at nothing.Oba carefully reached out and ran the back of a finger down her cheek. It was assoft as the silken petal of a rose. He pushed a long strand of hair back fromher face to better see her features. Her lips were slightly parted.Oba bent over her, putting his lips close to hers, running his hand up her body,feeling her luscious form. His hand glided up the mound of her breast. Hefondled it gently in his big hand, just to show her that he could be gentle. Hereached over and squeezed her other breast, but still she refused to acknowledgehow excited she was by his gentle, tantalizing touch.Quick as a fox, Oba blew in her parted mouth. She didn’t react at all. Hesuspected that she was playing a game with him, teasing him. The haughty bitch.She was going nowhere, now. She could not run, now. The voice had apparentlygiven him a gift. Oba threw his head back and laughed at the sky. As the houndsfar back in the shadows watched, he howled his delight at the stars.Smiling, Oba bent back over Lord Rahl’s wife, staring into her eyes. She wasprobably by now bored with her Lord Rahl husband, and was ready for anadventuresome romp. The more Oba thought about it, the more he realized thatthis woman should be his. She belonged to the Lord Rahl. By all rights, Obashould keep her as his wife when he became the new Lord Rahl.And, he would be the Lord Rahl; the voice had told him that such things werewithin his reach.Oba gazed at the sweep of her features, the curve of her body. He wanted hiswoman. He’d been doing favors for the voice, and hadn’t had time to be with awoman for ages. The voice had been prodding him ever onward at a breakneck pace.It was about time Oba had the pleasure of a woman. His hand roamed lightly overthe Mother Confessor’s body as he contemplated the satisfaction to come.But he didn’t like the others watching him. They all refused to close their eyesand give him and the lady some privacy. Busybodies-all of them. Oba grinned. Hesupposed it might be a thrill to have her husband watch his wife’s new master.The grin faded. What business was it of Richard’s if she wanted a new man-abetter man?Oba bent over his brother and pushed his eyelids closed. He did the same for theold man. He paused, deciding to let the other woman watch. It would undoubtedlyarouse her to see Oba in action. Such arousal was a small favor, but Oba wasinclined to do such favors for attractive women.Trembling with anticipation, knowing he could grant her the thrill he knew shecraved, Oba bent to rip open the Mother Confessor’s clothes. Before his fingerscould touch her, a violent flash of violet light threw him back. Oba sat up,stunned, confused, pressing his hands to the nerveshredding agony shriekingthrough his head. The voice was crushing his mind with punishing pain.Oba shoved at the ground with his feet, backing away from the Mother Confessor,and at last the pain eased. He sagged, panting with exhaustion after the briefbout. He felt downhearted that the voice would punish him so, dejected that thevoice would be so cruel as to deny him so simple a pleasure, and after all thegood things he had done.The voice changed, then, cooing to him, whispering about the important callingit had for him-important works that only Oba was qualified to do. Through hismelancholy, Oba listened.Oba was important, or the voice would not rely on him. Who else but Oba couldaccomplish such things as the voice asked of him? Who else could the voicedepend on to set things right?Now, in the silence of the still night, the voice made clear what it was Oba wasto do. If he did as he was asked, then there would be rewards. Oba grinned atthe pledges. First, he had to do the favor; then the Mother Confessor would behis. That wasn’t so hard. Once she was his, he could do with her whatever hewanted, with the voice’s blessing, and no one would interfere. Pictures ofit-along with the smells, the feel, the cries of her pleasure---came into hismind, and he nearly fainted with the promise of such rapture. Oba could wait foran encounter such as this would be.He glanced over at the Mord-Sith. She could provide him some entertainment inthe meantime. A man such as he, a man of action, great intellect, and heavyresponsibilities, had to have a release of his pent-up tensions. Such diversionswere a necessary outlet for a man of Oba’s importance.He bent over the Mord-Sith, grinning into her open eyes. She was to be honoredto be the first to have him. The Mother Confessor would have to wait her turn.He reached out to pull off her clothes.Oba’s head suddenly flared with howling, blinding agony. He pressed his hands tohis ears until it stopped-after he agreed.The voice was right. Of course it was; he could see that, now. Only when RichardRahl was dead could Oba take his rightful place. That made sense. It would bebest to do things right. In fact, it would be wrong to bring pleasure to thesewomen before he had done what needed doing.What had he been thinking? They didn’t deserve him, yet. They should first seehim as the important man he was shortly to become, and then they would have tobeg to have him. They didn’t deserve him until they begged.He had to be quick. The voice said they would wake soon-that Lord Rahl wouldsoon figure out how to break the spell of sleep.Oba pulled his knife and crawled to his brother. Lord Rahl was still staringdumbly at the stars.“Who’s the big oaf, now?” he asked his brother.Lord Rahl had no answer. Oba put the knife to Richard’s throat, but the voicewarned him back, and filled his mind instead with what he must do. He had to doit right. He had to hurry. There was no time for such common retribution. Therewere much better ways to do such things, ways that would punish the man for allthe years he had kept Oba from his rightful place. Yes, that was what RichardRahl needed: proper punishment.Oba put his knife away and ran back over the nearby hill as fast as his legswould carry him. When he returned with his horse, the four were still lyingthere in the blue fog, staring up at the stars.Oba did as the voice asked, and scooped up the Mother Confessor in his arms. Shehad now been promised to him. He would have her when the voice was doneborrowing her. Oba could wait. The voice had promised him delights that Obawould never have dreamed up on his own. This was turning out to be a verybeneficial partnership. For the paltry work involved, and the small delay, Obawould have everything that rightfully belonged to him: the rule of D’Hara andthe woman who would be his queen.Queen. Oba puzzled at that as he heaved her body over the back of the saddle.Queen. If she was a queen, then he would have to be a king. He supposed thatwould be better than “Lord” Rahl. King Oba Rahl. Yes, that made better sense. Heworked quickly to lash her down.Before he mounted up, Oba peered down at his brother. He couldn’t kill him. Notyet. The voice had plans. If Oba was anything, he had always been accommodating;he would oblige the voice. He put a foot in the stirrup. The voice tickled athim. He turned back, looking.He wondered ...He cautiously returned to Richard’s side. Carefully, Oba reached out andexperimentally touched the sword. The voice murmured indulgently.A king should have a proper sword. Oba grinned. He deserved a small reward forall his hard work.He pulled the baldric off over Richard Rahl’s head. He lifted the scabbardclose, inspecting his gleaming new sword. The wire-wound hilt had a word woveninto each side.“TRUTH”Well, wasn’t that just something.He lifted the baldric over his head and placed the scabbard at his hip. Hepatted his new wife’s bottom before he mounted up. From the saddle, Oba grinnedout at the night. He circled his horse around until the voice pointed him in theright direction.Hurry, hurry, before Lord Rahl woke. Hurry, hurry, before he could be caught.Hurry, hurry, away with his new bride.He thumped his heels to the horse’s ribs and off they charged. The houndsbounded out of the woods, a king’s faithful escort."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 57Standing outside the squat buildings made of sun-dried bricks, Jennsen idlysurveyed the barren landscape broiling under a brutally blue sky. The rocks, theseemingly endless expanse of flat hardpan to her right, and the rugged range ofmountains plummeting into the shimmering valley in the distance to her left,were all stained with variations of the same ruddy gray color as the sparsecollection of square structures huddled nearby.The bone-dry air was so hot that it reminded her of nothing so much as bendingover a bonfire and trying to breathe. Blistering heat radiated from the rocksand buildings around her and rose from the ground beneath her feet as if therewere a blast furnace below. Using bare hands to touch anything baking under theruthless sun was a painful experience. Even the hilt of her knife, shaded by herbody, was so warm that it felt feverish.Jennsen leaned a hip wearily against a low wall, nearly numb from the long anddifficult journey. She patted Rusty’s neck and then stroked an ear when thehorse neighed gently and put her head close. At least Jennsen was nearly at herjourney’s end. She felt as if she had lost sight of how it had all begun thatday so long ago when she had found the dead soldier at the bottom of the ravineand Sebastian had happened by.What a long and tortured journey fate would deal her, she could never haveguessed that day. She hardly knew herself anymore. Back then, she could neverhave guessed how much her life would change, or how much she would change.Sebastian, pulling Pete behind, reached out and gripped her arm. “You all right,Jenn?” Pete nudged Rusty’s flanks, as if to ask the same question of the mare.“Yes,” Jennsen said. She smiled for him and then gestured to the knot ofblack-robed men in the doorway of a nearby building. “Any luck?”“He’s asking the others.” Sebastian sighed in annoyance. “They’re a strangepeople.”Despite being part of the Old World, and a part of the domain of the ImperialOrder, the traders who traveled the vast deserted land, sometimes using thedesolate trading outpost where Sebastian had found them, were an independentlot. Apparently, there were not enough of them to worry about, so the Orderdidn’t bother.Sebastian leaned against the wall beside her as he gazed out at the silentwasteland. He was weary, too, from the long journey back to his homeland of theOld World. But at least he was well, now, just as Sister Perdita had promised.The journey, though, had been nothing like what Jennsen had thought it would be.She had imagined that she and Sebastian would be off on their own again, as theyhad been before traveling to the army of the Imperial Order. But behind themstretched a column of Imperial Order soldiers a thousand strong. A small escort,Sebastian had called them. She had told him that she wanted to go alone, but hesaid that there were more important considerations.With a thumbnail, Jennsen idly picked at the leather reins while watching thefigures in black. “The men are afraid of all the soldiers,” she told Sebastian.“That’s why they don’t want to talk to us.”“What makes you think so?”“I can just tell by the way they keep peeking out. They’re trying to decide iftelling us anything will somehow get them in trouble with all the soldiers.”She understood the way the small band of traders felt to be under the scrutinyof so many brutish men sitting up on their big cavalry horses how it felt to bewatched by such grim soldiers layered with leather and chain-mail armor andbristling with weapons. The black-robed men, with their pack mules, weretraders, not soldiers, nor were they used to dealing with soldiers. They fearedfor their safety, feared that if they said something wrong these warriors mightdecide to slaughter them out here in this wasteland. At the same time, whilevastly outnumbered, the traders seemed reluctant to be cowed, lest they set aprecedent for how they were treated thereafter. They were debating, now, tryingto figure out the balance where their safety lay.Sebastian pushed away from the wall. “Maybe you’re right. I’ll go in and talk tothem alone-in their building, instead of out here under the eyes of the army.”“I’ll go with you,” she said.“What is it? What do you think?” Sister Perdita asked Sebastian as she marchedup from behind.With a casual flip of his hand, Sebastian dismissed her concern. “I think theyjust want to bargain. They’re traders. That’s what they do, bargain. It might becounterproductive to try to force them.”“I will go in and change their minds,” the Sister said with dark intent.“No,” Sebastian said. “Now is not the time to complicate a simple matter. We canalways apply more pressure if we need to. Just let Jennsen and me go in and talkto them, first.”Jennsen walked away from a scowling Sister Perdita, sticking close toSebastian’s side, pulling Rusty along behind. The other thing about the journeythat had been unexpected-in addition to the escort of the thousand troops-hadbeen that Sister Perdita had decided to come along. She said that it wasnecessary, in case Jennsen needed any more help in getting close to Lord Rahl.Jennsen just wanted to plunge her knife into that murderous bastard son ofDarken Rahl and be done with it all. She had long since given up any hope of itfreeing her to have her own life. After that night in the woods with SisterPerdita and the seven other Sisters, everything had changed. Jennsen had made abargain that she knew would mean she would have no life after she finally killedRichard Rahl. But at least everyone else would have their lives back. The worldwould at last be free of her half brother and his evil rule.And she would have vengeance. Her mother, who had been denied even a properburial, could at last rest in peace knowing that her murderer had finally beenvisited with justice. That was all Jennsen could do for her mother.Jennsen and Sebastian led Rusty and Pete to where the Sister’s horse waswaiting, in a small side paddock. Rusty and Pete welcomed the shade and thewater trough.After closing the small rickety gate to the paddock, Jennsen followed Sebastianinto the shadow of the doorway of the squat building. The jabbering voices ofthe men echoing inside the single room fell silent. All the men were swathed inthe traditional black robes of the nomadic traders who lived in this part of theworld.“Leave us, then,” the lead man said, waving his fellows out at seeing Sebastianand Jennsen enter.The men, their eyes peering out at her from gaps in the black cloth they werepulling back up across their mouths and noses, nodded as they filed by. By theircrinkled exposed eyes, the men seemed to be smiling congenially at her frombeneath the masks, but she couldn’t be sure. Just in case, and considering whatwas at stake, she smiled back as she returned a bow of her head.The stagnant air inside the room was sweltering, but at least the shade was arelief. The one man remaining inside hadn’t pulled the loose wraps of blackcloth back up, so they sagged around his neck, away from his smiling, weathered,leathery face.“Please,” he said to Jennsen, “come in. You look fiery.”“Fiery?” she asked.“Hot,” he said. “You are not dressed for this place.” He shuffled over to therough plank shelves at the side and returned with one of the black bundlesstored there. “Please to wear this.” He lifted it toward her several times,urging her to take it. “It will make you better. It will cover you from the sunand hold in your sweat so you don’t dry like rock.”Jennsen again bowed her head toward the small wiry man and smiled herappreciation. “Thank you.”“Well?” Sebastian asked when the man turned away from Jennsen. Sebastian wearilypulled his pack off his back. “Any luck finding out anything from those othermen?”The black-robed figure hesitated, clearing his throat. “Well, they say thatmaybe . . .”Sebastian impatiently rolled his eyes when he caught the man’s veiled meaning,and then fished around in his pocket until he came up with a silver coin.“Please accept this gesture of my appreciation for the efforts of your men.”The man took it respectfully, but it was clear the silver coin was not the pricehe was hoping for. He seemed hesitant, though, to say that he found the amountinadequate. Jennsen couldn’t believe that Sebastian was quibbling about money ata time like this. She pulled a heavy gold coin from her pocket and, withoutbothering to ask Sebastian if it was all right, simply flipped it to the man.The man caught the gold in midair, then opened his fist just enough for a peekof confirmation. He grinned his appreciation at her. Sebastian shot her a lookof displeasure.It was Lord Rahl’s blood money, the money he had given the men sent to kill herand her mother. She could think of no better use for it.“I don’t need it,” she said before he could lecture her. “Besides, aren’t youthe one who said it was your way to use what was close to the enemy to get backat him?”Sebastian withheld any comment and turned to the man. “What about it?”“Late yesterday,” the man said, finally more forthcoming, “some of our menspotted two people going down into the Pillars of Creation.” He went to a small,uncovered window beside shelves stocked with simple supplies along with more ofthe black outfits. He pointed. “Down that way. There is a trail of sorts.”“Did your men talk to them?” Jennsen asked, stepping forward impatiently. “Doyour men know who it was?”The man looked from her to Sebastian, hesitating, apparently not comfortableanswering such direct questions from a woman, even if she had been the one whohad paid his price. Sebastian gave her a look that said she should let himhandle it. Jennsen stepped back toward the doorway, peering out, actingdisinterested so that Sebastian could get the answers they needed. Jennsen’sheart hammered as she pictured in her mind stabbing Lord Rahl. The shadow of theawful price of luring her brother to this place where she was to kill him loomedover the scene in her mind of the act itself.Sebastian wiped sweat from his brow and tossed his heavy pack to the side of thefloor. The pack hit with a hard clank and fell over. Some of the things spilledout. Annoyed,he made to pick it up, but Jennsen intercepted him.“I’ll tend to this,” she whispered,waving him back to the questioning of thesmall fellow in black.Sebastian leaned against the heavy, ancient-looking plank table and folded hisarms. “So, did your men have a chance to talk to these two people?”“No, sir. The men were not close enough, but stood at the rim and watched thehorse pass below.”Jennsen retrieved a cake of lye soap and replaced it in the pack. She folded therazor and put it back in, along with an extra waterskin that had tumbled out.She picked up small items-a flint, strips of dried meat wrapped in cloth, and awhetstone. A tin she had never seen before had rolled out of the pack and undera low shelf.“What did these two people on horseback look like, then?” Sebastian was askingas he tapped a finger on the table.As she reached under the shelf, Jennsen listened carefully, waiting to hear ifthis might be Richard Rahl. She couldn’t really imagine who else it could be.She didn’t believe such a thing could be coincidence.“It was a man and a woman. But they came on only one horse.”Jennsen thought that was strange, that both would be riding one horse. Itsounded likely that it was what she expected, Lord Rahl and his wife, the MotherConfessor, but it was odd that they were on one horse. Something could havehappened to the other horse. In this dangerous land such a thing wasn’t hard toimagine.“The woman, she. . . “ The man made a face, uncomfortable with what he had tosay. “She was not upright, but lying flat”-he gestured as if draping somethingover the horse-”across the back. She was tied up with rope.”As Jennsen pulled the tin out in a rush of surprise, the lid caught a jaggededge of the wooden shelf and popped off. The contents spilled out across thefloor in front of her.“What did the man look like?” Sebastian asked.A short piece of wood wound with twine and fastened down with fishing hooks hadfallen out of the top of the tin. Jennsen stared down at a dark pile of driedmountain fever roses that had spilled out after the twine. They looked likedozens of little Graces.“The man was big, and young. He had a very grand sword, my men say, its shiningscabbard held on with a baldric across his shoulder.“That sounds like Richard Rahl, “ Sister Perdita said from the doorway,startling Jennsen.“Other men use a baldric for their sword,” Sebastian said.While she couldn’t fathom a reason for him to have his wife tied across hishorse, at the heady thought of Richard Rahl being spotted, Jennsen hurriedlyscooped up the dried mountain fever roses in her trembling fingers and stuffedthem back in the tin followed by the twine. She replaced the lid and quicklyshoved the tin back into the pack along with the few remaining items that hadfallen out.She checked her knife in its sheath at her belt as she hastily stood next toSebastian, waiting to hear what else the wiry man in black might have to say.Sister Perdita had stepped outside and was wrapping herself in the protectiveblack clothes.“Come on,” the Sister called. “We have to get down there.”Jennsen wanted to follow after her, but Sebastian was still questioning the man.She didn’t want to leave Sebastian and go alone with Sister Perdita, but thewoman was already heading off in the direction of the trail the man had pointedout.From outside, on the other side of the buildings, came the sound of the tradersjabbering excitedly. Jennsen peered around the side of the building and saw thempointing out across the flat, baked ground.“What is it?” Sebastian asked as he followed the man out the door.“Someone approaches,” the man said.“Who could it be?” Jennsen whispered to Sebastian as he came up beside her.“I don’t know. Could just be another trader arriving at the post.”The wiry little man, having answered the questions, bowed and wanted to departto be with his men where they huddled together in the shade beside anotherbuilding. Sebastian made him wait as he went back in and pulled a black bundleoff the shelf.“We best catch up with Sister Perdita,” he said as he watched the woman vanishover the rim of the trail down into the wavering landscape of the Pillars ofCreation. “She’ll protect you from Richard Rahl’s magic and help you do what youneed to do.”Jennsen wanted to say that she didn’t need Sister Perdita’s protection, thatLord Rahl’s magic couldn’t hurt her, but it was not the time to go into thewhole subject with him, to explain the whole thing to him. Somehow, it neverseemed the time. It didn’t really matter, anyway, what Sebastian believed abouthow she could get close to Richard Rahl, it only mattered that she did.Together, the two of them stood in the sweltering sun, watching the tiny speckracing across the endless flat landscape. In the withering heat, the distantground undulated like the rippling surface of a faraway lake. A thin plume ofdust rose behind the lone rider. Their escort of a thousand men restlesslychecked their weapons.“Is it one of your men?” Sebastian asked the wiry leader of the blackrobedfigures.“The ground here plays tricks with your eyes,” he said. “He is still far off;the heat only makes him look closer. It will be some time before the riderreaches us and we can tell who it is.” He smiled at Jennsen, gesturingencouragement. “Put the clothing on, and you will be covered from the sun.”Rather than argue, Jennsen threw the gauzy, capelike garment around hershoulders. She wrapped the long scarf over and around her head, as she had seenthe men doing, pulling it across her nose and mouth and then tucking the tailunder the side. She was immediately surprised at how the black cloth cut the hotglare of the sun. It felt a relief, almost like standing in shade.The man’s eyes smiled at seeing the look on her face. “Good, yes?” he askedthrough his own thin black mask.“Yes,” Jennsen said. “Thank you for your help. But we must pay you for thesethings you gave us.”With a twinkle in his eye, he said, “You already have.”The man turned to Sebastian, still pulling his black scarf over his head. “Ihave told you all I can, all we know. My men and I go, now.”Before Sebastian could answer, the man was already hurrying across the parchedground toward the dark knot of men waiting with their dusty mules. The menstarted away, pulling their mules after on lead lines, eager to be away from thesoldiers.They were headed south, in the opposite direction of the approaching rider.“If it might be one of their men,” Sebastian said, almost to himself, “then whyare they leaving?”He looked impatiently to the small trail where Sister Perdita had disappeared,and then signaled to his column of men still waiting on horseback. Thegrim-looking force of men advanced across the hard ground, raising a lazy fog ofdust.“We have to go down there,” Sebastian said as he gestured toward the valley thatheld the Pillars of Creation. “Wait up here until we get back.”The officer at the head of the column folded his wrists across the horn of hissaddle. “What do you want us to do about that?” he asked. His greasy strings ofhair fell forward over his shoulder as he pointed with his chin toward the yetdistant rider.Sebastian turned and watched the far-off horse galloping toward them. “If heturns out to be suspicious for any reason at all, kill him. This is tooimportant to risk trouble, now.”The officer gave Sebastian a single nod. Jennsen could see in the hungry eyesand humorless grins of the men behind him that they were pleased by the orders.“Let’s go,” Sebastian said. “I want to catch up with Sister Perdita before shegets too far ahead of us.”“Don’t worry,” Jennsen said, “I want Lord Rahl more than Sister Perdita does.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 58The heat had been withering up on the barren plain, but venturing down the trailfelt like descending into a blast furnace. Every breath drew the torrid air intoher lungs, making Jennsen feel as if she were being cooked from the inside, too.The air rising before the steep walls wavered like heat shimmering above a fire.There were places where the trail simply vanished crossing loose rock, orperhaps went under it. In other places, a depression had been worn into the softsandstone to show the way. In some places, the track went along naturalpathways, so it was largely self-evident, with little choice to make a mistake.Occasionally, they had to cross slides of scree that had buried any trace of atrail, and hope they could pick it up farther along. Jennsen knew enough abouttrails to know that this one was ancient and unused.Although nothing could make the scorching heat any less, the black garments thatthe traders had given them were at least an improvement. The black cloth aroundher eyes cut the painful glare, absorbing the bright light, making it easier tosee. It was a relief to have the dark cloth shading her face. Instead of makingher hotter, as she thought, the thin cloth covering the exposed skin of her armsand neck stopped the sun from burning her, and somehow seemed to keep some ofthe heat out.As she and Sebastian hurried to follow the trail ever downward, she soon found,to her dismay, that it led them up, again, over one of the fingers of ridgesthat extended down into the valley. The rocky ground was so rugged that it wouldbe difficult, if not impossible, to simply go right down, so the trail cutacross the ridges so it wouldn’t drop so precipitously. The trade-off was thatit made it necessary to descend the back side of one ridge only to have to climbthe face of the next. They had no choice but to follow it as it made a harrowingdescent, then rose again. The strain on the muscles of her thighs and shins wasfatiguing, but then to have to climb up again in such heat was agonizing.Jennsen remembered well that Sebastian had once told her that no one ever riskedgoing into the valley that held the Pillars of Creation. She could see why. Bythe unused nature of the trail, she knew that it was true-at least in this oneplace. She recalled, too, that he’d said that if anyone did go into the centralvalley, they had never returned to talk about it. She guessed that she didn’thave to worry about that.As they went lower, yawning fissures and deep cuts opened in the craggy terrain,giving rise to rock walls that stood alone, as if cast off and abandoned. Asthey moved along the edges of vast cliffs, some of the spires made up of thosesplits rose up from below almost to their height at the valley rim. Looking downon such soaring towers of rock was dizzying. There were places where she andSebastian were forced to make leaps across deep clefts. To see in places wherethey were going to have to follow the trail below was heart-stopping.Sister Perdita stood at the top of one of the prominent ridges along the trail’stortuous descent, waiting for them, watching them with silent displeasure setenduringly in the lines of her implacable face. The growing shadows cast acrossthe landscape added a strange new dimension to the place. The lowering sunhighlighted the rugged features in a way that only helped to make clear howformidable the land truly was. Sebastian put a hand to Jennsen’s back andhurried her along an open, level place in the trail as they moved in among theeerie rock columns that stood like imposing dead trunks of tree that had losttheir crowns and all their limbs.Ever since they’d left the traders, something had felt wrong to Jennsen, but asSebastian spurred her along, she couldn’t bring to mind precisely what it thatwas bothering her. Sister Perdita scowled as she waited.Jennsen checked that her knife was still there, as she had done countless timesbefore. She sometimes simply brushed her fingertips across the silver handle.This time, she lifted it to make sure it was clear in its sheath, then pressedit back down until it seated with the reassuring metallic click.The first time she had seen the knife, when she found the dead D’Haran soldier,she had thought it a remarkable weapon. She still thought so. That first time,seeing the ornate letter “R” had terrified her-with good reason-but now thetouch of the engraved handle reassured her, giving her hope that she could atlong last end the threat. This was the day she was finally about to accomplishwhat Sebastian had told her that first night. She was going to use somethingclose to her enemy to strike back.Sebastian had been through a difficult time, too, since that first night whenhe’d had to fight those men even though he had been stricken with a fever. Shecould never forget how brave he had been that day, and how he had fought,despite having a fever. Far worse than being stricken with fever, though, he hadbeen struck down by Adie’s sorceress magic and nearly killed. Jennsen wasthankful that he had recovered, and that he was well, and that he would have alife, even if it was to be without her.“Sebastian . . .” she said, suddenly realizing that she had never said hergood-bye to him. She didn’t want to say it in front of Sister Perdita. Shehalted, turning back, pulling the black scarf away from her mouth. “Sebastian, Ijust want to thank you for all you’ve done to help me.”He laughed a little through the mask of black fabric. “Jenn, you sound likeyou’re about to die.”How could she tell him that she was?“We can’t know what will happen.”“Don’t worry,” he said, cheerfully. “You’ll be fine. The Sisters helped you withtheir magic while they were healing me, and now Sister Perdita will be therewith you. I’ll be there, too. You’ll at last avenge your mother. “He didn’t know what price the Sisters had placed on their help, and onvengeance. Jennsen couldn’t bear to tell him, but she had to find a way to saysomething.“Sebastian, if anything happens to me-”“Jenn,” he said, taking hold of her arms, looking into her eyes, “don’t talklike that.” He turned suddenly morose. “Jenn, don’t say such a thing. I couldn’tstand the thought of life without you. I love you. Only you. You don’t know whatyou mean to me, how you’ve made my life different than I ever thought it wouldbe-so much better than I ever thought life could be. I couldn’t go on withoutyou. I couldn’t ever again endure life without you. You make the world right forme as long as I have you. I’m hopelessly, helplessly in love with you. Pleasedon’t torture me with the thought of ever being without you.”Jennsen stared into his blue eyes, blue like her murdering father’s eyes weresaid to have been, and she was unable to bring forth any words to explain, tosay how she felt, to tell him that she was going to be taken from him and hewould have to face life alone. She knew how awful it was to feel alone. Shesimply nodded as she turned back to the trail and veiled the black scarf backacross her face.“Hurry,” she said, “Sister Perdita is waiting.”The woman scowled at Jennsen through her own dark mask as she stood waiting inthe wind atop a broad flat rock. Jennsen could see that the trail beyond theSister descended steeply among the shadows, down into the very Pillars ofCreation. As they approached, Jennsen realized that Sister Perdita wasn’tfrowning at her, but looking past her, staring back the way they had come.Before they reached her, up on the flat rock where her black robes lifted in thesweltering gusts, they, too, turned to see what she was watching so intently.Jennsen could see, from their high vantage point, that in their efforts they hadreached the top of a divide in the trail from where it dropped rapidly down,following the side of the ridge, to take them to the bottom. But looking backacross the wide gorges and rocky ridges they had already crossed, she saw thatthey were almost as high again as the valley rim. There, she could see the smallcluster of squat buildings, looking tiny in the distance.The rider was almost there, charging in on his horse, following anarrow-straight route toward the trail. The company of a thousand men hadgathered in a thick line not far from the trailhead, waiting for him. Dust rosein a long plume behind the galloping horse.As the lathered animal raced in at full speed, before it reached the men,Jennsen detected a falter in its gait. The horse’s front legs abruptly crumpled.The poor beast went down, crashing to the rocky ground, dead from exhaustion.The man atop the horse smoothly stepped off the animal as it collapsed to theground. Without seeming to lose momentum or stride, he continued to advancetoward the trail. He was dressed in dark clothes, although not like those of thenomadic traders. A golden-colored cape billowed behind him. And, he appeared tobe a lot bigger than the traders.As he made straight for the trail, the commander of the cavalry cried out forthe man to halt. He didn’t challenge them, or seem to even say a word. He simplyignored them as he marched resolutely past the buildings on his way to thetrailhead. The thousand men raised a shrill battle cry and charged.The poor man brandished no weapon, made no threating move toward the soldiers.As the Order cavalry raced down on him, he lifted an arm toward them, as ifwarning them to halt. Jennsen knew, from both Sebastian’s orders and from theway they charged toward the lone man, that they had no intention of stopping foranything short of his head.Jennsen watched with dread as a man was about to be killed, watched, spellbound,as the thousand men crashed in toward him.The valley rim abruptly lit with a thunderous explosion. Despite the dark headwrap, Jennsen shielded her eyes as she gasped in surprise. The violent rope oflightning and its terrible counterpart had twined together-a blazing white-hotbolt of lightning twisted together with a crackling black line that looked to bea void in the world itself, terrible power joined and discharged in an explosiveinstant.In the space of a heartbeat, it seemed as if all the glaring brightness of thebarren plain, the fierce heat of the Pillars of Creation, had been gathered at asingle point and unleashed. In an instant, the ignition of that explosivelightning annihilated the force of a thousand in a brilliantly lit red cloud.When the blinding light, the thunderous roar, the violent concussion weresuddenly gone, so were the thousand men-all of them leveled.Among the smoking remains of horse and man, the lone man marched ever onwardtoward the trail, appearing not to have lost a step.In that man’s determined movement, even more than in the way he had loosedhavoc, Jennsen saw the true depths of his terrible rage.“Dear spirits,” Jennsen whispered. “What just happened?”“Salvation comes only through self-sacrifice,” Sister Perdita said. “Those mendied in service to the Order and thus the Creator. That is the Creator’s highestcalling. No need to mourn for them-they have gained salvation through loyalduty.”Jennsen could only stare at her.“Who is that?” Sebastian asked as he watched the lone man reach the rim of thevalley of the Pillars of Creation and start down without pause. “Do you have anyideas?”“It isn’t important.” Sister Perdita turned back to the trail. “We have amission.”“Then we had better hurry,” Sebastian said in a worried tone as he stared backat the distant figure advancing down the trail at a swift, measured, relentlesspace."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 59Jennsen and Sebastian rushed to follow after Sister Perdita, who had disappearedover the top of the ridge. As they reached the edge, they saw her, already farbelow them. Jennsen looked back, in the direction of the trailhead, but didn’tsee the lone man. She did see, though, that a bank of dark clouds had rolled inover the expanse of barren plains.“Hurry!” Sister Perdita called back up to them.With Sebastian’s hand at the small of her back, urging her on, Jennsen dasheddown the steep trail. The Sister moved as swiftly as the wind, the black robesflying out behind her as she raced along a trail cut into the slope of steeprock. Jennsen had never worked so hard to keep up with anyone. She suspectedthat the woman was using magic to aid her.Whenever Jennsen started to lose her footing on the loose scree and reached outfor support, the rough rock rasped the skin on her fingers and the palms of herhands. The trail was as arduous as any she had ever climbed down. Loose rockatop layers of solid ledge constantly slipped and gave way underfoot, and sheknew that if she grabbed the wrong handhold, the rock, in many places as sharpas shattered glass, would slice her hands open.Jennsen was soon panting and trying to catch her breath, as well as the distantSister. Sebastian, right behind, sounded just as winded. He, too, lost hisfooting a number of times and, once, Jennsen cried out and grabbed his arm justbefore he went over the edge of a precipitous drop of thousands of feet.The look in his eyes expressed the relief that he was too winded to voice.Finding herself closer to the bottom, after a seen-tingly unending, arduousdescent, Jennsen was at least relieved to note that the walls and towers wereblocking the broiling sunlight. She glanced up at the sky, something she hadn’thad the luxury to do for quite a while, and realized that it wasn’t just theshadows cast by rock darkening the day. The sky, that only hours before had beenso clear and bright blue, was now roofed with churning gray clouds, as if theentire valley of the Pillars of Creation were being sealed off from the rest ofthe world.She forged onward, rushing to keep up with Sister Perdita. There was no time toworry about clouds. As exhausted as Jennsen was, she knew that when the timecame, she would find the strength to plunge her knife into Richard Rahl. Thattime was almost at hand. She knew that her mother, with the good spirits, wouldinspire her and thus help give her the strength. She knew, too, that otherstrength had been promised.Rather than filling her with dread, knowing that the end of her life was soclose left Jennsen with an odd, numb sense of calm. It seemed almost sweet, thatpromise of the end of struggle, the end of fear, the end of needing to careabout anything. Soon, there would be no exhaustion, no insufferable heat, nopain, no sorrow, no anguish.At the same time, when, for only an instant here or a moment there, she actuallycomprehended the staggering reality that she was about to die, her mind blankedout with overwhelming terror. It was her life, her only precious life, that wasinexorably dwindling away, that would soon end with the cold embrace of deathitself.Flickering lightning skipped across a darkening sky, traveling under the clouds.Distant, intense flashes came again, lacing though the heavy clouds, lightingthem from within with spectacular green light. Distant thunder boomed, rumblingout across the vast deserted valley. The hesitant rolling sound of the thunderseemed to match the way the landscape wavered in the heat.As they descended, the towering rock columns became larger, at first growing upfrom splits along the ridges, until down at the bottom they seemed rooted in thefloor of the valley itself. Now, as the three of them moved at last ever fartheraway from the cliffs and out into the valley, those columns rose up like anancient stone forest. Jennsen felt like an ant moving among them.As their footsteps echoed among the rock walls, chambers, and tiers, shecouldn’t help marveling at the smooth, rippled sides of the pillars, that lookedas if the rock had been worn smooth, like stones in a river. Different layerswithin the vertical rock appeared to be of varying density, making them wear atdifferent rates, leaving the stone towers rippled up along their entire length.In places, huge sections of the columns perched atop narrow necks.All the while, the heat felt like a great weight pressing down on her as herfeet dragged through the jagged gravel at the bottom. The light among thecolumns cast eerie shadows, leaving dark places lurking farther back in amongthe towers. In other places, light seemed to come from behind the stone. As shelooked up, it was like looking up from the depths of the world, seeing the rockitself, lit green at times by the flickering lightning within the clouds, reachup as if beseeching salvation.Sister Perdita glided among the maze of rock, like a spirit of the dead, herblack robes billowing out behind. Even Sebastian’s presence behind was not acomfort for Jennsen among such silent sentinels to the power of Creation itself.Lightning arced across above their heads, above the tops of towering rock, as ifsearching the forest of stone. Thunder shook the valley with violent shuddersthat brought crumbling rock down on them so that they had to run or dodge to theside to avoid being stoned. Jennsen saw, here and there, where some of theenormous pillars had previously come crashing down. They lay toppled, now, likefallen giants. In places they had to pass beneath the monumental stone lyingacross the path, walking through passages left where the colossal pieces spannedweathered gaps. She hoped the lightning that was streaking all across the skydidn’t decide to hit a stone pillar right above them and send unimaginableweight crashing down on them.Just when Jennsen thought that they would be forever lost in among the tightspaces among soaring rock, she saw an opening between the towers that revealedthe expanse of the rest of the valley floor. Winding their way along the bottom,among the crowded stone columns, they began to wend their way out into more openground, where the pillars stood as individual monuments rather than beingtightly crammed together.Down at the bottom, the valley, that had looked so flat from above, was a jumbleof rolling low rock and scree, cut through with jagged rock formations andlifted slabs of smooth stone that ran for miles. Out from the fingers oftapering ridges coming in from the sides stood lofty pillars both separated, andin small clusters.The thunder was becoming unnerving as it boomed and shuddered and rumbled almostcontinually through the forest of stone. The sky had lowered until the boilingclouds brushed along the surrounding walls of rock. Off at the far end of thevalley, the darkest clouds threw out almost constant flickers and flashes, somestartlingly bright, spawning jarring thunderclaps.Coming past a broad stone spire, Jennsen was startled to see a wagon in thedistance making its way across the valley floor.Jennsen turned to tell Sebastian about the wagon, and there, behind them,towered the stranger.Her gaze took in his black shirt, his black, open-sided tunic decorated withancient symbols snaking along a wide gold band running all the way around itssquared edges. The tunic was cinched at his waist with a wide, multilayeredleather belt with leather pouches attached along each side. The small,gold-worked leather compartments on the belt bore silver emblems of linkedrings, matching those on wide, leather-padded silver bands at each wrist. Histrousers and boots were black. In contrast, his broad shoulders bore a cape thatappeared to be made of spun gold. He had no weapon but a belt knife, but heneeded none to be the embodiment of threat itself.Looking into his gray eyes, Jennsen knew instantly and unequivocally that shewas staring into the raptor gaze of Richard Rahl.It felt as if a fist of fear seized her heart, and squeezed. Jennsen pulled herknife free. She clutched it so tightly that her knuckles were white around thesilver hilt. She could feel the ornately engraved letter “R,” for the House ofRahl, biting into her palm and fingers as the Lord Rahl himself stood rightthere before her.Sebastian spun around and saw him, then moved around behind her.Her emotions in a jumble, Jennsen stood paralyzed before her brother.“Jenn,” Sebastian whispered from behind, “don’t worry. You can do this. Yourmother is watching. Don’t let her down.”Richard Rahl scrutinized her, not seeming to notice Sebastian, or even SisterPerdita, farther back. Jennsen stared at her brother, equally oblivious of theother two.“Where is Kahlan?” Richard said.His voice was not what she expected. It was commanding, to be sure, but it wasso much more, so full of emotion, everything from cold fury, to unwaveringresolve, to desperation. His gray eyes, too, reflected the same sincere andterrible determination.Jennsen could not take her eyes from him. “Who is Kahlan?”“The Mother Confessor. My wife.”Jennsen could not move, so conflicted was she in what she was seeing, in whatshe was hearing. This was not a man looking for a monster cohort, a brutalConfessor who ruled the Midlands with an iron will and an evil hand. This was aman motivated by love for this woman. Jennsen could clearly see that little elsemattered to him. If they did not get out of his way, he would go through themlike he went through those thousand men. It was as simple as that.Except, unlike those thousand men, Jennsen was invincible.“Where is Kahlan?” Richard repeated, his patience at an end.“You killed my mother,” Jennsen said, almost defensively.His brow twitched. He seemed truly puzzled. “I only just learned that I have asister. Friedrich Gilder just told me, and that your name is Jennsen.”Jennsen realized she was nodding, unable to take her eyes off his, seeing herown eyes in his.“Kill him, Jenn!” Sebastian whispered urgently in her ear. “Kill him! You can doit. His magic can’t hurt you! Do it.”Jennsen felt a kind of tingling dread working its way up her legs. Something waswrong. Gripping the knife, she gathered her courage of purpose as the voicefilled her head, until there was no room for anything else.“The Lord Rahl has been trying to murder me my whole life. When you killed yourfather, you took his place. You sent men after me. You’ve hounded me just likeyour father. You sent the quads after us. You bastard, you sent those men whomurdered my mother!”Richard listened without argument, and then spoke in a calm, deliberate voice.“Don’t lay a cloak of guilt around my shoulders because others are evil.”Jennsen was jolted, realizing that was very close to the words her mother hadused the night before she died. “Don’t you ever wear a cloak of guilt becausethey are evil. “The muscles in his jaw flexed as he gritted his teeth. “What have you done withKahlan?”“She’s my queen, now!” came a voice echoing through the columns.Jennsen vaguely recognized the voice. As she looked around, she didn’t seeSister Perdita anywhere.Richard passed her, already moving toward the voice, like a shadow moving by,and then he was suddenly gone. She had missed her chance to stab him. Shecouldn’t believe that he had been standing right in front of her, and she hadmissed her chance.“Jenn!” Sebastian called, pulling at her arm. “What’s the matter with you? Comeon! You can still get him!”She didn’t know what was wrong. Something was. She pressed her hands to herhead, trying to stop the drone of the voice. She no longer could. She had made abargain, and the voice was mercilessly demanding that she hold to it, crushingher mind with pain unlike any she had ever suffered.When Jennsen heard laughter echoing through the forest of stone pillars, shemoved swiftly, the heat and her exhaustion forgotten. She and Sebastian rantoward the sound, weaving their way among the disorder of towering rock. She nolonger knew where she was, which way was which. She raced through stonepassageways that opened up to others, along their twisting course, underarchways of rock, among columns, and through shadows and light. It was likemoving through a strange and confusing combination of corridors and woods,except that these walls were stone, not plaster, and the trees were rock.As they came around an immense pillar, there, among others standing likesentinels, was an open area of undulating smooth rock in a jumble of curves,with smaller stone columns as thick around as ancient pines.A woman was tied to one of the columns.There was no doubt in Jennsen’s mind that this was Richard’s wife, Kahlan, theMother Confessor.Off in another direction came the echoing laughter, teasing, leading Richardaway from what he sought.The Mother Confessor didn’t look like the monster Jennsen had pictured. Shelooked in bad shape, limp in the ropes around the pillar. She was not boundsecurely, but simply, with rope around her middle, as a child might tie aplaymate to a tree.She was apparently unconscious, some of her long mass of hair pendent around herhanging head, her arms swinging free. She wore simple traveling clothes, thoughneither they nor the partial veil of hair hid what a beautiful woman she was.She looked only a few years older than Jennsen. She didn’t look like she wouldlive to be any older.Sister Perdita appeared suddenly beside the woman, lifting the MotherConfessor’s head by her hair, taking a look, then letting her head drop again.Sebastian ran up, pointing. “That’s her. Come on.”As Jennsen followed, she didn’t need the voice in her head to tell her that thiswas the bait that had been provided in order to draw Richard Rahl in for thekilling. The voice had done its part.Girding her resolve, gripping her knife tightly, Jennsen ran over beside theSister. She turned her back to the unconscious woman, not wanting to think abouther, or to have to look at her, putting her mind instead to the task at hand.This was her chance to finish it.The laughing man suddenly popped out from behind a pillar not far away, no doubtto help draw in the prey. Jennsen recognized his awful grin. It was the man shehad seen the night the sorceress Lathea had been murdered. It was the man thathad so frightened Betty, her goat. The man Jennsen thought she recognized fromher nightmares.“I see you have found my queen,” the nightmare man said.“What?” Sebastian asked.“My queen,” the man said, still with that terrible grin. “I am King Oba Rahl.She shall be my queen.”Jennsen recognized, then, that there was a small resemblance in the eyes toNathan Rahl, to Richard, to her. He didn’t have the strong likeness that Jennsensaw of herself in Richard’s eyes, but she saw enough to know that he was tellingthe truth-he, too, was the son of Darken Rahl.“Here he comes,” he said, turning, holding out an introductory arm, “my brother,the old Lord Rahl.”Richard strode out of the shadows.“Don’t be afraid, Jenn,” Sebastian whispered in her ear, “he can’t hurt you. Youcan get him, now.”Now was her chance; she would not again waste it.Off to the side, through the thicket of columns, she caught glimpses of a wagonrolling up. She thought she recognized the horses-both gray with black manes andtails. They were horses as big as any she’d ever seen. From the corner of hereye, she saw that the driver was big and blond-headed.Jennsen turned, staring in disbelief at the wagon when she heard Betty’sfamiliar bleat. The goat stood and put its front hooves up on the seat besidethe driver. The big blond man gave her ears a quick affectionate rub. It lookedlike Tom.“Jennsen,” Richard said, “step away from Kahlan.”“Don’t do it, sis!” Oba yelled. He roared with laughter.Knife in hand, Jennsen backed closer to the unconscious woman hanging from thepillar rising up behind. Richard would try to come through her to get at Kahlan;then Jennsen would have him.“Jennsen,” Richard said, “why would you side with a Sister of the Dark?”She shot a brief puzzled frown at Sister Perdita. “Sister of the Light,” shecorrected.Richard slowly shook his head as his gaze went beyond to Sister Perdita. “No.She is a Sister of the Dark. Jagang has Sisters of the Light, but he also hasthe others as well. They are both slaves to the dream walker; that’s why theyhave that ring through their lower lip.”Jennsen had heard that name before--dream walker. She frantically tried toremember where. She recalled, too, what the Sisters had invoked that night inthe woods. Everything was tumbling through her mind in a frantic rush. It wasn’thelping that the voice was there, incessantly urging her on. She was screaminginside with the need to kill this man, but something was keeping her frommoving. She knew it couldn’t be his magic.“You will have to come through Jennsen if you want to save Kahlan,” SisterPerdita said in her cool, disdainful voice. “You have run out of time, andoptions, Lord Rahl. You had better at least save your wife, before her time isup, as well.”Off in the distance to the side, Jennsen caught sight of the brown goat boundingthrough the forest of stone, outpacing Tom by a wide margin.“Betty?” Jennsen whispered through choking tears as she unwrapped the black veilfrom her head so the goat would recognize her.The goat bleated at the sound of her name, her little upright tail wagging in ablur as she ran. Something else, smaller, was coming from behind, back by Tom.Before the goat could reach her, it reached Oba. Spotting him as it came aroundthe pillar, Betty let out a plaintive cry and sidestepped away. Jennsen knewwell Betty’s cry of distress and terror, her plea for help and comfort.Overhead, the sky went wild with lightning and thunder, further frightening thepoor animal.“Betty?” Jennsen called, hardly able to believe what she was seeing, wonderingif it could be an illusion, some cruel deception. But Lord Rahl’s magic couldn’tdo that to her.At the sound of her voice, the goat bounded toward Jennsen, her beloved lifelongfriend. Not a dozen strides away, Betty looked up at Jennsen and froze in hertracks. The wagging tail stopped dead. Betty bleated in distress. The bleatsturned to terror at what she was seeing.“Betty,” Jennsen cried, “its all right. Come-it’s me.”Trembling in fear as it gazed up at her, Betty backed away. The goat wasreacting the same way it had to Oba, just now, and the same way it had thatfirst night she saw him.Betty turned and ran.Right for Richard.He crouched down as the goat, clearly in distress, came running, seekingcomfort, and found it under a sheltering hand.Stunned, Jennsen then heard other little bleats. Small little twin white goatscame capering into the midst of all the people, into the middle of a deadlyconfrontation. They spooked at the sight of the man, turned, and at the sight ofJennsen, shrank back, crying out for their mother.Betty bleated, calling to them. They spun and raced for her protection. Withtheir mother there, they felt safe, and jumped up on Richard, eager for thereassuring touch their mother was getting.Tom had stopped well back, waiting near a pillar as he watched, obviouslyintending to stay clear.Jennsen thought that, surely, the world must have gone mad."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 60“Betty, what are you doing?” Jennsen asked, unable to reconcile in her mind whatwas happening.“Magic,” Sister Perdita whispered from behind, in answer to Jennsen’s puzzledtone. “It’s his doing.”Could it be that Richard Rahl had bewitched even her goat-turned it against her?Richard took a step toward her. Betty and her twins romped around his legs,having no conception of the life-and-death events taking place before them.“Jennsen, use your head,” Richard said. “Think for yourself. You have to helpme, now. Step away from Kahlan.”“Kill him!” Sebastian whispered with vicious determination. “Do it, Jenn! Magiccan’t hurt you! Do it!”Jennsen lifted her knife as Richard calmly watched her. She felt herselfstepping toward him. When she killed him, then his magic would die, too, andBetty would know her once again.Jennsen froze. Something was wrong. She turned to Sebastian.“How do you know? How do you know that? I never told you that magic can’t harmme.”“You too?” Oba called. He’d come closer. “We’re both invincible, then! We canrule D’Hara together-but I’ll be the king, of course. King Oba Rahl. I’m notgreedy, though. You could be a princess, maybe. Yes, I could let you be aprincess, if you’re good.”Jennsen’s eyes turned back toward Sebastian’s surprised face. “How do you know?”“Jenn-I just-I thought,” he stammered, trying to find an answer.“Richard . . .” It was Kahlan, waking, but groggy. “Richard, where are we?” Shewinced in pain, and cried out, even though no one touched her.When Richard took a step toward her, Jennsen stepped back before her,brandishing her knife.“If you want her, you must come through Jennsen,” Sister Perdita said.Richard watched her without emotion for a long moment. “No.”“You must!” the Sister growled. “You will have to kill Jennsen, or Kahlan willdie!”“Are you crazy!” Sebastian yelled at the Sister.“Get ahold of yourself, Sebastian,” the Sister snapped. “Salvation comes onlythrough sacrifice. All of mankind is corrupt. One individual is unimportant-onelife is meaningless. It matters not what happens to her-only her sacrificematters.”Sebastian stared at her, unable to answer, unable to find a reason to argue forJennsen’s life.“You’ll have to kill Jennsen!” Sister Perdita shrieked as she turned back toRichard. “Or I will kill Kahlan!”“Richard . . .” Kahlan moaned, clearly not understanding where she was or whatwas happening.“Kahlan,” Richard said in a calm voice, “stay still.”“Last chance!” Sister Perdita screamed. “Last chance to save the MotherConfessor’s precious life! Last chance before the Keeper has her! Stop him,Jennsen, while I kill his wife!”Jennsen was staggered that the Sister would be encouraging him to kill her. Itmade no sense. It was Lord Rahl that the Sister wanted dead. It was Lord Rahlthey all wanted dead.Jennsen knew she had to end it. She couldn’t be hurt by his magic. How Sebastianknew that, she couldn’t fathom, but she had to end it, now, while she had thechance. Why the Sister was doing this, though, was a mystery.Unless Sister Perdita was trying to anger Richard so that he would lash out withhis magic, strike with his power at Jennsen, thus giving her the opening shefinally needed.That had to be it. Jennsen dared not wait.Unleashing a cry of fury filled with a lifetime of hate, filled with the burningagony of her mother’s murder, filled with the howling rage of the voice in herhead, Jennsen launched herself at Richard.She knew he would hurl his magic at her in order to save himself, unleash magicat her as he had unleashed it at the thousand men. He would be shocked that itdidn’t work, shocked as she burst through his deadly conjuring at the lastinstant to suddenly plunge her knife through his evil heart. He would know toolate that she was invincible.Screaming her rage, Jennsen flew at him.She expected a horrific blast, expected to fly through the lightning, thunder,smoke, but it never came. He caught her wrist in his fist. Simple as that. Heused no magic. He cast no spell. He invoked no wizardly power.Jennsen had no immunity to muscle, and he had plenty of that.“Calm down,” Richard said.She fought him furiously, an angry storm throwing all her hate and pain into heronslaught. He securely held her knife-wielding fist as she raged, her other fistpounding against his chest. He could have snapped her in two with his barehands, but he instead let her scream and strike out at him, then let her yankherself back away to stand in the center of everyone, panting, knife held up,tears of anger and hate streaming down her cheeks.“Kill her or Kahlan dies!” Sister Perdita shrieked again.Sebastian shoved the Sister back. “Have you lost your mind! She can do it! Heisn’t even armed!”Richard pulled a small book from one of the pouches at his belt and held it up.“Oh, but I am.”“What do you mean?” Jennsen asked.His raptor gaze settled on her. “This is an ancient text titled The Pillars ofCreation. It was written by some of our ancestors, Jennsen-those among the firstto be Lord Rahl, among the first who came to understand the full extent of whathad been engendered by the first of the line, Alric Rahl, who created the bond,among other things. It’s very interesting reading.”“I suppose it says that as Lord Rahl you should kill those like me,” Jennsensaid.Richard smiled. “You’re right. It does.”“What?” She could hardly believe that he would admit it. “It really says that?”He nodded. “It explains why all the truly ungifted offspring of the LordRahl-the Lord Rahl who carries down the gift of the bond to his people-must bekilled.”“I knew it!” Jennsen cried. “You tried to lie! But it’s true! It’s all rightthere! ““I didn’t say that I would take the advice. I only said that the book says thatyour kind are to be killed.”“Why?” Jennsen asked.“Jenn, it doesn’t matter,” Sebastian whispered. “Don’t listen to him.”Richard gestured to Sebastian. “He knows why. That’s why he knew you couldn’t beharmed by my magic. He knew because he knows what’s in the book.”Jennsen spun to Sebastian, her eyes wide with sudden understanding. “EmperorJagang has that book.”“Jenn, you’re just talking nonsense, now.”“I saw it, Sebastian. The Pillars of Creation. I saw it in his tent. It’s anancient book, in his old tongue. It’s one of his prized books. He knew what itsays. You are one of his prized strategists. He told you. You knew all alongwhat it said.”“Jenn ... I-”“It was you,” she whispered.“How can you doubt me? I love you.”Then, over the terrible tumult of the voice, the whole thing began unravellingin her mind. The crushing pain of it all came crashing in on her. The truedimensions of the betrayal became horrifyingly clear.“Dear spirits, it was you all along.”Sebastian, his face going nearly as white as his white spikes of hair, turneddeadly calm. “Jenn, that doesn’t change anything.”“It was you,” she whispered, wide-eyed. “You took a single mountain fever rose-”“What! I don’t even have any such thing.”“I saw them in a tin in your pack. There was twine on top of them, hiding them.They spilled out.”“Oh, those. I-I got them from the healer-the one we visited.”“Liar! You had them all along. You took one to give yourself a fever.”“Jenn, now you’re just acting crazy.”Trembling, Jennsen pointed at him with her knife. “It was you, all along. Thatfirst night, you told me, ‘Where I come from, we believe in using what isclosest to an enemy, or what comes from him, as a weapon against him.’ Youwanted me to have this knife. You wanted me because I was closest to your enemy.You wanted to use me. How did you get it on that soldier?”“Jenn-”“You claim to love me. Prove it! Don’t lie to me! Tell me the truth!”Sebastian stared a moment before finally holding his head up and answering. “Ionly wanted to gain your trust. I thought that if I had a fever you would takeme in.”“And the dead soldier I found?”“He was one of my men. We captured the man who carried that knife. I gave it toone of my men, had him dress in a D’Haran uniform, then, after we saw you passbelow, I pushed him over the cliff.”“You killed your own man?”“Sacrifice for the greater cause is sometimes necessary. Salvation comes throughsacrifice,” he added in defiant defense.“How did you know where I was?”“Emperor Jagang is a dream walker. He learned about your kind through the bookyears ago. He used his ability to search for any who might know of yourexistence. Over time, he put together evidence in order to track you down.”“And the note I found?”“I planted it on him. Jagang found out through his ability that you once usedthat name.”“The bond prevents the dream walker from entering a person’s mind,” Richardsaid. “He must have searched for a long time, looking for those who aren’tbonded to the Lord Rahl.”Sebastian nodded with satisfaction. “That’s right. And we succeeded, too.”Jennsen, burning with blinding anger, with the agony of such monumentalbetrayal, swallowed. “And the rest? My ... mother? Was that one of yournecessary sacrifices, too?”Sebastian licked his lips. “Jenn, you don’t understand. I didn’t really know youthen-”“They were your own men. That’s why it was so easy for you to kill them. Theyweren’t expecting you to attack them-they thought you were there to fightalongside them. And that’s why you were confused when I told you about thequads, about how many more men I thought there were. They weren’t really quads.You had to kill some innocent people along the way in order to make me think itwas the other member of a quad. All those times you went out at night to scoutand came back saying they were right behind us, and we kept running through thenight-you made it all up.”“To a good cause,” Sebastian said, quietly.Jennsen gasped in her tears, her fury. “A good cause! You killed my mother! Itwas you all along! Dear spirits ... to think that I ... oh, dear spirits, Islept with my mother’s murderer. You filthy-”“Jenn, get ahold of yourself. It was necessary.” He pointed at Richard. “This isthe cause of it all! We have him now! This was all necessary! Salvation onlycomes through selfless sacrifice. Your sacrifice-your mother’s sacrifice-hascaptured us Richard Rahl, the man who has hunted you your whole life.”Tears of rage poured down her face. “I can’t believe you could have done suchthings to me and claimed to love me.”“But I do, Jenn. I didn’t know you, then. I told you-I never intended to fall inlove with you, but I did. It just happened. You are my life, now. I love you,now.”She pressed her hands to the voice screaming in her head. “You are evil! I couldnever love you!”“Brother Narev teaches that all of mankind is evil. We can have no moralexistence because mankind is a taint on the world of life. At least BrotherNarev is at last in a better place. He’s with the Creator, now.”“You mean to say that even Brother Narev is evil, then? Because he is part ofmankind? Even your precious, sacred Brother Narev was evil?”Sebastian glared at her. “The one who is truly evil is standing right there”-hepointed-” Richard Rahl, for killing a great man. Richard Rahl must be put todeath for his crimes.”“If mankind is evil, and if Brother Narev is in a better place-with theCreator-then Richard has done a kindness by killing Brother Narev, by sendinghim into the Creator’s arms, hasn’t he? And if mankind is evil, then how couldRichard Rahl be evil for killing men of the Order?”Sebastian’s face had gone red. “We are all evil, but some are more evil thanothers! As least we have the humility before the Creator to recognize our ownwickedness, and to glorify only the Creator.” He paused and cooled visibly. “Iknow it’s a sign of weakness, but I love you.” He gave her a smile. “You havebecome my only reason for being, Jenn.”She could only stare at him. “You don’t love me, Sebastian. You don’t have anyidea what love really is. You can’t love anyone or anything until you love yourown existence, first. Love can only grow out of a respect for your own life.When you love yourself, your own existence, then you love someone who canenhance your existence, share it with you, and make it more pleasurable. Whenyou hate yourself and believe your existence is evil, then you can only hate,you can only experience the shell of love, that longing for something good, butyou have nothing to base it in but hatred. You taint the very concept of love,Sebastian, with your corrupted longing for it. You want me only to justify yourhatred, to be your partner in self-loathing.“To truly love someone, Sebastian, you must revel in their existence becausethey make life all the more wonderful. If you think existence is corrupt, thenyou are sealed off from the fruition of such a relationship, from what lovereally is.”“You’re wrong! You just don’t understand!”“I understand all too well. I only wish I had sooner.”“But I do love you, Jenn. You’re wrong. I do love you!”“You can only wish you did. They are the empty words of a barren shell of a man.There is nothing there for me to love-nothing worth loving. You are so empty ofhumanity that it’s even difficult for me to hate you, Sebastian, except in thesense of the way one would hate an open sewer.”Lightning crashed down on the pillars all around. The voice in Jennsen’s headfelt as if it would tear her apart.“Jenn-you don’t mean any of that. You can’t. I can’t live without you.”Jennsen turned her cold fury on him. “The only thing in the whole world that youcould do that would please me, Sebastian, would be to die! ““I’ve listened to this touching lovers’ spat long enough,” Sister Perditagrowled. “Sebastian, be a man and shut your mouth or I’ll shut it for you. Yourlife means just as little as anyone else’s. Richard, you have a choice. Jennsenor the Mother Confessor.”“You don’t have to serve the Keeper, Sister,” Richard said. “You don’t have toserve the dream walker, either. You have a choice.”Sister Perdita pointed at him. “You have a choice! I make you this offer, once!Your time is up! Kahlan’s time is up! Jennsen or Kahlan! Choose!”“I don’t like your rules,” Richard said. “I choose neither.”“Then I choose for you! Your precious wife dies!”Even as Jennsen dove at her to stop her, Sister Perdita seized Kahlan by thehair and lifted her head. The Mother Confessor’s face was blank of allexpression. Jennsen caught Sister Perdita’s arm, swinging the knife with theornate letter “R” as fast as she could, with as much power as she could apply,hoping against hope that she was fast enough to save Kahlan’s life, yet knowingeven as she made the attempt that she was already too late.There was a crystal-clear instant when the world seemed to stop, to freeze inplace. And then, there was a violent concussion to the air, thunder withoutsound.The terrible shock drove a ring of dust and rock away from the Mother Confessorin an ever-expanding circle. The shock to the columns so close all around shookthe towering pillars. Some, that were so precariously balanced, toppled. As theyfell, they hit others, bringing them down as well. It seemed to take forever forthe huge sections of rock to plunge through the sweltering air, trailing dust asthey disintegrated, plummeting down like thunder made of stone. As the rock camecrashing to ground it seemed the entire valley shook under the tremendous blows.Blinding dust swirled up into the air.The world went black, as if all light had been taken away, and in thatterrifying instant, in the total blackness, it seemed that there was no world,no anything.The world came back, like a shadow lifting.Jennsen found herself holding the arm of a dead woman. The Sister toppled to theground like one of the stone pillars. Jennsen saw her knife jutting from theSister’s chest.Richard was already there, holding Kahlan in his arms, slicing through the rope,easing her down. She looked drained, but other than her weakness, she lookedfine.“What happened?” Jennsen asked in wonder.Richard smiled at her. “The Sister made a mistake. I warned her. The MotherConfessor unleashed her power into Sister Perdita.”“Did you have to warn her?” Kahlan asked, suddenly quite coherent sounding. “Shemight have listened to you.”“No, it only encouraged her to do it.”Jennsen realized that the voice was gone. “What happened? Did I kill her?”“No. She was dead before your knife touched her,” Kahlan said. “Richard wasdistracting her so I could use my power. You tried, but you were an instant toolate. She was already mine.”Richard put a comforting hand on Jennsen’s shoulder. “You didn’t kill her, butyou made a choice that saved your own life. That shadow that passed over us asthe Sister died was the Keeper of the dead taking one who had sworn herself tohim. Had you made the wrong choice, you would have been taken with her.”Jennsen’s knees were trembling. “The voice is gone,” she whispered aloud. “It’sgone.”“The Keeper inadvertently revealed his intent,” Richard said. “Since the houndswere loose, that meant the veil-the conduit between worlds was open.”“I don’t understand.”Richard gestured with the book before he tucked it back into one of the pouchesat his belt. “Well, I haven’t had time to read it all, but I’ve read enough tolearn a little. You are an ungifted offspring of a Lord Rahl. That makes you thebalance to the gifted Rahl-to magic. You not only have none, but you’re nottouched by it. In a time of a great war, the House of Rahl was created to givebirth to a line of powerful wizards, but in so doing, it also sowed the seeds ofthe end of magic for the world. It may be the Imperial Order that wants a worldwithout magic, but it is the House of Rahl that may eventually deliver it.“You, Jennsen Rahl, are potentially the most dangerous person alive, becauseyou, like any truly ungifted Rahl, are the seed that could spawn a new worldwithout magic.”Jennsen stared into his gray eyes. “Then why would you not want me dead, likeevery Lord Rahl before you?”Richard smiled. “You have as much right to your life as anyone else-as any LordRahl has ever had to their life. There is no right way for the world to be. Theonly right is that people be allowed to live their own life.”Kahlan pulled the knife from Sister Perdita’s chest and cleaned it on the blackrobes before handing it to Jennsen. “Sister Perdita was wrong. Salvation is notthrough sacrifice. Your responsibility is to yourself.”“Your life is your own,” Richard said, “and not anyone else’s. You made meproud, hearing everything you said to Sebastian.”Jennsen stared down at the knife in her hand, still dazed and confused byeverything that was happening. She looked around in the gathering darkness, butdidn’t see Sebastian anywhere. Oba was gone, too.As she looked around, Jennsen was startled to see a Mord-Sith standing not faraway, “This is just great,” the woman complained to the Mother Confessor,throwing her hands up. “The girl sounds like Lord Rahl. Now I’m going to have tolisten to two of them.”Kahlan smiled and sat down, leaning back against the pillar where she had beentied, watching Richard, listening, stroking the ears of Betty’s twin kids.Betty watched her two young ones, then, seeing them safe, peered hopefully up atJennsen. Her little tail started wagging in a blur.“Betty?”Betty happily jumped up on her, eager for a reunion. Jennsen tearfully huggedthe goat before standing to face her brother.“But why would you not do as your ancestors? Why? How can you risk everything inthat book?”Richard hooked his thumbs behind his belt and took a deep breath. “Life is thefuture, not the past. The past can teach us, through experience, how toaccomplish things in the future, comfort us with cherished memories, and providethe foundation of what has already been accomplished. But only the future holdslife. To live in the past is to embrace what is dead. To live life to itsfullest, each day must be created anew. As rational, thinking beings, we mustuse our intellect, not a blind devotion to what has come before, to makerational choices.”“Life is the future, not the past,” Jennsen whispered to herself, consideringall that life now held for her. “Where did you ever hear such a thing?”Richard grinned. “It’s the Wizard’s Seventh Rule.”Jennsen gazed up at him through her tears. “You have given me a future, a life.Thank you.”He embraced her, then, and Jennsen suddenly didn’t feel alone in the world. Shefelt whole again. It felt so good to be held as she wept with tears for hermother, and tears for the future, for the joy that there was life, and a future.Kahlan rubbed Jennsen’s back. “Welcome to the family.”When Jennsen wiped her eyes, and laughed at everything and nothing while sheused her other hand to scratch Betty’s ears, she saw, then, Tom standing nearby.Jennsen ran to him and fell into his arms. “Oh, Tom. You can’t know how glad Iam to see you! Thank you for bringing me Betty.”“That’s me. Goat delivery, as promised. Turns out that Irma, the sausage lady,only wanted your goat to get herself a kid. She has a billy and wanted a youngone. She kept one and let you have the other two.”“Betty had three?”Tom nodded. “I’m afraid that I’ve become very fond of Betty and her two littleones.”“I can’t believe that you did that for me. Tom, you’re wonderful.”“My mother always said so, too. Don’t forget, you promised to tell Lord Rahl.”Jennsen laughed in delight. “I promise! But, how in the world did you ever findme?”Tom smiled and pulled a knife from behind his back. Jennsen was astonished tosee that it was identical to the one she had.“You see,” he explained, “I carry the knife in service to Lord Rahl.”“You do?” Richard asked. “I’ve never even met you.”“Oh,” the Mord-Sith said, “Tom, here, is all right, Lord Rahl. I can vouch forhim.”“Why, thank you, Cara,” Tom said with a twinkle in his eye.“And you knew all along, then,” Jennsen asked, “that I was making it all up?”Tom shrugged. “I wouldn’t be a proper protector to Lord Rahl if I let such asuspicious person as you roam around, trying to do harm, without doing my bestto find out what you were up to. I’ve kept tabs on you, followed you a goodlypart of your journeying. “Jennsen swatted his shoulder. “You’ve been spying on me!”“As a protector to Lord Rahl, I had to see what you were up to, and to make sureyou didn’t harm Lord Rahl.”“Well,” she said, “I don’t think you were doing a very good job of it then. ““What do you mean?” Tom asked with exaggerated indignation.“I could have really stabbed him. You just stood way over there the whole time,too far away to do anything about it.”Tom smiled that boyish grin of his, but this time it was a little moremischievous than usual.“Oh, I’d not have let you hurt Lord Rahl.”Tom turned and heaved his knife. With blinding speed such as she had never seen,the blade flew across the valley, embedding itself with a thunk in one of thefaraway fallen stone pillars. Jennsen squinted and saw that it had been driventhrough something dark.She followed Tom, Richard, Kahlan, and the Mord-Sith between towering columnsand stone rubble to where the knife was stuck. To Jennsen’s astonishment, it hadimpaled a leather pouch-right through the center being held up by a hand comingfrom beneath the huge section of fallen stone.“Please,” came a muffled voice from under the rock, “please let me out. I’ll payyou. I can pay. I have my own money.”It was Oba. The rock had fallen on him when he ran. It had landed on bouldersthat kept the main section of stone, big enough that twenty men couldn’t havejoined hands around it, from collapsing to the ground, leaving a tiny space,trapping the man alive under the tons of rock.Tom pulled his knife from the soft stone and retrieved the leather pouch. Hewaved it in the air.“Friedrich!” he called toward the wagon. A man sat up. “Friedrich! Is thisyours?”Jennsen was astonished yet again, in this astonishing day, to see FriedrichGilder, the husband of Althea, climb down from the wagon and make his way overto them.“That’s mine,” he said. He looked under the rock. “You have more.”After a moment, the hand began passing out more leather and cloth purses.“There, you have all my money. Let me out, now.”“Oh,” Friedrich said, “I don’t think I could lift that rock. Especially not forthe man who is responsible for the death of my wife.”“Althea died?” Jennsen asked in shock.“I’m afraid so. My sunshine has gone from my life.”“I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “She was a good woman.”Friedrich smiled. “Yes, she was.” He pulled a small smooth stone from hispocket. “But she left me this, and that much is a pleasure.”“Isn’t that odd,” Tom said in wonder. He fished around in his pocket until hecame up with something. He opened his hand to reveal a small smooth stonesitting in his palm. “I have one of those, too. I always carry it as a good-luckcharm.”Friedrich eyed him suspiciously. He grinned at last. “She has smiled on you,too, then.”“I can’t breathe,” came a muffled voice from under the rock. “Please, it hurts.I can’t move. Let me out.”Richard held his hand out toward the rock. There came a grinding sound and asword floated from under the rock. He bent and pulled his scabbard out, draggingthe baldric out behind. He wiped the dust off and placed the baldric over hisshoulder, the scabbard at his hip. The sword was magnificent, a proper weaponfor the Lord Rahl.Jennsen saw the gleaming gold word “TRUTH” on the hilt.“You faced all those soldiers, and you didn’t even have your sword,” Jennsensaid. “I guess your magic was better defense.”Richard smiled as he shook his head. “My ability works through need and anger.With Kahlan taken, I had plenty of need, and a ready rage.” He lifted the hiltclear of the scabbard until she could again see the word spelled out in gold.“This weapon works all the time.”“How did you know where we were?” Jennsen asked him. “How did you know whereKahlan was?”Richard burnished a thumb over the single gold word on the hilt of his sword.“My grandfather gave me this. King Oba, there, stole it when, with the Keeper’shelp, he captured Kahlan. This sword is rather special. I have a connection toit; I can sense where it is. The Keeper no doubt induced Oba to take it in orderto entice me here.”“Please,” Oba called, “I can’t breathe.”“Your grandfather?” Jennsen asked, ignoring Oba’s distress, his weeping. “Youmean, Wizard Zorander?”Richard’s whole face softened with a splendid grin. “You’ve met Zedd, then. He’swonderful, isn’t he?”“He tried to kill me,” Jennsen muttered.“Zedd?” Richard scoffed. “Zedd’s harmless.”“Harmless? He-”The Mord-Sith, Cara, poked at Jennsen with the red rod she had-the Agiel.“What are you doing?” Jennsen asked. “Stop that.”“That doesn’t do anything to you?”“No,” Jennsen said, scowling. “No more than it did when Nyda did it.”Cara’s eyebrow went up. “You’ve met Nyda?” She looked up at Richard. “And shecan still walk. I’m impressed.”“She’s immune to magic,” Richard said. “That’s why your Agiel won’t work on her,either.”Cara, with a sly smile, looked over at Kahlan.“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Kahlan asked.“She might just be able to solve our little problem,” Cara said, her wicked gringrowing.“Now, I suppose,” Richard said in ill humor, “you’re going to have her touch it,too.”“Well,” Cara said defensively, “someone has to. You don’t want me to do itagain, do you?”“No! ““What are you three talking about?” Jennsen asked.“We have some urgent problems,” Richard said. “If you’d like to help, I thinkyou just might have the special talent it takes to get us out of a seriousbind.”“Really? You mean you want me to go with you?”“If you’re willing,” Kahlan said. She leaned on Richard, looking like she was atthe end of her strength.“Tom,” Richard said, “might we-”“Of course!” Tom said, dashing over to offer his arm to Kahlan. “Come on over. Ihave some nice blankets in back where you can lay down-just ask Jennsen, they’rereal comfortable. I’ll drive you back up the easy way.”“That would be much appreciated,” Richard said. “It’s just about dark. We’dbetter stay here for the night and ride out as soon as it’s light enough.Hopefully, before it gets too hot.”“The rest of them will want to sit back there with the Mother Confessor, Iexpect,” Tom whispered to Jennsen. “If you don’t mind, you could ride up on theseat with me.”“First I want to know something-the truth, now,” Jennsen said. “If you’re adefender to Lord Rahl, what would you have done, standing over there, if I hadharmed Lord Rahl?”Tom looked down at her with a serious expression. “Jennsen, if I really thoughtthat you would or could, I’d have put this knife in you before you had thechance.”Jennsen smiled. “Good. I’ll ride with you, then. My horse is up there,” she saidpointing up past the Pillars of Creation. “I’ve become good friends with Rusty.”Betty bleated at the sound of the horse’s name. Jennsen laughed and scratchedBetty’s fat middle. “You remember Rusty?”Betty bleated that she did as her kids frolicked near by.In the distance behind, Jennsen could hear the murdering Oba Rahl demanding tobe let out. She stopped and looked back, realizing that he, too, was a halfbrother. A very evil one.“I’m sorry I thought such terrible things about you,” she said, looking up atRichard.He smiled as he held Kahlan close with one arm, and then pulled Jennsen closewith the other. “You used your head when confronted with the truth. I couldn’task for any more than that.”The weight of the rock that had fallen was slowly crushing the sandstoneboulders holding up the pillar trapping Oba. It was only a matter of hours untilOba was crushed to death in his inescapable prison, or, if not, until he died ofthirst.After such a defeat, the Keeper wasn’t going to reward Oba with any help. TheKeeper would have eternity to make Oba suffer for failure.Oba was a killer. Jennsen suspected that Richard Rahl had no shred of mercy forsomeone like that, or anyone who hurt Kahlan. He showed Oba none.Oba Rahl would be buried forever with the Pillars of Creation.Chapter 61 in the morning, Tom gave them a ride out among the towering Pillarsof Creation. The view in the early morning, with the sun throwing long shadowsand lending striking colors to the landscape, was spectacular. It was a sightthat no one else had ever come out of the valley to report.Rusty was happy to see Jennsen, and turned positively frisky when she saw Bettyand her two kids.Jennsen, with Richard and Kahlan at her side, went into the squat building anddiscovered that Sebastian, unable to reconcile his beliefs and his feelings, hadgranted Jennsen her last wish.He had taken all the mountain fever roses he’d had in the tin. He sat dead atthe table.Jennsen, sitting beside Tom, listened to Richard and Kahlan explain the wholestory of how they came to be together. Jennsen could hardly believe that he wasso much different than she had ever thought. His mother, having been raped byDarken Rahl, had run away with Zedd to protect Richard. Richard grew up far awayin Westland, not knowing anything at all about D’Hara, or the House of Rahl, ormagic. Richard had ended the evil rule of Darken Rahl. Kahlan, having beenhunted by real quads, had killed their commander. With Richard as Lord Rahl,there were no more quads.Jennsen felt proud and honored, now, that Richard had asked her to keep theknife with the ornate letter “R” on it. He said she had earned the right tocarry it. She intended to keep it and hold sacred its true purpose. Now, shetruly was a protector, just like Tom.As they rode along, Betty stood in the wagon beside Friedrich, with her fronthooves up on the seat between Tom and Jennsen, each holding a sleeping littlegoat. Rusty was tied behind, where Betty frequently went back to visit. Richard,Kahlan, and Cara rode along at the side.Jennsen turned to her brother after having considered what he’d just told her.“So, you’re not making that up, then? It really said that about me in thatbook-The Pillars of Creation?”“It was speaking about those like you: ‘The most dangerous creature walking theworld of life is the ungifted child of a Lord Rahl, because they are completelyimmune to magic. Magic can’t harm them, can’t affect them, and even prophecy isblind to them.’ But I guess you turned out to prove the book wrong.”She thought it over. Some of it still didn’t make sense to her. “I don’tunderstand why the Keeper was using me. Why was his voice in my head?”“Well, I only had time to translate a small bit of the book, and other parts aredamaged. But, from some of what I did read, I guess that the ungifted child,since he has no magic, is what the book calls a ‘hole in the world,’ “ Richardexplained, “so they’re also a hole in the veilmaking you potentially a conduitbetween the world of life and the world of the dead. In order for the Keeper toconsume the world of life, he needed such a gateway. The need for vengeance wasthe final key. Your surrender to his wishes-when you went out in the woods withthe Sisters of the Dark-had to be consummated by you being slain, by youcompleting the bargain with death by dying.”“So, if anyone had killed me-Sister Perdita, for example-after I went out in thewoods with those Sisters of the Dark, wouldn’t that have opened such a gateway?”“No. The Keeper needed a protector of the world of life. It took the balance toyour lack of the gift. It took a gifted Rahl-the Lord Rahl, to accomplish such athing,” Richard said. “If I had killed you to save myself, or Kahlan, then theKeeper would have been loosed into this world through the breach created. I hadto force you to choose life, not death, if you were to live, and if the Keeperwas to be kept in the underworld.”“I might have ... destroyed life,” Jennsen said, shaken at truly understandinghow close she’d come to unleashing cataclysmic destruction.“I’d not have let you,” Tom said, good-naturedly.Jennsen put her hand on his arm, realizing that she had never had feelingsbefore like she had for him. The man positively made her heart sing. His smilemade her life worth living. Betty stuck her nose in, wanting attention, and tosee her sleeping babies.“There is no greater treason to life than delivering the innocent to the Keeperof the Dead,” Cara said.“But she didn’t,” Richard said. “She used reason to discover the truth, andtruth to embrace life.”“You sure know a lot about magic,” Jennsen said to Richard.Kahlan and Cara laughed so hard that Jennsen thought they might fall off theirhorses.“I don’t see what’s so funny,” Richard grumbled.The two of them laughed all the harder."},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsChapter 1 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_001.html#filepos1046]Chapter 2 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_002.html#filepos16775]Chapter 3 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_003.html#filepos39317]Chapter 4 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_004.html#filepos48043]Chapter 5 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_005.html#filepos70852]Chapter 6 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_006.html#filepos101767]Chapter 7 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_007.html#filepos129895]Chapter 8 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_008.html#filepos147187]Chapter 9 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_009.html#filepos168021]Chapter 10 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_010.html#filepos195633]Chapter 11 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_011.html#filepos224459]Chapter 12 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_012.html#filepos240258]Chapter 13 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_013.html#filepos265407]Chapter 14 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_014.html#filepos298479]Chapter 15 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_015.html#filepos324323]Chapter 16 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_016.html#filepos343562]Chapter 17 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_017.html#filepos370956]Chapter 18 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_018.html#filepos385340]Chapter 19 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_019.html#filepos407925]Chapter 20 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_020.html#filepos435592]Chapter 21 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_021.html#filepos458100]Chapter 22 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_022.html#filepos475388]Chapter 23 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_023.html#filepos502515]Chapter 24 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_024.html#filepos541097]Chapter 25 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_025.html#filepos572404]Chapter 26 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_026.html#filepos593211]Chapter 27 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_027.html#filepos625353]Chapter 28 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_028.html#filepos641972]Chapter 29 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_029.html#filepos661720]Chapter 30 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_030.html#filepos696704]Chapter 31 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_031.html#filepos709983]Chapter 32 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_032.html#filepos736020]Chapter 33 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_033.html#filepos751928]Chapter 34 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_034.html#filepos772499]Chapter 35 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_035.html#filepos794725]Chapter 36 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_036.html#filepos818789]Chapter 37 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_037.html#filepos837983]Chapter 38 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_038.html#filepos868307]Chapter 39 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_039.html#filepos887579]Chapter 40 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_040.html#filepos901715]Chapter 41 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_041.html#filepos932106]Chapter 42 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_042.html#filepos947189]Chapter 43 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_043.html#filepos971984]Chapter 44 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_044.html#filepos994049]Chapter 45 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_045.html#filepos1023882]Chapter 46 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_046.html#filepos1055053]Chapter 47 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_047.html#filepos1078441]Chapter 49 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_048.html#filepos1128227]Chapter 50 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_049.html#filepos1147722]Chapter 51 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_050.html#filepos1179858]Chapter 52 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_051.html#filepos1197977]Chapter 53 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_052.html#filepos1222073]Chapter 54 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_053.html#filepos1233541]Chapter 55 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_054.html#filepos1254411]Chapter 56 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_055.html#filepos1266211]Chapter 57 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_056.html#filepos1282471]Chapter 58 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_058.html#filepos1303890]Chapter 59 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_058.html#filepos1316998]Chapter 60 [../Text/The_Pillars_of_Creation_split_059.html#filepos1339819]"}]
