A dozen leather- and chain-mail-clad D’Haransoldiers, their unadorned swords sheathed, or crescent-bladed battle-axes hookedon belt hangers, crossed at an intersection just ahead. Though their weaponsweren’t drawn, every wooden hilt was gripped in a ready fist as vigilant eyesscrutinized the shadows among the doorways and columns to each side. Their hastybows toward Kahlan only briefly interrupted their attention to their task.“We can’t just kill him,” Kahlan explained. “We need answers.”An eyebrow lifted over one icy blue eye. “Oh, I didn’t say he wouldn’t give usanswers before he dies. He will answer any question you have when I’m finishedwith him.” A mirthless smile ghosted across her flawless face. “That is the jobof a Mord-Sith: getting people to answer questions”-she paused as the smilereturned to widen with professional satisfaction-”before they die.”Kahlan heaved a sigh. “Cara, that’s no longer your job-your life. Your job nowis to protect Richard.”“That is why you should let me kill him. We should not take a risk by lettingthis man live.”“No. We first have to find out what’s going on, and we’re not going to start outdoing it the way you want.”Cara’s smile, humourless as it was, had vanished again. “As you wish, MotherConfessor.”Kahlan wondered how the woman had managed to change into her skin-tight redleather outfit so fast. Whenever there was so much as a whiff of trouble, atleast one of the three Mord-Sith seemed to materialize out of nowhere in her redleather. Red, as they often pointed out, didn’t show blood.“Are you sure he said that, this man? Those were his words?”“Yes, Mother Confessor, his exact words. You should let me kill him before hehas a chance to try to bring them to pass.”Kahlan ignored the repeated request as they hurried on down the hall. “Where’sRichard?”“You wish me to get Lord Rahl?”“No! I just want to know where he is, in case there’s trouble.”“I would say that this qualifies as trouble.”“You said that there must be two hundred soldiers holding weapons on him. Howmuch trouble can one man cause with all those swords, axes, and arrows pointedat him?”“My former master, Darken Rahl, knew that steel alone could not always warddanger. That is why he had Mord-Sith nearby and at the ready.”“That evil man would kill people without even bothering to determine if theywere really a danger to him. Richard isn’t like that, and neither am I. You knowthat if there is a true threat, I’m not shy about eliminating it, but if thisman is more than he seems, then why is he so timidly cowering before all thatsteel? Besides, as a Confessor I am hardly defenseless against threats thatsteel won’t stop.”“We have to keep our heads. Let’s not start leaping to judgments that may beunwarranted.”“If you don’t think he could be trouble, then why am I nearly running to justkeep up with you?”Kahlan realized that she was a half a step ahead of the woman. She slowed herpace to a brisk walk. “Because it’s Richard we’re talking about,” she said in anear whisper.Cara smirked. “You’re as worried as I.”“Of course I am. But for all we know, killing this man, if he is more than heseems, could be springing a snare.”“You could be right, but that is the purpose for Mord-Sith.”“So, where is Richard?”Cara gripped the red leather at her waist and stretched her armor-backed glovetighter onto her hand as she flexed her fist. Her Agiel, an awesome weapon thatappeared to be nothing more than a finger-width foot-long red leather rod,dangled from a fine gold chain at her right wrist, ever at the ready. One justlike it, but no weapon in Kahlan’s hands, hung on a chain around Kahlan’s neck.It had been a gift from Richard, a gift that symbolized the pain and sacrificethey had both endured.“He is out behind the palace, in one of the private parks.” Cara gestured overher shoulder. “The one that way. Raina and Berdine are with him.”Kahlan was relieved to hear that the other two Mord-Sith were watching over him.“Something to do with his surprise for me?”“What surprise?”Kahlan smiled. “Surely he’s told you, Cara.”Cara snatched a glimpse out of the corner of her eye. “Of course he has toldme.”“Then what is it?”“He also told me not to tell you.”Kahlan shrugged. “I won’t tell him that you told me.”Cara’s laugh, like her smile before, bore no humor. “Lord Rahl has a peculiarway of finding out things, especially those things you wish him not to know.”Kahlan knew the truth of that. “So what’s he doing out there?”The muscles in Cara’s jaw flexed. “Outdoor things. You know Lord Rahl; he likesto do outdoor things.”Kahlan glanced over to see that Cara’s face had turned nearly as red as herleather outfit. “What sort of outdoor things?”Cara cleared her throat into her armored fist. “He is taming chipmunks.”“He’s what? I can’t hear you.”Cara waved an impatient hand. “He said that the chipmunks have come out to testthe warming weather. He is taming them.” Her cheeks rounded as she huffed. “Withseeds.”Kahlan smiled at the thought of Richard, the man she loved, the man who hadseized command of D’Hara, and had much of the Midlands now eating out of hishand, having a fine afternoon teaching chipmunks to eat seeds out of his hand.“Well, that sounds innocent enough - feeding seeds to chipmunks.”Cara flexed her armored fist again as they swept between two D’Haran guards. “Heis teaching them to eat those seeds,” she said through clenched teeth, “out ofRaina and Berdine’s hands. The two of them were giggling!” She aimed a mortifiedexpression toward the ceiling as she threw her hands up. Her Agiel swung on thegold chain at her wrist. “Mord-Sith - giggling!”Kahlan pressed her lips tight, trying to keep from breaking into laughter. Carapulled her long blond braid forward, over her shoulder, stroking it in a waythat provoked in Kahlan an unsettling memory of the way Shota, the witch woman,stroked her snakes.“Well,” Kahlan said, trying to cool the other woman’s indignation, “maybe it’snot by their choice. They are bonded to him. Perhaps Richard ordered it, andthey’re simply obeying him.”Cara shot her an incredulous look. Kahlan knew that any of the three Mord-Sithwould defend Richard to the death - they had shown themselves prepared tosacrifice their lives without hesitation - but though they were bonded to himthrough magic, they disregarded his orders wantonly if they judged them trivial,unimportant, or unwise. Kahlan imagined that it was because Richard had giventhem their freedom from the rigid principles of their profession, and theyenjoyed exercising that freedom. Darken Rahl, their former master, Richard’sfather, would have killed them in a heartbeat had he even suspected that theywere considering disobeying his orders, no matter how trivial they were.“The sooner you wed Lord Rahl the better. Then, instead of teaching chipmunks toeat out of Mord-Sith hands, he will be eating out of yours.”Kahlan exhaled in a soft, lilting laugh, thinking about being his wife. Itwouldn’t be long, now. “Richard will have my hand, but you should know as wellas anyone that he will not be eating out of it - and I wouldn’t want him to.”“If you regain your senses, come see me, and I will teach you how.” Cara turnedher attention to the alert D’Haran soldiers. Men at arms were rushingeverywhere, checking every hall and looking behind every door, no doubt atCara’s insistence.“Egan is with Lord Rahl, too. He should be safe while we see to this man.”Kahlan’s mirth withered. “How did he get in here, anyway? Did he come in withthe petitioners?”“No.” A professional chill settled back into Cara’s tone. “But I intend to findout. From what I gather, he just walked up to a patrol of guards not far fromthe council chambers and asked where he could find Lord Rahl, as if just anyonecan walk in and ask to see the Master of D’Hara, as if he was a head butcherthat anyone can go to if they want a choice cut of mutton.”“That’s when the guards asked him why he wanted to see Richard?”Cara nodded. “I think we should kill him.”Realization wormed up Kahlan’s spine in a cold tingle. Cara wasn’t simply anaggressive bodyguard, unconcerned about spilling the blood of others - she wasafraid. She was afraid for Richard.“I want to know how he got in here. He presented himself to a patrol inside thepalace; he shouldn’t have been able to get inside, wandering around unfettered.What if we have a hitherto-unknown breach in security? Wouldn’t it be better tofind out before another comes without the courtesy of announcing himself?”“We can find out if you let me do it my way.”“We don’t know enough yet; he could end up dead before we find out anything,then the danger to Richard could become greater.”“All right,” Cara said with a sigh, “we will do it your way, as long as youunderstand that I have orders to follow.”“What orders?”“Lord Rahl told us to protect you as we would protect him.” With a toss of herhead, Cara flicked her blond braid back over her shoulder. “If you are notcareful, Mother Confessor, and needlessly endanger Lord Rahl with yourrestraint, I will withdraw my permission for Richard to keep you.”Kahlan laughed. Her laughter died out when Cara didn’t so much as smile. She wasnever entirely sure when the Mord-Sith were joking and when they were beingdeadly serious.“In here,” Kahlan said. “It’s shorter this way, and besides, I want to see whatpetitioners are waiting, in view of our strange visitor. He could even be adiversion to draw our attention away from someone else-the true threat.”Cara’s brow twitched as if she had been slighted. “Why do you think I hadPetitioners’ Hall sealed and ringed with guards?”“You did it surreptitiously, I hope. There’s no need to frighten the wits out ofinnocent petitioners.”“I told the officers not to frighten the people in there if they didn’t have to,but our first responsibility is to protect Lord Rahl.”Kahlan nodded. She couldn’t argue with that.Two heavily muscled guards bowed, along with twenty others nearby, beforepulling open the tall, brassbound doors leading to an arched passageway. A stonerail supported by fat, vase-shaped balusters ran along the white marble pillars.The barrier, separating the petitioners in the hundred-foot-long room from theofficials’ passageway, was symbolic rather than teal. Skylights thirty feetoverhead lit the waiting room, but left the length of the passageway to themuted golden light of lamps hung in the peak of each small Vault in its ceiling.It was a long-standing custom for people-petitioners-to come to the Confessors’Palace to seek any number of things, from settlement of disagreements over therights of peddlers to coveted street comers, to officials of different landsseeking armed intervention in border disputes. Maters that could be handled bycity officials were directed to the proper offices. Matters brought bydignitaries of the lands, if those matters were deemed to be important enough,or could be handled in no other way, were taken before the council. Petitioners’Hall was where officers of protocol determined the disposition of requests.When Darken Rahl, Richard’s father had attacked the Midlands, many of theofficials in Aydindril had been killed, among them Saul Witherrin, the Chief ofProtocol, along with most of his office Richard had defeated Darken Rahl, andbeing the gifted heir, had ascended to Master of D’Hara. He had ended thebickering and battling among the lands of the Midlands by demanding theirsurrender in order to forge them all into a force capable of withstanding thecommon threat from the Old World, from the Imperial Order.Kahlan found it unsettling to be the Mother Confessor who had reigned over theend of the Midlands as a formal entity, a union of sovereign lands, but she knewthat her first responsibility was to the lives of the people, not to tradition;if not stopped, the Imperial Order would cast the world into slavery, and thepeople of the Midlands would be its chattel. Richard had accomplished what hisfather could not, but did so for entirely different reasons. She loved Richardand knew his benevolent intent in seizing power.Soon they would be wedded, and their marriage would unite the Midlands andD’Hara in peace and unity for all time. More than that, though, it would be apersonal fulfilment of their love and deepest desire: to be one.Kahlan missed Saul Witherrin; he had been a capable aide. With the council nowdead, too, and the Midlands now a part of D’Hara, matters of protocol were indisarray. A few frustrated D’Haran officers were standing at the railing,attempting to minister to the petitioners’ needs.As she entered, Kahlan’s gaze swept the waiting crowd, analyzing the nature ofproblems brought to the palace this day. By their dress, most appeared to bepeople from the surrounding city of Aydindril: labors, shopkeepers, andmerchants.She saw a knot of children she knew from the day before when Richard had takenher to watch them playing a game of Ja’La. It was the first time she had seenthe fast-paced game, and it had been an entertaining diversion for a couple ofhours: to watch children play and laugh. The children probably wanted Richard tocome watch another game; he had been an ardent supporter of each team. Even ifhe had picked one team to cheer over the other, Kahlan doubted it would havemade any difference; children were drawn to Richard, seeming to instinctivelysense his kind heart.Kahlan recognized several diplomats from a few of the smaller lands, who shehoped had come to accept Richard’s offer of a peaceful surrender and union intoD’Haran rule. She knew the leaders of those lands, and was expecting them toheed her urging to join with them in the cause of freedom.She recognized, too, a group of diplomats from some of the larger lands that hadstanding armies. They had been expected, and later that day Richard and Kahlanwere to meet with them, along with any other newly arrived representatives, tohear their decision.She wished Richard would find himself something more suitable to wear. His woodsclothes had served him well, but he now needed to present a more fitting imageof the position he found himself in. He was so much more than a woods guide now.Having served nearly her whole life as a person of authority, Kahlan knew thatit often smoothed matters of leadership if you matched people’s expectations.Kahlan doubted people who needed a woods guide would have followed Richard if hehadn’t dressed for the woods. In a way, Richard was their guide in thistreacherous new world of untested allegiances and new enemies. He often askedher advice; she was going to have to talk to him about his clothes.When the people assembled saw the Mother Confessor striding into the passageway,conversation stilled and they began going to a knee in deep bows. Despite thefact that she was of an unprecedentedly young age for the post, there was no oneof higher authority in the Midlands than the Mother Confessor. The MotherConfessor was the Mother Confessor, no matter the face of the woman who held theoffice. People bowed not so much to the woman as to that ancient authority.Matters of Confessors were an enigma to most people of the Midlands; Confessorschose the Mother Confessor. To Confessors, age was of secondary consideration.Though she was chosen to preserve the freedoms and rights of the people of theMidlands, people rarely saw it in those terms. To most, a ruler was a ruler.Some were good, some were bad. As the ruler of rulers, the Mother Confessorencouraged the good, and suppressed the bad. If a ruler proved bad enough, itwas within her power to eliminate them. That was the ultimate purpose of aMother Confessor. To most people, though, such far removed matters of governancesimply seemed the squabbling of rulers.In the sudden silence that filled Petitioners’ Hall, Kahlan paused toacknowledge the gathered visitors.A young woman standing against the far wall watched as all those around her fellto one knee. She glanced in Kahlan’s direction, back to those kneeling, and thenfollowed suit.Kahlan’s brow tightened.In the Midlands, the length of a woman’s hair denoted her power and standing.Matters of power, no matter how trivial they might seem on the surface, weretaken seriously in the Midlands. Not even a queen’s hair was allowed to be aslong as a Confessor’s, and no Confessor’s hair was as long as that of the MotherConfessor.This woman had a thick mass of brown hair close to the length of Kahlan’s.Kahlan knew nearly every person of high rank in the Midlands; it was her duty,and she took it seriously. A woman with hair that long was obviously a person ofhigh standing, but Kahlan didn’t recognize her. There was likely to be no man orwoman in the entire city, other than Kahlan, who would outrank the woman-if shewas in fact from the Midlands.“Rise, my children,” Kahlan said in formal response to the tops of the waiting,bowed heads.Dresses and coats rustled as everyone began coming to their feet, most keepingtheir eyes to the floor, out of respect, or needless fear. The woman rose to herfeet, twisting a simply made kerchief in her fingers, watching those around her.She turned her brown eyes to the floor, as most of the others were.“Cara,” Kahlan whispered, “could that woman there, with the long hair, be fromD’Hara?”Cara had been watching her, too; she had learned some of the customs of theMidlands. Though Cara’s long blond hair was about the length of Kahlan’s, shewas D’Haran. They didn’t live by the same customs.“Her nose is too ‘cute’ to be D’Haran.”“I’m serious. Do you think she could be D’Haran?”Cara studied the woman a moment longer. “I doubt it. D’Haran women don’t wearflower-print dresses, nor are the dresses they do wear of that cut. But clothescan be changed to fit the occasion, or to fit in with local people.”The dress didn’t really fit the local dress of Aydindril, but it might not be soout of place in other, more remote, areas of the Midlands. Kahlan nodded andturned to a waiting captain, motioning him over.He leaned his head close as she spoke in a low tone. “There is a woman with longbrown hair standing against the wall in the back, over my left shoulder. Do yousee who I’m talking about?”“The pretty one, in the blue kirtle?”“Yes. Do you know why she’s here?”“She said she wished to speak with Lord Rahl.”Kahlan’s brow drew tighter. She noticed that Cara’s did, too. “What about?”“She said that she’s looking for a man-Cy something-I didn’t recognize his name.She said he’s been missing since last autumn, and she was told that Lord Rahlwould be able to help her.”“Is that right,” Kahlan said. “And did she say what business she has with thismissing man?”The captain glanced to the woman and then brushed his sandy hair back from hisforehead. “She said that she’s to marry him.”Kahlan nodded. “It could be that she’s a dignitary, but if she is, I’membarrassed to admit that I don’t know her name.”The captain glanced at a tattered list with scribbles all over it. He turned thepaper and scanned the other side until he found what he was looking for. “Shesaid her name was Nadine. She gave no title.”“Well, please see to it that Lady Nadine is taken to a private waiting roomwhere she will be comfortable. Tell her that I will come speak with her and seeif I can help. Have dinner brought to her, along with anything else she mightrequire. Give her my apology and tell her that I have something of vitalimportance that I must attend to first, but I will come see her as soon as I amable, and that I wish to do what I can to help her.”Kahlan could understand the woman’s distress if she really was separated fromher love and was searching for him. Kahlan had been in that situation herselfand knew well the anguish.“I’ll see to it at once, Mother Confessor.”“One other thing, captain.” Kahlan watched the woman twisting her kerchief.“Tell Lady Nadine that there is trouble about, what with the war with the OldWorld, and that for her own safety we must insist that she remain in the roomuntil I can come to speak with her. Post a heavy guard outside the room. Placearchers at a safe distance down the hall to either side of the door.“If she comes out, insist that she must return to the room at once and wait. Ifyou must, tell her that it is by my command. If she still tries to leave”-Kahlanlooked into the captain’s waiting blue eyes-”kill her.”The captain bowed as Kahlan swept on through the passageway, Cara right at herheels.“Well, well,” Cara said, once outside Petitioners’ Hall, “at last the MotherConfessor comes to her senses. I knew I had a good reason for allowing Lord Rahlto keep you. You will make him a worthy wife.”Kahlan turned down the corridor toward the room where guards held the man. “Ihaven’t changed my mind about anything, Cara. Considering our strange visitor,I’m giving Lady Nadine every chance to live, every chance I can afford to give,but you’re mistaken if you think I’ll balk at doing whatever it takes to protectRichard. Besides being the man I love more than life itself, Richard is a man ofvital importance to the freedom of the people of both D’Hara and the Midlands.There’s no telling what the Imperial Order would try in order to get to him.”Cara smiled, sincerely, this time. “I know he loves you the same. That’s why Idon’t like you going to see this man; Lord Rahl may separate me from my hide ifhe thinks I allowed you near danger.”“Richard is one born with the gift; I, too, have been born with magic. DarkenRahl sent quads to kill the Confessors because there is little danger to aConfessor from one man.”Kahlan felt the familiar, yet distant anguish of their deaths. Distant, becauseit seemed so long ago, though it had been hardly a year. For months, in thebeginning, she had felt as if she should be dead along with her sisterConfessors, and that she had somehow betrayed them by escaping all the trapslaid for her. Now, she was the last.With a flick of her wrist, Cara snapped her Agiel into her fist. “Even a man,like Lord Rahl, born with the gift? Even a wizard?”“Even a wizard, and even if, unlike Richard, he knows how to use his power. Inot only know how to use mine, I am very experienced at it. I long ago lostcount of the number...”As Kahlan’s words trailed off, Cara considered her Agiel, rolling it in herfingers. “I guess there is even less than ‘little’ danger-with me there.”When they reached the richly carpeted and panelled corridor they were seeking,it was thick with soldiers and bristling with steel from swords, axes, andpikes. The man was being held in a small, elegant reading room close to therather simple one Richard liked to use for meeting with officers and forstudying the journal he had found in the Wizard’s Keep. The soldiers hadn’twanted to risk an escape attempt and had simply stuffed the man in the roomnearest to the spot they found him, pinning him down until it could be decidedwhat was to be done.Kahlan gently took the elbow of a soldier to urge him back out of the way. Themuscles of his bare arm felt as hard as iron. His pike, pointed toward theclosed door, could hardly have been more steady had it been embedded in granite.There had to be fifty pikes likewise aimed at the silent door. More men,gripping swords or axes, hunkered beneath the pike points.The guard turned as Kahlan tugged on his arm. “Let me through, soldier.”The man gave way. Others glanced back and began moving aside. Cara shoulderedher way ahead of Kahlan, pushing men out of the way. They did so reluctantly,not out of disrespect, but out of concern for the danger that waited beyond thedoor. Even as they moved aside, they kept their weapons pointed toward the thickoak door.Inside, the window-less, dimly lit room smelled of leather and sweat. A lankyman squatted on the edge of an embroidered footstool. He seemed too spare,should he make the wrong move, to permit all the steel aimed at him to find avirgin patch to penetrate. His young eyes dithered among the steel and grimglares until he caught sight of Kahlan’s approaching white dress. His tonguedarted out to wet his lips as he looked up expectantly.When the burly soldiers in leather and chain mail behind him saw Kahlan and Caraforcing their way into the room, one of them landed the side of his boot on thesmall of the young man’s back, pitching him forward.“Kneel, you filthy cur.”The young man, dressed in an outsized soldier’s uniform that looked to have beenscrounged together from dissimilar sources, peered up at Kahlan, then over hisshoulder at the man who had kicked him. He ducked his head of dishevelled darkhair and shielded it with a gangly arm, expecting a blow.“That’s enough,” Kahlan said in a quietly authoritative tone. “Cara and I wishto speak with him. All of you wait outside, please.”The soldiers balked, reluctant to lift a weapon from the young man cowering onthe floor.“You heard her,” Cara said. “Out.”“But-” an officer began.“You doubt that a Mord-Sith is capable of handling this one scrawny man? Now, gowait outside.”Kahlan was surprised that Cara hadn’t raised her voice. Mord-Sith didn’t have toraise their voices to get people to follow their orders, but still it surprisedher, considering Cara’s nervousness over the young man before them. The menbegan withdrawing, turning sideways to eye the intruder on the floor as theyfiled out the door. The knuckles of the officer’s fist around his sword hiltwere white. As he backed out last, he gently closed the door with his otherhand.The young man looked up from under his arm to the two women standing threestrides away. “Are you going to have me killed?”Kahlan didn’t answer the question directly. “We have come to talk with you. I amKahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor-”“Mother Confessor!” He straightened on his knees. A boyish grin swept onto hisface. “Why, you’re beautiful! I never expected you to be so beautiful.”He put a hand to a knee and began to rise. Cara’s Agiel was instantly at theready.“Stay where you are.”He froze, staring at the red Agiel before his face, and then lowered the kneeback onto the fringe of the crimson carpet. Lamps on the fluted mahoganypilasters supporting shallow pediments over bookcases to each side of the roomcast flickering light across his bony face. He was hardly more than a boy.“Can I have my weapons back, please? I need my sword. If I can’t have that, thenI’d like my knife, at least.”Cara heaved an irritated sigh, but Kahlan spoke first. “You are in a veryprecarious position, young man. None of us is in the mood to be indulgent ifthis is some kind of prank.”He nodded earnestly. “I understand. I’m not playing a game. I swear.”“Then tell me what you said to the soldiers.”His grin returned as he lifted a hand, gesturing casually toward the door.“Well, like I was telling those men when I was-”Fists at her side, Kahlan advanced a stride. “I told you, this is no game!You’re only alive by my grace! I want to know what you’re doing here, and I wantto know right now! Tell me what you said!”The young man blinked. “I’m an assassin, sent by Emperor Jagang. I’m here tokill Richard Rahl. Can you direct me to him, please?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2“Now,” Cara said in a dangerous voice, “can I kill him?”The incongruous nature of this harmless-looking, skinny young man, kneeling,seemingly helpless, in enemy territory, surrounded by hundreds, thousands ofbrutish D’Haran soldiers, saying so openly and confidently that he intended toassassinate Richard, had Kahlan’s heart hammering against her ribs.No one was this foolish.She realized, only after the fact, that she had retreated a step. She ignoredCara’s question and kept her attention riveted on the young man.“And just how do you think you could accomplish such a task?”“Well,” he said in an offhanded manner as he exhaled, “I had designs on using mysword, or if I must, my knife.” His smile returned, but it was no longer boyish.His eyes had taken on a steely set that belied his young face. “That’s why Ineed them back, you see.”“You’ll not be getting your weapons back.”Disdain powered the dismissive shrug of his shoulders. “No matter. I have otherways to kill him.”“You’ll not be killing Richard; you have my word on that. Your only hope, now,is to cooperate and tell us everything of your plan. How did you get in here?”His smirk mocked her. “Walked. Walked right in. No one paid me any mind. They’renot too smart, your men.”“They’re smart enough to have you under their swords,” Cara pointed out.He ignored her. His eyes remained locked on Kahlan’s.“And if we don’t let you have your sword and knife back,” she asked, “thenwhat?”“Then things will get messy. Richard Rahl will only suffer greatly. That’s whyEmperor Jagang sent me: to offer him the mercy of a quick death. The emperor isa man of compassion, and wishes to avoid any undue suffering; he is basically aman of peace, the dream walker, but also one of iron determination.“I’m afraid I’ll have to be killing you, too, Mother Confessor: to spare you thesuffering of what’s to come if you resist. I have to admit, though, that I don’tlike the idea of killing such a beautiful woman.” The grin widened. “Rather awaste.”Kahlan found his confidence grating. To hear him claim that the dream walker wascompassionate turned her stomach. She knew better.“What suffering?”He spread his hands. “I am but a grain of sand. The emperor does not share hisplans with me. I am but simply sent to do his bidding. His bidding is that youand Richard are to be eliminated. If you don’t let me kill him mercifully, thenRichard will be destroyed. I’m told that it won’t be pleasant, so why don’t youjust let me get it over with?”“You must be dreaming,” Cara said.His gaze shifted to the Mord-Sith. “Dreaming? Maybe you’re dreaming. Maybe I’myour worst nightmare.”“I don’t have nightmares,” Cara said. “I give them.”“Really?” he taunted. “In that ridiculous outfit? What are you pretending to be,anyway? Maybe you’re dressed like that to scare the birds away from the springplanting?”Kahlan realized that the man didn’t know what a Mord-Sith was, but she wonderedhow she could ever have thought he looked hardly more than a boy; his demeanorwas one of age and experience. This was no boy. The air crackled with peril.Remarkably, Cara only smiled.Kahlan’s breathing stilled when she realized the man was standing, and shecouldn’t recall seeing him come to his feet.His gaze shifted, and one of the lamps went dark. The remaining lamp cast harsh,flickering light against one side of his face, letting the other side hide inshadow, but, for Kahlan, that act had brought his nature, his true threat, outof the shadows.This man commanded the gift.Her resolve to spare a possible innocent unnecessary violence evaporated withthe heat of need to protect Richard. This man had been given a chance; now hewas going to confess all he knew-he was going to confess it to a Confessor.She had but to touch him, and it would be over.Kahlan had walked among the thousands of corpses of innocent people slaughteredby the Order. When she had seen the women and children in Ebinissia, butcheredat Jagang’s command, she had sworn undying vengeance against the Imperial Order.This man had proven himself to be part of the Imperial Order, and the enemy offree people. He did the dream walker’s bidding.She focused on the familiar flush of magic deep within herself, always at theready. A Confessor’s magic wasn’t released so much as her restraint on it wassimply withdrawn. The act was faster even than thought. It was the lightning ofinstinct.No Confessor enjoyed using her power to destroy a person’s mind, but unlike someConfessors, Kahlan didn’t hate what she did, what she was born to; it was simplypart of who she was. She didn’t maliciously use what she was given, but used hermagic to protect others. She was at peace with herself, with what she was andwhat she could do.Richard was the first to see her for herself, and care about her despite herpower. He didn’t irrationally fear the unknown, fear what she was. Instead, hehad come to know her, and to love her, Confessor’s power and all. For thatreason only, he could be with her without her power destroying him when theyshared their love.She intended to use that power, now, to protect Richard, and for that reason itwas as close as she ever came to valuing her ability. She had but to touch thisman and the threat would be eliminated. Retribution was at hand for a willingminion of Emperor Jagang.Keeping her gaze firmly fixed on the man, Kahlan held up an admonishing fingerto Cara. “He’s mine. Leave this to me.”But when his squinting gaze sought the remaining lamp, Cara swept between them.The air cracked as she backhanded him with her armored glove. Kahlan nearlyscreamed in rage at the interference.Sprawled across the carpet, the man sat up, looking genuinely surprised. Bloodran down his chin from a split in his lower lip. His look changed to genuinedispleasure.Cara towered over him. “What is your name?” Kahlan couldn’t believe that Cara,who had always professed to fear magic, seemed to be deliberately provoking aman who had just shown his command of it.He rolled away from her and into a crouch. His eyes were on Kahlan, but he spoketo Cara. “I don’t have time for court buffoons.”With a smile, his gaze flicked to the lamp. The room plunged into darkness.Kahlan dove for the spot on the floor where he hunkered. She had but to touchhim and it would be over.She caught only air before hitting the empty floor. In the pitch black, shewasn’t sure which way he had darted. She snatched wildly, trying to net a partof him. She needed but to touch him, and even his thick clothes wouldn’t protecthim. She seized an arm, and only an instant before releasing her power realizedthat it was the leather Cara wore.“Where are you!” Cara growled. “You can’t get away. Give it up.”Kahlan scrambled across the carpet. Power or not, they needed light, or theywere going to be in a great deal of trouble. She found the bookcase against thewall and felt along its lower ledge until she saw a faint sliver of light comingfrom beneath the door. Men were banging on the other side, calling out, wantingto know if there was trouble.Her fingers skimmed up the edge of the molded stile of the door, toward thehandle, as she lurched to her feet. She stepped on the hem of her dress andtripped, stumbling forward, landing on her elbows with a bone-jarring thud.Something heavy smashed into the door where she had almost stood a momentbefore, and crashed down onto her back. The man laughed in the darkness. As sheflailed to shove the thing off, her arms whacked painfully against the sharpedges of the stretcher bars of a chair’s legs. She grappled an upholsteredarmrest and rolled the chair off to the side.Kahlan heard the air driven from Cara’s lungs with a grunt as she slammed into abookcase on the other side of the room. The men on the other side of the doorpounded into it, trying to break it down. The door wasn’t budging.As books across the room were still tumbling and thudding to the floor, Kahlansprang up and groped for the handle. Her knuckles struck the cold metal of thelever. She slapped her hand over it.With a shriek, she was thrown back from a sudden flash and landed on her bottom.Like sparks from a flaming log struck with a poker, a shower of flashes from thehandle filled the air. Her fingers stung and tingled from touching the shield.Small wonder the men couldn’t open the door. As she regained her feet,recovering from the shock, Kahlan could see again by the flickering sparkles oflight that still slowly drifted toward the floor.Suddenly Cara could see, too. She snatched a book and flung it at the man nearthe center of the small room. He ducked into a squat.Quick as a slap, Cara spun, catching him off guard. The air resounded with ahard thud as her boot nailed his jaw. The blow drove him backward. Kahlan tookaim to leap for him before all the sparks extinguished and it went dark again.“You die first!” he railed in rage at Cara. “I’ll have no more of your triflinginterference! You’ll taste my power!”The air at his fingertips lit with glimmering flashes as he levelled his fullattention on Cara. Kahlan had to deal with the threat now, before anything elsewent wrong.But before she could leap for him, his curled fingers twitched up. With acontemptuous sneer, he thrust one hand toward Cara.Kahlan expected Cara to be the one on the floor next. Instead, the young mancrumpled with a cry. He tried to stand, but collapsed with a shriek, hugginghimself as if he had been stabbed in the gut. The room went black again.Kahlan reached for the door lever, taking a chance that whatever Cara had doneto him had broken his shield. Wincing against the pain she feared might still bewaiting, she seized the handle. The shield was gone. Relieved, she twisted thelever and yanked the door open. Light from behind the crowd of soldiers piercedinto the dark room. Confounded faces peered in.Kahlan didn’t need a roomful of men getting themselves killed while trying tosave her from things they didn’t understand. She shoved the closest man back.“He has the gift! Stay out!” She knew that D’Harans feared magic. They dependedon the Lord Rahl to fight magic. They were the steel against steel, they oftensaid, and Lord Rahl was supposed to be the magic against magic. “Give me alamp!”Men to each side simultaneously snatched lamps from brackets beside the door andheld them out. Kahlan grabbed one and kicked the door shut as she turned back tothe room. She didn’t want a pack of muscle-bound, weapon-wielding men to get inher way.In the wavering glow from the lamp, Kahlan saw Cara squat down on the crimsoncarpet beside the man. He clutched his arms across his abdomen as he vomitedblood. Her red leather outfit creaked as she rested her forearms on her knees.She was rolling her Agiel in her fingers, waiting.Once his retching had ceased, Cara snatched a fistful of his hair. Her longblond braid slid across the back of her broad shoulders as she leaned closer.“That was a big mistake. A very big mistake,” she said with silky satisfaction.“You should never have tried to use your magic against a Mord-Sith. You had itright for a moment, but then you let me make you angry enough to use your magic.Who’s the fool now?”“What’s... a... Mord-Sith?” he managed between gasps.Cara twisted his head upward until he cried out. “Your worst nightmare. Thepurpose of a Mord-Sith is to eliminate threats like you.“I now command your magic. It’s mine to use, and you, my pet, are helpless to doanything about it, as you will soon learn. You should have tried to strangle me,or beat me to death, or to run, but you should never, ever, have tried to usemagic against me. Once you use your magic against a Mord-Sith, it’s hers.”Kahlan stood transfixed. That was what a Mord-Sith had done to Richard. That washow he had been captured.Cara pressed her Agiel against the man’s ribs. He shivered as he screamed. Bloodsoaked through his tunic in a spreading stain.“Now, when I ask a question,” she said in a quiet, authoritative tone, “I expectan answer. Do you understand?”He remained silent. She twisted the Agiel. Kahlan winced when she heard his ribpop. He flinched and gasped, holding his breath, unable to scream.Kahlan felt as if she were frozen in place, unable to move a muscle. Richard hadtold her that Denna, the Mord-Sith who had captured him, had liked to crack hisribs. It made each breath agony, and screaming, which she soon provoked,excruciating torture. It also left the victim that much more helpless.Cara rose. “Stand.”The man staggered to his feet.“You are about to find out why I wear blood red leather.” Unleashing a mightyswing, launched with an angry cry, Cara clouted his face with her armored fist.As he went down, blood sprayed across the bookcase. As soon as he hit the floor,she straddled him, a boot to each side of his hips.“I can see what you’re envisioning,” Cara told him. “I saw the vision of whatyou want to do to me. Naughty boy.” She stomped a boot down on his sternum.“That was the least of what you will suffer for that thought. You had betterlearn real fast to keep ideas of resistance out of your mind. Got it?”She bent and drove her Agiel into his gut. “Got it?”His scream sent a shiver up Kahlan’s spine. She was sickened by what she waswatching, having once felt the profoundly painful touch of an Agiel, but worse,knowing that this was what had been done to Richard, and yet she didn’t make amove to stop it.She had offered this man mercy. If he had had his way, he would have killedRichard. He had promised to kill her, too, but it was that threat againstRichard that kept her silent, and prevented her from stopping Cara.“Now.” Cara said with a sneer. She jabbed her Agiel against his cracked rib.“What is your name?”“Marlin Pickard!” He tried to blink away the tears. A sheen of sweat covered hisface. Blood frothed at his mouth as he panted.She pressed her Agiel against his groin. Marlin’s feet kicked out helplessly ashe wailed.“The next time I ask a question, don’t make me wait for an answer. And you willaddress me as Mistress Cara.”“Cara,” Kahlan said in a quiet tone, still seeing the vision of Richard in placeof the man, “there is no need to...”Cara looked over her shoulder, glaring with cold blue eyes. Kahlan turned awayand with trembling fingers wiped a tear as it rolled down her cheek. She liftedthe glass chimney of the lamp on the wall and used the one she held to light it.When the wick took to flame, she set her lamp down on a side table and replacedits chimney. It was frightening to see the cold look in those Mord-Sith eyes.Her heart pounded at the thought of how many weeks Richard had seen only coldeyes like that looking back as he begged for mercy.Kahlan turned back to the pair. “We need answers, nothing more.”“I’m getting answers.”Kahlan nodded. “I understand, but we don’t need the screams along with them. Wedon’t torture people.”“Torture? I have not yet even begun to torture him.” Cara straightened, castinga glance to the shivering man at her feet. “And if he had managed to kill LordRahl first? Would you wish me to leave him be, then?”“Yes.” Kahlan met the woman’s eyes. “And then I would have done worse to himmyself. Worse than you could even conceive of. But he didn’t hurt Richard.”A cunning smile curled the comers of Cara’s mouth. “He intended it. The canon ofthe spirits says that intent is guilt. Failure to successfully carry out theintent does not absolve the guilt.”“The spirits also mark a distinction between intent and deed. It was my intentto take care of him, in my way. Was it your intent to disobey my direct order?”Cara flicked her blond braid back over her shoulder. “It was my intent toprotect you and Lord Rahl. I have succeeded.”“I told you to let me handle it.”“Hesitation can be the end of you... or those you care about.” A haunted lookpassed across Cara’s face. Iron quickly repossessed her countenance. “I havelearned never to hesitate.”“Is that why you were provoking him? To get him to attack you with his magic?”With the heel of her hand, Cara wiped the blood from a deep cut on her cheek- acut Marlin had given her when he had struck her and slammed her into thebookcase. She stepped closer. “Yes.” She took a long lick of the blood from herhand while watching Kahlan’s eyes. “A Mord-Sith can’t take a person’s magicunless they attack us with it.”“I thought you feared magic.”Cara tugged the sleeve of her leather, straightening it down her arm. “We do,unless it is specifically used by the one who commands it to attack us. Thenit’s ours.”“You always claim not to know anything about magic, and yet now you command his?You can use his magic?”Cara glanced down at the man groaning on the floor. “No. I can’t use it, like heuses it, but I can turn it against him-hurt him with his own magic.” Her browtwitched. “Sometimes, we feel a bit of it, but we don’t understand it the wayLord Rahl understands it, and so we can’t use it. Except to give them pain.”Kahlan couldn’t reconcile such contradictions. “How?”She was struck by how much Cara’s emotionless expression was like a Confessor’sface, the face Kahlan’s mother had taught her, showing nothing of the innerfeelings about what had to be done.“Our minds are linked,” Cara explained, “through the magic, so I can see whathe’s thinking when he is thinking of hurting me or fighting back, or disobeyingmy orders, because it contradicts my wishes. Since we are linked to their mindsthrough their magic, our will to hurt them makes it happen.” She looked down atMarlin. He suddenly cried out anew in agony. “See?”“I see. Now stop it. If he refuses to give us answers, then you can... do whatit takes, but I won’t sanction doing anything that isn’t required to protectRichard.”Kahlan looked up from Marlin’s torment to Cara’s cold blue eyes. She spokebefore she thought. “Did you know Denna?”“Everyone knew Denna.”“And was she as good at... at torturing people as you?”“Me?” Cara said with a laugh. “No one was as good at it as Denna. That’s why shewas Darken Rahl’s favourite. I could hardly believe the things she could do to aman. Why, she could...”With a glance at the Agiel hanging at Kahlan’s neck-Denna’s Agiel-Cara suddenlycaught the meaning behind Kahlan’s questions.“That was in the past. We were bonded to Darken Rahl. We did as we werecommanded. We are bonded to Richard, now. We would never hurt him. We would dieto keep anyone from hurting Lord Rahl.” Her tone lowered to a whisper. “LordRahl not only killed Denna, but he also forgave her for what she did to him.”Kahlan nodded. “So he did. But I have not. Though I understand how she did asshe was trained and commanded, and her spirit has been a comfort and an aid toboth of us, and I appreciate the sacrifices she has since made on our behalf, inmy heart I can’t forgive her for the horrifying things she did to the man Ilove.”Cara studied Kahlan’s eyes a long moment. “I understand. If you ever hurt LordRahl, I would never forgive you, either. Nor would I ever grant you mercy.”Kahlan held the woman’s gaze. “Likewise. It is said that, for a Mord-Sith, thereis no worse death to be had than by the touch of a Confessor.”A slow smile came to Cara’s lips. “So I have been told.”“It’s fortunate we’re on the same side. As I’ve said, there are things I won’t,I can’t, forgive. I love Richard more than life itself.”“Every Mord-Sith knows that the worst pain comes from one you love.”“Richard need never fear that pain.”Cara seemed to consider her words carefully. “Darken Rahl never had to fear thatkind of pain; he never loved a woman. Lord Rahl does. I have noticed that wherelove is concerned, things sometimes have a way of changing.”So that was the heart of the matter.“Cara, I could no more hurt Richard than could you. I would lay down my lifefirst. I love him.”“As do I,” Cara said, “if in a different way, but with no less ferocity. LordRahl freed us. In his place, anyone else would have had every Mord-Sith put todeath. He instead has given us a chance to live up to his expectations.”Cara shifted her weight to her other foot as her eyes withdrew their coldassessment. “Perhaps Richard is the only one of us to understand the goodspirits’ principles-that we can’t truly love until we forgive another theirworst crimes against us.”Kahlan felt her face flush at Cara’s words. She never thought of a Mord-Sith ashaving such depth of understanding in matters of compassion. “Was Denna afriend?” Cara nodded. “And has your heart forgiven Richard for killing her?”“Yes, but that’s different,” Cara admitted. “I understand the way you feel aboutDenna. I don’t blame you. In your place, I would feel the same.”Kahlan stared off. “When I told Denna-her spirit-that I couldn’t forgive her,she said that she understood, and that the only forgiveness she needed hadalready been granted. She told me that she loved Richard-that even in death sheloved him.” Just as Richard had seen in Kahlan the woman behind the magic, hehad seen in Denna the person behind the fearsome persona of a Mord-Sith. Kahlancould understand Denna’s feelings at having someone finally see her for herself.“Perhaps the forgiveness of one you love is the only thing in life that reallymatters-the only thing that can truly heal your heart, heal your soul.”Kahlan watched her finger as she traced the scoop of a curled leaf carved in thebanding of the tabletop. “But I could never forgive anyone who hurt him.”“And have you forgiven me?”Kahlan looked up. “For what?”Cara’s fist tightened on her Agiel. Kahlan knew that it hurt a Mord-Sith to holdher Agiel in her hand-part of the paradox of being a giver of pain. “For beingMord-Sith.”“Why should I have to forgive you that?”Cara looked away. “Because if Darken Rahl had commanded me instead of Denna totake Richard, I would have been as merciless as she. As would Berdine, or Raina,or any of the rest.”“I told you, the spirits mark a distinction between the might have been and thedeed. So do I. You cannot be held responsible for what others have done to you,any more than I can be held answerable because I was born a Confessor, and nomore than Richard can be held guilty because that murderous Darken Rahl fatheredhim.”Still Cara didn’t look up. “But will you ever truly trust us?”“You have already proven yourselves, in Richard’s eyes, and in mine. You are notDenna, nor responsible for her choices.” With a thumb, Kahlan wiped oozing bloodfrom Cara’s cheek. “Cara, if I didn’t trust you, all of you, would I allowBerdine and Raina, two of you, to be alone with Richard right now?”Cara glanced again to Denna’s Agiel. “In the battle with the Blood of the Fold,I saw the way you fought to protect Lord Rahl, as well as the people of thecity. To be Mord-Sith is to understand that you must sometimes be merciless.Though you are not Mord-Sith, I have seen that you understand this. You are aworthy guardian to Lord Rahl. You are the only woman I know worthy of wearing anAgiel.“Though to you that may sound reprehensible, in my eyes, it is an honour thatyou wear an Agiel. Its ultimate purpose is to protect our master.”Kahlan offered a sincere smile, understanding Cara just a little bit better thanshe had before. She wondered what the woman behind the appellation had been likebefore she was captured and trained to become a Mord-Sith. Richard had told herthat it was a horror far beyond anything that had been done to him.“In my eyes, too, because Richard gave it to me. I am his protector, as are you.In that way, we are sisters of the Agiel.”Cara smiled her approval.“Does this mean that you’ll follow our orders for a change?” Kahlan asked.“We always follow your orders.”With a wry smile, Kahlan shook her head.Cara nodded toward the man on the floor. “He will answer your questions, as Ipromised you before, Mother Confessor. I won’t practice my skills on him anymore than is necessary.”Kahlan squeezed Cara’s arm in sorrow and sympathy for the warped role thewoman’s life had been twisted into by others. “Thank you, Cara.”Kahlan turned her attention to Marlin and the problem at hand. “Let’s try itagain. What were your plans?”He glared up at her. Cara shoved him with a foot.“You answer truthfully, or I’ll start finding some nice, tender places for myAgiel. Understand?”“Yes.”Cara squatted down, fanning her Agiel before his face. “Yes, Mistress Cara.” Thesudden threat in her tone seemed to annul everything she had just said. Itfrightened even Kahlan.Wide-eyed, he swallowed. “Yes, Mistress Cara.”“That’s better. Now, answer the Mother Confessor’s question.”“My plans were as I told you: to kill Richard Rahl and you.”“How long ago did Jagang give you these orders?”“Nearly two weeks.”Well, there was that. It could be that Jagang had been killed at the Palace ofthe Prophets when Richard destroyed it. That was what they had been hoping,anyway. Perhaps he had given the orders before he was killed.“What else?” Kahlan asked.“Nothing else. I was to use my talent to get in here and kill the both of you,that’s all.”Cara landed a kick on his cracked rib. “Don’t lie to us!”Kahlan gently pushed Cara back and knelt beside the choking, gasping young man.“Marlin, don’t mistake my distaste for torture as a lack of resolve. If youdon’t start telling me what I want to know,” she whispered, “I’m going to go fora long walk and then to dinner and I’m going to leave you in here all alone withCara. Crazy as she is, I’ll leave you alone with her. And then, when I comeback, if you still think to hold out on me, I’m going to use my power on you,and you can’t even imagine how much worse that will be. Cara can’t even comeclose to what I can do; she can use your magic and your mind. I can destroy it.Is that what you want?”He shook his head as he clutched his ribs. “Please,” he begged, tears welling upagain, “don’t. I’ll answer your questions... but I don’t really know anything.Emperor Jagang comes to me in my dreams and tells me what to do. I know the costof failure. I do as I’m told.” He paused to gasp a sob. “He told me to... tocome here and kill you both. He told me to find a soldier’s uniform, andweapons, and to come kill you both. He uses wizards, and sorceresses, to do hisbidding.”Kahlan stood, puzzling over Marlin’s words. He seemed to have reverted to beinghardly more than a boy. Something was missing, but she couldn’t imagine what itcould be. It made sense on the surface-Jagang sending an assassin-but somethingdeeper didn’t tally. She paced to the side table with the lamp and leaned a hipagainst it. With her back to Marlin, she rubbed her throbbing temples.Cara inched close. “Are you all right?”Kahlan nodded. “This worry is just giving me a headache, that’s all.”“Maybe you could have Lord Rahl kiss it and make it better.”Kahlan chuckled silently at Cara’s concerned frown. “That would work.” She wavedher hands in the air as if shooing a gnat, trying to chase away the doubts. “Itdoesn’t make any sense.”“The dream walker trying to kill his enemy doesn’t make sense?”“Well, think about it.” She glanced over her shoulder to see Marlin hugging hisribs and rocking on the floor. His eyes, even when they were filled with terror,and even, as now, when he wasn’t looking her way, for some reason made her skincrawl. She turned back to Cara and lowered her voice. “Surely Jagang had to knowthat one man, even a wizard, would fail at such a task. Richard would recognizea man with the gift, and besides, there are too many people here who would beonly too ready to kill an intruder.”“But still, with his gift, he might have a chance. Jagang wouldn’t care if theman was killed. He has an abundance of others to do his bidding.”Kahlan’s thoughts flicked about, trying to pick out the nettle of a reasonbehind her itching doubt.“Even if he managed to kill some of them with his magic, there are still toomany. A whole army of mriswith failed to kill Richard. He can recognize one withthe gift, with magic, as a threat. He doesn’t know how to command his magic,much as you don’t understand how to control Marlin’s, beyond giving him painwith it, but his guard would be up, at the least.“This just doesn’t make any sense. Jagang is far from stupid; there has to bemore to it. He must have some plan to this. Something more than we’re seeing.”Cara clasped her hands behind her back as she took a deep breath. She turned.“Marlin.” His head came up, his eyes at attention. “What was Jagang’s plan?”“To have me kill Richard Rahl and the Mother Confessor.”“What else?” Kahlan asked. “What more was there to his plan?”His eyes flooded. “I don’t know. I swear. I told you as he ordered me. I was toget a soldier’s uniform and weapons so I would look like I belonged and couldget close. I was to kill you both.”Kahlan wiped a hand across her face. “We’re not asking the right questions.”“I don’t know what else there could be. He has admitted the worst of it. He toldus his goal. What more could there be?”“I don’t know, but there’s something still itching at me.” Kahlan sighed inresignation. “Maybe Richard can reason this out. He is the Seeker of Truth,after all. He’ll figure out what it means. Richard will know the right questionsto ask so that...”Kahlan’s head suddenly came up, her eyes wide. She advanced a long stride towardthe man on the floor.“Marlin, did Jagang also tell you to announce yourself when you arrived?”“Yes. Once inside the palace, I was to give my reason for being here.”Kahlan stiffened. She snatched Cara’s arm and pulled her close while keeping hereyes on Marlin. “Maybe we shouldn’t tell Richard about this. It’s toodangerous.”“I have Marlin’s power. He’s helpless.”Kahlan’s gaze darted about, hardly hearing what Cara had said. “We have to puthim somewhere safe. This room won’t do.” She put a thumbnail between her teeth.Cara frowned. “This room is as safe as anywhere. He can’t get away. He’s safe inhere.”Kahlan took her thumb from her mouth as she stared at the man rocking on thefloor.“No. We have to find someplace safer. I think we’ve made a big mistake. I thinkwe’re in a lot of trouble.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3“Let me just kill him,” Cara said. “I have but to touch him in the right placewith my Agiel and his heart will stop. He won’t suffer.”For the first time, Kahlan seriously considered Cara’s oft-repeated request.Though she had had to kill people before, and had ordered the execution ofothers, she dismissed the impulse. She had to think this through. For all sheknew, that could be Jagang’s true plan, though she couldn’t imagine what good itwould gain him. But he had to have some scheme to what he had ordered. He wasn’tstupid; he had to know that Marlin would be captured, at the least.“No,” Kahlan said. “We don’t know enough yet. For all we know, that could be theworst thing we could do. We can’t do anything else until we think it throughcarefully. We’ve already walked into a swamp without pausing to think aboutwhere we were going.”Cara sighed at the familiar refusal. “Then what do you wish to do?”“I don’t know yet. Jagang had to know he would be captured, at the least, yet heordered it. Why? We have to figure this out. Until we do, we have to put himsomewhere safe, where he can’t escape and hurt anyone.”“Mother Confessor,” Cara said with exaggerated patience, “he cannot escape. Ihave control of his power. Believe me, I know how to control a person when Ihave domination over their magic. I have had an abundance of experience. He isincapable of doing anything against my wishes. Here, let me show you.”She threw open the door. Surprised men reached for weapons as they gazed aroundthe room in silent, professional appraisal. With the extra light from beyond thedoor, Kahlan could see the true extent of the mess. A spray of blood crossed thebookcase at an angle. Blood soaked the crimson carpet, the spongy, reddishblotch extending past the perimeter of gold banding. Marlin’s face was a bloodysight. The side of his beige tunic was dark with a wet stain.“You,” Cara said. “Give me your sword.” The blond-haired soldier drew his weaponand handed it over without hesitation. “Now,” she announced, “all of you listento me. I’m going to give the Mother Confessor here, a demonstration of the powerof a Mord-Sith. If any of you go against my orders, you will answer to me” -shegestured back to Marlin-”just like he did.”After another glance at the miserable man on the floor, some men nodded and therest voiced their consent.Cara pointed with the sword at Marlin. “If he can make it to the door, you allare to let him go-he is to have his freedom.” The men grumbled objections.“Don’t argue with me!”The D’Haran soldiers fell silent. A Mord-Sith was trouble enough, but when shehad command of a person’s magic she was something altogether beyond trouble: shewas dealing in magic, and they had no desire to stick their finger in a cauldronof dark sorcery stirred by an angry Mord-Sith.Cara strode over to Marlin and held the sword down to him, hilt first. “Takeit.” Marlin hesitated, then snatched the sword when she frowned in warning.Cara looked up at Kahlan. “We always let our captives keep their weapons. It’s aconstant reminder to them that they are helpless, that even their weapons willdo them no good against us.”“I know,” Kahlan said in a small voice. “Richard told me.”Cara motioned Marlin to his feet. When he didn’t move fast enough for her, shepunched his cracked rib.“What are you waiting for! Get up! Now, go stand over there.”After he had moved off the carpet, she grasped the corner and flung it aside.She pointed at the polished wood floor and snapped her fingers. Marlin scurriedto the spot, grunting in pain with each step.Cara snatched him by the scruff of his neck and bent him over. “Spit.”Marlin coughed blood and spat on the floor at his feet. Cara hauled him upstraight, seized the neck of his tunic, and yanked his face close.She gritted her teeth. “Now, you listen. You know the kind of pain I can giveyou if you displease me. Do you need another demonstration?”He vigorously shook his head. “No, Mistress Cara.”“Good boy. Now, when I tell you to do something, that is what I wish you to do.If you do otherwise, if you go against my orders, my wishes, your magic willtwist your guts like a washrag. As long as you continue to go against my wishes,the pain will only get worse. I won’t let the magic kill you, but you will wishotherwise. You will beg me to kill you in order to escape the pain. I don’tgrant my pets’ requests for death.”Marlin’s face had gone ashen.“Now, stand on that spot of your spit.” Marlin moved both feet onto the redsplat. Cara gripped his jaw in one hand and pointed her Agiel at his face.“My wish is for you to stand right there, on that spot of your spit, until Itell you otherwise. You are never to so much as lift a finger to harm me, oranyone else, ever again. That is my wish. Do you understand? Do you fullyunderstand my wishes?”He nodded, as best he could the way her hand clamped his jaw. “Yes, MistressCara. I would never hurt you-I swear. You want me to stand on my spit until yougive me permission to do otherwise.” Tears welled up anew. “I won’t move, Iswear. Please don’t hurt me.”Cara shoved his face away. “You disgust me. Men who break as easily as youdisgust me. I’ve had girls last longer under my Agiel,” she muttered. Shepointed behind. “Those men won’t hurt you. They will do nothing to stop you. Ifyou get to the door, against my wishes, you are free and the pain will be gone.”She glared at the soldiers. “You all heard me, didn’t you? If he reaches thedoor, he’s free.” The soldiers nodded. “If he kills me, he’s free.”This time they didn’t agree until Cara yelled her order again. Cara turned herhot glare to Kahlan. “That includes you. If he kills me, or if he makes thedoor, he’s free.”No matter how improbable, Kahlan wouldn’t agree to such a thing. Marlin wantedto kill Richard. “Why are you doing this?”“Because you need to understand. You need to trust my word.”Kahlan forced out a breath. “Get on with it,” she said, without agreeing to theterms.Cara turned her back to Marlin and folded her arms. “You know my wishes, my pet.If you wish to escape, this is your chance. You reach the door, and you’re free.If you want to kill me for what I’ve done to you, now’s your chance for that,too.”“You know,” she added, “I don’t think I’ve seen nearly enough of your blood.When we’re done with all this nonsense, I’m going to take you somewhere private,where the Mother Confessor won’t be around to intercede on your behalf, I’mgoing to spend the rest of the afternoon and night punishing you with my Agiel,just because I’m in the mood. I’m going to make you regret the day you wereborn.”She shrugged. “Unless, of course, you kill me, or escape.”The soldiers stood mute. The room exuded a heavy silence as Cara waited with herarms folded. Marlin carefully looked around, studying the soldiers, Kahlan, andCara’s back. His fingers worked on the hilt of the sword, drawing it tighterinto his grip. His eyes narrowed as he considered.Watching Cara’s back, he finally took a small, tentative step to the side.To Kahlan, it looked as if an invisible club had whacked him in the gut. Hedoubled over with a grunt. A low groan wheezed from his throat. With a cry ofeffort, he dived for the door.He hit the floor screaming. He clutched his abdomen with both arms as hewrithed. With fingers curled in agony, he threw himself out flat on the floorand tried to claw his way to the door. It was still a goodly distance. Each inchhe gained racked him with ever worse convulsions of pain. Kahlan winced at hispanting screams.In a last, desperate effort, he snatched up the sword again and staggered to hisfeet, straightening partially, lifting the sword above his head. Kahlan tensed.Even if he couldn’t make his arms do his bidding, he could fall and cleave Cara.The risk to Cara was too great. Kahlan took an urgent step forward as Marlinbellowed and tried to bring the sword down to hack at Cara. Cara, watchingKahlan, held up an admonishing finger, stopping Kahlan where she stood.Behind her. Martin’s sword clattered to the floor as he crumpled, holding hisstomach as he shrieked. He crashed to the floor, his distress obviously growingprecipitously with each moment as he writhed on the polished wood floor like afish out of water.“What did I tell you, Marlin?” Cara asked in a quiet voice. “What are mywishes?”He seemed to grasp the meaning of her words as if they were from a personyelling as he threw a lifeline to a drowning man. His frantic gaze hunted thefloor. Finally, he saw it. He clawed his way to the spot of his spit, moving asquickly as the racking pain allowed. At last, he managed to stagger to his feet.He stood, fists at his side, still shaking and screaming.“Both feet, Marlin,” Cara said casually.He looked down and saw that only one foot was on the spit. He jerked the othercloser, onto the red spot.He sagged and finally fell silent. Kahlan felt herself sag with him. His eyesclosed, panting, dripping sweat, he stood trembling with the lingering effectsof the ordeal.Cara lifted an eyebrow to Kahlan. “Understand?”Kahlan scowled. Cara scooped up the sword and marched it over to the door. Asone, the soldiers all backed up a step. She held the sword out, hilt first.Reluctantly, its owner retrieved it.“Any questions, gentlemen?” Cara asked in an icy voice. “Good. Now stop bangingon the door when I’m busy.” She slammed the heavy door in their faces.Marlin’s lower lip sucked in and out over his teeth with each panting breath.Cara put her face close to his.“I don’t recall giving you permission to close your eyes. Did you hear me sayyou could close them?”His eyes opened wide. “No, Mistress Cara.”“Then what were they doing closed?”Marlin’s terror quavered through his voice. “I’m sorry, Mistress Cara. Pleaseforgive me. I won’t do it again.”“Cara.”She turned, as if she had forgotten Kahlan was even in the room. “What?”Kahlan tilted her head in gesture. “We need to talk.”“You see?” Cara asked, when she had joined Kahlan at the table with the lamp.“You see what I mean? He can’t hurt anyone. He can’t escape. No man has everescaped a Mord-Sith.”Kahlan lifted an eyebrow. “Richard did.”Cara straightened and let out a noisy breath. “Lord Rahl is different. This manis no Lord Rahl. Mord-Sith have proven themselves unerring thousands of times.No one but Lord Rahl ever killed his Mistress to reclaim his magic and escape.”“No matter how improbable, Richard has proven that Mord-Sith aren’t infallible.I don’t care how many thousands Mord-Sith have subjugated; the fact that oneescaped means that it’s possible. Cara, I’m not doubting you-it’s just that wecan’t take chances. Something’s wrong; why would Jagang throw this lamb in awolf’s lair, and specifically tell him to announce himself?”“But-”“It’s possible Jagang was killed-he might be dead and we have nothing tofear-but if he’s still alive, and anything goes wrong with Marlin, here, it willbe Richard who pays the price. Jagang wants Richard dead. Are you so stubbornthat you’re willing to put Richard at risk for the sake of your pride?”Cara scratched her neck as she considered. She took a quick glance over hershoulder at Marlin standing on the spot of his spit, his eyes wide open, sweatdripping off the end of his nose.“What do you want to do? This room has no windows. We can lock and bar the door.Where can we put him that would be safer than this room?”Kahlan pressed her fingers over the burning ache under her sternum.“The pit.”Kahlan twisted her fingers together as she came to a halt before the iron door.Marlin, looking like a frightened puppy, stood silently in the center of a knotof D’Haran soldiers a ways back up the torch-lit hall.“What’s the matter?” Cara asked.Kahlan flinched. “What?”“I asked what was the matter. You look like you’re afraid the door is going tobite you.”Kahlan pulled her hands apart and made herself put them at her sides. “Nothing.”She turned and lifted the ring with the keys from the iron peg in the coarsestonewall beside the door.Cara lowered her voice. “Don’t lie to a sister of the Agiel.”Kahlan mimicked a quick smile of apology. “The pit is where the condemned awaitexecution. I have a half sister-Cyrilla. She was the queen of Galea. When shewas here, when Aydindril fell to the Order, before Richard liberated the city,they threw her in the pit with a gang of about a dozen murderers.”“Have a half sister? She still lives, then?”Kahlan nodded as the mists of memories swirled before her mind’s eye. “But theyhad her down there for days. Prince Harold, her brother, my half brother,rescued her when they were taking her to the block to be beheaded, but she’snever been the same since. She’s withdrawn into herself. On rare occasions shecomes out of her stupor, and insists that the people need a queen able to leadthem and that I become the queen of Galea in her place. I agreed.” Kahlanpaused. “She screams inconsolably if she comes awake and sees men.”Cara, hands clasped behind her back, waited without comment.Kahlan gestured to the door. “They threw me down there, too.” Her mouth was sodry that it took two attempts before she could swallow. “With those men who hadraped her.” She surfaced from the memories and sneaked a quick glance at Cara.“But they didn’t do to me as they did to her.” She didn’t say how close they hadcome.A sly smile came to Cara’s lips. “How many did you kill?”“I didn’t stop to take an exact count as I escaped.” Her brief, flitting smilewouldn’t stick. “But it scared the wits out of me-being down there, alone, withall those beasts.” Kahlan’s heart pounded so hard at the memory that it made hersway on her feet.“Well,” Cara offered, “do you want to find another place to put Marlin?”“No.” Kahlan took a purging breath. “Look, Cara, I’m sorry I’m acting this way.”She peered briefly at Marlin. “There’s something about his eyes. Somethingstrange...”She looked back to Cara. “I’m sorry. It’s not like me to be so jittery. You’veonly known me a short time. I’m not usually so apprehensive. It’s just that... Iguess that it’s just because it’s been so peaceful for the last few days. I’vebeen separated from Richard for so long, and it’s been bliss being together. Wewere hoping Jagang was killed and that the war was ended. We were hoping he wasin the Palace of the Prophets when Richard destroyed it...”“He still might have been. Marlin said it’s been two weeks since Jagang gave himorders. Lord Rahl said Jagang wanted the palace; he was probably with his troopswhen they stormed it. He’s no doubt dead.”“We can hope. But I’m so afraid for Richard... I guess it’s affecting myjudgment. Now that things have come together, I’m terrified that it’s going toslip away from me.”Cara shrugged, as if to dispel Kahlan’s need for apology. “I know how you feel.Now that Lord Rahl has given us our freedom, we have something to fear losing.Maybe that’s why I’m so jittery, too.” She flicked her hand toward the door. “Wecould find another place. There have to be other places that won’t touch painfulmemories for you.”“No. Protecting Richard comes above all else. The pit is the safest place in thepalace to keep a prisoner. We have no one else down there, now. It’sescape-proof. I’m fine.”Cara lifted an eyebrow. “Escape-proof? You escaped.”The memories repressed, Kahlan smiled. With the back of her hand, she gaveCara’s stomach a dismissive slap.“Marlin is no Mother Confessor.” She glanced back up the hall at Marlin. “Butthere’s something about him-something I can’t put my finger on. Somethingstrange. He frightens me, and he shouldn’t, not with you controlling his gift.”“You are right, you shouldn’t be concerned. I have complete control of him. Nopet has ever slipped from my control. Ever.”Cara lifted the key ring from Kahlan’s hand and unlocked the door. With a tug,it drew open on rusty, squeaking hinges. Dank stench wafted up from the darknessbelow. The smell clenched Kahlan’s stomach muscles with the memories it carried.Cara took a nervous step back.“There aren’t any... rats, down there, are there?”“Rats?” Kahlan glanced to the dark maw. “No. There’s no way for them to get in.No rats. You’ll see.”Kahlan turned her attention to the soldiers back up the hall, waiting withMarlin, and gestured toward the long ladder resting on its side against the wallopposite the door. Once they had the ladder through the door and it had thuddeddown in place, Cara snapped her fingers and motioned Marlin forward. He scurriedto her without hesitation, anxious to avoid doing anything to displease her.“Take that torch and get down there,” Cara told him.Marlin pulled the torch from its rust -encrusted bracket and started down theladder. With a frown of puzzlement, Cara followed him down into the gloom whenKahlan motioned her to the ladder.Kahlan turned to the guards. “Sergeant Collins, you and your men wait up here,please.”“Are you sure, Mother Confessor?” the sergeant asked.“Are you eager to be down there, in a small space, with an ill-temperedMord-Sith, sergeant?”He hooked a thumb behind his weapons belt as he glanced at the opening into thepit. “We’ll wait up here, as you command.”Kahlan started backing down the ladder. “We’ll be fine.”The smooth stone blocks of the walls were so precisely dry-fit that there wasn’tso much as a fingernail hold to be had. Looking back over her shoulder, shecould see Marlin holding the torch, and Cara, waiting for her nearly twenty feetbelow. She carefully put a foot in each rung, mindful not to step on the hem ofher dress lest she fall.“Why are we down here with him?” Cara asked, as Kahlan stepped off the lastrung.Kahlan wiped her hands together, brushing off the grit from the ladder rungs.She took the torch from Marlin and went to the wall before them. She stretchedup on her toes and pushed the torch into one of the brackets on the wall.“Because on the way down here I thought of some more questions to ask him beforewe leave him here.”Cara glared at Marlin and pointed to the floor. “Spit.” She waited. “Now, standon it.”Marlin moved onto the spit, careful to get both feet on it. Cara eyed the emptyroom, checking the shadows in the corners. Kahlan wondered if she was makingsure the place really was free of rats.“Marlin,” Kahlan said. He licked his lips, waiting for her question. “When wasthe last time you received orders from Jagang?”“Like I told you before, it was about two weeks ago.”“And he’s not sought you out since then?”“No, Mother Confessor.”“If he was dead, would you know?”He didn’t hesitate with his answer. “I don’t know. He either comes to me, or hedoesn’t. I have no way of knowing of him between his calls.”“How does he come to you?”“In my dreams.”“And you’ve not dreamed of him since you say he last came to you a fortnightago?”“No, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan paced to the wall with the hissing torch and back as she thought. “Youdidn’t recognize me, when you first saw me.” He shook his head. “Would yourecognize Richard?”“Yes, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan frowned. “How? How would you know him?”“From the Palace of the Prophets. I was a student there. Richard was broughtthere by Sister Verna. I knew him from the palace.”“A student, at the Palace of the Prophets? Then you ... How old are you?”“Ninety-three, Mother Confessor.”No wonder he seemed so strange to her, sometimes like a boy and sometimesseeming to have the demeanor of an older man. That explained the sage bearing inhis young eyes. There was a presence about those eyes that didn’t fit hisyouthful frame. This would certainly explain it.The Palace of the Prophets trained boys in their gift. Ancient magic had aidedthe Sisters of the Light in their task by altering time at the palace so thatthey would have the time needed, in the absence of an experienced wizard, toteach the boys to control their magic.That was all ended, now. Richard had destroyed the palace and the prophecies,lest Jagang capture them. The prophecies would have aided him in his effort toconquer the world, and the palace would have given him hundreds of years to ruleover those he vanquished.Kahlan felt the weight of worry lift from her mind. “Now I know why I felt therewas something strange about him,” she said as she sighed her relief.Cara didn’t look so relieved. “Why did you announce yourself to the soldiersinside the Confessors’ Palace?”“Emperor Jagang didn’t explain his instructions. Mistress Cara.”“Jagang is from the Old World, and no doubt doesn’t know about Mord-Sith,” Carasaid to Kahlan. “He probably thought a wizard, like Marlin here, would be ableto announce himself, cause a panic, and wreak havoc.”Kahlan considered the supposition. “Could be. Jagang has the Sisters of the Darkas his puppets, so he would have been able to get information about Richard.Richard wasn’t at the palace long enough to learn much about his gift. TheSisters of the Dark would have told Jagang that Richard doesn’t know how to usehis magic. Richard is the Seeker, and knows how to use the Sword of Truth, buthe doesn’t know how to use his gift. Jagang might have thought to send in awizard, on the chance that he might succeed, and if he didn’t... so what? He hasothers.”“What do you think, my pet?”Marlin’s eyes filled with tears. “I don’t know, Mistress Cara. I don’t know. Hedidn’t tell me. I swear.” A tremor seeped from his jaw into his voice. “But itcould be. What the Mother Confessor says is true: he doesn’t care if we arekilled while performing a task. Our lives mean little to him.”Cara turned to Kahlan. “What else?”Kahlan shook her head. “I can’t think of anything else at the moment. I guess itcould all make sense. We’ll come back later, after I’ve thought about it. MaybeI’ll think of some other questions that might settle it.”Cara pointed her Agiel at his face. “You stand right there, on that spot of yourspit, until we come back. Whether it’s in two hours or two days, it doesn’tmatter. If you sit down, or any part of you, other than the soles of your feet,touches the floor, you will be down here all alone with the pain it brings forgoing against my wishes. Understand?”He blinked as a drop of sweat ran into his eye. “Yes, Mistress Cara.”“Cara, do you think it necessary that-”“Yes. I know my business. Let me do it. You yourself reminded me what was atstake and how we dared not take any chances.”Kahlan relented. “All right.”Kahlan took hold of a rung above her head and started up the ladder. On thesecond rung, she paused and looked back. Frowning, she stepped back off theladder.“Marlin, did you come to Aydindril alone?”“No, Mother Confessor.”Cara snatched the neck of his tunic. “What! You came with others?”“Yes, Mistress Cara.”“How many!”“With one other, Mistress Cara. She was a Sister of the Dark.”Kahlan’s fist joined Cara’s on his tunic. “What was her name!”Frightened by both women, he tried to back away a bit, but their grip on histunic wouldn’t allow it. “I don’t know her name,” he whined. “I swear.”“She was a Sister of the Dark, from the palace, where you lived for close to acentury, and you don’t know her name?” Kahlan asked.Marlin licked his lips, his gaze moving between the two women. “There werehundreds of Sisters at the Palace of the Prophets. There were rules. We hadteachers assigned to us. There were places we didn’t go, and Sisters we nevercame in contact with, like those who handled administration. I didn’t know themall, I swear. I saw her before, at the palace, but I didn’t know her name, andshe didn’t tell me.”“Where is she now!”Marlin shook in terror. “I don’t know! I haven’t seen her for days, since I cameto the city.”Kahlan gritted her teeth. “What did she look like, then?”Marlin licked his lips again as his gaze flicked back and forth between the twowomen. “I don’t know. I don’t know how to describe her. A young woman. I don’tthink she was long out of being a novice She was young-looking, like you, MotherConfessor. Pretty. I thought she was pretty. She had long hair. Long brownhair.”Kahlan and Cara shared a look. “Nadine,” they said as one."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4“Mistress Cara?” Marlin called from below.Cara turned, hanging by one hand on the next rung down from Kahlan. She held thetorch out in her other hand. “What!”“How will I sleep, Mistress Cara? If you don’t come back tonight, and if I haveto stand, then how will I sleep?”“Sleep? That’s not my concern. I told you-you must remain on your feet, on thatspot. Move, sit, or lie down, and you will be very sorry. You will be all alonewith the pain. Understand?”“Yes, Mistress Cara,” came the weak voice from the darkness below.Once Kahlan was up in the hall, she reached down and took the torch from Cara,freeing the Mord-Sith to use both hands to climb out. Kahlan handed the torch toa relieved-looking Sergeant Collins.“Collins, I’d like all of you to remain here. Keep the door locked and don’t godown there-for anything. Don’t let anyone else so much as take a peek.”“Yes, Mother Confessor.” Sergeant Collins hesitated. “Is it dangerous, then?”Kahlan understood his concern. “No. Cara has control of his power. He’sincapable of using his magic.”She took appraisal of the troops clogging the dingy stone corridor. There had tobe close to a hundred.“I don’t know if we’ll be back tonight,” she told the sergeant. “Get the rest ofyour men down here. Divide them into squads. Take shifts so that there’s atleast this many down here at all times. Lock all the barricade doors. Postarchers at the doors and at each end of this hall.”“I thought you said there was no need for concern, that he couldn’t use hismagic.”Kahlan smiled. “Do you want to have to explain it to Cara, here, if someonesneaks in and rescues her charge out from under your nose in her absence?”He scratched his stubble as he glanced at Cara. “I understand, Mother Confessor.No one will be allowed within shouting distance of this door.”“Still don’t trust me?” Cara asked, when they were out of earshot of thesoldiers.Kahlan offered a friendly smile. “My father was King Wyborn. He was Cyrilla’sfather, and then mine. He was a great warrior. He taught me that it’s impossibleto be too cautious with prisoners.”Cara shrugged as they passed a sputtering torch. “Fine by me. It doesn’t hurt myfeelings. But I have his magic. He’s helpless.”“I still don’t understand how you can fear magic, and have such control overit.”“I told you. Only if he specifically attacks me with it.”“And how do you take control of it? How do you make it yours to command?”Cara spun the Agiel on the end of the chain at her wrist as she walked. “I don’tknow myself. We just do it. The Master Rahl himself takes part in some of thetraining of Mord-Sith. It is during that; phase that the ability is instilled inus. It’s not magic from within us, but transferred to us, I guess.”Kahlan shook her head. “Yet you don’t know, really, what you’re doing. And stillit works.”With her fingertips, Cara hooked the iron rail at a corner, swung around it, andfollowed Kahlan up the stone stairs. “You don’t have to know what you are doingin order for magic to work.”“What do you mean?”“Well, Lord Rahl told us that a child is magic: the magic of Creation. You don’thave to know what you are doing to make a child.“One time, this girl-a very naive girl-of about fourteen summers, a daughter ofone of the staff at the People’s Palace in D Hara, told me that Darken Rahl-Father Rahl, he liked to be called-had given her a rosebud and it had bloomed inher fingers as he smiled down at her. She said that that was how she had come tobe with child-through his magic.”Cara laughed without humor. “She really thought that that was how she becamepregnant. It never occurred to her that it was because she had spread her legsfor him. So you see? She did magic, created a son, and without knowing how shehad really done it.”Kahlan paused on the landing, in the shadows, and seized the crook of Cara’selbow, halting her.“All Richard’s family is dead-Darken Rahl killed his stepfather, his mother diedwhen he was young, and his half brother, Michael, betrayed Richard... allowingDenna to capture him. After Richard defeated Darken Rahl, Richard forgaveMichael for what he had done to him, but ordered him executed because histreachery had knowingly caused the torture and death of countless people at thehands of Darken Rahl.“I know how much family means to Richard. He would be thrilled to come to know ahalf brother. Could we send word to the palace in D’Hara and have him broughthere? Richard would be-”Cara shook her head and glanced away. “Darken Rahl tested the child anddiscovered that he was born without the gift. Darken Rahl was eager to have agifted heir. He considered anything less deformed and worthless.”“I see.” Silence filled the stairwell. “The girl... the mother... ?”Cara heaved a sigh, realizing that Kahlan wanted to hear it all. “Darken Rahlhad a temper. A sick temper. He crushed the girl’s windpipe with his bare handsafter he had made her watch him .. . well, watch him kill her son. When ungiftedoffspring came to his attention it often made him angry, and then he did that.”Kahlan let her hand fall away from Cara’s arm.Cara’s eyes came up; the calm had repossessed them. “A few of the Mord-Sithsuffered a similar fate. Fortunately, I never came to be with child when hechose me for his amusement.”Kahlan sought to fill the silence. “I’m glad Richard freed you from bondage tothat beast. Freed everyone.”Cara nodded, her eyes as cold as Kahlan had ever seen them. “He is more thanLord Rahl to us. Anyone who ever hurts him will answer to the Mord-Sith-to me.”Kahlan suddenly saw what Cara had said about Richard being allowed to “keep”Kahlan in a new light; it was the kindest thing she could think to do for him:allowing him to have the one he loved, despite her concern for the danger to hisheart.“You’ll have to wait in line,” Kahlan said.Cara at last grinned. “Let us pray to the good spirits that we never have tofight over first rights.”“I have a better idea: let’s keep harm from reaching him in the first place. Butremember, when we get up there, that we don’t know for sure who this Nadine is.If she is a Sister of the Dark, she is a very dangerous woman. But we don’t knowfor sure that she is. She might be a dignitary: a woman of rank and importance.It could even be that she’s nothing more than a rich nobleman’s daughter. Maybehe banished her poor, farmboy lover, and she’s simply looking for him. I don’twant you harming an innocent person. Let’s just keep our heads.”“I’m not a monster, Mother Confessor.”“I know. I didn’t mean to say that you were. I just don’t want our desire toprotect Richard to make us lose our heads. That includes me. Now, let’s get upto Petitioners’ Hall.”Cara frowned. “Why would we go there? Why not go to Nadine’s room?”Kahlan started up the second flight, two steps at a time. “There are two hundredeighty-eight guest rooms in the Confessors’ Palace, divided among six separatewings at distant points. I was distracted before, and didn’t think to tell theguards where to put her, so we have to go ask.”Cara shouldered open the door at the top of the stairs and, head swivelling,entered the hall ahead of Kahlan, as she liked to do in order to check the wayfor trouble.“Seems a poor design. Why would guest rooms be separated?”Kahlan gestured to a corridor branching to the left. “This way is shorter.” Sheslowed as two guards stepped aside to make way for them, and then quickened herpace along the deep blue carpet running down the hall. “The guest rooms areseparated because many diplomats visited the palace on business with thecouncil, and if the wrong diplomats are placed too close together, they couldbecome very undiplomatic. Keeping peace among allies was sometimes a delicatebalancing game. That included accommodations.”“But there are all the palaces-for the representatives of the lands-on KingsRow.”Kahlan grunted cynically. “Part of the game.”When they entered Petitioners’ Hall, everyone went to their knees again. Kahlanhad to give them the formal acknowledgment before she could speak with thecaptain. He told her where he had put Nadine, and she was about to leave when aboy, one of the group of Ja’La players waiting patiently in the hall, snatchedthe floppy wool hat from his head of blond hair and bolted toward them.The captain caught sight of him trotting across the room. “He’s waiting to seeLord Rahl. Probably wants him to come watch another game.” The captain smiled tohimself. “I told him it would be all right if he waited, but that I couldn’tpromise that Lord Rahl could see him.” He shrugged self-consciously. “Least Icould do. I was at the game, yesterday, with a crowd of soldiers. The boy andhis team won me three silver marks.”Hat crushed in both little fists, the boy genuflected on the other side of themarble railing from Kahlan. “Mother Confessor, we’d like to... well... if it’sno trouble... we...” His voice trailed off as he gulped air.Kahlan smiled encouragement. “Don’t be afraid. What’s your name?”“Yonick, Mother Confessor.”“I’m sorry, Yonick, but Richard can’t come watch another game just now. We’rebusy at the moment. Perhaps tomorrow. I know we both enjoyed it, and we wouldvery much like to come watch again, but on another day.”He shook his head. “It’s not about that. It’s my brother, Kip.” He twisted hishat. “He’s sick. I was wondering if... well, if Lord Rahl could come do somemagic and make him better.”Kahlan gave the boy’s shoulder a comforting squeeze. “Well, Richard’s not reallythat kind of wizard. Why don’t you go see one of the healers on Stentor Street.Tell them what he’s sick with and they’ll give him some herbs to help him feelbetter.”Yonick hung his head. “We don’t have no money for herbs. That’s why I was hoping.. . Kip is real sick.”Kahlan straightened and peered at the captain. His gaze went from Kahlan to theboy and back again. He cleared his throat.“Well, Yonick, I saw you play, yesterday,” the captain stammered. “Quite good.Your team was quite good.” Checking Kahlan’s eyes again, he stabbed a hand intoa pocket and came out with a coin. He bent over the rail and pushed the coininto Yonick’s fist. “I know which one’s your brother. He... that was a greatplay, that goal he made. Take this and get him some herbs, like the MotherConfessor said he needs.”Yonick stared in astonishment at the silver coin in his hand. “Herbs don’t costthis much, as I hear told.”The captain waved away the notion. “Well, I don’t have anything smaller. Buyyour team a treat, for their win, with the extra. Now take it and be off. Wehave palace business we must attend to.”Yonick straightened and clapped a fist to his heart in salute. “Yes, sir.”“And practice that kick of yours,” the captain called after the boy as he ranacross the hall to his fellows. “It’s a little sloppy.”“I will,” Yonick shouted over his shoulder. “Thanks.”Kahlan watched as he collected his friends and they rushed to the door. “Verykind of you, captain... ?”“Harris.” He winced. “Thank you, Mother Confessor.”“Cara, let’s go see this Lady Nadine.”Kahlan hoped the captain who came to attention at the end of the hall had had anuneventful watch.“Has Nadine tried to leave, Captain Nance?”“No, Mother Confessor,” he said, when he straightened from his bow. “She seemedgrateful that someone was taking in interest in her request. When I explainedthat there could be trouble about and we needed her to stay in her room, shepromised to abide by my instructions.” He glanced at the door. “She said thatshe didn’t want to get me in ‘hot water’ and she would do as I asked.”“Thank you, captain.” She paused before she opened the door. “If she comes outof this room without us, kill her. Don’t stop to ask her any questions, anddon’t give her any warning, just have the archers take her down.” When his browtwitched, she added, “If she leaves first, it will be because she has proven shecommands magic and has killed us with it.”Captain Nance, his face gone as pale as year-old straw, clapped a fist to hisheart in salute.The outer sitting room was decorated in red. The walls were a dark crimson,adorned with white crown molding, pink marble baseboard and door casings, and ahardwood floor almost entirely covered with a huge, gold-fringed carpetembellished with an ornate leaf-and-flower motif. The gilded legs of themarble-topped table and of the red velvet, tufted chairs were carved with amatching leaf-and-flower design. Being an interior room, there were no windows.Cut-glass chimneys on the dozen reflector lamps around the room sent sparkles oflight dancing across the walls.To Kahlan’s mind it was one of the least tasteful color schemes in the palace,but there were diplomats who specified this color room when requestingaccommodations at the palace. They felt it put them in the right frame of mindfor negotiations. Kahlan was always wary when hearing the arguments ofrepresentatives who had requested one of the red rooms.Nadine wasn’t in the extravagant outer room. The door to the bedroom was ajar.“Delicious rooms.” Cara whispered. “Can I have them?”Kahlan shushed her. She knew why the Mord-Sith would want a red room. With Carapeering over her shoulder, Kahlan cautiously pushed back the bedroom door.Cara’s breath tickled her left ear.If it was possible, the bedroom was more jarring to the senses than the sittingroom, with the red theme carried into the carpets, embroidered bedcover,immoderate collection of ornate, gold-fringed crimson pillows, and the swirled,pink marble fireplace surround. Kahlan thought that if Cara was wearing her redleather and ever wanted to hide, she could simply sit in this room and no onewould ever find her.Only half the lamps in the bedroom were lit. Several blown-glass bowls set abouton tables and the desk were filled with cried rose petals, their fragrancemingling with the lamp oil to permeate the air with a heavy, sickly-sweet odor.When the hinges squeaked, the woman resting on the bed opened her eyes, sawKahlan, and sprang to her feet. Ready to take Nadine with her Confessor’s powerif she gave the slightest indication of aggression, Kahlan unconsciously held anarm out to her side to keep Cara out of her way. In preparation, her musclestight as coiled steel, Kahlan was holding her breath. If the woman conjuredmagic, Kahlan would have to be quick.Nadine hastily knuckled the sleep from her eyes. By her indecision as to whichfoot to put forward in the awkward curtsy she performed. Kahlan knew that shewas no noblewoman. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t be a Sister of the Dark.Nadine gawked at Cara for an instant before smoothing down her dress at hershapely hips and addressing Kahlan. “Forgive me, Queen, but I’ve been on a longjourney and I was taking a bit of a rest. Guess I must have fallen asleep; Ididn’t hear you knock. I’m Nadine Brighton, Queen.”As Nadine dipped into another inelegant curtsy, Kahlan quickly surveyed theroom. The washbasin and ewer hadn’t been used. The towels beside them on thewashstand were clean and still folded. A simple, worn woollen travel bag sat atthe foot of the bed. A clothesbrush and a tin cup were the only foreign objectson the overwrought, gilded table to the other side of a red velvet chair besidethe fringed canopy bed. Despite the early spring chill and cold hearth, shehadn’t pulled down the bedcovers for her nap. Perhaps, thought Kahlan, so as notto become tangled in them if she had to move fast.Kahlan didn’t apologize for entering without knocking. “Mother Confessor,” shesaid in a cautious tone, feeling the need to make clear the tacit threat of thepower she wielded. “Queen is one of my less... common, titles. I am more widelyknown as the Mother Confessor.”As Nadine blushed, the sprinkling of freckles at the top of her cheekbones andacross her delicate nose almost disappeared. Her large brown eyes turned to thefloor with unease. She hastily ran her fingers through her thick brown hair,although it didn’t look dishevelled.She wasn’t as tall as Kahlan, though she looked to be about the same age, orperhaps a year younger. She was a lovely-looking young woman, and cast off nowarning signs of threat or danger, but Kahlan wasn’t put at ease by a fresh faceand innocent demeanor.Experience had taught Kahlan hard lessons. Marlin, the latest lesson, hadn’tappeared, at first, to be anything other than an awkward young man. This youngwoman’s lovely eyes, though, didn’t seem to have the same timeless quality tothem that had so unnerved Kahlan. Still, her caution wasn’t allayed, either.Nadine turned and hurriedly swept the flats of her hands over the bedcover,pressing out the wrinkles with quick strokes. “Forgive me, Mother Confessor, Ididn’t mean to muss your lovely bed. I brushed my dress first, so I wouldn’t getroad dust on it. I intended to lie on the floor, but the bed looked so invitingI couldn’t resist giving it a try. I hope I haven’t caused offense.”“Of course not,” Kahlan said. “I invited you to use the room as your own.”Before the last word was out of Kahlan’s mouth, Cara had swept around her. Eventhough there seemed to be no rank among the Mord-Sith, Berdine and Raina alwaysdeferred to Cara’s word. Among the D’Harans, the rank of the Mord-Sith, and Carain particular, seemed undisputed, though Kahlan had never heard anyone putdefinition to it. If Cara said, “Spit,” people spat.Nadine let out a wide-eyed squeak when she saw the leather-clad Mord-Sith comingat her.“Cara!” Kahlan called out.Cara ignored her. “We have your friend, Marlin, down in the pit. You’ll bejoining him shortly.”Cara jabbed a finger in the hollow at the base of Nadine’s neck, causing her todrop backward onto the chair beside the bed.“Ow!” Nadine shouted as she glared up at Cara. “That hurt!”As she bounded up off the chair, Cara seized the young woman’s throat in anarmored fist. She swept her Agiel up and pointed it between the wide brown eyes.“I have not yet begun to hurt you.”Kahlan snatched Cara’s braid and gave it a mighty yank. “One way or the other,you’re going to learn to follow orders!”Cara, still gripping the young woman’s throat, turned in surprise.“Let her go! I told you to let me handle this. Until she makes a threateningmove, you will do as you are told, or you can wait outside.”Cara released Nadine with a shove that plopped her down in the chair again.“This one’s trouble. I can feel it. You should let me kill her.”Kahlan pressed her lips together until Cara rolled her eyes and grudginglystepped aside. Nadine came off the chair, slower this time. Her eyes teared asshe rubbed her throat and coughed.“Why’d you do that! I’ve done nothing to you! I didn’t disturb any of your finethings. You people have the worst manners of anyone I’ve ever seen.” She shook afinger at Kahlan. “There’s no call to treat a person that way.”“On the contrary,” Kahlan said. “An innocent enough looking young man showed upat the palace today, also asking to see Lord Rahl. He turned out to be anassassin. Thanks to Cara, here, we were able to stop him.”Nadine’s indignation faltered. “Oh.”“That’s not the worst of it,” Kahlan added. “He confessed to having anaccomplice-an attractive young woman with long brown hair.”Nadine’s throat-rubbing paused as she looked at Cara, then back to Kahlan. “Oh.Well, I guess I can understand the mistake...”“You asked to see Lord Rahl, too. That’s made everyone just a little jumpy. Allof us are quite protective of Lord Rahl.”“I guess I can see the reason for the confusion. No offense taken.”“Cara, here, is one of Lord Rahl’s personal guards,” Kahlan said. “I’m sure youcan understand the reason for her belligerent attitude.”Nadine took her hand away from her throat and rested it on one hip. “Of course.I guess I landed in the middle of a hornet’s nest.”“The problem is,” Kahlan went on, “you haven’t yet convinced us you are not thesecond assassin. For your sake, it would be best if you did so at once.”Nadine’s eyes darted between the two women watching her. Her relief reversed toalarm. “Me? A killer? But I’m a woman.”“So am I,” Cara said. “One who is going to have your blood all over this roomuntil you tell us the truth.”Nadine spun around and snatched up the chair, brandishing its legs toward Caraand Kahlan. “Stay away! I’m warning you; Tommy Lancaster and his friend Lesteronce thought to have their way with me, and they now have to eat all their mealswithout the benefit of their front teeth.”“Put down the chair,” Cara warned in a deadly hiss, “or you will be eating yournext meal in the spirit world.”Nadine dropped the chair as if it had caught fire. She retreated until she wasup against the wall. “Leave me be! I didn’t do anything!”Kahlan gently hooked Cara’s arm and urged her back. “Let a sister of the Agielhandle this?” she said in a whisper as she lifted an eyebrow. “I know I said‘until she makes a threatening move,’ but a chair is hardly the kind of threat Ihad in mind.”Cara’s mouth twisted in annoyance. “All right. For the moment.”Kahlan turned to Nadine. “I need some answers. Tell the truth, and if you reallyhave nothing to do with this assassin, you will have my sincere apology and I’lldo what I can to make up for our inhospitality. But if you lie to me, and youintend to do harm to Lord Rahl, the guards outside have orders not to allow youto leave this room alive. Do you understand?”Nadine, her back pressed against the wall, nodded.“You asked to see Lord Rahl.” Nadine nodded again. “Why?”“I’m on my way to my love. He’s been gone since last autumn. We’re to be wed,and I’m on my way to him.” She brushed a strand of hair back from her eyes. “ButI don’t know where he is, exactly. I was told to go see Lord Rahl and I wouldfind my betrothed.” Nadine’s lower lids brimmed with tears. “That’s why I wantedto speak with this Lord Rahl-to ask if he could help.”“I see,” Kahlan said. “I can understand your distress over your love beingmissing. What is your young man’s name?”Nadine pulled her kerchief from her sleeve and dabbed it at her eyes. “Richard.”“Richard. Is there more to his name?”Nadine nodded. “Richard Cypher.”Kahlan had to remind herself to draw a breath through her open mouth, but hermind couldn’t seem to make her tongue work.“Who?” Cara asked.“Richard Cypher. He’s a woods guide where I live, in Hartland, that’s inWest-land, where we live.”“What do you mean, you’re to wed him?” Kahlan finally managed in a whisper. Shefelt her world threatening to crush in around her as a thousand things all atonce whirled chaotically in her mind. “Did he tell you that?”Nadine twisted her damp kerchief. “Well, he was courting me... it wasunderstood... but then he disappeared. A woman came and told me that we’re to bemarried. She said that the sky had spoken to her-she was a mystic of some sort.She knew all about my Richard, how kind and strong and handsome he is and all.She knew all manner of things about me, too. She said that it’s my destiny tomarry Richard and Richard’s destiny to be my husband.”“Woman?” Kahlan could get out no more than that one word.Nadine nodded. “Shota, she said her name was.”Kahlan’s hands balled into fists. Her voice returned with venom. “Shota. Didthis woman, Shota, have anyone with her?”“Yes. A strange little... fellow. With yellow eyes. He kind of scared me, butshe said he was harmless. Shota is the one who told me to come see Lord Rahl.She said Lord Rahl could help me find my Richard.”Kahlan recognized the description of Shota’s companion, Samuel. This woman’svoice, calling Richard, “my Richard,” kept thundering around in the storm inKahlan’s head. She worked at making her voice sound calm. “Nadine, please waithere.”“I will,” Nadine said, gathering her composure. “Is everything all right? Youbelieve me, don’t you? Every word is true.”Kahlan didn’t answer, but instead pulled her stunned stare from Nadine andmarched from the room. Cara closed the door as she followed on Kahlan’s heels.Kahlan staggered to a halt in the outer room, everything swimming in a wateryred blur.“Mother Confessor,” Cara whispered, “what’s wrong? Your face is as red as myleather. Who is this Shota?”“Shota is a witch woman.”Cara stiffened at that news. “And do you know this Richard Cypher?”Kahlan twice swallowed past the painful lump in the back of her throat. “Richardwas raised by his stepfather. Until Richard found out that Darken Rahl was hisreal father, his name was Richard Cypher.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5I’ll kill her,” Kahlan rasped in a hoarse voice as she stared off at nothing.“With my bare hands. I’ll strangle the life out of her!”Cara turned toward the bedroom. “I will take care of it. Better if you let metake care of her.”Kahlan hooked Cara’s arm. “Not her. I’m talking about Shota.” She gesturedtoward the bedroom door. “She doesn’t understand any of this. She doesn’t knowabout Shota.”“You know this witch woman, then?”Kahlan bitterly huffed out a breath. “Oh yes. I know her. She’s been trying toprevent Richard and me from being together since the first.”“Why would she do that?”Kahlan turned away from the bedroom door. “I don’t know. She gives a differentreason every time, but I sometimes fear that it’s because she wants Richard forherself.”Cara frowned. “How would getting Lord Rahl to marry this little strumpet gainShota Lord Rahl?”Kahlan flicked a hand. “I don’t know. Shota is always up to something. She’scaused us trouble at every turn.” Her fists tightened with resolve. “But itwon’t work, this time. If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to end hermeddling. And then Richard and I are going to be married.” Her voice dropped toa whispered oath. “If I have to touch Shota with my power and send her to theunderworld, I will end her meddling.”Cara folded her arms as she considered the problem. “What do you wish done withNadine?” Her blue eyes turned toward the bedroom. “It still might be best to...get rid of her.”Kahlan squeezed the bridge of her nose between a finger and thumb. “This isn’tNadine’s doing. She’s simply a pawn in Shota’s plotting.”“One foot soldier can sometimes cause you more trouble than a general’s battleplan if he...”Cara’s words trailed off as her arms came unfolded. She cocked her head, as iflistening to a wind in the halls.“Lord Rahl is coming.”The ability of the Mord-Sith to sense Richard through their bond to him wasuncanny, if not unnerving. The door opened. Berdine and Raina, wearing leatherof the same cut and skintight style as Cara’s, but brown rather than red,strutted into the room.Both were a bit shorter than Cara, but no less attractive. Where Cara was leggy,muscular, and without a spare ounce of fat, blue-eyed Berdine had a morecurvaceous shape. Berdine’s wavy brown hair was plaited in the characteristiclong braid of a Mord-Sith, as was graceful Raina’s fine, dark hair. All threeshared the same ruthless confidence.Raina’s incisive, dark-eyed gaze took in Cara’s red leather, but she made nocomment. Both she and Berdine wore grim, forbidding expressions. The twoMord-Sith turned to face one another from either side of the door.“We present Lord Rahl,” Berdine said in an officious tone, “the Seeker of Truthand wielder of the Sword of Truth, the bringer of death, the Master of D’Hara,the ruler of the Midlands, the commander of the gar nation, the champion of freepeople and bane of the wicked”- her penetrating blue eyes turned to Kahlan-”andthe betrothed of the Mother Confessor.” She lifted an introductory arm towardthe door.Kahlan couldn’t imagine what was going on. She had seen the Mord-Sith display avariety of temperaments, from imperious to mischievous, but she had never seenthem acting ceremonial.Richard strode into the room. His raptor gaze locked on Kahlan. For an instant,the world stopped. There was nothing else but the two of them, joined in asilent link.A smile widened on his lips and gleamed in his eyes. A smile of unbounded love.There was only her and Richard. Only his eyes.But the rest of him . ..She felt her mouth drop open. In astonishment, Kahlan put a hand over her heart.As long as she had known him, he had worn only his simple woods clothes. Butnow...His black boots were all she recognized. The tops of the boots were wrapped withleather thongs pinned with silver emblems embossed with geometric designs, andcovered new, black wool trousers. Over a black shirt was a black, open-sidedtunic, decorated with symbols snaking along a wide gold band running all the wayaround its squared edges. A wide, multilayered leather belt bearing several moreof the silver emblems and a gold-worked pouch to each side cinched themagnificent tunic at his waist. The ancient, tooled-bather baldric holding thegold and silver wrought scabbard for the Sword of Truth crossed over his rightshoulder. At each wrist was a wide, leather-padded silver band bearing linkedrings encompassing more of the strange symbols. His broad shoulders bore a capethat appeared to be made of spun gold. He looked at once noble and sinister.Regal, and deadly. He looked like a commander of kings. And like a vision ofwhat the prophecies had named him: the bringer of death.Kahlan would never have thought he could look more handsome than he always did.More commanding. More imposing. She was wrong.As her jaw worked, trying to bring forth words that weren’t there, he crossedthe room. He bent and kissed her temple.“Good,” Cara announced. “She needed that; she had a headache.” She lifted aneyebrow to Kahlan. “All better now?”Kahlan, hardly able to get her breath, hardly hearing Cara, touched her fingersto him, as if to test it this was a vision, or real.“Like it?” he asked.“Like it? Dear spirits...” she breathed.He chuckled. “I’ll take that for a yes.”Kahlan wished everyone was gone. “But, Richard, what is this? Where did you getall this?”She couldn’t take her hand from his chest. She liked the feel of his breathing.She could feel his heart beating, too. And she could feel her own heartpounding.“Well,” he said, “I knew you wanted me to get some new clothes-”She pulled her gaze from his body and looked up into his grey eyes. “What? Inever said that.”He laughed. “Your beautiful green eyes said it for you. When you looked at myold woods outfit, your eyes spoke quite c early.”She took a step back and gestured to the new clothes. “Where did you get allthis?”He clasped one of her hands and with the fingers of his other lifted her chin togaze into her eyes. “You’re so beautiful. You’re going to look magnificent inyour blue wedding dress. I wanted to look worthy of the Mother Confessor herselfwhen we’re married. I had it made in a hurry so as not to delay our wedding.”“He had the seamstresses make it for him. It was a surprise,” Cara said. “Inever told her your secret, Lord Rahl. She tried her best to get it out of me,but I didn’t tell her.”“Thank you, Cara.” Richard laughed. “I bet it wasn’t easy.”Kahlan laughed with him. “But this is wonderful. Mistress Wellington made allthis for you?”“Well, not all of it. I told her what I wanted, and she and the otherseamstresses went to work. I think she did a fine job.”“I will give her my compliments. If not a hug.” Kahlan tested the cape between afinger and thumb. “She made this? I’ve never seen anything like it. I can’tbelieve she made this.”“Well, no,” Richard admitted. “That, and some of the other things came from theWizard’s Keep.”“The Keep! What were you doing up there?”“When I was there before, I came across these rooms where the wizards used tostay. I went back and had a better look at some of the things that belonged tothem.”“When did you do this?”“A few days ago. When you were busy meeting with some of the officials from ournew allies.”Kahlan’s brow tightened as she appraised the outfit. “The wizards of that timewore this? I thought wizards always wore simple robes.”“Most of them did. One wore some of this.”“What kind of wizard wore an outfit like this?”“A war wizard.”“A war wizard,” she whispered in astonishment. Though he largely didn’t know howto use his gift, Richard was the first war wizard to have been born in nearlythree thousand years.Kahlan was about to launch into a raft of questions, but remembered that therewere more consequential matters at the moment. Her mood sank. “Richard”-shelooked away from his eyes-”there is someone here to see you...”She heard the bedroom door squeak.“Richard?” Nadine, standing in the doorway, expectantly twisted her kerchief inher fingers. “I heard Richard’s voice.”“Nadine?”Nadine’s eyes went as big as Sanderian gold crowns. “Richard.”Richard smiled politely. “Nadine.” His mouth smiled, anyway.His eyes, though, held no hint of a smile. It was as discordant a look as Kahlanhad ever seen on his face. Kahlan had seen Richard angry, she had seen him inthe lethal rage from magic of the Sword of Truth, when the magic danceddangerously in his eyes, and she had seen him with the deadly calm countenanceinvoked when he turned the blade white. In the fury of commitment anddetermination, Richard was capable of looking frightening.But no look she had ever seen on his face was as terrifying to Kahlan as the oneshe saw now.This wasn’t a deadly rage that gripped his eyes, or a lethal commitment. Thiswas somehow worse. The depth of disinterest in that empty smile, in his eyes,was frightening.The only way Kahlan could imagine it being worse would be if such a gaze weredirected her way. That look, so devoid of fervor, if directed at her, would havebroken her heart.Nadine apparently didn’t know him as well as did Kahlan; she didn’t see anythingbut the smile on his lips.“Oh, Richard!”Nadine dashed across the room and threw her arms around his neck. She seemedready to throw her legs around Richard too. Kahlan shot an arm out to stop Carabefore the Mord-Sith could take more than a step.Kahlan had to force herself to stand her ground and hold her tongue. Despiteeverything she and Richard meant to each other, she knew that this was somethingbeyond her say. This was Richard’s past, and as well as she knew him, some ofthat past-his romantic past, anyway-was largely unknown territory. Up until thatmoment it had seemed unimportant.Fearing to say the wrong thing, Kahlan said nothing. Her fate was in Richard’shands, and those of a beautiful woman who at that moment had hers around hisneck-but worse, her fate seemed once again in Shota’s hands.Nadine began planting kisses all over Richard’s neck even as he tried to holdhis head away from her. He placed his hands on her waist and pushed her away.“Nadine, what are you doing here?”“Looking for you, silly,” she said in a breathless voice. “Everyone’s beenpuzzled-worried-since you disappeared last autumn. My father missed you- I’vemissed you. None of us knew what happened to you. Zedd’s missing, too. Theboundary came down and then you came up missing, and Zedd, and your brother. Iknow you were upset when your father was murdered, but we didn’t expect you torun away.” Her words were running together in breathless excitement.“Well, it’s a long story, and one I’m sure you wouldn’t be interested in.”True to Richard’s words, she didn’t seem to hear a bit of it, and simply rambledon.“I had so much to take care of, first. I had to get Lindy Hamilton to promise toget the winter roots for Pa. He’s been beside himself without you to bring himsome of the special plants he needs that only you can seem to find. I’ve done mybest, but I don’t know the woods like you. He’s hoping Lindy will be able tofill in until I can get you home. Then I had to think what to take, and how tofind my way. I’ve been looking so long. I came to speak with somebody named LordRahl, hoping he could help me find you. I never in all the world dreamed I’dfind you before I even talked to him.”“I am Lord Rahl.”This, too, she seemed not to hear. She stepped buck and looked him up and down.“Richard, what are you doing in that outfit? Who are you pretending to be? Getchanged. We’ll go home. Everything’s fine, now that I’ve found you. We’ll beback home soon, and everything will be back to the way it was. We’ll be marriedand-”“What!”She blinked. “Married. We’ll be marred, and have a house and everything. You canbuild us a better one-your old house won’t do. We’ll have children. Lots ofchildren. Sons. Lots of sons. Big and strong like my Richard.” She grinned. “Ilove you, my Richard. We’re going to be married, at last.”His smile, as empty as it had been, was gone, and in its place a serious scowlgrew. “Where did you ever get an idea like that?”Nadine laughed as she playfully ran a finger down his front. She finally glancedabout. No one else was so much as smiling. Her laughter died out and she soughtrefuge in Richard’s gaze.“But, Richard... you and me. Like it was always supposed to be. We’ll bemarried. At last. Like it was always meant to be.”Cara leaned toward Kahlan to whisper in her ear. “You should have let me killher.”Richard’s glare wiped the smirk from the Mord-Sith’s mouth and drained the bloodfrom her face. He turned back to Nadine.“Where did you get such an idea?”Nadine was appraising his clothes again. “Richard, you look foolish dressed likethis. Sometimes I wonder if you have a lick of sense. What are you doing playingat being a king? And where did you get such a sword? Richard, I know you wouldnever steal, but you don’t have the kind of money such a weapon would cost. Ifyou won it in a bet or something, you can sell it so that we-”Richard gripped her by the shoulders and gave her a shake. “Nadine, we werenever engaged to be married, or even close. Where did you get a crazy idea likethat? What are you doing here!”Nadine finally wilted under his glower. “Richard, I’ve come a long way. I’venever been out of Hartland before. It was hard travelling. Doesn’t that meananything to you? Doesn’t that count for anything? I would never have left exceptto come get you. I love you, Richard.”Ulic, one of Richard’s two huge personal bodyguards, ducked as he steppedthrough the doorway. “Lord Rahl, if you are not busy, General Kerson has aproblem and needs to speak with you.”Richard turned a hot glare toward the towering Ulic. “In a minute.”Ulic, not used to Richard directing such a forbidding look, or tone, his way,bowed. “I will tell him, Lord Rahl.”Puzzled, Nadine watched the mountain of muscle duck back out the doorway. “LordRahl? Richard, what in the name of the good spirits was that man talking about?What trouble have you gotten yourself into? You were always so sensible. Whathave you done? Why are you tricking these people? Who are you playing at being?”He seemed to cool a bit and his voice turned weary. “Nadine, it’s a long story,and one I’m not in the mood to repeat just now. I’m afraid I’m not the sameperson... It’s been a long time since I’ve left home. A great many things havehappened. I’m sorry you’ve come a long way for nothing, but what was oncebetween us-”Kahlan expected a sheepish glance her way. She never got one.Nadine took a step back. She looked around at all the faces watching her:Kahlan, Cara, Berdine, Raina, and the silent hulk of Egan back near the door.Nadine threw her hands up. “What’s the matter with all you people! Who do youthink this man is? He’s Richard Cypher, my Richard! He’s a woods guide- anobody! He’s just a simple boy from Hartland, playing at being somebodyimportant. He’s not! Are you all blind fools? He’s my Richard, and we’re to bemarried.”Cara finally broke the silence. “We all know quite well who this man is.Apparently, you do not. He is Lord Rahl, the Master of D’Hara, and the ruler ofwhat was the Midlands. At least, he is the ruler of those who have so farsurrendered to him. Everyone in this room, if not this city, would lay downtheir lives to protect him. We all owe him more than our loyalty; we owe him ourlives.”“We can all only be who we are,” Richard told Nadine, “no more, and no less. Avery wise woman told me that, one time.”Nadine whispered her incredulity, but Kahlan couldn’t hear the words.Richard put his arm around Kahlan’s waist. In that gentle touch, she read themessage of comfort and love, and suddenly felt profound sorrow for this womanstanding before strangers, exposing such personal matters of the heart.“Nadine,” Richard said in a quiet tone “this is Kahlan, the wise woman I spokeof. The woman I love. Kahlan, not Nadine. Kahlan and I are soon to be married.We’re shortly going to leave to be wedded by the Mud People. Nothing in thisworld is going to change that.”Nadine seemed afraid to take her eyes from Richard, as if she feared that if shedid, it would become true.“Mud People? What in the name of the spirits are Mud People? Sounds dreadful.Richard, you...” She seemed to gather her resolve. She pressed her lips togetherand suddenly scowled. She shook her finger at him.“Richard Cypher, I don’t know what kind of foolish game you’re playing, but I’llnot have it! You listen to me, you big oaf, you go get your things packed! We’regoing home!”“I am home, Nadine.”Nadine, at last, could think of no counter.“Nadine, who told you all this... this marriage business?”The fire had gone out of her. “A mystic named Shota.”Kahlan tensed at the sound of that name. Shota was the true threat. No matterwhat Nadine said, or wanted, it was Shota who had the power to cause trouble.“Shota!” Richard wiped a hand across his face. “Shota. I might have known.”And then Richard did the last thing Kahlan would have expected: he chuckled. Hestood there, with everyone watching him, threw his head back, and laughed aloud.Somehow, it magically melted Kahlan’s fears. That Richard would simply laugh offwhat Shota might do somehow trivialized the threat. Suddenly, her heart feltbuoyant. Richard said that the Mud People were going to marry them, as they bothwanted, and the fact that Shota wished otherwise was worth no more than achuckle. Richard’s arm around her waist tightened with a loving squeeze. Shefelt her cheeks tighten with a grin of her own.Richard waved an apology. “Nadine, I’m sorry. I’m not laughing at you. It’s justthat Shota has been playing her little tricks on us for a long time. It’sunfortunate that she’s used you in her scheme, but it’s just one of her wretchedgames. She’s a witch woman.”“Witch woman?” Nadine whispered.Richard nodded. “She’s taken us in with her little dramas in the past, but notthis time. I no longer care what Shota says. I’m not playing her games anymore.”Nadine looked perplexed. “A witch woman? Magic? I’ve been plied with magic? Butshe said that the sky had spoken to her.”“Is that so. Well, I don’t care if the Creator Himself has spoken to her.”“She said that the wind hunts you. I was worried. I wanted to help.”“The wind hunts me? Well, it’s always something with her.”Nadine’s gaze drifted from his. “But what about us... ?”“Nadine, there is no ‘us.’“ The edge returned to his voice. “You, of all people,know the truth of that.”Her chin lifted with indignation. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”He watched her for a long moment, as if considering saying more than he finallydid. “Have it your way, Nadine.”For the first time, Kahlan felt embarrassed. Whatever the exchange had meant,she felt like an intruder hearing it. Richard seemed uncomfortable, too. “I’msorry, Nadine, but I have things I have to take care of. If you need helpgetting home, I’ll see what I can do. Whatever you need-a horse, supplies,whatever. Tell everyone back in Hartland that I’m fine, and I send my bestwishes.”He turned to the waiting Ulic. “Is General Kerson here?”“Yes, Lord Rahl.”Richard took a step toward the door. “I’d best go see what his problem is.”General Kerson instead entered from right around the doorway when he heard hisname. Greying, but muscular and fit, and a head shorter than Richard, he cut animposing figure in his burnished leather uniform. His upper arms bore scars ofrank, their shiny white furrows showing through the short chain-mail sleeves.He clapped a fist to his heart in salute “Lord Rahl, I need to speak with you.”“Fine. Speak.”The general hesitated. “I meant alone, Lord Rahl.”Richard looked in no mood to dally with the man. “There are no spies here.Speak.”“It’s about the men, Lord Rahl. A great many of them are sick.”“Sick? What’s wrong with them?”“Well, Lord Rahl, they... that is...”Richard’s brow tightened. “Out with it.”“Lord Rahl”-General Kerson glanced among the women before clearing histhroat-”I’ve got over half my army, well, out of commission, squatting andgroaning with debilitating bouts of diarrhoea.”Richard’s brow relaxed. “Oh. Well, I’m sorry. I hope they’re better soon. It’s amiserable state to be in.”“It’s not an uncommon condition among an army, but to be this widespread it is,and because it is so widespread, something has to be done.”“Well, be sure they get plenty to drink. Keep me informed. Let me know howthey’re doing.”“Lord Rahl, something has to be done. Now. We can’t have this.”“It’s not like they’re stricken with spotted fever, general.”General Kerson clasped his hands behind his back and took a patient breath.“Lord Rahl, General Reibisch, before he went south, told us that you wanted yourofficers to voice their opinions to you when we thought it important. He saidthat you told him that you may get angry if you didn’t like what we had to say,but you wouldn’t punish us for voicing our views. He said you wanted to know ouropinions because we’ve had more experience at dealing with troops and withcommand of an army than you.”Richard wiped a hand back and forth across his mouth. “You’re right, general. Sowhat is it that’s so vital?”“Well, Lord Rahl, I’m one of the heroes of the Shinavont province revolt. That’sin D’Hara. I was a lieutenant at the time. There were five hundred of us, and wecame upon the rebel force, seven thousand strong, encamped in a scrag wood. Weattacked at first light, and ended the revolt before the day was out. There wereno Shinavont rebels left by sunset.”“Very impressive, general.”General Kerson shrugged. “Not really. Nearly all their men had their pants downaround their ankles. You ever try to fight when the grips had your guts?”Richard admitted that he hadn’t. “Everyone called us heroes, but it doesn’t takea hero to split a man’s skull when he’s so dizzy with diarrhoea that he canhardly lift his head. I wasn’t proud of what we did, but it was our duty, and weended the revolt, and undoubtedly prevented the greater bloodshed that wouldhave occurred if their force had gotten well and escaped us. No telling whatthey would have done, how many more would have died.“But they didn’t. We took them down because they were sick with dysentery andcouldn’t keep their feet.” He swept his arm around, indicating the surroundingcountryside. “I’ve got over half my men down. We’ve not a full force becauseGeneral Reibisch went off to the south. What’s left isn’t in fighting condition.Something has to be done. A sizable enough foe attacks now, and we’re introuble. We’re vulnerable. We could lose Aydindril.“I’d be grateful if you knew something we could do to reverse the situation.”“Why are you bringing this to me? Don’t you have healers?”“The healers we have are for those kinds of problems caused by steel. We triedgoing to some of the herb sellers and healers here in Aydindril, but theycouldn’t begin to handle the numbers.” He shrugged. “You’re the Lord Rahl. Ithought you would know what to do.”“You’re right, the herb dealers wouldn’t have anything in that kind ofquantity.” Richard pinched his lower lip as he thought. “Garlic will take careof it, if they eat enough. Blueberries will help, too. Get plenty of garlic intothe men, and supplement it with blueberries. There would be enough of thosearound.”The general leaned in with a dubious frown. “Garlic and blueberries? Are youserious?”“My grandfather taught me about herbs and remedies and such things. Trust me,general, it will work. They’ve got to drink plenty of tannin tea from quench oakbark, too. Garlic, blueberries, and the quench oak tea should take care of it.”Richard looked over his shoulder. “Right, Nadine?”She nodded. “That would do it, but it would be easier yet if you gave thempowdered bistort.”“I thought of that, but we’ll never find any bistort this time of year, and theherb sellers wouldn’t begin to have enough.”“It doesn’t take that much in powered form, and it would work best,” Nadinesaid. “How many men, sir?”“Last report was in the neighborhood of fifty thousand,” the general said. “Bynow? Who knows.”Nadine’s eyebrows lifted in surprise at the number. “I’ve never seen that muchbistort in my life. They’d be old men before that much could be gathered.Richard’s right, then: garlic, blueberries, and quench oak tea. Comfrey teawould work, too, but no one will carry that kind of quantity. Quench oak is yourbest bet, but it’s hard to find. If there aren’t quench oaks to be had, arrowwood would at least be better than nothing.”“No,” Richard said. “I’ve seen quench oak up in the high ridges, to thenortheast.”General Kerson scratched his stubble. “What’s a quench oak?”“An oak tree. The kind of oak tree that will be what your men need. It has ayellow inner bark that you use to make the tea.”“A tree. Lord Rahl, I can identify ten different kinds of steel just from thefeel of it between my fingers, but I couldn’t tell one tree from another if Ihad extra eyes.”“Surely you must have men who know trees.”“Richard,” Nadine said, “quench oak is what we call it in Hartland. I’vecollected roots and plants on my way here that I know the names of, but arecalled different by the people I’ve met. If these men drink tea from the wrongtree, the best you can hope for is that it won’t harm them, but it won’t solvethe problem. The garlic and blueberries will help their gut, but they need theliquid for what was drained out of the rest of them; the tea helps stop themfrom losing all that water and builds their health back up.”“Yes, I know.” He rubbed his eyes. “General, get a detachment together, aboutfive hundred wagons, and extra packhorses in case we can’t get the wagons close.I know where the trees are, I’ll lead you up there.” Richard laughed quietly tohimself. “Once a guide, always a guide.”“The men will appreciate it that Lord Rahl is concerned about their well-being,”the general said. “I, for sure, appreciate it, Lord Rahl.”“Thanks, general. Get everything needed together, and I’ll meet you out at thestables shortly. I’d like to get up there, at least, before dark. Those passesare no place to be stumbling around in the dark, especially with wagons. Themoon is near full, but even that won’t help enough.”“We’ll be ready before you can walk out there. Lord Rahl.”After a quick fist to his heart in salute, the general was gone. Richard flashedNadine another of his empty smiles. “Thanks for the help.”And then he turned his full attention to the Mord-Sith clad in red leather."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6Richard gripped Cara’s jaw and lifted her face. He turned her head so he couldbetter see the oozing cut on her cheek.“What’s this?”She glanced to Kahlan when he released his hold on her. “A man refused myadvances.”“Is that so. Maybe he was put off by your choice of red leather.”Richard looked to Kahlan. “What’s going on? We’ve got a palace full of guards sojumpy that they even challenged me when I came in. We’ve got squads of archersguarding stairwells, and I’ve not seen so much bared steel since the Blood ofthe Fold attacked the city.”His eyes had that raptor gaze again. “Who’s down in the pit?”“I told you,” Cara whispered to Kahlan. “He always finds out.”Kahlan had told Cara not to mention Marlin because she feared he might somehowhurt Richard. But once Marlin had revealed that there was a second assassin,everything changed; she had to tell Richard that there was a Sister of the Darkwandering around loose.“An assassin showed up to kill you.” Kahlan gestured with a tilt of her headtoward Cara. “Little Miss Magic, here, goaded him into using his gift on her sothat she could capture him. We put him down in the pit for safekeeping.”Richard glanced at Cara before addressing Kahlan. “Little Miss Magic, eh? Whydid you let her do that?”“He said he wanted to kill you. Cara decided to question him in her ownfashion.”“Do you think that was necessary?” he asked Cara. “We have a whole army. One mancouldn’t get to me.”“He also said he intended to kill the Mother Confessor.”Richard’s expression darkened. “Then I hope you didn’t show him your gentleside.”Cara smiled. “No, Lord Rahl.”“Richard,” Kahlan said, “it’s worse than that. He was a wizard from the Palaceof the Prophets. He said that he came with a Sister of the Dark. We haven’tfound her yet.”“A Sister of the Dark. Great. How did you manage to discover that this man wasan assassin?”“He announced himself, believe it or not. He claims that Jagang sent him to killyou, and me, and that his orders were to announce himself once inside theConfessors’ Palace.”“Then Jagang’s plan wasn’t really for this man to kill us; Jagang isn’t thatstupid. What was this Sister of the Dark to do, here in Aydindril? Did he saythat she was here to kill us, too, or that she was here for some other purpose?”“Marlin didn’t seem to know,” Kahlan said. “After what Cara did to him, Ibelieve him.”“Which Sister is it? What’s her name?”“Marlin didn’t know her name.”Richard nodded. “That’s possible. How long was he in the city before heannounced himself?”“I’m not sure, exactly. I assumed a few days.”“Then why didn’t he come directly to the palace once he arrived?”“I don’t know,” Kahlan said. “I didn’t . .. ask him that.”“How long was he with the Sister? What did they do while they were here?”“I don’t know.” Kahlan hesitated. “I guess I didn’t think to ask him.”“Well, if he was with her, she must have had something to say to him. She wouldhave been the one in charge. What did she say to him?”“I don’t know.”“Did this Marlin see anyone else while he was in the city? Did he meet withanyone else? Where did he stay?”It was the Seeker questioning her, not Richard. Even though he wasn’t raisinghis voice, or using a threatening tone, Kahlan’s ears burned. “I didn’t .. .think to ask.”“What did they do while they were together? Did she have anything with her? Didshe buy anything, or pick up anything, or talk to anyone else who could end upbeing another part of a team? Was there anyone else they were ordered to kill?”“I... didn’t...”Richard combed his fingers through his hair. “One obviously doesn’t send anassassin and have him announce himself to the guards at the intended victim’sdoor. That will only get your assassin killed, instead. Maybe Jagang had thisman do something before he came to the palace, and then once the task was done,he wanted Marlin to come here so we would kill him and eliminate any chance wewould find out what’s going on before this Sister carried out the true plot.Jagang certainly wouldn’t care if we killed one of his pawns-he has plenty more,and he doesn’t value human life.”Kahlan twisted her fingers together behind her back. She was feeling decidedlyfoolish. Richard’s furrowed brow over his piercing, grey eyes wasn’t helping.“Richard, we knew that there was a woman up here who was asking to see you, justas Marlin did. We didn’t know who Nadine was. Marlin didn’t know the Sister’sname, but he gave us a description: young, pretty, and with long brown hair. Wewere worried that Nadine might be the Sister, right here among us, and so weleft Marlin down there and came up here at once to see about Nadine. That wasour priority: stopping a Sister of the Dark if she was in the palace. We’ll askMarlin all those questions later. He’s not going anywhere.”Richard’s raptor gaze softened as he took a contemplative breath. He finallynodded. “You did the right thing. You’re right about the questions being lessimportant. I’m sorry; I should have realized you would do what was best.” Helifted a cautionary finger. “Leave this Marlin fellow to me.”Richard turned the raptor gaze on Cara. “I don’t want you and Kahlan down therewith him. Understand? Something could happen.”Cara would offer her life without question to protect his, but by her glare shewas apparently beginning to resent having her ability questioned. “And howdangerous was a big strong man at the end of Denna’s leash as she walked himwith impunity among the public at the People’s Palace in D’Hara? Did she have todo more than tuck the end of her pet’s thin chain under her belt to demonstrateher complete control? Did he ever once so much as dare to let tension come tothat leash?”The man at the end of that leash had been Richard.Cara’s blue eyes flashed with indignation, like sudden lightning from a clearblue sky. Kahlan almost would have expected Richard to draw his sword in rage.Instead, he watched her, as if listening dispassionately to her opinion, andwaiting to see if she had anything to add. Kahlan wondered if Mord-Sith fearedbeing struck dead, or welcomed it.“Lord Rahl, I have his power. Nothing can happen.”“I’m sure you do. I don’t doubt your abilities, Cara, but I don’t want Kahlanput at risk, no matter how inconceivable the risk, when it isn’t necessary. Youand I will go question Marlin when I get back.. I trust you with my life, but Ijust don’t want to trust Kahlan’s to an ugly twist of fate.“Jagang overlooked the ability of the Mord-Sith, probably because he doesn’tknow enough about the New World to know what a Mord-Sith is. He’s made amistake. I simply want to make sure we don’t make a mistake, too. All right?When I get back we’ll question Marlin and find out what’s really going on.”As quickly as it had come, the storm in Cara’s eyes passed. Richard’s calmdemeanor had quelled it, and in seconds it seemed as if nothing had happened.Kahlan almost wasn’t sure Cara had actually said the savage things she hadheard. Almost.Kahlan wished she could have thought through the matter of Marlin when she hadhad the chance. Richard made it all seem so simple to her. She guessed that shewas so worried for him that she just wasn’t thinking clearly. That was amistake. She knew she shouldn’t allow her concern to cloud her thinking, lestshe cause the harm she feared.Richard held the back of Kahlan’s neck as he kissed her brow. “I’m relieved thatyou weren’t hurt. You frighten me the way you get it in your head to put yourlife before mine. Don’t do it again?”Kahlan smiled. She didn’t promise, but instead changed the subject. “I’m worriedabout you leaving the safety of the palace. I don’t like you being out therewhen a Sister of the Dark is about.”“I’ll be all right.”“But the Jarian ambassador is here, along with representatives from Grennidon.They have huge standing armies. There are a few others here, too, from smallerlands-Mardovia, Pendisan Reach, and Togressa. They’re all expecting to meet withyou tonight.”Richard hooked a thumb behind the wide leather belt. “Look, they can surrenderto you. They’re either with us, or against us. They don’t need to see me, theyjust have to agree to the terms of surrender.”Kahlan touched her fingers to his arm “But you are Lord Rahl, the Master ofD’Hara. You made the demands. They expect to see you.”“Then they’ll have to wait until tomorrow night. Our men come first. GeneralKerson is right: if the men can’t fight, we’re in trouble. The D’Haran army isthe main reason the lands are ready to surrender. We can’t show any weakness inour ability to lead.”“But I don’t want us to be separated,” she whispered.Richard smiled. “I know. I feel the same, but this is important.”“Promise me you’ll be careful.”His smile widened. “I promise. And you know that a wizard always keeps hispromise.”“All right, then, but hurry back.”“I will. You just stay away from that Marlin fellow.”He turned to the others. “Cara, you and Raina stay here, along with Egan. Ulic,I’m sorry I yelled at you. I’ll make it up to you by letting you come with me soyou can watch me with those big blue eyes and make me feel guilty.” He turned tothe last of them. “Berdine, since I know that you three will make my lifemiserable if I don’t take at least one of you, you can come with me.”Berdine turned a grin on Nadine. “I’m Lord Rahl’s favourite.”Nadine, rather than looking impressed, appeared dumbfounded, as she hadthroughout most of the preceding conversation. Nadine finally turned a haughtylook on Richard. She folded her arms across her breasts.“And are you going to boss me around, too? Are you going to tell me what to do,like you seem to enjoy doing to everyone else?”Richard, rather than getting angry, as Kahlan thought he might at the insult,looked more disinterested than ever.“There are a lot of people fighting for our freedom, fighting to stop theImperial Order from enslaving the Midlands, D’Hara, and eventually Westland. Ilead those willing to fight for their own freedom and on behalf of innocentpeople who would otherwise be enslaved. I lead because circumstances have placedme in command. I don’t do it for power or because I enjoy it. I do it because Imust.“To my enemies, or potential enemies, I deliver demands. To those loyal to me, Iissue orders.“You are neither, Nadine. Do as you wish.”Nadine’s freckles disappeared as her cheeks mantled.Richard lifted his sword a few inches and let it drop back, unconsciouslychecking that the blade was clear in its scabbard. “Berdine, Ulic, get yourthings and meet me out at the stables.”Richard scooped up Kahlan’s hand and pulled her toward the door. “I need to talkto the Mother Confessor. Alone.”Richard took Kahlan down the passageway crowded with muscular D’Haran guardswearing dark leather and chain mail and bristling weapons to an empty side hall.He pulled her around the corner, into the shadow beneath a silver lamp, andbacked her up against a wall panelled in age-mellowed cherry.With a finger, he gently squashed the end of her nose. “I couldn’t leave withoutkissing you good-bye.”Kahlan grinned. “Didn’t want to kiss me in front of an old girlfriend?”“You’re the only one I love. The only one I’ve ever loved.” Richard’s featuresdistorted in chagrin. “You can understand how it would be if one of your oldboyfriends showed up.”“No, I can’t.”His face went blank for just an instant and then went crimson. “Sorry. I wasn’tthinking.”Confessors had no boyfriends as they grew up.The deliberate touch of a Confessor destroyed a person’s mind, and in its placeleft only mindless devotion to the Confessor who had touched him with her power.A Confessor always had to restrain her grip on her power, lest it beaccidentally released. It generally wasn’t difficult; her power grew as she didand, being born with the power, the ability to restrain it came as naturally asbreathing.But in the throes of passion, an experience she hadn’t grown up with, it wasimpossible for a Confessor to maintain that restraint. A lover’s mind wouldunintentionally be destroyed in the distracted, unrestrained apex of aConfessor’s passion.Confessors, even if they wished it, had no friends save other Confessors. Peoplefeared them, feared their power. Men, especially, feared Confessors. No manwanted to get within striking distance of a Confessor. Confessors didn’t havelovers.A Confessor chose her mate for qualities desirable in her daughter, for thefather he could be. A Confessor never chose for love, because the act of lovingwould destroy the person she loved. No one willingly wed a Confessor; aConfessor chose her mate, and took him with her magic before they were wedded.Men feared a Confessor who had yet to choose a mate. She was a destroyer amongthem, a predator, and men her potential prey.Only Richard had defeated that magic. His unequivocal love for her hadtranscended her power. Kahlan was the only Confessor she had ever heard of whohad the love of a man, and could reciprocate that love. In her whole life, shehad never imagined she would fulfil that most exalted of human desires: love.She had heard it said that there was only one true love in a person’s life. WithRichard, that was more than a saying: :it was the dead cold truth.More than any of it, though, she simply loved him, helplessly and completely.That he loved her, and they could be together, sometimes left her numb withdisbelief.She dragged her finger down his leather baldric. “So, you never think about her?You never wonder... ?”“No. Look, I’ve known Nadine since I was little. Her father, Cecil Brighton,sells herbs and remedies. I’d bring him rare plants now and again. He’d let meknow if there was something he wanted but couldn’t find. When I went out toguide people. I’d keep an eye out for what he needed.“Nadine always wanted to be like her father, to learn what herbs helped peopleand to work in his shop. She’d go with me sometimes, to learn how to findcertain plants.”“She only went with you to look for plants?”“Well, no. There was a little more :to it than that. I-well-sometimes I’d govisit her and her parents. I’d go for walks with her, even if her father hadn’tasked me to find some herb. I danced with her at the midsummer festival, lastsummer, before you came to Hartland. I liked her. But I never led her to think Iwanted to marry her.”Kahlan smiled and decided to end his twisting in the wind. She wrapped her armsaround his neck and kissed him. She wondered briefly at something he had said toNadine, at what more there had been, but then her mind was spinning from thefeel of his powerful arms around her, and his soft lips against hers. His tongueglided across the inside of her front teeth, and she sucked it in. A big handslid down her back and pulled her hard against him.Then she pushed him away. “Richard,” she said breathlessly, “what about Shota?What if she causes trouble?”Richard blinked, trying to banish the lust from his eyes. “To the underworldwith Shota.”“But in the past, as much trouble as Shota caused, she always seemed to have anugget of truth in the trouble she wrapped around it. In her own way, she wastrying to do what needed doing.”“She’s not going to keep us from getting married.”“I know, but-”“When I get back, we’ll get married, and that will be that.” His smile made asunrise seem boring. “I want you in that big bed of yours that you keeppromising me.”“But how can we get married, now, unless we do it here? It’s a long way to theMud People. We promised the Bird Man, and Weselan and Savidlin, and all therest, that we would be wedded as Mud People. Chandalen protected me on myjourney here, and I owe him my life. Weselan made me my beautiful blue weddingdress, with her own hands, out of cloth that probably took her years to earn.They took us in. They made us Mud People. The Mud People have sacrificed for us.Many have given their lives for our cause.“I know it’s not the kind of wedding most women dream of-a whole village ofhalf-naked people covered in mud dancing around bonfires, calling the spirits tocome join two of their people, having a feast that goes on for days with thosestrange drums and ritual dancers acting out stories and all the rest... but it’sthe most heartfelt ceremony we could ever have.“Right now we can’t leave Aydindril to go on a long journey to the Mud Peoplejust because we want to. Just for us. Everyone else is depending on us. There isa war going on.”Richard pressed a gentle kiss against her forehead. “I know. I want the MudPeople to marry us, too. And they will. Trust me. I’m the Seeker. I’m giving ita lot of thought. I have a few ideas.” He sighed. “But right now I have to go.Take care of things. Mother Confessor. I’ll be back tomorrow. Promise.” Shehugged him so tight it made her aims hurt.He finally separated from her and looked down into her eyes. “I’ve got to go,before it gets any later, or I’ll have men getting hurt in the dark up in thosepasses.” He paused. “If... if Nadine needs anything, would you see that she getsit? A horse, or food, or supplies, or whatever. She’s not a bad person. I don’twish her ill. She doesn’t deserve what Shota did to her.”Kahlan nodded and then laid her head against his chest. She could hear his heartbeating. “Thank you for getting this outfit to be married in. You look morehandsome than ever.”She closed her eyes against the pain of the words she had heard back in the redroom. “Richard, why didn’t you get angry when Cara said those cruel things?”“Because I understand what was done to them. I’ve been in that world of madness.Hate would have destroyed me; forgiveness in my heart was the only thing thatsaved me. I don’t want hate to destroy them. I didn’t want to let mere wordsruin what I’m trying to give them. I want them to learn to trust. Sometimes youcan only gain trust by giving it.”“Maybe you’re having an effect. Despite what Cara said back there, earlier todayshe said some things that make me think they understand.” Kahlan smiled andtried to lighten the subject of the Mord-Sith. “I heard you were outside todaywith Berdine and Raina, taming chipmunks.”“Taming chipmunks is easy. I was doing something considerably more difficult; Iwas trying to tame Mord-Sith.” His one was grave, leading to the impression thathis thoughts were far away. “You should have seen Berdine and Raina. They weregiggling, just like little girls. I almost wept at the sight.”Kahlan smiled to herself in wonder “And here I thought you were just out therewasting time. How many more Mord-Sith are back at the People’s Palace inD’Hara?”“Dozens.”“Dozens.” It was a daunting thought. “At least chipmunks are plentiful.” Hestroked a hand down her hair as lie held her head to his chest. “I love you,Kahlan Amnell. Thanks for being patient.”“I love you, too, Richard Rahl.” She clutched his tunic and pressed herselfagainst him. “Richard, Shota still scares me. Promise me that you really willmarry me.”He let out a little, breathy laugh and then kissed the top of her head. “I loveyou more than I could ever tell you. There is no one else, not Nadine, notanyone; I swear an oath on my gift. You are the only one I will ever love. Ipromise.”She could hear her heart drumming in her ears. That was not the promise she hadasked for. He pushed away. “I have to go.”“But...”He looked back around the comer. “What? I have to go.” She shooed him with ahand. “Go. Hurry back to me.” He blew her a kiss and then he was gone. Sheleaned a shoulder against the corner as she watched his billowing gold caperecede down the hall, and listened to the jangle of chain mail and weapons andthud of boots as a raft of guards trailed in his wake."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7The two remaining Mord-Sith and Egan waited in the red sitting room. The door tothe bedroom was closed.“Raina, Egan, I want you to go protect Richard,” Kahlan announced as she walkedin.“Lord Rahl told us to remain with you. Mother Confessor,” Raina said. Kahlanlifted an eyebrow. “Since when have you followed Lord Rahl’s orders when itcomes to matters of protecting him?”Raina grinned wickedly: a rare sight. “Fine by us. But he will be angry that weleft you alone.”“I have Cara and a palace packed with guards and surrounded by troops. Thebiggest danger to me is that one of those hulking guards will step on my foot.Richard has only five hundred men, and Berdine and Ulic. I’m worried for him.”“What if he sends us back?”“Tell him... tell him... Wait.”Kahlan crossed the room to the mahogany writing desk and pulled paper, ink, andpen from under the lid. She dipped the pen, leaned over, and wrote: Stay warmand sleep snug. It gets cold in the mountains in the spring. I love you-Kahlan.She folded the paper and handed it to Raina. “Follow at a distance. Wait untilafter they set up camp, then give him this message. Tell him that I told you itwas important. It will be dark, and he won’t send you back in the dark.”Raina unfastened two buttons at the side of her leather outfit and slid the notein between her breasts. “He will still be angry, but at you.”Kahlan smiled. “The big fellow doesn’t scare me. I know how to cool his scowl.”Raina smiled conspiratorially. “I’ve noticed.” She looked over her shoulder at apleased-looking Egan. “Let’s do our duty and deliver the Mother Confessor’smessage to Lord Rahl. We need to find some slow horses.”After they had departed, Kahlan glanced to a watchful Cara, and then knocked onthe bedroom door. “Come in,” came Nadine’s muffled voice.Cara followed Kahlan in. Kahlan didn’t object; she knew that if she had askedher to wait outside, Cara would have ignored the order. The Mord-Sith paid noheed to orders if they thought protecting her or Richard required that they didso.Nadine was rearranging things in her scruffy travel bag. Her head hung low,looking into the bag, and her thick hair dangled down around her head, hidingher face. Periodically, she pushed her kerchief in under that veil of hair. “Areyou all right, Nadine?”Nadine sniffled, but didn’t look up. “II’ you call being the biggest fool thespirits ever saw all right, then I guess I’m just dandy.”“Shota has played me for a fool, too. I know how you feel.”“Sure.”“Is there anything you need? Richard wanted me to see to it that you haveanything you need. He’s concerned about you.”“And pigs fly. He just wants me out of your fine room, and on the road home.”“That’s not true. Nadine. He said that you were a nice person.” Nadine finallystraightened and pushed some of her hair back over her shoulder. She wiped hernose and stuffed the kerchief in a pocket in her blue dress.“I’m sorry. You must hate me. I didn’t mean to come busting in here and try totake your man. I didn’t know. I swear, I didn’t know, or I’d never have done it.I thought... Well, I thought he wanted...” The word “me” was drowned in thesound of her tears.Trying to imagine the devastation of losing Richard’s love stirred Kahlan’ssympathy. She gave Nadine a comforting hug and sat her on the bed. Nadine pulledthe kerchief back out of her pocket and pressed it against her nose as she wept.Kahlan sat down on the bed next to the woman. “Why don’t you tell me about it,about you and Richard, if it would make you feel better? Sometimes, it helps tohave someone listen.”“I feel so foolish.” Nadine flopped her arms down in her lap as she made aneffort to control her weeping. “It’s my own fault. I always liked Richard.Everybody liked Richard. He’s nice to everyone, I’ve never seen him like he wastoday. He seems so different.”“He is different, in some ways,” Kahlan said. “Even from last autumn, when Ifirst met him. He’s been through a lot. He’s had to sacrifice his old life, andhe’s been tested by events. He’s had to learn to fight, or die. He’s had to facethe fact that George Cypher wasn’t his real father.”Nadine looked up in astonishment. “George wasn’t his father? Then who was?Someone named Rahl?”Kahlan nodded. “Darken Rahl. The leader of D’Hara.”“D’Hara. Until the boundary came down, I only thought of D’Hara as an evilplace.”“It was,” Kahlan said. “Darken Rahl was a violent ruler who sought conquestthrough torture and murder. He had Richard captured and tortured nearly todeath. Richard’s brother, Michael, had betrayed him to Darken Rahl.”“Michael? Well, I guess that really doesn’t surprise me. Richard loved Michael.Michael is an important man, but he has a mean streak. If he wants something, hedoesn’t care who it hurts. Though no one had the nerve to voice it, I don’tthink anyone was too unhappy when he left .and never came back.”“He died in the fight with Darken Rahl.”Nadine didn’t seem unhappy about this news either. Kahlan didn’t say thatRichard had had Michael executed for betraying the people he was supposed to beprotecting, for his responsibility in the deaths of so many.“Darken Rahl was trying to use magic that would have enslaved everyone under hisrule. Richard escaped and killed his real father, and saved us all. Darken Rahlwas a wizard.”“Wizard! And Richard defeated him?”“Yes. We all owe Richard a great debt for saving us from what his father wouldhave taken the world into. “Richard is a wizard, too.”Nadine laughed at what she thought was a joke. Kahlan didn’t so much as smile.Cara stood stone-faced. Nadine’s eyes widened. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”“Yes. Zedd was his grandfather. Zedd was a wizard, as was Richard’s real father.Richard was born with the gift, but he doesn’t know very much about how to useit.”“Zedd’s gone, too.”“He came with us in the beginning, he’s been fighting with us, and trying tohelp Richard, but a short time ago, in a battle, he was lost. I fear he waskilled up at the Wizard’s Keep. up on the mountain above Aydindril. Richardrefuses to believe Zedd was killed.” Kahlan shrugged. “Maybe he wasn’t. That oldman was the most resourceful person I’ve ever met other than Richard.”Nadine wiped her kerchief across her nose. “Richard and that crazy old man werebest friends. That was what Richard meant, then. when he said that hisgrandfather taught him about herbs. Everyone comes to my father for remedies. Myfather knows just about everything about !herbs, and I hope someday to know halfof what he knows, but my father always said that he wished he knew half as muchas old Zedd. I never knew Zedd was Richard’s grandfather.”“No one did, not even Richard. It’s a long story. I’ll tell you a bit of themore important parts.” Kahlan looked down at her own hands nested in her lap.“After Richard stopped Darken Rahl, he was taken by the Sisters of the Light tothe Old World, so that they could teach him to me his gift. They would have kepthim at the Palace of the Prophets, in a web of magic that slowed time. Theywould have had him there for centuries. We thought he was lost to us.“The Palace of the Prophets turned out to be infested with Sisters of the Dark,and they wanted to free the Keeper of the Underworld. They tried to use Richardto those ends, but he escaped his confinement and stopped them. In the process,the Towers of Perdition that kept the Old and New Worlds separated weredestroyed.“Now, Emperor Jagang, of the Imperial Order in the Old World, is no longerrestrained by those towers and is trying )to bring all the world under his rule.He wants Richard dead for thwarting him. Jagang is powerful and has a huge army.We have been unwillingly cast into a war for our destiny, our freedom, and forour very existence. Richard leads us in that war.“Zedd, acting in his capacity as First Wizard, named Richard the Seeker ofTruth. It’s an ancient post, created three thousand years ago in the great warthat raged at that time. It’s a solemn assignment of rectitude granted whenthere is grave need. A Seeker is above any law but his own, and backs hisauthority with the Sword of Truth and its attendant magic.“Fate occasionally touches us all in ways we don’t always understand, but itsometimes seems to have a death grip on Richard.”Nadine, her eyes wide, finally blinked “Richard? Why Richard? Why is he in thecenter of all this? He’s just a woods guide. He’s just a nobody from Hartland.”“Just because kittens are born in the hearth oven, that doesn’t make themmuffins. No matter where they’re born, it’s their destiny to grow up to go outand kill rats. “Richard is a very special kind of wizard: a war wizard. He isthe first wizard with both sides of the magic. Additive and Subtractive, to beborn in three thousand years. Richard didn’t choose to do all this; he does thisbecause we are all depending on him to help us remain a free people. Richardisn’t one to stand by and watch while people are hurt.”Nadine looked away. “I know.” She fumbled with the kerchief in her fingers. “Ikind of lied to you before.”“About what?”She heaved a sigh. “Well, when I told you about Tommy and Lester. I made itsound like it was me who knocked out their front teeth. The truth is, I was onmy way to meet Richard. We were to go for a walk and look for some maple-leafedviburnum. My father needed some of the inner bark to make a decoction for a babywith colic, and he had run out. Richard knew where there was a patch.“Anyway, when I was on my way through the woods, to Richard’s place, I cameacross Tommy Lancaster and his friend Lester on their way back from huntingdoves. I’d fended off Tommy’s unwanted advances in front of some of his pals,and made him look a fool. I guess I kind of slapped him and called him a name.“He thought to pay me back when he came across me in the woods. He had Lesterhold me down, and he... well, about the time he got his pants pushed down aroundhis knees, Richard showed up. That took the starch right out of Tommy. Richardtold them to be off, and said that he was going to tell their fathers.“Instead of doing the smart thing, and leaving, the two of them decided to put afew bird arrows in Richard to teach him a lesson to mind his own business.That’s why Tommy and Lester don’t have any front teeth. He told them that thatwas for what they wanted to do to me. He broke their valuable yew bows, and toldthem that that was for what they wanted to do to him. He told Tommy that if heever again tried to do that to me, he’d slice off... well, you know.”Kahlan smiled. “That sounds like the Richard I know. It doesn’t sound like he’sreally changed all that much. The Tommys and Lesters are just bigger, now, andmeaner.”Nadine gave a little shrug. “I guess.” She looked up when Cara held out Nadine’stin cup, which Cara had filled from the ewer on the washstand. Nadine took asip. “I can’t believe people are really trying to kill Richard. I can’t believeanyone would want to kill him.” She smirked. “Even Tommy and Lester only want toknock out his teeth.” She settled the cup in her lap. “I can’t believe his ownfather would want to kill him. You said Darken Rahl had Richard tortured. Whydid he do that?”Kahlan glanced up at Cara. “It’s in the past. I really don’t want to stir up thememories.”Nadine reddened. “Sorry. I almost forgot that he... and you...” She drew herfingers across her cheeks, wiping away a fresh tear. “It just doesn’t seem fair.“You”-Nadine flicked a hand in frustration-”you’ve got everything. You havethis, this palace. I never even knew such things existed. It looks like somevision come from the spirit world. And you have such fine things, andmagnificent clothes. That dress makes you look like; one of the good spirits.”Nadine looked Kahlan in the eye. “And you’re so beautiful. It doesn’t seem fair.You even have beautiful green eyes; I just have dumb brown eyes. You must havehad men lined up around the palace your whole life, wanting you. You must havehad more suitors than most women can even dream of. You have everything. Youcould have your pick of any man in the Midlands... and you pick a man from myhome.”“Love isn’t always fair; it just is. And your eyes are lovely.” Kahlan twinedher fingers together and hooked her hands over a knee. “What did Richard meanwhen he said to you that ‘there is no “us,”‘and that you of all people shouldknow that?”Nadine’s eyes slid closed as she turned her face away. “Well, I guess a lot ofgirls in Hartland wanted Richard, not just me. He wasn’t like anyone else. Hewas special. I remember one time when he was about ten or twelve and he talkedtwo men out of fighting. He always had a way about him. He got the two men tolaughing, and they left my pa’s shop with an arm over each other’s shoulder.Richard was always a rare person.”“The mark of a wizard,” Kahlan said. “So, Richard must have had a lot ofgirlfriends?”“No, not really. He was nice to everyone, and polite, and helpful, but he neverseemed to fall for anyone. That only seemed to make them want him all the more.He didn’t have a special person, a love. But a lot of us girls wanted to be theone. After Tommy and Lester tried to... to. .lay claim to me-”“To rape you.”“Yeah. I guess that was what it really was. I never like to think that someonewould really do that to me, like that-holding me down and all. But I guess thatthat’s what they were trying to do: rape me.“Some people don’t call it that, though. Sometimes, if a boy does that to agirl, then he’s laid claim to her, and the parents say that it was because thegirl encouraged it, and so they make the girl and boy get married before sheturns up pregnant. I know girls who had to do that.“Many younglings, mostly those of the country folk, have it already decided forthem who they’re to marry. But sometimes a boy doesn’t like who he’s supposed tomarry, and so he lays claim to who he wants, like Tommy tried to do to me, inthe hope that either he’ll get her pregnant and she’ll have to marry him, ortheir parents will make them wed because she’s been spoiled. Tommy was supposedto wed skinny Rita Wellington, and he hated her. Sometimes, the girl really doesencourage it, because she doesn’t like who her parents picked for her. Mostly,though, younglings go along as they’re told.“My parents never decided for me, some parents don’t. They say that it’s arecipe for trouble as often as it is one for happiness. They said they figuredthat I’d know for myself what I wanted. A lo. of the girls who didn’t have itdecided for them wanted Richard. Some of them, like me, waited long past when weshould have been married and mothers two or three times over.“After Richard stopped Tommy, Richard kind of always looked out for me. Istarted to think it was more than him just watching out for me, at last. Istarted to think that he really wanted to be with mi. It seemed like he wasreally noticing me, as a woman, not as some kid he knew who he was protecting.“I was sure of it at the midsummer festival last year. He danced with me morethan any of the other girls. They were turning green with envy. Especially whenhe held me close. Right then and there, I wanted him to be the one. No one else.“I thought that after the festival things would change, that he would tell methat I meant more to him than I had before. I thought he would come around andcourt me more serious. He didn’t.”Nadine held the cup of water between her knees with one hand as she worked herkerchief in the fingers of her other hand. “I had other boys who wanted to courtme, and I didn’t want to throw my future away if Richard was never going to cometo his senses, so I got it in my head to give him a shove.”“A shove?”Nadine nodded. “Besides some of the other boys, Richard’s brother, Michael, wasalways after me, too. I think just because he always was jealous of Richard. Atthe time I wasn’t exactly against the idea of Michael courting me. I didn’t knowhim so well, but he was already making somebody of himself. I thought Richardwould never be anything more than a woods guide. Not that that’s bad. I’m nobodyspecial, either. Richard loved the woods.”Kahlan smiled. “He still does. If he could. I’m sure he would like nothing morethan being a simple woods guide. But he can’t. So, what happened, then?”“Well, I figured that if I kind of made Richard just a bit jealous, maybe hewould get down off the fence and make; a move for me. Sometimes men need ashove, my ma always says. So I gave him a good shove.”Nadine cleared her throat. “I let him catch me kissing Michael. I made sure hesaw that I was having a good time of it.”Kahlan drew a deep breath as her eyebrows lifted. Nadine may have grown up withRichard, but she certainly didn’t know him.“He never even got angry at me, or jealous, or anything,” Nadine said. “He wasstill nice to me, and he still watched out for me, but he never came visiting,and he never asked me to go for walks after that. When I tried to talk to himabout it, to explain, he just wasn’t interested.”Nadine stared off. “He had that look in his eyes, like he did today. That lookthat means he just doesn’t care. I never knew what it meant until I saw itagain, today. I think he really had cared and expected me to show him I cared bybeing loyal, but I’d betrayed him.”Nadine dabbed at her lower lids as she took labored breaths. “Shota told me thatRichard was going to marry me, and I was so happy that I just didn’t want tobelieve it when he said it wasn’t so. I didn’t want to believe that look in hiseyes, so I pretended to myself that it didn’t mean anything, but it does. Itmeans everything.”“I’m sorry, Nadine,” Kahlan said softly.Nadine stood and set the tin cup on the side table. Tears streamed down hercheeks and dripped off the side of her jaw. “Forgive me for coming in here likeI did. He loves you, not me. He never loved me. I’m happy for you. MotherConfessor; you have a good man who will watch over you and protect you andalways be kind. I know he will.”Kahlan stood and took Nadine’s hand, giving it a comforting squeeze. “Kahlan. Myname is Kahlan.”“Kahlan.” Nadine still couldn’t meet Kahlan’s eyes. “Does he kiss good? I alwayswondered. When I laid awake in bed, I always wondered.”“When you love someone with all your heart, their kisses are always good.”“I guess. I never had a good kiss. One I really enjoyed like the ones I’vedreamed about, anyway.” She smoothed the front of her dress as she made aneffort to compose herself. “I wore this because blue is Richard’s favoritecolor. You should know that-blue is his favorite color dress.”“I know,” Kahlan whispered.Nadine pulled her bag closer. “I don’t know what I’m thinking, forgetting myprofession, while I ramble on about what’s over and done.” Nadine rummagedaround in her bag. bringing out a small piece of a sheep’s horn with a corkstopper in the square-cut end. The horn was marked with scratches and circles.She pulled the cork stopper aid dipped in a finger, then lifted it to Cara. Carabacked away. “What do you think you are doing?”“It’s an unguent, made from aum, to take away the sting, and comfrey and yarrowto help stop the bleeding so the wound can heal smooth. The cut on your cheek isstill oozing. If this doesn’t stop the blood, then I have some foxglove, but Ithink this will do it. It’s not only the ingredients but how much of each, my pasays, that’s the secret that makes the medicine work.”“I don’t need it,” Cara said.“You’re very pretty. You don’t want to end up with a scar, now do you?”“I have many scars. You just can’t see them.”“Where are they?”Cara scowled, but Nadine didn’t back away.“All right,” Cara said at last. “Use your herbs, if it will get you away fromme. But I’m not undressing so you can peer at my scars.”Nadine smiled assurance and then dabbed the brownish paste on Cara’s cheek.“This will take away the pain of the cut, but it’s going to sting for just aminute, and then it will ease.”Cara didn’t so much as blink. It must lave surprised Nadine because she pausedand looked at Cara’s eyes before resuming her work. When she was finished,Nadine replaced the stopper in the horn and placed it back in her bag.Nadine glanced around the room. “I’ve never seen such a beautiful room. Thankyou for letting me use it.”“Of course. Do you need anything? Some supplies... anything?” Nadine shook herhead, wiped her nose a last time, and stuffed the kerchief back in the pocket.She remembered the cup, downed the rest of the water, and put it in her bag,too.“It’s a bit of a journey, but I have some silver left. I’ll be fine.” She resteda hand on her bag as she stared down at her trembling fingers. “I never thoughtmy journey would end like this. I’m going to be the laugh of Hartland, runningoff after Richard like I did.” She swallowed. “What’s Pa going to say?”“Did Shota tell him, too, that you were going to marry Richard?”“No. I hadn’t met Shota yet.”“What do you mean? I thought she was the one who told you to come here- that youwere to marry him.”“Well”-Nadine made a wincing smile-”that wasn’t exactly how it happened.”“I see.” Kahlan clasped her hands. “Well, exactly how did it happen?”“It will sound silly-like I’m some moonstruck girl of twelve.”“Nadine, just tell me.”Nadine considered a moment before finally sighing. “I suppose it doesn’t matter.I started having these, well, I don’t know what to call it. I’d see Richard, orrather, I thought I saw Richard. I’d see him out of the comer of my eye, and I’dturn, but he wouldn’t be there. Like one day, when I was walking in the woodslooking for new shoots, and I saw him standing beside a tree. so I stopped, buthe was gone.“Every time, I knew he needed me. I didn’t know how I knew, but I knew. I knewit was important, that he was in trouble of some sort. I never questioned it. “Itold my parents that Richard needed me and I had to go help him.”“And they believed you? They had faith in your visions? They simply let you setout?”“Well, I never quite explained it to them. I just told them that Richard hadsent me a message that he needed my help, and I was going to him. I guess thatI, well, I might have kind of made them think I knew where I was going.”Kahlan was beginning to see that Nadine didn’t explain things to anyone verywell. “Then Shota came?”“No. Then I left. I knew Richard needed me, and so I started out.”“Alone? You simply thought to march off and search the entire Midlands for him?”Nadine shrugged self-consciously. “It never occurred to me to wonder how I wouldfind him. I knew he needed me, and I felt that it was important, so I left to goto him.” She smiled, as if to reassure Kahlan. “I came right to him-straight asan arrow. It all worked out exactly right.” Her cheeks flushed. “Except the partabout him wanting me, I mean.”“Nadine, had you been having any . . strange dreams? Then, or now?” Nadinebrushed back a thick strand of hair. “Strange dreams? No, no strange dreams. Youknow, I mean no stranger than any dreams. Just regular dreams.”“What kind of ‘regular’ dreams do you have?”“Well, you know, like when you dream that you’re little again, and lost in thewoods, and none of the trails lead you where you know they should, or like whenyou dream that you can’t find all the right ingredients for a pie, and so you goto a cave and borrow them from a bear that can talk. Things like that. Justdreams. Dreams that you can fly, or breathe underwater. Crazy things. But justdreams. Like I’ve always had. Nothing different.”“Have they changed recently?”“No. If I remember them, they’re the same sort of things.”“I see. I guess that all sounds pretty normal.”Nadine pulled a cloak from her bag. “Well, I guess I’d better get a start. Withluck, I’ll be home for the spring festival.”Kahlan frowned. “You’ll be lucky to make midsummer festival.” Nadine laughed. “Ishould think no. It can’t take longer back than here. Just two weeks or so. Ionly left just after the moon’s second quarter; it’s not yet full.”Kahlan stared dumbly. “Two weeks.” It had to have taken Nadine months to travelall the way from Westland, especially in the winter when she would have had tohave started, and especially across the Rang’Shada mountains. “Your horse musthave had wings.”Nadine laughed, then it died out as her smooth brow puckered. “Funny you shouldmention that. I don’t have a horse. I walked.”“Walked,” Kahlan repeated incredulously.“Yes. But since I’ve left, I’ve had dreams of flying on a horse with wings.”Kahlan was having to work at keeping track of the shifting pieces of Nadine’sstory. She tried to think of how Richard would ask questions. It had made herfeel foolish when Richard put words to all the questions she should have askedMarlin, but never thought of. Though he had taken the sting out of it by tellingher that she had done the right thing, it still embarrassed her that she hadfound out next to nothing important from Marlin when she had had her chance.Confessors didn’t need to know much about questioning people; once she hadtouched a person with her power, a Confessor simply asked the criminal toconfess if they had truly committed the crimes they had been found guilty of,and if the answer was yes-which it always was, except in a couple of rareinstances-then to recount the details.There was no art to it, and none needed. It was an infallible way of seeing toit that political dissenters weren’t falsely accused and found guilty of crimesthey didn’t commit, simply to have them eliminated through a convenientexecution.Kahlan was determined to do a better job of asking Nadine questions. “When didShota come to see you? You still haven’t told me that part.”“Oh. Well, she didn’t exactly come to see me. I came across her up in themountains. She had a lovely palace, but I never had the chance to go inside. Iwasn’t there long. I wanted to get to Richard.”“And what did Shota tell you? What were her words? Her exact words?”“Let’s see...” Nadine pressed her first finger to her upper lip as sherecollected. “She welcomed me. She offered me tea--she said that I had beenexpected-and had me sit with her. She made Samuel leave my bag when he tried todrag it away, and she told me not to be afraid of him. She asked where I wastravelling, and I told her that I was going to my Richard-that he needed me.Then she told me things about Richard, things about his past that I would knowabout. It astonished me that she would know so much about him, but I thoughtthat she must know him.“And then she told me things about me that she would have no way of knowing.Like longings and ambitions-being a healer, using my herbs, things like that.That’s when I realized she was a mystic. I don’t remember her exact words aboutany of that part.“She told me that it was true about Richard needing me. She said that we weregoing to be married. She said that the sky had told her it was so.” Nadinelooked away from Kahlan’s eyes. “I was so happy. I don’t think I’d ever beenthat happy.”“The sky. What else?”“Then she said that she didn’t want to delay my journey to Richard. She said thewind hunts him-whatever that means-and that I was right that he needed me, and Ishould hurry and be on my way. She wished me luck.”“That’s all? She must have said something else.”“No, that’s all.” Nadine buttoned her bag closed. “Except she said a prayer forRichard, I think.”“What do you mean? What did she say? Her exact words.”“Well, when she turned away, to go back to her palace as I was getting up toleave, I heard her whisper, real solemn-like, ‘May the spirits have mercy on hissoul.’“Kahlan felt her arms under the white satin sleeves of her dress prickle withgooseflesh. She only remembered to take a breath when she felt her lungs burningfor want of air.Nadine hoisted her bag. “Well, I’ve caused you enough grief. I’d best be on myway home.”Kahlan spread her hands. “Look. Nadine, why don’t you stay here for a while.”Nadine paused with a bewildered look. “Why?”Kahlan desperately searched for an excuse. “Well, I wouldn’t mind hearingstories about Richard when he was growing up. You could tell me about all thetrouble he got himself into.” She made herself smile encouragement. “I’d reallylike that.”Nadine shook her head. “Richard wouldn’t want me here. He’ll be angry if hecomes back and I’m still here. You didn’t see the look in his eyes.”“Nadine, Richard isn’t going to throw you out on your ear without letting youhave a chance to rest up for a few days before you start back. Richard isn’tlike that. He said ‘anything she needs.’ I think you could use a rest for a fewdays, more than anything else.”Nadine shook her head again. “No. You’ve already been more kind to me than I’vea right to expect. You and Richard belong together. You don’t need me around.“But thank you for the offer. I can’t believe how kind you are-it’s small wonderRichard loves you. Any other woman in your place would’ve had me shaved bald andsent out of town in the back of a manure wagon.”“Nadine, I’d really like you to stay.” Kahlan wet her lips. “Please?” she heardherself add.“It might cause hard feelings between you and Richard. I don’t want to be thecause of that. I’m not that kind of person.”“If it was a problem, I wouldn’t have asked. Stay. At least for a few days. Allright? You could stay right here in this room you like so much. I’d... reallylike you to stay.”Nadine studied Kahlan’s eyes for a long moment. “You really want me to stay?Really?”“Yes.” Kahlan could feel her nails digging into her palms. “Really.”“Well, to tell the truth. I’m not in a hurry to go home and confess myfoolishness to my parents. All right, then, if you really want me to, I’ll stayfor a while. Thank you.”Despite having important reasons for asking Nadine to stay, Kahlan couldn’t helpfeeling like a moth flying into a flame."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Kahlan forced a smile. “Good, then. You’ll stay. It will be... nice, to have youstay for a visit. We’ll talk, you and l. About Richard. I mean. I’d like to hearyour stories about him growing up.” She realized she must sound like she wasbabbling, and made herself stop. Nadine beamed. “I can sleep in the bid?”“Don’t be silly. Of course in the bed. Where else?”“I have a blanket, and could sleep on the carpet so as not to-”“No. I won’t have it. I’ve invited you to stay. I want you to feel at home, justlike other guests who use this room.”Nadine giggled. “Then I’d be sleeping on the floor. I sleep on a pallet on thefloor in the back room above our shop.”“Well,” Kahlan said, “here you will sleep in the bed.” Kahlan glanced at Carabefore going on. “Later, I’ll show you around the palace, if you’d like, but fornow, why don’t you just unpack some of your things and have a rest while Caraand I go see to some important business.”“What business?” Cara asked.The woman is as silent as a stone through all this, Kahlan thought, and now shehas to ask questions. “Marlin business.”“Lord Rahl told us to stay away from Marlin.”“He’s an assassin sent to kill Richard. There are things I need to know.”“I want to come, too, then.” Nadine said. She looked back and forth betweenKahlan and Cara. “I can’t imagine anyone wanting to kill a person, much lessRichard. I want to see what such a person looks like. I want to look into hiseyes.”Kahlan emphatically shook her head. “It’s not something you want to see. We needto question him. and it isn’t likely to be pleasant.”“Really?” Cara asked, her voice brightening. “Why?” Nadine asked. “What do youmean?”Kahlan held up a finger. “Enough. I say this for your own good; Marlin isdangerous and I don’t want you down there. You are a guest. Please respect mywishes while you are a guest in my home.” Nadine studied the floor at her feet.‘Of course. Forgive me.”“I will tell the guards that you are a guest, and if you would like anything-tohave some of your things washed, a bath. anything-just ask and they will seethat someone from the staff helps you. I’ll be back after a while and we canhave dinner. We’ll talk over dinner.”Nadine turned to her bag on the bed. “Sure. I didn’t mean to meddle. I don’twant to be in the way.” Kahlan hesitantly touched a hand to The back of Nadine’sshoulder. “I didn’t mean to sound like I was ordering you around. This businesswith someone trying to hurt Richard just has me on edge, that’s all. I’m sorry Inearly bit your head off. You’re a guest. Please enjoy our home as your own.”Nadine smiled over her shoulder. “I understand. Thanks.” She really was abeautiful young woman: attractive figure and face, and an innocent quality,despite what truths Kahlan feared she danced around. Kahlan could easily see whyRichard would have beer attracted to her.She wondered at what random wisp of fate had matched Richard with her, insteadof this one. Whatever the reason, she thanked the good spirits that it was so,and prayed fervently that it would remain so.More than anything, Kahlan wanted this perfidious gift from Shota to vanish. Shewanted this tempting, beautiful, dangerous young woman away from Richard, tojust send Nadine away. If only she could do so.After telling the guards that Nadine was a guest, and once Kahlan and Cara haddescended the carpeted stairs at the far end of the hall and were alone on therichly appointed landing, Cara seized Kahlan’s arm and spun her around to ahalt. “Are you crazy!”“What are you talking about?”Cara gritted her teeth as she leaned closer. “A witch woman sends your man awedding gift-it’s the bride, and you invite her to stay!”Kahlan rubbed a thumb against the round, polished sphere of ironwood topping thenewel post. “I had to. Isn’t it obvious?”“What is obvious to me is that you should have done as the little strumpetsuggested; you should have shaved her bald and sent her away in the back of amanure wagon.”“She’s a victim in this, too. She is Shota’s pawn.”“Her tongue has a distaste for the truth. She still wants your man. If you can’tsee that in her eyes, then you aren’t the wise woman I thought you to be.”“Cara, I trust Richard. I know he loves me. If there’s one thing at the core ofRichard’s way of looking at things, it’s trust and loyalty. I know my heart issafe in his hands.“How would it look if I acted like a jealous woman and sent Nadine away? If Idon’t show my trust in him, then I’m not honoring his loyalty to me. I can’tafford to even appear to betray his trust in me.”Cara’s scowl didn’t so much as soften. “That bucket won’t carry water for me.All that may be true, but that isn’t why you asked Nadine to stay. You want tostrangle her as much as I do, I can see it in your green eyes.”Kahlan smiled, trying to see herself in the dark, polished ironwood. She couldonly see a blur of a reflection. “Hard to fool a sister of the Agiel. You’reright. I had to ask Nadine to stay because there’s something going on, somethingdangerous. The danger won’t simply go away if I make Nadine leave.”With a gloved hand, Cara wiped a strand of blond hair back from her face.“Dangerous? Like what?”“Therein lies the problem: I don’t know. And don’t you dare even think ofhurting her. I have to find out what’s really going on, and in order to do thatI may need Nadine. I don’t want to have to go hunting her when I could have kepther at hand and in sight in the beginning.“Look at it this way. Would it have been the right thing to do to simply sendMarlin away when he arrived and announced he wanted to kill Richard? Would thathave solved the problem? Why are we keeping him around? To find out what’s goingon, that’s why.”Cara wiped at the unguent on her check as if it were a smudge of dirt. “I thinkyou are inviting trouble to your bed.”Kahlan had to blink at the burning sensation in her eye. “I know. Me, too. Theobvious thing to do, the thing I ache to do, is to send Nadine away on thefastest horse I can find. But no problem is that easily solved, especially onesent by Shota.”“You mean what Shota told Nadine, about the wind hunting Lord Rahl?”“That’s part of it. I don’t know what it means, but it doesn’t sound to me likeit’s something Shota dreamed up.“Worse, though, is Shota’s prayer: ‘May the spirits have mercy on his soul.’ Idon’t know what she meant by that, but it terrifies me. That, and that I mightbe making the biggest mistake of my life.“But what choice do I have? Two people show up on the same day, one sent to killhim and the other sent to marry him. I don’t know which is more dangerous, but Ido know that neither can be simple dismissed. If someone is trying to stick aknife in your back, closing your eyes doesn’t make you safe.”Cara’s face eased from that of a Mord-Sith to the softer features of a woman whounderstood another woman’s fears. l will watch your back. If she crawls intoLord Rahl’s bed, I will throw her out before he ever finds her there.” Kahlansqueezed Cara’s arm. “Thanks. Now, let’s get down to the pit.” Cara didn’tbudge. “Lord Rahl said he does not want you down there.”“And since when have you started following orders?”“I always follow his orders. Especially the ones I know he means. He means thisone.”“Fine. You can watch over Nadine while I go down there.” Cara snatched Kahlan’selbow as she started to turn away. “Lord Rahl does not want you in danger.”“And I don’t want him in danger. Cara, I felt a fool when Richard asked me allthose questions that we failed to ask Marlin. I want the answers to thosequestions.”“Lord Rahl said he would ask them.”“And he’s not going to be back until tomorrow night. What happens in themeantime? What if something is going on and it’s too late to stop it by then?What if Richard is killed because we sat on our hands following his orders?“Richard is afraid for me, and that’s keeping him from thinking clearly. Marlinhas information about what’s going on, and it’s foolhardy to let time pass whilethe danger grows.“What was it that you said to me, before? Something about hesitation being theend of you? Or the end of those you care about?” Cara’s face went slack, but shedidn’t answer.“I care about Richard, and I’m not going to risk his life by hesitating. I’mgoing to get the answers to those questions.”Cara smiled at last. “I like your thinking. Mother Confessor. But then, you area sister of the Agiel. The orders were ‘ill-advised, if not foolish. Mord-Sithonly follow Lord Rahl’s foolish orders when his male pride is at stake, not hislife.“We will go have a little discussion with Marlin, and get the answer to everyone of those questions, and more. When Lord Rahl comes back, we will be able togive him the information he needs-if we haven’t already ended the threat.”Kahlan popped the palm of her hand against the round newel post. “That’s theCara I know.”As they went lower in the palace, below the levels with carpets and panelling,down to the narrow, low-ceilinged halls where light came only from lamps, andeven lower, where only torches lit the way, the air went from light andspring-fresh to stale, and then to rank with the heavy smell of damp, moldystone.Kahlan had walked those confining halls more times than she wished to recall.The pit was where they took confessions of the condemned. She had taken herfirst there, from a man who had killed his neighbor’s daughters after committingunspeakable acts on them. Of course, each of those times she had beenaccompanied by a wizard. Now, she was going to see a wizard being held there.When they had passed out of earshot of a squad of soldiers guarding anintersection with two stairwells, and before they reached the turn that wouldtake them to the pit hall that would be crowded with all the soldiers she hadstationed there, Kahlan glanced over. Cara was an attractive woman, but a womanwith an air of menace about her as she swept the empty hall with vigilant gazes.“Cara, can I ask you a personal question?”Cara clasped her hands behind her back as she strode along. “You are a sister ofthe Agiel. Ask.”“Before, you told me that hesitation can be the end of you, or those you careabout. You were talking about yourself, weren’t you?”Cara slowed to a stop. Even in the hissing torchlight, Kahlan could see that herface had paled.“Now that is truly a personal question.”“You don’t have to tell me. I don’t mean it to sound like an order, or anything.I was just wondering, woman to woman. You know so much about me, and I hardlyknow anything about you, except that you are Mord-Sith.”“I wasn’t always Mord-Sith,” Cara whispered. Her eyes had lost the menace, andshe looked like nothing so much a” a frightened little girl. Kahlan could tellthat Cara was no longer seeing the empty stone hall.“I guess that there is no reason not to tell you. As you said, I am not to blamefor what was done to me. Others were responsible.“Every year, in D’Hara, they would select a few girls to be trained asMord-Sith. It is said that the greatest cruelty is. drawn from those with thekindest hearts. Rewards were paid for the names of gills who fit therequirements. I was an only child, one of the requirements, and of the rightage. The girl, and her parents, are taken, the parents to be murdered in thetraining of a Mord-Sith. My parents didn’t know that our names had been sold toI he hunters.”Cara’s face and tone had lost their emotion. She had gone blank, as if she weretelling of last year’s beet harvest. But her words, if not her tone, carriedmore than enough emotion.“My father and I were out back of the house, butchering chickens. When theycame, I had no idea what it meant. My father did. He saw them coming down thehill, through the trees. He surprised them. But there were more than he hadseen, or could handle, and he had the advantage for only a few moments.“He screamed at me, ‘Cari, the knife! Cari, get the knife!’ I snatched it upbecause he said to. He was holding three of the men. My father was big. “Hescreamed again. ‘Cari, stab them! Stab them! Hurry!’ “ Cara looked into Kahlan’seyes. “I just stood there. I hesitated. I didn’t want to stab someone. To hurtsomeone. I just stood there. I couldn’t even kill the chickens. He did thatpart.”Kahlan didn’t know if Cara was going to go on. In the dead silence, she decidedthat if she didn’t, the questions would end there. Cara looked away fromKahlan’s eyes, staring off into the visions, and then she did go on.“Someone walked up beside me. I’ll never forget it as long as I live. I lookedup, and there was this woman, this beautiful woman, the most beautiful woman Ihad ever seen, with blue eyes and blond hair in a long braid. The sunlightcoming through the leaves danced in little patches across her red leatheroutfit.“She smiled down at me as she took the knife out of my hand. Not a pretty smile,but a smile like a snake. That’s what I always called her, in my mind, afterthat-Snake. When she straightened, she said, ‘Isn’t that sweet? Little Caridoesn’t want to hurt anyone with her knife. That hesitation just made you aMord-Sith, Cara. It begins.”Cara stood rigid, as if turned to stone. “They kept me in a little room, withlittle grates in the bottom of the door. I couldn’t get out. But the rats couldget in. At night, when I finally could stay awake no longer, and fell asleep,the rats would sneak into my empty little room and bite my fingertips, and mytoes. “Snake beat me nearly to death for blocking the grate. Rats like blood. Itexcites them. “I learned to sleep in a ball, with my hands in fists and tuckedin against my belly, where they couldn’t get at my fingers. But they couldusually get at my toes. I tried taking my shirt off and wrapping it around mybare feet, but then if I didn’t sleep on my stomach, they would bite my nipples.Laying bare-chested on the cold stone, with my hands under my stomach, was atorture in itself, but it usually kept me awake longer. If the rats couldn’t geta my toes, they would bite me somewhere else-my ears, or nose, or legs-until Iwoke with a start and scared them away.“In the night, I could hear the other girls cry out when a rat bit them awake. Icould always hear one of them weeping in the night, calling for her mother.Sometimes, I realized it was my own voice I heard.“Sometimes, I would wake when rats scratched my face with their little claws,their whiskers brushing my cheeks as their cold little noses pressed against mylips, sniffing for a crumb. I thought to stop eating what they brought me, andleft the bowl of gruel and slab of bread on the floor, hoping the rats would eatmy dinner and leave me alone.“It didn’t work. The food only brought hordes of rats, and then, when it wasgone....I always ate every scrap of dinner, after that, when Snake brought it.“Sometimes she would taunt me when she brought my dinner. She would say, ‘Don’thesitate, Cara, or the rats will get your dinner.’ I knew what she meant bysaying, ‘Don’t hesitate.’ It was her way of reminding me what my hesitation hadcost me and my parents. When they tortured my mother to death in front of me.Snake said, ‘See what happens, Cara, because you hesitated? Because you were tootimid?’“We were taught that Darken Rahl was ‘Father Rahl.’ We had no father but he. Atmy third breaking, when they told me to torture my real father to death, Snaketold me not to hesitate. I didn’t. My father begged for mercy. ‘Cari, please,’he wept. ‘Cari, spare yourself becoming what they want.’ But I never hesitated.After that, my only father was Father Rahl.”Cara brought her Agiel up and stared at it as she rolled it in her fingers. “Iearned my Agiel for that. The very same Agiel they trained me with. I earned theappellation Mord-Sith.”Cara looked back into Kahlan’s eyes, as if from a great distance, not merely thetwo steps that separated them. From the other side of madness. A madness othershad put there. Kahlan felt as if she, too, was turned to stone by what she sawin the depths of those blue eyes.“I have been Snake. I have stood in the dappled sunlight, over young girls, andtaken the knife from their hands when they hesitated, not wanting to hurtanyone.” Kahlan had always hated snakes. She? hated them more now. Tears tickledher face as they ran down her cheeks leaving wet tracks. “I’m sorry, Cara,” shewhispered. Her stomach roiled. She wanted nothing more than to put her armsaround the woman in red leather before her, but she couldn’t make herself moveso much as a finger.Torches hissed. In the distance, she heard muffled snippets of conversation fromthe guards. A soft ripple of laughter floated up the hall. Water weeping fromthe stone ceiling echoed as it splashed in a little green puddle not far away.Kahlan could hear her own heart pounding in her ears. “Lord Rahl freed us fromthat.”Kahlan remembered Richard telling her that he had almost wept at the sight ofthe other two Mord-Sith giggling like little girls as they fed seeds tochipmunks. Kahlan understood the leap that was a simple giggle. Richardunderstood the madness. Kahlan didn’t know if these women could ever return fromit, but if they were to have a chance, it was only because of Richard.The iron returned to Cara’s grim expression. “Let’s go find out how Marlinplanned to harm Lord Rahl. But don’t expect me to be gentle if he hesitates inconfessing every detail.”Under Sergeant Collins’s watchful eye, a D’Haran soldier unlocked the iron doorand backed away, as if the rusty lock was the only thing protecting everyone inthe palace from the sinister magic below, in the pit. Two more big soldierseffortlessly dragged the heavy ladder closer.Before Kahlan could pull open the door, she heard approaching voices andfootsteps. Everyone turned to look up the hall. It was Nadine, with foursoldiers escorting her.Nadine rubbed her hands together, as if to warm them, as she stepped through thering of hulking, leather-clad guards. Kahlan didn’t return the woman’s brightsmile. “What are you doing down here?”“Well, you said I was a guest. As pretty as your rooms are, I wanted to go for awalk. I asked the guards to show me the way down here. I want to see thiskiller.”“I told you to wait upstairs in your room. I told you that I didn’t want youcoming down here.”Nadine’s dainty brow drew together. “I’m getting just a little tired of beingtreated like a backwater bumpkin.” She lifted her delicate nose. “I’m a healer.I’m respected, where I come from. People listen when I speak. When I tellsomeone to do something, they do it. If I tell a councilman to take a potionthree times a day and to stay in bed, he very well drinks his medicine threetimes a day from his bed until I tell him he can leave it.”“I don’t care who jumps when you speak,” Kahlan said. “Here, you jump when Ispeak. Do you understand?”Nadine pressed her lips together as she slanted her fists on her hips. “Now, youlook here. I’ve been cold and hungry and scared. I’ve been played for a fool bypeople I don’t even know. I was minding my own business, going about my life,when I was sent on this pointless journey only to arrive at a place where peopletreat me like a leper as my thanks for coming to help. I’ve been yelled at bypeople I don’t know and humiliated by a boy I grew up with.“I thought I was going to marry the man I wanted, but I had that rug yanked outfrom under my feet. He doesn’t want me, he wants you. Well, so be it. Nowsomeone is trying to kill the man I travelled all this way to see, and you tellme it isn’t any of my business!”She shook a finger at Kahlan. “Richard Cypher saved me from Tommy Lancasterlaying claim to me. If it wasn’t for Richard, I’d be married to Tommy, now.Instead, Tommy had to marry Rita Wellington. If it wasn’t for Richard, I’d bethe one with black eyes all the time. I’d be barefoot buck at his shack andpregnant with the offspring of that pig-faced bully.“Tommy ridiculed me for fixing herbs to help people. He said it was stupid for agirl to mix herbs. He said my father should have had a boy, if he wanted someoneto work in his shop touching herbs that sick people needed. I’d never have anyhope of being a healer if it wasn’t for Richard.“Just because I’m not the one to be his wife, that doesn’t mean that I don’tcare about him. I grew up with him. He’s still a boy from my home. We take careof our own, like they’re family, even if they aren’t. I’ve a right to know whatdanger he’s in! I’ve a right to see what sort of man from your world would wantto kill a boy from my home who’s helped me!”Kahlan was in no mood to argue. She was also in no mood to spare the woman whatshe might see.She studied Nadine’s brown eyes, trying :to tell if what Cara had said, thatNadine still wanted Richard, was true. If it was, Kahlan couldn’t tell simply bylooking into her eyes.“You want to see a man who wants to kill us, Richard and me?” Kahlan gripped thelever and threw open the door. “Fine. You shall have your wish.”She gestured to the men with the ladder. They pushed it through the opening anddown into the darkness until it thudded in place. Kahlan yanked a torch from abracket and thrust it in Cara’s hand. “Let’s show Nadine what she wishes tosee.”Cara checked Kahlan’s resolve, found it rock solid, and then started down theladder. Kahlan held her arm out in invitation. “Welcome to my world, Nadine.Welcome to Richard’s world.”Nadine’s determination faltered for only an instant before she huffed andstarted down the ladder after Cara.Kahlan glanced around at the guards. “Sergeant Collins, if he comes up throughthis door before us, he had better not get out of this hall alive. He wants tokill Richard.”“On my word as a D’Haran soldier, Mother Confessor, harm won’t get a glimpse ofLord Rahl.”With a hand signal from Sergeant Collins, soldiers drew steel. Archers nockedarrows. Big hands unhooked crescent-bladed axes from weapons belts.Kahlan gave the sergeant a nod of approval, took another torch, and started downthe ladder."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9Dank, heavy air wafted up from the pit as Kahlan followed Nadine down theladder. Using the hand with the torch to also hold the side of the ladder madeher have to endure the heat of the flame near the side of her face, but she wasalmost happy for the smell of pitch because it covered the stink of the air inthe pit. Lower down, the wavering light from the torches lit more than the stonewalls; they lit the dark figure in the center of the room.Kahlan stepped off the ladder as Cara rammed her torch into a bracket on theslime-covered wall. Kahlan slipped hers into one on the opposite wall. Nadinestood transfixed, looking at the man covered in dried blood hunched before them.Kahlan stepped past her to stand beside Cara. Cara’s brow drew down as shepeered at Marlin.His head hung forward, and his eyes were closed. His breathing was deep, slow,and even. “He’s asleep,” Cara whispered.“Asleep?” Kahlan whispered back. “How can he be asleep while he’s standing uplike that?”“I... don’t know. We always make new prisoners stand, sometimes for days. Withno one to talk to and nothing to do but consider their doom, it drains theirresolve-takes the fight right out of them. It’s an insidious form of torment. Ihave had men beg to be beaten, rather than have to stand, alone, hour afterhour.”Marlin was snoring softly. “How often does this happen-that they simply fallasleep?”Cara put one hand on a hip as she wiped her mouth with the other. “I’ve had themfall asleep, but that wakes them for sure. If they move from the spot wherewe’ve told them to stand, the link brings on the pain. We don’t have to bethere; the link works no matter where we are. I have never even heard of a manfalling asleep and remaining on his feet.”Kahlan looked over her shoulder, past Nadine, and up the long ladder to thelight coming through the doorway. She could see the tops of soldiers’ heads, butnone were so bold as to stare down into the pit, where there were apt to bedeeds of magic.Nadine stuck her head between them. “Maybe it’s a spell. Magic, of some sort.”She straightened, pulling her head back, when she received only glares inanswer. More out of curiosity than an attempt to wake him, Cara lightly jabbedMarlin’s shoulder. She pushed her finger into his chest, and his stomach. “Hardas a rock. His muscles are all locked rigid.”“That must be how he’s able to stand there like that. Maybe it’s some sort oftrick he learned as a wizard.” Cara didn’t seem convinced. With a twitch of herhand so slight Kahlan almost missed it, Cara spun her Agiel up into her fist.The pain Kahlan knew it caused her to hold her Agiel didn’t show on her face. Itnever did.Kahlan snatched Cara’s wrist. “You don’t need to do that. Just wake him. Anddon’t use your link with his mind, his magic, to give him pain, unless it’sabsolutely necessary. Unless I tell you so.”Displeasure registered on Cara’s face “I think it’s necessary. I can’t havethis. I can’t hesitate to exert my control.”“Cara, there is a great gulf between prudence and hesitation. This whole thingwith Marlin has been more than odd from the first. Let’s just take it one stepat a time. You’ve said that you have control over him; let’s not be impetuous.You do have control, don’t you?”A slow smile spread on Cara’s lips. “Oh, I have control, no doubt of that. Butif you insist, I will wake him the way we sometimes wake our pets, then.”Cara bent forward at the waist, slipped her left arm around his neck, tilted herhead, and gently gave Marlin a long kiss on the mouth. Kahlan felt her face gored. She knew that Denna sometimes awakened Richard like that, before torturinghim again.With a satisfied smirk, Cara drew back. Like a cat coming awake from a nap,Marlin’s lids slid open. His eyes had that quality in them again-that qualitythat made Kahlan’s very soul want to shrink back.This time, she saw more than she had before. These eyes were not merely those ofgreat age. These were eyes unvisited by fear.As he regarded the three of them with slow, unflinching, calculatingdeliberation, he bent his fisted hands back at the wrists and arched his back ina feline stretch. A depraved grin spread onto his face, a taint of wickednessexpanding like blood seeping through white linen.“So. My two darlins have returned.” His disquieting eyes seemed to see more thanthey should, to know more than they should. “And they’ve brought a new bitchwith ‘em.”Marlin’s voice had been almost boyish, before. Now, it was deep and gravelly, asif coming from a muscled man weighing twice as much-a voice steeped withunquestioned power and authority. It exuded invincibility. Kahlan had neverheard such a dangerous voice.She retreated a step, clutching Cara’s arm and pulling her back with her. ThoughMarlin didn’t move, she felt the coiling of menace. “Cara” -Kahlan put a handbehind, forcing Nadine back as she withdrew another step-”Cara, tell me you’vegot him. Tell me you have control.” Cara was staring, mouth agape, at Marlin.“What... ?” She abruptly unleashed a powerful strike. Her armored fist onlysnapped his head a few inches to the side. It should have taken him from hisfeet. Marlin regarded her with a bloody smile. He spit out broken teeth. “Nicetry, darlin,” Marlin said in a rough voice. “But I’ve got control of your linkwith Marlin.”Cara rammed her Agiel in his gut. His body flinched with the jolt, his armsflopping ineffectually. His eyes, though, never lost the deadly look. The smiledidn’t falter as he watched her. Cara took two steps back on her own.“What’s going on?” Nadine whispered. “What’s wrong? I thought you said he washelpless.”“Get out,” Cara whispered urgently to Kahlan. “Now.” She glanced up the ladder.“I’ll hold him off. Lock the door.”“Wanting to leave?” Marlin asked in the grating voice as they moved toward theladder. “So soon? And before we’ve had a little talk. I’ve enjoyed listening tothe talks you two have had. I’ve learned so much. I never knew about Mord-Sith.But I do, now.”Kahlan halted. “What are you talking about?”His predatory gaze moved from Cara to Kahlan. “I learned of your touching lovefor Richard Rahl. It was so thoughtful of you to reveal the limits of his gift.I suspected much of it, but you confirmed the extent. You also confirmed mysuspicion that he would be able to recognize another with the gift, and that itwould raise his suspicions. Even you were able to see something wrong inMarlin’s eyes.”“Who are you?” Kahlan asked as she pushed Nadine back with her toward theladder.Marlin shook with a belly laugh. “Why, none other than your worst nightmare, mylittle darlins.”“Jagang?” Kahlan whispered incredulously. “Is that it? Are you Jagang?” Thebelly laugh boomed around the stone walls of the pit. “You have me cornered. Iconfess. It is I, the dream walker himself. I’ve borrowed this poor fellow’smind, just so I could pay you a little visit.”Cara slammed her Agiel against the side of his neck. A puppet arm swept heraside.Cara returned almost instantly, crashing into his kidneys, trying to take himdown. He didn’t budge. With jerky movements, he reached down, caught her braid,and flung her back against the wall behind him as if she were a stick doll.Kahlan winced at the sound of Cara smacking the stone. She rolled facedown onthe floor, blood soaking into her blond hair. Kahlan shoved Nadine toward theladder. “Get out!” Nadine seized a rung on the ladder. “What are you going todo?”“I’ve seen enough. This ends now.”Kahlan went for Marlin, or Jagang, or whoever it was. She had to end it with herpower.Screaming, Nadine shot past Kahlan and across the floor as if she were slidingacross ice. Marlin caught the flailing woman, spun her around, and gripped herby the throat in one hand. Nadine, her eyes wide, choked for air.Kahlan skidded to a halt as Marlin twitched up a cautionary finger. “Tut-tut.I’ll crush her throat.”Kahlan retreated a step. Nadine gulped air when he released the pressure. “Onelife, for all those you will otherwise kill? Do you think the Mother Confessorwould be unwilling to make such a choice?”At Kahlan’s words, Nadine, in renewed panic, writhed in his grip, her fingersdigging frantically at his hands. Even if Marlin didn’t crush her throat, he wastouching her, and if Kahlan took him with her power, Nadine would be lost, too.“Perhaps you would, but don’t you want to know what I’m doing here, darlin?Don’t you want to know my plans for your love, the great Lord Rahl?”Kahlan turned and screamed up the shaft of light. “Collins! Shut the door! Lockit!”Above, the door slammed shut. Only the spitting torches remained to light thepit. The sound of the door clanging shut added its echo to the hissing torches.Kahlan turned back to Marlin. Keeping her eyes on him, she began slowly edgingaround the room. “What are you? Who are you?”“Well, actually, that’s a difficult philosophical question to answer in termsyou would understand. A dream walker is able to slip into the infinite spaces oftime between thoughts, when a person, who they are, their very essence, doesn’texist, and inhabit that person’s mind. What you see before you is Marlin, aloyal little lapdog of mine. I’m the flea on his back that he brought into yourhouse with him. He is a host, which I thought to use for... certain things.”Nadine thrashed against her captor, causing him to squeeze tighter to maintainhis grip. Kahlan pursed her lips and urged her to shush. If she continuedfighting him, she would get herself strangled. As if snatching the lifeline ofKahlan’s command, Nadine stilled in his grip, and was able at last to pullbreaths. “Your host will shortly be a dead best,” Kahlan said.“He’s expendable. Unfortunately, for’ you, the damage has already been done,thanks to Marlin.”With a furtive glance to the side, Kahlan checked her slow progress toward thefacedown Cara. “Why? What has he done?”“Why, Marlin has brought you and Richard Rahl down for me. Of course, you haveyet to suffer what I have wrought, but he has done it. I had the privilege ofwitnessing the glory of it.”“What have you done? What are you doing here in Aydindril?” Jagang chuckled.“Why, I’ve been enjoying myself. Yesterday, I even went to watch a Ja’La game.You were there. Richard Rahl was there. I saw you both. I wasn’t pleased to seethat he changed the broc, replacing it with a lightweight one. He’s turned itinto a game for the weak. It’s meant to be played with a heavy ball, and by thestrongest, the most aggressive and brutish players-those with the true lust towin.“Do you know what Ja’La means, darlin?”Kahlan shook her head as she ran through a list of her options and priorities.Foremost on the list was using her power to stop this man before he escaped thepit, but first she had to find out all she could, if they were to stop hisplans. She had already failed once at that task. She wouldn’t fail again.“It’s from my native tongue. The full and proper name is Ja’La dh Jin-The Gameof Life. I don’t like the way Richard Rahl corrupted it.”Kahlan had almost reached Cara. “So you infested this man’s mind so that youcould come and watch children play a game? I thought that the great andall-powerful Emperor Jagang would have better things to do.”“Oh, I’ve had better things to do. Much better.” His grin was maddening. “Yousee, you thought I was dead. I wanted you to know that you failed to kill me atthe Palace of the Prophets. I wasn’t even there. I was enjoying the charms of ayoung woman, at the time, actually. One of my newly captured slaves.”“So you aren’t dead. You could have sent us a letter, and not have to go to allthis trouble. You came for some other reason. You were here with a Sister of theDark.”“Sister Amelia had a little task to perform, but I’m afraid she’s no longer aSister of the Dark. She betrayed her oath to the Keeper of the underworld, sothat I could destroy Richard Rahl.”Kahlan’s foot touched Cara. “Why didn’t you tell us all this before, when wefirst captured Marlin? Why wait until now?”“Ah, well, I had to wait until Amelia returned with what I sent her for. I’m notone to take chances, you see. Not anymore.”“And what did she steal from Aydindril for you?” Jagang chuckled derisively.“Oh, not from Aydindril, darlin.” Kahlan squatted down beside Cara. “Why wouldshe no longer be sworn to the Keeper? Not that I’m unhappy about it. but whywould she betray her oath?”“Because I placed her in a double bind. I gave her the choice of being sent toher master, where she would suffer for eternity at his merciless hands for herpast failure with your love, or to betray him, and escape his grasp for now,only to intensify his anger for later.“And, darlin, you should be unhappy about it, very unhappy, as it will be thedownfall of Richard Rahl.”Kahlan forced herself to speak. “An empty threat.”“I don’t make empty threats.” His smile widened. “Why do you think I went to allthis trouble? To be there at its doing, and to let you know that it is I,Jagang, who has brought it upon you. I’d hate to have you think it was simplychance.”Kahlan shot to her feet and took an angry stride toward him. “Tell me, youbastard! What have you done!”Marlin’s hand jerked up, raising one finger. Nadine made a strangling sound.“Careful, Mother Confessor, or you’ll be denying yourself hearing the rest ofit.”Kahlan stepped back. Nadine gasped for air. “That’s better, darlin.“You see, Richard Rahl thought that by destroying the Palace of the Prophets, hekept me from gaining the knowledge it contained.” Marlin’s puppet fingerwaggled. “Not so. Prophecies were not unique to the Palace of the Prophets.There have been prophets about, elsewhere, and there are prophecies elsewhere.Here, for example, there are prophecies in the Wizard’s Keep. In the Old World,there are prophecies, too. I found a number of them when I excavated an ancientcity that once thrived at the time of the great war.“Among them, I found one that will be Richard Rahl’s undoing. It is anextraordinarily rare type of prophecy, called a bound fork. It enforces a doublebind on its victim.“I have invoked the prophecy.”Kahlan didn’t have the slightest idea what he was talking about. She quicklysquatted and lifted Cara’s head. Cara scowled up at her.“You idiot,” Cara whispered under her breath, “I’m fine. Leave me. Get answers.Then signal, and I will use my link to kill him.”Kahlan dropped Cara’s head and stood. She started inching back toward theladder.“You’re talking babble, Jagang.” She moved more quickly, hoping Jagang wouldthink she had found Cara dead. She was halfway to the ladder, although she hadno intention of trying to escape. She intended to unleash her power on him.Nadine, or no Nadine. “I don’t know anything about prophecy. You’re making nosense.”“Well, darlin, it’s like this, either Richard Rahl lets the firestorm of what Ihave wrought rage out of control, fulfilling one fork of the prophecy, in whichcase it kills him, too, or he tries to stop what I have done, fulfilling theother fork of the prophecy. On that fork, he is destroyed. See? He can’t win, nomatter which he chooses. Only one of two events can now evolve, only one of thetwo forks. He has the power to choose which one, but either will be his doom.”“You are a fool. Richard will choose neither.” Jagang roared with laughter. “Oh,but he will. I’ve already invoked the prophecy, through Marlin. Once invoked,there is no turning back from a bound fork prophecy. But enjoy your delusions,if it will please you. It will make the fall all that much more painful.”Kahlan paused in her tracks. “I don’t believe you.”“You will. Oh, yes, you will.” - “Empty threats! What proof have you?”“Proof will come on the red moon.”“There is no such thing. You are full of empty threats.” Kahlan lifted a fingertoward him as her fear dissolved in the heat of rage. “But I want you to know ofmy threat, Jagang, and it is not empty. I have seen the bodies of the women andchildren you ordered slaughtered in Ebinissia, and I swore undying vengeance onyour Imperial Order. Even prophecy will not stop us from defeating you.”If nothing else, she needed to at least provoke him into revealing the prophecy.If they knew it, perhaps they could thwart it. “That is my prophecy to you,Jagang. Unlike your pretend prophecy, it has words to it.”His belly laugh echoed around the pit. “Pretend? Let me show you the prophecy,then.”One of Martin’s hands lifted. Lightning exploded in the pit. Kahlan covered herears as she ducked, hunching to protect tier head. Stone chips howled throughthe air. She felt a sharp pain as one sliced across her arm and another spearedthe side of her shoulder. She felt the sickening feeling of warm blood soakingdown her sleeve.Above their heads, the lightning jumped and leaped across the wall, incising thestone, leaving in its wake lettering she could just see through the blindingflashes. The crash of lightning cut off, leaving jagged afterimages across hervision, the smell of dust and smoke choking her lung;, and the cacophony echoingin her head. “There you go, darlin.”Kahlan rose to her feet, squinting up at the wall. “Gibberish. That’s all it is.It means nothing.”“It’s in High D’Haran. According to the records, in the last war we had captureda wizard, a prophet, and of course since he was loyal to the House of Rahl, myancestor dream walkers were denied access to his mind.“So, they tortured him. In a delirious state, and missing half his intestines,he gave forth this prophecy. Have Richard Rahl translate it.” He leaned towardher with a venomous sneer. “Though I doubt he will want to tell you what itsays.”He pressed a kiss against Nadine’s cheek. “Well, it’s been delightful, my littlejourney, but I’m afraid Marlin must be going. Too bad, for you, that the Seekerwasn’t here with his sword. That would have ended it for Marlin.”“Cara!” Kahlan went for him, mentally beseeching the good spirits’ forgivenessfor what she was going to have to do to Nadine, too.Cara sprang up. With impossible strength, Jagang heaved Nadine through the air.The woman cried out as she tumbled violently into Kahlan. Kahlan landed with agrunt onto her back on the stone. Her vision prickled with floating dots oflight. She couldn’t feel anything. She feared it might have broken her back. Butsensation returned with tingling pain when she twisted to the side. She gaspedto get her wind back as she struggled to sit up.Cara, on the far side of the room, let out a shrill, piercing scream. Shecrumpled to her knees, covering her ears with her forearms as she shrieked.Marlin leaped onto the ladder as she and Nadine wrestled to untangle themselvesfrom each other.Marlin, hands and feet to each side of the ladder, sprang up in spurts, like acat going up a tree.The torches puffed out, plunging them into darkness.Jagang laughed as he ascended. Cara screamed as if she were being torn limb fromlimb. Kahlan finally managed to shove Nadine aside and shuffle on her hands andknees toward the sound of Jagang’s mocking laughter. She could feel bloodsoaking all the way down her sleeve.The iron door exploded outward, clanging against the stone on the other side ofthe hall, the sound resonating with a boom through the halls. A man cried out asit crushed him. With the door gone, a shaft of light bathed the ladder. Kahlanscrambled to her feet and went for it.As she stretched up for the ladder, the pain in her shoulder caused her torecoil with a cry. She reached up and yanked out the sharp shard of stone. Theblood dammed behind it gushed from the wound.Fast as she could, Kahlan scuttled up the ladder in pursuit of Marlin. She hadto stop him. There was no one else who could do it. With Richard gone, she wasthe magic against magic for all these people. Her wounded arm shook with theeffort, and she could barely grasp the ladder. “Hurry!” Nadine called out fromright behind. “He’ll get away!” From below, Cara’s shrieks seared Kahlan’snerves.Kahlan had once felt the awesome agony of an Agiel for a fraction of a second.Mord-Sith endured the same pain whenever they held their Agiel, yet not theslightest grimace ever registered on their faces. Mord-Sith lived in a world ofpain; years of torture had disciplined them in their ability to disregard it.Kahlan couldn’t imagine what it would take to cause a Mord-Sith to scream likethat.Whatever was happening to Cara, it was killing her, there was no doubt inKahlan’s mind.Kahlan’s foot slipped through a rung. Her shinbone whacked painfully against therung above. She yanked her leg back in a rush to get to Jagang. Her flesh grazedthe side, catching and driving a long splinter into her calf. She cursed in painand charged up the ladder.Clambering through the opening at the top, she slipped and fell to her hands andknees in a chaos of viscera. Sergeant Collins stared up at her with dead eyes.Jagged white ends of rib bones stuck up, holding back the ripped leather andmail of his uniform. His entire torso was rent from his throat to his groin.A dozen or so men writhed in agony on the floor. Others were still as death.Swords were embedded to their hilts in the stone walls. Axes lodged there, too,as if stuck in soft wood.An enemy with magic had scythed through these men, but not without cost; closeby lay an arm, severed above the elbow, By what it was wearing, she recognizedit as Marlin’s. The fingers of the hand clenched and unclenched with measuredregularity.Kahlan pushed herself up and turned to the door. She clasped wrists with Nadineand helped her up into the hall. “Careful.”Nadine gasped at the bloody sight. Kahlan expected her to faint, or screamhysterically. She didn’t.Men bristling swords, axes, pikes, and bows were charging up the hall from theleft. The hall to the right was empty, silent, and dark beyond a lone torch.Kahlan went right. To her credit, Nadine chased right after her. The screamscoming from the pit sent shivers up Kahlan’s spine."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10Beyond the last, hissing torch, the hall disappeared into blackness. A soldierlay in a crumpled heap to the side, like dirty laundry waiting to be collected.His blackened sword lay in the center of the hall, its blade fractured into atangled fray of twisted steel strips.Kahlan paused and studied the still silence ahead. Just as there was nothing tobe seen, there was nothing to be heard. Marlin could be anywhere, hiding aroundany intersection, crouched in any comer, with Jagang’s self-satisfied smirk onhis face as he lingered in the darkness to put an end to the pursuit. “Nadine,stay here.”“No. I told you, we protect our own. He wants to kill Richard. I’ll not let himget away with it, not as long as I have a chance to help.”“The only chance you will have is to get yourself killed.”“I’m going.”Kahlan had neither the time nor desire to argue. If Nadine was going to go, atleast she could make herself useful; Kahlan needed her hands free. “Then grabthat torch.”Nadine yanked it from the bracket and waited expectantly. “I have to touch him,”Kahlan told her. “If I touch him, I can kill him.”“Who, Marlin or Jagang?”Kahlan’s heart pounded against her ribs. “Marlin. If Jagang could get into hismind, I expect he can get out. But who knows? If nothing else, at least Jagangwill be gone, and his minion will be dead. That will end it. For now.”“That’s what you were trying to do back in the pit? What did you mean aboutmaking a choice, one life for all the others?”Kahlan grabbed her face, squeezing her cheeks. “You listen to me. This isn’tjust some Tommy Lancaster wanting to rape you; this is a man who is trying tokill us all. I have to stop him. If anyone else is touching him when I do, theywill be destroyed along with him. If you or anyone else is touching him, I won’thesitate. Do you understand? I can’t afford to hesitate. Too much is at stake.”Nadine nodded. Kahlan released her. She redirected her anger to the task athand. She could feel blood dripping from the ends of the fingers of her lefthand. She didn’t think she could lift her left arm, and she needed her right armto touch Marlin. At least Nadine could hold a torch for her. Kahlan hoped thatshe wasn’t making a mistake, hoped that Nadine wouldn’t slow her. She hoped shewasn’t letting Nadine come for the wrong reasons. Nadine took Kahlan’s righthand and placed it to her bleeding left shoulder. “We don’t have time to fixthis, now. Hold that wound closed as tight as you can, until you need your hand,or you’ll lose too much blood and not be able to do what you must.”A bit chagrined. Kahlan squeezed the wound. “Thanks if you’re going to come,then stay behind me, and just light the way. If soldiers can’t stop him, youcan’t hope to do better. I don’t want you getting hurt for nothing.”“Got it. Right behind you.”“Just remember what I said, and don’t get in my way.” Kahlan stretched up,looking back behind Nadine to the soldiers. “Use arrows or spears if you get ashot, but stay behind me. Get some more torches. We need to corner him.”Some of them trotted back to retrieve torches as Kahlan started away. Nadineheld her torch out ahead of her as she trotted to keep up. The flame flutteredand roared in the wind of their flight, illuminating the walls, ceiling, andfloor for a short distance around them, creating an undulating island of lightin a sea of blackness. Close behind, men with torches created their own islandsof light. Heavy breathing echoed through the hall as they ran, along with thethud of boots, the jangle of chain mail, the clang of steel, and the roar offlame. Above it all, in her mind, Kahlan could still hear Cara’s screams. Kahlanhalted at an intersection, panting to get her breath as she looked ahead, andthen down the corridor that branched to the right. “Here!” Nadine pointed toblood on the floor. “He went this way!” Kahlan looked up the dark hall ahead. Itled to the stairwells and up into the palace. The other corridor that branchedoff to the right led under the palace in a labyrinth of storerooms, abandonedareas once used in the excavation of the bedrock the palace was built atop,access tunnels to inspect and maintain the foundation walls, and drainagetunnels for the springs the builders had encountered. At the ends of thedrainage tunnels, massive stone grates let the water out through the foundationwalls, but prevented anyone from getting in. “No,” Kahlan said. “This way-to theright.”“But the blood,” Nadine protested. “He went this way.”“We’ve seen no blood until this place. The blood is a diversion. That way leadsup into the palace. Jagang went this way, to the right, where there are nopeople.”Nadine followed after as Kahlan started down the corridor to the right. “But whywould he care if there are people? He killed and wounded all those soldiers backthere!”“And they managed to take off an arm. Now Marlin is wounded. Jagang won’t careif we kill Marlin, but, on the other hand, if he can escape, then he can useMarlin to cause more harm.”“What more harm could he cause than hurting people? Hurting all those peopleupstairs and the soldiers?”“The Wizard’s Keep,” Kahlan said. “Jagang doesn’t have command of magic, otherthan his ability as a dream walker, but he can use a person with the gift. Fromwhat I’ve seen so far, though, he doesn’t know much about using another’s magic.The things he did back there, simple use of air and heat, are far from inventivefor a wizard. Jagang only thinks to do the simplest of things with their magic,things of brute force. That is to our advantage.“If I were him, I would try to get to the Keep, and use the magic there to causethe most destruction I could.”Kahlan turned down an ancient stairwell carved from rock, taking the steps twoat a time. At the bottom, the rough, tunnel-like hall ran in two directions. Sheturned to the soldiers still racing down the stairs behind. “Split up-half eachway. This is the lowest level. When you encounter more junctures, cover themall. Remember which way you went at each turn, or you could be lost down herefor days.“You’ve seen what he can do. If you find him, don’t take a chance trying to takehim. Post sentries so we know if he backtracks, and then send runners to comeget me.”“How will we find you?” one asked.Kahlan looked to the right. “At every choice, I’ll take the one to the right, soyou can follow where I went. Now hurry. I think he’s headed for any opening outof the palace he can find. We can’t let him get out. If he gets to the Keep, hecan get through shields there that I can’t.”With Nadine and half the men, Kahlan rushed on through the dank hall. Theyencountered several rooms, all empty, and before long, several more corridors.At every branch, she divided the men and took her continually dwindling force tothe right.“What’s the Wizard’s Keep?” Nadine asked as they moved on through the darkness.“It’s a massive fortress, a stronghold, where wizards used to live. It predatesthe Confessors’ Palace.” Kahlan lifted a hand, indicating the palace above them.“ In ages long forgotten, nearly everyone was born with the gift. Over the lastthree thousand years the gift has been dying out in the race of man.”“What’s in the Keep?”“Living quarters, long abandoned, libraries, rooms of every sort. And things ofmagic are stored there. Books, weapons, things like that. Shields protectimportant or dangerous parts of the Keep. Those without magic can’t pass throughany of the shields. Since I was born with magic, I can pass through some ofthem, but not all.“The Keep is vast. It makes the Confessors’ Palace look like a cramped cottage,by comparison. In the great war, three thousand years ago, the Keep was filledwith wizards and their families. Richard says it was a place filled withlaughter and life. At that time, the wizards had both Subtractive and AdditiveMagic.”“And now they don’t?”“No. Only Richard has been born with both sides.“There are places in the Keep that I, and the wizards I grew up with, could notenter because the shields are so powerful. There are other places that have notbeen entered in thousands of years because they are shielded with both sides ofthe magic. No one could get past the shields. “But Richard can. I fear Marlincan, too.”“Sounds a dreadful place.”“I’ve spent a good portion of my life there, studying books of language, andlearning from the wizards. I never though, of it as anything but part of myhome.”“Where are these wizards now? Can’t they help us?”“They all killed themselves, at the end of last summer, in the war with DarkenRahl.”“Killed themselves! How awful. Why would they do that?” Kahlan was silent for amoment as they moved relentlessly onward into the darkness. It all seemed adream from another life.“We needed to find the First Wizard, to have him appoint the Seeker of Truth tostop Darken Rahl. Zedd was the First Wizard. He was in Westland, on the otherside of the boundary. The boundary was linked to the underworld, the world ofthe dead, so no one was able to cross it.“Darken Rahl was also hunting Zedd. It took all the wizards to conjure magic toget me through the boundary to go after Zedd. If Darken Rahl had captured thewizards, he might have used his vile magic to make them confess what they knew.“To give me the time to have a chance to succeed, the wizards killed themselves.Darken Rahl still managed to send assassins after me. That was when I metRichard. He protected me.”“Blunt Cliff?” Nadine said in questioning amazement. “There were four huge menfound dead at the bottom of the cliff. They had leather uniforms, and weapons ofevery sort. No one had ever seen men like them before.”“That was them.”“What happened?”Kahlan gave her a sidelong glance. “Something like you and your experience withTommy Lancaster.”“Richard did that? Richard killed these men?”Kahlan nodded. “Two of them. I took another with my power, and he killed thelast. Those were probably the first men Richard had ever encountered who wantedto do more to him than simply give him a beating when he chose to protectsomeone. To protect me. Richard has had to make a lot of hard choices since thatday on Blunt Cliff.”For what seemed hours, but she knew couldn’t be more than fifteen or twentyminutes, they continued on into the dark, stinking halls. The stone blocks werelarger, some so huge that single blocks ran from floor to ceiling. They wereroughly cut, but fit with no less precision than the other mortarless jointworkelsewhere in the palace.The halls were wetter, too, with water running down the walls in places,draining into small tiled weep holes at the edges of the floor that had a crownto direct the water to the drains. Some of the drains were plugged with debris,allowing shallow pools to form.Rats used the tiled drains as tunnels. They squeaked and scurried away at theapproach of light and sound, some taking to the drains, some running on ahead.Kahlan thought again of Cara, and wondered if she was still alive. It seemed toocruel that she should die before having a chance to taste life without themadness that shadowed her.A series of connecting tunnels finally reduced Kahlan’s company to Nadine andtwo men. The way was so narrow that they had to proceed single-file. The low,arched ceiling forced them to trot in a crouch.Kahlan saw no blood-Jagang probably used his control of Marlin’s mind to cut theflow-but in several places she did see that the slime on the wall was smeared inhorizontal streaks. As low and narrow as the passageway was, it would bedifficult to avoid grazing the close walls. Kahlan brushed against the wall morethan she wished to; it hurt her shoulder when the knuckles of her hand over thewound struck the slimy stone. Marlin-Jagang-had to have been through thepassageway and brushed against the same wall.She felt both a rush of heady relief that she was on his tail, and terror at theprospect of catching him.The arched passageway narrowed again, and the ceiling became even lower. Theyhad to hunch into a deep crouch to proceed. The flames from the torches foldedto lap at the stone close overhead, and the smoke billowed along the ceiling,burning their eyes.As the passageway started into a steep descent, they all slipped and fell morethan once. Nadine skinned her elbow as she fell on it while maintaining a gripon the torch. Kahlan slowed, but didn’t stop, as one of the soldiers helpedNadine regain her feet. The other three quickly caught up. Ahead, Kahlan heardthe rush of water.The narrow passageway opened into a large, tubular tunnel. Water rushed in atorrent down the round tunnel that was part of the drainage system below thepalace. Kahlan paused at the edge.“What now, Mother Confessor?” ore of the soldiers asked. “Stick to the plan.I’ll go with Nadine downstream, to the right. You two go upstream to the left.”“But if he’s trying to get out, he would have gone to the right,” the soldiersaid. “He would hope to get out where the water does. We should go with you.”“Unless he knows we’re after him, end he’s trying to send us the wrong way. Youtwo go left. Come on, Nadine.”“In there? The water must be waist-deep.”“A little more. I’d say. It’s run-off from the spring melt. It’s usually no morethan a foot or two deep. There are stepping stones along the other side, butthey’re just underwater now. In the center of where this passageway opens intothe drain tunnel there will be an oblong stone to step across on.”Kahlan stretched and stepped out, putting a foot into the center of the torrentand onto the flat stone just under the surface of the water. She lifted herother leg across the rushing water, testing until her foot found one of thestones against the far wall. She clasped a hand with Nadine and boosted herselfacross. Standing on the stone, the water was only ankle-deep, but it quicklysoaked through the lacing and filled her boots. It was ice cold.“See?” Kahlan’s voice echoed, and she hoped it didn’t carry far. “But becareful; it isn’t an unbroken walkway. The stones are spaced apart.”Kahlan moved to the next stepping stone and gave Nadine a hand across. Shegestured to the men to go up the tunnel. They crossed and moved quickly off intothe darkness. Soon, the light from the men’s torches vanished around a bend, andKahlan was left with Nadine in the dim light of a single torch. Kahlan hoped itwould last long enough. “Careful, now,” she said to Nadine.Nadine cupped her ear. It was hard to hear over the roar of the water. Kahlanput her mouth close and repeated the admonition. She didn’t want to yell, andalert Jagang, if he was close.Even if the torch had been brighter, they wouldn’t have been able to see far.The drainage tunnel twisted and turned on its way down and out of the palaceunderground. Kahlan had to put a hand to the cold, slimy stone wall in order tokeep her balance.In several places the tunnel took a steep descent, the stones along the sidefollowing it down like a stairway down through a roaring rapid. Icy water mistedthe air and soaked them to the skin.Even in the flatter sections, running was impossible, as they had to stepcarefully from stone to stone. If they went too fast and missed a step, theycould break an ankle. Down in the tunnel, in the water, with Jagang somewhereabout, would be a very bad place to be hurt. The blood running afresh downKahlan’s arm reminded her that she was already hurt. But at least she couldwalk.That was when Nadine squealed from behind and went into the water, “Don’t losethe torch!” Kahlan screamed. Nadine, chest-deep in the rushing water, thrust thetorch up in the air to keep it from being doused. Kahlan snatched her wrist andstrained against the drag of the water as the current swept Nadine past. Therewas nothing for Kahlan to grab hold of with her other hand. She hooked the heelsof her boots over the edge of the stepping stone to keep from being pulled off.Nadine thrashed with her other hand, searching for one of the stepping stones.She found one and grasped it. With Kahlan’s help, she pulled herself back up.“Dear spirits, that water is cold.”“I told you to be careful!”“Something, a rat, I think, grabbed my leg,” she said, trying to catch herbreath. “I’m sure it was dead. I’ve seen others float past. Now be careful.”Nadine nodded in embarrassment. I because she had been swept past Kahlan, Nadinewas now in the lead. Kahlan didn’t see how they could change places without astruggle, so she motioned Nadine on.Nadine turned to start out. Suddenly a huge shape erupted from the black depths.Water sluiced from Marlin as he bobbed up and snatched Nadine’s ankle with hisone hand. She shrieked as she was yanked feet-first into the inky water."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11On her way down, Nadine swung the torch and caught Marlin square across thebridge of his nose. He let go of her as he madly groped to wipe the burningpitch from his eyes. The current swept him away.Kahlan gripped Nadine’s arm, still holding the torch above the water, and helpedher back up on the stepping stone for a second time. They flattened themselvesagainst the wall, gulping air and shaking in shock. “Well,” Kahlan said at last,“at least we know which way he went.” Nadine was shivering violently from hersecond dunking. Her hair was plastered to her head and neck. “I can’t swim. NowI know why I never wanted to learn. I don’t like it.”Kahlan smiled to herself. The woman had more pluck than she would have thought.Her smile wilted when she remembered why Nadine was there, and who had sent her.Kahlan realized that in the surprise of the ambush she had missed her chance toget Jagang. “Let me go first.”Nadine held the torch up with both hands. Kahlan put her arms around Nadine’swaist as they twisted around on tiptoes to change places on the stone. The womanwas as cold as a fish in winter. Kahlan wasn’t much warmer from being in thefrigid tunnels with the icy water lapping around her ankles. Her toes were numb.“What if he swims upstream and escapes?” Nadine asked, her teeth chattering. “Idon’t think that likely, with only on? arm. He was probably holding a stone,keeping just his face above the surface as he lurked in the water, waiting forus.”“And what if he does it again?”“I’m in front now. It will be me he grabs hold of, and that will be the lastmistake he makes.”“And what if he waits until you pass, and pops up and grabs me again?”“Then hit him harder the next time.”“I hit him as hard as I could!”Kahlan smiled and gave Nadine a reassuring squeeze on her arm. “I know you did.You did the right thing. You did well “They inched along the wall, passing several more gentle turns, watching thewater the whole time for Marlin’s face peering up at them. Both started atthings they saw in the water, but it always turned out to be nothing more thanpieces of flotsam.The torch was sputtering more, and looked to be near its end. The drains all ledoutside, and they had travelled a goodly distance in this one. Kahlan knew thatthe tunnel must end soon. She realized the thought was more hope than knowledge;as a girl she had explored the tunnels and drains down here, though not whenthey had been so swollen with run-off, and although she had a good idea of whereshe was, she didn’t know their exact location. She remembered that some drainagetunnels seemed to go on forever.As they moved along, the sound of the roaring water seemed to change pitch.Kahlan wasn’t sure what that meant. Ahead, the tunnel bent to the right.A thump that she could feel in her chest more than hear made her stop. She heldout a hand, not only to halt Nadine, but’ to signal silence.The wet stone of the walls ahead brightened, glistening with a reflected bluishglow from something beyond the bend, A low howl rose in pitch until they couldhear it clearly over the rush of the water.A boiling ball of flame exploded from around the bend. Raging yellow and blueflame, filling the entire tunnel, tumbled as it raced toward them with a wail.Liquid fire seething with all-consuming menace. Wizard’s fire.Kahlan snatched Nadine by the hair. “Hold your breath!” Pulling Nadine with her,Kahlan dived into the water just ahead of the angry fury of roiling flame. Theicy water was such a shock that she almost gasped it in.Under the churning water, it was difficult to tell up from down. Kahlan openedher eyes. She saw the wavering glow of the inferno overhead. Nadine wasstruggling to get to the surface. Kahlan jammed her left hand against theunderside of a stepping stone to hold herself under, and with her good arm heldNadine under with her. Nadine, in the panic of drowning, fought to escape. Panicclawed at Kahlan, too.When everything went black, Kahlan her lungs burning for air, thrust her headabove the water, pulling Nadine up with her. Nadine choked and coughed as shegasped. Long sodden strands of hair covered both their faces. Another tumblingball of wizard’s fire raced up the tunnel. “Get a big breath!” Kahlan screamed.She sucked a deep breath herself and went under, dragging Nadine down with her.They went under without an instant to spare. Kahlan knew that, given a choice,Nadine would have chosen to die in the fire rather than drown, but the water wastheir only chance. Wizard’s fire burned with deadly determination, with theresolve of the wizard who conjured it.They couldn’t keep doing this. The water was so cold she was shiveringuncontrollably already. She knew that cold water, by itself, could kill aperson. They couldn’t stay in the water: it would end up killing them as sure asthe wizard’s fire.They couldn’t get to Jagang through Marlin’s wizard’s fire. If they were toreach him in time, there was only one way: they would have to go under the fire.Under the water.Kahlan repressed her panic at the thought of drowning, made sure she had a goodgrip around Nadine’s waist, and then pushed away from the stepping stone she hadbeen gripping for dear life. The wet wrath of water swept them away in itsfrigid flux. She could feel herself tumbling under the water as she scraped andbumped along the stone. When her shoulder hit on something, she almost screamed,but the thought of losing her breath instantly locked her throat shut eventighter.With frenzied need of air, and blackness disorienting her, she knew she had tocome up. She was holding Nadine in a death grip with her good arm. With herother hand, she managed to hook a stone. With Nadine’s weight in addition to herown, it felt as if the rush of water would rip her arm from its socket.When her head cleared the surface, there was light. Not twenty feet away was astone lattice. Late afternoon light poured in through the openings above thewater level.As Kahlan pulled Nadine’s head above the water, she clamped a hand over thewoman’s mouth.On one of the stepping stones to the side, near the stone grate, facing away,stood Marlin.Kahlan could see the broken shafts of least a half dozen arrows sticking fromhis back. By the way Marlin was staggering as he stepped to the next stone, sheknew he couldn’t live much longer.The stump of his left arm wasn’t bleeding. If only she could count on him dyingbefore he reached the Keep. Jagang was obviously driving the wounded manrelentlessly onward. She had no idea what Jagang was capable of, in controllingthe man’s mind, to keep him alive and moving. He had no concern for the life heoccupied, and she knew he would be willing to let Marlin suffer any damage toaccomplish Jagang’s wishes.Marlin lifted a hand, fingers spread, toward the stone grate. Kahlan had grownup around wizards; Marlin was conjuring air. A section of the lattice grateexploded outward in a cloud of dust and stone fragments. More light poured inthrough the blasted opening.The suddenly wider spillway let the water flood out with yet greater force.Kahlan’s injured arm had no strength, an I the mounting might of the dischargetore her away from the stone step. She lost her grip on Nadine.In the powerful clutch of the water, Kahlan grasped frantically for a handhold,but found none. She twisted and tumbled under the water, trying with her armsand legs to grapple something. She hadn’t had a chance to get a good breath, andshe struggled, too, to fight her terror at her exigent need for air.Her fingers caught the sharp stone at the edge of the blasted hole. The watersucked her under and jammed her hard against the lower part of the grate. Shecould only force her head and part of one shoulder above the surface. It seemedshe was breathing more water than air.Kahlan looked up. Jagang’s wicked smile greeted her. He was only a few feetaway.The force of the water ramming against her crushed her tight to the brokengrate. She didn’t have the muscle to overcome the pounding weight of the water.Try as she might, she couldn’t get to him. It was all she could do to get abreath.She glanced over her shoulder. What she saw took the breath for which she hadfought so hard. They were on the east side of the palace-the high side of thefoundation. The water roared out of the drainage gateway to plunge for a goodfifty feet before crashing to the rocks below.Jagang chuckled. “Well, well, darlin, how nice of you to drop by to witness myescape.”“Where are you going, Jagang?” she managed. “I thought I’d go up to the Keep.”Kahlan gasped for air and caught a mouthful of water instead. She coughed andchoked it out. “Why do you want to go to the Keep? What’s there that you want?”“Darlin, you’re deluding yourself if you think I would reveal anything I don’twant you to know.”“What did you do to Cara?”He smiled but didn’t answer. He lifted Marlin’s hand. A blast of air shatteredmore of the grate to the side.The stone she was holding gave way. Her back scraped over the broken edge.Kahlan snatched for a solid piece and just caught it with her fingers before shewas ejected from the drain. When she looked down, she was looking at the rocksbelow the foundation. Water thundered above her.She worked her fingers over the sharp stone, struggling desperately to pullherself back behind what was left of the grate. Panic powering her effort, sheregained the inside of the stone lattice, but she couldn’t get away from it. Thewater kept her pinned. “Problem, darlin?”Kahlan wanted to scream at him, but ;she could only gasp for air as she foughtto keep from being swept through the opening. Her arms burned with the effort.She could think of nothing to do to stop him. She thought of Richard.Jagang lifted Marlin’s hand again, spreading his fingers.Nadine popped up from the water right behind him. With one hand she held a stonestep. In her other, she still gripped the dead torch. Looking as if she was atthe ragged edge of madness, she took a mighty swing, clubbing him across theback of his knees.Marlin’s legs folded under him and he toppled into the water right in front ofKahlan. He caught himself on the broker grate with his one hand. When he sawwhat waited outside, he frantically tried to push himself back. Apparently, hehadn’t anticipated that there might be no way down from the drain tunnel. Nadineclutched a stepping stone and held on for dear life. Kahlan reached behind withher injured arm, stuffed her left hand through a grate opening under the water,and made a fist to lodge it fast. With her other hand, she seized Marlin by thethroat.“Well, well,” she said through gritted teeth. “Look what I have here: the greatand all-powerful Emperor Jagang.”He grinned, showing broken teeth. “Actually, darlin,” he said in Jagang’sgrating, impudent voice, “you have Marlin.”She pulled herself close to his face. “Think so? Do you know that a Confessor’smagic works faster than thought? That’s why once we’re touching someone, theyhave no chance. None. The magic bond of my loyalty to Richard Rahl denies adream walker access to my mind. Marlin’s mind is our field of battle now. Do yousuppose that my magic might work faster than yours? What do you think? Do youthink I can take you, along with Marlin?”“Two minds at once?” he said with a smirk. “I don’t think so, darlin.”“We’ll see. Maybe I’ll get you, too. Maybe we’ll end the war, and the ImperialOrder, right here and now.”“Oh, darlin, you are a fool. Man is destined to free his world from the shacklesof magic. Even if you could kill me here and now, which you can’t, you will notend the Order. It will survive any one man, even me, because it is the struggleof all mankind to inherit our world.”“Do you really expect me to believe that you don’t do this for yourself? Fornaked power?”“Not at all. I relish rule. But I simply ride a horse already in full charge. Itwill run you down. You are a fool who follows the dying religion of magic.”“A fool who has you by the throat-the great Jagang, who professes to want man totriumph over magic, yet uses magic!”“For now. But when magic dies, I will be the one with the daring, and themuscle, to rule-without magic.”Fury erupted through Kahlan. This was the man who had ordered the deaths ofthousands of innocent people. This was the butcher of Ebinissia. This was theman who would enslave the world. This was the man who wanted to kill Richard.In the silence of her mind, in the core of her power, where there was no cold,no exhaustion, no fear, she had all the time in the world. Though he made noattempt to escape, even if he had, it would have been hopeless. He was hers.Kahlan did as she had done countless times before-she released her restraint.For an imperceptible twitch of time, something was different. There wasresistance where there had been none before. A wall. Like hot steel throughglass, her power crashed through it. The magic exploded through Marlin’s mind.Thunder without sound.Stone chips fell from the ceiling at the concussion. Water droplets danced.Despite the water’s rush, a ring of ripples raced outward around the two ofthem, driving a wall of mist and dust.Nadine, clinging to the stepping stone, cried out in the pain of being so closeto a Confessor’s power unleashed.Marlin’s mouth went slack. Once a person’s mind had been destroyed by aConfessor, they became a vessel needing her command. Marlin offered no suchabdication.Blood streamed from his ears and nose. His head lolled to the side in therushing torrent. His dead eyes started.Kahlan released her grip of his throat when his hand went slack on the grate andthe water tore him away. Marlin’s body tumbled out through the broken stonelattice and plummeted to the rocks below.Kahlan knew: she had almost had Jagang, but she failed. His thoughts, hisability as a dream walker, had been too fast for her Confessor’s magic to catch.Nadine was reaching toward her. “Grab my hand! I can’t hold on forever!” Kahlanlocked wrists with her. Using her power drained a Confessor of strength. Afterusing her magic, it took even Kahlan, the Mother Confessor, and perhaps thestrongest Confessor ever born, several hours before she could use her poweragain, but longer than that to fully recover her strength. She was exhausted,and couldn’t fight the torrent any longer. Without Nadine’s hold on her, shewould have gone over the edge, too.With Nadine’s help, Kahlan managed to regain the stepping stones. Shivering withthe cold, they both dragged themselves up.Nadine wept at the crest of terror that had passed and had almost taken them.Kahlan was too exhausted to weep, but she knew how Nadine felt. “I wasn’ttouching him, when you used magic, but I thought every one of my joints hadpopped apart. It didn’t... do anything to me, did it? Anything magic? Am I goingto die, too?”“No, you’re fine,” Kahlan assured her. “You simply felt the pain because youwere too close, that’s all. If you had been touching him, though, it would havebeen inconceivably worse-you would have been destroyed.”Nadine nodded in mute reply. Kahlan put an arm around her and whispered a thankyou in her ear. Nadine smiled the tears away. “We have to get back to Cara.”Kahlan said. “We have to hurry.”“How? The torch is gone. There’s no way down the outside, and as soon as we tryto go back, it will be pitch black. I don’t want to go back there in the dark.It’s impossible until the soldiers come with torches to light our way.”“Nothing is impossible,” Kahlan said wearily. “We took every turn to the right,so we have only to put a hand on the left wall and follow it to find our wayback.”Nadine threw her hand out, pointing back into the blackness. “That may be allfine and good in the halls, but when we came into this drainage tunnel, wecrossed over to the other side. There aren’t steps on that side. We’ll neverfind the opening.”“The water rushing over the step stone in the center of the tunnel had adifferent sound. Didn’t you notice? I’ll remember it.” Kahlan took Nadine’s handto give her encouragement. “We have to try. Cara needs help.”Nadine stared in wordless worry for a moment, and then said, “All right, butwait a moment.”She tore a strip from the shredded hem of Kahlan’s dress and wound it aroundKahlan’s upper arm, closing the wound as best she could. Kahlan winced whenNadine drew the knot tight.“Let’s go,” Nadine said. “But be careful until I can sew it closed and put apoultice on it.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12They made excruciatingly slow process back up the drainage tunnel. The blindtrek, groping along the cold, slimy stone, with the water coursing about theirankles, and the constant fear of falling into the raging water in the darkness,was at least devoid of the terror that Marlin might pop up, grab their legs, andpull them in. When Kahlan heard the sound of the water change, and its echo intothe hall, she held Nadine’s hand and probed with a foot until she found the stepstone across the channel.Partway back through the dark labyrinth of tunnels and halls, the soldiers foundthem and led the way with torches. In a numb haze, Kahlan followed the waveringflames of the torches as they plunged ever onward into the black nothingness. Itwas an effort to put one foot in front of the other. Kahlan wished for nothingmore than to lie down, even if it were on the cold, wet stone.Outside the pit, the halls were crowded with hundreds of grim soldiers. Archersall had arrows nocked. Spears were at the ready, as were swords and axes. Otherweapons, from the fight with Marlin, were still embedded in the stone. Shedoubted that anything short of magic would remove them. The dead and wounded hadbeen cleared away, but blood boasted where they had lain. Screams were no longercoming from the pit.Kahlan recognized Captain Harris, who had been up in Petitioners’ Hall earlierin the day. “Has anyone gone down there to help her, captain?”“No, Mother Confessor. “He didn’t even have the decency to look sheepish about it. D’Harans fearedmagic, and felt no loss of pride admitting it. Lord Rahl was the magic againstmagic; they were the steel against steel. It was as simple as that.Kahlan couldn’t bring herself to reprimand the men in the hall for leaving Caraalone. They had shown their bravery in the fight with Marlin. Many of them hadbeen killed or seriously injured. Going down into the pit was different fromfighting something that came out; defending their selves was different, in theirminds, from going out and looking for trouble with magic.For their part of the bargain, the steel against steel, D’Haran soldiers foughtto the death. They expected their Lord Rahl to do his part, and his part wasdealing with magic.Kahlan read the apprehension in all the waiting eyes. “The assassin, the man whoescaped the pit, is dead. It’s over.”Soft sighs of relief could be heard up and down the hall, but by the anxiousexpression still on the captain’s face, she knew she must look quite a mess. “Ithink we should get you some help. Mother Confessor.”“Later.” Kahlan started for the ladder. Nadine followed. “How long has she beensilent, captain?”“Maybe an hour.”“That was about when Marlin died. Come with us, and bring a couple more men sowe can get Cara out of there.”Cara was on the far side of the room, near the wall where Kahlan had seen herlast. Kahlan knelt on one side, Nadine or the other, as the soldiers heldtorches so they could see.Cara was in convulsions of some sort. Her eyes were closed, and she was nolonger screaming, but she shook violently, her arms and legs thrashing againstthe stone floor.She was choking on her own vomit.Kahlan gripped the shoulder of Cara’s red leather and yanked her onto her side.“Open her mouth!”Nadine leaned over from behind and pushed her thumb against the back of Cara’sjaw, forcing it forward. With her other hand, she pressed down on her chin,keeping her mouth open. Kahlan swept two fingers through Cara’s mouth severaltimes until she had cleared her airway.“Breathe!” Kahlan yelled. “Breathe, Cara, breathe!”Nadine slapped the prone woman on the back, eliciting gurgling, wet, chokingcoughs that finally brought a semblance of clear, if gasping. breathing.Although she was able to breathe, it didn’t halt the convulsions. Kahlan felthelpless.“I better go get my things,” Nadine said. “What’s wrong with her?”“I don’t really know. A paroxysm of some sort. I’m no expert, but I think weneed to stop it. I might be able to help. I might have something in my bag.”“You two, go show her the way. Leave a torch.”Nadine and the two soldiers raced up the ladder after one of them shoved a torchin a bracket on the wall.“Mother Confessor,” Captain Harris said, “just a little while ago a Raug’Mossshowed up in Petitioners’ Hall.”“A what?”“A Raug’Moss. From D’Hara.”“I don’t know much about D’Hara. Who are they?”“They’re a secret sect. I don’t know much about them myself. The Raug’Moss keepto themselves, and are rarely seen-”“Get to the point. What’s he doing here?”“This one is the Raug’Moss High Priest himself. The Raug’Moss are healers. Hesays he sensed that a new Lord Rahl had become Master of D’Hara, and he came tooffer his services to his new master.”“A healer? Well, don’t just stand there-go get him. Maybe he can help. Hurry.”Captain Harris clapped a fist to his hear) before racing up the ladder. Kahlanpulled Cara’s shoulders and head into her lap and held her tight, trying to calmher convulsions. Kahlan didn’t know what else to do. She knew a lot abouthurting people, but little about healing them. She was so sick of hurtingpeople. She wished she knew more about helping people. Like Nadine.“Hold on, Cara,” she whispered as she rocked the shaking woman. “Help is coming.Hold on.”Kahlan’s eyes were drawn to the top of the opposite wall. The words incised inthe stone stared back. She knew nearly every language in the Midlands, allConfessors did, but she knew nothing about High D’Haran. High D’Haran was a deadlanguage; few people knew the ancient tongue.Richard was learning High D’Haran He and Berdine worked together translating thejournal they had found in the Keep -Kolo’s journal, they called it-which hadbeen written in High D’Haran, in the great war three thousand years before.Richard would be able to translate the prophecy on the wall.She wished he couldn’t. She didn’t want to know what it said. Prophecy was neveranything but trouble.She didn’t want to believe that Jagang had unleashed some unknown festeringplague of torment on them, but she couldn’t find a good reason to doubt hisword.She pressed her cheek to the top of Cara’s head and closed her eyes. She didn’twant to see the prophecy. She wanted it gone.Kahlan felt tears running down her face. She didn’t want Cara to die. She didn’tknow why she should feel so much for his woman, except perhaps because no oneelse did. The soldiers wouldn’t even come down to see why she had stoppedscreaming. She could have choked to death on her own vomit. Something as simpleas that, not magic, could have killed her because they were afraid, or perhapsbecause no one cared if she died.“Hold on, Cara. I care.” She smoothed the Mord-Sith’s hair back from her clammyforehead. “I care. We want you to live.”Kahlan squeezed the quaking women, as if trying to squeeze her words, herconcern, into her. It occurred to her that Cara wasn’t so different fromherself; Cara was trained to hurt people.When it all came down to it, Kahlan was much the same. She used her power todestroy a person’s mind. She knew that she was doing it to save others, but itwas still hurting people. Mord-Sith hurt people, but to them, it was to helptheir master, to preserve his life, and that in turn was to save the lives ofthe D’Haran people.Dear spirits, was she no more than this Mord-Sith she was trying to bring backfrom madness?Kahlan could feel the Agiel hanging around her neck pressing against her chestas she held Cara. Was she a sister of the Agiel in more ways than one?If Nadine had been killed in the beginning, would she have cared? Nadine helpedpeople; she didn’t make a life of hurting them. No wonder Richard had beenattracted to her.She wiped her cheek as the tears ran more freely.Her shoulder throbbed. She hurt all over. She wanted Richard to hold her. Sheknew he was going to be angry, but she needed him so badly at that moment. Itwas hurting her shoulder to hold the trembling woman in her lap, but she refusedto let go. “Hold on, Cara You’re not alone; I’m With you. I won’t leave you. Ipromise.”“Is she any better?” Nadine asked, as she scurried down the ladder. “No. She’sstill unconscious and sharing like before.”As she knelt, Nadine let her bag drop to the floor beside Kahlan. Things insidebanged together with muffled sounds.“I told those men to wait up there. We don’t want to move her until we can bringher out of it, and they’ll just be in the way.”Nadine started pulling things out of her bag, little folded cloth packages,leather pouches with markings scratched on them, and stoppered horn containers,likewise scratched with symbols. She briefly inspected the markings beforesetting each item aside.“Blue cohosh,” she mumbled to herself as she squinted at the cryptic marks onone of the leather pouches. “No, I don’t think it would do, and she’d have todrink cups of it.” She took out several more leather pouches, before pausing atanother. “Pearly everlasting. Might work, but we’d have to get her to smoke it,somehow.” She sighed irritably. “That won’t do.” She considered a horn.“Mugwort,” she muttered as she set it aside. “Feverfew”?” She put that horn inthe damp sling of her dress in her lap. “Yes, betony might be of some good,too,” she said as she considered another. She added the horn lo her lap.Kahlan picked up one of the horns Nadine had set aside and pulled its cork. Thepungent smell of anise made her pull back. She pushed the cork back in and setit down.She picked up another. Two circles were deeply scratched into the patina of thehorn. A horizontal line ran through both circles. Kahlan wiggled the carefullycarved wooden stopper, trying to pull it free. Nadine slapped the horn out ofKahlan’s hands. “Don’t!” Kahlan looked up in surprise. “Sorry. I didn’t mean tosnoop in your things. I was-”“No, it’s not that.” She picked up the horn with the two circles struck throughwith a line and held it up. “This is powdered canin pepper. If you aren’tcareful when you open it, you could get it on your hands, or worse, in yourface. It’s a powerful substance that will immobilize a person for a time. If youhad opened it carelessly, you would have been on the floor, blind and gaspingfor air, convinced you were about to die.“I thought about using it on Cara, to stop her shaking by paralyzing her, but Idecided it best not to. It immobilizes a person partly by interfering with theirbreathing. It feels like it’s burning your eyes out of your head; it blinds you.Your nose feels on fire, you’re sure your heart is going to burst, and you can’tget your breath. You’re helpless. Trying to wash it off only makes it worse,because the powder is oily and just spreads.“It doesn’t cause any real harm, and you’d recover completely in a short time,but until then, you’re disabled and totally helpless. I don’t think immobilizingCara in that fashion would be good, since she’s already having troublebreathing. In her state, it might make her worse, instead of helping her.”“Do you know what to do, to help her? You do know what to do, don’t you?” Kahlanasked, trying not to sound critical.Nadine’s hand paused on the edge of her bag. “Well, I... I think I do. It’s notso common a problem that I’m sure, but I’ve? heard of it. My father hasmentioned it in passing.”Kahlan wasn’t reassured. Nadine found a small bottle in her bag and held it upin the torchlight. She pulled the cork and turned the bottle upside down on afinger. “Hold her head up.”“What is it?” Kahlan asked as she turned Cara over. She watched Nadine rub thesubstance on Cara’s temples. “Oil of lavender. It helps with headaches.”“I think she has more than a simple headache.”“I know, but until I find something else, it might help ease the pain, and thatmight help calm her. I don’t think I have any one thing that by itself will doit. I’ll need to try to add things together.“The problem is that with the convulsions we can’t get her to drink decoctionsor teas. Motherwort and linden help calm people, but we can’t get her to drink awhole cup of it in water. Black horehound would help stop the vomiting, butshe’d have to drink five cups a day. I don’t see how we can get her to drink thefirst until we stop the convulsions. Maybe we could get her to swallow somefeverfew. But there is one thing I’m hoping...”Nadine’s long, damp hair hung around her face as she pawed through her bag. Shecame up with another small, brown bottle. “Yes! I did bring it.”“What is it?”“Tincture of maypop. It’s a strong sedative and also a painkiller. I’ve heard mypa say that it settles people who are in a state of nervous shakes. I think hemay have meant shakes like convulsions. Since it’s a tincture, we can put someon the back of her tongue; she’ll swallow it, that way.”Cara shuddered violently in Kahlan’s arms. Kahlan embraced her tighter until shesettled a bit. She didn’t know if she liked the idea of having to rely onNadine’s “I think,” but Kahlan had no better solution. Something had to be done.Nadine was working her thumbnail at the wax seal on the little brown bottle oftincture of maypop when the shaft of light coming from the doorway abovedarkened. Nadine’s hands stilled.A motionless, silhouetted figure filled the doorway, seeming to consider them atlength. With nary a flutter of his long cloak, he wheeled and started down theladder. In the silence, but for the hissing torch, Kahlan absently stroked aprotective hand over Cara’s brow as she watched the man in a hooded cloakdescend the ladder."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13Nadine paused at her work on the wax seal. “Who... ?”“He’s some kind of healer,” Kahlan whispered as she watched the man’s methodicaldescent. “From D’Hara. I was told he came to offer his services to Richard. Ithink he’s an important person.”Nadine grunted dismissively. “What’s he going to do without any herbs orthings?” She leaned closer while watching him. “He doesn’t seem to have anythingwith him.”Kahlan shushed her. Stone dust crunched under his boots as he turned, the soundechoing in the hush of the pit. He approached in measured strides. The torch wason the wall behind him, so Kahlan couldn’t see his features in the deeply cowledhood of the voluminous, coarse flaxen cloak that hung to the floor. He was astall as Richard, with shoulders just as wide.“Mord-Sith,” he observed in a voice hat was smooth and authoritative, some thinglike Richard’s, too.He brought a hand out of his cloak and gestured. Kahlan complied, laying Cara onher back on the stone floor. With the way he seemed to study Cara’s shivering,Kahlan didn’t want to interrupt for introductions. She just wanted someone tohelp Cara.“What happened to her?” he asked from the shadow of the cowl, in a voice just asdeep and dark. “She had control of a man who-”“He had the gift? She was linked with him?”“Yes,” Kahlan said. “That’s what she called it.” He made a sound in his throat,as if mentally assimilating the information. “It turned out that the man waspossessed by a dream walker and-”“What’s a dream walker?”“A person, as I understand it, who can invade another person’s mind by slippinginto the spaces between their thoughts. He gains control of them in this way. Hewas covertly possessing this man that she linked with.” He considered a moment.“I see. Go on.”“We came down here to question the man-”“To torture him.”Kahlan pulled an irritated breath. “No. I told Cara that we were simply going toquestion him to get answers, if we could. The man was an assassin sent to killLord Rahl, and if he didn’t answer the questions, then Cara was prepared to dowhat she must to get those answers-to protect Lord Rahl. “But it never got thatfar. We discovered that this dream walker had control of him, control of hisgift. The dream walker used the man’s gift to write a prophecy in the stonebehind you.” The healer didn’t turn to look. “Then what?”“Then he was going to escape and start killing people. Cara tried to stop him-”“With her link?”“Yes. She let out a scream like I’ve never heard before and fell to the groundholding her ears.” Kahlan inclined her head. “Nadine here, and I, went after theman when he tried to escape. Fortunately, he was killed. When we got back, wefound Cara on the floor, in convulsions.”“You shouldn’t have left her alone. She could have choked to death on her ownvomit.”Kahlan pressed her lips together and remained silent. The man just stood there,watching Cara shudder.Finally, Kahlan could bear it no longer. “This is one of Lord Rahl’s personalguards. She’s important. Do you intend to help her, or you just going to standthere?”“Quiet,” he commanded in a distracted tone. “One must observe before one acts,or more harm than help can be the result.”Kahlan glowered at the shadowed form. At last he sank to his knees and sat backon his heels. He lifted Cara’s wrist in one of his big hands, working a fingerbetween her glove and sleeve. He flicked his other hand out over the items onthe floor. “What’s all this?”“They’re my things,” Nadine said. Her chin rose. “I’m a healer.” Still holdingCara’s wrist, the man picked up a leather pouch with his other hand, looking atits markings He set it down and then scooped the two horns from Nadine’s lap.“Feverfew,” he said as he tossed it back in Nadine’s lap. He looked at thesymbols on the other. “Betony.” He tossed it back in her lap with the first.“You’re not a healer.” he said. “You re an herb woman.”“How dare you-”“Did you give her any of your medicines, besides the oil of lavender?”“How did... I’ve not had time to give her anything else.”“Good,” he proclaimed. “The oil of lavender won’t help her, but at least itwon’t harm her.”“Well, of course I know it’s not going to stop the convulsions. It was just tohelp ease some of her pain. I was going to give her tincture of maypop forthat.”“Were you now? Fortunate that I arrived in time, then.” Nadine folded her armsacross her breasts. “Why’s that?”“Because tincture of maypop would likely have killed her.” Nadine scowled as sheunfolded her arms and planted fists on her hips. “Maypop is a powerful sedative.It would likely have halted her convulsions. If you hadn’t interfered, I’d haveher recovered by now.”“Is that so? Did you feel her pulse?”“No.” Nadine paused warily. “Why? What difference could that possibly make?”“Her pulse is weak, staggering, and labored. This woman is struggling with allher strength to keep her heart beating. Had you given her your maypop, it wouldhave done as you said: sedated her. Her heart would have stopped.”“I... I can’t see how...”“Even a simple herb woman should know to use more caution when dealing withmagic.”“Magic.” Nadine wilted. “I’m from Westland. I’ve never seen magic before. Ididn’t know magic had any effect on healing herbs. I’m sorry.”He ignored the apology and pointed. “Undo the buttons and open the top of heroutfit.”“Why?” Nadine asked.“Do it! Or do you favor watching her die? She can’t hold on much longer.” Nadineleaned forward and began undoing the row of little red leather buttons along theside of Cara’s ribs. When she finished, he gestured for her to open it. Nadineglanced up at Kahlan. Kahlan gave her a nod, and she pulled back the suppleleather, exposing Cara’s chest. “May I ask your name?” Kahlan asked him.“Drefan.” Instead of asking hers, he put an ear to the center of Cara’s chest,listening.He shifted around, forcing Kahlan to scoot out of the way, until he was atCara’s head. He briefly inspected the bloody wound above her left ear, and then,seeming to dismiss it as unimportant, went on to systematically probe the baseof her neck.Kahlan could only see the side of his deep cowl, and nothing of his face. Thesingle torch didn’t provide much light, anyway. Drefan leaned forward andgripped Cara’s breasts in his big hands. Kahlan sat up straighter. “What do youthink you’re doing?”“Examining her.”“Is that what you call it.” He sat back on his heels. “Feel her breasts.”“Why?”“To see what I discovered.”Kahlan finally turned from the shadow of his cowl and, rather than grabbing heras he had, put the back of her fingers against the side of Cara’s left breast.It was hot-burning with a fever. She felt the other. It was ice cold. WhenDrefan gestured, Nadine followed suit. “What does it mean?” she asked. “I’d liketo reserve judgment until I’ve finished examining her, but it’s not good.”He put his fingers to the side of her neck, feeling her pulse again. He ran histhumbs outward along her forehead. He tent and put his ear to each of hers. Hesmelled her breath. He carefully lifted her head and rotated it. He spread herarms out to the sides, pulled the red leather outfit open further so that Cara’storso was naked to her waist, and then bent over her and palpated her abdomenand up under her ribs.With his head bent as if in concentration, he touched his fingers to the frontof her shoulders for a moment, the sides of her neck, the base of her skull, hertemples, several places on her ribs, and lastly to the palms of her hands.Kahlan was getting impatient. She was seeing a lot of probing and prodding, butvery little healing. “Well?”“Her aura is seriously snarled,” he said, as he brazenly thrust a big hand underthe red leather at Cara’s waist.Kahlan watched in stunned disbelief as his hand slid down to her crotch. Shecould see his fingers under the tight leather as he worked them into her sex.Hard as she could, Kahlan fisted him on the nerve at the side of his upper arm.He recoiled in pain. He fell to the side of his hip with a groan, covering hisarm where she had clouted him.“I told you, this is an important woman! How dare you grope her like that! Iwon’t have it, do you understand?”“I wasn’t groping her,” he growled.The heat was still in Kahlan’s voice “Then what do you call it?”“I was trying to determine what this dream walker has done to her. He’s greatlydisturbed her auras, her energy flows, confusing her mind’s control of her body.“She’s not in convulsions, precisely. She’s having uncontrolled muscularcontractions. I was checking to make sure that he hadn’t triggered the part ofher brain that controls excitement. I was making sure that he hadn’t put her ina state of continual orgasm. I have to know the extent of the blocks andtriggers he’s disturbed so that I know how to reverse it.”Nadine, eyes widening, leaned forward. “Magic can do such a thing? Make a personhave... continual...”He nodded as he flexed his sore arm. “If the practitioner knows what he’sdoing.”“Can you do such a thing?” she breathed.“No. I don’t have the gift, or any other form of magic, but I know how to heal-if the damage isn’t too great.” The cowl turned toward Kahlan. “Now, do you wishme to continue, or do you want to watch her die?”“Continue. But if you put your hand down there again, you are going to be aone-handed healer.”“I’ve already learned what I needed to know.” Nadine leaned in again. “Is she...?”“No.” He flicked his hand irritably. “Pull off her boots.” Nadine shuffledaround and did as he had ordered. He turned a bit toward Kahlan, as if peeringat her from the depths of his cowl. “Did you know to hit that particular nervein my arm with deliberate knowledge, or did you simply get lucky?”Kahlan studied the shadow, trying to see his eyes. She couldn’t. “I was trainedto do such things: to defend myself, and others.”“I’m impressed. With such understanding of nerves, you could learn to healinstead of hurt.” He turned his attention to Nadine. “Depress the third anterioraxis of the dorsin meridian.” Nadine made a face. “What?”He waggled his hand, pointing. “Between the tendon at the back of her ankles andthe prominent bone sticking out to the sides. Squeeze there with a thumb and onefinger. Both ankles.”Nadine did as she was told while Drefan pressed behind Cara’s ears with hislittle fingers and at the same time on the tops of her shoulders with histhumbs. “Harder, woman.” He put both palms, one hand atop the other, on Cara’ssternum. “Second meridian,” he murmured. “What?”“Move down half an inch and do it again. Both ankles.” He moved his fingers onCara’s skull, concentrating on what he was doing. “All right. First meridian.”“Another half inch down?” Nadine asked. “Yes, yes, hurry.”He held Cara’s elbows between a thumb and finger as he lifted them a few inches.Finally, he sat back on his heels with a sigh. “This is astounding,” he mutteredto himself. “This is not good.”“What is it?” Kahlan asked “Are you saying that you can’t help her?” He waveddismissively, as if too distracted to answer. “Answer me,” Kahlan insisted. “IfI wish you to bother me, woman, I will ask.” Nadine leaned forward, cocking herhead. “Do you have any idea who you’re talking to?” She pointed with her chin,indicating Kahlan.He was feeling Cara’s earlobes. “By the looks of her. I’d say some mucker on thecleaning staff. One in need of a bath,”“I’ve just had a bath,” Kahlan said under her breath.Nadine’s voice lowered with import. “You’d better show some respect. MisterHealer. She’s the one who owns this palace. The whole thing. She’s the MotherConfessor herself.”He ran a finger down the inside of Cara’s upper arms. “Is that so? Well, goodfor her. Now, be quiet, the both of you.”“She’s also the betrothed of Lord Richard Rahl himself.” Drefan’s hands froze.His whole body stiffened.“And since Lord Richard Rahl is the Master of D’Hara, and you’re from D’Hara,”Nadine went on, “I reckon that makes him the boss of you. If I were you, I’d beshowing a lot more respect for Lord Richard Rahl’s future wife. He doesn’t likeit when people don’t show respect for women. I’ve seen him knock out people’steeth for being disrespectful.” Drefan hadn’t moved a muscle.Kahlan thought Nadine had put it very crudely, but she doubted it could havebeen any more effective.“Not only that,” Nadine added, “but she’s the one who killed the assassin. Withmagic.”Drefan finally cleared his throat. “Forgive me, mistress-”“Mother Confessor,” Kahlan corrected.“I most humbly beg your forgiveness... Mother Confessor. I had no idea. I had nointention to cause-”Kahlan cut him off. “I understand. You were more concerned with healing Cara,here, than with formalities. So am I. Can you help her?”“I can.”“Please, get on with it then.”He immediately turned back to Cara. Kahlan frowned as she watched his handsgliding in patterns over the supine woman, keeping just above her flesh. Hishands paused occasionally, fingers trembling with effort at an invisible task.From Cara’s feet, Nadine folded her arms again. “You call this healing? My herbswould have had a better effect than this piffle, and a lot sooner, too.”He looked up. “Piffle? Is that what you think this is? Just some nonsense? Doyou have the slightest idea, young lady, what we’re dealing with?”“A paroxysm. It must be ended, not prayed over.”He rose up on his knees. “I am the Raug’Moss High Priest. I am not given topraying for my healings.” Nadine snorted derisively. He nodded, as if decidingsomething. “You wish to see what we’re dealing with? You want proof your simpleherb woman eyes can understand?”Nadine scowled. “In view of the lack of results, a little proof would be a finedish.”He pointed. “I saw a horn of mugwort. Give it here. I presume you have a taperin that bag; bring it, too, after you light it.”As Nadine took the candle to the torch to light it, Drefan opened his cloak andtook several items from a pouch. Nadine handed him the lit candle. He drippedhot wax on the floor to the side and stuck the taper in it.Drefan reached under his cloak arid pulled out a long, thin-bladed knife. Heleaned over and pressed it between Cara’s breasts. A ruby drop grew under thepoint. He set the knife aside and leaned over her. With a long-handled spoon, heskimmed the blood from her flesh.He sat back, unstopped the horn Nadine had given him, and dumped some mugwortatop the blood in the spoon. “You call this mugwort! You’re only supposed tocollect the fluffy underside of the leaf. You’ve got the whole leaf mixed inwith it.”“It doesn’t matter. It’s all mugwort ““A very low grade, this way. You ought to know to use a high-grade mugwort. Whatsort of herb woman are you, anyway?”Nadine squinted in indignation. “It works just fine. Are you trying to find anexcuse to get out of showing us that you know what you’re doing? Are you tryingto blame your failure on the grade of mugwort?”“The grade is more than good enough for my purpose, but not for yours.” His toneturned instructional, if not polite. “Next time, purify the sample you collect,and you will find it to be of more help to those who need it.”He hunched over, holding the spoor to the point of the candle flame until themugwort ignited, giving off a copious amount of smoke and a heavy, musky odor.Drefan circled the smoking spoon over Cara’s stomach, letting the layer of smokebuild.He handed the spoon of smoking mugwort to Nadine. “Hold this between her feet.”He put his fingers to his temples as he murmured a chant under his breath. Hetook his hands from his head. “Now, watch, and you will see what I can see, whatI can feel, without the smoke.”He put his thumbs to Cara’s temples and his little fingers to the sides of herthroat.The thick layer of mugwort smoke jumped.Kahlan gasped as she saw ropy lines of smoke coiling and snaking all over Cara.Drefan removed his hands and the smoke trails snapped into a still web of lines.Some arched from her sternum to her breasts, her shoulders, her hips, and herthighs. A tangle of lines went from the top half of her head to points all overher body.Drefan traced one with a finger. “See this one? From her left temple to her leftleg? Watch.” He pressed his fingers to the base of her skull on the left side,and the line of smoke crossed to her right leg. “There. That’s where itbelongs.”“What is all that?” Kahlan asked in astonishment.“Her meridian lines: the flow of her force, her life. Her aura. It’s more thanthat, too, but it’s hard to put it all into a few words for you. What I havedone is nothing more than the way a shaft of sunlight shows you the dust motesfloating in the air.”Nadine, her mouth hanging open, sat frozen, holding the smoking spoon. “How didyou make the line move?”“By using my life force to compel a healing energy shift where it was needed.”“Then you have magic,” Nadine breathed. “No, training. Squeeze her ankles, whereyou did the first time.” Nadine set the spoon down and squeezed Cara’s ankles.The tangle of lines going down Cara’s legs twisted and untangled, moving fromher hips to her feet in straight lines.“There,” Drefan said. “You have just corrected her legs. See how they’vestilled?”“I did that?” Nadine asked incredulously.“Yes. But that was the easy part. See here?” He indicated the web of linescoming from her head. “This is the dangerous part of what this dream walker did.It has to be undone. These lines indicate that she can’t control her muscles.She can’t speak, and she’s been blinded. Look here. This line going from herears outward and then back to her forehead? That’s the only one that’s correct.She can hear and understand everything we say; she just can’t react to it.”Kahlan’s jaw dropped. “She can hear us?”“Every word. Rest assured, she knows, we’re trying to help her. Now, if youplease, I need to concentrate. This all has to be done in the correct order orwe’ll lose her.”Kahlan whisked her hands toward him. “Of course. Do what you need to do to helpher.”Drefan hunched to his task, working his way around Cara’s body, pressing fingersor the flats of his hands to various places on her. At times he used the knifepoint. He never drew more than a drop of blood is he pressed it into her flesh.At nearly each thing he did, some of the ropy lines of smoke moved, untangling,some laying down against Cara’s body and others curving outward in a smooth archbefore returning to a spot he had attended.When he compressed the flesh between her thumb and first finger, not only didthe smoke lines over her arms straighten, but Cara moaned in relief as shetwisted her head and rolled her shoulders. It was the first normal response ofany kind Cara had given. When he pierced the tops of her ankles with his knife,she gasped and began to breathe with a steady, if rapid, rhythm. Relief and hopeflooded through Kahlan.He at last had moved all the way around her, and was working at her head,pressing his thumbs along the bridge of her nose and across her forehead. Herwhole body was still, no longer shaking and quivering. Her chest rose and fellwithout effort.He pressed the knife point between her eyebrows. “That should take care of it,”he murmured to himself.Cara’s blue eyes opened. They searched about until they found Kahlan. “I heardyour words,” she whispered. “Thank you, my sister.”Kahlan smiled her relief. She knew what Cara meant. Cara had, after all, heardKahlan tell her that she wasn’t alone. “I got Marlin.”Cara smiled. “You make me proud to serve with you. I regret that you have goneto all this effort healing me for nothing.”Kahlan frowned, not knowing what she meant. Cara rolled her head back, lookingup at Drefan as he hunched over her. “How do you feel?” he asked. “Is everythingfeeling normal now?”Her brow drew together with a look of foggy confusion bordering on alarm. “LordRahl?” she asked incredulously. “No, I’m Drefan.”With both hands, he laid back his cowl. Kahlan’s eyes went wide, along withNadine’s.“But my father, too, was Darken Rahl. I am Lord Rahl’s half brother.” Kahlanstared in wonder. Same size, same muscular build as Richard. Blond hair, likeDarken Rahl’s, although shorter and not so straight. Richard’s hair was darker,and coarser. Drefan’s eyes, piercing blue like Darken Rahl’s, rather than greylike Richard’s, nonetheless bore the same cutting, raptor rake. His featurespossessed that impossibly handsome perfection of a statue that Darken Rahl’shad; Richard hadn’t inherited that cruel perfection. Drefan’s looks, somewherein the middle, leaned more toward Darken Rahl than Richard.But while no one would mistake Drefan for Richard, they would have no troubletelling that they were brothers.She wondered why Cara had made that mistake. Then she saw the Agiel in Cara’sfist. That wasn’t what Cara had meant by “Lord Rahl.” In a confused state,looking at him upside down as she regained consciousness, she hadn’t thought hewas Richard. She had thought he was Darken Rail."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14The only sound in the otherwise dead silence was the click, click, click ofRichard’s thumbnail on one of the points of the recurved cross guard on hissword The elbow of his other arm rested on the polished tabletop while hecradled his head between a thumb under his chin and his first finger along histemple With a calm face, he did his best to control his anger He was furiousThis time, they had crossed the line, and they knew it. In his mind he had goneover a whole list of possible punishments, but had rejected them all, notbecause they were too harsh, but because he knew they wouldn’t work In the end,he settled on the truth. There was nothing harsher than the truth, and nothingelse as likely to get through to them.Before him, in a row, stood Berdine, Raina, Ulic, and Egan They stood stiffly,their eyes focused at some point over his head and behind him as he sat at thetable in the small room he used for meeting with people, reading, and variousother work.To the side of the table hung small landscape paintings of idyllic countryscenes, but from the window behind, from which streamed the low angled rays ofmorning sunlight, the massive, baleful stone face of the Wizard’s Keep glareddown on him.He had been back in Aydindril for only an hour-long enough to discover what hadhappened after he had left the evening before All four of his guards had beenback since before dawn, he had ordered them to return to Aydindril after Rainaand Egan had sauntered into camp the night before They had thought he wouldn’tmake them return in the dead of night They had been wrong. As brazen as theyordinarily were, the look in his eyes had insured that none of the four dareddisobey that order.Richard had also returned much earlier than he had planned He had pointed outthe quench oak to the soldiers, told them what to collect, and then, instead ofoverseeing the task, had started back alone for Aydindril before the sun was upAfter what he had seen in the night, he’d been too troubled to get any sleep,and had wanted to be back in Aydindril as soon as possible.Drumming his finger on the tabletop, Richard watched his guards sweating Berdineand Raina wore their brown leather outfits, their long, braided hair dishevelledfrom their hard ride.The two great, blond-headed men, Ulic and Egan, wore uniforms of dark leatherstraps, plates, and belts The thick leather plates were molded to fit like asecond skin over the conspicuous contours of their muscles Incised in theleather at the center of their chests was an ornate letter “R,” for the House ofRahl, and beneath that, two crossed swords Around their arms, just above theirelbows, they wore golden bands brandishing razor-sharp projections-weapons forclose combat. No D’Haran but the Lord Rahl’s persona bodyguards wore suchweapons They were more than simply weapons, they were the rarest, the highestbadges of honor, earned he knew not how.Richard had inherited the rule of a people he didn’t know, with customs thatwere mostly a mystery to him, and expectations he only partly fathomed.Since they had returned, these four, too, had discovered what had happened withMarlin the night before. They knew why they had been summoned, but he hadn’tsaid anything to them, yet. He was trying to get a grip on his rage, first.“Lord Rahl?”“Yes, Raina?”“Are you angry with us? For disobeying your orders and coming out to you withthe Mother Confessor’s message?”The message had been a pretense, and they knew it as well as he. Click, click,click, went his thumbnail. “That will be all. You may go. All of you.”Their postures relaxed, but none made a move to leave. “Leave?” Raina asked.“Aren’t you going to punish us?” A smirk spread on her face. “Maybe clean outthe stables for a week, or something?”Richard pushed back from the table as he ground his teeth. He was not in themood for their impish humor. He rose behind the table. “No, Raina, nopunishment. You may go.”The two Mord-Sith smiled. Berdine loaned toward Raina, speaking in a whisper,but loud enough for him to hear. “He realizes that we know best how to protecthim.” They all started for the door.“Before you go,” Richard said, as he strolled around the table, “I just want youto know one thing.”“What’s that?” Berdine asked.Richard walked past them, pausing long enough to look each in the eye. “That I’mdisappointed in you.”Raina made a face. “You’re disappointed in us? You’re not going to yell orpunish us, you’re simply disappointed?”“That’s right. You’ve disappointed me. I thought I could trust you. I can’t.”Richard turned away. “Dismissed.”Berdine cleared her throat. “Lord Rahl, Ulic and I went with you by yourcommand.”“Oh? So if it had been you I’d left here to protect Kahlan, instead of Raina,you would have done as I asked and stayed?” She didn’t answer. “I’ve counted onall of you, and you’ve made me feel a fool for trusting you.” He flexed hisfists instead of yelling. “I would have seen to Kahlan’s protection if I’d knownI couldn’t trust you.”Richard leaned an arm against the window frame and stared out at the cold springmorning. The four behind him shifted their feet uneasily. “Lord Rahl,” Berdinesaid at last, “we would lay down our lives for you.” Richard rounded on them.“And let Kahlan die!” He carefully quieted his tone. “You can lay down yourlives for me all you want. Play your games all you want. Pretend you’re doingsomething important. Play at being my guards. Just stay out of my way, and outof the way of people helping me in this effort to stop the Imperial Order.”He flicked his hand toward the door. “Dismissed.”Berdine and Raina shared a look. “We will be outside, in the hall, if you needus, Lord Rahl.”Richard gave them such a cold look that it drained the color from their faces.“I won’t be needing you. I don’t need people I can’t trust.” Berdine swallowed.“But-”“But what?”She swallowed again. “What about Kolo’s journal? Don’t you want me to help youwith the translation?”“I’ll manage. Anything else?” Each of them shook their heads.They began filing out. Raina, at the end of the line, paused and turned back.Her dark eyes fixed on the floor.“Lord Rahl, will you be taking us out, later, to feed the chipmunks?”“I’m busy. They’ll manage just fine without us.”“But... what about Reggie?”“Who?”“Reggie. He’s the one missing the end of his little tail. He... he... sat in myhand. He’ll be looking for us.”Richard watched her for a silence-filled eternity. He teetered between wantingto hug her and wanting to yell at her. He had tried the hugging, or itsequivalent, anyway, and it had nearly gotten Kahlan killed. “Maybe another day.Dismissed.”She wiped the back of her hand across; her nose. “Yes, Lord Rahl.” Raina quietlypulled the door closed behind her. Richard raked back his hair as he floppeddown in his chair again. With a finger, he slowly spun Kolo’s journal around andaround as he ground his teeth. Kahlan could have died while he was off lookingfor trees. Kahlan could have died while the people he thought were protectingher were instead following their own agenda.He shuddered to think what the added magic, the added rage, of the sword woulddo were he to draw it at that moment. He couldn’t recall being this angry,without the Sword of Truth in his hand. He couldn’t imagine the wrath of thesword’s magic on top of this.The words of the prophecy from the stone wall in the pit ran through his mindwith haunting, mocking finality.A soft knock silenced the hundredth, whispered sound of the prophecy in hishead.This was the knock he had been waiting for. He knew who it was. “Come in, Cara.”The tall, muscular, blond-haired Mord-Sith slunk in through the door. She pushedit closed with her back. Her head was bent, and she looked as miserable as hehad ever seen her.“May I speak with you. Lord Rahl?”“Why are you wearing your red leather?”She swallowed before answering. “It’s a... Mord-Sith thing. Lord Rahl.” Hedidn’t ask for an explanation; he didn’t really care. This was the one he hadbeen waiting for. This was the one who was at the core of his wrath. “I see.What do you want?”Cara approached the table and stood with her shoulders slumped. She had abandage around her head but he had been told that her head wound wasn’t serious.By the red-rimmed look of her eyes, it was obvious that she hadn’t slept thenight before. “How is the Mother Confessor this morning?”“When I left her, she was resting, but she’s going to be fine. Her woundsweren’t serious, as serious as they easily could have been. She’s lucky to bealive, considering what happened. Considering that she wasn’t supposed to havebeen down there with Marlin in the first place, considering that I specificallytold you that I didn’t want either of you down there “Cara’s eyes closed. “Lord Rahl, it was my fault entirely. I’m the one who talkedher into it I wanted to question Marlin. She tried to convince me to stay away,but I went anyway. She only went to try to make me leave him be, as you hadinstructed.”Had Richard not been so angry, he might have laughed. Even if Kahlan hadn’tadmitted the truth to him, he knew her well enough to recognize Cara’sconfession as pure fiction. But he also knew that Cara hadn’t put in much of aneffort to keep Kahlan away from the assassin.“I thought that I had control of him. I made a mistake.” Richard leaned forward“Didn’t I specifically tell you that I didn’t want either of you down there?”Her shoulders trembled as she nodded without looking up. His fist hitting thetable made her flinch. “Answer me! Didn’t I specifically tell you that I didn’twant either of you down there?”“Yes, Lord Rahl ““Was there any doubt in your mind what I meant?”“No, Lord Rahl “Richard leaned back in his chair. “That was the mistake, Cara. Do youunderstand? Not that you didn’t have control of him- that was beyond your power.Going down there was a choice you made. That was the mistake you made.“I love Kahlan more than anything in this world, or anything in any other world.Nothing else is so precious to me. I trusted you to protect her, to keep her outof harm’s view.”The sunlight coming through the patterned shears played across her red leatherin dappled patches like sunlight coming through leaves.“Lord Rahl,” she said in a small voice, “I fully understand the dimensions of myfailure, and what it means. “Lord Rahl, may I be granted a request?”“What is it?”She sank to her knees, bending forward in supplication. She took up her Agiel,holding it in both trembling fists. “May I choose the manner of my execution?”“What?”“A Mord-Sith wears her red leather at her execution. If she has previouslyserved with honor, she is allowed to choose the manner of execution ““And what would you choose?”“My Agiel, Lord Rahl I know how I have failed you-I have committed anunforgivable transgression-but I have served with honor in the past. PleaseAllow it to be with my Agiel It’s my only request Either Berdine or Raina cancarry it out. They know how “Richard walked around the table. He leaned back against its edge, looking downat Cara’s slumped, quivering form. He folded his arms “Denied “Her shoulders shuddered with a sob “May I ask what Lord Rahl will choose?”“Cara, look at me,” he said in a soft voice. Her tear-stained face came up.“Cara, I’m angry. But no matter how angry I was, I would never, ever, have you,any of you, executed.”“You must. I have failed you. I have disobeyed your orders to protect your love.I have made an unforgivable mistake.”Richard smiled. “I don’t know that there are unforgivable mistakes. There may beunforgivable betrayals, but not mistakes. If we were going to start executingpeople for mistakes. I’m afraid I’d have been dead long ago. I make mistakes allthe time. Some of them have been pretty big.”She shook her head as she gazed into his eyes. “A Mord-Sith knows when she hasearned execution. I have earned it.” In those blue eyes he saw the iron of herresolution. “Either you carry it out, or I will.”Richard stood for a time, judging the demand of duty to which a Mord-Sith wasbound. Judging the madness in those eyes. “Do you wish to die, Cara?”“No, Lord Rahl. Since you have been our Lord Rahl, never. That is why I must. Ihave failed you. A Mord-Sith lives and dies by a code of duty to her master.Neither you nor I can alter what must be. My life is forfeit. You must carry outthe execution, or I will.”Richard knew that she wasn’t making a play for sympathy. Mord-Sith didn’t bluff.If he didn’t somehow change her mind, she would do as she promised.With comprehension, and the resulting, sickening realization of his only choice,he made the mental leap off the rim of sanity and into the madness, where dweltpart of this woman’s mind and, he feared, part of his. As irretrievable as aheartbeat, the decision had been made. Muscles flexing with the call, he drewhis sword. It sent the soft, matchless ring of steel through the room, throughhis bones.With that seemingly simple act, the wrath of the sword’s magic was loosed. Thelock on the door to death was slipped free. It took his breath like a wall of anacid wind. Storms of rage lifted on that biting wind. “Magic, then,” he toldher, “will be your judge, and executioner.” Her eyes squeezed shut. “Look atme!”The sword’s rage twisted through him, trying to carry him away with it. Hefought to maintain his grip of control, as he always had to do when he held thefury unleashed.“You will look into my eyes when I kill you!”Her eyes opened. Her brow wrinkled together, tears streaming down her cheeks.Any good she had done, any bravery in the face of danger, any sacrifice to herduty, had been stripped away in the face of her disgrace. She had been deniedthe honor of a death by her Agiel. For that, and that alone, she cried.Richard pressed the razor-sharp edge to his forearm, drawing for the blade itstaste of blood. He brought the Sword of truth to his forehead, touching the coldsteel, the warm blood, to his flesh. He whispered his invocation. “Blade, betrue this day.” This was the person who, for her presumption, and but for luck,would have cost him Kahlan. Cost him everything.She watched as the blade rose above him. She saw the fury, the righteous rage,in his eyes. She saw the magic dancing there.She saw death, dancing there.The knuckles of both fists were white as he gripped the hilt He knew he couldn’tdeny the magic its will-if he was to have a chance. He loosed his wrath at thiswoman for abandoning her responsibility to protect Kahlan. Her arrogance couldhave ended Kahlan’s life, ended his future, ended his reason for living He hadentrusted his dearest love to her care, and she had failed in her duty to honorhis faith.He could have returned to find Kahlan dead because of this woman on her kneesbefore him. For no other reason.Their eyes shared the madness of what they were doing, of what they each hadbecome, of knowing that there was no other way-for either of them He committedto cleave her in two. The sword’s wrath demanded it. He would accept no less. Heenvisioned it. He would have it. Her blood.With a scream of rage, with all his strength, with all his fury and anger, heswung the blade down toward her face. The sword’s tip whistled.In every detail, he could see the light glint off the polished blade as it sweptthrough a streamer of sunlight He could see drops of his sweat sparkle in thesunlight, as if frozen in space He could have counted them. He could see wherethe blade would hit her. She could see where the blade was going to hit her. Hismuscles screamed with the effort as his lungs screamed with rage.Between her eyes, an inch from her flesh, the blade stopped as solidly as if ithad thunked into an impenetrable wall.Sweat rolled down his face. His arms shook. The room echoed with the lingeringsound of his cry of fury. At last, he withdrew the blade from over Cara.She stared up with big, round, unblinking eyes She was panting in rapid, shortbreaths through her mouth. A long, low whine came from her throat. “There willbe no execution,” Richard said in a hoarse voice “How” she whispered, “how...could it do that? How could it stop like that?”“I’m sorry, Cara, but the sword’s magic has made the choice. It has chosen thatyou live You will have to abide by its decision “Her eyes finally turned to look into his “You were going to do it. You weregoing to execute me “ He slid the sword slowly into its scabbard. “Yes ““Then why am I not dead?”“Because the magic decided otherwise. We can’t question its judgment We mustabide by it “Richard had been reasonably sure that the sword’s magic wouldn’t harm Cara. Themagic wouldn’t let him harm one who was an ally. He had been counting on that.But there had been doubt. Cara had brought Kahlan within danger’s grasp, thoughnot intentionally. He wasn’t entirely sun that doubt wouldn’t cause the blade totake her. That was the way with the Sword of Truth’s magic-one wasn’t alwaysentirely sure.Zedd had told Richard when he had given him the sword that therein lay thedanger. The sword destroyed an enemy, and spared a friend, but the sword’s magicworked as a result of the view of its holder, not the truth. Zedd had told himthat doubt could possibly cause the death of a friend, or allow the escape of afoe.But he did know that if it was to work, he had to commit his entire being to theeffort, otherwise Cara wouldn’t believe the magic had spared her, and she wouldhave credited it to him. Then she would have been obligated to do as she hadpromised.His insides felt as if they were twisted into knots. His knees trembled. He hadbeen sucked into a world of dread; he hadn’t been positive that it would work ashe had planned.Worse, he wasn’t entirely sure he hadn’t made a mistake by sparing her. Richardcupped Cara’s chin. “The Sword of Truth has made its choice. It chose for you tolive, for you to have another chance. You must accept its decision.” Cara noddedin his hand. “Yes, Lord Rahl.”He reached under her arm and helped her to her feet. He could hardly standhimself, and wondered if he had been in her place if he would be able to get tohis feet as steadily as she. “I will do better in the future. Lord Rahl.”Richard pulled her head to his shoulder and held her tight for a moment,something he had been aching to do. Her arms slipped around him in gratefulsurrender. “That’s all I ask, Cara.”As she headed for the door, Richard called her name. She turned back. “You stillmust be punished.” Her eyes turned down. “Yes, Lord Rahl.”“Tomorrow afternoon. You will have to learn to feed chipmunks.” Her gaze cameback up. “Lord Rahl?”“Do you wish to feed chipmunks?”“No, Lord Rahl.”“Then that’s your punishment. Bring Berdine and Raina. They, too, are due somepunishment.”Richard closed the door after her, leaned against it, and shut his eyes. Theinferno of the sword’s rage had consumed his anger. He was left empty and weak.He shook so badly he could hardly stand.He was almost sick at the vivid memory of looking into her eyes as he broughtthe sword down with all his strength, expecting that he was going to kill her.He had been prepared for the spray of blood and bone. Cara’s blood and bone. Aperson he cared about.He had done what he had to, to save her life, but at what cost? The prophecyreeled through his head, and the nausea took him to his knees in a flash of coldsweat and dread."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15The soldiers he had stationed in the halls around the Mother Confessor’s roomsstepped aside, each clapping a fist to the chain mail over his heart as Richardwent by. He absently returned the salute as he swept past them, his gold capebillowing out behind. The soldiers crossed their pikes before the threeMord-Sith and two big bodyguards trailing him at a distance. When he hadpreviously stationed the soldiers, he had given them a very short list of whowas to be allowed through their positions. His five guards weren’t on the list.He glanced back to see Agiel come up into fists. He met Cara’s eyes. The threeMord-Sith reluctantly released their weapons.His five guards backed away from the challenge and set up their own guard postbeyond the soldiers. With a hand signal from Cara, Raina and Ulic swiftlydisappeared back down the hall. No doubt she had sent them to find another wayaround to guard the opposite end of the hall.When he rounded the next to last corner before Kahlan’s room, he saw Nadinesitting on a gilt-legged chair to the side of the hall. She was swinging herlegs like a bored child waiting to go outside and play. When she saw him coming,she bounded up out of the chair.She looked scrubbed and fresh. Her thick hair glistened. His brow twitched; herdress looked tighter than it had the day before. It seemed to fit closer to herribs and hips, showing her alluring shape more than he remembered. He knew itwas the same dress; he thought he must be imagining things. Seeing her figuredisplayed to such advantage reminded him that there had been a time...She schooled her enthusiasm, twisting a strand of hair with a finger as sheaffected a smile. Her delight at seeing him faltered as he approached. She tooka step back toward the wall as he stopped before her.Nadine’s gaze left his eyes. “Richard Good morning. I thought I heard someonesay you were back already. I was”-she gestured toward Kahlan’s room for anexcuse to look away-”I came... to see how Kahlan was doing this morning. I,well, I need to put on a new poultice. I was just waiting until I was sure shewas up, and-”“Kahlan told me how you helped her. Thanks, Nadine. I appreciate it more thanyou could know.”She shrugged one shoulder. “We’re hartlanders, you and I.” In the thick silenceshe twisted a thread between her fingers. “Tommy and skinny Rita Wellington gotmarried.”Richard watched the top of her bowed head as she played with the thread. “Iguess that was to be expected. That was what their parents wanted.”Nadine didn’t look up from her thread. “He beats the stuffing out of her. I hadto give her poultices and herbs one time when he made her bleed... you know,down there. People say it’s none of their business and pretend not to know it’shappening.”Richard wasn’t sure what she was getting at; he certainly wasn’t going back toHartland to rattle a conscience into Tom Lancaster’s head. “Well, if he keeps atit, her brothers might end up giving him a lesson in cracked skulls.”Nadine didn’t look up. “That could have been me.” She cleared her throat. “Icould have been married to Tommy, crying to anyone who’d listen about how...well, it could have been me. It could have been me pregnant, wondering if he’dbeat me till I lost this one, too.“I reckon I owe you, Richard. And you being a boy from Hartland and all... Ijust wanted to help if you were in trouble.” She shrugged her one shoulderagain. “Kahlan’s real nice. Most women would have... I guess she’s about theprettiest woman I ever saw. Nothing like me.”“I never figured you owed me anything, Nadine; I’d have done the same no matterwho Tom had caught alone that day but you have my sincere gratitude for helpingKahlan.”“Sure. I guess that was stupid of me to think you stopped him because...”Richard realized by the way she sounded on the verge of tears that he hadn’t putit very well, so he laid a hand tenderly on her shoulder. “Nadine, you’ve growninto a beautiful woman, too.”She peered up with a growing smile, “You think I’m beautiful?” She smoothed herblue dress at her hips.“I didn’t dance with you at the midsummer festival because you were still clumsylittle Nadine Brighton.”She started winding the string again, “I liked dancing with you. You know, Icarved the initials ‘N.C.’ on my betrothal trunk. For Nadine Cypher.”“I’m sorry. Nadine. Michael is dead.”She looked up with a frown. “Michael? No... that’s not what it meant. It meantyou.”Richard decided that this conversation had gone far enough. He had moreimportant things to worry about.“I’m Richard Rahl now. I can’t live in the past. My future is with Kahlan.”Nadine caught his arm as he started turning away. “I’m sorry. I know that. Iknow I made a big mistake. With Michael, I mean.”Richard caught himself just in time to bite off a caustic retort. What would bethe purpose? “I appreciate that you helped Kahlan. I suppose you’ll want to beheading home. Tell everyone I’m well. I’ll be back for a visit when-”“Kahlan invited me to stay a while.”Richard was caught off guard; Kahlan had neglected to tell him that part of it.“Oh. And you wish to stay for a day or two?”“Sure. I thought I’d like that. I’ve never been away from home before. If it’sall right with you, I mean. I wouldn’t wan to...”Richard gently pulled his arm from her hand. “Fine. If she invited you, thenit’s fine with me.”She brightened, as if oblivious to the disapproval on his face. “Richard, didyou see the moon last night? Everyone is abuzz about it. Did you see it? Was itas extraordinary, as remarkable, as they say?”“That, and more,” he whispered, his mood darkening. Before she could get inanother word, he marched off.His soft knock on the door produced a rotund woman in a staff uniform. Her ruddyface peered out through the narrow crack.“Lord Rahl. Nancy is just helping the Mother Confessor get dressed. She’ll befinished in a minute.”“Dressed!” he called to the closing door. The latch clicked into place. “She’ssupposed to be in bed!” he called through the heavy, ornately carved door.Getting no response, he decided to wait rather than cause a scene. Once, when helooked up, he saw Nadine peeking around the corner. Her head swiftly disappearedback around the corner. He paced before the door until the rubicund womanfinally opened it wide and held an arm out in invitation.Richard stepped into the room, feeling as if he was entering another world. TheConfessors’ Palace was a place of splendor, power, and history, but the MotherConfessor’s quarters were the place that, more than anywhere else in the palace,reminded him that he was really just a woods guide. It made him feel out of hiselement.The Mother Confessor’s rooms were a majestic, quiet sanctuary befitting thewoman to whom knelt kings and queens. If Richard had seen this room before hecame to know Kahlan, he wondered if he would have ever had the nerve to speak toher. Even now, it embarrassed him to recall teaching her to build snares and digroots when he didn’t know who, or what, she was.It made him smile, though, to remember her eagerness to learn. He was thankfulhe had come to know the woman before he came to understand the post she filled,and the magic she wielded. He thanked the good spirits she had come into hislife, and prayed she would be a part of it forever. She meant everything to him.The three marble fireplaces in the Mother Confessor’s sitting room were ablaze.The heavy drapes on the ten-foot-tall windows hung open slightly, forming tallslits, letting in only enough light, muted by the sheer panels behind, to makelamps unnecessary. He guessed that bright sunlight was inappropriate in asanctuary. There were only a few houses in Hartland that wouldn’t fit in thisroom alone.On a glossy, gold-embellished mahogany table to the side sat a silver tray withtea, soup, biscuits, sliced pears, and brown bread. None of it had been touched.The sight reminded him that he hadn’t eaten since noon the day before, butfailed to summon his appetite.The three women in crisp grey dresses with white lace collars and cuffs watchedhim expectantly, as if waiting to see if he would dare to simply walk in on theMother Confessor, or fall into a show of some other scandalous behaviour.Richard glanced at the door at the far end of the room, his sense of proprietymaking him ask the obvious. “Is she dressed?”The one who had cracked the door before reddened. “I wouldn’t have let you in,sir, had she not been.”“Of course.” He headed soundlessly across the plush, dark-hued carpets. Hestopped and turned back. They watched like three owls. “Thank you, ladies. Thatwill be all.”They bowed and reluctantly took their leave. He realized as the last one stole aquick glance over her shoulder while pulling the door closed that they probablyconsidered it the height of indecency for a man engaged to a woman to be alonewith her in her bedroom. Doubly so for the Mother Confessor.Richard forced out an annoyed breath; whenever he was anywhere near the MotherConfessor’s rooms, some member of the staff always managed to show up everyother minute checking to see if she needed anything. The variety of things theysuspected she might be needing never failed to surprise him. He sometimesexpected one of them to come right out and ask her if she might need her virtueprotected. Outside her rooms the staff was friendly, even joking with him whenhe put them at ease, or helped them carry things. A few were afraid of him. Butnot in her rooms. In her rooms, they all turned into bold, protective motherhawks.Inside the bedroom, against the far panelled wall, stood the huge bed, its fourgreat dark polished posts rising up like columns before a palace. The thick,embroidered bedcover cascaded down the sides of the bed like a colorfulwaterfall frozen in place. A slash of sunlight cut across the dark, sumptuouscarpets and over the lower half of the bed.Richard remembered Kahlan describing her bed to him, telling him how shecouldn’t wait to have him in it, when they were married. He very much wanted tobe in bed with her; it had been since that night between worlds that he had beenalone with her-in that way-but he had to admit that he was intimidated by thatbed of hers. He thought he might lose her in it. She had promised there would beno chance of that.Kahlan was standing at the row of glassed doors before the expansive balcony,looking out past the open curtain. She was staring out over the stone railingsand up toward the Keep on the mountainside. The sight of her in her satiny whitedress flowing smoothly over her ravishing curves, with her dazzling manecascading down her back, nearly took his breath. The sight of her made him ache.He decided that the bed would be just fine.When he tenderly touched her shoulder, she started.She turned, a beaming smile on her face as she looked up at him. “I thought youwere Nancy, come back in.”“What do you mean, you thought I was Nancy? You didn’t know it was me?”“How would I know it was you?”He shrugged. “Because. I always can tell when it’s you who’s walked into a room.I don’t have to see you.” Her brow furrowed in disbelief. “You cannot.”“Of course I can.”“How?”“You have a unique fragrance. I know the sounds you make, the sound of yourbreathing, the way you move, the way you pause. They’re all unique to you.” Herfrown grew. “You’re not kidding” You mean it? You’re serious?”“Of course. Can’t you tell me by those things?”“No. But I guess you’ve spent much of your life in the woods, watching,smelling, listening.” She slipped her good arm around his. “I still don’t knowif I believe you.”“Then test me some time.” Richard stroked his fingers down her hair. “How areyou feeling? How’s your arm?”“I’m all right. It’s not so bad. Not as bad as that time elder Toffalar cut me.Remember? That was worse than this.”He nodded. “What are you doing out of bed? You were told to rest.” She pushed athis stomach. “Stop. I’m fine.” She looked him up and down.“And you look more than fine. I can’t believe you had that made for me. You lookmagnificent. Lord Rahl.”Richard tenderly met her lips. She tried to pull him into a more passionatekiss, but he pulled back. “I’m afraid I’ll hurt you,” he said.“Richard, I’m fine, really. I was exhausted before because I used my power,along with all the rest of it. People mistook that for me being hurt worse thanI was.”He appraised her for a long moment, before bending to the kind of kiss he hadbeen longing to give her.“That’s better,” she breathed on parting. She pushed back. “Richard, did you seeCara? You left so quickly, and you had that look in your eye. I didn’t have timeto really talk to you. It wasn’t her fault.”“I know. You told me.”“You didn’t yell at her, did you?”“We had a talk.”She squinted. “Talk. What did she have to say for herself? She didn’t try totell you that she was... ?”“What’s Nadine still doing here?”She was looking at him. She snatched his wrist. “Richard, you have blood onyou... your arm...”She looked up in alarm. “What did you do? Richard... you didn’t hurt her, didyou?” She lifted his arm higher into the light. “Richard, this looks like...like when you...”She seized his shirt. “You didn’t hurt her? Tell me that you didn’t hurt her!”“She wanted to be executed. She gave me the choice of doing it, or she would. SoI used the sword, like that time with the Mud People elders.”“She’s all right? She’s all right, isn’t she?”“She’s all right.”Kahlan, concern in her expression, looked into his eyes. “And you? Are you allright?”“I’ve been better. Kahlan, what is Nadine still doing here?”“She’s just staying for a visit, that’s all. Have you met Drefan yet?” Richardheld her away when she moved to lay her head to his chest. “What is she doinghere? Why did you invite her to stay?”“Richard, I had to. Trouble from Shota isn’t so easily dismissed. You ought toknow that. We have to know what’s going on before we can do something to makesure Shota can’t cause us trouble.”Richard went to the glassed door and stared out at the mountain towering overthe city. The Wizard’s Keep stared back. “I don’t like it. Not one bit.”“Neither do I,” she said from behind him. “Richard, she helped me. I didn’tthink she would have the guts to keep her head, but she did. She’s confused byall this, too. Something more than we’re seeing is going on, and we have to useour heads, not hide under the blankets.”He heaved a sigh. “I still don’t like it, but you have a point. I only marrysmart women.”He could hear Kahlan absently smooth her dress behind him. The fragrance of hercalmed him.“I can see why you liked her. She’s a lovely woman, besides being a healer. Itmust have hurt you.”The Keep seemed to absorb the morning sunlight in its dark stone. He should goup there. “What must have hurt me?”“When you caught her kissing Michael. She told me how you caught her kissingyour brother.”Richard wheeled around, staring in slack-jawed disbelief. “She told you what?”Kahlan gestured back toward the door, as if Nadine might appear to speak forherself. “She said that you caught her kissing your brother.”“Kissing him.”“That’s what she said.”Richard turned his glare back to the window. “Did she, now?”“What was she doing, then? You mean you caught-”“Kahlan, we have sixteen men who died down by the pit last night, and a dozenmore who may not live the day. I’ve got guards I can’t trust to protect thewoman I love. We’ve got a witch woman who has made it her life’s mission tocause us trouble. We’ve got Jagang sending us messages in walking dead men.We’ve got a Sister of the Dark loose somewhere. We’ve got half the army inAydindril sick and unable to fight if they have to. We’ve got representativeswaiting to see us. I’ve got a half brother I never knew I had downstairs underguard. I think we have more important things to discuss than Nadine’s... thanNadine’s difficulty with the truth!”Kahlan’s green eyes watched him tenderly for a moment. ‘That bad. Now Iunderstand what put that look in your eyes.”“Remember what you told me one time? ‘Never let a beautiful woman pick your pathfor you when there’s a man in her line of sight.’“She put a hand over his shoulder. “Nadine isn’t picking my path. I asked her tostay for my own reasons.”“Nadine sticks to what she wants like a hound on scent, but I’m not talkingabout Nadine. I’m talking about Shota. She’s pointing down a path, and you’rewalking right down it.”“We have to find out what’s down that path, and Shota’s reasons for pointing toit.”Richard turned back to the glassed door. “I want to know what else Marlin-Jagang-had to say. Every word. I want you to try to remember every word.”“Why don’t you just yell at me and get it over with?”“I don’t want to yell at you. You scared me to death, going down there. I justwant to hold you, to protect you. I want to marry you.” He turned back andlooked into her green eyes. “I think I have a way for it to work. With the MudPeople, I mean.”She stepped closer. “Really? How?”“First, you tell me everything Jagang said.”Richard idly watched the Keep as she went through the whole story: how Jagangsaid he watched the Ja’La game and that in his native tongue the name meant theGame of Life; that he wanted to witness the glory of what Marlin had done; howhe wanted Sister Amelia to return to him before he revealed himself; that he hadfound prophecies other than those Richard had destroyed, and that he had invokedone called a bound fork prophecy. “That’s all I remember,” she said. “Why areyou watching the Keep so intently?”“I’m wondering why Sister Amelia went there. And what Marlin was going to dothere. Any ideas?”“No. Jagang wouldn’t say. Richard, have you seen the prophecy in the pit?” Hisstomach roiled. “Yes.”“And? What does it say?”“I don’t know. I’ll have to translate it.”“Richard Rahl, you may be able to tell it’s me who has walked into a roomwithout seeing me, but I can tell when you’re not telling me the truth withouteven having to look into your eyes.”Richard couldn’t manage to smile. “Prophecies are more complicated than theirwords. You know that. Just hearing their words doesn’t mean it’s what it soundslike. Besides, just because Jagang found a prophecy, that doesn’t mean he caninvoke it.”“Well, that’s all true enough. I told him as much myself. He said that proof hehad invoked the prophecy would come on a red moon. Not much chance of that-”Richard spun around. “What did you say? You didn’t tell me that before. What didJagang say?”Her face paled. “I forgot... until you said... I told Jagang that I didn’tbelieve him-about invoking the prophecy. He said that proof would come on thered moon. Richard, do you know what that means?” Richard’s tongue felt thick. Hemade himself blink.“The moon was red last night. I’ve been outdoors my whole life. I’ve never seenanything even remotely like it. It was like looking at the moon through a glassof red wine. It gave me goose bumps. That was why I came back early.”“Richard, what did the prophecy say? Tell me.”He stared at her, trying to think of a lie he could make her believe. Hecouldn’t. “It said,” he whispered, “ ‘On the red moon will come the firestorm.The one bonded to the blade will watch as his people die. If he does nothing,then he, and all those he loves, will die in its heat, for no blade, forged ofsteel or conjured of sorcery, can touch this foe.’“Silence rang through the still room. Kahlan’s face was white. “What’s the restof it? Jagang said it was a bound fork prophecy. What’s the rest of it”-hervoice broke-”the other fork? You tell me, Richard. Don’t you lie to me. We’re inthis together. If you love me, then you tell me.”Dear spirits, let her hear the words, and not my dread. Let me at least spareher that.His left hand clutched the hilt of his sword. The raised letters of the wordTRUTH bit into his flesh. He blinked his vision clear. Show no fear.“ ‘To quench the inferno, he must seek the remedy in the wind. Lightning willfind him on that path, for the one in white, his true beloved, will betray himin her blood.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16Kahlan could feel tears falling down her cheeks.“Richard.” She sucked back a sob. “Richard, you know I would never... You don’tbelieve I could ever... I swear on my life. I would never... You have to believeme...”He swept her into his arms as she lost control over a wail of anguish.“Richard,” she sobbed against his chest, “I would never betray you. Not foranything in this world. Not to spare myself eternal torment in the underworld atthe Keeper’s hands.”“I know. Of course I know that. You know as well as I that you can’t understanda prophecy by its words. Don’t let it hurt you. That’s what Jagang wants. Hedoesn’t even know what it means; he just put it down there because the wordssounded like what he wanted to hear.”“But...I...” She couldn’t halt her weeping. “Shhhh.” His big hand held her headagainst him.The terror of the night before, and the worse terror of the prophecy, came outin uncontrollable tears. She had never cried in the face of battle, but in thesafety of his arms she couldn’t control herself She was swept away by a flood oftears no less powerful than the torrent in the drainage tunnel. “Kahlan, don’tlet yourself believe it. Please don’t.”“But it says...I will...”“Listen to me. Didn’t I tell you not to go down there to question Marlin? Didn’tI tell you that I would do it when I got back, and that it was dangerous and Ididn’t want you down there?”“Yes, but I was afraid for you and I just wanted-”“You went against my wishes. No matter your reasons, you went against my wishes,didn’t you?” She nodded against him. “That could be the betrayal in theprophecy. You were wounded, you were bleeding. You betrayed me, and you hadblood on you. Your blood.”“I wouldn’t call what I did a betrayal. I was doing it for you, because I loveyou and I was afraid for you.”“But don’t you see? The words of prophecy don’t always work the way they sound.At the Palace of the Prophets, in the Old World, both Warren and Nathan warnedme that prophecies aren’t meant to be understood by the words. The words areonly obliquely connected to the prophecy.”“But I don’t see how-”“I’m just saying that it could be something as simple as that. You can’t let aprophecy gain control of your fears. Don’t let it.”“Zedd told me that, too. He said that there were prophecies about me that hewouldn’t tell me because the words weren’t to be trusted. He said you were rightto ignore the words of prophecy. But this is different, Richard. This says Iwill betray you.”“I already told you how it could be something simple.”“Lightning isn’t simple. Being struck by lightning is a symbol for being killed,if not an outright declaration of the manner of your death. The prophecy says Iwill betray you, and because of that, you will die.”“I don’t believe it. Kahlan, I love you. I know it isn’t possible. You wouldn’tbetray me and bring me harm. You wouldn’t.”Kahlan clutched his shirt as she gasped a sob. “That’s why Shota sent Nadine.She wants you to marry someone else because she knows I will be the death ofyou. Shota is trying to save you-from me.”“She thought that once before, and she turned out to be wrong. Remember? IfShota had had her way, we wouldn’t have been able to stop Darken Rahl. He wouldrule us all right now, if we had given in to her reading of the future. Prophecyis no different.” Richard gripped her shoulders and held her at arm’s length sothat he could look into her eyes. “Do you love me?”His grip on her wounded shoulder made it sing with pain, but she refused to pullaway from his touch. “More than life itself.”“Then trust in me. I won’t let it destroy us. I promise. It will all fall intoplace for the best in the end. You’ll see. We can’t think of the solution ifwe’re focused on the problem.”She wiped at her eyes. He sounded so sure of himself. His confidence calmed herand bolstered her spirits. “You’re right. I’m sorry.”“Do you want to marry me?”“Of course, but I don’t see how we can leave our responsibility for such a longtime to travel-”“The sliph.” She blinked. “What?”“The sliph, up in the Wizard’s Keep. I’ve been thinking about it; we travelledall the way to the Old World and back in her, with her magic, and it took lessthan a day each way. I can wake the sliph, and we can travel in her.”“But she would take us to the Old World, to the city of Tanimura. Jagang issomewhere near Tanimura.”“That’s still a lot closer to the Mud People than Aydindril is. Besides, I thinkthe sliph can go other places, too. She asked me where I wished to travel. Thatmeans she can go other places. Maybe she can get us a lot closer than Tanimura.”Kahlan, her tears forgotten at the prospect of their wedding being possible,glanced up at the Keep. “We might be able to go to the Mud People, be married,and be back in a matter of a few days. We could be gone that long, surely.”Richard smiled as his arms circled her from behind. “Surely.” Kahlan wiped thelast of the tears away as she turned in his arms. “How do you always manage tofigure things out?”He nodded toward her bed. “I had a great deal of motivation.” Kahlan, a grinspreading on her face, was just about to reward him with something positivelyindecent, when there was a knock at the door. It immediately opened withoutbenefit of an answer. Nancy stuck her head in.“Are you all right, Mother Confessor?” She glanced meaningfully to Richard.“Yes. What is it?”“Lady Nadine is asking if she could change the poultice.”“Is she now?” Kahlan said in a dark tone.“Yes, Mother Confessor. But if you are... indisposed, I could ask her to waituntil-”“Send her in. then,” Richard said.Nancy hesitated. “We will have to take the top of your dress down. MotherConfessor. To get at the bandage.”“It’s all right,” Richard whispered in Kahlan’s ear. “I have to go talk toBerdine. I have some work for her.”“I hope it doesn’t involve horse manure.” Richard smiled. “No. I want her towork on Kolo’s journal.”“Why?”He kissed the top of her head. “Knowledge is a weapon. I intend to be formidablyarmed.” He glanced to Nancy. “Need me to help with her dress?” Nancy managed toscowl and turn red at the same time. “I guess that means you will manage.” Atthe door, he turned back to Kahlan. “I’ll wait until Nadine’s finished with you,and then we better go see this Drefan fellow. I have a task for him. I’d... likeyou to be with me.”When he had closed the door, Nancy brushed back her short brown hair and movedaround behind Kahlan to help with her dress. “Your Mother Confessor’s dress, theone you were wearing yesterday, was ruined beyond repair.”“I expected as much.” Confessors had a collection of dresses, all the same.Confessors all wore black dresses; only the Mother Confessor wore white. Shethought about the blue wedding dress she would wear. “Nancy, do you rememberwhen your husband was courting you?” Nancy paused. “Yes, Mother Confessor.”“Then you must know how it would have made you feel if someone were to keeppopping in on you when you were alone with him.”Nancy eased the dress over Kahlan’s shoulder. “Mother Confessor, I was neverallowed to be alone with him until we were married. I was young, and ignorant.My parents were right to watch over me and the impulses of youth.”“Nancy, I’m a grown woman. I’m the Mother Confessor. I can’t have you and theother women popping your heads into my room whenever Richard is with me. Ow!”“Sorry. That was my fault. It isn’t proper. Mother Confessor.”“That’s for me to decide.”“If you say so. Mother Confessor.”Kahlan held her arm out as Nancy slipped the sleeve over her hand. “I say so.”Nancy glanced to the bed. “You were conceived in that bed. Who knows how manyMother Confessors before you conceived their daughters in that bed. It holds alegacy of tradition. Only wedded Mother Confessors took their men to that bed toconceive a child.”“And not one of them because of love. I was not conceived through love, Nancy.My child, if I have one, will be.”“All the more reason that it should be by the grace of the good spirits-in thesanctity of marriage.”Kahlan didn’t say that the good spirits had taken them to a place between worldsto sanctify their union. “The good spirits know what’s in our hearts; there isno one else for either of us, nor will there ever be.”Nancy busied herself at the bandage. “And you are eager to get to it. Like mydaughter and her young man are.” If Nancy only knew how eager.“That’s not it. I’m just saying that I don’t want you coming in on me whenRichard is here with me. We will be wedded soon. We are irreversibly committedto one another.“There is more to being in love than just jumping into bed, you know. Like justbeing close, in one another’s arms. Can you understand? I can’t very well kissmy future husband and have my injuries comforted by him if you keep popping yourhead in every two minutes, now can I?”“No, Mother Confessor.”Nadine knocked at the open door. “May I come in?”“Yes, of course. Here, set your bag on the bed. I can manage, now, Nancy. Thankyou.”With a deprecating shake of her head, Nancy shut the door behind herself. Nadinesat on the bed next to Kahlan and worked at finishing unwrapping the bandage.Kahlan frowned at Nadine’s dress.“Nadine, that dress... it is the same one yon were wearing yesterday, isn’t it?”“Sure.”“It seems-”Nadine looked down at herself. “The ladies washed it for me but it’s... Oh, Iknow what you’re talking about. It was torn in the tunnels, when we went for aswim. Some of the fabric at the seams was mined, so I had to take it in to saveit.“I haven’t had much of an appetite since I left home, thinking about... I mean,what with my travels, I was busy, and I’ve slimmed down a bit, so I was able totake in the seams and save the dress. It’s not too tight. It’s fine.”“In view of your aid, I will see to it that you get another dress that would bemore comfortable.”“No. This one’s fine.”“I see.”“Well, your cut looks no worse this morning. That’s encouraging.” She carefullywiped at the old poultice. “I saw Richard on the way out. He looked upset. Youtwo haven’t had a fight, I hope?”Kahlan’s forbearance evaporated. “No. He was upset because of something else.”Nadine paused at her work. She turned to her bag and brought back a horn. Thefragrance of pine pitch filled the air when she opened it. Kahlan winced asNadine dabbed on the poultice. When she was satisfied, she began winding thebandage back around Kahlan’s arm.“There’s no need to be embarrassed,” Nadine said in a casual tone. “Loverssometimes have spats. They don’t always end a relationship. I’m sure Richardwill come to his senses. Eventually.”“Actually,” Kahlan said, “I told him that I understood about you and him. Aboutwhat happened. That was why he was so upset.” Nadine’s wrapping slowed. “What doyou mean?”“I told him what you said about letting him catch you kissing his brother. Thelittle ‘shove’ you gave him. Remember?”Nadine brought the tails of the bandage around, her fingers suddenly workingswiftly at tying them. “Oh, that.”“Yes, that.”Nadine avoided looking up. She slipped the sleeve of the dress over Kahlan’shand. As soon as she had pulled the dress up over Kahlan’s shoulder, she droppedthe horn back in her bag.“That should do it. I should replace the poultice later today.” Kahlan watchedas Nadine hefted her bag and scurried for the door. Kahlan called her name.Nadine reluctantly paused and turned partway back. “Seems you lied to me.Richard told me what really happened.” Nadine’s freckles vanished in a crimsonglow. Kahlan stood and gestured toward a tufted velvet chair.“Care to set things right? To tell me your side of it?”Nadine stood woodenly for a moment, then sank into the chair. She folded herhands in her lap and stared down at them. “I told you, I had to give him ashove.”“You call that a shove?”Nadine turned even redder. “Well.” She flicked a hand. “I knew how boys losttheir heads over... over their lust. I figured that was my best chance ofgetting him to... to lay claim to me.”Kahlan was confused, but she didn’t let it show. “Seems it would have been alittle late for that.”“Well, not necessarily. I was bound to end up with one of them when I letRichard catch me like that, naked, atop Michael, having a good time of it.Michael was game for me, that was for sure.” Kahlan’s brow rose. “How did youfigure that-”“I had it worked out. Richard would come in behind me. He’d see me on Michael’slance, crying out with the pleasure of it, and he’d be taken with lust by thesight, and by my willingness. Then he’d lose his head, his inhibition, and atlast he’d have to have me, too.”Kahlan stared dumbly. “How was that going to get you Richard?” Nadine clearedher throat. “Well, it was like this; I figured that Richard would enjoy havingme. I’d make sure of that. Then, I’d tell him no the next time he wanted me, andhe’d want me so much, after he’d had a sampling, that he’d claim me. If Michaelwanted to claim me, too, then it’s my choice, and I’d choose Richard.“If Richard didn’t claim me, and I got pregnant, then I’d say it was his andhe’d marry me because it could be his. If I didn’t get pregnant, and he wouldn’tclaim me, well, then, there was still Michael. I figured second best was betterthan none.”Kahlan didn’t know what had happened, Richard hadn’t said. She feared Nadinewould stop her story right there. Kahlan couldn’t very well admit she didn’tknow what happened next, and worse, she feared to hear just how successfulNadine’s bizarre plan had been. In the first version, the kissing version,Richard had turned away. But Kahlan now knew that version wasn’t true.She watched the vein in the side of the Nadine’s neck throb. Kahlan folded herarms and waited.At last, Nadine collected her voice and continued. “Well, that was my plan,anyway. It seemed to make sense. I figured I’d get Richard out of it, at best,and Michael at worst.“It didn’t work the way I thought. Richard walked in and froze. I smiled over myshoulder. I invited him to come join the fun, or else to come to me later andI’d see to him, too.” Kahlan held her breath.“That was the first time I saw that look in Richard’s eyes. He didn’t say aword. He just turned and walked out.”Nadine stuck a hand in under the hair hanging around her face and wiped itacross her nose as she sniffled. “I thought I’d at least have Michael. Helaughed at me when I told him he’d claimed me. He just laughed. He never wantedto be with me again after that. He’d gotten what he wanted. I was no use to himafter that. He moved on to other girls.”“But, if you were willing to... Dear spirits, why didn’t you simply seduceRichard?”“Because I was worried he might expect that and have his resistance built up forit. I wasn’t the only girl he danced with. I was afraid he wouldn’t want tocommit, and that if I simply tried to seduce him, he might be ready for that andturn me down. I’d heard a rumor that Bess Pratter tried that. It didn’t seem tohave worked for her. I was afraid it wouldn’t be enough of a shove.“I figured that jealousy would be the thing that pushed him off the fence. Ifigured my plan would take him by such surprise that he’d just lose his headwith jealousy and lust, and then I’d have him. I’ve heard tell there’s nothingmore powerful in a man than jealousy and lust.”With both hands, Nadine pushed her hair back on her head. “I can’t believeRichard told you. I didn’t think he would ever tell anyone.”“He didn’t,” Kahlan whispered. “Richard only stared at me when I told him thatyou said he caught you kissing his brother. He didn’t tell me the story. Youjust did that all by yourself.” Nadine’s face sank into her hands.“You may have grown up with Richard, but you didn’t know him. Dear spirits, youdidn’t know the first thing about him.”“It might have worked. You don’t know as much as you think. Richard is just aboy from Hartland who never had anything and has had his head turned by finethings and people doing his bidding. That’s why it might have worked-because hejust wants what he sees. I was just trying to make him see what I have tooffer.” Kahlan’s head throbbed. She pinched the bridge of her nose as she shuther eyes. “Nadine, as the good spirits are my witness, you have got to be justabout the stupidest woman I have ever met.”Nadine sprang up from the chair. “You think I’m so stupid? You love him. Youwant him.” She jabbed her finger at her own chest. “You know how it feels, inhere, to want him. I wanted him no less than you. If you had to, you would dothe same thing. Right now, as well as you know him, you’d do the same if youthought it was your only chance. Your only chance! Tell me you wouldn’t!”“Nadine,” Kahlan said in a calm voice, “you don’t know the first thing aboutlove. Love isn’t about taking what you want; it’s about wanting happiness forthe one you love.”Nadine leaned in with a venomous expression. “You’d do the same as I did, if youhad to!”The words of the prophecy whisperer through Kahlan’s head. Lightning will findhim on that path, for the one in white, his true beloved, will betray him...“You’re wrong, Nadine. I wouldn’t. Not for anything in this world would I chancehurting Richard. Not for anything. I would live a life of lonely misery before Iwould hurt him. I would even let you have him before I would hurt him.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17A breathless, beaming Berdine lurched to a halt as Kahlan watched Nadine stormoff down the hall. “Mother Confessor, Lord Rahl wants me to stay up all nightand do work for him. Isn’t that wonderful?” Kahlan’s brow twitched. “If you sayso, Berdine.” Grinning, Berdine ran on down the hall in the direction Nadine hadgone. Richard was talking to a knot of soldiers just up the hall in the otherdirection. Beyond the soldiers, a ways further up the hall, Cara and Egan stoodwatching. When Richard saw Kahlan, he left the guards and came to meet her. Whenhe was close enough, she twisted a fistful of his shirt and pulled him close.“Answer me one thing, Richard Rahl.” she hissed through gritted teeth. “What’sthat?” Richard asked in innocent bewilderment. “Why did you ever dance with thatwhore!”“Kahlan, I’ve never heard you use such language.” Richard glanced down the hallin the direction Nadine had gone. “How did you get her to tell you?”“I tricked her into it.” Richard smiled a sly smile. “You told her that I toldyou the story, didn’t you.” His smile widened when she nodded. “I’ve been a badinfluence on you,” he said. “Richard, I’m sorry I asked her to stay. I didn’tknow. If I ever get my hands on Shota, I’m going to strangle her. Forgive me forasking Nadine to stay.”“Nothing to forgive. My emotions just got in the way of seeing that. You wereright to ask her to stay.”“Richard, are you sure?”“Shota and the prophecy both mentioned ‘the wind.’ Nadine plays some part inthis; she has to stay, for now. I’d better have her guarded, so she doesn’tleave.”“We don’t need guards. Nadine won’t leave.”“How can you be so sure?”“Vultures don’t give up. They circle as long as they think there are bones topick.” Kahlan looked back down the empty hall. “She actually had the nerve totell me that I would do what she had done, if I had to.”“I feel a bit sorry for Nadine. She has a lot of good in her, too, but I doubtshe will ever truly experience love.” Kahlan felt the heat of him at her back.“How could Michael do that to you? How could you ever have forgiven him?”“He was my brother,” Richard whispered, “I would have forgiven anything he didagainst me. Someday I will stand before the good spirits; I didn’t want to givethem a reason to say I was no better. “It was what he did to others that Icouldn’t forgive.”She put a comforting hand to his arm. “I guess I see why you want me to go withyou to meet Drefan. The spirits tested you with Michael. I think you will findDrefan a better brother. He may be a bit arrogant, but he’s a healer. Besides,it would be hard to find two that wicked.”“Nadine is a healer, too.”“Not compared to Drefan. His talent borders on magic.”“Do you think he wields magic?”“I don’t think so, but I have no way of telling.”“I will know. If he does have magic, I will know.”Guards at their post near the Mother Confessor’s room saluted after Richard gavethem instructions. Kahlan walked close at his side as they moved on down thehall. Cara stood up straighter when Richard paused before her. Even Egan perkedup expectantly. Kahlan thought Cara looked tired and miserable.“Cara,” Richard finally said, “I’m going to see this healer who helped you. Ihear he’s another bastard son of Darken Rahl, like me. Why don’t you come along.I wouldn’t mind having a... friend, with me.”Cara’s brow wrinkled together in near tears. “If you wish, Lord Rahl.”“I wish. You, too, Egan. Egan, I told the soldiers that you all are permitted topass. Go get Raina and Ulic and bring them along, too.”“Right behind you, Lord Rahl,” Egan said with a rare smile. “Where did you askDrefan to wait?” Kahlan asked. “I told the guards to take him to a guest room inthe southeast wing.”“The opposite end of the palace? Why all the way over there?” Richard gave heran unreadable look. “Because I wanted him to remain here, under guard, andthat’s as far from your rooms as I could get him.”Cara was still wearing her red leather; she hadn’t had time to change. Thesoldiers guarding the southeast wing of the Confessors’ Palace saluted withfists to hearts and moved aside for Richard, Kahlan, Ulic, Egan, and Raina inher brown leather, but they backed away an extra step for Cara. No D’Haranwanted the attention of a Mord-Sith in red leather.After the brisk march across the palace, they all came to a halt before a simpledoor flanked by leather and muscles and steel. Richard absently lifted his swordand let it drop back, checking that it was clear in its scabbard.“I think he’s more afraid than you,” Kahlan whispered up to him. “He’s a healer.He said he came to help you.”“He showed up to help on the same day as Nadine and Marlin. I don’t believe incoincidence.”Kahlan recognized the look in his eyes; he was bleeding a lethal flux of magicfrom his sword without even touching it. Every inch of him, every ripple of hardmuscle, every fluid movement, bespoke the calm coiling death.Without knocking, Richard threw open the door and stepped into the small,windowless room. Sparsely furnished with a bed, small table, and two simplewooden chairs, it was one of the more utilitarian guest rooms. To the side, theeyes of knots in a plain, pine wardrobe watched then. A small brick hearthprovided a modicum of heat to the chill, scented air.Holding Richard’s left arm from a half step behind, knowing better than to getin the way of his sword, Kahlan stayed close. Ulic and Egan stepped to eachside, their blond hair nearly brushing the low ceiling. Cara and Raina sweptaround them. screening Richard and Kahlan.Drefan knelt before the table against the far wall. Dozens of candles were setrandomly about the table. At the sound of all the commotion, he rose smoothly tohis feet and turned.His blue-eyed gaze took in Richard, as if no one else had entered the room withhim. Each absorbed in silent thoughts she could only imagine, they appraised oneanother.And then Drefan went to his knees, putting his forehead to the floor. “MasterRahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In your light wethrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We liveonly to serve. Our lives are yours.”Kahlan saw Richard’s two huge body guards and both Mord-Sith almost dropreflexively to their knees to join in the devotion to the Master of D’Hara. Shehad seen countless D’Haran’s in Aydindril give the devotion. She had stood atRichard’s side when the Sisters of the Light had knelt and sworn fidelity tohim. Richard had told her that at the People’s Palace in D’Hara, when DarkenRahl had been there, everyone went to devotion squares twice a day, for twohours each time, and said those same words over and over while touchingforeheads to the tiled floors.Drefan stood once more, assuming a relaxed, self-assured stance. He was dressednobly in a ruffled white shirt open to mid-chest, high boots turned down justbelow his knees, and tight, dark trousers that displayed enough of the swell ofhis manhood that Kahlan could feel her cheeks flush. She forced her eyes tomove. She could see at least four leather pouches attached to his wide leatherbelt, their flaps held closed with carved bone pins. Draped loosely over hisshoulders was the simple flaxen cloak she had seen him in before.The same height and build as Richard, and with the handsome cast of DarkenRahl’s features, he cut a striking figure. His tumbledown blond hair made histanned face look all the better. Kahlan couldn’t help staring at theflesh-and-blood twist of Richard and Darken Rahl.Richard gestured toward all the candles. “What’s this?” Drefan’s blue-eyed gazestayed locked on Richard. “I was praying. Lord Rahl. Making my peace with thegood spirits, should I be joining them this day.”There was no timidity in his voice; it was a simple, self-confident statement offact.Richard’s chest grew with a deep breath. He let it out. “Cara, you stay. Raina,Ulic, Egan, please wait outside.” He glanced to them as they were leaving. “Mefirst.”They returned grim nods. It was code: if Richard didn’t come out of the roomfirst, then Drefan died on his way out-a precaution Kahlan used herself.“I am Drefan, Lord Rahl. At your service, should you find me worthy.” He bowedhis head to Kahlan. “Mother Confessor.”“What did you mean about joining the good spirits?” Richard asked. Drefan slidhis hands into the opposite sleeves of the cloak. “There is a bit of a story toit, Lord Rahl.”“Take your hands out of your sleeves, and then tell me the story.” Drefan pulledhis hands out. “Sorry.” He lifted his cloak back with a little finger to revealthe long, thin-bladed knife sheathed at his belt. He pulled the knife free withone finger and a thumb, flipped it in the air, and caught it by the point.“Forgive me. I meant to set it aside before your visit.”Without turning, he tossed the knife over his shoulder. The knife stuck solidlyin the wall. He bent, pulled a heavier knife from his boot, and tossed that overhis shoulder with his other hand as he straightened, sticking it, too, in thewall an inch from the first. He reached behind his back, under the cloak, andcame out with a wickedly curved blade. Without looking, he stuck it, too, in thewall behind, between the two blades already there.“Any other weapons?” Richard asked in a businesslike manner. Drefan spread hisarms. “My hands. Lord Rahl, and my knowledge.” He continued to hold his handsout. “Though even my hands wouldn’t be quick enough to defeat your magic. LordRahl. Please search my person to assure yourself that I am otherwise unarmed.”Richard didn’t act on the offer. “So, what’s the story?”“I am the bastard son of Darken Rahl.”“As am I,” Richard said.“Not exactly. You are the gifted heir of Darken Rahl. A distinct difference.Lord Rahl.”“Gifted? Darken Rahl raped my mother. I have often had reason to consider mymagic a curse.”Drefan nodded deferentially. “As you would have it, Lord Rahl. But Darken Rahldidn’t view offspring the way you seem to. To him, there was his heir, and therewere weeds. You are his heir; I am but one of his weeds.“Formalities associated with conception were irrelevant to the Master of D’Hara.Women were... simply there to bring, him pleasure and to grow his seed. Ones whoconceived inferior fruit-those without the gift-were barren soil, in his eyes.Even your mother, having produced his prized fruit, would have been no moreimportant to him than the dirt in his most coveted orchard.”Kahlan squeezed Richard’s hand. “Cara told me much the same. She said thatDarken Rahl... that he eliminated those he found without the gift.” Richardstiffened. “He killed my siblings?”“Yes, Lord Rahl,” Cara said. “Not in a methodical fashion, but rather on whim,or ill mood.”“I don’t know anything about his other children. I didn’t even know he was myfather until last autumn. How is it that you’re alive?” he asked Drefan.“My mother wasn’t...” Drefan paused, searching for an inoffensive way to put it.“She wasn’t treated as unfortunately as your cherished mother, Lord Rahl.“My mother was a woman of ambition and cupidity. She saw our father as a meansto gain status. As I have heard it told, she was fair of face and figure, andwas one of a few who was called to his bed repeatedly. Most were not.Apparently, she succeeded in cultivating his... appetite for her charms. To putit bluntly, she was a talented whore.“She hoped to be the one who bore him a gifted heir, so as to raise her statusin his eyes to something more.“She failed.” Drefan’s cheeks mantled. “She had me.”“That may be a failure in her eyes,” Richard said in a quiet tone, “but not inthe eyes of the good spirits. You are no less than I, in their eyes.” Thecorners of Drefan’s mouth curled in a small smile. “Thank you. Lord Rahl.Very magnanimous of you to cede to the good spirits that which was alwaystheirs. Not all men do. ‘In your wisdom we are humbled,’“ he quoted from thedevotion.Drefan was managing to be courteously respectful without being servile. Heseemed honestly deferential, but without losing his air of nobility. Unlike theway he had been in the pit, he was scrupulously polite, but he nonethelessexuded the bearing of a Rahl: no amount of bowing could alter his aplomb. LikeRichard, he carried himself with inherent authority. “So, what happened then?”Drefan took a deep breath. “She took me, as an infant, to a wizard to have metested for the gift, hoping to present Darken Rahl with the gifted heir thatwould bring her riches, station, and the fawning adoration of Darken Rahl. Did Ialso mention that she was a fool?” Richard didn’t answer, and Drefan went on.“The wizard broke the bad news to her: I was born without the gift. Instead ofbearing a pass to a life of ease, she had given birth to a liability. DarkenRahl was known to pull the intestines out of such women-an inch at a time.”“Obviously,” Richard said, “you managed not to draw his attention. Why not?”“My dear mother was responsible for that. She knew that she might be able toraise me, and never be noticed by him, never be killed, but she also knew itwould be a hard life of hiding and worry over every knock at the door.“Instead, she took me, when I was but an infant, to a remote community ofhealers, hoping that they would raise me in anonymity so that my father wouldhave no reason to come to know of me, and kill me.”“That must have been hard for her to do,” Kahlan said. His piercing blue eyesturned on her “For her grief, she prescribed herself a potent cure, which was inturn provided by the healers: henbane.”“Henbane,” Richard said in a flat tone. “Henbane is poison.”“Yes. It acts quickly, but has the unfortunate quality of being exquisitelypainful at its task.”“These healers provided her with poison?” Richard asked incredulously. Drefan’sraptor gaze, shadowed with admonition, returned to Richard. “The calling of ahealer is to provide the remedy that is warranted. Sometimes, the remedy isdeath.”“That doesn’t fit my definition of healer,” Richard said. returning the raptorgaze in kind.“A person who is dying, with no hope of recovery, and in great suffering, can beno better served than by the benevolent act of assisting them in ending theirsuffering.”“Your mother wasn’t dying with no hope of recovery.”“Had Darken Rahl found her, her suffering would have been profound, to say theleast. I don’t know how much you knew about our father, but he was known for hisinventiveness at giving pain, and making it last. She lived in shuddering fearof that fate. She was driven nearly insane with dread. She fell to tears atevery shadow. The healers could do nothing to prevent that fate, to protect herfrom Darken Rahl. Had Darken Rahl wanted to find her, he would have. Had sheremained with the healers, and been found, he would have slaughtered them allfor hiding her. She gave up her life to give me the chance at one.” Kahlanstarted when a log in the fire popped. Drefan didn’t start, nor did Richard.“I’m sorry,” Richard whispered. “My grandfather took his daughter, my mother, toWestland to hide her from Darken Rahl. I guess that he, too, understood thedanger she was in. The danger I was in.”Drefan shrugged. “Then we are much the same, you and I: exiles from our father.You, however, would not have been killed.” Richard nodded to himself. “He triedto kill me.”Drefan’s brow twitched with curiosity. “Really? He wanted a gifted heir, andthen he tried to kill him?”“He didn’t know, as I didn’t, that it was he who fathered me.” Richard turnedthe subject back to the matter at hand. “So, what’s this about you making peacewith the good spirits in case you are to join them today?”“The healers who raised me never kept from me the knowledge of who I was. I haveknown since I can remember that I was the bastard son of our master, of FatherRahl. I always knew that he could come at any moment and kill me. I prayed eachnight, thanking the good spirits for another day of life free from my father andwhat he would do to me.”“Weren’t the healers afraid that he would come and kill them, too, for hidingyou?”“Perhaps. They always discounted it. They said that they were not in fear forthemselves, that they could always say I was a babe abandoned to them and theydidn’t know my paternity.”“Must have been a hard life.”Drefan turned his back on them and seemed to stare into the candles for a timebefore he went on.“It was life. The only life I knew. But I do know that I was woefully tired ofliving each day in fear that he might come.”“He’s dead,” Richard said. “You no longer have to fear him.”“That is why I’m here. When I felt the bond break, and it was later confirmedthat he was dead, I decided that I would end my private terror. I’ve beenguarded since the moment I arrived. I knew I wasn’t free to leave this room. Iknow the reputation of the guards you surround yourself with. That was all partof the chance I took to come here.“I didn’t know if the new Lord Rahl would want me eliminated, too, but I decidedto end the constant death sentence hanging over my head. I’ve come to offer myservices to the Master of D’Hara if he will have me; or, if it is his will, thatmy life be forfeit for my crime of birth. “Either way, it will be over. I wantit over.” Drefan, his eyes watering, turned to face Richard.“There you have it. Lord Rahl. Either forgive me, or kill me. I don’t know thatI much care which anymore, but I beg you to end it-one way or the other.” Hischest rose and fell with labored breaths.Richard appraised his half brother in the dragging silence. Kahlan could onlyimagine what Richard must be thinking, at the emotions of those deliberations,at the painful shadows of the past, and the light of hope for what might be. Atlast, he held his hand out.“I’m Richard, Drefan. Welcome to the new D’Hara, a D’Hara that fights forfreedom from terror. We fight that none have to live in fear, as you have done.”The two men clasped wrists. Their big, powerful hands were the same size. “Thankyou,” Drefan whispered. “Richard.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18I heard that you saved Cara’s life,” Richard said. “I want to thank you. It musthave been hard, knowing that she was one of my guards who might end up harmingyou... if things didn’t go right for you.”“I’m a healer. It’s what I do-Richard. I’m afraid I may have trouble calling youanything but Lord Rahl-for a time, anyway. I feel the bond to you, to you as theLord Rahl.”Richard shrugged self-consciously. “I’m still having trouble getting used topeople calling me Lord Rahl.” He stroked a finger along his lower lip. “Do we...do you know if we... have any other half brothers, or sisters?”“I’m sure we must. Some must have survived. I’ve heard a rumor that we have ayounger sister, at least.”“Sister?” Richard grinned. “Really? A sister? Where do you think she is? Do youknow her name?”“I’m sorry, Lord . . - Richard, but all I know is the name: Lindie. The wordspassed on to me said that if she is still alive, she would be perhaps as much asfourteen years. The person who told me her name said that all he knew was herfirst name, Lindie, and that she was born in D’Hara, to the southwest of thePeople’s Palace.”“Anything else?”“I’m afraid not. You have now heard everything I know.” Drefan turned to Kahlan.“How are you feeling? Did the herb woman, what was her name, stitch you upproperly?”“Yes,” Kahlan said, “Nadine did fine. It hurts some, and I have a headache, Iguess from everything that’s happened. I didn’t sleep well last night with theache of my shoulder, but that’s to be expected. I’m fine.”He moved toward her, and before she knew it, he had her arm in his hand. Helifted it, twisted it, and pulled it, asking each time where it hurt. When hehad satisfied himself, he moved around behind her and gripped her collarbonewith his fingers while pressing his thumbs to the base of her neck. Pain shot upher spine. The room swam.He pressed under her arm, and at the back of her shoulder. “There. How’s that?”Kahlan rotated her arm, finding the pair greatly diminished. “Much better. Thankyou.”“Just be careful with it; I’ve numbed some of the pain, but it still must healbefore you put it to heavy use. Do you still have the headache?” Kahlan nodded.“Let me see what I can do for that.”He pulled her by the hand back toward the table and sat her in a chair. Helowered over her, blocking her view of Richard. Drefan pulled her arms outtoward himself, squeezing and manipulating the webs between her first fingersand thumbs. His hands made hers seem so small. He had hands like Richard: big,and powerful though less callused. He was hurting her, he was pressing so hard,but she didn’t voice a complaint, thinking he must know what he was doing.With him standing right in front of her, she had to turn her eyes up lest she beforced to stare at his tight trousers. Kahlan watched his hands kneadinghers-his fingers working over her flesh. She remembered his hand on Cara. Shevividly recalled those strong fingers working their way down under Cara’s redleather and between her legs. Working into her. Kahlan abruptly jerked her handsaway. “Thank you, that’s much better,” she lied.He smiled down at her with a penetrating, hawklike, blue-eyed, Rahl gaze. “I’venever healed a headache so quickly. Are you sure it’s better?”“Yes. It was just a little headache. It’s gone now. Thank you.”“Glad to help,” he said. He watched her for a long moment, the little smilestill on his lips. Finally, he turned to Richard.“I was told that you are to be wedded to the Mother Confessor, here. You are avery different sort of Lord Rahl from our father; Darken Rahl would never haveconsidered marriage for himself. Of course, he probably was never tempted intomarriage by one so beautiful as your betrothed. May I offer my congratulations?When’s the wedding?”“Soon,” Kahlan interjected as she moved to Richard’s side. “That’s right,”Richard said. “Soon. We don’t know the exact date, yet. We... have a few thingsto work out.“Look, Drefan, I could use your help. We have a number of wounded men, and someof them are in grave condition. They were wounded by the same man who hurt Cara.I’d really appreciate it if you’d see what you could do to help them.”Drefan retrieved his knives, slipping them away without having to look at whathe was doing. “That’s what I’m here for: to help.” He headed for the door.Richard caught his arm. “You’d better let me go first. Until I change theorders, you will die if you step out of a room before me. We don’t want that.”As Richard took Kahlan’s arm and turned toward the door, she met Cara’s eyes foran instant. Her hearing wasn’t affected, Drefan had said. She could hear everything, even though she couldn’t react. She had to have heard Kahlan warn him notto put his hand on her there again. She had to have known what Drefan had beendoing, but she had been unable to do anything to stop him. Kahlan’s face heatedat the memory. She turned and hugged Richard’s waist as they went through thedoor.Richard looked up and down the quiet hall, and when he saw no one, he backed herto the panelled wall outside her rooms and pressed a kiss to her lips. She wasglad that Drefan had eased the pain in her arm earlier in the day; it hardlyhurt to circle both arms around Richard’s neck.She moaned against his mouth. She was tired from the long day, and her arm didstill hurt just a bit, but it wasn’t weariness or discomfort that drove out themoan-it was longing.He drew her into his arms and turned so that he was leaning his back against thewall instead. His powerful arms crushed her to him, almost lifting her toes fromthe floor as his kiss became more insistent. She returned it in kind. She pulledhis lower lip through her teeth and then backed away for a breath.“I can’t believe Nancy or one of her women isn’t here, waiting for us,” Richardsaid.He had left their guards farther up the hall, around the corner. They were atlast alone-a rare luxury. Even though she had grown up with people alwaysaround, she now found their constant presence wearing. There was great value insimply being alone.Kahlan gave his lips a quick lick and a kiss. “I don’t think Nancy will bebothering us.”“Really?” Richard asked with a sly grin. “Why, Mother Confessor, who willprotect your virtue?”Her lips brushed his. “Dear spirits, no one, I pray.”He surprised her with an abrupt change of topic. “What do you think of Drefan?”That was a question she was not prepared to answer. “What do you think of him?”“I’d like to have a brother I could trust and believe in. He’s a healer. Thesurgeon was impressed with the way he helped some of those men. He said that atleast one of them will live only because of what Drefan did for him. Nadine wasmore than a little curious about some of the compounds he carries in the leatherpouches at his belt. I’d like to think that I have a brother who helps people.Nothing seems so noble as that.”“Do you think he has magic?”“I didn’t see any trace of it in his eyes. I’m sure I would have been able totell. I can’t explain how I can sense magic, now, how I can see it sometimessparkle in the air about a person, or show in their eyes, but I didn’t see anyof that with Drefan. I think that he is simply a talented healer.“I’m grateful that he saved Cara. At least he said he saved her. What if she hadrecovered on her own after Marlin was dead and her link with him was broken?”Kahlan hadn’t thought of that. “So, you don’t trust him?”“I don’t know. I still don’t believe in coincidence.” He sighed in frustration.“Kahlan, I need you to be honest, and not let me be blinded because he’s mybrother and I want to trust him. I haven’t proven a very good judge of brothers.If you have any reason to doubt him, I want to hear about it.”“All right. That seems fair.”He tipped his head toward her. “For example, you can tell me why you lied tohim.”Kahlan frowned. “What do you mean?”“About your headache being gone. I could see that he didn’t make it any better.Why did you tell him that it was gone?” Kahlan cupped a hand to the side of hisface.“I’d like you to have a brother you could be proud of, Richard, but I want it tobe real. I guess what you said about coincidence has made me wary, that’s all.”“Anything other than simply what I said, about coincidence?”“No. I hope he can bring a little brotherly love to your heart. I pray that itis nothing more than simple coincidence.”“Me, too.” She gave his arm an affectionate squeeze. “I know he has the women onthe staff all aflutter. I suspect he will soon be breaking hearts, what with allthe swooning looks I’ve seen.“I promise to let you know if he gives me reason to suspect something amiss.”“Thanks.”He didn’t smile at what she said about the women all liking Drefan. Richard hadnever displayed any jealousy, he didn’t have reason to, even if she hadn’t beena Confessor, but still, there was a painful history with Michael that sherealized could make reason less than relevant. She wished she hadn’t mentionedit.He ran his fingers back into her hair, holding the sides of her head as hekissed her. She pulled back.“Why did you take Nadine with you this afternoon?”“Who?”He leaned toward her again. She pulled back. “Nadine. Remember her? The woman inthe tight dress?”“Oh, that Nadine.”She poked his ribs. “So, you noticed her dress.”His brow drew together. “Did you think there was something different about it,today?”“Oh yes, there was something different about it. So, why did you take her withyou?”“Because she’s a healer. She’s not an evil person-she has good qualities. Ithought that as long as she was going to be here, she might as well make herselfuseful. I thought that that might make her feel better about herself. I had hercheck that the men were making the quench Oak tea properly, that it was strongenough. She seemed happy to help.”Kahlan remembered Nadine’s smile when Richard had asked her to go with him. Shehad been happy, all right, but not simply to help. The smile was for Richard, aswas the dress.“So,” Richard said, “you think Drefan is handsome, as all the other women do?”She thought his trousers were too tight. She pulled Richard into a kiss, hopinghe wouldn’t notice her face flushing and misunderstand the reason for it. “Who?”she breathed dreamily.“Drefan. Remember him? The man in the tight pants?”“Sorry, I don’t remember him,” she said as she kissed his neck, and she nearlydidn’t. She ached for Richard and nothing else.There was no room in her mind for Drefan. Almost the only thing in her thoughtswas the time she had been with Richard in that strange place between worldswhere they had been together, truly together, as never before or since. Shewanted him that way again. She wanted him that way now.With the way his hands were slipping down her back, and the urgency of his lipson her neck, she knew he wanted her the same way, and just as badly.But she also knew that Richard didn’t want to even appear to be like his father.He didn’t want anyone to think she was no more than Darken Rahl’s women hadbeen: an amusement for the Master of D’Hara. That was why he always let thewomen on the staff so easily keep him a bay; despite his frustrated objections,he never overruled them when they shooed him away.The three Mord-Sith, too, always seemed to be protecting Kahlan from being seenas less than the true betrothed to the Master of D’Hara. Whenever she andRichard thought to go to his room at night, even just to talk, either Cara, orBerdine, or Raina was always there, asking some pointed question that seemed tokeep them apart. When Richard scowled, they reminded him that he had instructedthem to protect the Mother Confessor: he never countermanded the orders.Today, the three Mord-Sith were scrupulously following his orders, and when hehad told Cara and Raina to guard him from around the corner and down the hall,they had remained there without objection.With their wedding so soon. Kahlan and Richard had decided to wait, even thoughthey had already been together once. That time seemed somehow unreal- in a placebetween worlds, in a place with no heat, no cold, no source of light, no ground,and yet they could see. and they had lain in dark space firm enough to supportthem.More than anything, she remembered the feel of him. They had been the source ofall heat. all light, all feeling, in that ‘strange place between worlds wherethe good spirits had taken them.She was feeling that heat. now, as she ran her hands over the muscles of hischest and stomach. She could hardly get her breath with the feel of his lips onher. She wanted his mouth everywhere on her. She wanted hers everywhere on him.She wanted him on the other side of her door.“Richard,” she whispered in his ear, “please, stay with me tonight.” His handswere making her lose all sense of restraint. “Kahlan, I thought...”“Please. Richard. I want you in my bed. I want you in me.” He moaned helplesslyat her words, and at her hands. “I hope I’m not interrupting,” came a voice.Richard jerked up straight. Kahlan spun around. With the thick carpets, theyhadn’t heard Nadine’s silent approach. “Nadine,” Kahlan said, catching herbreath. “What... ?” Kahlan self-consciously clasped her hands behind her back,wondering if Nadine had seen where they had just been. She had to have seenwhere Richard’s had been. Kahlan felt her face going red.Nadine’s cool gaze moved from Richard to Kahlan. “I didn’t mean to interrupt. Ijust came to change your poultice. And to apologize.”“Apologize?” Kahlan asked, still gulping air.“Yes. I said some things to you earlier, and I guess I was a bit... out of sortsat the time. I thought I may have said some things I shouldn’t have. I thought Ishould apologize.”“That’s all right.” Kahlan said. “I understand how you felt at the time.” Nadinelifted her bag and her eyebrow:;. “The poultice?”“My arm is fine for tonight. You could change the poultice for me tomorrow,though.” Kahlan sought to fill the dragging silence. “Drefan did some of hishealing on it earlier... so it’s fine for tonight.”“Sure.” She lowered her bag. “You two off to bed. then?”“Nadine,” Richard said in a restrained tone, “thanks for checking on Kahlan.Good night.”Nadine regarded him with a cold glower. “Don’t even plan to get married first?Just going to throw her down on the bed and lay claim to her, like some girl youcome across in the woods? Seems a bit crude for the high and mighty Lord Rahl.And here you were pretending you were better than us common folk.”She glanced down at Richard and then turned her glare on Kahlan. “Like I saidbefore, he wants what he’s shown. Shota told me about you. I guess you knowabout what pushes men off the fence, too. It seems you would do anything to havehim, after all. Like I said before, you’re no better than me.” Bag in hand, sheturned and marched off down the hall. Kahlan and Richard stood in theuncomfortable silence, watching the empty hall. “Out of the mouths of whores,”Kahlan said.Richard wiped his hands back across his face. “Maybe she has a point.”“Maybe she does,” Kahlan admitted reluctantly. “Well, good night. Sleep well.”“You, too. I’ll be thinking about you in that little guest room you use.” Hebent and kissed her cheek. “Not going to bed right off.”“Where are you going?”“Oh, I thought I’d go dunk myself in a horse trough.”She caught him by the wide, leather-padded band around his wrist. “Richard, Idon’t know if I can stand this much longer. Are we ever going to get marriedbefore something else happens?”“We’ll go wake the sliph just as soon as we make sure everything here is inorder. I promise. Dear spirits, I promise.”“What things?”“Just as soon as we know that the men are getting better, and I’m satisfiedabout a few other things. I want to make sure that Jagang can’t make good on histhreats. A couple of days and the men should be better. A couple days. Ipromise.”She held one of his fingers in each of’ her hands as she stared longingly intohis grey eyes. “I love you,” she whispered. “In a few days, or after aneternity. I’m yours. Words spoken over us or not, I’m forever yours.”“We are already one, in our hearts. The good spirits know the truth of that.They want us to be together, they’ve already proven it, and will watch over us.Don’t worry, we’ll have the words said over us.”He started away, but turned back win a haunted look in his eyes. “I only wishZedd could be there when we’re married. Dear spirits, I wish he could. And thathe was here to help me, now.”When he looked back from the comer at the end of the hall, Kahlan threw him akiss. She shuffled into her empty, lonely rooms and threw herself on her bigbed. She thought about what Nadine said: “Shota told me about you.” Kahlan weptin frustration.“So, you’re not going to be sleeping... up here, tonight,” Cara said when hewalked past.“And what would make you think I was?” Richard asked. Cara shrugged. “You madeus wait around the corner.”“Maybe I just wanted to kiss Kahlan good night without you two passing judgmenton my skill.”Cara and Raina both smiled, the first he had seen from them all day. “I havealready seen you kiss the Mother Confessor,” Cara said. “You appear quitetalented at it. It always leaves her breathless and wanting more.” Even thoughhe didn’t feel like smiling, he did anyway because he was glad to see themsmiling. “That doesn’t mean I’m talented, it just means she loves me.”“I’ve been kissed,” Cara said, “and I’ve seen you kiss. I believe I can say withsome authority that you are talented at the task. We watched you from around thecorner tonight.”Richard tried to look indignant as he felt his face going red. “I gave youorders to stay down here.”“It is our responsibility to watch over you. To do that, we can’t let you out ofour sight. We can’t follow such orders.”Richard shook his head. He couldn’t be; angry over the violation of orders. Howcould he, when they were risking his anger to protect him? They hadn’tendangered Kahlan in doing so. “What do you two think of Drefan?”“He is your brother. Lord Rahl,” Raina said. “The resemblance is obvious.”“I know the resemblance is obvious. I mean, what do you think of him.”“We don’t know him. Lord Rahl,” Raina said.“I don’t know him, either. Look, I’m not going to be angry if you tell me youdon’t like him. In fact. I’d really like to know if you don’t. What about you,Cara? What do you think of him?”She shrugged. “I’ve never kissed either of you, but from what I have seen, Iwould rather kiss you.”Richard put his hands on his hips. “What does that mean?”“I was hurt, yesterday, and he helped me. But I don’t like the fact that masterDrefan came now, when Marlin and Nadine came.”Richard sighed. “My thoughts, too. I ask people not to judge me because of whomy father was, and I find myself doing that with him. I’d really like to trusthim. Please, both of you, if you have any reason for concern, don’t be afraid tocome and tell me.”“Well,” Cara said, “I don’t like his hands.”“What do you mean?”“He has hands like Darken Rahl. I have already seen them caressing fawningwomen. Darken Rahl did that, too.”Richard threw his hands up. “When did he have time to do that? He was with memost of the day!”“He found the time, when you were talking to soldiers and when you were outchecking on the men with Nadine. It didn’t take him long. The women found him. Ihave never seen so many women batting their lashes at a man. You have to admit,he is fine to look upon.”Richard didn’t see what was so especially fine about his looks. “Have any ofthese women not been willing?”Her answer was a long moment in coming. “No, Lord Rahl.”“Well, I guess I’ve seen other men who acted like that. Some of them have beenmy friends. They liked women, and women liked them. As long as the women arewilling, I can’t see that it’s any of my business. I’m more concerned aboutother things.”“Like what?”“I wish I knew.”“If you learn that he is here innocently, and only means to help, as he says,then you can be proud of him. Lord Rahl. Your brother is an important man.”“He is? How important is he?”“Your brother is the leader of his sect of healers.”“He is? He never told me that.”“No doubt he did not wish to vaunt himself. Humility before the Lord Rahl is theway of D’Harans, and one of the tenets of that ancient sect of healers.”“I suppose. So he leads these healers?”“Yes.” Cara said. “He is the High Priest of the Raug’Moss.”“The what?” Richard whispered. “What did you call them?”“The Raug’Moss, Lord Rahl.”“Do you know the meaning of the words?”Cara shrugged. “Just that it means ‘healers’ that’s all. Does it have somemeaning to you. Lord Rahl?”“Where’s Berdine?”“In her bed, I would suppose.”Richard started down the hall, calling orders back to them as he went. “Cara,post a guard for the night around Kahlan’s room. Raina, go wake Berdine and askher to meet me in my office.”“Now, Lord Rahl?” Raina asked. ‘This late?”“Yes, please.”Richard took the steps two at a time on the way to his office where waited thejournal, Kolo’s journal, written in High D’Haran. In High D’Haran, Raug’Mossmeant “Divine Wind.”Both Shota’s warning to Nadine for Richard, “the wind hunts him,” and the wordsfrom the prophecy down in the pit, “he must seek the remedy in the wind,” spunthrough his mind."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19This time,” Ann warned, “you had better let me do the talking. Understand?”Her eyebrows drew so tight together Zedd thought they might touch. She leanedclose enough that he could smell the lingering aroma of sausage on her breath.With a fingernail she tapped his collar-another warning, albeit a wordless one.Zedd blinked innocently. “If it would please you. by all means, but my talesalways have your best interest, and our purpose, at heart.”“Oh, of course, and your clever wit is always a delight, too.” Zedd felt thather affected smile was overdoing it; the sardonic praise would have been quiteenough. There were accepted customs to such things. The woman really did need tolearn where the line was.Zedd’s gaze again focused beyond her, to the problem at hand. He passed acritical eye over the inn’s dimly lit door. It was across the street and at theend of a narrow, board walk. Above the alleyway that ran between two warehouseshung a small sign: “Jester’s Inn.”Zedd didn’t know the name of the large town they had come to in the dark, but hedid know that he would have preferred to pass it by. He had seen several inns inthe town; this wasn’t the one he would have chosen, had he a choice.Jester’s Inn looked as if it had either been an afterthought meant to useavailable space in the back, or else its proprietors wanted to shelter it fromthe scrutiny of honest people and the critical eye of authority. From thecustomers Zedd had already seen, he was leaning in the direction of the secondguess. Most of the men looked to be mercenaries or highwaymen. “I don’t likeit,” he muttered to himself.“You don’t like anything.” Ann snapped. “You’re the most disagreeable man I’veever met.”Zedd’s eyebrows went up in true surprise. “Why would you say that? I’ve beentold that I’m a most pleasant travelling companion. Do we have any of thatsausage left?”Ann rolled her eyes. “No. What is it you don’t like this time?” Zedd watched aman look both ways before going to the door at the back of the dark alleyway.“Why would Nathan go in there?”Ann looked over her shoulder, across the deserted street of rutted, frozenslush. She fingered a stray wisp of greying hair into the loose knot tied at theback of her head.“To get a hot meal and some sleep.” She scowled back at Zedd. “That is, if he’seven in there.”“I’ve shown you how to sense the thread of magic I used to hook the tracer cloudto him. You’ve felt it, felt him.”“True enough,” Ann admitted. “Yet now that we finally catch him, and know thathe’s in there, you suddenly don’t like it.” ‘That’s right,” he said distantly. “I don’t like it.”The scowl on Ann’s face lost its heat and turned serious. “What is it thatbothers you?”“Look at the sign. After the name, ‘A pair of woman’s legs pointed up in theshape of a V. She turned back and peered at him is if he were daft. “Zedd, theman has been locked up in the Palace of the Prophets for almost a thousandyears.”“You just said it: he’s been locked up.” Zedd tapped the collar, called aRada’Han, around his own neck, the collar she had put on him to capture him andmake him do her bidding. “Nathan is not inclined to be locked up in a collaragain. It probably took him hundreds of years of planning, and the right turn ofevents, to get out of his collar and to escape. I dread to consider how that manmay have influenced or even directly altered events through prophecy to bring topass the turn of fate that allowed him the opportunity to get off his collar.“Now you expect me to believe he would go in there just to be with a woman? Whenhe has to know you’re chasing after him?”Ann stared in stunned disbelief, “Zedd, are you saying that you think Nathan mayhave influenced events-prophecies-just to get his collar off?”Zedd looked across the road and shook his head. “I’m just saying I don’t likeit.”“He probably wanted what’s in there enough that it distracted him from worryingabout me. He simply wanted some female companionship, and ignored the dangers ofbeing caught.”“You have known Nathan for over nine centuries. I’ve only known him a shorttime.” He leaned down closer to her and lifted an eyebrow. “But even I knowbetter than that. Nathan is anything but stupid. He is a wizard of remarkabletalent. You make a serious mistake if you underestimate him.”She watched his eyes a moment. “You’re right; it may be a trap. Nathan wouldn’tkill me to escape, but beyond that... You may be right.” Zedd harrumphed.“Zedd,” Ann said, after a long, uncomfortable silence, “this business withNathan is important. He must be caught. He’s helped me in the past when we havediscovered danger in the prophecies, but he is still a prophet. Prophets aredangerous. Not because they deliberately wish to cause trouble, but because ofthe nature of prophecy.”“You don’t need to convince me of that. I know well the dangers of prophecy.”“We have always kept prophets confined at the Palace of the Prophets because ofthe potential for catastrophe should they roam free. A prophet who wantedmischief could have it. Even a prophet who doesn’t wish mischief is dangerous,not only to others but to himself; people usually extract vengeance on thebringer of truth, as if knowing the truth is its cause. Prophecy is not meant tobe heard by untrained minds, those having no understanding of magic, much lessprophecy. “One time, as we sometimes did at his request, we let a woman visitNathan.” Zedd frowned at her. “You took prostitutes to him?”Ann shrugged self-consciously. “We knew the loneliness of his confinement. Itwasn’t the most desirable solution, but yes, we brought him companionship fromlime to time. We weren’t heartless.”“How magnanimous of you.”Ann glanced away from his eyes. “We did what we had to, by locking him in thepalace, but we felt sorrow for him. It wasn’t his choice to be born with thegift of prophecy.“We always warned him not to tell the women any prophecy, but one time he did.The woman ran screaming from the palace. We never knew how she escaped before wecould stop her.“She spread word of the prophecy before we could find her. It started a civilwar. Thousands died. Women and children died.“Nathan sometimes seems crazy, out of his senses. Sometimes he seems to me to bethe most dangerously unbalanced person I’ve ever known. Nathan views the worldnot only by what he sees around him, but through the filter of prophecy thatvisits his mind.“When I confronted him, he professed not to remember the prophecy, or havingtold the young woman anything. I only found out much later, when I was able tolink several prophecies, that one of the children who died was a boy named inprophecy as one who would go on to rule through torture and murder. Untold tensof thousands would have died had that boy lived and grown into a man, but Nathanhad choked off that dangerous fork in prophecy. I have no idea how much that manknows but won’t disclose.“A prophet has the potential to just as easily cause great harm. A prophet whowished power would have a fair chance of ruling the world.” Zedd was stillwatching the door. “So you lock them away.”“Yes.”Zedd picked at a thread on his maroon robes. He looked down at her squat form inthe dim light. “Ann, I am First Wizard. If I didn’t understand, I wouldn’t behelping you.”“Thank you,” she whispered.Zedd considered their options. There weren’t many. “What you are saying, if Iunderstand you, is that you don’t know if Nathan is sane, but even if he is, hehas the potential to be dangerous.”“I guess so. But Nathan has often helped me to spare people suffering. Hundredsof years ago, he warned me about Darken Rahl, and told me of a prophecy that awar wizard would be born-that Richard would be born. We worked together to seeto it that Richard would be safe from interference as he grew, so that you wouldhave the time to help raise your grandson into the kind of man who would use hisability to help people.”“For that, you have my gratitude,” Zedd offered. “But you put this collar aroundmy neck, and I don’t like that one bit.”“I understand. It’s not something I liked doing, nor am I proud of what I did.Sometimes, desperate need calls for desperate acts. The good spirits will havethe final say on my actions.“The sooner we get Nathan, the sooner I will take the Rada’Han from your neck. Idon’t enjoy holding you prisoner by that collar and making you help me, but inview of the dire consequences should I fail to get Nathan. I do as I feel Imust.”Zedd aimed a thumb over his shoulder. “I also don’t like that.” Ann didn’t look;she knew what he was pointing at. “What does a red moon have to do with Nathan?It’s most peculiar, but what does one have to do with the other?”“I’m not saying it has anything to do with Nathan. I just don’t like it.” Withthe thick clouds of the last few days, they had been slowed at night, both bythe darkness and also by the difficulty of seeing the tracer cloud he had hookedto Nathan. Fortunately, they had been close enough to sense the link of magicwithout having to see the tracer cloud; the tracer cloud was only used to getits tracker close enough to sense the link.Zedd knew they were very near to Nathan-within a few hundred feet. This close tothe object of the trace, the link’s magic distorted Zedd’s senses, his abilityto judge with the aid of his magic, his capacity to access his familiar abilitywith his gift. This close, his magic was like a bloodhound on scent, soconcentrated on the object of its search that it disregarded anything else butthe trail. It was an uncomfortable form of blindness, and another reason for hisunease.He could break the link, but that was risky before they actually had Nathan;once broken, it couldn’t be re-established without physical contact.The snow flurries of the last few days had slowed them and made the going coldand miserable. Earlier in the day the clouds had at last cleared away, even ifthey had left behind the bitter wind to vex them. They had been looking forwardto the moonrise, and the light it would provide as they closed in on Nathan.They had both watched in stunned silence when the moon had risen: It had risenred.At first, they thought that it might be a lingering haze that was causing it,but with the moon well overhead, Zedd knew it was not being caused by someinnocent atmospheric event. Worse, with the recent cloud cover, he didn’t knowhow long it had been since the moon had turned rid.“Zedd,” Ann finally asked into the breeding silence, “do you know what itmeans?”Zedd looked away, pretending to scan the shadows. “Do you? You’ve lived a lotlonger than I. You must know something about such a sign.”He could hear her fussing with her wool cloak. “You are a Wizard of the FirstOrder. I would defer to your expertise in such matters.”“You all of a sudden think my judgment worthwhile?”“Zedd, let’s not joust with words about this. I know that such a sign is withoutprecedent in my experience, but I do recall a reference to a red moon in anancient text, a text from the great war. The book didn’t say what it meant, onlythat it brought great alarm. “Zedd squatted in the shadow of the comer of the building they hid behind. Heleaned his back against the clapboards and held a hand out in invitation. Annsat beside him, deeper in the shadow.“In the Wizard’s Keep there are dozers of libraries, huge libraries, most atleast as large as the vault of books at the Palace of the Prophets, many a greatdeal larger. There are also many books of prophecy there.”There were books of prophecy at the Keep that were considered so dangerous thatthey were kept locked behind the powerful shields protecting the First Wizard’sprivate enclave. Not even the old wizards who had lived at the Keep when Zeddwas young were allowed to read those prophecies. Even though he had access tothem after he became First Wizard, Zedd had not read nearly all of them; theones he had read left him in sleepless sweats.“Dear spirits,” he went on. “there an; so many books at the Keep that I’ve noteven read all the titles. There used to be staffs of curators for each library.Each knew the books in his section of the stacks. Long ago, well before my time,these curators were gathered when an answer was sought. Each knew his own booksand could speak up if his particular books held information on the subject inquestion. In this way it was a relatively simple task to locate the referencevolumes or prophecies that might help with the problem at hand.“When I was very young, there were only two wizards left acting as curators. Twomen could not begin to tap the knowledge held there. A plethora of informationis held in those books, but finding a specific bit of it is a formidablechallenge. The guidance of the gift is needed to even begin to narrow thesearch.“Needing information from the libraries is like being adrift in the ocean andneeding a drink of water. Information is in overabundance, yet you can die ofthirst for it before you can locate it. When I was young, I was guided as towhat were the more important books of history, magic, and prophecy. I mostlyconfined my studies to those books.”“What about the red moon?” Ann asked. “What did the books you read say of it?”“I only recall once reading about a red moon. What I read wasn’t very explicit,mentioning it only obliquely. I wish I had thought to inquire into the subjectfurther, but I didn’t. There were other matters in the books that were ofgreater importance at the time and demanded my attention-matters that were real,and not hypothetical.”“What did this book say?”“If I recall correctly, and I’m not saying that I do, it said something about abreach between worlds. It said that in the event of such a breach, the warningwould be three nights of a red moon.”“Three nights. For all we know, with the clouds we’ve had, we could already havehad our three nights. What if there were clouds all the time? The warning wouldbe missed.”Zedd squinted in concentration as he tried to recall what he had read. “No...no, it said that the one to whom the warning was directed would see all threenights of the warning-all three nights of the red moon.”“What exactly is meant by such a warning? What kind of breach could there bebetween worlds?”“I wish I knew.” Zedd thumped his head of wavy white hair back against the wall.“When the boxes of Orden were opened by Darken Rahl, and the Stone of Tears cameinto this world from another, and the Keeper of the underworld was near tocoming into our world through the breach, there was never a red moon.”“Then, maybe the red moon doesn’t mean that there is a breach. Perhaps yourecall it wrongly.”“Perhaps. What I recall most vividly are my thoughts at the time. I rememberpicturing a red moon in my mind, and telling myself to remember such an image,and that if I ever saw it for real, I must remember that it was grave trouble,and I must at once search out the meaning of the sign.”Ann touched his arm, an act of compassion she had never done before. “Zedd, wealmost have Nathan. We’ll have him tonight. When we do, I’ll take the Rada’Hanfrom your neck so that you can hurry to Aydindril and see to this matter. Infact, as soon as we have Nathan, we will all go. Nathan will understand theseriousness of this, and will help. We’ll go to Aydindril with you and help.”Although Zedd didn’t like that this woman had insisted he come with her tocapture Nathan, he had come to understand how afraid she was of what couldhappen with Nathan free, and that she needed his help. At times he haddifficulty maintaining his indignation. He knew how desperate she was to keepthe prophecies from being loosed along with Nathan.Zedd knew how dangerous it could he if people were exposed to raw prophecy. Hehad been lectured since he was a boy on the dangers of prophecy, even for awizard.“Sounds like a worthwhile bargain to me; I help you get Nathan back, and you twohelp me find the meaning of the red moon.”“A bargain, then-we work together willingly. I must admit, it will be a pleasantchange of affairs.”“Is that so?” Zedd asked. “Then why don’t you take this collar off me?”“I will. Just as soon as we have Nathan.”“Nathan means more to you than you have admitted.”She was silent a moment. “He does. We have worked together for centuries. He canbe trouble on two legs, but somewhere in all that bluster, Nathan has a nobleheart.” Her voice lowered as she turned her head away. Zedd thought she wiped ahand at her eyes. “I care greatly for that incorrigible, wonderful man.” Zeddpeeked around the corner at the inn’s silent door.“I still don’t like it,” he whispered. “Something about this is wrong. I wish Iknew what it was.”“So,” she finally asked, “what are we going to do about Nathan?”“I thought you wanted to do the talking.”“Well, I guess you have convinced me that we should be careful. What do youthink we should do?”“I’ll go in there alone and ask for a room. You wait outside. If I find himbefore he leaves, I’ll surprise him and put him down. If he comes out before Ifind him, or if something... goes wrong, you seize him.”“Zedd, Nathan is a wizard; I’m only a sorceress. If he had his Rada’Han aroundhis neck I could easily control him, but he is without it.”Zedd mulled it over for a moment. They couldn’t take a chance on his gettingaway. Beyond that, Ann could be hurt. They would have a difficult time offinding Nathan again; once he knew they were onto him, he might figure out thetracer cloud and possibly unhook it. That was not likely, though.“You’re right,” he said at last. “I’ll cast a web outside the door, so that ifhe comes out it will hobble him, and then you can snap that infernal collararound his neck.”“That sounds a good idea. What sort of web will you use?”“As you’ve said yourself, we can’t fail.” He studied her eyes in the dim light.“Bags! I can’t believe I’m actually doing this,” he muttered. “Give me thecollar for a moment.”Ann searched under her cloak for the pouch at her waist. When her hand came out,the light of the red moon glinted dully off the Rada’Han. “This is the same onehe wore?” Zedd asked. “For almost a thousand years.”Zedd grunted. He took the collar in his hands and let his magic flow into thecold object of subjugation, let it mingle with the magic of the collar. He couldfeel he warm hum of the Additive Magic the collar possessed, and he could feelthe icy tingle of its Subtractive Magic.He handed back the collar. “I’ve keyed the spell to his Rada’Han.”“What spell are you going to weave” she asked in a suspicious tone. Heconsidered the resolve in her eyes. “A light spell. If he comes out withoutme... You will have twenty of his heartbeats to get that around his neck, or thelight web will ignite.”If she didn’t get the collar around his neck in time to extinguish the spell,Nathan would be consumed by it. Without the collar, there would be no escape forNathan from such a spell. With it, he would escape the spell but then therewould be no escape from her. A double bind. At that moment, Zedd didn’t muchlike himself.Ann took a deep breath. “Someone else coming out won’t trigger it, will they?”Zedd shook his head. “I will link it to the tracer cloud. The spell willrecognize him and only him by that and that alone.”His voice lowered in warning. “If you don’t get it around him in time, and itignites, then others beside Nathan will be hurt or killed if they’re closeenough. If you can’t get that around his neck for any reason, then you make sureyou get away in time. He may prefer death over having that around his neckagain."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20As he ambled in, surveying the gloomy room, Zedd realized that his heavy maroonrobes with black sleeves and cowled shoulders were out of place. The mellowlamplight showed off the three rows of silver brocade at each cuff, and thethicker gold brocade running around the neck and down the front. A red satinbelt set with a gold buckle cinched the waist of the rich robes.Zedd missed his simple robes, but they were long gone-at Adie’s insistence. Theold sorceress had chosen his new disguise; for powerful wizards, simpleaccoutrements were the equivalent of military dress. Zedd suspected she justdidn’t like his old robes, and preferred him in this.He missed Adie, and felt sorrow for the heartache she must feel at believing himdead. Nearly everyone thought he was dead. When they had time, maybe he wouldhave Ann write a message in her journey book, letting Adie know he was alive.He felt the most sorrow, though, for Richard. Richard needed him. Richard hadthe gift, and without proper instruction he was as helpless as an eaglet fallenfrom the nest. At least Richard had the Sword of Truth to help protect him, fornow. Zedd intended to go to Richard just as soon as they had Nathan. It wouldn’tbe long, and then he could hurry on his way to Richard.The innkeeper eyed Zedd’s flashy outfit, his gaze snagging on the gold beltbuckle. A collection of scraggy patrons dressed in furs, tattered leather, andragged wool watched from a few booths at the wall to the right. The two planktables sat empty on the straw-covered floor, waiting for diners, or drinkers.“Rooms are a silver,” the innkeeper said in a disinterested tone. “If you’d likecompany, it’s an extra silver.”“It would appear that my choice of outfits has turned out to be rather costly,”Zedd observed.The burly innkeeper smiled with one side of his mouth as he held out a meatyhand, palm up. “The price is the price. You want a room, or not?” Zedd dropped asingle silver in the man’s hand.“Third door on the left.” He nodded his head of curly brown hair toward the hallin the back. “Interested in company, old man?”“You’d have to share it with the lady who called. I was thinking you might beinterested in a bit more profit. A considerable bit more.”The man’s brow twitched with curiosity as he closed his fist around the silvercoin. “Meaning?”“Well, I heard a dear old friend of mine has been known to stop here. I’ve notseen him in quite a while. If he were here, tonight, and you could direct me tohis room. I’d be so overwhelmed with joy and happiness to see him again that I’dfoolishly part with a gold piece. A full gold piece.”The man looked him up and down again. “This friend of yours have a name?”“Well,” Zedd said in a low voice, “like many of your other patrons, he has aproblem with names-he can’t seem to remember them for very long, and has to keepthinking up new ones. But I can tell you that he’s tall, older, and with whitehair down to his broad shoulders.”The man stroked his tongue across the inside of his cheek. “He’s... busy at themoment.”Zedd produced the gold piece, but pulled it back when the innkeeper reached forit. “So you say. I’d like to decide for myself just how busy he is.”“Then it’s another silver.”Zedd forced himself to keep his voice down. “For what?”“For the lady’s time and company.”“I’ve no intention of availing myself of your lady.”“So you say. When you see her with him, you might have a change of mood, anddecide to try to rekindle your... youth. It’s my policy to collect the moneyfirst. If she tells me you gave her no more than a smile, then you can have thesilver back.”Zedd knew there was no chance of that. It would be his word against hers, andher word would carry the sweet ring of extra profit, if not the truth. But inthe scheme of things, the price was of no consequence, no matter how much itirked him. Zedd dug into an inner pocket and handed over the silver coin.“Last room on the right,” the innkeeper said as he turned away. He turned backto Zedd. “And we have a guest in the next room who doesn’t want to bedisturbed.”“I won’t bother your guests.”He gave Zedd a cunning grin. “Plain as she is, I offered her a littlecompanionship-no extra charge-and she told me that if anyone disturbed her rest,she’d skin me alive. A woman with enough brass to come in here alone, I believeher. I’m not giving her her silver piece back if you wake her. I’ll take it outof your hide. Understand?”Zedd nodded absently as he gave brief consideration to asking for a meal-he washungry-but reluctantly dismissed the thought.“Would you happen to have a back door, in case I... need some night air?” Zedddidn’t want Nathan slipping out the wrong door. “I’d understand if it costextra.”“We’re backed up to the blacksmith’s shop,” the innkeeper said as he walkedaway. “There’s no other door.”Last room on the right. Only one way in. One way out. Something about this waswrong. Nathan wouldn’t be so foolish. Yet Zedd could feel the air crackling withthe magic of his link.As dubious as he was that Nathan would be so conveniently bedded down for them,he moved silently down the dark hall. He listened intently for anything out ofthe ordinary, but heard only the well-practiced, feigned sounds of passion froma woman in the second room to the left.The end of the hall was lit by a single candle on a wooden bracket to the side.From the next to last room Zedd could hear the soft snores of the brassy ladywho didn’t want to be disturbed. He hoped it wouldn’t come to that, and that shewould sleep through the whole thing. Zedd put his ear close to the last door onthe right. He heard soft, throaty laughter from a woman. If this went wrong, shemight be hurt. If it went very wrong, she might be killed.He could wait, but having Nathan distracted would certainly be convenient. Theman was a wizard, after all. Zedd didn’t know how strongly Nathan felt aboutbeing captured.Zedd knew how he would feel about it. That decided him. He couldn’t afford notto take the opportunity of the distraction.Zedd threw open the door, casting a hand out, igniting the air with silent,confusing flashes of heat and light.The naked couple on the bed cringed away, covering their eyes. With a fist ofair, Zedd threw Nathan off the woman and over the far side of the bed. WithNathan grunting and flailing at the air, Zedd seized the woman’s wrist and threwher back out of the way. She snatched a sheet with her.As the flashes of light sparked out, and before she was even able to throw thesheet around herself, Zedd loosed a web, paralyzing her where she stood. Almostsimultaneously, he cast a similar web at the man behind the bed, except this webwas laced with serious consequences should he try to fend it off with magic ofhis own. This was no time to be polite, or indulgent.With hardly a sound, other than a bit of thumping onto the floor, the gloomyroom was suddenly silent. Only a single candle on a washstand flickered weakly.Zedd was relieved it had gone so well, and he hadn’t had to hurt the woman.He rounded the bottom of the bed to see the man on the floor, frozen in place,his mouth opened in the beginning of a scream, his hands clawed to defendhimself. It wasn’t Nathan.Zedd stared in disbelief. He could feel the magic of the hook in the room. Heknew this was who he had been chasing.He leaned over the man. “I know you can hear me, so listen carefully. I’m goingto release the magic holding you, but if you cry out I will put it back on andleave you like that forever. Think carefully before you dare to call for help.As you may have already surmised, I’m a wizard, and anyone who comes will not beable to do anything to save you, should you displease me.”Zedd passed his hand before the man pulling back the veil of the web. The manscooted back to the wall, but he remained silent. He was older, but not as oldas Nathan appeared. His hair was white, but wavy, rather than Nathan’s straighthair. It wasn’t as long, either, but the short description Zedd had given theinnkeeper would have been close enough for him to think this was the man Zeddsought. “Who are you?” Zedd asked. “William’s my name. You’d be Zedd.” Zeddstraightened. “How do you know that?”“The fellow you’d be looking for told me.” He gestured toward the nearby chair.“Mind if I pull on my trousers? I have a feeling I’ll not be needing them offanymore tonight.”Zedd tilted his head toward the chair, signalling for William to go ahead. “Talkwhile you do it. And keep in mind what I told you about my being a wizard. Iknow when a man is telling me a lie. Keep in mind, too, that I’m suddenly in avery foul mood.”Zedd wasn’t exactly telling the truth about being able to detect a lie, but hereasoned that the man didn’t know that. He was, however, telling the truth abouthis mood.“I ran into the man you were chasing. He didn’t tell me his name. He offeredme...” William glanced to the woman as he pulled the trousers up. “Can she hearthis?”“Don’t you worry about her. Worry abut me.” Zedd gritted his teeth. “Talk.”“Well, he offered me...” He peered at the woman. Her wrinkled face was frozen ina startled expression. “He offered me a... purse, if I’d do him a favor.”“What favor?”“Taking his place. He told me to ride like the Keeper himself was after me untilI got at least this far. He said that when I got here, I could slow, rest, orstop, whatever my choice. He told me that you’d be catching up with me.”“And he wanted that?”William buttoned his trousers, plopped back into the chair, and started pullingon his boots. “He said I wouldn’t be able to lose you, that sooner or lateryou’d catch up with me, but he didn’t want that to happen until at least after Iarrived here. Fast as I was moving, I must admit that I didn’t think you’d be soclose on my heels, so I thought to enjoy some of my profits.”William stood and stuffed an arm into his brown wool shirt. “He told me that Iwas to give you a message.”“Message? What message?”William tucked in his shirt and then reached into a trouser pocket and pulledout a leather purse. It looked to be heavy with coins. William fingered open thepurse. “It’s in here, with what he gave me.” Zedd snatched the purse from theman. “I’ll take a look.” The purse held mostly gold coins, with a few silver.Zedd felt one of the gold coins between a finger and thumb. He could feel theslight after-tingle of magic. The coins had probably started out as Coppers, andNathan had changed them to gold with magic.Zedd had been hoping that Nathan didn’t know how to do that. Changing things togold was dangerous magic. Zedd only did it himself if there was no other choice.Inside the purse, besides the coins, was a folded piece of paper. He pulled itout and turned it over in his fingers, giving it a good look in the dim light,wary of any form of magic snare that might be attached to it.William pointed. “That’s what he gave me. He told me to give it to you when youcaught me.”“Anything else? Did he tell you anything else, besides to give me this message?”“Well, as we were parting, he paused and looked up at me. He said, ‘Tell Zeddit’s not what he thinks.’“Zedd mulled this over for a moment. “Which way did he go?”“I don’t know. I was atop my horse, and he was still afoot. He told me to ride,then he slapped my horse’s rump and I rode.”Zedd tossed the purse to William. While keeping a wary eye on the man, heunfolded the paper. He squinted in the dim light of the single candle as hescanned the message.Sorry, Ann, but I have important business. One of our Sisters is going to dosomething very stupid. I must stop her, if I can. In case I die, I want you toknow I love you, but I guess you knew that. I could never say it as long as Iwas your prisoner. Zedd. if the moon rises red, as I expect it to, then we areall in mortal danger. If the moon rises red for three nights, it means Jaganghas invoked a bound fork prophecy. You must go to the Jocopo treasure. If youinstead waste precious time coming after me, we will all die, and the emperorwill have the spoils. The bound fork prophecy enforces a double bind on itsvictim. Zedd, I am sorry’, but the victim named is Richard. May the spirits havemercy on his soul. If I knew the meaning of the prophecy, / would tell you, butI don’t-the spirits have denied me access to it. Ann, go with Zedd. He will needyour help. May the good spirits be with you both.As Zedd blinked, trying to clear his watery vision, he noticed a smudge. Heturned the message over and realized that the smudge was wax residue. Themessage had been sealed, but in the poor light lie hadn’t noticed before.Zedd looked up to see William’s club. He flinched back, but felt the stunningpain of a blow. The floor crashed against his shoulder. William pounced atophim, holding a knife to his throat. “Where’s this Jocopo treasure, old man!Talk, or I’ll slit your throat!” Zedd tried to hold on to his vision as he feltthe room spinning and tilling. Nausea gagged him. He was in an instant sweat.William’s eyes were wild above him. “Talk!”The man stabbed him in the upper arm. “Talk! Where’s the treasure?” A handreached down and snatched William by the hair. It was a middle-aged woman in adark cloak. Zedd couldn’t seem to make sense of who she was, or what she wasdoing there. With surprising strength, the woman threw William back. He crashedagainst the wall beside the open door and slumped to the floor.She sneered down at Zedd. “You have made a big mistake, old man, letting Nathanget away. I suspected that following that old crone would net me the prophet, soI’ve followed you two until I could sense your link with him. Yet what do I findat the end of your magic hook but this fool here, instead of Nathan? So, now Ihave to make things unpleasant for you. I want the prophet.”She turned and cast a hand out toward the naked woman frozen in place. The roomerupted with thunder as a midnight-black discharge of lightning arced from herhand. The deathlike bolt of lightning sliced the woman and the sheet she heldcleanly in half. Blood splattered the wall. The top half of her toppled to thefloor like a statue cleaved in two. Her insides spilled across the floor as hertorso hit the ground, but her limbs remained frozen in the same pose. The womanhovering above him turned back. Her eyes were molten rage. “If you would like ataste of Subtractive Magic, one limb at a time, then just give me a reason. Now,let me see the message.”Zedd opened his hand to her. She reached out. He focused his mind through thedizziness. Before she could snatch the paper, he ignited it. It went up in abright yellow flash.With a cry of fury, she spun to William. “What did it say, you little worm!”William, until that instant rigid in panic, flung himself through the door andbolted down the hall.Her stringy hair whipped around her face as she spun back to Zedd. “I’ll be backto get answers from you. You will confess everything before I kill you.”As she lunged for the door, Zedd felt an unfamiliar composition of magic ramthrough his hasty shield. Pain erupted in his head.Trying to gather his senses, he fought through the grip of blinding agony. Hewasn’t paralyzed, but he was unable to think of how to make himself get up. Hisarms and legs battled the air as ineffectively as a turtle on its back. Thesearing pain made it difficult to do much more than maintain consciousness.He pressed his hands against the sides of his head, feeling as if it was goingto come apart and he had to hold it together. He could hear himself gasping forbreath.The sudden thud of a concussion jolted the air and briefly lifted him clear ofthe floor.A blinding flash lit the room as the roof tore open, the ripping roar ofsplintering wood and snapping beams was nearly lost in a deafening boom ofthunder. The pain extinguished. The light web had ignited.Dust billowed through the air as smoking debris rained down around him. Zedddrew into a ball and covered his head as boards and bits of rubble peppered him.It sounded like being under a kettle in a hailstorm.When silence settled over the scene, Zedd finally took his hands from his headand looked up. To his surprise, the building was still standing-after a fashion.The roof was mostly gone, letting the wind pull the dust away into the darknight above. The walls were holed like moth-eaten rags. Nearby lay the goryremains of the woman.Zedd took assessment of himself, and was surprised to find he was in remarkablygood condition, considering. Blood was running down the side of his head fromwhere William had clubbed him. and his arm was throbbing where he had beenstabbed, but other than that, he seemed uninjured. Not a bad bargain, in view ofwhat could have been, he decided.Moans drifted in from outside. A woman screamed hysterically. Zedd could hearmen throwing wreckage aside, calling out names as they searched for the injuredor dead.The door, hanging crookedly from one hinge, suddenly exploded open as someonekicked it in.Zedd sighed in relief as he saw a familiar, squat form rush in, her red faceetched with concern. “Zedd! Zedd, are you alive?”“Bags, woman, don’t you think I look alive?”Ann knelt beside him. “I think you look a mess. Your head is bleeding.” Zeddgrunted in pain as she helped him sit up. “I can’t tell you how glad I am to seeyou alive. I feared you might have been too close to the light spell when itignited.”She pawed through his blood-matted hair, inspecting the wound. “Zedd, thatwasn’t Nathan. I almost snapped the collar around that man’s neck when he raninto the spell. Then Sister Roslyn came flying out the door. She threw herselfon him, screaming something at him about a message.“Roslyn is a Sister of the Dark. She didn’t see me. My legs aren’t what theyused to be. but I ran like a girl of twelve when I saw her trying to useSubtractive Magic to undo the spell.”“I guess it didn’t work,” Zedd muttered. “I guess she never encountered a spellcast by a First Wizard. But I certainly didn’t make it that big. UsingSubtractive Magic on the light spell expanded its power. It cost innocent peopletheir lives.”“At least it cost that evil woman hers too.”“Ann, heal me, and then we have to help these people.”“Zedd, who was that man? Why did he set off the spell? Where is Nathan?” Zeddheld out his hand and opened his tightly closed fist. He let the warmth of magicflow into the ashes in his hand. The powdery black residue began clumpingtogether as the inky ashes lightened to grey. When the charred ruinsreconstituted itself into the paper it had been, it finally returned to palebrown. “I’ve never seen anyone able to do such a thing,” Ann whispered inastonishment. “Be thankful that Sister Roslyn hadn’t, either, or we would be ineven more trouble than we are. Being First Wizard has its advantages.”Ann lifted the crumpled paper from his palm. Her lower lids brimmed with tearsas she read the message from Nathan. By the time she had finished, silent tearswere running down her round cheeks. “Dear Creator,” she breathed at last.His own eyes stung with tears. “Indeed,” he whispered in response. “Zedd, whatis the Jocopo treasure?”He blinked at her. “I was hoping you would know. Why would Nathan tell us to goprotect something, and not tell us what it is?”People outside were crying in pain and calling for help. In the distance, awall, or perhaps a piece of roof, crashed to the ground. Men were yellingdirections as they dug through the rubble.“Nathan forgets that he is different from other people. Just as you recallthings from a few decades ago, he also recalls what was, except what he recallsis sometimes not a couple of decades ago, but a couple of centuries.”“I wish he would have told us more.”“We have to find it. We will find it I have a few ideas.” She shook her fingerat him. “And you are coming with me! We still haven’t got Nathan. That collarstays on for now. You’re going with me, do you understand? I’ll hear none ofyour arguing! “Zedd reached up and unsnapped the collar around his neck. Ann’s eyes went wideand her jaw dropped.Zedd tossed the Rada’Han into her lap. “We have to find this Jocopo treasurethat Nathan spoke of. Nathan is not playing games about this. This is deadlyserious. I believe what he wrote in that message. We are in a lot of trouble.I’m going with you, but this time we must be more careful. This time we mustcover our trail with magic.”“Zedd,” she finally whispered, “how did you get that collar off? It’simpossible.” Zedd scowled at her to keep himself from weeping at the thought ofthe prophecy trapping Richard. “Like I said, being First Wizard has itsadvantages.”Her face flushed crimson. “Did you just... How long have you been able to takeoff the Rada’Han?”Zedd shrugged a bony shoulder. “It took me a couple of days to figure it out.Since then. Since after the first two or three days.”“Yet you went with me? You still went with me? Why?”“I guess I like women who do things out of desperation. Shows character.” Heballed his trembling hands into fists. “Do you believe everything Nathan said inthat message?”“I wish I could say no. I’m sorry, Zedd.” Ann swallowed. “He said, ‘May thespirits have mercy on his soul,’ meaning Richard. Nathan didn’t say ‘goodspirits,’ he just said ‘spirits.’“Zedd wiped his sticklike fingers across his face. “Not all spirits are good.There are evil spirits, too. What do you know about double fork prophecies?About prophecy that enforced a double bind?”“Unlike your collar, there is no escape from one. The cataclysm named has to bebrought about to invoke the prophecy. Whatever it is, the event has alreadyhappened. Once invoked, the nature of the cataclysm is self-defining, meaningthat the victim has only the choice of one of the two forks in the prophecy. Thevictim can choose only which way he would rather... Surely you must know this?As First Wizard, you would have to know.”“I had been hoping you would tell me I was wrong,” Zedd whispered. “I wishNathan would have at least written the prophecy for us to see.”“Be thankful he didn’t.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21Clarissa gripped the weathered sill of the window in the stone tower of theabbey in an effort to control her quaking. She clutched her other hand over herthundering heart. Even with the acrid smoke burning her eyes, she had to forceherself to blink as she stood transfixed, watching the tumult in the city, andthe square below.The noise was deafening. The invaders screamed battle cries as they chargedahead, swinging swords, axes, and flails. Steel clashed and rang. The air hissedwith arrows. Horses screamed in panic. Balls of light and flame wailed in fromthe distant countryside and exploded through the stone walls. The grislyinvaders blew shrill horns and bellowed like beasts as they poured through therents in the city walls, their impossible numbers darkening the streets in asooty flood. Flames whooshed and roared and snapped.Townsmen wept unashamedly as they begged for mercy, their hands outstretched,imploring, even as they were put to the sword. Clarissa saw the bloody body ofone of the assembly of seven being dragged down the street on a rope behind ahorse.The shrill screams of women pierced through it all as their children, theirhusbands, their brothers and fathers were murdered before their eyes.The hot wind carried the jumbled smells of a burning city, pitch and wood, oiland cloth, hide and flesh, but laced through it all, in every breath she pulled,was the gagging stench of blood.It was all happening, just as he had said it would. Clarissa had laughed at him.She didn’t think she would ever be able to laugh again as long as she lived. Atthe thought of how short a time that might be, her legs nearly gave way.No. She wouldn’t think that. She was safe here. They wouldn’t violate the abbey.She could hear the throng seeking safety in the great room below weeping andcrying out in terror. This was a sacred place, devoted to the worship of theCreator and the good spirits. It would be blasphemy even for these beasts tospill blood in such a sanctuary.Yet, he had told her they would.Below, out in the streets, the army’s resistance had been crushed. The Renwolddefenders had never before let an invader set foot inside the walls. It was saidthe city was as safe as if the Creator Himself defended it. Invaders had triedbefore, and had always departed bloodied and dispirited. No horde from the wildshad ever breached the city walls. Renwold had always stood safe. This day, as hehad said it would, Renwold had fallen.For their audacity at refusing to surrender the city and its spoils peacefully,without a fight, the people of Renwold were being shown no mercy. Some had urgedsurrender, arguing that the red moons of the previous three nights had been anill omen. But those voices were few; the city had always been held safe before.The good spirits, and the Creator Himself, had turned away from the people ofRenwold this day. What their crime was, she couldn’t fathom, but, surely, itmust be terrible indeed to warrant no mercy from the good spirits.From her vantage point at the top of the abbey, she could see the people ofRenwold being herded into clusters in the streets, the market district, andcourtyards. She knew many of the people being forced at the point of steel intothe square below. The invaders, clad in foreign outfits of studded metal, andspiked leather straps and belts, and layers of hides and fur, looked to her theway she imagined savages from the wilds.The invaders began sorting through the men, pulling aside those with trades:smiths, bowyers, fletchers, bakers, brewers, butchers, millers,carpenters-anyone of a craft or trade who might be put to use. Those men werechained together, to be marched off as slaves. The very old, young boys, andthose seemingly without useful trades, like valets, yeomen, innkeepers, cityofficials, and merchants, were slaughtered on the spot-a sword hacked to theside of the neck, a spear through the chest, a knife in the gut, a flail acrossthe skull. There was no system to the slaughter.Clarissa stared as an invader clubbed the head of a man on the ground whowouldn’t seem to die. It reminded her of a fisherman, clubbing a catfish on thebank-thunk, thunk, thunk. The man doing the clubbing didn’t seem to think anymore of it than a fisherman would. Dumb Gus, the poor half-wit who ran errandsfor merchants, shopkeepers, and inns, his work paid for with food and a bed andwatered ale, kicked one last time as his thick skull gave way with a resoundingcrack.Clarissa put trembling fingers over her mouth as she felt the contents of herstomach lurch up into the back of her throat. She swallowed it back down andgasped for air.This wasn’t happening, she told herself. She was dreaming. She repeated the lieover and over in her head. This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening. Thisisn’t happening. But it was. Dear Creator, it was.Clarissa watched as the women were culled from the men. The old women weresummarily put to death. The women judged worth keeping were shoved, screamingand crying for their men, into a group. Invaders sorted through them, furtherwinnowing them according to age and, apparently, looks.Laughing invaders held the women as others of the beasts methodically went fromwoman to woman, seized them by their lower lip, and poked it through with a thinspike. A ring was pushed through each woman’s lip, its split opening efficientlyclosed with the aid of the invader’s teeth.He had told her this, too: the women would be marked into slavery. This, too,she had laughed at. And why not? He seemed to her as daft as dumb Gus,expounding his crazy, preposterous ideas and nonsense.Clarissa squinted, trying to see better It appeared that the different groups ofwomen had different-colored rings put through their lips. One group of olderwomen of every shape looked to have copper-colored rings. Another group ofyounger women screamed and fought as silver rings were put upon them. Theystopped fighting and meekly submitted after a few who fought the hardest wererun through with swords.The smallest group of the youngest, prettiest women were in the grip of thegreatest terror as they were surrounded by a gang of burly invaders. These womenreceived gold rings. Blood ran down their chins and onto their fancy dresses.Clarissa knew most of these young women. It was hard not to remember people whoregularly humiliated you. Being in her early thirties, and unmarried, Clarissawas the object of scorn among many women, but these young women were thecrudest, giving her smirking sidelong glances as they passed, referring to heras “the old maid,” or “the hag,” among themselves, but just loud enough that shecould hear them.Clarissa had never planned to be this age and without a husband. She had alwayswanted a family. She wasn’t entirely sure how life and time had rolled onwithout providing her with the opportunity for a husband.She wasn’t ugly, she didn’t think, but she knew she was no more than plain, atbest. Her figure was satisfactory; she had meat on her bones. Her face wasn’ttwisted, or shrivelled, or grotesque. Whenever she looked at her reflectionwhile passing a window at night, she didn’t think an ugly woman stared back ather. She knew it wasn’t a face that inspired ballads, but it wasn’t repulsive.Yet with more women than men to be had, being merely “not ugly” wasn’t adequate.The pretty, younger women didn’t understand; they had men in abundance courtingthem. The older women understood, and were kinder; but still she was anunfortunate in their eyes, and they feared to be overly friendly, lest theycatch the unseen, unknown taint that kept her unwed.No man would want her now; she was too old. Too old, they would fear, to givethem sons. Time had trapped her, alone and an old maid. Her work filled hertime, but it never made her happy the way she suspected a family would have.As much as the sting of those young women’s words hurt, and as much as she hadoften wished them to experience humiliation, she would never wish them this.The invaders laughed as they ripped the bodices of the fine dresses, inspectingthe young women like livestock.“Dear Creator,” she wept in prayer, “please don’t let this be because I wishedthem to feel the shame of degradation. I never wished them this. Dear Creator, Ibeg you forgive me ever wishing them ill. I didn’t want this for them, I swearon my soul.”Clarissa gasped and leaned out the little window for a better view when she sawa band of invaders running forward with a log. They disappeared beneath anoverhang below.She felt the building reverberate with a dull thud. People in the great roomscreamed. Another thud. And another, followed by splintering wood. Theunderworld’s own pandemonium broke out below. They were violating the sanctityof the Creator’s abbey. Just as the prophet had said they would.Clarissa clutched her dress over her heart in both hands as she heard theslaughter begin anew below. She shuddered uncontrollably. They would soon comeup the stairs, and find her.What was to happen to her? Was she to be marked with a ring through her lip, andcast into slavery? Would she have the courage to fight, and be killed, ratherthan submit?No. She knew the answer would be no. In the face of it, she wanted to live. Shedidn’t want to be butchered like one of the people in the square had been, orlike poor dumb Gus. She feared death more than life. She gasped as the doorbanged open.The Abbot burst into the small room. “Clarissa!” Neither young nor fit, hehuffed from running up the stairs. His portly shape could not be disguisedbeneath his dull brown robes.His round face was as ashen as a three-day-dead corpse. “Clarissa! The books,”he panted. “We must run away. Take the books with us. Take them and hide!”She blinked dumbly at him. The room of books would take days to pack, andseveral wagons to lug them away. There was nowhere to hide. There was nowhere torun. There was no way to escape through the throng of invaders. It was aludicrous command born of mad terror. “Abbot, there is no way we can escape.”He rushed to her and took her hands, he licked his lips. His eyes darted about.“They won’t notice us. Pretend we are just going about our business. They won’tquestion us.”She didn’t know how to answer such delusion, but was denied an attempt. Threemen in blood-splattered leather and hides and fur stepped through the door. Theywere so big, and the room so small, that it took them only three strides toclose the distance to the Abbot.Two had greasy, curly, matted hair. The third was shaved bald, but had a thickbeard like the other two. Each wore a gold ring through his left nostril.The one with the shiny head snatched the Abbot by his fringe of white hair andyanked his head back. The Abbot squealed. “Trade? Do you have a trade?”The Abbot, his head bent back so that he could look only at the ceiling, spreadhis hands in supplication.“I am the Abbot. A man of prayer.” He licked his lips and added in a shout, “Andbooks! I care for the books!”“Books. Where are they?”“The archives are in the athenaeum.” His head tilted back, he pointed blindly.“Clarissa knows. Clarissa can show you. She works with them. She can show you.She cares for them.”“No trade, then?”“Prayer! I’m a man of prayer! I’ll pray to the Creator, and the good spirits,for you. You’ll see. I’m a man of prayer. No donation required. I’ll pray foryou. No donation.”The man with the shaved head, his sweat-slicked muscles bulging, pulled theAbbot’s head back further and with a long knife sliced down through his throat.Clarissa felt warm blood splatter her face as the Abbot exhaled through thegaping wound.“We don’t need a man of prayer,” the invader said as he tossed the Abbot aside.Clarissa stared in wide-eyed horror as she saw blood spread under the Abbot’sbrown robes. She had known him for nearly her whole life. He had taken her inyears ago, and kept her from starving by giving her work as a scribe. He hadtaken pity on her because she could find no husband, and she had no skill,except that she could read. Not many could read, but Clarissa could read, and itprovided her with bread.That she had to endure the Abbot’s pudgy hands and slobbering lips was an onusshe had to abide if she wanted to keep her work and feed herself. It hadn’t beenthat way right from the first, but after she came to know her work and feel safein being able to meet her needs, she came to understand that she had to toleratethings she didn’t like.Long ago, when she had begged him to stop and that hadn’t worked, she hadthreatened him. He told her that she would be banished if she made suchscandalous accusations against a respected Abbot. How would a single woman,alone in the countryside, survive? he had asked. What truly terrible thingswould she suffer then?She supposed it wasn’t the worst of things. Others went hungry, and pride didn’tfill their bellies. Some women suffered worse at the hands of men. The Abbotnever struck her, at least.She had never wished him harm. She only wished him to leave her be. She neverwished him harm. He had taken her in, and given her work and food. Others gaveher only scorn.The brute with the knife stepped to her, startling her from her shock at seeingthe Abbot murdered. He slid the knife behind a belt.He gripped her chin with callused, bloodstained fingers and turned her head sideto side. He looked her up and down. He pinched her waist in evaluation. She felther face burn with humiliation at being scrutinized so. He swung to one of theothers. “Ring her.”For a moment, she didn’t understand. Her knees began trembling as one of theburly men came forward, and she realized what he had meant. She feared to cryout. She knew what they would do to her if she resisted. She didn’t want herthroat slit like the Abbot, or her head bashed in like poor dumb Gus. DearCreator, she didn’t want to die. “Which one. Captain Mallack?” The bald manlooked into her eyes. “Silver.” Silver. Not copper. Silver.A maniacal laugh cavorted through the back of her mind as the man gripped herlower lip between a thumb and knuckle. These men, these men who were experiencedat judging the worth of flesh, had just valued her more highly than her ownpeople. Even if it was as a slave, they had given her value.She clenched shut the back of her throat to hold in the scream as she felt thepick stab into the margin of her lip. He twisted the pick until it pokedthrough. She blinked, trying to see through the tears of pain.Not gold, she told herself, of course rot gold, but not copper, either. Theythought her worth a silver ring. Some part of her was disgusted at hervainglory. What else did she have, now?The man, stinking of sweat, blood, and soot, shoved the split silver ringthrough her lip. She grunted in helpless pain. He leaned in and closed the ringwith his crooked yellow teeth.She made no effort to wipe the dripping blood from her chin as Captain Mallacklooked her in the eyes again. “You are now the property of the Imperial Order.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22Clarissa thought she might faint. How could a person be the property of anyone?With shame, she realized that she had let herself be little more to the Abbot.He had been kind to her, after a fashion, but in return, he had viewed her ashis property.She knew these beasts were not going to be kind. She knew what they were goingto do with her, and it was going to be something considerably worse than theAbbot’s drunken, impotent affections. The look of steel in the man’s eyes toldher that they were men who would have no difficulty following through with whatthey wanted.At least it was silver. She didn’t know why that mattered to her, but it did.“You have books here,” Captain Mallack said. “Are there prophecies among them?”The Abbot should have kept his mouth closed, but she didn’t want to die toprotect the books. Besides, these men would tear the place apart and find themanyway; the books weren’t hidden. The city had been thought safe from invasion,after all. “Yes.”“The emperor wants all books brought to him. You will show us where they are.”Clarissa swallowed. “Of course.”“How’s it going, boys?” came an amicable voice from behind the men. “Everythingin order? You look to have matters well in hand.”The three men turned. A vigorous older man filled the doorway. A full head ofstraight white hair hung to his broad shoulders. He was wearing high boots,brown trousers, and a ruffled white shirt under an open dark green vest. The hemof his heavy, dark brown cape hovered just above the floor. A sword was sheathedin an elegant scabbard at his hip. It was the prophet.“Who are you?” Captain Mallack growled. The prophet casually flipped his capeback over a shoulder. “A man in need of a slave.” He shouldered one of the menout of his way as he strode up to Clarissa. He grasped her jaw in a big hand andturned her head this way and that. “This one will do. How much do you want forher?”The bald-headed Captain Mallack snatched a fistful of white shirt. “The slavesbelong to the Order. They are all the property of the emperor.”The prophet scowled down at the hand on his shirt. He slapped it away. “Mind theshirt, friend; your hands are dirty.”“They’re going to be bloody in a moment! Who are you? What’s your trade?” One ofthe other men put a knife to the prophet’s ribs. “Answer Captain Mallack’squestion, or die. What’s your trade?”The prophet dismissed the question with a flip of a hand. “Not one you would beinterested in. Now, how much for the slave? I can pay handsomely. You boys mightas well make something for yourselves out of it. I never begrudge a man hisprofit.”“We have all the plunder we want. It’s here for the taking.” The captain glancedto the man who had put the ring through her lip. “Kill him.”The prophet casually swept a staying hand before them. “I mean you no harm,boys.” He leaned down a little closer to their faces. “Won’t you reconsider?”Captain Mallack opened his mouth, but then he paused. No words came out.Clarissa heard distressed, liquid rumbling from the guts of the three men. Theireyes widened.“What’s wrong?” the prophet asked. “Is everything all right? Now, how about myoffer, boys? How much do you want for her?”The three men’s faces twisted with discomfort. Clarissa smelled an unpleasantodor.“Well,” Captain Mallack said in a strained voice, “I think...” He grimaced. “We,ah, we have to go.”The prophet bowed. “Why, thank you, boys. Off with you, then. Give my regards tomy friend. Emperor Jagang, won’t you?”“But what about him?” one of the men asked the captain as they edged away.“Someone else will be along shortly and kill him,” the captain said, as allthree of them shuffled bow-legged through the door.The prophet turned to her, his smile evaporating as he regarded her with ahawklike gaze.“Well, have you reconsidered my offer?”Clarissa stood quivering. She wasn’t sure who she feared more, the invaders orthe prophet. They would hurt her. She didn’t know what the prophet would do toher. He might tell her how she was to die. He had told her how a whole city wasgoing to die, and it was coming to pass. She feared that if he said something,he could make it happen. Prophets commanded magic. “Who are you?” she whispered.He bowed dramatically. “Nathan Rahl. I have already told you that I am aprophet. Forgive me for overlooking the introductions, but we don’t exactly havea great deal of time.”His penetrating blue eyes frightened her, but she made herself ask, “Why do youwant a slave?”“Well, not for the same as they.”“I don’t want-”He snatched her arm and forced her to the window. “Look out there. Look!” Forthe first time, she lost control of the tears, and they poured out in forlornsobs. “Dear Creator...”“He’s not coming to help you. No one can help those people, now. I can help you,but you have to agree to help me in return. I’ll not risk my life and lives oftens of thousands of others on you if you are of no use to me. I’ll find anotherwho would rather go with me than be a slave to these beasts.” She made herselflook into his eyes. “Will it be dangerous?”“Yes.”“Will I die helping you?”“Maybe. Maybe you’ll live. If you die, you will die doing something noble:trying to prevent suffering worse than this.”“Can’t you help them? Can’t you stop this?”“No. What is done is done. We can only strive to shape the future-we cannotalter the past.“You have an inkling of the dangers in the future. You once had a prophet livinghere, and he wrote down some of his prophecies. He was not an important prophet,but he left them here, where you fools view them as revelation of divine will.“They are not. They are simply the words of potential. The same as if I tell youthat you have it within your power to choose your destiny. You can stay and be awhore to this army, or you can risk your life doing something worthwhile.” Shetrembled under his powerful grip on her arm. “I... I’m afraid.” His azure eyessoftened. “Clarissa, would it help if I told you that I am terrified?”“You are? You seem so sure of yourself.”“I am only sure of what I can try to do to help. Now, we must go to yourarchives before these men get a look at the books.”Clarissa turned, glad for the excuse to withdraw from his gaze. “Down here. I’llshow you the way.”She led him down the spiral stone steps at the back of the room. They weren’toften used because they were so narrow and hard to negotiate. The prophet whohad constructed the abbey was a slight man, and the stairs were built to suithim. As tight as they were for her, she couldn’t imagine how this prophet couldpass down them, but he did.On the dark landing below, he lit a little flame above his palm. She paused inastonishment, wondering at why it did not burn his flesh. He urged her to hurryon. The low wooden door opened into a short hall. The stairs at the center leddown to the archives. The door at the end of the hall led to the main room ofthe abbey. Beyond that door, people were being murdered.She turned down the stairs, taking them two at a time. Nathan caught her armwhen she slipped, keeping her from a fall. He made a gentle joke about that notbeing the danger he’d warned her about.In the dark room below he cast out a hand, and the lamps hanging on woodenpilasters sprang to flame. His brow drew down as he surveyed the shelves liningthe walls of the room. Two sturdy but unexceptional tables provided a place toread and to write.While he strode to the shelves on the left, she frantically tried to think of aplace she could hide from the men of the Order. There must be some place. Surelythe invaders would leave, sooner or later, and hen she could come out and besafe.She was afraid of the prophet. He expected things of her. She didn’t know whatthose things were, but she didn’t think she had the courage to do them. She justwanted to be left alone.The prophet strode past the shelves, stopping here and there to put a fingeratop a spine and pull out a volume. He didn’t open the books he removed, buttossed them on the floor in the center of the room and went on to the next. Thebooks he pulled out all contained prophecies. He didn’t select all the books ofprophecy, by any means, but prophecies were the only ones he chose. “Why me?”she asked as she watched him. “Why do you want me?” He paused with a finger on alarge leather-bound volume. He watched her, the way a hawk watched a mouse, ashe withdrew the book. He took it to the pile of eight or ten already on thefloor, set it down, and picked up one already there. He paged through it afterhe stopped before her. “Here. Read this.”She lifted the heavy book from his hands and read where he pointed: Should shego freely, one ringed will be able to touch that long trusted into the windsalone.Long trusted into the winds alone, the very idea of such an incomprehensiblething made her want to run. “One ringed,” she said. “Does that mean me?”“If you choose to go freely.”“What if I choose to stay, and hide? Then what?”He lifted an eyebrow. “Then I will find another who wants to escape. I offeredyou the chance first for my own reasons, and because you can read. I’m surethere are others who can read. If I have to, I will find another.”“What is it ‘one ringed’ can touch?”He took the book from her tremulous hands and snapped it shut. “Don’t try tounderstand what the words mean. I know that you people try to do that, but I ama prophet, and I can tell you with a great deal of authority that such anendeavour is futile. No matter what you think, what you fear, you will bewrong.”Her resolve to leave with him weakened. Despite his seeming kindness in savingher up in the tower, the prophet frightened her. A man who knew things such ashe could know frightened her.They had put a silver ring through her lip. Not copper. Maybe that meant shewould be treated better. At least she would live. They would feed her, and shewould live. She wouldn’t have to fear some terrifying, unknown death. Shestarted when he spoke her name.“Clarissa,” he said again. “Go get some of the soldiers. Tell them that you areto lead them to the archives, down here. ““Why? Why do you want me to get them?”“Do as I say. Tell them that Captain Mallack said you were to lead them down tothe books. If you have any trouble, tell them he also said to ‘get their sorryhides down to the books right now or the dream walker would pay them a visitthey would regret.’”“But, if I go up there...”Her words trailed off in the grip of his gaze. “If you have trouble, tell themthose words, and you will be all right. Lead them down here.”She opened her mouth to ask why he wanted them to come down to the books, buthis expression changed her mind. She dashed up the stairs, glad to be away fromthe prophet, although she realized that she would have to face the brutes.She paused before the door to the great room. She could run away. She rememberedthe Abbot suggesting the same thing, and she remembered knowing how foolish theidea was. There was nowhere to run. She had a silver ring; maybe that would begood for something. These men valued her at least that much.She opened the door and took one step before the sight brought her to awide-eyed halt. The double door to the street was splintered and broken in. Thefloor was strewn with the bodies of men who had run to the abbey for shelter.The great room was packed with invaders. Among the bloody bodies of the dead,the women were being raped. Clarissa stood frozen, her mouth agape.Men stood in groups, waiting their turn. The largest groups were for the womenwith gold rings. The things being done to those women brought vomit up intoClarissa’s mouth. She covered her mouth and forced herself to swallow it.She stood transfixed, unable to turn her eyes away from a naked Manda Perlin,one of the young women who had frequently tormented her. Manda had married awealthy, middle-aged man who lent money and invested in cargos. Her husband,Rupert Perlin, lay close by, his throat so viciously cut that his head had beennearly severed from his body.Manda wailed in terror as the brutes held her down. The men roared with laughterat her wails, but they could hardly be heard above all the noise. Clarissa felther eyes water. These were not men. They were wild animals.A man snatched Clarissa by the hair. another hooked her leg with an arm. Theylaughed as her scream joined all the others. Before she landed on her back, theyhad her dress up. “No!” she cried out.They laughed at her, as the others were laughing at Manda. “No-I was sent!”“Good,” one man said. “I was tired of waiting my turn.” He smacked her when shefought off his hands. The pain of the wallop stunned her, and made her ears hum.She had a silver ring. That meant something. She had a silver ring. She heard awoman not two feet away grunt as a man flopped down on her back. Her silver ringdid her no good. either. “Mallack!” Clarissa screamed. “Captain Mallack sentme!” The man put a fist in her hair and crushed a grimy, bristly kiss to herlips. Her wound, from the ring through her lip, sang with pain and she couldfeel blood gush anew across her chin.“My thanks to Captain Mallack,” he “aid. He bit her ear, making her scream againas the other man pawed at her smallclothes. She tried desperately to rememberwhat the prophet had told her to say.“Message!” she cried out. “Captain Mallack sent me with a message! He said I’mto lead you down to the books. He said to tell you to get your sorry hides downto the books right now or the dream walker would pay you a visit you wouldregret.”The men cursed obscenely, then pulled her to her feet by her hair. She smoothedher dress down with trembling hands. The half dozen men around her laughed. Oneslid a hand back up between her legs.“Well, don’t just stand there enjoying it, bitch. Get going. Lead the way.” Herlegs had all the starch of wet rope and she had to hold the rail on the way downthe stairs. Visions of what she had seen flashed through her mind in a jumble asshe led the half dozen men down to the archives. The prophet met them at thedoor, as if he were about to leave. “There you are. About time,” the prophetsaid in an irritable voice. He gestured back to the room. “Everything is inorder. Start packing them up before anything happens, or the emperor will beusing us as firewood.”The men frowned in confusion. They glanced about the room. In the center, whereClarissa had seen the prophet stack the books he had taken from the shelves,there was only a stain of white ash. The empty places where he had pulled outbooks had been closed up, so it didn’t appear that any had been removed.“I smell smoke,” one of the men said.The prophet thunked the man’s skull. “Idiot? Half the city is ablaze. At last,you begin to smell smoke? Now, get to it! I have to report on the books Ifound.”One of them snatched Clarissa’s arm as the prophet started leading her out.“Leave her. We’ll be needing some entertainment.”The prophet glared at them. “She’s a scribe, you fool! She knows all the books.We have more important work for her than amusing you lazy oafs. There are womenenough when you finish your work, or would you rather have me report you toCaptain Mallack?”Even though they were confused by who Nathan was, they decided to get to work.Nathan closed the door behind him. He pushed Clarissa on ahead.On the steps, alone with him in the silence, she halted, leaning against therailing for support. She felt light-headed and sick to her stomach. He put hisfingers to her cheek.“Clarissa, listen to me. Slow your breathing. Think. Slow it down, or you willfaint.”Tears coursed down her face. She lifted a hand toward the room she had gone toget the men. “I... I saw...”“I know what you saw,” he said in a soft voice.She slapped him. “Why did you send me up there? You didn’t need those men!”“You think you will be able to hide You won’t. They will search every hole inthis city. When they are finished, they will burn it all to the ground. Therewill be nothing of Renwold left. ““But I... I could... I’m afraid of going with you. I don’t want to die.”“I wanted you to know what will happen to you should you choose to stay here.Clarissa, you are a lovely young woman.” He pointed with his chin toward thegreat hall. “Believe me, you do not want to be here to experience what is goingto happen to the women here over the next three days, and then as slaves to theImperial Order. Please believe me, you don’t want that.”“How can they do such things? How can they?”“This is the unspeakable reality of war. There are no rules of conduct exceptthose the aggressor makes, or those the winner can enforce. You can either fightagainst this, or submit to it.”“Can’t... can’t you do anything to help these people?”“No,” he whispered. “I can only help you, but I’m not going to waste precioustime doing it unless you are worth saving. The dead here died a quick death.Terrible as it was, it was quick.“Vast numbers of people, many times as many people as lived in this city, areabout to die horrible, suffering, lingering deaths. I can’t help these people,but I can try to help those others. Is freedom worth having, life worth living,if I don’t try?“It is time for you to decide if you will help, if your life is worth living,worth the Creator’s gift of your soul.”Visions of what was happening up in the great hall, out in the streets, and toher whole city flashed chaotically through her mind. She felt as if she werealready dead. If she could have a chance to help others, and to live again, shemust take it. This was the only chance she would get. She knew it was. She wipedthe tears from her eyes, and the blood from her chin. “Yes. I’ll help you. Iswear on my soul that I will do what you ask, if it means a chance to savelives, and a chance at my freedom.”“Even if I ask you to do something that you fear? Even if you think you will diedoing it?”“Yes.”His warm smile made her heart lift. Surprisingly, he drew her to him and gaveher a comforting hug. She had been a child the last time she had been comfortedwith a hug. It made her weep.Nathan put his fingers to her lip, and she felt a warm sensation of succor. Herterror eased. Her memories of what she had seen now gave her the determinationto stop the men who did this, to prevent them from visiting suffering on others.Her mind filled with hope that she might do something important that would helpother people to be free, too.Clarissa felt her lip after Nathan had taken his hand away. It no longerthrobbed. The wound was healed around the ring. “Thank you-Prophet.”“Nathan.” He ran a hand down her hair. “We must go. The longer we stay here, thegreater the chance of never getting away.” Clarissa nodded. “I’m ready.”“Not yet.” He cupped his big hands to her cheeks. “We must walk through thecity, through it all, to get away. You have seen too much already. I don’t wantyou to see any more, or hear any more. I would spare you that much, at least.”“But I don’t see how we can ever get past the Order.”“You let me worry about that. For now, I am going to put a spell over you. Youwill be blind, so that you don’t have to see any more of what is happening toyour city, and you will be deaf, so that you don’t have to hear any more of thesuffering and death that now possesses this place.”She suspected that he feared she might panic and get them caught. She didn’tknow that he might not be right. “If you say so, Nathan. I will do as you say.”Standing there in the dim light, two steps below her so that his face was closerto hers, he gave her a warm smile. For as old as he was, he was a strikinglyhandsome man.“I have chosen the right woman. You will do well. I pray the good spirits grantyou freedom in return for your help.”Holding his hand as they walked was her only connection to the world. Shecouldn’t see the slaughter. She couldn’t hear the screams. She couldn’t smellthe fires. Yet she knew that those things had to be happening around her.In her silent world, she prayed as she walked, prayed that the good spiritswould keep safe the souls of those who had died here this day, and for those whostill lived she prayed for the good spirits to give them strength.He guided her around rubble, and around the heat of fires. He held her handtight when she stumbled over debris. It seemed they walked for hours through theruins of the vast city.Occasionally they stopped, and she lost the connection to his hand as she stoodstill and alone in her silent world. She could neither see nor hear, so shedidn’t know the exact reason for the stop, but she suspected that Nathan washaving to talk their way out. Sometimes those stops dragged on and on, and herheart raced at the thought of what unseen danger Nathan warded. Sometimes, thestop was followed by his arm around her waist pulling her into a run. She feltconfident in his care, and comfort, too.Her hip sockets ached from walking, and her weary feet throbbed. He at lastplaced both hands on her shoulders, turned her, and helped her sit. She feltcool grass under her.Her vision suddenly returned, along with her hearing and sense of smell. Rollinggreen hills spread away before her. She looked around and saw only countryside.There were no people anywhere. The city of Renwold was nowhere to be seen.She dared to feel the budding of sweet relief, not only at having escaped theslaughter but at having escaped her old life.The terror had burned so deep into her soul that she felt as if she had beenrecast in a furnace of fear, and had come out a shiny new ingot, hardened forwhat lay ahead.Whatever she had to face, it could be no worse than what she would have facedhad she stayed. If she had chosen to stay, it would have been a turning awayfrom helping others, and from herself.She didn’t know what he was going to ask her to do, but every day of freedom shehad was one she wouldn’t otherwise have had if not for the prophet. “Thank you,Nathan, for choosing me.” He was staring off in thought, and didn’t seem to hearher."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23Sister Verna turned to the commotion and saw a scout leaping from his latheredhorse before it had skidded to a stop in the near darkness. The scout panted,trying to catch his breath, at the same time as he relayed his report to thegeneral. The general’s tense posture visibly relaxed at the report. He gesturedin a jaunty fashion for his officers to stand down their concern, too.She couldn’t hear the scout’s report, but she knew what it would be. She didn’thave to be a prophet to know what the scout would have seen. The fools. She hadtold him as much.The smiling General Reibisch approached her, his heavy eyebrows arched with hisgood humor. When he came into the ring of firelight, his greyish-green eyessearched her out. “Prelate! There you are. Good news!”Verna, her mind on other, more important matters, loosened the shawl around hershoulders.“Don’t tell me, general; my Sisters and I won’t have to spend the whole nightcalming nervous soldiers and casting spells to tell you where panicked men haverun off to hide while they await the end of the world.”He scratched his rust-colored beard. “Ah, well, I do appreciate your help.Prelate, but no, you won’t. You’re right, as usual.” She snorted anI-told-you-so.The scout had been watching from atop the hill, and from there could see themoonrise before any of them down in the valley.“My man said that the moon didn’t rise red, tonight. I know you told me itwouldn’t, and that three nights of it was all there would be, but I can’t helpbeing relieved to know things are back to normal. Prelate.” Back to normal.Hardly.“I’m glad, general, that we will all get a good night’s sleep for a change. Ihope, too, that your men have learned a lesson, and that in the future, when Itell them that the underworld isn’t about to swallow us all, they will have alittle more faith.”He smiled sheepishly. “Yes, Prelate. I believed you, of course, but some ofthese men are more superstitious than is healthy for their hearts. Magic scaresthem.” She leaned a little closer to the man and lowered her voice. “It should.”He cleared his throat. “Yes, Prelate. Well, I guess we better all get somesleep.”“Your messengers haven’t returned yet, have they?”“No.” He traced a finger down the lower part of the white scar running from hisleft temple to his jaw. “I don’t expect they’ve even reached Aydindril yet.”Verna sighed. She wished she could have heard word first. It might have made herdecision easier. “I suppose not.”“What do you think. Prelate? What’s your advice? North?” She stared off,watching the sparks from the fire spiral up into the darkness, and feeling itsheat on her face. She had more important decisions to make.“I don’t know. Richard’s exact words to me were, ‘Head north. There’s an army ofa hundred thousand D’Haran soldiers heading south looking for Kahlan. You’llhave more protection with them, and they with you. Tell General Reibisch thatshe is safe with me.”“It would have made things easier if he would have said for sure.”“He didn’t say for us to go north, back to Aydindril, but it was implied. I’msure he thought that’s what we would do. However, I take seriously your advicein matters such as this.”He shrugged. “I’m a soldier. I think like a soldier.”Richard had gone to Tanimura to rescue Kahlan, and had managed to destroy thePalace of the Prophets, along with its vault of prophecies, before EmperorJagang could capture it. Richard had said that he had to return to Aydindril atonce, and that he didn’t have time to explain, but only he and Kahlan had themagic required that would allow their immediate return. He said he couldn’t takethe rest of them. He had told her to go north to meet up with General Reibischand his D’Haran army.General Reibisch was reluctant to return north. He reasoned that with a forcethis large already this far south, it would be strategically advantageous toblunt an invasion of the New World before it could drive into the populousareas.“General, I have no argument with your motives, but I fear that youunderestimate the threat. From the information I’ve managed to gather, theImperial Order’s forces are large enough to crush even an army of this sizewithout losing stride. I don’t doubt your men’s ability, but by sheer numbersalone the Order will swallow you whole.“I understand your reasoning, but even with as many men as you have, it won’t beenough, and then we wouldn’t have them to lend their weight to a gathering of alarger force that might have a chance against the Order.”The general smiled reassuringly. “Prelate, what you say makes sense. I’velistened to reasoned arguments like yours my whole career. The thing is, warisn’t a reasonable pursuit. Sometimes, you simply have to take advantage of whatthe good spirits give you and throw yourself into the fray.”“Sounds like a good way to be annihilated.”“Well, I’ve been doing it a long tine, and I’m still alive. Just because youchoose to meet the enemy, that doesn’t mean you have to stick your chin out andlet him have a good swing at it.” Verna squinted at the man. “What have you inmind?”“Seems to me that we’re already here. Messengers can move a great deal fasterthan an army. I think we should move to a more secure location, one moredefendable, and sit tight.”“Where?”“If we go east, into the high country of southern D’Hara, then we could be in abetter position to react. I know the country there. If the Order tries to comeup into the New World through D’Hara, the easy way through the Kern Rivervalley, then we are there to stop them. We can fight on more equal terms intighter country like that. Just because you have more men, that doesn’t mean youcan use them all. A valley is only so wide.”“What if they go more to the west as they move north, skirt the mountains andhead up through the wilds?”“Then we have this army to sweep in behind them when our other forces are sentsouth to meet them. The enemy would have to split their force and fight againstus on two fronts. On top of that, it would limit their options by making itdifficult for them to move freely.”Verna considered his words. She had read of battles in the old books, andunderstood the sense of his strategy. It seemed more prudent than she hadthought at first. The man was bold, but he was no fool.“With our troops in a strategic location,” he went on, “we can send messengersto Aydindril and the People’s Palace in D’Hara. We can get reinforcements fromD’Hara, and from the lands of the Midlands that join with us, and Lord Rahl cansend us his instructions. If the Order invades, well, then, we’re already hereto know about it. Information is a valuable commodity in war.”“Richard may not like it that you hunker down here, instead of returning toprotect Aydindril.”“Lord Rahl is a reasonable man-”Verna interrupted with a guffaw. “Richard, reasonable? Now you stretch mycredulity, general.”He frowned at her. “As I was saying, Lord Rahl is a reasonable man. He told methat he wants me to speak up with my advice, when I think it important. I thinkit’s important. He considers my advice on matters of war. The messengers arealready on their way with my letter. If he doesn’t like my advice, then he cansay so and order me north and I will go; but until I know for sure that hewishes it, I think we should do our job and defend the New World from theImperial Order.“I asked your advice. Prelate, because you command magic. I don’t know anythingabout magic. If you or the Sisters of the Light have something to say that wouldbe important to us in our struggle, then I’m listening. We’re on the same side,you know.”Verna relented. “Forgive me, general I guess I sometimes forget that.” Sheoffered him a smile. “The last few months have turned my life upside down.”“Lord Rahl has turned the whole world upside down. He has reordered everything.”She smiled to herself. “That he has.” She looked back at the general’sgreen-green eyes. “Your plan makes sense-at the very worst it would slow theOrder, but I’d like to talk to Warren first. He... he sometimes has surprisinginsights. Wizards are like that.”The general nodded. “Magic is not my part. We have Lord Rahl for that. And you,too, of course.”Verna repressed a laugh at the idea of Richard being the one to wield magic forthem. The boy could hardly get out of his own way where magic was concerned.No, that wasn’t entirely true; Richard often did surprising things with hisgift. The problem was that it usually surprised him, too. Still, he was a warwizard, the only to be born in the last three thousand years, and all theirhopes hung on his leadership in this war against the Imperial Order.Richard’s heart, and his determination, were in the right place. He would do hisbest. It was up to the rest of them to help him, and to keep him alive. Thegeneral shifted his weight and scratched under his chain-mail sleeve. “Prelate,the Order claims to want to end magic in this world, but we all know that theyuse magic in their attempt to crush us.”“That they do.”She knew Emperor Jagang had most of the Sisters of the Dark at his beck andcall. He had young wizards to do his bidding, too. He had also captured a numberof the Sisters of the Light, and dominated them through his ability as a dreamwalker. It was this that nettled her conscience; as Prelate, it was ultimatelyup to her to see to the safety of the Sisters of the Light. Some of her Sisterswere anything but safe in the hands of Jagang.“Well, Prelate, seeing as how their troops are likely to be accompanied by thosewith magic. I’m wondering if I can count on you and your Sisters to be thecounter to them. Lord Rahl said: ‘You’ll have more protection with them, andthey with you.’ That sounds to me like he intended you to use your magic to helpus against the Order’s army.”Verna would like to think the general wrong. She would like to think thatSisters of the Light, those charged with doing the Creator’s work, would beabove bringing harm to anyone.“General Reibisch, I don’t like it; however, I’m afraid that I concur. If welose this war, we all lose, not simply our troops on the field of battle; allfree people will be slaves to the Order. If Jagang wins, the Sisters of theLight will be executed. We all must fight or die.“The Order would not want to fall into your plans so conveniently. They may tryto sneak past undetected-farther to the west, possibly even to the east of you.The Sisters can be of use in detecting the movements of the enemy, should theyadvance into the New World and try to slip past you.“If those with magic mask the Order’s movements from you, our Sisters will knowit. We will be your eyes. If fighting comes, the enemy will use magic to try todefeat you. We will have to use our power to thwart that magic.”The general considered the flames for a moment. He glanced off toward the menbedding down for the night.“Thank you. Prelate. I know that decision can’t be easy for you. Since you’veall been with us, I’ve come to know the Sisters as gentle women.”Verna barked a laugh. “General, you have not come to know us at all. The Sistersof the Light are many things, but gentle is not one of them.” She flicked herwrist. Her dacra sprang into her hand. A dacra resembled a knife but had asharpened rod instead of a blade.Verna twirled the dacra. “I have had to kill men before.” Reflected flashes offirelight sparkled and danced as she spur the weapon with graceful ease, walkingit over her knuckles and back. “I can assure you, general, I was anything butgentle.”He lifted an eyebrow. “A knife in talented hands, such as yours, is trouble, butit’s hardly a match for the weapons of war.”She smiled politely. “This is a weapon possessing deadly magic. If you see oneof these coming for you, run. It only must penetrate your flesh-even if it’syour little finger-and you will be dead before you can blink.”He straightened, and his chest grew with a deep breath. “Thanks for the warning.And thanks for your help. Prelate. I’m glad to have you on our side.”“I regret that Jagang has some of our Sisters of the Light under his control.They can do the same as I, maybe more.” She gave him a reassuring pat on theshoulder when she saw that his face had paled. “Good night, General Reibisch.Sleep well-the red moons are gone.”Verna watched the general make a zigzag course through his officers, speakingwith them, checking on his men, and issuing orders. After he had disappearedinto the darkness, she turned to her tent.Deep in thought, she idly cast her Han and lit the candles inside the smallfield tent the men had provided for her use. With the moon up, Annalina-the realPrelate-would be waiting.Verna pried the little journey book from its secret pouch in her belt. Journeybooks had magic that allowed a message written in one to appear simultaneouslyin its twin. Prelate Annalina had the twin to Verna’s. She sat cross-legged onher blankets and opened the book in her lap.There was a message waiting. Verna pulled a candle closer and bent in the dimlight to better see the writing in the journey book.Verna, we have trouble here. We finally caught up with Nathan, at least who wethought was Nathan. The man we had been pursuing turned out not to be Nathan.Nathan tricked us. He is gone, and we don’t know where he went.Verna sighed. She had thought it had sounded too good to be true when Ann toldher that they were closing in on the prophet.Nathan left us a message. The message is more trouble than the thought of Nathanbeing on the loose. He said that he had important business-that one of “ourSisters” was going to do something very stupid, and that he must stop her if hecould. We have no idea where he went. He also confirmed what you told me Warrensaid, that the red moon means Jagang has invoked a bound fork prophecy. Nathansaid that Zedd and I must go to the Jocopo treasure, and that if we wasted timegoing after him instead, we would all die.I believe him. Verna, we must talk. If you are there, reply. I will be waiting.Verna pulled the stylus from the spine of the journey book. Moonrise was thetime they had agreed upon to communicate through the journey books if theyneeded to. She bent closer and wrote in her book: / am here, Ann. What happened?Are you all right? In a moment, words began appearing in the book.It’s a long story, and I don’t have time for it now, but Sister Roslyn washunting Nathan, too. She was killed, along with at least eighteen innocentpeople. We can’t be sure of the true number consumed in the light spell.Verna’s eyes widened at hearing that people were killed so. She wanted to askwhat they were doing casting such a dangerous web, but decided not to ask as sheread on.First of all, Verna, we need to know if you have any idea what the “Jocopotreasure “ is. Nathan didn’t explain.Verna put a finger to her lips as she squeezed her eyes closed, trying toremember. She had heard the name before. She had been on her journey to the NewWorld for twenty years, and she had heard of it there.Ann, I think I recall hearing that the Jocopo were a people living somewhere inthe wilds. If I recall correctly, they are all dead-exterminated in a war. Ibelieve all traces of them were destroyed.The wilds, you say. Verna, are you sure it was the wilds? Yes. Wait a momentwhile I tell Zedd this news.The minutes dragged by as Verna watched the blank place at the end of thewriting. At last, words began to appear.Zedd has succumbed to a bout of loud cursing and arm flailing. He is swearingoaths about what he intends to do to Nathan. I am quite sure that he will findmost of his intentions to be physically impossible. The Creator is humbling mefor complaining to him that Nathan was incorrigible. I think I am being taught alesson as to the true meaning of incorrigible.Verna, the wilds are a big place. Any idea where in the wilds? No. Sorry. I onlyrecall hearing the Jocopo mentioned once. Somewhere in southern Kelton I onceadmired a pottery relic in a shop of curiosities. It was purported by theproprietor to have been made by a disappeared culture from the wilds. He calledthem the Jocopo. That’s all I know. I was hunting Richard at the time, notvanished cultures. I will check with Warren. He might know something from thebooks.Thank you, Verna. If you find anything, send word at once. Now, do you have anyidea what stupid thing it is that Nathan thinks a Sister is going to do?No. We are all here with the D’Haran army. General Reibisch wants to stay to thesouth so as to thwart the Order should they invade. We await word from Richard.But there are Sisters of the Light being held captive by Jagang. Who can tellwhat he will make them do?Ann, did Nathan say anything of the bound fork prophecy? Warren might be able tohelp if you would tell me the words of the prophecy. There was a pause beforeAnn’s writing began again.Nathan didn’t tell us the words. He said that the spirits denied him access toits meaning. He did say, though, that the victim of the double bind in theprophecy is Richard.Verna gasped in some saliva. She coughed violently trying to get it back out ofher lungs. Her eyes watering as she coughed, she held the book up and read thelast message again. She finally got her lungs and throat clear. Ann, you wrote“Richard.” Did you really mean Richard? Yes.Verna closed her eyes with a whispered prayer, fighting down the flutter ofpanic. Anything else? Verna wrote.Not for now. Your information about the Jocopo will help. We will be able tonarrow our search now, and know the questions to ask. Thank you. If you learnmore, let me know. I had better go. Zedd is complaining of life-threateninghunger. Ann, is everything all right with you and the First Wizard? Ducky. Hehas his collar off.You took off his collar? Before you find Nathan? Why would you do such a thing?I didn’t. He did.Verna’s eyes widened at this news. She feared to ask how he could accomplishsuch a thing, so she didn’t. Verna thought she could read in Ann’s message thatit was a sore subject. And yet he is going with you?Verna, I am not quite sure who is going with whom, but for now we bothunderstand the dire nature of Nathan’s warning. Nathan isn’t always irrational.I know. No doubt that old man is right now smiling at a woman, trying to makeher swoon and fall into his bed. Verna wrote. May the Creator hold you safely inhis care. Prelate.Ann was really the Prelate, but had named Verna Prelate when she and Nathan hadfaked their deaths and gone on an important mission. For now, everyone thoughtAnn and Nathan dead, and that Verna was the Prelate.Thank you, Verna. One other thing. Zedd is concerned for Adie. He wishes you totake her aside and let her know that he is alive and well, but “in the hands ofa crazy woman. “Ann, do you wish me to tell the Sisters that you are alive and well? The messagetook a moment to resume.No, Verna. Not just now. It helps you, and them, that they have you as Prelate.With what Nathan has told us, and what we must do, it would be inadvisable totell them that I live, only to have to turn around and tell them that I am dead,after all. Verna understood. The wilds were a dangerous place. That was whereVerna had had to kill people. And she hadn’t been trying to get information outof them; she had been trying to avoid contact with people there. Verna had beenyoung and fast at the time. Ann was nearly as old as Nathan. But she was asorceress, and she did have a wizard with her. While Zedd was not young, either,he was far from helpless. The fact that he had managed to remove his Rada’Hanspoke volumes about his ability.Ann, don’t say that. You be careful. You and Zedd must protect each other. Weall need you back.Thank you, child. Take care of the Sisters of the Light, Prelate. Who knows, Imay want them back, someday.Verna smiled at the comfort of consulting with Ann, and at her humor in direcircumstance. Verna wished she had a sense of humor like Ann. The smile fadedwhen she remembered that Ann had told her that Richard was the victim named inthe deadly prophecy.She thought about what Nathan had warmed, that one of the Sisters was going todo something stupid. She wished that Nathan had been more specific. He couldmean almost anything by “stupid.” Verna wouldn’t be inclined to believe justanything Nathan said, but Ann knew him much better than did Verna.She thought about the Sisters Jagang was holding. Some were Sisters of theLight, and a few were Verna’s dear friends and had been since they were novices.The five of them-Christabel, Amelia, Janet, Phoebe, and Verna-had grown uptogether at the palace.Of those, Verna had named Phoebe one of her administrators. Only Phoebe was withthem, now. Christabel, Verna’s dearest friend, had turned to the Keeper of theUnderworld; she had become a Sister of the Dark, and had been captured byJagang. The last two of Verna’s friends, Amelia and Janet, had been taken byJagang, too. Janet had remained loyal to the Light, Verna knew, but she wasn’tsure about Amelia. If she was still loyal . ..Verna pressed trembling fingers to her lips at the thought of her two friends,two Sisters of the Light, being slaves to the dream walker. In the end, thatdecided her.Verna peeked into Warren’s tent. Unbidden, a smile came to her lips when she sawhis shape on his blankets in the darkness, probably pondering some youngprophet’s thoughts. She smiled at how much she loved him, and at knowing howmuch he loved her.Verna and Warren, having both grown up at the Palace of the Prophets, had knowneach other nearly their whole lives. Her gift as a sorceress was destined to beused to help train young wizards, while his gift as a wizard destined him towardprophecy.Their paths didn’t cross in a serious way until after Verna returned to thepalace with Richard. Because of Richard and his huge impact on life at thepalace, events brought Verna and Warren together, and their friendship grew.After Verna was named Prelate, during their struggle against the Sisters of theDark, she and Warren had depended on each other for their very lives. It wasduring that struggle that they had become more than friends. After all thoseyears in the palace, only now had they really found each other, and found love.At the thought of what she had to tell him, her smile faded. “Warren,” shewhispered, “are you awake?”“Yes,” came a quiet reply.Before he could have a chance to rise and take her into his arms and she losther nerve, she stepped into his tent and blurted it out.“Warren, I’ve made my decision. I’ll have no argument from you. Do youunderstand? This is too important.” He was silent, so she went on. “Amelia andJanet are my friends. Besides being Sisters of the Light in enemy hands, I lovethem. They would do the same for me, I know they would. I’m going after them,and any others I can rescue.”“I know,” he whispered.He knew. What did that mean? Silence dragged on in the darkness. Verna frowned.It wasn’t like Warren not to argue about such a thing. She had been ready forhis argument, but not his calm acceptance.Using her Han, the force of life and spirit through which the magic of the giftworked, Verna lit a flame in her palm arid passed it to a candle. He was huddledon his blanket, his knees pulled up and his head resting in his hands. She kneltdown before him. “Warren? What’s wrong?” His face came up. His blue eyes wererimmed with red. His face was sickly pale. Verna clutched his arm. “Warren, youdon’t look well. What’s wrong?”“Verna,” he whispered, “I have come to realize that being a prophet is not thewonder I had imagined.”Warren was the same age as Verna, but looked younger because he had remained atthe Palace of the Prophets, under its spell that retarded aging, while she wenton her twenty-odd-year journey to find Richard. Warren didn’t look so young atthe moment.Warren had only recently had his first vision as a prophet. He had told her thatthe prophecy came as a vision of events, accompanied by words of the prophecy.The words were what were written down, but it was the vision that was the trueprophecy. That was why it took a prophet to truly understand the meaning of thewords; they invoked the vision that was being passed on from another prophet.Hardly anyone knew this; everyone tried to understand prophecy by the words.Verna now knew, from what Warren had told her, that this method was inadequateat best and dangerous at worst. Prophecy was meant to be read by other prophets.She frowned. “Have you had a vision? Another prophecy?” Warren ignored thequestion, and asked one of his own. “Verna, do we have any Rada’Han with us?”“The collars around the young men who escaped with us are the only ones. Wedidn’t have time to bring any extras. Why?” He put his head back in his hands.Verna shook a finger at him. “Warren, if this is some trick to try to get me tostay here with you, it won’t work. Do you hear me? It won’t work. I’m going, andI’m going alone. That’s final.”“Verna,” he whispered, “I have to go with you.”“No. It’s too dangerous. I love you too much. I won’t risk anyone else. If Ihave to, I will order you, as Prelate, to stay here. I will. Warren.” His headrose again. “Verna, I’m dying.” Icy goose bumps tingled across her aims andthighs. “What? Warren-”“I’m having the headaches. The headaches from the gift.” Verna was choked silentwith the realization of the deadly nature of what he had just said.The whole reason the Sisters of the Light took boys born with the gift was tosave their lives. Unless schooled, the gift could kill him. The headaches were amanifestation of the fatal nature of the gift going awry. Besides providing theSisters with control over the young wizards, the most important function of thecollar was its magic, which protected the life of the boy until he could learnto control his gift.Because of all that had happened, Verna had taken Warren’s collar off longbefore it was customary.“But, Warren, you’ve studied a long lime. You know how to control your gift. Youshouldn’t need the Rada’Han for protection any longer.”“If I was an ordinary wizard, that may be true, but my gift is for prophecy.Nathan was the only prophet at the palace in centuries. We don’t know how themagic works in a prophet. I only recently had my first prophecy. It signifies anew level of my ability. Now, I’m having the headaches.”Verna was suddenly in a panic. Her eyes were tearing. She threw her arms aroundhim.“Warren, I’ll stay. I won’t go. I’ll help you. We’ll do something. Maybe wecould take a collar off one of the boys and you could share it. That might work.We’ll try that first.”His arms pulled her tight. “That won’t work, Verna.”A sudden thought flashed into her mind, making her gasp with relief. It was sosimple.“Warren, it’s all right. It is. I just realized what we can do. Listen to me.”“Verna, I know what-”She shushed him. She held him by the shoulders and looked into his blue eyes.She brushed back his wavy blond hair. “Warren, listen. It’s simple. The reasonthe Sisters were founded was to help boys born with the gift. We were givenRada’Han to protect them while we teach them to control their gift.”“Verna, I know all that, but-”“Listen. We have the collars to help them because we don’t have wizards who cando what is needed. In the past, greedy wizards refused to help those born withthe gift. An experienced wizard can join with your mind and pass on theprotection- show you how to put the gift right. It’s simple for a wizard to do,but not a sorceress. We need only to visit a wizard.”Verna pried the journey book from her belt and held it before his eyes. “We havea wizard-Zedd. All we have to do is talk to Ann, and have her and Zedd meet us.Zedd can help you, and then you’ll be all right.” Warren stared into her eyes.“Verna. it won’t work.”“Don’t say that. You don’t know. You don’t know. Warren.”“Yes I do. I have had another prophecy.” Verna sat back on her heels. “You have?What was it?” Warren pressed his fingertips to his temples. She could see thathe was in pain. She knew that the pain of the headaches from the gift wereexcruciating. In the end, if not corrected, they were fatal.“Verna, now you listen to me for a change. I have had a prophecy. The wordsaren’t important. The meaning is.” He; took his hands away from his head andlooked her in the eye. In that moment, he looked very old to her. “You must dowhat you plan, and go after the Sisters. The prophecy didn’t say whether youwill succeed, but I must go with you. If I do anything else, I will die. It’s aforked prophecy-an ‘either-or’ prophecy.”She cleared her throat. “But... surely, there must be something...”“No. If I stay, or if I try to go to Zedd, I will die. The prophecy doesn’t saythat if I go with you I will live, but it does say that going with you is myonly chance. End of discussion. If you make me stay, I will die. If you try totake me to Zedd, I will die. If you want me to have a chance to live, then youmust take me with you. Choose, Prelate.”Verna swallowed. As a Sister of the Light, a sorceress, she could tell by thedistinctive murky cast to his eyes that he was in the pain of a headache fromthe gift. She also knew that Warren would not lie to her about a prophecy. Hemight pull some trick to go with her, but he would not lie about a prophecy. Hewas a prophet. Prophecy was his life. Maybe his death. She took his hand up inhers. “Get some supplies together. Get two horses. I have to go tell Adiesomething, and then I must talk to my advisors, let them know what to do whilewe’re gone.”Verna kissed his hand. “I won’t let you die. Warren. I love you too much. We’lldo this together. I’m not sleepy. Let’s not wait till morning. We can be on ourway in an hour.” Warren drew her to him in a thankful embrace."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24From the solace of the shadows, he watched as the middle-aged man closed thedoor and stood in the dim hall a moment to tuck in his shirt over his potbelly.The man chortled to himself and then thumped off down the hall to disappear ashe descended the stairs.It was late. It would be several hours yet before the sun was up. With the wallspainted red, the candles set before silvered reflectors at either end of thenarrow hall were able to provide precious little useful light. He liked it thatway-the way the comforting cloak of shadows in the pit of the night lent itsmood to such nefarious needs.Debauchery was best indulged in the right. In the darkness. He stood awhile inthe quiet obscurity of the hall, savoring his desire. It had been too long. Helet his lust have rein, and felt its glorious, wanton ache fill him.He closed his mouth and breathed through his nose to better experience the rangeof aromas, both transcendent and abiding He put his shoulders back and used hisabdominal muscles to draw slower, deeper breaths.He counted a variety of scents, from the smells men carried in and took awaywith them back to their own lives, the smells of their work-horse, clay, graindust, the lanolin soldiers used in the care of leather uniforms, and the oilthey used for sharpening their weapons, to a redolent wisp of almond oil, andthe stale dirt and wet wood of the building.It was an afferent feast that was only just beginning.He glanced the length of the hall again, checking. He heard no sounds of lustcoming from any of the other rooms. It was late, even for an establishment likethis. The fat, potbellied man was probably the last of them, except for himself.He liked to be last. The evidence of the events before he arrived, and thelingering smells, gave him a rush of sensation. Hi? senses were alwaysheightened in his aroused state, and he valued all the details.He closed his eyes for a moment, feeling the throbbing of his need. She wouldhelp him. She would sate his desire; that was what they were here for. Theyoffered themselves willingly.Other men, like the potbellied man, simply threw themselves on a woman, gruntedin a moment of satisfaction, and it was over. They never gave thought to whatthe woman was feeling, to what she needed, to giving her satisfaction. Those menwere no more than rutting beasts, ignorant of all the details that could add tothe climax for both. Their mind’s eye was too focused on the object of theirlust; they didn’t see the integral parts of the wider setting that led to truesatisfaction.It was the fleeting, the ephemeral, that created a transcendent experience.Through uncommon perception, and his singular awareness, he could net suchevanescent events and commemorate them forever in his memory, thus giving thetransient nature of satisfaction permanence.He felt fortunate that he could see such things, and that he, at least, couldbring fulfilment to women.At last, he took a settling breath and then advanced silently down the hall,marking the way the shadows and tiny lays of light mirrored off the silveredcandle reflectors slipped across his body. He thought that if he was mindful, hemight someday be able to feel the touch of the light, and of the dark.Without knocking, he opened the door the potbellied man had come from andstepped into her room, gratified to see that it was nearly as dim as the hall.With a finger, he shut the door.Behind the door, the woman was just pulling her panties up her legs. She spreadher knees and squatted a bit, drawing them up tight against herself. When hersky-blue eyes finally turned up to look at him, her only reaction was to tossthe sides of her robe together over the rest of her bare body and casually flipthe silk belt together into a loose knot.The air carried the odor of the hot coals in the warming pan under the bed, theweak but clean aroma of soap, the light fragrance of body powder, and thecloying scent of a sickly sweet perfume. But pervading it all, like the darknessthat shaped shadows, was the lingering smack of lust, pointed with the arrestingscent of semen.The room had no windows. The bed, covered with stained, rumpled sheets, waspushed into the far corner. Even though it wasn’t large, the bed took up a goodpart of the room. Against the wall, beside the head of the bed, sat a small,simply made pine chest, probably for personal items. On the wall over the headof the bed hung an ink drawing of two people coupled in passion. It left nothingto the imagination.A washbasin sat centered on a wobbly-looking cabinet beside her, behind thedoor. In its edge, the white washbasin had a stained, kidney-shaped chip, with acrack that looked like an artery coming from the kidney. The cloth hanging overthe side of the basin still dripped. The milky water in the basin gently sloshedfrom side to side. She had just washed herself.They each had their own habits. Some didn’t bother to wash, but they wereusually the older, unattractive ones who were paid little, and cared little. Hehad noticed that the younger, prettier, more expensive women washed after eachman. He preferred the ones who washed before he came to them, but in the end,his lust overrode such trivial matters.He idly wondered if those he had been with who were not professionals ever gavethought to such things. Probably not. He doubted that others pondered suchcurious particulars. Others gave little thought to the texture of details.Other women, women looking for love, satisfied him, but not in the same way.They always wanted to talk, and to be wooed. They wanted. He wanted. In the end,his want overrode what he would prefer, and he gave them some of what theywanted before his needs could be satisfied.“I thought I was finished for the night,” she said. Her words came out silkysmooth, with a pleasant, pert lilt, but bore no real interest at the prospect ofanother man this late.“I think I’m the last,” he said, trying to sound apologetic so as not to angerher. It wasn’t as satisfying if they were angry. He liked nothing more than whenthey were eager to please. She sighed. “All right, then.”She showed no fear at having a man simply walk into her room without knocking,even though she was hardly wearing anything, nor did she make any demands formoney. Silas Latherton, downstairs, with his cudgel and a long knife in hisbelt, made sure the women had nothing to fear. He also didn’t let anyone go upthe stairs unless they paid in advance, so the women didn’t have to be botheredwith the trouble of collecting money. It insured that he, rather than they, keptcontrol of the income, and its distribution.Her short, straight blond hair was dishevelled, from mister potbelly, no doubt,but he found its disorder alluring. It was a suggestive indication of what shehad just been doing. It lent her an erotic look-a look he very much liked.Her body was shapely and firm, with long legs and wonderfully formed breasts, atleast what he had seen of her body before she had thrown closed her robe. Hewould see it again, and could wait.The anticipation added to his excitement. Unlike her other men, he was in norush to have it over. Once it began, it would be over all too quickly. He couldnever stop himself, once it began. For the moment, he would relish all thelittle details, so that he could capture them in his memory for all time.She was more than simply pretty, he decided. She was a creature possessed offeatures that would fire men’s minds with obsessive memories of her, and makethem return time and time again to try, if only for fleeting moments, to possessher. The confidence with which she carried her body told him that she knew this.The frequency with which men spent money to have her was a constantreinforcement of that confidence.Those features, though, no matter their grace and haunting beauty, had an acidicedge to them, a harshness that betrayed her true character. No doubt other mensaw only the sweet face and never noticed.He noticed. He noticed such subtle things, and he had seen this detail often. Italways looked the same. It was a baseness her fair features couldn’t hide fromone such as himself.“Are you new?” he asked, even though he knew she was. “First day here,” shesaid. He knew that, too. “Aydindril is big enough to mean clients for me, butwith a huge army here, it’s all the better. Blue eyes around here aren’t allthat common; my blue eyes remind the D’Haran soldiers of girls from home. Somany extra men mean women like me are in greater demand.”“And it insures a better wage.”She allowed herself a small, smug, knowing smile. “If you couldn’t afford it,you wouldn’t be up here, so cut the complaints.”He had only meant to make an observation, and regretted the way she took it. Hervoice betrayed an underlying, acerbic temperament. He sought to smooth away theripple of her displeasure with him.“Soldiers can sometimes get rough with a young woman as attractive as you.” Thecompliment didn’t register in her sky-blue eyes. She had probably heard it sooften that she was numb to such praise. “I’m glad you came to Silas Latherton,”he went on. “He doesn’t let any of his clients rough up the young ladies. You’llbe safe, here, under his roof. I’m glad you came here.”“Thanks.” Her tone carried no warmth, but the ripple, at least, had beensmoothed. “I’m glad to hear his reputation is known to his clients. I gotslammed around, once. I didn’t like it. Besides the pain, I couldn’t work for amonth.”“That must have been terrible. The pain, I mean.”She tilled her head toward the bed. “You going to take off your clothes, orwhat?”He said nothing, but gestured to her robe. He watched her slip loose the knotfrom the satin belt.“Have it your way,” she said, as she shrugged the robe open just enough to tempthim into getting on with it. “I’d like... I’d like you to enjoy it, too.”She lifted an eyebrow. “Darling, don’t you worry about me. I’ll enjoy it justfine. You’ll no doubt thrill me. But you’re the one who paid for it. Let’s justworry about your pleasure.”He liked to hear the tempered thread of sarcasm in her voice. She cloaked itwell with a breathy tone, and others might have missed it, but he had beenlistening for it.Carefully, slowly, one at a time, he placed four small gold coins on thewashstand beside her. It was ten times what Silas Latherton, downstairs, chargedfor his women’s company, and probably thirty times what he gave her for eachman. She watched the coins as he withdrew his hand, as if counting them toherself to make sure she was seeing what she thought she was seeing. It was agreat deal of money. She gave him a questioning look.He liked the twitch of confusion in her eyes. Women like this weren’t oftenconfused by money, but she was young, and probably never had a man bestow suchlargess on her before. He liked it that it impressed her. He knew that fewthings would.“I’d like you to enjoy yourself. I’m wiling to pay to see you enjoyingyourself.”“Darling, for that much, you’ll remember my screams until you’re an old man.” Ofthat, he was sure.She smiled her best smile, and slipped off the robe. Gazing at him with her big,sky-blue eyes, she blindly hung the robe on a peg in the back of the door.She stroked his chest and then circled her arms around his waist. Gently butdeliberately, she squashed her firm breasts against him.“So what is it you want, darling? Some nice claw marks down your back to makeyour young lady jealous?”“No,” he said. “No, I just want to see you enjoying it. You’re so fair of faceand figure. I think that if you’re paid will enough, you’ll enjoy your part,that’s all. I want to know that you’re enjoying yourself.”She eyed the coins and then smiled up at him. “Oh, I will, darling. I promise.I’m a very talented whore.”“That was what I was hoping.”“I want you to be so pleased with my charms that you will want to return to mybed.”“You seem to be reading my mind.”“My name is Rose,” she whispered in her breathy voice. “A name as beautiful asyou are.” And as unoriginal. “And yours? What should I call you when you call onme regularly, as I’m already aching for you to do?”“I like the name you’ve already given me. I like the sound of it on your lips.”She licked her lips for him. “Glad to meet you, darling.” He slipped a fingerunder the waist of her panties. “Can I have these?”She ran her fingers down his belly, performing a moan at the feel of him. “It’sthe end of a long day. These aren’t exactly... clean. I have some clean ones inmy trunk. For what you’ve paid, you can have as many of them as you wish.Darling, you can have them all, if you wish.”“These will do fine. I only need these.” She smirked up at him. “I see. Likethat, is it?” He didn’t answer.“Why don’t you take them off me,” she teased. “Take your prize.”“I’d like to watch you do it.”Without hesitation, she slipped them down her legs as dramatically as she could.She pressed herself up against him again and, looking into his eyes, stroked hischeek with her panties. She smiled wickedly and then pushed them into his hand.“Here you go. Just for you, darling. Just the way you like them-with the scentof Rose.”He worked them in his fingers, feeling the warmth of her still in them. Shestretched up to kiss him. If he hadn’t known better, known what she was he mighthave thought she wanted him more than anything else in life. But he would pleaseher.“What do you want me to do for you?” she whispered. “Name it, and it’s yours-andI don’t make that offer to my other men. But I want you so badly. Anything. Justtell me.”He could smell the sweat of the other men on her. He could smell the stink oftheir lust on her.“Let’s just see how things work out, shall we. Rose?”“Anything you say, darling.” She smiled dreamily. “Anything.” She winked at himas she swept the four gold coins from the washstand. She swayed provocatively asshe went to the small trunk. She squatted down before it. He had been wonderingif she would squat, or bend at the waist. He was satisfied at the detail, at theremnant of a demure past.As she pushed the coins under some of her clothes in the chest, he saw atop herthings a small pillow decorated with a dash of red. Such a detail intrigued him.It seemed out of place.“What’s that?” he asked, knowing that the money had earned her indulgence. Sheheld it up for him to see. It was small pillow, an item of decoration, afrivolity. It had a red rose embroidered on it.“I made it, when I was younger. I staffed it with cedar shaving, so it wouldsmell nice.” She glided her fingers lovingly over the rose. “My namesake-a rose.For Rosa. My father named me. He was from Nicobarese. Rosa means ‘rose’ in hislanguage. He always called me his little Rosa, and said that I grew in thegarden of his heart.”The detail astonished him. He was thrilled to know something so intimate abouther. He felt as if he already possessed her. The pleasure of knowing such asmall, seemingly insignificant thing pounded through his veins.As he watched her replace the little packet of her past into her trunk, hewondered at her father, wondered if he knew where she was, or if perhaps he hadsent her away in revulsion, his rose wilted in his heart. He imagined an angryscene. He wondered at her mother-if her mother understood her choice in life, orcried at a daughter lost. Now he, too, was playing a part in who she was, in herlife.“May I call you Rosa?” he asked, as she closed the lid of her trunk. “It’s sucha lovely name.”She looked back over her shoulder. Her eyes watched his fingers working herunderpants into a tight ball.She returned to him, smiling as she came. “You’re my special man, now. I’venever told another man my true name. It would give me pleasure to hear my givenname on your lips.”His heart pounded, and he swayed on his feet with his need. “Thank you, Rosa,”he whispered, and he truly meant it. “I want so much to please you.”“Your hands are trembling.”They always did, until he started. Then, they were rock steady. Once he started,he would be steady. It was just the anticipation. “I’m sorry.”A throaty, lusty laugh came from deep in her throat. “Don’t be. It excites methat you would be nervous.”He wasn’t nervous, not in the least, but he was excited. Her hands found that hewas. “I want to taste you.” She licked his ear. “I have no one else tonight. Wehave all the time we want to enjoy this.”“I know,” he whispered back. “That’s why I wanted to be last.”“Yes,” she teased, “I want it to last, too. Can you make it last, darling?”“I can, and I will,” he promised. “A long time.”She let out a purr of satisfaction at his promise, and turned in his arms,pressing her bottom against him. She arched her back and rocked her head againsthis chest as she moaned again. He kept the smirk from his face as he looked downinto her sky-blue eyes. Yes, she was a talented whore.He slid his hand down her lower spine, counting her vertebrae, fingering thespaces between them. She moaned urgently at his touch. Because of the way sheswayed her bottom, he missed the spot he wanted. She staggered.The second time he slammed the knife into her lower back, he hit the right spot,between the vertebrae, severing her spinal cord.He swept an arm around her middle to hold her up. The shocked, grunting moan wasreal, this time. Anyone in the other rooms wouldn’t think it any different fromthe sounds she regularly made for men. Others didn’t notice such details. Hedid, and savored the difference.As her mouth widened to scream, he stuffed it full with the wadded ball of herdirty underpants. He timed it just right, so only the cry of the gasp sounded,before the pitch rose. He yanked the silk tie from her robe on the peg besidehim and whirled it around her head four times to hold the gag in her mouth. Withone hand, and the aid of his teeth, he drew it tight and knotted it.He would have liked to have listened to her heartfelt screams, but that wouldbring a premature end to their pleasure. He loved the screams, the cries. Theywere always sincere.He pressed his mouth against the side of her head. He could smell the sweat ofmen in her hair.“Oh, Rosa, you are going to please me so. You are going to give me more pleasurethan you’ve ever given any man before. I want you to enjoy it, too. I know thisis what you always wanted. I’m the man you’ve been waiting for. I’ve come atlast.”He let her slip to the floor. Her legs were useless, now. She wasn’t goinganywhere.She tried to punch him between his legs. He caught her dainty little fist in hishand. He watched her wide, sky-blue eyes as he pressed open her fist. He heldher palm between his thumb and a finger, and bent it down until the bones in herwrist snapped.He used the arms of her robe to bind her hands, so that she couldn’t pull thegag from her mouth. His heart hammered as he listened to her muffled wails. Hecouldn’t understand the words against the gag, but they heightened hisexcitement because he could feel their pain.A storm of emotion rampaged through his mind. At least the voices were silent,for now, leaving him to his lust. He wasn’t sure what the voices were, but hewas sure that he was only able to hear them because of his singular intellect;he was able to seine such evanescent messages from the ethers because of hisincomparable perception, and because he minded the details.Tears flooded down her face. Her perfectly plucked brows bunched together,lifting in the middle, furrowing the skin on her forehead into neat rows. Hecounted them, because he was special.With wide, anguished, sky-blue eyes, she watched as he removed his clothes andset them aside. It wouldn’t do to have them soaked in blood.The knife was rock steady in his hand now. He stood above her, naked and erect,to show her what a good job she was doing for him, so far. And then he began."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25Kahlan, with Cara following behind, came to the door of the small room Richardused as an office at the same lime as a young woman with short, black hairarrived carrying a small silver tray with hot tea. Raina, standing guard besidethe door along with Ulic and Egan, yawned. “Richard ask for tea, Sarah?”The young woman curtsied, as best she could holding the tray. “Yes, MotherConfessor.”Kahlan lifted the tray from the woman’s hands. “That’s all right, Sarah. I’mgoing in-I’ll take it in to him.”Sahara blushed, trying to hold on to the tray. “But, Mother Confessor, youshouldn’t have to do that.”“Don’t be silly. I’m perfectly capable, of carrying a tray for ten feet.” Kahlanbacked away a step, gaining full possession of the tray. Sarah didn’t know whatto do with her hands, so she bowed.“Yes, Mother Confessor,” she said before departing. Rather than being pleased tohave been relieved of a small task, she looked as if she had just been ambushedand robbed. Sarah, like most of the staff, was fiercely vigilant about herduties. “Has he been up long?” Kahlan asked Raina.Raina gave her a sullen look. “Yes. All night. I finally left a squad of guardsand went to bed. He had Berdine up with him all night, too.” The reason, nodoubt, for the sullen look.“I’m sure it was important, but I’ll she if I can’t get him to stop at night forsome sleep, or at least let Berdine get hers.”“I would appreciate it,” Cara muttered. “Raina gets grumpy when Berdine doesn’tcome to bed.”“Berdine needs her sleep,” Raina said defensively.“I’m sure it was important, Raina, but you’re right; if people don’t get enoughsleep, they won’t be any good to him. I’ll remind him-he sometimes gets lost inwhat he’s doing and forgets about what other people need.” Raina’s dark eyesbrightened. “Thank you. Mother Confessor.” Kahlan balanced the tray in one handas she opened the door. Cara took up station beside Raina, peering after Kahlan,to make sure she didn’t have any trouble with the tray, and then closed thedoor.Richard had his back to her as he stared out the window. A low fire in thehearth did a poor job banishing the chill from the room.Kahlan smirked to herself. She would put the lie to his boast. Before she had achance to set the tray on the table, and let the cup ping against the pot tocatch his attention and make him think it was the serving woman, Richard spokewithout turning.“Kahlan, good. I’m glad you came.” Frowning, she set down the tray.“You have your back to the door. How could you know it was me, and not the womanbringing the tea you ordered?”Richard turned around with a puzzled look. “Why would I think it was the womanwith the tea, when it was you bringing it in?” He truly looked bewildered by herquestion.“I swear, Richard, sometimes you give me the shivers.” She decided that he hadto have seen her reflection in the window. He lifted her chin with a finger andkissed her. “I’m glad to see you. It’s been lonely without you.”“Sleep well?”“Sleep? I... I guess not. But at least the riots seem to have ceased. I don’tknow what we would have done if the moon had risen red again. I can’t believepeople would go wild simply because of something like that.”“You have to admit that it was odd... frightening.”“I do, but that didn’t make me want to run screaming through the streetsbreaking windows and setting fires.”“That’s because you’re Lord Rahl, and you have more sense.”“I’ll have some order, too. I’ll not have people doing that kind of damage, tosay nothing of injuring innocent people. The next time it happens I’m going tohave the soldiers put it down immediately, rather than wait, hoping people willbe suddenly stricken with reason. I have more important matters to worry aboutthan childish reactions to superstition.”Kahlan could tell by his smoldering tone that he was on the verge of losing histemper.His eyes were bleary. She knew that if a person didn’t get enough sleep,forbearance could quickly evaporate. One night was one thing, but three in a rowwas quite another. She hoped it wasn’t affecting his judgment. “More importantmatters. You mean your work with Berdine?” He nodded. Kahlan poured a cup of teaand held it out to him. He stared at the cup a moment before taking it.“Richard, you have to let the poor woman get more sleep. She’ll be no good toyou if you don’t let her have enough sleep.”He took a sip. “I know.” He turned to the window and yawned. “I had to send herover to my room to take a nap. She was making mistakes.”“Richard, you need to get some sleep, too.”He stared out the window toward the massive stone walls of the Wizard’s Keep upon the mountain. “I think I may have found out what the red moon meant.” Thesombre quality in his voice gave her pause. “What?” she finally asked.He turned to the table and set down the cup. “I had Berdine looking for placeswhere Kolo used the word moss, or maybe mentioned a red moon, hoping that wemight find something to help us.”He flipped open the journal on the table. He had found the journal up in theKeep, where it had been sealed in for three thousand years, along with the manwho had written it. Kolo had been keeping watch over the sliph, the strangecreature that could take some people great distances, when the towers separatingthe Old and New Worlds were completed. When the towers were activated, Kolo hadbeen sealed in, trapped, and had died there.The journal had already proven an invaluable source of information, but it waswritten in High D’Haran, which complicated matters. Berdine understood HighD’Haran, but not such an ancient form of it. They had to use another bookwritten in almost the same ancient form of High D’Haran to aid them. Richard’schildhood memory of that book’s story helped Berdine to translate words, whichthey used as a cross reference in order to work out the translation of thejournal.As they went along, Richard was learning much of both the vernacular HighD’Haran and also the much older, argot form, but it was still frustratingly slowgoing.After Richard had brought Kahlan back to Aydindril, he told her how he had usedthe information in the book to find a way to rescue her. He said that sometimeshe could seem to read with ease, but then at other places he and Berdine becamebogged down. He said that at times he was able to unravel a page in a few hours,and then they would spend a whole day trying to translate one sentence. “Moss?You said you had her checking for the word moss. What’s that mean?” He took asip of tea and set the cup tack down. “Moss? Oh, it means ‘wind’ in HighD’Haran.” He opened the pages to a marker. “Since it was taking so much time totranslate the journal, we’ve just been looking for key words, and thenconcentrating on those passages, hoping to get lucky.”“I thought you said that you were translating it in order, to better understandthe way Kolo uses the language.”He sighed in annoyance. “Kahlan, I don’t have the time for that. We had tochange our tactics.” Kahlan didn’t like the sound of that.“Richard, I was told that your brother is the High Priest of an Order called theRaug’Moss. Is that High D’Haran?”“Means ‘Divine Wind’“ he muttered.He tapped the book, not seeming to want to discuss it. “See here? Berdine foundwhere Kolo was talking about a red moon. He was really upset about it. The wholeKeep was in an uproar. He writes that they were betrayed by the ‘team.’ He saidthat the team was to be put on trial for their crimes. We haven’t had time tolook into that, yet. But...”Richard flipped the book back toward the front where one of their writtentranslations was inserted, and read her the passage:“ ‘Today, one of our most coveted desires, possible only through the brilliant,tireless work of a team of near to one hundred, has been accomplished. The itemsmost feared lost, should we be overrun, have been protected. A cheer went upfrom all in the Keep when we received word today that we were successful. Somethought it was not possible, but to the astonishment of all, it is done: TheTemple of the Winds is gone.’““Gone?” Kahlan asked. “What’s the Temple of the Winds? Where did it go?” Richardshut the book. “I don’t know. But later in the journal, Kolo says that this teamwho had done it had betrayed then all. High D’Haran is an odd language. Wordshave different meanings depending on how they’re used.”“Most languages are that way. Our own is.”“Yes, but sometimes, in High D’Haran, a word that ordinarily has differentmeanings according to its usage is intended to have multiple meanings. You can’thave one meaning without all the rest. That makes translating it all the moredifficult.“For example, in the old prophecy that names me the bringer of death, the word‘death’ means three different things, depending on how it’s used: the bringer ofthe underworld, the world of the dead; the bringer of spirits, spirits of thedead; and the bringer of death, meaning to kill. Each meaning is different, butall three were intended. That was the key.“The prophecy was in the book we brought with us from the Palace of theProphets. Warren was only able to translate the prophecy after I told him thatall three meanings were true. He told me that because of that, he was the firstin thousands of years to know the true meaning of the prophecy, as it waswritten.”“What does this have to do with the Temple of the Winds?”“When Kolo says ‘winds’ I think that he sometimes just means the wind, like whenyou say that the wind is blowing today, but sometimes when he says ‘winds’ Ithink he means the Temple of the Winds. I think he used it as a short way ofreferring to the Temple of the Winds, and at the same time as a way todifferentiate it from other temples.”Kahlan blinked. “Are you saying that you think Shota’s message, that the windhunts you. means that the Temple of the Winds is really somehow hunting you?”“I don’t know, for sure.”“Richard, that’s a pretty big leap of reasoning, if that’s what you’re reallythinking-to take Kolo’s short way of referring to the Temple of the Winds andinfer that Shota is talking about the same place.”“When Kolo talks about how everyone was in an uproar, and these men were to beput on trial, he makes it sound as if the winds have a sense of perception.”Kahlan cleared her throat this time. “Richard, are you trying to tell me thatKolo claims that this place, the Temple of the Winds, is sentient?”She wondered how long it had been since he had gotten any sleep. She wondered ifhe was thinking clearly. “I said I wasn’t sure.”“But that’s what you mean.”“Well, it sounds... absurd, when you ;;ay it like that. It doesn’t sound thesame when you read it in High D’Haran. I don’t know how to explain thedifference, but there is one. Maybe it’s just a difference of degree.”“Difference of degree or not. how can a place have a sense of perception? Besentient?”Richard sighed. “I don’t know. I’ve been trying to figure that out myself. Whydo you think I’ve been up all night?”“But such a thing is not possible.”His defiant grey eyes turned to her. “The Wizard’s Keep is just a place, but itknows when someone violates it. It reacts to that violation by stopping theperson, even killing them if it must, to prevent an unauthorized person fromentering a place they don’t belong.”Kahlan made a face. “Richard, that’s the shields. Wizards placed those shieldsto protect important or dangerous things from being stolen, or to prevent peoplefrom going where they could be hurt.”“But they react without anyone having to tell them to, don’t they?”“So does a leg-hold trap. That doesn’t make them sentient. You mean that theTemple of the Winds is protected by shields. That’s all you’re saying, then-thatit has shields.”“Yes, and no. It’s more than simple shields. Shields only ward. The way Kolotalks about it makes it sound like the Temple of the Winds can... I don’t know,like it can think, like it can decide things when it must.”“Decide things. Like what?”“When he wrote how everyone was? in a panic about the red moon, that was when hesaid that the team who had sent the Temple of the Winds away had betrayed them.”“So... what?”“So I think that the Temple of the Winds made the moon turn red.” Kahlan watchedhis eyes, transfixed by the look of conviction in them. “I won’t even ask howsuch a thing would be possible, but for the moment, let’s just say you’re right.Why would the Temple of the Winds make the moon turn red?” Richard held hergaze. “As a warning.”“Of what?”“The shields in the Keep react by warding. Almost no one can pass through them.I can, because I have the right kind of magic. If someone who wants to do harmhas enough magic, and knowledge, they too can get by the shields. What happens,then?”“Well, nothing. They get through.”“Exactly. I think the Temple of the Winds can do more. I think it can know ifsomeone has violated its defenses, and lend a warning.”“The red moon,” she whispered. “It makes sense.”She put a hand tenderly to his arm. “Richard, you need to get some rest. Youcan’t infer all this from Kolo’s journal alone. It was just one journal, writtena long time ago.”He yanked his arm away. “I don’t know where else to look. Shota said the windwas hunting me! I don’t need to go to sleep to have nightmares.”In that instant, Kahlan knew that it wasn’t Shota’s message that was drivinghim. It was the prophecy down in the pit.The first part of the prophecy said: On the red moon will come the firestorm. Itwas the second part that truly terrified her.To quench the inferno, he must seek the remedy in the wind. Lightning will findhim on that path, for the one in white, his true beloved, will betray him in herblood.She realized that the prophecy frightened him more than he had admitted. Someoneknocked at the door. “What!” Richard yelled.Cara opened the door and poked her head in. “General Kerson would like to seeyou, Lord Rahl.”Richard raked his fingers back through his hair. “Send him in, please, Cara.”Richard put a hand to Kahlan’s shoulder as he stared off toward the window. “I’msorry,” he whispered. “You’re right. I need some sleep. Maybe Nadine can give mesome of her herbs to put me to sleep. My mind doesn’t seem to want to allow itwhen I try.”She would sooner let Shota give him something. Kahlan answered with a tendertouch, fearing to test her voice at that moment.General Kerson, wearing a wide grin, marched into the room. He saluted with afist over his heart before coming to a halt.“Lord Rahl. Good morning. And a good morning it is. thanks to you.” Richard tooka sip of his tea. “Why’s that?”The general slapped Richard on the shoulder. “The men are all better. The thingsyou ordered-the garlic, blueberries, quench oak tea-it worked. They’re all wellagain. I’ve got a whole army of bright-eyed men who’re ready and able to do asordered. I can’t tell you how relieved I am. Lord Rahl.”“Your smile just did. general. I’m relieved, too.”“My men are uplifted that their new Lord Rahl is a worker of great magic, ableto turn death from their door. Every one of those men would like to buy you anale and toast your health and long life.”“It wasn’t magic. It was simply things that... Thank them for the offer, butI... What about the riots? Were there any more last night?”General Kerson grunted dismissively. “It’s mostly finished. The worry went outof people when the moon returned to normal.”“Good. That’s good news, general. Thinks for the report.” The general rubbed afinger along his smooth jaw. “Ah, there was one other thing. Lord Rahl.” Heglanced at Kahlan. ‘If we could talk...” The man let out a sigh. “A... woman wasmurdered last night.”“I’m sorry. Was it someone you knew?”“No, Lord Rahl. She was a... a woman who... she accepted money in return for...”“If you’re trying to say she was a whore, general,” Kahlan said, “I’ve heard theword before. I won’t faint if I hear it again.”“Yes, Mother Confessor.” He turned his attention back to Richard. “She was founddead this morning.”“What happened to her? How was she killed?”The general was looking more uncomfortable by the moment. “Lord Rahl, I’ve beenlooking at dead people a lot of years. I can’t remember the last time I vomitedwhen I saw one.”Richard rested a hand on one of the leather pouches on his wide belt. “What wasdone to her?”The general glanced to Kahlan as if to beg her indulgence as he put an armaround Richard’s shoulder and pulled him aside. Kahlan couldn’t hear thewhispered words, but the look on Richard’s face told her she didn’t want toknow. Richard went to the hearth and stood staring into the flames. “I’m sorry.But you must have men who can look into it. Why are you bringing this to me?”The general grimaced and cleared his throat. “Ah, well, you see. Lord Rahl, itwas, well, it was your brother who found her.”Richard turned with a dark frown. “What was Drefan doing at a house ofprostitution?”“Ah, well, I asked him that myself. Lord Rahl. He doesn’t seem to me a man whowould have any trouble”-the general wiped a hand across his face-”I asked him,and he said that it was his business, not mine, if he wanted to go towhorehouses.”Kahlan could see the tightly controlled anger etched in Richard’s expression. Heabruptly snatched his gold cloak from a chair.“Let’s go. Take me there. Take me where Drefan goes. I want to talk to thepeople there.”Kahlan and General Kerson rushed after Richard as he swept out the door. Shecaught his sleeve and glanced to the general. “General, could you give us amoment, please?”After he moved down the hall, Kahlan pulled Richard in the other direction, awayfrom Cara, Raina, Ulic, and Egan. She didn’t think that Richard was in any moodat the moment to be looking into such a thing. Besides, she had come to him fora reason.“Richard, there are representatives writing to meet with us. They’ve beenwaiting days.”“Drefan is my brother.”“He’s also a grown man.”Richard rubbed his eyes. “I need to see about this, and I have a lot of otherthings on my mind. Would you mind talking to the representatives? Tell them thatI was called away on important matters, and that they can just as easily givetheir land’s surrender to you and then all the ;arrangements of command canbegin to be coordinated?”“I can. I know that some of them would be just as happy to talk to me and nothave to face you, even in surrender; they’re terrified of you.”“I wouldn’t hurt them,” Richard objected.“Richard, you frightened the wits out of them, before, when you demanded theirsurrender. You promised to annihilate them if they dared join with the ImperialOrder.“They fear you might do it anyway, on a whim. The reputation of the Master ofD’Hara precedes you, and you fed their fears. You can’t expect that they’llsuddenly be at ease around you just because they agree to your terms.”He leaned down and whispered in her ear. “Well, just tell them how lovable Iam.”“I can tell them that you look forward to working with them for our mutual peaceand prosperity,” she said with a smile. “They trust me, and will listen.“But Tristan Bashkar, the Jarian minister, is here, along with a pair from theroyal house in Grennidon. These three are the important ones, the ones with hugestanding armies. They’re expecting to meet with you. It is they who may not besatisfied to surrender to me. They will want to discuss terms.”“Make them satisfied.”“Tristan Bashkar is not an affable man but a tough negotiator, as are Leonoraand Walter Cholbane, from Grennidon.”“That’s one reason I ended the Midlands alliance: too many wish to argue andposture. Arguing and posturing are over. The terms of surrender areunconditional.” Richard hooked a thumb behind his wide leather belt. Hisexpression hardened. “The terms are fair to all, the same for all, and are notsubject to discussion. They’re either with us or against us.”Kahlan dragged a finger down the black sleeve of his shirt, over the rise andfall of his muscles. He’d been busy with the journal. It had been too long sinceshe’d been in those arms.“Richard, you depend on me for advice. I know these lands. Just having themagree is not the only aim. There will be need for sacrifice. We need their fullcooperation in this war.“You are Lord Rahl. the Master of D’Hara. You made the demands. You said thatsurrender, while unconditional, will be? handled with respect for their people.I know these representatives. They will expect to see you, as a matter of yourrespect for them.”“You are the Mother Confessor. We are one, in this as in everything else. Youled these people long before I came along. You have no less standing than I. Youhave had their respect a good long time. Remind them of that.”Richard directed a brief gaze up the hall to the waiting general, and theothers. He looked back into her eyes.“It may not be any of General Kerson’s business, as far as Drefan is concerned,but it is mine; I’ll not be deceived by another brother. From what you’ve said,and others have told me, he already has women in the palace fawning over him. Ifhe catches something from those whores and then gives it to the young womenhere... that’s my business.“I’ll not have it be my brother bringing diseases to innocent women here whotrust him because he’s my brother.”Sarah, the woman who had been bringing tea to Richard, was young and trusting.She was one of the women captivated by Drefan.Kahlan rubbed his back. “I understand. If you promise you will get some sleep,I’ll go talk with the representatives. When you have time to talk to them, thenyou will talk to them. They have no choice but to wait. You are the Lord Rahl.”Richard bent and kissed her cheek. “I love you.”“Then marry me.”“Soon. We’ll go wake the sliph soon.”“Richard, you be careful. Marlin said that the Sister of the Dark-I don’tremember her name-left Aydindril and returned to Jagang, but he may be lying.She could still be out there.”“Sister Amelia. You know, I remember her. When I first went to the Palace of theProphets, she was one of Verna’s friends who met us: Sisters Phoebe, Janet, andAmelia. I remember Amelia’s tears of joy at seeing Verna after all those years.”“Jagang has her now.”He nodded. “Verna must be heartbroken that her friend is in Jagang’s hands, andworse, that she’s a Sister of the Dark. If Verna even knows.”“You be careful. Despite what Jagang says, she may still be lurking inAydindril.”“I doubt it, but I’ll be careful.”He turned and signalled to Cara. She sprinted up the hall. “Cara, I’d like youto go with Kahlan. Let Berdine get some rest. I’ll take Raina, Ulic, and Eganwith me.”“Yes, Lord Rahl. I will keep her safe.”Richard smiled. “I know you will, Cara, but that’s not going to get you out ofyour punishment.”She betrayed no emotion. “Yes, Lord Rail.”“What punishment?” Kahlan asked when they were out of earshot. “An unjust one.Mother Confessor.”“That bad. What is it?”“I am to feed seeds to his chipmunks.” Kahlan suppressed a smile. “That doesn’tsound so bad. Cara.” Cara flipped her Agiel up into her fist. “That is why it isunjust, Mother Confessor.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26Kahlan sat alone in the ornate chair of the Mother Confessor, the tallest onebehind the semicircular dais, under the ornate fresco of Magda Searus, the firstMother Confessor, and her wizard, Merritt. They were painted onto the dome thatcapped the enormous council chambers. Kahlan watched the representativesapproaching across the expanse of marble before her.From her place of honor overhead, Magda Searus had witnessed the long historythat was the Midlands alliance. She had witnessed, too, Richard ending it.Kahlan prayed that Magda Searus’s spirit would understand and approve of hisreasons; they were benevolent, despite what it must seem to some.Cara stood behind Kahlan’s right shoulder. Kahlan had hastily gathered a numberof administrators to handle matters of state, such as the signing of documentsof surrender and trade instructions, and several D’Haran officers to overseematters of command. They all waited silently behind her left shoulder.Kahlan tried to focus her mind on the things she must say and do, but Richard’swords about the Temple of the Winds made it hard to think of anything else. Hethought the Temple of the Winds was sentient. The winds were hunting Richard.The Temple of the Winds was hunting him. That threat lurked in every dark cornerof her mind.Footsteps of the representatives and boot strikes of the soldiers escorting themechoed off vast expanses of marble, and brought her out of her breeding. Theapproaching knot of people strode through glaring shafts of sunlight thatstreamed in through round windows at the lower edge of the dome. Kahlan put onher Confessor’s face, as her mother had taught her, a face that showed nothing,and masked what was inside.Arched openings around the room covered stairways up to colonnaded balconiesedged with polished mahogany railings, but this day no observers stood behindthe railing.The group, flanked by D’Haran soldiers, came to a halt before the resplendent,carved desk. Tristan Bashkar of Jaraand Leonora and Walter Cholbane of Grennidonstood at the fore. Behind them waited ambassadors Seldon from Mardovia, Wexlerfrom Pendisan Reach, and Brumford from Togressa.Kahlan knew that Jara and Grennidon, lands of vast wealth and large standingarmies, were likely lo be the most obstinate about retaining their prerogativeof status in return for their surrender. She knew she must shake theirconfidence first. Having served in a position of authority and power most of herlife, first as a Confessor, then as the Mother Confessor, Kahlan knew the taskwell. She knew these people, knew how they thought; surrender was acceptable, aslong as they could retain station above certain other lands, and as long as theycould be assured of unfettered authority in their own business.That kind of attitude was no longer acceptable. It couldn’t be tolerated if allof them were to have a chance against the Imperial Order. Kahlan had to upholdRichard’s word and conditions of surrender. The future of every land in theMidlands depended on this.In order for this new union to prevail against the Imperial Order, there couldno longer be sovereign lands, each with its own agenda. They must now all beone. under one authority of command, working together as one people, not acoalition that could fragment at a critical moment, letting the Imperial Ordersnatch freedom from all.“Lord Rahl is occupied with matters of our mutual safety in our struggle. I havecome in his place to hear your decisions. Your words will be passed on to him asyou speak them to me. As Mother Confessor, Queen of Galea, Queen of Kelton, andbetrothed of the Master of D’Hara. I have the authority to speak on behalf ofthe D’Haran empire. My word is as final as would be Lord Rahl’s.”The words had come out unbidden, but that was what it was-the D’Haran empire.Richard was its supreme leader, its supreme authority. The representatives bowedand mumbled that they understood. Wanting these people of authority to know thatthe order of things was no longer how it had been in these chambers in the past,Kahlan reversed the order of how such matters were handled. “AmbassadorBrumford, please step forward.”Tristan Bashkar and Leonora Cholbane immediately began objecting. It was unheardof to have a lesser land speak first.Kahlan’s glare brought them to silence. “When I ask you to speak for yourpeople, then you may speak. Not before. Until a land joins with us throughsurrender of their sovereignty, they have no standing before me.“Do not expect that your presumption will be excused, as was customary in thepast in the alliance of the Midlands. The Midlands alliance is no more. You nowstand in the D’Haran empire.” An icy silence settled over the chambers.Kahlan had been devastated when she had first heard that Richard had spoken muchthe same words in this very chamber to representatives of the Midlands. She hadcome to understand that there was no other way.Tristan Bashkar and the Cholbanes, to whom she had directed her words, stoodred-faced but silent. When she moved her gaze to Ambassador Brumford, heremembered her orders and scurried forward.The amicable Ambassador Brumford gathered his voluminous violet robes in onehand and put a knee to the marble floor as he sank into a deep bow.“Mother Confessor,” he said as he straightened, “Togressa stands ready to joinwith you and all free people in our alliance against tyranny.”“Thank you. Ambassador. We welcome Togressa as a member of the D’Haran empire.The people of Togressa will have standing equal to any among us. We know yourpeople will do their part.”“They will. Thank you, Mother Confessor. Please relay my word to Lord Rahl thatwe are joyful to be a part of D’Hara.”Kahlan smiled sincerely. “Lord Rahl and I share your joy. Ambassador Brumford.”He moved to the side as Kahlan called forward the muscled, short, fiery-eyedAmbassador Wexler from Pendisan Reach.“Mother Confessor,” he said upon arising, tugging his leather surcoat straight,“Pendisan Reach is a small land, with a small legion of men at arms, but we arefierce fighters, as any who have come against our swords can attest.“The Mother Confessor has always fought for us with the same fierceness. We havealways held with the Midlands and with the Mother Confessor, and so we accordyour words great weight. With the greatest respect, we heed your counsel to joinwith D’Hara.“Our swords are lowered to you and Lord Rahl. The people of Pendisan Reach, boththose of simple muscle and bone, and those with magic’s talents, wish to be atthe van of battle against the horde from beyond the wilds, so that the enemy mayhave a bitter taste of our ferocity. We will be known to all from this dayforward as the D’Harans from Pendisan Reach, if it so pleases you.”Touched by his words, Kahlan bowed her head to him. The people of Pendisan Reachdid have a flair for the dramatic, but they were no less wholehearted for it. Assmall as their land was, they were not to be taken lightly; the ambassador’sbold claim of their ferocity was no idle boast. If only their numbers were asgreat as their fortitude.“I can’t promise you the van. Ambassador Wexler, but we will be honored to haveyour people with us in our struggle. We will value them regardless of how theyserve.”She turned a dispassionate face to the ambassador from Mardovia. The Mardovianpeople were proud, too, and no less fierce. They had to be for their survival intough country among the wilds, though they, also, were a small land. “AmbassadorSeldon, please come forward and deliver Mardovia’s decision.” Ambassador Seldonglided forward, wearily eying the others. He bowed from the waist, his whitehair falling forward over the gold braiding on the shoulders of his red coat ashe did so.“Mother Confessor. The assembly of seven of Mardovia in our mother city ofRenwold has charged me with the duty of the long journey to Aydindril to relaytheir decision. The assembly of seven has no desire or intention to relinquishrule over our beloved people to outlanders, whether they be from D’Hara or fromthe Imperial Order.“Your war with the Imperial Order is not our war. The assembly of seven hasruled that Mardovia will remain sovereign and will remain neutral.”Behind her, in the silence, a soldier coughed. The sound of it echoed around thestone chamber.“Ambassador Seldon, the land of Mardovia lies among the eastern wilds, not farfrom the Old World. You will be vulnerable to attack.”“Mother Confessor, the walls surrounding our mother city of Renwold have stoodthe test of time. As you say, we lie among the people of the wilds. Those peoplein the past have tried to exterminate us. None ever succeeded in so much asbreaching the walls, much less overcoming our stalwart defenders. Instead, thevarious peoples of the wilds now trade with us, and Renwold is a center ofcommerce in the eastern wilds of the Midlands, respected by all who once soughtto conquer us.”Kahlan leaned forward. “Ambassador, the Order is no tribe from the wilds. Theywill crush you. Doesn’t the assembly of seven have the sense to realize that?”Ambassador Seldon smiled indulgently. “Mother Confessor, I understand yourconcern, but as I have said, Renwold’s walls have stood us in good stead. Beassured, Renwold will not fall to the Order.” His expression hardened. “Nor willit fall to this new alliance you form with D’Hara.“Numbers do not mean much against a knob of stone in the wilds. Would-beconquerors soon tire of breaking their teeth on so small a morsel. Our smallsize, our location, and our walls make us less than worth the trouble. Should wejoin with you, then we would be vulnerable because we would representresistance.“Our neutrality is not of hostile intent. We will be willing to trade with youralliance, as we will be willing to trade with the Imperial Order. We wish harmto no one, but we will defend ourselves.”“Ambassador Seldon, your wife and children are in Renwold. Don’t you understandthe danger to your family?”“My beloved wife and children are safe behind the walls of Renwold, MotherConfessor. I fear not for them.”“And will your walls stand against magic? The Order uses those with magic! Orare you too drunk with the past to see the threat to your future?”His face had reddened. “The decision of the assembly of seven is final. We don’tfear for our safety. We have people of magic in turn to protect the walls frommagic. Neutrality is not a threat. Perhaps you should pray to the good spiritsfor mercy, since it is you who sues for war. To live by violence is to inviteit.”Kahlan drummed her fingernails against the desktop as everyone awaited herwords. She knew that even if she could convince this man, it would do no good:the assembly of seven had made its decision, and he could not change it even ifhe wanted.“Ambassador Seldon, you will leave Aydindril by the end of the day. You willreturn to the assembly of seven in Renwold, and tell them that D’Hara does notrecognize neutrality. This is a struggle for our world-whether it is to thrivein the Light, or wither under the shadow of tyranny. Lord Rahl has decreed thatthere are no bystanders. I have decreed no mercy against the Order. We are ofone mind in this.“You are either with us, or you stand against us. The Imperial Order views itthe same.“Tell the assembly of seven that Mardovia now stands against us. One of us,either D’Hara or the Order, will conquer Mardovia. Direct them to pray to thegood spirits, and ask that it is we who conquer you and take Renwold instead ofthe Order. We will impose harsh sanctions for your resistance, but your peoplewill live. Should the Order set upon you first, they will annihilate yourdefenders and enslave your people. Mardovia will be ground into the dust of thepast.”His indulgent smile widened. “Fear not. Mother Confessor. Renwold will standagainst any land, even the Order.”Kahlan regarded him with cold ire. “I have walked among the dead inside thewalls of Ebinissia. I have seen the slaughter at the hands of the Order. I haveseen what they did to the living, first. I will pray for those poor people whowill suffer because of the mad delusions of the assembly of seven.”Kahlan angrily gestured to the guards to escort the man from the chambers. Sheknew what would happen to the Mardovian people if the Order attacked first. Sheknew, too, that Richard could not risk the lives of allies simply to takeRenwold in order to protect it. It was too distant a land. She would adviseagainst it, as would any of his generals.Mardovia was lost; their neutrality would draw the Order as the scent of blooddrew wolves.She had walked through the gates in the massive walls of Renwold. The walls wereimpressive. They were not invincible. The Order had wizards, like Marlin. Thewalls would not stand against wizard’s fire, despite those of magic’s talentdefending Renwold.Kahlan tried to put the fate of Mardovia from her mind as she called the pairfrom the royal house in Grennidon forward. “How does Grennidon stand?” shegrowled. Walter Cholbane cleared his throat. His sister spoke.“Grennidon, a land of great importance, a land of vast fields which produce-”Kahlan cut her off. “I asked how Grennidon stands,”Leonora dry-washed her hands as she considered the resolve in Kahlan’s eyes.“The royal house offers its surrender. Mother Confessor.”“Thank you, Leonora. We are gladdened for you and for your people. Please see toit that my officers here are granted any information they need so that your armycan be brought under coordination of our central command.”“Yes, Mother Confessor,” she stammered. “Mother Confessor, are our forces to bebled against the walls of Renwold to bring them down?”Grennidon was north of Mardovia, and in the best position to attack, but Kahlanknew that Grennidon would not relish attacking a trading partner. Moreover, someof the family of the assembly of seven had married into the royal house ofCholbane.“No. Renwold is a city of the walking dead. The vultures will pick it clean. Inthe meantime, trade with Mardovia is forbidden. We trade only with those whojoin us.”“Yes, Mother Confessor.”“Mother Confessor,” Walter, her brother, interjected, “we wish to discuss someof the terms with Lord Rahl. We have things of value to offer, and matters ofinterest to us that we wish to bring to his attention,”“Surrender is unconditional. There is nothing to discuss. Lord Rahl hasinstructed me to remind you that there will be no negotiations. Either you arewith us, or you are against us. Now, do you wish to withdraw your offer ofsurrender before you sign the documents and instead cast your fate withMardovia?” He pressed his lips together as he took a deep breath. “No, MotherConfessor.”“Thank you. When Lord Rahl has the time, soon, I hope, he would very much liketo hear what you have to say, as a valued member of the D’Haran empire. Just .remember that you are now part of D’Hara, and he is the Master of D’Hara, themaster of that empire.”She had treated them with less respect than the two small lands who had offeredtheir surrender; not to do so would have resulted in emboldening them, andinviting trouble. These two were among those who always requested red rooms.Walter and Leonora seemed to relax, now that Kahlan had their acquiescence. TheCholbanes could be tenacious and stubborn to the end, but once an agreement wasreached and their word given, they never looked back, never second-guessed whatmight have been. It was a quality that made dealings with them bearable. “Weunderstand, Mother Confessor,” Walter said.“Yes,” his sister added. “And we look forward to the day that the Imperial Orderno longer threatens all our people.”“Thank you. both of you. I know this must seem harsh to you. but know that werejoice to count you and your people among us.”As they moved off to sign the papers and talk with the officers, Kahlan turnedher attention to Tristan Bashkar. of Jara. “Minister Bashkar, how stands Jara?”Tristan Bashkar was a member of the royal family of Jara. In Jara, the positionof minister was one of high rank and trust. Of those gathered, he was the onlyone with the authority to change his land’s commitment without returning homefor consultation. If he thought there was reason enough, he could alter theroyal family’s instructions, and thus, Jara’s stand.Hardly out of his thirties, he wore his age well. He also used his looks todistract people from his quick mind. After people had been disarmed by hislikable smile, bright brown eyes, and smooth-spoken flattery, he would extractconcessions before they realized they had parted with them.He brushed a thick lock of dark hair back from his forehead-a compulsive habit.Or possibly a way to draw interest to his eyes. where people were oftendistracted.He spread his hands apologetically. “Mother Confessor, I’m afraid it’s not aseasy as a simple yes or no, although I wish to assure you that we are in harmonywith the great empire of D’Hara, and admire the wisdom of both Lord Rahl. and ofcourse, yourself. We have always put the advice of the Mother Confessor aboveall others.”Kahlan sighed. “Tristan, I’m in no mood for your usual games. You and I havesparred in these chambers more times than I can remember. Don’t test me today.I’ll not have it.”Being a member of the royal family, he was well trained in all the arts of war,and had fought with distinction in the past. Broad-shouldered and tall. he cut ahandsome figure. His easy smile always carried a playful twist that cloaked anythreat, were there one. and there sometimes was. Kahlan never turned her back,so to speak, on Tristan Bashkar.He casually unbuttoned his dark blue coat and rested a hand on his hip. The ployrevealed an ornate knife sheathed at his belt. Kahlan had heard it whisperedthat, going into battle, Tristan Bashkar preferred to draw his knife rather thanhis sword. It was whispered, too, that he got sadistic pleasure from slicing theenemy.“Mother Confessor, I admit that in the past I’ve been reticent to reveal ourexact position in order to best protect our people from the avarice of otherlands; but it isn’t like that this time. You see, the way we view the situation”“I’m not interested. I want only to know if you stand with us or against us. Ifyou stand against us, Tristan, I give you my word that by morning we will havetroops riding for the royal palace in Sandilar, and they will return with eitherunconditional surrender, or the heads of the royal family.“General Baldwin is here in Aydindril with a sizable Keltish force. I’ll sendhim-Keltans never let down their queen, nor rest until she is satisfied. I amnow the queen of Kelton. Do you wish a fight with General Baldwin?”“Of course not. Mother Confessor. We wish no fight, but if you will hear me out”Kahlan slapped a hand to the desk, silencing him. “When the Imperial Order heldAydindril, before Richard liberated it, Jara sat on the council, allied with theOrder.”“As was D’Hara, at the time,” he gently reminded her.Kahlan glared at him. “I was brought before the council, and convicted of thevery crimes committed by the Order. Wizard Ranson, from the Order, called for adeath sentence. The councillor from Jara sat at this desk and voted to have mebeheaded.”“Mother Confessor...”Kahlan turned a finger to her right. “He sat right there and called for me to beput to death.”She looked back to Tristan’s brown eyes. “If you look closely, I think you willstill be able to pick out a stain down the front of the desk over there. WhenRichard liberated Aydindril, he executed those traitorous councillors. The stainwas left by the Jarian councillor. I heard that Richard cleaved the man nearlyin two, he was so angered by the betrayal to me, and to the people of theMidlands.”Tristan stood politely, showing nothing of his emotions. “Mother Confessor, itwas not by the choice of the royal family that that councillor spoke for Jara.He was a puppet of the Order.”“Then join with us.”“We want to, and we intended to. In fact, I was sent with authorization to makeit so.”“Whatever it is you want, Tristan, you’ll not get it. We make the same offer toall, and no special terms for any.”“Mother Confessor, would it be considered a special term to hear me out?” Kahlansighed. “Make it short, and keep in mind, Tristan, that your smile has no effecton me.”He smiled anyway. “As a member of the royal family, I have the authority, andauthorization, to surrender Jara and join with you. Given a choice, that is whatwe wish.”“Then do it.”“The red moon interrupts those plans.”Kahlan sat up straighter. “What does that have to do with it?”“Mother Confessor, Javas Kedar, our star guide, holds great sway with the royalfamily. He has read the stars in the matter of our surrender, and has given hisopinion that the stars hold this action with favor.“Before I left home, Javas Kedar told me that the stars would give sign ifcircumstances changed, and to heed any sign. The red moon has given me pause inour plans.”“The moon is not the stars.”“The moon is in the sky. Mother Confessor. Javas Kedar councils on the meaningof moon symbols, also.”Kahlan pinched the bridge of her nose between a thumb and finger as she sighed.“Tristan, are you going to allow harm to visit your people on the basis of suchsuperstition?”“No, Mother Confessor. But I am bound by my honor to give heed to the beliefs ofour people. Lord Rahl said that surrender would not mean that we had to give upour customs and beliefs.”“Tristan, you have an annoying habit of leaving out things you wish to ignore.Richard said that a land wouldn’t have to give up its customs as long as theybrought harm to no one, and broke no laws common to all. You are stepping over adangerous line.”“Mother Confessor, we in no way wish to circumvent his words or to step over anyline. I wish only some time.”“Time. Time for what?”“Time, Mother Confessor, to assure myself that the red moon isn’t a sign that wehave reason to fear joining with D’Hara. Now, I can either travel back to Jaraand consul’, with Javas Kedar, or I can simply wait here for a while, if youwould prefer, to assure myself that the red moon is not a sign of danger.”Kahlan knew that the Jarians. and the royal family in particular, were ferventbelievers in guidance from the stars. As much effort as Tristan devoted tochasing skirts, Kahlan knew that were a beautiful woman to offer him her charms,he would flee from her if he believed the stars were against it.It would take him at least a month to return to Jara, consult the star guide,and return to Aydindril.“How long would you have to wait in Aydindril before you felt comfortable andcould in good conscience surrender?”He frowned thoughtfully for a moment. “If Aydindril remained safe for a coupleof weeks after such a significant sign, then I would feel safe in knowing thatthe sign was not a bad portent.” Kahlan drummed her fingers. “You have twoweeks, Tristan. Not one day more.”“Thank you. Mother Confessor. I pray that in two weeks we can consummate ourunion with D’Hara.” He bowed. “Good day. Mother Confessor, and I look forward tothe stars remaining fair for us.”He took a step away, but turned back. “By the way, would you happen to know of aplace I can stay for such a length of time? Our palace was burned down in yourbattle with the Blood of the Fold. What with all the damage to Aydindril, I’mhaving difficulty in finding accommodations.”She knew what he was angling for-to be close so he could see if the stars struckout against D’Haran rule. The man thought too much of himself, thought himselfmore clever than he was.Kahlan smiled. “Oh yes, I know a place. You will stay right here, where we cankeep an eye on you until the two weeks are up.”He buttoned his blue coat. “Why, thank you, Mother Confessor, for yourhospitality. It is most appreciated.”“And, Tristan, while you are a guest under my roof, if you lay a finger, oranything else, on any of the women living and working here, I will see to itthat the anything else is cut off.”He laughed good-naturedly. “Mother Confessor, I never knew you believed thegossip about me. I’m afraid that I often have to resort to the charms of coinfor company, but I’m flattered that you would think me so talented at wooingyoung ladies. If I should break your rules, I would expect to be put on trialand subjected to your choice of punishment.” Trial.Richard said that the people who sent the Temple of the Winds away were put ontrial. In the Wizard’s Keep there were records of all trials held there. She hadnever read any of those books, but she had been told of them. Maybe they couldfind out from the records of the trial what happened to the Temple of the Winds.As Kahlan watched Tristan Bashkar departing behind a pair of guards, she thoughtabout Richard, and wondered what he would find. She wondered if he was about tolose another brother.Kahlan knew most of the women working at the Confessors’ Palace. The women atthe palace respected Richard as a man of honor. She wouldn’t like to think thatthey would be prey to a man who would win them by trading on their trust ofRichard.She felt a pang of sadness for Richard. She knew he was hoping that Drefan wouldbe a brother he could be proud of. Kahlan hoped that Drefan didn’t turn out tobe trouble. She remembered his hand on Cara.Kahlan turned to the Mord-Sith. “Three more with us, one lost, and one yet todecide.”Cara smiled conspiratorially. “A sister of the Agiel must be able to strike fearinto people’s hearts. Mother Confessor, you wear the Agiel well. I thought Icould hear some of their knees knocking all the way up here.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27Armor and weapons clattered and clanged as the soldiers following behind marchedup the steep cobbled street. Narrow houses, mostly three and four stories, satcheek by jowl, with the upper floors overhanging the lower so that the topmostalmost closed off the sky. It was a gloomy part of the city.Soldiers throughout the city had cheered their thanks as Richard passed, wishinghim good health and long life. Some had wanted to buy him a drink. Some had runup to bow before him and give the devotion: “Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahlteach us. Master Rahl protect us. In your light we thrive. In your mercy we aresheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve. Our lives areyours.”They had hailed him as a great wizard for protecting them and healing theirsickness. Richard felt more than a little uncomfortable at their acclaim: hehad. after all, simply instructed them to take well-known cures for intestinaldistress. He hadn’t worked any magic.He had tried to explain it wasn’t magic; that the things they ate and drank hadcured them. They would hear none of it. They had expected magic from him. and.in their eyes, they had gotten it. He had finally given up on explaining andtook to waving his thanks for their praises. Had they gone to an herb seller,they would no doubt be just as healthy, and complaining about the price.He had to admit, though, that it did make him feel good to know that he hadhelped people for a change instead of hurting them. He understood a little ofwhat Nadine must feel when she helped people with her herbs.He had been warned of a wizard’s need for balance. There was balance in allthings, but especially in magic. He could no longer eat meat-it made him sick-and suspected it was the gift seeking balance for the killing he sometimes hadto do. He liked to think that helping people was part of the balance in being awar wizard.Sullen people, going about their business, moved to the side of the crampedstreet, tramping through the dirty snow still in the sheltered places in orderto squeeze past the soldiers. Grim-looking groups of older boys and young menwatched warily and then vanished around corners as Richard and his escortapproached.Richard absently touched the gold-worked leather pouch on his belt. It containedwhite sorcerer’s sand that had been in the pouch when he found the belt in theKeep. Sorcerer’s sand was the crystallized bones of the wizards who had giventheir lives into the Towers of Perdition separating the Old and New Worlds. Itwas a sort of distilled magic. White sorcerer’s sand gave power to spells drawnwith it good and evil. The proper spell drawn in white sorcerer’s sand couldinvoke the Keeper. He touched the other gold-worked pouch on his belt. A littleleather purse tied securely inside contained black sorcerer’s sand. He hadgathered that sorcerer’s sand himself from one of the towers. No wizard sincethe towers were built had been able to gather any black sorcerer’s sand; itcould only be taken from a tower by one with Subtractive Magic.Black sorcerer’s sand was the counter to the white. They nullified each other.Even one grain of the black would contaminate a spell drawn with the white, evenone drawn to invoke the Keeper. He had used it to defeat Darken Rahl’s spiritand send him back to the underworld.Prelate Annalina had told him to guard the black sand with his life-that aspoonful of it was worth kingdoms. He possessed several kingdoms’ worth. Henever let the little leather purse containing the black sand out of his sight orhis reach.Children, layered with ragged clothes for warmth against the cold spring day,played catch-the-fox in the tightly hemmed street, running from doorway todoorway, giggling with glee at the prospect of finding the fox, and more so atseeing the impressive procession coming up their very own street. Even seeinghappy children didn’t bring a smile to Richard’s face. “This one. Lord Rahl,”General Kerson said.The general lifted a thumb to a door on the right, set back a few feet into theclapboard face of a building. The faded red paint was flaking off the bottom ofthe door where the weather worked on it the most. A small sign said: “LathertonRooming House.”A big, stocky man inside didn’t look up from a chair behind a rickety table setwith dry biscuits and a bottle. He stared at nothing with red-rimmed eyes. Hishair was dishevelled and his clothes rumpled. He seemed in a daze. Beyond himwas a stairway, and beside that a narrow hall that ran back into darkness.“Closed,” he murmured.“Are you Silas Latherton?” Richard asked, his gaze sweeping the clutter of dirtyclothes and bed sheets awaiting washing. A half dozen empty ewers sat againstthe wall, along with a stack of washrags.The man peered up from behind a puzzled frown. “Yeah. Who are you? You lookfamiliar.”“I’m Richard Rahl. Perhaps you see a resemblance to my brother, Drefan.”“Drefan.” The man’s eyes widened. “Lord Rahl.” His chair rasped noisily againstthe floor as he shoved it back and stood to bow. “Forgive me. I didn’t recognizeyou. I’ve never seen you before. I didn’t know that the healer was your brother.I beg the Lord Rahl’s forgiveness...”For the first time, Silas noticed the dark-haired Mord-Sith at Richard’s side,the muscled general at the other side, Richard’s two huge bodyguards toweringbehind him, and the phalanx of soldiers spilling out the doorway and into thestreet. He raked his greasy hair back and stood up straighter.“Show me the room where the... where the woman was murdered,” Richard said.Silas Latherton bowed twice before hurrying to the stairs, tucking in his shirtas he went. Checking over his shoulder to make sure Richard was following, heclimbed the stairs two at a time. They objected to his weight with creaks andgroans.He finally came to a halt before a door partway down a narrow hall. With thewalls painted red, the candles at either end of the hall provided littleillumination. The place stank.“In here. Lord Rahl.” Silas said.When he moved to open the door. Raina snatched his collar and pulled him backout of the way. She planted him in place with a sinister look. A look like thatfrom Raina was enough to give an angry cloud pause.She opened the door and, Agiel in hand, stepped into the room before Richard.Richard waited a moment while Raina checked the room for threat; it was easierthan objecting. Silas stared at the floor while Richard and General Kerson wentinto the little room. Ulic and Egan took up posts beside the door and foldedtheir massive arms.There wasn’t much to see: a bed, a small pine chest beside it, and a washstand.A dark stain discolored the unfinished spruce floorboards. The bloodstain ranunder the bed and covered nearly the entire floor.The size of it didn’t surprise him. The general had told him what had been doneto the woman.The water in the washbasin looked to be at least half blood. The rag hangingover its side was red with it. The killer had washed the blood from himselfbefore he left. He must either be neat or, more likely, didn’t want to walk outpast Silas Latherton dripping blood.Richard opened the pine chest. It contained orderly stacks of clothes, andnothing else. He let the lid drop back down.Richard leaned a hand against the doorway. “No one heard anything?” Silas shookhis head. “A woman is mutilated like that, has her breasts cut off. and isstabbed hundreds of times, and no one heard a thing?”Richard realized that his exhaustion was putting an edge to his voice. His moodwasn’t helping, either, he guessed.Silas swallowed. “She’d been gagged, Lord Rahl. Her hands were tied, too.”Richard scowled. “She must have kicked her feet. No one heard her kicking? Ifsomeone was slicing me up, and I was gagged and my hands were tied. I’d havekicked the washstand over at least. She must have kicked her feet trying to getsomeone’s attention.”“I didn’t hear it if she did. None of the other women heard it, either. Least,they never mentioned it, and I’d think they would have come got me if they’dheard anything like that. If there was trouble, they always came to me. Theyalways did. They know I’m not shy about protecting them.”Richard rubbed his eyes. The prophecy wouldn’t leave him be. He had a headache.“Bring the other women here. I want to talk to them.”“They left me, after-” Silas gestured vaguely. “Except Bridget.” He hurried tothe end of the hall and knocked on the last door. A woman with rumpled red hairpeered out after he spoke quietly to her. She withdrew back into her room and ina moment emerged, pulling a cream-colored robe closed. She tossed a quick knotin the tie as she followed Silas up the hall to Richard.Standing in the belly of a stinking whorehouse, Richard was getting more angrywith himself by the moment. Despite trying to be objective, he had begun to lethimself be happy about having a brother. He was beginning to like Drefan. Drefanwas a healer. What could be more noble?Silas and the woman bowed. They both looked the way Richard felt: dirty, tired,and distraught.“Did you hear anything?” Bridget shook her head. Her eyes looked haunted. “Didyou know the woman who died?”“Rose,” Bridget said. “I only met her once, for a few minutes. She just camehere yesterday.”“Do either of you have any idea who murdered her?” Silas and Bridget shared alook.“We know who did it. Lord Rahl,” Silas said, a smoldering tone welling in hisvoice. “Fat Harry.”“Fat Harry? Who’s that? Where can we find him?”For the first time, Silas Latherton’s features twisted in anger. “I shouldn’thave let him come here anymore. The women didn’t like him.”“None of us girls would take him anymore,” Bridget said. “He drinks, and when hedrinks, he gets mean. There’s no need to put up with that, not with the army...”Her words died out as she glanced to the general. She resumed with a differenttack. “We have enough clients nowadays. We don’t have to put up with mean drunkslike fat Harry.”“The women all told me that they wouldn’t see Harry no more,” Silas said. “Whenhe came last night, I knew that they would all say no. Harry was real insistent,and seemed sober enough, so I asked Rose if she’d see him, as she was newand...”“And didn’t know she was in danger,” Richard finished. “It wasn’t like that,”Silas said defensively. “Harry didn’t seem to be drunk. I knew the other womenwouldn’t take him, though, sober or not, so I asked Rose if she was interested.She said she could use the money. Harry was the last one with her. She was founda little while later.”“Where can we find this Harry?”Silas’s eyes narrowed. “In the underworld, where he belongs.”“You killed him?”“No one saw who slit his fat throat. I wouldn’t know who done it.” Richardglanced at the long knife tucked behind Silas’s belt. He didn’t blame the man.If they had captured fat Harry, he would get the same for his crime as hadalready been done. Although he would have had a trial first, and he could haveconfessed, just to be sure it was he who had done it.That was why they used Confessors: to be sure they had convicted the guilty man.Once touched by her magic, a criminal would confess all that he had done.Richard wouldn’t want Kahlan to hear what had been done to this woman. Rose.Especially not from the beast who had done it.It made him sick to his stomach to think of Kahlan having to touch a man likethat, a man who had killed a woman in such a brutal fashion. He feared he wouldhave killed Harry himself to keep Kahlan from having to touch the flesh of a manlike that.He knew she had touched other men who were no better. He didn’t want her to everhave to do that again. He knew it had to hurt her to hear such perverted crimesconfessed in detail. He feared to think what terrible memories haunted her andvisited her dreams.Richard forced his mind off it and looked at Bridget. “Why did you stay when theothers ran off?”She shrugged. “Some of them had children, and feared for them. I don’t faultthem their fears, but we were always safe here. Silas has always been fair tome. I’ve been hurt other places, but never here. It wasn’t Silas’s fault that acrazy killer did this. Silas always respected our wishes when we said wewouldn’t see a man again.”Richard felt his stomach tighten. “And you saw Drefan?”“Sure. All the girls saw Drefan.”“All the girls,” Richard repeated. He held a tight grip on his anger. “Yeah. Weall saw him. Except Rose. She never got a chance, ‘cause she...”“So, Drefan didn’t have a... favorite?” Richard had been hoping that Drefan hadconfined himself to one woman he liked, and that maybe she would be one who washealthy, at least.Bridget’s brow wrinkled up. “How can a healer have a favorite?”“Well, I mean, was there one he preferred, or did he just take who wasavailable?” The woman stuck a finger into her mat of red hair and scratched herscalp. “I think you got the wrong idea about Drefan, Lord Rahl. He never touchedus... in that way. He only came here to do his healing.”“He came here to heal?”“Yeah,” Bridget said. Silas nodded his agreement. “Half the girls had somethingor other. Rashes and sores and such. Most people who sell herbs and cures don’twant to help our kind, so we just live with our ailments.“Drefan told us how he wanted us to wash. He gave us herbs, and unguents to puton the sores. He came twice before, real late, after we was done, so as not tointerfere with us earning a living. He checked on the girls’ children, too.Drefan was special kind with the children. One had a bad cough, and he gotbetter after Drefan gave him something to take.“He came checking on us early this morning. After he saw one of the girls, hewent to Rose’s room, to check on her. That’s when he found her. He came flyingout of her room after what he saw and was calling out”-she pointed at the floorat Richard’s feet-”between throwing up. We all rushed out in the hall and sawhim there, on his knees, heaved his guts out right there.”“So he didn’t come here to... to... and he never-” Bridget guffawed. “Ioffered-no charge, since he helped me and all with what he gave me. He said thatthat wasn’t why he had come. He said he only wanted to help, that he was ahealer.“I offered, mind you, and I can be very persuasive”-she winked-”but he said no.He has a real handsome smile, he does. Just like yours. Lord Rahl.”“Enter,” came the response to Richard’s knock.Drefan was kneeling before his array of candles set about on the table againstthe wall. His head was bowed, and his hands were folded in supplication. “I hopeI’m not interrupting,” Richard said.Drefan looked back over his shoulder and then stood. His eyes reminded Richardof Darken Rahl. Drefan had the same blue eyes, with the same indefinably odd,unsettling look in them. Richard couldn’t help being disquieted by them. Itsometimes made him feel as if Darken Rahl himself were staring at him.People who had lived in fear of Darken Rahl were probably terrified when theylooked into Richard’s eyes, too. “What are you doing?” Richard asked.“Praying to the good spirits to watch over the soul of someone.”“Whose soul?”Drefan sighed. He looked tired and doleful. “The soul of a woman no one caredabout.”“A woman named Rose?”Drefan nodded. “How did you know about her?” He waved off his own question.“Forgive me-I wasn’t thinking. You’re the Lord Rahl. I expect you get reports ofsuch things.”“Yes, well, I do hear about things.” Richard spotted something new in the room.“I see you’ve taken to brightening up the decor.”Drefan saw where Richard was looking, and went to the chair beside the bed. Hereturned with a small pillow. He ran his fingers lovingly over the roseembroidered on it.“This was hers. They didn’t know where she came from, so Silas-he’s the man whoruns the house-Silas insisted I take this for the small help I offer the womenthere. I won’t accept their money. If they had money to spare, they wouldn’t bedoing what they do.”Richard wasn’t an expert, but the embroidered rose looked to be done with care.“Do you think she made it?”Drefan shrugged. “Silas didn’t know. Maybe she did. Maybe she saw it somewhereand bought it because it had a rose on it, like her name.” He gently nibbled histhumb back and forth across the rose as he stared at it. “Drefan, what are youdoing going to... to places like that? There’s no shortage of people needinghealing. We have soldiers here who were wounded down by the pit. There’s plentyfor you lo do. Why were you going to whorehouses?”Drefan dragged a finger down the stem of green thread. “I’m seeing to thesoldiers. I go on my own time, before people are up and need me.”“But why go there at all?”Drefan’s eyes welled with tears as he stared at the rose on the pillow. “Mymother was a whore,” he whispered. “I am the son of a whore. Some of those womenhave children. I could have been any one of them.“Just like Rose, my mother took the wrong man to her bed. No one knew Rose. Noone knew who she was, or where she came from. I don’t even know my own mother’sname-she wouldn’t tell the healers she left me with. Only that she was a whore.”“Drefan, I’m sorry. That was a pretty stupid question.”“No, it was a perfectly logical question. No one cares about those women, I meancares about them as people. They get beaten bloody by the men who come to them.They catch terrible diseases. They’re scorned by other people.“Herb sellers don’t want them coming into their shops-it gives them a reputationand then decent people won’t come around. Many of the things those women have,even I don’t know how to cure. They suffer sad, lingering deaths. Just formoney. Some of them are drunks, and the men prostitute them and pay them withliquor. They’re drunk all the time and don’t know the difference.“Some of them think they’ll find a rich man and be his mistress. They think theywill please him and gain his favor. Like my mother. Instead, they have bastardchildren, like me.”Richard was mentally wincing. He had been ready to believe that Drefan was anunfeeling opportunist. “Well, if it makes you feel any better. I’m the son ofthat bastard, too.”Drefan looked lip and smiled. “I guess so. At least your mother loved you. Minedidn’t. She didn’t even leave me her name.”“Don’t say that, Drefan. Your mother loved you. She took you to a place whereyou would be safe, didn’t she?”He nodded. “And left me there with people she didn’t know.”“But she left you because she had to, so that you would be safe. Can you imaginehow that must have hurt her? Can you imagine how it must have broken her heartto leave you with strangers? She must have loved you a great deal to do that foryou.”Drefan smiled. “Wise words, my brother. With a mind like that. you might makesomething of yourself, someday.”Richard returned the smile. “Sometimes, we have to do desperate things to savethe ones we love. I have a grandfather who has great admiration for acts ofdesperation. I think, with your mother. I’m beginning to understand what hemeans.”“Grandfather?”“My mother’s father.” Richard idly stroked a finger along the raised gold wirespelling out the word TRUTH On the hilt of his sword. “One of the greatest menI’ve ever had the honor of knowing. My mother died when I was young, and myfather-the man I thought was my father-was often gone on his business as atrader. Zedd practically raised me. I guess I’m more Zedd than anyone else.”Zedd had the gift. Richard had inherited the gift not only from Darken Rahl, butalso from Zedd, from his mother’s side as well as his father’s. From bothbloodlines. Richard found comfort in knowing that the gift of a good man flowedin his veins, and not just that of Darken Rahl. “Is he still living?”Richard looked away from Drefan’s blue. Darken Rahl eyes. “I believe he is. Idon’t think anyone else does, but I do. Sometimes I feel like if I don’tbelieve, then he will be dead.”Drefan laid a hand on Richard’s shoulder. “Then keep believing; you may beright. You’re fortunate to have a family. I know, because I don’t.”“You do now, Drefan. You have a brother, at least, and soon a sister-in-law.”“Thanks, Richard. That means a lot to me.”“How about you? I hear you have half the women in the palace chasing after you.Any of them special?”Drefan smiled distantly. “Girls, that’s all. Girls who think they know what theywant and are impressed by foolish things that shouldn’t matter. I see them allbatting their eyelashes at you, too. Some people are drawn to power. People likemy mother.”“Me! You’re seeing things.”Drefan turned serious. “Kahlan is beautiful. You’re a fortunate man to have awoman of such substance and noble character. A woman like that only comes alongonce in a lifetime, and then only if the good spirits smile on you.”“I know. I’m the luckiest man alive.” Richard stared off. thinking about theprophecy, and the things he had read in Kolo’s journal. “Life wouldn’t be worthliving without her.”Drefan laughed and slapped Richard on the back. “If you weren’t my brother, anda good one besides. I’d steal her from you and have her for myself. On secondthought, you’d better be careful, I may yet decide to have her.” Richard smiledwith him. “I’ll be careful.”Drefan pointed an admonishing finger at Richard. “You treat her right.”“I’d not know how lo do otherwise.” Richard swept a hand out, indicating thesmall, simple room, and changed the subject. “What are you still doing here? Wecan find you better quarters than this.”Drefan gazed about at his room. “This is a king’s room compared to my quartersat home. We live simply. This room is almost more ostentation than I can bear.”His brow drew down. “It isn’t what kind of house you have that matters. This isnot happiness. It’s what kind of mind you have, and how you care for your fellowman-what you can do to help others who can be helped by no one else.”Richard adjusted the bands at his wrists. They made him sweat under the leatherpads. “You’re right, Drefan.”He hadn’t even realized it, but he had come to be used to his surroundings.Since he had left Hartland, he had seen many splendid places. His own home, backin Hartland, wasn’t nearly as nice as this plain room, and he had been happythere. He had been happy being a woods guide.But, as Drefan said, a person had to help others who could be helped in no otherway. He was stuck with being Lord Rahl. Kahlan was the balance. Now, all he hadto do was find the Temple of the Winds before he lost it all.At least he had a woman he loved more than he would ever have thought possible,and now, too, he had a brother. “Drefan, do you know the meaning of Raug’Moss?”“I was taught that it’s old High D’Haran, meaning ‘Divine Wind’”“Do you know High D’Haran?”Drefan brushed back his tumbled-down blond hair. “Just that word.”“I hear that you’re their leader. You’ve done well for yourself to become theleader of a community of healers.”“It’s the only life I’ve ever known. Being the High Priest, though, mostly meansthat they have someone to blame when things go wrong. If someone we try to helpdoesn’t gel better, the healers point in my direction and say, ‘He is ourleader. Talk to him.’ Being High Priest means I have to read the reports andrecords, and try to explain to distraught relatives that we are only healers,and we can’t revoke the Keeper’s call. Sounds more impressive than it is,really.”“I’m sure you exaggerate. I’m proud that you’ve done well. What are theRaug’Moss? Where do they come from?”“Legend has it that the Raug’Moss were founded thousands of years ago by wizardswhose gift was for healing. The gift began dying out in the race of man, andwizards, especially ones gifted for healing, became more and more rare.”Drefan told Richard the story of how the community of the Raug’Moss started tochange as wizards began dying out. Worried that their work would die out withthem, the healers, the wizard healers, decided to take in apprentices withoutthe gift. Over time, there were fewer and fewer wizards to oversee the work,until long ago the last of the wizards died.It sounded to Richard much like reading in Kolo’s journal how different the Keephad been in that time long past when it was filled with wizards and theirfamilies.“Now, there are no gifted among us,” Drefan said. “The Raug’Moss were taughtmany keys of health and healing, but we have nowhere near the talent of thewizards of old; we have no magic to aid us. We do what we can, with theteachings the true healers of old passed down, but we can only do so much. It’sa simple life. a hard life. but it has rewards that comforts of belongings can’tprovide.”“I understand. It must be the best feeling in the world to help people.”Drefan’s face took on a curious set. “What of you? What is your gift? Yourtalent?”Richard looked away from Drefan’s eyes. His hand tightened on the hilt of hissword.“I was born a war wizard,” he whispered. “I have been named fuer- grissa ostdrauka. High D’Haran for ‘the bringer of death.’ The room fell quiet.Richard cleared his throat. “I was pretty distraught by that. at first, butsince then I’ve come to understand that being a war wizard means that I havebeen born to help others, by protecting them from those who would enslave them.From those like our bastard father-Darken Rahl.”“I understand.” Drefan said into the uneasy silence. “Sometimes the best use ofour ability is to kill-such as to end a life that has no hope but pain. or toend the life of one who would bring endless pain to others.”Richard rubbed a thumb over the symbols on the silver bands at his wrist. “Yes.I understand what you mean by that. now. I don’t think I did. before. We bothmust do things that we don’t like, but which must be done.”Drefan smiled a small smile. “Not many, other than my healers, ever understandit. I’m glad you do. Sometimes killing is the greatest of charity. I am carefulto whom I speak those words. It is good to have my brother understand them.”“The same with me, Drefan.”Before Richard could ask more, they were interrupted by a knock at the door.Raina poked her head in. Her long, dark braid fell forward over her shoulder.“Lord Rahl, do you have a moment?”“What is it. Raina?”Raina rolled her eyes, indicating someone behind her. “Nadine wishes to see you.She seems upset about something, and will only speak to you.”When Richard gestured, Raina opened the door a little wider and Nadine pushedher way in, oblivious to Raina’s scowl.“Richard. You have to come with me.” She took up his hand in both of hers.“Please? Please, Richard, come with me? There’s someone here who desperatelyneeds to see you.”“Who?”She looked to be genuinely troubled. She tugged on his hand. “Please, Richard.”Richard was still wary. “Mind if I bring Drefan along?”“Of course not. I was going to ask that you did.”“Let’s go, then, if it’s really important.” She held his hand tight and draggedhim behind her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28Richard spotted Kahlan coming down the hall toward him. She frowned at seeingNadine pulling him along by the hand. Drefan, Raina, Ulic, and Egan trailedbehind him as they all wove their way past palace staff going about theirchores, and soldiers on patrol. Richard shrugged to Kahlan.Nadine glared at Kahlan before turning down the hall toward her room. Hewondered what that was all about. Annoyed, Richard yanked his hand away fromNadine’s grip, but kept following. Nadine skirted a walnut table against thewall beneath an old tapestry with a herd of white-tailed deer grazing beforewhite-peaked mountains in the background. She checked over her shoulder to makesure Richard was still with her.Kahlan and Cara caught up. Kahlan fell in beside him.“Well,” Cara said from behind, as she stroked her thick braid, “doesn’t thislook interesting?”Richard shot her a scowl. Nadine turned and impatiently snatched his hand again.“You promised. Come on.”“I promised nothing. I said I’d go with you,” Richard complained. “I didn’t sayI would run.”“Big strong Lord Rahl can’t keep up with me?” Nadine taunted. “The woods guide Iremember could walk faster than this when he was half asleep.”“I am half asleep,” he muttered.“The guards told me you were back, and had gone to Drefan’s room,” Kahlanwhispered to him. “I was on my way to meet you there. What’s this business withNadine?”Her whispered question was laced with aggravation. He noticed her quick glanceto Nadine’s hand gripping his. “Beats me. She wants me to see someone.”“And must you hold her hand to do it?” she growled under her breath. He yankedhis hand away again.Kahlan stole a quick peek at Drefan, back behind Cara and Raina. She twined herarm through Richard’s. “How are you doing? What did you... find out?”Richard put his hand over hers and gave it a squeeze. “Everything is fine,” hewhispered to her. “It wasn’t what I thought. I’ll tell you about it later.”“What about the murderer? Has anyone found him yet?”“Yes, someone found him, and murdered him for his crime,” Richard told her.“What about the representatives? Did you take care of it?”Her answer was a moment in coming. “Grennidon, Togressa, and Pendisan Reachsurrendered. Jara may yet, but they wish to wait for two weeks for a sign fromthe sky,” Richard frowned. “Mardovia refused to join with us. They choose toremain neutral.”Richard jerked to a halt. “What!” Everyone marching behind almost lurched intohim. “They refuse to surrender. They claim to be neutral.”“The Order doesn’t recognize neutrality. Neither do we. Didn’t you tell themthat?”Kahlan’s face showed nothing. “Of course I did.” Richard hadn’t meant to yell ather. He was angry at Mardovia. not her. “General Reibisch is in the south. Maybewe could have him take Mardovia before the Order grinds them into carrion.”“Richard, they were given a chance. They are now the walking dead. We can’twaste the lives of our soldiers to take Mardovia just so that we might protectthem. It would serve no purpose and it would weaken our effort.”Nadine pushed between them and glared at Kahlan. “You talked to that evilJagang. You know what he’s like. Those people will all die if you leave them tothe Order. You just don’t care about the lives of innocent people. You’reheartless.”From the corner of his eye, Richard saw a red flash as Cara’s Agiel spun up intoher hand.Richard shoved Nadine on ahead of him. “Kahlan is right. It just took a momentfor it to sink in through my thick skull. Mardovia has chosen their own path:they must walk it. Now, if you want to show me someone, then show me. I haveimportant things to do.”Nadine huffed, flipped her thick brown hair back over her shoulder, and marchedon. Cara and Raina were scowling at the back of her head. A scowl from aMord-Sith was more often than not prelude to a serious consequence. Richard hadprobably just spared Nadine that consequence. Someday, he was going to have todo something about Shota. Before Kahlan tried.Richard leaned toward Kahlan. “I’m sorry. I’m dead tired and I just wasn’tthinking.”She squeezed his arm. “You promised you would get some sleep, remember?”“Soon as I see to this business with Nadine, whatever it is.” At the door to herroom, Nadine snatched Richard’s hand again and tugged him in. Before he couldobject, he saw the boy sitting on a red chair. Richard thought he recognized himas one of the Ja’La players he had watched.The boy was shuddering in tears. When he saw Richard coming into the room, hejumped down off the chair and swiped the floppy wool hat from his head of blondhair. He stood crushing his hat in his fists, trembling expectantly, tearscoursing down his face.Richard crouched down before the boy. “I’m Lord Rahl. I hear you need to see me.What’s your name?”He wiped his nose. The tears kept coming. “Yonick.”“There now, Yonick, what’s the matter?”He could only get out the word “brother” before succumbing to gasping sobs.Richard took the boy in his arms and comforted him. He wept in racking sobs ashe clung to Richard. His misery was heartbreaking. “Can you tell me what’s thematter, Yonick?”“Please, Father Rahl, my brother’s sick. Real sick.”Richard stood the boy on his feet before him. “He is? What’s he sick with?”“I don’t know,” Yonick cried. “We bought him herbs. We tried everything. He’s sosick. He’s just been getting worse since I came to see you before.”“Since you came to see me before?”“Yes,” Nadine snapped. “He came begging for your help a few days ago.” Nadinethrust a finger at Kahlan. “She sent him away.” Kahlan’s face went crimson. Herjaw worked, but no words came out. “All she cares about are her armies andfighting wars and hurting people. She doesn’t care about a miserable little boywho’s sick. She would only care if he was some fancy, important diplomat. Shedoesn’t know what it is to be poor and sick.” With a glare, Richard froze Cara’sadvance. He turned and glared at Nadine. “That’s enough.”Drefan laid a hand on Kahlan’s shoulder. “I’m sure you had a good reason. Youcouldn’t have known how sick his brother was. No one is blaming you.”Richard turned back to the boy. “Yonick, my brother here, Drefan, is a healer.Take us to your brother, and we’ll see if we can’t help him.”“And I have herbs,” Nadine said. “I’ll help your brother, too, Yonick. We’ll doeverything we can. We promise.” Yonick wiped his eyes. “Please hurry. Kip isreal sick.” Kahlan looked on the verge of tears. Richard put a hand tenderly toher back. He could feel her trembling. He feared how sick the boy’s brothermight be, and wanted to spare her seeing it. He feared she might blame herself.“Why don’t you wait here while we see to this.”Her wet green eyes flashed up at him. “I’m going,” she said through grittedteeth.Richard gave up trying to remember the warren of narrow streets and twistingalleys they went down, and simply noted where the sun was in the sky in order tokeep his bearings as Yonick led them through a maze of buildings and walledcourtyards hung with laundry.Chickens flapped and squawked as they scattered out of the way. Some of thetiny, walled courtyards held a few goats, or sheep, or a pig or two. The animalsseemed incongruous amid the tightly packed buildings.Overhead, people carried on conversations from opposing windows. Some leaned outon elbows to have a look at the procession led by a boy. It created quite astir. Richard knew that it was the sight of Lord Rahl, dressed in his black warwizard’s outfit with a gold cloak billowing out behind, and the Mother Confessorin her pristine white dress, that was the object of wonder, rather than the knotof soldiers or two Mord-Sith-soldiers were common, and the city people probablydidn’t have a clue as to who the two women in brown leather were.People in the streets and alleyways pushed their carts of vegetables, wood, orhousehold goods to the side to get out of the way. Others stood against thewalls and watched, as if it were a miniature, impromptu parade unexpectedlycoming through their neighborhood.At intersections, soldiers on patrol cheered their Lord Rahl, and called outtheir thanks for his curing their ailment.Richard held a light grip on Kahlan’s hand. She hadn’t spoken a word since theyleft the palace. He had made Nadine walk behind, between the two Mord-Sith. Hehoped Nadine knew enough to keep her mouth shut. Yonick pointed. “Just upthere.” They followed him as he turned from the street down a narrow alleybetween stone walls forming the bottom floors of houses, with wood above for thesecond story. Water dripping from melting snow overhead splashed mud from thealley a few feet up onto the stone. With one hand, Kahlan held Richard’s, andwith the other she held the hem of her dress up as she followed him down theline of boards laid in the mud.Yonick paused at a door under a small shed roof. People peered out windows toeach side. When Richard caught up, Yonick opened the door and ran up the stairs,calling out for his mother.A door at the top of the stairs squeaked open. A woman in a brown dress andwhite apron stared down at the boy running up the stairs. “Ma-it’s Lord Rahl! Ibrought Lord Rahl!”“The good spirits be praised,” she said.She rested a weary hand on her son’s back as he threw his arms around her waist.She lifted her other hand toward a doorway at the rear of the small room used askitchen, dining room, and living area.“Thank you for coming,” she mumbled to Richard, but she broke down in tearsbefore she could finish.Yonick ran for the back room. “This way. Lord Rahl.” Richard squeezed thewoman’s arm to reassure her as he swept past, following Yonick. Kahlan stillgripped his other hand. Nadine and Drefan followed on their heels, with Cara andRaina close behind. Yonick balked at the bedroom door as the rest of thementered.A single candle on a small table struggled to ward off the shroud of darkness. Abasin of water and soapy rags stood vigil beside the candle. The rest of theroom, mostly taken up with three pallets, seemed to be waiting for the candle’sdiligence to flag, so night could seize the room.A small figure lay on the far pallet. Richard, Kahlan, Nadine, and Drefancrowded in beside it. Yonick and his mother, silhouetted by the light frombeyond the door, stood at the brink of the darkness, watching. The room stanklike rotting meat.Drefan pushed back the hood of his flaxen cloak. “Open the shutters so I cansee.”Cara drew both open and folded them against the wall, allowing the light toflood into the tiny room and reveal a blond-headed boy covered to his neck witha white sheet and blanket. The side of his neck, just above the sheet, wasgrossly distended. His uneven breaths rattled. “What’s his name?” Drefan calledback to the mother. “Kip,” she said in a whining cry.Drefan patted the boy’s shoulder. “We’re here to help you. Kip.” Nadine leanedin. “Yes, Kip, we’ll have you up and about in no time.” She put her hand backover her mouth and nose against the smell of rot that gagged them all.The boy didn’t respond. His eyes were closed. His sweaty hair was plasteredagainst his forehead.Drefan drew the bed covers down to Kip’s waist, below his hands resting on hisstomach. The boy’s fingertips were black. Drefan stiffened. “Dear spirits,” hebreathed.He rocked back on his heels and touched the back of his hand to the legs of thetwo Mord-Sith towering behind them.“Get Richard out of here,” he whispered urgently. “Get him out, now.” Withoutquestioning, Cara and Raina thrust hands under Richard’s arms and started topull him up. Richard jerked away from their grip. “What’s going on?” hedemanded. “What’s the matter?” Drefan wiped a hand across his mouth. He glancedover his shoulder at the mother and Yonick. His gaze took in the rest of thembefore settling on Richard. He leaned closer. “This boy has the plague.” Richardstared at him. “What do we have to do to cure him?”Drefan lifted an eyebrow. He turned back to the boy, elevating a little hand.“Look at his fingers.” The fingertips were black. He pulled the bedcover aside.“Look at his toes.” His toes were black. He opened the boy’s trousers. “Look athis penis.” The tip of it was black, too.“That’s gangrene. It rots the extremities. This is why they call it the blackdeath.”Richard cleared his throat. “What can we do for him?” Drefan’s voice loweredeven more with incredulity. “Richard, did you hear what I said? Black death.People sometimes recover from the plague, but not when it’s this advanced.”“If we would have gotten to him sooner...” Nadine’s imputation trailed off.Kahlan’s grip on Richard’s forearm tightened painfully. He heard her stifle acry.Richard glared at Nadine. She looked away. “And do you know how to cure theplague, herb woman?” Drefan sneered. “Well, I-” Nadine blushed and fell silent.The boy’s eyes fluttered open. His head rolled toward them. “Lord... Rahl,” hesaid with a shallow breath. Richard put a hand on his shoulder. “Yes, Kip. Icame to see you. I’m here.” Kip nodded the slightest bit. “I waited.” His chestrested longer between each breath.“What can you do lo help?” came a tearful question from the doorway. “How soonwill he be well again?”Drefan opened the collar of his white, ruffled shirt as he leaned close toRichard. “Say something comforting to the boy-that’s all we can do. He won’tlast long. I’ll go talk to the mother. It’s part of the job of healer.”Drefan stood, pulling Nadine away with him. Kahlan was leaning against Richard’sshoulder. He feared looking at her, lest she break down in tears. Lest he breakdown in tears.“Kip, you’ll be up and playing Ja’La soon. You’ll be getting over this any daynow. I’d like to come watch another of your Ja’La games. I promise to come, justas soon as you’re better.”A faint smile passed over the boy’s face. His eyelids closed partway. His ribssank as breath abandoned his lungs.Richard crouched, feeling his heart pounding, as he waited for the boy’s lungsto fill again. They didn’t.Silence settled into the room, patiently waiting for darkness to return. Richardcould hear the wheels of a handcart outside squeaking, and the distant, raucouscry of ravens. The music of children’s laughter drifted in the air.This child would never laugh again. Kahlan’s head fell against his shoulder.Soft sobs claimed her as she clutched his sleeve.Richard reached over to pull the sheet over the body. The boy’s hand rose slowlyoff his stomach. Richard froze. The hand floated purposefully to Richard’sthroat. The black fingers curled, gathering Richard’s shirt in a death grip,Kahlan had fallen silent. They both knew that the boy had died. The boy’s handdrew Richard closer. The long-silent lungs filled once more with a breath.Richard, the hair at the base of his neck stiffening, put his ear close. “Thewinds.” the dead boy whispered, “hunt you.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29Richard stared in a daze as Drefan wrapped the dead boy in the sheet. OnlyRichard and Kahlan had seen what had happened-had heard what the dead boy hadsaid. Behind him, in the outer room, the mother wailed in anguish. Drefan leanedclose to him. “Richard.” Drefan touched his arm. “Richard.” Richard started.“What?”“What do you want to do?”“Do? What do you mean?”Drefan glanced over his shoulder at the rest of them back by the door. “What doyou want to tell people about this? I mean, he died of the plague. Do you wantto try to keep it a secret?” Richard couldn’t seem to make his mind work.Kahlan leaned past Richard. “A secret? Why would we want to do that?” Drefantook a deep breath. “Well, word of a plague might cause a panic. If we letpeople know, believe me, word of it will beat us back to the palace.”“Do you think others have it?” she asked.Drefan shrugged. “I doubt there would be only one isolated case. We have to buryor burn the body at once. His bedcovers, bed, and anything else he touchedshould be burned. The room should be treated with smoke.”“Won’t people want to know why that’s being done?” Richard asked. “Won’t theyguess the reason?”“Probably.”“Then how could it be kept a secret?”“You’re the Lord Rahl. Your word is law. You would have to suppress anyinformation. Arrest the family. Accuse them of a crime. Have them held untilthis is over. Have the soldiers carry off all their possessions to be burned andshut up their home.”Richard closed his eyes and pressed his fingertips to them. He was the Seeker ofTruth, not the suppressor of it.“We can’t do that to a family who just lost a boy. I won’t do that. Besides,wouldn’t it be better if people knew? Don’t people have a right to know of thedanger they’re in?”Drefan nodded. “If it were my decision, I would want people to know. I’ve seenthe plague before, in small places. Some have tried to suppress the knowledge ofit to prevent panic, but when more people started dying, it couldn’t be kept asecret.”Richard felt as though the sky had fallen on him. He struggled to make his mindwork, but the dead boy’s words kept echoing around in his head. The winds huntyou.“If we try to lie to people, they won’t believe anything we say. We have to tellthem the truth. They’ve a right to know.”“I agree with Richard,” Kahlan said. “We shouldn’t try to deceive people,especially about something that could endanger their lives.”Drefan nodded his concurrence. “We’re fortunate, at least, with the time ofyear. Plague is worst in the heat of summer. It could run rampant if this weresummer. In the colder weather of the spring it shouldn’t be able to get a goodfoothold. With luck, the outbreak of plague will be weak and soon over.”“Luck,” Richard muttered. “Luck is for dreamers. I only have nightmares. We haveto warn people.”Drefan’s blue eyes looked to each in turn. “I understand, and I agree with yourreasoning. The problem is. there’s not much to be done, other than burying thedead quickly and burning their things. There are remedies, but I fear they areof limited value.“I just want to warn you: news of plague will spread like a firestorm.”Richard’s flesh prickled with goose flesh. On the red moon will come thefirestorm.“Dear spirits spare us,” Kahlan whispered. She was thinking the same as he.Richard sprang up. “Yonick.” He crossed the room, rather than make the boy cometo his dead brother.“Yes, Lord Rahl?” His brow creased as he struggled to hold back his tears.Richard put one knee to the floor and held the boy’s shoulders. “Yonick, I’m sosorry. But your brother isn’t suffering any longer. He’s with the good spiritsnow. He’s at peace, and hoping we will remember the good times with him, and notbe too sad. The good spirits will watch over him.” Yonick brushed his blond hairaside. “But...I...”“I don’t want you to blame yourself. Nothing could have been done. Nothing.Sometimes people get sick, and none of us has the power to make them well. Noone could have done anything. Even if you had brought me right at the first, wecouldn’t have done anything.”“But you have magic.”Richard felt heartsick. “Not for this,” he whispered.Richard hugged Yonick for a moment. In the room beyond, the mother wept ontoRaina’s shoulder. Nadine was wrapping up some herbs for the woman, and givingher instructions. The woman nodded against Raina’s shoulder as she listened andsobbed.“Yonick, I need your help. I need to go see the other boys on your Ja’La team.Can you take us to their homes?” Yonick wiped his sleeve across his nose. “Why?”“I’m afraid they might be sick, too. We have to know.” Yonick glanced back athis mother with unspoken concern. Richard gestured for Cara.“Yonick, where’s your father?”“He’s a felt maker. He works down the street and three over to the right. Heworks until late every day.”Richard stood. “Cara. have some soldiers go and get Yonick’s father. He shouldbe here with his wife right now. Have a couple of soldiers take his place fortoday and tomorrow and help out as best they can, so that his family won’t losethe income. Tell Raina to stay here with her until Yonick’s father comes home.It shouldn’t be long, then she can catch up with us.” At the bottom of thestairs, Kahlan clutched his arm, holding him back, and asked Drefan and Nadineto wait outside with Yonick while Cara went to find his father. Kahlan closedthe door to the alley, leaving Richard alone with her at the bottom of the dimstairwell.She wiped the tears from her cheeks with trembling fingers. Her green eyes letslip more.“Richard.” She swallowed and gasped a breath. “Richard, I didn’t know. There wasMarlin, and the Sister of the Dark... I never knew that Yonick’s brother was sosick, or I would never-”Richard held up a finger to silence her. He realized, though, by the dread inher eyes, that his scowl was what had silenced her.“Don’t you dare dignify Nadine’s cruel lies with an explanation. Don’t you dare.I know you, and would never believe such things about you. Never.”She closed her eyes with relief and fell against his chest. “That poor child,”she wept.He stroked a hand down her long, thick hair. “I know.”“Richard, we both heard what that boy said after he died.”“Another warning that the Temple of the Winds has been violated.” She pushedherself back. Her green eyes searched his.“Richard, we have to reconsider everything now. What you were telling me aboutthe Temple of the Winds was only one source and not an official one at that. Itwas just a journal kept by one man to keep himself occupied while he guarded thesliph. Besides that, you’ve only read parts of it, and it’s in High D’Haran,which is difficult to translate accurately. You may have been getting the wrongidea about the Temple of the Winds from the journal.”“Well, I don’t know that I would agree-”“You’re dead tired. You’re not thinking. We now know the truth. The Temple ofthe Winds isn’t trying to send a warning-it’s trying to kill you.”Richard took pause at the concern on her face. Besides the grief he saw in hereyes, he saw disquiet. Disquiet for him.“Kolo didn’t make it sound like that was what was happening. From what I’veread, I think the red moon is a warning that the Temple of the Winds has beenviolated. When the red moon came before-”“Kolo said everyone was in an uproar. He didn’t explain the uproar, did he?Maybe it was because the temple was trying to kill them. Kolo said that the teamwho had sent the Temple of the Winds away had betrayed them.“Richard, face the facts. That dead boy just delivered a threat from the Templeof the Winds: ‘The winds hunt you.’ You hunt something when you want to kill it.The Temple of the Winds is hunting you-trying to kill you.”“Then why didn’t it kill me, instead of the boy?” She didn’t have an answer.Out in the alley, Drefan’s blue. Darken Rahl eyes watched Richard and Kahlanreturning over the boards in the mud. It seemed as if the process of deepreflection could be glimpsed through those eyes. Richard guessed that healershad to be keen observers of people, but those eyes made him feel somehow naked.At least he saw no magic in them.Nadine and Yonick waited in mute anxiety. Richard whispered to Kahlan to waitwith Drefan and Yonick. He took Nadine’s arm. “Nadine, would you come with me amoment, please?” She beamed up at him. “Sure, Richard.”He helped her step up into the stairwell. As Richard closed the door. she fussedwith her hair.When the door was shut, he turned to the smiling Nadine and slammed her backagainst the wall so hard it drove the wind from her lungs. She pushed off thewall. “Richard-”He seized her by the throat and smacked her against the wall again, holding herthere.“You and I were never going to be married.” The sword’s magic, its fury, wasbleeding into his voice. It was coursing through his veins. “We never are goingto be married. I love Kahlan. I am going to marry Kahlan. The only reason youare still here is because you are somehow tangled in this. You are going toremain here, for now, until we can figure it out.“I can, and I have, forgiven you for what you did to me. but if you ever againsay or do anything so cruel and deliberately hurtful to Kahlan, you will spendthe rest of your time in Aydindril down in the pit. Do you understand me!”Nadine put her fingers tenderly to his forearm. She smiled patiently, as if shethought he didn’t fully grasp the situation, and she would make him see herreasoned side of it.“Richard, I know you’re upset right now, everyone is, but I was only trying towarn you. I didn’t want you to be unaware of what had happened. I only wantedyou to know the truth about what she had-” He slammed her against the wallagain. “Do you understand me!” She watched his eyes a moment. “Yes,” she said,as if believing that there was no use in trying to reason with him until hecooled off.It only made Richard more angry. He struggled to rein it in so that he could getacross to her that this was more than anger and that he meant what he wassaying.“I know you have good in you, Nadine. I know that you care about people. We werefriends back in Hartland, so I’m going to let this go with a warning. You hadbetter mind my words. There is trouble about. A lot of people are going to needhelp. You always wanted to help people. I’m giving you your chance to do that. Ican use your help.“But Kahlan is the woman I love and the woman I’m going to marry. I won’t haveyou trying to change that, or trying to hurt her. Don’t you so much as think totest this again, or I will find another herb woman to help. Are you clear onthat?”“Yes, Richard. Whatever you say. I promise. If she’s what you really want, thenI’ll not interfere, no matter how wrong-”He held up a finger. “Your toe is on the line, Nadine. If you step over it, Iswear there will be no coming back.”“Yes, Richard.” She smiled in an understanding, patient, long-suffering way.“Whatever you say.”She seemed to be satisfied that he had paid attention to her. It reminded him ofa child who misbehaved so that a beloved parent would notice her. He glared ather until he was sure she would not say another word. and only then did he openthe door.Drefan was squatted down, whispering words of comfort to Yonick while he resteda hand on the boy’s shoulder. Kahlan’s green eyes watched as Nadine reached backfor Richard’s hand to help her balance as she stepped onto the narrow board inthe mud.“Drefan,” Richard said when he had joined them, “I need to talk to you aboutsome of the things you said in there.”Drefan rubbed Yonick’s back and then stood. “What things?”“About how you wanted Cara and Raina to get me out of there, for one thing. Iwant to know why.”Drefan considered Richard a moment, and then Yonick. He drew open his cloak,hooking it behind one of the leather pouches on his belt. He opened the pouch atthe front of his belt and poured some dried powder from a leather purse onto apiece of paper. He twisted the paper closed and handed it to the boy.“Yonick, before we go to see the other boys, would you please take this up toyour mother and tell her to steep it in hot water for a couple of hours to makea tea, and then strain it and see that everyone in your family drinks ittonight? It will help build up your family’s strength to keep them well.”Yonick looked at the paper in his hand. “Sure. I’ll be back as soon as I tell mymother.”“No rush,” Drefan said. “We’ll be waiting when you’re through.” Richard watchedYonick close the door. “All right, I know you wanted me out of there because ofthe danger of catching the plague from the sick boy. But we’re all in danger,aren’t we?”“Yes, but I don’t know how much. You are the Lord Rahl. I wanted you as far awayas possible.”“How do you catch the plague?”Drefan glanced to Kahlan and Nadine, and then to Ulic and Egan back with thesoldiers guarding either end of the alley. He took a deep breath.“No one knows how the plague is passed from one person to the next, or even ifthat is the way it spreads. There are some who believe that it’s the wrath ofthe spirits brought down on us, and the spirits decide who they will smite.There are others who argue that the effluvia infest the very air of a place, ofa city, endangering everyone. Others insist that it can only be caught byinhaling the infectious steams of the body of a sick person.“I can only assume, for the sake of caution, that, like fire, the closer youare, the more dangerous it is. I didn’t want you close to that danger, that’sall.”Richard was so tired that he felt sick. Only his terror kept him on his feet.Kahlan had been near the boy, too.“So, you’re saying that it’s possible we could all get it just from being in thesame house as someone who has it.”“It’s possible.”“But the sick boy’s family doesn’t have it, and they lived with him. His mothertended to him. Wouldn’t she have it, at least, if that were true?”Drefan considered his words carefully. “Several times I have seen isolatedoutbreaks of the plague. One time, when I was young and in training, I went withan older healer to a town, Castaglen Crossing, that had been visited with theplague. From this place, I learned much of what I know about the sickness.“It started when a merchant came with his wagon of goods to sell. It wasreported that when he arrived, he was coughing, vomiting, and complaining ofagonizing headaches. In other words, the plague was already upon him before hearrived in Castaglen Crossing. We never knew where he came to have it, but itcould have been that he drank envenomed water, stayed with a sick farmer, orthat the spirits chose to strike him with it.“The townspeople, wishing to do a trusted merchant a kindness, put him up in aroom, where he died the next morning. Everyone remained well for a time, andthey thought the danger had passed them by. They soon Forgot about the man whohad died among them.“Because of the confusion brought on by the sickness and death by the time wearrived, the accounts were varied, but we were able to determine that the firsttownsperson became sick with the plague at least fourteen days, by someaccounts, or as many as twenty days, by others, after the merchant arrived.”Richard pinched his lower lip as he thought. “Kip was well at the Ja’La game afew days back, so that would mean that he really became ill with it sometimebefore.”Despite being mournful over the boy’s death. Richard felt great relief that whathe had been thinking didn’t seem to be plausible. If Kip got the plague longbefore the Ja’La game. then Jagang didn’t have anything to do with it. Theprophecy wasn’t involved.But then, why the warning of the winds hunting him?“That would also mean,” Drefan said, “that the dead boy’s family may yet becomesick. They look well at the moment, but they may already be fatally infectedwith plague. Just as were the people of Castaglen Crossing.”“Then.” Nadine said, “we may all have caught it just from being in the room withthe boy. That awful smell was his sickness. We may all have the plague frombreathing it in. but won’t know it for a couple of weeks yet.”Drefan shot her a condescending look. “I can’t deny that it’s possible. Do youwish to run away, herb woman, and spend the next two or three weeks preparingfor death by living out the things you always wanted to do?” Nadine lifted herchin. “No. I’m a healer. I intend to help.” Drefan smiled in that private,knowing way he had. “Good. then. A true healer is above the phantom evils hechases.”“But she may be right,” Richard said. “We may all already be infected with theplague.”Drefan lifted a hand, warding off the concern. “We mustn’t let fear rule us.When I was in Castaglen Crossing, I cared for many people who were in death’sgrip, people just like that boy. So did the man who took me there. We neverbecame sick.“I was never able to determine any pattern to the plague. We touched the sickevery day and never became sick. Possibly because we were with the sick so muchthat our bodies knew it well, and were able to strengthen us against itscorruption.“Sometimes, a member of a family would come down sick and thereafter everymember of the family, even those who stayed away from the sick room, succumbedto the plague and all died. In other homes, I witnessed, one. or even several,children come down sick with the plague and die, yet their mothers who tendedthem nearly every moment never became ill, nor did any other member of thehousehold.”Richard sighed in frustration. “Drefan, all this isn’t very helpful. Maybe this.maybe that, sometimes yes, sometimes no.”Drefan wiped a hand wearily across his face. “I’m just telling you what I’veseen, Richard. There are people who will tell you for sure that it is this or itis that. Shortly, there will be people in the streets who will be sellingindisputable cures, unquestionable preservatives against the plague. Huckstersall. “What I am telling you is that I don’t know the answers. Sometimesknowledge is beyond our limited understanding. It’s one of our tenets, ashealers, that it is a wise man who admits the limits of his knowledge and skill,and that pretending either causes harm.”“Of course.” Richard felt foolish to have pressed for answers that weren’tthere. “You’re right, of course. It’s better to know the truth than hang hope onlies.”Richard looked to see where the sun was in the sky, but clouds were moving in,obscuring it. A cold wind was coming up. At least it wasn’t hot. Drefan had saidthat the plague spread worst in heat.He looked back at Drefan. “Are there any herbs-or anything-that you do know willhelp prevent it, or cure it?”“A standard precaution is to treat the home of sick people with smoke. It issaid the smoke may purge the air of the effluvia. There are herbs that arerecommended for smoking sick rooms. I would think it a wise precaution, atleast, but I wouldn’t count on it.“There are other herbs that can help with the complaints of the plague-theheadaches, sickness of the stomach, things like that-but none that I know ofthat will cure the plague itself. Even with these treatments, the person willlikely die just the same, but they may have some comfort from the herbs beforethey pass.”Kahlan touched Drefan’s arm. “Do all the people who come down with the plaguedie? Are all who catch it doomed?”Drefan smiled in reassurance to her. “No, some recover. In the beginning not asmany, and in the end of the outbreak more. Sometimes, if the infection can beurged to a head and the poison drained away, then the person will recover, butwill complain for the rest of their life about the torture of the treatment.”Richard saw Yonick come out the door. He put his arm around Kahlan’s waist andpulled her close. “So we all may already be infected.”Drefan watched his eyes a moment. “It’s possible, but I don’t believe it so.”Richard’s head was pounding, but it wasn’t from any plague; it was from lack ofsleep, and dread.“Well, then, let’s go to the other boys’ homes and see what we can find out. Weneed to know as much as we can.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30The first boy they went to see, Mark, was fine. Mark was happy to see Yonick,and wondered why he hadn’t seen him and his brother. Kip. for the last few days.The young mother was frightened by the important strangers who had appeared ather door inquiring after the health of her son. Richard was relieved that Mark,who had been in the Ja’La game with Yonick and his brother, wasn’t sick.So far, only one boy who had been at the Ja’La game had become sick. It waslooking more and more as if his fears about Jagang were just panickedinferences. Richard was beginning to feel the warmth of hope.Yonick told a stunned Mark of Kip’s death. Richard told the mother to send forDrefan if any of the family fell ill. Richard left the home feeling much better.The second boy, Sidney, had been dead since morning.By the time they found the third boy lying in blankets at the rear of a one-roomhouse, Richard’s hopes had faded.Bert was gravely ill, but at least his extremities weren’t black, as Kip’s hadbeen. His mother told them that he had a headache, and had been throwing up.While Drefan saw to the boy, Nadine gave the woman herbs.“Sprinkle these on the fire,” Nadine told Bert’s mother. “It’s mugwort, fennel,and hussuck. They’ll smoke and help drive away the sickness. Bring hot coals toyour boy, put a pinch of the herbs on the coals, and fan the smoke at your sonto insure that he breathes enough of it. It will help drive the sickness fromhim.”“Do you think that will really help?” Richard whispered when Nadine returned tohis side, near the boy. “Drefan said he doesn’t know if it will.”“I was taught that it was said to help serious sickness, like the plague,” shesaid in a low voice, “but I’ve never seen anyone with the plague before, so Ican’t say for sure. Richard, it’s all I know to do. I have to try.”Even though he was dead tired, and had a headache, Richard had no troublesensing the helplessness in her voice. She wanted to help. As Drefan had said,maybe it would do some good.Richard watched as Drefan pulled a knife from his belt. He gestured for Cara andRaina, who had both caught up with them after taking care of Richard’sinstructions, to hold down the sick boy. Raina gripped Bert’s chin with onehand, and held his forehead with the other. Cara pressed his shoulders into theblankets.With a steady hand, Drefan lanced the swelling at the side of the boy’s throat.Bert’s screams seared Richard’s nerves. He could almost feel the knife slicinghis own throat. The mother wrung her hands as she stood off a ways, watchingwith unblinking eyes.Richard remembered Drefan saying that if the person lived, they would complainthe rest of their life about the torture of the treatment. Bert would havecause. “What did you give Kip’s mother?” Kahlan asked Nadine.“I gave her some herbs to smoke the house, the same as I gave this woman,”Nadine said. “And I made her a pouch of hop cone, lavender, yarrow, and lemonbalm leaves to put in her pillow so that she might sleep. Even so, I don’t knowthat she will be able to sleep, after .. .” Her eyes turned away. “I know that Iwouldn’t be able to,” she whispered, almost to herself.“Do you have any herbs that you think might prevent the plague?” Richard asked.“Things that would keep people from catching it?”Nadine watched Drefan mopping blood and pus from the boy’s throat. “I’m sorry,Richard, but I don’t know enough about it. Drefan might be right; he seems toknow a lot. There may be no cure, or preventative.”Richard went to the boy and squatted down beside Drefan, watching his brotherwork. “Why are you doing that?”Drefan glanced over as he folded the rag to a clean place. “As I said before,sometimes, if the sickness can be brought to a head and drained, they willrecover. I have to try.”Drefan gestured to the two Mord-Sith. They gripped the boy again. Richard wincedas he watched Drefan slide the sharp knife deeper into the swelling, bringingforth more blood and yellowish-white fluid. Mercifully, Bert passed out.Richard wiped sweat from his own brow. He felt helpless. He had his sword todefend against attack, but it could do no good against this. He wished it wassomething he could fight.Behind him, Nadine spoke to Kahlan in a soft voice, but loud enough for Richardto hear.“Kahlan, I sorry about what I said before. I’ve devoted my life to helping sickpeople. It makes me so upset to see people suffer. That’s what I was angryabout. Not you. I was frustrated at Yonick’s grief, and I lashed out at you. Itwasn’t your fault. Nothing could have been done. I’m sorry.”Richard didn’t turn. Kahlan said nothing, but she might have offered Nadine asmile to accept the apology. Somehow, Richard doubted it.He knew Kahlan, and he knew that she expected as much from others as sheexpected from herself. Forgiveness was not forthcoming simply because someoneasked for it. The transgression was weighed into the equation, and there weretransgressions that outweighed absolution.The apology hadn’t been for Kahlan, anyway; it had been for Richard’s benefit.Like a child who had been upbraided, Nadine was on her best behavior, trying toimpress him with how good she could be.Sometimes, even though she had once brought him pain, a part of him wascomforted to have Nadine around; she reminded him of home, and his happychildhood. She was a familiar face from a carefree time. Another part of him wastroubled over what her real purpose was in coming. Despite what she mightbelieve, she hadn’t decided it on her own. Someone, or something, hadprecipitated her actions. Another part of him wanted to skin her alive.After they left Bert’s home, Yonick led them down a cobbled alley to a yardbehind where Darby Andersen’s family lived. The small yard of mud churned withwood shavings was cluttered with cutoffs and scraps, several stickered stacks oflumber protected by tarps, some old, rusty two-man rip saws, two carvingbenches, and warped, split, or twisted boards leaning up against the buildingsto the side. Darby recognized Richard and Kahlan from the Ja’La game. He wasastonished that they had come to his home. To have them come to see a Ja’La gamewas a cause of great pride, but to have them come to his home was beyond belief.He frantically brushed sawdust from his short brown hair and dirty work clothes.Yonick had told Richard that the whole Anderson family-Darby, his two sisters,his parents, father’s parents, and an aunt-lived over their small workshop.Clive Anderson, Darby’s father, and Erling, his grandfather, made chairs. Bothmen, having heard the commotion, had come to the wide, double doors and werebowing.“Forgive us, Mother Confessor, Lord Rahl,” Clive said after Darby had introducedhis father, “but we didn’t know you were coming, or we would have madepreparations-I’d have had my wife make tea, or something. I’m afraid that we’rejust simple folk.”“Please don’t be concerned about any of that, master Anderson,” Richard said.“We came because we were concerned about your son.” Erling, the grandfather,took a stem step toward Darby. “What’s the boy done?”“It’s nothing like that,” Richard said. “You have a fine grandson. We watchedhim play Ja’La the other day. One of the other boys is sick. Worse, two othersof them have died.” Darby’s eyes widened. “Died? Who?”“Kip,” Yonick said, his voice choking off. “And Sidney,” Richard added. “Bert isvery ill, too.”Darby stood in shock. His grandfather put a comforting hand to the boy’sshoulder. “My brother, Drefan”- Richard lifted a hand to the side-”is a healer.We’re checking on all the boys on the Ja’La team. We don’t know if Drefan canhelp, but he would like to try.”“I’m fine,” Darby said in a shaky voice.Erling, an unshaven, scrawny man, had teeth so crooked Richard wondered how hemanaged to chew his food. He noticed Kahlan’s white dress and Richard’s goldcloak billowing in the cold wind, and gestured toward the shop.“Please, won’t you all step inside? The wind is biting today. It’s warmerinside, out of the weather. I think we’ll have snow tonight, the way it looks.”Ulic and Egan took up posts near the back gate. Soldiers milled about in thealley. Richard, Kahlan, Nadine, and Drefan went into the shop. Cara and Rainashadowed them inside, but remained on guard near the doors.Old chairs and templates hung from pegs on the dusty walls. Cobwebs in all thecorners, that in a forest would have netted dew, here netted loads of sawdust.The workbench held chair pieces being glued up, a fine-toothed saw, a variety ofsmaller finishing and heading planes, and a number of chisels. Several jack andlong joiner planes hung on the wall behind the bench along with hammers andother tools.Partially finished chairs, cinched tightly together in twisted ropes as theywere being finished, or drying in peg-and-wedge clamps, sat about the floor. Acarving horse where the grandfather had been when they came into the yard held asplit billet of ash he had been working with a drawknife.Clive, a broad-shouldered young man, seemed content to let his father do thetalking. “What’s ailing these children?” Erling asked Drefan. Drefan cleared histhroat but let Richard answer. Richard was so tired he could hardly standanymore. He almost felt as if he were asleep, and this was just a bad dream.“The plague. I’m relieved to see that Darby, here, is well.” Erling’s scruffyjaw dropped. “Dear spirits spare us!” Clive turned white. “My daughters aresick.”He turned suddenly and ran for the stairs, but stopped abruptly. “Please, masterDrefan, will you see them?”“Of course. Show the way.”Upstairs, Darby’s mother, grandmother, and aunt had been making meat pies.Turnips were boiling in a pot hung in the hearth, and the boiling water hadsteamed the windows over.The three women, alarmed by Clive’s calls, were waiting wide-eyed in the centerof the upstairs common room. They were shocked by the sight of the strangers,but bowed the instant they saw Kahlan’s white dress. Kahlan, in the dress of theMother Confessor, needed no introduction to anyone in Aydindril, or most of theMidlands, for that matter.“Hattie, this man here, master Drefan, is a healer, and has come to see thegirls.” Hattie, her short, sandy-colored hair tied back with a head wrap, wipedher hands on her apron. Her gaze darted among all the people standing in herhome. “Thank you. This way, please.”“How do they fare?” Drefan asked Hattie on their way back to the bedroom. “Bethhas complained since yesterday of her head hurting,” Hattie said. “She was sickat her stomach, earlier. Common children ailments, that’s all.” It sounded toRichard more like a plea than a statement of fact. “I gave her some blackhorehound tea to settle her.”“That’s good,” Nadine assured her. “An infusion made of pennyroyal might help,too. I have some with me I’ll leave in case she needs it.”“Thank you for the kindness,” Hattie said, her concern growing with each stepshe took.“What of the other girl?” Drefan asked.Hattie had almost reached the doorway. “Lily’s not so sick, but just feeling outof sorts. I suspect she’s just looking for sympathy because her older sister isgetting attention and honey tea. That’s the way of children. She has somelittle, round sores on her legs.” Drefan missed a step.Beth was fevered, but not gravely so. She had a wet cough, and complained thather head hurt. Drefan all but ignored her. He watched Lily, in that analyticalway of his, as she sat in her blankets, carrying on an earnest conversation withher rag doll.The grandmother fussed with her collar and watched from the doorway as Hattiefussed with Beth’s covers. The aunt mopped Beth’s brow with a wet cloth whileNadine spoke words of comfort to the girl. Nadine really did have a soothing,kind way about her. She selected herbs from leather pouches in her bag andwrapped them up in several cloth packets, giving the intent, nodding motherinstructions.Richard and Kahlan moved with Drefan over to the younger girl. Kahlan squatteddown and talked to her, telling her what a lovely doll she had, so as to keepher from being frightened by Richard and Drefan. Lily cast worried looks intheir direction as she chattered with Kahlan. Kahlan hugged an arm aroundRichard’s waist to show Lily that he wasn’t anyone to be afraid of. Richard madehimself smile. “Lily,” Drefan said with forced cheerfulness, “could you show meyour doll’s sores?” Lily held the doll upside down and pointed out spots on theinside of the doll’s thighs. “She has ouches here, and here, and here.” Her big,round eyes turned up to Drefan. “And do they hurt her?” Lily nodded. “She goes‘ouch’ when I touch them.”“Really? Well, that’s too bad. I’ll bet she’s better, soon, though.” He squatteddown so that he wasn’t towering over her, circling an arm around Kahlan’s waistand pulling her back down with him. “Lily, this is my friend, Kahlan. Her eyesaren’t so good. She can’t see the sores on your doll’s legs. Could you showKahlan here the ones on your legs?”Nadine was still talking to the mother about the other girl. Lily glanced intheir direction.Kahlan brushed Lily’s hair back and told her what a pretty doll she had. Lilygrinned. She was fascinated by Kahlan’s long hair. Kahlan let her feel it. “Canyou show me the ouches on your legs?” Kahlan asked. Lily hiked up her whitenightdress. “Here they are, just like my doll’s ouches.” She had several darkspots, the size of pennies, on the inside of each thigh. Richard could tell whenDrefan gently touched them that they were hard as calluses. Kahlan straightenedLily’s nightdress back down and drew the blanket back over her lap as Drefanpatted her cheek, telling her what a good girl she was, and that her doll’souches would be better by morning. “I’m glad.” Lily said. “She doesn’t likethem.”Erling was absently planing a chair seat at the workbench. Richard could seethat he wasn’t paying any attention to what he was doing, and was ruining it. Hedidn’t look up when they came down the stairs. At Richard’s urging. Clive hadstayed upstairs with his wife and daughters. “Do they have it?” Erling asked ina hoarse voice.Drefan laid a comforting hand on the old man’s shoulders. “I’m afraid so.”Erling took a shaky, crooked stroke with his plane.“When I was young, I lived in the town of Sparlville. The plague came onesummer. It took a good many people. I hoped never to see such a thing again.”“I understand,” Drefan said in a soft voice. “I, too, have seen it visitplaces.”“They’re my only granddaughters. What can we do to help them?”“You can try to smoke the house,” Drefan offered.Erling grunted. “We did that in Sparlville. Bought cures and preventatives, too,but people died just the same.”“I know,” Drefan said. “I wish there was something I could do, but I’ve neverheard of a sure cure. If you know of anything that you think helped when youwere young, then try it. I don’t know of all the treatments, by any means. Atworst, it could do no harm, and at best may help.”Erling set the plane aside. “Some folk burned fires hot that summer, trying todrive the sickness from their blood. Some said it was because their blood wastoo hot already with the high summer heat and with the fever on top of that, andtried to fan their loved ones to cool their blood. Which would you advise?”Drefan shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I just don’t know. I’ve heard of peoplerecovering when each was tried, and I’ve heard of people dying just the samewith each. Some things are out of our hands. No one can stay the Keeper’s handwhen he comes.”Erling rubbed his scruffy chin. “I’ll pray that the good spirits spare thegirls.” His voice caught. “They’re too good, too innocent, for the Keeper totouch them just yet. They’ve brought untold joy to this house and family.”Drefan returned his hand to Erling’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, master Anderson, butLily has the tokens upon her.” Erling gasped and gripped the bench. Drefan hadbeen ready and caught him under his arms to keep him from falling when his kneesgave out. Drefan helped him to sit on the carving horse.Kahlan turned her face away and put it to Richard’s shoulder when Erling coveredhis tears with both hands. Richard felt numb. “Grandpa,” Darby called from thesteps, “what’s wrong?” Erling straightened. “Nothing, boy. I’m just worriedabout your sisters, that’s all. Old men get foolish, that’s all.”Darby eased the rest of the way down the stairs. “Yonick, I’m real sorry aboutKip. If your pa needs anything. I’m sure my pa would let me leave my work and gohelp.”Yonick nodded. He looked in a daze, too.Richard squatted down before the boys. “Did either of you see anything strangeat the Ja’La game?”“Strange?” Darby asked. “Strange like what?”Richard combed his fingers back through his hair. “I don’t know. Did you talk toany strangers?”“Sure,” Darby said. “There were lots of people there we didn’t know. Soldierswere there watching the game. Lots of people I didn’t know came to congratulateus after we won.”“Do any of them stand out in your mind? Anything odd about any of them?”“I saw Kip talking to a man and a woman after the game,” Yonick said. “More thanlike they were just congratulating him. They were leaning down talking to him,showing him something.”“Showing him something? What?”“I’m sorry,” Yonick said, “but I didn’t see. I was too busy getting slapped onthe back by soldiers.”Richard was trying not to frighten the boy with his questions, but he had topress for answers. “What did this man and woman look like?”“I don’t know,” Yonick said. His eyes were filling with tears at remembering hisbrother alive. “The man was skinny, and young. The woman was young, too, but notas young as he. She was kind of pretty, I guess. She had brown hair.” He pointedat Nadine. “Like hers, but not as thick, or as long.”Richard glanced up at Kahlan. By the stricken look on her face, he knew she wasfearing the same thing as he.“I remember them,” Darby said. “My sisters talked to that man and woman, too.”“But neither of you talked to them?”“No,” Darby said. Yonick shook his head. “We were jumping around, excited thatwe’d won the game in front of Lord Rahl. A lot of the soldiers werecongratulating us, and so were a lot of other people; I never talked to thosetwo.”Richard took Kahlan’s hand. “Kahlan and I have to go ask Beth and Lily aquestion,” he said to Drefan. “We’ll be right back.”Pressed close together, seeking support in each other’s touch, they climbed thestairs. Richard was dreading what he might hear from the girls.“You ask them,” Richard whispered to her. “They’re afraid of me. They’ll talkeasier to you.”“Do you think it could have been them?” Richard didn’t need to ask who she wastalking about. “I don’t know. But you told me that Jagang said he had watchedthe Ja’La game-through Marlin’s eyes. Sister Amelia was with Marlin. They weredoing something here in Aydindril.”Richard reassured the women that they just had a small question to ask thegirls. The women busied themselves with their work while he went with Kahlanback into the bedroom. Richard doubted they were paying any more attention totheir meat pies than Erling had been with the chair seat he had been planing.“Lily,” Kahlan asked the younger girl first in a soft voice as she smiled, “doyou remember when you went to watch your brother play Ja’La?”Lily nodded. “He won. We were real happy that he won. Pa said Darby scored apoint.”“Yes, we saw him play, and we were happy for him, too. Do you remember the twopeople you talked to? A man and a woman?”She frowned. “When Ma and Pa were cheering? That man and woman?”“Yes. Do you remember what they said to you?”“Beth was holding my hand. They asked if it was my brother we was cheering for.”“That’s right.” Beth said from the other bed. She had to stop talking as she wastaken with a bout of coughing. When she recovered and caught her breath, shewent on. “They said Darby played really good. They showed us the pretty thingthey had.”Richard stared at her. “Pretty thing?”“The shiny thing in the box,” Lily said. “That’s right,” Beth said. “They let meand Lily see it.”“What was it?”Beth frowned through her headache. “It was... it was... I don’t know exactly. Itwas in a box that was so black you couldn’t see its sides. The shiny thinginside was pretty.”Lily nodded her agreement. “My doll saw it, too. She thought it was real pretty,too.”“Do you have any idea what it was?” They both shook their heads.“It was in a box that was as black as midnight. To look at it is like lookingdown a dark hole.” Richard said. They both nodded.“Sounds like the night stone,” Kahlan whispered to him. Richard knew well thatblackness. Not only the night stone had been like that, but also the outercovering of the boxes of Orden. It was a color so sinister that it seemed tosuck the very light from a room.In Richard’s experience, that void of light was only associated with immenselydangerous things. The night stone could bring beings forth from the underworld,and the boxes of Orden held magic that, if used for evil, could destroy theworld of life. The boxes could open a gateway to the underworld.“And inside was something shiny,” Richard said. “Was it like looking at acandle, or the flame of a lamp? That kind of shiny?”“Colors,” Lily said. “It was pretty colors.”“Like colored light,” Beth said. “It was sitting on white sand.” Sitting onwhite sand. The hairs on the back of Richard’s neck stood on end. “How big wasthe box?” Beth held her hands not quite a foot apart. “About this big on a side.But it wasn’t very thick. Kind of like a book. It was almost like they opened abook. That’s what the box reminded me of-a book.”“And inside, the sand that was inside, did it have lines drawn in it? Kind oflike if you were to draw lines in dry dirt with a stick?”Beth nodded as she succumbed to a bout of rattling coughs. She panted, catchingher breath, when they finally ceased.“That’s right. Neat lines, in patterns. That’s just what it was like. It was abox, or maybe a big book, and when they opened it to show us the pretty colors,it had white sand in it with careful lines drawn in it. Then we saw the prettycolors.”“You mean, there was something sitting in the sand? This thing that made thecolored light was sitting in the sand?”Beth blinked in confusion, trying to remember. “No... it was more like the lightcame out of the sand.” She flopped back on her bed and rolled on her side, inobvious distress from her sickness. From the plague. From black death. From ablack box.Richard stroked a hand tenderly down her arm and pulled the blanket back up overher as she moaned in pain. “Thank you, Beth. You rest now, and get yourselfbetter.”Richard couldn’t thank Lily. He dared not trust his voice. Lily lay back. Hertiny little brow puckered. “I’m tired.” She pouted, near tears. “I don’t feelgood.”She curled up and put her thumb in her mouth.Kahlan tucked Lily in, and promised her a treat as soon as she was well.Kahlan’s tender smile brought a small smile to Lily’s mouth. It almost madeRichard smile. Almost.In the alley, after they had left the Anderson house, Richard pulled Drefanaside. Kahlan told the others to wait, and then she joined them.“What are tokens?” Richard asked. “You told the grandfather that the youngesthad tokens on her.”“Those spots on her legs are called tokens.”“And why was the old man nearly struck down with dread when he heard you say thegirl had them?”Drefan’s blue eyes turned away. “People die of the plague in different ways. Idon’t know the reason, except to imagine it has something to do with theirconstitution. The strength and vulnerability of everyone’s aura is different.“I’ve not seen with my own eyes all manner of death the plague causes, as,thankfully, it is a rare occurrence. Some of what I know I learned from therecords that the Raug’Moss keep. The plagues I’ve seen have been in small,remote places. In the past, many centuries ago, there have been a few greatplagues in large cities, and I’ve read the records of those.“With some people it comes on of a sudden-very high fevers, intolerableheadaches, vomiting, searing pains in their backs. They are out of their mindswith the agony of it for many days, even weeks, before they die. A few of theserecover. Beth is like that. She will get much worse, yet. I have seen peoplelike her recover. She has a small chance.“Sometimes, they look like the first boy, with the black death overwhelming themand rotting their bodies. Others are tortured with horribly painful swellings intheir neck, armpits, or groin, they suffer miserably until they finally die.Bert is like that. If the distemper can be brought to a head, and encouraged tobreak and run, then they occasionally recover.”“What about Lily?” Kahlan asked. “What about these tokens, as you called them?”“I’ve never seen them before, with my own eyes, but I’ve read about them in ourrecords. The tokens will appear on the legs and sometimes on the chest. Peoplewho have the tokens rarely know they are sick, until the end. They will one daydiscover to their horror that they have the tokens upon them, and be deadshortly thereafter.“They die with little or no pain. But they all die. No one with tokens on themever lives. The old man must have seen them before, because he knew this.“The plagues I’ve seen, as violent as the outbreaks were, never displayed thetokens. The records say that the worst of the great plagues, the ones thatbrought the most widespread death, were marked with the tokens. Some peoplethought they were visible signs of the Keeper’s fatal touch.”“But Lily is just a little girl,” Kahlan protested, as if arguing could changeit, “she doesn’t seem so sick. It isn’t possible for her to...”“Lily is feeling out of sorts. The tokens on her legs are fully developed. Shewill be dead before midnight.”“Tonight?” Richard asked in astonishment.“Yes. At the very latest. More likely within hours. I think perhaps even...” Awoman’s long, shrill scream came from the house. The horror in it sent a shiverthrough Richard’s bones. The soldiers who had been talking in low voices off atthe end of the alley fell silent. The only sound was a dog barking down the nextstreet.A man’s anguished cry came from the house. Drefan closed his eyes. “As I wasabout to say, even sooner.” Kahlan buried her face against Richard’s shoulder.She clutched his shirt. Richard’s head spun.“They’re children,” she wept. “That bastard is killing children!” Drefan’s browbunched. “What’s she talking about?”“Drefan”- Richard tightened his arms around Kahlan as she shook-”I think thesechildren are dying because a wizard and a sorceress went to a Ja’La game a fewdays back and used magic to start this plague.”“That’s not possible. It takes longer than that for people to fall sick.”“The wizard was the one who hurt Cara when you first arrived. He left a prophecyon the wall in the pit. It begins: ‘On the red moon will come the firestorm.’“Drefan regarded him with a dubious frown. “How can magic start a plague?”“I don’t know,” Richard whispered.He couldn’t bear to speak aloud the next part of the prophecy. The one bonded tothe blade will watch as his people die. If he does nothing, then he, and allthose he loves, will die in its heat, for no blade, forged of steel or conjuredof sorcery, can touch this foe.Kahlan trembled in his arms, and he knew she was agonizing over the final partof the prophecy.To quench the inferno, he must seek the remedy in the wind. Lightning will findhim on that path, for the one in white, his true beloved, will betray him in herblood."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31At the edge of the expansive palace grounds, a patrol of D’Haran soldiersspotted them and snapped to attention. Just beyond the soldiers, in the streetsof the city, Kahlan could see people everywhere going about their business pauseto bow to the Mother Confessor and the Lord Rahl.Although the activities of commerce, on the surface, seemed like any other day,Kahlan thought she could detect subtle differences: men loading barrels into awagon scrutinized people who passed close by; shopkeepers appraised customerscarefully; people walking on the street skirted those stopped in conversation.The knots of people gossiping seemed more numerous. Laughter was conspicuouslyabsent from the streets.After they had solemnly saluted with fists to the leather armor and chain mailover their hearts, the patrol of soldiers not far off broke into good-naturedgrins. “Huzzah, Lord Rahl!” they cheered as one. “Huzzah, Lord Rahl!”“Thank you, Lord Rahl,” one of the soldiers shouted toward them. “You cured us!Restored our health! We’re well because of you. Long live the great wizard, LordRahl!”Richard froze in mid-stride, not looking at the soldiers, but staring at theground before him. His cloak, snared in a gust of wind, embraced him, shroudinghim in its golden sparkles.The others joined in. “Long live Lord Rahl! Long live Lord Rahl!” Hands balledin fists, Richard started out once more without looking their way. Kahlan, herarm around his, slid her hand down and urged his fist open to twine her fingersin his. She gave his hand a squeeze of silent understanding and support.From the corner of her eye, Kahlan could see Cara, back behind Drefan andNadine, gesturing angrily at the patrol to silence them and move them along.In the distance before them, on a gentle rise, the expanse of the Confessors’Palace rose up in all its splendor of stone columns, vast walls, and elegantspires, standing out a pristine white against the darkening sky. Not only wasthe sun going down but murky clouds scudded by, messengers, delivering a vow ofa storm. A few errant snowflakes flitted past on the wind, scouting for thehorde to come. Spring had not yet prevailed.Kahlan gripped Richard’s hand as if clutching at life itself. In her mind’s eye,she saw nothing but sickness and death. They had seen near to a dozen sickchildren, stricken with plague. Richard’s pallid face looked hardly better thatthe six dead faces she had seen.Her insides ached. Holding back her tears, her cries, her screams, had crampedher stomach muscles. She had told herself that she couldn’t lose control and cryin front of mothers who were terrified that their sick children might be sickerthan they had imagined, or as sick as they knew, but refused to believe.Many of those mothers were hardly older than Kahlan. They were just young women,faced with a crushing plight, who fell to piteous prayer for the good spirits tospare their precious children. Kahlan couldn’t say that she wouldn’t have beenreduced to the same state in their place.Some of the parents, like the Andersons, had older members of their families torely on for advice and support, but some of the mothers were young and alone,with only husbands hardly more than boys themselves, and no one to turn to.Kahlan put her free hand over the painful spasm in her abdomen. She knew howdevastated Richard felt. He had more than enough to carry on his shoulders. Shehad to be strong for him.Majestic maple trees stood to each side, the bare thicket of branches lacedtogether over their heads. It wouldn’t be long before they budded. They passedout from the tunnel of trees, onto the winding promenade that led up to thepalace.Behind them. Drefan and Nadine carried on a whispered discussion of herbs andcures to be tried. Nadine would propose something, and Drefan would give hisopinion as to whether it would be useless or might be worth trying. He wouldgently lecture her on the paths of infirmity, and the causes of breaks in thebody’s defenses that allowed an affliction to gain hold.Kahlan got the vague impression that he almost seemed to view those who fellsick with contempt, as if because they took so little care with their auras andflows of energy that he talked about all the time, it was only to be expectedthat they would succumb to a pestilence unworthy of those like himself whominded their bodies better. She guessed that one with his knowledge of healingpeople must get frustrated with those who brought disease upon themselves, likethe prostitutes and the men who went to them. She was relieved, at least, thathe wasn’t one of those.Kahlan wasn’t sure if she felt Drefan was justified in some of the things he wassaying, or if it was simple arrogance. She herself had felt frustration atpeople who flouted dangers to their health. When she was younger, there was adiplomat who became ill every time he ate rich sauces with certain spices. Theyalways left him with difficulty breathing. He loved the sauces. Then one time,at a formal dinner, he gorged himself on the sauces he loved, and fell dead atthe table.Kahlan could never understand why the man would bring such sickness on himself,and had trouble feeling sorry for him. In fact, she always viewed him withcontempt when he came to a formal dinner. She wondered if Drefan didn’t feelmuch the same way about some people, except that he knew much more of what madepeople sick. She had seen Drefan do remarkable things with Cara’s aura, and sheknew, too, that sickness could sometimes be influenced by the mind.Kahlan had on a number of occasions stopped in a small place called Langdenwhere lived a very superstitious and backward people. It was decided by theirpowerful local healer that the headaches that so bothered the people of Langdenmust be caused by evil spirits possessing them. He ordered white hot irons putto the bottoms of the feet of those with headaches to drive out the evilspirits. It was a remarkable cure. No one in Langden was ever possessed again.The headaches vanished.If only the plague could vanish so easily.If only Nadine could vanish so easily. They couldn’t send her away, now, whenthere would be so much need among the people. Like it or not, Nadine was goingto be around until this was over. Shota seemed to be tightening her clutchesaround Richard.Kahlan didn’t know what Richard had said to Nadine, but she could imagine.Nadine had suddenly been stricken with overt politeness. Kahlan knew Nadine’sapology hadn’t been sincere. Richard had probably told her that if she didn’tapologize, he would boil her alive. With the way Cara’s gaze so often passedover Nadine, Kahlan suspected that Nadine had more to worry about than Richard.Kahlan and Richard led the rest of their group between the towering whitecolumns set to each side of the entrance, through the open doors carved withgeometric designs, and into the palace. The cavernous grand hall inside was litby windows of pale blue glass set between polished white marble columns toppedwith gold capitals, and by dozens of lamps spaced along the walls.A leather-clad figure in the distance wandered toward them across theblack-and-white marble squares. Someone else approached from the right side,from the guest rooms. Richard slowed to a stop and turned.“Ulic, would you please go find General Kerson. He might be at the D’Haranheadquarters. Does anyone know where General Baldwin is?”“He’s probably at Kelton’s palace, on Kings Row,” Kahlan said. “He’s beenstaying there since he arrived and helped us defeat the Blood of the Fold.”Richard nodded wearily. Kahlan didn’t think she had ever seen him looking worse.His spiritless eyes stared out from an ashen face. He swayed on his feet as hesquinted, looking for Egan not ten feet away.“Egan, there you are. Go get General Baldwin, please. I don’t know where he is,but you can ask around.”Egan cast a quick, uneasy glance toward Kahlan. “Would you like us to bringanyone else. Lord Rahl?”“Anyone else? Yes. Tell them to bring their officers. I’ll be in my office.Bring them there.”Ulic and Egan both clapped fists to hearts before turning to their duties. Asthey departed, they conveyed a message through quick hand signals to the twoMord-Sith. In response, Cara and Raina manoeuvred closer to Richard, screeninghim as Tristan Bashkar came to a wary halt.Berdine meandered up on the other side, her rapt attention on the open journalin her hands. She seemed completely absorbed in what she was studying, andoblivious to anything around her. Kahlan put out a hand to stop her before shebumped into Richard. She rocked to a halt like a rowboat that had drifted in andgrounded on the shore.Tristan bowed. “Mother Confessor. Lord Rahl.”“Who are you?” Richard asked.“Tristan Bashkar, of Jara, Lord Rahl. I’m afraid we haven’t been formallyintroduced.”Life sparked into Richard’s grey eyes. “And have you decided to surrender,minister Bashkar?”Tristan had been about to bow again at an expected formal introduction. Hehadn’t expected Richard’s questions to come first. He cleared his throat andstraightened. His easy smile welled onto his face.“Lord Rahl, I do appreciate your indulgence. The Mother Confessor has graciouslygranted me two weeks to observe the signs from the stars.”Power came to Richard’s voice. “You risk your people seeing swords, instead ofstars, minister.” Tristan unbuttoned his coat. From the corner of her eye,Kahlan saw Cara’s Agiel twitch up into her hand. Tristan didn’t notice. His gazestayed on Richard while he drew his coat back, holding it open casually byresting his fist on his hip. It exposed the knife at his belt. Raina flicked herAgiel up into her hand.“Lord Rahl, as I explained to the Mother Confessor, our people looked forwardwith great joy to joining with the D’Haran empire.”“D’Haran empire?”“Tristan,” Kahlan said, “we’re rather busy at the moment. We have discussed thisalready, and you have been given two weeks. Now, if you will excuse us?”Tristan brushed back a lock of his hair, his bright brown eyes taking her in.“I’ll get to the point, then. I’ve heard rumors that plague is loose inAydindril.”Richard’s raptor glower was suddenly in full form. “It’s not just a rumor. It’strue.”“How much danger is there?”Richard’s hand found the hilt of his sword. “If you join with the Order,minister, you will wish it was the plague on you, instead of me.”Kahlan had rarely seen two men so instantly and intently dislike each other. Sheknew Richard was exhausted, and in no mood, after having just seen so manyseriously ill or dead children, to be challenged by a noble such as Tristaninquiring after his own hide. Jara had also been on the council that hadcondemned Kahlan to death. Although it wasn’t Tristan who had voted to beheadher, it had been a councillor from his land. Richard had killed that Jariancouncillor.Kahlan didn’t know why Tristan took such an instant dislike to Richard, exceptfor the fact that this was the man who had demanded Jara’s surrender. Sheguessed that was reason enough; if she were in his place, she might feel thesame.Kahlan was expecting the two men to draw steel any second. Drefan steppedbetween them.“I’m Drefan Rahl, High Priest of the Raug’Moss community of healers. I’ve hadsome experience with the plague. I suggest that you confine yourself to yourroom and avoid contact with strangers. Especially prostitutes. Beyond that, youshould get enough sleep and proper, healthful food.“Those things will help to keep your body strong against the distemper. Also, Iwill be speaking to the staff, here at the palace, on strengthening oneselfagainst illness. You’re welcome to come and hear my guidance, as is anyone elseof a mind.”Tristan had listened earnestly to Drefan. He bowed, thanking him for his advice.“Well, I appreciate the truth, Lord Rahl. A lesser man might have tried todeceive me about such a serious problem. I can see why you’re so busy. I’ll takemy leave so that you may see to your people.”Berdine nudged up beside Richard as he glared after Tristan’s departing back. Asintently as she had been studying the journal, muttering to herself, testing thepronunciation of High D’Haran words, Kahlan doubted she had heard anything thathad been said.“Lord Rahl, I need to talk to you,” Berdine mumbled.Richard put a hand on her shoulder in a signal for her to wait. “Drefan, Nadine,do either of you have anything for a headache? A really bad headache?”“I have some herbs that will help, Richard,” Nadine offered. “I have somethingbetter.” Drefan leaned closer to Richard. “It’s called sleep. Perhaps you recallhaving experienced it in the past?”“Drefan, I know that I’ve been awake for a while, but-”“Many days and nights.” Drefan held up a finger. “If you try to mask the outcomeof lack of sleep with so-called remedies, you do yourself no service. Theheadache will return, worse than before. You will ruin your strength. You willbe no good to yourself, or anyone else.”“Drefan is right,” Kahlan said.Without looking up, Berdine turned the page she was reading in the journal. “Iagree. I feel much better since I got some sleep.” Berdine seemed to havefinally noticed that there were other people around. “Now that I’m alert, I canthink better.”Richard warded their insistence with a lifted hand. “I know. Soon, I promise.Now, what was it you wanted to tell me, Berdine?”“What?” She was reading again. “Oh. I found out where the Temple of the Windsis.”Richard’s brow went up. “What?”“After I got some sleep, I could think more clearly. I realized that we werelimiting our search by looking for a limited number of key words, so I tried tothink of what the old wizards would do in their situation. I reasoned that-”“Where is it!” Richard bellowed.Berdine finally looked up and blinked. “The Temple of the Winds is located atopthe Mountain of the Four Winds.”Berdine noticed Raina for the first time. The two women smiled in greeting,their eyes sharing a private warmth.Kahlan shrugged to Richard’s questioning look. “Berdine, that’s not much helpunless you can tell us where it is.”Berdine frowned a moment, and then waved in apology. “Oh. Sorry. That’s thetranslation”-she frowned again-”I think.” Richard swiped a hand across his face.“What does Kolo call it?” Berdine flipped the page back and turned the book,tapping a finger at a place in the writing.Richard squinted. “Berglendursch ost Kymermossf,” he read from the journal.“Mountain of the Four Winds.”“Actually,” Berdine said, “Berglendursch means more than just mountain. Berglenis ‘mountain,’ and dursch can sometimes mean ‘rock,’ though it can also meanother things, like ‘strong-willed,’ but in this case I think it means somethingmore along the lines of rock mountain, or great mountain made of rock. You know,rocky mountain of the four winds... something like that.” Kahlan shifted herweight on her tired feet. “Mount Kymermosst?” Berdine scratched her nose. “Yes.That sounds like it could be the same place.”“That has to be the same place,” Richard said, looking hopeful for the firsttime in hours. “Do you know where it is?”“Yes. I’ve been on Mount Kymermosst,” Kahlan said. “There’s no doubt about itsbeing windy up there-and rocky. There are some old ruins atop the mountain, butnothing like a temple.”“Maybe the ruins are the temple,” Berdine offered. “We don’t know how big it is.A temple can be small.”“No, I don’t think so, in this case.”“Why?” Richard asked. “What’s up there? How far is it?”“It’s not far to the northeast. Maybe a day’s ride, depending. Two at the most.It’s a pretty inhospitable place. As treacherous as the old trail going up andover the mountain is, going over Mount Kymermosst prevents you from having to gothrough some very difficult country and saves days of travel.“At the top is the site of some old ruins. Just some kind of outbuildings, fromthe look of them. I’ve seen a lot of grand places: I recognize, architecturally,that what’s up there isn’t the main structure. They’re something like theoutbuildings here, at the Confessors’ Palace. There’s a road through thebuildings, a bit like the grand promenade here going through the outbuildings.”Richard hooked a thumb behind his wide leather belt. “Well, where does it go,this grand road?”Kahlan stared into his grey eyes. “Right to the edge of a cliff. The buildingsare at the edge of a cliff. That sheer stone wall drops off for maybe three orfour thousand feet.”“Is there any kind of stairway carved in the cliff? Something leading down tothe temple itself?”“Richard, you don’t understand. The buildings are hard on the edge of the cliff.It’s obvious that the buildings, walls, and the road itself went on, becausethey’re sheared off abruptly right at the edge. There used to be more of themountain there. It’s gone now. It’s all fallen away. A rockslide, or something.What was beyond the ruins, the main structure and the mountain, is gone.”“That’s what Kolo said. The team returned, and the Temple of the Winds wasgone.” Richard looked devastated. “They must have used magic to tear away theside of the mountain, to bury the Temple of the Winds so no one could ever gothere again.”“Well,” Berdine sighed, “I’ll keep looking in the journal to see if he saysanything about the Temple of the Winds falling in a rockslide, or avalanche.”Richard nodded. “Maybe there’s more about it in the journal.”“Lord Rahl, will you have time to help me before you go off to be married?” Achill silence filled the grand hall.“Berdine-” Richard’s mouth worked, but no more words were forthcoming. “I heardthe soldiers are well,” Berdine said, looking briefly at Kahlan and then back atRichard. “You told me that you and the Mother Confessor would be leaving to bewedded just as soon as the soldiers were well. The soldiers are well.” Shegrinned. “I know that I’m your favorite, but you haven’t changed your mind, haveyou? Gotten cold feet?”She waited expectantly, seeming not to notice that no one was smiling at herjoke. Richard looked numb. He couldn’t say it. Kahlan knew that he fearedspeaking the words, feared he would break her heart.“Berdine,” Kahlan said into the heavy hush, “Richard and I won’t be going awayto be married. The wedding is called off. For now, anyway.”Even though she had whispered the words, they seemed to echo off the marblewalls as if she had shouted them.Nadine’s intently blank face spoke more than if she had grinned. It was somehowworse that she didn’t, because it made it all the more obvious that she wasschooling her expression, yet no one could have cause to reproach her. “Calledoff?” Berdine blinked in astonishment. “Why?” Richard stared down at Berdine,not daring to look at Kahlan. “Berdine, Jagang started a plague in Aydindril.That’s what the prophecy down in the pit was about. Our duty is to the peoplehere, not to our own... How would it look if... ?” He fell silent. The journalin her hands lowered. “I’m sorry.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32Kahlan stared out the window at the falling night, at the falling snow. Behindher, Richard sat at his desk, his gold cloak laid over the arm of his chair. Hewas working on the journal with Berdine while he waited for the officers toarrive. Berdine did most of the talking. He grunted occasionally when she toldhim what she thought a word meant, and why. Kahlan didn’t think that as tired ashe was he was much use to Berdine.Kahlan glanced back over her shoulder. Drefan and Nadine were huddled togetherbeside the hearth. Richard had asked them to come along to answer any questionsthe generals might have. Nadine confined her attention to Drefan, scrupulouslyavoiding looking at Richard, and especially at Kahlan. Probably because she knewthat Kahlan would detect the glint of triumph in her eyes.No. This wasn’t a triumph for Nadine-for Shota. This was only a postponement.Just until... until what? Until they could halt a plague? Until most of thepeople of Aydindril died? Until they themselves got the plague and died, as theprophecy foretold?Kahlan went to Richard and laid a hand on his shoulder, desperately needing histouch. Thankfully, she felt him put a hand over hers.“Just a postponement,” she whispered as she leaned close to his ear. “Thisdoesn’t change it, Richard. This only delays it for a little while, that’s all.I promise.” He patted her hand as he smiled up at her. “I know.” Cara opened thedoor and leaned in. “Lord Rahl, they’re coming now.”“Thanks, Cara. Leave the door open and tell them to come in.” Raina lit a longsplinter in the hearth. She put a hand to Berdine’s shoulder to balance herselfas she leaned past to light another lamp at the far end of the table. Her long,dark braid slipped over her shoulder, tickling Berdine’s face. Berdine scratchedher cheek and gave Raina a brief smile.To see those two touch or even acknowledge one another in front of others wasrare in the extreme. Kahlan knew that it was because of the things Raina hadseen that day. She, too, was feeling lonely, and in need of comfort. Asdeadening as their training had been, as numb as they were to agony, their humanfeelings were beginning to be rekindled. Kahlan could see in Raina’s dark eyesthat witnessing children suffer and die had affected her.Kahlan heard Cara, out in the hall, telling men to go in. Muscular, greyingGeneral Kerson, looking as imposing as ever in his burnished leather uniform,marched through the doorway. Muscles bulged under the chain mail covering hisarms.Behind him came the commander of the Keltish forces, the robust General Baldwin.He was an older man with a white-flecked dark moustache, the ends of which grewdown to the bottom of his jaw. As always, he looked distinguished in his greensilk-lined serge cape. fastened on one shoulder with two buttons. A heraldicemblem slashed through with a diagonal black line dividing a yellow and blueshield was emblazoned on the front of his tan surcoat. Lamplight flashed off hisornate belt buckle and silver scabbard. He looked as fierce as he was dashing.Before the phalanx of officers accompanying them had all entered the room, bothgenerals were bowing. In the lamplight. General Baldwin’s pate shone through histhinning grey hair as he bent low. “My queen.” General Baldwin said. “LordRahl.”Kahlan bowed her head to the man as Richard stood, pushing his chair back.Berdine scooted her chair over. to be out of his way. She didn’t bother to lookup. She was Mord-Sith, and busy besides.“Lord Rahl,” General Kerson said with a salute of his fist to his heart after hehad straightened. “Mother Confessor.”Behind them, the officers were all bowing. Richard waited patiently until it wasall finished. Kahlan imagined that he couldn’t be eager to start.He did so simply. “Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that there is a plague uponAydindril.”“A plague?” General Kerson asked. “A plague of what?”“A distemper. A plague that makes people sicken and die. That kind of plague.”“The black death,” Drefan put in with a sombre voice from behind Kahlan andRichard.The men all seemed to take a collective breath. They waited in silence. “Itstarted not long ago,” Richard said, “so, fortunately, we will be able to take afew precautions. As of this moment, we know of less than a couple of dozencases. Of course, there is no telling how many have it and have yet to fall ill.Of the ones we know were stricken, almost half are already dead. By morning, thenumber will grow.”General Kerson cleared his throat. “Precautions, Lord Rahl? What precautions arethere to be taken? Do you have another cure for the men? For the people of thecity?”Richard rubbed his fingertips on his forehead as his eyes turned to the deskbefore him.“No, general, I have no cures,” he whispered. Everyone heard his words, though;it was that silent in the room. “Then what... ?”Richard straightened himself. “What we need to do is to separate the men.Disperse them. My brother has seen the plague before, and has read of greatplagues in the past. We believe that it’s possible that it spreads from personto person, much as when one person in a family has a sore throat, chestcongestion, and stuffed nose, then the others in the family, from theirproximity to the sick person, come down with the same illness.”“I’ve heard that the plague is caused by bad air in a place,” one of theofficers in the back put in.“I am told that this, too, is possible,” Richard said. “I have also been toldthat it could be caused by any number of other things: bad water, bad meat,heated blood.”“Magic?” someone asked.Richard shifted his weight. “That, too, is a possibility. It is said by somethat it could be a judgment by the spirits on our world, and a punishment forwhat they find. I, myself, don’t believe such a thing. I’ve been out thisafternoon, seeing innocent children suffering and dying. I can’t believe thatthe spirits would do such a thing, no matter how displeased.”General Baldwin rubbed his chin. “Then what do you think it is that spreads it,Lord Rahl?”“I’m no expert, but I lean toward my brother’s explanation that it’s like anyother sickness, that it can be passed from person to person through odors in theair or close contact. This makes the most sense to me, although this sickness ismuch more serious. The plague, I am told, is almost always fatal.“If it is, in fact, passed from person to person, then we must not delay. Wemust do what we can to keep the plague from our forces. I want the men split upinto smaller units.”General Kerson spread his hands in frustration. “Lord Rahl, why can’t you simplyuse your magic and rid the city of this plague?”Kahlan touched Richard’s back, reminding him to hold his temper. He seemed,though, to have no anger in him.“I’m sorry, but right now, I don’t know what magic can cure this plague. I don’tknow that any wizard has ever before cured a plague through the use of magic.“You have to understand, general, that just because a person can command magic,that doesn’t mean that they can stay the Keeper himself, when the time for histouch has come. If wizards could do that, I assure you, graveyards would vanishfor want of clients. Wizards have not the power of the Creator.“Our world has balance to it. Just as we all, especially soldiers, can aid theKeeper in bringing death, we all can also be a part of the Creator’s work ofcreating life. We know, better than most, perhaps, that soldiers are chargedwith protecting peace and life itself. The balance to that is that we sometimesmust take life to stay an enemy who would do greater harm. For this, we areremembered, not for the lives we try to preserve.“A wizard, too, must be in balance, in harmony, with the world he lives in. TheCreator and the Keeper both have a part to play in our world. It is not withinthe power of a mere wizard to dictate to them what shall be. He can work forevents to combine toward a result-a marriage, for example, but he cannot directthe Creator Himself to bring forth a life as a result of that marriage.“A wizard must remember always that he works within our world, and must do hisbest to help people, just as a farmer would help a neighbor who has a harvest tobring in, or a fire to douse.“There are things a wizard can do that those without magic cannot, much the sameas you men are strong and can wield a heavy battle-axe, whereas an old man couldnot. Even though you have the muscle to do this, that doesn’t mean that yourmuscles can do what they aren’t meant to do, such as exercise wisdom the old manhas from his experience. He may defeat you in battle through his knowledge,rather than his muscle.“No matter how great a wizard may be, he could not bear a new life into thisworld. A young woman, without magic, experience, or wisdom, could do such athing, but he could not. Perhaps she has more to do with magic than he, in theend. “What I’m trying to tell you men is that just because I have been born withthe gift, that doesn’t mean that the gift can stop this plague. We can’t dependon magic to solve all our problems. Knowing the limitations of his power is justas important for a wizard as knowing the limitations of his men is for an armyofficer.“Many of you have seen what my sword can do against the enemy. Yet as awesome aweapon as it is, it cannot touch this invisible enemy. Other magic may prove asimpotent.”“‘In your wisdom we are humbled.’“ General Kerson quoted softly from thedevotion.Men voiced their agreement and nodded at the logic of Richard’s explanation.Kahlan was proud of him, that at least he had convinced them. She wondered if hehad convinced himself.“It’s not so much wisdom,” Richard murmured, “as it is simple common sense.“Please be assured, all of you,” he went on, “that that doesn’t mean I have nointention of trying to find a way to end this plague. I am looking into everypossible means of stopping it.” He laid a hand on Berdine’s shoulder. Sheglanced up. “Berdine is helping me with the old books from wizards past, to seeif they left us any wisdom.“If there is a way for magic to stop it, then I will find that way. For now,though, we must use other means at our disposal to protect people. We need tohave the men split up.”“Split up, and then what?” General Kerson asked. “Split up and get out ofAydindril.”General Kerson stiffened. The links of his chain mail reflected the lamplight,so that he seemed to sparkle like a vision of a spirit. “Leave Aydindrilundefended?”“No,” Richard insisted. “Not undefended. What I propose is to have our forcesdivide up, so there is less chance of the plague spreading among them, and moveto separate positions around Aydindril. We can put detachments of our forces atall the passes, all the roads and access valleys. That way, no force can advanceagainst us.”“What if one does?” General Baldwin asked. “Then those smaller, separate forcesmay be insufficient to drive off an attack.”“We will have sentries and scouts. We’ll have to increase them so that we don’thave any surprises. I don’t think there are any forces of the Order this farnorth yet, but if any attack does come, then we will have warning and can gatherour forces quickly. We don’t want them too far apart to be able to defend thecity if they must, but they must be far enough apart to keep from passing theplague throughout the whole of the army.“Any ideas you men have would be valued. That’s one reason I asked you here. Ifyou have ideas about any of this, then please feel free to speak up.”Drefan stepped forward. “It needs to be done quickly. The sooner the men areaway, the better the chance that none of them will have come in contact with thesickness.”The officers all nodded as they pondered.“The officers who went with us today should remain here,” Drefan said. “They mayhave come in contact with someone who has the plague. Make a list of any theywork closely with, and have them isolated here in Aydindril, too.”“We’ll see to it at once,” General Kerson said. “Tonight.” Richard nodded. “Eachgroup of our forces must communicate with the others, of course, but messagesmust be spoken only. No written messages passing from hand to hand. The paperscould carry the plague. These men who pass commands and messages should talk ata distance. At least the way we are here, in this room, with me at this end andyou at the other.”“Isn’t that a rather extraordinary precaution?” one of the officers asked. “Ihave heard,” Drefan said, “that people who have the plague, but have not yetfallen sick and therefore don’t know of their affliction, can be detected by thedistinctive odor of the plague on their breath.” Men nodded with interest. “Butto smell that fatal odor would infect you with the plague, and you, too, wouldbe stricken and die.” Mumbling spread back through the men.“That’s why we don’t want the messengers to get too close to one another,”Richard said. “If one were to already have the plague, we don’t want himspreading it to another group of our forces. There is no use in going to all ofthis trouble if we aren’t scrupulous in our attention to everything.“This is a deadly poison. If we act quickly, and act as wisely as we know how,we may spare a great many people from death. If we don’t take these precautionsseriously, nearly every one of the people in this city, and every one of ourmen, could be dead within weeks.” Serious, worried talk swept back through theroom.“We are giving you the worst look at it,” Drefan said, bringing their attentivegazes back. “We don’t want to pretend the danger is less than it is. But thereare things in our favor. The most important is the weather. The plagues I haveseen, and read about, spread worst in the high heat of summer. I don’t think itwill be able to get a foothold in the cool weather of this time of year. We havethat much.” Men sighed with renewed hope. Kahlan didn’t.“One other thing,” Richard said as he looked from eye to eye. “We are D’Harans.We are people of honor. Our men will act accordingly. I don’t want any of uslying to people about the danger, telling people that there is no risk, and onthe other hand, I don’t want anyone deliberately panicking people. Everyone willbe frightened enough as it is.“You are also soldiers. This is no less a battle than if any other enemyattacked our people. This is part of our job.“Some of the men will have to stay in the city to help. There may need to be menat arms to hold down any uprising that may be stirred up. If there are anyriots, like there were with the red moon, I want them put down at once. Usewhatever force is necessary, but no more. Remember, the people of this city areour people- we are their protectors, not their wardens.“We will need men to help with digging graves. I don’t think we can be burningthat many dead, if the plague gets hot among the population.”“How many do you think could die. Lord Rahl?” one of the officers asked.“Thousands,” Drefan answered. “Tens of thousands.” His blue-eyed gaze took themall in. “If it gets bad enough, more. I read of a plague that in three monthstook the life of nearly three of every four people in a city of close to half amillion.” A low whistle came from an officer in back.“One other thing,” Richard said. “Some people will panic. They will want to runfrom Aydindril to remove themselves from the danger. Most will want to stay, notonly because this is the only home they know, but because their livelihood ishere.“We can’t allow people to flee Aydindril and spread the plague to other placesin the Midlands, or even beyond, to D’Hara. It must be confined here. If peoplewant to rush away from the city and go to the surrounding hills, separatingthemselves from their neighbors who they fear have the plague upon them. we mustbe understanding of their fears.“They are to be allowed to run to the countryside if they wish. but they mustremain in the area. I want our soldiers who will be in these separate units toring the city and surrounding country, protecting all routes to and fromAydindril. The people must stay within these limits.“Any person fleeing could be infected with the plague and not know it, thusendangering people in other places. As a last resort, force must be used toprevent them from taking the plague abroad. Please keep in mind that these arenot malevolent people, but simply people frightened for the lives of theirfamilies.“The ones who flee the city to wait out the plague will soon be short of foodand succumb to starvation. Remind people to take food. as they are not likely tofind it in the countryside. They will be no less dead if they die of hungerrather than plague. Remind them of this, and that looting of farms will not betolerated. We will not allow anarchy.“Well, I guess that’s about all I have to say. What are your questions?”“Will you be leaving tonight, my queen. Lord Rahl, or in the morning?” GeneralBaldwin asked. “And where will you be staying?”“Richard and I won’t be leaving Aydindril,” Kahlan said. “What? But you must getaway,” General Baldwin insisted. “Please, both of you must escape this. We needyou to lead us.”“We didn’t know what we were dealing with until it was too late,” Kahlan said.“We may have already been exposed to the plague.”“We don’t think that likely,” Richard said, wanting to assuage their fears. “ButI must stay to see if there is any magic that will stop this plague. I will needto be going up to the Keep. If we’re up in the hills we can’t be of any use. andI might miss a chance of finding a solution. We will remain here and oversee thecommand of the city.“Drefan is the High Priest of the Raug’Moss healers, from D’Hara. The MotherConfessor and I could be in no better hands. He and Nadine will be staying, too,to see what relief can be brought to people.”As the men asked questions and discussed matters of food and supplies, Kahlanmoved to the window, watching the snow and wind build in the spring storm.Richard was speaking to his men the way a commander spoke on the eve of abattle, to instill in them a sense of purpose, to harden them to the battleahead. As in any battle, death would run rampant.Despite what Drefan believed about the plague not being able to build to fullstrength in the cold weather, Kahlan knew that it wasn’t true in this case.This was no ordinary plague. This was a plague started by magic, by a man whowanted to kill them all.Down in the pit, Jagang had called it Ja’La dh Jin-The Game of Life. Jagang wasincensed that Richard had changed the ball to a lighter one so that all thechildren could enjoy playing, instead of just the strongest, the most brutal.Jagang started the killing with those children. It was no accident; it was amessage. It was the game of life. This would be Jagang’s world, ruled by suchsavagery, if he won."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33For the next hour, the men asked questions, mostly of Drefan. The two generalsoffered suggestions to Richard regarding command and logistics. Options werebriefly discussed, plans were made, and officers were assigned duties. The armywas to begin moving that very night. There were a great many Blood of the Foldwho had surrendered, and although they had since sworn loyalty to Richard, itwas still thought wise to divide them, too, sending some with each unit, ratherthan letting them remain together. Richard concurred with the suggestion.When at last they had all departed to begin the work, Richard dropped heavilyinto his chair. He had come a long way from being a woods guide. Kahlan wasproud of him.She opened her mouth to say so, but Nadine spoke the words in her stead. Richardmumbled a flat “Thanks.”Nadine tentatively touched her fingertips to the back of his shoulder. “Richard,you were always... I don’t know... Richard, to me. A boy from home. A woodsguide.“Today, and especially tonight, with all those important men, I think I saw youdifferently for the first time. You really are this Lord Rahl.”Richard put his elbows on the table before him and his face in his hands. “Ithink I’d rather be at the bottom of the cliff, buried with the Temple of theWinds.”“Don’t be silly,” she whispered.Bristling, Kahlan moved to his side. Nadine glided away. “Richard,” Kahlan said,“you have to get some sleep. Now. You promised. We need you strong. If you don’tget some sleep-”“I know.” He pushed away from the table and stood. He turned to Drefan andNadine. “Do either of you have anything to make a person go to sleep? I’vetried.... Lately, I just lie there. My mind won’t be quiet.”“A Feng San disharmony,” Drefan announced at once. “You bring it on yourselfwith the way you push past the limits of your body. There are bounds to what wecan do, and if-”“Drefan,” Richard said, cutting him off with a gentle voice, “I know what youmean, but I do what I must. You just have to understand that. Jagang is tryingto kill us all. It will do me no good to be as high-spirited as a squirrel inspring if it means we all end up dead.”Drefan grunted. “I understand, but that doesn’t get you strong.”“So, I’ll try to be good later. What about going to sleep tonight?”“Meditation,” Drefan said. “That will calm your energy flows, and begin bringingthem into harmony.” Richard rubbed his brow. “Drefan, hundreds of thousands ofpeople are in danger of dying because Jagang wants to put the whole of the worldunder his boot. He’s shown us that he has no bounds to his determination.“He’s starting the killing with children.” Richard’s knuckles turned white ashis hands fisted. “Just to send me a message! Children!“He has no conscience. He’s showing me what he’s willing to do to win. To makeme surrender! He thinks it will break me!”In contrast to his knuckles. Richard’s face had gone scarlet. “He’s wrong. I’dnever give our people over to that kind of tyrant. Never! I’ll do whatever Imust to stop this plague! I swear it!”The room rang with the sudden silence. Kahlan had never seen Richard angry inquite this way. When he had the deadly fury of the Sword of Truth’s magic in hiseyes, the object of his rage was usually at hand: the rage was invoked by anddirected at a palpable threat.This was frustrated anger at an invisible enemy. There was no threat he couldget his hands on, now. He had no direct way to fight it. Kahlan could see in hiseyes that this anger wasn’t the magic of the sword. This was purely Richard’srage.His face finally cooled. He took a calming breath as he wiped a hand across hisface. He regained control of his voice.“If I try to meditate. I will only see those sick and dead children again in mymind. Please, I can’t bear to see that in my sleep. I need to go to sleep andnot have dreams.”“Go to sleep and not have dreams? You are bothered by dreams?”“Nightmares. I have them all day, too, when I’m awake, but they’re real. Thedream walker can’t enter my dreams, but he has found a way to give menightmares, nonetheless. Please, dear spirits, at least when I’m asleep, grantme some peace.”“A sure sign of a Feng San meridian disharmony,” Drefan confirmed to himself. “Ican see that you are going to be a difficult patient, but not without a cause.”He slipped the bone pin from the loop of leather and opened the flap on one ofthe pouches at his belt. He pulled out a few leather purses. He put one back.“No, that will kill pain, but not be much aid to sleep.” He sniffed another.“No, that will make you vomit.” He searched his other things and finally closedthe flaps on the pouches. “I’m afraid I didn’t bring anything so simple with me.I only brought rare items.”Richard sighed. “Thanks for trying, anyway.”Drefan turned to Nadine. She was bottled zeal, pressing her lips together withrestrained delight as the others talked.“The things you gave Yonick’s mother wouldn’t be strong enough for Richard,”Drefan said to her. “Do you have any hops?”“Sure,” she said calmly, but obviously pleased that someone had at last askedher. “In tincture, of course.”“Perfect,” Drefan said. He slapped Richard on the back. “You can meditateanother time. Tonight, you will be asleep in no time. Nadine will fix you apreparation. I’ll go start checking with the staff and giving them myrecommendations.”“Don’t forget to meditate,” Richard muttered as Drefan departed. Berdineremained behind, studying the journal, as Nadine. Cara, Raina, Ulic, Egan, andKahlan all followed Richard to his room, not far away. Ulic and Egan took upposts outside in the hall. The rest of them went into the room with Richard.Inside, Richard tossed his gold cloak over a chair. He pulled the baldric overhis head and laid the Sword of Truth atop it. He wearily drew his gold-trimmedtunic over his head, and removed his shirt, leaving him with a black, armlessundershirt.Nadine watched from the corner of her eye while she softly counted each dropaloud as it dripped into a glass of water.Richard flopped down on the edge of the bed. “Cara, would you pull my boots offfor me, please?”Cara rolled her eyes. “Do I look like a valet?” She squatted to the task whenRichard smiled.He leaned back on his elbows. “Tell Berdine that I want her to look for anyreference to this Mountain of the Four Winds place. See what else she can findout about it.”Cara looked up from his feet. “What a brilliant idea,” she said with mockenthusiasm. “I bet she would never have thought of that on her own, all-wise andknowing master.”“All right, all right. I guess I’m not needed. How’s my magic potion coming overthere?”“Just finished,” Nadine said in a cheery voice.Cara grunted as she yanked off his other boot. “Undo your pants, and I’ll pullthem off, too.”Richard scowled down at her. “I’ll manage, thank you.” Cara smirked to herselfas he rolled off the bed and went to Nadine. She handed him the glass of waterwith the tincture of hops. She had put something else in the glass of water,too.“Don’t drink it all. I put in fifty drops. That’s way more than you should need,but I wanted to leave you with extra. Drink about a third, and then if you wakein the night, you can always drink another swallow or two. I put in somevalerian and skullcap, too, to help insure you go into a deep and dreamlesssleep.”Richard downed half of it. His face contorted. “As bad as this tastes, it willput me to sleep or else kill me.” Nadine smiled at him. “You’ll sleep like ababy.”“Babies don’t sleep all that well, from what I’ve heard.” Nadine laughed in asoft lilt. “You’ll sleep, Richard. I promise. If you wake too early, just take alittle more.”“Thanks.” He sat down on the edge of the bed, looking from one woman to thenext. “I’ll manage with my pants. I swear.”Cara rolled her eyes and headed for the door, urging Nadine along before her.Kahlan kissed his cheek.“Get in bed. I’ll come back in and tuck you in and kiss you good night as soonas I see to the guards.”Raina followed Kahlan out and closed the door. Nadine was waiting, rocking backand forth on her heels. “How’s the arm? Do you need a poultice?”“My arm is much better,” Kahlan said. “I think it’s fine, now. But thank you forasking.”Kahlan clasped her hands and stood watching Nadine. Cara watched Nadine. Rainawatched Nadine.Nadine’s gaze moved from one woman to the next. She glanced to Ulic and Egan,who were watching her. too. “All right, then. Good night.”“Good night,” Kahlan, Cara, and Raina said as one.They watched as Nadine strolled off.“I still say you should have let me kill her,” Cara said under her breath. “Imay yet let you,” Kahlan said. She knocked on the door. “Richard? You in bed?”“Yes.”Cara started to follow as Kahlan opened the door.Kahlan turned. “I’ll only be a minute. I don’t think he can spoil my honor in aminute.”Cara frowned. “With Lord Rahl, anything is possible.” Raina laughed and slappedCara’s arm, making her leave Kahlan be. “I wouldn’t worry. With what we’ve seentoday, neither of us would be in the mood,” Kahlan said. She shut the door.A single candle was lit. Richard was covered to his stomach. Kahlan sat on theedge of the bed and took his hand. She held it to her heart. “Are you terriblydisappointed?” he asked.“Richard, we will be married. I’ve waited my whole life for you. We’re together;that’s all that really matters.”Richard smiled. His tired eyes sparkled. “Well, not all.” Kahlan couldn’t helpsmiling herself. She kissed his knuckles. “Just as long as you know that Iunderstand,” she said. “I didn’t want you to go to sleep thinking I washeartbroken that we can’t be married just now. We’ll be married when we can.”He put his other hand to the back of her neck and pulled her into a gentle kiss.She laid a hand on his bare chest, feeling his warm flesh, his breathing, hisheartbeat. If she hadn’t been so devastated by the suffering children she hadseen that day, the feel of him would have ignited longing in her own breast. “Ilove you.” she whispered. “I love you, now, and always,” he whispered back. Sheblew out the candle. “Sleep well, my love.”Cara eyed Kahlan suspiciously as she closed the door. “That was two minutes.”Kahlan ignored Cara’s little jab. “Raina, would you guard Richard’s room untilyou go to bed, and then have a guard posted?”“Yes, Mother Confessor.”“Ulic, Egan, with that sleep potion, Richard may not be able to awake if he werein danger. I’d like one of you to be here when Raina goes to bed.”Ulic folded his massive arms. “Mother Confessor, neither of us has any intentionof leaving this spot as long as Lord Rahl is asleep.”Egan pointed at the floor against the opposite wall. “One of us can take a napif need be. We’ll both be here. Don’t be concerned for Lord Rahl’s safety whilehe is sleeping.”“Thank you, all of you. One other thing: Nadine isn’t to be allowed into hisroom-for any reason. None whatsoever.”They all nodded in satisfaction. Kahlan turned to the blond-headed Mord-Sith.“Cara, go get Berdine. I’m going to get a cloak. Both of you should bring yourcloaks, too. It’s a foul night.”“And where are we going?”“I’ll meet you both out in the stables.”“The stables? Why do you want to go out there? It’s time for dinner.”Cara would never really balk at a duty over a matter so petty as dinner. She wassuspicious.“Grab something from the kitchens that we can take with us, then.” Cara claspedher hands behind her back. “Where are we going?”“For a ride.”“A ride. Mother Confessor, where are we going?”“The Wizard’s Keep.” Both Cara and Raina lifted an eyebrow.Cara’s surprise turned to a frown of disapproval. “Does Lord Rahl know that youwant to go up to the Keep?”“Of course not. If I had told him why I’m going, he would have insisted ongoing, too. He needs sleep, so I didn’t tell him.”“And why are we going?”“Because the Temple of the Winds is gone. The wizards who did it were put ontrial. There are records in the Keep of all the trials held there. I want tofind that record. Tomorrow, Richard can read it over, after he’s gotten somesleep. It could help him.”“Makes sense, going to the Wizard’s Keep after dark. I will go get Berdine andsome food and meet you in the stables. We’ll make a picnic of it,” Cara saidwith blithe sarcasm."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34Kahlan batted the big, wet snowflakes from her lashes and pulled the hood of hercloak forward as she considered the foolishness of not thinking to change out ofher white Confessor’s dress. She stood in the stirrups, reached between herlegs, and pulled more of the back of the dress under her bare legs to protectthem from the cold saddle. Fortunately, her boots were high enough that hikingup the dress to sit in the saddle didn’t expose her calves to the wind. She wasglad, though, to be back on Nick, the big warhorse her Galean soldiers had givenher. Nick was an old friend.Cara and Berdine looked just as uncomfortable as she, but Kahlan knew that itwas because they feared going to a place of magic. They had been in the Wizard’sKeep before. They didn’t want to return. Back at the stables they had tried totalk her out of it. Kahlan had reminded them of the plague.Nick’s ears twitched even before the dark shapes of soldiers appeared out of theswirling snow to challenge them. Kahlan knew they had reached the stone bridge;the soldiers were posted just to the city side of it.The men sheathed their swords when Cara growled at them, pleased to have someonehandy upon whom to vent her foul mood.“Terrible night to be out. Mother Confessor,” one of the soldiers said, happy toaddress someone other than the Mord-Sith. “Terrible night to be stationed outhere,” she said.The man looked back over his shoulder. “Any night you’re stationed on watch uphere at the Keep is a terrible night.”Kahlan smiled. “The Keep looks sinister, soldier, but it’s not so bad as itlooks.”“If you say so. Mother Confessor. Myself, I think I’d just as soon stand guardover the underworld itself.”“No one has tried to get in the Keep, have they?”“If they had, you’d have heard about it, or found our bodies. Mother Confessor.”Kahlan urged her big stallion on. Nick snorted and surged ahead on the slicksnow. She trusted him in such conditions and let him lead the way. Cara andBerdine both swayed easily in their saddles as they followed behind. Back in thestables, Cara had snatched her horse’s bit, looked the animal in the eye, andordered it not to give her any trouble. Kahlan had the odd feeling that the baymare understood the warning.Kahlan could just see the stone walls at the sides of the bridge. Just as wellthat the horses couldn’t see the chasm beyond. She knew Nick wouldn’t spook, butshe wasn’t sure about the other two. The sheer rock walls of the yawning abyssdropped for thousands of feet. Unless you had wings, there was only this one wayinto the Wizard’s Keep. In the snowy darkness, the vast Keep, its soaring wallsof dark stone, its ramparts, bastions, towers, connecting passageways, andbridges all blended into the inky darkness of the side of the mountain intowhich it was built. To those without magic or those who didn’t understand magic,the Keep presented an unmistakable spectacle of sinister menace.Kahlan had grown up in Aydindril and had been up to the Keep uncountable times,more often than not, alone. Even as a child, she had been allowed to go alone tothe Keep, as were the other young Confessors. When she was little, wizards hadtickled her and chased her through the halls, laughing with her. The Keep was asecond home to her: comfortably safe, welcoming, and protective.She knew, though, that there were dangers in the Keep, just as in any home. Ahome could be a safe, welcoming place, as long as one wasn’t foolish enough towalk into the hearth. There were places in the Keep you didn’t walk into,either.It was only when she was older that she no longer went to the Keep alone. When aConfessor became older, it was dangerous to go anywhere alone. After a Confessorhad begun taking confessions, it wasn’t safe for her to be without theprotection of her wizard.When she was older, a Confessor earned enemies. Family of the condemned rarelybelieved that a loved one had committed violent crimes, or they blamedConfessors for the man’s death sentence, even though she was only the means ofconfirming its justice.There were always attempts on the lives of Confessors. There was no shortage ofpeople, from commoners to kings, wanting a Confessor dead.“How are we going to go through the shields without Lord Rahl?” Berdine asked.“His magic enabled us to pass through, before. We won’t be able to get throughthe shields.”Kahlan smiled assurance to the two Mord-Sith. “Richard didn’t know where he wasgoing. He just blundered through the Keep, going where he needed to go oninstinct. I know the ways to go that don’t require magic to pass. There may be afew mild shields that will keep people out, but I can pass those. If I can pass,then I can get you through them by touching you when you pass through, the sameway Richard took you through the more powerful shields.”Cara grunted disagreeably. She had been hoping that the shields would stop them.“Cara, I’ve been in the Keep thousands of times. It’s perfectly safe. We’re justgoing to the libraries. Just as you are my protector out in the world, in theKeep I will be yours. We are sisters of the Agiel. I won’t let you get anywherenear dangerous magic. Trust me?”“Well... I guess you are a sister of the Agiel. I can trust a sister of theAgiel.” They passed under the huge portcullis and onto the Keep grounds. Onceinside the massive outer walls, the snow melted as it touched the ground. Kahlanpushed back her hood. Inside the walls, it was warm and comfortable.She shook the snow from her cloak and took a deep breath of the spring-freshair, filling her lungs with the familiar, soothing scent. Nick whinniedagreeably.Kahlan led the two Mord-Sith across the stretch of gravel and stone chips to thearched opening in the wall that tunnelled under part of the Keep. As they passedthrough the long passageway, the lamps hanging from Cara and Berdine’s saddleslit the arched stone around them in an orange glow.“Why are we going through here?” Cara asked. “Lord Rahl took us in that big doorback there.”“I know. That’s one reason you’re afraid of the Keep. That was a very dangerousway to go in. I’m taking us to the way I usually enter. It’s much better. You’llsee.“It’s not the way visitors entered, either, but the way used by those who livedand worked here. The public came in at a different door. a place where they weregreeted by a guide who saw to their wants.”Beyond the tunnel, all three horses eyed the expansive paddock lush with grass.The gravel road ran beside the wall that held the main entrance to the Keep,with a fence on the other side of the road enclosing the paddock. To the left.part of the paddock was bounded by the walls of the Keep rather than a fence. Atthe rear were stables.Kahlan dismounted and opened the gate. After removing saddles and tack, allthree of them turned their horses loose in the paddock, where they could cropgrass and frisk in the mild air if they wished.A dozen wide granite steps, worn smooth and swayback over the millennia, led upinto a recessed entryway, to the simple but heavy double doors into the Keepproper. Cara and Berdine followed behind with the lamps. The anteroom swallowedthe lamplight into its vast space, only allowing the weak flames to hint at thecolumns and arches.“What’s that?” Berdine asked in a low whisper. “It sounds like a storm drain.”“There aren’t... rats in here, are there?”“Actually, it’s a fountain,” Kahlan said, her voice echoing into the distance.“And yes, Cara. there are rats in the Keep, but not where I’m taking you.Promise. Here, give me your lamp. Let me show you the bones of this menacingdungeon.”Kahlan took the lamp and strode to one of the key lamps on the wall to theright. She could walk there without the aid of the lamp, she had done it sooften, but she needed the lamp’s flame. She found the key lamp, tilled back thetall chimney, and lit it with the flame from Cara’s lamp.The key lamp took to flame. With a succession of whooshing sounds, the rest ofthe lamps in the room lit-hundreds of them-two at a time. in pairs, one to eachside. Each whoosh was followed almost simultaneously by another, as the lampsaround the huge room took to flame from the key lamp. The light in the roomgrew: the effect was like turning up the wick on a lamp.In a span of seconds, the anteroom was nearly as bright as day, bathed in themellow yellow-orange glow of all the flames. Cara and Berdine stood slack jawedat the sight.A hundred feet overhead the glassed roof was dark, but in the day, it floodedthe room with warmth and light. At night, if the sky was clear, you could turndown the lamps and gaze at the stars, or let the moonlight wash the room.In the center of the tiled floor stood a clover leaf-shaped fountain. Water shotfifteen feet into the air above the top bowl, to cascade down each successivetier into ever wider, scalloped bowls, finally running from evenly spaced pointsin the bottom one in perfectly matched arcs into the lower pool. An outer wallof variegated white marble was wide enough to act as a bench.Berdine stepped down one step of the five that ringed the room. “It’sbeautiful,” she whispered in astonishment.Cara gazed about at the red marble columns holding the arches below the balconythat ran all the way around the oval-shaped room. She had a smile on her lips.“This is nothing like the place Lord Rahl took us.” Cara frowned. “The lamps.That was magic. There is magic in here. You said you would keep us away frommagic.”“I said I would keep you away from dangerous magic. The lamps are kind of like ashield, except in reverse. Instead of keeping people out, they’re an enablingshield, to welcome and help them enter. It’s a friendly kind of magic, Cara.”“Friendly. Sure.”“Come on, we came here for a purpose. We have work to do.” Kahlan took them tothe libraries via the elegant, warm halls, rather than the frightening way theyhad gone before. They encountered only three shields. Kahlan’s magic allowed herto pass these, and by holding Cara and Berdine’s hands, it was possible to getthem through, too, though both complained about a tingling sensation.These shields didn’t guard dangerous areas, and so were weaker than others inthe Keep. There were shields that Kahlan couldn’t pass, like the ones Richardhad taken her through to go down to the sliph, though Kahlan thought there mightbe other ways to get down there. There were shields which Richard had gonethrough that in her experience no wizard had ever crossed before.They came to an intersection with a hall of light pink stone running down bothsides. At places, the hall opened into commodious rooms ringed with paddedbenches for conversing or reading. Beyond double doors in each of these largeouter rooms was a library.“I’ve been here,” Berdine said. “I remember this.”“Yes. Richard brought you here, but by a different route.” Kahlan continued onto the eighth sitting room, and went through the double doors into the librarythere. She used her lamp to light the key lamp, and as before, all the rest lit,lifting the room out of its pitch blackness, bringing it to life. The floorswere polished wood, with walls panelled in the same honey-colored oak. Duringthe day, glassed windows on the far wall bathed the room with light and provideda beautiful view of Aydindril. Now, through the snow, Kahlan could onlyoccasionally see the lights of the city below.She strode down the aisle between the reading tables and the rows upon rows ofbookshelves, looking for the one she remembered. In this room alone, there wereone hundred and forty-five rows of books. There were comfortable chairs to usewhile reading, but tonight they would need the tables to lay out the books.“So this is the library,” Cara said. “In D’Hara, at the People’s Palace, thereare libraries much larger than this.”“This is only one of twenty-six rooms like this. I can only imagine how manythousands of books are here in the Keep,” Kahlan said.“Then how are we ever going to find the ones we’re looking for?” Berdine asked.“It shouldn’t be as hard as it sounds. The libraries can be a bewildering mazewhen you wish to find something. I used to know a wizard who searched on and offhis whole life for a bit of information he knew was in the libraries. He neverfound it.”“Then how can we?”“Because there are a few things that are specialized enough that they are kepttogether. Books of language, for example. I can take you to all the books on anyspecific language, because they’re not about magic and so they’re in one place.I don’t know how books on magic and prophecy are organized, if they even are.“Anyway, this library is where certain records are kept. such as the records oftrials held here. I’ve not read them, but I was taught about them.”Kahlan turned and led them between two rows of shelves. Nearly midway down thefifty-foot-long aisle, she came to a halt.“Here they are. I can see by the writing on the spines that they’re in differentlanguages. Since I know all the languages but High D’Haran, I’ll search all theones in other languages. Cara, you look at the ones in ours, and Berdine, youtake the ones in High D’Haran.”The three of them started picking books from the shelves and carrying them tothe tables, separating them into three stacks. There weren’t as many as Kahlanhad feared. Berdine had only seven books, Cara had fifteen, and Kahlan eleven,in a variety of languages. For Berdine, it would be slow going translating theD’Haran, but Kahlan was fluent in the other languages, and she would be able tohelp with Cara’s stack as soon as she finished her own.As Kahlan started in, she quickly found that it was going to be easier thanshe’d first thought. Each trial began with a statement of the type of crime,making it simple to eliminate those that had nothing to do with the Temple ofthe Winds.There were charges against the accused ranging from the taking of a cherishedobject of little worth to murder. A sorceress was accused of casting a glamour,but was found innocent. A boy of twelve was accused of starting a fight in whichanother boy’s arm was broken; because the aggressor had used magic to cause theinjury, the sentence was the suspension of his training for a period of oneyear. A wizard was accused of being a drunkard, a third offense, the priorpunishments having failed to halt his belligerent behavior. He was found guiltyand sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out two days later, when he hadsobered.Habitually, drunken wizards were viewed not with tolerance but as the truedangers they were, capable, in their inebriated state, of causing mass injuryand death. Kahlan herself had seen wizards drink to excess only one time.The accounts of the trials were fascinating, but the seriousness of theirpurpose kept Kahlan skimming through the books, looking for a reference to theTemple of the Winds, or to a team charged with a crime. The other two weremaking quick progress, too. In an hour, Kahlan had finished all eleven books inthe other languages, Berdine had only three left, and Cara six. “Anything?”Kahlan asked.Cara lifted an eyebrow. “I just found an account of a wizard who fancied hikingup his robes in front of women in the market on Stentor Street and commandingthem to ‘kiss the serpent.’ I never knew wizards could get themselves in such avariety of trouble.”“They’re people, just like any other people.”“No, they’re not. They have magic,” Cara said. “So do I. Have you foundanything, Berdine?”“No, not what we’re looking for. Just common crimes.” Kahlan reached for one ofthe books Cara hadn’t been through, but paused. “Berdine, you were down in theroom with the sliph.” Berdine made a show of shivering and producing a sound ofrevulsion from deep in her throat. “Don’t remind me.”Kahlan shut her eyes, trying to remember the room. She remembered Kolo’s bones,and she remembered the sliph, but she only vaguely recalled what else was in theroom.“Berdine, do you remember if there were any other books down there?” Berdine bitdown on the end of a fingernail as she squinted in concentration. “I rememberfinding Kolo’s journal open on the table. An inkwell and pen. I remember Kolo’sbones, lying on the floor next to the chair, with most of his clothes long agorotted away. His leather belt was still around him.”Kahlan remembered much the same thing. “But do you remember if there were anybooks on the shelves?” Berdine turned her eyes up as she thought. “No.”“No there weren’t, or no you don’t remember?”“No, I don’t remember. Lord Rahl was really excited about finding Kolo’sjournal. He said it was something different from the books in the library, andhe felt it was what he had been searching for: something different. We leftright after that.”Kahlan stood. “You two keep looking through these books. I’m going down thereand have a look, just to be sure.”Cara’s chair clattered against the floor as she stood. “I will go with you.”“There are rats down there.”Her expression vexed, Cara put a hand on her hip. “I’ve seen rats before. I willgo with you.”Kahlan remembered well Cara’s story about the rats. “Cara, there’s no need. Idon’t need your protection in the Keep. Outside, yes, but in here I know thedangers better than you.“I told you I wouldn’t take you near dangerous magic. Down there is dangerousmagic.”“Then there is danger to you.”“No, because I know about it. You don’t. The danger would be to you, not me. Igrew up here. My own mother let me have the run of the Keep when I was a littlegirl because I was taught about the dangers and how to avoid them. I know whatI’m doing.“Please stay here with Berdine and finish going through the books. It will saveus time, and it’s important. The sooner we find the one we’re looking for, thesooner we can get home to watch over Richard. That’s where our real concern is.”Cara’s leather creaked as she shifted her weight. “I guess you would know thedangers of the magic here better than l. I think you’re right about gettinghome. Nadine is back there.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35Kahlan tried to overlay her mental map of the Keep on the passageways,stairwells. and rooms she traversed as she wound her way lower. Rats squeakedand skittered away from her lamp.Although she had often seen the tower outside Kolo’s room from the ramparts andwalkways up on top of the Keep, she had never been down inside it until Richardhad taken her there. Unfortunately, Richard had taken her there by way ofdangerous passages, through shields she would never be able to get through onher own.She was confident that there were other routes down to Kolo’s room. There werevast areas of the Keep that weren’t protected by any shields at all. She hadonly to find a way without shields, or with shields that her magic would be ableto pass. The areas that Richard had taken her, protected by dangerous shields,she didn’t know at all, since she had never been beyond those before, but shewas familiar with a myriad of ways to get around them.Oftentimes the “hard shields,” as the wizards used to call them, were meant toprotect something just beyond, rather than specifically to prevent passage toanother area. Many of the rooms Richard had taken her through were like that:places of menacing magic she had never seen before. They oftentimes provided amore direct route, but required special magic.If she was correct, that Richard had traversed a maze through dangerous places,rather than going through hard shields specifically protecting the tower, thenthere would be a way around the dangerous areas and into the tower room. In herexperience, that was the way the Keep worked: if the tower room was meant to beoff-limits, then it would be protected by its own hard shields. If it wasn’tforbidden, then there would be at least one way she could enter. She had but tofind it.Even though she had spent a great deal of time in the Keep. much of that timewas spent in the libraries studying. She had explored, of course, but the Keepwas almost inconceivably vast. Not only was the part that could be seen from theoutside immense, but much more of the Keep was burrowed into the mountain. Theouter walls were only the tip of the Keep, the visible part of the tooth, withmuch more of the root hidden beneath.Kahlan went through an empty room, chiselled from bedrock, to one of thepassages on the other side. There were numerous empty rooms in the Wizards’Keep. Some of them, like the one she had just passed through, seemed nothingmore than junctions where various passages connected, possibly enlarged toprovide reference points.The square-sided passage through the rock ahead appeared carefully cut andsmoothed. Her lamp illuminated bands of symbols incised in the granite, withround areas in the field of swirling carvings polished to a high lustre. Eachencircling band marked the location of a mild shield that tingled against herflesh as she passed through.Ahead, she saw the hall split into three passageways. Before she reached thejunction, the air about her suddenly hummed. It took two steps before she couldhalt her onward rush. Each of those two steps caused the hum to raise in pitchto an uncomfortable buzzing. Her long hair lifted from her shoulders and back tostand straight out in all directions. The band carved in the stone aheadimmediately began to glow red.Kahlan retreated several paces. The humming lowered in pitch. Her hair settleddown.She cursed under her breath. A humming shield was an urgent warning to stayaway. The red glow displayed the region of the shield itself. The hum warnedthat you were entering the field of a dangerous shield.Some of these hard shields would actually prevent a person without the requiredmagic from getting too close, by making the very air get as thick as mud, andthen stone. Some of the humming shields didn’t prevent entry, but walking intoone would sear the flesh and muscle right off a person’s bones. The lessershields were meant to keep people without magic, and thus knowledge, fromgetting close to the danger.Kahlan turned and held up the lamp as she quickly retraced her steps to theroom. She took a different passageway that ran in the general direction shewanted to go. It was a much more congenial-looking hall, with whitewashed wallsand ceiling, making the lamp better able to brighten her way.She encountered no shields at all in the white hall. A stairway took her lowerinto the Keep. Another stone hall at the bottom provided quick travel devoid ofshields. In her mind, she was retracing the halls, rooms, stairs, and crampedtunnels, and was pretty sure that, by eliminating the false routes she hadtaken, there was a way to get to and from the tower without encountering anyshields.Kahlan threw open the door at the end of the stone hall and stepped out onto awalkway with an iron railing. She held the lamp up in front of her. She stood atthe bottom level of the tower.The walkway ringed the hall. Stairs wound their way up around the inside of theimmense stone tower, with landings at other doors along the way. In the center,at the bottom of the tower, lurked a pool of black water. Rocks broke thesurface of the water here and there. Bugs skittered across the inky surface ofthe pool. Salamanders rested on the rocks, their eyes rolling to watch her.This was the place where she and Richard had fought the mriswith queen. Herstinking, broken eggs still littered the rock. Small bits of the door blastedfrom Kolo’s room still floated in the pool, providing islands for fat bugs thathissed at the intrusion.Across the water, on the opposite side of the round tower room, was the openingto Kolo’s room.Kahlan quickly made her way around the walkway to the wide platform outsideKolo’s room. The doorway had been blown open, leaving blackened, jagged edges.In some places the stone itself was melted like candle wax. The tower walloutside the doorway was streaked with blackened lines of soot from the unleashedpower that had opened Kolo’s room for the first time in millennia.When Richard had destroyed the Towers of Perdition, it had destroyed the magicseal on this room, too. The towers had sealed the Old World away from the New inthe great war three thousand years before. They had also sealed the room withthe sliph, and sealed in the man who had been unfortunate enough to be the oneguarding her at the time.Stone fragments crunched under her feet as Kahlan stepped into the room whereKolo had died, the room where dwelled the sliph. The silence was oppressive. Itdroned in her ears. making her welcome the relief of her footsteps.Richard had awakened the sliph after thousands of years. The sliph had takenRichard to the Old World, and had brought him and Kahlan safely back toAydindril. When they returned, Richard had put the sliph back to sleep. All theyears Kahlan had spent in the Keep, and she had never known the sliph was there.Kahlan couldn’t even imagine the magic the wizards of old could use to conjure abeing such as the sliph, or how they could have put her to sleep for all thattime. so that she could wake again. Only at the fringes of her imagination couldshe conceive of the power Richard wielded, but didn’t comprehend.What would the war wizards of old, who knew their gift well, have been able todo with such unfathomable magic? What terrors would a war among those with thatkind of power have been like? The very thought gave her shivers.It would have been things like the plague that had been set upon them, now. Theycould do those kinds of things.The lamplight fell across Kolo’s bones beside the chair. The pen and inkwellstill sat on the dusty table. The round room, nearly sixty feet across, wascapped with a high-domed ceiling, itself nearly as tall as the room was wide.In the center was a round stone wall, like a well, twenty-five or thirty feetacross. There dwelled the sliph. Kahlan held the light over the wall of thewell, and glanced briefly down the smooth stone walls of the dark shaft thatfell away seemingly forever.The walls of the room were scorched in ragged lines as if lightning had gonewild in the place-another result of the same magic Richard had invoked when hedestroyed the towers and when the doorway had been blasted open. Kahlan strodequickly around the room, checking to see if there was anything that might beuseful. There was nothing in the room, other than the table, chair, and Kolo,except for a dusty set of shelves.Kahlan was disappointed to find that there were no books on the shelves. Therewere three faded blue, glazed, lidded containers, probably once holding water orsoup for the wizard on duty guarding the sliph. A white, glazed bowl held asilver spoon. A neatly folded cloth, or embroidery of some sort, sat on one ofthe shelves. When she touched it, it disintegrated into dust and little flakeswhere her fingers contacted it.Kahlan bent lower, seeing that the bottom shelf held only a few spare candlesand a lamp.An abrupt sensation of icy alarm inundated her. She was being watched.She froze, holding her breath, telling herself that it was just her imagination.The fine hairs at the back of her neck stiffened. She felt a cold wave ofgooseflesh run up her arms.She strained to hear a telling sound. Her toes cringed inside her boots. Shefeared to move. Carefully, quietly, she let her lungs draw a needed breath.Slowly, ever so slowly, so as not to make a sound, she straightened a little.She dared not move her feet lest the stone chips crunch.Courage, as thin as eggshells, urged her to hide behind the wall of the sliph’swell. From there, she could determine if it was only her imagination spookingher. Perhaps it was just a rat.She twisted to check the distance to the stone wall. Kahlan sucked a cry as sheflinched back."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36The quicksilver face of the sliph had risen above the edge of the stone wall andwas watching her.The glossy metallic female features of the sliph reflected the lamplight and theroom in a living mirror. It was obvious why Kolo called the sliph “she.” Thesliph was a silver statue. Except it moved with liquid grace.Kahlan pressed a hand to her hammering heart as she panted, getting her breath.The sliph watched her, as if curious about what Kahlan might do next. Kolo oftensaid in his journal that “she” was watching him. “Sliph...” Kahlan stammered.“What are you doing-awake?” The face distorted into a puzzled frown. “Do youwish to travel?” The eerie voice echoed around the room. Her lips hadn’t movedas she spoke, but she smiled pleasantly.“Travel? No.” Kahlan took a step toward the well. “Sliph, Richard put you tosleep. I was here.”“Master. He woke me.”“Yes, Richard woke you. He travelled in you. He rescued me, and I travelled backwith him... in you.”Kahlan recalled that strange experience with a certain fondness. To travel inthe sliph, you had to breathe her in. It was frightening at first, but withRichard there holding her hand, Kahlan had been able to do it, and haddiscovered the enthralling sensation of “travelling.” To breathe the sliph wasrapture.“I remember,” the sliph said. “Once you are in me, I remember.”“But don’t you remember Richard putting you to sleep again?”“He woke me from the sleep of ages, but he did not put me back into the longsleep. He put me at rest, until I was needed.”“But we thought-we thought you had gone back to sleep. Why are you not at...rest, now?”“I felt you near. I came to look.”Kahlan stepped to the stone wall. “Sliph, has someone travelled in you sinceRichard and I last did?”“Yes. I was used.”Suddenly realization broke through her surprise. “A man and a woman. Theytravelled in you, didn’t they?” The sliph’s smile turned sly, but she didn’tanswer.Kahlan touched her fingers to the stone wall. “Who was it, sliph, who travelledin you?”“You should know that I never betray those I hold within me.”“I should know? How would I know?”“You have travelled in me. I would not reveal you. I never betray my clients.You travelled, so you must understand.”Kahlan licked her lips patiently. “Sliph, I’m afraid that I don’t know anythingabout you, really. You are from a time before my time-from another age. I onlyknow that you can travel, and that you helped me before. You were a valuable aidin defeating some very bad people.”“I am glad that you were pleased with me. Perhaps you would like to be pleasedagain? Would like to travel again?”A shiver ran up Kahlan’s spine. This had to be why Marlin was trying to get tothe Keep. He and Sister Amelia must have come to Aydindril from the Old World inthe sliph. Jagang had said he had waited to reveal himself until she returned.How else could she have returned to him so fast, except in the sliph? Kahlanswept out an imploring arm. “Sliph, some very evil people...” She halted,sucking a breath through her open mouth. Her eyes widened. “Sliph,” shewhispered, “you took me to the Old World before.”“Ah. I know the place. Come, we will travel.”“No, no, not there. Sliph, can you travel other places?”“Of course.”“Where?”“Many places. You must know. You have travelled. Name the place that wouldpleasure you, and we will travel.” Kahlan leaned toward the alluring, smilingsilver face. ‘The witch woman. Can you take me to the witch woman?”“I do not know this place.”“It’s not a place. It’s a person. She lives in the Rang’Shada mountains. In aplace called Agaden Reach. Can you go there, to Agaden Reach?”“Ah. I have been there.” Kahlan touched her trembling fingers to her lips.“Come, and we will travel,” the sliph said, her haunting voice echoing aroundthe ancient stone walls. The sound died out slowly, letting silence settle oncemore, covering everything, like the veil of dust in the room.Kahlan cleared her throat. “I have to go do something, first. Will you still behere when I get back? Will you wait for me?”“If I am at rest, you can let me know of your need, and we will travel. You willbe pleased.”“You mean, if you’re not right here, I should call down to you, and you willcome to me, and we will travel?”“Yes. We will travel.”Kahlan rubbed her hands together as she backed away. “I’ll be back. I’ll be backsoon, and we will travel.”“Yes,” the sliph said, watching Kahlan retreat, “we will travel.” Kahlansnatched the lamp from where she had set it on the floor near the shelves. Shepaused at the door, looking back at the quicksilver face floating in the gloom.“I’ll be back. Soon. We will travel.”“Yes. We will travel,” the sliph said as Kahlan started running. Kahlan had tostruggle to think where she was going as she ran. Her mind spun with arguments.While she grappled with her alternatives, she also tried to pay attention as sheturned down halls, raced through rooms, and dashed upstairs. She seemed to reachLibrary Hall before she was ready. Huffing, she realized that she couldn’t runin on Cara and Berdine in such a state. They would know something was wrong.Not far from the library where the two Mord-Sith waited, Kahlan collapsed onto apadded bench, letting the lamp slip to the floor. She leaned back against thewall and stretched out her aching legs. She fanned her face with one hand. Shegulped air, and tried to convince her heart to slow down. She knew her face mustbe red as an apple.She couldn’t walk in on the other two like this. Kahlan made plans as sherested, waiting for her heart to slow, her lungs to recover, her face to cool.Shota knew something about the plague. Kahlan was sure of it. Shota had saidabout Richard, “May the spirits have mercy on his soul.”Shota had sent Nadine to marry Richard. Kahlan vividly recollected Nadine’stight dress, her flirtatious smiles, her accusations, telling Richard thatKahlan was heartless. The look in Nadine’s eyes when she talked to him.Kahlan thought about what she must do. Shota was a witch woman. Everyone fearedthe witch woman. Even wizards feared Shota. Kahlan had never done anythingagainst her, but that had never stopped Shota from hurting her. Shota might killher. Not if Kahlan killed her first.The distraction of making plans had allowed her to regain her composure. Shestood, smoothed down her dress, and took a deep, settling breath.Kahlan put on her Confessor’s face and strode through the doors to the librarywhere the other two waited.Cara and Berdine popped out from behind a row of bookshelves. The books weregone from the table.Cara eyed Kahlan suspiciously. “You’ve been gone long enough.”“It took me a while to find a way with shields I could pass.” Berdine came outfrom behind the shelves. “Well? Did you find anything?”“Find anything? Like what?”Berdine spread her hands. “Books. You went to look for books.”“No. Nothing.”Cara was frowning. “Did you have any problems?”“No. I’m just upset about all this... about everything. The plague and all. I’mupset that I couldn’t find anything to help. What about you two?”Berdine swiped a stray strand of hair back from her face. “Nothing. Nothingabout the Temple of the Winds or the team who sent it away.”“I don’t understand,” Kahlan said, mostly to herself. “If there was a trial, asKolo said, then there should be a record of it.”“Well,” Berdine said, “we were looking through the other books to see if wemissed any of the records of the trials. We didn’t find any. Where else can welook?”Kahlan sagged in disappointment. She had been sure they would find a record ofthe trial for Richard.“Nowhere. If it isn’t here, then there must be no record of the trial, or elseit was destroyed. From what Kolo said, the Keep was in an uproar at the time;they may have been too busy to keep a record.”Berdine cocked her head. “But we’re going to keep looking for part of the night,at least.” Kahlan looked about the library. “No. It would be a waste of time.The time would be better spent if you kept working on Kolo’s journal. If wedon’t have the record of the trial, translating the journal would be the besthelp to Richard. Maybe you can find something important in the journal.”In the brightness of the library, Kahlan’s resolve was beginning to falter. Shebegan to reconsider her plan.“Well,” Cara said, “I guess we better get back, then. No telling what Nadinewill be up to. If she gets into Lord Rahl’s room, she’ll get blisters kissinghim while he’s asleep and helpless.”Berdine pressed her lips tight and smacked Cara’s shoulder. “What’s the matterwith you? The Mother Confessor is a sister of the Agiel.”Cara blinked in surprise. “Forgive me. I was only making a joke.” She touchedKahlan’s arm. “You know that I will kill Nadine if you wish-you have but to ask.Don’t worry, Raina would not let Nadine into his room.”Kahlan wiped a tear from her cheek. “I know. It’s just that with all that’sgoing on- I know.”Her mind was made up. It might help Richard find an answer. It might helpRichard discover something that would stop the plague. Kahlan knew she was onlymaking excuses to herself. She knew why she was going.“Did you find what you were looking for?” Raina asked as Kahlan, Cara, andBerdine approached.“No,” Kahlan said. “There was no record of the trial.”“I’m sorry,” Raina said.Kahlan gestured to the door. “Has anyone tried to bother him?” Raina smirked.“She came by. She wanted to check on Lord Rahl. To make sure he was sleeping,she said.”Kahlan didn’t have to ask who came by. Her blood heated. “And you let her in?”Raina smiled that dark smile of hers. “I put my head in, saw that Lord Rahl wasasleep, and told her so. I didn’t let her have so much as a peek at him.”“Good. But she’ll probably be back.”Raina’s smile widened. “I don’t think so. I told her that if I caught her inthis hall again tonight, she would feel my Agiel against her bare bottom. Whenshe left, there was no doubt in her mind that I meant it.” Cara laughed. Kahlancouldn’t.“Raina, it’s late. Why don’t you and Berdine go get some sleep.” Kahlan caughtthe quick glance to Berdine. “Berdine, just like Lord Rahl, needs to get somerest so that she can work on the journal tomorrow. We all need some rest. Ulicand Egan here will watch over Richard.”Raina slapped the back of her hand against Ulic’s stomach. “You boys up to it?Can you handle it without me?”Ulic scowled down at the Mord-Sith. “We are the Lord Rahl’s bodyguards. Ifanyone tried to get into his room, there wouldn’t be enough left for you to pickyour teeth with.”Raina shrugged. “I guess the boys can handle it. Let’s go, Berdine. It’s abouttime you got a good night’s sleep for a change.”Cara stood beside Kahlan as she watched Berdine and Raina stride off down thehall, passing a critical eye over soldiers on patrol.“You are right about rest. You need to get some sleep, too. Mother Confessor,”Cara said. “You don’t look well.”“I... I want to check on Richard first. I’ll be able to sleep better if I knowhe’s all right. I’ll be back out in a minute.” She gave Cara a firm look todiscourage any ideas she might have about going in with her. “Why don’t you goget some sleep, too?”Cara clasped her hands behind her back. “I will wait.”Richard’s room was dark, but the light coming from the window proved enough tofind the bed. Kahlan stood beside him and listened to his even breathing.She knew how distressed Richard was by recent events. She felt the same pain.How many families were suffering in grief this night? How many more would besuffering the next, and the night after?Kahlan sat lightly on the edge of the bed. She slipped an arm under hisshoulders and strained to gently lift him. He murmured her name under his breathin his sleep, but didn’t wake as she sat him up a bit and leaned the heavyweight of him against her.Kahlan reached behind and picked up the glass with the sleeping potion Nadinehad made. It was still half full. She held it to his mouth and tipped it,letting the potion slide to his lips. He stirred slightly, and swallowed as shetipped the glass higher.“Drink, Richard.” she urged in a whisper. She kissed his forehead. “Drink, mylove. It will help you sleep.”She tipped the glass a little more each time he swallowed, forcing him to drinkmore. When he had taken most of it, she set it behind once more. He murmured hername again.Kahlan hugged his head, holding his cheek to her breast. She pressed her cheekto the top of his head as a tear rolled over the bridge of her nose and fellinto his hair.“I love you so much, Richard,” she whispered. “No matter what, don’t ever doubthow much I love you.”He mumbled something she couldn’t understand, except for the word “love.” Kahlaneased him back onto the pillow and slipped her arm out from underneath him. Shepulled up his covers.She kissed her finger, and gently pressed the kiss to his lips, before she leftthe room.On the way to her own room, she again told Cara that she should go get somesleep.“I will not leave you unguarded,” Cara insisted. “Cara, you need sleep, too.”Cara glanced over out of the comer of her eye. “I have no intention of lettingLord Rahl down again.” When Kahlan started to protest, Cara spoke over herwords. “I will be posting soldiers outside your room. too. I can nap there, andif anything happens I will be at hand. I’ll get enough sleep.” Kahlan had thingsto do. She needed Cara out of her hair. “You saw how Richard was when he didn’tget enough sleep.” Cara let out a dismissive chuckle. “Mord-Sith are strongerthan men. Besides, he was like that because he hadn’t slept for days. I sleptlast night.”Kahlan didn’t want to argue. She was frantically trying to think of how toovercome this obstacle in skintight leather. She couldn’t let Cara know what shewas doing. Sister of the Agiel or not, Cara would tell Richard; there was nodoubt of that.That was the last thing Kahlan wanted. Under no circumstances did she wantRichard knowing what she was going to do. She would have to think of a new plan.“I don’t know if I’m ready for bed. I’m kind of hungry.”“You look tired. Mother Confessor. You need sleep, not food. You won’t sleep aswell if you eat right before bed. I want you to get a good sleep, like LordRahl. You can sleep well knowing that Nadine will not be going near him. I havea good idea of what Raina said to Nadine, and I can assure you that as brazen asthat strumpet is, she has enough sense to heed a warning from Raina. You have nocause for fear tonight, so you can sleep well.”“Cara, what are you afraid of? Besides magic, and rats.” Cara scowled. “I don’tlike rats. I am not afraid of them.” Kahlan didn’t believe a word of it. Shewaited until they were out of earshot of a patrol passing in the oppositedirection. “What scares you? What do you fear?”“Nothing.”“Cara,” Kahlan admonished, “it’s me, Kahlan, a sister of the Agiel. Everyone isafraid of something.”“I wish to die in battle, not weak and sick in a bed, at the hands of someunseen foe. I fear Lord Rahl getting the plague, and leaving us without a Masterof D’Hara.”“I’m afraid of that. too,” Kahlan whispered. “I’m afraid of Richard getting theplague, and everyone else I love. You, Berdine, Raina, Ulic, Egan, and everyoneI know here at the palace.”“Lord Rahl will find a way to stop it.”Kahlan hooked some hair behind her ear. “Are you afraid of not finding a man whowill love you?”Cara flashed Kahlan an incredulous look. “Why would I be afraid of that? I havebut to give any man permission to love me, and he would.”Kahlan let her gaze drift from Cara to the columns at the sides of the room theywere passing through. Their boot strikes echoed off the marble floor.“I love Richard. A Confessor’s magic will destroy a man if she loves him- youknow, when they’re... together. Only because Richard is special, has specialmagic, can he love me in return. I’m terrified of losing him. I want no one butRichard-ever-but even if I wanted, I couldn’t. No other man could express hislove for me except Richard. I could never have anyone else.”Cara’s voice softened in sympathy. “Lord Rahl will find a way to stop theplague.”They passed from the marble floor onto the quiet of carpets running up thestairs toward Kahlan’s room.“Cara, I’m terrified of losing Richard to Nadine.”“Lord Rahl does not care for Nadine. I can see it in his eyes that he has nointerest in her. Lord Rahl only has eyes for you.”Kahlan ran her fingers along the smooth marble railing as she ascended thestairs. “Cara, a witch woman sent Nadine.” Cara had no answer for that; magicwas involved.When they came at last to the door to her rooms, Kahlan paused. She looked intoCara’s blue eyes. “Cara, will you make me a promise? As a sister of the Agiel?”“If I can.”“With all that’s going on-so much has gone wrong already. Will you promise methat if. . . if something happens, if I somehow make a mistake, the worstmistake I’ve ever made, and I somehow get things wrong... will you promise methat you won’t let it be her, instead of me. who has Richard?”“What could happen? Lord Rahl loves you, not that woman.”“Anything could happen. The plague-Shota-anything. Please, Cara. I couldn’t bearto think that if anything happened, Nadine would have my place with Richard.”Kahlan clutched Cara’s arm. “Please, I’m begging you. Promise me?”Cara’s intent blue eyes stared back. Mord-Sith didn’t take oaths lightly. Kahlanknew that she was asking for something of solemn importance: she was asking Carato swear her life on this, for that was what it meant for a Mord-Sith to giveher word.Cara brought her Agiel up in her fist. She kissed it. “Nadine will not have yourplace with Lord Rahl. I swear it.” Kahlan nodded, words failing her for amoment.“Get some sleep. Mother Confessor. I will be here, watching your rooms. No onewill bother you. You can sleep well, knowing that Nadine will never take yourplace. You have my oath.”“Thank you, Cara,” Kahlan whispered in gratitude. “You truly are a sister of theAgiel. If you ever want a favor in return, you have but to name it.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37Kahlan was finally able to send away Nancy and her helper, telling them that shewas exhausted and wanted only to go to bed. She had to decline an offer of abath, having her hair brushed, a massage, and food; but she let Nancy help herwith her dress so as not to raise the woman’s suspicion.Kahlan rubbed her bare arms in the chill after she was alone at last. She testedher wound, under the bandage. It was healing well, and hardly hurt her anymore.Drefan had helped it, and she supposed that Nadine’s poultices had been abenefit, too.Kahlan slipped on a dressing gown and went to the writing desk beside one of thehearths. The heat felt good, but it only warmed one side of her. She pulledpaper and pen from a drawer. As she took the silver lid from the ink bottle, shetried to organize her thoughts, and what she would write. At last, she dippedthe pen.My dearest Richard,I have something important to do, and I have to do it alone. I am serious aboutthis. Not only because I respect you, but because you are the Seeker, I bow towhat you sometimes do that I wish would be otherwise. I understand that I mustsometimes allow you to do what you know you must. I am the Mother Confessor; youmust understand that I must sometimes do what I must. This is one of thosetimes. Please, if you love me, then you will respect my wishes, not interfere,and leave me to do what I must.I have had to trick Cara, which I greatly regret. She does not know anything ofwhat I plan. She did not know I was leaving. If you hold her liable for this, Iwill view it with the greatest displeasure.I don’t know when I will return, but I expect that I will be gone for a fewdays. I am doing this to help our situation. I beg you to understand and not beangry with me- I must do this.Signed, the Mother Confessor, your queen, your love for all time, in this worldand those beyond-Kahlan.Kahlan folded the letter and wrote Richard’s name on the outside. She opened itand read it again, just to be sure she hadn’t revealed anything she didn’t wantto him to know. She was satisfied with “to help our situation.” It was vagueenough to mean anything. She hoped she wasn’t being too harsh with the way sheinsisted he not interfere.Kahlan brought a candle close and heated the end of a stick of colored sealingwax from the drawer. She watched the wax drip onto the letter, making a redpool, and then pressed the Mother Confessor’s seal-twin lightning bolts-into thewarm wax. She kissed the letter, blew out the candle, and propped the letteragainst it so it couldn’t be missed.She never used to know why the Mother Confessor’s seal was twin lightning bolts,but she did now; it was the symbol of the Con Dar-the Blood Rage-an ancientcomponent to a Confessor’s magic. It was magic so rarely invoked that she hadnever known of it; her mother had died before she could teach Kahlan to call itforth if needed.After she had met Richard and fallen in love with him, she had invoked it byinstinct. In the grip of that magic, she had painted a lightning bolt on eachcheek as a warning to others not to get in her way. A Confessor in the Con Darcouldn’t be reasoned with.The Blood Rage was the Subtractive side of a Confessor’s magic, invoked forretribution. Kahlan had brought it to life within herself when she thoughtDarken Rahl had killed Richard. It was called forth on behalf of someone, andcould only be used to defend that person. It couldn’t be used to defend herself.Like her Confessor’s power, which she had always felt in the core of her being,the Con Dar was always there, now, just below the surface, a menacing stormcloud on the horizon. She had felt it instantly rip through her when she neededit to protect Richard: blue lightning that destroyed all before it.Without the Subtractive as well as the common Additive Magic, a person couldn’ttravel in the sliph. The Sisters of the Dark, and the wizards who had become theKeeper’s minions, could call on Subtractive Magic, too.Kahlan went into her bedroom. She stripped off the dressing robe and tossed iton the bed. She pulled open the bottom drawer of the ornately carved chest andpawed through her things, looking for what she needed.Inside were clothes she had worn before, when she had been on her journeys,better suited to what she was going to do than was her white Mother Confessor’sdress. She stepped into dark green pants. She pulled out a heavy shirt and threwit on, buttoning it up with shaking fingers. She tucked in the shirt and buckledthe wide belt. She left the waist pouch.From the back of the drawer, Kahlan retrieved an object carefully wrapped in asquare of white cloth. She set it on the floor and, crouching over it, laid backthe corners of the cloth.Even though she knew what it was, and what it looked like, she couldn’t helpfeeling a shiver when she actually saw it again.Atop the cloth sat the spirit knife Chandalen had given her. It was a weaponmade from the arm bone of his grandfather.This knife had saved her life before. She had used it to kill Prindin, a man whohad been her friend, but who had turned to the Keeper.At least, she thought she had killed him; she didn’t remember exactly what hadhappened that day. She had, at the time, been under the influence of the poisonPrindin had been giving her. She wasn’t entirely sure that it wasn’t the spiritof Chandalen’s grandfather who had saved her. Prindin had lunged atop her, andthe knife seemed just to be there, in her hand. She remembered his blood runningdown the knife and over her fist.Inky black raven feathers spread in a fan from the round knob of bone at thetop. Raven was powerful spirit magic to the Mud People; it was associated withdeath.Chandalen’s grandfather had sought the aid of the spirits to protect his peoplefrom slaughter by another people of the wilds who had gone mad with the bloodlust of war. No one knew the reason, but the result was a bloodbath.Chandalen’s grandfather had called a gathering to ask the spirits for theirhelp. His people were peaceful, and didn’t know how to defend themselves. Thespirits had taught Chandalen’s grandfather how to kill the Jocopo, and in sodoing, they became the Mud People. The Mud People defended themselves, andeliminated the threat. There were no more Jocopo.Chandalen’s grandfather had taught his son to be a protector of his people, andChandalen’s father had in turn taught Chandalen. Kahlan knew few men who were asgood protectors of their people as Chandalen. In a battle with the army of theImperial Order, Chandalen had been death itself. So had she.Chandalen wore this spirit knife made from his grandfather’s bones, and one madefrom his father’s. Chandalen had given Kahlan the one made from his grandfather,so that it might protect her. Indeed, it once had. Maybe it would again. Kahlanreverently lifted the bone knife in her hands.“Grandfather of Chandalen, you helped me before. Please protect me now.” Shekissed the sharpened bone.If she was to face Shota, Kahlan didn’t want to do it unarmed. She could thinkof no better weapon to carry.She tied the band made of woven prairie cotton around her arm and slipped theknife through it. It lay against her upper arm, with the black feathers drapeddown over it. It was a surprisingly quick weapon to draw, held to her arm as itwas. Even though she was going to see a woman she feared, Kahlan felt decidedlybetter with grandfather’s spirit knife.Kahlan pulled a light tan cloak from another drawer. She would have liked tohave taken one that was heavier, considering the spring snowstorm, but shewasn’t liable to be out in it all that long. Agaden Reach wouldn’t be cold, asit was in Aydindril.She was hoping that the light color would help her slip unnoticed past theguards up at the Keep, and besides, with the light cloak, she could draw theknife faster.She wondered if it was folly to think she could draw her bone knife faster thanShota could cast a spell, or if such a weapon would even be of any use against awitch woman. She threw the cloak around her shoulders. The knife was all shehad.Other than her Confessor’s power. Shota was wary of a Confessor’s power: no onewas immune to the touch of a Confessor. If Kahlan could touch Shota, that wouldbe the end of her. Shota had magic that in the past had prevented Kahlan fromgetting close enough to use her power, though.But Kahlan wouldn’t have to be touching Shota for the blue lightning of the ConDar to work. She gave a mental sigh; she couldn’t invoke the Con Dar to defendherself. Kahlan had defended Richard with the lightning before when thescreeling had attacked him, and when the Sisters of the Light had come to takehim.Kahlan felt a wave of realization course through her mind. Richard loved her andwanted to marry her; to be with her always. Shota had defied his wishes and sentNadine to marry him. He didn’t want that.Even disregarding the fact that Richard loved Kahlan, Nadine had caused himanguish, hurt him. He didn’t want to be with her, and only tolerated herpresence because Shota was up to something and he feared to let that threat outof his sight. But he desperately didn’t want to be forced to marry her. Shotawas banning Richard.Richard was in danger because of Shota. Kahlan could call the Con Dar to defendhim. She had done it before at the threat of the Sisters taking Richard againsthis wishes. Kahlan could use the blue lightning to stop Shota. Shota had nodefense against that kind of magic.Kahlan knew how magic worked. This was magic from within her. Like the magic ofRichard’s sword, it worked through perception. If Kahlan felt justified in itsuse to defend Richard, the Con Dar would do her bidding. She knew Richard didn’twant Shota using him, controlling him, dictating what his life would be.Kahlan had justification: Shota was harming Richard. The Con Dar would workagainst her.Kahlan paused, sitting back on her heels, and prayed to the good spirits thatthey would guide her. She wouldn’t want to think she was doing this forvengeance, or that she was setting out to murder someone. She didn’t want tothink that she intended to kill Shota. She wondered if she was trying to putjustification to something that couldn’t be justified.No. she wasn’t going with the intention of killing Shota. She was just going toget to the bottom of this business with Nadine, and to find out what Shota knewabout the Temple of the Winds.But if she had to, Kahlan intended to defend herself. Moreover, she intended todefend Richard against Shota-against her plans to ruin his future. Kahlan hadhad enough of being at the unfavorable end of Shota’s capricious ire. If Shotatried to kill her, or tried to force this suffering on Richard, then Kahlanwould end the threat.Kahlan already missed Richard. For so long they had struggled to be together,and here she was leaving him. If the situation were reversed, would she be asunderstanding as she was expecting him to be?At the thought of Richard, she slowly pulled open the top drawer to her mostprized of possessions. Reverently, she lifted her blue wedding dress from itsplace as the only item in the drawer. Her thumbs stroked the fine fabric. Kahlanclutched the dress to her breast as tears took her.She carefully set the dress back in its place in the drawer before she got tearson it. For a long moment, she stood there with one hand on the dress.She pushed the drawer closed. She had a job to do. She was the Mother Confessor,whether she liked it or not; Shota lived in the Midlands, and was therefore oneof her subjects.Kahlan didn’t want to die and never see Richard again, but she could no longertolerate Shota’s meddling in their lives-her tampering with their future. Shotahad sent another woman to marry Richard. Kahlan wouldn’t allow that kind ofinterference to go unchecked.Her resolve hardened. She reached into the back of a wardrobe and pulled aknotted rope from a peg. It was there in case of fire, so that the MotherConfessor could escape from the balcony.Opening the glass doors gave her a shock of snarling wind and snow. Kahlansquinted against the storm and pulled the doors shut behind her. She drew up thehood and stuffed her hair inside it. It would do no good to have peoplerecognizing the Mother Confessor-if anyone was even out on a night like this.But she knew that the guards up at the Wizards’ Keep would be.She quickly secured the rope around one of the vase-shaped stone balusters andtossed the rest of the heavy coil out over the railing. In the darkness, shecouldn’t see if it reached to the ground. She would have to trust that whoeverhad put the rope in the wardrobe had checked to make sure that it was longenough.Kahlan swung a leg over the stone railing, gripped the rope in both hands, andstarted down.Kahlan had decided to walk. It wasn’t that far, and besides, if she took ahorse, she would have to leave it at the Keep and it might be found, giving heraway, or else she’d have to turn it loose before she got there, only raisingfears as to what had happened to her. A horse would also make it more difficultto get past the guards up at the Keep. The good spirits had provided her with aspring snowstorm; the least she could do was take advantage of it.Tramping through the heavy, wet snow, she was beginning to wonder if going onfoot was the wise thing to do. She stiffened her resolve. If she was alreadybeginning to second-guess her decisions, she had no business going through withthe rest of it.Most of the buildings were shuttered. The few people she encountered were tooworried about making their own way to be concerned with a huddled figurestruggling into the wind. In the darkness, no one would even be able to tell ifshe was a man or a woman. Before long, she was out of the city and on thedeserted road up to the Keep.All the way up the road, she pondered the best way past the guards. These wereD’Haran soldiers. It was always a mistake to underestimate D’Haran soldiers. Itwouldn’t do to have them recognize her. They would report it.Killing sentries was the easiest way to get past them, but she couldn’t do that;they were her men, now, fighting for their cause against the Imperial Order.Killing them was out of the question.Whacking them across the skull to knock them unconscious was no good, either.That was never a dependable way to silence someone. In her experience, hitting aman across the head rarely had the desired result. Sometimes they would not beknocked unconscious and would scream at the top of their lungs before anythingelse could be done, raising an alarm and bringing other guards ready to kill theintruder.Besides, she had seen men suffer and die from a blow on the head. She didn’twant that. You only hit someone on the head if you intended to kill them,because you most likely would.The Sister and Marlin had probably used magic to get by the guards unseen. Shedidn’t have any magic that could do that. Her magic would destroy their minds.That left either a trick, or stealth. D’Haran sentries were trained in everykind of trick, and probably knew more of them than she could even imagine. Shewas down to stealth.She wasn’t sure exactly where she was, but she knew she was getting close. Thewind was coming from the left, so she stayed to the right of the road, downwindof them, crouching lower us she went on. When she got close enough, she wouldhave to crawl.If she laid down on the snow. spread her cloak out over her, and waited for ashort time. the snow would cover her back and hide her. Then she would have toproceed slowly, and if she saw a soldier, simply lie still until he passed. Shewished she had remembered to bring gloves.Deciding that she was as close as she dared get. she moved off the right side ofthe road. She knew that the bridge would be the hardest part: it would funnelher into a relatively narrow space, with no option of moving away from thesoldiers. But the soldiers feared the magic of the Keep. and would probably notbe close to the bridge. They had been twenty or thirty feet from it when she hadseen them before, and in the darkness and snow. visibility wasn’t great.She was beginning to feel better about her chances of getting by unseen. Thesnow would provide enough cover.Kahlan froze in her tracks as a sword blade appeared in front of her face. Adarting glance revealed a sword to each side. Another man rested a lance on herback, at the base of her neck. So much for stealth.“Who goes there?” came a gruff voice from the man in front of her. Kahlan had tothink of a new plan, and fast. She quickly settled on a bit of truth, mixed inwith their fear of magic.“Captain, you nearly scared me to death. It’s me. the Mother Confessor.”“Show yourself.”Kahlan pushed back her hood. “I thought I’d be able to get past you unnoticed. Iguess D’Haran sentries are even better than I thought.”The men lowered their weapons. Kahlan was the most relieved to feel the lancelift from the back of her neck. That was the killing weapon in a challenge.“Mother Confessor! You gave us a fright, you did. What are you doing up hereagain tonight? And on foot, no less?”Kahlan sighed in resignation. “Get all your men together and I’ll explain.” Thecaptain tilted his head. “Over here. We have a shelter to get you out of thewind.”Kahlan let them lead her to the other side of the road. where stood a simplethree-sided structure meant to give some relief from wind and wet weather. Itwasn’t big enough for her and all six men. They insisted she take the driestspot. farthest inside.She was torn between satisfaction that even in a snowstorm no one got pastD’Haran guards, and wishing she had. It would have made it much easier. Now, shewas going to have to talk her way out of it.“All of you, listen carefully,” she began. “I don’t have a lot of time. I’m onan important mission. I need your confidence. All of you. You all know about theplague?”The men grunted and nodded that they did, shifting their weight uncomfortably.“Richard. Lord Rahl, is trying to find a way to stop it. We don’t know if thereis a way, but he won’t give up, you know that. He would do anything it takes tosave his people.”The men were nodding again. “What’s that got to do with-”“I’m in a hurry. Lord Rahl is sleeping right now. He’s exhausted from trying tofind a cure for the plague. A cure that involves magic.”The men straightened a bit. The captain rubbed his chin. “We know that Lord Rahlwon’t let us down. He cured me a few days back.”Kahlan looked to all the eyes watching her. “Well, what if Lord Rahl comes downwith the plague himself? Before he can find an answer? Then what? We’re alldead, that’s what.”The anxiety on their faces was clear. For D’Harans to lose a Lord Rahl was acalamitous event. It cast all their futures into doubt. “What can be done toprotect him?” the captain asked. “What can be done is up to you men, here,tonight.”“What can we do?”“Lord Rahl loves me. You men all know how he protects me. He has those Mord-Sithshadowing me all the time. He sends guards with me wherever I go. He won’t letdanger come within miles of me. He won’t let harm even get a view of me.“Well, I don’t want him harmed, either. What if he gets the plague? Then we alllose him.“I may have a way to help him stop the plague before it can touch us all- beforehe can get it, as surely he will.” They gasped. “What can we do to help?” thecaptain asked. “What I’m doing involves magic-very dangerous magic. If I’msuccessful, I may be able to protect Richard from the plague. Protect all of usfrom the plague. But, like I said, it’s dangerous.“I need to go away for a few days, with the aid of magic, to see if I might beable to help Lord Rahl stop the plague. You men know how he guards me. He wouldnever let me go. He would rather die than let me be exposed to danger. He can’tbe reasoned with when it comes to my being in danger.“That’s why I tricked the Mord-Sith and my other guards. No one knows where I’mgoing. If anyone finds out, then Richard will come after me, and be in the samedanger as me. What good will that do? If I’m killed, then he would be killed,too. If I’m successful, there’s no reason to expose him to the danger.“I intended for no one to find out where I went tonight, but you men are betterthan I gave you credit for. Now, it’s up to you. I’m risking my life to protectLord Rahl. If you want to protect him, too, then you must swear to secrecy. Evenif he looks you in the eye, you must tell him that you haven’t seen me, that noone came up here.”The men shuffled their feet, cleared their throats, and looked at one another.The captain’s fingers fretted with his sword hilt. “Mother Confessor, if LordRahl looks us in the eye and asks us, we can’t lie to him.”Kahlan leaned closer to the man. “Then you may as well slay him on the spot.That’s what you’ll be doing. Do you want to endanger your Lord Rahl’s life? Doyou want to be responsible for his dying?”“Of course not! We’d all lay down our lives for him!”“I’m offering to lay down my life, too. If he finds out what I’m doing, where Iwent this night, then he will come after me. He can be of no help and he may diebecause of it.”Kahlan pulled her arm out from under her cloak and passed a finger before eachman’s face. “You will be responsible for endangering Lord Rahl’s life. You willbe exposing him to harm’s view to no purpose. You may be killing him.”The captain looked into the eyes of each of his men. He straightened and rubbedhis face as he considered. At last he spoke. “What is it you wish us to do?Swear on our lives?”“No,” Kahlan said. “I want you to swear on Lord Rahl’s life.”At the captain’s lead, the men all went to one knee.“We give our oath on Lord Rahl’s life to tell no one that we saw you againtonight, and further to swear that no one went up to the Keep, except you andyour two Mord-Sith earlier.” He looked about at his men. “Swear it.”When they had all sworn, the men stood. The captain placed a fatherly hand onKahlan’s shoulder.“Mother Confessor, I don’t know anything about magic, that’s Lord Rahl’sbusiness, and I don’t know what you’re up to tonight, but we don’t want to loseyou, either. You’re good for Lord Rahl. Whatever you’re about to do, please becareful.”“Thank you, captain. I think you men are the most danger I’ll see tonight.Tomorrow is another matter.”“If you are killed, it ends our oath. If you die, we will have to tell Lord Rahlwhat we know. If that happens, we will be executed.”“No, captain. Lord Rahl wouldn’t do something like that. That’s why we have todo what we must to protect him. We all need him, lest we be ruled by theImperial Order. They have no respect for life-it is they who started thisplague. They started it among children.”Kahlan swallowed as she stared into the silver face of the sliph. “Yes, I’mready. What do you want me to do?”A lustrous metallic hand rose up from the pool and touched the top of the wall.“Come to me,” the voice said, echoing around the room. “You do not do. I do.”Kahlan climbed up onto the wall. “And you’re sure you can take me to AgadenReach?”“Yes. I have been there. You will be pleased.” Kahlan didn’t know about beingpleased. “How long will it take?” The sliph seemed to frown. Kahlan could seeherself reflected in the shiny surface of the sliph’s face.“From here to there. That long. I am long enough. I have been there.” Kahlansighed. The sliph didn’t seem to understand that she had been asleep for threethousand years, either. What was a day, more or less. to her?“You won’t tell Richard where you took me, will you? I don’t want him to know.”The silver face distorted into a sly smile. “None who know me wish others toknow. I never betray them. Be at ease: no one will know what we do together. Noone will know of your pleasure.”Kahlan’s face assumed a perplexed expression. The liquid silver arm came up andslipped around her. The warm, undulating grip held her tight.“Do not forget: you must breathe me,” the sliph said. “Do not be afraid. I willkeep you alive when you breathe me. When we reach the other place, you must thenbreathe me out and breathe in the air. You will be just as afraid to do that asyou will be to breathe me, but you must do it or you will die.”Kahlan nodded as she panted. She rocked from one foot to the other. “Iremember.” She couldn’t help fearing to be without air. “All right. I’m ready.”Without further word. the sliph’s arm lifted her gently from the wall andplunged with her down into the quicksilver froth. Kahlan’s lungs burned. Hereyes were squeezed shut. She had done it before, and knew she must, but she wasstill terrified to breathe in this liquid silver. Richard had been with her thelast time. Alone this time, panic snatched at her. She thought about Shotasending Nadine to marry Richard. Kahlan let the air go from her lungs. Shepulled a deep breath, inhaling the sliph’s silken essence.There was no heat, no cold. She opened her eyes and saw light and dark in asingle, spectral vision. She felt movement in the weightless void, at once fastand slow, rushing and drifting. Her lungs swelled with the sweet presence of thesliph. It felt as if she were taking the sliph into her soul. Time meantnothing. It was rapture."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38Through the warm swirl of color, Zedd could hear Ann calling his name. It was adistant plea, even though she stood only a short distance away. In the flux ofpower atop his wizard’s rock, it might as well have come from another world. Inmany ways, it did.Her voice came again, irritating, insistent, urgent. Zedd all but ignored her ashe lifted his arms into the rotating smoke of light. Shapes before him hinted attheir spirit presence. He was almost through.Abruptly, the wall of power began to collapse. The sleeves of his robes slippeddown his arms as Zedd threw his contorted hands higher, trying to coerce morepuissance into the field of magic, trying to stabilize it. He was madly haulinga bucket from the well, and finding it empty.Sparkles of color fizzled. The twisting eddy of light degenerated into a muddygloom of color. With gathering speed, it slumped, foundering impotently. Zeddwas dumbfounded.With a thump that shook the ground, the whole elaborately forged warp in theworld of existence extinguished.Zedd’s arms windmilled as Ann snatched the back of his collar and yanked himfrom atop his wizard’s rock. He tumbled back, knocking them both to the ground.Deprived of enlivening magic, the rock, too, collapsed. Zedd hadn’t done it; hiswizard’s rock had reverted to its inert state of its own accord. Now he trulywas baffled.“Bags, woman! What’s the meaning of this!”“Don’t you curse at me, you contrary old man. I don’t know why I bother tryingto save your skinny hide.”“Why did you interfere? I was almost through!”“I didn’t interfere,” she growled.“But if it wasn’t you”-Zedd shot a glance at the dark hills. “You mean... ?”“I suddenly lost the link with my Han. I was trying to warn you, not stop you.”“Oh,” Zedd said in a thin voice. “That’s very different.” He stretched out andsnatched up his wizard’s rock. “Why didn’t you say so?” He slipped the rock intoan inner pocket.Ann scanned the darkness. “Did you find out anything before you lost contact?”“I never made contact.”Her gaze shot back at him. “You never... what do you mean, you never madecontact? What were you doing all that time?”“Trying,” he said as he reached for a blanket. “Something was wrong. I couldn’treach through. Get your things. We’d better get out of here.”Ann scooped up a saddlebag and began stuffing their gear into it. “Zedd,” shesaid in a worried tone, “we were counting on this. Now that you have failed-”“I didn’t fail,” he snapped. “At least, it wasn’t my fault that it wasn’tworking.” She slapped his hands away when he pushed her toward her horse. “Whywouldn’t it work?”“The red moons.”She twisted and stared at him. “You think...”“It’s not something I do often, or lightly. I’ve only made contact with thespirit world a handful of times in the whole of my life. My father warned me,when he gave me the rock, that it must only be used in the most dire ofcircumstances. Such contact risks letting the wrong spirits through, and worse,tearing the veil. When I had trouble making contact in the past, it was becauseof a disharmony. The red moons were a warning of disharmony, of a sort.”“We’re running out of things to try.” She yanked her arm from his grip. “What’sgotten into you?”Zedd grunted. “What’s this you said about not being able to touch your Han?” Annstroked a hand along the flanks of her horse, letting it know she was close toits hindquarters. The horse pawed a front hoof as it whickered.“When you were up on your rock, I was casting sensing webs to make sure no onewas near. This is the wilds, after all, and you were making quite a show withall the light. All of a sudden, when I reached to touch my Han again, it waslike falling on my face.”Zedd flicked his hand, casting a simple web to flip over a fist-sized rock lyingat his feet. Nothing happened. It felt rather like trying to lean againstsomething, and finding out too late that it wasn’t there. Like falling on hisface.Zedd reached into an inner pocket and pulled out a pinch of concealing dust. Hecast it in the direction they had come. The breeze carried it away. It didn’tsparkle. “We’re in trouble,” he whispered.She huddled close to him. “You wouldn’t mind being more specific, would you?”“Leave the horses.” He took her arm again. “Come on.” This time she didn’tobject as he took her arm and led her at a trot. “Zedd, what is it?” shewhispered.“This is the wilds.” He stopped, lifted his nose, and sniffed the air. “My guesswould be Nangtong.” He pointed in the dim moonlight. “Down here, in this ravine.We must do our best to stay out of sight. We may have to split up and try toescape in separate directions.”Zedd held her arm, helping her as her feet slipped on the dewy grass and wetclay of the steep sides. “Who are the Nangtong?”Zedd reached the bottom first. He put his hands on her wide waist and helped herdown. Her legs were short, and she didn’t have the reach with them that he hadwith his. Without the aid of magic, her weight almost toppled him. With a hand,she caught a tangled mat of bur bush roots to steady herself.“The Nangtong,” Zedd whispered, “are a people of the wilds. They have magic oftheir own. They can’t exactly use their magic for anything, the way we use it,but it leaches the strength right out of other magic. Like rain on a campfire.“That’s the trouble with the wilds. There are any number of people in the wildswho cause odd things to go wrong with your attempts to use magic. There arecreatures and places here, too, that are trouble in ways you don’t expect. It’sbest to stay clear of the wilds.“That’s why I was so perturbed when after Nathan said we had to go to the JocopoTreasure, Verna told us that the Jocopo used to live somewhere in the wilds.Nathan might as well have told us to reach into a roaring fire and pull out ahot coal. There are hazards everywhere in the wilds; the Nangtong are only oneof them.”“So what makes you think it’s these Nangtong people who are causing the troublewith our magic?”“With most peoples of the wilds who have this effect, it steals the strength outof our magic, but my concealing dust would still have worked. It doesn’t. TheNangtong are the only ones I know of who can do that.”Ann held her arms out to the sides to help balance herself and keep her footingas she crossed behind him on a fallen log. The moon slipped behind the clouds.The return of darkness pleased Zedd, because it helped hide them. but it made itnearly impossible to see where to step. They would be no less dead if they felland broke their necks than if they were run through with a poison arrow or spearpoint.“Maybe we could show them that we’re friendly,” Ann whispered from behind him.She nabbed his robes so she could follow in the dark as he hurried along theflat beside the stream. “You’re always boasting and telling me to let you do thetalking, as if you have a magic, honeyed tongue, to hear you tell it. Why don’tyou simply tell these Nangtong that we’re looking for the Jocopo, and we wouldappreciate their help? Many people who would seem to be trouble turn out to bereasonable if you only talk with them.”He turned his head back so he could keep his voice low and she would still beable to hear him. “I agree, but I don’t speak their language, so I can’t winthem over.”“If these people are so dangerous, and you know it. then why would you be sofoolish as to take us right into them?”“I didn’t. I skirted their lands by a wide margin.”“So you say. It would appear you’ve gotten us lost.”“No, the Nangtong are seminomadic. They have no exact, permanent home, but theystay within their own homelands. I stayed out of their homelands. It’s probablya spirit raiding party.”“A what?”Zedd halted and crouched low, studying the lay of the land. He couldn’t seeanyone in the faint light, and he could only vaguely detect the foreign smell ofsweat. It could be that it had been carried on the breeze for miles.“A spirit raiding party,” he said as he put his mouth close to her ear. “It’s along story, but the ending is that they offer sacrifices to the spirit world.“It is their belief that the newly departed spirit will carry the Nangtongs’respects and requests to their departed ancestors, and in return the spiritswill look kindly upon them. The hunting parties hunt things to sacrifice.”“People?”“Sometimes. If they can get away with it. They aren’t very brave when theyencounter strong opposition-they would rather run than have a fight-but theywill gladly pick off the weak or defenseless.”“In the name of Creation, what kind of place is this Midlands, letting peopleget away with such things? I thought you people were more civilized than that. Ithought you had this alliance through which everyone in the Midlands cooperatedand saw to the common good.”“The Confessors come here, to try to insure the Nangtong don’t murder people,but it’s a remote place. The Nangtong are always servile when a Confessor comes;her magic is one of the few not altered by the Nangtongs’ power. It could bethat because a Confessor’s power has an element of the Subtractive to it, itisn’t altered.”“Why would you fools leave these people to their own devices, if you know whatthey are capable of?”Zedd scowled at her in the darkness. “Part of the reason for the Midlandsalliance was to protect those with magic who would be slaughtered by strongerlands.”“They don’t have magic. You said they couldn’t do anything with magic.”“Since they can nullify magic, make it impotent, then that means that they havemagic. Those without magic could not do such a thing. It’s part of the way thesepeople defend themselves. It’s their teeth, so to speak, used to defendthemselves against those with powerful magic who would subjugate or destroythem.“We leave alone people and creatures with magic. They have as much right toexist as we, but we try to insure that they don’t murder innocent people. We maynot like all forms of magic, but we don’t believe in exterminating the Creator’sbeings to make a world in the image of those with the most power.”She remained silent, so he went on. “There are creatures that can be dangerous,such as a gar, but we don’t go out and kill all the gars. Instead, we leave thembe, let them have their own lives, the way the Creator intended. It is not up tous to judge the wisdom of Creation.“The Nangtong are diffident when challenged by strength, but deadly when theythink they have the upper hand. They’re a kind of scavenger-like vultures, orwolves, or bears. It wouldn’t be right to eliminate those creatures. They have apart to play in the world.”She put her face close so she could express her displeasure without yelling.“And what part do the Nangtong play?”“Ann, I am not the Creator, nor do I have conversations with Him to discuss Hischoices in creating life and magic. But I am respectful enough to allow that Hemay have a reason, and it isn’t my place to say He is wrong. That would be nakedarrogance.“In the Midlands, we allow all forms of Creation to exist, and if it’sdangerous, we simply keep away from it. You, of all people, with your dogmaticteachings of your version of the Creator, should be able to sympathize with thisview.”Ann’s words, whispered though they were, became heated. “Our duty is to teachheathens such as this to respect the Creator’s other beings.”“Tell that to the wolf, or the bear.” Her growl could have been either.“Sorceresses and wizards are meant to be custodians of magic, to protect it,just as a parent protects a child,” Zedd said. “It is not up to us to decidewhich are good enough to have a right to exist, which is worthy of life.“Down that path lies Jagang’s view of all magic. He thinks we are dangerous, andthat we should be eliminated for the good of all. You seem to be siding with theemperor.”“If a bee stings you, do you not swat it?”“I didn’t say we shouldn’t defend ourselves.”“Then why haven’t you defended yourselves and eliminated such threats? In thewar with Darken Rahl’s father, Panis, your own people called you the wind ofdeath. You knew how to eliminate a threat then.”“I did what I had to do to protect innocent people who would have beenslaughtered-who were being slaughtered. I will do the same against Jagang if Imust. The Nangtong haven’t warranted annihilation: they don’t try to rule othersthrough murder, torture, and enslavement. Their beliefs result in harm only ifwe are careless enough to intrude.”“They’re dangerous. You should never have let the threat continue.” He shook afinger at her. “And why haven’t you killed Nathan, to eliminate the threat herepresents?”“Would you equate Nathan with those who sacrifice people for heathen beliefs?And I can tell you that when I get my hands on Nathan again, I will set him onthe right path!”“Good. But in the meanwhile, this is a poor time to debate theology.” Zeddsmoothed back his wavy hair. “Unless you wish to begin teaching the Nangtongyour beliefs, I would suggest we follow mine, and remove ourselves from theirhunting grounds.”Ann sighed. “Perhaps you have a point or two. Your intentions, at least, werebenevolent.”With a shooing motion, she signalled for him to get going. Zedd followed thetwisting gorge, trying to stay out of the sluggish ribbon of water runningthrough it.The ravine led southwest. He knew that would take them away from the Nangtonghomeland. He hoped it would also conceal them while they fled. The Nangtong hadspears and arrows.When the moon came out between a break in the clouds, Zedd put out a hand tostop Ann, and squatted down to take a quick appraisal of the landscape whilethere was light enough for a moment. He saw little but the eight- toten-foot-high walls of the banks and, beyond, the nearly barren hills. Therewere scattered copses on distant hills.In the low valley ahead, the stream ran into a thicket of woods. Zedd turnedback to tell Ann that their best bet might be to hide in the brush and woods.The Nangtong might be leery of a trap, and stay out of such a place.The moon was still out. He saw behind them their perfect pair of tracks throughthe mud. He had forgotten that he couldn’t hide their trail. He pointed, so shewould see them, too. She gestured with a thumb, indicating that they should getout of the muddy gully.Twin, reed-thin screams in the distance cut through the stillness. “The horses,”he whispered.The screams silenced abruptly. Their throats had been cut. “Bags! Those weregood horses. Do you have anything with which to defend yourself?”Ann flicked her wrist and brought forth a dacra. “I have this. Its magic won’twork, but I can still stab them. What do you have?” Zedd smiled fatalistically.“My honeyed tongue.”“Maybe we should split up, before your weapon gets me killed.” Zedd shrugged. “Iwouldn’t hold it against you if you wish to strike out alone. We have importantbusiness. Maybe it would be better if we split up to give a better chance of atleast one of us making it.”She smiled. “You just want me to miss out on all the fun. We’ll get away. We’rea goodly distance from the horses. Let’s stay together.” Zedd squeezed hershoulder. “Maybe they only sacrifice virgins.”“But I don’t want to die alone.”Zedd chuckled softly as he moved on, searching for a place ahead where he couldtake them up and out of the ravine. He finally found a cut through the bank.Roots of gnarled bushes hung down like hair, providing handholds. The moon slidbehind a thick cloud. In the inky darkness, they climbed slowly, blindly,feeling their way with their hands.Zedd could hear a few bugs buzzing about and, in the distance, the mournful callof a coyote. Other than that, the night was still and silent. Hopefully, theNangtong would be busy picking through Zedd and Ann’s things back with thehorses.Zedd reached the top and turned to help pull Ann up. “Stay on your hands andknees. We’ll crawl or at least crouch as we go.”Ann whispered her agreement. She made her way atop the bank with him. Theystruck out, away from the gully. The bright moon came out from behind the cloud.In a semicircle right in front of them, blocking their way, stood the Nangtong.There were perhaps twenty of them. Zedd reasoned that there were more aboutnearby; Nangtong hunting parties were larger.They were not tall, and were nearly naked, wearing only a thong and a pouch ofsorts that held their manhood. Necklaces made of human finger bones hung aroundtheir necks. Heads were shaved bald. They all had sinewy arms and legs andpronounced bellies.The Nangtong had all smeared white ash over their entire body. The area aroundtheir eyes was painted black, giving them the appearance of living skulls.Zedd and Ann peered up at spears, their barbed, steel points glinting in themoonlight. One of the men chattered an order. Zedd didn’t understand the words,but he had a good idea of what it meant.“Don’t use the dacra,” he whispered over to Ann. “There’s too many. They’ll killus on the spot. Our only chance is if we can stay alive and think of something.”He saw her slip the weapon back up her sleeve.Zedd grinned up at the wall of grim faces. “Would any of you men happen to knowwhere we could find the Jocopo?”A spear jabbed at him, then signalled them to stand. He and Ann reluctantlycomplied. The men, not up to Zedd’s shoulders, but about as tall as Ann, crowdedin around them, suddenly jabbering all at once. Men pushed and poked at them.Their arms were pulled back and their wrists tightly bound. “Remind me again,”Ann said to him, “about the wisdom of leaving these heathens to theirunenlightened practices.”“Well, I heard from a Confessor, once, that they are quite good cooks. Perhapswe will sample something new and delightful.”Ann stumbled but caught herself as she was pushed on ahead. “I’m too old,” shemuttered to the sky, “to be mucking about with a crazy man.”An hour of brisk marching brought them to the Nangtong village. Broad, roundtents, perhaps thirty of them, made up the mobile community. The low tentshunkered close to the ground, presenting the least possible purchase to thewind. Enclosures made of tall stick fences held a variety of livestock.Chattering people, wrapped head to toe in unadorned cloth to hide theiridentities from the sacrificial offerings about to take their prayers to thespirit world, turned out to watch Zedd and Ann being prodded at spearpointthrough the village. Their captors, covered in the white ash and with their eyespainted black, were hunters in the guise of the dead. so there would be nodanger of their being recognized as one of the still living.Zedd was jerked to a halt before a pen while men undid the rope tie at the gate.The gate swung open in the moonlight. It seemed that the whole Nangtong villagehad followed behind. They hooted and hollered as the two prisoners were hustledthrough the gate, apparently wanting to give messages to the two spirits aboutto go speak on the Nangtongs’ behalf to their ancestors.Zedd and Ann. their wrists still bound behind their backs, both fell when theywere forcefully shoved into the pen. It was a muddy landing. Snorting shapesloped away. The pen was occupied by pigs. The way they had churned the groundinto a quagmire, the village must have occupied this place for at least the pastfew months. It smelled like what it was.The spirit hunting party, nearly fifty, as Zedd had guessed, split up. Some wentback to tents, surrounded by gleeful children and stoic women. Others of thehunters encircled the pen to stand guard. Most of the people who stood aroundwatching were calling out to the prisoners, giving their messages for the spiritworld.“Why are you doing this?” Zedd called to their guards. He nodded his head andinclined it toward Ann. “Why?” He shrugged.One of the guards seemed to understand. He made a cutting gesture across histhroat, and then indicated the imaginary blood running from the pretend wound.With his spear, he pointed at the moon. “Blood moon?” Ann asked under herbreath.“Red moon,” Zedd whispered in realization. “The last I’d heard, the Confessorshad secured a pledge from the Nangtong that they would no longer sacrificepeople. I was never sure if they held to their promise. Just the same, peoplestayed away.“The red moon must have frightened them, made them think the spirit world wasangry. That’s probably why we’re to be sacrificed: to placate the angryspirits.”Ann squirmed uncomfortably in the mud beside him. She gave Zedd a murderouslook.“I only pray that Nathan’s situation is worse than ours.”“What was it you said,” Zedd asked absently, “about mucking about with a crazyman?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39What do you think?” Clarissa asked.She turned a little one way and then the other, trying to mimic a natural stancewhile feeling anything but natural. She wasn’t sure what to do with her hands,so she clasped them behind her back.Nathan was lounging in a chair as splendid as any she had ever seen, its paddedseat and back covered with striped tan and gold fabric. His left leg was drapedcasually over one of the chair’s ornately carved arms as he slouched with hiselbow propped on the chair’s other arm. His chin rested thoughtfully in the heelof his hand. His sword’s finely crafted silver scabbard hung down, so that itspoint touched the floor in front of the chair.Nathan smiled that smile he had that said he was sincerely pleased. “My dear, Ithink you look lovely.”“Really? You’re not just saying that? You really like it? I don’t look...silly?” He chuckled. “No, most definitely not silly. Ravishing, perhaps.”“But I feel...I don’t know... presumptuous. I’ve never even seen clothes sofine, much less tried them on.” He shrugged. “Then it’s about time you did.”The dressmaker, a thin, neat man with only a wisp of long grey hair covering thebald expanse atop his head, returned through the curtained doorway. He grippedeach end of the tape measure draped around his neck, seesawing it nervously backand forth.“Madam finds the dress acceptable?”Clarissa remembered how Nathan had instructed her to conduct herself. Shesmoothed the rich blue satin at her hips. “It’s not the best fit-”The dressmaker’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. “Well, madam, had I knownyou were to grace my shop, or if you had sent the measurements on ahead, I wouldcertainly have made the appropriate alterations.” He glanced to Nathan. Histongue darted out again. “Be assured, madam, I can make any necessary minoradjustments.”The man bowed to Nathan. “My lord, what think you? I mean, if it were altered tosuit you.”Nathan folded his arms as he studied Clarissa the way a sculptor studied a workin progress. He squinted as he considered, rolled his tongue around inside hischeek, and made little sounds in his throat as if unable to decide. Thedressmaker twiddled with the end of his tape measure.“Like madam says, it fits a little sloppily at the waist.”“Sir, have no fear.” The dressmaker whisked around behind her, tugging sharplyat the material. “See here? I have but to take a dart or two. Madam is gracedwith an exquisite figure. I rarely have ladies so fine of form. but I can havethe dress altered in a matter of hours. I would be most honored to do the workthis very night and have it delivered to you at-at-where would you be staying,my lord?”Nathan flicked a hand. “I’ve yet to seek accommodations. Any place you couldrecommend with confidence?”The dressmaker bowed again. “The Briar House would be the finest inn inTanimura, my lord. If you wish. I’d gladly have my assistant run over there andmake arrangements for you and... madam.”Nathan straightened himself in the chair and fingered a gold coin from hispocket. He flipped the coin to the man, followed by a second, and then a third.“Yes, thank you, that would be very kind of you.” Nathan frowned in thought, andthen tossed the man another gold coin. “It’s late, but I’m sure you couldconvince them to keep their dining room open until we arrive. We’ve been on theroad all day and could use a decent meal.” He shook a finger at the man. “Theirbest rooms, mind you. I’ll not have them sticking me in some cramped littlesty.”“I assure you, my lord, the Briar House has no room that could remotely beconsidered a sty, even by one such as yourself. And how long shall I have myassistant tell them you will be staying at their establishment?”Nathan stroked the ruffles on the front of his shirt. “Until Emperor Jagangrequires me, of course.”“Of course, sir. And would you like the dress, my lord?” Nathan hooked a thumbin the little pocket in the front of his green vest. letting his hand hang. “Itwill have to do for common wear. What do you have that would be more elegant?”The dressmaker smiled and bowed. “Let me bring some others for your approval,and madam can try on the ones you fancy.”“Yes,” Nathan said. “Yes, that would be best. I’m a man of wide experience andrefined taste. I’m used to better. Bring something to dazzle me.”“Of course, my lord.” He bowed twice and rushed off. Clarissa grinned in wonderafter the man had gone. “Nathan! This is the finest dress I’ve ever seen, andyou wish him to show us something better?”Nathan lifted an eyebrow. “Nothing is too good for a concubine to the emperor,the woman carrying the emperor’s child.”Her heart fluttered to hear the prophet say that again. Sometimes, when shelooked into his azure eyes, she almost saw something there, almost had thevaguest impression, if only for an instant, that Nathan was quite beyond mad.But when that serene smile of his came to his face, she melted in hisconfidence.He was more daring than any man she had ever met. His daring had saved her fromthe brutes back in Renwold. Since then, his daring had saved them incircumstances that to her seemed worse than hopeless. There had to be a grain ofmadness in daring that far beyond bold. “Nathan, I trust in you, and will dowhatever you ask of me. but please, would you tell me if this is just a story topass us here, or do you really see such a horrid thing for my future?”Nathan brought his leg down and rose to his full, towering height. He lifted oneof her hands, bringing it to his heart as if it were the most fragile ofblossoms. His long silver hair slipped over the front of his shoulder as hestood ever so close to her and looked into her eyes. “Clarissa, it is just atale to accomplish my goals. It in no way reflects anything I see about thefuture. I won’t lie to you and tell you that there are not dangers ahead, but beat ease for now, and enjoy this much of it. We must wait for a while, and Iwanted you to have an enjoyable time of it.“You are pledged to do what you must. I trust in your word. In the meantime, Iwanted nothing more than to do you a simple kindness.”“But shouldn’t we hide where people won’t know of us? Somewhere alone and out ofsight?”“That is the way criminals or unskilled runaways would hide. That’s why they getcaught. It makes people suspicious. If anyone is hunting them, they look in allthe dark holes, never thinking to look in the light. As long as we must hide,the best place to hide is in the open.“The story is too preposterous for people not to believe in its truth. No onewould ever consider that anybody would have the audacity to invent such a tale,and so no one will question it.“Besides, we aren’t really hiding; no one is hunting us. We simply don’t want tomake people suspicious. Hiding would make them so.” She shook her head. “Nathan,you are a marvel.”Clarissa eyed the bodice of the beautiful dress, what she could see of it,anyway, beyond the exposed flesh of her breasts, which were pushed up so highthat they nearly tumbled out. She tugged at the bone stays lying against herribs under her bosom. She had never worn such strange and uncomfortableundergarments. She couldn’t imagine why they were all required. She smoothed thesilken skirt of the dress.“Does it look good on me? I mean, honestly. Tell me the truth, Nathan. I’m justa plain woman. Doesn’t it look silly on a plain woman?” Nathan’s eyebrow arched.“Plain? Is that what you think?”“Of course. I’m no fool. I know I’m not-”Nathan waved her to silence. “Maybe you should have a look for yourself.” Hepulled the sheet off the standing mirror. This was a showing room for gentlemen.When he had instructed her on matters of decorum and propriety, he had told herthat the mirrors in such a place were rarely used, and she wasn’t to look in oneunless asked. It was the look in the gentleman’s eyes that mattered in such anexclusive shop, not the look in the mirror.Nathan gently took her elbow and walked her before the mirror. “Forget what yousee in your mind, and look at what others see when they look at you.”Clarissa’s fingers fidgeted over the bunched frills at her waist. She nodded atNathan, but feared to look in the mirror and be disappointed by what she alwayssaw when she looked at herself. He gestured again. Wincing just a little out ofembarrassment, she turned to gaze at her reflection. Her jaw dropped at what shesaw.Clarissa didn’t recognize herself. She was not this young-looking. A woman- nota young, fickle woman, but a woman in the full glory of her maturity, a woman ofelegance and bearing-stared back.“Nathan,” she whispered, “my hair... my hair wasn’t this long. How did the womanwho worked on it this afternoon make it longer?”“Ah, well, she didn’t. I used some magic to do it. I thought it would lookbetter if it was just a bit longer. You don’t object, I pray?”“No,” she whispered. “It’s lovely.” Her soft brown hair was done in ringlets,with delicate violet ribbons tied into them. She moved her head. The ringletssprang up and down. and swayed side to side. Clarissa had once seen a woman ofstanding come to Renwold, and she had hair like this. It was the most beautifulhair Clarissa had ever seen. Now, Clarissa’s hair looked just like that.She stared at herself in the mirror. Her shape was so... shapely. All thosehard, tight things under her dress had somehow rearranged her figure. Clarissa’sface blushed to see her bosom straining up the way it did. half exposed for allto see.She had always known, of course, that women like Manda Perlin weren’t reallyshaped as they appeared. She knew that when they had their clothes off. theirshapes were not a great deal different from any other woman’s, but Clarissa hadnever known just how much of it was due to the dresses those attractive womenwore.In the mirror, in this dress, with her hair done in such a fashion and with thepaint on her face, she looked the equal of any of them. Perhaps older, but thatage seemed only to add bearing to what she saw; not a spent, unattractivequality, as she had always thought. And then she saw the ring in her lip. It wasgold, not silver.“Nathan,” she whispered. “What happened to the ring?”“Oh, that. Well, it wouldn’t do to have you supposedly a concubine to theemperor himself and carrying his little emperor heir, and have a silver ringthrough your lip. Everyone knows that the emperor only brings those with goldrings to his bed.“Besides, you were wrongly marked with a silver ring. It should have been goldfrom the beginning. Those men were just plain blind.” He gestured in a grandfashion. “I, of course, am a man of vision.” He held his hand out toward themirror. “Look for yourself. That woman is too beautiful to wear anything but agold ring.”In the mirror, the woman staring back was getting tears in her eyes. Clarissawiped a finger across her lower lids. She feared to ruin the paint the woman hadput on her face when her hair was being curled.“Nathan, I don’t know what to say. You have done magic. You have made a plainwoman into something...”“Beautiful,” he finished. “But why?”His face screwed up with an odd expression. “Are you daft? I couldn’t very wellhave you looking plain,” He swept a hand down, indicating himself. “No one wouldbelieve a man as dashing as myself would be seen with a woman any lessstunning.”Clarissa grinned. He didn’t look so old to her as he had seemed when she hadfirst met him. He really did look dashing. Dashing, and distinguished. “Thankyou, Nathan, for having faith in me, in more ways than one.”“It’s not faith: it’s vision for what others are too blind to see. Now they do.”She glanced to the curtain where the dressmaker had disappeared. “But this isall so very expensive. This dress alone would cost me near to a year’s wages.And all the other things: the lodging; the coaches; the hats; the shoes; thewomen who did my hair and face. It all costs so much. You are spending moneylike a prince on holiday. How can you possibly afford it?”The sly smile oozed back onto his face. “I’m good at... making money. I couldnever spend all I can make. Don’t be concerned about it: it means little to me.”“Oh.” She glanced back at the mirror. “Of course.”He cleared his throat. “What I mean is that you are more important than pettymatters of gold. People are more important than such considerations. If it wasmy last copper, I would have spent it with no less enthusiasm, or greaterworry.”When the dressmaker finally returned with a selection of stunning dresses,Nathan chose a number for her to try on. Clarissa went into the dressing roomwith each, and with the aid of the dressmaker’s woman, tried on each. Clarissadidn’t think she would have been able to lace, tie, and button any of them byherself.Nathan smiled at each dress she came out in, and told the dressmaker he wouldbuy it. By the end of the next hour, Nathan had selected a half dozen dresses,and had passed a handful of gold to the dressmaker. In all her life, she hadnever imagined a place of such wealth that dresses were already made. It wasanother measure of how much her life had changed with Nathan; only the veryrich, or royalty, would buy dresses this way.“I will make the necessary alterations, my lord, and have the dresses deliveredto the Briar House.” He darted a look at Clarissa. “Perhaps my lord would wishme to leave several of them loose-fitting, to accommodate madam, when she growswith our emperor’s child?”Nathan waved a hand dismissively. “No, no. I enjoy having her look her best. Iwill have a seamstress let them out when necessary, or simply purchase others tofit her then.”It suddenly embarrassed Clarissa to realize that this dressmaker thought thatshe was concubine not only to the emperor but to Nathan. The ring through herlip, gold though it was, still meant she was nothing more than a slave. A slavewould mean little to the emperor, with child or not, gold ring or not.Nathan boldly told people that he was Emperor Jagang’s plenipotentiary, whichkept them furiously bowing and scraping. Clarissa was merely property, sharedwith the emperor’s trusted agent.The dressmaker’s sidelong glance finally struck home. She was a whore in hiseyes. Maybe a whore in a fine dress, and maybe not a whore by choice, but awhore nonetheless. A whore who was enjoying herself, being dressed in fineclothes and kept by an important man at the finest inn in the city.The fact that Nathan didn’t think the same thing was all that kept her fromrunning from the dress shop in humiliation.Clarissa reproached herself. This was the pretense Nathan had crafted for them,to keep them safe. It kept the soldiers they encountered at every turn fromhauling her away to a tent. Deprecating glances were a small thing indeed forher to bear in return for all that Nathan had done for her, and for the respecthe always showed her. It was what Nathan thought that mattered.Besides, she was used to disapproving looks-looks of sympathy at best, scorn atworst. People had never looked upon her with favor. Let these people think whatthey would. She knew she was doing something worthwhile, for a man of worth.Clarissa lifted her chin as she strutted to the door.The dressmaker bowed again as they stepped out into the dark street to thewaiting carriage. “Thank you. Lord Rahl. Thank you for allowing me to serve theemperor in my small way. The dresses will be delivered before morning, you havemy word.”Nathan waved an offhanded dismissal to the man.In the dim dining room of the elegant Briar House, Clarissa sat across a smalltable from Nathan. She now noticed the surreptitious glances she got from thestaff.She sat up straighter and put her shoulders back, defying them to have a goodlook at her bosom. She reasoned that in the murky candlelight, and under all theface paint, they wouldn’t be able to see her face reddening.The wine warmed her, and the roasted duck finally sated her gnawing hunger.People kept bringing food-fowl and pork and beef. along with gravies and saucesand a variety of side dishes. She nibbled at a few, not wanting to appear aglutton, and afterward she was satisfied.Nathan ate with zeal, but didn’t overeat. He enjoyed the different dishes,wanting to try them all. The staff hovered around him, slicing meat. pouringsauces, and moving plates and platters around as if he were helpless. Heencouraged them, asking for things, sending others away, and in general madehimself appear an important man in their midst.She guessed that he was. He was the emperor’s plenipotentiary: a man not to becrossed. No one wanted Lord Rahl to be anything but most pleased. If hispleasure required seeing to Clarissa’s desires, they did that, too.Clarissa was relieved when they were finally shown to their rooms, and Nathanhad at last closed the door. She sagged, at last unburdened of theresponsibility of acting a fine lady, or a fine whore; she wasn’t exactly surehow to play the part. She did know that she was glad to be away from the eyesthat played over her.Nathan strode around the two rooms, inspecting the painted walls with goldmolding applied to form huge, sweeping panels with reverse-curved corners. Richcarpets in deep colors covered nearly every inch of floor. Everywhere there werecouches and chairs. One room had several tables, one for taking meals there,another, with a slant top, for writing. The writing table held neatly arrangedsheets of paper, silver pens, and gold-topped ink bottles with various colors ofink.In the other room was the bed. Clarissa had never seen a bed like it. Fourelaborately turned posts held up a canopy of lace and rich red fabric with golddesigns splashed boldly over it. The bed cover matched. It was a huge bed. Shehad trouble imagining why such an expanse of bed was needed.“Well,” Nathan said as he strolled back into the room with the bed, “I guess itwill have to do.”Clarissa giggled. “Nathan, a king would be delighted to sleep in such a room.”Nathan’s expression contorted in a casual manner. “Perhaps, but I am more than aking. I am a prophet.”Her smile faded as her mood turned earnest. “Yes, you really are more than aking.”Nathan went around the room blowing out most of the dozen lamps. He left the onebeside the bed, and the one on the dressing stand.He half-turned, and gestured to the other room. “I’ll sleep on a couch in there.You may have the bed.”“I’ll take the couch. I wouldn’t be comfortable in such a bed. I’m a simplewoman, not accustomed to such grand things. You are. You should have the bed.”Nathan cupped her cheek. “Get used to them. Take the bed. It would beuncomfortable for me, knowing such a lovely lady was sleeping on a couch. I’m aman of the world, and such things don’t faze me.” He bowed grandly from thedoorway. “Sleep well, my dear.” He paused with the door half closed. “Clarissa.I apologize for the looks you had to endure, and for what people might havethought of you, because of my story.” He truly was a gentleman.“No apology is necessary. It was rather fun pretending, as if I were in a playon a stage.”He laughed with that sparkle in his blue eyes as he flung his cape aroundhimself. “It was fun, wasn’t it, having those people think we were other than wewere?”“Thank you for everything, Nathan. You made me feel pretty, today.”“You are pretty.” She smiled. “That was just the clothes.”“Beauty comes from within.” He winked. “Sleep well, Clarissa. I’ve left aprotective shield on the door so no one can enter. Be at ease here; you will besafe.” He closed the door gently.Feeling a warm glow from the wine, Clarissa ambled about the room, inspectingall the fine things. She ran her fingers over the inlaid silver on the smalltables beside the bed. She touched the cut glass on the lamps. She ran her handover the finely woven bed covers when she turned them down.Standing in front of the dressing table, she looked at herself in the mirror asshe unlaced the bodice of her dress. She almost hated to take off the dress andbe just herself again, although she wouldn’t be unhappy about being free of thebone stays that confined her.With the laces loose, she was at last able to take a full breath. She slippedthe top of the dress off her shoulders. The things still pressing fromunderneath held the dress up over her bosom. She sat on the edge of the bed asshe tried to reach the buttons up the back. Some of them were too high. Saggingin frustration, she settled on removing her new shoes, made of supple, nappedleather. She rolled off her stockings and wiggled her toes, glad to have themfree.Clarissa thought about home. She remembered her cozy bed, little as it was. Shemissed home, not because she was so happy there, but simply because it was home,and all she knew. As fancy as this place was, it felt cold to her. Cold andfrightening. She was someplace she didn’t know, and she could never go homeagain.Suddenly Clarissa was very lonely. With Nathan, she felt the comfort of hisconfidence. He always knew where he was going, what to do, and what to say. Henever seemed to have any doubts. Clarissa was full of them, now that she wasalone in the bedroom.It was odd, but she missed Nathan more than home, and he was right in the nextroom. Nathan was almost her home, now.The carpet felt good under her bare feet as she went to the door. Gently, sherapped against the white panel in the center of the gold molding. She waited amoment, and then knocked again. “Nathan?” she called softly.She knocked and called his name once more. When still no answer came, shecracked the door open and peeked in. Only a single candle cut the still gloom.Nathan was in one of his trances again. He was sitting in a chair, staringblankly at nothing. Clarissa stood at the door for a time, watching his steadybreathing.She had been frightened the first time she found him stiff and unblinking, buthe had assured her that it was something he had done nearly his whole life. Hehadn’t gotten angry, that first time, when she shook him, thinking there wassomething wrong.Nathan never got angry with her. He always treated her with respect andkindness-two things she had always longed for, but had never gotten from her ownpeople, and here was a stranger who gave them without effort.Clarissa called his name again. Nathan blinked and looked up at her. “Iseverything all right?” he asked. “Yes. I hope I’m not disturbing you in yourreflection?” Nathan waved away her concern. “No. no.”“Well, I was wondering, could you help me... undo my dress? I can’t reach thebuttons in the back and I seem to be stuck in it. I didn’t want to lie down init and ruin it.”Nathan followed her back into the bedroom. She had blown out the lamp on thedressing table so that she wouldn’t be embarrassed. Only the one beside the bedallowed him to see what he was doing.With both hands, Clarissa held her hair up out of the way as his strong fingersworked their way down the buttons. It felt good to have him near. “Nathan?” shewhispered when he had reached the last of them at her waist. He made aquestioning sound in response. She feared he would ask what the thumping soundwas. and she would have to tell him that it was her heart. Clarissa turned,having to hold the dress over her breasts, now that it was undone. “Nathan,” shesaid, as she gathered her courage and looked up into his beautiful eyes,“Nathan, I’m lonely.”His brow drew together as he gently laid one of his big hands on her bareshoulder. “No need, my dear. I’m right in the next room.”“I know. But I mean that I’m lonely in a bigger way than that. I mean. I’mlonely for the way you... I don’t know how to say it. When I’m alone, I startthinking about what I will have to do to help those people you talked about, andall kinds of fearful things come into my head, and before I know it, I’msweating in a terror.”“It’s often more worrisome to ponder something than it is to actually do it.Just don’t think about it. Try to enjoy the big bed, and the fine room. if youcan. Who knows, one day we may have to sleep in a ditch.”She nodded. She had to look away from his eyes. lest she lose her courage.“Nathan, I know I’m a plain woman, but you make me feel special. No man evermade me feel pretty, feel... desirable.”“Well, as I said before-”She reached up and put her fingers to his lips to silence him. “Nathan. Ireally...” She looked up into his wonderful eyes. She swallowed and changed whatshe was going to say. “Nathan, I’m afraid you are just too dashing a man for meto resist. Will you come spend the night in this big bed with me?” He smiledwith one side of his mouth as she took her fingers away. “Dashing?” She nodded.“Very.” She could feel the curls springing. He rested his arms around her waist.It made her heart beat even faster. “Clarissa, you owe me nothing. I saved youfrom what was happening in Renwold, but you in return have promised to help me.You owe me nothing beyond that.”“I know. It’s not-” She wasn’t making herself clear, she knew.She stretched up on her tiptoes, her arms circling his neck, and pressed herlips to his. His arms drew her tight. She abandoned herself in those arms. andto those lips.He pulled back. “Clarissa, I’m old. You’re a young woman. You don’t want someonewho’s as old as I.” How long had she hurt because she thought she was too old tohave someone?How often had she felt forlorn because she was too old? And now this man, thiswonderful, vibrant, handsome man, was telling her she was too young.“Nathan, what I want is to be thrown on the bed, to have this fancy, expensivedress pulled off me, and for you to have your way with me until I hear thespirits sing.”In the silence, Nathan stared at her. At last he reached down, put an arm behindher legs, and swept her off her feet. He carried her to the bed, but instead ofthrowing her onto it, as she had suggested, he set her down gently.His weight sank into the bed as he reclined beside her. His fingers stroked herforehead. They looked into each other’s eyes. Tenderly, he kissed her.Since her dress was all untied and unbuttoned, it easily slipped down to herwaist. She ran her fingers through his long silver hair as she watched himlovingly kiss her breasts. His lips were warm against her. For some reason, shefound that surprising, and marvellous. A soft moan escaped her throat at thefeeling of her nipples being kissed in such a manly, passionate fashion.Nathan may have lived longer than she, but he was not an old man in her eyes. Hewas dashing, daring, and thoughtful, and he made her feel beautiful. She foundherself panting at the sight of him without his clothes.No man had ever touched her with such tender purpose, and the sureness of thattouch further heated her passion.His kisses trailed down the front of her, each making her gasp to catch herbreath in sweet, startled desire.When he at last took his place atop her, she totally and unashamedly succumbedto her need. She felt cradled not only in the canopy bed but in his ardentembrace. At long last, as her whole body stiffened with her cry of release, shecould hear the spirits sing."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40Like a hawk in a dive, Kahlan silently shot ahead, and at the same time, like aneagle in an updraft, she serenely hovered in place. Light and dark, heat andcold, time and distance, had no meaning, yet they meant everything. It was amarvellous confusion of sensations, heightened by the sweet presence of thesliph each time Kahlan drew the living quicksilver into her lungs, into hersoul. It was rapture.With an abrupt explosion of perception, it ended.Light erupted in Kahlan’s vision. Sounds of birds, breezes, and bugs hurt herears. Trees draped with streamers of moss, rocks incrusted with lichen andsnarled in roots and vines, and patches of damp, dark mist crowded in allaround. The overpowering presence of it all terrified her. Breathe, the sliphtold her. The thought horrified her. No.The sliph’s voice seemed to sear through Kahlan’s mind. Breathe. Kahlan didn’twant to be thrust from the serene womb of the sliph into this garish, loudworld.She remembered Richard, and with Richard, the threat to him: Shota. Kahlanexpelled the sliph from her lungs. The liquid silver sloughed from her, yet shewas not wet. She gasped a deep breath of the strange, sharp air. She covered herears and shut her eyes as the sliph set her on the edge of the well. “We arewhere you wished to travel,” the sliph said.Kahlan reluctantly opened her eyes and lowered her hands. The living worldseemed to slow and settle into harmony with what she expected it to be. Thecomforting hand of the sliph slipped from Kahlan’s waist. “Thank you, sliph. Itwas... a pleasure.”The sliph’s fluid face smiled. “I am pleased that you found it pleasurable.”“I hope not to be long, and then we must travel back.”“I will be ready when you wish to travel again,” the sliph said. her voiceechoing out into the gloom. “I am always ready to travel, if I am awake.”Kahlan swung her legs down off the stone wall of the sliph’s well. Parts of anancient structure were visible, but it seemed mostly to have crumbled into thedamp, tangled forest. She could see a bit of a wall here, half of a columnthere, some paving stones on the ground, all covered with vines and roots andleaves.Kahlan didn’t know exactly where she was, but she knew she was in the sombrewoods around the witch woman’s home. Kahlan remembered going through thisdangerous, mysterious forest when Shota had captured her and taken her to AgadenReach in order to draw Richard there.Jagged peaks, like a wreath of thorns, sheltered the murky forest high up in thevast spine of the Rang’Shada mountains. The dark and dangerous woods, in turn,surrounded and protected Shota’s remote home. These woods kept people away fromAgaden Reach, away from the witch woman.Whoops, clicks, and calls echoed through the stagnant stink. Kahlan rubbed herarms, even though the air was damp and warm. Her chill came from within.Through small, rare gaps in the forest canopy, Kahlan could detect the pink glowof the sky. It must be just dawn. She knew that the brightening day would bringno relief to the gloom of these woods. On the sunniest day, this morose placewas never anything more than dismally dark.Kahlan stepped carefully, watching the forest floor, the hanging vines, and thedrifting fog that seemed to conceal creatures issuing strings of hissing clicksand hooting calls. In the expanses of stagnant water lurking under the thickvegetation, she could see eyes just breaking the surface.Kahlan took another careful step and then paused. She realized that in thedirectionless forest, she didn’t know where she was going. There was no tellingnorth from south, east from west. This wood looked the same in all directions.She realized, too, that she didn’t even know if Shota was home. The last timeRichard and Kahlan had seen Shota was at the Mud People’s village. Shota hadbeen driven from her home by a wizard aligned with the Keeper. Shota might notbe here.No, Nadine had visited her. Shota was here. Kahlan took another step. Somethingsnatched her ankle and yanked her feet from under her. She landed on her backwith a hard thud.A heavy, dark shape sprang onto her chest, driving the wind from her lungs. Ahiss, carried on fetid breath, came from between sharp teeth packed with grey,spongy filth. “Pretty lady.” Kahlan gasped to catch her breath. “Samuel! Get offme!”Powerful fingers squeezed her left breast. Bloodless lips drew back with awicked grin. “Maybe Samuel eat pretty lady.”Kahlan pressed the point of the bone knife up into the folds of skin at Samuel’sneck. She seized one of his long fingers and bent it back until he squealed andreleased her breast.She jabbed the knife against his throat. “Maybe I’ll feed you to the things inthe water over there. What do you think? Shall I slit your throat? Or do youwant to get off me?”The hairless, splotchy grey head drew back. Yellow eyes, like twin lanterns inthe dim light, glared hatefully down at her. He carefully rolled to the side tolet her up. Kahlan kept the bone knife trained on him.Dead leaves and forest debris stuck to his waxy skin. A long arm lifted to pointoff into the dark mist. “Mistress wants you.”“How does she know I’m here?”The grotesque face split with a hissing grin. “Mistress knows everything. FollowSamuel.” He skittered a few steps and then stopped to look back over hisshoulder. “When mistress is finished with you, Samuel will eat you.”“I may just have something for Shota she isn’t expecting. She’s made a mistakethis time. When I’m finished with her, you may not have a mistress.”The squat figure stared, appraising her. His bloodless lips pulled back and hehissed.“Your mistress is waiting. Get going.”The stocky, hairless, long-armed figure finally moved on through theundergrowth. He skirted dangers Kahlan didn’t see, and grudgingly pointed atthings for her to avoid. Vines he circumvented reached for her as she passed,but she was too far away for them to catch her. Roots Samuel bypassed snarledup, trying to snare her.The short figure, dressed only in pants held up with straps, glanced over hisshoulder occasionally to make sure she followed. A couple of times, he gurgledhis odd laugh as he bounded along.After a time, they picked up a trail of sorts, and not long after that the lightcoming through the tangled mass of branches overhead became brighter. As Kahlanfollowed the repulsive little creature, they came at last to the edge of thedark wood, and the edge of a cliff.Far below lay the verdant valley where lived the witch woman. That it was asbeautiful a place as any in the Midlands didn’t ease the anxious knot inKahlan’s stomach. All around the valley the massive rocky peaks of thesurrounding mountains soared nearly straight up. The budding trees in the placidvalley below swayed gently in the early morning breeze.Descending the sheer walls of rock looked to be impossible, but Kahlan knew frombeing here before that there were steps carved in the rock. Samuel led herthrough a morass of brush, tight trees, and fern-covered boulders, to a placethat would be nearly impossible to find without him to guide her. A trail hiddenbehind rocks, trees, ferns, and vines ran to the edge of the precipice and thesteps leading down the cliff walls.Samuel pointed off. down into the valley. “Mistress.”“I know. Get moving.”Kahlan followed Samuel down the cliff’s edge. Part of it was a narrow trail, butmost of the way down was comprised of thousands of steps cut into the ruggedrock wall. They twisted and turned downward, sometimes spiralling back underones above.Below, far off in the center of the valley, among the streams, grand trees, androlling fields, sat Shota’s graceful palace. Colorful flags flew atop towers andturrets as if to announce a festival. Kahlan could hear the distant flagssnapping in the wind. She had trouble seeing it for the splendid place it was.She saw it as the center of the spiderweb. A place where threat lurked. Threatfor Richard.Samuel sprang down the steps ahead, happy to be going back to the protection ofhis mistress, no doubt thinking about cooking Kahlan in a stew when his mistresswas finished with her.Kahlan hardly noticed the hateful glances from the big yellow eyes. She, too,was lost in a world of loathing.Shota wanted to harm Richard. Kahlan kept that thought foremost in her mind: itwas key. Shota wanted to deny Richard happiness. Shota wanted Richard to suffer.Kahlan could feel angry power welling up inside her, ready to do her bidding andeliminate the threat against Richard. Kahlan had at last found the way to defeatShota. Shota had no shield against Subtractive power. It would slice through anymagic she threw out.Kahlan had found the path, the gateway, through the labyrinth of protectionlayered over her magic, to the core of its power. This side of her magic wasprotected by precepts that governed its use. Like the Wizards’ Keep, protectedby shields of all kinds, there was a way to get through. She had found a way toget through the Keep, and she had used her reason to find the justification thattraced its way through the maze of rationale forbidding this magic’s use. Shehad tapped its ancient strength, its destructive power. Kahlan felt the powercoursing up through her and down her arms. Blue light snarled and snapped aroundher fists. She was nearly lost in a trance of purpose.For the first time, Kahlan wasn’t afraid of the witch woman. If Shota didn’tswear to leave Richard alone, to let him have his own life, Shota was going tobe dust before this day was out.At the bottom of the cliff, Kahlan followed behind Samuel as he bounded alongthe road among tree-dotted hills and green fields. Snow-capped peaks all aroundsoared up past a scattering of clouds. Blue deepened in the sky as the sun roseover those peaks.Kahlan felt as if she had enough power blazing within her to level those peaks.Shota had only to say or do the wrong thing-to prove herself a threat toRichard- and she would be no more.The road led up a gentle rise from which Kahlan could see the spires of thepalace through the trees ahead. Samuel glanced back to make sure she was stillfollowing, but Kahlan didn’t need his direction; she knew that Shota waited inthe grove of trees below.The witch woman was the last person Kahlan ever wanted to see again, but if itwas to be, then, this time, she intended it to be on her terms.Samuel halted and pointed with a long finger. “Mistress.” Yellow eyes gloweredback at Kahlan. “Mistress wants you.”Kahlan lifted a warning finger to his face. Threads of blue light crackledaround the finger.“If you get in my way, or interfere, you will die.”He glanced from her finger back into her eyes. His bloodless lips drew back ashe hissed, and then he skittered off into the trees.In a cocoon of seething magic, Kahlan advanced down the slope toward the waitingwitch woman. The breeze was spring-warm, the day bright and cheerful. Kahlanfelt no cheer.Sheltered among the towering maples, ash, and oak, sat a table covered with awhite cloth and set with food and drink. Beyond the table, atop three squarewhite marble platforms, stood a massive throne carved with gold-leaf vines,snakes, and other beasts.Shota sat regally, one leg crossed casually over the other, her ageless almondeyes watching Kahlan’s approach. Shota’s arms rested on the chair’s high, widelyspaced arms, with her hands draped arrogantly over gold gargoyles. The gargoylesnuzzled her hands, as if hoping to be stroked. A rich canopy draped with heavyred brocade and trimmed with gold tassels shaded the throne’s occupant from themorning sun, yet her luxuriant auburn hair shimmered as if touched by streamersof sunlight.Kahlan halted, not far away, under the witch woman’s rock-hard, penetratinggaze. The blue lightning screamed for release.Shota clicked her lacquered fingernails together. A self-satisfied smile spreadacross her full red lips.“Well, well, well,” Shota said in her velvety voice. “The child assassin arrivesat last.”“I am not an assassin,” Kahlan said. “Nor am I a child. But I have had enough ofyour games.”Shota’s smile slipped away. She put her hands to the chair’s arms and stood.Points of her wispy, low-cut, variegated grey dress lifted in the gentle breeze.Her gaze never left Kahlan as she gracefully descended the three white marbleplatforms. “You’re late.” Shota held a hand out to the table. “The tea isgetting cold.” Kahlan flinched when a bolt of lightning struck from the bluesky, hitting the teapot. Amazingly, it didn’t shatter.Shota glanced down at Kahlan’s hands, and then back to her eyes. “There. Ibelieve it’s hot, now. Please, won’t you have a seat? We will have tea and...conversation.”Knowing Shota had seen the ominous blue light, Kahlan returned the self-assuredsmile in kind. Shota drew out a chair and sat. She again held out a hand ininvitation. “Please, have a seat. I imagine you have things you wish todiscuss.” Kahlan slid into a chair as Shota poured tea, holding on the white topwith her other hand as she did so. Steam rose from the cups. The tea was indeedhot. Shota lifted a gold-trimmed platter, offering Kahlan toast. Kahlan warilypulled a golden-crisp slab from the platter. Shota slid a bowl of honeyed butteracross the table. “Well,” Shota said. “Isn’t this unpleasant.” Against her will,Kahlan smiled. “Very.”Shota picked up her silver knife and spread honeyed butter across her slice oftoast. She took a sip of tea.“Eat, child. Murder is always best accomplished on a full stomach.”“I have not come to murder you.”Shota’s sly smile returned. “No, I suppose you have managed to justify it toyourself. Retribution, is it? Or perhaps self-defense. Punishment? Recompense?Justice?” The smooth smile widened. An eyebrow arched. “Bad manners?”“You sent Nadine to marry Richard.”“Ahh. Jealousy, then.” Shota leaned back as she sipped her tea. “A noble motive,were it justified. I hope you realize that jealousy can be a cruel taskmaster.”Kahlan nibbled her crunchy toast. “Richard loves me, and I love him. We’reengaged to be married.”“Yes, I know. For one who professes to love him, I would think you would be moreunderstanding.”“Understanding?”“Of course. If you love someone, you want them to be happy. You want what’s bestfor them.”“I make Richard happy. He wants me. I’m best for him.”“Yes, well, we can’t always have what we want, now can we?” Kahlan suckedhoneyed butter from her finger. “Just tell me why you wish to hurt us.”Shota looked genuinely surprised. “Hurt you? Is that what you think? You think Iam being spiteful?”“Why else would you always try to keep us apart, to hurt us?” Shota took adainty bite of toast. She chewed for a moment. “Has the plague come, yet?” Thecup paused partway to Kahlan’s lips. “How do you know about that?”“I’m a witch woman. I see the current of events. Let me ask you a question. Ifyou visited a young child sick with the plague, and the child’s mother asked youif her child was going to recover, and you told her the truth, would you beguilty of causing the child’s death because you foretold it?”“Of course not.”“Ah. It is only I, then, who am to be judged by different standards.”“I’m not judging you. I simply want you to stop interfering with Richard’s andmy life together.”“A messenger is often blamed for the message.”“Shota, the last time we saw you, you said that if we stopped the Keeper, youwould owe us a debt. You asked me to help Richard. We stopped the Keeper. Itcost us dearly, but we did it. You owe us.”“Yes, I know,” Shota whispered. “That is why I sent Nadine.” Kahlan could feelthe rage of power surge within her. “Seems a strange way to show yourappreciation-sending someone to try to ruin our lives.”“No, child,” Shota said gently. “You see things through blind eyes.” Kahlan hadto help Richard by finding out all she could, but she would defend herself andRichard if she had to. Until that became necessary, she could endure thiswandering conversation, if it would help get the answers they needed. And theydid need answers. “What do you mean?”Shota sipped her tea. “Have you lain with Richard?”Kahlan was taken off guard by the question, but she recovered quickly. Sheshrugged one shoulder in an offhanded manner. “Yes, as a matter of fact, Ihave.” Shota’s gaze rose from her tea. “You’re lying.”Pleased by the smoldering tone in Shota’s voice, Kahlan lifted an eyebrow. “It’sthe truth. You don’t like the message, and so now you hold malice toward themessenger?”Shota’s eyes narrowed. Her gaze locked on Kahlan as if drawing a bow and aimingan arrow.“Where, Mother Confessor? Where did you lie with him?” Kahlan felt triumphant atShota’s obvious displeasure.“Where? What difference does that make? Have you turned from witch woman togossip, now? I was with him... in that way, and that’s the truth, whether youlike it or not. I’m no longer a virgin. I was with Richard; that’s all thatmatters.” Shota’s gaze turned dangerous. “Where?” she repeated. Shota’s tone wasso threatening that Kahlan forgot she needn’t be afraid of the witch woman.“In a place between worlds,” Kahlan said, suddenly embarrassed to reveal thedetails. “The good spirits... took us there,” she stammered. “The goodspirits... they wanted us to be together.”“I see.” Shota’s gaze cooled. Her small smile returned. “I’m afraid that doesn’tcount.”“Doesn’t count! What in the name of all that’s good does that mean? I was withhim. That’s all that matters. You’re just vexed because it’s true.”“True? You were not with him in this world, child. This is the world we live in.You were not with him here, where it counts. In this world, you are still avirgin.”“That’s absurd.”Shota shrugged. “Think what you will. I am satisfied that you have not been withhim.”Kahlan folded her arms. “This world, or another, it doesn’t matter. I was withhim.”Shota’s smooth brow puckered with mirth restrained. “And if you have been withhim in the place between worlds, where the good spirits took you, then why haveyou not been with him in this world, since you are no longer a virgin, here, asyou say?”Kahlan blinked. “Well, I... we... thought it best to wait until we were wedded,that’s all.”Shota’s soft, exultant laugh drifted out through the morning air. “You see? Youknow the truth of what I say.” She held the teacup between the tips of thefingers of both hands as she sipped, more balmy laughter escaping between eachsip.Kahlan fumed, somehow feeling she had lost the argument. She tried to lookconfident as she leaned back and took a drink of her own tea.“If it pleases you to delude yourself with punctilios, then be my guest. I knowwhat we did,” Kahlan said. “I don’t know why it’s any concern of yours, anyway.”Shota looked up. “You know why it’s my concern. Mother Confessor. EveryConfessor bears a Confessor. If you have his child, it will be a boy. I told youboth to remember that before you lay together. Lust dims thoughts of theconsequences.“From you, the boy would be a Confessor. From Richard, he would have the gift.Such a dangerous melding has never taken place before.”With a patient, reasoned tone, meant almost as much for herself as for the witchwoman, Kahlan hid her inner terror at Shota’s prediction.“Shota, you are a witch woman of great talent, and you may know it would be aboy, I grant you that, but you could not know he would be like most of the maleConfessors born in the past. Not all were like that. You have as much asadmitted that you don’t know if it would be so. You are not the Creator; youcan’t know what He will choose to do-if He even chooses to give us a child.”“I don’t need to see the future in this. Almost every male Confessor was likethat. They were beasts without conscience. My mother lived in the dark timescaused by a male Confessor. You would visit upon the world not only a maleConfessor, but one with the gift. You cannot even envision such a cataclysm.“It is for this very reason that Confessors are not supposed to love theirmates. If she bears a male child, she must ask the husband to kill the baby. Youlove Richard. You would not ask that of him. I have warned you that I have thestrength to do what you will not. I also told you that it will not be personal.”“You talk about the distant future as if it has come to pass. It has not,”Kahlan said. “Events do not always unfold as you say. Yet, other things havealready come to pass. Because of Richard, you still live. You told us that ifRichard and I were able to close the veil, saving you and everyone else from theKeeper, you would be forever grateful to us both.”“And so I am.”Kahlan leaned forward. “You show your gratitude not only by threatening tomurder my child should I have one, but also by trying to kill me when I come toask your help?”Shota’s brow twitched. “I have made no attempt on your life.”“You sent Samuel up there to attack me, and then you have the effrontery torebuke me for coming prepared to defend myself. The little monster threw me onthe ground and attacked me. If I hadn’t had a weapon, who knows what he wouldhave done. This is your gratitude? He said that when you were through with me,you would let him eat me. And then you expect me to believe in your benevolence?You dare to profess gratitude?”Shota’s gaze shifted toward the trees. “Samuel!” She set down her teacup.“Samuel! Come here at once!”The squat figure loped out of the trees, using his knuckles to help himselfbound across the grass. He ran to Shota and nuzzled against her legs.“Mistress,” he purred.“Samuel, what did I tell you about the Mother Confessor?”“Mistress told Samuel to go get her.” Shota looked into Kahlan’s eyes. “Whatelse did I tell you?”“To bring her to you.”“Samuel,” she said with rising inflection. “Mistress said not to harm her.”“You attacked me!” Kahlan put in. “You threw me on the ground and jumped on me!You said you were going to eat me when your mistress was through with me.”“Is that true, Samuel?”“Samuel not hurt pretty lady,” Samuel grumbled. “Is what she says true? Did youattack her?”Samuel hissed at Kahlan. Shota thunked him on the head with a finger. He shrankback against her leg.“Samuel, what did I tell you? What were my instructions?”“Samuel must guide Mother Confessor back. Samuel must not touch MotherConfessor. Samuel must not hurt Mother Confessor. Samuel must not threatenMother Confessor.”Shota drummed her fingers on the table. “And did you disobey me, Samuel?” Samuelhid his head under the hem of her dress. “Samuel, answer my question at once. Iswhat the Mother Confessor says true?”“Yes, mistress,” Samuel whined. “I’m very disappointed in you, Samuel.”“Samuel sorry.”“We will discuss this later. Leave us.”The witch woman’s servant skittered away into the trees. Shota turned back toface Kahlan’s eyes.“I told him not to harm or threaten you. I can understand why you would be upsetand think I meant you harm. Please accept my apology.” She poured Kahlan moretea. “You see? I have no intention of hurting you.”Kahlan took a sip from her full cup. “Samuel is the least of it. I know you wantto hurt me and Richard, but I’m not afraid of you anymore. You can no longerharm me.”Shota’s smug smile returned. “Really?”“I’d suggest you not try to use your power against me.”“My power? All things I do, all things everyone does, is using their power. Tobreathe is to use my power.”“I’m talking about hurting me. If you dare try it, you’ll not survive theattempt.”“Child, I have no wish to harm you, despite what you think.”“A brave thing to say, now that you know you can’t.”“Really? Did you ever think that the tea might be poisoned?” Her smile widenedwhen Kahlan stiffened. “You... ?”“Of course not. I told you. I have no wish to harm you. If I wished to harm you,I could do any number of things. I could have simply put a viper behind yourheels. Vipers dislike sudden movement.”If there was one thing Kahlan hated, it was snakes, and Shota knew it. “Relax,child. There is no viper under your chair.” Shota took a bite of her toast.Kahlan eased her breath out. “But you wished to make me think there might be.”“What I wished is for you to realize that confidence can be overrated. If itwill please you, I will tell you that I have always regarded you as singularlydangerous for any number of reasons. That you have found a way to tap the otherside of your magic means little to me.“It is the other things you do that frighten me. Your womb frightens me. Yourarrogant certitude frightens me.”Kahlan nearly leaped to her feet in anger, but then she suddenly thought of thechildren dying back in Aydindril. How many of them hung near death, shivering infear for their lives, while Kahlan stubbornly debated fault and imputation withShota. Shota knew something about the plague, and about the winds huntingRichard. What significance was Kahlan’s pride in the face of that?She remembered, too, part of the prophecy:... no blade, forged of steel orconjured of sorcery’, can touch this foe.In much the same way, crossing swords with Shota wasn’t going to work. This wasserving no purpose, and worse, solving nothing.Kahlan admitted to herself that she had come for vengeance. Her true duty shouldbe to help people who were suffering and dying. How would anything but pride besatisfied by striking out at Shota? She was stubbornly putting herself and herinsecurity above innocent lives. She was being selfish.“Shota, I came with hurt in my heart because of Nadine. I wanted you to leaveRichard and me be. You say you have no wish to harm us, and that your intent isto help. I also wish to help people who are desperate and dying. Why don’t we,for the moment at least, agree to take each other’s word as true?” Shota watchedover her teacup. “What an outrageous concept.” Kahlan reasoned with her innerfear, her inner rage. Her anguish at the things Nadine did made Kahlan want tostrike out at Shota. What if it wasn’t Shota’s fault? What if Nadine was actingon her own, much the same way as Samuel had? What if Shota was telling thetruth, if she had not meant to cause harm?If that were true, then Kahlan was guilty of a grievous wrong in wanting tostrike out at Shota.Kahlan admitted to herself that Shota had been right, that she had beenjustifying vengeance simply to be able to tap her deadly power. She hadn’t beenwilling to listen.Kahlan placed her hands on the table. Shota sipped her tea as she watched theblue glow around Kahlan’s hands fade and finally extinguish. Kahlan didn’t knowif she would be able to call it forth should Shota strike, but she realized itdidn’t matter.Failure in her true task was too great a price to pay for pride. Kahlan feltthat this was the only thing that could truly have a chance of saving herfuture, of saving Richard, and of saving those innocent people back inAydindril. Richard always said to think of the solution, not the problem. Shewould trust in Shota’s word.“Shota,” Kahlan whispered, “I always thought the worst of you. Fear has beenonly part of it. As you warned, jealousy has been my taskmaster. I beg youforgive my obstinacy and insolence.“I know that you have tried to help people before. Please, help me, now. I needanswers. Lives depend on this. Please, talk with me. I’ll try to hear with anopen mind the things you say, knowing that you are the messenger, and not thecause.”Shota set down her teacup. “Congratulations, Mother Confessor. You have earnedthe right to ask me questions. Have the courage to hear the answers, and theywill be of aid to you.”“I swear to do my best,” Kahlan said."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41Shota poured them more tea. “What do you wish to know?”Kahlan reached for her cup. “Do you know anything about the Temple of theWinds?”“No.”Kahlan paused, cup in hand. “Well, you told Nadine that the winds hunt Richard.”“I did.”“Could you explain that? What you meant?”Shota lifted a hand in a vague gesture. “I don’t know how to explain to a womanwho is not a witch how I see the flow of time, the passing of future events. Iguess you could say that it’s something like memories. When you think about apast event, or a person, say, the memory comes to you. Sometimes you morevividly remember past events. Some things you can’t recall.“My talent is like that, except I am also able to do the same with the future.To me, there is little difference between past, present, and future. I ride acurrent of time, seeing both upstream and down. To me, seeing the future is assimple as it is for you to remember the flow of past events.”“But sometimes I can’t remember things.” Kahlan said. “It is the same with me. Ican’t recall whatever happened to a bird my mother would call when I was veryyoung. I remember it sitting on her finger as she spoke soft, tender words toit. I don’t remember if it died, or if it flew away.“Other events, such as the death of a loved one, I remember vividly. I rememberthe texture of the dress my mother wore on the day she died. Even today, I couldmeasure out for you the length of the loose thread on the sleeve.”“I understand.” Kahlan stared down into her tea. “I, too, remember well the daymy mother died. I remember every horrid detail, even though I wish I couldforget.”Shota placed her elbows on the table and twined her fingers together. “Thefuture is that way with me. I can’t always see pleasant future events that Iwish to see, and I sometimes can’t avoid seeing those things I abhor. Someevents I can see with clarity, and others, despite how much I wish to see them,are only shadows in the fog.”“What about the winds hunting Richard?”With a distant look, Shota shook her head. “That was disturbing. It was as ifsomeone else’s memory was being forced on me. As if someone else was using me topass on a message.”“Do you think it was a message, or a warning?”A thoughtful frown creased Shota’s brow. “I wondered that, myself. I don’t knowthe answer. I passed it on through Nadine because I thought Richard should know.in either case.”Kahlan rubbed her forehead. “Shota, when the plague started, it started amongchildren who had been playing or watching a game.”“Ja’La.”“Yes, that’s right. Emperor Jagang-”“The dream walker.” Kahlan looked up. “You know of him?”“He visits my future memories occasionally. He plays tricks, trying to get intomy dreams. I won’t allow it.”“Do you think it possible that it was the dream walker who gave you this messageabout the winds hunting Richard?”“No. I know his tricks. Take my word; it was not a message from Jagang. What ofthe plague and the Ja’La game?”“Well, Jagang used his ability as a dream walker to slip into the mind of awizard he sent to assassinate Richard. He was at the Ja’La game. The wizard, Imean. Jagang saw the game through this wizard’s eyes.“Jagang was incensed that Richard had changed the rules so that all the childrencould play. The plague started among those children. That’s one reason we thinkJagang was responsible.“The first child we went to see was near death.” Kahlan closed her eyes andcovered them with her fingertips at the memory. She took a settling breath.“While Richard and I knelt at his side, he died. He was just a boy. An innocentboy. His whole body was rotting from the plague. I can’t imagine the sufferinghe endured. He died before our eyes.”“I’m sorry,” Shota whispered.Kahlan composed herself before looking up. “After he had died, his hand reachedup and grabbed a hold of Richard’s shirt. His lungs filled with air, he pulledRichard close, and he said, ‘The winds hunt you.’“A troubled sigh came from across the table. “Then I was right; it was notsomething I saw, but a message sent through me.”“Shota, Richard thinks it means that the Temple of the Winds is hunting him. Hehas a journal from a man who lived during the great war of three thousand yearsago. The journal tells of how the wizards of that time placed things of greatvalue, and great danger, in the temple, and then they sent the temple away.”Frowning, Shota leaned forward. “Away? Away where?”“We don’t know. The Temple of the Winds was atop Mount Kymermosst.”“I know the place. There is no temple there, only a few bits of old ruins.”Kahlan nodded. “It’s possible the wizards used their power to blast the side ofthe mountain away and bury the temple in a rockslide. Whatever they did, it’sgone. From information in the journal, Richard believes that the red moons werea warning from the temple. He further believes that the Temple of the Winds isalso known more simply as ‘the winds.’“Shota tapped a finger against the side of her teacup. “So the message could havecome directly from the Temple of the Winds.”“Do you think that possible? How could a place send a message?”“The wizards of that time could do things with magic we can only wonder at. Thesliph, for example. From what I know, and what you have told me, my best guesswould be that Jagang has somehow stolen something deadly from the Temple of theWinds, and used it to start the plague.”Kahlan felt a cold wave of fright flood through her. “How could he do such athing?”“He is a dream walker. He has access to untold knowledge. Despite his crudeobjectives, he is anything but stupid. I have been touched by his mind in mysleep, when he hunts in the night. He is not to be underestimated.”“Shota, he wishes to extinguish all magic.”Shota lifted an eyebrow. “I have already told you I will answer your questions.There is no need to convince me of my own interest in this matter. Just as thedanger from the Keeper, Jagang is no less a threat to me. He promises toeliminate magic, but to accomplish those ends he uses magic.”“But how could he have stolen this plague from the Temple of the Winds? Do youthink it even possible? Really?”“I can tell you that the plague did not start of its own account. Your guess iscorrect. It was ignited through magic.”“How can we stop it?”“I know of no cure for plague.” Shota took a sip of her tea. She glanced up atKahlan. “On the other hand, how could a plague be started?”“Magic.” Kahlan frowned. “You mean... you mean that if magic could start it,even though we don’t know how to cure the plague, magic may be able to stop it?Is that what you’re suggesting?”Shota shrugged. “I know no more how to start a plague than to cure it. I knowmagic started this one. If magic started it, then it would stand to reason thatmagic could halt it.”Kahlan straightened. “Then there is hope we can stop it, and save all thosepeople from dying.”“Possibly. If we were to put the pieces together, it would at least suggest thatJagang stole from the Temple of the Winds magic to start the plague, and thatthe temple is trying to warn Richard of the violation.”“Why Richard?”“Why do you think? What makes Richard different from anyone else?” Kahlan felttransfixed by Shota’s small, sly smile.“He’s a war wizard. He has Subtractive Magic. It’s how he defeated the spirit ofDarken Rahl and stopped the Keeper. Richard is the only one with the power to dowhatever it is that can help.”“Keep that in mind,” Shota whispered into her teacup.Kahlan was suddenly getting the feeling that she was being led down a path. Shedismissed the feeling. Shota was trying to help. Kahlan gathered her courage.“Shota, why did you send Nadine?”“To marry Richard.”“Why Nadine?”Shota’s lips spread in a sad smile. It was the question for which she had beenwaiting.“Because I care about him. I wanted it to be someone in whom he could find atleast some small comfort.” Kahlan swallowed. “But he finds comfort in me.”“I know. But he is to marry another.”“The flow of the future tells you this? Your future... memory?” Shota gave her asingle nod. “It wasn’t your idea? You didn’t simply want to send someone tomarry him so I wouldn’t?”“No.” Shota leaned back in her chair and stared off into the trees. “I saw thathe will marry another. I see great pain for him in this. I exerted all myinfluence so that it would be someone he knew, someone in whom he would find atleast some solace. I wanted to spare him as much pain in it as I could.”Kahlan didn’t know what to say. She felt as she had when she was strugglingagainst the flow of water down in the drainage tunnel when she was fightingMarlin. She remembered the weight of the water, the way it pinned her in place.“But I love him,” was all she could think to say.“I know,” Shota whispered back. “It was not my choice to have him marry another.I was only able to influence who it would be.”Kahlan struggled to pull a shaky breath as she looked away from the witchwoman’s ageless eyes.“I had no say,” Shota added, “in who would be your husband.” Kahlan’s gazereturned to Shota. “What? What do you mean?”“You are to be wedded. It is not Richard. I could not influence that part of it.That is not a good sign.” Kahlan felt stunned. “What do you mean?”“The spirits are somehow involved in this. They would only accept limitedinfluence. They have their reasons for the rest of it. Those reasons are veiledfrom me.”Kahlan felt a tear run down her check. “Shota, what am I to do? I’ll lose myonly love. I could never love anyone but Richard, even if I wished it. I’m aConfessor.”Shota sat still as stone as she watched Kahlan. “The good spirits have grantedus all they could in allowing me to have a say in who will be Richard’s bride. Isearched, and could find no other woman for whom he feels even this limitedempathy. She was the best I could do.“If you truly love Richard, then you should try to find comfort in the fact thathe will have Nadine, a woman he knows and for whom he at least has some feeling,however small. Perhaps, with a woman such as this, he will someday findhappiness and come to love her.”Kahlan put her trembling hands in her lap. She felt sick to her stomach. Itwould do no good to argue with Shota. This wasn’t her doing. The spirits wereinvolved.“To what purpose? What good will it do for him to marry Nadine? For me to bemated to one I don’t love?”Shota’s voice came soft and compassionate. “I don’t know, child. Just as someparents, for a variety of reasons, choose their children’s spouses, so have thespirits chosen for you and Richard.”“If the spirits were involved, why would they desire our misery? They took us tothat place so we could be together.” Kahlan struggled against the weight of thefloodwaters. “Why would they want to do this to us?”“Perhaps,” Shota whispered as she watched Kahlan, “it is because you will betrayhim.”Kahlan’s throat clenched shut, locking her breath in her lungs. The prophecyscreamed through her head.. . . for the one in white, his true beloved, will betray him in her blood.Kahlan shot to her feet. “No!” Her hands balled into fists. “I would never hurthim! I would never betray him!” Shota calmly sipped her tea.“Sit down. Mother Confessor.”Kahlan fought to keep the tears back as she sank into her chair. “I don’tcontrol the future memories any more than I control the past. I told you, youmust have the courage to hear the answers.” She tapped a finger to her temple.“Not only here”-she tapped the finger over her heart-”but here. too.”Kahlan made herself take a deep breath. “Forgive me. It’s not your fault. I knowthat.”Shota lifted an eyebrow. “Very good. Mother Confessor. Learning to accept thetruth is the first step to gaining control of your destiny.”“Shota, I don’t mean this to sound disrespectful, but seeing the future does notprovide all the answers. Before, you told me that I would touch Richard with mypower. I thought that would destroy him. I tried to kill myself to prevent yourwords from coming to pass, to prevent myself from hurting him.“Richard wouldn’t allow me the chance at suicide. As it turned out, your seeingof the future was true, but there was more to it, and it turned out differentlythan we thought.“I touched Richard, but his magic protected him, and my touch didn’t harm him.”“I didn’t see the result of the touch. Only that you would touch him. This isdifferent. I see you both being wedded.” Kahlan felt numb. “Who is it to be thatI will marry?”“I see only a misty form. I cannot see the person. I do not know his identity.”“Shota, I was told that a witch woman’s seeing of future events is a form ofprophecy.”“Who told you this?”“A wizard. Zedd.”“Wizards,” Shota muttered. “They don’t know what is in a witch woman’s mind.They think they know everything.”Kahlan pushed her long hair back over her shoulder. “Shota, we were going to behonest with each other, remember?”Shota let out a dainty grumble. “Well, I guess that in this case, they may bemostly right.”“Prophecy does not always turn out how it seems. The dire dangers can beavoided, or changed. Do you think there is any way I can change the prophecy?”Shota frowned. “The prophecy?”“The one you mentioned. Betraying Richard.”Shota’s frowned deepened into suspicion. “Are you saying that this was alsoforetold in a prophecy?”Kahlan’s eyes turned away from the witch woman’s intense gaze. “When the wizardcame, with Jagang possessing his mind, Jagang said that he had invoked aprophecy to trap Richard. It, too, says I will betray him.”“Do you remember this prophecy?”Kahlan rubbed her finger around the rim of her teacup. “It’s one of thosememories that we spoke of, the memories we wish we could forget, but we can’t.“ ‘On the red moon will come the firestorm. The one bonded to the blade willwatch as his people die. If he does nothing, then he, and all those he loves,will die in its heat, for no blade, forged of steel or conjured of sorcery, cantouch this foe. “ To quench the inferno, he must seek the remedy in the wind.Lightning will find him on that path, for the one in white, his true beloved,will betray him in her blood.’“Shota leaned back, taking her teacup with her. “It is true, as you say, that theevents in prophecy can be altered, or avoided, but not in a double bindprophecy. This one is such a prophecy, a trap that ensnares its victim. The redmoon proves that the trap has sprung.”“But there must be a way-” Kahlan pushed her hands back into her hair. “Shota,what am I to do?”“You are to be wedded to another,” she whispered, “as is Richard. What isbeyond, I don’t see, but this much of it is the future.”“Shota, I know you’re speaking the truth, but how can it be that I would betrayRichard? I’m telling you the truth; I would die before I would betray him. Myheart won’t allow me to betray him. I couldn’t.”Shota smoothed a loose wisp of her dress. “Think. Mother Confessor, and you willsee that you are wrong, just as I showed you that you were wrong that I could nolonger harm you.”“How? How could I do such a thing, when I know it isn’t in me-for any reason-tobetray him?”Shota took a patient breath. “It is not nearly so difficult as you wish tothink. What if you knew, for example, that you had only one way to save hislife, and that way was to betray him, but in so doing, you would lose his love?Would you make the sacrifice of his love to preserve his life? The truth, now.”Kahlan swallowed past the lump in her throat. “Yes. I would betray him if it wasto save his life.”“So, you see, it is not as impossible an event as you imagined.”“I guess not,” Kahlan said in a small voice. She pushed at a few crumbs on thetable. “Shota, what is the purpose of all this? Why would the future hold thatRichard will marry Nadine, and that I will marry another man? There must be areason. It goes against everything we both want, so there must be some forcepushing events down that path.”Shota said after a moment’s deliberation, “The Temple of the Winds huntsRichard. The spirits have a hand in this.” Kahlan’s face sank wearily into herhands.“You said to Nadine, ‘May the spirits have mercy on him.’ What did you mean bythat?”“The underworld contains more than just the good spirits. The spirits-good, andthe evil-are all involved in this.”Kahlan didn’t want to talk anymore. It was too painful, talking about theruination of her dreams and hopes as if they were pieces on a game board. “Towhat purpose?” she mumbled. “The plague.” Kahlan looked up. “What?”“It has something to do with the plague, and the thing of magic the dream walkerstole from the Temple of the Winds.”“You mean that it could be that this could somehow be part of our attempt tofind the magic to stop the plague?”“I believe it is so,” the witch woman said at last. “You and Richard aredesperately seeking a way to stop the plague and save the lives of countlesspeople. I see in the future that you each wed other people.“For what other reason would both of you make such a sacrifice?”“But why would it be necessary-”“You seek something I cannot answer. I cannot alter what will be, nor do I knowthe reason for it. We are forced to consider the possibilities. Think.“If the only way to save all those people from dying in a firestorm of plaguewere for Richard and you to sacrifice your life together, perhaps, say, to proveyour true devotion to protecting innocent lives, would you both do such athing?”Kahlan put her trembling hands in her lap, under the table. She had seen thepain in Richard’s eyes when he had watched that boy die. She knew her own pain.They had both seen innocent, sick children, who were going to die. How many morewould die?She would never be able to live with herself if the only way to save thosechildren was to sacrifice her love, and she refused.“How could we not? Even if it would kill us, how could we not? But how could thegood spirits demand such a price?”Kahlan suddenly remembered Denna’s spirit taking the Keeper’s mark from Richard,and freely choosing to go in Richard’s place to eternal torment at the Keeper’shands. That it turned out that Denna didn’t have to face that fate didn’tmatter; she thought that she would, and had sacrificed her soul in the place ofone she loved.The branches of a nearby maple tree clacked together in the gentle breeze.Kahlan could hear the flags atop Shota’s palace snapping in the wind. The airtasted of spring. The grasses were a bright, new green. Life was beginning tobud all around. Kahlan’s heart felt like dead ashes.“Then I will tell you one other thing,” Shota said, as if from a great distance.Kahlan listened from the bottom of a well of despair. “You have not heard thelast message from the winds. You will receive one more, involving the moon. Thiswill be the consequential communion.“Do not ignore it, nor dismiss it. Your future, Richard’s future, and the futureof all those innocent people will hinge on this event. Both of you must use allyou have learned in order to comprehend the chance you will be offered.”“Chance? Chance for what?”Shota’s gaze riveted Kahlan. “The chance to carry out your most solemn duty. Thechance to save all the innocent lives of those who depend upon you to do whatthey cannot.”“How soon?”“I only know it will not be long.”Kahlan nodded. She wondered why she wasn’t crying. It seemed as if this was themost devastating personal tragedy she could imagine-losing Richard-and yet, shewasn’t crying. She guessed she would, but not now, not here.Kahlan stared at the table. “Shota, you would try to stop us from having achild, wouldn’t you? A boy child?”“Yes.”“You would try to kill our son, if we had one, wouldn’t you?”“Yes.”“Then how do I know that this isn’t just some plot on your part to prevent usfrom having a child?”“You will have to judge the truth of my words with your own mind and heart.”Kahlan remembered the dying boy’s words, and the prophecy. Somehow, she hadknown all along that she would never marry Richard. It was all just animpossible dream.When she was young, Kahlan had asked her mother about growing up and having alove. a husband, a home. Her mother had stood before her, beautiful, radiant.statuesque, but wearing her Confessors face. Confessors don’t have love, Kahlan.They have duty. Richard was born a war wizard. He had been born for a purpose.Duty. She watched the breeze roll a few of the crumbs from the table. “I believeyou,” Kahlan whispered. “I wish I didn’t, but I do. You’re telling me thetruth.”There was nothing else to say. Kahlan stood. She had to lock her knees to stayupright on her trembling legs. She tried to remember where the sliph’s well was,but she couldn’t seem to make her mind work. “Thank you for the tea,” she heardherself say. “It was lovely.” If Shota answered, Kahlan didn’t hear it.“Shota?” Kahlan grasped the back of the chair to steady herself. “Could youpoint me in the right direction? I can’t seem to remember...”Shota was there, taking her arm. “I will walk partway with you, child,” Shotasaid in a soft, compassionate voice, “so you may find your way.”They walked the road in silence. Kahlan tried to find cheer in the warm springmorning. It was still so cold in Aydindril. It had been snowing when she left.Still, she couldn’t find any cheer in the fine day.As they climbed the stone steps cut into the cliff, Kahlan fought to regain asense of purpose. If she and Richard could somehow save all those people fromthe plague, it would be a wonderful thing. Most wouldn’t care about thesacrifice they made, but that wouldn’t lessen the relief she would feel in thesound of a child’s laughter, or the sight of a mother’s joy in her child’ssafety.There would still be things to live for. She could fill the void with thehappiness to be seen in the eyes of her people. She would have done something noother could do. She and Richard would have stopped Jagang from harming all thosepeople.Near the top of the cliff, Kahlan paused at a turn in the steps and looked outat Agaden Reach. It truly was a beautiful place, this valley nestled among thepeaks of jagged mountains.She remembered that the Keeper had sent a wizard and a screeling to kill Shota.Shota had barely escaped with her life. She had vowed to regain her home.“I’m glad you got your home back. I’m glad for you, Shota. I really am. AgadenReach belongs to you.”“Thank you. Mother Confessor.”Kahlan looked to the witch woman’s almond eyes. “What did you do to the wizardwho chased you out?”“What I said I would do. I tied him up by his thumbs, and I skinned him alive. Isat back and watched as his magic bled from his skinless carcass.” She turnedand gestured back down into the green valley. “I covered the seat of my thronewith his hide.”Kahlan remembered that that was precisely what Shota had promised to do. It wassmall wonder that even wizards rarely dared to enter Agaden Reach; Shota wasmore than a match for a wizard. One wizard, at least, had learned that lessontoo late.“I can’t say I blame you-the Keeper sending him to kill you and all. If theKeeper had gotten you, well, I know how much you feared that.”“I owe you and Richard a debt. Richard prevented the Keeper from having us all.”‘I’m glad the wizard didn’t send you to the Keeper, Shota.” Kahlan really meantit. She still knew Shota was dangerous, but the witch woman seemed also to havea compassion that Kahlan hadn’t expected.“Do you know what he said to me, this wizard?” Shota asked. “He said he forgaveme. Can you believe it? He granted me forgiveness. And then he begged mine.”The wind carried some of Kahlan’s hair across her face. She pulled it back.“Seems a strange thing for him to say, considering.”“The Wizard’s Fourth Rule, he called it. He said that there was magic inforgiveness, in the Fourth Rule. Magic to heal. In forgiveness you grant, andmore so in the forgiveness you receive.”“I guess the Keeper’s minion would say anything to try to get away with what hehad done, and to get away from you. I can understand you not being in the moodto forgive him.”Light seemed to vanish into the ageless depths of Shota’s eyes. “He forgot toplace the word ‘sincere’ before ‘forgiveness.’“"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42Kahlan watched the witch woman disappear back into the gloomy forest. Vineshanging down from craggy branches reached out to touch their mistress as shepassed, while tendrils and roots stretched up to brush her leg. She vanishedinto a shroud of mist. Unseen creatures called in low whistles and clicks fromthe direction she had gone.Kahlan turned back to the moss-covered boulder Shota had shown her and, justbeyond, found the sliph’s well. The silver face of the sliph rose from beyondthe round, stone wall, to watch as Kahlan approached. Kahlan almost wished thesliph hadn’t come, as if somehow, if Kahlan couldn’t get back, none of thethings she had learned would come to pass.How was she going to look into Richard’s eyes and not scream in anguish? How wasshe ever going to be able to go on? How would she find the will to live? “Do youwish to travel?” the sliph asked. “No, but I must.”The sliph frowned, as if well puzzled. “If you wish to travel, I will be ready.”Kahlan sank to the ground, put her back to the sliph’s well, and folded her legsunder herself. Was she to give up this easily? Was she to submit meekly to thefates? She didn’t have a choice. Think of the solution, not the problem.Somehow, things didn’t seem as desperate as they had back in the reach. Therehad to be a way to solve this. Richard would not so easily give in. He wouldfight for her. She would fight for him. They loved each other, and that was moreimportant than anything else.Kahlan’s mind felt as if it were in a fog. She tried to focus with more resolve.She couldn’t just give up. She had to face this with her old determination.She knew that witch women bewitched people. They didn’t necessarily do it out ofmalice; it was just the way they were. It was like a person not being able tohelp the fact that they were tall, or short, or the color of their hair. Witchwomen bewitched people because that was the way their magic worked.Shota had bewitched Richard, to an extent. Only the magic of the Sword of Truthsaved him the first time. The Sword of Truth.Richard was the Seeker. This was the kind of thing a Seeker did: solvedproblems. She was in love with the Seeker. He would not so easily give up.Kahlan plucked a leaf and tore little strips from it as she began to reconsidereverything she had been told by Shota. How much of it dare she believe? It wasall beginning to seem like a dream, from which she was just coming awake.Matters could not possibly be as desperate as she had thought. Her father hadtold her never to give up. to fight with every breath, with the last breath ifneed be. Nor would Richard give in easily. This wasn’t ended yet. The future wasstill the future, and despite what Shota said, the matter was not yet decided.Something at her shoulder was bothering her. As she thought, she flicked herhand at it, and then went back to tearing strips off the big leaf. There had tobe a way to solve this.When she swatted at her shoulder again, her fingers hit the bone knife. It feltwarm.Kahlan drew the knife and held it in her lap. The knife was warm. It seemed topulse and vibrate. It grew so hot that it became uncomfortable to hold.Kahlan watched, wide-eyed, as the black feathers stood up. They danced and wavedand twisted in a breeze. Her hair hung limp. The air was dead still. There wasno breeze. Kahlan shot to her feet. “Sliph!”The sliph’s silver face was right there, close. Kahlan backed away a bit.“Sliph, I need to travel.”“Come, we will travel. Where do you wish to go?”“The Mud People. I need to go to the Mud People.” The liquid features contortedin thought. “I do not know this place.”“It’s not a place. They’re people. People-” Kahlan tapped her chest-”they’repeople, like me.”“I know different peoples, but not these Mud People.” Kahlan pushed back herhair, trying to think. “They live in the wilds.”“I know places in the wilds. Which one do you wish to travel to? Name it, and wewill travel. You will be pleased.”“Well. it’s a place that’s flat. It’s a grassland. Flat grassland. No mountains,like here.” Kahlan gestured around, but realized that the sliph could see onlytrees. “I know several places like that.”“Which places? Maybe I’ll recognize them.”“I can travel to a place overlooking the Callisidrin River-”“To the west of the Callisidrin. The Mud People are farther west.”“I can travel to Tondelen Vale, the Harja Rift, Kea Plains, Sealan, HerkonSplit. Anderith, Pickton, the Jocopo Treasure-”“The what? What was the last one?” She knew most of the rest of the places thesliph named, but they weren’t close to the Mud People. “The Jocopo Treasure. Doyou wish to travel there?”Kahlan held out the warm bone knife-grandfather’s knife. Chandalen had told herhow the Jocopo had made war on the Mud People, and the ancestor spirits hadguided Chandalen’s grandfather in how to defend his people against the Jocopo.Chandalen had said they used to trade with the Jocopo, before their war. TheJocopo had to be close to the Mud People. “Say the last place again,” Kahlansaid. “The Jocopo Treasure.”At the echoing words, the black feathers danced and twisted. Kahlan shoved thebone knife back in the band around her upper arm. She sprang up onto the stonewall.“That’s where I wish to go: the Jocopo Treasure. I wish to travel to the JocopoTreasure. Can you take me there, sliph?”A silver arm swept her off the stone wall. “Come. We will travel to the JocopoTreasure. You will be pleased.”Kahlan gasped one quick breath before she was plunged into the quicksilverfroth. She let the breath go, and inhaled the sliph, but this time, numbed bytroubling thoughts of losing Richard, of his marrying Nadine, she felt norapture.Zedd cackled like a madman. Ann was upside down in his vision. He stuck out histongue at her and blew, making a long, crude sound.“You needn’t attempt to pretend,” she growled. “It seems to be your naturalstate.”Zedd moved his legs as if trying to walk upside down through the air. The bloodwas rushing to his head.“Do you wish to die with your dignity?” he asked her. “Or would you ratherlive.”“I’ll not play a fool.”“That’s the word-play! Don’t just sit there in the mud. Play in it!” She leanedover, putting her head close to his. He was standing on it in the mud. “Zedd,you can’t possibly think such a thing would work.”“You said it yourself. You are mucking about with a crazy man. It was yoursuggestion.”“I suggested no such thing!”“Perhaps you didn’t suggest it, but you were the one who gave me theinspiration. I’ll be happy to give you full credit, when we tell people thestory.”“Tell people! In the first place, it won’t work. In the second place, I realizefull well that you would be only too delighted to tell people. That’s just onemore reason why I won’t do it.”Zedd howled like a coyote. He stiffened his legs and his spine, letting himselftopple like a felled tree. Mud splashed on Ann. Fuming, she wiped a small splatfrom her nose.At the tall stick fence, grim-faced Nangtong guards watched the two prisoners,the two sacrifices. Zedd and Ann had sat in the mud with their backs to oneanother and untied the ropes binding their wrists. The guards, armed with spearsand bows, didn’t seem to care; the prisoners couldn’t get away. Zedd knew theywere right.Happy people had begun to stop by the pigpen at dawn. As the morning wore on,the crowd grew as more people stopped by to chatter with the guards and take alook at the fine offerings. Apparently, everyone was in a good mood because theynow had a sacrifice for the spirits. Their lives would be safe after the unhappyspirits were appeased.The guards and the people of the Nangtong village, watching from the other sideof the fence, were now looking less pleased. They fidgeted with the clothcovering their faces, making sure it hid enough, and that it was secure. Theguards began wiping more ash on their faces and bodies. Apparently, one couldn’tbe too careful, lest the spirits recognize them.Zedd tucked his head down between his knees and rolled himself through the wet,sticky slop. He laughed maniacally as he rolled in a circle around Ann’s squatfigure sitting on the cold ground. “Would you stop that!”Zedd spread supine in the mud before her. He swept his rigid arms and legsthrough the mud.“Ann,” he said in a low tone, “we have important business. I think we might havebetter success if we attempt to carry out those tasks in this world, rather thanin the underworld, after we are dead.”“I know we can’t help if we’re dead.”“It would stand to reason, then, that we need to get away, now, wouldn’t it?”“Of course it would,” she grumbled. “But I don’t think-” Zedd plopped himselfdown in her lap. She winced in disgust. Her nose wrinkled when he rested hismuddy arms around her neck.“Ann, if we do nothing, we die. If we try to fight these people, we will die.Without the use of our magic, we can’t escape them. Our only option is toconvince them to let us go. We can’t speak their language, and even if we could,I doubt we would be able to persuade them.”“Yes, but-”“We have only one chance, as I see it. We must convince them that we are quiteloony. This sacrifice is a sacred service to their spirit ancestors. Look at theguards behind my back. Do they look happy?”“Well, no.”“If they believe that we’re crazy, then they just might think twice beforesacrificing us to their spirits. Wouldn’t the spirits be insulted to receive alunatic as a sacrifice? Wouldn’t that be disrespectful? We have to make themfear insulting their spirits with two loony people.”“But that’s... crazy.”“Look at it this way. A sacrifice is something like a treaty wedding between twopeoples. The bride is the sacrifice of one people to another, in the flesh ofthe new husband, all in the hope for a peaceful and productive future. Thebride’s new people treat her with respect. The bride’s people treat the husbandand his people with respect. It’s all an arrangement symbolizing unity,continuity, and hope for the future.“We are like the bride, being offered to the spirits. How would it look if theNangtong offered an unworthy, demented bride? If you were one of the spirits,wouldn’t you be offended?”“If I got you in the bargain, I would be.” Zedd howled at the sky. Ann wincedand pulled away from him. “It’s our only chance, Ann.” He leaned close,whispering in her ear. “I swear an oath as First Wizard that I will never tellanyone how you behaved.”He drew back and grinned at her. “Besides, it’s fun. Remember how much fun itwas as a child to play outside? To play in the mud? Why, it was the grandest ofthings.”“But it might not work.”“Even if it doesn’t, wouldn’t you rather die having fun on the last day of yourlife, instead of sitting here, afraid and cold and dirty? Wouldn’t you ratherhave some childlike fun one last time? Let yourself go, Prelate, and recall whatit was to be a child. Let yourself do anything that comes into your head. Havefun. Be a child.”With a serious expression, Ann considered his words. “You won’t tell anyone?”“You have my word. You can act with childish glee. and no one but I will everknow-and the Nangtong, of course.”“Another of your acts of desperation. Zedd?”“The time for desperation is upon us. Let’s play.”Ann smiled a sly smile. She stiff-armed him in the chest, knocking him back intothe mud. With a riot of laughter, she leaped on top of him.They wrestled like children, rolling through the slop. After a half dozen turns,Ann was a mud monster with arms, legs, and two eyes. The mud split, revealing apink mouth as she howled with him at the sky.They made mudballs and used the pigs as targets. They chased the pigs. Theyflopped onto the hard, round backs of the squealing creatures, riding themaround until they were tossed off into the mud. Zedd doubted that Ann had everbeen this dirty in her nine centuries of life.He realized, while they were having a one-legged game of tag that involved morefalling in the mud than hopping progress, that her laughter had changed.Ann was having fun.They stomped through puddles. They chased the pigs. They ran around theenclosure rattling sticks against the fence.And then they hit upon the idea of making faces at the guards. They drewwhimsical expressions on each other’s faces in mud. They made every rude noisethey could think of. They jumped and laughed and pointed at the solemn guards.Ann and Zedd got to laughing so hard that they couldn’t stand, and like twodrunks, they rolled on the ground, holding their sides.The crowd grew. Worried whispers swept through the onlookers.Ann stuck her thumbs in her ears and wiggled her fingers as she made faces atthem. Zedd stood on his head and sang a few lewd ballads he knew. Ann laughedhysterically as he mispronounced key words.Zedd fell to laughing, and then fell in the mud, and then Ann fell on him. Shesat on his stomach, pinning him to the ground as she tickled him under his arms,while he gasped for breath between laughter and tickled her ribs. The two ofthem had never had so much fun. The pigs cowered in the corner.Suddenly, buckets of water were dumped over the both of them as they werefuriously engaged in trying to find each other’s most ticklish spots. Theylooked up. More water rained down on them.As fast as the mud was washed off them, they dived back into it. Ash-coveredguards seized them by the arms and held them at spearpoint while they were onceagain washed off. Zedd peered over at Ann. She peered back. She lookedridiculous, her face emerging from streamers of slop. He giggled and made a faceat her. She giggled and made a face back. The men yelled.Zedd’s cheeks puffed with attempts to halt his laughing. The guards shoved themforward, spears poking in their backs. It reminded him of being tickled, andthey both laughed.It was as if once uncorked, the laughter had a life of its own. If they were tobe sacrificed, what difference did it make? They might as well have the lastlaugh.The crowd of shrouded figures parted as the two prisoners were led out of thepigs’ pen.Giggling, Zedd held his arm high and waved. “Wave at the people, Annie.”She made faces instead. Zedd liked the idea and imitated her. People shrankback, as if seeing a horrifying sight. Some of the women wept and wailed. Zeddand Ann laughed and pointed at them as the women ran from the crowd, seekingrefuge from the lunatics.The tents and onlookers were soon left behind as their captors prodded them onwith spears. Before long, the two dirty, smelly, happy sacrifices were out inthe hills. Thirty-five or forty Nangtong spirit hunters, all holding readyspears or bows, followed behind. Zedd noticed that some of them had broughtpacks and provisions.First Wizard Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander and Prelate Annalina Aldurren skipped alongahead of the spears, laughing and making outrageous, ever-increasing claims asto how many onions they could eat without producing tears.Zedd hadn’t a clue where they were going, but it was a fine morning to be goingthere, wherever it was.“It’s kind of funny, Lord Rahl,” Lieutenant Crawford said. Richard gazed outover the boulder field. “What’s funny about it?” The lieutenant bent his headback to peer up the cliff. “Well, I meant it’s odd. I grew up in ruggedmountains, so I’ve seen places like these mountains my whole life, but thisplace is odd.” He turned and pointed. “See that mountain over there? You can seewhere the rockslide came from.”Richard put a hand over his brow to shield his eyes from the low afternoon sun.The mountain the lieutenant was pointing to was rugged and covered with trees,except for the uppermost reaches. On the steep side facing them, a part of ithad given way, leaving naked rock to scar the mountain where the rock had brokenoff. At the bottom of the barren scar lay a boulder field. “What about it?”“Well, look at all the rock at the bottom. That’s the portion that broke off theface of the mountain.” He gestured to the boulder field they stood atop. “Thisisn’t the same.”Another soldier approached and saluted with a fist to his heart. He cast a waryglance at Ulic and Egan, who were standing with their arms folded, while hewaited silently.“Nothing, Lord Rahl,” he said when Richard acknowledged him. “Not so much as aflake of rock that’s been worked with tools.”“Keep looking. Try the outer fringes of the boulder field. Look for places whereyou can crawl down under some of the larger boulders and check under there,too.”The soldier saluted and hurried off. There wasn’t much of the day left. Richardhad told them that he didn’t want to stay the next day. He wanted to get back toAydindril. Kahlan would probably be back that night, or possibly tomorrow. Hewanted to be there. If she came back. If she was still alive.He broke out in a sweat at the very thought. His knees felt weak. He banishedthe thought. She would be back. That was all there was to it. She would be back.He made himself quit thinking about it, and put his mind to the problem at hand.“So what do you think, lieutenant?”Lieutenant Crawford pitched a stone, watching it bounce first off one boulder,and then another. The sharp sound echoed off the cliff behind them.“It could be that the face of this mountain broke off much longer ago. Then,over all that time, things started growing in, dying, making soil for largerthings to grow, and then they died, making yet more soil. It could be that it’sbeen covered over.”Richard knew what Lieutenant Crawford was talking about. He knew how a forest,in time, could cover over rockslides. If you dug in the forest at the bottom ofa cliff, you often encountered the bones of the fallen mountain. “I don’t thinkso, in this case.”The lieutenant looked over at him. “May I ask why you think not. Lord Rahl?”Richard stared across the rift to the next mountain. “Well, look at that cliff.The face of it is rough and uneven, yet the rock of the mountain left behindafter the face fell away is weathered now, so much of it isn’t sharp. It’s beenworn by time.“Some of it is sharp, though. Water gets in the cracks, freezes, and breaks offmore of the rock with time. You can see some of those sharp places; but most ofit has a softer look.“It has the look to me that it happened long before this slide here, yet you canstill see most of the rock lying at the bottom of the cliff. Here, there’s muchless scree.”Egan unfolded his arms and brushed back his blond hair. “Could just be the layof the land. This cliff faces south, letting the sun in to help things grow,whereas that one faces north, so it’s in shade most of the time. The forestwouldn’t grow in as well over there, and that would leave the scree exposed.”Egan had a point.“There’s more to it.” Richard tilted his head back and looked up the thousandsof feet of sheer cliff face towering above them. “Half this mountain is gone.That one over there is just a small slide, in comparison.“Look up at this mountain, and try to imagine what it would have looked likebefore this happened. It’s cleaved from the very top all the way down, like alog round split in half. All the rest of the mountains around here are more orless cone-shaped. This one is only half a cone.“Even if I’m wrong, and half the mountain isn’t gone, and it used to be shapedmuch as we see it now, there would still be an immense amount of rock down here.I mean, even if it used to be much this shape, and only a shell of rock ten ortwenty feet thick collapsed, by the towering height alone there would have to bea huge pile of rubble.“This rock is sharp, so it might be pieces broken off by the working of waterfreezing, but probably, since I can’t see any time-worn places, it happened morerecently. Yet I just don’t see any evidence of the mass of rock that would havehad to come off this mountain. Even if it had been covered over in time. I’dthink that where we’re standing would be a huge mound.”The lieutenant glanced about. “You have a point. This is pretty much level withthe bottom of the rift. If all that rock broke off, there’s no mound under theforest down here.”Richard watched the soldiers all about searching through the rock and woods forany sign of the Temple of the Winds. None looked to be finding anything.“I can’t see that it’s down here. I just don’t see any reason to believe thatthe mountain fell down here.”Ulic and Egan folded their arms again, the matter settled as far as they wereconcerned.Lieutenant Crawford cleared his throat. “Lord Rahl, if the half of MountKymer-mosst that used to be there isn’t down here, then where is it?”Richard shared a long look with the man. “That’s what I’d like to know. If itisn’t down here, then it must be someplace else.”The blond-headed lieutenant shifted his weight to his other foot. “Well, itdidn’t just get up and walk away. Lord Rahl.”Richard turned his scabbard out of the way as he started climbing down off therocks. He realized he was frightening the man; Richard seemed to be suggestingsomething that hinted at magic.“It must be as you say, lieutenant. It must have fallen and grown over. Perhapsthe cleft between the mountains was deeper back then, and the fall simply filledit in, rather than making a mound.”The lieutenant liked the idea. It gave him a rock solid reality. Richard didn’tbelieve it. The cliff face looked peculiar to him. It was too smooth, as ifcleaved with a huge sword. Yes, there were jagged places, but that would explainthe rock that was at the bottom. It looked to him as though the mountain hadbeen cut off and taken away, and over time water and ice had worked at thesmooth face of the cliff, breaking off pieces and making it more craggy; but itwas nowhere near as rough as the other cliffs round about.“That might explain it. Lord Rahl,” the lieutenant said. “If that’s true,though, that would mean that the temple you’re looking for must be buried deepunderground.”With his two huge guards right at his heels, Richard made for the horses. “Iwant to have a look up on top. I want to see the ruins up there.”Their guide, a middle-aged man named Andy Millett, was waiting with the horses.He wore simple wool clothes of browns and greens, much like Richard used towear. His shaggy brown hair hung past his ears. Andy was immensely proud thatLord Rahl had asked him to guide them to Mount Kymermosst. Richard felt a bitsheepish about that; Andy was simply the first person Richard found who knewwhere it was.“Andy, I’d like to go up to the ruins on top.”Andy handed Richard the reins to the big roan. “Sure enough. Lord Rahl. There’snot much up there, but I’d be glad to show you, just the same.”Big as his two guards were, they mounted lightly, their horses hardly movingunder the sudden weight. Richard swung up into the saddle and wiggled his rightboot into the stirrup.“Can we get up there before dark? Most of that spring snowstorm is melted. Thetrail should be open.”Andy glanced at the sun, which was just about touching a mountain. “With the wayyou ride. Lord Rahl, I’d say long before. Usually, important people slow medown. I think I’m the one slowing you down.”Richard smiled. He remembered the same thing himself. The more important theperson he guided, the slower they went, it seemed.The sky was streaked with golds and reds by the time they reached the ruins. Thesurrounding mountains were cast in deep shadow. The ruins seemed to glow in thehoneyed light.There were some once elegant structures, now crumbling, that looked to have beena part of a larger place, just as Kahlan had said. Here and there on the barrenmountaintop, parts of walls still stood, their stones not covered by vine andwood, as they would have been down below, but covered with a rust of lichensinstead. Richard dismounted and handed his reins to Lieutenant Crawford. Thebuilding to the left of the broad road was large by any standards Richard hadgrown up with, but compared to castles and palaces he had seen since, it was aninsignificant structure.The doorway stood empty. Crumbling evidence of a doorframe remained, stillpartly covered with gold leaf. Inside, the walls echoed with his footsteps. Astone bench sat in one room of the roofless building. In another room a stonefountain held snowmelt.A twisting hall with most of its barrel ceiling still in place led Richard pasta warren of rooms. The hall split, leading, he surmised, to rooms at eithercorner of the building. He followed the left branch to the room at the end.Like all the rooms on this side, it faced the cliff. Hollow rectangles gapedwhere windows once shielded the room from wind and rain. Beyond, through theopenings, was a view past the edge of the cliff to the blue haze of themountains beyond.This was the place where visitors and supplicants to the temple would haveawaited admittance. During their wait, they would have had a glorious view ofthe Temple of the Winds. If they were turned away, they left with at least thatmuch. He could almost see what those who had stood in this very spot had seen.It was his gift. he knew, that was telling him this, much the way the spirits ofthose who once held the Sword of Truth guided him when he used that magic.As he stood staring, he could almost imagine it there, just beyond the edge, aplace of grandeur and might. This was where the wizards had taken things ofpowerful magic for safekeeping. The wizards of old, some of them Richard’sancestors, had probably stood where he stood, looking out at the Temple of theWinds.Richard strolled around outside in the fading light, past the stately columns,peering into guard huts and once magnificent garden structures, touching thedeteriorating walls. Even though it all was now crumbling, it was easy for himto imagine the majestic scene it must once have been.He stood in the center of the broad road that ran through the crumbling ruins,feeling his gold cloak billowing out behind in the wind, trying to visualize theplace as it had been, trying to get the feel of it. The road, more than thebuildings, gave him the eerie feeling of the presence of the temple beyond. Thisroad had once led right into the Temple of the Winds.He strode the wide roadway, imagining striding toward the Temple of the Winds,the winds that had said they were hunting him. He passed along part of a wall,and between the hollow stone buildings, feeling the timeless quality of theplace, feeling the life that once was here.But where had it gone? How was he to find it? Where else could he look? It hadbeen here, and even now, Richard could almost see it, feel it, sense it, as ifhis gift were pulling him onward, pulling him home. Abruptly, he was jerked to ahalt.Ulic on one side of him, and Egan on the other, had seized him under his armsand pulled him back. He looked down, and saw that another step would have takenhim out into thin air. Vultures soared in the updraft not twenty feet straightin front of him.He felt as if he was standing at the edge of the world. The view was dizzying.The hair on the back of his neck stiffened.More should lie beyond the edge at his feet; he knew it should. But there wasnothing there. The Temple of the Winds was gone."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43Breathe.Kahlan did as she was told, expelling the sliph, and pulling in the sharp, coldair.The sound of a hissing torch roared in her ears. Her own breath echoedpainfully. But she knew what to expect by now, and calmly waited for the worldaround her to twist back to normal.Except this was not normal. At least it was not the normal she expected. “Sliph,where are we?” Her voice reverberated around her. “Where you wished to travel:the Jocopo Treasure. You should be pleased, but if you are not, I will tryagain.”“No, no, it isn’t that I’m not pleased, it’s just that this wasn’t what Iexpected.” She was in a cave. The torch wasn’t the familiar kind she wasaccustomed to, a length of wood with pitch at the head, but instead was made ofbundled reeds. The ceiling nearly brushed her head as she swung her legs downfrom the sliph’s well and stood.Kahlan pulled the bundled-reed torch from where it was wedged in a split in therough stone wall.“I’ll be back,” she told the sliph. “I’ll have a look around, and if I don’tfind a way out, I’ll come back and we’ll go somewhere else.” She realized thatthere must be a way out, or the torch wouldn’t have been there. “Or else, whenI’m through finding what I’m looking for, I’ll be back.”“I will be ready when you wish to travel. We will travel again. You will bepleased.”Kahlan nodded to the silver face reflecting the dancing torchlight, then steppedinto the cave. There was only one way out of the room she was in, a wide, lowpassageway, so she went through it, following it as it twisted and turnedthrough the dark brown rock. There were no other corridors, or rooms, so shekept going.The passageway led to a broad room, perhaps fifty or sixty feet across, and shefound out why this place was called the Jocopo Treasure. Torchlight reflectedback in thousands of golden sparkles. The room was filled with gold.Some was stacked in crude ingots, or spheres, as if the molten metal had beenpoured into pots, the pots then broken away. Simple boxes were piled high withnuggets. Other boxes, with handles at both ends so they could be carried by twomen, held a rubble of golden objects.There were several tables, still holding gold disks, and shelves along one wall.The shelves held several gold statues, but were filled mostly with rolled vellumscrolls. Kahlan wasn’t interested in the Jocopo Treasure; she didn’t take timeto inspect the objects all around and, instead, made for the corridor on theother side of the room.She didn’t want to linger in the room because she was worried and wanted to getto the Mud People, but even if she had been interested in looking around, shewouldn’t have stayed long; the air smelled awful, and made her gag and cough.The foul stench made her head spin and start to hurt.The air in the passageway was better, though not what she would call good. Shereached over and felt the bone knife, and found it still warm. At least itwasn’t hot, as it had been.The tunnel began slanting upward as it twisted along. As she went higher, thedark rock became dirt, in places held back with beams. She didn’t see any otherpassages branching off until she began to smell fresh air. One tunnel branchedleft, and in a few paces, another right. She felt cool air drifting down fromthe one straight ahead, and so went that way.The flame of the torch whipped and fluttered as she stepped out into the night.The sky glittered with stars. A figure not far away sprang up. Kahlan backed afew paces into the cave, glancing both ways to see if there was anyone elsewaiting outside.“Mother Confessor?” came a voice she knew. Kahlan took a step forward and heldout the torch into the night air. “Chandalen? Chandalen, is it you?”The muscular figure rushed into the torchlight. He had no shirt, and was smearedwith mud. Grass bundles were tied to his arms and head. His straight black hairwas slicked down with the sticky mud the hunters used. Even though his face wasalso smeared with the mud, she recognized the familiar, wide grin.“Chandalen,” she said with a sigh of relief. “Oh, Chandalen, I’m so happy to seeyou.”“And I you. Mother Confessor.”He advanced toward her, to slap her face in the traditional Mud People greetingto show respect for another’s strength. Kahlan held her hands out, warding him.“No! Stay away!” He straightened to a halt. “Why?”“Because there was sickness where I came from-in Aydindril. I don’t want to gettoo close to any of you, for fear I might pass the fever on to you and ourpeople.”The Mud People were, indeed, her people. She and Richard had been named MudPeople by the Bird Man and the other elders, and were now members of thevillage, even though they lived apart.Chandalen’s pleasure at seeing her faded. “There is sickness here, too, MotherConfessor. “Kahlan’s torch lowered. “What?” she whispered.“Much has happened. Our people are afraid, and I cannot protect them. We calleda gathering. Grandfather’s spirit came to us. He said that there was muchtrouble.“He said he must speak with you and that he would send you a message to come tous.”“The knife,” she said. “I felt his call through the knife. I came right away.”“Yes. Just before dawn, he told us this. One of the elders came out of thespirit house and said I was to come to this place to wait for you. How did youcome to us from the hole in the ground?”“It’s a long story. It was magic.... Chandalen, I don’t have the time to waituntil we can call another gathering to speak with the ancestor spirits. There’strouble. I can’t afford to wait three days.”He lifted the torch from her hand. His face was grim under the mud mask. “Thereis no need to wait three days. Grandfather waits for you in the spirit house.”Kahlan’s eyes widened. She knew that a gathering lasted only through the onenight it was called. “How can that be?”“The elders still sit in the circle. Grandfather told them to wait for you. He,too, waits.”“How many are sick?”Chandalen held all his fingers up once, and then only one hand a second time.“They have great pain in their heads. They empty their stomachs even though theyhave nothing in them. They burn with fever. Some begin to turn black on theirfingers and toes.”“Dear spirits,” she whispered to herself. “Have any died?”“One child died this day, just before grandfather sent me here. He was the firstto become sick.”Kahlan herself felt sick. Her head spun as she tried to come to grips with whatshe was hearing. The Mud People didn’t usually tolerate other people coming totheir village, and they rarely ventured from their lands. How could this havehappened?“Chandalen, have any outsiders come?”He shook his head. ‘We would not allow it. Outsiders bring trouble.” He seemedto reconsider. “One may have tried to come. But we would not allow her to cometo the village.”“Her?”“Yes. Some of the children were playing at hunting out in the grassland. A womancame to them, asking if she could come to the village. The children ran back totell us. When I took my hunters to the place, we could not find her. We told thechildren that their spirit ancestors would be angry if they played such tricksagain.”Kahlan feared to ask, because she feared the answer. “The child who died today,he was one of those children who said they saw the woman, wasn’t he?” Chandalencocked his head. “You are a wise woman, Mother Confessor.”“No, I’m a frightened woman, Chandalen. A woman came to Aydindril, and talked tochildren. They have begun to die, too. Did the boy who died say that she showedhim a book?”“When I went on my journey with you, you showed me these things called booksthat you use to pass on knowledge, but the children here do not know of suchthings. We teach our children with living words, as our ancestors taught us.“The boy did say that this woman showed him pretty colored lights. That does notsound like the books I remember.”Kahlan put a hand to Chandalen’s arm, a touch that once would have frightenedhim with the implied threat of a Confessor’s power, but now worried him forother reasons.“You said we should not be close.”“It doesn’t matter, now,” she reassured him. “I can cause no further harm; thesame sickness is here that is in Aydindril.”“I am sorry. Mother Confessor, that this sickness and death should visit yourhome, too.”They embraced in friendship, and shared fear. “Chandalen, what is this place?This cave?”“I told you of it once. The place with the bad air and the worthless metal.”“Then we’re north of your home?”“North, and some west.”“How long will it lake us to get back to the village?”He gave his own chest a thump with a fist. “Chandalen is strong and runs fast. Ileft our village as the sun was going down. It takes Chandalen only a couplehours. Even in the dark.”She surveyed the moonlit grassland beyond the low, rocky hill on which theystood. “There is enough moon to see our way.” Kahlan managed a small smile. “Andyou ought to know that I’m as strong as you, Chandalen.”Chandalen returned the smile. It was a wonderful sight to see, even under thecircumstances. “Yes, I remember well your strength, Mother Confessor. We willrun, then.”The moonlight conveyed intimately the ghostly, boxy shapes of the Mud People’svillage lying hidden on the dark, grass-covered plain. Few lights burned in thesmall windows. At this late hour not many people were out, and Kahlan was gladfor that; she didn’t want to see the faces of these people, see the fear andsorrow in their eyes, and know that many of them would die.Chandalen took her directly to the spirit house, among the communal buildings atthe north side of the village. Most of these buildings were bunched closetogether, but the spirit house sat apart. Moonlight reflected off the tile roofRichard had helped to make. Guards, Chandalen’s hunters, ringed the windowlessbuilding.Outside the door, on a low bench, sat the fatherly figure of the Bird Man. Hissilver hair hanging down around his shoulders shone in the moonlight. He wasnaked. Black and white mud covered his body and face in a tangle of whorls andlines: a mask all in the gathering wore so the spirits could see them.Two pots, one with white mud and the other holding black, sat on the ground atthe Bird Man’s feet. She could tell by the glazed look in his eyes that he wasin a trance, and speaking would do her no good. She knew what was required.Kahlan unbuckled her belt. “Chandalen, would you mind turning your back, please?And ask your men to do the same.” It was the greatest concession to her modestythat circumstances would allow. Chandalen called out the order to his men in hisown language. “My men and I will guard the spirit house while you and the eldersare inside,” Chandalen said to her over his shoulder.When she had slipped off all her clothes and at last stood naked in the coolnight air, the silent Bird Man began applying the gooey mud so that the spiritsmight see her, too. Sleepy chickens sat watching from the nearby low wall. Thewall still bore a slash from Richard’s sword.She knew she had to do this, to go in and speak with the spirits, but she wasn’teager; speaking with the spirit ancestors was only done in times of dire need,and while the results sometimes brought the answers needed, they never broughtjoy. When the Bird Man had finished covering Kahlan with the black and whitemud, he silently led her inside. The six elders sat in a circle around theskulls of ancestors arranged in the center. The Bird Man took his place, sittingcross-legged on the floor. Kahlan sat in the circle, opposite him. to the rightof her friend Savidlin. She didn’t speak to him; he. too. was in a trance,seeing the spirit in the center of the circle that she could not yet see.A woven basket sat behind her. Knowing why it was there, she picked it up andreached inside. Hesitantly. she seized a squirming red spirit frog and pressedits back between her breasts-the one place she wasn’t painted.The slime from the frog tingled against her skin. She released the spirit frogand took up hands with the elders to either side. It wasn’t long before she feltherself spiralling into a daze.The room began its dizzying spin. She was lifted away from the world she knew.and carried into a revolving vortex of light, shadow, aroma, and sound. Theskulls spun with her.Time twisted, much as it did in the sliph. but not in the same comforting way.This was a disorienting experience that brought sweat to her brow. It alsobrought the spirit.His glowing form was before her. yet she couldn’t recall when it had appeared toher. It was simply there.“Grandfather, “ she whispered in the tongue of the Mud People. Chandalen hadsaid that it was his grandfather who had come in the gathering. but sherecognized him on a more visceral level; he had become her protector. She feltthe connection to the bone that had been his in life.“Child.” The unearthly sound of his voice coming through the Bird Man tingledagainst her flesh. “Thank you for heeding my call. ““What does our ancestor’s spirit wish of me?”The Bird Man’s mouth moved with the spirit’s voice. “That which has been partlyentrusted to us has been violated. ““Entrusted to you? What was entrusted to you?”“The Temple of the Winds. “ Kahlan’s naked flesh prickled with goose bumps.Entrusted to the spirits? The implications made her head swim. The spirit worldwas the underworld, the world of the dead. How could something like a temple,built mostly of inert materials like stone, be sent to the underworld? “TheTemple of the Winds is in the spirit world?”“The Temple of the Winds exists partly in the world of the dead, and partly inthe world of life. It exists in both places, both worlds, at once. ““Both places, both worlds, at once? How could such a thing he possible?” Theglowing form, like a shadow made of light, lifted a hand. “Is a tree a creatureof the soil, like the worms, or is it a creature of the air, like the birds?”Kahlan would have preferred a simple answer, but she knew better than to arguewith the dead.“Honored grandfather, I guess the tree is of neither world, yet exists in both.”The spirit seemed to smile. “So if does. child. “ the spirit said through theBird Man. “As does the Temple of the Winds.”Kahlan leaned forward. “You mean, the Temple of the Winds is like the tree, withits roots in this world, and its branches in your world? It exists in both ourworlds.”“In this world, in the world of life, where is it?”“Where it always was, on the Mountain of the Four Winds. You know it as MountKymermosst. ““Mount Kymermosst,” Kahlan repeated in a flat tone. “Honored grandfather, I havebeen to that place. The Temple of the Winds is no longer I here. It’s gone. ““You must find it.”“Find it? It looks to have been there at one time, but the rock of the mountainwhere the temple used to be has collapsed. The temple is gone, except for a fewof its outbuildings. There is nothing to find. I’m sorry, honored grandfather,but in our world, the roots have died and crumbled. “ The spirit stood silently.Kahlan feared it might become angry. “Child,” the spirit said, but not throughthe Bird Man. The voice came from the spirit itself. The sound was so painful itwas almost more than she could bear. She felt as if the flesh would burn fromher bones. “Something was stolen from the winds and taken to your world. Youmust help Richard, or all my blood in your world, all our people, will die. “Kahlan swallowed. How could something be stolen from the spirit world, the worldof the dead, and be brought back to the world of the living?“Can you help me? Can you tell me anything that might help me to know how tofind the Temple of the Winds ? ““I have not called you here to tell you how to find the winds. The way of thewinds will come with the moon. I have called you here to see the extent of whathas been released, and what will become of your world should this be allowed tostand. “Grandfather’s spirit spread his arms. Soft light cascaded from them, like watercoming over a ledge. The light spread in her vision until she saw only whitelight.The light cleared, and she saw death. Corpses, like leaves littering the groundin the autumn, lay everywhere. They were strewn in the street where they fell.They sat on steps, slumped against railings. They lay in doorways and ondead-carts.Kahlan’s vision was carried through windows, as if on the wings of a bird.Bodies lay rotting in homes. She saw them in beds, in chairs, in halls,stretched out on floors, and slumped over one another. The stench gagged her.With her floating vision, Kahlan swept to towns and cities she knew, andeverywhere it was the same. Death had taken nearly everyone, their bodies blackand rotting even before they had died. The few still living, wherever sheviewed, wept in unrelieved anguish.Her floating vision returned to the Mud People’s village. She saw the corpses ofpeople she knew. Beside dead cook fires lay dead mothers holding dead childrenin their arms. Dead husbands held dead wives. Here and there, orphaned childrenwith tear-stained faces wailed hysterically beside the corpses of parents.Everywhere, the stench was so thick it made her eyes water.Kahlan gasped back a sob as she closed her eyes. It did no good. The sight ofthe dead burned through to the vision in her mind.“This, “ the spirit said. “is what will come to pass if that stolen from thewinds isn’t flailed. ““What can I do?” Kahlan whispered through the tears.“The winds have been violated. That which was entrusted was taken. The windshave decided that you are the path of the price. I have come to show you theresults of this violation and to beg you. on behalf of my living descendants, tofulfil your part, when you are asked. ““And what is the price?”“I have not been shown the price, but I forewarn you that I do know that thereis no way for you to circumvent or avoid it. It must he as it will lie revealedto you. or all will be lost. I ask that when the winds show you the path, youfake it. lest what I have shown you comes to be. “Kahlan, tears streaming down her cheeks, didn’t have to consider. “I will.grandfather.”“Thank you. child. There is one other thing I would fell you. In our world,where the souls of those departed from your world now reside, there are thoseexisting in the Light with the Creator, and those who are forever shadowed fromHis glory by the Keeper. ““You mean that there are both good and evil spirits in this?”“That is an oversimplification that nearly obscures the truth, but it is as nearas you, in your world, would be able to come to comprehending this world. Inthis, our world, ail make it what if is. The winds must allow all to mark outthe path.”“Can you tell me how the magic was stolen from the winds?”“The path was betrayal.”“Betrayal? Who did they betray?”“The Keeper.”Kahlan’s jaw dropped. She immediately thought of the Sister of the Dark who hadbeen in Aydindril: Sister Amelia. It had to be her. “The Sister of the Dark hasbetrayed her master?”“This soul’s path was to enter the Temple of the Winds through the Hall of theBetrayer. That is the only way to achieve the initial breach. It was created asa precaution. To tread the Hall of the Betrayer, a person must betray completelyand irrecoverably that in which they believe. Since they have irreparablybetrayed their cause. they would no longer have reason to enter.“The dream walker found a prophecy that could be used to defeat his foe, but toignite it, he needed magic from the winds.“The dream walker found a way to force this soul to betray her master, theKeeper, yet still carry out the dream walker’s wishes. He did this by at firstallowing her to maintain her oath to the Keeper and by relegating himself to therole of her secondary master, her master in your world alone. Then. with the useof a double bind, he forced her to betray her primary master. She was able totread Betrayer’s Hall, with her charge from the dream walker, and her obligationto if. intact. In this way. the dream walker violated the winds and obtainedwhat he wanted.“Those who sent the temple into the winds did, however, make contingency’ plans,should such a thing happen. The red moon was the ignition of these plans. “The very word “betray” had made Kahlan’s heart pound. “Is this the way we mustgain entrance to the winds?”The spirit considered her. as if weighing her soul. “Once the Temple of theWinds has been violated, that path is closed, and another must be used. But thisis not your concern: the winds will issue their requirements in conjunction withthe precepts of balance. The five spirits guarding the winds will dictate thepath accordingly.”“Honored grandfather, how can a place issue instructions? You make it seem as ifthe winds are alive. ““I no longer exist in the world of life, yet, when called, I can passinformation through the veil. “Kahlan’s head hurt from trying to understand. She wished Richard were here toask questions. She feared to miss the important one.“But, honored grandfather, you can do this because you are a spirit. You livedonce. You have a soul. “ The spirit began fading.“The boundary, the veil, was damaged by this event in the winds. I can remain nolonger. The skrin, the guardians of the boundary between worlds, pull me hack.Because the violation in the winds altered the balance, we cannot return againin a gathering unless the balance is restored. “ The spirit faded until shecould hardly see it.“Grandfather, I must know more. Is the plague itself magic?” The voice came froma great distance. “The magic sent into the winds is of vast power. To use itfully requires vast knowledge. It was used without understanding what wasreleased, or how to control it. The plague was begun by this magic, much as abolt of lightning from a wizard is magic, but if the lightning strikes a tindergrassland, the resulting firestorm is not magic. The plague is like this. It wasbegun with magic, but it is now simply a plague, as others before-random andunpredictable-yet heated by magic. ““The plague is in Aydindril, and here. Will it stay confined?”“No.”Jagang didn’t realize what he had done. This could end up killing him, too, ifallowed to burn out of control.“Is it. as you showed me, already in other places? Has it already been startedin these oilier places, too?”The light of the spirit extinguished like the weak flame of a lamp gone out.“Yes, “ came the distant, echoing whisper.They had hoped that they could confine the plague to Aydindril. That was hopelost. The whole of the Midlands, the whole of the New World, was about to beconsumed in the firestorm started by that spark of magic from the Temple of theWinds.In the center of the circle, where the spirit had been, the air swirled as thespirit vanished back into the underworld.In the distance, in the underworld, Kahlan heard the soft echo of laughter froma different spirit. The malevolent chuckle made her skin crawl.As Kahlan came out of the trance of the gathering, the elders were there,standing around her. They were more used to this altered state than she; herhead still spun sickeningly. Elder Breginderin reached down, offering her hishand to help her up.As she took his hand. under the covering of black and white mud, she saw thetokens on his legs. She gazed up into his face, at his kindly smile ofassurance. He would be dead within the day.Her friend, Savidlin, was there, holding out her clothes. Kahlan, despite themud, suddenly felt very naked. She started pulling on her clothes, trying not tobetray her embarrassment, and at the same time chiding herself for such mundaneconcerns in the face of the impending catastrophe. The gathering was aboutcalling the spirits of the dead, not about being man or woman. Still, she wasthe only one of the latter, and they were all the former.“Thank you for coming, Mother Confessor, “ the Bird Man said. “We know thishomecoming is not the one of joy we all wished. ““No, “ she whispered, “it’s not. My heart sings lo see my people again, but thesong is tempered by sadness. You know, honored elders, that Richard and I willdo what we must. We will not rest until this is stopped. ““Do you think you can stop such a thing as a fever?” Sunn asked. Savidlin placeda hand on her shoulder as she buttoned her shirt. “The Mother Confessor andRichard with the Temper have helped us before. We know their hearts. Ourancestor said that this is a fever caused by magic. The Mother Confessor and theSeeker have great magic. They will do what they must. ““Savidlin is right. We will do what we must.”Savidlin smiled at her. “And then, when you have finished, you will come home toyour people and be wedded, as you planned? My wife, Weselan. wishes to see herfriend, the Mother Confessor, wedded in the dress she made for you. “Kahlan swallowed back a cry. “There is nothing I could wish that would bring megreater joy, except to see all our people well. ““You are a great friend to all our people, child, “ the Bird Man said. “We lookforward to the wedding, when you have finished with these matters of the spiritsand magic.”Kahlan glanced at all the eyes watching her. She didn’t think these men hadwitnessed the visions of death she had been shown, or the true nature ordimensions of the epidemic they faced. They had all seen fevers come before, butnever one like the plague.“Honored elders, if we fail... if we...” Her voice faltered. The Bird Man cameto her rescue.“If you should fail, child, we know it will not be because you didn’t doeverything you could. If there is a path, we know you will do all you can tofind if. We trust in you.”“Thank you,” she murmured.Tears were watering her vision. She forced herself to hold her chin up. Shewould only frighten these people if she showed her fear.“Kahlan, you must wed Richard with the Temper.” The Bird Man chuckled softly asif trying to cheer her. “He escaped wedding a Mud Woman before, as I had plannedfor him. He will not escape wedding you, if I have any say. He must marry a MudWoman.” She felt too numb to return the smile.“Will you stay the rest of the night?” Savidlin asked. “Weselan would find joyin seeing you. ““Forgive me, honored elders, but if I am to save our people. I must return atonce. I must go to Richard and tell him what I have learned with your help. “"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44A woman stepped out of a doorway into the narrow, deserted alleyway. He had tostop, or collide with her. Under her shawl she wore a thin dress, and he couldtell by the way her nipples stood out with the cold that she wore nothingunderneath the dress.She thought his smile was for her; it wasn’t. It was amusement at the wayopportunity sometimes stepped into his path when he least expected it. Heguessed it was his extraordinary nature that drew such events to him. Expectingit or not, he was never unprepared to bend events to his advantage. She returnedthe smile as she ran her hand up his chest and with a single finger stroked thebottom of his chin. “There, there, love. Care for a bit of pleasure?”She wasn’t attractive; nonetheless, the nature of the chance opportunityinstantly ignited his need. He knew what this was about. By the way she stoodclose, commanding his attention, he knew. He had had this kind of encounterbefore. In fact, he sometimes sought it out. It was more of a challenge. Withchallenge came a rare form of fulfilment.It wasn’t an ideal situation-there were distinct disadvantages, such as notbeing able to allow her screams to bring attention, yet there were stillpleasures to be had, even like this. His senses opened to it. Already, he wastaking in the details, like dry earth took in a soaking rain. He let the lusttake him.“Well,” he said, drawing the word out, “do you have a room?” He knew shewouldn’t have one. He knew what this was about. She rested a wrist over hisshoulder. “Don’t need no room, love. Just a half silver.”Discreetly as possible, he swept his gaze over the close buildings. The windowswere all dark. Only a few lights in the distance reflected off the wet stone.This was a warehouse district; no one lived in these buildings. There weren’tlikely to be many people about, except passersby, like himself. Still, he knewhe had to temper his lust with prudence.“A little cold to be undressing out here on the cobblestones, isn’t it?” She putone hand on the side of his face to keep his attention focused on her. Her otherhand touched him between his legs. She purred with satisfaction at what shefound.“Not to worry, love. For a half silver I’ll have someplace warm for you to putit.”He was enjoying the game. It had been too long. He put on his most innocent,inexperienced expression for her.“Well, I don’t know. This seems somewhat crude to me. I usually like it bestwhen there’s time for the young lady to enjoy it, too.”“Oh, I do enjoy it, love. You don’t think I do this just for the half silver, doyou? ‘Course not. I enjoy it. It’s my pleasure.”She was backing toward the doorway she had come from. He let her fingers, curledbehind his neck. guide him with her.“I don’t carry any money that small.” He could almost see her eyes light withher luck. She had yet to learn that her luck this night was going to be bad.“You don’t?” she said, as if preparing to withdraw her offer now that shethought she had snared him with tempting thoughts of what she was offering.“Well. a lady has to earn a living. I guess I’ll have to move along and see if Ican find...”“The smallest I have is a silver. But I’d be willing to give you the wholesilver if it would mean you took your time and enjoyed it, too. I like lovelyyoung ladies like you to enjoy it. That’s what pleases me.”“What a love,” she said with clumsy, exaggerated delight as she took the silvercoin when he held it out.She stank. Her smile brought no beauty to her face, yet he revelled in thedetails: coarse hair. the smell of her body. the humped nose, and small eyes.She was common, less than a man of his stature was used to, but this had its owndelights to offer.He listened carefully as he watched her. Other details were even more important,if he was to have his full pleasure from this.She backed into the shallow doorway and sat on a stool waiting there. Thedoorway was just deep enough to hold them both, with his back to the alleyway ashe stood before her.It aggravated him that she thought him so ignorant, so foolish, so impetuous.She would learn just how wrong she was.She planted a kiss on the front of his trousers as she fumbled with his belt. Itwouldn’t be long. She wouldn’t want it to take too long. before she moved on toanother place, reaping all the coin she could in the cloak of night.Before she undid his trousers, he gently took her wrists in one hand. Itwouldn’t do to have his trousers down around his knees when it started. No, thatwouldn’t do at all.She smiled up at him, clearly puzzled, but just as clearly sure she wasbewitching him with her smile. He wouldn’t have to suffer it for long. Itwouldn’t be long.It was dark enough. Too dark to see for sure what he was doing. People saw whatthey expected.While she still smiled at him, before she had time to question, he reached downwith his other hand and gripped her neck. She thought he simply wished to holdher while she performed her service. The way her head was tilted back wasperfect. With a thumb, and a small grunt of effort, he crushed her windpipe. Thesmile transferred to his face. The choking sound wouldn’t immediately raisesuspicions. People heard what they expected to hear, just as they saw what theyexpected to see. He hunched over her, to make it look as expected, while hecrushed the life out of her.“Surprise.” he whispered to her bulging eyes. He luxuriated in her startled,strangled expression. When her arms went limp, he let them drop, and held her upby a fistful of her hair. He bent her head back over his thigh to help hold herup as he waited.He had to wait only seconds before he heard the careful footsteps approachingfrom behind. More than one man, as he had expected. He knew what this was about:robbery.Mere seconds more, and they had closed the distance. To him, time stretched withthe anticipation, with the details of sights, sounds, and smells. He was themost rare of men. He owned time. He owned life. He owned death. And now it wastime for the rest of his pleasure.He pushed his knee up against her spine and, with a quick yank, snapped her neckover his leg. He spun, bringing his knife up into the man right behind, slicinghim open from his groin to his sternum. He spun past the man as guts slopped outinto the alley.He expected another man. There were two. A woman like this usually had two mento rob the man. He had never before seen three. The unexpected danger of thisdevelopment made him reel with lust.The second man on the right swung an arm. He saw the knife in the fist, and witha step back, escaped the sweep of the blade. As the third man advanced, he drovehim back with a boot to the point at the base of the breastbone. The man smackedthe wall behind and stumbled to his knees with a grunt of pain, unable to regainhis breath.The man on the right froze. In that instant, it was one on one. The face wasthat of a boy, really. Hardly a man, yet. With a boy’s courage, he broke andran.He smiled. There was no more perfect target as they ran than a person’s head.The head remained nearly still while the arms and legs flailed furiously. Thattarget was a core of stability in his vision.He loosed his knife. The boy ran as fast as his rapidly pumping legs would carryhim. The knife was faster, hitting home with a solid thunk. The young thief wentdown instantly.The third man was coming up from his knees. He was older, muscled, heavy, andviolently angry. Good.A side kick broke the man’s nose. Howling in pain and rage, the man sprangforward. He saw a flash of steel and dodged to the side as he swept a legbeneath the man. taking his feet from under him. It all happened in a blink. Itwas a glorious event, this dangerous, raging bull charging madly.He pulled in the details: the man’s clothes, the small rip in the back of hiscoat, his bald spot reflecting the distant light, his curly, greasy hair, thenick missing out of his right ear, the way he flopped when the boot landedbetween his shoulders. .It was when he was twisting the man’s arm behind his back that he saw the blood.Blood was something he kept careful track of. This blood surprised him. Hehadn’t cut the man-yet. Nor was this blood from the man’s crushed nose. Herarely had a thrill of surprise such as this unexpected blood brought. Herealized the man was screaming in pain. He screamed louder when the shoulderjoint popped. He dropped onto the man’s back and smacked his head with the heelof a hand, breaking the loan’s teeth against the cobbles and quieting him,somewhat.He gripped the greasy hair in a fist and pulled the man’s head back, listeningto the sound of the grunts.“Robbery is a dangerous business. Time you paid the price.”“We wouldn’t have hurt you.” the man burbled. “Just robbed you. you bastard”“Bastard, is it?”Carefully, slowly, enjoying the detail of every inch. he slit open the man’sthroat as he thrashed.What unexpected pleasure this night had brought. He lifted his hands, curlinghis fingers, slowly sweeping the quintessence of death from the air. capturingthe silken substance of it as it lifted in the darkness, and pulled it back tohimself.He was the fulfilment of their lives. He was the balance. He was death. Hesavored seeing that awareness in their eyes. He liked it best when he could baskin that look. that knowledge... that terror. It brought him fulfilment. It madehim complete.He stood, swaying in ecstasy at the cloying scent of blood. He regretted ithadn’t lasted longer. He regretted not being able to enjoy prolonged screams.Screams were rapture. He craved them, needed them. lusted after them. Screamsfulfilled him, made him whole. He needed the screams, not the actual sound ofthem-he often gagged his partners-but the attempt at them, and what theyrepresented: terror.Being denied the chance to leisurely enjoy the screaming terror left himunfulfilled, his lust unsated.He glided up the alley and found that his skill was as sharp as ever. as was hisknife; it had found its target. The boy lay crumpled on his side. He lookeddelicious with the knife buried to the cross guard at the back of his head. andthe point of the heavy blade jutting from his forehead, just slightly offcenter. Immersed in a pool of sensation, he realized he felt a new one: pain.Surprised, he inspected his arm. and discovered the source of the unexpectedblood. He had a gash a good six inches long on the outside of his right forearm.It was deep. It would need to be stitched.The pleasure of such an unexpected occurrence made him gasp. Danger, death, anddamage-all in one night, in one chance encounter. This was nearly too much.The voices had been right about coming to Aydindril.Still, he hadn’t had what he needed-the prolonged terror, the careful cutting,the slicing, the binge of blood, the giving of endless, exquisite pain, the orgyof frenzied stabbing at the end.But the voices from the ethers promised him he would have those things, promisedhim he would have the ultimate conquest, the ultimate balance, the ultimatepairing. They promised him he would have the ultimate consummation ofdebauchery. They promised him he would have the Mother Confessor. His time wascoming. Her time was coming. Soon.When Verna dabbed the wet cloth against Warren’s forehead, his eyes opened. Shelet out a long breath of relief. “How are you feeling?”He tried to sit up. With a firm hand on his chest, she gently pushed him backdown into the hay. “Just you lay there and rest.” He winced in pain and thensmacked his lips. “I need a drink.”Verna twisted and lifted the dipper from the bucket. She held it to his lips.His hands cupped the dented bowl of the dipper as he greedily gulped down allthe water.He panted, catching his breath after the long drink. “More.” Verna dragged thedipper through the bucket and let him drink his fill. She smiled down at him.“Glad to see you awake.”It looked to be an effort for him to return the smile. “Glad to be awake. Howlong have I been out. this time?”She shrugged, discounting his concern. “A few hours.”He glanced around the inside of the barn. Verna lifted the lamp so he could seehis surroundings. Rain drummed against the roof, making it feel cozy inside.Verna set down the lamp and rested on an elbow beside him. “Not fancy lodging,but at least it’s dry.”He had been nearly unconscious when they found the farm. The family who ownedthe farm was sympathetic. Verna had refused the offer of their bed, not wantingto force them to sleep in their own barn.On her journey of over twenty-odd years, Verna had often slept in such places,and found the accommodations agreeable, if a little rough. She liked the smellof hay. When she was on her journey, she had thought she hated it, but oncereturned to the cloistered life at the Palace of the Prophets, she changed heropinion, and found herself longing for the smell of hay, dirt, grass, andrain-clean air.Warren laid a gentle hand over hers. “Verna, I’m sorry I’m slowing us down so.”Verna smiled. She recalled a time when her impatient nature would have had herpacing and fretting. Warren, and his love, brought out a little of her calmernature. He was good for her. He was everything to her.She pushed back his curly blond hair and kissed his forehead. “Nonsense. We hadto stop for the night anyway. The rain would have made travelling slow andmiserable. A good rest will result in more progress in the end. Take my word;I’ve had plenty of experience at such things.”“But I feel so-useless.”“You are a prophet. That provides us with information that is far from useless.That in itself has saved us from travelling days in a wrong direction.”His troubled blue eyes turned to the rafters. “The headaches are coming moreoften with time. I fear to think that when I close my eyes, I may never comeawake again.”She scowled for the first time that night. “I’ll not hear that sort of talk,Warren., We will make it.”He hesitated, not wanting to argue with her. “If you say so, Verna. But I’mslowing us down more all the time.”“I’ve taken care of that.”“You have? What have you done?”“I hired us transportation. For a ways, at least.”“Verna, you said you didn’t want to hire a coach, that it would draw attentionto us. You said you didn’t want to risk being recognized, and you didn’t wantnosy people inquiring as to who was riding a coach.”“Not a coach. And I don’t want to hear a string of objections. I hired thisfarmer to take us south for a ways in his hay cart. He said we could lay in theback and you could rest. He’ll cover us with hay so we won’t have to worry aboutpeople bothering us.”Warren frowned. “Why would he do this for us?”“I paid him well. More than that. though, he and his family are loyal to theLight. He respects the Sisters of the Light.”Warren relaxed back into the hay. “Well. I guess that sounds good. You’re surehe’s willing? You didn’t twist his nose. did you?”“He was going anyway.”“Really? Why?”Verna sighed. “He has a sick daughter. She’s only twelve. He wants to go to getsome tonic for her.”Suspicion darkened Warren’s expression. “Why didn’t you cure the girl?” Vernaheld his gaze. “I tried. I couldn’t cure her. She has a high fever, she’scramping and vomiting. I tried my best. I would have given nearly anything tohave been able to cure that poor child of her suffering, but I couldn’t.”“Any idea why not?”Verna shook her head sadly. “The gift doesn’t cure everything. Warren. You knowthat. If she had a broken bone. I could help her. If she had any number of ills.I could help her, but the gift is of limited use for fever.”Warren looked away. “Seems unfair. They offer to help us. and we can do next tonothing for them.”“I know.” Verna whispered. She listened to the rain against the roof for a time.“I was able to ease the pain in her gut. at least. She’ll rest a little morecomfortably.”“Good. That’s good. at least.” Warren fussed with a piece of straw. “Have youbeen able to get in contact with Prelate Annalina? Has she left you a message inthe journey book yet?”Verna tried not to betray how troubled she was. “No. She hasn’t answered mymessages, nor has she sent one of her own. She’s probably busy. She doesn’t needto be bothered by our little problems. We’ll hear from her when she has time.”Warren nodded. Verna blew out the lamp. She snuggled up to him. putting herforehead against his shoulder. She rested her arm across his chest. “We best getsome sleep. At sunrise we’ll be moving on.”“I love you. Verna. If I die in my sleep, I want you to know that.” Verna’sfingers stroked the side of his face in answer.Clarissa rubbed the sleep from her eyes. Dawn was leaking in around the edges ofthe heavy, dark green drapes. She sat up in the bed. She didn’t think she hadever awakened feeling this good. She reached over to tell Nathan as much. Nathanwasn’t with her.Clarissa sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. When she stretched,her leg muscles protested: they were sore from the night’s activities. Sheguessed it was simply the thought of the cause that made her smile at the mildache. She had never known that sore muscles could be so pleasant.She stuffed her arms through the lovely pink robe Nathan had bought for her. Shesnugged the ruffles up around her neck and then tied the silk belt. She wiggledher toes in the thick carpet, luxuriating in the feeling.Nathan was at the writing desk, bent over a letter. He smiled up at her as shestood in the doorway. “Sleep well?”Clarissa half-closed her eyes and sighed. “I should say so.” She grinned. “Whatsleep I got, anyway.”Nathan linked at her. He dipped the pen in a bottle of blue ink and went back tohis scratching. Clarissa strolled around behind him and put her hands on hisshoulders. He was wearing his trousers, and nothing else. With her thumbs shekneaded the muscles at the base of his neck. He made an agreeable sound deep inhis throat, so she continued. She liked to hear his sounds of pleasure, andliked even more being their cause.As her thumbs worked along the muscles of his shoulders, she glanced down atwhat he was writing. Scanning the letter, she saw that it was instructions aboutmoving troops to places she had never heard of. Nathan wrote on, admonishing ageneral about the bond to the Lord Rahl, and the dire repercussion should heignore it. The tone of the letter was the same authoritative tone he used whenhe expected people to treat him as the man of importance that he was. He signedthe letter: “Lord Rahl.”Clarissa bent and nuzzled his neck, giving his ear a little nip. “Nathan, lastnight was beyond wonderful. It was magic. You were magnificent. I’m the luckiestwoman in the world.”He gave her a roguish grin. “Magic. Yes, there was some of that in it, too. I’man old man; I need to use what I’ve got.”She combed her fingers through his hair, ordering it. “Old man? I don’t thinkso, Nathan. I hope I was half as pleasing to you as you were to me.”He laughed as he folded his letter. “I guess I did manage to keep up with you.”He slipped a hand inside her robe and pinched her bare bottom. She jumped with asqueak. “It was one of the high points of my life, to be with such a beautifuland loving woman.”She hugged his head to her breasts. “Well, we’re still alive. No reason we can’treach for some more of those high points.”His sly smile grew as he put his hand back on her bare bottom and gave it asqueeze. He had that lusty twinkle in his eye.“Let me dispense with this bit of business, and we’ll see about getting ourmoney’s worth out of that big bed.”With a diminutive copper spoon, he scooped little nuggets of red wax from a tinand dumped the tiny spoonful on the folded letter. ;”Nathan, silly, you’resupposed to melt the sealing wax onto the letter.”One of his eyebrows arched. “You should know by now, my dear, that my way isbetter.”She let out a throaty laugh. “My mistake.” He twirled a finger over the nuggetsof wax. Sparkles of light danced from his finger onto the lumps of wax. Theyglowed briefly and then melted into a red puddle on the letter. She gasped withdelight. Nathan was one never-ending little surprise after another. She felt hercheeks warm as she remembered that his fingers were magic in more ways than one.She bent and whispered intimately in his ear. “I’d like you and that magicfinger of yours back in bed with me, Lord Rahl.”Nathan lifted his magic finger in proclamation. “And it shall be, my dear, justas soon as I send this letter on its way.”He again twirled the finger over the letter, and it lifted off the desk as if ofits own accord. Clarissa’s eyebrows rose in astonishment. The letter floated inthe air ahead of him as he walked to the door. He twirled his other handdramatically, and the door glided open.A soldier, sitting on the floor in the hall, leaning against the opposite wall,rose to his feet. He saluted with a fist to his heart.Nathan, standing there in only his trousers, with his white hair hanging down tohis shoulders, had the look of a wild man. She knew he wasn’t, but standingthere, as tall as he was, as commanding as he was, she knew he must look thatway to others.People were afraid of Nathan. She could see it in their eyes. She couldunderstand their fear, though; she remembered how much she had feared him,before she had come to know him. She could hardly remember, now, just how muchthe sight of the towering prophet had terrified her.When he turned those azure eyes on people, and his hawklike brow lowered indispleasure, she thought he could make a whole army turn and run.Nathan stretched his arm out, and the letter floated to the grim-faced soldier.“You remember all my instructions, don’t you, Walsh?”The soldier snatched the letter out of the air and stuffed it inside his tunic.This soldier, though respectful, didn’t seem intimidated by Nathan. “Of course.You know me better than that, Nathan.”Nathan lost a bit of his lofty attitude and scratched his head. “I guess I do.”Clarissa wondered where Nathan had found the soldier, and when he had had timeto give him instructions. She guessed he must have gone out while she wasasleep.This soldier looked to be somewhat different from most of the others she hadseen. He had a travelling cloak, with leather packs at his belt, and his clotheswere of a higher quality than those of the regular soldiers she was getting usedto seeing. His sword was shorter, too. and his knife longer. He was not a smallman, either. He was as big as Nathan, but Nathan’s bearing made him seem biggerthan anyone to her.“Give the letter to General Reibisch,” Nathan said. “And don’t forget, if any ofthose Sisters start asking you questions, you warn them about what I said, andtell them that Lord Rahl ordered you to keep what you were told to yourself.That will keep their jaws locked tight.”The soldier smiled knowingly. “I understand... Lord Rahl.” Nathan nodded. “Good.What about the others?”Soldier Walsh gestured vaguely. “Bollesdun will be around to let you know whathe finds out. I’m pretty sure it was only Jagang’s expeditionary force, butBollesdun will find out for sure. Large as it was. it wasn’t much compared tothe main force. I don’t see any evidence that his main force down near GrafanHarbor has come north yet.“From what I’ve heard, Jagang is content to sit and wait for something. I don’tknow what that something is, but he’s not rushing troops north, into the NewWorld.”“He thrust the army I saw deep into the New World.”“I still think it was just his expeditionary force. Jagang is a patient man. Ittook him years to conquer and consolidate the Old World under his rule. He usedmuch the same tactics: sending out the expeditionary force to take a key city,or capture information of one sort or another, mostly records and books. Thosemen are brutal, that’s part of their purpose, too, but it’s the books they’resent to get.“They would send back whatever they captured, and wait to go wherever Jagangsends them next. Bollesdun has some of our men checking into it, but they haveto be careful, and it may take them awhile, so just enjoy the wait.”Nathan stroked his chin as he pondered. “Yes, I imagine Jagang isn’t eager tosend his army into the New World, yet.” He returned his gaze to Walsh. “You’dbest be on your way.”Walsh nodded. His gaze shifted and his eyes met Clarissa’s. He looked back toNathan, a small smile coming to his lips. “A man after my own heart.”Nathan chuckled softly. “One of nature’s wonders, matters of the heart.” The wayNathan said the words made Clarissa’s own heart swell with pride to be includedin matters of his heart.“You be careful, here in the rat’s nest, eh, Nathan? I’d not like to hear thatyou don’t have eyes in the back of your head, after all.” He patted his tunicwhere he had put the letter. “Especially not after I deliver this.”“I will, lad. You just be sure you get that letter delivered.”“You have my word.”After Nathan shut the door, and business was finished, he turned to her. He hadthat twinkle in his eye. That lusty twinkle. His sly smile returned. “Alone atlast, my dear.” Clarissa squealed and ran for the bed in mock fright."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45What do you think is going on?” Ann asked.Zedd stretched his head up to try to see. It was hard to get much of a look pastthe wall of legs around them. The Nangtong spirit hunters jabbered orders, whichhe couldn’t understand, but some of the spears pointing down from the circlesurrounding them settled on his shoulders, delivering an unequivocal messagethat he had better stay where he was.He and Ann sat cross-legged on the ground, guarded by a ring of Nangtong, whileothers of them were sitting in conference a ways off with a party of Si Doak.“They’re too far away to hear clearly, but even if we could hear them. itprobably wouldn’t help much. I only speak a few words of Si Doak.”Ann plucked a long blade of grass and wound it around a finger. She didn’tglance over at Zedd. They didn’t want to give their captors the idea that theywere sane and capable of plotting.Ann let out a high-pitched cackle, just to keep up appearances. “What do youknow about these Si Doak?”Zedd flapped his arms like a bird about to take to wing. “I know they don’tsacrifice people.”A guard thunked a spear shaft on Zedd’s head. as if to discourage him from anyideas of flying off. Zedd howled with laughter, instead of cursing, which he waslonging to do.Ann glanced over out of the corner of her eye. “Beginning to reconsider yourattitude about letting these Nangtong live as they wish?”Zedd smiled. “If I wanted to let them live as they wish. we’d be in the spiritworld by now. Just because you believe in letting wolves be. that doesn’t meanyou have to let them eat your flock at will.” She grunted to concede the point.Off in the distance, beside a slight rise. the negotiations dragged on. Aboutten of the Nangtong and an equal number of the Si Doak sat cross-legged in acircle. The Nangtong counted out loud. accompanied by exaggerated arm movements.They pointed Zedd’s way. They made unintelligible but seemingly heartfeltspeeches.Zedd leaned toward Ann and whispered, “The Si Doak are peaceful enough, as faras I know; I’ve never heard of them making war or using force against neighbors.even weaker neighbors, but when it comes to matters of trade, they’re ruthless.Most people in this part of the wilds would just as soon bargain with a wolf.Other peoples teach their young people to fight: the Si Doak teach them tobarter.”Ann looked off in the other direction, as if disinterested. “What makes them sogood at it?”Zedd glanced up at their guards. They were all watching the bargaining, andpaying little attention to the helpless prisoners.“They have the rare ability to walk away from a deal. Others get their mind seton something and soon start settling for less, just to have a deal. The Si Doakwon’t do that. They’ll simply walk. When need be, they’ll cut their losseswithout regret and move on to something else.”One of the Si Doak, the one wearing a rabbit fur over his head, slapped a pileof blankets in the center of the circle. He pointed off to a small heard ofgoats and made an offer Zedd understood to include two of the animals.The offer seemed to incense the Nangtong. Their chief negotiator leaped to hisfeet and stabbed his spear at the sky repeatedly, apparently to express hisoutrage at the low price. Zedd noted that he didn’t walk away. There was honorinvolved; the Nangtong had that much invested.Zedd nudged Ann. He tilled his head back and howled like a coyote. Ann, gettingthe message, joined in. They both yelped and bayed as loud as they could.The negotiators fell silent as they all looked toward the prisoners. The headNangtong negotiator sat back down.A thunk on both their heads silenced Zedd and Ann. Talking resumed over at thebartering session. A Nangtong emissary was sent to have a better look at thegoats.Zedd scratched his shoulder. The dry mud was getting uncomfortable. He guessedit was less uncomfortable than having his heart cut out, or his head cut off, orwhatever it was the Nangtong did to sacrifices.“I’m hungry,” he muttered. ‘They haven’t fed us all day. It’s near tomid-afternoon, and they haven’t fed us.”He barked at his captors to show his displeasure. The negotiations halted for amoment while they once again looked toward the prisoners. The Si Doak all foldedtheir arms and remained silent as they stared at the Nangtong.The Nangtong quickly resumed talking, their tone changing, becomingconciliatory. Chuckling interspersed their casual chatter. The Si Doaks’response was short and curt. The one with the rabbit skin on his head gesturedtoward the afternoon sun and then off toward his home.The Nangtong man in charge pulled a blanket from the stack in the center andinspected it with grudging admiration. He passed the blanket to his fellows.They nodded with appreciation of its worth, as if just discovering it. The mansent to have a look at the goats returned with two. He showed them off to hisassociates, and they oohed and aahed, as if realizing for the first time thatthese goats were much more impressive than they had at first thought, and not atall the scraggly animals they had expected lo find.The Nangtong had apparently decided that, no matter what, they didn’t want toreturn home with the prisoners. Any useful commodities were better than twocrazy people. They couldn’t very well send the spirits two crazy people. Anyexchange for them was better than nothing, especially in view of the waninginterest of the Si Doak.The Si Doak remained stone-faced. The Nangtong had made a mistake; they hadbetrayed their need to sell what they had. There was nothing the Si Doak valuedmore than a motivated seller.A price, whatever it was Zedd couldn’t tell, was suddenly agreed upon. The headSi Doak and the head Nangtong stood, hooked arms at the elbows, and turnedaround each other three times while so locked together. When they parted, bothsides fell to happy chatter. A bargain had been struck.The Nangtong started lifting blankets. The goats were tethered. The Si Doakheaded for their prizes. The guards thunked Zedd and Ann on the head as the SiDoak approached, apparently in warning not to spoil the deal.Zedd had no intention of spoiling the deal. The Si Doak didn’t sacrifice people.As far as he knew. they were gentle people: the worst punishment they dispensedto someone who committed a grievous wrong was banishment. A banished Si Doaksometimes starved to death because he was so heartsick at being sent from theonly home he knew. A misbehaving child was set straight by everyone ignoring himfor a day. It was a horrifying punishment to a Si Doak child, and resulted inbest behavior for a good long time after.Of course. Zedd and Ann weren’t members of the Si Doak community, so it wasentirely possible, in fact probable, that such treatment didn’t extend to them.Zedd leaned toward Ann and whispered. “I don’t think these people would hurt us.so keep that in mind. If they decide not to take us. the Nangtong may just slitour throats rather than have to suffer the humiliation of having to return withtwo crazy people.”“First you want me to play in the mud and now you want me to be a good littlegirl?”Zedd smiled at her sarcasm. “Just until our new keepers take us away from theold.” The Si Doak elder, the one with the rabbit fur over his head. squattedbefore his new acquisitions. He reached out and felt Zedd’s arm muscles. Hegrunted disapprovingly. He felt Ann’s arms and made a sound as if pleased atwhat he found.Ann lifted an eyebrow to Zedd. “Seems I’m more agreeable to them than a skinnyold man.”Zedd smiled. “I think they find you better suited as a human oxen. They’ll giveyou the hard work.”Her satisfied expression vanished. “What do you mean?” He shushed her. AnotherSi Doak squatted down beside the elder. He had goat antlers fixed to his head.He wore what had to be a hundred necklaces over his buckskin tunic. Thenecklaces, some hanging to his crotch, others tight at his throat, and the restevery length in between, held teeth, beads, bones, feathers, pottery shards,metal disks, gold coins, small leather pouches, and carved amulets. He was theSi Doak shaman.The shaman took Zedd’s hand and gently held his arm out. He released it. Zeddlet it drop. The shaman chattered his disapproval. Zedd understood enough togather that he was supposed to hold his arm up. He didn’t let on that heunderstood any of the words, and instead let the shaman lift the arm out again,and use a hand signal to indicate he meant Zedd to hold it there.While the Nangtong guards still held spears on the two prisoners, the shamanretrieved long, coiled stalks of grass from one of the pouches at his waist. Hechanted as he wove the grass around Zedd’s wrist. When finished, he wove thegrass around Zedd’s other wrist, and then did the same to Ann. “Any idea whatthis is about?” she asked.“It binds our magic. The Nangtong need do nothing to render our magic useless,but the Si Doak have to use some kind of magic of their own to suppress ours.This shaman is a man of magic. He has the gift. He’s something like the SiDoaks’ wizard.” Zedd glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. “Or maybe youcould say he’s like the Sisters of the Light, with their collars. Like thecollars, we won’t be able to get these wristbands off.”Once they had the grass woven around their wrists, the Nangtong withdrew theirweapons, picked up their portion of the blankets, collected their two goats, andquickly made good their escape.The elder, the one with the rabbit skin on his head, leaned toward Zedd andspoke. When Zedd frowned and shrugged that he didn’t understand, the man addedsign language seemingly invented on the spot. He indicated chores to be done,and time, by showing the seasons: digging at the ground and pretending to plant,the heat of summer, and the freezing of winter. Zedd couldn’t understand a greatdeal of it, but he understood enough.He turned to Ann. “I believe that these fellows here have purchased us out ofour death sentence. We are to be in servitude to them for a period of about twoyears, to repay them for our cost, plus a profit for their trouble.”“We’ve been sold into slavery?”“It would appear so. But only for a couple of years. Quite generous of them,actually, considering that the Nangtong were going to kill us.”“Maybe we could buy our way out.”‘To the Si Doak, this is a personal debt we owe them, and can only be repaidwith personal servitude. To their way of looking at it, they have returned ourlives to us, and so we must use part of those lives to show our gratitude. Andto clean up after them.”“Clean up? We’re to scrub floors to repay our debt?”“I imagine they’ll want us to cook, carry things, sew, care for their animals,those sorts of things.”As if to confirm what Zedd had told her, the Si Doak began pulling the thongsholding their waterskins off over their heads and passing them to Zedd and Ann.“What do they want?” Ann asked him. Zedd lifted an eyebrow. “They want us tocarry their water.” Three more of the Si Doak appeared with the remainingblankets, divided them, and handed them to their new bearers.“Do you mean to tell me,” Ann growled, “that the First Wizard of the Midlandsand the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light have been sold into slavery for theprice of some blankets and two goats!”With a shove from behind, Zedd staggered after the departing Si Doak. “I knowwhat you mean,” he said over his shoulder. “For the first time I know of, the SiDoak have overpaid.”Zedd stumbled and dropped half his load of waterskins. As he regained hisbalance, he stepped on one that had snagged a thorny berry bush. Bending toretrieve the waterskins, his stack of blankets toppled into the mud puddlecreated by the burst waterskin. He put a knee to the ground to regain hisbalance as he gathered up the scattered waterskins. His knee squashed theberries under the blanket. “Oops.” He waved an apology to the Si Doak. “Sorry.”The Si Doak leaped about in agitation, demanding he pick everything up at once.The man whose waterskin Zedd had ripped open over a thorn bush pointed angrilyat his damaged property while jabbering demands of recompense.“I said I was sorry,” Zedd protested, even though they couldn’t understand him.He bent to gather up the wet blankets. He lifted one up high and held it outbetween his widespread arms. inspecting it. “Oh dear. Look at that. We’ll neverget that stain out.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46Lord Rahl. you have had a hard ride.” Berdine said. “I think you should beresting. We should go back. So you can rest. I mean.”The massive rampart, lit by the mellow light of the low sun. spread out beforethe three of them like a broad road. He wanted to be out of the Keep beforedark. Not that the light of day would save him from dangerous magic, but somehowbeing in the Wizard’s Keep after dark seemed worse. Raina leaned past him tospeak. “It was your idea. Berdine.”“My idea? I never suggested any such thing!”“Quiet, both of you.” Richard murmured.He was considering the feel of magic against his skin. They had advanced halfwayacross the long rampart toward the First Wizard’s private enclave before thedistinct caress of magic began tingling against his flesh. Both Mord-Sith hadbalked at its feel.Kahlan had told him about this place, about the First Wizard’s private enclave.She said that she used to come up to this rampart because it provided abeautiful view of Aydindril, and indeed there was that, but there was also themagic of powerful shields. Those shields kept everyone out of this small cornerof the Wizard’s Keep.Kahlan had told him that in her life there had never been a wizard with enoughpower to pass these shields. Wizards had tried, but failed. The wizards livingand working in the Keep as Kahlan was growing up simply didn’t have the magicrequired to enter this part of it. Zedd was the First Wizard: no one had been inthe First Wizard’s enclave since before Kahlan and Richard were born. when Zeddhad left the Midlands.Kahlan had said that these shields exerted more magic as you got closer, thatthey made your hair stand on end and made it difficult to breathe. She had alsosaid that if a person didn’t have enough magic of their own. just getting tooclose to the shields could be deadly. Richard didn’t discount in the slightestwhat she had said. but he had need to go in there.Kahlan had also said that to enter required placing your hand on the cold metalplate beside the door. something no wizard she knew had ever been able to do.Richard had encountered shields like this one at the Palace of the Prophets,ones passed by touching a metal plate, but as far as he knew none of those werepotentially deadly. He had been able to pass those shields, and he had been ableto pass others in the Keep that required magic only he possessed, so he reasonedthat he might be able to pass this one. He needed to get in there.Berdine rubbed her arms. distressed by the tingle of the magic. “Are you sureyou aren’t tired? You rode all that way.”“It wasn’t that hard a ride,” Richard said. “I’m not tired.” He was too worriedto rest. He had thought Kahlan would be back by now. He had been sure he wouldfind her back home when he returned from Mount Kymer-mosst. She should have beenback by now. But she wasn’t. He would wait only until morning.“I still don’t think we should be doing this,” Berdine muttered. “How is yourfoot? I don’t think you should be on it.”Richard finally looked down at her. She was pressed up against his left side.Raina was pressed to his right. Each held her Agiel in her fist.“My foot is just fine, thank you.” He shifted his body to force them away a bitto give himself breathing room. “I only need one of you. No loss of face if youwish to remain here. Raina can go, if you don’t want to.”Berdine scowled up at him. “I didn’t say I wasn’t going. I said you shouldn’t bedoing it.”“I have to. It wasn’t anywhere else. It has to be here. I was told thatimportant things, things not meant to be seen by just anyone, were kept in theFirst Wizard’s enclave.”Berdine rolled her shoulders, easing the tension in her muscles. “If you insiston going, then I’m going, too. I’ll not let you walk in there without me.”“Raina?” he asked. “I don’t need both of you. Do you want to wait here?” Rainagave him a dark, Mord-Sith glare in answer.“All right, then. Now, listen to me. I know that the shields here are dangerous,but that’s all I know about them. They may not be like the others I’ve taken youthrough.I have to touch that metal plate down there on the wall. I want you two to waithere while I go see if I have the proper magic to open the door. If it opens,then you both can come the rest of the way.”“This isn’t a trick, is it?” Raina asked. “You tricked us one other time to keepus out, to keep us from going where there was danger. Mord-Sith are not afraidof danger.”The wind lifted his gold cloak. “No, Raina, it’s not a trick. This is important,but I don’t want either of you risking your lives needlessly. If I can open thedoor, then I promise to take you both with me. Satisfied?”Both women nodded. Richard gave them each an appreciative squeeze on theshoulder. He absently adjusted the metal bands on his wrists as he gazed at thetowering bastion waiting at the end of the rampart.A cold wind buffeted him as he started across. He could feel the pressure of theshield, like the weight of water when you swam toward the bottom of a pond. Thefine hairs at the back of his neck stiffened as he progressed. The pressure madeit difficult but not impossible to draw a breath, as Kahlan had said she hadexperienced.Six immense columns of variegated red stone stood to each side of the gold-claddoor, holding up a protruding entablature of dark stone. The architrave wasdecorated with brass plaques. As Richard approached it, he recognized some oftheir symbols as the same ones on his wristbands, belt, and boot pins. Thefrieze held round metal disks with other of the more circular symbols. The morelinear of symbols he wore were also carved into the stone of the cornice.Seeing the symbols he recognized reassured him, even though he didn’t know theirmeaning. He wore these things by obligation, duty, and right-he was born tothem, that much he knew. Why, he didn’t know. Even if he wished it could beotherwise, it wasn’t; he was a war wizard.Distracted by the uncomfortable pressure and tingling of the shields, he reachedthe door almost before he realized it. The door was at least twelve feet tall,and a good four feet wide, gold-clad and embellished in the same symbolicmotifs.Embossed in the center was the more prominent of the symbols he wore: two roughtriangles, with a sinuous double line running around and through them. Richardrested his left hand on the hilt of his sword as he fingered the symbol with hisother hand, tracing its oval, undulating outer margin.With the act of touching it, tracing it, following its pattern, he understood.The spirits who had used the Sword of Truth before him passed their knowledge onto him as he used the sword, but they didn’t always convey that knowledge inwords; in the heat of combat there wasn’t always time. Sometimes it came to himin images, symbols: these symbols. This one on the door, like the ones on hiswristbands, was a kind of dance used for fighting when outnumbered. It conveyeda sense of the movements of the dance, movements without form. The dance withdeath.It made sense. He wore the outfit of a war wizard. Richard had learned fromKolo’s journal that in Kolo’s time the First Wizard, named Baraccus, had alsobeen a war wizard, as was Richard. These symbols had meaning to a war wizard.Much as a tailor painted shears on his window, or a tavern sign had a mug on it,or a blacksmith nailed up horseshoes, or a weapons maker displayed knives, thesesymbols were signs of his craft: bringing death.Richard realized that his fear had vanished. He stood in the Wizard’s Keep,which had always before set his nerves on edge and worse, stood now before themost restricted and protected place in the Keep, yet he felt calm. He touched astarburst symbol on the door. This symbol was an admonition. Keep your visionall-inclusive, never allowing it to lock on any one thing. That was the meaningof the starburst symbol: look everywhere at once, see nothing to the exclusionof all else-don’t allow the enemy to direct your vision, or you will see what hewishes you to see. He will then come at you as you become bewildered, lookingfor his attack, and you will lose.Instead, your vision must open to all there is, never settling, even whencutting. Know your enemy’s moves by instinct, not by waiting to see them. Todance with death meant to know the enemy’s sword and its speed without waitingto see it. Dancing with death meant being one with the enemy, without lookingfixedly, so that you could kill him. Dancing with death meant being committed tokilling, committed with your heart and soul. Dancing with death meant that youwere the incarnation of death, come to reap the living. Berdine’s voice driftedacross the rampart. “Lord Rahl?” Richard looked over his shoulder. “What? What’swrong?” Berdine shifted her weight to her other foot. “Well, are you all right?You’ve been standing there for a long time, staring at the door. Are you allright?”Richard wiped a hand across his face. “Yes. I’m fine. I was just... just lookingat the things written on the door, that’s all.”He turned, and without thinking, slapped his hand to the cold metal plate in thepolished grey granite wall. Kahlan had told him it was said that to touch thatmetal plate was like touching the cold, dead heart of the Keeper himself. Themetal plate warmed. The gold door silently swung inward. Dim light came frombeyond. Richard took a careful step into the doorway. Like a wick on a lampbeing slowly turned up, the dim light coming from inside brightened. He tookanother step, and the light brightened more.He scanned the inside as he motioned the two waiting Mord-Sith forward. Whatevermagic prevented people from approaching apparently was now withdrawn; Berdineand Raina walked to him without any difficulty. “That wasn’t so bad,” Rainasaid. “I didn’t feel anything.”“So far, so good,” Richard said.Inside, there were glass spheres, about a hand-width in diameter, set atop greenmarble pedestals against the wall to his left and right. Richard had seen glassspheres similar to these before, down in the lower reaches of the Keep. Likethose, these too provided light.The inside of the First Wizard’s enclave was an immense cavern of ornatestonework. Four columns of polished black marble, at least ten feet in diameter,formed a square that supported arches just beyond the outer edges of a centraldome dotted by a high ring of windows. Between each pair of columns a wing ranoff from the vast central chamber. He noticed that much of the stoneworkrepeated the palm-leaf pattern that adorned the gold capitals atop the blackmarble columns. The polish of the marble was so high that it reflected imageslike glass.Finely worked wrought-iron sconces decorated with the same palm-leaf patternheld candles. Fluidly worked iron formed railings at the edge of the expansive,sunken central floor.This was not the sinister lair Richard expected. This was a place of grandsplendor to match any he had seen. The place was so beautiful that it left himawestricken.The wing in which the three of them stood, the entry hall, appeared to be by farthe smallest of the four wings. Six-foot-tall white marble pedestals marched ina long double row beside the walkway laid with a long red carpet over agold-flecked dark brown marble floor.Richard wouldn’t have been able to touch fingers were he to put his arms aroundone of the pedestals. The ribbed, barrel ceiling thirty feet overhead made thefat pedestals look miniscule.Sitting atop some of the pedestals were objects Richard recognized: ornateknives, gems set in brooches or at the ends of gold-worked chains, a silverchalice, filigree bowls, and delicately worked boxes. Some sat on squares ofcloth trimmed with gold or silver embroidery, others on stands carved fromburied wood.Other pedestals held contorted objects that made no sense to him. He would havesworn that they changed shape when he looked at them. He decided it would bebest not to look directly at such things of magic, and warned the other two.The distant wing opposite them, across the central area under the huge dome,ended at a round-topped window that had to be thirty feet tall. Before thewindow was a huge table piled with a clutter of objects: glass jars, bowls, andcoiled tubes; a massive but simple iron candelabrum covered with ages of wax;stacks of scrolls; several human skulls; and a chaos of smaller items Richardcouldn’t make out from such a distance. The floor all around the table wassimilarly cluttered, along with things stacked up and leaning against the table.The wing to the right was dark. Richard felt uncomfortable even looking in thatdirection. He heeded the warning, and looked to the left. In that wing, he sawbooks. Thousands of them.“There,” Richard said, as he gestured to the left. “That’s what we’re here for.Remember what I told you. Don’t touch anything.” He glanced at them both as theylooked about with wide eyes. “I mean it. I don’t know how to save you if you getin trouble touching something in here.” Both pairs of eyes looked back at him.“We remember,” Berdine said.“We know better than to tempt magic,” Raina said. “We’ re just looking around,that’s all. We wouldn’t touch anything.”“Good. But I suggest that you don’t even look at anything, either, except whatwe need to look at. For all I know, simply looking at something in here couldtrigger its magic.”“Do you think?” Raina asked in astonishment.“What I think is that I’d rather not find out after it’s too late. Come on.Let’s get this over with so we can get out of here.”Oddly, even though he had said the words, and knew they made sense, he didn’treally feel like leaving. As potentially dangerous as he knew the place to be,he found that he liked the First Wizard’s enclave. Berdine smirked. “Lord Rahlfears magic as much as we do.”“You’re wrong, Berdine. I know a little about magic.” He started down the redcarpet. “I fear it more.”Ten broad steps at the end led down into the central area. An expanse ofcream-colored marble covered the floor. A border of darker brown marble ranaround the floor near the edge. When Richard reached the bottom step and hisfoot touched the floor, it hummed and began to glow. He quickly retreated backup onto the red carpet. The glow extinguished. “What now?” Raina asked.He pried her fingers from his arm. “Did either of you put your foot to thefloor?” They both shook their heads. “Try.”As Richard waited on the step, Berdine gingerly tried to test the marble. Shewithdrew her foot.“I can’t. Something stops my foot before I can get it on the floor.” Richardstepped out onto the marble again. Again it glowed and hummed. “It must be ashield, then. Here, take my hand and try again.” Holding Richard’s hand, Berdinewas able to step onto the marble with him. Raina took his other hand andfollowed.“All right,” he said, “since it’s some kind of shield, don’t let go of my handwhile we’re on this part. We don’t know what would happen. For all I know, ifyou let go of my hand you could fry like bacon on a griddle.”Their grips on his hands tightened. As they stepped onto the steps up to thewing with the books, the floor went silent. Without Richard to hold their handson the way out, they would be trapped inside this place, unable to return acrossthe central floor. The wing with the books wasn’t the kind of library he hadexpected. There were rows of shelves, but they were in disarray, with booksstacked every which way. Chunks of rock served as bookends for the few standingupright among the disorder. Here and there books were in piles, as if someonehad pulled them from the shelves and simply tossed them in a heap. Most wereclosed, but a significant number lay open. some face-up, some facedown. But thatwasn’t the biggest surprise. Everywhere, it seemed, there were books stacked upon the floor. A few stacks were short, maybe three or four feet tall, but manymore were tall pillars of books. Some of the irregular stacks lowered twelve orfourteen feet. They looked as if the mere act of breathing could make themtopple. The columns of books were everywhere, creating a maze. Richard couldn’tfathom the reason for the books being stacked in such disarray, but the mysteryof it made him sweat.Richard took an arm of each woman. “My grandfather told me that there were booksin the Keep that were extremely dangerous. Kahlan told me that the mostdangerous things were kept in here, where no one could get to them, not even thewizards she knew.”Berdine shot him a look. “You mean, you think that the books themselves could bedangerous? Not just the information in them, but the actual books?”Richard thought of the description of a book that Sister Amelia had used tostart the plague. “I’m not sure, but we had better treat them as such. Look, butdon’t touch.”Berdine’s brow drew down with a dubious frown. “Lord Rahl, there must bethousands of books I can see just standing here. There are bound to be more downthe aisles. It will take us weeks to find the one we want-if it’s even here.”Richard took a deep breath. Berdine was right. He hadn’t expected to find somany books in here. He thought the libraries held most of the books, and therewould only be a few in here.“If you want to be out of here before dark, we don’t have long,” Raina said. “Wemight as well come back tomorrow and get an early start.”Richard was beginning to feel intimidated by the task ahead. “We’ll just have tostay after dark. We’ll stay all night if we have to.” Raina rolled her Agiel inher fingers. “If you say so. Lord Rahl.” Richard’s heart sank as he stoodstaring at the forest of books. He needed information, not a search for one leafin a forest. If only he could use magic to find that one leaf.He idly adjusted the bands at his wrist. Under his fingers he felt the starburstpattern on one of them. Look without fixing your sight.“I have an idea,” he said. “Wait here. I’ll be right back.” Richard returned tothe pillars. He went to one that held a crackled-glass bowl upon a large squareof black cloth.“What good is that going to do?” Raina asked, when he came back holding thecloth out for them.“There’s too much to see. I’m going to use this as a blindfold, so I won’t seeall the things I don’t want to see.”Berdine’s face twisted with incredulity. “If you’re blindfolded, then how areyou going to see the thing we’re looking for?”“With magic. I’m going to try to let my gift guide me. Sometimes it works thatway-through need. All these books are too confusing. If I’m blindfolded, I won’tsee them, and I’ll be able to feel the one I’m looking for. At least, that’swhat I hope.”Raina gazed out over all the books. “Well, you are the Lord Rahl. You havemagic. If it has a chance of getting us out of spending the night in here, thenI say do it.”Richard placed the black cloth over his eyes and began tying its tails behindhis head. “Just guide me and keep me from touching anything. Don’t forget what Isaid about you two not touching anything, either.”“Don’t worry about us. Lord Rahl.” Raina said. “We’re not about to touchanything.” When he finished tying the blindfold over his eyes, Richard turnedhis head this way and that. testing to make sure that he couldn’t see. He rubbeda finger over the starburst on his wristband.His world was pitch-black. He sought the inner peace, the inner calm. wheredwelled his gift.If the plague was started by magic from the Temple of the Winds, then maybe theyhad a chance to halt it. If he did nothing, then untold thousands of people weregoing to die. He needed that book.He thought about the boy he had watched die. About the little girl. Lily. whotold him about the Sister of the Dark showing her the book. That was how theplague started. He knew it was.That precious child had the tokens on her. Richard hadn’t inquired, but he knewthat she. at least, would be dead by now. He couldn’t bear to inquire. He neededthat book.He put a foot out. “Nudge me with your fingers if I’m about to run intoanything. Try not to talk, but if you must, don’t be afraid to speak up.”He felt their fingers lightly touch his arm as he stepped forward. They guidedhim with that touch, keeping him from colliding with the towering stacks ofbooks as he waded deeper into the maze.Richard didn’t know what it was he should feel. He didn’t know if it was magic.a hunch, or his imagination guiding him. By the way he seemed to he winding upand down aisles and snaking through the stacks, he feared it was no more thanhis imagination. He tried to ignore the things that kept his thoughts skippingabout and running in every direction.He tried to concentrate on the book and his need to find it. Thinking of thesick children, he was able to focus better. They needed him. They were helpless.Richard felt himself jerk to a halt. He wondered why. He turned left when heexpected that he was going to turn right. It had to be the gift. With thatthought, his thoughts scattered in every direction again. He focused once more.The two Mord-Sith forcibly snatched his arm to halt him. He understood. Anotherstep, and he would have collided with a stack.Wondering which way he would be turned, he found himself squatting instead. Hisarm lifted and he reached out.“Careful,” Berdine whispered. “Its a big. irregular stack. Be careful, or you’llknock it over.”Richard nodded, not wanting to distract himself by answering with words. He wasconcentrating on feeling the object of his need. He felt it near. His fingerslightly brushed the books, running down the stack, touching the bindings of someand the pages of others because they were turned around the other way. Hisfingers stopped on a binding.“This one.” He tapped the leather binding. “This one. What does it say?” Berdinepropped a hand on his thigh to support herself as she leaned in. “It’s HighD’Haran, Something about the Temple of the Winds-’Tagenricht osf fuer MosstVerlaschendreckmch Greschlechten.”“Temple of the Winds Inquisition and Trial,” Richard translated in a whisper.“We’ve found it.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47Breathe, the sliph said.Kahlan let go the silken essence and pulled a deep breath of the alien air. Thedim world of the sliph’s well down in the Keep whirled around her. Stone of thewalls and floor finally settled in her vision. The dome overhead seemed to slowits spinning.Something unexpected waited in the sliph’s room.Tilled back in the chair, with her feet propped up on the table, sat a figure inred leather. Kahlan sat down, dangling her feet over the edge of the stone wall,to gather her senses.The front legs of the chair thunked down. “Well, well, the wandering MotherConfessor returns at last.”Kahlan hopped down onto the floor. She almost lost her footing with the way itseemed to twist and tilt. “Cara, what are you doing down here?”Cara gripped Kahlan under her arm. “You better sit down until you regain yourfeet.”“I’m all right.” Kahlan glanced over her shoulder to the silver face behind her.“Thank you, sliph.”“Do you wish to travel?” The sliph’s haunting voice echoed off the walls anddome overhead for a long moment.“No, I’ve had enough travelling for the time being. I’m going to stay here.”“When you wish to travel, call me, and we will travel. You will be pleased.”“I don’t know about that,” Kahlan muttered as the sliph seemed to melt back intoher well.“She’s a spooky companion to have down here,” Cara said. “She invited me totravel with her, too, and then told me I didn’t have the magic required. Shecomes and stares at me with that eerie smile.”“Cara, what are you doing down here?”Cara leaned Kahlan back against the sliph’s well. She gave Kahlan the strangestlook as she shook her head to herself.“When Lord Rahl read your letter, it didn’t take him long to figure out what youhad done. Berdine told him how you had brought us here to look for that book onthe trial record. He came down here, but the sliph wouldn’t tell him where shehad taken you.“Lord Rahl said that now that he knew the sliph was not sleeping, as he hadthought, it wasn’t safe to leave her alone. He said that others, like the Sisterand Marlin, could come through.” Kahlan hadn’t thought about that, about anotherone of Jagang’s minions coming to Aydindril through the sliph. The sliph seemedto have no loyally. She would travel with anyone who had the required price ofmagic. “So, Richard left you here?”“He said he couldn’t remain down here all the time to guard the sliph.” Cara’schin lifted with pride. “He said that a Mord-Sith must guard the well at alltimes, since we have the power to stop someone with magic. The Lord Rahl hasalways used the Mord-Sith to protect him against magic.”The wizards of old obviously had this same problem with the sliph, and had leftwizards like Kolo down here to guard her. Kolo said that the enemy sometimesarrived suddenly by way of the sliph, and that only the quick reactions of theone on guard had prevented disaster.“You mean he brought you down here and just left you?”“No. He searched for hours until he found a way without magic so we could getdown here on our own. He didn’t want to have to bring each of us down here forour turn, and he didn’t want us trapped down here. either. We have to takeshifts. I don’t like it. because we should be close to Lord Rahl in order toguard him, not this... silver thing, but I guess that we are guarding Lord Rahlby doing this, so I agreed to it.”Kahlan found her feet steady at last. “If we had known the sliph was awake, andhad been guarding her before, then Marlin wouldn’t have been able to come to tryto assassinate Richard, and the Sister wouldn’t have been able to start theplague.”Kahlan’s chest constricted with a hot. cutting pang of regret. They could haveprevented the whole thing. All the awful things she had learned would not bethreatening her people, her world, and her love. The realization of the chancelost left her nauseous.“Lord Rahl also wanted us to wait until your return from the witch woman, incase you needed help.”“Richard knew where I went?”“The sliph wouldn’t tell him. but he said he knew anyway. He said you went tothe witch woman.”“He knew, and he didn’t chase after me?”Cara pulled her long blond braid over her shoulder. “I was surprised, too. Iasked him why he wouldn’t go after you. He said that he loved you: he did notown you.”“Really? Richard said that?”“Yes.” A smirk tightened Cara’s lips. “You are training him well. MotherConfessor. I approve. And then he kicked a chair. I think he hurt his foot, buthe denies it.”“So, Richard is angry with me?”Cara rolled her eyes. “Mother Confessor, this is Richard we are talking about.The man is fool in love with you. He wouldn’t be angry with you if you told himto marry Nadine instead of you.”Kahlan swallowed at the renewed twist of pain. “Why would you say that?” Carafrowned. “I only meant he could never be angry with you. no matter what. Youwere supposed to laugh, not jump like I had poked you with my Agiel. MotherConfessor, he loves you: he is worried sick, but he is not angry with you.”“What about kicking the chair?”Cara stroked her long blond braid and smirked again. “He claimed the chair gavehim just cause.”“I see.” Kahlan couldn’t seem to find pleasure in Cara’s sense of humor. “Howlong have I been gone?”“Not quite two days. And I expect you to tell me how you managed to slip pastthose D’Haran guards out there by the bridge.”“It was snowing. They didn’t see me.”Cara didn’t look to believe it. She was giving Kahlan that odd look again. “Anddid you kill the witch woman?”“No.” Kahlan changed the subject. “What has Richard been doing while I wasgone?”“Well, first he asked the sliph to take him to the Temple of the Winds, but shesaid she didn’t know that place and couldn’t take him there, so he rode to MountKymermosst-”“He went there?” Kahlan snatched Cara’s arm. “What did he find?”“Nothing. He said that there was nothing to find. He said that if the Temple ofthe Winds was once there, it is now gone.”Kahlan released Cara’s arm. “He went to Mount Kymermosst, and he’s backalready?”“You know Lord Rahl; when he gets something in his head, he charges after it.The men who went with him said they rode hard. They slept little and rode muchof the night. Lord Rahl expected you to return last night and wanted to be backfor you. When you did not return as expected, he paced and fretted, but still hedid not go after you. Whenever he looked like he was about to change his mind,he read your letter again, and went back to pacing instead.”“I guess my letter was a little strong,” Kahlan said as she glanced down at thefloor.“Lord Rahl showed it to me.” Cara’s face was unreadable. “Sometimes it isnecessary to threaten men, or they get to thinking that they are the ones whosay what will be. You dissuaded him of that idea with your threats.”“I didn’t threaten him.” Kahlan thought that her tone sounded too much like aplea.Cara watched Kahlan’s eyes for a moment. “You are probably right. The chair musthave given Lord Rahl cause, as he said.”“I did what I had to do. Richard would understand that. I guess I’d better goexplain it to him.”Cara gestured behind, to the door. “You just missed him. He was here not longago.”“He came to see if I was back? He must be worried sick.”“Berdine told him about the book you were searching for. He came here and foundit.”Kahlan blinked in astonishment. “He found it? But we looked. It wasn’t there.How did he find it?”“He went to a place he called the First Wizard’s enclave, and found it there.”Kahlan’s jaw dropped. “He went in there? He went into the First Wizard’senclave? Alone, without me? He shouldn’t have gone there! That’s a dangerousplace!”“Really.” Cara folded her arms. “And of course you would never do anything sofoolish as to get it in your head to go run off alone to a dangerous place.Maybe you should reprimand Lord Rahl for his impulsive behavior, since you areso prudent and above such reckless conduct yourself.”The echo of Cara’s voice lingered uncomfortably before it died out. Kahlanunderstood. Even though Richard did as she had asked by not coming after her,Cara had tried. Even though she didn’t like magic. Cara had tried to go toprotect Kahlan.“Cara.” she said in a meek voice. “I’m sorry I tricked you. too.” Cara shrugged,but still showed no emotion. “I am just a guard. You have no obligation to me.”“Yes. I do. You are not ‘just a guard.’ You may be our protector, but you aremore. I consider you my friend. You are a sister of the Agiel. I should havetold you what I was doing, but I feared that if I did. Richard would be angrywith you for not stopping me. I didn’t want that.”Cara said nothing. Still, she showed no emotion. Kahlan breached theuncomfortable silence. “Cara, I’m sorry. I guess I was afraid you would try tostop me. I tricked you. You’re a sister of the Agiel: I should have trusted youand taken you into my confidence. Please, Cara. I was wrong. I beg you forgiveme.”A smile finally spread on Cara’s face. “We are sisters of the Agiel. I forgiveyou.”Kahlan managed a small smile. “Do you think Richard will be as understanding asyou?”Cara let out an amused grunt. “Well. you have better ways to persuade him toforgive you. It is not so difficult to melt a man’s frown.”“I only wish I had good news, so I could bring a smile to his face. but Idon’t.” She paused at the doorway. “What has Nadine been up to while I’ve beengone?”“Well, I’ve been down here guarding the sliph much of the time, but from whatI’ve seen, she has been giving the staff herbs to try to protect them. and touse in smoking the palace. It’s a good thing the place is made mostly of stoneor it would have been burned down by now. She has been conferring with Drefanand helping him in talking to the staff and others who come for advice.“Lord Rahl asked her to go out to visit herb sellers and such. to make sure theyare not hucksters out to swindle people who are in fear for their lives. Thecity seems to be sprouting shameless mountebanks the way the sudden warmth seemsto be bringing green grass. Nadine also gives reports to Lord Rahl. but he hasbeen gone much of the time. and as busy as she seems to be trying to helppeople, the visits since he returned are short.” Kahlan tapped the side of herfist against the doorway.“Thanks, Cara.” She looked into the other’s blue eyes. “There are rats downhere. Are you all right?”“There are worse things than rats.”“Indeed there are,” Kahlan whispered."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 48It was late, and with the dark, people on the streets didn’t recognize her.Without her usual escort of guards, they had no reason to give her a secondlook, no reason to suspect she was the Mother Confessor out among them. Just aswell; there were some people who wished the Mother Confessor harm. Mostly,people kept their distance from her, as they did with everyone else, hoping tokeep the plague from themselves.As Cara had said, there were hucksters everywhere, hawking potions to ward offthe plague, or to cure your loved ones already stricken. Others strolled thestreets with trays, held up on straps over their shoulders, neatly laid out withamulets possessing magic to protect against the plague. Kahlan remembered seeingsome of these same people not long ago selling the same amulets as magic to finda husband or wife, or to enthrall an unfaithful spouse. Old women with smallcarts or simple wooden stands sold carved spell-invested plaques made to hangover the door to a home as a sure way to keep the plague from entering thehouse. As late as it was, business seemed brisk. Even the vendors selling meatsand produce extolled the healthful virtues of their goods and their value inpromoting continued health, if eaten regularly, of course.Kahlan would send the soldiers out to put a stop to some of these swindlers, butshe knew that such intervention would likely be viewed with hostility on thepart of the buyers. If she tried to use the army to stop such foolish practices,desperate people would concoct theories about those in power wanting to stop thecures so that the decent, working folk would get the plague. Despite commonsense, or evidence to the contrary, many people believed that those in powerwere always scheming to harm them; if they only knew the truth.If Kahlan were to order the sale of these items stopped, the “cures” would besold in secret, and for a higher price. No matter how insupportable the claimsof these cures, their benefits would be vehemently supported as self-evidenttruth.Wizard’s First Rule: people would believe any lie, either because they wanted tobelieve it was true. or because they feared it was. These people were desperate,and would become more so, yet. Many wanted to believe.Kahlan tried to imagine what she would do if Richard had the plague. Would shebe despairing enough to put her faith in such trickery, hoping against hope thatit would save him? Sometimes hope was all people had. Groundless as it was, shecouldn’t take that hope away from them: it was all they had, and all they coulddo. It was up to Kahlan and Richard to do that which would help these people. Asshe made her way through the familiar splendor of the Confessors’ Palace, on herway to find Richard, Kahlan paused at the open double doors to a large room usedfor formal receptions. The room was a calming blue color, with dark blue drapesover the tall, narrow windows. The granite floor had a starburst pattern ofdarker and lighter stone radiating out from the center. Lamps on cherrywoodstands around the edge of the room lent a mellow light to the gathering hall.The table where small foods were sometimes set out for guests now held only anarray of candles.Kahlan’s attention had been drawn by the sound of Drefan’s voice. He stood tothe right, before the table with the candles, speaking to perhaps fifty or sixtypeople. They sat cross-legged on the floor before him, listening with raptattention as he spoke of the way of health, of keeping the body sound by beingin touch with the inner self.Most of the people nodded absently as they listened to Drefan explaining how, bydefiling their bodies with unhealthy thoughts and actions, people opened thepathway for sickness to enter. He told them that the Creator had endowed themwith the ability to fight off things such as the plague, if only they would doas nature provided, by eating the right foods that would strengthen the aurasthat defended the body, and by using inner reflection to direct the vigor ofvarious energy fields to their proper function in harmony with the whole.Many of the things he said made sense: not eating foods that you knew gave youheadaches, because it interfered with the mind’s ability to regulate the body:not eating foods that you knew caused pains and cramps in the gut. because itinterfered with the body’s ability to digest the good foods you needed: noteating heavy meals right before sleeping, because it interfered with your bodygetting the rest it needed to remain strong, and how all of these things disruptthe auras that give us strength and protect health.People marvelled openly that Drefan could make it all so simple for them tounderstand. They spoke as if they had been blind, and now for the first time hadvision. They watched with unblinking eyes as he went on. telling them that wehad within us the power to control our own bodies, and that disease could onlyafflict us if we allowed it to. He spoke of herbs and foods that purged poisonsfrom the body and left people truly healthy for perhaps the first time sincetheir birth.These people weren’t listening to Lord Rahl’s brother, they were listening toDrefan Rahl, High Priest of the Raug’Moss.As one, they followed the High Priest’s instructions when he told them to closetheir eyes and draw the breath of life and healthy steams through their nosesand down into their inner core by using the muscles low in their bellies. Heexplained how to let it reach deep into the source of the power of each person’sunique aura. to draw out the poisons from the furthest, darkest coiners of theirbeings and expel it out through the mouth, to be replaced with a renewing breathof life drawn in again through the nose.Better, Kahlan guessed, that these people would come to Drefan for advice thatmight help them, and at least sounded like it could do no harm. than spend theirsavings on false hope from the hucksters in the street. Paying attention totheir body’s needs with things like proper food and rest seemed sound advice.As they all drew the slow, deep breaths in through their noses. Drefan turnedhis head and locked his Darken Rahl eyes on Kahlan, as if he had known all alongthat she had been standing there outside the doorway. He gave her a kind-heartedsmile that sparkled benevolently in his blue eyes. She could see why thesepeople put their trust in him. She made herself return a little smile. Kahlanremembered the talk she had had with Shota about how difficult it was to banishunpleasant memories. Kahlan wished she could forget Drefan’s hand between Cara’slegs.Drefan was trying to help people. He was doing everything he could to halt theplague. He was a great healer-the High Priest of the Raug’Moss. She tried to putthe image of him comforting those sick children in place of the memory of hisforcing his big hand down between Cara’s legs.Drefan had explained, at the time, why he had done that to Cara. He had savedCara’s life. A Mord-Sith, screaming in pain, then unconscious, and Drefan hadbrought her back. Richard found comfort in Drefan, as did everyone else. Kahlanbroke eye contact with him and continued on her way to find Richard.Tristan Bashkar, the Jarian ambassador staying at the Confessors’ Palace whilehe waited for further signs from the stars, further word from above, beforesurrendering, paused at a balcony as she passed below. As was his habit, he drewback his coat and rested his hand on his hip. It displayed the wicked dagger hewore at his belt. Oftentimes, in conversation, he would also put a boot up on achair or stool and casually rest his forearm on his knee. It provided those inconversation with him the opportunity to see also the knife he kept in his boot.The more she saw Tristan in the palace, watching her with his cunning eyes, themore she disliked his presence. If there was a man who acted more childish,Kahlan didn’t know him.Tristan watched silently as she hurried on her way. Kahlan was glad he was up ona balcony, so that she wouldn’t have to waste time playing word games with him.Ulic and Egan gave Kahlan an odd look as she greeted them before whiskingthrough the door to the small room Richard liked to use to study Kolo’s journal.He was sitting with his head in his hands, his fingers buried in his hair, as heread from another book that lay open on the table. Two candles and a lamp on thetable beside him provided light, and a small, fragrant fire of birch logs addedwarmth to the cozy room. His cloak lay over a nearby chair, but he wore hissword.Richard looked up. When he saw her, he shot to his feet. Without the gold cloak,he was like a big, black shadow gliding across the room. Before he could speak,Kahlan rushed into his arms.Kahlan pressed the side of her face to his chest as she hugged him. “Please,Richard, don’t yell at me. Please, just hold me.” Tears choked her voice.“Please, don’t say anything-just hold me.”It was ecstasy being with him again. It never failed to astound her, whenevershe saw him, just how much she needed and loved him.Richard’s arms enclosed her in comforting shelter. She listened to the firecrackle, and the sound of his heart under her ear. She could almost imagine, inthe safety of his strong arms. that everything was fine, and that they had afuture. She remembered her mother’s words. Confessors don’t have love, Kahlan.They have duty.Kahlan clutched his black shirt as she fought a losing battle to hold backtears. He held her and stroked her hair. She had asked him to hold her and notspeak, and he was doing just that. That only made her feel worse.He must have questions. He must want to say something to her, to tell her howrelieved he was to see her sate, to tell her how worried he had been, to ask herwhere she had been and what she had found out, to tell her what he had found, toyell at her; but he didn’t. Instead, without protest, he did as she had asked,relegating his own desires to secondary, after hers.How would she go on without his love? How would she draw a breath? How would shemanage to make herself go on until she was old and could finally finish her dutyand at last die?“Richard... I’m so sorry I made that letter sound threatening. I didn’t mean tothreaten you, I swear. I just wanted you to be safe. I’m so sorry if I hurtyou.”He squeezed her a little tighter and kissed the top of her head. Kahlan wishedshe could just die in his arms. now. and not have to face her duty. not have toface the finality of the future, the finality of losing him. “How’s your foot?”she asked. “My foot?”“Cara said you hurt it on a chair.”“Oh. My foot is fine. The chair died, but I don’t think it suffered.” Againstall odds, Kahlan laughed. She looked up through her tears into his gentle smile.“All right. I think your hug has revived me. You can yell at me now.” He kissedher instead. The feeling of being pulled up in his arms was rapture. Being inthe sliph didn’t even come close.“So.” he finally said. “what did our ancestors’ spirits have to say?”“Our ancestors’... how did you know that I went to the Mud People?” Richard’sbrow curved into a bewildered cast. “Kahlan, your face is all painted so theancestors’ spirits could see you in a gathering. Did you think I wouldn’tnotice?”Kahlan touched her fingers to her forehead, to her cheek. “I was in such ahurry, I never even gave it any thought. No wonder people have been giving mesuch odd looks.”As she had raced through the palace looking for him. three different women onthe staff had offered to draw her a bath. Everyone must have thought she hadgone mad.Richard’s expression turned serious as he settled his arms around her waist.“So, what did the ancestors’ spirits have to say?”Kahlan steeled herself. She tilted her head, indicating the bone knife on herarm. “Grandfather’s spirit called me, through his bone knife. He had to speakwith me. He told me that the plague isn’t confined to Aydindril. It’s spread allover the Midlands.”Richard tensed. “Do you think it’s true?”“Elder Breginderin had the tokens on his legs. He’s probably dead by now. Somechildren reported that they saw a woman near the Mud People’s village. Sheshowed them something with colored light, just like what Lily told us she saw.One of those children has already died. Sister Amelia was there.”“Dear spirits,” Richard whispered.“It gets worse. The spirit showed me other places I know in the Midlands. Hesaid that the plague has spread to all these places, too. The spirit showed mewhat will be if the plague isn’t stopped. Death will sweep the land. Few willsurvive.“The spirit told me that magic stolen from the Temple of the Winds started theplague, but that the plague itself isn’t magic. Jagang has used magic morepowerful than he understands. If allowed to rage unchecked, the plague couldeventually sweep into the Old World, too.”“Small consolation. Did the spirit say how Jagang stole this magic from theTemple of the Winds?”Kahlan nodded as she looked away from his eyes. “You were right about the redmoons. It was a warning that the Temple of the Winds had been violated.”Kahlan told him about the Hall of the Betrayer, and how Sister Amelia had beenable to tread that path. Kahlan recounted the rest of her meeting with thespirit of Chandalen’s grandfather, as best as she could remember it, includingthe part about the temple being at least partially sentient, as Richard hadsuspected.Richard leaned an arm against the mantel as he stared into the fire. He pinchedhis lower lip as he listened patiently.Kahlan told him how the spirit had told her that to stop the plague, they mustget into the Temple of the Winds, how it existed in both worlds at the sametime, and how both the good and the evil spirits were involved and had a say inthis.“And the ancestor’s spirit could give you no indication how we were to get tothe Temple of the Winds?”“No,” Kahlan said. “In fact, he wasn’t interested in that part of it. He saidthat the temple would reveal what must be done. Shota said the same thing.”Engrossed in thought, Richard nodded while he considered her words. Kahlantwisted her fingers together while she waited.“What about Shota?” he asked at last. “What happened with her?” Kahlanhesitated. She knew she had to tell him at least some of it, but she wasreluctant to tell him all of what Shota had said. “Richard, I don’t believeShota was trying to cause trouble.” He looked back over his shoulder. “She sendsNadine to marry me, and you don’t think that kind of interference trouble?”Kahlan cleared her throat into her fist. “Shota didn’t send Nadine, exactly.”Richard’s hawklike gaze continued to fix on her, so she went on. “The messageabout the winds hunting you was not her idea. The Temple of the Winds wassending you a message, through her. just as it was sending you a message throughthat boy who died. Shota wasn’t trying to harm us.”Richard’s brow lowered. “What else did the witch woman tell you?” Kahlaninterlocked her fingers behind her back. She looked away from his penetratingglare.“Richard, I went there to put an end to Shota’s interference. I was prepared tokill her, if she threatened you or tried to harm me. I thought the worst of her.I did. I was convinced she was trying to harm us.“I talked with her. Really talked. Shota isn’t as... malicious as I thought. Sheadmitted she doesn’t want us to have a child, but this isn’t about trying tokeep us apart.“She has a talent for seeing the future, and she is only telling us what shesees- to try to help you. She’s just the messenger in this. She’s not directingthese events. She said the same thing as the ancestor’s spirit, that the plaguewas started by magic, and not of its own accord.”With three strides, Richard closed the distance between them. He seized her bythe upper arm.“She sent Nadine to marry me! She sent Nadine to keep us apart! She’s trying toput a wedge between us, and you are taken in by her tricks?”Kahlan backed away from him. “No, Richard, you have it wrong, as did l. Thespirits sent you a bride. Shota was only able to influence who it would be. Sheused that influence so that the bride sent would be Nadine. Shota says she seesthat you will marry this bride sent by the spirits, and so she wanted it to besomeone you knew. She was only trying to ease your pain in this.”“And you believe her? Have you lost your mind!”“Richard, you’re hurting my arm.”He released her. “Sorry.” he muttered, as he withdrew to the hearth. Kahlancould see the muscles in his jaw flexing as he ground his teeth.“You said she told you the same as the ancestor’s spirit. Do you remember herwords?”Kahlan tried frantically to separate what she knew she had to tell him from whatshe didn’t want him to know. She realized how unwise it was to try to hideinformation from Richard, but she reasoned that if she had to. she could alwaystell him everything. If she could get away with withholding some of it.Though...“Shota said we have not heard the last message from the winds. She said we willreceive one more, involving the moon.”“Involving the moon? How?”“I don’t know. Just like the spirit, the ‘how’ didn’t seem to be important toher. What she did say was that this message from the moon will be the‘consequential communion.’ as she called it. She said we must not ignore ordismiss it.”“Did she, now. And did she say why. exactly?”“She said our future-and the future of all those innocent people-will hinge onthis event. She said it would be our only chance to carry out our duty to savethe innocent lives of all those who depend upon us to do what they cannot.”Richard turned to her. It was like death itself rounding on her. His eyes hadthat look. like Drefan’s. Like Darken Rahl’s.“She told you something else that you’re holding back. What is it?” he growled.It wasn’t Richard speaking, it was the Seeker. She knew in that instant why aSeeker was so feared: he was a law unto himself. Those grey eyes were lookingright into her.“Richard,” she whispered, “please leave it at that.” His glare cut to her soul.“What did she tell you?”Kahlan swallowed as she panted with dread. She could feel hot tears coursingdown her face.“Shota saw the future.” Kahlan heard herself speaking, even though she hadintended to remain silent. “She saw that you will wed another. She used herinfluence to make it someone you knew.” Under his glare, she found remainingsilent impossible. “She could not influence who I am to wed. I will be married.too. It will not be you who becomes my husband.”Richard stood frozen for a moment, a boiling thunderhead gathering. He yankedthe baldric off over his head and tossed it and the scabbard holding the swordon a chair.“Richard, what are you doing?”And then he was moving. He went for the door. Kahlan put herself in front ofhim. It was like stepping in front of an enraged mountain. “Richard, what areyou going to do?”He grasped her by the waist, picked her up. and set her aside as if she were nomore than a child in his way. “I’m going to kill her.” Kahlan threw her armsaround his waist from behind, trying to drag him to a halt. It slowed him nomore than if she had been a gnat. He was leaving his sword because he couldn’ttravel in the sliph with the magic of the Sword of Truth. “Richard! Richard,please, stop! If you love me, stop!” He halted and turned his wrathful glare onher. His voice came like a crack of thunder. “What?”“Richard, do you think I’m stupid?”“Of course not.”“Then do you believe I want to marry someone else?”“No.”“Richard, you have to listen to me. Shota said she saw the future. She isn’tmaking the future, she just saw it. She told me these things so that what shesaw might help us.”“I’ve had all of the ‘help’ from Shota I intend to have. I’ll have no more ofit. She has taken one liberty too many. It will be her last.”“Richard, we have to figure out what to do. We have to do what we can to stopthis plague. You saw those sick, dying children. The spirit of Chandalen’sgrandfather showed me countless other dead children-dead people of all sorts.That will be the future if you do this. Do you want those children and theirparents to die because you refuse to use your head?”His fist was gripping some sort of ornament on an elaborate necklace. Sherealized she had never seen it before.Even though he wasn’t wearing his sword, its magic drove him. He was a cauldronof lethal rage. Death was dancing in his eyes.“I don’t care what Shota says, I’ll not marry Nadine. Nor will I stand by whileyou-”“I know,” she whispered. “Richard, I know how you feel. How do you think thismakes me feel? But use your head. This is not the way to change what Shota says.You always said before that the future is not yet decided, and that we couldn’tact on what Shota says. You always said that we couldn’t allow ourselves to putour faith in what she says, and let it direct our actions.” His eyes shone withdeadly wrath. “You believe her.”Kahlan took a calming breath, trying to regain her composure. “I believe she sawthe future. Richard, don’t you remember how she also said that I would touch youwith my power? Look at how that turned out. She was right, but it wasn’t thecalamitous event I feared. It was what brought us together, and allowed us tohave our love.”“How can your marrying someone else turn out good?” Kahlan abruptly realizedwhat this was really about: he was jealous. She had never seen him this jealousbefore. But that’s what it was-a jealous rage.“I would be lying if I told you I knew.” Kahlan gripped his broad shoulders.“Richard, I love you, and that’s the truth. I could never love anyone else. Youbelieve me, don’t you? I trust in your love for me, and I know that you don’tlove Nadine. Don’t you believe in me? Don’t you trust me?”He visibly cooled. “Of course I do. I do trust you.” Frustration replaced therage in his eyes. He released the amulet in his fist. “But-”“But nothing. We love each other, and that’s all there is to it. Whateverhappens, we have to believe in each other. If we don’t believe in each other,then we are lost in this.”At last, he pulled her into his arms. She knew his anguish. She felt it, too.Hers, though, was worse, because she didn’t believe there was a way out ofShota’s prediction.Kahlan lifted the strange amulet at his neck. In the center, surrounded by acomplex of gold and silver lines, was a teardrop-shaped ruby as big as herthumbnail. “Richard, what is this? Where did you get it?”He lifted the gold and silver object from her fingers to peer down at it. “It’sa symbol, like the others I wear. I found it in the Keep.”“In the First Wizard’s enclave?”“Yes. It was part of this outfit, but unlike the rest of it. this was left inthe First Wizard’s enclave. The man who wore it was the First Wizard in Kolo’stime. His name was Baraccus.”“Cara told me that you found the record of the trial. What did it look like inthere?”Richard stared off. “It was... beautiful. I didn’t want to leave.”“Have you found out anything from the book yet?”“No. It’s in High D’Haran. Berdine is working on Kolo’s journal; I’ll work onthis one. I’ve only had an hour or so to start translating it. I haven’t reallydone much yet: I was too worried about you to be able to think about anythingelse.”Kahlan touched the amulet hanging around his neck. “Do you know what this symbolrepresents?”“Yes. The ruby is meant to represent a drop of blood. It is the symbolicrepresentation of the way of the primary edict.”“The primary edict?”His voice turned distant, as if speaking to himself more than to her. “It meansonly one thing, and everything: cut. Once committed to fight, cut. Everythingelse is secondary. Cut. That is your duty, your purpose, your hunger. There isno rule more important, no commitment that overrides that one. Cut.” His wordschilled her to the bone as he went on.“The lines are a portrayal of the dance. Cut from the void, not frombewilderment. Cut the enemy as quickly and directly as possible. Cut withcertainty. Cut decisively, resolutely. Cut into his strength. Flow through thegaps in his guard. Cut him. Cut him down utterly. Don’t allow him a breath.Crush him. Cut him without mercy to the depths of his spirit.“It is the balance to life: death. It is the dance with death. “It is the law awar wizard lives by. or he dies.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49Clarissa sat curled up in a chair, sewing the hem of a new dress Nathan hadbought for her. He had wanted to let the seamstress do the work, but she hadinsisted on doing it herself, mostly to have something to do. Nathan had smiledand told her that if it would please her, then it was all right with him. Shedidn’t know what she would do with all the dresses he kept buying for her. Shehad told him to stop, but he just kept doing it.Nathan returned from the door, having had a long discussion with a soldier namedBollesdun about the movements of Jagang’s expeditionary force. They were the menwho had attacked her home of Renwold, Clarissa had learned. She tried not tolisten to Nathan’s talks with his soldier friends who showed up from time totime.She didn’t like to think about the nightmare of Renwold. Nathan told her that hewanted to end the killing, so there would be no more Renwolds. He called it awaste of life.Clarissa touched Nathan’s leg when he came close. “Is there anything I can do tohelp?”His blue eyes turned toward her, watching her for a long moment. “No, not yet. Imust write a letter. I’m expecting someone soon. Don’t go into the bedroom toanswer the door when they come. Stay in here. I don’t want them to get a look atyou. You don’t have magic, so they won’t know you’re in here.”Clarissa caught the tone of disquiet in his voice. “Do you think they will causetrouble? They won’t try to hurt you, will they?”A sly smile took his face. “That would be the last mistake they ever made. I’velaid so many traps around this place that the Keeper himself wouldn’t dare totry to take me here.” He winked at her, as if to reassure her. “Watch throughthe keyhole, if you wish. It may be good for you to remember the faces of thesepeople. They’re dangerous.”Her stomach churning with anxiety, Clarissa began embroidering little vines andleaves along the hem of the dress, because she thought they would be pretty, andto pass the time while Nathan wrote his letter. When he finished, he clasped hishands behind his back and paced.When the knock finally came, he looked toward the bedroom, where stood the doorto the hall. He turned to her and crossed his lips with a finger. Clarissanodded. He shut the door to the sitting room as he went to answer the knock. Sheset aside her needlework and knelt at the door to peek through the keyhole.She had a good view of the hall door as Nathan pulled it open. Two attractivewomen, about Clarissa’s age, stood in the hall. Two young men waited behindthem. The scowls on the women could have cut stone.Clarissa was astonished to see that each woman had a small gold ring through herlower lip, as did Clarissa.“Well. well.” one of the women said contemptuously, “if it isn’t the prophethimself. We thought it was probably you. Nathan, messing about in things thataren’t your business.”Nathan grinned as he bowed dramatically from the waist. “Sister Jodelle. SisterWillamina. How nice to see you again. And that’s Lord Rahl. Even to you, SisterJodelle.”“Lord Rahl.” Sister Jodelle said in a flat. mocking voice. “So we’ve heard.”Nathan waggled his fingers in greeting to the two young men standing out in thehall behind the two women. “Vincent, Pierce, how good to see you two boy wizardsagain. Still trying to master prophecy, are you? Come for some advice? Maybe alesson?”“In a little over your head, aren’t you. old man?” one of the young men asked.Nathan’s amusement vanished. He flicked his finger. The young man cried out anddropped to the floor.“I told you. Pierce, it’s Lord Rahl.” Nathan’s voice turned as deadly asClarissa had ever heard it. “Don’t test me again.”Sister Willamina scowled back at Pierce, whispering a harsh admonishment as hestaggered to his feet.Nathan held his arm out in invitation. “Won’t you ladies please come in? Bringyour boys, too.”Clarissa didn’t think they really looked like boys. as Nathan called them. Shethought they looked to be in their late twenties, at least. The four warilystepped inside and stood in a bunch, hands clasped before them. while Nathanshut the door.“Pretty risky, Na... Lord Rahl, to let the four of us get this close,” SisterJodelle said. “I wouldn’t think you would be this careless, now that you’vesomehow convinced some feeble-minded Sister to take pity on you and remove yourRada’Han.”Nathan slapped his knee and howled with laughter. None of the other four so muchas cracked a smile.“Risky?” he asked, as his fit of laughter died out. “Why, what have I to fearfrom the likes of you four? And I’ll have you know that I took off the Rada’Hanby myself. I think it only fair to tell you that while you foolishly chose toview me as a crazy old man, I was studying things you can’t even fathom. Whileall of you Sisters-”“Get to the point,” Sister Jodelle growled.Nathan held up a finger. “The point is, my fine people, that I have no ill willtoward you or your leader, but I can weave webs you couldn’t even understand,much less defend against, should you wish me harm. For example. I’m sure youdetect the simple shields I’ve placed here and there, but there is more. hiddenbeyond those things you sense. Should you-”Sister Jodelle lost her patience and cut him off again. “We didn’t come here tolisten to the babble of a doddering old man. Do you think us stupid? We detectedthe pathetic magic you have so proudly laced about this place, and I can tellyou with confidence there’s not a bit of it that one of us alone couldn’t sliceapart with ease. while at the same time enjoying a bowl of soup!” Vincent shovedthe two Sisters aside. “I’ve heard just about enough from this dried-up oldjackass. He always was full of himself. It’s about time he learned just who he’sdealing with!”Nathan made no move to defend himself as Vincent lifted his hands. Clarissa’seyes went wide in fright as the young man’s fingers curled and his face twistedwith hate. Clarissa covered her mouth in terror as light shot from Vincent’shands toward Nathan.A brief whine sang through the air. The light from the young man scattered.There was a thump that Clarissa could feel in the floor as light flared throughthe other room.When the sound and light cleared, Vincent was gone.On the floor, where he had stood, Clarissa could see a small pile of white ash.Nathan went to the wall and retrieved a broom leaned there, just behind acurtain. He opened the door and swept the ash out through the door into thehall.“Thank you for coming, Vincent. Sorry you have to leave now. Let me show youout.”With a flourish, Nathan swept the last of the ash out into the hall, creating asmall cloud as he did so. He shut the door and turned back to the gaping gazesof the three people left.“Now, as I was saying, you will be making the last mistake of your lives if youunderestimate me or what it is you think me capable of. Your negligibleintellects couldn’t even understand it if I showed it to you.” Nathan’s browdrew down in a way that frightened even Clarissa. “Now, show proper respect andbow to the Lord Rahl.”Reluctantly, the three people bowed, each touching a knee to the floor. “What isit you want?” Sister Jodelle asked after she had straightened. Her voice hadlost some of its edge. “You can tell Jagang that I’m interested in peace.”“Peace?” Sister Jodelle fussed back some of her dark hair. “What position areyou in that you could make such an offer?”Nathan lifted his chin. “I am Lord Rahl. I will soon be Master of D’Hara. I willbe in command of the New World. I believe it is a war with the New World inwhich Jagang is embroiled.”Sister Jodelle’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean, you are soon to be the Masterof D’Hara?”“Just tell Jagang that his daring plan is about to be successfully completed; hewill soon have eliminated the present Lord Rahl. Jagang has made a mistake,though. He forgot about me.”“But... but - . .” Sister Jodelle sputtered, “you aren’t the Lord Rahl.” Nathanleaned toward them with a sly smile. “If Jagang succeeds, which as a prophet Ican foresee he will, then I will be the Lord Rahl. I am a Rahl, born with thegift. All D’Harans will become bonded to me. As you know, that bond will preventthe dream walker from using his talent to take the New World.“Jagang has made a mistake.” Nathan thunked Pierce on the head. “He’s been usingamateur prophets, like this witless tadpole.” Pierce turned red. “I’m no amateurprophet!”Nathan regarded him with a look of contempt. “Really? Then why didn’t you warnJagang that by using prophecy to eliminate Richard Rahl, it would get himnowhere but into a worse predicament, because it would leave me to become theLord Rahl, Master of D’Hara and most of the major powers in the New World?Did you warn him about that result? While Richard may be determined, he knowsnext to nothing about magic, whereas I know a great deal about it. A very greatdeal.”Nathan lowered over Pierce. “Just ask Vincent. A real prophet would haverealized the danger lurking behind my simple shields, waiting to be triggered ifanyone attacked. Did you?”Sister Willamina put out an arm. forcing Pierce back. and just in time. itappeared to Clarissa, as Nathan looked to be about to make another pile of whitedust. “What is it you want. Lord Rahl?” she asked.“Jagang can either listen to my terms, or he can have really big trouble on hishands. Trouble a lot worse than Richard Rahl.”“Terms?” Sister Jodelle drew the word out suspiciously. “The present Lord Rahlis young and idealistic: he would never surrender to Jagang. I, on the otherhand, am older and wiser. I know the foolishness of a war that would take thelives of countless people. And to what purpose? Just for the right to put a nameto the one who is the leader?“Richard is a young fool who doesn’t know how to use his power. I am not a youngfool, and, as you saw, I know how to use my gift. I’m willing to entertain thepossibility of letting Jagang rule the New World as he wishes.”“And in return?”Nathan casually flicked his hand. “I simply want some of the spoils for myself-in return for my assistance. I will have the rule of D’Hara. Under hisleadership, of course. I will be his man, running the affairs of D’Hara. Otherthan Jagang, no one will outrank me. Quite fair I think.”The young Pierce was still white as a sheet, and trying to look invisible behindthe two women. The two Sisters, on the other hand, were looking suddenly a lotless unhappy. They wore small, interested smiles. “How would Jagang know thatyou could be trusted?”“Trusted? Does he think I’m as stupid as the young Lord Rahl leading the NewWorld right now? I saw what was done to Renwold. If I didn’t rule D’Hara asJagang wished, allowing him generous tribute, he might come in and try to crushus. Wars are expensive. I’d rather have the wealth for myself.”Sister Jodelle smiled politely. “And in the meantime? How do we know you reallymean this?”“So. it’s assurance you want?” Nathan rubbed his chin as he stared up at theceiling. “There is a D’Haran army, of close to a hundred thousand men. north ofhere. You’ll never find them without my help, until they descend on Jagang’sexpeditionary force. When Jagang finishes eliminating the present Lord Rahl,then this army’s bond will transfer to me. They will be loyal to me. As soon asthat happens. I will surrender that army to his, giving him even more men atarms. D’Harans have a long tradition of warring for plunder. They’ll fit rightin with Jagang’s force.”“Surrender an army,” Sister Jodelle said in a reflective tone. “You see, my kindSisters, Jagang is trying to use prophecy to win this war. In that. he has madea mistake; he is using wizards who are not real prophets. I could provide theexpert service of a real prophet. His alternative is to have a real prophet ashis enemy, and amateurs to aid him. The aid of amateurs is what got him intothis... predicament, don’t you see? “For a small, insignificant slice of thespoils. I can get him out of it. I’m sure you can understand that after allthose years under the care of you fine Sisters, I’d like to spend my fewremaining years enjoying the pleasures of life.“With my help, there will be no more resistance from the New World than thatoffered by Renwold. If Jagang should choose to be unreasonable, well, who knows,with a real prophet on the side of the New World, they might even win.” SisterJodelle studied Nathan’s eyes. “Yes. I see what you mean.” Nathan held out hisletter. “Here. Give this to Jagang. It explains my proposal and terms, in returnfor my surrender of the New World. As I said. I’m sure he will find me much morereasonable than the present Lord Rahl; I know that there is no profit in war.One leader or another, it means little. Why should hundreds of thousands ofpeople die over the name put to that leader?”Both Sisters glanced around the luxurious room and smiled conspiratorially atNathan.“Why, you crafty old man,” Sister Jodelle said. “And here, all this time, wethought you were just an old fool, living out your life down in your apartments.Well, Lord Rahl, we will pass your words along to Emperor Jagang. I think hewill find them most interesting. Had the present Lord Rahl been so reasonable,he wouldn’t be in his present, fatal difficulties.”“All those years do give a man time to think.”Sister Jodelle turned back from the door. “I can’t speak for the emperor, LordRahl, but I think he will be most pleased with this news. I think we can dare tosee the end to this war, and the victory that will result in Jagang being thename put to the leader of all people.”“I just want the killing to stop. It would profit us all. Sister. Oh, and tellJagang that I am sorry about Vincent, but the boy wasn’t really serving himwell, anyway.” Sister Jodelle shrugged. “You’re right, Lord Rahl, he wasn’t.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50Richard ran his fingers through his hair as he rested his forehead in his palms.He looked up when he heard someone enter the room. It was Kahlan.His heart lifted at her smile, her bright green eyes. the lush fall of her thickhair, at how beautiful she was. He marvelled at her beauty, and that she lovedhim.The safety he felt in that love was something he had never imagined he wouldfeel. He had always imagined being in love with someone, but he had neverimagined the feeling of security and peace it would bring to his soul. If Shotaever did anything to harm that security...Kahlan carried a steaming bowl of soup. “I thought you might like something toeat. You’ve been at this for a hand of days now: I think you need to get moresleep, too.”He glanced at the big white bowl in her hands. “Thanks.” Her brow wrinkled.“Richard, what’s wrong? Your face is white as ashes.” He leaned back in hischair and sighed. “I feel a little sick.” She turned white as ashes, too. “Sick.Richard, it isn’t-”“No, it’s not that. It’s this book on the Temple of the Winds inquisition andtrial. I almost wish I’d never found it.”Kahlan leaned over as she set down the bowl. “Here. Eat some of this.”“What is it?” Richard asked, as he watched the lush curve of her cleavage riseand fall above the square neckline of her white Confessor’s dress. “Lentilporridge. Eat some. What have you found out?” Richard sucked in through hismouth to cool the spoonful of porridge. “I haven’t translated much yet, it’staking forever, but from just the little bit I’ve been able to figure out. thesepeople, these wizards... they... they executed all the wizards who sent away theTemple of the Winds. The temple team. they called them. Almost a hundred men.”He pulled a finger across his throat.Kahlan sat on the edge of the table opposite him. “What did they do to warrantdeath?”Richard stirred the porridge. “Well, for one thing, they left a way into theTemple of the Winds, as they were directed to do. but they made it so hard toget back into the temple that when these people wanted to get back in toretrieve some magic, in order to fight the war, they couldn’t.”“Kolo said that there were the red moons, that the temple sent the warning. Youmean, the wizards of old were never able to answer the warning?”“That wasn’t the way it worked. They did get back in.” He waved his spoon foremphasis. “In fact, that was the reason for the red moon. It was the secondattempt to get in, to answer the red moons caused by the first person sent. thatthey failed at.”Kahlan leaned toward him while Richard ate a spoonful of porridge. “But thisfirst person got in?”“Oh yes, he got in. In that was the problem.” Kahlan shook her head. “I’m notfollowing this.”Richard set down his spoon and leaned back in his chair. He met her gaze. “Thetemple team, who sent away the Temple of the Winds, were also the ones whoplaced the magic in it. You know about some of the terrible magical creationsthat were made in the war? Things made out of people? Like the mriswith? Likethe dream walkers?“Well, the people of the New World were fighting the people of the Old World,who wanted to eliminate magic, much as Jagang does today. These wizards who tookthe things of power to the safety of the temple were somewhat in sympathy withthose in the Old World who wanted to eliminate magic. They thought that usingpeople lo create these terrible weapons was as evil as some of the very thingsthey fought against.”Fascinated, Kahlan leaned toward him. “You mean they turned to the side of theenemy? They were really working for those in the Old World, to eliminate magic?”“No, they weren’t working to defeat the New World, or to stop all magic, butthey felt that they viewed the whole matter on a wider scope than just the war,unlike the wizards in charge, here, at the Keep. They sought the middle ground.They decided that, to an extent, the war, and all their troubles, were relatedto the misuse of magic.“They decided that something had to be done.” Kahlan hooked some hair behind herear. “Done? Like what?”“You know the way the Keep used to be full of wizards? The way wizards used tohave both sides of the magic? The way the wizards of old wielded much more powerthan even Zedd does now as First Wizard? The way those born with the gift aremore and more rare all the time?“I think these wizards used the Temple of the Winds to withdraw some of magic’spower from this world-they locked it away in the underworld, where it couldn’tbe used to cause harm, as they saw it, in this world.”Kahlan put a hand to her chest. “Dear spirits. What gave them the right todecide this? They are not the Creator who gave all things, including magic.”Richard smiled. “The head of the inquisition said much the same thing. Hedemanded to know exactly what they had done.”“And have you found the answer?”“I haven’t translated much, yet, and I don’t understand the way the magicworked, but I think that what the temple team did was to lock away theSubtractive portion of the wizards’ magic. It’s the Subtractive part that wasused to turn people into these weapons; with it, (hey took away parts of whothese people were. the parts these wizards didn’t want, and then with AdditiveMagic, the wizards added in the things they did want, so they could use thesepeople as weapons.”“What about you? You were born with both sides. If the power was locked away,how does that explain your gift? I, too, have an element of Subtractive Magic tomy Confessor’s power. Darken Rahl used Subtractive Magic, as do some of theSisters. There are creatures yet today who have some of this element to theirmagic.” Richard wiped a weary hand across his face. “I don’t know. I’m not evenpositive about what I’ve told you. There’s still most of this book to translate.I’ve only just begun.“Even when I translate it all. I’m not sure it will provide the answers we want.This was an inquisition and trial: they weren’t trying to teach me history. Itwas common knowledge at the time. They didn’t need to explain it.“What I’m beginning to think the temple team did was to halt Subtractive Magic’sability to be passed on to the offspring of wizards. Your magic isn’t passed onfrom a wizard, so perhaps that’s why it wasn’t affected. Darken Rahl learned touse Subtractive Magic: he wasn’t born with it. Therein, perhaps, lies thedifference. Maybe they miscalculated how taking Subtractive Magic out of thoseborn with the wizard’s gift would affect the balance, and so didn’t anticipatethe way it would cause fewer and fewer to be born with the gift.“Maybe they did know. Maybe that’s what they wanted. Maybe that’s why they wereexecuted.”“What about the red moons?”“Well, when those in charge found all this out. they sent someone to undo whatthese wizards had done. They needed one with tremendous power, and conviction.hoping he would have enough strength to succeed. They sent the most zealousproponent of magic among them, a fanatic-the head prosecutor, a powerful wizardnamed Lothain-to the Temple of the Winds to undo the damage.” Kahlan drew herlower lip between her teeth. “What happened?”“He got in, through Betrayer’s Hall, just like you told me. It worked just asyou said; Lothain entered, but in so doing, he betrayed them. I’m not sure whatit was that he did: many of the words, I think, have to do with specific magicthat I don’t understand. But from what I gather, he reinforced what the wizardswho sent the temple away had done. and made it even worse.“He betrayed those in the New World. Because he had to alter the way the Templeof the Winds held this magic, it set off the warnings of the red moons.“When the Temple sent the red moons, and the call for aid, a wizard was sent.Because the temple was sending for help, the wizards were glad for the call.since it meant that they wouldn’t have to enter through Betrayer’s Hall. Theythought they would be able to get in and at last remedy the problem. He nevercame back. They sent another, more powerful and experienced wizard. He neverreturned, either.“Finally, in view of the seriousness of the situation, the First Wizard himselfwent to the Temple of the Winds.” Richard lifted the amulet at his chest.“Baraccus.”“Baraccus,” Kahlan breathed in wonder. “Did he get into the temple?”“They were never sure.” Richard pushed his thumb back and forth along the edgeof the table. “Baraccus came back in a dazed stupor. They followed after him,but he didn’t react or respond to anything they said or did.“He went into the First Wizard’s enclave-his retreat-and left this there.”Richard held up the amulet at his chest, showing it to her. “He came out,removed the rest of his outfit-these things I wear-and then walked to the edgeof the rampart and jumped off the side of the mountain to his death.”Kahlan sat back up straight while Richard cleared his throat and gathered hisvoice before going on.“After that, the wizards abandoned any further attempt to get into the Temple ofthe Winds, to answer the call of the red moons, as impossible. They were neverable to get in to undo the damage the temple team and then Lothain had done.”Kahlan watched him with a sober look as he stared off at nothing. “How did theyknow all this?”Richard’s fist tightened around the amulet at his chest. “They used a Confessor.Magda Searus. The first Mother Confessor herself.”“She lived in that lime? She was there, in this war? I never knew that.” Richardrubbed his fingertips across the furrows on his brow. “Lothain wouldn’t tellthem what he had done. The wizards conducting the trial were the ones whoordered the creation of the Confessors. Magda Searus was the first. They knewthat they wouldn’t be able to torture the truth out of Lothain-they tried-sothey took this woman, Magda Searus, created the magic of the Confessors, andinstilled the power in her.“She touched Lothain with her power and got the truth out of him. He confessedthe extent of what the temple team had done, and what he had done.”Richard looked away from her green eyes. “The wizard who did this to MagdaSearus, created the Confessors’ power, was named Merritt. The tribunal was sopleased with the results of Merritt’s conjuring that they commanded an order ofConfessors to be created, and wizards assigned to safeguard them.“Merritt became protector to Magda Searus, her wizard, in return for the life,the duty, to which he had condemned her, to which he had condemned all thedescendants of Confessors to follow.”The room fell silent. Kahlan was wearing her Confessor’s face: the blankexpression that showed nothing of her feelings. He didn’t need to see anexpression on her face to know her feelings. Richard pulled the porridge backand ate some more. It had cooled considerably.“Richard,” Kahlan finally whispered, “if these wizards, with all that power,with all that knowledge... if even they couldn’t get into the Temple of theWinds after it sent its warning with the red moons, then .. .” Her voice trailedoff. Richard put words to the rest of it. “Then how can I hope to?”Richard ate lentil porridge as the uncomfortable silence dragged on. “Richard,”Kahlan said in a quiet voice, “if we don’t get into the temple, then what thespirit showed me will come to pass. Death will sweep the land. Untold numbers ofpeople will die.”Richard nearly leaped lo his feet and screamed at her that he knew that. Nearlyscreamed, asking what she expected him to do. Instead, he swallowed back thescreams along with the porridge. “I know,” he whispered.He went back to eating his porridge in silence. When he had finished, and wassure he had composed himself, he went on.“One of the temple team, a wizard named Ricker, made a statement before theyexecuted him.” Richard pulled the piece of paper with the translation out of thedisorderly stack and read it to her. “I can no longer countenance what we dowith our gift. We are not the Creator, nor are we the Keeper. Even a vexatiousprostitute has the right to live her life.’”“What was he talking about?” Kahlan asked.“I think that when the wizards used people-destroyed them-to create the thingsthey needed to right the war, I think they used people who were troublesome forone reason or another-people they didn’t mind destroying. I’ve heard it saidthat a wizard must use people. I doubt they knew the ghastly origin of themaxim.”He saw dismay haunting her eves.“Richard, do you think then. from what you’ve read. that it’s hopeless? Do youthink we can do nothing, then?”Richard didn’t know what to say. He reached over and clasped her hand. “Thetemple team, before they were executed, said in their own defense that theyhadn’t sealed the temple away for good. as they might have easily done. butinstead left a way in to answer the call. They said that if the need was trulygreat enough, it could still be entered. “I will get in. Kahlan. I swear it.”A small measure of relief came briefly to her beautiful eyes, but the hauntedlook settled back into them. Richard knew what she was thinking. It was the sameas he’d wondered himself as he read of the madness that was the war. and of whatpeople had done to each other.“Kahlan, we don’t use magic to destroy people for our own purposes. We use it tofight against a cause that murders helpless children. We tight for freedom fromterror and killing.”A small smile returned as she squeezed his hand. They both looked up when theyheard a knock on the open door. It was Drefan. “Can I come in? I’m notinterrupting anything, am I?”“No, it’s all right.” Richard said. “Come in.”“I just wanted you to know that I ordered the carts, like you wanted. It’sgotten to that point.”Richard rubbed his fingertips across his forehead. “How many?”“A little over three hundred last night, if the reports are all in. As yoususpected might be the case, the people can’t handle that many dead anymore, andthe numbers grow each day.”Richard nodded. “We can’t let the dead wait. It could spread the plague evenfaster to have them rotting in the open air. They have to be buried as soon asthey die. Tell the men I want the dead-carts sent out just as soon as they haveit organized. I give them until sunset.”“I already told them. As you say, we can’t allow bodies infected with the plagueto go untended: it could make the plague worse.”“It can get worse?” Richard mocked. Drefan didn’t answer.“I’m sorry,” Richard said. “That wasn’t called for. Have you found anything thatis of any use?”Drefan tugged down the sleeves of his white shirt. “Richard, there is no curefor the plague. At least, I know of none. The only hope is to stay healthy.Speaking of which, it isn’t healthy to sit in here all day and most of thenight. You aren’t getting enough sleep, again. I can see it in your eyes. I’vewarned you about that before. And you need to walk around, get some air.”Richard was sick of trying to translate the book, and sick of the things hefound out when he succeeded. He flipped it closed and pushed back his chair.“This is doing no good. anyway. Let’s go for that walk you suggested.” Richardyawned as he stretched. “And what have you been doing to keep busy.” he askedKahlan, “while I’ve been shut up in this stuffy room?”Kahlan cast a furtive glance at Drefan. “I-I’ve been helping Drefan and Nadine.”“Helping them? Helping them do what?”Drefan smoothed the ruffles on the front of his shirt. “Kahlan has been helpingwith the staff. Some of them are... ill.”Richard looked from Kahlan’s eyes to Drefan’s. “The plague is in the palace?”“I’m afraid so. Sixteen of them have come down sick. A few are common illnesses,the rest-” Richard heaved a weary sigh. “I see.”Raina was standing guard outside his room. She straightened when Richard camethrough the door.“Raina, we’re going for a walk. I suppose you’d better come along, or I’ll neverhear the end of it from Cara.”Raina smiled as she brushed back a wisp of dark hair. She knew he was right. andwas obviously glad he was cooperating.“Lord Rahl,” Raina said, “I didn’t want to disturb you while you were working,but the captain of the city guard came by with a report.”“I know. I heard. Three hundred people died last night.” Raina’s leather creakedas she shifted her weight. “That, too, but they wanted me to tell you that theyfound another woman last night. She was cut up like the other four.”Richard closed his eyes as he wiped a hand across his mouth. He noticed that hehadn’t remembered to shave that day. “Dear spirits. Don’t we have enough peopledying without some madman going around killing more of them?”“Was this one a prostitute, like the others?” Drefan asked. “The captain said hewasn’t positive, but he was pretty sure she was.” Drefan shook his head withdisgust. “You’d think he’d be worried about the plague, if not getting caught.The plague is running wild among the prostitutes, more so than among thepopulace at large.”Richard caught sight of Berdine coming up the hall. “As much as I’d like to dosomething about it, we have bigger worries.” He turned to Raina. “When we getback, tell the captain that I want his men to spread the word among those womenthat there’s a killer among them, and that for their own safety we hope theywill cease their profession, at least for the time being.“I’m sure the soldiers will know where to find all the prostitutes,” he addedunder his breath. “Have them get the word out at once. If these women don’t stopselling their bodies, they’re likely to find themselves in the company of thewrong customer. Their last customer.”Richard waited until Berdine reached them. “Aren’t you supposed to be up in theKeep taking your turn guarding the sliph?” Richard asked her.Berdine shrugged. “I went up there, to relieve Cara, but she said she wanted tostay for another watch.”Richard raked back his hair. “Why would she want to do that?” Berdine shruggedagain. “She didn’t say.” Kahlan took his arm. “I think it’s the rats.”“What?”“I think she’s trying to prove something to herself.” Kahlan hesitated. “Caradoesn’t like rats.”“I don’t blame her,” Raina muttered.“Filthy creatures,” Drefan put in. “I don’t blame her, either.”“If any of you tease her about it,” Kahlan warned, “you will answer to me- whenCara’s done with you. It’s not funny.”No one looked in the mood to challenge Kahlan, nor were any of them in a mood tosee anything as funny. “Where are you going?” Berdine asked.“We’re going for a walk.” Richard said. “You’ve probably been sitting as much asI have. If you’d like. come along.”Nadine came around the corner and caught sight of them just as they started out.“What’s going on?”“Nothing.” Richard said. “How are you doing. Nadine?” Nadine smiled. “Fine.thank you. I’ve been busy smoking sick rooms, as Drefan asked.”“We were just going out for a walk,” Kahlan said. “You’ve been working hard,Nadine. Why don’t you come along with us?” Richard frowned at Kahlan. She didn’tlook back at him. Nadine studied Kahlan’s eyes for a moment. “Sure. I’d likethat.” The six of them made their way through the marble halls, past imposingtapestries and elegant furniture, and across sumptuous carpets on their waytoward the main palace gates. Soldiers on patrol bowed or clapped fists overheart as the six of them passed. The staff Richard saw going about theirbusiness seemed to be in a state of shock. He saw people weeping as they hurriedabout their tasks.Before they made the door. they encountered Tristan Bashkar. Richard was in nomood to speak with the Jarian ambassador. Tristan sauntered to a halt beforethem. There would be no avoiding him this time.Tristan bowed his head. “Mother Confessor, Lord Rahl. I’m glad I ran into you.”“What do you want, Tristan?” Kahlan asked in a level tone. He watched hercleavage as she spoke. His gaze moved to Richard. “I want to know-”Richard cut him off. “Did you come to offer Jara’s surrender?” Tristan pulledhis coat back and rested his fist on his hip. “The time I was allotted is notyet expired. I’m concerned about this plague. You’re Lord Rahl. You’re supposedto be running everything, now. I want lo know what you’re going to do about theplague.” Richard restrained himself. “What we can.”Tristan glanced to Kahlan’s chest again. “Well. I’m sure that you can understandthat I need assurance.” His gaze returned to Richard. A sly smile spread on hisface. “After all, how can I, in good conscience, surrender my land to a manoverseeing what may prove to be the greatest cataclysm in the history of theMidlands? No offense intended. The skies speak the truth to me. I’m sure you canunderstand my position.”Richard leaned toward the pompous ambassador. “You are rapidly running out oftime, ambassador. You had better be prepared to surrender Jara soon, or I willsee to it-my way. Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re going to get some fresh air.It suddenly stinks in here.” Tristan Bashkar’s expression darkened.When his eyes turned toward Kahlan again, Richard yanked the knife fromTristan’s belt scabbard before he could so much as blink. Everyone froze.Richard pressed the point to the man’s chest.“And if I ever again catch your lecherous eyes anywhere on Kahlan but her face,I’ll cut out your heart.”Richard turned and loosed the knife, burying it in a round oak ball atop anearby newel. The twang echoed through the marble halls. Without waiting for aresponse, he took Kahlan by the arm and marched away, his golden cloak billowingout behind. Kahlan’s face was red. The two Mord-Sith followed, grinning broadly.Drefan smiled, too, as he followed after. Nadine showed no reaction."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 51In the distance, a dog barked as Richard led them lip the cobbled alley. Hebrought his escorts to a halt outside the small yard behind the Andersonfamily’s home. The yard was still cluttered with cutoffs, wood scraps, shavings,stickered lumber, and the two carving benches.Richard heard neither the sound of wood being worked nor voices. He swung openthe gate and made his way through the clutter. The workshop remained silent. Aknock produced no response. Richard pushed open one of the double doors andcalled out. There was no reply.“Clive!” Richard called again. “Darby! Erling! Is anyone home?” Old chairs andtemplates still hung from pegs on the dusty walls, and the cobwebs still hung inall the corners. Upstairs, instead of the aroma of meat pies and boilingturnips, like the last time Richard had been to the Anderson home. there was theheavy stench of death.In one of the chairs he had made sat Clive Anderson. He was dead. In his arms,he was holding the stiff corpse of his wife.Richard stood stunned at the sight. Behind, he heard Kahlan let out a mournfulcry.Drefan went to the bedrooms. After a brief look. he returned and shook his head.Richard stood staring at the dead husband and wife. He tried to imagine Clive’smisery as he sat there, sick with the plague, holding his dead wife in his arms-his dreams and hopes dead in his arms.Drefan eased a hand under Richard’s arm and pulled him away. “Richard, there’snothing to be done. We’d best go and have a dead-cart sent.” Kahlan pressed herface against his shoulder as she wept. He saw the stricken look on the faces ofBerdine and Raina. He saw their fingers find one another and curl together-afurtive comforting touch. Nadine glanced away from the rest of them. Richardfelt sudden sorrow for her: she was alone among them. Thankfully, Drefan resteda comforting hand on her shoulder. The room droned with painful silence.Richard held Kahlan to him as they went down the stairs. The others followedbehind. When they reached the workshop, he took a breath, at last. The stenchupstairs had nearly gagged him.Just then. Erling. the grandfather, walked through the door. He started atseeing the six people standing in his workshop.“I’m sorry. Erling.” Richard said. “We didn’t mean to invade your home. We cameto check. We came...”Erling nodded distantly. “My boy’s dead. Hattie. too. I had to... go out. Icouldn’t carry them by myself.”“We’ll have a cart sent right away. There are some soldiers on the next streetover. I’ll send them right away to help you.” Erling nodded again. “That wouldbe kind of you.”“The... rest of them? Are they-”Erling’s bloodshot eyes turned up. “My wife, daughter, son, his wife, Darby, andlittle Lily-all dead.” His mouth worked as his eyes watered up. “Beth, sherecovered. Got well again, she did. I couldn’t care for her. I just now took herto Hattie’s sister. So far, their home is still sound.”Richard laid a hand gently on Erling’s arm. “I’m so sorry. Dear spirits. I’m sosorry.”Erling nodded. “Thank you.” He cleared his throat. “Long as I’ve lived, you’dthink it would be me, not the young ‘uns. The spirits weren’t fair in this. Notfair at all.”“I know,” Richard said. “They’re at a place of peace now. We all go there,sooner or later. They’ll be with you again.”Out in the alley, after they had made sure that Erling didn’t need anything,they all paused to gather their wits.“Raina,” Richard said, “please run over to the next street, where we saw thosesoldiers. Get them over here right now. Tell them to get those bodies out ofthere for Erling.”“Of course,” she said before dashing away. Her dark braid flew behind as sheran.“I don’t know what to do,” Richard whispered. “What do you do for someone whohas just lost his whole family? Everyone he loved? I felt a fool. I didn’t knowwhat to say.”Drefan squeezed Richard’s shoulder. “You said the right things, Richard. Youdid.”“He took comfort in your words, Richard,” Nadine said. “That was all you coulddo.”“All I can do,” Richard repeated as he stared off.Kahlan squeezed his hand. Berdine’s hand touched his. He gripped it. The threeof them stood linked in shared sorrow.Richard paced as he waited for Raina to return. The sun was almost down. Itwould be dark before they got back to the palace. The least he could do was waituntil Erling had help getting his dead son and daughter-in-law out of the house.Kahlan and Berdine stood close together, leaning against the wall beside theAndersons’ yard. Drefan, hands clasped behind his back, looking to be lost inthought, strolled a ways back down the alley. Nadine went to the other side ofthe alley, alone, and leaned against the clapboard wall.Richard paced as he thought about the Temple of the Winds and the magic stolenby Jagang’s order. Richard could think of no way to stop this slaughter. When hethought about Tristan Bashkar’s eyes on Kahlan. Richard’s blood boiled.Richard paused. His head came up. Nadine was behind him. He had the oddestsensation.The hair on the back of his neck stiffened. Richard heard the air whine as hespun.The world slowed. Sound dragged. He floated as he moved. The air felt as thickas mud. Everyone seemed a statue in his vision. Time was his.His arm stretched out as he drifted ahead. He commanded the thickness of theair. In the eerie silence, he could hear the feathers singing. He could hear thehiss of blade. Time was his. Nadine’s startled blink took forever. He closed hisfist.With a slam of sound, the world crashed back with a wild rush. In his fist,Richard held a bolt from a crossbow. The blade wasn’t three inches from Nadine’swide eyes.A fraction of a second more and it would have killed her. That fraction of asecond had been an hour to him.“Richard.” Nadine panted, “how did you catch that arrow? I hope you canunderstand that it gives me the creeps. Not that I’m complaining.” she was quickto add.Drefan was there, his jaw hanging open. “How did you do that?” he whispered.“I’m a wizard, remember?” Richard said as he turned, looking in the directionfrom which the arrow had come. He thought he saw movement. Kahlan clutched atrembling Nadine. “Are you all right?” Nadine nodded and let out a belated,frightened cry as Kahlan pulled her to her in a reassuring embrace.Richard’s eyes locked on a movement as his fist snapped the arrow in half. Hetook off. running. Berdine raced after him..Richard turned as he ran. “Find some soldiers! I want this whole area closedoff! I want him caught!”Berdine cut down a street, going after soldiers. Richard ran like the wind on astorm. Rage inundated him. Someone had tried to kill Nadine.In that instant, Nadine wasn’t a woman sent by Shota to marry him. a woman whowas causing him trouble; in that instant, she was simply an old friend fromhome. The full fury of the magic took him.Buildings flashed by. Dogs barked as he raced past. People in the alley criedout and dived for safety. A woman screamed as she cowered against a small,crooked storage building.Richard vaulted the low board fence where he had seen the movement. In mid-leap,he drew his sword. The air rang with the unique sound of steel.He rolled as he landed, coming to his feet with the sword in both hands. Hefound himself face-to-face with a white goat. There was no man there. A crossbowlay on the ground, between the board fence and a squat goat shed.Richard looked around in all directions. Sheets and shirts hung from lines. Awoman, her hair wrapped in a blue scarf, stood on a balcony beyond the flappinglaundry.Richard slid his sword back into its scabbard and cupped his hands around hismouth. “Did you see a man here?” he yelled up at the woman.She lifted her arm, pointing off to her right. “I saw someone running that way,”she called from the distance.Richard dashed off in the direction the woman had pointed. The alley narrowed.Beyond the tunnel of buildings, the passageway opened onto a street. He lookedboth ways.He seized the arm of a young woman. “A man came through here. Which way did hego?”In fright she tried to pull away, at the same time holding her hat on with herother hand. ‘There be people all about. Which man?”Richard released her arm. Up the street to his left, he saw a man righting anoverturned handcart full of fresh greens. The man looked up when Richard skiddedto a panting halt before him.“What did he look like? The man who ran through here-what did he look like?”The man straightened his broad-rimmed hat. “Don’t know.” He pointed. “I waslooking for a good spot. I heard the sound as my cart fell over. I saw a darkshape, running up that way.”Richard ran on. The ancient part of the city branched into a warren of alleys,streets, and twisting passageways. Only by keeping track of the golden glow inthe western sky could he keep his bearings. That didn’t mean, though, that theman he chased had run in a specific direction. He was probably just running,trying to get away.Richard came across a patrol of a dozen soldiers. Before they had time tosalute, he was talking.“A man came running through here, somewhere. Did any of you see him?”“We saw no one running. What did he look like?”“I don’t know. He attacked us with a crossbow and then ran. I want him found.Spread out and start searching.”Before they could be on their way, Raina came running up the street with a goodfifty men.“Did you see where he went?” she asked, gasping for breath. “No. I lost him inhere somewhere. I want all of you to spread out and find him.”One of the soldiers, a sergeant, spoke up. “Lord Rahl, a man who wants to escapewould make himself obvious by running. A man with any sense at all would simplyround a corner and walk away.”The sergeant gestured back up the street to make his point. There were peopleeverywhere going about their business, although a good many were staring at theexcitement on their street. Any number of them could have been the man he waschasing.“Any idea at all what this assassin looks like?”Richard shook his head in frustration. “I never got a look at him.” He rakedback his hair as he caught his breath. “Split up. Half of you go back in thedirection we came from. Question everyone you can find, to see if anyone got alook at him, at a man running. He may be walking now, but until he got somewherealong in here he was running.”Raina, Agiel in hand, took up her defensive position close beside him. “The restof you come with me,” Richard said. “We’ll pick up some more men. I want to keepsearching. Maybe we’ll come across someone walking and he’ll panic and try torun again. If he does, I want him. Alive.”It was late in the night by the time they returned to the Confessors’ Palace.Soldiers there were already on high alert. Men stood with swords and battle-axesto hand, arrows nocked, and spears levelled. Others patrolled the expansivegrounds. A mouse wouldn’t have escaped their intense scrutiny.As Kahlan, Berdine. Raina, Drefan, and Nadine accompanied him into the gatheringhall inside. Richard saw Tristan Bashkar waiting there, hands clasped behind hisback as he paced. He halted and looked up when he heard them coming.Richard drifted to a stop as the contrite-looking ambassador approached. Thoseescorting Richard gathered in a knot behind him. except Kahlan, who stood closeat his side. With a hand in the air. Tristan hailed them. “Lord Rahl, may I havea word with you, please?”Richard swept his gaze over the man. noticing that he didn’t rest his hand on ahip so as to show off his fancy knife. Richard held up a finger. “One moment,please.”Richard turned a little to the rest of them. “It’s late. We have a lot of workto do, so I want you to get some rest. Berdine, I want you to go up to the Keepand stand guard with Cara tonight.” Berdine frowned. “Both of us?”Richard scowled. “Isn’t that what I said? Yes, both of you. With this trouble, Idon’t want to take any chances.”“I will guard the Mother Confessor’s room, then.” Raina said. “No,” Richardlifted a thumb. “I want you guarding Nadine’s room. She was the one who wasattacked.”“Yes, Lord Rahl,” Raina stammered. “I’ll see to setting up a guard of soldiersoutside the Mother Confessor’s room. then.”“If I wanted soldiers around Kahlan’s room. I’d have told you so. now wouldn’tI?” Raina’s face reddened. “I want all the soldiers doing their jobs patrollingthe entrances, the palace grounds, and a perimeter around the grounds. Every oneof them! The danger is from out there, not in here. Kahlan is perfectly safeinside the palace. I don’t want men who should be guarding outside insteadsitting on their bottoms around Kahlan’s room inside. I’ll not have it, do youhear me?”“But, Lord Rahl-”“Don’t question me. I’m not in the mood.”Kahlan touched his arm. “Richard.” she whispered, “are you sure that-”“Someone tried to kill Nadine. They nearly succeeded. Or did some of you missthe significance of that? I’ll not take any more chances. I want her protected,and I don’t want to hear any more arguments. Drefan, I want you to startcarrying a sword at once. Healers are a target.” Everyone stared at the floor insilence. “Good.” Richard turned his glare on Tristan. “What is it?” Tristanspread his hands. “Lord Rahl, I just wanted to say that I’m sorry. I realize Iseemed insensitive, but I’ve been worried about the people here who are sick anddying. It set my nerves on edge. I meant to cause no ill will between us. I hopeyou will accept my apology.”Richard studied Tristan’s eyes. “Yes. of course. Apology accepted, and I’m sorrythat I lost my temper. I, too, have been out of sorts.” Richard put a hand onNadine’s shoulder. “Someone tried to kill one of my healers-a person devoted tohelping others. People are beginning to blame healers because the plaguecontinues to spread. I can’t allow harm to come to people who are only tryingtheir best to help.”“Yes, of course. You are most kind to accept my apology. Thank you. Lord Rahl.”“Just don’t forget, ambassador, that your time runs out tomorrow.”Tristan bowed. “I realize that, and you will know my stand by tomorrow. LordRahl. You have my word. Good night, then.”Richard rounded on the rest of them. “We have a lot of work to do tomorrow. It’svery late. As Drefan is constantly reminding me, we need to get some sleep. Youall have your orders. Any questions’?” Each answered with a silent shake of thehead.Two hours after they had returned to the palace, and Richard had sent them allto bed, Kahlan thought she saw something move in her room.The lamp on the far wall was turned down low. The clouds hid the moon, so therewas no light coming in the glassed doors to the balcony. The thick carpetssilenced the sound of footsteps, if there were any. The weak flame from the lampwas all that betrayed the shape she thought she saw.Another motion came from across the room-a hint of shadowed movement. She hadn’tseen a person enter her rooms; it could be nothing other than her imagination.The day had left her in an edgy state.With the next silent step, there was no doubt: there was someone in her room.Someone slipped ever closer to her bed. As furtive as the movements were, he hadclosed the distance in remarkably short order.Kahlan didn’t move a muscle as she saw the knife glint in the dim lamplight. Sheheld her breath.A powerful arm stabbed hatefully into her bed. The arm rose and fell, stabbingin quick succession.With a finger, Richard pushed on the balcony door. It swung open on silenthinges. Berdine glided across the room the instant Richard gave her a handsignal. When she was in place, he tapped the glass once. Berdine turned up thewick on the lamp.Tristan Bashkar straightened beside Kahlan’s bed, knife in hand, panting withthe effort of what he had just been doing.“Toss down the knife, ambassador,” Richard said in a quiet tone. Tristan spunthe knife in his fingers, seizing the blade in preparation to throw it.Berdine’s Agiel to the back of his neck dropped him instantly. She pressed theAgiel down on his shoulder to support herself as she bent and picked up theknife. Tristan howled in pain.Berdine straightened, coming up with three knives. “You were right, Richard,”Drefan said from behind. “I can’t believe it,” Nadine said as she stepped upinto the lamplight. “Believe it,” General Kerson said as he, too, came in fromthe balcony. “I’d say Tristan Bashkar has nullified his immunity as a diplomat.”Richard put two fingers between his lips and whistled. Raina charged through thedoor ahead of a large contingent of D’Haran soldiers bristling steel. Two ofthem lit more lamps.Richard hooked his thumbs behind his belt as he stood beside Kahlan, a toweringblack form defined with gold trim on his tunic and silver ornaments, buckles,and wristbands, watching the soldiers haul Tristan to his feet.“You were right, Richard,” she said. “He attacked Nadine to draw the guard offme. It was me he was after all along.”For a while, she had thought he had lost his mind. His performance had convincedeveryone, including Tristan. “Thanks for believing me.” Richard whispered.When he had first told her what he was doing. Kahlan had suspected that Richardhad accused Tristan because of the incident earlier. Kahlan had not put words toit, but she had wondered if Richard was simply acting out of jealousy.Since she had told him what Shota said, he had now twice displayed jealousy.something she had never before seen from him. He didn’t have any reason to bejealous, but Shota’s words played on his mind. casting in doubt.Whenever she looked at Nadine. Kahlan understood his feelings. Whenever she sawNadine so much as standing near him. Kahlan felt the hot claws of jealousy rakethrough her insides.She knew that Shota and the spirit had told her the truth. She knew that shewould not have Richard. Her mind tried to put rational thought to it. to tellher that it would work out. that they would be together, but her heart knewbetter. Richard would marry Nadine. Kahlan would marry another man.Richard refused to believe it. At least, he said he refused to believe it. Shewondered.In her mind’s eye, Kahlan saw Clive Anderson, sitting dead in his chair, holdinghis dead wife. In comparison to the tragedy that had befallen the Andersonfamily and so many others, what price was an unhappy marriage? Wouldn’t it beworth that price, if it would stop the appalling suffering and death?Nadine slipped up next to Richard on the other side. “Drawing the guard offKahlan or not. I’d have been dead. Thank you, Richard. I’ve never seen anythinglike the way you caught that arrow right in front of my face.”Richard gave her a quick, one-armed hug. “Nadine, you’ve said thank you enoughtimes. You’d have done the same for me.”Kahlan felt those hot claws again. She suppressed the feeling. As Shota hadsaid. if she loved him, she would want him to have at least the small comfort ofit being someone he knew.“But what if he had killed me? I mean. if he just wanted to draw the guard awayfrom Kahlan, what if he had killed me? What good would that have that done him?”“He knows I have the gift, and counted on that. If he had happened to kill you.it might still have worked, or he could have faked something similar withDrefan. reinforcing our belief that the target was healers and not Kahlan.”“Why didn’t he just shoot Kahlan with the arrow?”Richard watched the one-sided struggle on the other side of Kahlan’s bed.“Because he likes to use that knife of his. He wanted to feel it when he killedher.”His words gave Kahlan a chill. She knew Tristan; Richard might be right. Tristanwould have gotten pleasure from it.The soldiers wrestled Tristan’s arms behind his back as they hauled him to hisfeet. He was still full of fight, but he was grossly overpowered. More lampswere lit as the room filled with soldiers.Kahlan felt embarrassed to have all those people in her bedroom. She guessed itwas because the Mother Confessor’s rooms had always been a private sanctuary. Asafe place.A man had invaded that sanctuary. A man intent on stabbing her to death. “What’sthis all about?” Tristan shouted.“Oh, we just thought we’d like to watch a man stabbing a nightdress stuffed withtow,” Richard said.General Kerson inspected the prisoner to assure himself that Berdine had foundall his weapons. When he was satisfied, he turned to Richard. “What would youlike done, Lord Rahl?”“Behead him.”Kahlan turned in shock. “Richard, you can’t do that.”“You saw him. He thought he was killing you.”“But he didn’t. He only stabbed my empty bed. The spirits mark a differencebetween intent and deed.”“He tried to kill Nadine, too.”“I did no such thing!” Tristan shouted. “That wasn’t me- I haven’t even left thepalace tonight!”Richard turned a cold glare on Tristan. “You have white hairs on your knees.White goat hairs. You knelt behind that fence while you aimed the crossbow, andgot the goat hairs on you.”Kahlan glanced down, and saw that Richard was right. “You’re crazy! I neverdid!”“Richard,” Kahlan said, “he didn’t kill Nadine, either. He may have tried, buthe didn’t. You can’t execute him for intent.”Richard closed his fist around the amulet at his chest, the amulet representingthe dance with death. No mercy.The general’s eyes left Kahlan and returned to Richard. “Lord Rahl?”“Richard,” Kahlan insisted, “you can’t.”Richard glared at Tristan. “He killed those women. He sliced them up with hisfancy knife. You like to cut people, don’t you, Tristan?”“What are you talking about? I never killed anyone-except in war!”“No,” Richard said, “and you didn’t try to kill Kahlan, and you didn’t try tokill Nadine, and there aren’t white goat hairs on your pants.”Tristan’s panicked brown eyes turned to Kahlan. “Mother Confessor, I didn’t killyou, I didn’t kill her. You said it yourself, the spirits mark a differencebetween intent and deed. I didn’t kill anyone. You can’t let him do this!”Kahlan recalled the whispers about Tristan, the whispers that when he went intobattle he drew his knife instead of his sword, and that he got sadistic pleasurefrom cutting people.Those women were killed for sadistic pleasure.“What was it you told me, Tristan? That you often had to resort to the charms ofcoin for the company of a woman? And that if you broke our rules, you wouldexpect to be subjected to our choice of punishment?”“What about a trial? I’ve killed no one! Intent is not the same as deed!”“And what was your intent, Tristan?” Richard asked. “Why did you intend to killKahlan?”“It wasn’t because I wanted to. It wasn’t for pleasure, as you think. It was tosave lives.”Richard lifted an eyebrow. “Killing to save lives?”“You’ve killed people. You don’t do it for the pleasure of killing, but to savethe lives of innocent people. That’s all I’m guilty of-trying to save innocentlives. “The Imperial Order sent representatives to the royal palace in Sandilar.They told us to join with them. or die. Javas Kedar. our star guide, told me fmust watch the skies for a sign.“When the red moons came. and the plague started. I knew what they meant. I wasgoing to kill the Mother Confessor in order to try to gain favor with the Order.so that they wouldn’t send the plague to us. too. I was only trying to save mypeople.”Richard’s eyes turned to Kahlan. “How far is Sandilar?”“A month, there and back. Maybe a few days less.”Richard looked back at the general. “Get some officers together to take commandof the Jarian forces and capital. Have them take Tristan’s head to the royalfamily and tell them that he was executed for attempting to kill the MotherConfessor.“The officers are to offer Jara surrender to D’Hara under the peaceful termsalready offered. It’s a month, there and back. The king himself is to returnwith the surrender documents. I expect him. and the D’Haran guard sent toaccompany him. back here within one month from tomorrow.“Tell the king that if they don’t surrender, and our men don’t return safely. Iwill personally ride into Sandilar at the head of an army and I will beheadevery member of the royal family. We will then conquer Jara and occupy thecapital. The occupation will not be friendly.”General Kerson clapped a fist to the chain mail over his heart. “It will be asyou say. Lord Rahl.”“Richard.” Kahlan whispered, “what if what he says is true-that he didn’t killthose women? I could touch him with my Confessor’s power, and we would know forsure.”“No! I’ll not have you touching him. or hearing the things he did to thosewomen. He’s a monster: I don’t want you to have to touch him.”“But what if he’s telling the truth? What if he didn’t kill those women?”Richard’s fist gripped the amulet at his chest. “I’m not having him put to deathfor the murder of those women. He tried to kill you. I saw it. As far as I’mconcerned. the intent is the same as the deed. He is going to pay for theintent, the same as he would have paid for the deed.”Richard turned a cold, dark glare back to the soldiers. “Last night alone, threehundred people died of the plague. He would have joined with the murders whocaused it. I want the men on their way to Jara first thing in the morning, and Iwant his head to go with them. You have your orders. Get him out of here.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 52When she saw Drefan coming from the other direction, Kahlan set down the basketof clean bandages and rags she was carrying. Even though Richard had onlyordered it as part of his ruse to convince Tristan that his plan was working,Drefan was still wearing a sword. Perhaps it wasn’t such a bad idea. Some peoplewere beginning to resent healers because they spoke out against the potions andcures being sold on the streets. She brushed back her hair. “How are they?”Drefan sighed as he glanced back up the hall. “One died last night. Most areworse. We have six new ones today.”“Dear spirits,” she whispered, “what is to happen to us?” Drefan lifted herchin. “We will persevere.”Kahlan nodded. “Drefan, if so many of the staff are coming down sick, and somany have died already, what good is this infernal smoke doing? I’m sick ofbreathing it.”“The smoke is doing no good for the plague.” Kahlan blinked up at him. “Then whymust we keep doing it?” Drefan smiled sadly. “The people think it helps keep theplague from being worse. It makes them feel better that we’re doing something,and that there is hope. If we stop, then they will think there is no hope.”“Is there? Is there any hope?”“I don’t know,” he whispered. “Have you heard last night’s report yet?”He nodded. “In the last week the number of dead has continued to rise. Lastnight it was up to over six hundred.”Kahlan looked away despondently. “I wish we could do something.” Shota had toldher that a way would come. The spirit had told her that a way would come. Shecouldn’t bear the thought of losing Richard, but she also couldn’t bear thethought of all the people who were dying. “Well,” Drefan said, “I’m going tomake my rounds through the city.” Kahlan clasped his forearm. He flinched. Itwas a reaction that she, as a Confessor, was used to. She took her hand back. “Iknow you can do nothing to stop it, but thank you for all your aid anyway. Justyour words help those living to have hope.”“A healer’s best aid, words. Most of the time it’s all we can do to help. Mostpeople think being a healer means healing people. That actually happens rarely.I learned a long time ago that being a healer means living with pain andsuffering.”“How’s Richard? Have you seen him this morning?”“He’s in his office. He looked fine. I made him get some sleep.”“Good. He needed rest.” Drefan’s blue eyes searched hers. “He did what he had towith that man who tried to kill you, but I know that despite how resolute heappeared, it was a terribly hard thing for him to do. Killing a man, even onewho richly deserves it. is not something that comes easily to Richard.”“I know.” Kahlan said. “I know that condemning a man to death weighs heavily onhim. I, myself, have had to order the deaths of people. In a time of peace, youhave the luxury of order, but in war you must act. Hesitation is death.”“And have you told that to Richard?”Kahlan smiled. “Of course I have. He knows he did what he had to. and that thoseof us close to him understand. In his place I would have done the same. and Itold him so.”“Someday. I hope to have a woman of half your strength.” Drefan smiled. “To saynothing of your beauty. Well, I must be off.”Kahlan watched him walk away. His trousers were still too tight. She blushed atthe thought, and turned back to her work.Nadine was in the sick room, tending to people in two rows of beds. Theinfirmary held twenty beds, and they were all full, with more people on blanketson the floor. There were others sick in other rooms.“Thanks,” Nadine said, when Kahlan set down the clean things she had brought.Nadine was putting herbs in pots, making teas. Other women who tended the sickwere changing sheets, cleaning and wrapping open sores, or serving tea to thepatients.Nadine plucked a cloth from the basket, dipped it in a basin of water, wrung itout, and laid it across the forehead of a moaning woman. Nadine patted thewoman’s shoulder.“There you go, dear. How does that feel?” The woman managed only a weak smileand nod.Kahlan did the same for several more people, dabbing a cool, damp cloth to theirsweaty faces, offering soft words of comfort.“You could be a healer,” Nadine said as she paused beside Kahlan. “You have akind touch.”“That’s the only thing I know to do. I couldn’t heal anyone.” Nadine leanedclose. “And do you think I am?”Kahlan glanced around the room. “I see what you mean. But at least you havedevoted your life to helping people. My life is devoted to duty. To fighting.”“What do you mean?”“In the end, I am a warrior. My duty is to hurt people in order to save others.It is left to people like you to heal those remaining, when people like me arefinished fighting.”Nadine stood close to her. “Sometimes, I wish I was a warrior, and could fightto end the suffering, so that there wouldn’t be so many wounded for the healersto tend to.”Kahlan finally had to leave the room. She couldn’t stand the stink, and thesmoke was making her sick. Nadine felt the same, and went with her. They bothslid their backs down the wall and sat on the floor.“I feel helpless,” Nadine said. “Back home, if someone had a headache. I’d givehim something and he’d get to feeling better. If a woman was pregnant. I’d helpsettle her stomach, or I’d help deliver the baby when it was time. It seemed Iwas always helping people. “This is different. All I do is comfort people whoare going to die, and wonder the whole time if it will be me on the bedtomorrow. I don’t know what to do for any of them. I feel totally useless. Iwish I’d come here to help these people, instead of watching them die.”“I know,” Kahlan whispered. “It must have been a lot more satisfying to help awoman deliver a baby.”Nadine stared off in thought. “Sometimes a woman would tell me that it seemedlike it would never happen, that it seemed unreal. She’d wait, knowing it wouldhappen, but never really believing it, dreading the things she’d heard about howhard it would be. Dreading the pain. Sometimes they think things will change,like they’ll wake up one day and not be pregnant, or something.“Then, the baby would come. Suddenly, she’ll be in a panic. The time has come.She’ll be terrified that it’s really happening, at last. Sometimes they’llscream just from that fear, the fear of the pain. That’s when I can help them.I’m there with them. I reassure them that it will be all right.“For the first time, for some of them, they finally believe it’s happening. Iguess it’s only natural to dread such a profound change in their lives. Untilit’s over, until the day is upon them, some of them are miserable with dread.”Together, in the silence of the hall, they sat, resting, listening to the moansfrom the sick room.“Nadine, you still think you will end up marrying Richard, don’t you?” Nadineglanced over, scratching her freckled nose, but she didn’t answer. “I didn’t askthat to-to start in on you, or anything. I just meant, well, like you said, youmight end up on one of those beds in there. I was just thinking... it could beme, too. I could get the plague, or something.” Nadine watched her. “You won’t.Don’t say that. You won’t get it.” Kahlan ran her thumbnail along a joint in thefloorboards. “But I could. I was just thinking that if I did, or something,well, what about Richard? He’d be alone.”“What are you saying?”Kahlan looked into Nadine’s soft brown eyes. “If for some reason you ended upbeing the one with him, instead of me, you’d be good to him, wouldn’t you? You’dalways be good to him?” Nadine swallowed. “Of course I would.”“I’m serious, Nadine. There’s so much happening. I want to know that youwouldn’t ever hurt him.”“I’d never hurt Richard.”“You hurt him before.”Nadine turned away and scratched her shoulder. “That was different. I was tryingto win him. I would have done anything to get him to be with me. I alreadyexplained it to you.”“I know.” Kahlan picked at a little stone stuck in the crack between thefloor-boards. “But if something happened, and it turned out that you were... theone, the one to marry him, I want to know that you’d never do anything like thatto him again.“I’d like to hear it from you, that you would never do anything to hurt Richard.Anything.”Nadine met Kahlan’s eyes for a moment before glancing away. “If I ever ended upwith Richard, I would make him the happiest man in the world. I’d take the bestcare of him that any woman ever took of any man. I would love him betterthan-well. I’d do my very best to make him happy.”Kahlan felt the familiar pain gnaw at her insides. She endured it. “Do you swearthat that’s the truth?”“Yes.”Kahlan looked away and wiped at her eyes. “Thanks. Nadine. That’s what I wantedto know.”“Why are you asking me such a thing?”Kahlan cleared her throat. “As I said. I’m worried that I might get the plague,too. If anything happens, I could bear it better if I knew that there wassomeone who would take care of Richard.”“Near as I can figure, Richard pretty much takes care of himself. Do you knowthat that man can cook better than me?” Kahlan laughed. Nadine laughed with her.“Isn’t that the truth?” Kahlan said. “I guess, where Richard is concerned, awoman can only hope to go along with him for the ride.”“Lord Rahl!”Richard turned to see General Kerson calling out for him. He let go of Kahlan’shand. Cara glided to a stop behind Kahlan. “Yes, what is it, general?”The general came to a halt, waving a letter. A dusty, tired-looking soldierfollowed behind, along with the general’s usual guard.“A message from General Reibisch, with his army to the south.” The generallifted a thumb. “Grissom here just rode in.”Richard glanced to the young soldier, still panting to get his breath. Hesmelled like a horse. Richard thought he would much rather smell like a horseand be out riding than sitting in a little room day after day translating themad account of a trial and execution. He guessed that if his labors were doinghim any good, he might feel differently.He broke the seal and opened the letter. When he finished reading it. he handedthe letter to Kahlan.“Take a look.” While Kahlan read the letter, Richard turned to the messenger.“How is our army to the south doing?”“Fine when I left them, Lord Rahl.” Grissom said. “The Sisters of the Lightcaught up with us, as they said you told them to do. They’re all together withour men. We’re awaiting orders.”The letter had said much the same thing. When Kahlan had finished reading,Richard took the letter and handed it to General Kerson. The general idlyscratched his greying hair as he read the letter. He looked up when he hadfinished. “What do you think. Lord Rahl?”“Makes sense to me. I don’t think we should bring all those men back up northright now. As General Reibisch says, they would be in a position to know aboutit if the Order moves very far into the New World. What do you think?” Richardasked, as he passed the letter back to Cara.The general hiked up his trousers. “I agree with Reibisch. I’d want to do thesame if I were him. He’s already down there, why not put him to good use? As hesays, it would be best to know what the Order is up to, and if the enemy doescome up north to attack us, he will be in a position to bite their ass.” Hewinced. “Sorry, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan smiled. “My father was a warrior, general, before he was king. It bringsback memories.” She didn’t say if they were good memories. “I also agree aboutthe strategic advantage of having an army in that position.”Cara handed the letter back to Richard. “He’s right about one other thing, too.If he abandons his position, and the Order went to the northeast, they would beable to sweep into D’Hara unopposed. We wouldn’t even know about it. That partof D’Hara is sparsely populated. The Order could drive north and we would neverknow it until they cut west, back into the Midlands.”“Unless they pushed straight for the People’s Palace,” the general said. “Thatwould be a fatal mistake-attacking the heart of D’Hara,” Cara said. “CommanderGeneral Trimack of the First File of the Palace Guard would show the enemy whyno army has ever attacked the palace and had so much as a single soldier live torecount the tale of their bloody defeat. The cavalry would cut them to piecesout on the Azrith Plains.”“She’s right,” the general said. “If the enemy goes there, the vultures willfeast-Trimack will see to that. If they did go northeast up into D’Hara, itwould be to flank us. Best to have Reibisch guarding the gate.” Richard hadanother reason to want General Reibisch’s army to stay south. “Lord Rahl,” themessenger asked, “may I ask a question?”“Of course. What is it?”Grissom fussed with the hilt of his short sword. “What’s going on in the city? Imean, I saw men hauling carts with dead people, and I saw others going throughthe streets calling for people to bring out their dead.”Richard took a deep breath. “That’s the other reason we want General Reibisch tostay down south. The plague is loose in the Midlands. Last night, seven hundredfifty people died.”“The spirits preserve us.” Grissom wiped his palms on his hips. “I was afraid itmight be something like that.”“I want you to take my reply back to General Reibisch. Having been here, I don’twant you to carry the plague to him, too. When you get back, you are to pass mymessage along verbally.“Don’t approach any of his men, or any people for that matter, any closer thanyou must in order to be heard. When you get to their sentries, tell them to passthe message on to the general. Tell him that I find his reasoning to be sound.All of the command here agrees with him. Tell him to carry on with his plans andto keep us informed.“Now that you’ve been here, you can’t return to those men. You’ll have to comeback here, when you’ve delivered the message. I want you to take a good-sizedpatrol with you to make sure you get our instructions through, then all of youcome back here.”Grissom saluted with a fist to his heart. “It shall be as you command, LordRahl.”“I wish I could let you return to your men, soldier, but we’re trying to keepthe plague from getting to the army. We have the soldiers here spread out aroundthe city so they don’t come down sick. You can tell them that, too.”General Kerson scratched his face. “Ah, Lord Rahl, I have to talk to you aboutthat. I just found out myself.”Richard frowned at the general’s sudden wincing expression. “What is it?”“Ah. well, the plague has gotten to our men.”Richard felt his heart in his throat. “Which group?”The general wiped a hand across his mouth. “All of them. Lord Rahl. Seems thatthe prostitutes have been visiting the camps. The women thought it would besafer than plying their trade in the city, what with those murders. I don’t knowanything about how sickness spreads, but Drefan told me that that might havebeen the way it happened.”Richard squeezed his temples between his thumb and second finger. He wanted togive up. He wanted to simply sit down on the floor and give up.“I should never have had Tristan Bashkar put to death. I should have let himkill all those women. In the end, it would have saved countless lives. If I’dhave known this. I’d have killed them all myself.” He felt Kahlan’s hand touchhis back in sympathy.“Dear spirits,” he whispered. He could think of nothing else to say. “Dearspirits, what are we doing to ourselves? Those women have just unwittinglystruck a blow for Jagang.”“Do you want them executed. Lord Rahl?” General Kerson asked. “No,” Richard saidin a quiet voice. “The deed is done. It would serve no purpose, now. They didn’tdo it intentionally to cause harm. They were just trying to keep themselvessafe.”Richard recalled the words of one of the temple team before he was put to death.I can no longer countenance what we do with our gift. We are not the Creator,nor are we the Keeper. Even a vexatious prostitute has the right to live herlife.“Grissom, get a patrol together, and as soon as you’ve had some food and rest,get my message back to General Reibisch.”Grissom saluted again. “Yes, Lord Rahl. I’ll get some food and supplies and beon my way within the hour.” Richard nodded. The messenger took his leave.“Lord Rahl,” the general said, “if there’s nothing else, I’d better see to myduties.”“Yes, general, there is one more thing. Cut the sick soldiers out of the camps.Put them in a separate camp. Let’s see if we can limit the extent of theoutbreak. Who knows, maybe we can even contain it.“And I don’t want any prostitutes in the camps. None. Maybe we can keep thedistemper lighter, that way. Have all the women warned to stay away underpenalty of death. Post archers with the sentries. If they continue to approachafter being challenged, have the archers cut them down.”The general heaved a sigh. “I understand. Lord Rahl. I’ll also separate out themen who have been with those women and have them tend to the sick soldiers.”“Good idea.”Richard put his arm around Kahlan’s waist as he watched the general and hisguard hurry to their tasks. “Why didn’t I think of that before? I might havekept the plague from the soldiers if only I’d thought of it.” Kahlan didn’t havean answer.“Lord Rahl,” Cara said, “I’m going up to the sliph to relieve Berdine.”“I’ll go with you. I want to see if Berdine has learned anything from thejournal. Besides, I need to get out of here for a while. You want to go, too?”he asked Kahlan. Her arm tightened around him. ‘Id like that.”Berdine was bent over the journal, reading. The sliph looked Richard’s waybefore Berdine did.“Do you wish to travel, Master? You will be pleased.”“No,” Richard said when the echo of the eerie voice had died out. “Thank you,sliph, but not now.” Berdine leaned back and yawned as she stretched her arms.“Glad to see you,Cara. I can’t stay awake any longer.”“You look like you could use some sleep.” Richard gestured to the open journalon the table before her. “Anything new?” Berdine glanced to the sliph as shestood. She picked up the journal and turned it around, offering it to him. Sheleaned closer and lowered her voice. “You remember telling me about what thatman said before he was put to death.What he said about even a vexatious... woman having a right to her life?”Richard knew what Berdine was talking about. “Yes. You mean Wizard Ricker.”“That’s the one. Well, Kolo mentioned it briefly.” She tapped a place in thejournal. “Read here.” Richard studied the sentence a moment until he had ittranslated in his head.“Ricker’s vexatious prostitute is watching me as I sit here pondering whatdamage the team has done. I heard today that we have lost Lothain. Ricker hashad his revenge.”“Do you know who Lothain is?” Berdine asked. “He was the head prosecutor at theTemple of the Winds trial. He was the one who went to undo the damage done bythe team.” Richard looked up. The sliph was watching him. He stepped closer. Ithad never occurred to him before. Why hadn’t he thought of it before? “Sliph.”“Yes, Master? You wish to travel? Come. You will be pleased.” Richard steppedcloser. “No, I don’t wish to travel, but I would like to talk to you. Do youremember the time, long ago, when there was a great war going on?”“Long? I am long enough to travel. Tell me where you wish to go. You will bepleased.”“No, I don’t mean travelling. Do you remember any names?”“Names?”“Names. Do you remember the name Ricker?” The silver face watched withoutexpression. “I never betray my clients.”“Sliph, you were a person, once, weren’t you? A person like me?” The sliphsmiled. “No.”Richard laid a hand on Kahlan’s shoulder. “A person like this?” The silver smilewidened. “Yes. I was a whore, like her.” Kahlan cleared her throat. “I thinkRichard meant to ask if you were a woman, sliph.”“Yes, I was a woman, too.”“What was your name?” Richard asked. “Name?” The sliph frowned, as if puzzled.“I am the sliph.”“Who made you into the sliph?”“Some of my clients.”“Why? Why did they make you into the sliph?”“Because I never reveal my clients.”“Sliph, could you explain that better?”“Some of the wizards here, in this place, were my clients. The most powerful ofthem. I was a very exclusive whore, and very expensive. Many of the wizardscontended for power. Others tried to use me to displace some of those who weremy clients. Some wished to use me for their pleasure, but not the kind ofpleasure I offered. I never reveal my clients.”“You mean they would have been pleased if you told them the names of the wizardswho visited you, and maybe a little more about those visits.”“Yes. My clients feared these others would use me for this pleasure, and so theymade me the sliph.”Richard turned away. He raked his fingers back through his hair. Even as theyfought the enemy, they fought among themselves. When he finally gathered hiswits, he turned back to the beautiful silver face.“Sliph, those men are all dead now. There is no one alive who knows these men.There are no wizards anymore to vie for power. Could you tell me a little more?”“They made me, and told me that I would be unable to speak their names as longas they lived. They said that their power would prevent it. If it is true thattheir spirits have passed from this world, then it will no longer matter and Iwill be able to speak their names.”“It was this man, Lothain, who was one of your clients, wasn’t it? And thisother wizard. Ricker, thought he was a hypocrite.”“Lothain.” The quicksilver face softened as she seemed to test the name. “WizardRicker came to me, and said that this man, Lothain. was the head prosecutor, andthat he was a vile beast, who would turn on me. He wanted my help to deposeLothain. I refused to name my clients.”Richard spoke into the silence. “And Ricker’s words proved true. Lothain turnedon you. and made you into the sliph so that you couldn’t speak out against him.”“Yes. I told Lothain that I did not reveal my clients. I told him that he had noneed to fear me speaking. He said that it didn’t matter, that I was only awhore, and the world would never miss me. He twisted my arm and hurt me. He usedme for his pleasure without my permission. When he finished, he laughed, andthen I saw a flash of light in my mind.“Ricker came to me after, and told me that he would put an end to Lothain, andwizards like him. He wept at the edge of my well, and said he was sorry for whatthey did to me. He told me that he would put a stop to the way magic destroyedpeople.”“Were you sad?” Berdine asked. “Was it sad to be made into the sliph?”“They took sadness from me when they made me.”“Did they take happiness, too?” Kahlan whispered. “They left me with duty.”Even in this, they had made a mistake. They left some of who the sliph had beenso that they could use her. The part they left would submit to anyone with theprice required: magic. They had been tripped up by her nature. They used her.but had to guard her, because she would offer herself to anyone-even theenemy-who had the required price.“Sliph,” Richard said, “I’m so sorry that we wizards did this to you. They hadno right. I’m so sorry.”The sliph smiled. “Wizard Ricker told me that if any Master said those words tome, I should tell them these words from him: ‘Ward left in. Ward right out.Guard your heart from stone.’““What does that mean?”“He did not explain the words to me.”Richard felt sick. Were they going to die because of a three-thousand-year-oldfight for power? Perhaps Jagang was right; perhaps magic had no place in theworld any longer.Richard turned back to the others.“Berdine, you need to get some sleep. Raina has to be up early to relieve Cara.She needs to get to bed, too. Set a guard for Kahlan’s rooms and then both ofyou get some rest. I’ve had enough of this day, too.”Richard was in a dead sleep when he awakened to a hand pushing at him. He sat upand rubbed at his eyes, trying to gather his senses in a panic.“What? What is it?” His voice sounded to him like gravel being poured from abucket.“Lord Rahl?” came a tearful voice. “Are you awake?”Richard squinted up at the figure holding a lamp. At first, he couldn’t make outwho it was.“Berdine?” He had never seen her in anything but her leather uniform before. Shewas standing in his room in a white nightdress. Her hair was down. He had neverseen Berdine without her hair in the single braid. It was a disorienting sight.Richard swung his legs over the edge of the bed and pulled his pants on in arush. “Berdine, what is it? What’s wrong?”She wiped at the tears on her face. “Lord Rahl, please, come.” She let out asob. “Raina is sick.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 53Verna shut the door as silently as she could after Warren dragged the flailingwoman back into the darkness. His hand was clamped just as tightly over hermouth as his web was clamped around her gift. Verna wouldn’t have been able tocontrol the woman’s magic as well as could Warren. The gift of a wizard wasstronger than a sorceress’s-even Verna’s-gift.Verna lit a small flame above her upturned palm. The woman’s eyes widened, andthen filled with tears.“Yes. Janet, it’s me, Verna. If you promise not to cry out and betray us, I willhave Warren release you.”Janet nodded earnestly. Verna gripped her dacra in her other fist, held out ofsight, just in case she was wrong. She gave a nod to Warren, signalling him torelease the young woman.When she was free, Janet flung her arms around Verna’s neck. She rejoiced with asoft sob. Warren held up his palm, letting a small flame dance above it so theycould see. The tiny room was made of huge blocks of dark stone, as was the restof the stronghold. Milky water seeped through some of the joints, leaving trailsof crusty stains down the walls.“Oh, Verna,” Janet whispered, “you have no idea what a joy it is to see yourface.”Verna embraced the trembling woman as she wept softly while clutching at Verna’scloak. Verna still had the dacra in her fist, behind Janet’s back.Verna eased her away to smile at the tear-stained face. She wiped away some ofthe tears, and smoothed back Janet’s dark locks.Janet kissed her ring finger-an ancient gesture beseeching the Creator’sprotection. Even though she had been reasonably sure Janet was loyal to theLight. Verna was relieved to see such confirmation.A Sister of the Dark was sworn to the Keeper of the Underworld, and would neverkiss her ring finger. It was an act that represented a Sister’s symbolicbetrothal to the Creator.It was the one thing that a Sister of the Dark could not do. A Sister of theDark could not hide her loyalty to her true master, the Keeper, by kissing herring finger, for kissing that finger would invoke her dark master’s wrath.Verna slipped the dacra back up her sleeve as Janet glanced back at Warren. Theyexchanged smiles.Both Verna and Warren took in Janet’s bizarre garb. She was barefoot. The baggygarment, cinched at the waist with a white cord. covered her from ankles to neckto wrists, but was so sheer that the woman might as well have been naked.Between a thumb and finger, Verna tugged out some of the diaphanous material.“What in the name of Creation are you doing wearing this?”Janet glanced down at herself. “Jagang makes all his slaves dress like this.After a while, you don’t even notice anymore.”“I see.” Verna could see that Warren was doing his best to avert his eyes.“Verna, what are you doing here?” Janet asked in a demure voice. Verna grinnedand pinched Janet’s cheek. “I came to get you out of here, silly. I came torescue you. We’re friends-did you think I’d leave you here?” Janet blinked inastonishment. “The Prelate let you come after me?” Verna lifted her hand,showing the woman the sunburst-patterned ring of the Prelate. “I am thePrelate.”Janet’s jaw fell open. She dropped to the floor and began kissing the hem ofVerna’s dress.Verna gripped Janet’s shoulder and urged her to her feet. “Stop that. There’s notime for that.”“But-but, how? What happened? How can this be? What has happened?”“Verna, those webs won’t hold for long,” Warren cautioned in a thin whisper.“We’ve already overstayed our welcome.”“Janet, listen to me. We can talk later, after we get you out of here. Thethings we had to do to get in here only give us a brief time to get back out.It’s dangerous for us to be here.”“I should say so,” Janet said. “Prelate, you must-”“Verna. We’re friends. It’s still Verna.”“Verna, how in Creation did you ever get into Jagang’s stronghold? You must getout at once. If you are found-”Verna frowned and touched the ring through Janet’s lower lip. “What’s this?”Janet paled. “It marks me as one of Jagang’s slaves.” She started shivering.“Verna, save yourself. Get out of here. You must get out!” she whisperedurgently. “I agree,” Warren whispered through gritted teeth. “Let’s go!” Vernapushed her cloak back over her shoulders, out of the way. “I know. Now thatwe’ve got you, we can go.”“Dear Creator, you have no idea how much I’d like to go with you, but if Idid-you can’t imagine what Jagang would do to me. Oh, dear Creator, you can’timagine.”Her eyes flooded with tears at the very thought. Verna embraced her for amoment. “Janet, listen to me. I’m your friend, you know I wouldn’t he to you.”She waited until the other nodded. “There is a way to keep the dream walker fromyour mind.”Janet clutched Verna’s dress at the shoulders. “Verna, don’t torment me withhope that I know is false. You have no idea how much I’d like to believe you,but I know-”“It’s true. Listen to me, Janet. I’m the Prelate, now. Don’t you think Jagangwould take me if he could? Why do you think he hasn’t taken the others? Hecan’t, that’s why.”Janet was shivering again, tears running down her cheeks. Warren put a hand toher back. “What Verna says is true. Sister Janet. Jagang can’t get into ourminds. Come with us, and you will be safe. Hurry.”“How?” Janet whispered.Verna leaned close. “You remember Richard?”“Of course. Trouble and wonder in one person.” Verna smiled at the truth ofthat. “He has the gift, that’s why I went after him, but there is more to it. Heis born with both sides of it. More than that, though, he is a Rahl.“Three thousand years ago, in the great war, Richard’s ancestor created a magicto block the dream walkers of that time from his people’s minds. That magic waspassed down to his descendants who have the gift.” Janet’s fists tightened onVerna’s dress. “How? How does it work?” Verna smiled. “It’s so simple that it’shard to believe. The most powerful magic is sometimes like that. All that isnecessary is to be sworn to him, in your heart, and his magic protects you fromthe dream walker. As long as Richard is alive and in this world, Jagang willnever again be able to enter your mind.”“I swear allegiance to Richard, and I’m free of Jagang?” Verna nodded at thewoman’s stunned face. “It’s true.”“What do I have to do?”Verna held up a finger to forestall Warren’s objections. She went to her knees,pulling Janet down with her.“Say the words with me, and mean them in your heart. Richard is a war wizard,and leads us in our fight against Jagang. We believe in him. in his heart, withall our hearts. Say the words with me, and believe, and you will be free.”Janet nodded as she clasped her hands prayerfully. Tears coursed down hercheeks. Verna whispered the devotion, pausing so Janet could repeat the wordsafter her.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.” Janet’s whispered words echoedVerna’s until she was finished. Verna kissed Janet’s cheek. “You are free, myfriend. Now hurry, let’s get out of here.”Janet snatched Verna’s sleeve. “What about the others?” Verna hesitated. “Janet,I would like nothing better than to rescue the rest of our Sisters, too, but Ican’t, not now. We will try to get them later. If we try now, Jagang will haveus.“I came to get you because you are my friend, and I love you. The five of us allswore to always protect each other. Phoebe is with us already. There is only youleft.“As much as I want to rescue the rest of our Sisters, it must be left untillater. I promise you, I won’t forget them, or leave them, but we can’t do it allnow, all at once.”Janet’s head lowered, and she stared at the floor. “Jagang killed Christabel. Isaw him do it. Her screams still haunt my nightmares. Her screams, and Jagang.”Verna felt as if she had been punched in the gut. Christabel had been her bestfriend. She didn’t want to know the details. Christabel had turned to theKeeper.“That’s why I have to get you out of here, Janet. My fear for you, and for whatJagang has done to you, haunts my nightmares.”Janet’s head came up. “What about Amelia? She was one of us five. We can’t leaveher.”Verna gave Janet a level look. “Amelia is a Sister of the Dark.”“Was,” Janet said. “No longer.”“What?” Verna whispered. Warren leaned over. “Once you’re sworn to the Keeper,you can’t change your mind. You can’t trust what she says, Sister Janet. Now,let’s get out of here. She’s sworn to the Keeper.”Janet shook her head. “No longer. Jagang sent her on some sort of mission,involving magic, and in order to accomplish her task, she was forced to betraythe Keeper.”“Impossible,” Verna said.“True,” Janet insisted. “She’s back. She has re-sworn her oath to the Creator.I’ve talked to her. She sits and weeps, kissing her ring finger half the night,praying to the Creator.”Verna leaned closer, looking into Janet’s eyes. “Janet, listen to me. Have youseen her kiss her ring finger? Have you seen it with your own eyes? Are youabsolutely sure she wasn’t kissing another finger?”“I’ve sat with her, trying to comfort her. I’ve watched her.” Janet kissed herown finger with a whispered supplication that if she wasn’t telling the truthshe would be struck dead.“Just like that? She kisses her finger just like that?”“Yes. She kisses her finger and cries and prays that the Creator will kill herfor the horror of what she has done.”“What has she done?”“I don’t know. When I ask, she practically goes crazy with screaming andweeping. Jagang won’t let her kill herself. He has control of her mind, as hedoes with the rest of us. He wouldn’t let any of us kill ourselves; we mustcontinue to serve him.“Verna, we can’t leave Amelia here. We have to take her with us. I won’t leaveher here. I’m the only comfort she has in this world. The things Jagang does toher...”Verna turned away. Her stomach roiled at the thought of leaving Amelia if indeedshe had abandoned the Keeper. The five of them had been best friends for closeto one hundred fifty years, since they were young novices.The life of a Sister of the Light was a difficult one. They had sworn oathsalways to protect one another.“Verna, she is one of us, a Sister of the Light, again. She is one of us five.Please, Verna, I’d rather stay with her than leave her here alone.” Vernaglanced back to Janet’s haunted eyes.“Verna, we must call him Excellency,” Janet said in a shuddering whisper. “If wedisplease him for any reason at all, we have to serve a week in the tents.”Warren spoke Verna’s name with rising inflection. Verna waved him to silence.“The tents? What are you saying?”Janet’s eyes flooded with tears again. “He gives us to his soldiers for a week.We have gold rings, so they won’t kill us, because those with gold rings belongto Jagang, but they can do whatever else they want. They pass us from tent totent for a week. Even the old Sisters are sent to the tents. Jagang calls it alesson in discipline that all must learn.”Janet fell to her knees, convulsing in sobs as she covered her mouth with bothhands. Verna sank down beside her and hugged her.“You don’t know what Jagang’s men do to us,” Janet cried. “You don’t know,Verna!”“I understand,” Verna whispered. “Hush now. It’s all right, now. We’ll get youaway from here.”Janet shook her head against Verna’s shoulder. “I won’t leave Amelia here. I’mall she has. I’m a Sister of the Light. The Creator would never forgive me if Iabandoned her. If I leave her. I’d be leaving my duty to the Creator. She’s myfriend. She came back to the Light. She came back to the Creator.“Jagang sent her to the tents, again. If I’m not here when she comes back,she’ll go crazy. No one else will tend to her. The Sisters of the Dark won’t gonear her. and the Sisters of the Light won’t forgive her. I’m her only friend.I’m the only one who forgave her and accepted her back to the Light.“She’ll be a bloody mess when she gets back. You don’t know what Jagang’s menare like. Except for broken bones, Jagang won’t allow us to use the gift to healone another when we come back from the tents. He says it’s part of the lesson,that our souls may belong to the Creator when we die, but in this life, Jagangowns our bodies.“We can have our broken bones knitted by the gift when we come back. but untilthen, we have to suffer the agony of that along with everything else. If I’m nothere, no one else will heal that much for her, or comfort her.” Janet was nearlyhysterical. “I won’t leave without Amelia.” Verna felt dizzy and sick to herstomach. Her heart pounded in terror. Bile rose into her throat.Verna’s voice broke. “How do you endure it?”Janet held her fists to her heart. “We are Sisters of the Light: we must endurefor the Creator.”Verna shared a long look with Warren’s troubled eyes. “Do you know where we canfind her? Maybe we could go find her and take her with us.”Janet shook her head. “We’re passed among the tents. She could be anywhere. Thearmy is spread out for miles and miles in every direction.“Not long ago, more captured women were sent back here. The screams areeverywhere, so you can’t simply follow the sounds of screams. Besides, if wewent out among the tents, we wouldn’t last five minutes before we were draggedinto one of them.”“How long?” Verna asked. “How long until Amelia is back?”“Five days, but she won’t be able to walk for at least a day after that, maybetwo.”Verna held a tight grip on her rage. “There’s nothing saying I can’t use my giftto cure her once she’s back.”Janet looked up. “That’s true. Five days, then. Tomorrow night is the full moon.The fourth day after the full moon.”“Are you able to leave this place? In order to meet us? I don’t think we can getback in here again.”“Not very far. I can’t even imagine how you could have gotten in here.” Vernashowed the woman a tight smile. “I’m not Prelate for nothing. Warren helped,too. We’ll come back, four nights after the full moon.”“Verna, there’s one other thing. If Jagang can’t enter my dreams, he will knowsomething is wrong.”Verna pressed her hands to her face. “But you’ve already given the oath. Youcan’t take it back, or it would mean nothing. You have already given your heartto Richard.”“Then I’ll have to be careful.”“Can you do that? Can you get away with it?”Janet touched her fingers to her lips. “What choice do I have? I’ll have to.”Verna held out her dacra. “Here. At least you can protect yourself.” Janetpushed it away as if it were poison. “If I was caught with that thing, I’d besent out to the tents for a year.”“Well, at least you can use your gift, now that Jagang can’t enter your mind toprevent it.”“It won’t do any good here. Jagang has total control over all those with thegift who are here-Sisters and wizards. It would be spitting into a storm to tryto use my gift against them.”“I know. That’s why we can’t try to take the others right now. We’d never makeit. The Sisters of the Dark would fight us, and with their use of SubtractiveMagic, they would cut us to pieces.” Verna pressed her lips together. “Janet,are you sure about this?”“If I don’t help a Sister in dire need, then what good is my oath as a Sister ofthe Light? One has come back to us from the Keeper; perhaps she can teach us howto bring the others back.”Verna had never thought of that. Warren was making impatient eye signals. Shecould see the muscles in his jaw flexing.Janet saw, too. She gripped Verna by the shoulders and kissed her cheeks. Sheturned and hugged Warren.“Please, Verna, get out of here before it’s too late. I’ll be able to endurefive days. I know how to bow and scrape for Jagang. He’s been busy; maybe I canstay out of his sight for that long.”“All right. Where? We came down the coast to Grafan Harbor, and I don’t know thelay of the land.”“The coast? Then you would have passed the watch house, near the docks.”“Yes, I saw the place, but it had guards in it.”Janet leaned close. “As you said, there’s nothing stopping you from using yourgift. The guard changes around sundown. Wait until you see the guard change, andthen silence them. That will give you a safe place to wait until nearly dawn.Sometime in the night, I will be there with Amelia.”“The watch house, then. Fourth night after the full moon.” Janet gave her aquick hug. “Five nights, and we’re free. Hurry. Get out of here.” Warrensnatched Verna’s arm and pulled her through the door."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 54Soon after he awoke, just before dawn, Richard stood outside his bedroom,reading the morning report. For the first time. the number of dead in one nighthad climbed over one thousand. A thousand tragedies in one night.Ulic, standing not far away with his massive arms folded, asked the number. Arare event, Ulic asking a question. Richard couldn’t speak. He handed the reportto his bodyguard. Ulic sighed heavily when he read the number.The city was in shambles. Trade had been disrupted to the point that food wasgetting scarce. Firewood, used for both heat and cooking, was hard to come by.Services of every kind were difficult to secure, either because people wereafraid to bring their wares into the city, they had abandoned their homes andfled the city, or they were dead.Only the cures in the streets were in abundance.Richard paused beside a long tapestry of a city market scene as he was headedfor his office. His shadow glided to a silent halt behind him. The thought ofgoing back to translating the book made him nauseous. He was finding nothingnew, anyway. He was mired in a long report on an inquiry into the dealingsWizard Ricker had had with a people called the Andolians. It was boring and madelittle sense to him.Richard couldn’t face the book again this early in the day. Besides, he wasworried sick about Raina. In the last week she had only gotten worse. Nothingcould be done for her, any more than anything could be done for the thousandpeople who had died the night before.Shota had told Kahlan that the Temple of the Winds would send another message,would send a way to get in. The spirit had told her the same thing. Why hadn’tit come? Would they all be dead before the winds sent word?Richard glanced out an east window and saw the first rays of the morning suncoming from between two mountains. With the gathering clouds he had already seencoming in from the west, he knew that they wouldn’t be seeing the full moon thatnight.He headed for Kahlan’s room. He had to see her face. see something that couldlift his spirits. Ulic took up station beside Egan at the corner of the hall.Egan had been with Kahlan’s guard the night before. Richard was greeted byNancy, just coming out the door. “Is Kahlan up?”Nancy pulled the door closed behind herself. She glanced up the hall to see Ulicand Egan. They were too far away to hear.“Yes, Lord Rahl. She is just a little slow, this morning. She isn’t feelingwell.” Richard gripped the woman’s arm. He thought that Kahlan had looked out ofsorts for the last few days, but she had steadfastly dismissed his concerns.Richard could feel the blood draining from his face. “What’s wrong? Is she...sick? She doesn’t-”“No, no,” Nancy insisted, suddenly realizing that she had frightened the witsout of him. “Nothing like that.”“Then what’s wrong?” Richard pressed.The woman patted her lower belly and leaned close. She let her voice drop tolittle more than a whisper. “It’s just her cycle of the moon, that’s all. It’llbe over in a couple more days. I wouldn’t say anything, mind you, but with theplague, I don’t want you to worry yourself to death. Just don’t tell her I toldyou, or she’ll bite off my head.”Richard sighed as he smiled with relief. He squeezed Nancy’s hand inappreciation.“Of course not. Thank you, Nancy. You don’t know how much that eases my mind. Icouldn’t endure it if she...”Nancy touched his arm as she gave him a warm smile. “I know. That’s the onlyreason I said anything.”After Nancy had trundled off down the hall, Richard knocked on the door. Kahlanhad been just about to open it, and was surprised to find him standing there.She smiled up at him. “I was wrong.”“About what?”“You are more handsome than I remembered.”Richard grinned. She had lifted his spirits. He gave her a quick kiss when sherose on her toes and puckered her lips.Richard gathered up her hand. “I’m on my way to check on Raina. Want to comewith me?”She nodded, the mirth ghosting away from her face.Berdine met them not far from their room. Her eyes were red and leaden. She worered leather. Richard didn’t ask why. “Lord Rahl, please... Raina is asking foryou.”Richard enclosed her shoulders with one arm. “We were on our way there. Comeon.”Richard didn’t ask how Berdine was. It was obvious she was sick with worry.“Berdine, some people have recovered from the plague. No one is stronger thanRaina. She is Mord-Sith. She will be one of the ones who recovers.” Berdinenodded woodenly.Raina was lying on her bed. She was wearing her red leather. Standing in thedoorway, Richard leaned toward Berdine and whispered, “Why is she dressed?” Heleft the obvious question of why she was wearing her red leather unasked.Berdine clutched his arm. “She asked me to dress her in the red leather of aMord-Sith”-Berdine stifled a wail-”for the final battle.”Richard sank to his knees beside the bed. Raina’s half-open eyes rolled towardhim. Sweat ran from her face. Her lower lip quivered.Raina gripped Richard’s arm. “Lord Rahl... please, take me out to see Reggie?”“Reggie?”“The chipmunks... please take me out to feed Reggie. He’s the one missing theend of his little tail.” His heart breaking, he smiled for her. “It would be myhonor.”He scooped her up in his arms. She had lost a lot of weight. She hardly weighedanything.Raina wrapped a weak arm around his neck as she cuddled her head to his shoulderwhile he carried her through the halls.Berdine walked beside them, holding Raina’s other hand. Kahlan walked at hisother side. Ulic and Egan marched behind.Soldiers along the way silently stepped clear, eyes to the ground, giving asalute of fist to heart as Richard and the procession passed. The salute was forRaina.Outside, Richard sat on the stone court, in the light of the dawning sun,holding Raina in his lap. Berdine sat on her heels by her head. Kahlan sat onhis other side. Ulic and Egan, hands clasped behind their backs, stood not farto the rear. Richard saw a tear or two wend its way down each of their stonyfaces.“Over there,” Richard said to Kahlan, pointing with his chin. “Give me thatbox.”Kahlan turned and saw what he meant. He kept seeds in a box under a stone bench.She wiggled off the lid and held out the box.Richard scooped out a handful of seeds and tossed some on the ground beforethem. He trickled the rest into Raina’s bony hand.It wasn’t long before two chipmunks, tails twitching, scampered across the lawn.Richard had fed them enough so they knew that the appearance of people mightmean food. They stuffed seeds in their cheeks, as best they could, betweensudden, chattering bouts of trying to chase each other away. Raina watched, hereyes only half opened.Her Agiel dangled from the chain on the wrist of the hand that Berdine held. Thetwo chipmunks, their cheeks full, scurried for their burrows to store theirbooty.Raina opened her arm out and rested her hand on the paving stone. She uncurledher fingers. Each shallow breath rattled. Berdine tenderly stroked Raina’sforehead.Another chipmunk appeared from under a bush. He came partway toward them, frozestiff while he checked for threat, and then dashed the rest of the way. He wasmissing the end of his tail. “Reggie,” Raina breathed.Raina smiled as Reggie climbed into her open hand. He sat there, pressing hislittle feet against her fingers as he popped seeds into his mouth with histongue. He paused, sitting up in her hand, to rearrange the seeds stuffed in hischeeks. Satisfied, he dropped back down, putting his little feet to Raina’sfingers again. Raina let out a soft giggle.Berdine kissed her forehead. “I love you, Raina.” she whispered. “I love you,Berdine.”Richard felt Raina’s muscles go slack as she died in his arms while Reggie sateating seeds from her hand."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 55Kahlan stood behind Richard as he sat in his chair in his office, her armscircled around his neck, her cheek laid against the top of his head as she wept.Richard rolled Raina’s Agiel in his fingers. Berdine said that Raina had wantedhim to have it.Berdine had asked for permission to go up to the Keep to tell Cara. She alsoasked if she could take her turn at watch over the sliph, as Cara had been upthere for the last three days.Richard told her that she could do whatever she wished, for as long as shewished, and that if she wanted him to take her watch, or to come sit with her,he would. She had said that she wanted to be alone for a while. “Why hasn’t thetemple sent its message?” Kahlan smoothed his hair. “I don’t know.”“What are we going to do?” he asked. It wasn’t a question for which he expectedan answer. “I just don’t know what to do.”Kahlan rubbed her palms up and down the sides of his shoulders. “Do you thinkyou might find an answer in the trial record?”“For all I know it could be the very last line I translate that gives me anyinformation I can use.” He slowly shook his head. “Long before I can translateevery line, we’ll all be dead.”Richard hooked Raina’s Agiel on the chain along with the amulet at his chest.The red color of the Agiel matched the ruby.Silence hung in the air for a time before he said, “Jagang is going to win.”Kahlan turned his head toward her. “Don’t say that. Please don’t say that.” Heforced a smile. “You’re right. We’ll beat him.” A knock came to the door. Ulicstuck his head in when Richard called to ask who it was.“Lord Rahl, General Kerson wanted to know if he could talk to you for a minute.”Kahlan patted Richard’s shoulder. “I’m going to go tell Drefan and Nadine aboutRaina.”Richard walked to the door with her. General Kerson was waiting outside with hisusual fistful of reports.“I’ll catch up with you in a few minutes,” Richard said. As Kahlan left Richardto hear the general’s reports, Egan fell in with her. It felt odd to be guardedby Egan alone, without a Mord-Sith. One of them had always seemed to be around.“Mother Confessor,” Egan said, “some people just arrived at the palace andwanted to see you and Lord Rahl. I told them that everyone was busy. I didn’twant to burden Lord Rahl.”“Petitioners’ Hall must be packed with people who want to see us, what with allthe trouble.”“They aren’t in Petitioners’ Hall. The guards stopped them as they went into oneof the reception rooms. They aren’t exactly arrogant, like some of therepresentatives I’ve seen, but they are insistent, in an odd sort of way.”Kahlan frowned up at the huge, blond D’Haran. “Did they say who they were? Didyou find out that much, at least?”“They said they were Andolians.”Kahlan jerked to a halt, seizing Egan’s massive arm. “Andolians! And the guardslet them in? They let Andolians in the palace?”Egan’s brow drew down. “I didn’t hear how they got in. Only that they were here.Is this a problem. Mother Confessor?”The man’s hand was already on his sword. “No. it’s not that. It’s just that...dear spirits, how do you explain the Andolians?” She searched for the rightwords. “They aren’t exactly-human.”“What do you mean?”“There are creatures of magic that live in the Midlands. There are people withmagic who live in the Midlands. It is sometimes difficult to know where to placethe line separating them. Some of these people with magic are part creature-likethe Andolians.”“Magic?” Egan asked with obvious distaste. “Are they dangerous?” Kahlan heaved asigh as she changed her mind about where she was going and instead started outfor the reception hall. “Not exactly. At least, not usually. Not if you know howto treat them.“No one knows a great deal about the Andolians. We leave them alone. Most peopleof the Midlands have a strong dislike for them. The Andolians steal things. Notfor the wealth of the object, but simply because the Andolians are fascinated bythings. Shiny things, mostly. A piece of glass, a gold piece, or a button-it’sall the same to them.“People don’t like them because the Andolians look much like you and I, and sopeople think they should behave like people, but they aren’t people, exactly.“They usually show up in places out of simple curiosity. We don’t allow them inthe palace because they cause such a disruption. It’s best to simply keep themout. With the magic they have, if you try to discipline them, they can turnnasty. Very nasty.”“Perhaps I should have the soldiers get rid of them.”“No. That could get ugly. Dealing with them requires a very special kind ofprotocol. Fortunately, I know the protocol. I’ll get rid of them.”“How?”“The Andolians like to carry messages. They like that more than anything- morethan shiny objects, even. They love to carry messages for people. I guess itmakes them feel more connected to their human side to be involved in humanaffairs.“Some people in the Midlands use them for that purpose. Andolians will carry amessage more faithfully than any courier. They will do it for a shiny button.They would even do it for no compensation. They live to convey messages.“All I have to do is give them a message to carry, and they will be off todeliver it. That’s the easiest way to get rid of an Andolian.”“Will it get rid of all of them?” Egan asked as he scratched his head. “All ofthem? Dear spirits, don’t tell me that there are more than a couple?”“Seven. Six women who all look alike, and one man.”Kahlan lost a stride. “I don’t believe it. That would be the Legate Rishi andhis six wives, all sisters. The six sisters were all born of the same...litter.”The Andolians believed that only a litter of six females were worthy to be thelegate’s wives. Kahlan’s head spun as she tried to concentrate through thedepression over Raina’s death, over all the deaths. She had to think of a placeto send the Andolians, and a message for them to carry.Maybe something about the plague. She could send them somewhere with a warningabout the plague. Maybe down into the wilds. Most of the people of the wildstolerated the Andolians better than most other people in the Midlands.A throng of guards bristling with weapons filled the halls all around thereception room. Two guards with pikes opened the tall, mahogany-panelled doorsas Kahlan and Egan approached.The reception hall, where waited the Andolians, was one of the smaller ones,without windows. Sculptures of every sort, from rulers’ busts to a farmer andoxen, most done in pale marble, rested on square granite blocks placed backagainst the dark walls. Behind each sculpture, ornamental drapery of a richmaroon was swagged back to half-columns of dark violet marble set against thewalls between each sculpture. It lent each piece the air of being displayed on astage, with curtains opening for them.Four separate clusters of ornate lamps with cut-glass chimneys hung on silverchains. Because of the dark decor, the dozens of lamps were unable to bringanything brighter than a sombre atmosphere to the room. Three heavy, dark tablessat on the black marble floor.The Andolians stood before one of these tables. The six sisters were tall andslender, and Kahlan couldn’t tell one from another. Their hair was dyed a brightorange with the berries of a basset bush that grew in the Andolians’ homeland.Their homeland wasn’t close; they had made a long journey to get to Aydindril.Their big, round black eyes watched Kahlan approach. Their orange hair, woveninto hundreds of small braids, made the women look as if they wore wigs oforange yarn. Woven into the yarnlike hair were small, shiny things-buttons,pieces of metal, gold and silver coins, shards of glass, chips of obsidian-anyscrap that they found shiny enough for their taste.All six were dressed in simple but elegant white robes of a lustrous, satinymaterial. Despite what Kahlan knew about the Andolians-such as the way a simplestorm could send them puling for protection under a bush or a hole in theground- they had a noble air. Kahlan guessed that made sense; they were, afterall, the wives of the legate, the leader of the Andolians.The legate himself was shorter than his wives, and much older. Other than hisround black eyes, he looked to be nothing more than a distinguished official, abit on the stocky side. A bald pate shone above his fringe of white hair. Somekind of grease had been rubbed on it so as to make it glossy.He wore robes similar lo his wives’, but of gold material trimmed with rows ofshiny objects sewn on. Each finger had at least one ring. From a distance, allthe shiny objects made him look opulent. Closer up, he looked more like a crazybeggar who had dug through a midden heap to pluck out worthless items discardedby normal people.Legate Rishi’s eyes were red-rimmed and leaden-looking. He wore a doltish grinand swayed on his feet. Kahlan saw him infrequently, but she didn’t remember himthis way.The six sisters formed into a line before him. They straightened, putting theirshoulders back with pride.“We share the moon,” one of the six said.“We share the moon,” Kahlan said in their traditional greeting among females.Her waning cramps reminded her that the greeting had more than one meaning.The rest spoke the greeting in turn. The way those big black eyes blinked asthey watched her gave Kahlan shivers. When they had finished with the officialgreeting, the six split into two groups of three and backed to either side oftheir husband.The legate lifted a hand, as if a king greeting a crowd. He grinned moronically.Kahlan frowned at his odd behavior, although she wasn’t at all sure that for anAndolian it was odd.“We share the sun,” he said in a slur.“We share the sun,” Kahlan answered, but he ignored her as his attention wasdiverted by something behind her.Kahlan turned and saw Richard striding across the room. a glower heating hisexpression.“What’s this about the moon?” Richard asked as he came up beside Kahlan. Shetook his hand. “Richard,” she said in a tone of warning, “this is Legate Rishiand his wives. They are Andolians. I have just given them their traditionalgreeting, that’s all.”His expression slackened. “Oh, I see. When they said something about the moon-Ithought.”The blood suddenly drained from Richard’s face.“Andolians,” he whispered to himself. “Wizard Ricker was doing something withthe Andolians...” He seemed lost in a confusion of thought.“We share the sun,” Legate Rishi said through his grin, “The females share themoon. A female and a male share the sun. but not the moon.”Richard rubbed his brow. He looked engrossed in recollection, or confusion.Kahlan squeezed his hand, hoping he would get the message to let her handlethis. She turned back to the legate. “Legate Rishi, I would like you to-”“Our husband has been drinking things that make him happy,” one of the wivessaid, as if it were a fascinating bit of news. “He has been trading some of hisprizes for this drink.” Her expression turned perplexed. “It makes him slow.too, or we would have been here sooner.”“Thank you for telling me this,” Kahlan said. One had always to thank anAndolian for any information they offered about themselves. Information aboutthemselves so given was considered a gift.Kahlan turned her attention once more to the legate. “Legate Rishi, I would likeyou to carry an important message for me.”“Sorry,” the legate said. “We can carry no message for you.” Kahlan wasdumbfounded. She had never heard of an Andolian refusing to carry a message.“But, why not?”One of the six leaned toward Kahlan. “Because we already carry a message ofgreat importance.”“You do?”Her big black eyes blinked. “Yes. The greatest of all honors. Husband carries amessage from the moon.”“You what?” Richard whispered as his head came up.“The moon sends a message from the winds,” the legate said in a drunken slur.Kahlan felt as if the world had frozen.“We would have been here sooner, but husband had to stop many times to have thedrink of happiness.”Kahlan felt her whole body tingle with icy dread.“Been here sooner,” Richard repeated. “While all those people died, you’ve beendrinking?” His voice boomed like thunder. “Raina died, because you’ve been outgetting drunk!”Richard exploded in a blur of movement, his fist striking Legate Rishi so hardthat the man tumbled back over the table.“People are dying, and you’re out getting drunk!” Richard roared as he vaultedover the table.“Richard, no!” Kahlan shrieked. “He has magic!”Kahlan saw a blur of red racing in from the side. Cara came at a dead run anddived over the table, knocking Richard sprawling across the floor.Legate Rishi rose up in a rage. Blood frothed at his mouth. Strings of itwhipped from his chin.Wavering flares of light and undulating flutters of darkness radiated up hisarms, gathering at his chest as he rose up. He was gathering his magic,preparing to unleash it against Richard. Richard went for his sword.Cara shoved Richard again and rebounded back at the legate, backhanding himacross his bloody mouth. The legate whirled, redirecting his rage at her.Cat-quick, Cara spun past him, striking him again, turning his attention awayfrom Richard as he followed her. His magic already gathered, he unleashed it ather. The air thumped and at the same time seemed to oscillate. The legate wentdown with a grunt of pain. Cara was on him before he hit the ground. She pressedher Agiel to his throat.“You are mine, now,” she sneered as he gagged in agony. “Your magic is mine,now.”“Cara!” Kahlan yelled. “Don’t kill him!”The six sisters were squatted down in a shivering clump, bugging one another interror. Kahlan put a hand to the frightened sisters, reassuring them that theywouldn’t be harmed.“Cara, don’t hurt him,” Kahlan said. “He carries a message from the Temple ofthe Winds.”Cara’s head came up. She had a disturbing look in her eyes. “I know. It came tohim with magic. His magic is mine, now. The message he carries is embeddedwithin his magic.”Richard let his sword drop back into its scabbard. “You mean, you know themessage?” Cara nodded, her blue eyes filling with tears.“I know it with him. I share his magic, his knowledge of the message.”“Ulic, Egan,” Richard said. “clear the soldiers out. Shut the doors. Keepeveryone out.”As Ulic and Egan were ushering the soldiers out, Richard seized the legate bythe robes at his throat and lifted him. He heaved him into a chair. Richardlowered over the suddenly meek-looking, panting Andolian leader.His chest heaving, Richard gripped the amulet and Raina’s Agiel in a fist. Themuscles in his jaw flexed as he pointed at the legate’s face.“Let’s have the message. And you had better tell it true. Thousands of peoplehave already died while you delayed your arrival to get drunk.”“The message from the winds is for two people.”Richard looked up. The words had come not only from the legate, but also fromCara. She had spoken the words along with him. “Cara, do you know the message,too? Just as he does?” Cara looked as surprised as Richard. “I... it came to me,as it came to him. I knew only that he carried a message. He didn’t know ituntil he spoke it. I knew it when he did.”“Who is the message for?” Kahlan knew.“For Wizard Richard Rahl, and for Mother Confessor Kahlan Amnell.” Once again,both had spoken the words. “What is the message?” Richard asked.Kahlan knew. She went to Richard’s side, taking his hand in hers. holding it fordear life.The room was empty of everyone except Richard. Kahlan. Cara, Legate Rishi, andthe six sisters, cowering under a table. The lamps around the room dimmed, as iftheir wicks had been turned down. It cast them all in an eerie, wavering light.The legate, his face gone blank, looked to have gone into a trance. He rose fromthe chair, blood still dripping from his chin. His arm lifted, pointing atRichard. Only he spoke, this time.“The winds summon you. Wizard Richard Rahl. Magic has been stolen from thewinds, and used in this world to cause harm. You must wed in order to enter theTemple of the Winds.“Your wife is to be one named Nadine Brighton.”Unable to speak, Richard brought Kahlan’s hand to his heart, holding it there inboth of his hands.Cara’s arm lifted, pointing at Kahlan. Only she spoke, this time, in a frigid,heartless voice.“The winds summon you. Mother Confessor Kahlan Amnell. Magic has been stolenfrom the winds, and used in this world to cause harm. You must wed in order tohelp Wizard Richard Rahl enter the Temple of the Winds. “You husband is to beone named Drefan Rahl.” Richard dropped to his knees. Kahlan sank down besidehim. She thought she should feel something. She felt only numbness. It seemed adream.She had thought it would never come. Now that it was happening, it seemed toofast. as if she were tumbling over a cliff, grasping for a handhold, but findingnothing to stop her fall as she plunged into icy blackness.It was over. Everything was over. Her life, her dreams, her future, her joy, wasover. It only remained to act it out until the end. Richard’s ashen face lookedup from Cara’s feet.“Cara, please. I’m begging you, don’t do this to us.” His voice broke. “Dearspirits, please don’t do this to us, Cara.” Cara’s cold blue eyes stared back.“I do not do this to you. I only bear the message from the winds. You must bothagree to this, if you wish to enter the Temple of the Winds.”“Why must Kahlan marry?”“The winds require a virgin bride.” Richard’s eyes darted to Kahlan. He lookedback to Cara. “She isn’t a virgin.”“Yes, she is,” Cara said. “No! She’s not!”Kahlan put her forehead against the side of Richard’s face as she gripped hismuscular neck, hugging herself to him.“Yes. Richard. I am,” she whispered. “In this world, I am. Shota told me thatthat was all that mattered to the spirits. In this world, in our world, theworld of life, I am a virgin. We were together in another world. It doesn’tapply here.”“That’s crazy,” he whispered in a hoarse voice. “That’s just crazy.”“It fulfills the requirements of the winds,” Cara said.“This is the only chance you will be offered,” the legate said. “If you do nottake it, then the obligation of the winds to remedy the damage will be ended.”“Please, Cara,” Richard whispered. “Please... don’t do this. There has to beanother way.”“This is the only way.” Cara, in her red leather, lowered above them. “It is upto you whether you will repair the damage. You must agree. If you fail to answerthe call, it will not come again, and the magic released will run free.”“The winds wish to know your answer,” the legate said. “You must both agree tothis of your free will. It must be a true marriage in all aspects. It must befor life. You must both be of honest intent in your marriages, and faithful tothe ones you wed.”“He speaks the truth of the winds. What is your answer?” Cara asked in a voicelike ice.Kahlan looked through the watery blur into Richard’s eyes. She could see himdying behind those eyes.“It is our duty. Only we can save those people, but I will say no if you wishit, Richard.”“How many more Rainas must die in my arms? I couldn’t ask you to have me at thecost of another life.”Kahlan swallowed the wail. “Is there anything... do you know of anything wecould do to stop the plague?”Richard shook his head. “I’m sorry. I have failed you. I haven’t found a wayaround this.”“You haven’t failed me, Richard. I couldn’t bear to think we were the cause ofmore death, like Raina’s, today.” She threw her arms around his neck. “I loveyou so much, Richard.”Richard’s big hand held her head to him. “We are agreed, then. We must do this.”Richard brought her to her feet with him. There was so much she wanted to say tohim. No words came. When she looked into Richard’s eyes, she knew words weren’tneeded.They turned to Cara and the legate. “I agree. I will marry Nadine.”“I agree. I will marry Drefan.” Kahlan fell into Richard’s arms as she lostcontrol of her tears. She sobbed in agony. Richard embraced her, nearlysqueezing the life out of her. Cara and the legate were suddenly there, pullingthem apart. “You are each promised to another,” Cara said. “You may not do thisnow.You must each be loyal to your mates.” Kahlan looked past the legate intoRichard’s eyes, each of them knowing that they had embraced for the last time.In that moment, her world ended."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 56Kahlan and Richard sat apart, with the legate and Cara between them. Kahlanheard the doors open. It was Nadine and Drefan. After Ulic had let them in, heclosed the doors.Richard raked his hair back as he rose. Kahlan didn’t want to test her legs,yet. It had all slipped through her fingers. Everything was lost to duty.Nadine eyed everyone in the room: the legate, his six wives, Cara, Kahlan, andfinally Richard as he walked haltingly to her.Richard stared at the floor. “You both know that the plague was started withmagic. I told you both how it was stolen from the Temple of the Winds. Thetemple has sent its requirements if I am to be allowed to enter and stop theplague.“The temple requires that both Kahlan and I wed. The temple has named who it isit requires we wed. I’m sorry that both of you have been... tangled in this. Idon’t know the reason. The temple will not explain why it must be so, only thatthis is our only chance to halt the plague. I can’t force either of you to bepart of this; I can only ask.”Richard cleared his throat, trying to steady his voice. He lifted Nadine’s hand.He couldn’t look her in the eye. “Nadine, will you marry me?”Nadine’s gaze immediately went to Kahlan. Kahlan wore her Confessor’s face, asher mother taught her. Duty, as her mother had taught her. Nadine glanced to theothers, and then back to the top of Richard’s head. “Do you love me, Richard?”Richard finally looked up into her eyes. “No. I’m sorry, Nadine, but, no. Idon’t love you.”She was unruffled by the answer. Kahlan was sure that she had expected it. “I’llmarry you, Richard. I’ll make you happy. You’ll see. You’ll come to love me, intime.”“No, Nadine,” Richard whispered, “I won’t. We will be husband and wife, if youagree to this, and I will be faithful to you, but my heart will always belong toKahlan. I’m sorry to say such a harsh thing to you when I’m asking you to marryme, but I won’t deceive you.”Nadine thought a moment. “Well, many marriages are arranged, and they turn outwell in the end.” She smiled at him. To Kahlan, it looked a sympathetic smile.“The spirits have arranged this one. That means something. I will marry you,Richard.”Richard glanced back at Kahlan. It was her turn. She saw in those dead gray eyesa glimmer of something: rage. Kahlan knew that his insides were being torn apartthe same as were hers.She found herself before Drefan before she realized it. The first time shetried, her voice wouldn’t come out. It simply wouldn’t. She tried again.“Drefan, will you... be... my husband?”His blue. Darken Rahl eyes appraised her without emotion. For some reason, sherecalled his hand between Cara’s legs, and she almost vomited.“As Nadine said. I could do worse than a marriage arranged by the spirits. Idon’t suppose there’s any chance you will ever come to love me?”Kahlan’s jaw trembled as she stared at the floor. Her voice wouldn’t work. Sheshook her head.“Well, no matter. We may still have some good times. I’ll do it. I will marryyou, Kahlan.”She was glad that she had never told Richard about what Drefan had done to Cara.If she had. Richard might have lost control when Drefan said he would marryKahlan and pulled free his sword.Cara and the legate stepped forward. “It is agreed, then.” they said as one.“The winds are pleased to have the consent of all involved.”“When?” Richard asked in a hoarse voice. “When will we... when do we. . .? Andwhen can I get into the Temple of the Winds? People are dying. I have to helpthe winds put a stop to it.”“Tonight,” Cara and the legate said as one. “We will leave immediately for MountKymermosst. You will be wed tonight, as soon as we arrive there.”Kahlan didn’t ask how they would get to a place that wasn’t there anymore. Itdidn’t really matter to her. The only thing that really mattered to her was thatthey would be wed that very night.“I’m sorry about Raina,” Nadine said to Richard. “How is Berdine doing?”“Not well. She’s up at the Keep.”Richard turned to Cara. “Can we stop up there on our way? I must tell her whathas happened. She will have to stay to guard the sliph until I return. I have totell her.”“And I’d like to give her something to help her feel better,” Nadine said. “Itis permitted,” Cara said in that awful, icy voice.Berdine looked terror-stricken when Richard told her. She threw her arms aroundhim and wept with twin misery. The sliph watched from her well. frowning withcuriosity.Nadine mixed things from pouches in her big bag. giving Berdine instructions onwhen to take them, promising that it would help her get through her grief.Richard tried to tell Berdine everything he could think of that she might needto know.Kahlan could almost feel time tingling against her flesh as it flew past, as sheplunged and plunged into the black depths.“We must go,” Cara said, cutting off the stalling. “We must ride hard to arrivebefore the full moon rises.”“How will I find the Temple of the Winds?” Richard asked. “You do not find theTemple of the Winds,” Cara said. “The Temple of the Winds will find you, if therequirements are met.”Nadine lifted her bag before Richard. “Can I leave this here, then? It’s heavyto carry if we’re coming back here anyway.”“Of course,” Richard said, his voice a dead monotone.Kahlan was made to walk behind Richard and beside Drefan as they returned to thehorses. Nadine touched Richard’s back as she walked beside him. She was doing afair job of restraining her joy over her triumph, yet it was a touch meant tosend a message: he belonged to her, now.At the bottom of the Keep road, as they turned away from the city, Kahlan couldhear the men with the dead-carts, calling out for people to bring out theirdead. Soon, that would be ended, as the suffering and death of the plague wasended. Only in that did she find any solace. The children, their parents, wouldlive.If only it had come in time for Raina. Berdine hadn’t said that, but Kahlan knewthat that thought was screaming in her head.Richard had ordered all their guards to remain. When Ulic and Egan had seen thelook on his face, they hadn’t argued. Only Richard and Nadine, Kahlan andDrefan, Cara, the legate, and his six wives rode out for Mount Kymermosst.Kahlan didn’t know how any of it was going to work, getting into the Temple ofthe Winds, nor did Richard. She didn’t have the slightest curiosity about it.The only thing she could think about was Richard marrying Nadine. Kahlan wassure that Richard could think of nothing but her marrying Drefan.As they rode, Drefan told stories, trying to keep everyone entertained, tryingto lift their spirits. Kahlan didn’t hear much of it. She watched Richard’sback; her only need was to be looking when he glanced back at her, as he didfrom time to time.She couldn’t bear not to look at him, yet meeting his eyes was like a hot knifesearing into her heart.She took no joy in the mountainous country they rode into, the greening grass,unfurling ferns, budding trees. The day was warm, compared to what the weatherhad been for spring, so far, but the sky brooded with dark clouds. Before theday was out, she expected they would encounter a storm. The Andolians cringedevery time their eyes turned up.Kahlan pulled her cloak tighter around herself. She thought about her bluewedding dress back in her room that she had planned to wear when she marriedRichard.She felt herself getting angry at him. He had seduced her into thinking shecould have love, could have happiness. Seduced her into forgetting she had onlyduty. Seduced her into loving him.When she realized she was angry at him, the tears came again, running down herface in a silent torrent. This wasn’t happening just to her, it was happening tohim, too. They shared this torment.She thought about the first time she saw him. It seemed so long ago that she hadbeen running from Darken Rahl’s assassins, and Richard had helped her. Shethought about all the things they had done together, all the times she stoodwatch while he slept, and she gazed at him, imagining being just a normal womanwho could fall in love, instead of a Confessor who had to keep her feelingssecret and live a loveless life of duty.Richard had found a way, though, found a way that she, a Confessor, could havelove. And now it was in ashes.Why would the spirits do this to them? The answer came when she remembered hertalk with Shota, and with the spirit. There were not only good spirits, but evilspirits, too. Those evil spirits had a hand in this. They were the ones whowanted this, who demanded it as the price of the path.The spirits who demanded that price were worse than evil. Late in the morning,they stopped to rest the horses and eat. Nadine and Drefan talked with theirmouths full. The legate sat back as his wives fed him. He had a hard time, whatwith his cut lip. They rubbed their legs against his. giggling as he took foodfrom their fingers. They ate between offering him bites. Cara ate in silence.Kahlan didn’t notice what any of them had to eat.She and Richard didn’t eat. They both sat on the sunny rocks like deadwood,silent, sullen, staring at nothing.When the others had finished with their meal, Richard watched as they allmounted up again. Even though none of the others noticed it, Kahlan could seethe smoldering rage in his eyes. The spirits had chosen Drefan to wound him.They could have done nothing worse.“How’s the arm?” Nadine asked Drefan as they all started out again. Drefan heldit up and flexed his fingers in demonstration. “Nearly good as new.”Kahlan ignored their conversation. All morning, they had chattered. In hersilent world, it was barely noticed.“What is wrong with your arm, master Drefan?” one of the six sisters asked. “Oh,some miscreant didn’t like the way I try to purge the world of sickness.” Bigblack eyes blinked at him. “What did he do to you?” Drefan straightenedhaughtily in his saddle. “Cut me with his knife. Tried to kill me. the filthyscum.”“Why did he not succeed?”Drefan dismissed the incident with an arrogant wave. “Once I showed him somesteel, he ran for his life.”“I sewed his wound,” Nadine told the amazed sisters. “And a deep one it was,too.”Drefan cast a glance at Nadine that seemed to make her shrink in her saddle. “Itold you, Nadine, it’s nothing. I don’t want sympathy. A lot of people are inmuch greater need than l.”He relented when he saw the sheepish look on her face. “But you did a good job.As fine as any of my healers would have done. You did a fine job, and Iappreciate it.” Nadine smiled as they rode on.Drefan pulled up the broad hood of his flaxen cloak. Dear spirits, she thought,that is to be my husband. For the rest of my life, this is to be my partner inlife. Until she could die, and be with Richard again. Sweet death could not comesoon enough.Clarissa wiped her sweaty palms together as she peered through the keyhole andlistened to Nathan speaking with the Sisters in the other room.“I’m sure you can understand. Lord Rahl,” Sister Jodelle said. “This is for yourown safety, too.”Nathan chuckled. “How good of the emperor to consider my well-being.”“If, as you say, Richard Rahl will be eliminated tonight, then you have nothingto be concerned about. We will bring it afterwards. Surely, this would besatisfactory.” Nathan shot them a hot glare. “I told you, Jagang’s plan hasworked. Richard Rahl will be eradicated tonight. You will learn not to questionme after tonight, I pray.”Clarissa had to strain to see Nathan through the keyhole as he turned away fromthe two Sisters while he considered. He turned back to them. “And he has agreedto everything else?”“Everything,” Sister Willamina assured him. “He looks forward to having you ashis plenipotentiary in D’Hara, and is most agreeable to your offer of aid withthe books of prophecy he has collected over the years.”Nathan grunted. “Where are they? I don’t know that I’m amenable to travellingall over the Old World just to have a look at worthless volumes. I have businessin D’Haran, after all. As the new Lord Rahl, I will need to consolidate myauthority.”“His Excellency has anticipated that this would be inconvenient for you, and sohas suggested that he will have his wizards pull out things of interest and havethem sent to you for your analysis.”Clarissa knew what the Sister was talking about. Before they had arrived, Nathanhad told her that he probably wouldn’t be allowed to have a look at theprophecies Jagang possessed, much less be told where they all were. Jagang wouldwant Nathan to see only selected volumes that had been screened by others,first. Nathan finally turned his full attention to the two Sisters. “In duetime, in due time. Once we have worked together and brought the New World totask, and have come to fully trust one another’s word, then I will happilyaccept visits by Jagang’s lapdogs, but until then. I’m sure our emperorunderstands that I am leery of allowing those with the gift to know exactlywhere I am. That is why I will be leaving at once.”Sister Jodelle sighed. “As I said, he would be happy to have it brought to you.But you can understand that he would have cause for concern to have a wizard ofyour power, whose mind is a mystery to him, approach too closely. While he iseager for this arrangement, he is a man who takes precautions.”“As am I,” Nathan said. “That is why I can’t allow the book to be brought to me.Having you meet me here again today is the last risk I intend to take. In themeantime, I want that book. Until I have it, I have no way of knowing if it’ssafe for me to go to D’Hara.”“His Excellency understands, and has no disagreement with your request. Hisobjective will soon be complete, and he therefore has no further need of thebook. Besides, a world without people to work for him would be of little value.“The book only works for Sister Amelia, since she was the one who went to theTemple of the Winds lo recover it. He has offered to let you have either thebook, or Sister Amelia. If you wish, we will send her to you.”“So Jagang will know where I am? I don’t think so, Sister. I’ll take the book.”“That, too, is agreeable with His Excellency. We can send it, or have someonemeet you, to deliver it to you. He objects only to you, yourself, coming to getit, for safety reasons, as I’ve already explained.”Nathan rubbed his jaw as he thought. “What if I sent someone back with you? Arepresentative, someone with my interests in mind? Someone loyal to me, so I hadno need to fear that Jagang would delve into their mind and find where I was tobe? Someone without the gift? He would have no need to tear them.”“Without the gift?” Sister Jodelle thought a moment. “And we could test them,without your shields around them, to insure that they in fact did not have thegift?”“Of course. I want this relationship with Jagang to work for both of us. Iwouldn’t jeopardize it by trying to deceive him. I want to build trust, notdestroy it.” Nathan hesitated, clearing his throat. “But you understand, though,that this person is... valued, to me. If anything were to happen to her. I wouldview it in the harshest light.” Both Sisters smiled. “Her. Of course,” SisterWillamina said.“Why. Nathan”-Sister Jodelle rocked on her heels as she smiled-”you really havebeen enjoying your freedom.”“I mean it,” Nathan said in a level tone. “Anything happens to her, and theentire agreement is ended. I’m sending her as a show of my faith in Jagang, inour agreement. I’m taking the first step of trust, so that the emperor will seethat I am sincere.”“We understand, Nathan.” Sister Jodelle said, more serious now. “No harm willcome to her.”“When she leaves with the book. I want her escorted to safety, beyond Jagang’stroops, and then left to be on her way. If she is followed, I will know it. Ifshe is followed, I will view it in the most unfavorable light-as a sign ofhostility toward me, and an attempt on my life.”Sister Jodelle nodded. “Understood, and very reasonable. She comes with us, getsthe book. and returns safely to you, without being followed, and we are allhappy.”“Good,” Nathan said decisively, as if closing the deal. “After tonight, Jagangwill be rid of Richard Rahl. When I have the book safely in hand. then I willhave the southern army surrender to Jagang’s expeditionary force, as my part ofthe bargain.”Sister Jodelle bowed. “We have an agreement. Lord Rahl. His Excellency wishes towelcome you to the empire as his second.”Nathan turned toward the door Clarissa was kneeling behind. Clarissa jumped upand rushed to the far window. She drew back the drapes with a hand and pretendedto be gazing out when she heard the door open. “Clarissa,” Nathan called.She turned to see him standing in the doorway, holding the doorknob. Beyond him,she could see the two Sisters watching. “Yes, Nathan? You wish something?”“Yes, Clarissa. I would like you to go on a small journey for me-a bit ofbusiness. I need you to go with my friends out here.”Clarissa guided her full skirts around the writing table and followed him outinto the other room. Nathan introduced her to the two Sisters.The two women wore knowing, smug smiles. They glanced to her cleavage and thenat each other. Clarissa had that feeling of being judged as a whore, again.“Clarissa, you will leave at once, with these ladies. When you reach yourdestination, they will give you a book. You will then return with it. Youremember where I told you we would be off to, tomorrow?”“Yes, Nathan.”“You will meet me there, after you have the book. No one. no one at all, is toknow where it is you will be meeting me. Do you understand?”“Yes, Nathan.”“I’ll go see to getting her a horse,” Sister Willamina said.“A horse?” Clarissa gasped. “I’ve never ridden a horse in my life. I can’t ridea horse.”Nathan waved patience at the sudden hitch in their plans. “I have a carriage.I’ll have it brought around, and Clarissa can take that. There, is thatsatisfactory to all?”Sister Jodelle shrugged. “Horse, carriage, it makes no difference to us, as longas we can test her for the gift, first.”‘Test her all you want. I will order the carriage while you test her, and thenClarissa can pack a few things.”“Agreed.”“Good. That’s settled then.”Nathan turned to Clarissa, putting his back to the two Sisters. “It won’t belong, my dear, and we’ll be together again.” He adjusted the locket hanging froma fine gold chain, straightening it for her. He looked into her eyes. “I will bewaiting for you. I’ve told these friends of mine that if anything happens toyou, I will be more than unhappy.”Clarissa stared into his wonderful eyes. “Thank you, Nathan. I will bring thebook, as you ask.”Nathan kissed her cheek. “Thank you, my dear. That’s good of you. Safe journey,then.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 57Even with the gathering dark, brooding clouds, an eerie calm hung over thesummit of Mount Kymermosst. The Andolians cast uneasy glances skyward. As Kahlanwatched Richard dismount, his golden cloak hung limp in the unnaturally stillair. Drefan offered her his hand to help her down. Kahlan pretended not to seeit.In the fading light, the ruins were only ghostly shapes, the bones of some longextinct monster, waiting to come back to life and swallow her up. Though thiswas the night of the full moon, the leaden clouds would totally obscure it. Whenthe last of the daylight soon left, it would be black as death atop the forsakenpeak.Nadine stood close to Richard as he stared off toward the edge of the cliff.Drefan stood nearby, not wanting to look too forward to the woman who wouldshortly be his wife, but not wanting to ignore her, either. Like Nadine, hedidn’t seem to view this as the end of his happiness.After the horses were secured, the legate and Cara ushered the brides andbridegrooms to a crumbling, circular garden structure made up of curved stonebenches on one side and broken columns on the other. The top piece, connectingthe columns. was mostly missing, joining only four of the ten stone columns.In the distance, in the fading light, Kahlan could still see the knife edge ofthe cliff, and the black swath of mountains beyond. Somewhere out there was theTemple of the Winds.Kahlan was directed to sit on a curved stone bench beside Drefan, and Richard,two benches away, was told to sit beside Nadine. Kahlan glanced over. andsaw-Richard looking back: but then Drefan leaned forward and blocked her view ofRichard. She turned her attention to the legate and Cara standing before them.The six sisters stood behind their husband.“We are gathered here,” the legate and Cara said as one. “to wed Richard Rahland Nadine Brighton, and to wed Kahlan Amnell and Drefan Rahl. This is the mostsolemn of rites; it binds in the most earnest of vows. and commits these matesfor life. This marriage is sanctioned and witnessed by the spirits themselves.”Kahlan stared at the weeds sprouting from the cracks in the disintegrating stonefloor as she only partly listened to the words about loyalty, fidelity, andobligation. It was so warm and muggy that she could hardly breathe. Her whiteMother Confessor’s dress was sticking to her back. Sweat trickled down betweenher breasts.Kahlan’s head came up when Drefan started lifting her with a hand under her arm.“What? What is it?”“It is time,” he said. “Come.”And then she was standing before the legate and Cara. with Drefan beside her,and three of the legate’s wives at her other side as her attendants. She lookedpast Drefan to see Richard standing beside Nadine, with the other threeAndolians serving as her attendants. Nadine wore a smile.“If anyone has any objections to the wedding of these people, they must speaknow, for once it is done, it cannot be undone.”“I have an objection,” Richard said. “What is it?” the legate asked.“The winds said that this had to be of our own free will. It is not. We arebeing coerced into this. We are being told that people will die if we don’t dothis. I don’t do this of my own free will; I do this only to save lives.”“Do you wish to save the lives of the people who will die if the magic stolenfrom the Temple of the Winds is not stopped?” the legate asked. “Of course Ido.”“This wedding is part of that attempt. If you do not go through with it, thenthey will die. You wish to save them. This qualifies as your free will as far asthe spirits involved are concerned.“If you wish to withdraw your agreement to this, then it must be now, before thevows. Afterwards, you may not change your mind.” Muggy silence hung in the air.She was plummeting helpless into the inky depths. It was all happening too fast.Too fast for her to get a breath.“I wish to speak with Richard, if I am to do this. Before I do this,” Kahlansaid. “Alone.”The legate and Cara stared at her a moment. “Then hurry,” they said as one.“There is not much time. The moon rises.”They both walked far enough away from the circle that Kahlan could be reasonablysure they couldn’t be heard. She stood close, facing him.She wanted Richard to save them from this. He had to save them. He had to dosomething, now, or it would be too late.“Richard, we’re out of time. Is there anything? Can you think of anything at allto stop this? Any way we can still save those people and not have to do this?”Richard stood close to her, and yet a world away. “I’m sorry. I don’t have anyother solution. Forgive me,” he whispered. “I have failed you.”She shook her head. “No, you didn’t. Don’t ever think that, Richard. I don’t.The spirits have made it impossible for us to win. They wish this, and have putus in a double bind.“But at least, if we go through with this, Jagang will not win. That is moreimportant. How many lovers, like us, will be able to have a life, now, havehappiness, now, have children, now, because of the sacrifice we make thisnight?”.Richard smiled that smile that melted her heart. “That’s one reason I love youso much: your passion. Even if I never see you again, I’ve known true happinesswith you. True love. How many ever experience even this small taste?”Kahlan swallowed. “Richard, if we do this, we have to be true to our vows, don’twe. We can’t... still be together... sometimes, can we?”The way his jaw trembled, and his eyes filled with tears, was more than answerenough.Just before they fell into each other’s arms, Cara was there, between them. “Itis time. What are your wishes?”“I have a lot of them,” Richard said with sudden venom. “Which do you want tohear?”“The winds wish to know if you will do this, or not.”“We will do it.” Richard growled. “But the spirits had better know that I willhave revenge.”“The winds are simply doing the only thing they can do to stop the death causedby what was stolen from them,” Cara said with sudden compassion, but still withthat haunting quality that told Kahlan that it wasn’t Cara speaking, but thewinds. “They do not do this out of animosity.”“A wise man once told me that dead is dead, no matter the how.” Richard said. Hedefiantly took Kahlan’s hand and walked with her back to the circle of stone,where they each took their places beside their chosen.Kahlan wore her Confessor’s face as she stood beside Drefan. She felt pain forRichard; he had not grown up being taught how to subjugate his emotions, hislongings, his desires-for duty. She had had a lifetime to prepare for this finaltorment. He had had a lifetime to prepare for the opposite, expecting he wouldhave happiness. Kahlan had only briefly felt the warmth of that flame.With deliberate care, she ignored the words spoken to Nadine, and then toDrefan, words of loyalty and devotion to their mate. Kahlan instead focused hermind on Richard, hoping to pass to him some strength, hoping that he could getthrough this, so that they could save those stricken and stop the plague.Richard still had to get into the Temple of the Winds. He needed strength.Soon, the ceremony would be over, and they would head back to Aydindril. Perhapsthey would have to wait until Richard went into the temple, and did what he hadto do, and then they would return to Aydindril. In any event, it wouldn’t belong, and she would be going home, home to the place she had grown up, to a lifeof duty to which she had been bred. “Yes or no?” the legate said. Kahlan lookedup. “What?”He glanced up at the threatening clouds and then took a hurried breath. “Do youswear to honor this man, to obey him as the master of your home, to care for hisneeds when he is well, and when he is ill, and to be his loyal wife in this lifeas long as you both live?”Kahlan glanced up at Drefan. She wondered what he had sworn to. “I swear towhatever it is that is required of me to stop the plague.”“Yes or no?”Kahlan let out an angry sigh. “Is this what is required of me to stop the magicstolen from the winds from killing people?”“It is.”In her mind, she swore the oath, but to Richard, not Drefan. She would swearwords aloud to Drefan, but her heart would always be Richard’s. Kahlan’s fiststightened. “Then, yes, I swear to do what is required to stop the plague. Iswear not one stitch more. nor for one breath longer, than that required of me.”“Then in full view of the spirits, and by the power of the spirits, you are nowpronounced husband and wife.”Kahlan doubled over in sudden pain. It felt as if her insides had been tornapart. She tried to pull a breath. It wouldn’t come. She saw swirling colorbefore her wide eyes.Drefan put his arm around her waist. “What is it? Kahlan, what’s wrong?” Herlegs buckled, but he held her up. “It is the spirits,” came the legate andCara’s voice together, “they have bound her power. She is to live this marriageas any woman wed to a man. Her power would have interfered.”“You can’t do that!” Richard screamed. “She’ll be defenseless! You can’t takeher power!”“Her power was not taken, but walled away so she cannot use it for the term ofher vows to her husband, Drefan Rahl. It is done,” the two said together. “Youwill now swear to the vows, or you will lose your chance to help the winds.”Kahlan stared at the ground, feeling a swirl of emptiness, feeling the voidbetween her mind and her power, as she listened to similar words spoken beforeRichard. She couldn’t hear his answer, but he must have said what was requiredbecause the legate pronounced him and Nadine husband and wife.They had not only taken her love, but her Confessor’s power, as the price of thepath. The emptiness threatened to smother her. The profound and sudden sense ofloss clouded her mind with blackness darker than the falling night.Drefan took her arm. “Here, you’d better sit down. Even in this light, as ahealer I can see that you are not well.”Kahlan let him guide her back to a bench and help her to sit. “Your wife will befine,” the legate said. He looked up at the boiling sky. “Richard Rahl, DrefanRahl, come with me.”“Where are we going?” Richard wanted to know. “We are to prepare you toconsummate the marriage.”Kahlan’s head came up. Even in the darkness, she could see that Richard was nearto exploding in rage. His hand was on his sword.Drefan rubbed Kahlan’s back in sympathy. “You will be all right. Everything willbe all right. Don’t worry, I will take care of you, as I promised.”“Thank you, Drefan,” she managed through the anguish. Drefan left her and strodeto Richard. Drefan gripped Richard’s arm and bent close, speaking to him in awhisper. Kahlan could see Richard rake his hands back through his hair and nodoccasionally. Whatever Drefan was saying was cooling Richard.After Drefan and Richard parted, the legate and Cara looked back to Nadine andKahlan. “You two will wait here.”Kahlan huddled on the stone bench as Richard and Drefan were led off in thedarkness toward the cliff, toward the two buildings, one to either side of theroad that ended abruptly at the edge. It was becoming so dark that Kahlan couldhardly make out Nadine’s face as she sat down beside her on the stone bench. Thesix sisters had gone back to the horses, sucking their fingers as they watchedthe sky.“I’m sorry. About your magic, I mean. I didn’t know they would do that to you. Iguess you’ll be like any other woman, now.”“I guess.”“Kahlan,” Nadine said, “I won’t lie to you and tell you that I’m sorry that I’mthe one who married Richard, but I will tell you that I’ll do my best to makehim happy.”“Nadine, you just don’t understand, do you? You can be as kind as pudding tohim, or you can be as mean as nettles, and it won’t make any difference. Withthe pain he’s in, if you do your worst, it would be a bee sting after abeheading.”Nadine giggled uncomfortably. “Well, I know a poultice for a bee sting. Richardwill see. I will-”“You have already promised me that you would be kind to him, Nadine. Iappreciate that you will be kind to him, but at the moment. I’m not in the moodto hear the details of just how kind you are going to be.”“Sure. I understand.” Nadine picked at the stone on the bench. “Not the way Ihad my wedding pictured in my head.”“Me neither.”“Maybe I can make the rest of it the way I pictured.” Her tone had turned coldand vindictive. “You’ve made me to feel a fool for wanting Richard, for thinkingI might have him. You’ve taken the pleasure out of my wedding day, but you won’ttake the pleasure out of the rest of it.”“I’m sorry, Nadine, if you think that I have-”“Now that I have him, I intend to show him how a woman can really please a man.He’ll see. He’ll see that I can be just as good a woman for him as you. Youthink I can’t, but I can.”Nadine leaned close. “I’ll have Richard’s eyes spinning in his head before thisnight is out. Then we’ll see who the better woman is. and how much he missesyou. When you’re lying there with Richard’s brother, listen close, and you’llhear my screams of pleasure. The screams of pleasure Richard gives me. Not you-me!”Nadine stormed away to stand with her arms folded in a huff. Kahlan put her facein her hands. The spirits weren’t content to destroy her, they had to twist theknife.Cara and the legate returned. “It is time,” they said as one. Kahlan rosewoodenly, to stand, waiting to be told what to do next. The legate turned toCara.“This storm is going to break soon.” The legate turned to peer up at theblackness. “My wives and I must be off this mountain.” He gripped Cara’s arm.“The winds speak to you the same as they speak to me. Can you take them?”“Yes. It is nearly done. I can finish it,” Cara said. “The winds will pass themessage through me as well as through you.” Without further word, he scurriedoff into the darkness.Cara’s strong fingers gripped under Kahlan’s arm. “Come with me,” she said inthat icy voice of the winds. Kahlan dug in her heels. “Cara, please. I can’t.”“You can, and you will, or the chance will pass and the plague will rage on.”Kahlan pulled back. “No, you don’t understand. I can’t. I’m having my moon flow.It isn’t finished yet. I can’t... do this. Not now.”Cara’s sinister glare drew close. “It will not prevent you from consummatingyour marriage. You will do this, or all hope of stopping the plague is lost. Itis not finished, yet. You must do your part in this-indulge in this. It must benow. Tonight. Or would you rather the dying continue unabated?”With Nadine on one side of her, and Kahlan on the other. Cara led them down theroad, through the darkness, toward the edge of the cliff.Standing in the black night at the edge of the cliff, Kahlan felt numb and lost.She didn’t know how long Cara was gone with Nadine, taking her to Richard in thecrumbling building to the right. She felt Cara’s hand under her arm again. “Thisway,” came the icy voice. Kahlan let the woman lead her to the ruins on theleft. Kahlan could hardly see a thing. Cara, led by the winds, had no troublenegotiating the halls and rooms in the wreck of a building.They came to a doorway. Kahlan could just make out Drefan’s sword standing upagainst the wall outside. Her fingers rested on its leather-bound hilt. Inside,she could just discern the rectangles where windows once stood. Beyond was theedge of the cliff, and the emptiness where the Temple of the Winds had oncebeen.“This is your wife,” Cara said with that icy, horrid voice as she spoke into theroom. “Here is your husband,” she said to Kahlan.“This marriage must be consummated. It is now your duty to do so. The winds haverequirements. You may ask no more questions. Do not speak. The winds havereasons, and it is not for you to know them, only to obey, if you wish to endthe death.“As the test narrows, it becomes more intense.“You must now lie as husband and wife. If either of you utters so much as oneword, the test will end, and entry into the Temple of the Winds will be denied.There can be no appeal. The stolen magic will rage on, as will the death causedby it.“Only after you have fulfilled the requirements of the consummation will thewinds come. After the winds come-and you will have no doubt that it hashappened-you may then speak to one another. Not before.”Cara turned Kahlan around and helped her out of her dress and the rest of herthings. It wasn’t hard for Kahlan not to speak; she had nothing to say.Kahlan felt the black night air on her naked flesh. She glanced down at Drefan’ssword, thinking briefly that when it was over, she could always use it onherself. If not, if he denied her access to it, there was always the cliff.Cara gripped Kahlan by the wrist and led her forward. Forcefully, Cara made herkneel down, and then lean forward until Kahlan felt the edge of the pallet.“Your husband awaits you here. Go to him.” Kahlan heard Cara’s footsteps fadeinto the distance. Then she was alone with Drefan."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 58As Kahlan felt her way, her hand brushed Drefan’s hairy leg. She moved off tothe side, to lie down beside him. There was a blanket over straw, or somethingsofter than bare wood, anyway. At least it didn’t hurt her back as would havethe hard ground.She lay on the pallet, staring up into the blackness with wide eyes. Shecouldn’t see anything, other than the vague indication of the windows beforethem. She made an effort to slow her breathing, although she could do nothing toslow her panicked pulse.This wasn’t the worst thing, she told herself. Not the worst thing in the world.Not at all. This wasn’t rape. Exactly.After a time, she felt Drefan’s hand settle on her belly. Kahlan shoved it awayas she stifled a cry.She shouldn’t have done that, she told herself. What was a hand, compared to theplague? How many people in agony with the plague would gladly have traded placeswith her? Not the worst thing at all, a gentle hand.Drefan’s hand found hers, trying to give it a squeeze of reassurance. She yankedher hand away as if a snake had touched her. She didn’t want his reassurance.She had not vowed to hold his hand. She had not vowed to accept his reassurance.She had committed to being his wife. not to holding his hand. She would let himdo to her what she must let him do to her, but she didn’t have to hold his hand.Kahlan frantically tried to reason with herself. Richard had to get into theTemple of the Winds. The Temple of the Winds demanded this as the price of thepath. The spirit of Chandalen’s grandfather had warned her that she must notshirk her duty. She remembered his words all too well:I have not been shown the price, but I forewarn you that I do know that there isno way for you to circumvent or avoid it. It must be as it will he revealed toyou, or all will be lost. I ask that when the winds show you the path. you takeit, lest what I have shown you comes to be.Kahlan remembered the scenes of mass death the spirit had shown her. If shefailed to do as the winds asked, what she had been shown would come to pass. Shehad to let Drefan do this. Stalling would not make it any easier. This couldn’tbe easy for Drefan. Couldn’t be easy at all, what with the way she shoved awayhis attempts at tenderness. That made her angry all over again. She didn’t wanthis tenderness.What did she want? Did she want him to be rough? Of course she had to let himtouch her. How could he do this if he didn’t touch her? Richard had to get intothe Temple of the Winds. She had to let Drefan do this.Kahlan reached over and took Drefan’s wrist. She put his hand back where he hadtried to put it before, on her belly. She let go of his hand. It stayed there.What was he waiting for? She wanted to scream at him to get it over with, to doit and be done. To take what was his brother’s by heart if not by vow.She lay there, with Drefan’s hand on her, listening to the dead silence of thenight. She realized that she was listening for sounds coming from Nadine andRichard. She shut her eyes.Drefan’s hand moved to her breast. Fists at her sides, she forced herself toremain still. She had to let him. She tried to think of other things. Shesilently recited rote language lessons of her youth, trying to ignore his hand.But she couldn’t.He was being gentle, but that was no consolation. Even his touch was aviolation. How gently he did it made no difference, didn’t make it right. Thathe was now her husband made no difference to her. She knew in her heart it waswrong, and that made it a violation.In her mind, she screamed at herself. She was being worse than childish. She wasthe Mother Confessor, and had faced much worse than this, much worse than a manfor whom she had no feelings being this close, this intimate.But she was no longer the Mother Confessor. The Temple of the Winds, thespirits, had taken that, too, from her.Kahlan gasped in a breath and held it tight as Drefan’s hand roamed down herbelly and finally settled between her legs. She remembered Drefan doing that toCara. Now he did it to her.She hated him. She was married to a man she hated.Cara had felt it, the same as Kahlan could feel it, now. Cara hadn’t been sochildish about it. Cara wouldn’t be this foolish. Kahlan let Drefan’s hand dowhat it would.This was to save lives. She had to save all those innocent people from theplague sent by Jagang. Her people couldn’t be saved without her. It was herduty.Drefan suddenly rose up. The dark shape of him hovered over her. His knee pushedgently between her thighs, urging her to open her legs. It would be over soon,she told herself, as he put his other knee between her legs, too.The hulking shape of him lowered over her. He was big, as big as Richard. Shefeared he was going crush her, but he didn’t. He held himself up on his elbows,so he wouldn’t hurt her. He was being tender, and she was only making it harderfor him. He had to do this, and she had to let him.Kahlan grimaced. She wasn’t ready. She held her breath. It was too late not tobe ready; Drefan was there. She bit her lower lip as she winced.She felt as helpless as she had ever felt in her entire life. She was married toDrefan, not Richard, and Drefan, not Richard, was having her. Everything waslost.Her eyes squeezed shut, Kahlan pressed her fists to her shoulders as he moved inher. Tears trickled from the corners of her eyes. Her nose stuffed up as shewept silently, and she had to open her mouth to breathe. She wanted to wail inanguish, but she instead had to remind herself to breathe. She couldn’t seem tostop holding her breath.It took longer than she had hoped, but not as long as she feared. Finished atlast, Drefan rolled off her, onto his back. He had accomplished his task, but heseemed not to have relished it. She was somehow relieved that he hadn’t enjoyedit. He lay there, recovering his breath, as she finally let hers out. It wasover. She told herself that it hadn’t been so bad. It was nothing, really. Shehardly felt anything. She had foolishly balked, and here it was. over already.It wasn’t so bad as she had feared. It was nothing, really. But it was. She didfeel something. She felt defiled.Drefan reached out, his fingers tenderly, sympathetically brushing a tear fromher cheek. She shoved his hand away. She didn’t want his sympathy. She didn’twant him touching her. She hadn’t agreed to him touching her. just toconsummating the marriage. His touch wasn’t part of it.She remembered being with Richard. She remembered her hot need of him. Sheremembered the wild passion. She remembered her screams of sheer pleasure. Whywas this so different?Because she didn’t love Drefan, that was why. In fact. she was beginning torealize that she loathed him. There was something about him that she didn’tlike, and it was more than just that memory of his hand on Cara. There wassomething deceptive about him, something devious. She hadn’t consciouslyrealized it before, but she could see guile in his blue eyes.Kahlan wondered why she would think that. He had just consummated theirmarriage, and he had been as gentle as he possibly could be while still doingit. He could easily have done anything he wanted; her power was locked away. Shecouldn’t stop him. Yet he had tried to be sympathetic, understanding.Still, it seemed a wonder to her that it could be so different from when she hadbeen with Richard. She would give anything, almost, to have that pleasure again.She longed for that fulfillment, that satisfaction. The sating of lust.Drefan’s breathing evened out after a time. Kahlan lay there, in the darkness,beside him, beside her new husband, waiting. Why hadn’t the Temple of the Windscome? She had done her part.Maybe Richard hadn’t. Kahlan wondered if he could. After all, she had only tolie there. Richard had to be aroused. How could he be aroused, over there,knowing that his brother was over here, having his way with the woman Richardloved?Kahlan had seen the look in Richard’s eyes, the look of wild jealousy, at themere mention of what Shota said-that Kahlan would marry another. Kahlan hadnever seen such a look in his eyes before, and at the time there hadn’t reallybeen a reason for it. Now there was.No, Nadine would see to it that Richard did what he needed to do. If there wasone thing Kahlan had confidence in, it was Nadine’s desire to consummate thatmarriage.Nadine was a beautiful woman. She was more than enthusiastic. How could Richardnot be aroused? He knew he had to do it. He would have no reason to try toresist her urging. Maybe Richard was thinking of it as revenge against hisbrother, Michael, for taking Nadine. Perhaps that was how he would get throughit.Kahlan knew that Nadine was having the time of her life. This was Nadine’sdream. This was Kahlan’s nightmare.The dark sky she could just perceive out the windows seemed to boil, as it hadall day and all night. The air remained dead still and sticky. The stormwouldn’t break. It threatened, but it would not come.Kahlan laid her wrist over her forehead as she rested, waiting. Her legs hurt,and she realized that it was because she was pressing her knees together. Shelet her legs relax. Drefan had done his duty. He was finished. It was over. Shecould relax.Kahlan shut her eyes when she heard Nadine’s distant laughter drifting throughthe night air. The woman was as good as her word. Did Richard have to make herlaugh? Couldn’t he just do his duty? No, Richard would not make Nadine laugh.Nadine laughed for Kahlan’s benefit.The night dragged on endlessly. Where was the Temple of the Winds? Drefan madeno attempt to touch her again, and she was thankful for that. He lay there, onhis back, waiting with her.Each hour that passed brought no change. From time to time, Kahlan drifted offto sleep. Nadine’s throaty laughter brought her awake with a jolt.Kahlan wanted to slap Richard. How long was he going to make this go on? Hecould have had Nadine three times by now. Maybe he had. Maybe when the Temple ofthe Winds didn’t come, he kept trying. Nadine would like that. Kahlan felt hercheeks burning.Drefan was silent as he lay beside her. The winds had said that they couldn’ttalk. She guessed that Nadine’s laughter didn’t count; she used no words. Herlaughter carried message enough.Kahlan sighed. Sooner or later, the winds would come. They had all done asrequired. Had she, though? What was it Cara had said? You must do your part inthis-indulge in this.Drefan had indulged. He had been satisfied. Nadine certainly was indulging.Richard must have. Kahlan hadn’t. She hadn’t “indulged.”She dismissed the idea. It had to be something else. Maybe the winds were justwaiting for Nadine to finally have enough. That would fit the way the Temple ofthe Winds had done everything else, twisting the pain for Richard and Kahlan.Making them suffer.As the night dragged on, and recollecting Cara’s words about indulging, Kahlanthought again about the time she had been with Richard in that place betweenworlds. She had felt the kind of pleasure that other woman felt-the indulgencenot only in love, but in lust.Kahlan had been so frustrated lately, waiting to be with Richard, waiting forthat closeness again, waiting to be married to him so they could be together ashusband and wife. Waiting for that satisfaction again. It was so near, she hadbeen so close, so ready, and then it all fell apart, leaving her hopes dashedand needs unfulfilled.Now, for the first time, she was free of her Confessor’s power, free to takepleasure from a man, not for love, but for the sheer indulgence of pleasure. Shewas free to enjoy what other women enjoyed. Here she was, lying next to herhusband, and not an unattractive man at all, and she was feeling frustration forthe need of Richard.Was she to live the rest of her life being denied a simple pleasure of life thatshe was now free to indulge?But she didn’t love Drefan. Without love, the passion was empty. Still, it waspassion, and if not ideal, at least she could have that much satisfaction. Thespirits had taken everything else from her. They had taken Richard, the onlything she really wanted out of life. Would she let them take simple pleasure,too? What else had she. now? This was her husband. She was condemned to live therest of her life with him.Must it be without at least some small release of pent-up need? Wasn’t sheentitled to at least that much after all she had sacrificed? They had takeneverything else from her: her only love in life; her Confessor’s power. You mustdo your part in this-indulge in this.What if that was why the winds hadn’t come? What if it was because she hadn’tindulged?Drefan rolled over on his stomach and sighed. He was frustrated by the wait,too. Or maybe he was tending to his auras.She thought about Drefan’s tight trousers, and the way she caught herselflooking. Drefan was a handsome man; he was built like Richard. Drefan was herhusband.Her anger at the spirits for taking everything from her was what finally madesomething inside her snap. This was all she had. She was entitled to this much-to release.When her hand touched Drefan’s back, he jumped. Kahlan smoothed her hand acrossthe muscles of his back. and he settled. She let herself feel his muscles, asshe used to feel Richard’s muscles, feel his shape. She took a deep breath, andshe let herself go.Kahlan’s hand moved down Drefan’s back. She gritted her teeth as she gripped hisbuttocks. They were as tight as they looked in his trousers. She was lucky, sheguessed; the spirits could have insisted that she marry a repulsive man.Instead, they had insisted that she marry Drefan, and he was far from repulsive.He wasn’t as handsome as Richard, no one was as handsome to her as Richard, butwomen were always fawning over Drefan. Now, he was her husband. He had pledgedto be loyal to her. She had pledged to be loyal to him.This was the only pleasure she was to be allowed. This was all the spirits hadleft her. At least she could have this much-have what she was entitled to.Kahlan seized Drefan’s hip and rolled him over, toward her. She hooked her legover his, and let her hand roam over his chest. Drefan didn’t react. Maybe hewas surprised by her change of behavior. Maybe he was confused. She would haveto unconfuse him. She gently pinched one of his nipples, then let her hand slideacross his flat stomach, and down.Kahlan found that Drefan was in no condition to do her any good. If she wantedto have her pleasure, she would have to change that.She kissed his chest. She trailed wet kisses down his stomach. His breathingseemed slow. Kahlan felt frustrated anger that he wasn’t taking the hint. Shewas tired of being frustrated, while everyone else wasn’t.She decided that if she wanted to have satisfaction, it was up to her to see toit that she got what she wanted. No one would give it to her-she would have totake it. Kahlan let her tongue, her kisses, glide the rest of the way downDrefan’s taut belly.When she took him in her mouth, she tasted her own blood. She forced herself toignore the taste as she urged him to react.At first she thought he wasn’t going to, but when she lost herself in the eroticnature of what she was doing, he finally did. He came back as strong as before.By the time Drefan was fully ready, Kahlan was panting with need. Once she haddecided to have her pleasure, she became insistent. Drefan was her husband now.It was his duty to fulfill her needs, too, not just his own. Kahlan’s head wasspinning with the want of release. That it was Drefan no longer mattered. In hermind, she imagined it was Richard. At that thought, she moaned with longing andclimbed atop him, straddling his hips.This time, she was ready to accept him. This time, she wanted him. She shut itout of her mind that this was Drefan and imagined it was Richard. Since shecouldn’t see Drefan’s blue eyes, it wasn’t hard to envision it was Richard,instead.She remembered the things she did with Richard, and did those things. Sherelived that experience in her imagination. Her mouth gaped. She gasped for air.Sweat ran down her body as she moved atop him, writhing forcefully against him.Drefan was panting now, too. She needed to have release from all the frustrationthat had built up for so long-all the times she had kissed Richard, and wantedto do more; all the times he had touched her, and she had wanted him to do more.Now, he was.Kahlan leaned forward, to kiss him. Drefan turned his face away. She scooped herarm under his head, and held him to her chest, instead. His face felt hotagainst her breasts. The roughness of his unshaved face excited her as she slidher sweaty flesh against him. It made her pant all the more.She was just about to scream at him to put his hands on her, when she rememberedthat she wasn’t allowed to utter so much as a word. She seized his wrist and putfirst one hand where she wanted it, and then the other, to hold her bottom whileshe moved-so she could imagine it was Richard holding her again, needing her.She wanted to feel him gripping her in his big hands while she moved.For the first time since she had last been with Richard, she felt wild pleasure,wild lust, a wild, desperate need. That it was with Drefan no longer mattered toher. She wanted only release.It came with stunning, ridged shivers. Her sharp moan shook her shoulders. Herlegs stiffened to stone. Her toes clawed. She slammed herself down on him as thewanton fulfillment of lust inundated her. She gave herself over to itcompletely, and with helpless, unbridled abandon let it run free. She gaspedsharply again, the cry following in the echoing wake of the first. It seemedthat it lasted an eternity, as if it was almost too much to endure. With a finalconvulsion, it subsided. At last, it was over.For one twisting moment, she had been free. There was no plague, no peopledying, no responsibility, no duty, no marriage to Drefan, no Nadine. For thatone moment, she had been free of it all, and she had been immersed ingratification. For that one moment, her heart and her lust had been with Richardagain.Kahlan collapsed to the side of Drefan, panting, getting her wind back, pushingher wet hair back off her face. It occurred to her that he hadn’t reached anysatisfaction this second time. She didn’t care. She had. At the moment, that wasall that mattered: sweet release.For a wonderful moment, she had been free of everything, and had been with herlove, if only in her imagination. Kahlan realized that she was weeping with thejoy of it.She lay on her side, turned away from Drefan, as she recovered. She wiped thetears of pleasure from her face. In the absence of need, she unexpectedly beganto feel ashamed.Dear spirits, what had she just done? She had enjoyed herself, that was all. Shehad needed the release. Then why did she suddenly feel so dirty? Distant thunderrumbled toward them. A hint of embedded lightning flickered in the sky. Kahlanlooked up. out the windows. Another flash, closer, ripped through the insides ofthe roiling clouds, briefly lighting the mountaintop.From the other building. Kahlan heard a long scream from Nadine. Kahlan blockedit from her mind. As much as Nadine’s scream rankled Kahlan, it at least didn’tleave her as frustrated as it had before.Three more screams came from Nadine. Short, piercing, urgent. Kahlan pressed herhands to her ears. Nadine had made her point, couldn’t she just let it be. now?The wind came up, abruptly, as if a great, huge door had opened. The blast ofair hit like an avalanche. The building shuddered. The entire mountain quaked.Kahlan propped herself up on her elbows, peering out the windows. Distantlightning flickered through the turbulent clouds. Thunder rumbled, reverberatingthrough the mountains. Each strike came a little closer.The Temple of the Winds was coming-there was no doubt in her mind. That took herthoughts back to Richard, because it was coming for him. She felt sudden shame.How could she so easily lose track of her heart? How could she find suchpleasure from another man? What was she thinking?She had never felt so dirty in her whole life as she suddenly did now. WithRichard, she had felt wonderful afterward. Now, she was feeling worse by themoment. If Richard ever found out, he would never understand.Richard would never know. There was no way for him to find out. Unless Drefantold him. Her heart pounded. She thought about the guile she thought she hadseen in Drefan’s eyes. No. he wouldn’t tell Richard. But what if he did?With a sudden, close strike of lightning. Kahlan sat up straight. She sawsomething out the window-a structure. As the winds had said, there was no doubt.She could talk. now.She spun back to Drefan. She had to secure his silence in this before they leftthis place. If Richard ever found out... The wind lashed at the mountaintop. Thethunder boomed, In the darkness, she reached out and clutched his arm.“Drefan, listen to me. You must promise. You can never tell what just happened,what I just did with you.” Her hand tightened. Her fingernails dug into his arm.“I’ll do whatever you tell me to do for the rest of my life. but you mustpromise me that you will never tell”-ribbons of lightning lit theroom-”Richard...”Thunder crashed, jarring the ground. Lightning snaked along the bottoms of theclouds, lighting the room with a harsh glare. In the flickering flashes, greyeyes were fixed on her. “I think ‘Richard’ already knows.” Kahlan screamed."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 59Kahlan froze. Thoughts crashed through her mind in a confusion of thunderingterror.Her scream came again, ripping through the night, loud enough to be heard overthe sound of the thunder. She couldn’t make herself blink. She couldn’t tear hereyes from Richard’s face.She couldn’t understand, couldn’t make sense of it. The world felt as if it hadturned upside down. Everything tumbled around in her mind, making it impossibleto think.As the lightning lit the room again, she knew only one thing: this was Richard,not Drefan.No look she had ever seen on Richard’s face was as terrifying to Kahlan as theone she saw now. There was nothing in his eyes. Not rage, not lethal commitment,not determination, not a deadly calm countenance, not jealousy, not even emptydisinterest.There was no... soul, in those grey eyes. No heart.Kahlan covered her mouth with both trembling hands. She backed away until herback smacked into the stone wall.He had known from the first instant she had come into the room. Richard couldtell it was her coming into a room. He had known it was her the whole time-fromthe first instant Cara had led her in here.He knew. He had tried to squeeze her hand, to reassure her, to let her know. Shehad pushed his hand away. He had been as gentle as he could. He had tried tobrush her tears away, after. She had pushed his hand away. She hadn’t let himshow her that it was him.Kahlan collapsed to the floor with a wail of horror. “No! Dear spirits, no!”Richard didn’t rush to her, didn’t speak words of comfort, didn’t yell. Instead,he went to where his clothes were lying, near the door, and began gettingdressed.Kahlan scurried to her things nearby. She raced to pull on her underthings,suddenly feeling the humiliation of her nakedness, its reminder of what she hadjust done.She scooped up her dress. She paused, tears streaming down her face. She reachedaround the outside of the doorway and brought the sword and scabbard up beforeher face. It had a leather handle, just as she remembered seeing, not awire-wound hilt. It wasn’t the Sword of Truth, Richard’s sword. It was Drefan’ssword.Kahlan gripped Richard by his wrist as he picked up his pants. “How... this isDrefan’s sword, not yours. It’s Drefan’s sword!”Richard took it from her and leaned it against the wall. “They took your power.You have no way to defend yourself. Drefan will be the one near you, now, notme. I gave him the Sword of Truth so that he could protect you.” His eyesfinally met hers. “I guess this one finds the truth just as well as theother.”-Richard stuffed his leg into his pants. Kahlan snatched his arm again.“Richard, don’t you see? It was you. It was you in here with me, not Drefan. Thespirits mark a distinction-between intent and deed. It wasn’t him. it was youall along!”He pulled his arm away. The spirits might mark a distinction, but he didn’t. ToRichard, the intent was the same as the deed. “Richard, you don’t understand. Itwasn’t what you think.” He shot her a glare of such power that it staggered herback a step. He waited as she stood frozen, unable to find any words to explain.He went back to dressing.Kahlan pulled on her white Confessor’s dress. Outside, the lightning was comingcloser. During some of the closer strikes, she could see an immense structurerising up at the edge of the cliff: the Temple of the Winds. When the flashextinguished. the temple vanished again, and she could see the distant mountainsbeyond, lit by the lightning farther away.“Richard.” she wept as he pulled on a boot, “please, talk to me. Say something.Ask me to explain. Tell me there can be no explanation. Veil at me. Call me awhore. Tell me you hate me. Hit me. Do something! Don’t ignore me!”He turned and picked up his black sleeveless undershirt. As he pulled it on overhis head. she scooped up his black shirt and held it to her breast, hoping tohalt his dressing. “Richard, please! I love you!”His gaze again rose to hers. She thought he was going to say something, butinstead he turned away and retrieved his belt with the leather packs on it. Hesnapped on his wristbands.Kahlan held his shirt to her chest and shook as she watched him hook his belttogether. She didn’t know what to do. He picked up Drefan’s sword and buckled iton.“Richard, please talk to me. Say something. This is the doing of the spirits.Don’t you remember what I told you that grandfather’s spirit told me? The windshave decided that you are the path of the price. They did this to us!”He shot her a look again. The intensity in his eyes extinguished. He saw thatshe wasn’t going to surrender his shirt, so he threw his golden cloak around hisshoulders.As he turned toward the door. Kahlan seized his arm with both her hands andturned him back to her.“Richard, I love you. You’ve got to believe me. I’ll explain this in here to youlater, but for now, you have to believe me. I love you. No other. My heart isyours alone. Dear spirits, please believe me.”Richard gripped her jaw in his hand and wiped a thumb across her lips. He heldhis thumb up for her to see in the pandemonium of lightning. “. . . for the onein white, his true beloved, will betray him in her blood.” His words ripped herheart.Kahlan covered her scream with his shirt as he swept out the door. The one thingshe had sworn she would never do, she had done: she had betrayed him. It couldhave been no worse betrayal. It was a betrayal that had destroyed his heart.Crying hysterically, Kahlan raced after him. out into the wild night. She had todo something to mend that heart. She couldn’t let him endure the pain she hadcaused him. She loved him more than life itself, and she had done the worstthing possible lo him.Outside, the wind howled across the mountain. She could see his black shape, hisbare arms, in the flashes of lightning as he headed for the road.As he reached the edge of the cliff at the end of the road, Kahlan threw herselfon him, dragging him to a halt.The sky was a savage show of violent discharges. Thunder thumped in her bones.Lightning ripped across the sky followed by deafening booms. Beyond the edge,when the most powerful of those bolts struck, the Temple of the Winds was there-but only during those fierce strikes. Between those strikes, there was nothingbut empty space.“Richard, what are you going to do?”“I’m going to stop the plague.”“When will you be back? I’ll wait here. When will you be back?” He stared intoher eyes a long moment as the storm raged around them. “There is nothing herefor me.”Kahlan clutched at him. “Richard, you have to come back. Come back. I’ll behere, waiting. I love you. Dear spirits, I need you. Richard, you have to comeback to me!”“You have a husband. You have given him an oath... and everything else.”“Richard, don’t leave me alone,” Kahlan wailed, on the edge of hysteria. “If youdon’t come back, I’ll never forgive you.” Richard turned to the edge of thecliff. “Richard, you have a wife! You have to come back!” Thunder shuddered themountain.He looked back over his shoulder. “Nadine is dead. I am no longer bound by myoath to her. You have a husband, and an oath. There is nothing here for me.”Brutal cords of lightning slammed into the road beyond the edge of the cliff,bringing the Temple of the Winds into full view. Golden cloak billowing outbehind, Richard leaped into the lightning. “Richard! I’m here! I’m here for you!We can find a way! Please come back to me! “When the frenetic flash cut off, the temple was gone. Another flash came, andthe soaring towers were back for a second, weaker this time, and then goneagain.Kahlan dropped to the ground, clutching Richard’s black shirt to herself. Shehad destroyed him.From the side, Kahlan saw a streak of red. It was Cara, racing for the edge ofthe cliff. She leaped just as another flash erupted, lighting the Temple of theWinds into the world of life. She landed on the road in the sky, and when theflash was gone, so was the Temple of the Winds, Richard, and Cara.Devastated, Kahlan stared silently at the rampaging storm, seeing from time totime the towering, phantom temple in another world. It never looked solid enoughagain, or she would have jumped across. She should have. She couldn’t understandwhy she hadn’t. Why had she just stood here? Because Richard didn’t want her.She had betrayed him.How could he do this to her? He said he would always love her. He said theywould be together in the next world. He made her promises. He swore his eternallove. So had she, and she had betrayed him.From somewhere out in the storm. Kahlan heard the distant sound of laughter. Themalevolent chuckle made her skin crawl. Drefan strolled up beside her. He wasalone. “Where’s Nadine?” Kahlan asked.Drefan cleared his throat. “When the lightning came. and she saw it was me, andnot Richard, she screamed. She went crazy. She leaped over the edge of themountain.”Kahlan stared up at him. Richard knew. He told her Nadine was dead. Richard wasa wizard. She had seen that, too, in his eyes, at the end, before he jumpedacross. She saw magic in his eyes. “Where’s Richard?” Kahlan stared out at theempty air. at the black wall of night. “Gone.”On the road to the Temple of the Winds, in the eerie silence, Richard drew hissword. Its alien feel surprised him for an instant, until he recalled whosesword it was.He was no longer the Seeker of Truth. He had had all the truth he could stand.It wasn’t night, here, nor day, yet there was light. It wasn’t likesunlight-more like an overcast day, with no hint of exactly where the sun was.But he knew that there was no sun here. This was not the world of life.This was a part of the underworld-an isolated, remote, obscure niche in theworld of the dead. It was as if the wizards had found an out-of-the-way hole inwhich to hide the Temple of the Winds. It had been similarly hidden when in theworld of life.The dark walls of the immense Temple of the Winds rose up before him, the twintowers soaring up into trailers of mist. The entire side of Mount Kymermosst washere-the whole part that was missing in the world of life.Richard knew where he was going. He knew more than he had ever known before.Knowledge was flooding into his mind. He was a war wizard. The Temple of theWinds had opened a floodgate into his mind. It was feeding him all he needed toknow, and more.He felt as if he were sentient for the first time. Recompense, for the pricedemanded. “Lord Rahl!”A breathless Cara ran up beside him. Agiel in hand, she took up a defensiveposition. Her Agiel would be useless here. For that matter, it would be uselessback in the world of life now.Richard turned to the winds and started out again. It wasn’t far. Not far atall. He knew the way in. “Cara, go home. You don’t belong here.”“Lord Rahl, what happened? I-”“Go home.”She scowled at him as she pushed past to clear his way of any danger. She had noconcept of the dangers here.“I am Mord-Sith. I am here to protect the Lord Rahl.”“I am no longer the Lord Rahl,” Richard whispered.She gazed up at the huge black stone pillars beside the entrance ahead. Besidethem on walls of inky stone banded with copper-colored caps. frozen inraven-black granite, stood the skrin, guardians of the boundary between worlds.Frozen only to Cara’s eyes, not to his.Cara lifted a hand, bidding him to stay back as she peered down the passagewayto the distant entry, checking for danger. There were bones at their feet. “LordRahl, what is this place?”“You can’t go in here, Cara.”“Why not?”Richard turned and looked back toward the way he had come-at everything he wasleaving behind. At nothing. “Because this is the Hall of the Betrayed.”Richard glanced up at the twin skrin, guardians that had left the bones of twowizards here on this walkway, at their feet.Richard remembered well the message the sliph had passed on from Wizard Ricker:Ward left in. Richard now knew what that meant.He lifted his left arm, fist out, toward the skrin perched on the stone wall atthe right. Ward left told him which arm to use and which skrin to ward. Thewrong arm would have denied him entry into this place in the world of the dead.One of Ricker’s traps for the enemy.His wristband heated. The leather pad protected his flesh from the power hefocused in that band. A green glow enveloped his fist. The skrin to the right,to which he directed his birthright of authority, glowed in sympathy with hisfist, immobilized for now, to allow Richard to enter.Richard glanced up at the guardian of raven-black granite to his left. Richardcalled out its name, a guttural sound to which it answered. Black stone crackedand crumbled as the skrin turned to its master, awaiting instruction. Richardmade the sound of its name again. He lifted his hand to Cara. “This one does notbelong here. Ward her back to the world of life. Do not harm her. After, returnto your post.” The skrin sprang from the stone wall, enveloping Cara. “LordRahl! When will you be home?” Richard gazed into her blue eyes. “I am home.”Light flared and silent thunder shook the soundless world as the skrin vanishedon its journey with Cara, back to the world of life.Richard turned to the winds. The four winds and the seer watched from theirplace up on the wall. Richard scanned the solid gold runes running up each sideof the wall beside the entrance to the hall, reading the messages and warningsplaced there by wizards past.In a world without wind, Richard’s cloak billowed out behind, a telltale in aplace with eddies of power and currents of force, as he strode onward, into theHall of the Betrayed.Kahlan threw up an arm before her face as lightning suddenly cracked before her.The road into the Temple of the Winds lit for an instant. In the distance,Kahlan could see Richard’s back as he strode resolutely into a passageway. Caratumbled lo the ground on the road at the edge of the cliff, at Kahlan’s feet.With the boom of thunder, the temple, and Richard, were gone. Cara rolled to herfeet. With wild fury, she seized Kahlan by the shoulders. “What have you done!”Kahlan hurt too much to speak. She stared at the ground, “Mother Confessor, whathave you done! I fixed it for you. What did you do to him?”Kahlan’s head came up. “You what?”“I swore an oath. We are sisters of the Agiel. I swore an oath to you that ifanything ever happened, if anything went wrong. I would see to it that it wasyou, and not Nadine, who was with Richard.” Kahlan’s mouth fell open. “Cara,what did you do?”“What you wanted! I spoke the words of the winds as they came to me. but when Itook you and Nadine to the buildings, I switched you both. I took Nadine toDrefan, and I took you to Lord Rahl.“I wanted you to be with the man you truly loved. I took you to Richard! Didn’tyou trust in me? Didn’t you have faith in me?”Kahlan fell into Cara’s arms. “Oh. Cara, I’m sorry”. I should have believed inyou. Dear spirits. I should have trusted you.”“Lord Rahl said he was going into the Hall of the Betrayed. I asked when hewould be coming home. He said he was home. He isn’t coming back! What have youdone!”“The Hall of the Betrayed...” Kahlan crumpled to the ground. “I have fulfilledthe prophecy. I have helped Richard get into the Temple of the Winds. I havehelped him stop the plague. “In so doing, I have destroyed him. “In so doing, Ihave destroyed myself.”“You have done more than that,” Cara whispered. “What do you mean?”Cara lifted her Agiel in her fist. “My Agiel. It has lost its power. The powerof a Mord-Sith works only in the presence of the bond to our Lord Rahl. Itexists to protect the Lord Rahl. Without a Lord Rahl, there is no bond. I havelost my power.”“I am Lord Rahl now,” Drefan said as he strode up behind Kahlan. Cara sneered athim. “You are no Lord Rahl. You do not have the gift.” Drefan met her glare.“I’m all the Lord Rahl you have. now. Someone has to hold the D’Haran empiretogether.”Kahlan clutched Richard’s black shirt to her stomach. “I am the MotherConfessor. I will hold the alliance together.”“You, my dear, have lost your power, too. You are no longer a Confessor, muchless the Mother Confessor.” He reached down and gripped Kahlan under her arm.His powerful fingers tightened painfully as he lifted her. “You are my wife,now, and you will do as I tell you to do. You have sworn an oath to obey me.”Cara reached out to force him to let go of Kahlan. Drefan backhanded her acrossthe mouth, knocking her to the ground.“And you, Cara, are a toothless snake now. If you wish to stick around, then youwill have to obey me. If not, I have no use for you. For now, only we know thatyour Agiel doesn’t work. Keep it that way. You will protect me as any LordRahl.”Cara gave him a venomous look as she wiped the blood from her mouth. “You arenot the Lord Rahl.”“No?” He lifted the Sword of Truth, Richards sword, and let it drop back intoits scabbard. “Well. I am the Seeker, now.”“You are not the Seeker, either.” Kahlan growled. “Richard is the Seeker.”“Richard? There is no Richard anymore. I am now Lord Rahl, and the Seeker.”Drefan pulled Kahlan against him, his Darken Rahl eyes burning into her. “Andyou are my wife. At least you will be, once we consummate the marriage. But thisis neither the time nor place. We have to get back. There is work to be done.”“Never. If you ever touch me, I’ll cut your throat.”“You have sworn an oath before the spirits. You will do as you have sworn.”Drefan smiled. “You’re a whore. You’ll enjoy it. I want you to enjoy it, to bepleased, I really do.”“How dare you call me that! I am no whore, especially yours!” His smile widened.“Really? Then how did you betray Richard? Why would he walk away without evenlooking back? My guess would be that you enjoyed it, when you thought it was me.I’d say Richard saw you for the whore you are. When it really is me, you willfind pleasure in it, then, too. I’ll like that.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 60Verna gently shoved Warren. “Wake up. Someone is coming.”Warren knuckled his eyes. “I’m awake.”Verna glanced back at the other windows, to make sure that the dead guards werestill propped up to make it appear they were on watch. A light from a lamp onthe table was just enough to show those outside the guards at the windows, butit would provide enough light to see her and Warren, too, so they stayed awayfrom the windows. “How do you feel?” she asked. “Better. I think I’m all right,now.”He had been unconscious earlier. The headaches caused by the gift were comingcloser and closer together. Verna didn’t know what to do for him. She didn’tknow how long it would be before his gift killed him. The only thing she couldthink to do was to stick to her plan. Warren had said that prophecy had told himthat his only chance was to be with her.Out the window, in the darkness, she could see two shadowed figures approachingup the road. In the distance, on the hills, campfires by the thousands made thecountryside look like a lake’s reflection of the starry sky.Verna shuddered to think of the hundreds of thousands of brutes in those tents.The sooner they left this place, the better. She was thankful they weren’t goingup into Jagang’s stronghold again. They wouldn’t be able to pull off that kindof magic twice. The spells Warren had used would not trick the guards again.Thankfully, once was enough. This time, her friends. Janet and Amelia, werecoming out to meet her and Warren. If that was, in fact, Janet and Amelia shesaw approaching.It had to be. This was the fourth night after the full moon. This was where theywere to meet. Janet had said that Amelia would be back from the tents by now.Verna feared to think of what kind of shape Amelia would be in. She wouldprobably need to be healed. Verna hoped that it wouldn’t take long: it was closeto dawn.She and Warren had taken turns at short naps. They had a lot of travelling todo, to get back to General Reibisch and his army, and they needed to be restedfor the journey. Verna wanted to be as far away from this place as she could getin case an alert rose from the stronghold.Verna hoped that Janet had already told Amelia about the bond to Richard so thatshe wouldn’t have to waste time with that, too. As soon as Amelia was sworn toRichard, the bond would protect her, too, from the dream walker. Then they couldescape.Verna dearly wanted to rescue the rest of the Sisters, but she knew thatpresumption was a road to ruin. On her twenty-year journey away from thecloistered life of the Palace of the Prophets, Verna had learned that out in theworld, a Sister had to do her work with care if there was to be any hope ofsuccess. Rescuing the rest of the Sisters would be worse than tricky, and itwould do them no good if Verna got herself caught while trying to rescue themall at once. Best be aware of your limitations and take it one step at a time.She would get the rest of the Sisters safely away from the dream walker, in duetime.Right now, it was most important to get her two friends out, get informationfrom them that would help her to rescue the rest, and get Warren some help.Without Warren, their cause would be jeopardized; Warren was a prophet, justbeginning to come into his talent-if that talent didn’t kill him before theycould get him the help he needed.One step at a time, she reminded herself. Use care, use your head, and you havethe best chance of success.A knock came at the door. Verna cracked it open and peeked out as Warren calledout like a guard for them to announce themselves. “Two of His Excellency’sslaves, Sister Janet and Sister Amelia.” Verna pulled open the door, reachedout, snatching the cloak of one, yanked her in, and then the other. Vernaflattened them both against the wall so they couldn’t be seen from the windows.“Thank the Creator,” Verna said with a sigh. “I thought you two would never gethere.”Both women stood with wide eyes, trembling like frightened rabbits. SisterAmelia’s face was bruised, cut, and swollen.Warren moved close to Verna. She took his hand as she looked from one white faceto the other. Her heart ached for Amelia’s obvious pain. But there was somethingmore in her eyes: terror. “What’s wrong?” she whispered. “You lied to us,” Janetsaid in a pained whisper. “What are you talking about?”“The bond. The bond to protect us from His Excellency. I told Amelia about it.She swore the oath to Richard, as you told it to me.”Verna frowned and leaned closer. “What in Creation are you saying? I told you,it will keep Jagang from entering your mind.”Janet slowly shook her head. “No, Verna, it won’t. Not from my mind, not fromAmelia’s... not from Warren’s... not from yours.”Verna laid a comforting hand on Janet’s arm, trying to calm the frightenedwoman. “Yes, it will. Janet. You must only believe, and you will be protected.”Janet slowly shook her head again. “Before I swore the oath to Richard, Jagangwas in my mind. He knew my thoughts. He knew what you told me. He knew it all.”Verna covered her mouth in horror. She hadn’t considered that possibility. “Butyou swore the oath. That protects you, now.”Again, Janet slowly shook her head. “It did, for the first day, but four daysago, on the night of the full moon. His Excellency returned to my mind. I didn’tknow it. I told Amelia about the oath. She swore, us had I. We thought we weresafe. We thought that when you came back, we would escape with you.”“You will,” Verna assured her. “We all will escape right now.”“None of us is going to escape, Verna. Jagang has you. He has Warren. He told usthat he slipped into the cracks of your minds while you slept, the first nightafter the full moon.” Tears filled Janet’s eyes. “I’m sorry. Verna. You shouldnever have come here to rescue me. It is to cost you both your freedom.”Verna smiled through her rising panic. “Janet, that just isn’t possible. Thebond protects us.”“It would.” Janet said in a suddenly gruff, suddenly sinister voice, “wereRichard Rahl still alive. But Richard Rahl departed the world of the living fournights ago. on the night of the full moon.”Janet laughed a hearty belly laugh, even as tears ran down her face. Vernacouldn’t draw a breath. “Richard . . -is... dead?” Warren slapped his hands tothe sides of his head as he let out a cry of anguish. “No! No!”Verna clutched at him as he sank toward the floor. “Warren! What is it?”“His Excellency... His Excellency has tasks for me.”“Tasks? Warren, what’s wrong? What’s happening?”“His Excellency has a new prophet!” Warren cried out. “Please, stop the pain! Iwill serve! I will serve as I am commanded!” Verna crouched over him. “Warren!”It felt as if a white-hot steel rod slammed through her skull. Verna cried outas she clamped her hands to her head. Nothing in her entire life of one hundredfifty-six years had prepared her for the fount of pain erupting in her mind. Theroom went black. She felt the floor smack her face. Her arms and legs twitchedwith the agony.Baleful laughter danced through the hot torture, like flames through a ruin.Verna prayed to the Creator that she would black out. Her prayer wentunanswered.Above her. she heard a voice. Janet’s voice.“I’m so sorry Verna. You should never have come here to try to rescue us. Youwill serve His Excellency, now, as his slaves.”The blond one. Cara. followed him into the reception room. She stayed threepaces behind, as he had ordered. She always wore her red leather, now, as he hadordered. He liked the way the red leather made them look like they were sheathedin blood. One of them was always there, with him, a bloodred reminder of theslick, sticky debauchery to come.Her blue eyes turned away when he glanced back over his shoulder. He knew thatshe stayed only to be near Kahlan. That was fine by him. That she stayed was allthat mattered. She was harmless, now, but it looked better if the Lord Rahl hadan escort of guards like her-a proper accoutrement of his rank.And he was the Lord Rahl, now, as the whispers from the ethers had promised him.Only he had the intellect to perceive the voices, the wisdom to hear them, theacumen to heed them. It had brought him triumph. Attention to detail had broughthim his rewards. His extraordinary insight had brought him to the place of powerhe had always deserved. His gift was his genius, and it would serve him betterthan mere magic.He was a man above others, and for good reason. He was superior to others- a manof rare understanding, instinct, and rare ethics, unadulterated by the twistedexcuses women put to their vulgar pleasures. His own virtue intoxicated him.Kahlan glanced up when she saw him striding into the room. Her face showed ablankness, an expression she wore almost constantly. She only thought it showednothing. To him, it revealed a panoply of emotion. Immersed in the details ofher bewitching face, he could discern the rich flux of emotions she tried tohide.He saw the way she looked at him. He had caught her glances at his body in thepast. He knew: she wanted him. She hungered for him. She wanted pleasure fromhim.That she tried to deny it only excited him all the more. That she covered herhunger for him with harsh words only proved it to him. That she pretendedrevulsion only showed him the extraordinary depths of her need.When she finally gave in to her lust, it would be all the more glorious for thewait, for the abstinence, for the yearning, for the delayed fulfillment. Then,at long last, he would give her what she wanted. Then he would hear her screams.The general with Kahlan bowed. “Good morning-Lord Rahl.”“What’s this?” he asked. He didn’t like it when the soldiers brought things toKahlan without seeing to informing the Lord Rahl first. “It’s just the morningreports, Drefan,” Kahlan said in that flat tone of hers. “Then why wasn’t Iinformed? Reports should come to the Lord Rahl first.” General Kerson stole aglance at Kahlan. He bowed again. “As you wish, Lord Rahl. I just thought-”“I do the thinking. You do the soldiering.” The general cleared his throat. “Ofcourse. Lord Rahl.”“So, what do the morning reports have to say?”The general glanced to Kahlan again. Drefan saw the slight nod. As if thegeneral needed permission from the Lord Rahl’s wife to report. Drefan let itpass, as he always did. He enjoyed her games, the way she thought he missedthings. It amused him.“Well, Lord Rahl. the plague is nearly over.”“Describe ‘nearly over,’ if you would, please. As a healer, vagueness hardlydoes me any good.”“In the last week, the deaths from the plague have dropped to only threeconfirmed cases lust night. Nearly everyone who was sick when Lord”-he caughthimself- “when Richard left has recovered. Whatever Richard did-”“My brother died, that’s what he did. I am the healer. I am the one responsiblefor the plague ending.”Kahlan lost the calm look. Her expression twisted to tightly controlled rage. Hewondered how her face would twist were it pain, were it terror. He would know,in the end.“Richard went to the Temple of the Winds. He sacrificed himself to saveeveryone. Richard! Not you, Drefan, Richard!”Drefan dismissed her tirade with a casual flip of his hand. “Nonsense. What didRichard know of healing? I am the healer. It is Lord Rahl who has saved hispeople from the plague.” Drefan raised a finger to the general. “And you hadbetter see to it that that everyone knows it.” Kahlan gave her slight nod to thegeneral again.“Yes, Lord Rahl,” the general said. “I will personally see to it that everyoneknows that it was Lord Rahl himself who stopped the plague.” Kahlan’s faceshowed the slightest hint of a smile at the general’s ambiguous response. Drefanlet it go. He had more important business than her disrespect for her husband.“And what else have you to report, general?”“Well. Lord Rahl, it seems that some of our units are... missing.”“Missing? How can troops be missing? I want them found. We must have the armytogether to defend against the Imperial Order. I won’t have the D’Haran empirefall to the Imperial Order because my officers fail to maintain discipline!”“Yes. Lord Rahl. I have already sent scouts to find the troops who have...wandered off from their stations.”“It’s the bond, Drefan,” Kahlan said. “The D’Harans aren’t bonded to you. Thearmy is breaking up, wandering off aimlessly because they have lost the bond,lost their leader. They don’t know what to do. They are without a Lord Rahl-”He struck her. The sharp sound reverberated through the room. “Stand up!” Hewaited until she regained her feet. “I’ll not have insolence from my wife! Doyou understand?”Kahlan pressed her fingers to her nose, trying to halt the flow of blood. Thecrimson tide flooded over her fingers and lips and down her chin. The sight ofit nearly drove a gasp from him. The sight of the Mother Confessor with blood onher made his hands shake. He longed for the slicing, for the sight of bloodeverywhere on her. for her screams, for her terror.But he could wait until she begged for it. As had Nadine. He had enjoyedNadine’s perverted hunger. He had relished her surprise, her terror, her agony,before he cast her over the side of the mountain, still alive, so she couldthink about her vile nature all the way down. It had sated him-for now.He could wait until the Mother Confessor’s true corruption finally surfaced onceagain, as it had the first night. Richard must have been horrified to discoverhow much she really wanted his brother, that the woman he had loved was asimpure as any whore. Poor, innocent, stupid Richard. He never even looked backover his shoulder as he walked away.Drefan could wait. She would need time to recover from the shock of causingRichard’s death. Drefan could wait. It wouldn’t take her long, as badly as shewanted him.He swept Kahlan up in his arms. “Forgive me. my wife. I didn’t mean to hurt you.Forgive me, please. I was only worried for our safety from the Order- distraughtthat these worthless soldiers won’t follow orders and in so doing endanger usall.”Kahlan wrenched herself out of his arms. “I understand.” She lied so poorly.From the corner of his eye, he could see the coiled form in red leather. If shemoved to strike, he would slice her down. If she didn’t, he still had use forher.Kahlan twitched a finger in caution to Cara. Cara reluctantly relaxed. Kahlanthought she was so clever, thought he didn’t see the way she gave orders topeople. For now, it didn’t matter.“General Kerson,” Drefan said, “I want those derelict troops found. We must havediscipline in the army, or we are lost to the Order. When they are found. I wantthe officers executed.”“What? You want me to execute my own men because they have lost the bond-”“I want you to execute them for treason. When the rest of the men learn that wewon’t tolerate such negligence to duty, they will think twice about joining withour enemy.”“Our enemy. Lord Rahl?”“Of course. If they don’t do their duty as D’Harans, to serve and protect theD’Haran empire, to say nothing of their Lord Rahl, then they are aiding theenemy. That makes them traitors! It endangers the life of my wife! Of everyone!”He glided his fingers over the raised gold letters on the hilt of the Sword ofTruth-his sword. He wielded it by right. “Now, do you have anything else toreport?”The general and Kahlan surreptitiously shared a look. “No, Lord Rahl.”“Good. That will be all, then. Dismissed.” He turned to Kahlan and held out hisarm. “Come, my dear. We will have breakfast together.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 61In a daze, Richard stepped down off the wizard’s throne at the head of the Hallof the Winds. His footsteps echoed into the distance. It was his rightful place,the wizard’s throne: he was the only war wizard, the only wizard with bothAdditive and Subtractive Magic.The inside of the Temple of the Winds was beyond colossal. It was almost beyondcomprehension. There was no sound in this soundless place, unless he put onethere, or willed it into being.The arched ceiling enclosing the lofty heights overhead could have containedeagles, and they hardly would have been aware that they were captive inside astructure. Mountain hawks, were there any, could soar and dive under that aerialarch, and feel at home.To the sides, massive columns supported walls that ascended into the remotecurve of the ribbed ceiling. In those side walls, enormous windows let in moreof the omnipresent diffused light.At least he could see the side walls. The far distant end of the hall simplyfaded out of sight, into a haze.Nearly everything was the color of a pale afternoon mist: the floors, thecolumns, the walls, the ceiling. They almost seemed made of the filmy light.Richard was a flea in a vast canyon. Even so, the place was not limitless, as itwas outside the walls.Before, he would have been stunned and awed by this place. Now, he was neither.He was simply numb.Here, time had no meaning, other than that which he brought with him. Time hadno place to anchor in eternity. He could have been here a century, rather than amere couple of weeks, and only he would note the difference, and then. only ifhe so chose. Life had little meaning here, a concept as distant as the other endof eternity; he brought that, too, to this place. Yet the Temple of the Windshad perception, and sheltered him in its wizard-crafted, stone embrace.To the sides, as he strode the hall, there were alcoves under each arch. beyondeach pair of columns. In each alcove resided the things of magic stored here forsafekeeping-sent here from the world of life, for the safekeeping of the worldof life.Richard understood them and could use them. He understood how dangerous thesethings were, and why some had wanted them locked away for all time. Theknowledge of the winds was his, now.With that knowledge, he had halted the plague. He didn’t have the book that wasused to start the plague, but it wasn’t necessary to have the book to render itimpotent. The book was stolen from this place, and so was still yoked to thewinds.It was a simple matter of switching the fluxes of power emanating from the windswhich enabled the magic of the book to function in the world of life.In fact, it was so simple that he was ashamed that he hadn’t realized the way todo it before. Thousands of people had died because he had been so ignorant. Hadhe known then what he knew now, he could have merely cast a web spun with bothsides of his power and the book would have been useless to Jagang. All thosepeople dead-and it had been so simple.At least he was able to use his healing powers to halt the sickness among mostwho were afflicted before he had interrupted the currents of magic. At least theplague was ended.It had only cost him everything. What price, for all those lives. What price thespirits had set. What price, indeed.It had cost Nadine her life. He felt profound sorrow for her. He would haveeliminated Jagang, and the threat from the Old World, too, but he couldn’t do sofrom this place. That was the world of life, and he could only affect thosethings taken from this place to the world of life, and the damage they caused.He had touched the core of power in this place, though; there would be no moreentry through Betrayer’s Hall. Jagang would not twice accomplish the same feat.Richard paused. He drew his sword, Drefan’s sword. He held it out in his palms,staring at it, watching the light catch it. This wasn’t his sword-the Sword ofTruth.He let his will flow from the core of his soul, carrying his birthright of powerwith it. His gift came as easily as a sigh, where before he had struggled tobring forth the most insignificant shred of his power. Force flowed outward,through his arms, and into the object he held.His mind guided its elements, balancing each to the desired sequence and result,until the sword in his hands transmuted into the twin of the one he knew sowell. He held the twin to the Sword of Truth, although without its attendantimpressions of those past souls who had used his real sword. In every other way,though, it was the same. It held the same power, the same magic.Wizards had died in the attempt to make the Sword of Truth, until some werefinally successful. Once they had succeeded, that knowledge was borne to thisplace, and it was therefore Richard’s for the taking, as was all the knowledgehere.He seized the hilt and held the blade aloft. Richard let the power, the magic,the rage of the sword inundate him, storm through him, just to feel something.Even wrath was something.He had no need of a sword, though. The wrath winked out, to be replaced again bythe emptiness.He tossed the sword high into the air and held it there, where it rotated slowlyon a bed of force. With a pulse of power, he shattered the sword he had madeinto a cloud of metal lie dust, and with another thought, evacuated the dust outof existence. He stood empty again. Empty and alone.A presence caused him to turn. It was another spirit. They came, from time totime, to see him, to speak with him, to urge him to return to his world beforeit was too late, before he lost the thread back to the world of life. This form,this spirit, rooted him to the floor in rigid shock. It looked like Kahlan.The soft, glowing apparition hovered before him, radiating with a glow the samecolor as everything else in this place, only with more intensity, moredefinition.It looked like Kahlan. For the first time in weeks, his heart pounded. “Kahlan?Have you died? Are you a spirit, now?”“No.” the spirit said, “I am Kahlan’? mother.”Richard’s muscles went slack again. He turned away and continued on through thehall. “What do you want?”The spirit followed, as they sometimes did, interested in him. a curiosity,perhaps, in their world.“I have brought you something,” the spirit said. Richard turned.“What?”She held out a rose. The green of the stem and the red of the petals werestunning in this colorless world, a ripple of pleasure to his eyes. Thefragrance filled his lungs with its pleasant aroma. He had almost forgotten thepleasure of such a thing. “What am I to do with this?”The spirit held it out, urging him to take it. He had no fear of the spirits whocame to see him. Even those who hated him could not harm him. He knew how toprotect himself.Richard took the rose. “Thank you.” He slid the stem behind his belt. He turnedand continued on. The spirit of Kahlan’s mother followed. He didn’t like lookinginto her face. Though she was a spirit, and her features were indistinct in thatglow they had, she still looked too much like Kahlan. “Richard, may I talk withyou?”His footsteps echoed through the vast hall. “If you wish.”“I wish to tell you about my daughter. Kahlan.” Richard stopped and turned backto the spirit. “Why?”“Because she is part of me. She was of my flesh, just as you are of yourmother’s flesh. Kahlan is my connection to the world of life, the place I oncewas. Where you must return.”Richard started out once more. “I am home. I have no intention of returning tothat bitter world. If you wish me to carry a message to your daughter. I’msorry, I can’t. Leave me.”He lifted his hand to banish her from the hall, but she raised her hands,pleading for him to stay his power.“I do not wish you to carry a message. Kahlan knows I love her. I wish to talkto you.”“Why?”“Because of what I did to Kahlan.”“Did to her? What did you do to her?”“I instilled in her a sense of duty. ‘Confessors don’t have love, Kahlan. Theyhave duty.’ That was what I told her. To my shame, I never explained what Imeant by that. I fear I left her no room for life.“More than any Confessor I knew, Kahlan wanted to live life. to relish it. Dutydenied her much of that. That is what makes her such a good protector of herpeople. She wants them to have a chance at their joy, because she sees soclearly what she was denied. She is left to take small pleasures as she can.”“Is there a point to this?”“Don’t you enjoy life, Richard?”Richard walked on. “I understand about duty. I have been born to duty. I am nowdone with it. I am done with everything.”“You, too, misunderstand what I meant about duty. To the right person, theperson who is truly born to it, duty is a form of love, through which all ispossible. Duty is not always a denial of things, but an expansion of them toothers. Duty is not always a chore, but is best carried out with love. “Will younot return to her, Richard? She needs you.”“Kahlan has a husband, now. I have no place in her life.”“You have a place in her heart.”“Kahlan said she would never forgive me.”“Richard, have you never said something you didn’t mean, in desperation? Haveyou never wished you could take back the words?”“I can’t return to her. She is married to another. She has given an oath, andshe has... I won’t go back.”“Even if she is married to another, even if you cannot be with her, even if itbreaks your heart to know you can’t have her, don’t you love her enough to mendher heart? To put her heart at peace? Is it all you, and none of it her, in thislove you have?”Richard glared at the spirit. “She has found happiness in my absence. Shedoesn’t need anything from me.”“Do you find enjoyment in the rose, Richard?” Richard walked on. “Yes, it’s verynice, thank you.”“Will you consider going back, then?”Richard wheeled to the spirit of Kahlan’s mother. “Thank you for the rose. Hereare a thousand in repayment, so you may not say I owe you anything in return!”Richard cast out his hand and the air filled with roses. Rose petals flew andswirled in a red blizzard.“I’m sorry I could not make you understand, Richard. I can see that I only bringyou pain. I will leave you.”When she vanished, the floor was bespattered with red petals, looking likenothing so much as a pool of blood.Richard sank to the floor, feeling too sick to stand. Soon, he would be one ofthem, a spirit, and he would not have to endure this limbo where he twistedbetween worlds. He had food, when he wanted it, he had sleep, when he wanted it,but he couldn’t maintain life here indefinitely. This was not the world of life.Soon enough, he would be one of them, and finished with this emptiness that washis life.Kahlan had once filled that emptiness. She had once been everything to him. Hehad trusted her. He had thought his heart had been safe in her care. He hadimagined more than was true. How could he have been such a fool? Was it all suchillusion?Richard’s head came up. He peered across the hall. He went through a mental,inventory of the items stored here. The gazing font. It was there, across thehall. He knew how to use it.He rose and crossed the hall, going between two of the columns, to find thestone gazing font. It had two basins, in two tiers, the lower one waist-high,and the upper just above his head. Each basin was a long rectangle. Carved intothe glittering charcoal-grey stone were ornate symbols of instruction and power.The lower basin was brimful of a silver liquid, appearing similar to the sliph,but very different, he knew.Richard lifted the silver ewer from the shelf below and dipped it in the lowerbasin. He emptied the ewer into the upper basin. He continued, until the upperbasin was loaded with its charge of the gazing liquid.Richard leaned across the lower basin to place his hands on the proper symbols,spread wide to each side. He read the ancient words before him as he leaned in,hands pressed to the gazing keyways. When the words were said. he focused hismind on the person he wished to gaze upon. As he did this, he let slip a smallcord of power to release the liquid in the upper font.Across the entire knife-edge front of the upper basin, the silver liquid spilledout in a thin. silvery sheet before his face. In that waterfall of gazingliquid, Richard saw the person he called in his mind: Kahlan.His chest tightened at seeing her. He almost gasped, almost called out her namein anguish.She was in her white Confessor’s dress. The familiar contours of her face madehim ache with longing. She was near her rooms, her bedroom, in the Confessors”Palace. It was night, there. Richard could feel his heart hammering against hisribs as he watched her glide to a halt at the door.Drefan slipped up behind her. He put his hands on her shoulders, giving them asqueeze as he leaned close, putting his mouth by her ear.“Kahlan, my wife, my love. Are you ready to go into bed? I’ve had a hard day. Iso look forward to a night of your lustful passion.”Richard released the font. He lifted his fists as he staggered back. The gazingfont exploded apart, heavy pieces of rock driven ahead of huge gouts of flameand smoke. Shards of stone whistled through the hall, disappearing into thedistance. Massive chunks of stone wailed as they rose up into the air, lifted ona raging inferno, until they lost their upward momentum and dropped back down,to shatter into fragments and dust. The gazing liquid flooded the floor. In eachdroplet and pool, Richard could see Kahlan’s face. He turned his back andstalked away. A furnace of flame blasted the floor, evaporating each droplet,yet he could still perceive her face in the tiniest mist of it filling the air.He cast up his fists. Every droplet, every infinitesimal bit of mist, winkedinto nothingness behind him.In the center of the hall, in a daze, Richard slumped to the floor, staring outat nothing.A malicious chuckle drifted through the winds. Richard knew who it was. Hisfather was back to torment him again.“What’s the matter, my son?” Darken Rahl said in his derisive hiss. “Aren’t youhappy with my choice of a husband for your true love? My own son, my own fleshand blood, Drefan, wed to the Mother Confessor. I think it a good choice myself.He’s a good boy. She seemed pleased. But then, you already know that, don’t you?You should be pleased that she is pleased. So very pleased.” Darken Rahl’slaughter cavorted through the hall.Richard didn’t bother to banish the luminous form standing over him. What did itmatter?“So, what do you say, my wife? Shall we have a night of wild passion? Like youshowed my brother when you thought it me?”Kahlan used all her strength to ram her elbow into Drefan’s sternum. She hadcaught him off guard. He hadn’t expected that. He doubled over in pain, unableto get his breath. “I told you, Drefan, if you touch me, I’ll cut your throat.”Before he could recover to laugh at her anger, or to taunt her with his threatsof force, she slipped into her room, slammed the door, and threw the bolt.She stood trembling in the near darkness. She had felt something. For a moment,it had felt as if Richard was there with her. She had almost called out hisname- screamed she loved him.She clutched her abdomen in agony. When would she ever stop thinking about him?Richard was never coming back.Kahlan crossed the thick carpets in her sitting room and went back into thebedroom. She dropped into a defensive crouch when someone stepped out in frontof her.“Sorry,” Berdine whispered. “I didn’t mean to frighten you.” Kahlan sighed asshe unclenched her fists and rose to her feet. “Berdine.” She threw her armsaround the woman. “Oh, Berdine, I’m glad to see you. How are you doing?”Berdine hugged Kahlan with a desperate need for comfort. “It’s been a few weeks,but it seems as if Raina died only yesterday. I’m so angry with her for leavingme. And then when I get angry at her, I cry because I miss her so. If she wouldonly have held on for a few more days, she would be alive now. Just a couple ofdays.”“I know, I know,” Kahlan whispered. She parted from Berdine, keeping her voicelow. “What are you doing here? I thought you went up to the Keep to relieveCara.”“I did, but I had to come down to talk to you.”“You mean the sliph is unguarded?” Berdine nodded. “Berdine, we can’t leave heralone. We would never know if someone slipped into Aydindril-someone withdangerous magic. That was what-”Berdine shushed her. “I know. This is important, too. Besides, what differencedoes it really make? Cara and I have lost our power. We couldn’t stop someonewith magic, now, if they did come through the sliph.“I have to talk to you, Mother Confessor, and I can never do it in the daybecause Drefan is always showing up.”“Don’t let him catch you calling him anything other than Lord Rahl, or he-”“He isn’t Lord Rahl. He isn’t. Mother Confessor.”“I know. But he’s all the Lord Rahl we have.”Berdine looked Kahlan in the eye. “Cara and I have been talking. We decided weshould kill him. We need you to help us.”“We can’t do that.” Kahlan gripped Berdine’s shoulder. “We can’t.”, “Sure wecan. We’ll hide out on the balcony, you get him out of his clothes so that he’saway from those knives of his, and while you... distract his attention, we’llburst in and end it.”“Berdine, we can’t.”“Well, all right, if you’re skittish about that plan, we can easily think ofanother. The point is, we have to kill him.”“No, the point is, we can’t kill him.”Berdine scowled. “Do you want to be married to that pig? Sooner or later, he’sgoing to insist on his rights as your husband.”“Berdine, listen to me. Even if he does that, I will have to endure it. I canendure rape if it means saving lives. We can’t kill Drefan. He’s the only LordRahl we have. Until we can figure out what to do, he is the only thing holdingthe army together.“Right now. they’re confused by his aggressive command. D’Harans are used tobeing told what to do by Lord Rahl. Drefan is acting as if he is the Lord Rahland, for the moment, the army is scratching their heads, wondering if they’resure he isn’t.”“But he isn’t,” Berdine insisted.“But at the moment, that’s all that is holding the whole thing together. If itfalls apart, then the Imperial Order will be able to roll right over theMidlands. Drefan is right about that much of it.”“But you are the Mother Confessor. General Kerson is loyal to you. Even withoutthe bond. he sticks around because of you. Most of the officers do the same.Because of you, not Drefan. You could hold things together as well as Drefan.Maybe it would work.”“And maybe not. I may not like Drefan, but he has done nothing to earnassassination. As much as I don’t like his ways, he’s doing his best to keep usall together. With him, and me, we may be able to keep everyone together inthis.” Berdine tilled her head closer. “It won’t last, and you know it.” Kahlanwiped a hand across her face. “Berdine, Drefan is my husband. I have sworn anoath to him.”“An oath, is it? Then why haven’t you let him in your bed?” Kahlan opened hermouth, but couldn’t find the words.“It’s because of Lord Rahl, isn’t it? You still think he’s coming back, don’tyou? You want him to come back.”Kahlan put her fingertips to her lips. She turned away. “If Richard was going tocome back. he’d have done so by now.”“Maybe it’s the plague, maybe he isn’t finished ridding the magic of the plague.Maybe when he’s finished, he will return.” Kahlan hugged her arms to herself.She knew that wasn’t it. “Mother Confessor, you do want him to return, don’tyou?”“I’m married to Drefan. I have a husband.”“That isn’t what I asked you. You do want him to return. You must want him tocome back.”Kahlan shook her head. “He said he would always love me. He said his heart wouldalways be mine. He promised.” Kahlan swallowed the anguish. “He walked away. Imay have-hurt him, but if he really loved me, he wouldn’t do this to me. He’dhave given me a chance...”“But you still want him back.”“No. I don’t want ever to go through this kind of pain again. I don’t want everto leave myself open to this much hurt. I was wrong ever to let myself fall inlove with him in the first place.” Kahlan shook her head again. “I don’t wanthim to come back.”“I don’t believe you. You’re just upset, as I get because Raina died. But if shecame back. I’d forgive her for dying and take her back in a heartbeat.”“Not Richard. I’ll not trust my heart to him again. Regardless of what I did,that doesn’t make it right for him to hurt me as he did. He just walked awayfrom me, and after he’d made promises of always loving me no matter what. Hefailed me in that test.“I never thought he would hurt me like that. I thought my heart was safe withhim, no matter what, but it wasn’t.” Berdine turned her around and gripped hershoulders.“Mother Confessor, you don’t mean that. You don’t. Trust works both ways. If youreally loved him, then you must trust in him, no matter what, just as youexpected him to always trust in you.”Tears trickled down Kahlan’s cheeks. “I can’t, Berdine. It hurts too much. I’llnot put myself through it again.“It doesn’t matter anyway. It’s been weeks. The plague is long over. Richard isnever coming back.”“Look, I don’t know exactly what happened up on the mountain, but you just askyourself this: If the situation were reversed, if you were in his place, howwould you feel?”“Don’t you think I do that every moment of every day? I know how I’d feel. I’dfeel betrayed. I’d never forgive me, if I were him. I’d hate me, just as I knowhe does.”“No,” Berdine soothed, “that isn’t true. He doesn’t hate you. Lord Rahl may beconfused, or hurt, but he could never hate you.”“He does. He hates me for what I did. That’s the other reason I can never takehim back- I hurt him too much. How could I ever look him in the eye again? Icouldn’t. I could never ask him to trust me again.”Berdine circled an arm around Kahlan’s neck and drew her to a shoulder. “Don’tclose your heart, Kahlan. Please don’t do that. You are a sister of the Agiel.As your sister, I beg you not to do that.”“It makes no difference,” Kahlan whispered. “I can’t be with him anyway, nomatter what I might think or wish or hope. I must forget him. The spirits haveforced me into marrying Drefan. I have given my oath to Drefan and to thespirits in trade to save lives. I must respect the oath I’ve given. Richard,too, must respect my oath.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 62Wake him! the voice in her head commanded.Verna cried out. It felt as though she was covered with wasps, and they were allstinging her at once. She frantically swiped at her arms, her shoulders, herlegs, her face. She screamed in panic, swatting, swatting. Wake him! came thevoice in her head again. His Excellency’s voice.Verna snatched the cloth from the bucket. She turned Warren’s head. He wassprawled forward on the table, unconscious. She dabbed the wet cloth on hischeeks, his forehead. With trembling fingers, she smoothed back his hair. Hehadn’t been out long, so she had a better chance to bring him around. “Warren.Warren, please wake up. Warren!”He moaned in delirium. She pressed the wet cloth to his lips. She rubbed hisback with her other hand as she kissed his cheek. It broke her heart to see himso afflicted with the pain, not only of the dream walker but of the gift out ofcontrol. She pressed her fingers to the back of his neck and let a warm flow ofHan seep into him, hoping it would give him strength, hoping it would bring himaround.“Warren,” she cried, “please wake up. Please, for me, wake up, or His Excellencywill be angry. Please, Warren.”Tears streamed down her face. She didn’t care. She needed only to wake Warren,or His Excellency would make them both suffer. She had never known thatresistance could be so futile. She had never known that she could so easily bemade to betray everything in which she believed.She couldn’t even protect those she loved by killing herself. She had tried. Oh,how she had tried. He wouldn’t allow it; he wanted them alive so that they couldserve him. He wished to use their talents.She now knew that it had to be true: Richard had to be dead. The bond to him wasbroken, and they were defenseless against the dream walker. He intruded into hermind at will. With frightening ease, Jagang bent her to his wishes. It was as ifshe were no longer in control of the simplest of actions. If Jagang willed it,her arm lifted, and she could do nothing but watch. He controlled her use of herHan, too. Without the bond, she was powerless.Warren let out another groggy groan. He moved of his own accord, at last. OnlyVerna seemed able to wake him when he passed out from the gift. That was theonly reason Jagang hadn’t sent her to the tents.Only his heart’s connection to her was enough to stir Warren. She knew that itwas harmful to wake him when the gift wanted him unconscious-it did that as away to stretch his endurance until he could get proper help-but she had nochoice. She was using their love to wake him, and in so doing, was bringing himcloser to death; but Jagang didn’t care, as long as Warren did as ordered.“Sorry,” Warren mumbled. “I... I couldn’t...”“I know,” Verna comforted, “I know. Wake up, now. Warren. His Excellency wantsus to keep working. We have to keep working.”“I... can’t. I can’t, Verna. My head-”“Please, Warren.” Verna couldn’t control the tears. The pain of a thousand waspsstinging her everywhere at once made it impossible to hold still. She flinchedconstantly. “Warren, you know what he’ll do to us. Please, Warren, you must goback to the books. I’ll carry them down. Just tell me which ones you need. I’llget them for you.”He nodded as he pushed himself up. He was becoming more alert. Verna slid thelamp near him and turned up the wick. She pushed close the volume he had beenreading when he had passed out, and tapped the page.“Here, Warren. Here. This is where you were. His Excellency wants to know whatthis means.”Warren pressed his fists to the sides of his head. “I don’t know! Please,Excellency, I don’t know. I can’t make the visions of prophecy come at will. I’mnot a prophet yet. I am only beginning.” Warren cried out, squirming in hischair. “I’ll try! I’ll try! Please, let me try!”Warren panted as his agony subsided. He bent over the book, licking his lips.Fingers shook as he set them to the book, following along the line of words, theline of prophecy.“‘Patronizing past,’“ he muttered as he read to himself. “ ‘Patronizing pastcarries forward the same disfavor twisted to new use, for a new master....’ DearCreator, I don’t know what it means. Please, let the vision come.”Clarissa peered out into the darkness as the coach rocked to a stop. Dust hungin the air, their ghostlike escort. A stone fortress rose up just outside thecoach’s window. It was dark, and she couldn’t see the whole thing, but what shecould see made her heart pound out of control.She waited, twisting her fingers together, until the soldier opened the door.“Clarissa,” he whispered. “This is the place.”Clarissa took his hand as she stepped out into the inky night. “Thank you,Walsh.”The other one of Nathan’s soldier friends, a man named Bollesdun, waited up inthe driver’s seat, keeping tight the reins.“Hurry, now,” Walsh told her. “Nathan said he doesn’t want you in there for morethan a few minutes. If anything happens, the two of us aren’t going to be ableto fight much of a battle to get you out.”She knew the truth of that. They had ridden past so many tents that it left herstunned by their numbers. The hoard who had overrun Renwold had been nothingcompared to the numbers of men here.Clarissa pulled up the hood on her cloak. “Don’t you worry, I know better thanto dally. Nathan told me what to do.”She clutched her cloak together in her fist. She had promised Nathan. He haddone so much for her. He had saved her life. She would do this for him. Shewould do this so others wouldn’t die.As terrified as she was, she would do anything for Nathan. There was no betterman in the whole world. No kinder man. no more compassionate, no braver.Walsh walked beside her as they passed under an iron portcullis, and then intoan entryway under a barrelled roof. Two brutish guards, wearing hide mantles andhung with grisly-looking weapons, stood beside a hissing torch.Clarissa kept her cloak tightly drawn and her hood pulled forward. She hung herhead so that the guards couldn’t see her face in the shadow. She let Walsh dothe talking, as she had been instructed.Walsh flicked his hand toward her. “The representative of His Excellency’splenipotentiary. Lord Rahl,” he said in a gruff voice, as if unhappy that thisassignment had fallen to him.The bearded guard grunted. “So I’ve been told.” He lifted a thumb toward thedoor. “Go on in. Someone is supposed to be waiting for you.”Walsh adjusted his weapons belt. “Good. I have to drive this one back tonight.Can you believe it? Won’t even let us wait until morning. That Lord Rahl is asdemanding as they come.”The guard grunted, as if he well understood the annoyance of night duty. “Oh.”Walsh added, as if in afterthought, “Lord Rahl also wanted to know if hisrepresentative could pay the Lord Rahl’s respects to His Excellency.”The guard shrugged. “Sorry. Jagang took out of here this morning. He took mosteveryone with him. Just left a few behind to mind things.”Clarissa’s heart sank with disappointment. Nathan had been hoping that Jagangwould be here, but he had said that even though he hoped it, Jagang would likelybe smarter than that. Jagang wasn’t one to trust his life to the unknownabilities of a wizard as powerful as Nathan.Walsh took Clarissa’s arm and pushed her on ahead as he gave the guard agood-natured slap on the shoulder. “Thanks.”“Yea, just go on in down the hall. There’s one of the women waiting there foryou. Last I saw her, she was pacing by the second set of torches.”Walsh and Bollesdun were Imperial Order soldiers, and they had had no troublewith any of the other soldiers, either. Clarissa dreaded to think what wouldhave happened to her without those two the times their coach had been stopped bytroops to query its mission. Walsh and Bollesdun also had little troubleushering her through checkpoints.Clarissa remembered all too well what happened to the women in Renwold. Shestill had nightmares about what she had seen happening to Manda Perlin when theOrder’s troops captured Renwold. And right there, on the floor beside hermurdered husband. Rupert.Their footsteps echoed as they hurried down the stone corridor. It was a dark,dank, and depressing place. It looked to Clarissa to have no comforts other thana few wooden benches. This was a place for soldiers, not a place for families tolive. As the guard had said, the woman was waiting near the second set oftorches. “Yes,” the woman asked, “what is it?”As Clarissa came to a stop before the woman, she could see in the torchlightthat her face was badly battered. She had horrid-looking cuts and bruises. Oneside of her lower lip was swollen to twice normal size. Even Walsh moved back alittle when he got a good look at her. “I am to meet Sister Amelia. HisExcellency’s plenipotentiary sent me.”The woman slumped with relief. “Good. I am Sister Amelia. I have the book. Ihope never to see it again.”“His Excellency’s plenipotentiary also told me that I am to pay his respects toan acquaintance of his, Sister Verna. Is she here?”“Well, I don’t know if I should-”“If I’m not allowed to see her. His Excellency will be most unhappy when hisplenipotentiary reports how his request was so rudely treated by a slave. As aslave myself, serving His Excellency, I can tell you that I will not be the oneto take the blame.”Clarissa felt foolish saying such words, but as Nathan had told her, they seemedto work magic.Sister Amelia’s eyes fixed on the gold ring through Clarissa’s lip. Herhesitation vanished. “Of course. Please follow me. That is where the book iskept, anyway.”With Walsh close at her side, and his hand near the hilt of his short sword,Clarissa followed Sister Amelia deeper into the gloomy fortress. They went downa long hall, and then took a turn. Clarissa was paying careful attention as theywent, so that if they had to get out fast, she wouldn’t take a wrong route andbe caught in here.Sister Amelia stopped before a door, glancing to Clarissa for just an instantbefore she lifted the lever and led them in. A woman and a man were in the room,he sitting at a simple plank table, reading a book laid open on the table, andshe looking over his shoulder.The woman glanced up. She was a little older than Clarissa, and attractive, withcurly brown hair. She looked to Clarissa to be a woman of authority crushed byhumiliation. She looked in agony. Whether it was physical, or emotional,Clarissa didn’t know.Sister Amelia held out a hand. “This is Verna.”Verna straightened. She had a gold ring in her lip, the same as Sister Amelia,the same as Clarissa. The man, his curly blond hair in disarray, didn’t look up.He seemed frantically absorbed in his book. “Pleased to meet you,” Clarissasaid. Verna turned back to the man and the book he was studying. Clarissa pushedback her hood as she turned to Sister Amelia. “The book?” Sister Amelia bowed.“Of course. It’s right here.”She scurried to a shelf. The room wasn’t large. One of the stone block walls hada crudely built shelf holding books. There were perhaps no more than a hundred.Nathan had been hoping there would be a great many more. As Nathan had expected,though, Jagang wouldn’t keep many of his prizes together in one place.Sister Amelia pulled a volume from a shelf and placed it on the table. Shelooked to be uncomfortable even touching it. “This is it.”The cover was as Nathan had described it to her, a strange black that seemed toabsorb the light from the room. Clarissa flipped open the cover. “What are youdoing?” Sister Amelia cried out as she stepped closer. Clarissa looked up. “Iwas instructed how to make sure it is the right book. Please leave it to me.”Sister Amelia stepped back, wringing her hands together. “Of course. But I cantell you only too well that it’s the right book. It’s the one His Excellencyagreed to.”Clarissa carefully turned over the first page as Sister Amelia nervously lickedher lips. Verna watched from the corner of her eye.Clarissa reached inside her cloak and pulled out the little leather pouch ofpowder Nathan had given her. She sprinkled it over the open page. Words began toappear.Assigned to the Winds by Wizard Picker.It was the book she had come for. Nathan hadn’t known the name of the wizard,but he had told her it would say “Assigned to the Winds” and then a name. Sheflipped the cover closed.“Sister Amelia, would you leave us for a moment, please?” The woman bowed andquickly scurried out of the room. Verna frowned as she straightened again.“What’s this about?”“May I see your ring, please?”“My ring?”Verna finally sighed and held out her hand, showing Clarissa the ring on herthird finger. It had the sunburst pattern as Nathan had described.“Why do you want to see-” For the first time, Verna noticed Clarissa’s guard.Her eyes went wide. She jostled Warren’s shoulder while she spoke. “Walsh?”Warren’s head came up.Walsh smiled. “How you doing, Prelate? Warren?”“Not very well.”Clarissa stepped closer. The man, Warren, was looking very puzzled. “I was sentby Lord Rahl to get this book.” Clarissa gave Verna and Warren both a meaningfullook. “I am bonded to Lord Rahl.”“Richard is dead,” Verna said in a flat whisper.“I know. But I was sent by Lord Rahl. Nathan Rahl, the master of D’Hara. Hewanted me to pass along his regards.”Verna’s mouth fell open. Warren’s chair skidded across the floor as he rushed tohis feet.“Do you understand?” Clarissa carefully asked. “If you do, then you had betterbe quick about it.”“But, Nathan, we couldn’t...”“Well,” Clarissa said, “I must be getting back to Lord Rahl. He’s waiting forme. I have a coach, and I must be leaving at once.” Verna’s eyes turned up toWalsh. He gave her a nod.Verna fell to her knees. She snatched Warren’s violet robes and yanked him downbeside her.“Do it. Warren!” She folded her hands together as she bowed her head. Her wordsspilled out. “Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protectus. In your light we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom weare humbled. We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.” Warren spoke thewords, too, just a little in her wake.Verna knelt frozen for a moment, her hands still folded together prayerfully.She suddenly let out a cry of joy. She laughed like a madwoman.“Thank the Creator! My prayers have been answered! I’m free! He’s gone! I canfeel that he’s gone from my mind!”Clarissa sighed in relief. Nathan had warned her that if Verna failed to do asthey had hoped, she would have to die here.Verna and Warren hugged as they wept with joy. Clarissa seized them both andurged them up.“We have to get out of here, but Lord Rahl wants me to do something else, first.I need to look for some books.”“Books?” Warren asked. “What books?”“Mountain’s Twin, Selleron’s Seventh Task, The Book of Inversion and Duplex, andTwelve Words Left for Reason. “Warren turned to the book on the table. “Twelve Words, that’s this one, here. Ithink I saw a couple of the others.”Clarissa went to the shelves. “Help me look. Nathan wants to know if they arehere. He needs to know.”They all scanned the titles on the spines, and had to pull out several thatweren’t marked so as to check their titles. They found all but The Book ofInversion and Duplex.Clarissa brushed the dust from her hands. “That will have to do. Nathan saidthat they might not all be here. With only one missing, that’s better than wecould have hoped.”“What does Nathan want with these books?” Warren asked. “He doesn’t want Jagangto have them. He says that they’re dangerous for Jagang to have.”“They all could be dangerous,” Verna said.“Let me worry about that,” Clarissa said, as she slipped the book from the tableback into an empty slot. “Nathan just needed to know which were here. Now, wecan leave.”Verna clutched Clarissa’s sleeve. “I have two friends here. We have to get themout with us. You said you have a coach. We can all go.”“Who?” Walsh asked. “Janet and Amelia.”Walsh let out a knowing grunt as Clarissa glanced to the door. “But Nathansaid-”“Look, if they give their oath to... to Lord Rahl, also, they can escape.” Vernatouched the ring in Clarissa’s lip. “You don’t know what they do to the womenhere. Did you see Amelia’s face?”“I know what they do,” Clarissa whispered, remembering the scenes in Renwold.“Will they take the oath?”“Of course. Wouldn’t you, if it would get you away from here?” Clarissaswallowed. “I’d do anything.”“Hurry, then,” Walsh said. “There’s room in the coach, but we have to hurry.”Verna nodded and then slipped out the door.While Verna went to get the other two, Clarissa unhooked the clasp on the finegold chain around her neck. Warren watched with a frown as Clarissa pulled abook from a lower shelf and then set it on the table.Clarissa placed the locket on the shelf, in the empty slot. Carefully, she laidopen the locket. With a finger, she gently pushed it all the way back againstthe wall. She wiggled her fingers at Warren. He handed back the book she hadremoved. Clarissa slid it back into its place. “What did you do?” Warren asked.“What Nathan wanted me to do.” Verna burst back into the room, holding the handsof two beaming women. One was the one with the battered face, Sister Amelia.“They’ve given the oath,” Verna said in a breathless voice. “They are bonded toLord Rahl. Let’s get out of here.”“About time,” Walsh said. He had a little smile on his face for Verna. It wasobvious to Clarissa that they knew each other.Walsh took a hold of Clarissa’s arm and the two of them led out the rest, toretrace their route back through the fortress. The dark, dripping stone smelledof rot. They saw only a few guards inside the stronghold, most people havingleft along with Jagang, gone to his huge tents.Nathan said that Jagang travelled with a large contingent of people and that hehad big, round tents with all the comforts of a palace. Of the people leftbehind, there seemed to be a scattering of officers and guards, and a few of thewomen who were slaves to Jagang and his army.As they came around a corner, one of those slaves was coming the other way,carrying two steaming kettles of what smelled like lamb stew. She was dressedthe same as the other women Clarissa had seen, except Verna. The clothes theywore, like Janet and Amelia, were not clothes as far as Clarissa was concerned.The women might as well have been naked, for all the good those transparentgarments did.When the woman looked up and saw them coming, especially Walsh, she immediatelystepped to the side of the hall, out of their way.Clarissa jerked to a halt, staring at the woman, whose gaze fixed on the floor.“Manda?” Clarissa whispered. “Manda Perlin, is that you?” Manda looked up. “Yes,mistress?”“Manda. it’s me, Clarissa. From Renwold. I’m Clarissa.” The young woman lookedup the length of Clarissa, at her expensive gown, at her jewellery, at her hairall done in ringlets. Manda’s gaze met Clarissa’s, and her eyes widened.“Clarissa, is it really you?”“Yes.”“I don’t hardly... recognize you. You look so... different. You look so...” Thespark went out of her expression. “Were you captured back home, too, then? I seethe ring.”“No. I wasn’t captured.”Manda’s eyes filled with tears. “Oh, good. I’m so glad they didn’t get you,there. It was-”Clarissa hugged the young woman. Manda had never spoken this many words to herin all the years Clarissa had known her, and the words she had spoken hadn’tbeen decent. Clarissa had always hated Manda for the cruel words, the cruelsmirks, the condescending glances. Now, Clarissa felt sorrow for her. “Manda, wehave to go. Would you like to come away with us?” Verna snatched Clarissa’s arm.“We can’t do that.”Clarissa glared at Verna. “I came here to rescue you. I let you take yourfriends with us. I want to take my friend out of here, too.” Verna sighed andlet go of Clarissa’s arm. “Of course.”“Friend?” Manda whined as her face twisted with untold sorrow. “Yes,” Clarissasaid. “I could get you out of here, too.”“You would do that for me? After all the times I...” Sobbing, Manda threw herarms around Clarissa. “Oh, yes. Oh, Clarissa, please! Oh, Clarissa, please letme go with you!”Clarissa gripped the woman’s wrists and pushed her away. “Then listen carefully.I give you only one chance. My master has magic to protect your mind from thedream walker. You must swear an oath to him. You must be loyal to him.” Mandafell to her knees, clutching at Clarissa’s dress. “Yes, I swear.”“Then say these words, and you must mean them with all your heart.” Clarissaspoke the devotion, pausing to let Manda repeat the words. When she finished,Verna and Clarissa helped the sobbing woman to her feet.Clarissa had always been so intimidated by Manda, always so afraid of her scorn.How many times had Clarissa crossed the street, her head bowed low, as she triedto avoid Manda’s attention?“Hurry, now,” Walsh said. “Nathan told us to get out of here fast.” At theentrance, Walsh had to make up a story about His Excellency’s plenipotentiarywanting some women. The guard eyed the nearly naked women, smiled knowingly, andslapped Walsh on the back.They all piled into the coach as Walsh climbed up into the driver’s seat withBollesdun. As the coach lurched and then started out, Clarissa pushed Janet andManda to the floor, in the center, so she could lift the leather-covered seat.She pulled out a long cloak. She only had one extra; they had expected to rescueVerna and Warren. Since Verna had a cloak, Clarissa gave the extra cloak toManda, and retrieved blankets for Janet and Amelia. All three women wereimmensely grateful to be able to cover themselves, at last.Clarissa sat at the end of the seat, holding the strange black book Nathan hadsent her for, with Amelia at the other end, and Manda in the center, clutchingat Clarissa for comfort.Manda kept weeping on Clarissa’s shoulder, and thanking her profusely. Clarissaput an arm around Manda and told her that she had expressed her gratitude enoughtimes. It did feel good, though, to have the beautiful Manda Perlin looking upto Clarissa for a change, rather than looking down on her. All because ofNathan. How he had changed her life-changed everything.They had to stop three times, while soldiers checked the coach. Once, thesoldiers made them all get out and line up for a look. The blankets and cloakhad to remain in the coach as Janet, Amelia, and Manda climbed out forinspection.Walsh explained, in very crude terms, what he was doing with these slaves- howhe was taking them for the pleasure of His Excellency’s plenipotentiary. Thesoldiers were satisfied by Walsh’s explanation, and allowed them to continue ontheir way.They turned north at the harbor, and headed up the coast road. Clarissa sighedin relief as she saw the last of the fires and tents finally fade into thedistance behind them. It wasn’t until they crested a hill, nearly an hour’s rideout after leaving the last of the soldiers, that the flash lit the sky behind.Clarissa heard a cheer from up on the driver’s seat. Walsh leaned down, grippinga rail with one arm, and stuck his face, nearly upside down, partly into thewindow. “Good job, Clarissa! You did it!”Clarissa grinned. He swung back up, and he and Bollesdun booted into the nightair. It was then that the sudden boom reached them, making Manda jump withfright.Verna, sitting in the center, opposite, produced a flame above her upturned palmand leaned toward Clarissa. “Job? What is it that you have done?” Clarissapatted the inky black book in her lap. “Nathan sent me for this book, and hewanted the ones left behind destroyed. He said that they were dangerous, whatwith you, and especially Warren, telling Jagang the meaning of the prophecies inthem. Nathan didn’t want Jagang to be able to use the information.”“I see,” Verna said. “Lucky for us that we agreed to swear loyalty to... LordRahl, and go with you.”Clarissa nodded. “Nathan said I was to offer you the chance, but in either case,I was to open that locket and leave it hidden there. He said that Jagang havingboth Warren and the prophecies together could ruin everything, if you toldJagang anything important.”Verna pressed her lips together as she let out a breath. She shared a look withWarren.“I can’t believe that after all this time. I’m finally going to get to meet theprophet himself,” Warren said. “Not long ago I had given up hope, and now... Iwill be meeting Nathan.”Verna harrumphed. “Out of the rain and into the lake. I can’t believe I’ve swornloyalty to that crazy old man.”Clarissa leaned forward. “Nathan is dashing. He isn’t old.” Verna barked alaugh. “You have no idea, child.”“And he isn’t crazy, either. Nathan is the kindest, most wonderful, mostgenerous man I’ve ever met!”Verna glanced down at Clarissa’s cleavage, and back up to her eyes. She had thatlook that Clarissa was used to seeing. “Yes,” Verna murmured. “I’m sure he is,my dear.”“You could have no better man to swear loyalty to,” Clarissa said. “Besidesbeing thoughtful and kind, Nathan is a powerful wizard. I saw him turn anotherwizard to a pile of dust.” Verna’s brow creased. “Another wizard?”Clarissa nodded. “Named Vincent. Vincent and another wizard and two Sisters,Jodelle and Willamina, came to see Nathan. They tried to hurt him. Nathan turnedVincent into a pile of ash.” Verna’s eyebrows rose.“After that,” Clarissa said, “they were very polite to Nathan, and Jagang agreedto give the book”-she tapped the book in her lap-”to Nathan. Jagang said Nathancould have either the book, or Sister Amelia. Now, Nathan will have both. Nathanhas great plans. Nathan will rule the world, one day.” Verna and Warren shared asidelong glance. She looked at Amelia. “What is this book, Amelia?”“I stole it from the Temple of the Winds,” Amelia said in a hoarse voice. “I’mthe only one who can use it. I started a plague. Thousands have already diedbecause of what I did. It was how Jagang eliminated Richard Rahl.“Thank the Creator that we still have Nathan Rahl to protect us with the bond tohim.”“Dear Creator,” Verna whispered, “what have we agreed to with our oath to thelikes of Nathan?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 63Richard rose from the wizard’s chair when he recognized the spirit glidingtoward him. He couldn’t call a specific spirit, and he didn’t always know theones who came, but he knew this one. With this one, he had a deep connection.The person this spirit once was, he had loathed, he had feared. Only once heunderstood her, and only after he had forgiven her for what she had done to him,was he able to gain his release. This one he had killed, and in so doing, hefreed her from her torment.This spirit was the one who had later brought Kahlan and Richard together inthat place between worlds. “Richard,” the spirit said as she seemed to smile.“Denna.”“I see you wear an Agiel. It is not mine.”Richard slowly shook his head. “It is that of yet another Mord-Sith who diedbecause of me.”“Raina. I knew her in the world of life, and I know her here. Since she passedinto the spirit world after the violation of the winds, she may not come to you,here. She is not one of those who holds sway over the forces involved as theypertain to you and the winds. Know that her spirit is at peace. You gave herpeace, in life, and so she asked me to come to you.”Richard rolled the red Agiel in his fingers. “I gave your Agiel to Kahlan. As Ipromised you, one time, only she is able to give me more pain than you.”“Only you, Richard, are able to give yourself more pain than I could give you.”“Have it your way. I care not to argue. It is good to see you, Denna.”“You may disagree, after I am finished with you.”Richard smiled at her nature showing through, even in her spirit form. “Youcannot harm me here, Denna.”“You think not? I may not be able to harm your body, but I can still hurt you.”She nodded to herself. “Oh, yes, Richard, I can hurt you.”“And how is that?”Denna lifted an arm. “I can make you remember-remember and make it real again.You and I have a past.” Richard spread his hands. “And to what purpose?” Dennaspread her luminous arms. “That is for you to decide, Richard.” With a flash oflight in his mind, the Temple of the Winds was gone, fading from hisconsciousness, and he was in a place he remembered: the castle in Tamarang. Hewas there again.He could taste the terror. Denna had captured him. She had tortured him fordays. He was delirious and weak. Every step was painful as he followed Dennathrough the grand dining hall. His wrists were cut and swollen from the manaclesshe used to shackle him up to a beam. When Denna stopped and spoke to people,Richard kept his eyes to her braid as he silently waited behind her.Denna controlled his life. his destiny. He was allowed only that which shegranted. He hadn’t eaten since she had captured him. He longed to eat something.Anything.All around, the jumble of talking and laughter from the queen’s guests droned inhis head. Denna, too, was a guest of the queen. Richard, at the end of a chainrunning from his mistress to a collar around his neck, was Denna’s prisoner.She hadn’t let him eat during those days of torture, and he needed food. As shesat at the dining table, Denna snapped her fingers, pointing at the floor behindher chair. Richard sank to the floor, relieved to be allowed that small comfort.He could rest. He wasn’t hanging from the shackles; he wasn’t being made tostand all night; he wasn’t being tortured.All of the guests were eating. The varied aromas tormented him. He ached withhunger. Everyone else was eating, but he had to sit on the floor behind Denna.watching what others enjoyed-what he was denied.Richard thought about the times he had been with Kahlan, at camp, eating rabbitcooked over the fire or porridge sweetened with berries. He licked his lipsthinking about the succulent, hot, tender meat, brown and crunchy on the outsidefrom the fire. He had so enjoyed those meals with her. The food and the companywere the best.Now, he was denied that life, and was yoked to another. After everyone else hadbeen eating for a while, a server brought a bowl of gruel. Denna had him hand itdown to Richard. He held it in trembling hands. Almost any time before, he wouldhave cast it aside in disgust, but now. it was all he had.He was made to put it on the floor and to eat it like a dog. while laughter fromthe guests filled his ears. He didn’t care. He was being allowed to eat at last.Gruel was all he was allowed, but at that moment, in his state of tormentedneed, it was wonderful-it was freedom from the ache of hunger, freedom from themisery of seeing others eat while he starved, fulfillment of a simple but longdenied need.He slurped at it, relishing it, gulping it down. He could not escape hisimprisonment in his new life, over which he had no say, and so he decided thatif gruel was all he would be allowed, then he would have to accept that fact,and sate his hunger with what he was given. The light flashed in his head.Color bled from his sight, vanishing almost painfully, and he saw again themuted mists of the Temple of the Winds around him.Richard was on his hands and knees on the floor, panting in terror. The glowingwhite spirit of Denna lowered over him.Denna was right. She could hurt him, still. This pain, though, she had given himout of love.Richard staggered to his feet. How could he have thought he was ignorant before,and that the knowledge of the Temple of the Winds had brought him new sight? Hehad had sight all along, but had failed to see. Knowledge without heart wasempty.Wizard Ricker had left, with the sliph, a message for him, but he had ignoredit.Ward left in. Ward right out. Guard your heart from stone. He had failed toguard his heart from stone, and it had almost cost him everything.“Thank you, Denna, for that gift of pain.”“It has taught you something, Richard?”“That I have to go home, back to my world.”“Thank you, Richard, for living up to what I expect of you.” Richard smiled.“Were you not a spirit. I’d kiss you.” Denna smiled a sad smile. “The thought isthe gift, Richard.” Richard shared a gaze with her for a moment, a gaze betweenworlds. “Denna, please tell Raina that we all love her.”“Raina knows this. Feelings of the heart cross the boundary.” Richard nodded.“Then you know how much we love you, too.”“That is why I came to vouch for you in your quest to the winds.” Richard heldhis arm out. “Would you escort me to the passageway? I would find peace in yourcompany before I leave this empty place. The worst is yet ahead of me.”Denna glided along at his side as he headed for the passageway out, striding theHall of the Winds for the last time. They didn’t speak; words were too paltry totouch what was in his heart.Near the great doors, the spirit of Darken Rahl waited.“Going somewhere, my son?” The sound of his words echoed painfully through thehall.Richard glared at the spirit of his father. “Back to my world.”“There is nothing for you there. Kahlan, your true love, is married to anotherman. She has sworn an oath to him before the spirits.”“You could never understand why I’m going back.”“Kahlan is married to my son, Drefan. You cannot have her now.”“That is not why I’m going back.”“Then why leave this place? The world of life will be empty for you now.”Richard stalked past the spirit of his father. He didn’t have to explain hisreasons to the one who had caused so much grief. Denna glided along besideRichard. At the doors. Darken Rahl appeared again, blocking the way. “You maynot leave.”“You can’t stop me.”“Oh, yes, my son, I can.”“You must let him pass,” Denna said. “Only if he agrees to the terms.” Richardturned to Denna. “What’s he talking about?”“The spirits set the requirements for your path into our world. Because it wasyour unique path here. Darken Rahl was called upon and given commensurate swayover your price for coming here, your sacrifice to come here. Darken Rahl setthe more onerous of the sacrifices, such as Drefan marrying Kahlan. If one whoparticipated in your coming so chooses, this spirit also has the right to setrequirements if you are to leave.”“I will simply banish him,” Richard said. “I know how to do that, now. I canbanish him from the winds, and then leave.”“It is not that simple,” Denna said. “You travelled from the world of life,through the underworld, to this place within the world of souls. You must returnthrough the underworld. The spirits can set a price. It must, however, be onethat is fair, in view of the forces and worlds involved, and it must be a pricewithin your ability to satisfy.”Richard ran his fingers back through his hair. “And I must pay?”“If he names a price within the edicts, then you must. If you are to return toyour world.”Smiling that vile smile of his. Darken Rahl glided closer. “I only have twosmall, insignificant requirements. Meet them, and you may return to yourbrother, Drefan, and his wife.”Richard glared. “Name them, but if you set the price too high, and I choose notto pay it and remain here instead, then I swear I will devote my eternity tomaking your soul twist in torment. And you know I can do it-the winds havetaught me how.”“Then I guess you will have to decide just how important this is to you, my son.I think you will pay it.”Richard didn’t want to tell him how important it was, or the price would climb.“Name the price, and I will decide if I will pay it. I was willing to stay here,I may yet decide to do so.”Darken Rahl came closer, close enough that the pain of his spirit coruscationwas almost enough to make Richard back away. He willed himself to hold hisground, without a shield of magic.“Oh, the price is going to be high, indeed, but I think you will pay it. I knowyou, Richard. I know your foolish heart. Even this price, you will pay for her.”Darken Rahl did indeed know Richard’s heart. Darken Rahl, after all, was the onewho had almost destroyed it. “Name the price or be gone.”“First, the knowledge of the Temple of the Winds was not yours before you cameto this place. You will return as you came-without the knowledge you acquiredhere. Back in your world, you will be as you were before you left it.” Richardhad expected as much. “Agreed.”“Oh, very good, my son. How eager, how earnest, you are. Will you agree to thesecond requirement so readily?” His smile seemed as if it would strip flesh frombone. “I wonder.” His voice went on in a lethal hiss.When Darken Rahl named the second requirement, Richard’s knees nearly buckled.“Can he do that?” Richard could manage no more than a whisper. “Can he demandthat?”Denna stared back with sombre, spirit eyes. “Yes.”Richard turned away from the two spirits. Head bent, he pressed his hand overhis eyes. “It is that important to me,” he whispered. “I agree to the price.”“I knew you would.” Darken Rahl’s malevolent laugh echoed the length of theTemple of the Winds. “I knew that even this, you would pay for her.”Richard gathered his senses. He slowly turned, lifting his hand toward the evilspirit.“And with this price, you have shown me your barren spirit. In that, dearfather, you have made a mistake, for I can now use that emptiness against you.”The laughter died out. “You have agreed to the price I have set within my rightand power. You can do nothing but banish me from the winds, and that will notnegate the price; the world of souls will enforce it, now that it is named andaccepted.”“So they will,” Richard said. “But you will taste my revenge for all you havedone, including the price you have demanded, when you could have stopped withthe first as fair.”Richard freed a pristine flow of Subtractive Magic, uncontaminated by so much asa scintilla of the Additive. It was the force of the void unleashed. Totaloblivion of Light engulfed the spirit of Darken Rahl. A wail came from that deepforever as Darken Rahl was plunged into the unmitigated shadow of the Keeper ofthe Underworld, where not the slightest trace of Light from the Creator shone.It was the pain of denial of that Light that was the true torture of theKeeper’s dark eternity.When he was gone, Richard turned once more to the passageway back to the worldof life.“I am sorry, Richard,” came Denna’s tender voice. “None but he would havedemanded this of you.”“I know,” Richard whispered as he called the lightning to take him back. “Dearspirit, I know.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 64Drefan hooked his hand under her arm and pulled her shoulder against him. At thewhite ruffles of his shirt hung two red Agiel.“Isn’t it about time you ended this pretense, my wife? Isn’t it about time yougave in to your desires, and admitted your hunger for me?”Kahlan glared into his blue. Darken Rahl eyes. “Are you really mad, Drefan, ordo you just pretend it? I agreed to wed you to save lives, not because I wantedit. When will you ever admit it to yourself? I do not love you, nor will Iever.”“Love? When have I ever mentioned love? I speak of passion.”“You are delusional if you think I will ever-”“You already have. You want it again.”It cut her to the heart that he had so easily deduced what had happened withRichard. He pointed it out constantly. He taunted her for it. It was her eternalpunishment for what she had done, a stain she couldn’t annul.Distant thunder rumbled through the mountains as the spring storm that had comeso suddenly moved on, away from the city. The wild lightning had reminded Kahlanof Richard. She had stood at the window, watching the violent flashes,remembering. “Never.”“You are my wife. You have sworn an oath.”“Yes, Drefan, I have sworn an oath, and I am your wife. I will live by my words,but the spirits are satisfied with what I have given. They demand no more, orthe plague would not be gone.” She pulled her arm away. “If you want me, thenyou will have to rape me, for that is what it will be. I will not go to your bedwillingly, nor easily.”His smile was maddening. “I can wait until you finally give in to your lust. Iwant you to enjoy it. I long for you finally to admit it, to ask for it.” Hestalked away, but turned back when she called his name. “What are you doing withCara and Berdine’s Agiel?”Touching an Agiel was painful only if it was one that had been used against youin the past-if you had been the prisoner of a Mord-Sith. Agiel were weapons onlyin the hands of the Mord-Sith to whom they belonged, but without the bond to atrue Lord Rahl they no longer functioned. For Drefan, they were nothing morethan obscene decoration.He lifted the red rods away from his chest to have a look at them. “Well, Ithought that since I am the Lord Rahl now, I should wear these, as a symbol ofmy authority. After all, Richard wore one. You wear one.”“The Agiel we wear are not symbols of authority. They are symbols of our respectfor the women to whom they belonged.” He shrugged as he let them drop back down.“The army seems quite intimidated to see me wearing them. That will do. Goodnight, my dear. Sleep well.” His sly smile returned. “Call out if you have needof anything.”Muttering a curse under her breath, Kahlan shouldered open the door to herrooms. She was exhausted, and wanted only to fall into bed. but she knew thather racing mind would deny her sleep. Berdine was waiting for her.“Is he gone to bed?” she asked, referring to Drefan. “Yes,” Kahlan said, “as Iam about to do.”“No. you can’t. You have to come with me.”Kahlan frowned at the serious look on Berdine’s face. “Where do you want me togo?”“We have to go up to the Keep.”“What’s wrong? Is it the sliph? Has someone tried to come through the sliph?”Berdine waved dismissively as she stepped closer. “No, no, it’s not the sliph.”“Then what is it?”“I just want you to come up there with me, that’s all. I want some company.”Kahlan stroked her hand down the woman’s shoulder. “Berdine, I know how lonelyyou are, but it’s late, I have a headache, and I’m tired. All afternoon andevening I’ve been in meetings with Drefan, General Kerson, and a number ofofficers. Drefan wants to move the troops back to D’Hara-for us all to go toD’Hara. He wants to abandon the Midlands to the Order and concentrate ondefending D’Hara. I’ve been arguing myself blue.“I need to go to bed and get some rest so I can get up in the morning and tryagain to convince them of the folly of Drefan’s plan. The general isn’t so surethat Drefan isn’t right. I am.”“Sleep later. You are coming up to the Keep with me.”Kahlan gazed into the Mord-Sith’s eyes. And that was what they were: Mord-Sitheyes. This was not Berdine speaking, it was mistress Berdine, as cold anddemanding as any Mord-Sith came. “Not until you tell me why,” Kahlan said in alevel tone. Berdine seized Kahlan’s arm. “You are going up to the Keep with me.You can either go sitting in the saddle, or lying over it-your choice-but youare going, and you are going now.”Kahlan had never seen such a look of determination in Berdine’s eyes. It wasfrightening. That was the only word for it: frightening. “All right, if it’sthat important to you, let’s go. I just want to know why.” Instead of answering,Berdine tightened her grip on Kahlan’s arm and forced her to the door. Berdinecracked the door, checking, then opened it enough to stick her head out for alook. “It’s clear,” she whispered. “Come on.”“Berdine, you’re scaring me. What’s going on?”Without answering, Berdine shoved her through the door. They took the servicestairs and avoided the passageways that were heavily patrolled. Berdine musthave spoken with the guards they did encounter, because when the two of themapproached, the guards turned the other way, looking off as if they had seen noone.Two horses waited, both army horses, big bay geldings.Berdine tossed a soldier’s cloak at Kahlan. “Here, put this on to cover thatwhite dress of yours so people won’t recognize you, or Drefan will hear aboutit.”“Why don’t you want Drefan to know where we’re going?” Berdine seized Kahlan’sankle and stuffed her foot into the stirrup. The stirrup was big and loose, madefor a man’s boot. Berdine smacked Kahlan’s bottom. “Get it up there.”Kahlan abandoned her resistance. Berdine obviously wasn’t going to tell her whatthe urgency was about. The ride to the Wizard’s Keep was silent, as was themarch through the empty halls, passageway, and rooms.Before they turned down the last stone corridor to the sliph, they encounteredCara standing guard outside a door. Cara, like Berdine, was unreadable in herstern demeanor as she watched Berdine and Kahlan hurry toward her.At the door, Berdine seized the lever with one hand and Kahlan’s arm with theother.The look in Berdine’s eye was unequivocal sobriety. “Don’t you dare disappointme. Mother Confessor, or you will find out exactly why Mord-Sith are so feared.Cara and I will be with the sliph.”Without looking back, Cara started out toward the sliph while Berdine, withoutfurther word, opened the door and roughly shoved Kahlan into the room. Kahlanstumbled, catching her balance as she glanced back to see Berdine pull shut thedoor.Kahlan turned, and found herself looking into Richard’s eyes. Her heart seemedto stop along with her breathing.A half dozen candles in an iron stand reflected little points of light in hisgrey eyes. He seemed bigger than life. Every detail was as she remembered. Onlyhis sword was missing from that of her mental image of him. Ambivalence kept herbreath locked in her lungs. Finally, she found words. “The plague is ended.”“I know.”The room felt so small. The stone so dark. The air so heavy. She labored tobreathe, to slow her suddenly racing heart.His forehead was beaded with sweat, even though it was cool in the depths of theKeep. A drop rolled down over his cheekbone, leaving a wet trail.“Then what are you doing here? There can be no point to it. I have a husband. Wehave nothing to say to each other... not after... not here, like this, alone.”His gaze left hers at hearing the cool tone of her voice. She had hoped it wouldforce him to say it. Dear spirits, let him say he forgives me.He said instead, “I asked Cara and Berdine to bring you here so I could talk toyou. I came back because I must speak with you. Will you grant me that much?”Kahlan didn’t know what to do with her hands. “Of course, Richard.”He nodded his thanks. He looked in pain. He looked in anguish. His eyes had thedull gloss of distress.She wanted nothing so much as for him to say that he forgave her. Only thatwould mend her broken heart. Those were the only words that would mean anythingto her. She wanted him to say it, but he just stood there, while his gazefocused beyond the cold stone of the walls.She decided that if he was going to say it, to forgive her, then the only waywas to force him into it. “So, have you come to forgive me, Richard?”His words came softly, but with great resolve.“No, I did not come to forgive you. I can’t forgive you, Kahlan.”-She turnedaway. She finally found something to do with her hands; she pressed her fistsagainst her stomach. “I see.”“Kahlan,” he said from behind her, “I can’t forgive you because it would bewrong of me to come here to forgive you.“Would you have me forgive your humanity? Shall I forgive you slaking yourthirst? Shall I forgive your eating when you hunger? Shall I forgive you for thefeel of warm sunlight on your face?”Kahlan wiped at her cheeks and then turned to him. “What are you talking about?”The stem of a rose was stuck behind his belt. Richard lifted the rose and heldit out to her. “Your mother gave this to me.”“My mother?”Richard nodded. “She asked if I found enjoyment in it, and when I told her thatI did, she asked if I would then return to you. It took a long time for me tounderstand what she meant.”“And what did she mean?”“What she meant is that we have the capacity to enjoy such things. Is it wrongfor you to find pleasure at the sight of a rose, in its fragrance, if I am notthe one who gave it to you? How can I forgive you that?”“Richard, this is far different from finding pleasure in the fragrance of arose.” He sank to one knee. He put a fist to his abdomen. “Kahlan. I was onceconnected to a woman by my flesh, as you were connected to your mother. That isthe only connection of flesh we have in this life.”His fist moved to his chest. “It is here that we connect ever after that. We canbe connected only in our hearts. You did not give him your heart. That was mineand mine alone.“The winds, the spirits, took their price from you. They left you with little,and you chose to take what was left and to live. You chose to be human. Youchose to live life as best you could with what you had left of yourself. Youfought for life. You simply took pleasure to which you were entitled.“I do not own you. You are not my slave. There is nothing for me to forgive. Youdid not betray me in your heart. It would be presumption of the worst order if Icame with an offer of forgiveness when you never betrayed me with your heart.”Kahlan could feel herself trembling as she drew a breath. “You hurt me. Richard.I thought my heart was safe with you, always, no matter what, and you walkedaway from me. You promised it was. You wouldn’t even let me try to explain.”“I know,” he whispered.His other knee touched the floor as he bent at her feet. His head bowed. “Thatis why I have returned. I have come to beg your forgiveness. I am the one whowas wrong. I am the one who caused the true pain. I am the one who betrayed ourhearts, not you. It is the worst sin I could commit, and I alone am guilty ofit.“I am without defense. There can be no excuse. “I’m so sorry for what I’ve doneto you, Kahlan. I cannot undo the wrong I have done. I have wounded your heart,and for that, I throw myself before you, and beg your forgiveness. I do notdeserve it, and so cannot ask it; I can only beg it.”The way he knelt at her feet, she lowered over him. “Will you forgive me,Richard?”“There is no room in my heart to hold anything for you but love, even though wecannot be together. Though I am free of my oath, you are sworn to another, and Imust respect that, but I cannot help that I can love no other but you. If yourheart wishes it, then I forgive you.“Please, Kahlan, all I can have in this life, if you will grant it, is yourforgiveness.” Mere moments before she had had doubts, been uncertain as to hertrue feelings about him. Now, absolute conviction avalanched through her.Kahlan sank down to the floor before him. She put her hands to his shoulders andurged him to look up at her.“I forgive you, Richard. With all my heart, I love you and I forgive you.” Hesmiled a sad smile. “Thank you.”She could feel the miracle other heart mending, of joy flooding into theemptiness, like life itself returning.“At the ceremony, when I was being married to Drefan, I said the words aloudthat they demanded, but in my mind, in my heart, I was saying the oath ofmarriage to you.”Richard wiped a tear from her chin. “I did the same.” She squeezed his arms.“Richard, what are we going to do now?”“There is nothing to do now. You are sworn to Drefan.” She touched her fingersto his face. “But what about you? What about you and me?”His smile left. He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. I have what I needed-what I came for. You have returned my heart.”“But, how can we go on like this? Not only that, but we have to do something,and fast. Drefan wants to withdraw the troops back to D’Hara and make a standagainst the Order there.”Anger flashed in Richard’s eyes. “No. You can’t let him do that, Kahlan. If youlet Jagang divide the New World, he will take it one piece at a time, withD’Hara the last to fall. You can’t let Drefan do that. Promise me you won’t.”“I don’t need to promise. You are Lord Rahl. You can stop it, now. I am theMother Confessor. We’ll do it together.”“You must do it, Kahlan. I can’t help you.”“But why not? You’ve returned. Everything will work out. We’ll think ofsomething-find a way. You are the Seeker, you always find a way.”“I’m dying.”Ice flashed through her. “What? What... do you mean, you’re dying? Richard, youcan’t die, not now. Not after... No, Richard, no, it’s all right now. You’reback. Everything is going to be all right.”She saw it then, the pain in his eyes, and realized, when he slumped to a hip,that he was unable to stand.“In order for me to return, the spirits demanded a price.” He coughed, wincingin pain. She clutched at him. “What are you talking about? What price?”“When I was there, at the Temple of the Winds, I gained all the knowledge there.I understood my power. I could use it. I used it to stop the plague. I somehowinterrupted the flow of power from the winds that made the book of magic workingthis world.”“You mean that you no longer know how to do it? You mean the plague will comeback?”He lifted a hand to allay her fear. “No, the plague will not return. But as theprice of returning to this world, I was not allowed to keep the knowledge of thewinds. I had to come back as I was before.”“But... you mean that you are simply mortal, like before?”“No. They demanded more. They demanded that if I was to return, I had to takethe magic of the stolen book into myself to keep it from the rest of the worldof life.”“What?” Kahlan breathed, wide-eyed. “You don’t mean-”“I have the plague.”She gripped his shoulder with one hand, and felt his forehead with the other. Hewas burning with fever. “Richard, why didn’t you tell me before?”He smiled through the pain. “Forgiveness was all I needed, all I wanted, but Ihad to know it was true, and not granted out of pity.”“Richard, you can’t die. Not now. Dear spirits, you can’t die!”“The dear spirits had nothing to do with this. It was Darken Rahl who choseDrefan to be your husband, as the price of the path into the winds, and DarkenRahl who demanded this as the price of my return.”“Your return. Don’t tell me that you only came back to die? Oh, Richard, whywould you do such a foolish thing?”“If I had stayed at the Temple of the Winds, I would eventually have died, butwithout your forgiveness. I chose, instead, to return and hope that a part ofyou still loved me enough to forgive me, so I could die with that much at least.With your love back. I couldn’t go on, knowing what I had done to you, knowinghow I had hurt your heart.”“And you don’t think this hurts my heart! Richard, there has to be something wecan do. What can we do? Please, you must have known!”Richard fell onto his side, holding his stomach. “I’m sorry, Kahlan. There isnothing. I am absorbing the magic from the book that was stolen. When I die, themagic will die with me.”Kahlan crouched over him, clutching at him, as the tears overwhelmed her.“Richard, please don’t do this. Please don’t die.”“I’m sorry, Kahlan. I can’t stop it. I gladly paid the price. My heart is atpeace, now.” He reached up and touched the Agiel hanging from the chain at herthroat. “There was never a moment’s hesitation, once I understood. Denna helpedme to understand.”Kahlan hugged him as he rolled onto his back. “Richard, there must be something.You would have known what to do, before they took the knowledge from you. Try toremember. Please, Richard, try to remember.”His eyelids drooped. “I need... to rest. I’m sorry. I used all my strength. Ineed to rest a bit. “Kahlan gripped his hand in both others as she wept. It was all too overwhelmingto endure. To have him back, only to lose him was too crushing to endure. Sheopened his limp hand, to press it to her cheek, and saw something in his palm.She pulled back his fingers, and through the tears, she saw writing in the palmof his hand. It said, Find book, destroy it to live.Kahlan sprawled over his unconscious form and grabbed his other hand. It, too,had writing in it. Pinch of white sorcerer’s sand on third page. One grain ofblack sorcerer’s sand tossed on.There were three other words, but in her mind’s state of chaotic disorder, shecouldn’t think of how pronounce them.He knew he was going to forget, and before he did, he wrote a message tohimself. He had even forgotten that he had written it. The book. She had to havethe book. And then she was running, screaming as she went. “Cara, Berdine! Helpme! Cara! Berdine!”Both women dashed out of the sliph’s room, out onto the walkway beside the inkypool, when they heard Kahlan screaming their names as she raced into the towerroom.Kahlan grasped at their leather as she tried to explain. They each seized one ofKahlan’s arms and pressed her up against the wall. “Slow down,” Berdine said.“We can’t understand you,” Cara said. “Get your breath. Stop crying and get yourbreath.”“Richard-” She tried to point but they held her arms. “Richard has the plague...I need the book.”Berdine leaned in close. “Lord Rahl... has the plague?” Kahlan noddedfrantically. “I have to get the book. The book that was stolen from the Templeof the Winds. I have to get it or he will die.” Kahlan tore her arms away fromthem. “Please help me. Richard has the plague.”“What do you need us to do?” Cara asked. “I’m going to the Old World. Protecthim.”“The Old World!” Berdine gasped. “Do you know where the book is? Did he tell youwhere to find it? Did he give you any hint?” Kahlan shook her head. There wasn’ttime. She had to hurry. She had to go. “I don’t know where it is! But it’s theonly chance he has. He took on the magic of the plague in order to return tothis world. In order to beg my forgiveness. He wanted to tell me he was sorryfor hurting me. If we don’t destroy the book, he’ll die-just so he could say hewas sorry. He’ll die! I have to go!”“But, Mother Confessor,” Berdine said, “the Old World is a big place. If Richardhas the plague... how can you hope to find the book?”In time. That was what she meant. How could she hope to find the book in time?Before Richard died.Kahlan gripped a fistful of red leather. “I have to try! Protect Richard. Don’tlet Drefan know that Richard is back. I don’t know what Drefan would do. Don’ttell him!”Cara was shaking her head. “Don’t worry about that. We won’t tell Drefan. We’lltake care of Richard while you’re gone. We’ll hide him here in the Keep. Buthurry. If you can’t find it, please come back before-”Kahlan rushed into the room with the sliph. She raced to the sliph’s well. Thesliph smiled at seeing her. “Do you wish-”“Travel! I need to travel! Now!”“To where do you wish to travel?”“The Old World!”“Where in the Old World? There are a number of places I know there. We can go toany you wish. I will take you. You will be pleased.”Kahlan pressed her hands to her head, growling in frustration as the sliphstarted naming places Kahlan had never heard of.“The place you came to with Richard, with your Master, when he went to get me!The first time I travelled with you!”“I know the place of which you speak.”Kahlan hiked up her white dress and clambered up onto the wall of the well.“That place! Take me there! Hurry! Your master’s life is at stake!”“Protect Richard,” Kahlan called out to Cara and Berdine. “What should we tellDrefan when he wants to know where you are?” Berdine asked.“I don’t know. You’ll have to think of something!”“We will care for Richard until you return,” Cara said. “May the good spirits bewith you.”“Tell him I love him. If... tell him I love him!” she called out as the sliph’ssilver arm swept Kahlan from the top of the wall.Her voice was still echoing off the stone walls when Kahlan was plunged into thequicksilver froth. She gasped in the sliph, praying to the good spirits thatthey would help her find the book. With frantic effort, she swam into what inthe past had been the silver rapture. Now, there was only dark terror."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 65Ann leaned toward him. “This is your fault, you know.”Zedd, sitting on the floor in the center of the room with her, glanced over.“You broke her prized mirror.”“That was an accident,” Ann insisted. “You are the one who ruined their shrine.”“I was simply trying to get it clean. How was I to know that it would catchfire? They shouldn’t have put all those dried flowers around it. You were theone who spilled that berry wine on her best dress.”Ann turned her nose up. “The pitcher was too full. You’re the one who filled it.Besides, you broke his prized knife handle. He won’t ever be able to find aburied wassen root like that one again. He was understandably upset.”Zedd harrumphed. “What do I know about sharpening knives? I’m a wizard, not ablacksmith.”“That would explain the incident with the elder’s horse.”“They can’t blame that on me. I didn’t leave the gate open. At least, I’m prettysure I didn’t leave it open. Anyway, there is bound to be another horse thatfast he can buy. He can afford it. What I want to know is how you managed toturn his number three wife’s hair that color green.”Ann folded her arms. “Well, it was an accident. I thought those herbs would makeher hair smell good. I wanted to surprise her. But the elder’s prized rabbitskin headdress-that was no accident; that was plain laziness. You should havechecked it sooner, instead of leaving it to dry unattended over the fire. Thatheaddress was a work of art, what with those thousands of beads. He won’t easilyreplace such a nice headdress.”Zedd shrugged. “Well, we never told them that we were any good at domestictasks. We never told them that at all.”“Quite right. We didn’t. It’s not our fault if we didn’t work out. We could havetold them, if they’d asked.”“We certainly could have.”Ann cleared her throat into the silence. “What do you think they are going to dowith us?”Both of them were sitting back to back, bound together with a coarse rope, whilethe meeting across the room dragged on. They still wore the wristbands that keptthem from using their magic.Zedd glanced across the room, where a heated discussion was being conducted. Thebareheaded elder, his number one wife, several influential members of the SiDoak community who had claimed rights to use the services of the captives, andthe Si Doak shaman, were all complaining to one another about troubles they hadhad. Zedd couldn’t understand all of the words, but he could understand enoughto follow the deliberations.“They’ve decided they want to cut their losses and rid themselves of theirdomestic slaves,” Zedd whispered to Ann.“What’s happening?” Ann asked, when the chattering finally came to an end. “Whathave they decided? Are they going to set us free?”The eyes across the room all turned to the captives. Zedd made a warning soundto Ann.“I think maybe we should have been a little more attentive to our chores,” Zeddwhispered over his shoulder. “I think we’re in a great deal of trouble.”“Why, what are they going to do,” Ann mocked, “return us to the Nangtong anddemand their blankets back?”Zedd shook his head as the Si Doak rose up. The shaman’s necklaces jangledtogether. The elder thumped his staff.“I wish they would. They want to get back all their costs and something towardthe damages. They are going to take us on a journey.“They have just decided that they can get the best price for us by selling us tocannibals.”Ann’s head swung around. “Cannibals?”“That’s what they said. Cannibals.”“Zedd, you were able to take the collar off your neck. Can’t you get theseconfounded bracelets off our wrists? I think that now would be the time.”“I’m afraid we may end up in a cook pot with them still on us.” Zedd watched anangry elder and a seething shaman stalking toward them. “Well, it’s been fun,Ann. But I’m afraid the fun is over.”Verna put an arm around Warren’s waist, trying to help him as he stumbled along.as she followed behind Clarissa, who was following behind Walsh and Bollesdun.Janet hurried to the other side of Warren and lifted his arm, draping it overher shoulder.“Are you sure?” Verna whispered to Walsh. “Here? Nathan wanted us to meet him inthe Hagen Woods?”“Yes,” Walsh said over his shoulder. “That was the name he told me, too,”Clarissa added.Verna let out an annoyed breath. It was just like Nathan to make them go intothe Hagen Woods. Even if Richard had cleared the mriswith from this place, shestill didn’t like it. Verna always suspected Nathan of being dangerouslyunbalanced, and that he would want her to meet him here only confirmed it.Trailers of moss hung down, like gauzy rags of the dead. Roots tripped theirfeet as they moved through the darkness. Unpleasant odors wafted in on the warm,humid air. Verna had never been this deep into the Hagen Woods before-and forgood reason.“How are you doing, Warren?” she whispered. “Fine,” he mumbled in a groggyvoice.“It won’t be long. Warren. It won’t be long, now. Just a little farther, andthen it will be over. Nathan will help you.”“Nathan,” he mumbled under his breath. “Must warn him.” They came upon a massivestone block that was obviously worked by man; it was square. It was nearlycovered with snaking tendrils and gnarled roots. More stones, like white bonesin the moonlight, jutted up from the thick vegetation. She saw the low, jaggedremains of a wall, and columns, looking like the ribs of a monster.Light shone through the undergrowth. The way it flickered it appeared to be thelight of a campfire. Walsh and Bollesdun held aside the branches for the rest ofthem. The fire was set in a circle of rocks placed on the stone floor of oldruins. Beyond the fire Verna could see the round wall of a large well, orsomething like a well. She had never known that this place was hidden in theHagen Woods, but as infrequently as anyone went into the Hagen Woods, thatwasn’t surprising.Nathan, dressed like a rich nobleman, rose to greet them. He was tall, andintimidating, especially without a Rada’Han around his neck. When he saw themall, he grinned that confident Rahl grin. Walsh and Bollesdun laughed aloud, andreceived good-natured slaps on the back.Clarissa ducked under an arm, throwing hers around Nathan’s midsection. Hegrunted when she squeezed with all her might and ardor. When she proudly heldout the book, he took it from her. He gave her a private smile, laden withmeaning. Clarissa’s eyes sparkled. Verna’s eyes rolled.“Verna!” Nathan called out when he saw her. “Glad you could make it.”“How good to see you. Lord Rahl.”“You shouldn’t scowl like that, Verna. You’ll get wrinkles.” He scanned theothers. “Janet, so you have joined us, too.” His brow tightened a bit. “AndAmelia.” He looked to the other woman, standing off to the side. “And who havewe here?”Clarissa held out an arm, wiggling her fingers, urging Manda forward. Fromunderneath, Manda’s fists tightened the cloak at her throat. She timidly steppedforward.“Nathan, this is a friend of mine, Manda. From Renwold.” Manda put a knee to theground as she bowed deeply. “Lord Rahl. My life is yours.”“Renwold.” Nathan’s brow twitched again as he glanced briefly at Clarissa. “Yes,well, glad you escaped from Jagang, Manda.”“I owe it all to Clarissa,” Manda said as she came to her feet. “She is thebravest woman I’ve ever seen.”Clarissa giggled as she pressed herself to Nathan. “Nonsense. I’m so thankfulthat the good spirits put you where they did, or I’d never have even known youwere there.”Nathan turned his attention back toward Verna. “Who have we here? The youngWarren, I presume?”Verna did her best to smooth her own brow. “Nathan-”“Lord Rahl.” His grin cracked through the scowl. “But we are old friends, Verna.I am still Nathan to you, and all my old friends.” Verna dipped her head as shebit the inside of her cheek. “Nathan,” she began again, “you’re right; this isWarren. Can you help him? He’s just coming into prophecy, just starting to havethem. I took his collar off a while back and there is nothing to protect himfrom the gift. He’s having the headaches. Nathan, he’s in a bad way. I’ll followyou anywhere if you will help him.”“Help him?”“Please, Nathan. I’m begging you.”“Nothing to it. Verna. I’d be delighted to help the boy.” Nathan gestured.“Bring him over here by the fire.”Warren mumbled, trying to introduce himself, but he was nearly unconscious.Verna and Janet helped him down where Nathan pointed, and balanced him upright.Nathan hiked up his trousers at his knees and lowered himself to the stone floorof the missing building, sitting cross-legged. He set the book beside him. Hisbrow drew down in that Rahl frown as he studied Warren’s face. He waved his handat Verna and Janet, ordering them away. With a web, Nathan held Warren upright.He inched forward, until their knees touched.“Warren,” Nathan called in that deep, commanding voice of his. Warren’s eyesopened. “Hold up your hands.”Fingers extended, both Warren and Nathan held up their hands. They pressed theirfingers together. Their eyes fixed on each other.“Let your Han flow into my fingertips,” Nathan said in gentle prompting. “Openthe seventh gateway. Close the others. You know of what I speak?”“Yes.”“That’s a good lad. Do it then. It will make it easier if I have your help.” Awarm, mellow glow enveloped both men. The night air hummed with the power fromthat light. It was neither flame nor heat. Verna didn’t know what Nathan wasdoing. She was somewhat astounded that Nathan did.Nathan had always been something of a enigma at the Palace of the Prophets. Hehad seemed an old man to her even when Verna was a young girl. He had alwaysbeen regarded as, at the least, unbalanced, even by the most magnanimous of theSisters.There were those at the palace who didn’t believe that Nathan had more than theslightest hint of the gift in anything but prophecy. Others suspected, but werenever sure, that he was capable of much more than he ever showed them. Therewere others who were so terrified of him that they feared going to the roomswhere he was confined, even though he had a Rada’Han around his neck. Verna hadalways considered Nathan trouble on two feet.Now, she watched as this troublesome old lecher of a wizard did his best to savethe life of the man Verna loved. At times, the light glowed more strongly in oneman than the other, before passing away, and then coming back, as if it hadforgotten something and then returned for it.Walsh and Bollesdun loafed near the round stone wall behind Nathan, but the restof the party watched transfixed. Verna had no more idea what Nathan was doingthan did Manda.What unnerved Verna the most was when both men, their knees touching, theirfingers pressed together, floated a few inches off the ground. She was relievedwhen they at last settled back down.Nathan clapped his hands together once. “There” he announced. “That should doit.”Verna couldn’t see how that could have possibly been enough to set the giftright in Warren.Warren, though, wore a wide grin. “Nathan, that was-marvellous. The headache iscompletely gone. I feel so clearheaded-so alive.”Nathan picked up the inky book and stood. “I enjoyed it, too, my boy. Took thatgaggle of Sisters near to three hundred years to do for me what I have just donefor you. But then they were a misguided lot.” He glanced Verna’s way. “Sorry,Prelate. No slight intended.”“None taken.” Verna rushed to Warren’s side. “Thank you, Nathan. I was soworried for him. You have no idea what a relief this is.”Warren’s face was losing the joyous look. “Nathan, now that you have done thisfor me, I can see more clearly that... we have inadvertently given Jaganginsight into prophecy that-”Nathan cried out. Clarissa cried out. Verna froze. She could feel somethingsharp pressed to her back.Amelia had a dacra stabbed in the back of Nathan’s thigh. Manda had a knife atClarissa’s throat. Janet was holding a weapon at Verna’s back. Warren stiffenedwhen Janet held a warning finger to him and then to the two soldiers.“Don’t you move a muscle, Nathan,” Amelia said, “or I let flow my Han, and youare instantly dead.”“Warren is right,” Janet said. “He did, in fact, give His Excellency some veryvaluable information.”“Amelia, Janet!” Verna cried out. “What are you doing?” Amelia turned a wickedsmile on Verna. “His Excellency’s bidding, of course.”“But you swore the oath.”“We swore the oath in word only, not in our hearts.”“But you can be free of him! You don’t need to serve Jagang!”“Had you told us true the first time, maybe, but once we tried, and failed tohold the bond when Richard died. His Excellency punished us. We’ll not take thechance again.”“Don’t do this,” Verna pleaded. “We’re friends. I came to save you. Don’t dothis, please. Swear the bond, and you will be free!”“Oh, darlin. I’m afraid she can’t do that.” It was not Amelia’s voice alone, butmore. It was the voice Verna had heard in her own head: Jagang. She felt herselfsuddenly trembling, just at hearing his tone and inflection in Amelia’s voice.“Now, my loyal and faithful plenipotentiary, hand over the book. Sister Ameliaand I have more use of it.”Nathan held it out to the side. With her other hand, the one not on the dacra inhis leg, Amelia snatched back the book. “Well,” Nathan said, “are you going tokill me, or not?”“Oh, yes, I intend to kill you,” Amelia said in Jagang’s voice. “You betrayedour bargain. Lord Rahl. Besides, I don’t like having subordinates who won’tallow me into their minds.“Before you die, I thought I’d let you watch how a real slave obeys orders. Ithought you’d like to watch me cut your little darlin Clarissa’s throat.”Breathe.Kahlan expelled the sliph from her lungs, and with frantic need, sucked in thealien air. Night crashed in around her. She refused to spare the time to fearthe sudden vision, the sudden sound, to give it time to settle into place in hermind, and instead seized the stone wall to hoist herself out.A frightening sight-to match the words she had already heard-greeted her. Withher vision enhanced by the sliph, she took in the whole scene at once, in oneslamming jolt.The instant she saw him. Kahlan knew this was Nathan. He looked like a Rahl, andRichard had told her about Nathan-tall. older, with long white hair to hisshoulders. A woman had stabbed a dacra into his leg, and was holding it there.Kahlan had heard her name: Amelia-the one who had started the plague. Kahlan sawVerna, with a woman at her back. A young man stood frozen. Kahlan saw abeautiful young woman holding another woman by a fistful of hair done inringlets- it could only be Clarissa. The woman’s other fist held a knife at theterrified Clarissa’s throat.As Kahlan had emerged from the sliph, she was conscious of the last part of theconversation that had just taken place, and knew well the voice coming from thewoman holding the dacra in Nathan’s leg. Kahlan knew well the word “darlin.” Sheremembered hearing that voice from the wizard, Marlin, who had come toassassinate Richard. It was Jagang’s voice.The image of the amulet Richard wore came unbidden into Kahlan’s mind. It meansonly one thing, and everything: cut. Once committed to fight, cut. Everythingelse is secondary’. Cut.Her training at the hands of her warrior father had been much the same. Kill orbe killed. Never yield. Never wait. Attack.Richard was near death-near his last breath. She had no time to spare, no timeto consider. She was committed. Cut.In one fluid movement, she erupted from the sliph, dived out of the well, yankeda short sword free of the scabbard on the soldier standing right there, duckedher head, tumbled forward, and came up with the sword already whipping down.In the span of a heartbeat, before anyone had time to flinch, Kahlan was there.She had to stop Amelia before she released her magic into the dacra in Nathan’sleg, or he would be dead. Like lightning, her sword descended, severing SisterAmelia’s arm at the crook of her elbow.And then, everything moved in a painfully slow dance. Kahlan could see theexpression on every face. The woman Kahlan had just cut. Sister Amelia, wasfalling back with a cry. Already, Kahlan’s sword was whirling, to reverse herhandhold, as she followed her quarry down. Verna was spinning, a dacra in herown hand, toward a surprised woman behind her. The young man was diving towardthe woman with the knife. Nathan’s hands were coming up toward Clarissa. Hisscream cut through the night.Clarissa was reaching toward Nathan. The young woman holding her by the hairsnarled with a vicious sneer, and savagely cut through Clarissa’s throat.Kahlan saw the spray of blood for only an instant before the night exploded withlightning from both Nathan and the young man.Her left hand now joined with her right, Kahlan slammed her sword down throughSister Amelia’s heart, pinning her to the ground before the second soldier hadhis sword clear of his scabbard.Verna’s dacra expeditiously dispatched the woman behind her at the same time asthe young woman with the knife took two bolts of lightning, shattering her in ared horror as Clarissa’s body still collapsed toward the ground. The violencewas over before comprehension could catch up with it. In a daze, Nathanstaggered toward Clarissa’s body. Kahlan rushed past him and knelt besideClarissa. The sight that greeted her brought a gasp.Kahlan sprang up and put her hands against Nathan, stopping him. “It’s too late,Nathan. She’s with the spirits, now. Don’t look. Please don’t look. I saw in hereyes the love she had for you. Please don’t look at her like this. Remember herthe way she was.”Nathan nodded. “She had a good heart. She saved so many people. She had a goodheart.”Nathan lifted his arms. He held his palms out toward Clarissa’s body. Intenselight flared forth, flooding the dead woman with a brilliant blaze so radiantthat the body couldn’t be seen at its center.“From the light of this fire, and into the Light. Safe journey to the spiritworld,” Nathan whispered. When the light was gone, only ash remained. Nathanslumped. “The vultures can have the rest of them.” Verna tucked her dacra backup her sleeve. One soldier retrieved his sword from Amelia’s body as the othersheathed his.The young man looked in shock. “Nathan, I’m so sorry. I gave Jagang the meaningof prophecy that helped him. I didn’t want to, but he made me. I’m so sorry.”Nathan’s doleful, azure eyes turned toward the young man. “I understand. Warren.You didn’t do it out of malice; the dream walker was in your mind and you had nochoice. You are free of him now.” Nathan yanked the dacra from his leg. Heturned to Verna. “You brought traitors to me, Verna. You brought assassins tome. But I realize you had not intended it. Sometimes prophecy overwhelms ourattempts to outwit it, and catches us unaware. Sometimes we think we are moreclever than we are, and that we can stay the hand of fate, if we wish it hardenough.”Verna straightened her cloak on her shoulders. “I thought I was saving them fromJagang. I never had any idea that they would give the oath to you withoutcommitting their hearts.”“I understand,” Nathan whispered.“I don’t know what goes through that head of yours, Nathan. Lord Rahl indeed.”Verna glanced to where Clarissa’s body had been, and where now there was onlywhite ash. “And I see that you haven’t changed your ways, Nathan. Once again,you’ve gotten another of your little whores killed.”The impact of Nathan’s fist lifted Verna clear off the ground. Her jawboneshattered with a loud crack. Strings of blood sailed out into the night air.Warren cried out as Verna landed flat on her back. She didn’t move.Warren, crouched at Verna’s side, looked up with frantic eyes. “Nathan’ DearCreator, why would you do this? You’ve broken her jaw. Why would you try to killher?”Nathan flexed his fist. “If I was trying to kill her, she would be dead. If youwant her to live, then I would suggest you heal her. I’ve heard that you aretalented at healing, and with what I have done for you tonight, you should beable to accomplish it in short order. Put some sense in her head, while you’reat it.”Warren bent over Verna, pressing his hands to the unconscious woman’s face.Kahlan said nothing. She had seen love in Nathan’s eyes when he had looked atClarissa. She had just seen rage, too.Nathan bent and retrieved the inky black book lying on the ground beside SisterAmelia’s body. He straightened and turned those Rahl eyes on Kahlan. He held outthe book.“You could be none other than Kahlan. I have been expecting you. Prophecy, youknow. I’m glad I was not late. You don’t have much time. Give this to Lord Rahl.I hope he knows how to destroy it.”“He knew when he was at the Temple of the Winds, but he said he had to give uphis knowledge to leave. But he wrote a message in the palms of his hands. Itsays, ‘Pinch of white sorcerer’s sand on third page. One grain of blacksorcerer’s sand tossed on.’ And then there were three words, but I don’t knowwhat they mean.”Nathan laid a big hand on her shoulder. “The words are the three chimes:Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi. I don’t have time to teach you about the three chimes,but know that they must be spoken after the white and before the black. That’swhat is important.”“Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi,” Kahlan repeated, trying to commit the words tomemory. She said them over again in her head.“Richard does have both white and black sorcerer’s sand, does he not?” Kahlannodded. “Yes. He told me about it. He has both.” Nathan shook his head, as ifconsidering some private thought. “Both,” he muttered. Nathan squeezed hershoulder. “I know from prophecy some of what he has been through. Stand by him.Love is too precious a gift to lose.”Kahlan smiled. “I understand. May the good spirits bring it to your heart,Nathan. I can’t thank you enough for helping Richard, for helping me.” Her voicebroke. “I didn’t know what I was going to do. I only knew I had to come here.”Nathan hugged her, she thought more for his own need than hers. “You did theright thing. Maybe the good spirits guided you. Get back to him, now, or we willlose our Lord Rahl.” Kahlan nodded. “The killing is over.”“The killing is just about to begin.”Nathan turned and held both fists skyward. An awesome flare of light ignited athis fists and shot into the night sky. Kahlan watched as it streaked northwest,so bright that the stars vanished in the glare.Kahlan saw Verna sitting up, with Warren’s help. He was wiping the blood awayfrom her newly healed jaw. “What have you done?” Kahlan asked Nathan.He looked down at her a long moment, and then a sly smile spread on his lips. “Ihave just given Jagang a nasty surprise. I have just given General Reibisch thesignal to attack.”“Attack? Attack who?”“Jagang’s expeditionary force. They destroyed Renwold. They are up to othertrouble in the New World, too, but are unaware of who shadows them. It will be ashort battle. The prophecy says that the D’Harans will fight as fiercely as theyhave ever fought, and will, before this night is over, destroy the enemy in thetraditional D’Haran fashion: without mercy.”Verna was coming to her feet. Kahlan had never seen Verna looking so meek.“Nathan, I beg your forgiveness.”“I’m not interested-”Kahlan laid a hand on Nathan’s arm and whispered up at him. “Nathan, please, foryour own sake, listen to her.”Nathan gazed into Kahlan’s eyes a moment before he turned his glare on Verna.“I’m listening.”“Nathan, I’ve known you a long time. My whole life. I’ve seen things beforethat... perhaps I didn’t understand. I thought you were doing this to seizepower for yourself. Please forgive me for lashing out at you for my own guilt atmy friends turning against me-against us. I sometimes... jump to judgment. I cansee that I have mistaken what was truly going on with you and Clarissa. Sheadored you, and I thought-I beg you to forgive me, Nathan.”Nathan let out a grunt. “Knowing you, Verna, that must have been the hardestthing you have ever had to say. Forgiveness granted.”“Thank you, Nathan,” she sighed.Nathan bent and kissed Kahlan’s cheek. “May the good spirits be with you, MotherConfessor. Tell Richard I give him back his title. Maybe I will see him againsomeday.”With his hands on her waist, he boosted Kahlan up onto the sliph’s wall. “Thankyou, Nathan. I can see why Richard liked you. Clarissa, too. I think she saw thereal Nathan.”Nathan smiled, but then turned serious. “When you get back, you must offerRichard’s brother what he truly wants, if you are to save Richard.”“You wish to travel?” the sliph asked. Kahlan’s stomach roiled. “Yes, back toAydindril.”“Is Richard truly alive?” Verna asked.“Yes,” Kahlan said with revived panic. “He’s sick, but he will be fine once Iget this book back to him and it’s destroyed.”“Walsh, Bollesdun.” Nathan gestured as he started away. “My coach awaits. Let’sbe off.”“But, Nathan,” Warren said, “I want to learn about prophecy. I would like tostudy with you.”“A true prophet is born. Warren, not made.”“Where are you going?” Verna called after him. “You can’t leave. You’re aprophet. You can’t be left to run... I mean, we must know where you will be- incase we need you.”Without looking back, Nathan pointed. “Your Sisters are that way. Prelate. Tothe northwest. Go to them, and save yourself the trouble of trying to follow me.You won’t succeed. Your Sisters are safe from the dream walker; I had themtransfer their bond to me while Richard went to the world of the dead. IfRichard lives, you all can transfer it back to him. Good-bye, Verna. Warren.”Kahlan pressed a fist to her stomach. If he lives? If? “Hurry,” she said to thesliph. “Hurry!” A silver arm swept her from the wall and down into thequicksilver froth."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 66He smiled at the way she struggled. He liked the way she had fought him. Heenjoyed teaching her how useless it was to fight a person of his superiorstrength, superior intellect. He watched in fascination as blood ran from hermouth and nose. The gash on her jaw oozed.“You are only succeeding at making your wrists bleed,” he taunted. “You can’tbreak the ropes, but keep at it, if you wish.”She spat at him. He smacked her again. He dug his thumb across the cut on herjaw, spellbound by the pattern of blood flooding down the side of her neck.He knew her auras. He’d felt them before. He knew just which ones to touch tocripple her. It hadn’t taken long to overpower her. Not long at all.Her teeth gritted as she growled with effort, straining against the ropes. Shewas strong, but she was not strong enough. Without her power and her weapon, shewas a mere woman. No mere woman was a match for him. Not in any way.When his fingers began unbuttoning the row of buttons along the side of herribs, she tugged violently at the ropes holding her wrists and ankles. He likedthat. He like to watch her struggle. To watch her bleed. He punched her faceagain.He was intrigued that she didn’t cry out, that she didn’t beg for mercy. Thatshe didn’t scream. She would. Oh, how she would scream.His punch had stunned her for the moment. Her eyes rolled as she fought toremain conscious. He threw back the front of her outfit, exposing her breastsand the upper half of her torso.He hooked his fingers under the tight waist of her red leather pants and, with aquick pull, yanked them down enough for what he was going to do to her.Her entire belly was exposed. He felt it. Tight. Hard. There were scars on her.They riveted him. He tried to imagine what had caused such scars. As jagged andwhite as they were, it would have been bloody.“I’ve been raped before,” she sneered. “More times than I can remember. I cantell you from experience that you’re not very good at it. You haven’t evengotten my pants down enough, you stupid pig. Get on with it, if you even can.I’m waiting.”“Oh, Cara, I’m not going to rape you. That would be wrong. I have never raped awoman. I only have women who want it.” She laughed at him. Laughed. “You are onetwisted bastard.” He resisted his urge to smash her face. He wanted her awakefor this. Alive for this. But he shook with rage.“Bastard?” His fist tightened. “Because of women like you!” He hammered a fistdown on her breast. Her eyes squeezed shut and her teeth clenched as she wincedin pain, trying to curl up in a ball, but unable to, stretched out in the ropesas she was.He took a settling breath, regaining his control. He wouldn’t let her divert himwith her filthy mouth,“Now. I’m going to give you one last chance. Where is Richard? The soldiers aregoing wild with talk of Richard being back, of the bond being back. Where areyou whores hiding him?”The voices from the ether had told him, too. that Richard was back. The voiceshad told him that if he wished to assume his rightful place, he must eliminateRichard.“And where is my loving wife? Where has she gone to?” The voices told him thatshe was in the sliph, but the sliph wouldn’t tell him where she had gone.Cara spat at him again. “I am Mord-Sith. You are too stupid to even imagine whathas been done to me before. You couldn’t fill the boots of the meekest trainerof Mord-Sith. Your puny torture will pry nothing from me.”“Oh. Cara, you have never encountered one of my talents.”“Do what you want with me, Drefan, but Lord Rahl-the real Lord Rahl-is going tocut you up into little pieces.”“And just how would he be able to do that?” He lifted the hilt of the Sword ofTruth clear of its scabbard, so she could see the gold lettering that spelledout the word TRUTH. “I’m the one who is going to be doing the cutting intolittle pieces. Little tiny Richard pieces. Where is he!”When she spat at him again, he couldn’t resist fisting her across her cut andswollen lip. The blood gushed anew.He turned and retrieved one of the items he had brought: an iron pot. He put iton her belly, upside down.“I’m too big to cook in that pot, you stupid pig. You will have to cut me up. DoI have to explain everything to you?”He liked the way she tried to antagonize him, to make him lose his temper. Shewanted him to kill her. He would, but she would talk, first.“Cook you? Oh, no, Cara. You have the wrong idea. The wrong idea entirely. Youthink me some maniacal murderer. No murderer, l. I am the hand of justice. I amthe hand of mercy. Come to bring eternal virtue to those who have none. “Thispot isn’t to cook you. “It’s to cook the rats.”He was watching. He saw the way her blue eyes flicked toward him. He had beenwaiting for just that reaction.“Rats. I hope you aren’t stupid enough to think that I am afraid of rats justbecause I’m a woman. I’m no woman like you have ever seen before. I used to keeprats as pets.”“Really? You lie so poorly. My dear, loving, passionate wife explained to me howafraid you are of rats.”She didn’t answer. She was afraid of showing her fear. But he could see it inher eyes.“I have a sack of rats, here. Nice, fat rats.”“Just get on with this rape. I’m growing bored.”“I told you, I don’t rape women. They want it from me. They ask for it. They begfor it.” He tugged down his ruffled cuffs. “No, Cara. I have something else inmind for you. I want you to tell me where I can find my loving brother.”She turned her face away. “Never. Get on with the torture before I fall asleepand miss it.”“You see? As I told you, women always ask me for it.” He pressed the iron pot toher belly and wound a chain around her middle, to hold down the pot. He forced afinger under the rim, checking, to make sure that it was tight enough.He then loosened the rough knot in the chain, so he could get the rats under thepot. Cara showed no reaction when he shoved the first under the pot.Holding the second by the scruff of its neck, he held it before her face,letting her see it squirm and squeak. “See, Cara? As I promised you. Rats. Bigrats.”Sweat beaded on her forehead. “I kind of like it. It feels fuzzy against mystomach. I may fall asleep.”He stuffed the second, and then a third under the pot. There was room for nomore. He took the slack from the chain, and tightened the knot of links.“Fuzzy,” he mocked. “I think they will keep you wide awake, Cara. Wide awake,and eager to talk, eager to betray Richard. Whores have no honor. You willbetray him.”“Berdine is going to be here soon. She will skin you alive.” He lifted aneyebrow. “You relieved Berdine. I saw you. After she left, I took you down. Shewon’t be back for quite a while, but when she does come back, she will get thesame as you.”With tongs, he retrieved a big, glowing coal from the pan over the mass ofcandles. He plunked the red-hot coal down inside the rim of the footed bottom ofthe iron pot.“You see, Cara, the coals are going to heat this iron pot-get it very hot.” Helooked at her eyes. “The rats aren’t going to like that. They are going to wantout.”Her breathing quickened. Sweat rolled down her face. Where were her brave wordsnow? She was silent, now.“And how do you suppose the rats are going to get out, Cara? Once they start toget hot? Once the iron pot starts burning them? Singeing their tender noses?”“Just cut my throat and kill me, you bastard.”“When the rats get hot enough under there, they’ll panic. They’ll be frantic toget out. Guess how they’ll get out, Cara.” She had no haughty answer to fill thesilence.He pulled his knife and with the handle, tapped the iron pot. “How are you doingin there, my little rat friends?”Cara flinched. He smiled when her eyes turned to him, watching him. He could seefear in those eyes. Real fear. He plunked down a half dozen more glowing coalson the iron pot. “Where is Richard?”She had nothing to say. He piled on more coals, into a nice, round hump. Thatwas all the pot’s bottom would hold.He bent over and looked into her eyes. Her skin was as white as chalk. Sweatglistened on her face, on her breasts. “Where are you whores hiding Richard?”“You are crazy, Drefan. I don’t like this, but if this is how I am to die, thenI will die. But I will never betray Lord Rahl.”“I am Lord Rahl! When I get rid of my brother, there will be no one to challengemy rule! I am the son of Darken Rahl, and the rightful master of D’Hara.”She turned her face away. He saw her swallow. Her feet were trembling. Hersmooth breathing was interrupted now and again, caught up short. He chuckled.“I’ll ask again, when the rats start gnawing their way through you, to get awayfrom their hot, iron prison. When their sharp little claws start digging intoyour belly. When the rats start tunnelling into your guts, trying to get out.”Cara’s whole body jerked. It jerked again. Her eyes widened as she stared up atthe ceiling, trying to keep the moan from escaping her throat. He glanced backand saw a drop of blood run from under the rim of the bowl, down her side.“Well, looks like they already want out. Ready to talk, yet?”She spat at him, and then gasped sharply. Her wide blue eyes fixed on theceiling.She was trembling all over now. Her whole body stiffed. Every muscle strained.She started to pant. Tears filled the corners of her eyes, to run down the sideof her face. She was feeling every little thing the rats did-every frantic bite,every desperate digging, ripping of their claws.Cara let out a short little cry. Sharp, shrill, clipped. It was rapture. He knewit was only the beginning. Even if she talked, he had no intention of stoppingthis. He longed to hear screams. Real, from the gut screams. Cara obliged him,and let out her first.Because of his singular perception, another detail caught his attention. Hisvigilance had again rewarded him. Smiling, he turned to the sliph’s well.Breathe.Kahlan expelled the sliph, but she knew something was wrong even before shesucked a breath of air.A piercing scream echoed around the stone room. Kahlan thought the shriek wouldmake her ears bleed.As she erupted from the sliph, before she could brace herself to react, big,strong hands reached down and seized her. She struggled to get her bearings, tomake sense of what was happening as the sudden light and sound whirled in aroundher.The hands tore the book from her grasp. An arm clamped around her neck, its bigfist gripping her arm. She felt rope being wound around her wrist.A nightmare came to life in her vision as she was dragged from the well, kickingand twisting and trying to get away. She went limp when a fist in her gut drovethe wind from her lungs. Her knees smacked the stone floor. Her arms felt as ifthey were being wrenched from her shoulder sockets as they were twisted behindher back.She fought to reach her Confessor’s power-only to remember when she couldn’ttouch it that the spirits had walled it from her so she could be married toDrefan. She was defenseless. It was Drefan attacking her.Cara was there, on the floor, her wrists bound above her head, the rope fastenedto a pin in the wall. Her ankles, likewise secured with rope. were stretchedtoward the opposite wall. She had an iron pot chained over her middle. The smellof hot coals and burning flesh assailed Kahlan’s nostrils, gagging her.Drefan pressed his knee to her arm as he knotted rope around her wrists. Kahlantried to bite his leg. He backhanded her across the face so hard that her visionnarrowed to a tiny spot. She fought to keep that vision, to stay conscious. Sheknew that she was lost if she passed out.Her arms bound behind her, unable to break her fall, she smacked into the stonefloor face-first. Drefan pounced on her back, sitting on her, holding her down,as he bound her legs together. Kahlan struggled to pull a breath against theweight of him. Blood gushed from her nose. The rope around her wrists was sotight that already her fingers were tingling.Cara screamed. It was the loudest scream Kahlan had ever heard. It sent icyneedles stabbing into her head. It made her face hurt.Blood was running from under the rim of the iron pot. Cara shook and thrashed.She stiffened and screamed again.Drefan lifted Kahlan’s head by her hair. “Where’s Richard?”“Richard? Richard is dead.”Kahlan grunted at a punch in her kidney. She couldn’t get her breath. Drefanturned his attention to Cara.“Ready to talk yet? Where did you hide Richard?”Cara’s only answer was another shuddering scream. When it ended, she panted inpain.“Why did you tell him?” Cara wept. “Why did you tell him about... the rats? Dearspirits, why did you tell him about the rats?” Terror locked Kahlan’s breath inher lungs.Blood, vivid red against white skin, ran in rivulets from under the pot’s rim,and down Cara’s side. Smoke curled up from the hot coals atop it. And thenKahlan saw the bloody claw wriggling from under the rim of the pot on Cara’sstomach. Kahlan suddenly understood. It took all her force of will to keep fromvomiting. Cara cried hysterically, thrashing at the bloody ropes holding her.Kahlan furiously squirmed forward, going for the chain, to try to undo it withher teeth-to try to get the iron pot off Cara. Drefan lifted Kahlan by her hair.“Your turn will come, wife.”He heaved her back. Kahlan smacked into the wall and slid down onto somethinghard and sharp. The pain brought stinging tears to her eyes. It was Nadine’sbag, full of all those horn containers. She lurched and wrenched herself untilshe was able to slip to the side, off the bag, and get her breath back.Drefan turned his Darken Rahl eyes on her. “If you tell me where Richard is,I’ll let Cara go.”“Don’t tell him!” Cara screamed. “Don’t tell him!”“I couldn’t if I wanted to,” Kahlan called out to Cara. “I don’t know where youhid him.”Drefan picked up the book Kahlan had brought. “What’s this?” Kahlan’s gazelocked on the sinister black book. She had to have that book, or Richard woulddie.“Well, no matter, you won’t be needing it anymore.”“No!” Kahlan screamed when she saw what Drefan was going to do with the book.“Please!”He looked back at her as he held the book out over the sliph’s well. “Tell mewhere Richard is.” He smiled, lifting an eyebrow. “No?”He dropped the book down the well. Kahlan’s heart sank with the book. The sliph,who liked to watch the people in the room, was nowhere to be seen now. Sheprobably had been frightened away by the screams.“Drefan, let Cara go. Please. You have me. Do what you want to with me, butplease let her go.”Drefan smiled as wicked a smile as Kahlan had ever seen. It was a twin to DarkenRahl’s smile. “Oh, don’t you worry, I intend to do what I want with you. When itis time.”He turned back to Cara. “How are the rats doing. Cara? Ready to talk yet?” Caracursed him through clenched teeth.Drefan reached into a sack and brought out a rat, holding it by the scruff ofits neck. He shook it in her face as she tried to turn away. He lowered itagainst her. Squeaking and twisting, its claws scratched and dug as it tried toget away from Drefan’s grip, leaving red streaks along Cara’s cheeks, chin, andlips. “Please,” Cara wailed. “Please, get them away!”“Where’s Richard?”“Dear spirits, help me. Please help me. Please help me,” she mumbled over andover. “Where’s Richard?”Cara’s body jerked violently. “Mama!” She shrieked. “Help me! Mama! Get themoff! Mamaaaaa!”Cara was alone in a cage with rats, in the grip of terror and pain. She was ahelpless child again, begging for the comfort and protection of her mother,wailing for her mother.Kahlan gasped in tears. This was her fault. She had told Drefan that Cara wasafraid of rats. “Cara, forgive me! I didn’t know!”Cara thrashed at her ropes, a little girl, frantically begging for her mother toget the rats away.Kahlan strained to pull a hand free. If she could only get a hand free of theropes. But they were so tight. She tugged and pulled. Her fingers tingled. Thecoarse rope cut into her wrists.Kahlan pressed her wrists against Nadine’s bag, searching for something sharp tocut the ropes. The bag was cloth, the handle smooth wood.The bag. Kahlan bent to the side, her fingers feeling for the button that heldthe bag closed. She found it. She struggled to undo the button, but her fingerswere numb and at the angle that her arms were twisted, she couldn’t make herfingers work properly. She dug at the button with her thumbnail, trying to hookit to the side, trying to rip it off. It was sewn on with heavy thread to standup to the rigors of use and weight. At last, the button popped through its hole.Kahlan scooped at the contents in the bag, trying to sling them out where shecould see them. Every shrill wail from Cara made Kahlan flinch. Every time Caracried for her mother to save her from the rats, Kahlan had to hold back a sob ofher own.When she glanced up, she saw Drefan wiping a rat across Cara’s face. He hadbroken the back of another and draped it across her throat. Kahlan gritted herteeth and fingered the horn containers out of the bag.Cara was her sister of the Agiel. Kahlan had to do something. Cara’s only hopewas Kahlan. She twisted her neck, trying to see the markings on the horns. Shecouldn’t find the one she wanted.She used her fingers, groping at the symbols scratched into the horn. She feltone that she thought was the right one, and her hopes soared, only to be dashedwhen she felt that there were three circles. She flicked each horn out of theway when she determined that it was not the one she needed.She rooted in the bag and found another. Her fingers blindly felt the scratches.They went in a circle. She slipped her fingers along the horn and found anothercircle. She felt a heavily scratched straight line between them.Kahlan held the horn in her fingertips and twisted, trying to see if she wasright. Cara screamed and Kahlan dropped the horn. She scooted to the side so shecould see it on the floor.It had two circles scratched into the patina of the horn. A horizontal line ranthrough both circles. It was the right one: canin pepper.Nadine had warned her about taking off the wooden stopper, warned her aboutgetting it in your face, your eyes. It would immobilize a person for a time,Nadine had said. Make them helpless, for a time.Kahlan worked the horn back into her fingers. She wiggled the wooden stopper,trying to loosen it. It was cut to fit tightly, to keep the dangerous substancefrom leaking out.Kahlan’s fingers were so numb they had no strength. She gritted her teeth as shetried to work the stopper loose. She didn’t want it off, yet, but she had toknow she could get it off.With her hands behind her back, she couldn’t throw it. She frantically tried tothink of what she was going to do. She had to do something. If she didn’t, Carawould soon be dead. And then Drefan would start in on his loving wife. Carawailed in agony.“Please, mama, get the rats away from Cari. Please, mama, please. Help me,please help me.”The pleading cries of hopeless terror ripped at Kahlan’s heart. She could waitno longer. She would just have to figure out what to do when the time came. Shehad to act. “Drefan!”His head twisted around. “Are you ready to tell me where Richard is?” Kahlanremembered something Nathan had told her. You must offer Richard’s brother whathe truly wants, if you are to save Richard. Maybe it would save Cara. “Richard?What would I want with Richard? You know that it’s you I want.” He smiled aknowing, satisfied smile. “Soon, my dear. In a little while. You can wait.” Heturned back to Cara.“No, Drefan! I can’t wait. I need you now. I want you now. I can’t resist anylonger. I can’t pretend any longer. I need you.”“I said-”“Just like your mother.” He froze at her words. “I need you like your whore of amother needed your father.”His expression darkened. Like a provoked bull, he turned toward her, hispiercing eyes riveted on her. “What do you mean?”“You know exactly what I mean. I need to be taken, like your father took yourmother. I want you to take me like that. Only you can satisfy me. Do it. Do itnow. Please.”He rose up, huge and imposing. His muscles rippled and knotted. His brow drewdown in that grim Rahl glare.“I knew it,” he breathed. “I knew it. I knew you would finally give in to yourfilthy perversion.” He hesitated, looking back at Cara.“Yes. You’re right. You’re always right, Drefan. You’re smarter than me. Youwere right all along. I can’t fool you any longer. Give me what I want. Give mewhat I need. Please, Drefan, I’m begging you. I need you.” The look on his facewas frightening. It was madness. If she could have shrunk back into the stone,she would have.Drefan slipped free the knife at his belt as his tongue wet his lips. He startedtoward her.She had had no idea just how effective her words had been. In sudden panic,Kahlan wiggled the wooden stopper. Drefan’s whole face, the whole way he carriedhis body, changed. He was a seething monster coming at her. His eyes narrowedwith bestial loathing, savage hatred. Hatred for her.Kahlan swallowed back the sudden terror welling up in her throat. Dear spirits,what had she just done? She scuffed her feet against the stone floor, trying toback away. She was already against the wall. How was she going to get the powderin his face? Dear spirits, what do I do?Kahlan wiggled the stopper with all her might. It popped off. Drefan went to aknee beside her.“Tell me how much you want me to please you.”“Yes! I want you. Now. Give me the pleasure only you can give me.” He broughtthe knife up as he leaned toward her.Kahlan heaved herself toward him, twisting, rolling to the side as hard as shecould, flinging the horn full of powder at his face as she rolled onto hers.She couldn’t see, facedown on the stone. She didn’t know if she had missed, ifthe oily powder had come out, if she had the horn turned the right way, if hewas close enough. She held her breath, bracing for the thrust of his knife,imagining it coming, knowing it was coming. She could almost feel the sharp edgeslicing her. She struggled against the panic of not knowing just where he wasgoing to cut her.Drefan staggered back. She turned her face and saw him fall on his back,writhing, gasping for breath.Kahlan flipped herself over and started scooting toward Cara. She tried to movearound Drefan, but she didn’t have much room to manoeuvre. His groping handcaught her ankles. She kicked, trying to pull away from his grip.His fingers tightened around her ankles. His powerful arm dragged her towardhim. He gasped for air, his other hand flailing about, trying to feel what wasaround him. He was blind.Kahlan saw yellow powder on his cheek and neck. She hadn’t gotten it in his eyesas she had hoped. She hadn’t gotten it directly in his mouth, or nose. Just theside of his face. Most had missed. She didn’t know how long that would stop him,but she didn’t think for long. Dear spirits, let it be enough.The horn was on the other side of him. She couldn’t get to it. With all herstrength, when he tugged on her leg, she used his pull to add momentum andkicked as hard as she could at his face. She caught his ear, tearing it partlyaway from his head. He bellowed and released her ankle.Desperately, Kahlan pushed with her feet, to get away from his grasping fingers.She made it out of his reach. She bumped into Cara. Kahlan sat up and scootedback toward the woman.“Hold on, Cara. Please hold on. I’m here. I’m going to get them off you. I swearI’ll get them off you.”“Please, mama,” Cara wailed, “It hurts so much... It hurts. It hurts.” Kahlanpulled her feet under herself so she could raise up enough. She craned her neck,looking over her shoulder, trying to see what she was doing. She seized thechain. It burned her fingers, making her recoil. She made herself grab the chainagain. She tugged on the iron knot, shaking, twisting, pulling.Through burning fingers, she felt a link slip and the chain loosen. She stole aquick glance. Drefan was still struggling to breathe, but he had straightenedhis legs. He put his arms at his sides. What was he doing?Kahlan felt a link pull past resistance. She wiggled the chain to loosen theknot, to give it more room to come undone. Another link slipped free. The chainloosened further. She tugged at it, refusing to let go, even though the hot ironwas burning her fingers.Drefan’s breathing was evening out. He was laying perfectly still. What was hedoing?Kahlan cried out with joy when the chain rattled off the side of the pot. Withher back to Cara, Kahlan hooked her fingers under the rim of the scalding potand heaved it up and back, flipping it off Cara.Bloody rats tumbled to the floor, squirming and wriggling, trying to get theirfeet as they scurried away.Kahlan was near tears with joy. “I got them off, Cara. I got them off you.”Cara’s head lolled from side to side. Her eyes rolled. She mumbled incoherently.When she looked over her shoulder and saw Cara’s stomach, Kahlan had to lookaway, or be sick.She scooted up toward Cara’s hands. With frenzied effort, Kahlan dug at the knotof rope, but the knots were pulled impossibly tight from Cara’s thrashing.Kahlan couldn’t budge them. She wasn’t going to be able to untie them. She wouldhave to cut them.Drefan’s knife lay on the floor, near him. He was lying there, perfectly still.She had to hurry. She had to get the knife and cut Cara’s ropes. She had to cuther own. Before he recovered.Kahlan dug in her heels and scooted toward the knife. She turned around, feelingfor it with her fingers.Drefan rose up and seized her. Holding her around the middle, he lifted her asif she weighed nothing. He brought the knife around in front of her face.“Nasty stuff, powdered canin pepper. Lucky for me I know how to use my auras toovercome it. Now, my whore of a wife, it’s time you paid the price for yourperversion.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 67Richard staggered toward the sliph’s room. From a room not far away, where Caraand Berdine had put him, he had heard the screams. He had no idea how long hehad been insensate, no idea how long it had been since they had taken him there,but the screams had brought him awake. Someone needed help. And the last scream,he knew-Kahlan. His head pounded in violent pain. He hurt everywhere. He hadn’tthought he would be able to stand, but he did. He hadn’t thought he would beable walk, but he did. He had to.He was barefooted, and without a shirt. He had on only his pants. He knew thatthe lower Keep was cool, but he was covered in a sheen of sweat, hardly able tobreathe through the heat he felt. He used all his willpower to force himself tomove.He straightened, put a hand to the side of the door into the sliph’s room, andwalked in.Drefan looked up. He had his arm around Kahlan’s middle. He had a knife in hisother hand. To the side, Cara was lying on the floor, tied in ropes. Her middlewas ripped open. She was still alive, but shivering in agony. Richard couldn’tmake sense of it.“What in the name of all that’s good is going on, Drefan?”“Richard,” he sneered. “Just the man I’m looking for.”“Well, now I’m here. Let Kahlan go.”“Oh, I will, dear brother. Soon. It is you I need.”“Why?”Drefan’s eyebrows lifted. “So that I can be reinstated as Lord Rahl. It’s myrightful place. The voices told me. My father told me. I am to be Lord Rahl. Iwas born to it.”The plague was a far distant drone in Richard’s mind and body, yet this allseemed a dream, too. “Drop the knife, Drefan, and give up. It’s over. Let Kahlango”Drefan laughed. He threw his head back and roared with laughter. When it diedout, Drefan’s eyes narrowed with frightening resolve.“She wants me. She begs for it. You know the truth of that, my dear brother. Yousaw what she is. She is a whore. She is just like all the others. Just likeNadine. Just like my mother. She must die, like all the rest.”Richard looked into Kahlan’s eyes. What was going on? Dear spirits, how was hegoing to get her away from Drefan?“You’re wrong, Drefan. Your mother loved you: she took you to a place where youwould be safe from Darken Rahl. She loved you. Please, let Kahlan go. I’mbegging you.”“She is mine! My wife! I will do with her what I will!” Drefan slammed the knifeinto Kahlan’s lower back. Richard flinched at hearing it hit bone. Kahlangrunted with the impact, her eyes going wide in shock. Drefan released her. Shedropped to her knees and crumpled to her side.Richard tried with all his might to make sense of this. He couldn’t decide ifthis was real, or a dream. He had been having so many dreams, so manynightmares. This seemed like all the rest, but different. He didn’t even know ifhe was alive anymore. The whole room swam before him.Drefan drew the Sword of Truth. The ring of steel that Richard knew so wellechoed around the stone room, a chime that seemed to awaken him into anightmare. Richard could see the rage from the sword, the magic, take Drefan’seyes.“I’m all right, Richard,” Kahlan panted as she stared up at him. “You don’t havea weapon. Get out of here. Get away. I love you. Please, for me. Run.”The rage in Drefan’s eyes was nothing to match the rage thundering intoRichard’s heart.“Drop the sword, Drefan, now. Or I will kill you.” Drefan swept the swordaround. “How? With your bare hands?” Richard vividly remembered what Zedd hadtold him when first giving him the Sword of Truth: the sword was only a tool;the Seeker was the weapon. A true Seeker didn’t need the sword.Richard started forward. “And with hate in my heart.”“I will enjoy killing you, at last, Richard. Even if you don’t have a weapon.”“I am the weapon.”Richard was running. The distance between them shrank at an alarming rate.Kahlan screamed for him to get away. He hardly heard her. Richard was committed.Drefan lifted the sword overhead, pulling a breath in preparation to cleaveRichard. That was the opening. Richard knew that a thrust was faster than a cut.He was in the iron grip of deadly determination. Richard was lost in the dancewith death. Drefan bellowed in rage as the sword started down.Richard dropped to his left knee, through the opening, using his forwardmomentum and a twist of his torso to add force to his strike. Fingers straightand stiff, he drove his arm ahead with all his might.Before the sword could touch him, Richard struck like lightning, driving hishand through Drefan’s soft middle. In the blink of an eye, he had seizedDrefan’s spinal column and yanked it back out, ripping it apart.Drefan pitched backward, crashing against the sliph’s well, slumping down in aspreading, crimson flood.Richard bent to Kahlan, cupping her face with his left hand. He didn’t want totouch her with Drefan’s blood. She was panting in pain. From the corner of hiseye, Richard could see Drefan’s arm move.“I can’t feel my legs. Richard, I can’t feel my legs. Dear spirits, what did hedo to me?” Her voice quivered with panic. “I can’t make them move.”Richard was already lost in need. He had forgotten how to use his power as theprice of returning from the Temple of the Winds, but he had used it before. Hehad healed before. He was a wizard.He ignored his dizzy head, his sick stomach; he couldn’t allow that to stop him.From Nathan, Richard had learned that his power was called through need, if theneed was great enough, or through anger, if the anger was great enough. He hadnever had more need than he had at that moment, nor more anger. “Richard. Oh,Richard, I love you. I want you to know. if we. if we...”“Hush,” he said in agentle voice. Her face was cut and bloody. It made him ache to see her pain, herpanic. “I will heal you. Lie still, and I will make you whole again.”“Oh, Richard, I had the book. I lost it. Oh. Richard, I’m so sorry. I had it. Ihad it, but it’s gone.”With a sinking feeling, he grasped what she was saying: lie was going to die.There was nothing to be done. now. He was lost. “Richard, please, heal Cara.”“No. I don’t think I have enough strength to heal both of you.” To heal, he hadto take the pain from the one injured. Killing Drefan had taken nearly all thestrength he had. “I must heal you.”Kahlan shook her head. “Please. Richard, if you love me, do as I ask. Heal Cara.It’s my fault-what he did to her. My fault.” A tear ran down her cheek. “I lostthe book. I can’t save you. Heal Cara.” She stifled a cry. “We will be togethersoon, for all time, then.”He understood. They were both to die. They would be together in the spiritworld. She didn’t want to live without him.Richard kissed her brow. “Hold on. Don’t give up. Please. Kahlan, I love you.Don’t give up.”Richard turned to Cara. He already felt so sick that the sight didn’t affect himthe way it normally would have. Her suffering, though, bent him with pain forher. He laid his hands across Cara’s bloody, torn middle. “Cara, I’m here. Holdon. For me, hold on, so I can help you.” She didn’t seem to hear his words asshe mumbled, her head lolling from side to side.Richard closed his eyes and opened his heart, his need, his soul. He releasedhimself into the current of empathy. He wanted nothing but to make Cara wholeagain. She had given her all for them. He didn’t know if he had strength enough,but he gave all of himself over to it.He descended into the swirl of her agony. He felt everything she felt, sufferedwith her. He gritted his teeth, held his breath, and pulled her pain intohimself. onward, ever onward, without sparing anything to protect himself.He shook with the suffering, and his mind wailed with it. He absorbed it intohimself, and then asked for more. He asked for all of it. He demanded it.The world was liquid, twisting, coursing pain. He was swept away in a moltenriver of it. Its fiery heat consumed his being. Time lost all meaning. There wasonly the pain.When he felt it all gathered into himself, he let flow his empathy, his power:healing strength: healing heart.He didn’t know how to direct it, he just let it flow into her. It felt as if hiswhole self drained away into her need. She was baked, barren earth, soaking inlife-giving rain.When at last he opened his eyes and lifted his head. his arms were lying acrossthe smooth skin of her midriff. She was whole again. Though she seemed stillunaware of it, she was whole.Richard turned. Kahlan was lying on her side, her breath coming in short, sharppants. Her face was ashen and covered with sweat and blood, her eyes halfclosed.“Richard,” she whispered when he bent to her, “free my hands. I want to behugging you, when...”When she died. That was what she was going to say.Richard snatched up a knife lying nearby, and sliced through the ropes. Theanger was back, but only as a distant glow now. He could hardly see the roomanymore. Hardly hear her. Hardly see her.Her wrists finally free, she threw an arm over his neck and drew him to her.Richard struggled to keep from falling on her. “Richard, Richard, Richard,” shewhispered. “I love you.” Richard went to embrace her, and saw the pool of bloodspreading under her. His rage ignited anew. His need ignited anew. He took herup in his arms, begging the spirits to spare her. “Please give me the strengthto heal this loved one,” he whispered in choking tears. “I have done everythingrequired of me. I have sacrificed everything. Please, losing this loved oneshould not be part of it. I’m dying. Give me the time. Help me.”It was all he wanted, all he needed, as he held her to him. He wanted her tolive, to be well, to be whole.Holding her in his arms, he once again released himself into the torrent. Hepulled the pain onward, heedless of it, welcoming it, drawing it with all hismight. At the same time, he let flow his love, his warmth, his compassion.Kahlan gasped.Richard could see that his arms were glowing, as if a spirit were sharing hisbody with him. Perhaps, he was already a spirit, but he didn’t care. He caredonly that he would heal her, and cared not at what cost. He would pay any price.Kahlan gasped with the feel of it, the feel of the power surging into her. Herlegs began to tingle. It was the first time she had felt anything in them sinceDrefan had stabbed her.Richard seemed to glow around her as he hugged her in his arms, held her in hiswarm, loving embrace.The rapture of the sliph, by comparison, was torture. This was beyond anythingshe had ever felt in her life. She could feel his warm, healing magic coursingthrough every fibre of her.It was like being born anew. Life and vitality welled up in her. Tears of blissflooded from her eyes as she hung in Richard’s arms, his magic completelyoverwhelming her.When at last he parted from her, she moved without pain. Her legs moved. Shefelt whole. She was healed.Richard wiped the blood from her lips as he gazed into her eyes. Kneeling on thefloor together, Kahlan kissed him, tasting their salty tears. She parted,gripping his arms, looking into his eyes, seeing him as if in a new light. Shehad just shared something with him that was beyond words, beyond comprehension.Kahlan stood, holding out her hand to help him up. Richard lifted his handtoward hers.And then he toppled over onto his face. “Richard!” She dropped down, rolling himover onto his back. He was hardly breathing. “‘Richard. Please, Richard, don’tleave me. Please don’t leave me!”She clutched at his shoulders. He was burning with fever. His eyes were closed.He struggled for each shallow breath.“Oh, Richard, I’m so sorry. I lost the book. Please, Richard, I love you. Don’tdie and leave me alone.”“Here,” came a voice that echoed around the room.Kahlan’s head came up. The voice seemed unreal. She couldn’t understand it. Thenrealization hit her.Kahlan spun around and saw the quicksilver face of the sliph looking down ather. A liquid silver arm held out the black book. “Master needs this,” the sliphsaid. “Take it.” Kahlan snatched the book. “Thank you! Thank you, sliph!” Kahlandropped down to get the sorcerer’s sand that Richard carried in the leatherpacks, but he wasn’t wearing his big over-belt.She rushed to Cara, still tied in the ropes. Cara’s head rolled from side toside as she mumbled, as if she didn’t know that Richard had healed her. She wasstill lost in a prison of her own private terror.Zedd had told Kahlan that the gift couldn’t heal maladies of the mind. “Cara!Cara, where were you keeping Richard? Where are his things?” Cara didn’trespond. Kahlan snatched the knife off the floor and sliced through the ropes.Cara just lay there.Kahlan pressed her hands to Cara’s face, making the woman look at her. “Cara,it’s all right, now. The rats are gone. They’re gone. You’re safe. Richardhealed you. You’re all right.”“Rats,” Cara mumbled. “Get them off me. Please. Please...” Kahlan hugged her.“Cara, they’re gone. I’m your sister of the Agiel. I need you. Please, Cara,come back to me. Please.” Cara only mumbled.“Cara,” Kahlan wept, “Richard will die if you don’t help me. There are thousandsof rooms in the Keep. I need to know where you kept him. Please, Cara, Richardhelped you. Now he needs your help-or he will die. There’s no time. Richardneeds you.”Cara’s eyes focused, as if she were coming awake. “Richard?” Kahlan wiped thetears from her face. “Yes, Richard. Hurry, Cara. I need the belt Richard wears.I need it or he will die.”Cara brought her hands down, rubbing her wrists, now smooth where they had beencut before. She felt her stomach. Even the old scars were gone. “I am healed,”she whispered. “Lord Rahl healed me.”“Yes! Cara, please, Richard is dying. I have the book, but I need the things hekeeps in his belt.”Cara abruptly sat up, pulling the red leather across her chest. She buttoned twoof the buttons to hold it closed.“His belt. Yes. You stay with Lord Rahl. I will get it.”“Hurry!”Cara stood, swaying for a moment as she steadied herself, and then she dashedfrom the room. Kahlan hugged the inky black book to herself. She bent overRichard.He was hardly breathing. She knew that any one of those breaths could be hislast. He had given them, Cara and Kahlan, the rest of his strength.“Dear spirits, help him. Give him just a little more time. Please. He hassuffered so much. Please just give him a little time, until I can destroy thisvile book.”Kahlan bent over him and kissed his lips. “Hold on, Richard. Hold on for me,please. If you can hear me, we have the book. I know how to destroy it. Please,just hold on.”Kahlan knelt down on a clear spot closer to the door and laid open the book tothe third page so she would be ready when Cara returned.She gazed into a vision of a wasteland. There was sand, blown into dunes,stretching into the distance of the phantasm emanating from the book. Kahlanstared into that barren place, and saw runes on the sand-lines drawn ingeometric patterns.Her sight was drawn into the pattern of lines that swirled and twisted around.There, in the runes, was light. It flared forth, every color, shining out towardher, calling to her.“Mother Confessor!” Cara yelled, shaking Kahlan’s shoulders. “Didn’t you hearme? I have Lord Rahl’s belt.”Kahlan blinked, shaking her head, trying to clear her mind. She snatched thebelt and undid the bone holder on the flap of the pack where Richard kept thesorcerer’s sand. Inside, she found the leather pouch of white sand.With Cara standing behind her, touching her shoulder, Kahlan cast a pinch of thewhite sand into the book.The color boiled and twisted, tumbled and turned. Kahlan pulled her eyes awayand stabbed her hand back into the pack, pulling out the other leather pouch,the one with the black sorcerer’s sand. With two fingers, she carefully pulledthe top open. Inside, she could see the inky black sand.Troubled, Kahlan paused. There was something else, something tickling at theback of her mind.The words. Nathan said to say the words, the three chimes, before using theblack sand. Three words. What were they?She couldn’t remember them. Her mind raced after them, but they kept goingaround dark corners, and when she turned, they were gone again. Her thoughtsmired in staggering fright. She ached in desperate thought, but the wordswouldn’t come to her.Richard had them written in the palm of his hand. Kahlan turned, to go to readthem from his palm, and froze.Drefan, leaning up against the well of the sliph where he had fallen, somehowstill hanging to a thread of life, was holding up the sword. Richard was lyingright there, on the floor, within reach. Drefan was going to kill him. “No!”Kahlan screamed.But the sword was already sweeping down. Faint, maniacal laughter drifted on theair.Kahlan threw her fist up, calling the blue lightning to protect Richard. Itdidn’t come. She was blocked from her power.Cara was already diving toward Drefan, but she was too far away. She wasn’tgoing to make it. The sword was halfway there.A silver arm swept down and seized Drefan’s arm, holding it tight. Kahlan heldher breath. Another liquid silver arm enveloped Drefan’s head. “Breathe,” thesliph cooed, a voice promising the sating of bestial lust, a voice promisingrapture. “I wish you to please me. Breathe.”Drefan’s chest rose as he inhaled the sliph. He went still, holding the sliph inhis lungs. The sliph freed him, and he slumped to the side. His breath left him,releasing the sliph he had inhaled. It drained from his mouth and nose, notsilver, but red.Kahlan felt something inside her part, a profound unravelling, and all at once,she joined with her power, a sweet reclaiming that brought a gasp of euphoric,inner union.Drefan was dead. As long as they both live. Those were the words. Her oath wasended. The winds had returned her power. Kahlan was brought out of her daze whenshe heard Richard gasp for a breath. With renewed panic, she scrambled acrossthe floor and scooped up his right hand, where Richard had written the message.She pried open his fingers.The words were gone. The act of stopping Drefan, and his blood, had scoured awaythe writing.Kahlan screamed in frustrated rage. She scrambled back to the open book. Shecouldn’t remember the words. Her mind ached with frustration; she couldn’t makethe words come. What was she going to do?Maybe if she just threw in the grain of black sand anyway. No, she knew betterthan to disregard what a wizard like Nathan said to do. She squeezed her headbetween the heels of her hands, as if trying to press the words out. Cara kneltdown, grasping her by her shoulders.“Mother Confessor, what’s wrong? You must hurry. Lord Rahl is hardly breathing.Hurry!”Tears ran down her face. “I can’t remember the words. Oh, Cara, I can’t rememberthem. Nathan told me, but I can’t remember them.”Kahlan clambered back across the floor to Richard. She smoothed a hand down hisface.“Richard, please, wake up. I need to know the words. Please, Richard, what arethe words? The three words?”He struggled to draw a breath, gasping with the effort. He wasn’t going to wake.He wasn’t going to live.Kahlan rushed back to the book. She snatched up the leather pouch of black sand.She would have to do it without the words. Maybe it would work. It would work.It had to work.She couldn’t make her hands move. She knew better. It wouldn’t work unless shesaid the words. She knew it wouldn’t. She had grown up around wizards and magic;she knew better than to disregard what Nathan had told her. Without the words,it wouldn’t work.She fell forward with a wail, beating her fists against the stone floor. “Ican’t remember the words! I can’t!”Cara put an arm around Kahlan, making her sit up, holding her in a gentleembrace. “Calm down. Take a breath. Good. Let it go. Take another. Now, picturein your mind this man Nathan. Picture him telling you the words, and how happyyou were that you could save Richard’s life.” Kahlan tried. She tried so hardshe wanted to scream.“I can’t remember them,” she wept. “Richard’s going to die because I can’tremember three stupid words. I can’t remember the three chimes.”‘The three chimes?” Cara asked. “You mean, Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi? Those threechimes?”Kahlan stared in disbelief. “That’s them. The three chimes. Reechani, Sentrosi,Vasi.“Reechani? Sentrosi! Vasi! I remember! Thank you, Cara, I remember!” Kahlanpulled out a grain of black sorcerer’s sand between her thumb and finger.“Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi.” she said again, for good measure. She tossed thegrain of black sand into the book. She and Cara both held their breath.A hum slowly built in the room. The air seemed to dance and vibrate. Light ofevery color flared forth, twisting and tumbling, pulsing and throbbing. It grewwith the hum, until Kahlan had to turn her eyes away.Rays of light swept across the stone walls. Cara put a hand up before her face.Kahlan did the same, so bright was the light that just turning away was notenough.And then darkness began gathering, like the inky black of a night stone, or ofthe book’s cover itself, pulling the light and color back into the book. It drewall the light from the room, until all fell into darkness.In that depth of sightless obscurity, there came such terrible moans that Kahlanwas thankful she couldn’t see their source. The wails of souls filled the room,scattering about in a blind, mad frenzy, swirling through the air, lost,frantic, wild.The sound of distant laughter that Kahlan knew all too well died into a wailthat stretched into eternity.When the light of the candles returned, the book was gone, only a stain of ashto show where it had been.Kahlan and Cara rushed to Richard. He opened his eyes. He still didn’t lookwell, but he looked more alert. His breathing was stronger, and even. “Whathappened?” He asked. “I can breathe. My head isn’t pounding.”“The Mother Confessor saved you,” Cara announced. “As I have told you so often,women are stronger than men.”“Cara,” Kahlan whispered, “how did you know the three chimes?” Cara shrugged.“The Legate Rishi knew the words, with the message from the winds. When you said‘the three chimes,’ they just came to me, through his magic, as the othermessages from the winds came to me.”Kahlan pressed her forehead to Cara’s shoulder in relief, in wordless gratitude.With equally silent empathy, Cara stroked Kahlan’s back.Richard blinked and scrunched his eyes, as if clearing his head. When he sat up,Kahlan leaned to hug him, but Cara held her back.“Please, Mother Confessor, may I be first? I fear that once you start, I maynever again get a chance.”Kahlan grinned. “You’re right about that. Take all you want.” As Cara threw herarms around Richard and squeezed for all she was worth, whispering private,heartfelt words in his ear, Kahlan stood and faced the sliph.“I can’t thank you enough, sliph. You saved Richard. You are a friend, and Iwill honor you as long as I live.”The silver face warped into a satisfied smile. She looked down at Drefan’s body.“He had no magic, but he was using his talent to stop the flow of blood so thathe might live long enough to kill master. It is death to breathe me if you haveno magic. I am pleased I could take him on a journey, a journey to the world ofthe dead.”Richard stood on wobbly legs and slipped an arm around Kahlan’s waist. “Sliph,you have my gratitude, too. I don’t know what it is I could ever do for you, butif it is within my power, it’s yours for the asking.”The sliph smiled. “Thank you, master. I would be pleased to have you travel withme. You will be pleased.”Even though he was unsteady on his feet, Richard’s eyes had the sparkle back.“Yes, we would like to travel. I need to rest for a time first, to finishrecovering and get my strength back, and then we will travel, I promise you.”Kahlan took up Cara’s hand. “Are you all right? I mean, are you really allright... everything?”Cara nodded with a haunted look in her eyes. “I still have the ghosts of thepast with me, but I am all right. Thank you, sister, for helping me. It is notoften that a Mord-Sith can depend on anyone else for help, but with Richard asLord Rahl, and you as Mother Confessor, all things seem possible.”Cara glanced to Richard. “When you healed the Mother Confessor, you seemed toglow, as if a spirit was with you.”“I believe the good spirits helped me. I do indeed.”“I recognized the spirit. It was Raina.”Richard nodded. “It felt like Raina. When I was in the spirit world, Denna toldme that Raina was at peace, and knows that we love her.”“I think we should tell this to Berdine,” Cara said.Richard slipped his other arm around Cara’s waist, and started them all towardthe door. “I think we should, too.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 68Several days later, when Richard was almost fully recovered, Tristan Bashkar’suncle, King Join Bashkar, the king of Jara, rode into Aydindril at the head ofhis company of king’s lancers. On the point of each of the hundred lances was ahead.Kahlan watched from a window as the lances, under the watchful eye of D’Haransoldiers, were deployed in an arrow-straight double row along the entrance tothe Confessors’ Palace. Flags of state flew from poles held by the firstopposing pair of Jarian soldiers. Join Bashkar, with his star guide Javas Kedarbehind him, waited until the lancers were lined up perfectly, their armorgleaming in the sun, before he strode regally, between the row of heads, towardthe entrance.As she peered out the window, Kahlan touched Cara’s arm. “Go get Richard. Havehim meet me in the council chambers.”Cara was out the door and on her way before Kahlan could turn to be on her way,too.Kahlan Amnell, Mother Confessor, sitting in the first chair under the figures ofMagda Searus, the first Mother Confessor, and her wizard, Merritt, paintedacross the expanse of the dome above the council chambers, waited for herwizard.Her heart lifted when she saw him sweep into the room, golden cloak billowingout behind, dressed in the gold-trimmed black outfit of a war wizard, the goldand ruby amulet on his chest gleaming in the streamers of sunlight through whichhe strode, his silver wristbands burnished and bright. The Sword of Truth at hiship caught the light, sending out a starburst of sunlight to glitter across thepolished marble.“Good morning, my queen!” he called out, his voice echoing around the huge room.“How do you fare this, your last day of freedom?”Kahlan rarely laughed in the council chambers. It had always seemed improper.She laughed, now, the lilting sound echoing around the cavernous room, bringinga smile to the guards.“I fare well. Lord Rahl,” she said as he ascended the dais. Cara and Berdinefollowed in his shadow, along with Ulic and Egan, taking up places to eitherside.“What’s going on?” he asked, more seriously. “I heard that some king just rodein with a hundred heads on pikes.”“The king of Jara. Remember? You sent him Tristan’s head, demanding hissurrender?”“Oh, that king.” Richard slid down into a chair beside her. “Whose heads arcthey?”“I guess we’re about to find out.”The guards pulled open the double doors. Light stabbed in through the doorway,silhouetting the two figures as they approached.Once before the dais, the king spread his violet cape, trimmed in spottedwhitefox, and went to one knee in a deep bow. Behind him, the star guide went toboth knees, in his bow. “Rise, my children,” Kahlan said in formal response tothe bow. “Mother Confessor,” King Join said, “how good to see you again.” Histrim figure, his greying hair meticulously cut so that it swept back as if hewere facing the wind. his elegant scabbard and sword, his ribbons, his sash, hisred and blue and gold-embroidered coat, and his jewelled pins, made him look oneof the most grand of kings. Kahlan had always thought.“And you. King Join.” Kahlan lifted an introductory hand. “This is Lord Rahl,Master of the D’Haran empire, and my husband to be.” The king lifted an eyebrow.“As I have heard it told. My congratulations.” Richard leaned forward. “I sentyou a message. What is your reply?” Kahlan thought that she had a lot of work todo, teaching Richard proper diplomatic decorum.The king let out a belly laugh. “It will be a pleasure being part of an empireled by a man who doesn’t gibber jabber me to death.” He lifted a thumb,indicating the star guide behind him. “Like some people.”“And does that mean that you surrender?” Richard pressed. “It does indeed. LordRahl, Mother Confessor.“A large delegation from the Imperial Order came to Sandilar and invited us tojoin the Imperial Order. We had been waiting for a sign, as requested by JavasKedar, here. Tristan thought to take matters into his own hands, and try tostrike a favorable deal with the Order.“When the plague came, we thought it showed the power of the Order, and wefeared that, I must admit, but when you swept the plague from the land, that wassign enough for me. Javas, here, will no doubt soon find the appropriate sign inthe sky to confirm my decision. If not, there are other star guides.”A red-faced Javas Kedar bowed. “As I told you. Your Highness, as your starguide, I will be able to confirm your decision without difficulty.” The kingscowled over his shoulder. “Good!”“And the heads?” Richard asked.“The delegation from the Imperial Order. I brought you their heads to show youmy sincerity. I wanted you to see that this is a choice I make with conviction.I thought it a fitting answer to the likes of people who would cast a plagueinto the land, to kill indiscriminately. It shows their true nature, putting thelie to all the things they say.”Richard bowed his head to the king. “Thank you, King Join.”“Who ordered the beheading of my nephew, Tristan?”“I did,” Richard said. “As I stood on a balcony watching, with the MotherConfessor at my side, Tristan entered the Mother Confessor’s bedroom and stabbeda nightdress stuffed with tow that we had placed there. He thought he waskilling her.”The king shrugged. “Justice befits all, no matter his station. I bear no grudge.Tristan did not serve our people well, either. I look forward to the day we canbe rid of the threat from the Order.”“As do we,” Richard said. “With your help, we are that much closer to that day.”As the king went to see to the signing of papers, and to discuss logistics withthe D’Haran command, Richard and Kahlan rose to leave, but were interrupted by aguard. “What is it?” Kahlan asked. “There are three men asking to see LordRahl.” ‘Three men? Who are they?”“They did not give their names. Mother Confessor, but they said they wereRaug’Moss.”Richard sat back down. “Send them in.”Under the desk, Kahlan reached over and curled her fingers around his hand,giving him a reassuring squeeze as three figures in flaxen cloaks, with broadhoods pulled up onto their heads, and with their hands folded before them,glided up to the dais.“I am Lord Rahl,” Richard said.“Yes,” the one in front said, “we feel the bond.” He lifted a hand out to hisside. “This is Brother Kerloff, and this is Brother Houck.” He pushed his hoodback to reveal a heavily creased face and a head of thinning grey hair. “I amMarsden Taboor.”Richard warily eyed the three men. “Welcome to Aydindril. I hear you wanted tosee me. What is it I can do for you?”“We are searching for Drefan Rahl,” Marsden Taboor said. Richard rubbed histhumb along the edge of the desk as he watched the three men. “I’m sorry, butyour High Priest is dead.” The two in back shared a look.Marsden Taboor’s expression darkened. “High Priest? I am the High Priest of theRaug’Moss, and have been since before Drefan was born.” Richard frowned. “Drefantold us he was the High Priest.” Marsden Taboor stroked his temple as hesearched for words. “Lord Rahl, I’m afraid that your brother was... given todelusion. If he told you that he was the High Priest of the Raug’Moss, then hewas deceiving you for reasons I fear to imagine.“He was left with us by his mother, when he was a young boy. We raised him,knowing what his father would do should he come to discover a son without thegift. Drefan could be-dangerous. Once we realized this, we kept him confined,within our community, to prevent him from hurting anyone.“He was talented at healing, and we always hoped that he would come to be atpeace with himself. We hoped that through healing he could find a way to provehis worth, in his own right.“A while back, he vanished. Several of our healers were found dead. They hadbeen killed in a most unpleasant fashion: torture. We have been searching forDrefan since. We have been lo several places where he had been, and found womenwho had been murdered in a similar way.“Drefan had an unsavory attitude toward women. His father, too, was not inclinedto be kind toward women. Though he escaped his father in body, I think he failedto escape him in spirit.“I pray he has not caused harm to anyone here.” Richard was silent for a timebefore he spoke.“We had a plague. A terrible plague. Thousands died. Without regard for himself.Drefan, upholding the noble ideals of the Raug’Moss, worked to help thosestricken. He shared his knowledge, and in that way may have prevented yet morefrom dying.“My brother, in his own way, helped stop the plague, and in so doing, he died.”Marsden Taboor folded his hands before him again as he studied Richard’s eyes.“Is this the way you wish it remembered?”“He was my brother. Partly because of his being here, I learned the power offorgiveness.”Kahlan squeezed Richard’s hand under the table.“Thank you for seeing me. Lord Rahl.” Marsden Taboor bowed. “In your light wethrive.”“Thank you,” Richard whispered.The three healers started away. but Marsden Taboor turned back. “I knew yourfather. You do not take after him. Drefan did. Not many will mourn the passingof your father, or your brother.“I can see in your eyes. Lord Rahl, a healer, a true healer, besides a warrior.A wizard, as a healer, must be in balance, or he is lost. D’Hara is well served,at long last. Call on us if you have need.”Ulic let out a sigh when the doors closed. “Lord Rahl, there are otherrepresentatives also wishing to see you.”“If you are well enough,” Cara added.“Someone always wants to see us.” Richard stood and held out his hand to Kahlan.“General Kerson can see them. Don’t we have something more important to do?”“Are you sure you are well enough?” Kahlan asked. “I’ve never felt better. Youhaven’t had a change of mind, have you?” Kahlan smiled as she took his hand andstood. “Never. If Lord Rahl is fully recovered, what are we waiting for? Mythings are ready.”“About time,” Berdine muttered.As they waited for Richard to return, Kahlan put a reassuring hand on Cara’sback. “She wouldn’t lie to us, Cara. If the sliph says you can travel, you cantravel.”The sliph had tested Cara, Berdine, Ulic, and Egan, all of them thinking that,as guards, they should go along to protect Richard and Kahlan.Only Cara had passed the sliph’s test. Richard guessed that it was because Carahad linked with the Andolian leader, Legate Rishi, and he must have an elementof both sides of the magic. Cara didn’t like anything to do with magic, and thesliph was definitely magic enough to give her pause.Kahlan leaned close, and whispered in Cara’s ear. “You have passed bigger teststhan this, in this room. I am a sister of the Agiel; I will hold your hand thewhole way.”Cara eyed Kahlan, and then the sliph.“You have to do it, Cara,” Berdine pleaded. “You will be the only Mord-Sith atthe wedding of our Lord Rahl and Mother Confessor.”Cara’s brow twitched as she leaned toward Berdine. “Lord Rahl healed you onetime.” Berdine nodded. “Since then, have you felt a... special bond with him?”Berdine smiled. “Yes. That is why I want you to go. I’ll be all right. I knowRaina would want you to go. too.” She gave Ulic a backhanded slap on hisstomach. “Besides, someone has to stay here and keep Ulic and Egan in line.”Ulic and Egan, together, rolled their eyes.Cara put a hand on Kahlan’s arm as she leaned close and whispered, “Since LordRahl healed you, have you felt... have you felt it, too?”Kahlan smiled. “I felt it before he healed me. It is called love, Cara. Trulycaring about someone else, not only because you are bonded to them, but becauseyou share something in your heart. When he healed you, you felt his love foryou.”“But I knew before that.”Kahlan shrugged. “Maybe it was just a more vivid way of feeling it.” Cara liftedher Agiel, rolling it in her fingers. “Maybe, he is a brother of the Agiel.”Kahlan smiled. “With all we’ve been through together, I guess we are all asclose as family.”Richard strode into the room. “I’m ready. Shall we travel?” Richard couldn’ttake the Sword of Truth into the sliph; its magic was incompatible with lifebeing sustained while travelling. He had gone up to leave his sword in the FirstWizard’s enclave, where it would be safe, where no one but he could get to it.Except Zedd, of course. But Zedd was no longer living. At least, Kahlan didn’tthink he was alive. Richard refused to doubt that he was.Richard rubbed his hands together. “So, Cara, are you going, or not? I wouldreally like you to be there. It would mean a lot to us.”Cara smiled. “I must go. You are incapable of protecting yourself. Without aMord-Sith, you would be helpless.”Richard turned to the silver face watching them. “Sliph, I know that I put youto sleep before, but you didn’t stay asleep. Why?”“You did not put me into the deep sleep from which only one such as yourself cancall me. You put me-at rest. Others can call me if I am only at rest.”“But we can’t allow those others to use you. Can’t you refuse? Can’t you justnot go to them if they call? We can’t have you taking Jagang’s wizards and suchall over Creation to cause trouble.”The sliph regarded him with a thoughtful expression. “Those who made me thesliph made me this way. I must travel with those who ask, if they have the priceof power required.” She moved to the edge of her well, closer to him. “But if Iwas asleep, only you have the power to call me, master, and then the otherscould not use me.”“But I tried to put you to sleep before, and it didn’t work.” The sliph’s smilereturned. “You did not have the silver required, before.”“Silver?”The sliph reached out and touched his wristbands. “Silver.”“You mean, when I crossed my wrists to put you to sleep before, it didn’t workbecause I didn’t have these? And now, if I put you to sleep, it will work?”“Yes, master.”Richard thought a moment. “Does it-hurt, or anything, when you are put into thissleep?”“No. It is rapture, for me, when I sleep, because I am with the rest of mysoul.” Richard’s eyes widened. “When you sleep, you go to the world of souls?”“Yes, master. I am not to tell anyone how it is that they can put me into the ,sleep, but you are the only master, and since you wished to know, you will notbe angry that I tell you.” Richard sighed with relief. “Thank you, sliph. Youhave given us a way to prevent the wrong people from using you. I’m glad to knowthat you will be pleased to go into your sleep.” Richard hugged Berdine. “Takecare of everything until we get back.”“I am to be in charge, then?” Berdine asked. Richard frowned suspiciously. “Allthree of you are in charge.”“Are you sure you heard that. mistress Berdine?” Ulic asked. “I don’t want youto later say that you heard no such orders.”Berdine made a face at him as Richard helped Kahlan up onto the well. “I heard.All three of us are to take care of things.”Kahlan adjusted the bone knife on her arm, and the pack on her back. She tookCara’s hand as she climbed up. “Sliph,” Richard said with a big grin, “we wishto travel.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 69Breathe.Kahlan let go the silken rapture and drew in a breath, and the world. As theysat up on the edge of the sliph’s stone wall, Kahlan smacked Cara on the back.“Breathe, Cara. Come on, let it go. Let out the sliph, and breathe.” Carafinally bent forward and released the sliph from her lungs, reluctantly pullinga breath. Kahlan remembered how hard it was the first time, not only to breathethe sliph, but to then breathe the air again. Cara had held on tightly toRichard and Kahlan’s hands the whole time they travelled. Cara looked up with asilly grin. “That was-wonderful.” Richard gave them both a hand down. Kahlanadjusted the bone knife on her arm, and the small pack on her back. It felt goodto be in her travelling clothes again. Cara thought that Kahlan looked odd inpants.“This is where you wished to travel,” the sliph said. “The Jocopo Treasure.”Richard looked around the cave, having to duck down because the ceiling was solow. “I don’t see any treasure.”“It’s in the next room,” Kahlan told him. “Someone must be expecting us. Theyleft a torch burning.”“Are you ready to sleep?” Richard asked the sliph. “Yes, master. I look forwardto being with my soul.”The thought of what the sliph was, what the wizards had made her into, gaveKahlan shivers.“Will it make you-unhappy, when I need to wake you again?”“No, master. I am always ready to please.”Richard nodded. ‘Thank you for your help. We all are in your debt. Have agood... sleep.”The sliph smiled at him as Richard crossed his wrists, closing his eyes, callingthe magic.The shiny silver face, reflecting the dancing torchlight, softened, melting backinto the pool of quicksilver. Richard’s fists began to glow. The silverwristbands he wore brightened to such intensity that Kahlan could see the otherside of them through his flesh and bone, and the way they touched, they formedinto endless twin loops: the symbol for infinity.The pool of sparkling silver took on the glow as the sliph sank down into herwell, slowly at first, and then with gathering speed, until she vanished intothe far darkness below.Richard took the reed torch and the three of them moved out through a wide, lowpassageway, following the twisting, turning route through dark brown rock, untilthey came at last to an expansive room.Kahlan gestured around the room. “The Jocopo Treasure.” Richard held the torchup. Torchlight reflected back in thousands of golden sparkles from the roomfilled with gold in nearly every form, from nuggets and crude ingots to goldenstatues.“Well, it isn’t hard to see why it’s called the Jocopo Treasure,” Richard said.He pointed toward the shelves. “Looks like something is missing.”Kahlan saw what he meant. “When I was here before, those shelves were packedfull of rolled vellum scrolls.” She sniffed the air. “Something else is missing,too. This room was filled with foul air before. It’s gone now.”She remembered how it made her gag and cough, and her head spin, having tobreathe the stench. On the floor of the cave was a smoldering heap of ash.Kahlan swiped the toe of her boot across the ash. “I wonder what happened here.”The flame of the torch whipped and fluttered as they followed the twistingtunnel up and out into a golden dawn. Thin bands of violet clouds drifted acrossthe sunrise. Luminous gold, more stunning than the Jocopo Treasure, edged theclouds. Verdant grasslands spread out before them, smelling clean and fresh. “Itlooks like the Azrith Plains in spring,” Cara said, “before the high heat ofsummer bakes it barren.”Broad swaths of wildflowers at their feet led in the general direction of theMud People. Kahlan took Richard’s hand. It was a beautiful morning for a walkthrough the spring grasslands of the wilds. It was a beautiful day to bemarried.Long before they reached the Mud People’s village, they could hear the sound ofdrums drifting out onto the plains. Laughter and song filled the morning air.“Sounds like the Mud People are having a banquet,” Richard said. “What do youthink that’s about?”His voice sounded uneasy. She felt the same; banquets were usually held to callthe spirit ancestors, in preparation for a gathering.Chandalen met them not far from the village. He was wearing the coyote hide ofan elder. His hair was slicked down with sticky mud. He was bare-chested and hadon his ceremonial dress of buckskin pants and his finest knife, and he carriedhis best spear.Grim-faced, Chandalen strode forward and slapped Kahlan. “Strength to ConfessorKahlan.”Richard caught Cara by the wrist. “Easy,” he whispered. “We told you about this.It’s the way they greet people.”Kahlan returned the slap, a show of respect for a person’s strength. “Strengthto Chandalen and the Mud People. It is good to be home.” She fingered the coyotehide. “You are an elder, now?”He nodded. “Elder Breginderin died of the fever. I was named elder.” Kahlansmiled. “A wise choice, them picking you.”Chandalen stood before Richard, appraising him a moment. The two men had oncebeen foes. Chandalen finally slapped Richard, harder than he had Kahlan.“Strength to Richard with the Temper. It is good to see you again, too. I amhappy that you are to marry the Mother Confessor, so that she will not pickChandalen.” Richard returned the slap in kind. “Strength to Chandalen. You havemy gratitude, for protecting Kahlan on your journey together.” He lifted a hand.“This is our friend and protector, Cara.”Chandalen was a protector of his people, and the term had special meaning tohim. He lifted his chin as he looked into her eyes. He slapped her harder thanhe had slapped either Richard or Kahlan. “Strength to protector Cara.”It was fortunate that Cara wasn’t wearing her armored gloves. As hard as shepunched him, she would have broken his jaw. Chandalen grinned when hestraightened his neck.“Strength to Chandalen,” she said to him, and then to Richard, “I like thiscustom.”Cara reached out and ran a finger over a few of Chandalen’s scars. “Very nice.This one here is excellent. The pain must have been exquisite.”Chandalen frowned at Kahlan and spoke in his language. “What does that last wordmean ?”“It means that it must have been intense pain, “ Kahlan told him. She had taughtChandalen her language, and he did very well, but he still had some to learn.Chandalen grinned with pride. “Yes, it was very painful. I wept for my mother.”Cara lifted an eyebrow to Kahlan. “I like him.”Chandalen looked Cara up and down, taking in the red leather, and the shape ofher.“You have fine breasts.” Her Agiel flicked up into her fist.Kahlan put a restraining hand on Cara’s arm. “The Mud People have differentcustoms,” she whispered. “To them, it means that you look like a healthy, strongwoman, able to bear children and raise them to be healthy. To them, this is astrictly proper compliment.” She leaned closer, lowering her voice so thatChandalen couldn’t hear. “Just don’t tell him that you would like to see himwith the mud washed out of his hair, or you will be inviting him to give youthose children.”Cara took in all this, considering Kahlan’s words with care. Finally, she turnedand, bending over a little, lifted her red leather to expose a nasty scar.“This one was very painful, like the one you have.” Chandalen grunted withknowing appreciation. “I had more, on my front, but Lord Rahl made themdisappear. It is a shame; some were quite remarkable.”Richard and Kahlan followed behind Chandalen and Cara as he showed her hisweapons, and they discussed the worst place to be wounded. She was impressedwith his knowledge.“Chandalen,” Kahlan asked, “what’s going on? Why has a banquet been called?”He looked over his shoulder as if she were deranged. “It is a wedding banquet.For your wedding.”Kahlan and Richard shared a look. “But, how did you know we were coming to bemarried?” Chandalen shrugged. ‘The Bird Man told me.”As they entered the village, they were surrounded by a Hood of people. Childrenswept in around them, touching the wandering Mud People, as they called Richardand Kahlan. People they knew came to give them gentle slaps in greeting.Savidlin was there, clapping Richard on the back, and his wife, Weselan, washugging and kissing them both. Their son, Siddin, threw his arms around Kahlan’sleg, jabbering up at them in his language. It felt so good to ruffle his hairagain, Richard and Cara didn’t understand any of it; only Chandalen spoke theirlanguage.“We have come to he married, “ Kahlan told Weselan. “I brought the beautifuldress you made for me. I hope you remember that I asked you to stand with me.“Weselan beamed. “I remember.”Kahlan saw a man with long silver hair, dressed in buckskin pants and tunic,approaching. She leaned toward Cara. “This is their leader.” The Bird Mangreeted them with the gentle slaps customary in the village proper. He embracedKahlan in a fatherly hug. “The fever is over. Our ancestor’s spirit must havebeen a help to you. “ Kahlan nodded. “I am glad you are home. It will he good towed you and Richard with the Temper. Everything is prepared. ““What did he say?” Richard asked. “Everything is prepared for our wedding.”Richard scowled. “It makes me nervous when people know things that we haven’ttold them.”“Richard with the Temper is upset? He is not happy with our preparations?”“No, it’s not that,” Kahlan said. “Everything is wonderful. It’s just that wedon’t understand how you could know we would be here to he married. We’repurled. We didn’t know ourselves until just a couple of days ago. “The Bird Man pointed to one of the open pole structures shaded under a grassroof. “That man over there told us. ““Really,” Richard said, after Kahlan translated, his scowl growing. “Well, Ithink it’s about time we go see this man who seems to know more about us than wedo.”As they turned away, Kahlan caught the Bird Man scratching a cheek to screen asmile.They had to work at making their way through the throng. The entire village wasout in the open area, celebrating. Musicians and dancers entranced children andadults alike. People paused to talk to Richard and Kahlan as they passed. Youngpeople, especially young girls, who were always painfully shy in the past, nowboldly offered congratulations. It was as festive an event as Kahlan had everseen.At various open pole structures where food was being prepared, people, beguiledby the different aromas, crowded around to sample the fare. A contingent ofyoung women carried bowls and platters, and passed around food.Kahlan saw special women at one of the cook fires preparing a singular offeringserved only at gatherings. No one congregated to sample it. This dish waspresented only by those women, according to strict protocol, and by invitationonly.Cara didn’t like how close people crowded in around her charges, but she did herbest to remain tolerant while at the same time watchful and prepared to react.She wasn’t gripping her Agiel, but Kahlan knew that it was never more than aflick away.Young women were carrying platters of the more traditional food to and from thepole building where the Bird Man had pointed them. Richard, holding Kahlan bythe hand, pushed his way through the crowd around the platform.They finally made it to the head of the crowd, at the platform. Richard andKahlan froze in shock. “Zedd-” Richard whispered.Reposing in his splendid violet and black robes, the regal effect somewhatdiminished by the way his wavy white hair stuck out in its typical disarray, wasRichard’s grandfather. The raw-boned old wizard glanced up from the platform asyoung women offered him platters of food to sample. A squat woman in a darkdress and cloak sat cross-legged beside him. “Zedd!” Richard bounded onto theplatform. Zedd smiled and waved. “Oh, there you are, my boy.”“You’re alive! I knew you were alive!”“Well, of course I’m-”That was all he got out before Richard scooped him up, squeezing so hard thatZedd lost his wind with a whoosh.Zedd’s fists beat on Richard’s shoulders. “Richard!” he squeaked. “Bags,Richard! You’re going to crush me! Leave go!”Richard set him down, only to have Kahlan rush to embrace him. “Richard keptsaying you were alive, but I didn’t believe him.” The woman rose up. “Good tosee you, Richard.”“Ann? You’re alive too!”She smiled. “No thanks to your fool grandfather.” Her knowing eyes turned toKahlan. “And this could be none other than the Mother Confessor herself.”Richard hugged her before the introductions. Zedd took a bite of a rice cakewhile he watched.Richard brought Cara forward. She spoke before he had a chance. “I am LordRahl’s bodyguard.”Richard looked to her eyes. “This is Cara, and she is more than a guard. She isour friend. Cara, this is my grandfather, Zedd, and Annalina Aldurren, Prelateof the Sisters of the Light.”“Retired Prelate,” Ann said. “Pleased to meet a friend of Richard.” Richardturned back to Zedd. “I can’t believe you’re here. This is the best surprise wecould possibly have. But what’s this about you knowing we were coming to getmarried?”Zedd spoke with his mouth full. “Read it. Read all about it.”“Read it? Where?”“In the Jocopo Treasure.”Kahlan leaned in. “There’s writing on all that gold?”Zedd waved the rice cake. “No, no, not the gold-the Jocopo Treasure. Theprophecies. All those scrolls. They were the Jocopo Treasure. We burned them tokeep them out of the hands of the Imperial Order. I read a few, before Idestroyed them. That’s where I read the prophecy about you two being married.Ann figured out the day. She’s quite knowledgeable about prophecy.”“Well, it wasn’t a difficult prophecy,” Ann said. “None of them were. That waswhy they were so dangerous, if Jagang had captured them. He nearly did.”“So, you two came to destroy the prophecies?” Richard asked. “Yes.” Zedd threwup his hands with a huff, “Oh, but a terrible time of it we’ve had, though.”“Yes, just terrible,” Ann confirmed.Zedd shook a sticklike finger at Richard. “While you’ve been larking about inAydindril, we’ve had real trouble.”“Trouble? What sort of trouble?”“Awful trouble,” Ann said.“Yes,” Zedd agreed. “We were captured, and held in the most horrid ofconditions. It was awful. Simply awful. We barely got away with our lives.”“Who captured you?”“The Nangtong.” Kahlan cleared her throat. “The Nangtong? Why would the Nangtongcapture you?”Zedd tugged his robes straight. “They were going to sacrifice us. Humansacrifices, we almost were. We were in mortal danger the entire time.”Kahlan squinted skeptically. “The Nangtong are daring to engage in theirforbidden rites?”“Something about red moons,” Zedd offered. “They feared the worst, and were onlytrying to protect themselves.”Kahlan cocked her head. “Nonetheless, I will have to pay them a visit and see tothis.”“You could have been killed,” Richard said.“Piffle. A wizard and a sorceress are smarter than a wandering band of Nangtong.Aren’t we, Ann?” Ann blinked. “Well-”“Well, yes, as Ann says, it was more complicated than that.” Zedd turned awayfrom her. “But it was just awful, I can assure you. And then we were sold intoslavery.”Richard’s brow lifted. “Slavery!”“Indeed. To the Si Doak. We were forced to labor as slaves. But the Si Doakdidn’t like us, for some reason, something about Ann being unsatisfactory, andthey decided to sell us to cannibals.” Richard’s jaw dropped. “Cannibals?”Zedd grinned. “Fortunately, the cannibals turned out to be the Mud People.Chandalen was the one they approached. He knew me, of course, from when we weretogether before, so he played along, and bought us to get us away from ourbondage to the Si Doak.”“And why couldn’t you get away from the Si Doak?” Kahlan asked. “You’re awizard. Ann is a sorceress.”Zedd pointed at his bare wrists. “They put magic wristbands on us. We werehelpless.” He looked up. “Quite helpless. It was terrible. We were helplessslaves under the lash.”“That sounds dreadful,” Richard said. “Then how did you get the bands off?” Zeddthrew his arms up. “We couldn’t.”Richard pressed one hand to his forehead and held the other up. “Well, they’reoff now.”Zedd scratched his chin. “Well, now they are. The bands are held on with magic.I-we-were smart enough to know better than to try to use magic. That would havebound them on even harder. We just had to wait, without using magic, until theylost their power. Once we were away from the Si Doak, and were burning thescrolls, they came undone, and fell off.”“So, that was your plan all along?”“Of course it was!”Ann nodded. “Trust in the Creator to reveal His plan.” Zedd shook a finger up atRichard. “Magic is dangerous, Richard. As you will learn, someday, the hardestpart of being a wizard is knowing when not to use magic. This was one of thosetimes.“We had to find the Jocopo Treasure. With all the currents of trouble about, Iknew our best chance would be to do it without magic.” He folded his arms. “Andit worked, too, thus proving my point.”Chandalen stepped forward. “Many soldiers came toward us.” He pointed off towardthe southeast. “A large scouting party of men came to get these things that Zeddburned. While he and Ann were burning them, my men and I fought off the enemy.“A great battle was fought to the west, against the main force of the enemy.This army of the Order was destroyed.“I went and spoke with a man called Reibisch, and he said that one named Nathanhad sent him to destroy our enemy.” Richard shook his head. “This is all veryconfusing.”Zedd flicked a hand. “Ah, well, you’ll learn, someday, Richard. This wizardbusiness is very complicated. Someday, when you decide to do something with yourgift, other than sit around with your intended while I’m out risking my neck,then you will see. By the way, what have you been up to, while all the importantwork has been going on?”“What have I been up to?” Kahlan smiled as she put a hand on his shoulder whileRichard tried to think how to begin. “Ah, well, I’m the Lord Rahl, now, andall.”Zedd grunted and flopped down on the wooden platform. “Lord Rahl, indeed.” Hescooped up a roasted pepper. “The paperwork must be gruelling.”Richard scratched his head while Ann sat down. “Zedd, can you answer somethingfor me? Why are the books in the First Wizard’s private enclave stacked up inwobbly columns?”“It’s a telltale, of sorts. I remember how they’re stacked, so that if anyonehas touched them, I’ll know it.” Zedd’s hazel eyes opened wide. “What? Bags,Richard, what were you doing in there? That’s a dangerous place! And how did youget in there?” Zedd pointed at Richard’s chest. “That amulet! It’s from inthere. How did you get in there? Bags, Richard! Where’s the Sword of Truth? Ientrusted the sword to you! You weren’t foolish enough to give it to someone?”“Uh, well...I couldn’t travel in the sliph with it, so I had to leave it in theFirst Wizard’s enclave, so no one could get at it.”“Sliph? What’s a sliph? Richard, you’re the Seeker. You have to have yoursword-it’s your weapon. You can’t just leave it lying about places.”“When you gave it to me, you told me that the sword was just a tool, and that itis the Seeker that is the true weapon.”“So I did. But I didn’t think you were listening.” Zedd peered up at him. “Youdidn’t mess with the books, I hope. You don’t know enough to be allowed to readany of them.”“Just one. Tagenricht ost fuer Mosst Verlaschendreck nich Greschlechten.”“That’s High D’Haran.” Zedd dismissed the matter with a wave. “No one knows HighD’Haran anymore. At least you can’t get into trouble with a book you can’tread.” Zedd shook his finger. “And you still haven’t said how you got in there!”“It wasn’t all that hard to get in.” The mirth melted from Richard’s face. “Itwas a lot easier than it was getting into the Temple of the Winds.”Both Zedd and Ann shot to their feet.“The Temple of the Winds!” they said as one.“Temple of the Winds Inquisition and Trial-that’s what the book was. I’ve kindof had to learn High D’Haran.” Richard put his arm around Kahlan’s shoulders.“Jagang sent Sister Amelia there. She entered through something calledBetrayer’s Hall. She betrayed the Keeper to get in.“She came back with magic and started a plague. It killed thousands of people.She started it among children-at Jagang’s instruction. We watched, helpless,while children and friends died.“There was no other way. I had to go there to stop the plague, or it would havebeen a firestorm that would have consumed nearly everyone.”One of the women who prepared the special meat approached, carrying a tray ofneatly arranged dried strips. She offered the tray to Chandalen first: he was anelder, now. Chandalen tore off a bite as he looked up at Richard. Richard knewwhat the meat was. He took a big piece.Kahlan had always refused to eat this dish in the past. This time, when offered,she took a piece. Chandalen watched her pull off a bite.Zedd took a piece, and then the tray was offered to Ann. Kahlan was going to saysomething, but Zedd shot her a silencing glance. They ate in silence a momentbefore Richard asked, “Who is it?”“The commander of the men of the Order who came here and attacked us to get theJocopo Treasure that Zedd burned.” Ann’s eyes came up. “You mean... ?”“We fight a battle for our existence,” Richard said. “If we lose. we all die.and the man who started a plague among children will rule those still alive. Allmagic will be eliminated. Those left will be his slaves. The Mud People do thisso that they might know the hearts of their enemy, and save their families.”Richard glared at her. “Eat it, so that you, too, may know the enemy better.” Itwas not Richard but Lord Rahl who had spoken.Ann watched his eyes for a moment, and then started chewing. They all ate thestrip of their enemy’s flesh to know him better.“Sister Amelia,” Ann finally whispered. “If she has been to the Temple of theWinds... she will be beyond dangerous.”“She’s dead,” Kahlan said, haunted by the memory of it all. When Ann’squestioning eyes looked at her, Kahlan added, “Yes, I am sure. I put a swordthrough her heart. She had a dacra in Nathan’s leg. She was going to kill him.”“Nathan!” Ann said. “We must soon be off to find him. Where was this? Where ishe?”Zedd scowled over at Ann. “We?”“It was in Tanimura, in the Old World, just after Richard came back from theTemple of the Winds. Nathan helped me save Richard’s life by telling me thethree chimes.”Zedd and Ann’s eyes widened. They looked as if they had stopped breathing. Theyfinally glanced to each other.“The three chimes,” Ann said in a cautious voice. “You mean, he just mentioned‘the three chimes.’ He didn’t actually tell them to you? He didn’t speak them toyou?”Kahlan nodded. “Reechan-” Zedd and Ann threw their hands up. “No!” they yelledtogether.“Didn’t Nathan tell you that no one without the gift may speak the three chimesaloud?” Ann’s face had gone red. “Didn’t that crazy old man tell you that!”Kahlan scowled back. “Nathan is not a crazy old man. He helped me save Richard’slife. Without the three chimes, Richard would have died when he came back fromthe Temple of the Winds. I owe Nathan a great debt. We all do.”“I owe him a collar around his neck,” Ann muttered. “Before he causes who knowswhat catastrophe. Zedd, we must find him. And soon.” She lowered her voice to aprivate whisper. “And we must do something about... this business.”Zedd’s eyes turned to Kahlan. “You said them silently, when you did this. Yousaid the three chimes silently. You didn’t actually say them aloud. Tell me thatyou didn’t say them aloud.”“I had to. Cara remembered them, and said them. Then I said them aloud a coupleof times.” Zedd winced. “More than once?”“Zedd,” Ann murmured, “what are we going to do about this?”“Why?” Richard asked. “What’s the problem?”“Nothing you need be concerned about. Just don’t say them aloud again. Any ofyou.”“Zedd,” Ann whispered under her breath, “if she has freed-” Zedd lifted a handout to the side, touching her, silencing her. “What was I supposed to do?”Kahlan asked defensively. “Richard had absorbed the magic from the book SisterAmelia brought back from the winds. He had the plague. He was a breath or twoaway from death. He would have died within minutes, at the most. Would you havehad me let him die instead?”“Of course not, dear one. You did the right thing.” Zedd lifted an eyebrow toAnn as he leaned close. “We will discuss this later.”Ann folded her hands. “Of course. You did the only thing you could. We are allgrateful, Kahlan. You did well.”Zedd was looking more serious by the moment. “Bags, Richard, the Temple of theWinds is in the underworld. How did you get in?”Richard looked out over the celebration. “We need to tell you both the story.Some of it, anyway. But this is the day Kahlan and I are to be married.” Richardsmiled. Kahlan thought it looked forced. “It’s a hard story to tell. I’d rathertell you about it on another day. I can’t, just now...”Zedd stroked a thumb down his smooth jaw. “Of course, Richard, I understand. Andyou are quite right. Another day. But, the Temple of the Winds...” He lifted afinger, unable to resist asking a question. “Richard, what did you have to leaveat the Temple of the Winds in order to return?” Richard shared a long look withhis grandfather. “Knowledge.”“And what did you take away with you?”“Understanding.”Zedd encircled a protective arm around both Richard and Kahlan. “Good for you,Richard. Good for you. Good for both of you. You two have earned this day. Let’sput this other business aside for now, and let us celebrate the joy of yourmarriage.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 70They enjoyed the company of friends and loved ones the whole day. talking andlaughing, celebrating together with the Mud People. Kahlan did her best to tryto ignore the way her low-cut blue wedding dress displayed her breasts. It washard, with the way people kept coming up to her and telling her that she hadfine breasts. Richard wanted to know what they were saying all the time. Shethought it best to lie; she told him that they were saying that her dress wasbeautiful. As the sun turned the sky golden, it was at last time.Kahlan gripped Richard’s hand as if it were the only thing holding her on theground. Richard had trouble keeping his eyes off her in her blue wedding dress.Every time he looked at her, a helpless smile took him.Kahlan’s heart swelled with joy, seeing how much he liked the dress Weselan hadmade for her. She had for so long dreamed of wearing it, dreamed of this moment.She had hoped so often, with all her heart, that this day would come. She hadfeared so often that it never would. So many times, something had happened,delaying this moment. Now, it was happening.Richard mimicked the Mud People’s words, not realizing that he was saying howfine he thought her breasts looked; he thought he was telling her how beautifulher dress looked. Everyone grinned with satisfaction when he spoke the words intheir language, happy that he agreed with them. Kahlan could feel her faceturning red.Richard looked magnificent in his black and gold war wizard’s uniform. Everytime Kahlan looked at him, a smile took her. She was marrying Richard. At last.Her knees trembled under the blue dress.Cara, standing behind, gave her a reassuring touch. Weselan, at Kahlan’s side,beamed with pride. Savidlin stood to the far side of Richard, beaming just asmuch. Zedd and Ann stood behind. Zedd was eating something.Kahlan silently prayed to the good spirits that, this time, nothing would gowrong, and that it would at last happen. She couldn’t help worrying that itwould be taken from her, yet again.The Bird Man straightened before them, clasping his hands. Behind him, theentire Mud People village spread out before the wedding party to hear the vows.When all had fallen silent, the Bird Man began, and Kahlan’s fear began to meltaway. to be replaced with joyous anticipation. As the Bird Man spoke, Chandalen,at his side, said the words in the language Richard and some of the others couldunderstand.“These two people have not been born Mud People, hut they have proven themselvesto he one of us. in their strength, and in their hearts. They have boundthemselves to us, and us to them. They have been our friends, and ourprotectors. That they would wish lo be wedded as Mud People proves their hearts.“As members of our people, these two have chosen not only to be wedded beforethose of this world, but before the next, and in so doing, have called thespirits of our ancestors to be with us on this day to smile on this joining. Wewelcome our ancestors into our hearts to share our joy. “Richard’s hand tightened around hers, and she realized that he was sharing herthoughts: it was real, at last, and it was as they both had alwaysdreamed-except it was better than she could ever have imagined.“Both of you are Mud People, and are bound not only by your words before yourpeople, but by your own hearts. These are simple words, but in simple things,there is great power. “ He met Richard’s eyes.“Richard, will you have this woman as your wife, and will you love and honor herin all ways for all time?”“I will,” he said in a clear voice that rang out over the gathering. The BirdMan looked into Kahlan’s eyes, and she had the most profound sense that he wasspeaking not only as a representative of his people, but for the spirits, too.She could almost hear their voices echoing in his.“Kahlan, will you have this man as your husband, and will you love and honor himin all ways for all time?”“I will,” she said, a clear chime matching Richard’s.“Then before your people, and before the spirits, you are now wedded for alltime.”All the gathered people were dead silent, until Richard took her in his arms andkissed her, and then they went wild. Kahlan hardly heard them.It seemed a dream. A dream she had dreamed so often that it had finally come tolife.To be in Richard’s arms. To have him. To be his wife, and he her husband. Forall time.And then everyone was bugging them. Zedd and Ann. The Bird Man and the elders.Weselan and the other wives.Cara, with tears in her eyes, hugged Kahlan. “Thank you both for wearing anAgiel at your wedding. Hally, Raina, and Denna are all watching because of that.Thank you for honoring the sacrifice of Mord-Sith.”With a thumb, Kahlan wiped the tear from Cara’s cheek. “Thank you for bravingthe magic of the sliph to be with us, my sister.”Everyone in the village crowded in to greet the new couple. Kahlan thought theymight be crushed. People brought food and flowers, and sincere, simple offeringsof every sort.The celebration resumed around the wedding platform. Kahlan tried to talk toeveryone, and to thank everyone, as did Richard, until, as Richard was askingsome of Chandalen’s hunters about the battle that they had witnessed, his goldencloak billowed out. There was no wind.Richard straightened. His raptor gaze swept out over the heads of the people,gathered before the wedding platform. He instinctively reached for his sword. Itwasn’t there. The crowd, in the back, fell silent. Zedd and Ann both stepped upbeside Richard and Kahlan. Cara had her Agiel in her fist as she pushed betweenthem to get in front. Richard gently pushed her behind. The entire village fellsilent, the people parting for two approaching figures. Some people grabbedtheir children and moved farther back as worried whispers rippled through thecrowd.As the two solitary figures, one tall and one short, came closer. Kahlan sawthat it was Shota, and her companion, Samuel.The witch woman, looking as stunning as ever, strode up onto the platform, herageless almond eyes staying on Kahlan the whole time. Shota took up Kahlan’shand. She kissed Kahlan’s cheek. “I have come to congratulate you. MotherConfessor, on your accomplishment, and on your marriage.”Throwing caution to the winds, Kahlan hugged the witch woman. “Thank you forcoming, Shota.”Shota smiled, staring into Richard’s eyes as she ran a lacquered nail along hisjaw. “Hard fought, Richard. Hard fought. And well earned.”Kahlan turned to the silent gathering. She knew that the Mud People feared thewitch woman so much that they wouldn’t even speak her name. Kahlan couldunderstand; she had felt nearly the same way herself.“Shota has come to offer her best wishes to us on our wedding day. She hashelped us in our struggle. She is a friend, and I hope you will welcome her tothis celebration, for she deserves to be here, and I wish her lo be here. “Kahlan turned to Shota. “I told them that-”Smiling, Shota held up a hand. “I know what you told them. Mother Confessor.”The Bird Man stepped forward. “Welcome to our home, Shota.”“Thank you, Bird Man. You have my word that we will bring no harm this day. “Shota glanced to Zedd. “A truce, for a day.” Zedd smiled a sly smile. “A truce.”Samuel’s long arm reached up, grabbing for the Bird Man’s carved bone whistle hewore around his neck. “Mine! Gimme!”Shota thunked him on the head. “Samuel, behave yourself.” The Bird Man smiled.He pulled the thong and whistle over his head and held it out to Samuel.“A gift, for a friend to the Mud People. “Samuel gently took the whistle. A grin split his face, showing his wickedlysharp teeth.“Thank you, Bird Man.” Shota said.Samuel blew the silent whistle. He seemed able to hear the sound, and waspleased by it. People began chuckling and talking again. Kahlan was relievedthat vultures didn’t appear in response to the silent whistle. Fortunately,Samuel didn’t know how to call specific birds. Samuel grinned at his gift andhung it around his neck. He took up Shota’s hand again.Shota’s arresting gaze took in Richard and Kahlan. In that moment, there was noone else there. The three of them were as good as alone, in that gaze.“Do not think, either of you, that just because I congratulate you, I willforget my promise to you.” Kahlan swallowed. “Shota-” Shota’s eyes were bothbeautiful and frightening as she held up a silencing finger.“You both have earned this joyous wedding. I am happy for you both. I will honoryour vows, and protect you in any way I can, out of respect for all you havedone for me, as long as you remember what I have warned you about. I will notallow a male child of this union to live. Do not doubt my word in this.”Richard’s gaze was heating. “Shota, I’ll not be threatened-” Again, the fingerrose, silencing Richard this time.“I do not make a threat. I deliver you a promise. I do not do it out ofanimosity for either of you, but out of concern for everyone else in the world.There is a long struggle ahead of us all. I will not allow any chance at victoryto be clouded by what you two would bring upon the world. Jagang is worryenough.”For some reason, Kahlan’s voice wouldn’t work. Richard didn’t seem to havewords, either. Kahlan believed Shota; she wasn’t doing this out of malice.Shota lifted Kahlan’s hand and placed something in it. “This is my gift to youboth. I do this out of love for you both, and for everyone else.” She smiled astrange smile. “An odd thing for a witch woman to say?”“No, Shota,” Kahlan said. “I don’t know that I believe what you tell us about ason, but I know that it is not said in hate.”“Good. Wear the gift, always, and all will be well. Mark my words well-nevertake this off when you are together, and you will always be happy. Disregard myrequest, and suffer the consequences of my vow.” She looked into Richard’s eyes.“Better you battle the Keeper himself, than me.”Kahlan opened her hand and saw a delicate necklace. A small, dark stone hungfrom the gold chain. “Why? What is this?”Shota put a finger under Kahlan’s chin as she stared into her eyes. “As long asyou wear it, you will bear no children.”Richard’s voice, strangely, seemed gentle. “But what if we-” Again, Shota’sraised finger silenced him. “You love each other. Have joy in that love, and ineach other. You have struggled hard to be together. Celebrate your union andyour love. You have each other, now, as you always wanted. Don’t throw it away.”Richard and Kahlan both nodded. Somehow, Kahlan didn’t feel any anger. She feltnothing other than relief that Shota wasn’t going to do anything to harm theirmarriage. It had a dreamlike quality, like a formal settlement over an obscure,remote tract of ground claimed by two lands, like agreements in the councilchambers over which she had so often presided. There seemed no emotion to it. Asimple settlement.Shota turned to go. “Shota,” Richard said. She turned back. “Won’t you stay?You’ve come a long way.”“Yes,” Kahlan said. “We really would like it if you stayed.” Shota smiled awitch woman smile as she watched Kahlan fasten the chain around her neck.“That you would ask is pleasure enough, but it is a long journey, and we must beon our way.”Kahlan ran down the steps and scooped up a pile of tava bread. She wrapped it ina square of cloth from the table. She met Shota at the bottom of the steps.“Take this for your journey, as our thanks for coming, and for the gift.” Shotakissed Kahlan’s cheek and then took the bundle. Samuel didn’t try to grab it, heseemed content. Richard was suddenly there, beside Kahlan. Shota smiled a smallsmile and kissed his cheek, too. She had a strange, wistful look. “Thank you.Both of you.”And then she was gone. Simply, gone.Zedd and Ann were still up on the platform, along with Cara and the rest of thepeople. Zedd turned to Richard and Kahlan.“What happened to Shota? We make a truce, and then she just leaves without aword?”Kahlan’s brow tightened. “She spoke to us.”Zedd glanced about. “When? She was gone before she had a chance to sayanything.”“I had intended to speak with her, too,” Ann said.Kahlan looked up at Richard. He looked back at Zedd. “She said some nice thingsto us. Maybe she just didn’t want you to hear her saying nice things.” Zeddgrunted a laugh. “No doubt.”Kahlan touched the dark stone on the necklace. She put an arm around Richard’swaist and pulled him close. “What do you think?” she whispered. Richard staredout in the direction Shota had gone.“For now, she’s right: we’re together. That’s what we wanted. I think that, fornow, we should be happy that our dream has at last come true and we can betogether. I’m so tired of trouble, and there is still Jagang to worry about. I’djust like to be with you for now, and love you.”Kahlan put her head against him. “I think you’re right. For now, let’s notcomplicate matters.”“We can worry about this another time.” He grinned at her. “Right?” Kahlanforgot all about Shota and the future and grinned back, thinking about the now.“Right.”The celebration went on until well after nightfall. Kahlan knew it would likelygo on all night. She whispered to Richard that she would be happy not to have toremain for the whole thing. Richard kissed her cheek, and then asked the BirdMan if they could be excused. They wanted to go to the spirit house. The spirithouse had special meaning to both of them.The Bird Man smiled. “It has been a long day. Sleep well.” Richard and Kahlansaid their thanks to everyone, and then, in the quiet of the spirit house, inthe soft glow of the low fire that always burned there, they were at long lastalone. As they stared into each other’s eyes, words were too small.Berdine stood tall and straight as she watched the double doors burst open. Likea gout of flame they stormed into the Confessors’ Palace-a dozen Mord-Sith inred leather.Soldiers scrambled across the slick marble, falling back out of the way, whileat the same time trying not to look hurried. They quickly established new guardpositions at a safe distance. The twelve women paid them no attention. Theexistence of D’Haran soldiers hardly registered on the mind of aMord-Sith-unless they gave her trouble. The group came to a halt. Silence onceagain settled in the entrance hall.“Berdine, how good to see you.”Berdine let a small smile touch her lips. “Welcome, Rikka. But what are youdoing here? Lord Rahl left you at the People’s Palace, awaiting his return.”Rikka’s eyes swept the area before her steady gaze settled on Berdine. “We heardthat he is here. now. and we decided that we should be closer so that we couldprotect him. We left the others at the palace, should he return unexpectedly. Wewill return with him when he goes home.” Berdine shrugged. “He sort of considersthis home. now.”“Whatever he wishes. We are here, now. Where is he, so that we may announceourselves, and protect him?”“He has gone to be married. Some distance to the south.” Rikka’s brows drewtogether. “Why are you not with him?”“He ordered me to stay here and see to things in his absence. Cara is with him.”“Cara. Good. Cara will not let anything happen to him.” Rikka considered amoment, her dark frown returning. “Lord Rahl is getting married?” Berdinenodded. “He is in love.”The other women glanced at one another as Rikka put her fists on her hips. “Inlove. A Lord Rahl, in love. Somehow, I can’t picture it.” She huffed. “He’s upto something. Well, never mind; we will figure it out. What of the others?”“Hally was killed awhile back. In battle, protecting Lord Rahl.”“A noble death. What of Raina?”Berdine swallowed, and forced her voice to stay level. “Raina died a short timeago. Killed by the enemy.”Rikka searched Berdine’s eyes. “I’m sorry, Berdine.” Berdine nodded. “Lord Rahlwept for her, as he did for Hally.” Silence echoed around the entryway as allthe other Mord-Sith stared at Berdine in disbelief.“This man is going to be trouble,” Rikka muttered.Berdine smiled. “I think he would say a similar thing of you.”Kahlan growled at the insistent knock. It appeared that ignoring it would notmake it go away. She kissed Richard and wrapped a blanket around herself. “Don’tmove. Lord Rahl. I’ll get rid of them.” Barefoot, she crossed the dim,windowless room. She squinted at the sudden light when she opened the door.“Zedd, what is it?” He was eating a piece of tava bread. He had a platter of itin his other hand. He offered her the tray.“I thought you might be hungry.”“Yes, thank you. Very thoughtful.” He took a bite of tava bread as his gazeroamed over her hair. He pointed at it with the rolled-up tava bread.“You will never get those tangles out, dear one.”“Thank you for your fashion advice.” She started to close the door. He put hishand against it. “The elders are becoming concerned. They would like to knowwhen they can have their spirit house back.”“Tell them that when I’m done with it, I’ll let them know.”Cara, scowling her best Mord-Sith scowl, stepped up behind him. “I will see thathe does not bother you again. Mother Confessor.”“Thank you, Cara.”Kahlan shut the door in his smiling face. She hurried across the floor, back toRichard. She set the platter aside, laid down,and enfolded Richard in her blanket. “A pesky in-law,” she explained.“I heard. Tava bread and tangled hair.”“Now, where were we?” He kissed her, and she remembered; he was showing her somemagic."},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsChapter 1
