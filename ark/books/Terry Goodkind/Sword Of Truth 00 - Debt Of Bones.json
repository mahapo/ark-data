The alliance of the Midlands, headed by the Mother Confessor herself, held council in the palace, and there, too, lived the Confessors. In her whole life, Abby had seen a Confessor only once before. The woman had come to see Abby's mother and Abby, not ten years at the time, had been unable to keep from staring at the Confessor's long hair. Other than her mother, no woman in Abby's small town of Coney Crossing was sufficiently important to have hair long enough to touch the shoulders. Abby's own fine, dark brown hair covered her ears but n o m o r e . Coming through the city on the way to the Keep, it had been hard for her not to gape at noble women with hair to their shoulders and even a little beyond. But the Confe ssor going up to the Keep, dressed in the s i mp l e , s a t i n y, b l a c k d r e s s o f a C o n f e s s o r , h a d h a i r t h a t r e a c h e d h a l f w a y d o w n h e r b a c k .

Even though Abby's mother had said it was untrue, that only the deliberate touch of such a woman could effect such a deed, Abby feared, this day o f a l l d a ys , t o t e s t t h e s t o r i e s . The old woman in front of her, clothed in layered skirts topped with one dyed of henna and mantled with a dark draping shawl, watched the s o l d i e r s p a s s a n d t h e n l e a n e d c l o s e r .

Her fair skin stood out all the more again st straight dark hair parted in the middle and readily reaching her shoulders. Some of the men had been whispering about the sight of the Sanderian officers, but at the sight of the woman everyone fell to silence. The four soldiers at the head of the stone bridge made way for the woman as she approached the supplicants. 'S o r c e r e s s , ’ t h e o l d w o ma n w h i s p e r e d t o A b b y.

Abby recognized the simple flaxen robes, decorated at the neck with yello w and red beads sewn in the ancient symbols of the profession. Some of her earliest memories were of being held in her mother's arms a n d t o u c h i n g b e a d s l i ke t h o s e s h e s a w n o w . The sorceress bowed her head to the people and then offered a smile. 'P l e a s e f o r gi ve u s f o r ke e p i n g yo u w a i t i n g o u t h e r e t h e w h o l e o f t h e d a y.

We hope none took offence at the delay.' The crowd mu mbled that they didn't. Abby doubted there was one among them bold enough to claim otherwise. 'H o w go e s t h e w a r ?

' As the sorceress turned back to the Keep and started out, three men strode up among the supplicants and put themselves at the head of the line, right in front of the old woman. The woman snatched a velvet s l e e v e . 'Who do you think you are,' she snapped, 'taking a place before me, when I've been here the whole of the day?' The oldest of the three, dressed in rich robes of dark purple with contrasting red sewn inside the length of the slits up the sleeves, lo oked t o b e a n o b l e w i t h h i s t w o a d vi s o r s , o r p e r h a p s gu a r d s . H e t u r n e d a gl a r e on the woman. 'You don't mind, do you?' It didn't sound at all to Abby like a question. The old woman took her hand back and fell mute. The man, the ends of his grey hair coiled on his shoulders, glanced at Abby. His hooded eyes gleamed with challenge. She swallowed and remained silent. She didn't have any objection, either, at least none she w a s w i l l i n g t o vo i c e . F o r a l l s h e kn e w , t h e n o b l e w a s i mp o r t a n t e n o u gh to see to it tha t she was denied an audience. She couldn't afford to take that c h a n c e n o w t h a t s h e w a s t h i s c l o s e . Abby was distracted by a tingling sensation from the bracelet. Blindly, her ringers glided over the wrist of the hand holding the sack. The wire bracelet felt warm. It hadn't done that since her mother had died. In the presence of so much magic as was at a place such as this, it didn't really s u r p r i s e h e r . T h e c r o w d m o v e d o u t t o f o l l o w t h e s o r c e r e s s . 'Mean, they are,' the woman whispered over her shoulder. 'Me an as a w i n t e r n i gh t , a n d j u s t a s c o l d . ' T h o s e m e n ? ' A b b y w h i s p e r e d b a c k . 'No.’ The woman tilted her head. 'Sorceresses. Wizards, too. That's who. All those born with the gift of magic. You better have something i mp o r t a n t i n t h a t s a c k, o r t h e w i za r d s mi gh t t u r n yo u t o d u s t f o r n o o t h e r reason than that they'd enjoy it.'

The road up the mountain, the stone bridge over the chasm, and then the opening under the portcullis appeared to be the only way into the Keep, unless you were a bird. Soaring walls of dark stone with high windows surrounded the gravel courtyard inside. There were a numb er of doors around the courtyard, and ahead, a roadway tunnelled deeper i n t o t h e K e e p . Despite the warm air, Abby was chilled to the bone by the place. She"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"w a s n 't s u r e t h a t t h e o l d w o ma n w a s n 't r i gh t a b o u t w i za r d s .

Abby had never seen a wizard before, nor did she know anyone who had, except for her mother, and her mother never spoke of them except to caution that where wizards were concerned, you couldn't trust even w h a t yo u s a w w i t h yo u r o w n eyes.

It had been simple magic - not a very impressive display of the gift - but several of the people behind fell to worried whispering as they passed on through the wide hall. It occurred to Abby that if th is little bit of conjuring would frighten them, then they had no business going to see w i z a r d s . They wended their way across the sunken floor of an imposing ante - room the likes of which Abby could never even have imagined. Red marble columns all around supported arches below balconies. In the centre of the room a fountain sprayed water high overhead. The water fell back to cascade down through a succession of ever larger scalloped bowls. Officers, sorceresses, and a variety of others sat about on white m a r b le benches or huddled in small groups, all engaged in seemingly e a r n e s t c o n ve r s a t i o n ma s ke d b y t h e s o u n d o f t h e w a t e r . In a much smaller room beyond, the sorceress gestured for them to be s e a t e d a t a l i n e o f c a r v e d o a k b e n c h e s a l o n g o n e w a l l . A b b y w a s b o n e - w e a r y a n d r e l i e ve d t o s i t a t l a s t . Light from windows above the benches lit three tapestries hanging on the high far wall.

In the centre of the cream - coloured marble floor, inset in brass lines, was a circle with a square inside it, its corners touching the circle. Inside t h e s q u a r e s a t a n o t h e r c i r c l e j u s t l a r ge e n o u gh t o t o u c h t h e i n s i d e s o f t h e square. The centre circle held an eight - pointed star. Lines radiated out from the points of the star, piercing all the way through both ci rcles, e ve r y o t h e r l i n e b i s e c t i n g a c o r n e r o f t h e s q u a r e . The design, called a Grace, was often drawn by those with the gift. The outer circle represented the beginnings of the infinity of the spirit world out beyond. The square represented the boundary separating the spirit world - the underworld, the world of the dead - from the inner circle, which represented the limits of the world of life. In the centre of it all w a s t h e s t a r , r e p r e s e n t i n g t h e L i gh t - t h e C r e a t o r .

It was said that only the spirits of those who did great wickedness in life would be denied the Creator's Light in the underworld. Abby knew she would be condemned to an eternity with the Keeper of darkness in t h e u n d e r w o r l d . S h e h a d n o c h o i c e . The sorceress folded her hands. 'An aide will come to get you each in turn. A wizard will see each of you. The war burns hot; please keep your petition brief.' She gazed down the line of people. 'It is out of a sincere obligation to those we serve that the wizards see supplicants, but please try to understand that individual desires are often detrimental to the greater good. By pausing to help one, then many are denied help. Thus, denial of a request is not a denial of your need, but acceptance of greater need. In times of peace it is rare for wizards to grant the narrow w a n t s o f supplicants. At a time like this, a time of a great war, it is almost unheard - of.

She twisted the lever stem on the lamp, lowering the wick as far as it would go without snuffing the flame; she didn't like sleeping in the dark in a strange place. Lying in bed, staring up at the water - stained ceiling, she prayed earnestly to the good spirits, despite knowing that they would ignore a request such as she made.

Not that man y, though, so much as dared to catch the attention of what appeared to be a red - leather - clad Mord - Sith. Zedd had told her, too, to keep the Mord - Sith's weapon in her fist.

Everywhere pikes and lances were stacked upright in circles with their points leaning together. Men - farriers, fletchers, blacksmiths and craftsmen of all sorts - worked through the night.

W h e n t h e y l o o ke d h e r way, she acted as if she were looking for someone, and she wasn't going to go easy on them when she found them.

As she marched along a crooked line of tents, she scratched at her wrist. Only when she went farther did she notice that it was the bracelet warming that made her wrist itch.

Needing to do something before they asked any questions, Abby scowled at them and marched towards the tent. She tried not to make any noise; the guards might think she was a Mord - Sith, but Mariska would not long be fooled. A glare from Abby turned the guards' eyes to the dark c o u n t r y s i d e . Her heart pounding nearly out of control, Abby gripped the tent - flap. She knew Jana would be inside. She told herself that she must not cry out when she saw her daughter.

Rather than take the shortest route back to Zedd, Abby followed the hills upriver to a place where the trees offered concealment almost to the water's edge.

Animate light twisted up around the wizard. Colours both dark and wondrous glimmered about him, cavorting with the shadowy forms undulating through the air. It was at once the most enchanting and the most frightening thing Abby had ever seen. No magic her mother conjured had ever seemed ... aware. But the most frightening thing by far was what hovered in the air before the wizard.

Arms of light twisted like smoke, lowering to tangle with the light radiating up around Zedd. The fog along the riverbank diffused sud d e n l y . In answer, Zedd spread his arms wide.
