That was whyhe’d stopped. That was what he’d been watching as the rest of them waited inuneasy silence.“Yes,” Richard said. He gestured over his shoulder without turning to look.“There are two more, back there.”Kahlan briefly scanned the dark jumble of rock, but she didn’t see any others.Lightly grasping the silver pommel with two fingers, Richard lifted his sword afew inches, checking that it was clear in its scabbard. A last fleeting glimmerof amber light played across his golden cape as he let the sword drop back inplace. In the gathering gloom of dusk, his familiar tall, powerful contourseemed as if it were no more than an apparition made of shadows.Just then, two more of the huge birds shot by right overhead. One, wingsstretched wide, let out a piercing scream as it banked into a tight glidingturn, circling once in assessment of the five people below before stroking itspowerful wings to catch its departing comrades in their swift journey west.This night they would find ample food.Kahlan expected that as Richard watched them he was thinking of the half brotherthat until just recently he hadn’t known existed. That brother now lay a hardday’s travel to the west in a place so naked to the burning sun that few peopleever ventured there. Fewer still ever returned. The searing heat, though, hadnot been the worst of it.Beyond those desolate lowlands, the dying light silhouetted a remote rim ofmountains, making them look as if they had been charred black by the furnace ofthe underworld itself. As dark as those mountains, as implacable, as perilous,the flight of five pursued the departing light.Jennsen, standing to the far side of Richard, watched in astonishment. “What inthe world ... ?”“Black-tipped races,” Richard said.Jennsen mulled over the unfamiliar name. “I’ve often watched hawks and falconsand such,” she said at last, “but I’ve never seen any birds of prey that hunt atnight, other than owls—and these aren’t owls.”As Richard watched the races, he idly gathered small pebbles from the crumblingjut of rock beside him, rattling them in a loose fist. “I’d never seen thembefore, either, until I came down here. People we’ve spoken with say they beganappearing only in the last year or two, depending on who’s telling the story.Everyone agrees, though, that they never saw the races before then.”“Last couple of years...” Jennsen wondered aloud.Almost against her will, Kahlan found herself recalling the stories they’dheard, the rumors, the whispered assertions.Richard cast the pebbles back down the hardpan trail. “I believe they’re relatedto falcons.”Jennsen finally crouched to comfort her brown goat, Betty, pressing up againsther skirts. “They can’t be falcons.” Betty’s little white twins, usually eithercapering, suckling, or sleeping, now huddled mute beneath their mother’s roundbelly. “They’re too big to be falcons—they’re bigger than hawks, bigger thangolden eagles. No falcon is that big.”Richard finally withdrew his glare from the birds and bent to help console thetrembling twins. One, eager for reassurance, anxiously peered up at him, lickingout its little pink tongue before deciding to rest a tiny black hoof in hispalm. With a thumb, Richard stroked the kids spindly white-haired leg.A smile softened his features as well as his voice. “Are you saying you choosenot to see what you’ve just seen, then?”Jennsen smoothed Betty’s drooping ears. “I guess the hair standing on end at theback of my neck must believe what I saw.”Richard rested his forearm across his knee as he glanced toward the grimhorizon. “The races have sleek bodies with round heads and long pointed wingssimilar to all the falcons I’ve seen. Their tails often fan out when they soarbut otherwise are narrow in flight.”Jennsen nodded, seeming to recognize his description of relevant attributes. ToKahlan, a bird was a bird. These, though, with red streaks on their chests andcrimson at the base of their flight feathers, she had come to recognize.“They’re fast, powerful, and aggressive,” Richard added. “I saw one easily chasedown a prairie falcon and snatch it out of midair in its taons.”Jennsen looked to be struck speechless by such an account. Richard had grown upin the vast forests of Westland and had gone on to be a woods guide. He knew agreat deal about the outdoors and about animals. Such an upbringing seemedexotic to Kahlan, who had grown up in a palace in the Midlands. She lovedlearning about nature from Richard, loved sharing his excitement over thewonders of the world, of life. Of course, he had long since come to be more thana woods guide. It seemed a lifetime ago when she’d first met him in those woodsof his, but in fact it had only been little more than two and a half years.Now they were a long way from Richard’s simple boyhood home or Kahlan’s grandchildhood haunts. Had they a choice, they would choose to be in either place, orjust about anywhere else, other than where they were. But at least they weretogether.After all she and Richard had been through—the dangers, the anguish,theheartache of losing friends and loved ones—Kahlan jealously savored every momentwith him, even if it was in the heart of enemy territory.In addition to only just finding out that he had a half brother, they had alsolearned that Richard had a half sister: Jennsen. From what they had gatheredsince they’d met her the day before, she, too, had grown up in the woods. It washeartwarming to see her simple and sincere joy at having discovered a closerelation with whom she had much in common. Only her fascination with her new bigbrother exceeded Jennsen’s wide-eyed curiosity about Kahlan and her mysteriousupbringing in the Confessors’ Palace in the far-off city of Aydindril.Jennsen had had a different mother than Richard, but the same brutal tyrant,Darken Rahl, had fathered them both. Jennsen was younger, just past twenty, withsky blue eyes and ringlets of red hair down onto her shoulders. She hadinherited some of Darken Rahl’s cruelly perfect features, but her maternalheritage and guileless nature altered them into bewitching femininity. WhileRichard’s raptor gaze attested to his Rahl paternity, his countenance, and hisbearing, so manifest in his gray eyes, were uniquely his own.“I’ve seen falcons rip apart small animals,” Jennsen said. “I don’t believe Imuch like thinking about a falcon that big, much less five of them together.”Her goat, Betty, looked to share the sentiment.“We take turns standing watch at night,” Kahlan said, answering Jennsen’sunspoken fear. While that was hardly the only reason, it was enough.In the eerie silence, withering waves of heat rose from the lifeless rock allaround. It had been an arduous day’s journey out from the center of the valleywasteland and across the surrounding flat plain, but none of them complainedabout the brutal pace. The torturous heat, though, had left Kahlan with apounding headache. While she was dead tired, she knew that in recent daysRichard had gotten far less sleep than any of the rest of them. She could readthat exhaustion in his eyes, if not in his stride.Kahlan realized, then, what it was that had her nerves so on edge: it was thesilence. There were no yips of coyotes, no howls of distant wolves, no flutterof bats, no rustle of a raccoon, no soft scramble of a vole—not even the buzzand chirp of insects. In the past, when all those things went silent it hadmeant potential danger. Here, it was dead silent because nothing lived in thisplace, no coyotes or wolves or bats or mice or even bugs. Few living things evertrespassed this barren land. Here, the night was as soundless as the stars.Despite the heat, the oppressive silence ran a chill shiver up through Kahlan’sshoulders.She peered off once more at the races barely still visible against the violetblush of the western sky. They, too, would not stay long in this wasteland wherethey did not belong.“Kind of unnerving to encounter such a menacing creature when you never evenknew such a thing existed,” Jennsen said. She used her sleeve to wipe sweat fromher brow as she changed the subject. “I’ve heard it said that a bird of preywheeling over you at the beginning of a journey is a warning.”Cara, until then content to remain silent, leaned in past Kahlan. “Just let meget close enough and I’ll pluck their wretched feathers.” Long blond hair,pulled back into the traditional single braid of her profession, framed Cara’sheated expression. “We’ll see how much of an omen they are, then.”Cara’s glare turned as dark as the races whenever she saw the huge birds. Beingswathed from head to foot in a protective layer of gauzy black cloth, as wereall of them except Richard, only added to her intimidating presence. WhenRichard had unexpectedly inherited rule, he had been further surprised todiscover that Cara and her sister Mord-Sith were part of the legacy.Richard returned the little white kid to its watchful mother and stood, hookinghis thumbs behind his multilayered leather belt. At each wrist, wide,leather-padded silver bands bearing linked rings and strange symbols seemed togather and reflect what little light remained. “I once had a hawk circle over meat the beginning of a journey.”“And what happened?” Jennsen asked, earnestly, as if his pronouncement mightsettle once and for all the old superstition.Richard’s smile widened into a grin. “I ended up marrying Kahlan.”Cara folded her arms. “That only proves it was a warning for the MotherConfessor, not you, Lord Rahl.”Richard’s arm gently encircled Kahlan’s waist. She smiled with him as she leanedagainst his embrace in answer to the wordless gesture. That that journey hadeventually brought them to be husband and wife seemed more astonishing thananything she would ever have dared dream. Women like her—Confessors—dared notdream of love. Because of Richard, she had dared and had gained it.Kahlan shuddered to think of the terrible times she had feared he was dead, orworse. There had been so many times she had ached to be with him, to simply feelhis warm touch, or to even be granted the mercy of knowing he was safe.Jennsen glanced at Richard and Kahlan to see that neither took Cara’s admonitionas anything but fond heckling. Kahlan supposed that to a stranger, especiallyone from the land of D’Hara, as was Jennsen, Cara’s gibes at Richard would defyreason; guards did not bait their masters, especially when their master was theLord Rahl, the master of D’Hara.Protecting the Lord Rahl with their lives had always been the blind duty of theMord-Sith. In a perverse way, Cara’s irreverence toward Richard was acelebration of her freedom, paid in homage to the one who had granted it.By free choice, the Mord-Sith had decided to be Richard’s closest protectors.They had given Richard no say in the matter. They often paid little heed to hisorders unless they deemed them important enough; they were, after all, now freeto pursue what was important to them, and what the Mord-Sith consideredimportant above all else was keeping Richard safe.Over time, Cara, their ever-present bodyguard, had gradually become like family.Now that family had unexpectedly grown.Jennsen, for her part, was awestruck to find herself welcomed. From what theyhad so far learned, Jennsen had grown up in hiding, always fearful that theformer Lord Rahl, her father, would finally find her and murder her as hemurdered any other ungifted offspring he found.Richard signaled to Tom and Friedrich, back with the wagon and horses, that theywould stop for the night. Tom lifted an arm in acknowledgment and then set tounhitching his team.No longer able to see the races in the dark void of the western sky, Jennsenturned back to Richard. “I take it their feathers are tipped in black.”Before Richard had a chance to answer, Cara spoke in a silken voice that waspure menace. “They look like death itself drips from the tips of theirfeathers—like the Keeper of the underworld has been using their wicked quills towrite death warrants.”Cara loathed seeing those birds anywhere near Richard or Kahlan. Kahlan sharedthe sentiment.Jennsen’s gaze fled Cara’s heated expression. She redirected her suspicion toRichard.“Are they causing you ... some kind of trouble?”Kahlan pressed a fist to her abdomen, against the ache of dread stirred by thequestion.Richard appraised Jennsen’s troubled eyes. “The races are tracking us.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Jennsen frowned. “What?”Richard gestured between Kahlan and himself. “The races, they’re tracking us.”“You mean they followed you out into this wasteland and they’re watching you,waiting to see if you’ll die of thirst or something so they can pick your bonesclean.”Richard slowly shook his head. “No, I mean they’re following us, keeping trackof where we are.”“I don’t understand how you can possibly know—”“We know,” Cara snapped. Her shapely form was as spare, as sleek, asaggressive-looking as the races themselves and, swathed in the black garb of thenomadic people who sometimes traveled the outer fringes of the vast desert, justas sinister-looking.With the back of his hand against her shoulder, Richard gently eased Cara backas he went on. “We were looking into it when Friedrich found us and told usabout you.”Jennsen glanced over at the two men back with the wagon. The sharp sliver ofmoon floating above the black drape of distant mountains provided just enoughlight for Kahlan to see that Tom was working at removing the trace chains fromhis big draft horses while Friedrich unsaddled the others.Jennsen’s gaze returned to search Richard’s eyes. “What have you been able tofind out, so far?”“We never had a chance to really find out much of anything. Oba, our surprisehalf brother lying dead back there, kind of diverted our attention when he triedto kill us.” Richard unhooked a waterskin from his belt. “But the races arestill watching us.”He handed Kahlan his waterskin, since she had left hers hanging on her saddle.It had been hours since they had last stopped. She was tired from riding andweary from walking when they had needed to rest the horses.Kahlan lifted the waterskin to her lips only to be reacquainted with how bad hotwater tasted. At least they had water. Without water, death came quickly in theunrelenting heat of the seemingly endless, barren expanse around the forsakenplace called the Pillars of Creation.Jennsen slipped the strap of her waterskin off her shoulder before hesitantlystarting again. “I know it’s easy to misconstrue things. Look at how I wastricked into thinking you wanted to kill me just like Darken Rahl had. I reallybelieved it, and there were so many things that seemed to me to prove it, but Ihad it all wrong. I guess I was just so afraid it was true, I believed it.”Richard and Kahlan both knew it hadn’t been Jennsen’s doing—she had merely beena means for others to get at Richard—but it had squandered precious time.Jennsen took a long drink. Still grimacing at the taste of the water, she liftedthe waterskin toward the empty desert behind them. “I mean, there isn’t muchalive out here—it might actually be that the races are hungry and are simplywaiting to see if you die out here and, because they do keep watching andwaiting, you’ve begun to think it’s more.” she gave Richard a demure glance,bolstered by a smile, as if hoping to cloak the admonishment as a suggestion.“Maybe that’s all it really is.”“They aren’t waiting to see if we die out here,” Kahlan said, wanting to end thediscussion so they could eat and Richard could get some sleep. “They werewatching us before we had to come here. They’ve been watching us since we wereback in the forests to the northeast. Now, let’s have some supper and—”“But why? That’s not the way birds behave. Why would they do that?”“I think they’re keeping track of us for someone,” Richard said. “Moreprecisely, I think someone is using them to hunt us.”Kahlan had known various people in the Midlands, from simple people living inthe wilds to nobles living in great cities, who hunted with falcons. This,though, was different. Even if she didn’t fully understand Richard’s meaning,much less the reasons for his conviction, she knew he hadn’t meant it in thetraditional sense.With abrupt realization, Jennsen paused in the middle of another drink. “That’swhy you’ve started scattering pebbles along the windblown places in the trail.”Richard smiled in confirmation. He took his waterskin when Kahlan handed itback. Cara frowned up at him as he took a long drink.“You’ve been throwing pebbles along the trail? Why?”Jennsen eagerly answered in his place. “The open rock gets blown clean by thewind. He’s been making sure that if anyone tries to sneak up on us in the dark,the pebbles strewn across those open patches will crunch underfoot and alertus.”Cara wrinkled a questioning brow at Richard. “Really?”He shrugged as he passed her his waterskin so that she wouldn’t have to dig hersout from beneath her desert garb. “Just a little extra precaution in case anyoneis close, and careless. Sometimes people don’t expect the simple things and thatcatches them up.”“But not you,” Jennsen said, hooking the strap of her waterskin back over hershoulder. “You think of even the simple things.”Richard chuckled softly. “If you think I don’t make mistakes, Jennsen, you’rewrong. While it’s dangerous to assume that those who wish you harm are stupid,it can’t hurt to spread out a little gravel just in case someone thinks they cansneak across windswept rock in the dark without being heard.”Any trace of amusement faded as Richard stared off toward the western horizonwhere stars had yet to appear. “But I fear that pebbles strewn along the groundwon’t do any good for eyes watching from a dark sky.” He turned back to Jennsen,brightening, as if remembering he had been speaking to her. “Still, everyonemakes mistakes.”Cara wiped droplets of water from her sly smile as she handed Richard back hiswaterskin. “Lord Rahl is always making mistakes, especially simple ones. That’swhy he needs me around.”“Is that right, little miss perfect?” Richard chided as he snatched thewaterskin from her hand. “Maybe if you weren’t ‘helping’ keep me out of trouble,we wouldn’t have black-tipped races shadowing us.”“What else could I do?” Cara blurted out. “I was trying to help—to protect youboth.” Her smile had withered. “I’m sorry, Lord Rahl.”Richard sighed. “I know,” he admitted as he reassuringly squeezed her shoulder.“We’ll figure it out.”Richard turned back to Jennsen. “Everyone makes mistakes. How a person dealswith their mistakes is a mark of their character.”Jennsen nodded as she thought it over. “My mother was always afraid of making amistake that would get us killed. She used to do things like you did, in case myfather’s men were trying to sneak up on us. We always lived in forests, though,so it was dry twigs, rather than pebbles, that she often scattered around us.”Jennsen pulled on a ringlet of her hair as she stared off into dark memories.“It was raining the night they came. If those men stepped on twigs, she wouldn’thave been able to hear it.” She ran trembling fingers over the silver hilt ofthe knife at her belt. “They were big, and they surprised her, but still, shegot one of them before they...”Darken Rahl had wanted Jennsen dead because she had been born ungifted. Anyruler of that bloodline killed offspring such as she. Richard and Kahlanbelieved that a person’s life was their own to live, and that birth did notqualify that right.Jennsen’s haunted eyes turned up to Richard. “She got one of them before theykilled her.”With one arm, Richard pulled Jennsen into a tender embrace. They all understoodsuch terrible loss. The man who had lovingly raised Richard had been killed byDarken Rahl himself. Darken Rahl had orderd the murders of all of Kahlan’ssister Confessors. The men who killed Jennsen’s mother, though, were men fromthe Imperial Order sent to trick her, to murder in order to make her believe itwas Richard who was after her.Kahlan felt a forlorn wave of helplessness at all they faced. She knew what itwas to be alone, afraid, and overwhelmed by powerful men filled with blind faithand the lust for blood, men devoutly believing that mankind’s salvation requiredslaughter.“I’d give anything for her to know that it wasn’t you who sent those men.”Jennsen’s soft voice held the dejected sum of what it was to have suffered sucha loss, to have no solution to the crushing solitude it left in its wake. “Iwish my mother could have known the truth, known what you two are really like.”“She’s with the good spirits and finally at peace,” Kahlan whispered insympathy, even if she now had reason to question the enduring validity of suchthings.Jennsen nodded as she swiped her fingers across her cheek. “What mistake did youmake, Cara?” she finally asked.Rather than be angered by the question, and perhaps because it had been asked ininnocent empathy, Cara answered with quiet candor. “It has to do with thatlittle problem we mentioned before.”“You mean it’s about the thing you want me to touch?”By the light of the moon’s narrow crescent, Kahlan could see Cara’s scowlreturn. “And the sooner the better.”Richard rubbed his fingertips across his brow. “I’m not sure about that.”Kahlan, too, thought that Cara’s notion was too simplistic.Cara threw her arms up. “But Lord Rahl, we can’t just leave it—”“Let’s get camp set up before it’s pitch dark,” Richard said in quiet command.“What we need right now is food and sleep.”For once, Cara saw the sense in his orders and didn’t object. When he hadearlier been out scouting alone, she had confided in Kahlan that she was worriedat how weary Richard looked and had suggested that, since there were enoughother people, they shouldn’t wake him for a turn at watch that night.“I’ll check the area,” Cara said, “and make sure there aren’t any more of thosebirds sitting on a rock watching us with those black eyes of theirs.”Jennsen peered around as if fearing that a black-tipped race might swoop in outof the darkness.Richard countermanded Cara’s plans with a dismissive shake of his head. “They’regone for now.”“You said they were tracking you.” Jennsen stroked Betty’s neck when the goatnudged her, seeking comfort. The twins were still hiding under their mother’sround belly. “I never saw them before now. They weren’t around yesterday, ortoday. They didn’t show up until just this evening. If they really were trackingyou, then they wouldn’t be gone for such a stretch. They’d have to stick closeto you all the time.”“They can leave us for a time in order to hunt—or to make us doubt our suspicionof their true intent—and, even if we keep going, they can easily find us whenthey return. That’s the advantage the black-tipped races have: they don’t needto watch us every moment.”Jennsen planted her fists on her hips. “Then how in the world could you possiblybe sure they’re tracking you?” She flicked a hand out toward the darknessbeyond. “You often see the same kind of birds. You see ravens, sparrows, geese,finches, hummingbirds, doves—how do you know that any one of them aren’tfollowing you and that the black-tipped races are?”“I know,” Richard said as he turned and started back toward the wagon. “Now,let’s get our things out and set up camp.”Kahlan caught Jennsen’s arm as she headed after him, about to renew herobjections. “Let him be for tonight, Jennsen?” Kahlan lifted an eyebrow.“Please? About this, anyway.”Kahlan was pretty sure that the black-tipped races really were following them,but it wasn’t so much an issue of her being sure of it herself. Rather, she hadconfidence in Richard’s word in matters such is this. Kahlan was versed inaffairs of state, protocol, ceremony, and royalty; she was familiar with variouscultures, the origins of ancient disputes between lands, and the history oftreaties; and she was conversant in any number of languages, including theduplicitous dialect of diplomacy. In such areas, Richard trusted her word whenshe expressed her conviction.In matters about something so odd as strange birds following them, she knewbetter than to question Richard’s word.Kahlan knew, too, that he didn’t yet have all the answers. She had seen him likethis before, distant and withdrawn, as he struggled to understand the importantconnections and patterns in relevant details only he perceived. She knew that heneeded to be left alone about it. Pestering him for answers before he had themonly served to distract him from what he needed to do.Watching Richard’s back as he walked away, Jennsen finally forced a smile ofagreement. Then, as if struck with another thought, her eyes widened. She leanedclose to Kahlan and whispered, “Is this about magic?”“We don’t know what it’s about.”Jennsen nodded. “I’ll help. Whatever I can do, I want to help.”For the time being, Kahlan kept her worries to herself as she circled an armaround the young woman’s shoulders in an appreciative embrace and walked herback toward the wagon."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3In the immense, silent void of night, Kahlan could clearly hear Friedrich, offto the side, speaking gently to the horses. He patted their shoulders or ran ahand along their flanks each time on his way by as he went about grooming andpicketing them for the night. With darkness shrouding the empty expanse beyond,the familiar task of caring for the animals made the unfamiliar surroundingsseem a little less forbidding.Friedrich was an older, unassuming man of average height. Despite his age, hehad undertaken a long and difficult journey to the Old World to find Richard.Friedrich had undertaken that journey, carrying with him important information,soon after his wife had died. The terrible sadness of that loss still hauntedhis gentle features. Kahlan supposed that it always would.In the dim light, she saw Jennsen smile as Tom looked her way. A boyish grinmomentarily overcame the big, blond-headed D’Haran when he spotted her, but hequickly bent back to work, pulling bedrolls from a corner beneath the seat. Hestepped over supplies in his wagon and handed a load down to Richard.“There’s no wood for a fire, Lord Rahl.” Tom rested a foot on the chafing rail,laying a forearm over his bent knee. “But, if you like, I have a little charcoalto use for cooking.”“What I’d really like is for you to stop calling me ‘Lord Rahl.’ If we’reanywhere near the wrong people and you slip up and call me that, we’ll all be ina great deal of trouble.”Tom grinned and patted the ornate letter “R” on the silver handle of the knifeat his belt. “Not to worry, Lord Rahl. Steel against steel.”Richard sighed at the oft-repeated maxim involving the bond of the D’Haranpeople to their Lord Rahl, and he to them. Tom and Friedrich had promised theywouldn’t use Richard’s and Kahlan’s titles around other people. A lifetime’shabits were difficult to change, though, and Kahlan knew that they feltuncomfortable not using titles when they were so obviously alone.“So,” Tom said as he handed down the last bedroll, “would you like a small firefor cooking?”“Hot as it is, it seems to me we could do without any more heat.” Richard setthe bedrolls atop a sack of oats already unloaded. “Besides, I’d prefer not totake the time. I’d like to be on our way at first light and we need to get agood rest.”“Can’t argue with you there,” Tom said, straightening his big frame. “I don’tlike us being so out in the open where we could easily be spotted.”Richard swept his hand in a suggestive arc across the dark vault above.Tom cast a wary eye skyward. He nodded reluctantly before turning back to thetask of digging out tools to mend the breeching and wooden buckets to water thehorses. Richard put a boot on a spoke of the cargo wagon’s stout rear wheel andclimbed up to help.Tom, a shy but cheerful man who had appeared only the day before, right afterthey’d encountered Jennsen, looked to be a merchant who hauled trade goods.Hauling goods in his wagon, Kahlan and Richard had learned, gave him an excuseto travel where and when he needed as a member of a covert group whose trueprofession was to protect the Lord Rahl from unseen plots and threats.Speaking in a low voice, Jennsen leaned closer to Kahlan. “Vultures can tellyou, from a great distance, where a kill lies—by the way they circle and gather,I mean. I guess I can see how the races could be like that—birds that someonecould spot from afar in order to know there was something below.”Kahlan didn’t say anything. Her head ached, she was hungry, and she just wantedto go to sleep, not to discuss things she couldn’t answer. She wondered how manytimes Richard had viewed her own insistent questions in the same way she nowviewed Jennsen’s. Kahlan silently vowed to try to be at least half as patient asRichard always was.“The thing is,” Jennsen went on, matter-of-factly, “how would someone get birdsto ... well, you know, circle around you like vultures over a carcass in orderto know where you were?” Jennsen leaned in again and whispered so as to be surethat Richard wouldn’t hear. “Maybe they’re sent with magic to follow specificpeople.”Cara fixed Jennsen with a murderous glare. Kahlan idly wondered if the Mord-Sithwould clobber Richard’s sister, or extend her leniency because she was family.Discussions about magic, especially in the context of its danger to Richard orKahlan, made Cara testy. Mord-Sith were fearless in the face of death, but theydid not like magic and weren’t shy about making their distaste clear.In a way, such hostility toward magic characterized the nature and purpose ofMord-Sith; they were singularly able to appropriate the gifted’s power and useit to destroy them. Mord-Sith had been mercilessly trained to be ruthless attheir task. It was from the madness of this duty that Richard had freed them.It seemed obvious enough to Kahlan, though, that if the races really weretracking them it would have to involve conjuring of some sort. It was thequestions raised by that assumption that so worried her.When Kahlan didn’t debate the theory, Jennsen asked, “Why do you think someonewould be using the races to track you?”Kahlan lifted an eyebrow at the young woman. “Jennsen, we’re in the middle ofthe Old World. Being hunted in enemy territory is hardly surprising.”“I guess you’re right,” Jennsen admitted. “It just seems that there would haveto be more to it.” Despite the heat, she rubbed her arms as if a chill had justrun through her. “You have no idea how much Emperor Jagang wants to catch you.”Kahlan smiled to herself. “Oh, I think I do.”Jennsen watched Richard a moment as he filled the buckets with water frombarrels carried in the wagon. Richard leaned down and handed one to Friedrich.Ears turned attentively ahead, the horses all watched, eager for a drink. Betty,also watching as her twins suckled, bleated her longing for a drink. Afterfilling the buckets, Richard submerged his waterskin to fill it, too.Jennsen shook her head and looked again into Kahlan’s eyes. “Emperor Jagangtricked me into thinking Richard wanted me dead.” She glanced briefly over atthe men engaged in their work before she went on. “I was there with Jagang whenhe attacked Aydindril.”Kahlan felt as if her heart came up in her throat at hearing firsthandconfirmation of that brute invading the place where she’d grown up. She didn’tthink she could bear to hear the answer, but she had to ask. “Did he destroy thecity?”After Richard had been captured and taken from her, Kahlan, with Cara at herside, had led the D’Haran army against Jagang’s vast invading horde from the OldWorld. Month after month, Kahlan and the army fought against impossible odds,retreating all the way up through the Midlands.By the time they lost the battle for the Midlands, it had been over a year sinceKahlan had seen Richard; he had seemingly been cast into oblivion. When at lastshe learned where he was being held, Kahlan and Cara had raced south, to the OldWorld, only to arrive just as Richard ignited a firestorm of revolution in theheart of Jagang’s homeland.Before she’d left, Kahlan had evacuated Aydindril and left the Confessors’Palace empty of all those who called it home. Life, not a place, was whatmattered.“He never got a chance to destroy the city,” Jennsen said. “When we arrived atthe Confessors’ Palace, Emperor Jagang thought he had you and Richard cornered.But out in front waited a spear holding the head of the emperor’s reveredspiritual leader: Brother Narev.” Her voice lowered meaningfully. “Jagang foundthe message left with the head.”Kahlan remembered well the day Richard had sent the head of that evil man, alongwith a message for Jagang, on the long journey north. “ ‘Compliments of RichardRahl.’ ““That’s right,” Jennsen said. “You can’t imagine Jagang’s rage.” She paused tobe certain Kahlan heeded her warning. “He’ll do anything to get his hands on youand Richard.”Kahlan hardly needed Jennsen to tell her how much Jagang wanted them.“All the more reason to get away—hide somewhere,” Cara said.“And the races?” Kahlan reminded her.Cara cast a suggestive look at Jennsen before speaking in a quiet voice toKahlan. “If we do something about the rest of it, maybe that problem would goaway, too.” Cara’s goal was to protect Richard. She would be perfectly happy toput him in a hole somewhere and board him over if she thought doing so wouldkeep harm from reaching him.Jennsen waited, watching the two of them. Kahlan wasn’t at all sure there wasanything Jennsen could do. Richard had thought it over and had come to haveserious doubts. Kahlan had been amply skeptical without Richard’s doubts. Still...“Maybe” was all she said.“If there’s anything I can do, I want to try it.” Jennsen fussed with a buttonon the front of her dress. “Richard doesn’t think I can help. If it involvesmagic, wouldn’t he know? Richard is a wizard, he would know about magic.”Kahlan sighed. There was so much more to it. “Richard was raised in Westland—farfrom the Midlands, even farther from D’Hara. He grew up in isolation from therest of the New World, never knowing anything at all about the gift. Despite allhe’s so far learned and some of the remarkable things he’s accomplished, hestill knows very little of his birthright.”They had already told Jennsen this, but she seemed skeptical, as if shesuspected there was a certain amount of exaggeration in what they were tellingher about Richard’s unfamiliarity with his own gift. Her big brother had, afterall, in one day rescued her from a lifetime of terror. Such a profound awakeningprobably seemed tangled in magic to one so devoid of it. Perhaps it was.“Well, if Richard is as ignorant of magic as you say,” Jennsen pressed in ameaningful voice, finally having arrived at the heart of her purpose, “thenmaybe we shouldn’t worry so much about what he thinks. Maybe we should just nottell him and go ahead and do whatever it is Cara wants me to do to fix yourproblem and get the races off your backs.”Nearby, Betty contentedly licked clean her little white twins. The swelteringdarkness and vast weight of the surrounding silence seemed as eternal as deathitself.Kahlan gently took ahold of Jennsen’s collar. “I grew up walking the corridorsof the Wizard’s Keep and the Confessors’ Palace. I know a lot about magic.”She pulled the young woman closer. “I can tell you that such naive notions, whenapplied to ominous matters like this, can easily get people killed. There isalways the possibility that it’s as simple as you fancy, but most likely it’scomplex beyond your imagination and any rash attempt at a remedy could ignite aconflagration that would consume us all. Added to all that is the grave peril ofnot knowing how someone, such as yourself, someone so pristinely ungifted as tobe forewarned of in that ancient book Richard has, might affect the equation.“There are times when there is no choice but to act immediately; even then itmust be with your best judgment, using all your experience and everything you doknow. As long as there’s a choice, though, you don’t act in matters of magicuntil you can be sure of the consequence. You don’t ever just take a stab in thedark.”Kahlan knew all too well the terrible truth of such an admonition. Jennsenseemed unconvinced. “But if he doesn’t really know much about magic, his fearsmight only be—”“I’ve walked through dead cities, walked among the mutilated bodies of men,women, and children the Imperial Order has left in their wake. I’ve seen youngwomen not as old as you make thoughtless, innocent mistakes and end up chainedto a stake to be used by gangs of soldiers for days before being tortured todeath just for the amusement of men who get sick pleasure out of raping a womanas she’s in the throes of death.”Kahlan gritted her teeth as memories flashed mercilessly before her mind’s eye.She tightened her grip on Jennsen’s collar.“All of my sister Confessors died in such a fashion, and they knew about theirpower and how to use it. The men who caught them knew, too, and used thatknowledge against them. My closest girlhood friend died in my arms after suchmen were finished with her.“Life means nothing to people like that; they worship death.“Those are the kind of people who butchered your mother. Those are the kind ofpeople who will have us, too, if we make a mistake. Those are the kind of peoplelaying traps for us—including traps constructed of magic.“As for Richard not knowing about magic, there are times when he is so ignorantof the simplest things that I can scarcely believe it and must remind myselfthat he grew up not being taught anything at all about his gift. In thosethings, I try to be patient and to guide him as best I can. He takes veryseriously what I tell him.“There are other times when I suspect that he actually grasps complexities ofmagic that neither I nor anyone alive has ever before fathomed or even so muchas imagined. In those things he must be his own guide.“The lives of a great many good people depend on us not making carelessmistakes, especially careless mistakes with magic. As the Mother Confessor I’llnot allow reckless whim to jeopardize all those lives. Now, do you understandme?”Kahlan had nightmares about the things she had seen, about those who had beencaught, about those who had made a simple mistake and paid the price with theirlife. She was not many years beyond Jennsen’s age, but right then that gulf wasvastly more than a mere handful of years.Kahlan gave Jennsen’s collar a sharp yank. “Do you understand me?”Wide-eyed, Jennsen swallowed. “Yes, Mother Confessor.” Finally, her gaze broketoward the ground.Only then did Kahlan release her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4Anyone hungry?” Tom called to the three women.Richard pulled a lantern from the wagon and, after finally getting it lit with asteel and flint, set it on a shelf of rock. He passed a suspicious look amongthe three women as they approached, but apparently thought better of sayinganything.As Kahlan sat close at Richard’s side, Tom offered him the first chunk he slicedfrom a long length of sausage. When Richard declined, Kahlan accepted it. Tomsliced off another piece and passed it to Cara and then another to Friedrich.Jennsen had gone to the wagon to search through her pack. Kahlan thought thatmaybe she just wanted to be alone a moment to collect herself. Kahlan knew howharsh her words had sounded, but she couldn’t allow herself to do Jennsen thedisservice of coddling her with pleasing lies.With Jennsen reassuringly close by, Betty lay down beside Rusty, Jennsen’s redroan mare. The horse and the goat were fast friends. The other horses seemedpleased by the visitor and took keen interest in her two kids, giving them agood sniff when they came close enough.When Jennsen walked over displaying a small piece of carrot, Betty rose up in arush. Her tail went into a blur of expectant wagging. The horses whinnied andtossed their heads, hoping not to be left out. Each in turn received a smalltreat and a scratch behind the ears.Had they a fire, they could have cooked a stew, rice, or beans; griddled somebannock; or maybe have made a nice soup. Despite how hungry she was, Kahlandidn’t think she would have had the energy to cook, so she was content to settlefor what was at hand. Jennsen retrieved strips of dried meat from her pack,offering them around. Richard declined this, too, instead eating hard travelbiscuits, nuts, and dried fruit.“But don’t you want any meat?” Jennsen asked as she sat down on her bedrollopposite him. “You need more than that to eat. You need something substantial.”“I can’t eat meat. Not since the gift came to life in me.”Jennsen’s wrinkled her nose with a puzzled look. “Why would your gift not allowyou to eat meat?”Richard leaned to the side, resting his weight on an elbow as he momentarilysurveyed the sweep of stars, searching for the words to explain. “Balance, innature,” he said at last, “is a condition resulting from the interaction of allthings in existence. On a simple level, look at how predators and prey are inbalance. If there were too many predators, and the prey were all eaten, then thethriving predators, too, would end up starving and dying out.“The lack of balance would be deadly to both prey and predator; the world, forthem both, would end. They exist in balance because acting in accordance withtheir nature results in balance. Balance is not their conscious intent.“People are different. Without our conscious intent, we don’t necessarilyachieve the balance that our survival often requires.“We must learn to use our minds, to think, if we’re to survive. We plant crops,we hunt for fur to keep us warm, or raise sheep and gather their wool and learnhow to weave it into cloth. We have to learn how to build shelter. We balancethe value of one thing against another and trade goods to exchange what we’vemade for what we need that others have made or grown or built or woven orhunted.“We balance what we need with what we know of the realities of the world. Webalance what we want against our rational self-interest, not against fulfillinga momentary impulse, because we know that our long-term survival requires it. Weuse wood to build a fire in the hearth in order to keep from freezing on awinter night, but, despite how cold we might be when we’re building the fire, wedon’t build the fire too big, knowing that to do so would risk burning ourshelter down after we’re warm and asleep.”“But people also act out of shortsighted selfishness, greed, and lust for power.They destroy lives.” Jennsen lifted her arm out toward the darkness. “Look atwhat the Imperial Order is doing—and succeeding at. They don’t care aboutweaving wool or building houses or trading goods. They slaughter people just forconquest. They take what they want.”“And we resist them. We’ve learned to understand the value of life, so we fightto reestablish reason. We are the balance.”Jennsen hooked some of her hair back behind an ear. “What does all this have todo with not eating meat?”“I was told that wizards, too, must balance themselves, their gift—theirpower—in the things they do. I fight against those, like the Imperial Order, whowould destroy life because it has no value to them, but that requires that I dothe same terrible thing by destroying what is my highest value—life. Since mygift has to do with being a warrior, abstinence from eating meat is believed tobe the balance for the killing I’m forced to do.”“What happens if you eat meat?”Kahlan knew that Richard had cause, from only the day before, to need thebalance of not eating meat.“Even the idea of eating meat nauseates me. I’ve done it when I’ve had to, butit’s something I avoid if at all possible. Magic deprived of balance has graveconsequences, just like building a fire in the hearth.”The thought occurred to Kahlan that Richard carried the Sword of Truth, andperhaps that weapon also imposed its own need for balance. Richard had beenrightly named the Seeker of Truth by the First Wizard himself, Zeddicus Zu’lZorander—Zedd, Richard’s grandfather, the man who had helped raise him, and fromwhom Richard had additionally inherited the gift. Richard’s gift had been passeddown not only from the Rahl bloodline, but the Zorander as well. Balance indeed.Rightly named Seekers had been carrying that very same sword for nearly threethousand years. Perhaps Richard’s understanding of the need for balance hadhelped him to survive the things he’d faced.With her teeth, Jennsen tugged off a strip of dried meat as she thought it over.“So, because you have to fight and sometimes kill people, you can’t eat meat asthe balance for that terrible act?”Richard nodded as he chewed dried apricots.“It must be dreadful to have the gift,” Jennsen said in a quiet voice. “To havesomething so destructive that it requires you balance it in some way.”She looked away from Richard’s gray eyes. Kahlan knew what a difficultexperience it sometimes was to meet his direct and incisive gaze.“I used to feel that way,” he said, “when I first was named the Seeker and giventhe sword, and even more so later, when I learned that I had the gift. I didn’twant to have the gift, didn’t want the things the gift could do, just as Ihadn’t wanted the sword because of the things in me that I thought shouldn’tever be brought out.”“But now you don’t mind as much, having the sword, or the gift?”“You have a knife and have used it.” Richard leaned toward her, holding out hishands. “You have hands. Do you hate your knife, or hands?”“Of course not. But what does that have to do with having the gift?”“Having the gift is simply how I was born, like being born male, or female, orwith blue, or brown, or green eyes—or with two hands. I don’t hate my handsbecause I could potentially strangle someone with them. It’s my mind thatdirects my hands. My hands don’t act of their own accord; to think so is toignore the truth of what each thing is, its true nature. You have to recognizethe truth of things if you’re to achieve balance—or come to truly understandanything, for that matter.”Kahlan wondered why she didn’t require balance the way Richard did. Why was itso vital for him, but not for her? Despite how much she wanted to go to sleep,she couldn’t keep silent. “I often use my Confessor’s power for that same end—tokill—and I don’t have to keep in balance by not eating meat.”“The Sisters of the Light claim that the veil that separates the world of theliving from the world of the dead is maintained through magic. More precisely,they claim that the veil is here,” Richard said, tapping the side of his temple,“in those of us who have the gift—wizards and to a lesser extent sorceresses.They claim that balance for those of us with the gift is essential because inus, within our gift, resides the veil, making us, in essence, the guardians ofthe veil, the balance between worlds.“Maybe they’re right. I have both sides of the gift: Additive and Subtractive.Maybe that makes it different for me. Maybe having both sides makes it moreimportant than usual for me to keep my gift in balance.”Kahlan wondered just how much of that might be true. She feared to think howextensively the balance of magic itself had been altered by her doing.The world was unraveling, in more ways than one. But there had been no choice.Cara dismissively waggled a piece of dried meat before them. “All this balancebusiness is just a message from the good spirits—in that other world—tellingLord Rahl to leave such fighting to us. If he did, then he wouldn’t have toworry about balance, or what he can and can’t eat. If he would stop puttinghimself in mortal danger then his balance would be just fine and he could eat awhole goat.”Jennsen’s eyebrows went up.“You know what I mean,” Cara grumbled.Tom leaned in. “Maybe Mistress Cara is right, Lord Rahl. You have people toprotect you. You should let them do it and you could better put your abilitiesto the task of being the Lord Rahl.”Richard closed his eyes and rubbed his temples with his fingertips. “If I had towait for Cara to save me all the time, I’m afraid I’d have to do without ahead.”Cara rolled her eyes at his wisp of a smile and went back to her sausage.Studying his face in the dim light as he sucked on a small bite of driedbiscuit, Kahlan thought that Richard didn’t look well, and that it was more thansimply being exhausted. The soft glow of light from the lantern lit one side ofhis face, leaving the rest in darkness, as if he were only half there, half inthis world and half in the world of darkness, as if he were the veil between.She leaned close and brushed back the hair that had fallen across his forehead,using the excuse to feel his brow. He felt hot, but they were all hot andsweating, so she couldn’t really tell if he had a fever, but she didn’t thinkso.Her hand slipped down to cup his face, kindling his smile. She thought she couldlose herself in the pleasure of just looking into his eyes. It made her heartache with joy to see his smile. She smiled back, a smile she gave no one buthim.Kahlan had an urge to kiss him, too, but there always seemed to be people aroundand the kind of kiss she really wanted to give him wasn’t the kind of kiss yougave in front of others.“It seems so hard to imagine,” Friedrich said to Richard. “I mean, the Lord Rahlhimself, not knowing about the gift as he grew up.” Friedrich shook his head.“It seems so hard to believe.”“My grandfather, Zedd, has the gift,” Richard said as he leaned back. “He wantedto help raise me away from magic, much like Jennsen—hidden away where DarkenRahl couldn’t get at me. That’s why he wanted me raised in Westland, on theother side of the boundary from magic.”“And even your grandfather—a wizard—never let on that he was gifted?” Tom asked.“No, not until Kahlan came to Westland. Looking back on it, I realize that therewere a lot of little things that told me he was more than he seemed, but growingup I never knew. He just always seemed wizardly to me in the sense that heseemed to know about everything in the world around us. He opened up that worldfor me, making me want to all the time know more, but the gift wasn’t ever themagic he showed me—life was what he showed me.”“It’s really true, then,” Friedrich said, “that Westland was set aside to be aplace without magic.”Richard smiled at the mention of his home of Westland. “It is. I grew up in theHartland woods, right near the boundary, and I never saw magic. Except maybe forChase.”“Chase?” Tom asked.“A friend of mine—a boundary warden. Fellow about your size, Tom. Whereas youserve to protect the Lord Rahl, Chase’s charge was the boundary, or rather,keeping people away from it. He told me that his job was keeping away theprey—people—so that the things that come out of the boundary wouldn’t get anystronger. He worked to maintain balance.” Richard smiled to himself. “He didn’thave the gift, but I often thought that the things that man could pull off hadto be magic.”Friedrich, too, was smiling at Richard’s story. “I lived in D’Hara all my life.When I was young those men who guarded the boundary were my heroes and I wantedto join them.”“Why didn’t you?” Richard asked.“When the boundary went up I was too young.” Friedrich stared off into memories,then sought to change the subject. “How much longer until we get out of thiswasteland, Lord Rahl?”Richard looked east, as if he could see off into the black of night beyond thedim circle of lantern light. “If we keep up our pace, a few more days and we’llbe out of the worst of it, I’d say. It gets rockier now as the ground continuesto rise up toward the distant mountains. The traveling will be more difficultbut at least as we get higher it shouldn’t be quite so hot.”“How far to this thing that... that Cara thinks I should touch?” Jennsen asked.Richard studied her face a moment. “I’m not so sure that’s a good idea.”“But we are going there?”“Yes.”Jennsen picked at the strip of dried meat. “What is this thing that Caratouched, anyway? Cara and Kahlan don’t seem to want to tell me.”“I asked them not to tell you,” Richard said.“But why? If we’re going to see it, then why wouldn’t you want to tell me whatit is?”“Because you don’t have the gift,” Richard said. “I don’t want to influence whatyou see.”Jennsen blinked. “What difference could that make?”“I haven’t had time to translate much of it yet, but from what I gather from thebook Friedrich brought me, even those who don’t have the gift, in the commonsense, have at least some tiny spark of it. In that way they are able tointeract with the magic in the world—much like you must be born with eyes to seecolor. Being born with eyes, you can see and understand a grand painting, eventhough you may not have the ability to create such a painting yourself.“The gifted Lord Rahl gives birth to only one gifted heir. He may have otherchildren, but rarely are any of them ever also gifted. Still, they do have thisinfinitesimal spark, as does everyone else. Even they, so to speak, can seecolor.“The book says, though, that there are rare offspring of a gifted Lord Rahl,like you, who are born devoid of any trace whatsoever of the gift. The bookcalls them pillars of Creation. Much like those born without eyes can’t perceivecolor, those born like you can’t perceive magic.“But even that is imprecise, because with you it’s more than simply notperceiving magic. For someone born blind, color exists, they just aren’t able tosee it. For you, though, it isn’t that you simply can’t perceive magic; for youmagic does not exist—it isn’t a reality.”“How is such a thing possible?” Jennsen asked.“I don’t know,” Richard said. “When our ancestors created the bond of the LordRahl to the D’Haran people, it carried the unique ability to consistently bear agifted heir. Magic needs balance. Maybe they had to make it work like this, havethis counter of those born like you, in order for the magic they created towork; maybe they didn’t realize what would happen and inadvertently created thebalance.”Jennsen cleared her throat. “What would happen if... you know, if I were to havechildren?”Richard surveyed Jennsen’s eyes for what seemed a painfully long time. “Youwould bear offspring like you.”Jennsen sat forward, her hands reflecting her emotional entreaty. “Even if Imarry someone with that spark of the gift? Someone able to perceive color, asyou called it? Even then my child would be like me?”“Even then and every time,” Richard said with quiet certitude. “You are a brokenlink in the chain of the gift. According to the book, once the line of all thoseborn with the spark of the gift, including those with the gift as it is in me,going back thousands of years, going back forever, is broken, it is broken forall time. It cannot be restored. Once forfeited in such a marriage, nodescendant of that line can ever restore the link to the gift. When thesechildren marry, they too would be as you, breaking the chain in the line ofthose they marry. Their children would be the same, and so on.“That’s why the Lord Rahl always hunted down ungifted offspring and eliminatedthem. You would be the genesis of something the world has never had before:those untouched by the gift. Every offspring of every descendant would end theline of the spark of the gift in everyone they married. The world, mankind,would be changed forever.“This is the reason the book calls those like you ‘pillars of Creation.’ “The silence seemed brittle.“And that’s what this place is called, too,” Tom said as he pointed a thumb backover his shoulder, seeming to feel the need to say something into the quiet,“the Pillars of Creation.” He looked at the faces surrounding the weak lightcoming from the sputtering lantern. “Seems a strange coincidence that both thoselike Jennsen and this place would be called the same thing.”Richard stared off into the darkness toward that terrible place where Kahlanwould have died had he made a mistake with the magic involved. “I don’t thinkit’s a coincidence. They are connected, somehow.”The book—The Pillars of Creation—describing those born like Jennsen was writtenin the ancient language of High D’Haran. Few people still living understood HighD’Haran. Richard had begun to learn it in order to unravel important informationin other books they’d found that were from the time of the great war.That war, extinguished three thousand years before, had somehow ignited onceagain, and was burning uncontrolled through the world. Kahlan feared to think ofthe central—if inadvertent—part she and Richard had played in making itpossible.Jennsen leaned in, as if looking for some thread of hope. “How do you think thetwo might be connected?”Richard let out a tired sigh. “I don’t know, yet.”With a finger, Jennsen rolled a pebble around in a small circle, leaving a tinyrut in the dust. “All of those things about me being a pillar of Creation, beingthe break in the link of the gift, makes me feel somehow... dirty.”“Dirty?” Tom asked, looking hurt to hear her even suggest such a thing.“Jennsen, why would you feel that way?”“Those like me are also called ‘holes in the world.’ I guess I can see why,now.”Richard leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “I know what it’s liketo feel regret for how you were born, for what you have, or don’t have. I hatedbeing born the way I was—with the gift. But I came to realize how senseless suchfeelings are, how completely wrong it was to think that way.”“But it’s different with me,” she said as she pushed at the sand with a finger,erasing the little ruts she’d made with the pebble. “There are others likeyou—wizards or sorceresses with the gift. Everyone else can at least see colors,as you put it. I’m the only one like this.”Richard gazed at his half sister, a beautiful, bright, ungifted half sister thatany previous Lord Rahl would have murdered on the spot, and was overcome with aradiant smile. “Jennsen, I think of you as born pure. You’re like a newsnowflake, different than any other, and startlingly beautiful.”Looking up at him, Jennsen was overcome with a smile of her own. “I neverthought of it that way.” Her smile withered as she thought about his words. “Butstill, I’d be destroying—”“You would be creating, not destroying,” Richard said. “Magic exists. It cannotpossess the ‘right’ to exist. To think so would be to ignore the true nature—thereality—of things. People, if they don’t take the lives of others, have theright to live their life. You can’t say that because you were born with red hairyou supplanted the ‘right’ of brown hair to be born on your head.”Jennsen giggled at such a concept. It was good to see the smile taking firmerhold. By the look on Tom’s face, he agreed.“So,” Jennsen finally asked, “what about this thing we’re going to see?”“If the thing Cara touched has been altered by someone with the gift, then sinceyou can’t see the magic, you might see something we can’t see: what lies beneaththat magic.”Jennsen rubbed the edge of her boot heel. “And you think that will tell yousomething important?”“I don’t know. It may be useful, or it may not, but I want to know what yousee—with your special vision—without any suggestion from us.”“If you’re so worried about it, why did you leave it? Aren’t you afraid someonemight come across it and take it?”“I worry about a lot of things,” Richard said.“Even if it really is something altered by magic and she sees it for what ittruly is,” Cara said, “that doesn’t mean that it still isn’t what it seems tous, or that it isn’t just as dangerous.”Richard nodded. “At least we’ll know that much more about it. Anything we learnmight help us in some way.”Cara scowled. “I just want her to turn it back over.”Richard gave her a look designed to keep her from saying anything else about it.Cara huffed, leaned in, and took one of Richard’s dried apricots. She scowled athim as she popped the apricot into her mouth.As soon as supper was finished, Jennsen suggested that they pack all the foodsafely back in the wagon so that Betty wouldn’t help herself to it in the night.Betty was always hungry. At least, with her two kids, she now had a taste ofwhat it was like to be badgered for food.Kahlan thought that Friedrich should be given consideration, because of his age,so she asked him if he’d like to take first watch. First watch was easier thanbeing awakened in the middle of the night to stand watch between stretches ofsleep. He smiled his appreciation as he nodded his agreement.After opening his and Kahlan’s bedroll, Richard doused the lantern. The nightwas sweltering but crystal clear so that, after Kahlan’s eyes adjusted, thesweep of stars was enough to see by, if not very well. One of the white twinsthought the newly unfurled bedrolls would be a perfect place to romp. Kahlanscooped up the leggy bundle and returned it to its tail-wagging mother.As she lay down beside Richard, Kahlan saw the dark shape of Jennsen curl up byBetty and collect the twins in the tender bed of her arms, where they quicklysettled down.Richard leaned over and gently kissed Kahlan’s lips. “I love you, you know.”“If we’re ever alone, Lord Rahl,” Kahlan whispered back, “I’d like to have morethan a quick kiss.”He laughed softly and kissed her forehead before lying on his side, away fromher. She had been expecting an intimate promise, or at least a lightheartedremark.Kahlan curled up behind him and rested a hand on his shoulder. “Richard,” shewhispered, “are you all right?”It took him longer to answer than she would have liked. “I have a splittingheadache.”She wanted to ask what kind of headache, but she didn’t want the tiny spark offear she harbored to gain the glow of credence by voicing it aloud.“It’s different from the headaches I had before,” Richard said, as if in answerto her thoughts. “I suppose it’s this wicked heat on top of not having had anysleep for so long.”“I suppose.” Kahlan bunched up the blanket she was using for a pillow to make alump that would press against the sore spot at the base of her skull. “The heatis making my head pound, too.” She gently rubbed the back of his shoulder. “Havea good sleep, then.”She was exhausted and aching all over, and it felt delicious to lie down. Herhead felt better, too, with the soft lump of blanket pressed against the back ofher neck. With her hand resting against Richard’s shoulder, feeling his slowbreathing, Kahlan fell into a dead sleep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5As tired as she was, it was a marvelous sensation being beside Richard andletting herself go, letting her concerns and worries go for the time being, andso effortlessly sinking into sleep.But the sleep seemed only just started when she woke to find Cara gently shakingher shoulder.Kahlan blinked up at the familiar silhouette standing over her. She ached to goback to sleep, to be left alone to be so wonderfully asleep again.“My watch?” Kahlan asked.Cara nodded. “I’ll stand it if you’d like.”Kahlan glanced over her shoulder as she sat up, seeing that Richard was stillfast asleep. “No,” she whispered. “You get some sleep. You need rest, too.”Kahlan yawned and stretched her back. She took Cara’s elbow and pulled her ashort distance away, out of earshot, and leaned close. “I think you’re right.There’s more than enough of us to stand watch and all still get enough rest.Let’s let Richard sleep till morning.”Cara smiled her agreement before heading for her bedroll. Conspiracy designed toprotect Richard suited the Mord-Sith.Kahlan yawned and stretched again, at the same time forcing herself to shake thelingering haze of sleep from her mind, to be alert. Pulling her hair back fromher face and flipping it over her shoulder, she scanned the wasteland allaround, looking for anything out of the ordinary. Everything beyond their campwas as still as death. Mountains blacked out the glittering sweep of stars in ajagged line all the way around the horizon.Kahlan took careful assessment of everyone, making sure they were all accountedfor. Cara already looked comfortable. Tom slept not far from the horses.Friedrich was asleep on the other side of the horses. Jennsen was curled upbeside Betty, but by her movements, the way she turned from her side to herback, didn’t look asleep. The babies had moved and now lay sprawled with theirheads butted up tight against their mother.Kahlan was always especially vigilant right at change of watch. Change of watchwas a prime time for attack; she knew, for she had often initiated raids aroundchange of watch. Those just going off watch were often tired and alreadythinking of other things, considering watch the duty of the next guard. Thosejust coming on watch were often not mentally prepared for a sudden attack.People tended to think that the enemy would not come until they were properlysettled in and on the lookout. Victory favored those who were ready. Defeatstalked those who were unwary.Kahlan made her way to a formation of rock not far from Richard. She scootedback, sitting atop a high spot in order to get a better view of the lifelesssurroundings. Even in the middle of the night, the rough rock still radiated thefierce heat of the previous day.Kahlan pulled a skein of damp hair away from her neck, wishing there were abreeze. There had been times, in winter, when she had nearly frozen to death.Try as she might, she couldn’t seem to recall what it felt like to be trulycold.It wasn’t long after Kahlan had gotten herself situated before she saw Jennsenget up and step quietly through their camp, trying not to wake the others.“All right if I sit with you?” she asked when she finally reached Kahlan.“Of course.”Jennsen pushed her bottom back up onto the rock beside Kahlan, pulled her kneesup, and wrapped her arms around them, hugging them close to her body. For a timeshe just gazed out at the night.“Kahlan, I’m sorry—about before.” Despite the dark, Kahlan thought she could seethat the young woman looked miserable. “I didn’t mean to sound like a fool whowould do something without thinking. I’d never do anything to hurt any of you.”“I know you wouldn’t deliberately do any such thing. It’s the things you mightdo unwittingly that concern me.”Jennsen nodded. “I think I understand a little better, now, about howcomplicated everything is and how much I really don’t know. I’ll not do anythingunless you or Richard tells me to, I promise.”Kahlan smiled and ran a hand down the back of Jennsen’s head, letting it come torest on her shoulder. “I only told you those things because I care about you,Jennsen.” She gave the shoulder a compassionate squeeze. “I guess I’m worriedfor you the same way Betty worries for her innocent twins, knowing the dangersall around when they rarely do.“You need to understand that if you go out on thin ice, it doesn’t matter if thelake was frozen over by a cold spell, or a magic spell. If you don’t know whereyou’re stepping, so to speak, you could fall into the cold dark arms of death.It matters not what made the ice—dead is dead. My point is that you don’t go outon that thin ice unless you have a very powerful need, because it very wellcould cost you your life.”“But I’m not touched by magic. Like Richard said, I’m like someone born withouteyes who can’t see color. I’m a broken link in the chain of magic. Wouldn’t thatmean that I can’t accidentally get into trouble with it?”“And if someone pushes a boulder off a cliff and it crushes you, does it matterif that boulder was sent crashing over the edge by a man with a lever, or by asorceress wielding the gift?”Jennsen’s voice took on a troubled tone. “I see what you mean. I guess that Inever looked at it that way.”“I’m only trying to help you because I know how easy it is to make a mistake.”She watched Kahlan in the dark for a moment. “You know about magic. What kind ofmistake could you make?”“All kinds.”“Like what?”Kahlan stared off into the memories. “I once delayed for half a second inkilling someone.”“But I thought you said that it was wrong to be too rash.”“Sometimes the most foolhardy thing you can do is to delay. She was a sorceress.By the time I acted it was already too late. Because of my mistake she capturedRichard and took him away. For a year, I didn’t know what had happened to him. Ithought I would never see him again, that I would die of heartache.”Jennsen stared in astonishment. “When did you find him again?”“Not long ago. That’s why we’re down here in the Old World—she brought him here.At least I found him. I’ve made other mistakes, and they, too, have resulted inno end of trouble. So has Richard. Like he said, we all make mistakes. If I can,I want to spare you from making a needless mistake, at least.”Jennsen looked away. “Like believing in that man I was with yesterday—Sebastian.Because of him, my mother was murdered and I almost got you killed. I feel likesuch a fool.”“You didn’t make that mistake out of carelessness, Jennsen. They deceived you,used you. More importantly, in the end you used your head and were willing toface the truth.”Jennsen nodded.“What should we name the twins?” she finally asked.Kahlan didn’t think that naming the twins was a good idea, not yet anyway, butshe was reluctant to say it.“I don’t know. What names were you thinking?”Jennsen let out a heavy breath. “It was a shock to suddenly have Betty back withme, and even more of a surprise to see that she had babies of her own. I neverconsidered that before. I haven’t even had time to think about names.”“You will.”Jennsen smiled at the thought. Her smile grew, as if at the thought of somethingmore.“You know,” she said, “I think I understand what Richard meant about thinking ofhis grandfather as wizardly, even though he never saw him do magic.”“What do you mean?”“Well, I can’t see magic, so to speak, and Richard didn’t do any tonight—atleast none I know of.” She laughed softly, as pleasing a laugh as Kahlan hadever heard, full of life and joy. It had a quality to it much like Richard’s,the feminine balance to Richard’s masculine laugh, two facets of the samedelight.“And yet,” Jennsen went on, “the things he said made me think of him in thatway—wizardly—like he said about Zedd. When he was saying that, I knew just whathe meant, just how he’d felt, because Richard has opened up the world for me,but the gift wasn’t the magic he showed me. It was him showing me life, that mylife is mine, and worth living.”Kahlan smiled to herself, at how very much that described her own feeling ofwhat Richard had done for her, how he had brought her to cherish life andbelieve in it not just for others, but, most importantly, for herself.For a time they sat together, silently watching the empty wasteland. Kahlan keptan eye on Richard as he tossed in his sleep.With growing concern, Jennsen, too, watched Richard. “It looks like there’ssomething wrong with him,” she whispered as she leaned close.“He’s having a nightmare.”Kahlan watched, as she had so many times before, as Richard made fists in hissleep, as he struggled silently against some private terror.“It’s scary to see him like that,” Jennsen said. “He seems so different. Whenhe’s awake he always seems so ... reasoned.”“You can’t reason with a nightmare,” Kahlan said in quiet sorrow."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6Richard woke with a start.They were back.He had been having a bad dream. Like all of his dreams, he didn’t remember it.He only knew it was a bad dream because it left behind the shapeless feeling ofbreathless, heart-pounding, undefined, frantic terror. He threw off thelingering pall of the nightmare as he would throw off a tangled blanket. Eventhough it felt as if the dark things in lingering remnants of the dream werestill clawing at him, trying to drag him back into their world, he knew thatdreams were immaterial, and so he dismissed it. Now that he was awake, thefeeling of dread rapidly began to dissolve, like fog burning off under hotsunlight.Still, he had to make an effort to slow his breathing.What was important was that they were back. He didn’t always know when theyreturned, but this time, for some reason, he was sure of it.Sometime in the night, too, the wind had come up. It buffeted him, pulling athis clothes, tearing at his hair. Out on the sweltering waste, the scorchinggusts offered no relief from the heat. Rather than being refreshing, the windwas so hot that it felt as though the door to a blast furnace had opened and theheat were broiling his flesh.Groping for his waterskin, he didn’t find it immediately at hand. He tried torecall exactly where he’d laid it, but, with other thoughts screaming for hisattention, he couldn’t remember. He would have to worry about a drink later.Kahlan lay close, turned toward him. She had gathered her long hair in a loosefist beneath her chin. The wind whipped stray strands across her cheek. Richardloved just to sit and look at her face; this time, though, he delayed but amoment, looking at her only long enough in the faint starlight to note her evenbreathing. She was sound asleep.As he scanned their camp, he could just make out a weak blush in the easternsky. Dawn was still some time off.He realized that he’d slept through his watch. Cara and Kahlan had no doubtdecided that he needed the sleep more than he was needed for standing a watchand had conspired to not wake him. They were probably right. He had been soexhausted that he’d slept right through the night. Now, though, he was wideawake.His headache, too, was gone.Silently, carefully, Richard slipped away from Kahlan so as not to wake her. Heinstinctively reached for his sword lying at his other side. The metal was warmbeneath his touch as his fingers curled around the familiarsilver-and-gold-wrought scabbard. It was always reassuring to find the sword atthe ready, but even more so at that moment. As he silently rolled to his feet,he slipped the baldric over his head, placing the familiar supple leather acrosshis right shoulder. As he rose up, his sword was already at his hip, ready to dohis bidding.Despite how reassuring it was to have the weapon at his side, after the carnageback at the place called the Pillars of Creation the thought of drawing itsickened him. He recoiled from the mental image of the things he had done. Hadhe not, though, Kahlan wouldn’t be sleeping peacefully; she would be dead, orworse.Other good had come of it, too. Jennsen had been pulled back from the brink. Hesaw her curled up beside her beloved goat, her arm corralling Betty’s twosleeping kids. He smiled at seeing her, at what a wonder it was to have asister, smiled at how smart she was and all the wonders of life she had ahead ofher. It made him happy that she was eager to be around him, but being around himmade him worry for her safety, too. There really wasn’t any place safe, though,unless the forces of the Order that had been unleashed could be defeated, or atleast bottled back up.A heavy gust tore through their camp, raising even thicker clouds of dirt.Richard blinked, trying to keep the blowing sand out of his eyes. The sound ofthe wind in his ears was aggravating because it masked other sounds. Though helistened carefully, he could hear only the wind.Squinting against the blowing grit, he saw that Tom was sitting atop his wagon,looking this way and that, keeping watch. Friedrich was asleep on the other sideof the horses, Cara not far away on the desert side of Kahlan, putting herselfbetween them and anything that might be out beyond. In the dim starlight Tomhadn’t spotted Richard. When Tom scanned the night in the opposite direction,Richard moved away from camp, leaving Tom to watch over the others.Richard was comfortable in the cloak of darkness. Years of practice had taughthim to slip unseen through shadows, to move silently in the darkness. He didthat now, moving away from camp as he focused on what had awakened him, on whatothers standing watch would not sense.Unlike Tom, the races did not miss Richard’s movements. They wheeled highoverhead as they watched him, following him as he made his way out along thebroken ground. They were almost invisible against the dark sky, but Richardcould make them out as they blacked out stars, like telltale shadows against thesparkling black curtain of night—shadows that he thought he could feel as wellas he could see.That the crushing headache was gone was a great relief, but that it had vanishedin the manner that it had was also a cause for concern. The torment oftenvanished when he was distracted by something important. Something dangerous. Atthe same time, even though the pain was gone, it felt as if it were simplyhiding in the shadows of his mind, waiting for him to relax so that it couldpounce.When the headaches surged through him, the nauseating pain was so intense thatit made him feel sick in every fiber of his being. Even though the crushing painat times made it difficult for him to stand, to put one foot in front of theother, he had known that to remain behind, where they were, would have meantcertain death. While the headaches were bad in and of themselves, Richard wasn’tso much concerned about the pain as he was about the nature of theheadaches—their cause.They weren’t the same as the headaches he’d had before that he so feared—theheadaches brought on by the gift—but they weren’t like those he considered to benormal headaches, either. Throughout his life he’d occasionally had terribleheadaches, the same as his mother used to have on a more regular basis. She’dcalled them “my grim headaches.” Richard thoroughly understood her meaning.These, however grim, were not like those. He worried that they might be causedby the gift.He’d had the headaches brought on by the gift before. He had been told that ashe grew older, as his ability grew, as he came to understand more, he would, attimes later in his life, be confronted with headaches brought on by the gift.The remedy was supposedly simple. He had only to seek the help of another wizardand have him assist with the necessary next level of awareness and comprehensionof the nature of the gift within himself. That mental awareness andunderstanding would enable him to control and thereby eliminate the pain—todouse the flare-up. At least, that’s what he had been told.Of course, in the absence of another wizard to help, the Sisters of the Lightwould gladly put a collar around his neck to help control the runaway power ofthe gift.He had been told that such headaches, if not properly tended to, were lethal.This much of it, at least, he knew was true. He couldn’t afford to have thatproblem now, on top of all his others. Right now there was nothing he could doabout it; there was no one anywhere near who could help him with that kind ofheadache—no wizard, and even though he would never allow it, no Sister of theLight to put him in a collar again.Richard once more reminded himself that it wasn’t the same kind of pain as thelast time, when it had been brought on by the gift. He reminded himself not toinvent trouble he didn’t have.He had enough real trouble.He heard the whoosh as one of the huge birds shot past low overhead. The racetwisted in flight, lifting on a gust of wind, to peer back at him.Another followed in its wake, and then a third, a fourth, and a fifth. Theyslipped silently away, out across the open ground, following one another roughlyin a line. Their wings rocked as they worked to stabilize themselves in thegusty air. Some distance away, they soared into a gliding, climbing turn backtoward him.Before they returned, the races tightened their flight into a circle. When theystroked their huge wings, Richard could usually hear their feathers whisperthrough the air, although now, with the sound of the wind, he couldn’t. Theirblack eyes watched him watching them. He wanted them to know he was aware ofthem, that he hadn’t slept through their nocturnal return.Were he not so concerned about the meaning of the races, he might think theywere beautiful, their sleek black shapes silhouetted majestically against thecrimson flush coming to the sky.As he watched, though, Richard couldn’t imagine what they were doing. He’d seenthis behavior from them before and hadn’t understood it then, either. Herealized, suddenly, that those other times when they’d returned to circle inthis curious fashion, he had also been aware of them. He wasn’t always aware ofthem or aware of when they returned. If he had a headache, though, it hadvanished when they returned.The hot wind ruffled Richard’s hair as he gazed out across wasteland obscured bythe dusty predawn gloom. He didn’t like this dead place. Dawn here would offerno promise of a world coming to life. He wished Kahlan and he were back in hiswoods. He couldn’t help smiling as he recalled the place in the mountains wherethe year before they had spent the summer. The place was so wondrous that it hadeven managed to mellow Cara.In the faint but gathering light, the black-tipped races circled, as they alwaysdid when they performed this curious maneuver, not over him, but a shortdistance away, this time out over the open desert where the buffeting windunfurled diaphanous curtains of sandy grit. The other times it had been overforested hills, or open grassland. This time, as he watched the races, he had tosquint to keep the blowing sand from getting in his eyes.Abruptly tipping their broad wings, the races tightened their circle as theydescended closer to the desert floor. He knew that they would do this for ashort while before breaking up their formation to resume their normal flight.They sometimes flew in pairs and performed spectacular aerial stunts, eachgracefully matching the other’s every move, as ravens sometimes did, butotherwise they never flew in anything like the compact group of their sporadiccircling.And then, as the inky shapes wheeled around in a tight vortex, Richard realizedthat the trailers of blowing sand below them weren’t simply snaking and curlingaimlessly in the wind, but were flowing over something that wasn’t there.The hair along his arms stood stiffly up.Richard blinked, squinting into the wind, trying to see better in the howlingstorm of blowing sand. Yet more dust and dirt lifted in the blast of a heavygust. As the twisting eddies raced across the flat ground and passed beneath theraces, they swirled around and over something below, making the shape moredistinct.It appeared to be the form of a person.The dirt swirled around the empty void, silhouetting it, defining it, revealingwhat was there, but not. Whenever the wind lifted and carried with it a heavyload, the outline of the shape, bounded by the swirling sand, looked like theoutline of a man shrouded in hooded robes.Richard’s right hand found the hilt of his sword.There was nothing to the shape save the sand that flowed over the contours ofwhat wasn’t there, the way muddy water streaming around a clear glass bottlerevealed its covert contour. The form seemed to be standing still, watching him.There were, of course, no eyes in the empty sockets of blowing sand, but Richardcould feel them on him.“What is it?” Jennsen asked in a worried whisper as she rushed up beside him.“What’s the matter? Do you see something?”With his left hand, Richard pushed her back, out of his way. So urgent was hisheadlong rush of need that it took concentrated effort to be gentle about it. Hewas gripping the hilt of his sword so tightly that he could feel the raisedletters of the word TRUTH woven in gold wire through the silver.Richard was invoking from within the sword its purpose for being, the very coreof its creation. In answer, the might of the sword’s power ignited.Beyond the veil of rage, though, in the shadows of his mind, even as the angerof the sword thundered through him, Richard dimly perceived an unexpectedopposition on the part of the flux of magic to rise to the summons.It was like heading out a door and leaning his weight into the howl of a gale,and stumbling forward a step at unexpectedly finding less resistance thananticipated.Before Richard could question the sensation, the wave of wrath flooded throughhim, saturating him in the cold fury of the storm that was the sword’s power.As the races wheeled, their circle began coming closer. This, too, they had donebefore, but this time the shape that moved with them was betrayed by the swirlof sand and grit. It appeared that the intangible hooded man was being pulledcloser by the black-tipped races.The distinctive ring of steel announced the arrival of the Sword of Truth in thehot dawn air.Jennsen squeaked at his sudden movement and jumped back.The races answered with piercing, mocking cries that carried on the howlingwind.The unmistakable sound of Richard’s sword being drawn brought Kahlan and Cara ata dead run. Cara would have leapt protectively ahead, but she knew better thanto get in front of him when he had the sword out. Agiel clenched in her fist,she skidded to a halt off to the side, crouched and at the ready, a powerful catready to spring.“What is it?” Kahlan asked as she ran up behind him, gaping out at the patternin the wind.“It’s the races,” came Jennsen’s worried voice. “They’ve come back.”Kahlan stared incredulously at her. “The races don’t look like the worst of it.”Sword in hand, Richard watched the thing below the wheeling races. Feeling thesword in his grip, its power sizzling through the very marrow of his bones, hefelt a flash of hesitation, of doubt. With no time to waste, he turned back toTom, just starting away from securing the lead lines to his big draft horses.Richard mimed shooting an arrow. Grasping Richard’s meaning, Tom skidded to ahalt and spun back to the wagon. Friedrich urgently seized the tethers to theother horses, working to keep them calm, keeping them from spooking. Leaning inthe wagon, Tom threw gear aside as he searched for Richard’s bow and quiver.Jennsen peered from one grim face to another. “What do you mean the races aren’tthe worst of it?”Cara pointed with her Agiel. “That... that figure. That man.”Frowning in confusion, Jennsen looked back and forth between Cara and theblowing sand.“What do you see?” Richard asked.Jennsen threw her hands up in a gesture of frustration. “Black-tipped races.Five of them. That, and the blinding blowing sand is all. Is there someone outthere? Do you see people coming?”She didn’t see it.Tom pulled the bow and quiver from the wagon and ran for the rest of them. Twoof the races, as if noting Tom running in with the bow, lifted a wing andcircled wider. They swept around him once before disappearing into the darkness.The other three, though, continued to circle, as if bearing the floating form inthe blowing sand beneath them.Closer still the races came, and the form with them. Richard couldn’t imaginewhat it was, but the sense of dread it engendered rivaled any nightmare. Thepower from the sword surging through him had no such fear or doubt. Then why didhe? Storms of magic within, beyond anything storming across the wasteland,spiraled up through him, fighting for release. With grim effort, Richardcontained the need, focused it on the task of doing his bidding should he chooseto release it. He was the master of the sword and had at all times toconsciously exert that mastery. By the sword’s reaction to what the currents ofsand revealed, there could be no doubt as to Richard’s conviction of the natureof what stood before him. Then what was it he sensed from the sword?From back by the wagon, a horse screamed. A quick glance over his shoulderrevealed Friedrich trying to calm them. All three horses reared against the ropehe held fast. They came down stamping their hooves and snorting. From the cornerof his eye, Richard saw twin streaks of black shoot in out of the darkness,skimming in just above the ground. Betty let out a terrible wail.And then, as quickly as they’d appeared, they were gone, vanished back into thethick gloom.“No!” Jennsen cried out as she ran for the animals.Before them, the unmoving shape watched. Tom reached out, trying to stop Jennsenon the way past. She tore away from him. For a moment, Richard worried that Tommight go after her, but then he was again running for Richard.Out of the dark swirling murk, the two races suddenly appeared, so close Richardcould see the quills running down through their flight feathers spread wide inthe wind. Swooping in out of the swirling storm of dust to rejoin the circle,each carried a small, limp, white form in its powerful talons.Tom ran up holding the bow out in one hand and the quiver in the other. Makinghis choice, Richard slammed his sword into its scabbard and snatched up the bow.With one smooth motion he bent the bow and attached the string. He yanked anarrow from the leather quiver Tom held out in his big fist.As Richard turned to the target, he already had the arrow nocked and was drawingback the string. Distantly, it felt good to feel his muscles straining againstthe weight, straining against the spring of the bow, loading its force forrelease. It felt good to rely on his strength, his skill, his endless hours ofpractice, and not have to depend on magic.The still form of the man who wasn’t there seemed to watch. Eddies of sandsluiced over the shape, marking the outline. Richard glared at the head of theform beyond the razor-sharp steel tip of the arrow. Like all blades, it feltcomfortingly familiar to Richard. With a blade in his hands, he was in hiselement and it mattered not if it was stone dust his blade drew, or blood. Thesteel-tipped arrow was squarely centered on the empty spot in the curve ofblowing sand that formed the head.The piercing cry of races carried above the howl of the wind.String to his cheek, Richard savored the tension in his muscles, the weight ofthe bow, the feathers touching his flesh, the distance between blade andobjective filled with swirling sand, the pull of the wind against his arm, thebow, and the arrow. Each of those factors and a hundred more went into an innercalculation that after a lifetime of practice required no conscious computationyet decided where the point of the arrow belonged once he called the target.The form before him stood watching.Richard abruptly raised the bow and called the target.The world became not only still but silent for him as the distance seemed tocontract. His body was drawn as taut as the bow, the arrow becoming a projectionof his fluid focused intent, the mark before the arrow his purpose for being.His conscious intent invoked the instant sum of the calculation needed toconnect arrow and target.The swirling sand seemed to slow as the races, wings spread wide, draggedthrough the thick air. There was no doubt in Richard’s mind what the arrow wouldfind at the end of a journey only just begun. He felt the string hit his wrist.He saw the feathers clear the bow above his fist. The arrow’s shaft flexedslightly as it sprang away and took flight.Richard was already drawing the second arrow from the quiver in Tom’s fist asthe first found its target. Black feathers exploded in the crimson dawn. Thebird tumbled gracelessly through the air and with a hard thud hit the ground notfar from the shape floating just above the ground. The bloody white form wasfree of the talons, but it was too late.The four remaining races screamed in fury. As the birds pumped their wings,clawing for height, one railed at Richard with a shrill scream. Richard calledthe target.The second arrow was off.The arrow ripped right into the race’s open throat and out the back of the head,cutting off the angry cry. The flightless weight plummeted to the ground.The form below the remaining three races began to dissolve in the swirling sand.The three remaining birds, as if abandoning their charge, wheeled around, racingtoward Richard with angry intent. He calmly considered them from behind feathersof his own. The third arrow was away. The race in the center lifted its rightwing, trying to change direction, but took the arrow through its heart. Rollingwing over wing, it spiraled down through the blowing sand, crashing to thehardpan out ahead of Richard.The remaining two birds, screeching defiant cries, plunged toward him.Richard pulled string to cheek, placing the fourth arrow on target. The rangewas swiftly closing. The arrow was away in an instant. It tore through the bodyof the black-tipped race still clutching in its talons the bloody corpse of thetiny kid.Wings raked back, the last angry race dove toward Richard. As soon as Richardsnatched an arrow from the quiver an impatient Tom held out, the big D’Haranheaved his knife. Before Richard could nock the arrow, the whirling knife rippedinto the raptor. Richard stepped aside as the huge bird shot past in a lifelessdrop and slammed into the ground right behind him. As it tumbled, blood sprayedacross the windswept rock and black-tipped feathers flew everywhere.The dawn, only moments ago filled with the the bloodcurdling screams of theblack-tipped races, was suddenly quiet but for the low moan of the wind. Blackfeathers lifted in that wind, floating out across the open expanse beneath ayellow-orange sky.At that moment, the sun broke the horizon, throwing long shadows out over thewasteland.Jennsen clutched one of the limp white twins to her breast. Betty, bleatingplaintively, blood running from a gash on her side, stood on her hind legstrying to arouse her still kid in Jennsen’s arms. Jennsen bent to the other twinsprawled on the ground and laid her lifeless charge beside it. Betty urgentlylicked at the bloody carcasses.Jennsen hugged Betty’s neck a moment before trying to pull the goat away. Bettydug in her hooves, not wanting to leave her stricken kids. Jennsen could do nomore than to offer her friend consoling words choked with tears.When she stood, unable to turn Betty from her dead offspring, Richard shelteredJennsen under his arm.“Why would the races suddenly do that?”“I don’t know,” Richard said. “You didn’t see anything other than the races,then?”Jennsen leaned against Richard, holding her face in her hands, giving in brieflyto the tears. “I just saw the birds,” she said as she used the back of hersleeve to wipe her cheeks.“What about the shape defined by the blowing sand?” Kahlan asked as she placed acomforting hand on Jennsen’s shoulder.“Shape?” She looked from Kahlan to Richard. “What shape?”“It looked like a man’s shape.” Kahlan drew the curves of an outline in the airbefore her with both hands. “Like the outline of a man wearing a hooded cape.”“I didn’t see anything but black-tipped races and the clouds of blowing sand.”“And you didn’t see the sand blowing around anything?” Richard asked. “Youdidn’t see any shape defined by the sand?”Jennsen shook her head insistently before returning to Betty’s side.“If the shape involved magic,” Kahlan said in a confidential tone to Richard,“she wouldn’t see that, but why wouldn’t she see the sand?”“To her, the magic wasn’t there.”“But the sand was.”“The color is there on a painting but a blind person can’t see it, nor can theysee the shapes that the brush strokes, laden with color, help define.” He shookhis head in wonder as he watched Jennsen. “We don’t really know to what degreesomeone is affected by other things when they can’t perceive the magic thatinteracts with those other things. For all we know, it could be that her mindsimply fails to recognize the pattern caused by magic and just reads it asblowing sand. It could even be that because there is a pattern to the magic,only we can see those particles of sand directly involved with defining thepattern, while she sees them all and therefore the subordinate pattern is lostto her eyes.“It could even be that it’s something like the boundaries were; two worldsexisting in the same place at the same time. Jennsen and we could be looking atthe same thing, and see it through different eyes—through different worlds.”Kahlan nodded as Richard bent to one knee beside Jennsen to inspect the gashthrough the goat’s wiry brown hair.“We’d better stitch this,” he told Jennsen. “It’s not life-threatening, but itneeds attention.”Jennsen snuffled back her tears as Richard stood. “It was magic, then—the thingyou saw?”Richard stared off toward where the form had appeared in the blowing sand.“Something evil.”Off behind them, Rusty tossed her head and whinnied in sympathy withinconsolable Betty. When Tom laid a sorrowful hand on Jennsen’s shoulder, sheseized it as if for strength and held it to her cheek.Jennsen finally stood, shielding her eyes against the blowing dust as she lookedto the horizon. “At least we’re rid of the filthy races.”“Not for long,” Richard said.His headache came slamming back with such force that it nearly took him from hisfeet. He had learned a great deal about controlling pain, about how to disregardit. He did that now.There were bigger worries."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Around midafternoon, as they were walking across the scorching desert, Kahlannoticed Richard carefully watching his shadow stretched out before him.“What is it?” she asked. “What’s the matter?”He gestured at the shadow before him. “Races. Ten or twelve. They just glided upbehind us. They’re hiding in the sun.”“Hiding in the sun?”“They’re flying high and in the spot where their shadow falls on us. If we wereto look up in the sky we wouldn’t be able to see them because we’d have to lookright into the sun.”Kahlan turned and, with her hand shielding her eyes, tried to see for herself,but it was too painful to try to look up anywhere near the merciless sun. Whenshe looked back, Richard, who hadn’t turned to look with her, again flicked hishand toward the shadows.“If you look carefully at the ground around your shadow, you can just make outthe distortion in the light. It’s them.”Kahlan might have thought that Richard was having a little fun with her were itnot about a matter as serious as the races. She searched the ground around theirshadows until she finally saw what he was talking about. At such a distance, theraces’ shadows were little more than shifting irregularities in the light.Kahlan glanced back at the wagon. Tom was driving, with Friedrich sitting up onthe seat beside him. Richard and Kahlan were giving the horses a rest from beingridden, so they were tethered to the wagon.Jennsen sat on blankets in the back of the wagon, comforting Betty as shebleated in misery. Kahlan didn’t think the goat had been silent for more than aminute or two all day. The gash wasn’t bad; Betty’s suffering was from otherpain. At least the poor goat had Jennsen for solace.From what Kahlan had learned, Jennsen had had Betty for half her life. Movingaround as she and her mother had, running from Darken Rahl, hiding, staying awayfrom people so as not to reveal themselves and risk word drifting back to DarkenRahl’s ears, Jennsen had never had a chance to have childhood friends. Hermother had gotten her the goat as a companion. In her constant effort to keepJennsen out of the hands of a monster, it was the best she could offer.Kahlan wiped the stinging sweat from her eyes. She took in the four blackfeathers Richard had bundled together and strung on his upper right arm. He hadtaken the feathers when he’d retrieved the arrows that were still good. Richardhad given the last feather to Tom for killing the fifth race with his knife. Tomwore his single feather like Richard, on his arm. Tom thought of it as a trophy,of sorts, awarded by the Lord Rahl.Kahlan knew that Richard wore his four feathers for a different reason: it was awarning for all to see.Kahlan pulled her hair back over her shoulder. “Do you think that was a manbelow the races? A man watching us?”Richard shrugged. “You know more about magic than me. You tell me.”“I’ve never seen anything like it.” She frowned over at him. “If it was a man...or something like that, why do you think he finally decided to reveal himself?”“I don’t think he did decide to reveal himself.” Richard’s intent gray eyesturned toward her. “I think it was an accident.”“How could it be an accident?”“If it’s someone using the races to track us, and he can somehow see us—”“See us how?”“I don’t know. See us through the eyes of the races.”“You can’t do that with magic.”Richard fixed her with a trenchant look. “Fine. Then what was it?”Kahlan looked back at the shadows stretching out before them on thebuckskin-colored rock, back at the small bleary shapes moving around the shadowof her head, like flies around a corpse. “I don’t know. You were saying? ...About someone using the races to track us, to see us?”“I think,” Richard said, “that someone is watching us, through the races or withtheir aid—or something like that—and they can’t really see everything. Theycan’t see clearly.”“So?”“So, since he can’t see with clarity, I think maybe he didn’t realize that therewas a sandstorm. He didn’t anticipate what the blowing sand would reveal. Idon’t think he intended to give himself away.” Richard looked over at her again.“I think he made a mistake. I think he showed himself accidentally.”Kahlan let out a measured, exasperated breath. She had no argument for such apreposterous notion. It was no wonder he hadn’t told her the full extent of histheory. She had been thinking, when he said the races were tracking them, thatprobably a web had been cast and then some event had triggered it—most likelyCara’s innocent touch—and that spell had then attached to them, causing theraces to follow that marker of magic. Then, as Jennsen had suggested, someonewas simply watching where the races were in order to get a pretty good idea ofwhere Richard and Kahlan were. Kahlan had thought of it in terms of the wayDarken Rahl had once hooked a tracer cloud to Richard in order to know wherethey were. Richard wasn’t thinking in terms of what had happened before; he waslooking at it through the prism of a Seeker.There were still a number of things about Richard’s notion that didn’t makesense to her, but she knew better than to discount what he thought simplybecause she had never heard of such a thing before.“Maybe it’s not a ‘he,’ “ she finally said. “Maybe it’s a she. Maybe a Sister ofthe Dark.”Richard gave her another look, but this one was more worry than anything else.“Whoever it is—whatever it is—I don’t think it can be anything good.”Kahlan couldn’t argue that much of it, but still, she couldn’t reconcile such anotion. “Well, let’s say it’s like you think it is—that we spotted him spying onus, by accident. Why did the races then attack us?”Dust rose from Richard’s boot as he casually kicked a small stone. “I don’tknow. Maybe he was just angry that he’d given himself away.”“He was angry, so he had the races kill Betty’s kids? And attack you?”Richard shrugged. “I’m just guessing because you asked; I’m not saying I thinkit’s so.” The long feathers, bloodred at their base, turning to a dark gray andthen to inky black at the tip, ruffled in the gusts of wind.As he thought it over, his tone turned more speculative. “It could even be thatwhoever it was using the races to watch us had nothing at all to do with theattack. Maybe the races decided to attack on their own.”“They simply took the reins from whoever it was that was taking them for theride?”“Maybe. Maybe he can send them to us so he can have a peek at where we are,where we’re going, but can’t control them much more than that.”In frustration, Kahlan let out a sigh. “Richard,” she said, unable to hold backher doubts, “I know a good deal about all sorts of magic and I’ve never heard ofanything like this being possible.”Richard leaned close, again taking her in with those arresting gray eyes of his.“You know about all sorts of things magic from the Midlands. Maybe down herethey have something you never encountered before. After all, had you ever heardof a dream walker before we encountered Jagang? Or even thought such a thing waspossible?”Kahlan pulled her lower lip through her teeth as she studied his grim expressionfor a long moment. Richard hadn’t grown up around magic—it was all new to him.In some ways, though, that was a strength, because he didn’t have preconceivednotions about what was possible and what wasn’t. Sometimes, the things they’dencountered were unprecedented.To Richard, just about all magic was unprecedented.“So, what do you think we should do?” she finally asked in a confidential tone.“What we planned.” He glanced over his shoulder to see Cara scouting a goodlydistance off to their left side. “It has to be connected to the rest of it.”“Cara only meant to protect us.”“I know. And who knows, maybe it would have been worse if she hadn’t touched it.It could even be that by doing what she did, she actually bought us time.”Kahlan swallowed at the feeling of dread churning in her. “Do you think we stillhave enough time?”“We’ll think of something. We don’t even know yet for sure what it could mean.”“When the sand finally runs out of an hourglass, it usually means the goose iscooked.”“We’ll find an answer.”“Promise?”Richard reached over and gently caressed the back of her neck. “Promise.”Kahlan loved his smile, the way it sparkled in his eyes. Somewhere in the backof her mind she knew that he always kept his promises. His eyes held somethingelse, though, and that distracted her from asking if he believed the answer hepromised would come in time, or even if it would be an answer that could helpthem.“You have a headache, don’t you,” she said.“Yes.” His smile had vanished. “It’s different than before, but I’m pretty sureit’s caused by the same thing.”The gift. That’s what he meant.“What do you mean it’s different? And if it’s different, then what makes youthink the cause is the same?”He thought about it a moment. “Remember when I was explaining to Jennsen abouthow the gift needs to be balanced, how I have to balance the fighting I do bynot eating meat?” When she nodded he went on. “It got worse right then.”“Headaches, even those kind, vary.”“No...” he said, frowning as he tried to find the words. “No, it was almost asif talking about—thinking about—the need not to eat meat in order to balance thegift somehow brought it more to the fore and made the headaches worse.”Kahlan didn’t at all like that concept. “You mean like maybe the gift within youthat is the cause of the headaches is trying to impress upon you the importanceof balance in what you do with the gift.”Richard raked his fingers back through his hair. “I don’t know. There’s more toit. I just can’t seem to get it all worked out. Sometimes when I try, when I godown that line of reasoning, about how I need to balance the fighting I do, thepain starts to get so bad I can’t dwell on it.“And something else,” he added. “There might be a problem with my connection tothe magic of the sword.”“What? How can that be?”“I don’t know.”Kahlan tried to keep the alarm out of her voice. “Are you sure?”He shook his head in frustration. “No, I’m not sure. It just seemed differentwhen I felt the need of it and drew the sword this morning. It was as if thesword’s magic was reluctant to rise to the need.”Kahlan thought it over a moment. “Maybe that means that the headaches aresomething different, this time. Maybe they aren’t really caused by the gift.”“Even if some of it is different, I still think its cause is the gift,” he said.“One thing they do have in common with the last time is that they’re graduallygetting worse.”“What do you want to do?”He lifted his arms out to the sides and let them fall back. “For now, we don’thave much of a choice—we have to do what we planned.”“We could go to Zedd. If it is the gift, as you think, then Zedd would know whatto do. He could help you.”“Kahlan, do you honestly believe that we have any chance in Creation of makingit all the way to Aydindril in time? Even if it weren’t for the rest of it, ifthe headaches are from the gift, I’d be dead weeks before we could travel allthe way to Aydindril. And that’s not even taking into account how difficult it’sbound to be getting past Jagang’s army all throughout the Midlands andespecially the troops around Aydindril.”“Maybe he’s not there now.”Richard kicked at another stone in the path. “You think Jagang is just going toleave the Wizard’s Keep and all it contains—leave it all for us to use againsthim?”Zedd was First Wizard. For someone of his ability, defending the Wizard’s Keepwouldn’t be too difficult. He also had Adie there with him to help. The oldsorceress, alone, could probably defend a place such as the Keep. Zedd knew whatthe Keep would mean to Jagang, could he gain it. Zedd would protect the Keep nomatter what.“There’s no way for Jagang to get past the barriers in that place,” Kahlan said.That much of it was one worry they could set aside. “Jagang knows that and mightnot waste time holding an army there for nothing.”“You may be right, but that still doesn’t do us any good—it’s too far.”Too far. Kahlan seized Richard’s arm and dragged him to a halt. “The sliph. Ifwe can find one of her wells, we could travel in the sliph. If nothing else, weknow there’s the well down here in the Old World—in Tanimura. Even that’s a lotcloser than a journey overland all the way to Aydindril.”Richard looked north. “That might work. We wouldn’t have to make it pastJagang’s army. We could come right up inside the Keep.” He put his arm aroundher shoulders. “First, though, we have to see to this other business.”Kahlan grinned. “All right. We take care of me first, then we see to taking careof you.”She felt a heady sense of relief that there was a solution at hand. The rest ofthem couldn’t travel in the sliph—they didn’t have the required magic—butRichard, Kahlan, and Cara certainly could. They could come up right in the Keepitself.The Keep was immense, and thousands of years old. Kahlan had spent much of herlife there, but she had seen only a fraction of the place. Even Zedd hadn’t seenit all, because of some of the shields that had been placed there ages ago bythose with both sides of the gift, and Zedd had only the Additive side. Rare anddangerous items of magic had been stored there for eons, along with records andcountless books. By now it was possible that Zedd and Adie had found somethingin the Keep that would help drive the Imperial Order back to the Old World.Not only would going to the Keep be a way to solve Richard’s problem with thegift, but it might provide them with something they needed to swing the tide ofthe war back to their side.Suddenly, seeing Zedd, Aydindril, and the Keep seemed only a short time away.With a renewed sense of optimism, Kahlan squeezed Richard’s hand. She knew thathe wanted to keep scouting ahead. “I’m going to go back and see how Jennsen isdoing.”As Richard moved on and Kahlan slowed, letting the wagon catch up with her,another dozen black-tipped races drifted in on the air currents high above theburning plain. They stayed close to the sun, and well out of range of Richard’sarrows, but they stayed within sight.Tom handed a waterskin down to Kahlan when the bouncing wagon rattled up besideher. She was so dry that she gulped the hot water without caring how bad ittasted. As she let the wagon roll past, she put a boot in the iron rung andboosted herself up and over the side.Jennsen looked to be happy for the company as Kahlan climbed in. Kahlan returnedthe smile before sitting beside Richard’s sister and the puling Betty.“How is she?” Kahlan asked, gently stroking Betty’s floppy ears.Jennsen shook her head. “I’ve never seen her like this. It’s breaking my heart.It reminds me of how hard it was for me when I lost my mother. It’s breaking myheart.”As she sat back on her heels, Kahlan squeezed Jennsen’s hand sympathetically. “Iknow it’s hard, but it’s easier for an animal to get over something like thisthan for people to do the same. Don’t compare it to you and your mother. Sad asthis is, it’s different. Betty can have more kids and she’ll forget all aboutthis. You or I never could.”Before the words were out, Kahlan felt a sudden stab of pain for the unbornchild she had lost. How could she ever get over losing her and Richard’s child?Even if she ever had others, she would never be able to forget what was lost atthe hands of brutes.She idly turned the small dark stone on the necklace she wore, wondering if sheever would have a child, wondering if there would ever be a world safe for achild of theirs.“Are you all right?”Kahlan realized that Jennsen was watching her face.Kahlan forced herself to put on a smile. “I’m just sad for Betty.”Jennsen ran a tender hand over the top of Betty’s head. “Me too.”“But I know that she’ll be all right.”Kahlan watched the endless expanse of ground slowly slide by to either side ofthe wagon. Waves of heat made the horizon liquid, with detached pools of groundfloating up into the sky. Still, they saw nothing growing. The land was slowlyrising, though, as they came ever closer to distant mountains. She knew that itwas only a matter of time until they reached life again, but right then it feltlike they never would.“I don’t understand about something,” Jennsen said. “You told me how I shouldn’tdo anything rash, when it came to magic, unless I was sure of what would happen.You said it was dangerous. You said not to act in matters of magic until you canbe sure of the consequence.”Kahlan knew what Jennsen was driving at. “That’s right.”“Well, that back there pretty much seemed like one of those stabs in the darkyou warned me about.”“I also told you that sometimes you had no choice but to act immediately. That’swhat Richard did. I know him. He used his best judgment.”Jennsen looked to be satisfied. “I’m not suggesting that he was wrong. I’m justsaying that I don’t understand. It seemed pretty reckless to me. How am Isupposed to know what you mean when you tell me not to do anything reckless ifit involves magic?”Kahlan smiled. “Welcome to life with Richard. Half the time I don’t know what’sin his head. I’ve often thought he was acting recklessly and it turned out to bethe right thing, the only thing, he could have done. That’s part of the reasonhe was named Seeker. I’m sure he took into account things he sensed that even Icouldn’t.”“But how does he know those things? How can he know what to do?”“Oftentimes he’s just as confused as you, or even me. But he’s different, too,and he’s sure when we wouldn’t be.”“Different?”Kahlan looked over at the young woman, at her red hair shining in the afternoonsunlight. “He was born with both sides of the gift. All those born with the giftin the last three thousand years have been born with Additive Magic only. Some,like Darken Rahl and the Sisters of the Dark, have been able to use SubtractiveMagic, but only through the Keeper’s help—not on their own. Richard alone hasbeen born with Subtractive Magic.”“That’s what you mentioned last night, but I don’t know anything about magic, soI don’t know what that means.”“We’re not exactly sure of everything it means ourselves. Additive Magic useswhat is there, and adds to it, or changes it somehow. The magic of the Sword ofTruth, for example, uses anger, and adds to it, takes power from it, adds to ituntil it’s something else. With Additive, for example, the gifted can heal.“Subtractive Magic is the undoing of things. It can take things and make themnothing. According to Zedd, Subtractive Magic is the counter to Additive, asnight is to day. Yet it is all part of the same thing.“Commanding Subtractive, as Darken Rahl did, is one thing, but to be born withit is quite another.“Long ago, unlike now, being born with the gift—both sides of the gift—wascommon. The great war then resulted in a barrier sealing the New World off fromthe Old. That’s kept the peace all this time, but things have changed sincethen. After that time, not only have those born with the gift gradually becomeexceedingly rare, but those who have been born with the gift haven’t been bornwith the Subtractive side of it.“Richard was born of two lines of wizards, Darken Rahl and his grandfather Zedd.He’s also the first in thousands of years to be born with both sides of thegift.“All of our abilities contribute to how we’re able to react to situations. Wedon’t know how having both sides contributes to Richard’s ability to read asituation and do what’s necessary. I suspect he may be guided by his gift,perhaps more than he believes.”Jennsen let out a troubled sigh. “After all this time, how did this barrier cometo be down, anyway?”“Richard destroyed it.”Jennsen looked up in astonishment. “Then it’s true. Sebastian told me that theLord Rahl—Richard—had brought the barrier down. Sebastian said it was so thatRichard could invade and conquer the Old World.”Kahlan smiled at such a grandiose lie. “You don’t believe that part of it, doyou?”“No, not now.”“Now that the barrier is down, the Imperial Order is flooding up into the NewWorld, destroying or enslaving everything before them.”“Where can people live that’s safe? Where can we?”“Until they’re stopped or driven back, there is no safe place to live.”Jennsen thought it over a moment. “If the barrier coming down let the ImperialOrder flood in to conquer the New World, why would Richard have destroyed it?”With one hand, Kahlan held on to the side of the wagon as it rocked over a roughpatch of ground. She stared ahead, watching Richard walking through the glaringlight of the wasteland.“Because of me,” Kahlan said in a quiet voice. “One of those mistakes I told youabout.” She let out a tired sigh. “One of those stabs in the dark.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Richard squatted down, resting his forearms across his thighs as he studied thecurious patch of rock. His head was pounding with pain; he was doing his best toignore it. The headache had come and gone seemingly without reason. At times hehad begun to think that it just might be the heat after all, and not the gift.As he considered the signs on the ground, he forgot about his headache.Something about the rock seemed familiar. Not simply familiar, but unsettlinglyfamiliar.Hooves partially covered by long wisps of wiry brown hair came to an expectanthalt beside him. With the top of her head, Betty gently butted his shoulder,hoping for a snack, or at least a scratch.Richard looked up at the goat’s intent, floppy-eared expression. As Bettywatched him watching her, her tail went into a blur of wagging. Richard smiledand scratched behind her ears. Betty bleated her pleasure at the scratch, but itsounded to him like she would have preferred a snack.After not eating for two days as she lay in misery in the wagon, the goat seemedto come back to life and begin to recover from the loss of her two kids. Alongwith her appetite, Betty’s curiosity had returned. She especially enjoyedscouting with Richard, when he would let her come along. It made Jennsen laughto watch the goat trotting after him like a puppy. Maybe what really made herlaugh was that Betty was getting back to her old self.In recent days the land had changed, too. They had begun to see the return oflife. At first, it had simply been the rusty discoloration of lichen growing onthe fragmented rock. Soon after, they spotted a small thorny bush growing in alow place. Now the rugged plants grew at widely spaced intervals, dotting thelandscape. Betty appreciated the tough bushes, dining on them as if they werethe finest salad greens. On occasion the horses sampled the brush, then turnedaway, never finding it to their liking.Lichen that had begun to grow on the rock appeared as crusty splotches streakedwith color. In some places it was dark, thick, and leathery, while in otherspots it was no more than what almost appeared to be a coat of thin green paint.The greenish discoloration filled cracks and crevasses and coated the undersideof stones where the sun didn’t bleach it out. Rocks sticking partway out of thecrumbly ground could be pulled up to reveal thin tendrils of dark brownsubterranean fungal growth.Tiny insects with long feelers skittered from rock to rock or hid in holes inthe scattering of rocks lying about on the ground that looked as if they hadonce been boiling and bubbling, and had suddenly turned to stone, leaving thebubbles forever set in place. An occasional glossy green beetle, bearing widepincer jaws, waddled through the sand. Small red ants stacked steep ruddy moundsof dirt around their holes. There were cottony webs of spiders in the crotchesof the isolated, small, spindly brush growing sporadically across the everrising plain. Slender light green lizards sat on rocks basking in the sun,watching the people pass. If they came too close, the little creatures,lightning quick, darted for cover.The signs of life Richard had so far seen were still a long way from beinganything substantial enough to support people, but it was at least a relief toonce again feel like he was rejoining the world of the living. He knew, too,that up beyond the first wall of mountains they would at last encounter life inabundance. He also knew that there they would again begin to encounter people.Birds, as well, were just beginning to become a common sight. Most weresmall—strawberry-colored finches, ash-colored gnatcatchers, rock wrens andblack-throated sparrows. In the distance Richard saw single birds wingingthrough the blue sky, while sparrows congregated in small skittish flocks. Hereand there, birds lit on the scraggly brush, flitting about looking for seeds andbugs. The birds disappeared instantly whenever the races glided into sight.Staring at the expanse of rock and open ground before him, Richard rose up,startled, as the reason it looked unsettlingly familiar came to him. At the sametime as the realization came to him, his headache vanished.Off to his right, Richard saw Kahlan, with Cara at her side, making their wayout to where Richard stood staring down at the astonishing stretch of rock. Thewagon, with Tom, Friedrich, and Jennsen, rumbled on in the distance to thesouth. The dust raised by the wagon and horses hung in the dead air and could beseen for miles. Richard supposed that with the races periodically paying them avisit, the telltale of the dust didn’t much matter. Still, he would be glad whenthey reached ground where they could at least have a chance to try to remain alittle more inconspicuous.“Find anything interesting?” Kahlan asked as she wiped her sleeve across herforehead.Richard cast a few small pebbles down at the stretch of rock he’d been studying.“Tell me what you think of that.”“I think you look like you feel better,” Kahlan said.Her eyes on his, she gave him her special smile, the smile she gave no one buthim. He couldn’t help grinning.Cara, ignoring the smiles that passed between Richard and Kahlan, leaned in fora gander. “I think Lord Rahl has been looking at too many rocks. This is morerock, just like all the rest.”“Is it?” Richard asked. He gestured at the area he’d been scrutinizing and thenpointed at another place by where Kahlan and Cara stood. “Is it the same asthat?”Cara peered at both areas briefly before she folded her arms. “The rock overthere that you’ve been looking at is just a paler brown, that’s all.”Kahlan shrugged. “I think she’s right, Richard. It looks like the same kind ofrock, maybe just a little more of a tan color.” She thought it over a moment asshe scanned the ground, then added to her assessment. “I guess it looks morelike the rock we’ve been walking across for days until we started encountering alittle bit of grass and brush.”Richard put his hands on his hips as he stared back at the remarkable stretch ofrock he’d found. “Tell me, then, what characterized the rock in the place wherewe were before—a few days ago, back closer to the Pillars of Creation?”Kahlan looked over at an expressionless Cara and then frowned at Richard.“Characterized it? Nothing. It was a dead place. Nothing grew there.”Richard waved his hand around, indicating the land through which they were nowtraveling. “And this?”“Now things are growing,” Cara said, becoming increasingly disinterested in hisstudy of flora and fauna.Richard held a hand out. “And there?”“Nothing is growing there, yet,” Cara said in an exasperated sigh. “There are alot of spots around where nothing is growing yet. It’s still a wasteland. Justhave patience, Lord Rahl, and we will soon enough be back among the fields andforests.”Kahlan wasn’t paying attention to what Cara was saying; she was frowning as sheleaned closer.“The place where things begin to grow seems to start all at once,” Kahlan said,almost to herself. “Isn’t that curious.”“I certainly think so,” Richard said.“I think Lord Rahl needs to drink more water,” Cara sniped.Richard smiled. “Here. Stand over here,” he told her. “Stand over by me and lookagain.”Cara, her curiosity aroused, did as he asked. She looked down at the ground, andthen frowned at the places where things grew.“The Mother Confessor is right.” Cara’s voice had taken on a decidedlybusinesslike tone. “Do you think it’s important? Or somehow a danger?”“Yes—to the first, anyway,” Richard said.He squatted down beside Kahlan. “Now, look at this.”As Kahlan and Cara knelt down beside him, leaning forward, looking closely atthe rock, Richard had to push a curious Betty back out of the way. He thenpointed out a patch of yellow-streaked lichen.“Look here,” he said. “See this medallion of lichen? It’s lopsided. This side isround, but this side, near where nothing grows, is flatter.”Kahlan looked up at him. “Lichen grows on rocks in all kinds of shapes.”“Yes, but look at how the rock over where there is lichen and brush growing isspotted all over with little bits of growth. Here, beyond the stunted side ofthe lichen, there is nearly nothing. The rock almost looks scoured clean.“If you look closely there are a few tiny things, things that have started togrow only in the last couple of years, but they have yet to really begin to takehold.”“Yes,” Kahlan said in a cautious drawl, “it is odd, but I’m not sure what you’regetting at.”“Look at where things are growing, and where they aren’t.”“Well, yes, on that side there’s nothing growing, and over here there is.”“Don’t just look down.” Richard lifted her chin. “Look out at the boundarybetween the two—look at the whole pattern.”Kahlan frowned off into the distance. All of a sudden, the color drained fromher face.“Dear spirits...” she whispered.Richard smiled that she finally saw what he was talking about.“What are you two mooning over?” Cara complained.Richard put his hand behind Cara’s neck and pulled her head in to look at whathe and Kahlan were seeing.“That’s odd,” she said, squinting off into the distance. “The place where thingsare growing seem to stop in a comparatively clean line—like someone had made aninvisible fence running east.”“Right,” Richard said as he got up, brushing his hands clean.“Now, come on.” He started walking north. Kahlan and Cara scrambled to theirfeet and followed behind as he marched across the lifeless rock. Betty bleatedand trotted after them.“Where are we going?” Cara asked as she caught up with him.“Just come on,” Richard told her.For half an hour they followed his brisk pace as he headed in a straight line tothe north, across rocky ground and gravelly patches where nothing at all grew.The day was sweltering, but Richard almost didn’t notice the heat, so focusedwas he on the lifeless expanse they were crossing. He hadn’t yet gone to seewhat lay at the other side, but he was convinced of what they would find oncethey reached it.The other two were sweating profusely as they chased behind him. Betty bleatedoccasionally as she brought up the rear.When they finally reached the place he was looking for, the place where lichenand scraggly brush once again began to appear, he brought them to a halt. Bettypoked her head between Kahlan and Cara for a look.“Now, look at this,” Richard said. “See what I mean?”Kahlan was breathing hard from the brisk walk in the heat. She pulled herwaterskin off her shoulder and gulped water. She passed the waterskin toRichard. He watched Cara study the patch of ground as he drank.“The growing things start again over here,” Cara said. She absently scratchedbehind Betty’s ears when the goat rubbed the top of her head impatiently againstCara’s thigh. “They start to appear in the same kind of line as the other side,back there, where we were.”“Right,” Richard said, handing Cara the waterskin. “Now, follow me.”Cara threw up her arms. “We just came from that way!”“Come on,” Richard called back over his shoulder.He headed south again, back toward the center of the lifeless patch of rock, thesmall group in tow. Betty bleated her displeasure at the pace of the hot dustyexcursion. If Kahlan or Cara shared Betty’s opinion, they didn’t voice thecomplaint.When Richard judged they were back somewhere in the middle, he stood with hisfeet spread, his fists on his hips, and looked east again. From where theystood, they couldn’t make out the sides of the lifeless stretch, the placeswhere growth began.Looking to the east, though, the pattern was evident. A clearly definedstrip—miles wide—ran off into the distance.Nothing grew within the bounds of the straight strip of lifeless desert, whethergoing over rock or sandy ground. To either side the ground with widely spacedbrush and lichen growing on the rock was darker. The place where nothing grewwas a lighter tan. In the distance the discrepancy in the color was even moreapparent.The lifeless strip ran straight for mile after mile toward the far mountains,gradually becoming but a faint line following the rise of the ground until,finally, in the hazy distance, it could no longer be seen.“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Kahlan asked in a low, troubled voice.“What?” Cara asked. “What are you thinking?”Richard studied the confused concern on the Mord-Sith’s face. “What kept DarkenRahl’s armies in D’Hara? What prevented him, for so many years, from invadingthe Midlands and taking it, even though he wanted it?”“He couldn’t cross the boundary,” Cara said as if he must be having heat stroke.“And what made up the boundary?”At last, Cara’s face, framed by the black desert garb, went white, too. “Theboundary was the underworld?”Richard nodded. “It was like a rip in the veil, where the underworld existed inthis world. Zedd told us about it. He put the boundary up with a spell he foundin the Keep—a spell from those ancient times of the great war. Once up, theboundary was a place in this world where the world of the dead also existed. Inthat place, where both worlds touched, nothing could grow.”“But are you so sure things wouldn’t still grow there?” Cara asked. “It wasstill our world, after all—the world of life.”“It would be impossible for anything to grow there. The world of life was there,in that spot—the ground was there—but life couldn’t exist there on that groundbecause it shared that same space with the world of the dead. Anything therewould be touched by death.”Cara looked out at the straight, lifeless strip running off into the waveringdistance. “So you think what? ... This is a boundary?”“Was.”Cara looked from his face, to Kahlan, and again out to the distance. “Dividingwhat?”Overhead a flight of black-tipped races came into sight, riding the highcurrents, turning lazy circles as they watched.“I don’t know,” Richard admitted.He looked west again, back down the gradual slope running away from themountains, back to where they had been.“But look,” Richard said, gesturing out into the burning wasteland from wherethey had come. “It runs back toward the Pillars of Creation.”As the things growing thinned and eventually ceased to be back that way, so toodid the lifeless strip. It became indistinguishable from the surroundingwasteland because there was no life to mark where the line had been.“There’s no telling how far it runs. For all I know,” Richard said, “it’spossible that it runs all the way back to the valley itself.”“That part makes no sense to me,” Kahlan said. “I can see what you mean about itmaybe being like the boundaries up in the New World, the boundaries betweenWestland, the Midlands, and D’Hara. That much I follow. But the spirits take me,I don’t get why it would run to the Pillars of Creation. That part just strikesme as more than odd.”Richard turned and gazed back to the east, where they were headed, to therumpled gray wall of mountains rising steeply up from the broad desert floor,studying the distant notch that sat a little north of where the boundary lineran toward those mountains.He looked south, to the wagon making its way toward those mountains.“We better catch up with the others,” Richard finally said. “I need to get backto translating the book.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9The spectral spires around Richard glowed under the lingering caress of the lowsun. In the amber light, as he scouted the forsaken brink of the toweringmountains beyond, long pools of shadow were darkening to the blue-black color ofbruises.The pinnacles of reddish rock stood like stony guardians along the lower reachesof the desolate foothills, as if listening for the echoing crunch of hisfootsteps along the meandering gravel beds.Richard had felt like being alone to think, so he had set out to scout byhimself. It was hard to think when people were constantly asking questions.He was frustrated that the book hadn’t yet told him anything that would in anyway help explain the presence of the strange boundary line, much less theconnection of the book’s title, the place called the Pillars of Creation, andthose ungifted people like Jennsen. The book, in the beginning that he’d so fartranslated, anyway, appeared mostly to be an historical record dealing withunanticipated matters involving occurrences of “pillars of Creation,” as thoselike Jennsen were called, and the unsuccessful attempts at “curing” those“unfortunates.”Richard was beginning to get the clear sense that the book was laying a carefulfoundation of early details in preparation for something calamitous. The nearlyquaking care of the recounting of every possible course of action that had beeninvestigated gave him the feeling that whoever wrote the book was beingpainstaking for reasons of consequence.Not daring to slow their pace, Richard had been translating while riding in thewagon. The dialect was slightly different from the High D’Haran he was used toreading, so working out the translation was slow going, especially sitting inthe back of the bouncing wagon. He had no way of knowing if the book wouldeventually offer any answers, but he felt a gnawing worry over what theunfolding account was working up to. He would have jumped ahead, but he’dlearned in the past that doing so often wasted more time than it saved, since itinterfered with accurately grasping the whole picture, which sometimes led todangerously erroneous conclusions. He would just have to keep at it.After working all day, focused intently on the book, he’d ended up with a fierceheadache. He’d had days without them, but now when they came it seemed they wereworse each time. He didn’t tell Kahlan how concerned he was that he wouldn’tmake it to the sliph’s well in Tanimura. Besides working at translating, heracked his brain trying to find a solution.While he had no idea what the key to the headaches brought on by the gift was,he had the nagging feeling that it was within himself. He feared it was a matterof balance he was failing to see. He had even resorted when out alone, once, tositting and meditating as the Sisters had once taught him in order to try tofocus on the gift within. It had been to no avail.It would be dark soon and they would need to stop for the night. Since theterrain had changed, it was no longer a simple task to see if the area allaround them was clear. Now there were places where an army could lie in wait.With the races shadowing them, there was no telling who might know where to findthem. Besides simply wanting a break to think about what he’d read and what hemight find within himself to answer the problem of his headaches, Richard wantedto check the surrounding area himself.Richard paused for a moment to watch a family of quail, the juveniles fullygrown, hurry across an open patch of ground. They trotted across the exposedgravel in a line while the father, perched atop a rock, stood lookout. As soonas they melted into the brush, they were again invisible.Small scraggly pine trees dotted the sweep of irregular hills, gullies, androcky outcroppings at the fringe of the mountains. Up higher, on the nearbyslopes, larger conifers grew in greater abundance. In low, sheltered placesclumps of brush lay in thick clusters. Thin grasses covered some of the openground.Richard wiped sweat from his eyes. He hoped that with the sun going down the airmight cool a little. As he made his way along the concealment of the base of arunoff channel in a fold of two hills, he reached for the strap of hiswaterskin, about to take a long drink, when movement on a far hillside caughthis attention.He slipped behind the screen of a long shelf of rock to stay out of sight.Taking a careful peek, he saw a man making his way down the loose scree on theside of the hill. The sound of the rock crunching underfoot and sliding down theslope sent a distant echo through the rocky canyons.Richard had expected that as they left the forbidding wasteland they might atany time begin encountering people, so he had had everyone change out of theblack outfits of the nomadic desert people and back into their unassumingtraveling clothes. While he was in black trousers and simple shirt, his swordwas hardly inconspicuous. Kahlan, as well, had put on simple clothes that weremore in keeping with the impoverished people of the Old World, but on Kahlanthey didn’t seem to make much difference; it was hard to hide her figure and herhair, but most of all her presence. Once those green eyes of hers fixed onpeople, they usually had an urge to drop to a knee and bow their head. Herclothes made little difference.No doubt Emperor Jagang had spread their description far and wide and hadoffered a reward large enough that even his enemies would find it hard toresist. For many in the Old World, though, the price of continued life under thebrutal rule of the Imperial Order was too high. Despite the reward, there weremany who hungered to live free and were willing to act to gain that goal.There was also the problem of the bond the Lord Rahl had with the D’Haranpeople; through that ancient bond forged by Richard’s ancestors, D’Harans couldsense where the Lord Rahl was. The Imperial Order could discover where Richardwas by that bond, too. All they had to do was torture the information out of aD’Haran. If one person failed to talk under torture, they would not be shy abouttrying others until they learned what they wanted.As Richard watched, the lone man, once he reached the bottom of the hill, madehis way along the gravel beds lining the bottom of the rocky gullies. Off toRichard’s right the wagon and horses were lifting a long trail of dust. That waswhere the man seemed to be headed.At such a distance it was hard to tell for sure, but Richard doubted that theman was a soldier. He wouldn’t likely be a scout, not in his own homeland, andthey weren’t near the hotbeds of the revolt against the rule of the ImperialOrder. Richard didn’t think there would be any reason for soldiers to be goingthis way, through such uninhabited areas. That was, after all, why he had pickedthis route, heading east to the shadow of the mountains before turning to a morenortherly route back to where they had been.There was also the possibility that the bond had inadvertently revealedRichard’s whereabouts and an army was out looking for him. If the man was asoldier, there could shortly be many more, like ants, swarming down out of thehills.Richard climbed the back side of a short rocky prominence and lay on hisstomach, watching over the top. As the man got closer, Richard could see that helooked young, under thirty years, a bit scrawny, and was dressed nothing at alllike a soldier. By the way he stumbled, he was not used to the terrain, or maybejust not used to traveling. It was tiring walking over ground of loose, sharp,broken rock, especially if it was on a slope, since it never provided any solidplace for a steady stride.The man stopped, stretching his neck to peer at the wagon. Panting from theeffort of making it down the slope, he combed his fine blond hair backrepeatedly with his fingers, then bent at the waist and rested a hand on a kneewhile he caught his breath.When the man straightened and started out once more, crunching through thegravel at the bottom of the wash, Richard slid back down the rock. He used theintervening lay of the land and patches of scraggly pine to screen himself fromsight. He paused from time to time, as he moved closer, to listen for the heavyfootsteps and labored breathing, checking his dead-reckoning estimation of wherethe man would be.From behind a freestanding wall of rock a good sixty feet tall, Richardcarefully peered out for a look. He had managed to close most of the distancewithout the man being aware of his presence. Richard moved silently from tree torock to the back side of slopes, until he was out ahead of the man and in hisline of travel.Still as stone behind a twisted reddish spire of rock jutting from the brokenground, Richard listened to the crunch of footfalls approaching, listened to theman gulping for breath as he climbed over fingers of rock that lay in his way.When the man was not six feet away, Richard stepped out right in front of him.The man gasped, clutching his light travel coat beneath his chin as he cringedback a step.Richard regarded the man without outward emotion, but inside the sword’s powerchurned with the menace of rage restrained. For an instant, Richard felt thepower falter. The magic of the sword keyed off its master’s perception ofdanger, so such hesitation could be because the smaller man didn’t appear to bean immediate threat.The man’s clothes, brown trousers, flaxen shirt, and a light, frayed fustiancoat, had seen better days. He looked to have had a rough time of hisjourney—but then, Richard, too, had put on unassuming clothes in order not toraise suspicion. The man’s backpack looked to hold precious little. Twowaterskins, their straps crisscrossed across his chest, bunching the light coat,were flat and empty. He carried no weapons that Richard saw, not even a knife.The man waited expectantly, as if he feared to be the first to speak.“You appear to be headed for my friends,” Richard said, tipping his head towardthe thin golden plume of dust hanging like a beacon in the sunlight above thedarkening plain, giving the man a chance to explain himself.The man, wide-eyed, shoulders hunched, raked back his hair several times.Richard stood before him like a stone pillar, blocking his way. The man’s blueeyes turned to each side, apparently checking to see if he had an escape routeshould he decide to bolt.“I mean you no harm,” Richard said. “I just want to know what you’re up to.”“Up to?”“Why you’re headed for the wagon.”The man glanced toward the wagon, not visible beyond the craggy folds of rock,then down at Richard’s sword, and finally up into his eyes.“I’m ... looking for help,” he finally said.“Help?”The man nodded. “Yes. I’m searching for the one whose craft is fighting.”Richard cocked his head. “You’re looking for a soldier of some kind?”He swallowed at the frown on Richard’s face. “Yes, that’s right.”Richard shrugged. “The Imperial Order has lots of soldiers. I’m sure that if youkeep looking you will come across some.”The man shook his head. “No. I seek the man from far away—from far to the north.The man who came to bring freedom to many of the oppressed people of the OldWorld. The man who gives us all hope that the Imperial Order—may the Creatorforgive their misguided ways—will be cast out of our lives so that we can be atpeace once again.”“Sorry,” Richard said, “I don’t know anyone like that.”The man didn’t look disappointed by Richard’s words. He looked more like hesimply didn’t believe them. His fine features were pleasant-looking, even thoughhe appeared unconvinced.“Do you think you could”—the man hesitantly lifted an arm out, pointing—”atleast... let me have a drink?”Richard relaxed a bit. “Sure.”He pulled the strap off his shoulder and tossed his waterskin to the man. Hecaught it as if it were precious glass he feared to drop. He pried at thestopper, finally getting it free, and started gulping the water.He stopped abruptly, lowering the waterskin. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to startdrinking all your water right down.”“It’s all right.” Richard gestured for him to drink up. “I have more back at thewagon. You look to need it.”As Richard hooked a thumb behind his wide leather belt, the man bowed his headin thanks before tipping the waterskin up for a long drink.“Where did you hear about this man who fights for freedom?” Richard asked.The man brought the waterskin down again, his eyes never leaving Richard as hepaused to catch his breath. “From many a tongue. The freedom he has spread downhere in the Old World has brought hope to us all.”Richard smiled inwardly at how the bright hope of freedom burned even in a darkplace like the heart of the Old World. There were people everywhere who hungeredfor the same things in life, for a chance to live their life free and by theirown labor to better themselves.Overhead a black-tipped race, wings spread wide, popped into sight as it glidedacross the open swath of sky above the rise of rock to each side. Richard didn’thave his bow, but the race stayed out of range, anyway.The man shrank at seeing the race the way a rabbit would shrink when it saw ahawk.“Sorry I can’t help you,” Richard said when the race had disappeared. He checkedbehind, in the direction of the wagon, out beyond the nearby hill. “I’mtraveling with my wife and family, looking for work, for a place to mind our ownbusiness.”Richard’s business was the revolution, if he was to have a chance for his planto work, and there were a number of people waiting on him in that regard. He hadmore urgent problems, first, though.“But, Lord Rahl, my people need—”Richard spun back around. “Why would you call me that?”“I’m, I’m sorry.” The man swallowed. “I didn’t mean to anger you.”“What makes you think I’m this Lord Rahl?”The man painted his hand up and down in front of Richard as he sputtered, tryingto find words. “You, you, you just... are. I can’t imagine ... what else youwant me to say. I’m sorry if I have offended you by being so forward, LordRahl.”Cara stalked out from behind a rocky spire. “What have we here?”The man gasped in surprise at seeing her as he flinched back yet another step,clutching the waterskin to his chest as if it were a shield of steel.Tom, his silver knife to hand, stepped up out of a gully behind the man,blocking the way should the man decide to run back the way he’d come.The man turned in a circle to see Tom towering behind. As he finally came backaround and saw Kahlan standing beside Richard, he let out another gasp. They allwere wearing dusty traveling clothes, but somehow Richard didn’t suppose that atthat moment they looked at all like simple travelers in search of work.“Please,” the man said, “I don’t mean any harm.”“Take it easy,” Richard said as he stole a sidelong glance at Cara—his wordsmeant not only for the man but the Mord-Sith as well. “Are you alone?” Richardasked him.“Yes, Lord Rahl. I’m on a mission for my people, just as I told you. You are ofcourse to be forgiven your aggressive nature—I would expect nothing less. I wantyou to know I hold no feelings of resentment toward you.”“Why does he think you’re the Lord Rahl?” Cara said to Richard in a tone thatsounded more accusation than question.“I’ve heard the descriptions,” the man put in. Still clutching the waterskin tohis chest, he pointed with the other hand. “And that sword. I’ve heard aboutLord Rahl’s sword.” His gaze moved cautiously to Kahlan. “And the MotherConfessor, of course,” he added, dipping his head.“Of course,” Richard sighed.He’d expected that he would have to hide the sword around strangers, but now heknew just how important that was going to be whenever they went into anypopulated areas. The sword would be relatively easy to hide. Not so with Kahlan.He thought that maybe they could cover her in rags and say she was a leper.The man leaned cautiously out, arm extended, and handed Richard his waterskin.“Thank you, Lord Rahl.”Richard took a long drink of the terrible-tasting water before offering it toKahlan. She lifted hers out for him to see as she declined with a single shakeof her head. Richard took another long swig before replacing the stopper andslinging the strap back over his shoulder.“What’s your name?” he asked.“Owen.”“Well, Owen, why don’t you come back to camp with us for the night. We can fillup your waterskins for you, at least, before you’re on your way in the morning.”Cara was near to bursting as she gritted her teeth at Richard. “Why don’t youjust let me see to—”“I think Owen has problems we can all understand. He’s concerned for his friendsand family. In the morning, he can be on his way, and we can be on ours.”Richard didn’t want the man out there somewhere, in the dark, where theycouldn’t as easily keep an eye on him as they could if he were in camp. In themorning it would be easy enough to make sure that he wasn’t following them. Carafinally understood Richard’s intent and relaxed. He knew she would want anystranger in her sight while Richard and Kahlan were sleeping.Kahlan at his side, Richard started back to the wagon. The man followed, hishead swiveling side to side, from Tom to Cara, and back again.Since they were headed back to the wagon, Richard finished what water remainedin his waterskin while, behind, Owen thanked him for the invitation and promisednot to be any trouble.Richard intended to see to it that Owen kept his promise."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10Up in the wagon, Richard dunked Owen’s two waterskins in the barrel that stillhad water. Owen, sitting with his back pressed against a wheel, glanced up atRichard from time to time, watching expectantly, as Cara glared at him. Caraclearly didn’t like the fellow, but as protective as Mord-Sith were, that didn’tnecessarily mean that it was warranted.For some reason, though, Richard didn’t care for the man, either. It wasn’t somuch that he disliked him, just that he couldn’t warm to the fellow. He waspolite and certainly didn’t look threatening, but there was something about theman’s attitude that made Richard feel... edgy.Tom and Friedrich broke up dried wood they’d collected, feeding it into thesmall fire. The wonderful aroma of pine pitch covered the smell of the nearbyhorses.From time to time Owen cast a fearful eye at Cara, Kahlan, Tom, and Friedrich.By far, though, he seemed most uneasy about Jennsen. He tried to avert his eyesfrom her, tried not to look her directly in the eye, but his gaze kept beingdrawn to her red hair shining in the firelight. When Betty approached toinvestigate the stranger, Owen stopped breathing. Richard told Owen that thegoat just wanted attention. Owen gingerly patted the top of Betty’s head as ifthe goat were a gar that might take off his arm if he weren’t careful.Jennsen, with a smile and ignoring the way he stared at her hair, offered Owensome of her dried meat.Owen just stared wide-eyed up at her leaning down over him.“I’m not a witch,” she said to Owen. “People think my red hair is a sign thatI’m a witch. I’m not. I can assure you, I have no magic.”The edge in her voice surprised Richard, reminding him that there was iron underthe feminine grace.Still wide-eyed, Owen said, “Of course not. I, I... just never saw such ...beautiful hair before, that’s all.”“Why, thank you,” Jennsen said, her smile returning. She again offered him apiece of dried meat.“I’m sorry,” Owen said in polite apology, “but I prefer not to eat meat, if it’sall right with you.”He quickly reached in his pocket, bringing out a cloth pouch holding driedbiscuit. He forced a smile at Jennsen as he held out the biscuits.“Would you like one of mine?”Tom started, glaring at Owen.“Thanks, no,” Jennsen said as she withdrew her extended hand and sat down on alow, flat rock. She snagged Betty by an ear and made her lie down at her feet.“You’d best eat the biscuits yourself if you don’t want meat,” she said to Owen.“I’m afraid we don’t have a lot that isn’t.”“Why don’t you eat meat?” Richard asked.Owen looked up over his shoulder at Richard in the wagon above him. “I don’tlike the thought of harming animals just to satisfy my want of food.”Jennsen smiled politely. “That’s a kindhearted sentiment.”Owen twitched a smile before his gaze was drawn once again to her hair. “It’sjust the way I feel,” he said, finally looking away from her.“Darken Rahl felt the same way,” Cara said, turning the glare on Jennsen. “I sawhim horsewhip a woman to death because he caught her eating a sausage in thehalls of the People’s Palace. It struck him as disrespectful of his feelings.”Jennsen stared in astonishment.“Another time,” Cara went on as she chewed a bite of sausage, “I was with himwhen he came around a corner outside, near the gardens. He spotted a cavalry manatop his horse eating a meat pie. Darken Rahl lashed out with a flash ofconjured lightning, beheading the man’s horse in an instant—thump, it droppedinto the hedge. The man managed to land on his feet as the rest of his horsecrashed to the ground. Darken Rahl reached out, drew the man’s sword, and in afit of anger slashed the belly of the horse open. Then he seized the soldier bythe scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the horse’s innards, screamingat him to eat. The man tried his best, but ended up suffocated in the horse’swarm viscera.”Owen covered his mouth as he closed his eyes.Cara waved her sausage as if indicating Darken Rahl standing before her. “Heturned to me, the fire gone out of him, and asked me how people could be socruel as to eat meat.”Jennsen, her mouth hanging open, asked, “What did you say?”Cara shrugged. “What could I say? I told him I didn’t know.”“But why would people eat meat, then, if he was like that?” Jennsen asked.“Most of the time, he wasn’t. Vendors sold meat at the palace and he usuallypaid it no mind. Sometimes he would shake his head in disgust, or call themcruel, but usually he didn’t even take notice of it.”Friedrich was nodding. “That was the thing about the man—you never knew what hewas going to do. He might smile at a person, or have them tortured to death. Younever knew.”Cara stared into the low flames of the fire before her. “There was no way toreason out how he would react to anything.” Her voice took on a quiet, hauntedquality. “A lot of people simply decided that it was only a matter of time untilhe killed them, too, and so they lived their lives as the condemned would,waiting for the axe to fall, taking no pleasure in life or the thought of theirfuture.”Tom nodded his grim agreement with Cara’s assessment of life in D’Hara as he feda crook of driftwood into the fire.“Is that what you did, Cara?” Jennsen asked.Cara looked up and scowled. “I am Mord-Sith. Mord-Sith are always ready toembrace death. We do not wish to die old and toothless.”Owen, nibbling his dried biscuit as if out of obligation to eat since the restof them were, was clearly shaken by the story. “I can’t imagine life with suchsavagery as all of you must live. Was this Darken Rahl related to you, LordRahl?” Owen suddenly seemed to think he might have made a mistake, and rushed toamend his question. “He has the same name ... so I thought, well, I justthought—but I didn’t mean to imply that I thought you were like him...”Stepping down from the wagon, Richard handed Owen his full waterskins. “He wasmy father.”“I didn’t mean anything by the question. I would never intentionally castaspersions on a man’s father, especially a man who—”“I killed him,” Richard said.Richard didn’t feel like elaborating. He recoiled from the very thought of goinginto the whole dreadful tale.Owen gaped around as if he were a fawn surrounded by wolves.“He was a monster,” Cara said, appearing to feel the need to rise to Richard’sdefense. “Now the people of D’Hara have a chance to look forward to a future ofliving their lives as they wish.”Richard sat down beside Kahlan. “At least they will if they can be free of theImperial Order.”Head down, Owen nibbled on his biscuit as he watched the others.When no one else spoke, Kahlan did. “Why don’t you tell us your reasons forcoming here, Owen.”Richard recognized her tone as that of the Mother Confessor asking a politequestion meant to put a frightened petitioner at ease.He dipped his head respectfully. “Yes, Mother Confessor.”“You know her, too?” Richard asked.Owen nodded. “Yes, Lord Rahl.”“How?”The man’s gaze shifted from Richard to Kahlan and back again.“Word of you and the Mother Confessor has spread everywhere. Word of the way youfreed the people of Altur’Rang from the oppression of the Imperial Order isknown far and wide. Those who want freedom know that you are the one who givesit.”Richard frowned. “What do you mean, I’m the one who gives it?”“Well, before, the Imperial Order ruled. They are brutal—forgive me, they aremisguided and don’t know any better. That is why their rule is so brutal.Perhaps it isn’t their fault. It is not for me to say.” Owen looked away as hetried to come up with words while apparently seeing his own visions of what theImperial Order had done to convince him of their brutality. “Then you came andgave people freedom—just as you did in Altur’Rang.”Richard wiped a hand across his face. He needed to translate the book, he neededto find out what was behind the thing Cara had touched and the black-tippedraces following them, he needed to get back to Victor and those who were engagedin the revolt against the Order, he was past due to meet Nicci, and he needed todeal with his headaches. At least, maybe Nicci could help with that much of it.“Owen, I don’t ‘give’ people freedom.”“Yes, Lord Rahl.”Owen evidently took Richard’s words as something he dared not argue with, buthis eyes clearly said that he didn’t believe it.“Owen, what do you mean when you say that you think I give people freedom?”Owen took a tiny bite of his biscuit as he glanced around at the others. Hesquirmed his shoulders in a self-conscious shrug. Finally, he cleared histhroat.“Well, you, you do what the Imperial Order does—you kill people.” He waved hisbiscuit awkwardly, as if it were a sword, stabbing the air. “You kill those whoenslave people, and then you give the people who were enslaved their freedom sothat peace can return.”Richard took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure if Owen meant it the way it came out,or if it was just that he was having difficulty explaining himself in front ofpeople who made him nervous.“That’s not exactly the way it is,” Richard said.“But that’s why you came down here. Everyone knows it. You came down here to theOld World to give people freedom.”Elbows on his knees, Richard leaned forward rubbing his palms together as hethought about how much he wanted to explain. He felt a wave of calmness whenKahlan draped a gentle, comforting hand over the back of his shoulder. He didn’twant to go into the horror of how he had been taken prisoner and taken fromKahlan, thinking he would never see her again.Richard put the whole weight of emotion over that long ordeal aside and tookanother approach. “Owen, I’m from up in the New World—”“Yes, I know,” Owen said as he nodded. “And you came here to free people from—”“No. That’s not the truth of it. We lived in the New World. We were once atpeace, apparently much like your people were. Emperor Jagang—”“The dream walker.”“Yes, Emperor Jagang, the dream walker, sent his armies to conquer the NewWorld, to enslave our people—”“My people, too.”Richard nodded. “I understand. I know what a horror that is. His soldiers arerampaging up through the New World, murdering, enslaving our people.”Owen turned his watery gaze off into the darkness as he nodded. “My people,too.”“We tried to fight back,” Kahlan told him. “But there are too many. Their armyis far too vast for us to drive them out of our land.”Owen nibbled his biscuit again, not meeting her gaze. “My people are terrifiedof the men of the Order—may the Creator forgive their misguided ways.”“May they scream in agony for all eternity in the darkest shadow of the Keeperof the underworld,” Cara said in merciless correction.Owen stared slack-jawed at such a curse spoken aloud.“We couldn’t fight them like that—simply drive them back to the Old World,”Richard said, bringing Owen’s gaze back to him as he went on with the story. “SoI’m down here, in Jagang’s homeland, helping people who hunger to be free tocast off the shackles of the Order. While he’s away conquering our land, he hasleft his own homeland open to those who hunger for freedom. With Jagang and hisarmies away, that gives us a chance to strike at Jagang’s soft underbelly, to dohim meaningful harm.“I’m doing this because it’s the only way we can fight back against the ImperialOrder—our only means to succeed. If I weaken his foundation, his source of menand support, then he will have to withdraw his army from our land and returnsouth to defend his own.“Tyranny cannot endure forever. By its very nature it rots everything it rules,including itself. But that can take lifetimes. I’m trying to accelerate thatprocess so that I and those I love can be free in our lifetimes—free to live ourown lives. If enough people rise up against the Imperial Order’s rule, it mayeven loosen Jagang’s grip on power and bring him and the Order down.“That’s how I’m fighting him, how I’m trying to defeat him, how I’m trying toget him out of my land.”Owen nodded. “This is what we need, too. We are victims of fate. We need for youto come and get his men out of our land, and then to withdraw your sword, yourways, from our people so we may live in tranquillity again. We need you to giveus freedom.”The driftwood popped, sending a glowing swirl of sparks skyward. Richard,hanging his head, tapped his fingertips together. He didn’t think the man hadheard a word he’d said. They needed rest. He needed to translate the book. Theyneeded to get to where they were going. At least he didn’t have a headache.“Owen, I’m sorry,” he finally said in a quiet voice. “I can’t help you in sodirect a manner. But I would like you to understand that my cause is to youradvantage, too, and that what I’m doing will also cause Jagang to eventuallypull his troops out of your homeland as well, or at least weaken their presenceso that you can throw them out yourselves.”“No,” Owen said. “His men will not leave my land until you come and...” Owenwinced. “And destroy them.”The very word, the implication, looked sickening to the man.“Tomorrow,” Richard said, no longer bothering to try to sound polite, “we haveto be on our way. You will have to be on your way as well. I wish you success inridding your people of the Imperial Order.”“We cannot do such a thing,” Owen protested. He sat up straighten “We are notsavages. You and those like you—the unenlightened ones—it is up to you to do itand give us freedom, I am the only one who can bring you. You must come and doas your kind does. You must give our empire freedom.”Richard rubbed his fingertips across the furrows of his brow. Cara started torise. A look from Richard sat her back down.“I gave you water,” Richard said as he stood. “I can’t give you freedom.”“But you must—”“Double watch tonight,” Richard said as he turned to Cara, cutting Owen off.Cara nodded once as her mouth twisted with a satisfied smile of irondetermination.“In the morning,” Richard added, “Owen will be on his way.”“Yes,” she said, her blue-eyed glare sliding to Owen, “he certainly will be.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11What is it?” Kahlan asked as she rode up beside the wagon.Richard looked to be furious about something. She saw then that he had the bookin one hand; his other was a fist. He opened his mouth, about to speak, but whenJennsen, up on the seat beside Tom, turned back to see what was going on,Richard said to her instead, “Kahlan and I are going to check the road up ahead.Keep your eye on Betty so she doesn’t jump out, will you, Jenn?”Jennsen smiled at him and nodded.“If Betty gives you any trouble,” Tom said, “just let me know and I’ll take herto a lady I know and have some goat sausages made up.”Jennsen grinned at their private joke and gave Tom a good-natured elbow in hisribs. As Richard climbed over the side of the wagon and dropped to the ground,she snapped her fingers at the tail-wagging goat.“Betty! You just stay there. Richard doesn’t need you tagging along every singletime.”Betty, front hooves on the chafing rail, bleated as she looked up at Jennsen, asif asking for her to reconsider.“Down,” Jennsen said in admonishment. “Lie down.”Betty bleated and reluctantly hopped back down into the wagon bed, but she wouldsettle for no less than a scratch behind the ears as consolation before shewould lie down.Kahlan leaned over from her seat in the saddle and untied the reins to Richard’shorse from the back of the wagon. He stepped into the stirrup and gracefullyswung up in one fluid motion. She could see that he was agitated aboutsomething, but it made her heart sing just to look at him.He shifted his weight forward slightly, urging his horse ahead. Kahlan squeezedher legs to the side of her own horse to spur her into a canter to keep up withRichard. He rode out ahead, rounding several turns in the flatter land among therough hillsides, until he caught up with Cara and Friedrich, patrolling out inthe lead.“We’re going to check out front for a while,” he told them. “Why don’t you fallback and check behind.”Kahlan knew that Richard was sending them to the back because if he took Kahlanto the back under the pretense of watching anything that might come up on themfrom behind, Cara would keep falling back to check on them. If they were outfront, Cara wouldn’t worry about them dropping back and getting lost.Cara laid her reins over and turned back. Sweat stuck Kahlan’s shirt to her backas she leaned over her horse’s withers, urging her ahead as Richard’s horsesprang away. Despite the clumps of tall grass dotting the foothills andoccasional sparse patches of woods, the heat was still with them. It cooled someat night, now, but the days were hot, with the humidity increasing as the cloudsbuilt up against the wall of mountains to their right.Up close, the barrier of rugged mountains to the east was an intimidating sight.Sheer rock walls rose up below projecting plateaus heaped to their very edgewith loose rock crumbled from yet higher plateaus and walls, as if the entirerange was all gradually crumbling. With drops of thousands of feet at the fringeof overhanging shelves of rock, climbing such unstable scree would beimpossible. If there were passes through the arid slopes, they were no doubt fewand would prove difficult.But making it past those gray mountains of scorching rock, they could now see,was hardly the biggest problem.Those closer mountains spreading north and south in the burning heat at the edgeof the desert partially hid what lay to the other side—a far more daunting rangeof snowcapped peaks rising up to completely block any passage east. Thoseimposing mountains were beyond the scale of any Kahlan had ever seen. Not eventhe most rugged of the Rang’Shada Mountains in the Midlands were their match.These mountains were like a race of giants. Precipitous walls of rock soaredthousands of feet straight up. Harrowing slopes rose unbroken by any pass orrift and were so arduous that few trees could find a foothold. Lofty snow-packedpeaks that ascended majestically above windswept clouds were jammed so closetogether that it reminded her more of a knife’s long jagged edge than separatesummits.The day before, when Kahlan had seen Richard studying those imposing mountains,she had asked him if he thought there was any way across them. He had said no,that the only way he could see to get beyond was possibly the notch he’d spottedbefore, when he had found the place where the strange boundary had once been,and that notch still lay some distance north.For now, they skirted the dry side of the closer mountains as that range madeits way north along the more easily traversed lowlands.Along the base of a gentle hill covered in clumps of brown grasses, Richardfinally slowed his horse. He turned in his saddle, checking that the others werestill coming, if a goodly distance behind.He pulled his horse close beside her. “I skipped ahead in the book.”Kahlan didn’t like the sound of that. “When I asked you before why you didn’tskip ahead, you said that it wasn’t a wise thing to do.”“I know, but I wasn’t really getting anywhere and we need answers.” As theirhorses settled into a comfortable walk, Richard rubbed his shoulders. “After allthat heat I can’t believe how cold it’s getting.”“Cold? What are you—”“You know those rare people like Jennsen?” The leather of his saddle squeaked ashe leaned toward her. “Ones born pristinely ungifted—without even that tinyspark of the gift? The pillars of Creation? Well, back when this book waswritten, they weren’t so rare.”“You mean it was more common for them to be born?”“No, the ones who had been born began to grow up, get married, and havechildren—ungifted children.”Kahlan looked over in surprise. “The broken links in the chain of the gift thatyou were talking about, before?”Richard nodded. “They were children of the Lord Rahl. Back then, it wasn’t likeit has been in recent times with Darken Rahl, or his father. From what I cantell, all the children of the Lord Rahl and his wife were part of his family,and treated as such, even though they were born with this problem. It seems thatthe wizards tried to help them—both the direct offspring, and then theirchildren, and their children. They tried to cure them.”“Cure them? Cure them of what?”Richard lifted his arms in a heated gesture of frustration. “Of being bornungifted—of being born without even that tiny spark of the gift like everyoneelse has. The wizards back then tried to restore the breaks in the link.”“How did they think they would be able to cure someone of not having even thespark of the gift?”Richard pressed his lips together as he thought of a way to explain it. “Well,you know the wizards who sent you across the boundary to find Zedd?”“Yes,” Kahlan said in a suspicious drawl.“They weren’t born with the gift—born wizards, that is. What were they—second orthird wizards? Something like that? You told me about them, once.” He snappedhis fingers as it came to him. “Wizards of the third Order. Right?”“Yes. Just one, Giller, was the Second Order. None were able to pass the teststo be a wizard of the First Order, like Zedd, because they didn’t have the gift.Being wizards was their calling, but they weren’t gifted in the conventionalsense—but they still had that spark of the gift that everyone has.”“That’s what I’m talking about,” Richard said. “They weren’t born with the giftto be wizards—just the spark of it like everyone else. Yet Zedd somehow trainedthem to be able to use magic—to be wizards—even though they weren’t born thatway, born with the gift to be wizards.”“Richard, that was a lifetime of work.”“I know, but the point is that Zedd was able to help them to be wizards—at leastwizards enough to pass his tests and conjure magic.”“Yes, I suppose. When I was young they taught me about the workings of magic andthe Wizard’s Keep, about those people and creatures in the Midlands with magic.They may not have been born with the gift, but they had worked a lifetime tobecome wizards. They were wizards,” she insisted.Richard’s mouth turned up with the kind of smile that told her that she had justframed the essence of his argument for him. “But they had not been born withthat aspect, that attribute, of the gift.” He leaned toward her. “Zedd, besidestraining them, must have used magic to help them become wizards, right?”Kahlan frowned at the thought. “I don’t know. They never told me about theirtraining to become wizards. That was never germane to their relationship with meor my training.”“But Zedd has Additive Magic,” Richard pressed. “Additive can change things, addto them, make them more than they are.”“All right,” Kahlan cautiously agreed. “What’s the point?”“The point is that Zedd took people who weren’t born with the gift to be wizardsand he trained them but—more importantly—he must have also used his power tohelp them along that path by altering how they were born. He had to have addedto their gift to make them more than they were born to be.” Richard glanced overat her as his horse stepped around a small, scraggly pine. “He altered peoplewith magic.”Kahlan let out a deep breath as she looked away from Richard and ahead at thegentle spread of grassy hills to either side of them, as she tried to fullygrasp the concept of what he was saying.“I never considered that before, but all right,” she finally said. “So, what ofit?”“We thought that only the wizards of old could do such a thing, but, apparently,it’s not a lost art nor would it be entirely so far-fetched as I had imaginedfor the wizards back then to believe they could change what was, into what theythought it ought to be. What I’m saying is that, like what Zedd did to givepeople that with which they were not born, so too did the wizards of old try togive people born as pillars of Creation a spark of the gift.”Kahlan felt a chill of realization. The implication was staggering. Not just thewizards of old, but Zedd, too, had used magic to alter the very nature ofpeople, the very nature of what they were, how they were born.She supposed that he had only helped them to achieve what was their greatestambition in life—their calling—by enhancing what they already had been bornwith. He helped them to reach their full potential. But that was for men who hadthe innate potential. While the wizards of long ago probably had done similarthings to help people, they had also sometimes used their power for lessbenevolent reasons.“So,” he said, “the wizards back then, who were experienced in altering people’sabilities, thought that these people called the pillars of Creation could becured.”“Cured of not having been born gifted,” she said in a flat tone of incredulity.“Not exactly. They weren’t trying to make them into wizards, but they thoughtthey could at least be cured of not having that infinitesimal spark of the giftthat simply enabled them to interact with magic.”Kahlan took a purging breath. “So then what happened?”“This book was written after the great war had ended—after the barrier had beencreated and the Old World had been sealed away. It was written after the NewWorld was at peace, or, at least, after the barrier kept the Old Worldcontained.“But remember what we found out before? That we think that during the war WizardRicker and his team had done something to halt Subtractive Magic’s ability to bepassed on to the offspring of wizards? Well, after the war, those born with thegift started becoming increasingly uncommon, and those who were being born werebeing born without the Subtractive side.”“So, after the war,” she said, “those who were born with the gift of bothAdditive and Subtractive were rapidly becoming nonexistent. We already knewthat.”“Right.” Richard leaned toward her and lifted the book. “But then, when thereare fewer wizards being born, all of a sudden the wizards additionally realizethat they have all these pristinely ungifted—breaks altogether in the link tomagic—on their hands. Suddenly, on top of the problem of the birth rate of thosewith the gift to be wizards dropping, they were faced with what they calledpillars of Creation.”Kahlan swayed in the saddle as she thought about it, trying to imagine thesituation at the Keep at the time. “I can see that they would have been prettyconcerned.”His voice lowered meaningfully. “They were desperate.”Kahlan laid her reins over, moving in behind Richard as his horse stepped aroundan ancient, fallen tree that had been bleached silver from the sweltering sun.“So, I suppose,” Kahlan asked as she walked her horse back up beside him, “thatthe wizards started to do the same thing Zedd did? Trained those who had thecalling—those who wished to be wizards but had not been born with the gift?”“Yes, but back then,” Richard said, “they trained those with only Additive to beable to use the Subtractive, too, like full wizards of the time. As time wenton, though, even that was being lost to them, and they were only able to do whatZedd did—train men to be wizards but they could only wield Additive Magic.“But that isn’t really what the book is about,” Richard said as he gestureddismissively. “That was just a side point to record what they had attempted.They started out with confidence. They thought that these pillars of Creationcould be cured of being pristinely ungifted, much like wizards with onlyAdditive could be trained to use both sides of the magic, and those without thegift for wizardry could be made wizards able to use at least the Additive sideof it.”The way he used his hands when he talked reminded her of the way Zedd did whenhe became worked up. “They tried to modify the very nature of how these peoplehad been born. They tried to take people without any spark of the gift, andalter them in a desperate attempt to give them the ability to interact withmagic. They weren’t just adding or enhancing, they were trying to createsomething out of nothing.”Kahlan didn’t like the sound of that. They knew that in those ancient times thewizards had great power, and they altered people with the gift, manipulatedtheir gift, to suit a specific purpose.They created weapons out of people.In the great war, Jagang’s ancestors were one such weapon: dream walkers. Dreamwalkers were created to be able to take over the minds of people in the NewWorld and control them. Out of desperation, the bond of the Lord Rahl wascreated to counter that weapon, to protect a people from the dream walkers.Any number of human weapons were conjured from the gifted. Such changes wereoften profound, and they were irrevocable. At times, the creations were monstersof boundless cruelty. From this heritage, Jagang had been born.During that great war, one of the wizards who had been put on trial for treasonrefused to reveal what damage he had done. When even torture failed to gain theman’s confession, the wizards conducting the trial turned to the talents of awizard named Merritt and ordered the creation of a Confessor. Magda Searus, thefirst Confessor, extracted the man’s confession. The tribunal was so pleasedwith the results of Wizard Merritt’s conjuring that they commanded that an orderof Confessors be created.Kahlan felt no different than other people felt, she was no less human, no lessa woman, loved life no less, but her Confessor’s power was the result of thatconjuring. She, too, was a descendant of women altered to be weapons—in thiscase weapons designed to find the truth.“What’s the matter?” Richard asked.She glanced over and saw the look of concern on his face. Kahlan forced a smileand shook her head that it was nothing.“So what is it that you discovered by jumping ahead in the book?”Richard took a deep breath as he folded his hands over the pommel of the saddle.“Essentially, they were attempting to use color in order to help people bornwithout eyes ... to see.”From Kahlan’s understanding of magic and of history, this was fundamentallydifferent from even the most malevolent experiments to alter people intoweapons. Even in the most vile of these instances, they were attempting to takeaway some attribute of their humanity and at the same time add to or enhance anelemental ability. In none of it were they trying to create that which was notthere at all.“In other words,” Kahlan summed up, “they failed.”Richard nodded. “So, here they were, the great war was long over and the OldWorld—those who had wanted to end magic, much like the Imperial Order—was safelysealed away beyond the barrier that had been created. Now they find out that thebirth rate of those carrying the gift of wizardry is plummeting, and that themagic engendered by the House of Rahl, the bond with his people designed to stopthe dream walkers from taking them, has an unexpected consequence—it also givesbirth to the pristinely ungifted, who are an irreversible break in the lineageof magic.”“They have two problems, then,” Kahlan said. “They have fewer wizards being bornto deal with problems of magic, and they have people being born with no link atall to the magic.”“That’s right. And the second problem was growing faster than the first. In thebeginning, they thought they would find a solution, a cure. They didn’t. Worse,as I explained before, those born of the pristinely ungifted, like Jennsen,always bear children the same as they. In a few generations, the number of thepeople without the link to the gift was growing faster than anyone everexpected.”Kahlan let out a deep breath. “Desperate indeed.”“It was becoming chaos.”She hooked a loose strand of hair back. “What did they decide?”Richard regarded her with one of those looks that told her he was prettydisturbed by what he’d found.“They chose magic over people. They deemed that this attribute—magic, or thosewho possessed it—was more important than human life.” His voice rose. “Here theytook the very thing they fought the war over, the right of those who were bornthe way they were—in that case people born with magic—to their own lives, toexist, and they turned it all around to be that this attribute was moreimportant than the life which held it!”He let out a breath and lowered his voice. “There were too many to execute, sothey did the next best thing—they banished them.”Kahlan’s eyebrows went up. “Banished them? To where?”Richard leaned toward her with fire in his eyes. “The Old World.”“What!”Richard shrugged, as if speaking on behalf of the wizards back then, mockingtheir reasoning. “What else could they do? They could hardly execute them; theywere friends and family. Many of those normal people with the spark of thegift—but who were not gifted as wizards or sorceresses and so didn’t think ofthemselves as gifted—had sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,cousins, neighbors who had married these pristinely ungifted, these pillars ofCreation. They were part of society—a society which was less and less populatedby the truly gifted.“In a society where they were increasingly outnumbered and mistrusted, theruling gifted couldn’t bring themselves to put all these tainted people todeath.”“You mean they even considered it?”Richard’s eyes told her that they had and what he thought of the notion. “But inthe end, they couldn’t. At the same time, after trying everything, they nowrealized that they couldn’t ever restore the link to magic once it was broken bythese people, and such people were marrying and having children, and thechildren were marrying and having children—who in every case passed along thistaint. And, those so tainted were increasing in numbers faster than anyone hadimagined.“As far as the gifted were concerned, their very world was threatened, in muchthe same way it had been threatened by the war. That was, after all, what thosein the Old World had been trying to do—destroy magic—and here it was, the verything they feared, happening.“They couldn’t repair the damage, they couldn’t stop it from spreading, and theycouldn’t put to death all those among them. At the same time, with the taintmultiplying, they knew that they were running out of time. So, they settled onwhat to them was the only way out—banishment.”“And they could cross the barrier?” she asked.“Those with the gift, for all practical purposes, were prevented from crossingthe barrier, but for those who were pillars of Creation, magic did not exist;they were unaffected by it, so, to them, the barrier was not an obstacle.”“How could those in charge be sure they had all the pillars of Creation? If anyescaped, the banishment would fail to solve their problem.”“Those with the gift—wizards and sorceresses—can somehow recognize thosepristinely ungifted for what they are: holes in the world, as Jennsen said thoselike her were called. The gifted can see them, but not sense them with theirgift. Apparently, it wasn’t a problem to know who the pillars of Creation were.”“Can you tell any difference?” Kahlan asked. “Can you sense Jennsen as beingdifferent? Being a hole in the world?”“No. But I’ve not been taught to use my ability. How about you?”Kahlan shook her head. “I’m not a sorceress, so I guess that I don’t have theability to detect those like her.” She shifted her weight in her saddle. “So,what happened with those people back then?”“The people of the New World collected all those ungifted offspring of the Houseof Rahl and their every single last descendant, and sent the whole lot of themacross the great barrier, to the Old World, where the people had professed thatthey wanted mankind to be free of magic.”Richard smiled with the irony, even of such a grim event as this. “The wizardsof the New World, in essence, gave their enemy in the Old World exactly whatthey professed to want, what they had been fighting for: mankind without magic.”His smile withered. “Can you imagine deciding that we had to banish Jennsen andsend her into some fearful unknown, simply because of the fact that she can’tsee magic?”Kahlan shook her head as she tried to envision such a time. “What a horror, tobe uprooted and sent away, especially to the enemy of your own people.”Richard rode in silence for a time. Finally, he went on with the story. “It wasa terrifying event for those banished, but it was also traumatic almost beyondendurance to those who were left. Can you even imagine what it must have beenlike. All those friends and relatives suddenly ripped out of your life, yourfamily? The disruption to trade and livelihood?” Richard’s words came withbitter finality. “All because they decided some attribute was more importantthan human life.”Just listening to the story, Kahlan felt as if she had been through an ordeal.She watched Richard riding beside her, staring off, lost in his own thoughts.“Then what?” she finally asked. “Did they ever hear from those who werebanished?”He shook his head. “No, nothing. They were now beyond the great barrier. Theywere gone.”Kahlan stroked her horse’s neck, just to feel the comfort of something alive.“What did they do about those who were born after that?”Still he stared off. “Killed them.”Kahlan swallowed in revulsion. “I can’t imagine how they could do that.”“They could tell, once the child was born, if it was ungifted. It was said to beeasier then, before it was named.”Kahlan couldn’t find her voice for a moment. “Still,” she said in a weak voice,“I can’t imagine it.”“It’s no different from what Confessors did about the birth of male Confessors.”His words cut through her. She hated the memory of those times. Hated the memoryof a male child being born to a Confessor. Hated the memory of them being put todeath by command of the mother.There was said to be no choice. Male Confessors in the past had had noself-control over their power. They became monsters, started wars, causedunimaginable suffering.It was argued that there was no choice but to put a male child of a Confessor todeath, before they were named.Kahlan couldn’t force herself to look up into Richard’s eyes. The witch woman,Shota, had foretold that she and Richard would conceive a male child. NeitherKahlan nor Richard would ever for an instant consider harming any child oftheirs, a child resulting from their love for one another, from their love oflife. She couldn’t imagine putting a child of theirs to death for being born amale child of her as a Confessor, or an ungifted male or female child of Richardfor being a Rahl. How could anyone say that such a life had no right to existbecause of who they were, what they were like, or what they might possiblybecome.“Somewhere along the line after this book was written,” Richard said in a quietvoice, “things changed. When this book was written, the Lord Rahl of D’Haraalways married, and they knew when he produced an offspring. When the child waspristinely ungifted, they ended its life as mercifully as they could.“At some point, ruling wizards of the House of Rahl became like Darken Rahl.They took any woman they wanted, whenever they wanted. The details, such as ifan ungifted child born of those couplings was actually a pillar of Creation,became unimportant to them. They simply killed any offspring, except the giftedheir.”“But they were wizards—they could have told which ones were like that and atleast not killed the rest.”“If they wanted, I suppose they could have, but, like Darken Rahl, their onlyinterest was in the single gifted heir. They simply killed the rest.”“So, such offspring hid for fear of their life and one managed to escape thegrasp of Darken Rahl until you killed him first. And so you have a sister,Jennsen.”Richard’s smile returned. “And so I do.”Kahlan followed his gaze and saw distant specks, black-tipped races, watching,as they soared on the updrafts of the high cliffs of the mountains to the east.She took a purging breath of the hot, humid air. “Richard, those ungiftedoffspring that were banished to the Old World, do you think they survived?”“If the wizards in the Old World didn’t slaughter them.”“But everyone down here in the Old World is the same as in the New World. I’vefought against the soldiers from here—with Zedd and the Sisters of the Light. Weused magic of every sort to try to halt the Order’s advance. I can tell youfirsthand that all those from the Old World are affected by magic, so that meansthey all are born with that spark of the gift. There are no broken links in thechain of magic in the Old World.”“From everything I’ve seen down here, I’d have to agree.”Kahlan wiped sweat from her brow. It was running into her eyes. “So whathappened to those banished people?”Richard gazed off toward the mountains beneath the races. “I can’t imagine. Butit must have been horrifying for them.”“So you think that maybe that was the end of them? That maybe they perished, orwere put to death?”He regarded her with a sidelong glance. “I don’t know. But what I’d like to knowis why that place back there is named the same as they were called in this book:the Pillars of Creation.” His eyes took on a menacing gleam. “And far worse yet,I’d like to know why, as Jennsen told us, a copy of this book is among Jagang’smost prized possessions.”That troublesome thought had been running through Kahlan’s mind as well.She looked up at him from beneath a frown. “Maybe you shouldn’t have skippedahead in your reading of the book, Lord Rahl.”Richard’s fleeting smile wasn’t all she’d hoped for. “I’ll be relieved if that’sthe biggest mistake I’ve made, lately.”“What do you mean?”He raked his hair back. “Is anything different about your Confessor’s power?”“Different?” Almost involuntarily, his question caused her to draw back, tofocus inwardly, to take stock of the force she always felt within herself. “No.It feels the same as always.”The power coiled in the core of her being did not need to be summoned when therewas need of it. As always, it was there at the ready; it only required that sherelease her restraint of it for it to be unleashed.“There’s something wrong with the sword,” he said, catching her by surprise.“Wrong with its power.”Kahlan couldn’t imagine what to make of such a notion. “How can you tell? What’sdifferent?”Richard idly stroked his thumbs along the reins turned back over his fingers.“It’s hard to define exactly what’s different. I’m just used to the feeling ofit being at my beck and call. It responds when I need it, but for some reason itseems to be hesitant about doing so.”Kahlan felt that now, more than ever, they needed to get back to Aydindril andsee Zedd. Zedd was the keeper of the sword. Even though they couldn’t take thesword through the sliph, Zedd would be able to give them insight about anynuance of its power. He would know what to do. He would be able to help Richardwith the headaches, too.And Kahlan knew that Richard needed help. She could see that he wasn’t himself.His gray eyes held a glaze of pain, but there was something more etched in hisexpression, in the way he moved, the way he carried himself.The whole explanation of the book and what he had discovered seemed to havesapped his strength.She was beginning to think that it wasn’t she, after all, who was the onerunning out of time, but that it was Richard. That thought, despite the warmafternoon sun, sent cold terror racing through her.Richard checked the others over his shoulder. “Let’s go back to the wagon. Ineed to get something warmer to put on. It’s freezing today.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12Zedd peered up the deserted street. He could have sworn that he saw someone.Using his gift to search for any sign of life told him that there was no oneanywhere around. Still, he remained motionless as he stared.The warm breeze pressed his simple robes against his bony frame and gentlyruffled his disheveled white hair. A tattered, sun-faded blue dress that someonehad pinned to a second-floor balcony railing to dry flapped like a flag in thewind. The dress, along with a city full of personal possessions, had long agobeen left behind.The buildings, their walls painted various colors from a rusty red to yellowwith shutters in bright, contrasting hues, stuck out to slightly varying degreeson either side of the narrow cobbled street, making a canyon of colorful walls.Most of the second stories overhung the bottom floors by a few feet, and, withtheir eaves hanging out even more, the buildings closed off the better part ofthe sky except for a snaking slit of afternoon sunlight that followed thesinuous course of the street up and over the gentle hill. The doors were alltightly shut, most of the windows shuttered. A pale green gate to an alleywayhung open, squeaking as it swung to and fro in the breeze.Zedd decided that it must have been a trick of the light that he’d seen, maybe awindowpane that had moved in the wind sending a flicker of light across a wall.When he was at last sure that he had been mistaken about seeing anyone, Zeddstarted back down the street, yet remained close to one side, walking as quietlyas possible. The Imperial Order army had not returned to the city since Zedd hadunleashed the light web that had killed an enormous number of their force, butthat didn’t mean that there couldn’t be dangers about.No doubt Emperor Jagang still wanted the city, and especially the Keep, but hewas no fool and he knew that a few more light webs ignited among his army, nomatter how vast it was, would in that instant reduce his force by suchstaggering numbers that it could alter the course of the war. Jagang had foughtagainst the Midland and D’Haran forces for a year and in all those battles hehad not lost as many men as he’d lost in that one blinding moment. He would notcasually risk another such event.After such a blow Jagang would want to capture the Keep more than he had everwanted it before. He would want Zedd more than ever before.Had Zedd more of the light webs like the one his frantic search through the Keephad turned up, he would have already unleashed them all on the Order. He sighed.If only he had more.Still, Jagang didn’t know that he had no more such constructed spells. As longas Jagang feared that there were more, it served Zedd’s purpose in keeping theImperial Order out of Aydindril and away from the Wizard’s Keep.Some harm had been done to the Confessors’ Palace when Jagang had been gulledinto attacking, but Zedd judged that trying that trick had been worth theregrettable damage; it had almost netted him and Adie the emperor’s hide. Damagecould always be repaired. He vowed that it would be repaired.Zedd clenched a fist at how close he had come to finishing Jagang that day. Atleast he had dealt a mighty blow to his army.And Zedd might have had Jagang had it not been for that strange young woman. Heshook his head at the memory of actually seeing one who could not be touched bymagic. He’d known, in theory, of their existence, but had never before known itfor certain to be true. Vague references in old books made for interestingabstract speculation, but seeing it with his own eyes was quite something else.It had been an unsettling sight. Adie had been shaken by the encounter even morethan he; she was blind, yet with the aid of the gift could see better than hecould. That day, she had not been able to see the young woman who was there,but, in some ways, not there. To Zedd’s eyes, if not his gift, she was abeautiful sight, with some of Darken Rahl’s looks, but different and altogethercaptivating. That she was half sister to Richard was clear; she shared some ofhis features, especially the eyes. If only Zedd could have stopped her, kept herout of the way, convinced her that she was making a terrible mistake by beingwith the Order, or even if he could have killed her, Jagang would not haveescaped justice.Still, Zedd held no illusions about ending the threat of the Imperial Ordersimply by killing Jagang. Jagang was merely the brute who led other brutes inenforcing blind faith in the Order, a blind faith that embraced death assalvation from what it preached was the corrupt misery of life, a blind faith inwhich life itself had no value but as a bloody sacrifice upon the altar ofaltruism, a blind faith that blamed the failure of its own ideas on mankind forbeing wicked and for failing to offer sufficient sacrifice in an endless questfor some illusive greater good that grew ever more distant, a blind faith in anOrder that clung to power by feeding off the carcasses of the productive livesit ruined.A faith that by its very beliefs rejected reason and embraced the irrationalcould not long endure without intimidation and force—without brutes like Jagangto enforce such faith.While Emperor Jagang was brutally effective, it was a mistake to think that ifJagang were to die that very day it would end the threat of the Order. It wasthe Order’s ideas that were so dangerous; the priests of the Order would findother brutes.The only real way to end the Order’s reign of terror was to expose the nakedevil of its teachings to the light of truth, and for those suffering under itsdoctrines to throw off the Order’s yoke. Until then, they would have to fightthe Imperial Order back as best they could, hoping at least to eventuallycontain them.Zedd poked his head around a corner, watching, listening, sniffing the wind forany trace of anyone who might be lurking about. The city was deserted, but on anumber of occasions stray Imperial Order soldiers had wandered in out of themountains.After the destruction caused by the light web, panic had swept through theOrder’s encampment. Many soldiers had scattered to the hills. Once the army hadregrouped, a large number of men had decided to desert instead of returning totheir units. Tens of thousands of such deserters were rounded up and executed,their bodies left to rot as a warning of what happened to those who abandonedthe cause of the greater glory of the Imperial Order, or as the Order liked toput it, the cause of the greater good. Most of the rest of the men who had runto the hills had then had a change of heart and straggled back into camp.There were still some, though, who had not wanted to go back and had not beencaught. For a time, after Jagang’s army had moved on, they had wandered into thecity, sometimes alone, sometimes in small groups, half starved, to search forfood and to loot. Zedd had lost count of how many such men he had killed.He was reasonably sure that all of those stragglers were dead, now. The Orderwas made up of men mostly from cities and towns. Such men weren’t used to livingin the wild. Their job was to overwhelm the enemy, to kill, rape, terrorize, andplunder. A whole corps of logistics personnel provided them with support,delivering and dispensing a constant stream of supplies that rolled in to feedand care for the soldiers. They were violent men, but they were men who neededto be tended, who depended on the group for their survival. They didn’t lastlong on their own in the trackless forested mountains surrounding Aydindril.But Zedd hadn’t seen any of them for quite some time. He was reasonably surethat the stragglers had starved, been killed, or had long ago headed back south,to the Old World.There was always the possibility, though, that Jagang had sent assassins toAydindril; some of those assassins could be Sisters of the Light, or worse,Sisters of the Dark. For that reason, Zedd rarely left the safety of the Keep,and when he did, he was cautious. Too, he hated poking around the city, seeingit so devoid of life. This had been his home for much of his life. He rememberedthe days when the Keep was a hub of activity—not as it once had been, he knew,but alive with people of all sorts. He found himself smiling at the memory.His smile faded. Now the city was a joyless sight, forlorn without peoplefilling the streets, people talking from one balcony to a neighbor across thestreet in another window, people gathering to trade goods in the market. Not solong ago men would have stopped to have conversations in doorways while vendorspulled carts of their wares along the narrow streets and children at playskipped through the throngs. Zedd sighed at the sad sight of such lifelessstreets.At least those lives were safe, if a long way from home. Although he had manyfundamental differences with the Sisters of the Light, he knew that theirPrelate, Verna, and the rest of the free Sisters would watch over them.The only problem was that now that Jagang had nothing in Aydindril of any realvalue to conquer except the Keep, and much to lose, he had wheeled his army easttoward the remnants of the Midland forces. To be sure, the D’Haran army waitedacross those mountains to the east and Zedd knew how formidable they were, buthe couldn’t fool himself that they stood a chance against a force as immense asthe Imperial Order.Jagang had left the city in order to go after those D’Haran forces. The ImperialOrder could not win the war by occupying an empty city; they needed to crush anyresistance once and for all so that there would be no people left who could, byliving prosperous, happy, peaceful lives, put the lie to the Order’s teachings.Now that Jagang had come all the way up through the Midlands, he had cleaved theNew World. Forces had been left all along the route to occupy cities and towns.Now the main force of the Order would turn its blood lust east, on a loneD’Hara. By dividing the New World in such a way, Jagang would be able to moreefficiently crush opposition.Zedd knew that it wasn’t for lack of trying that the New World had given ground.He and Kahlan, among a great many others, had worked themselves sick, monthafter month, trying to find a way to stop Jagang’s forces.Zedd clutched his robes at his throat, at the painful memory of such ferociousfighting, at how nothing had worked against Jagang’s numbers, at the death anddying, at the friends he had lost. It was only a matter of time until all waslost to the hordes from the Old World.Richard and Kahlan would not survive such a conquest by the Imperial Order.Zedd’s thin fingers covered his trembling lips at the ghastly thought of thembeing lost, too. They were the only family he had left. They were everything tohim.Zedd felt a crushing wave of hopelessness, and had to sit on the stump of a logsection set outside a shoe shop that had been boarded closed. Once the ImperialOrder finally annihilated all opposition, Jagang would return to take the cityand lay siege to the Keep. Sooner or later, he would have it all.The future, as Zedd imagined it, seemed to be a world shrouded in the gray pallof life under the Imperial Order. If the world fell under that pall, it wouldprobably be a very long time before mankind ever emerged to live free again.Once liberty was surrendered to tyranny, it could be smothered for centuriesbefore its flames again sprang to life and brightened the world.Zedd hadn’t sat for long when he forced himself to his feet. He was FirstWizard. He had been in hopeless straits before and had seen the foe turned back.There was still the possibility that he and Adie could find something in theKeep that would aid them, or that they might yet discover information in thelibraries that would give them a valuable advantage.As long as there was life, they could fight on toward their goal. They still hadthe ability to triumph.He harrumphed to himself. He would triumph.Zedd was glad that Adie wasn’t with him to see him in such a sorry state that hewould have—if even momentarily—considered defeat. Adie would have never let himhear the end of it, and deservedly so.He harrumphed again. He was hardly inexperienced, hardly without the wherewithalto handle challenges that arose. And if there were assassins about, gifted ornot, they would find themselves caught up by one of the many little surprises hehad left around. Very nasty surprises.Chin up, Zedd smiled to himself as he turned down a narrow alley, making his waypast a patchwork of yards with empty pens that had once held chickens, geese,ducks, and pigeons. His gaze passed over small back courtyards, their herbs andflowers growing untended, their wash lines empty, their wood and other materialsstacked to the sides, waiting for people to return and work them into somethinguseful.Along the way he stopped in various vegetable gardens, harvesting the volunteercrops that had sprung up. There was lettuce aplenty, spinach, some small squash,green tomatoes, and still a few peas. He collected his bounty in a canvas sackand slung it over a shoulder as he walked the garden plots, checking on theprogress of irregular patches of onions, beets, beans, and turnips. Still somegrowing to do, he concluded.While the vegetables weren’t thick from a careful planting, the random growth inyards all over the city meant that he and Adie would have fresh vegetables forsome time to come. Maybe she might even take to putting some things up for nextwinter. They could store root crops in the colder places in the Keep, andpreserve more perishable vegetables. They would have more food than they couldeat.On his way up the alley, Zedd spied a bush off toward the corner, sprawled greenand lush over a short back fence between two homes. The blackberry bush wasloaded with ripe berries. He paused occasionally to check up and down thestreets beyond while he made a nice-sized pile of the dark, plump berries in asquare of cloth, then tied it up and placed it atop the heavier goods in hissack.There were still plenty of ripe berries, and he hated to let them go to waste,or to the birds, so he worked at filling his pockets. He didn’t worry that itwould spoil his dinner; it was a long walk back up the mountain to the Wizard’sKeep, so he could use a snack. Adie was making a thick stew from cured ham.There was no danger that he would spoil his appetite on mere berries. She wouldbe pleased by the vegetables he brought and would no doubt want to add them tothe stew straightaway. Adie was a wonderful cook, although he dared not admit itto her lest she get a big head. Before the stone bridge, Zedd paused, gazingback down the wide road leading up the mountainside. Only the wind in the treesand their shimmering leaves created any sound or movement. For a long moment,though, he stared down at the empty road.Finally, he turned back to the bridge that in less than three hundred pacesspanned a chasm with near vertical sides dropping away for thousands of feet.Clouds far below hung hard against the sheer rock walls. Despite the countlesstimes he had walked over the stone bridge, it still made him feel just a littlequeasy. Without wings, though, there was but this single way into theKeep—except for the little trick passage he had used as a boy.Because of their strategic role, Zedd had placed enough snares and traps alongthe bridge and the rest of the road up to the Keep that no one was going to livefor more than a few paces once they came close. Not even a Sister of the Darkcould trespass here. A few Sisters had attempted the impossible, and had paidwith their lives.They would have suspected such webs laid by the First Wizard himself, and feltsome of the warning shields, but no doubt Jagang had given them no choice in thematter and had sent them to attempt entry, sacrificing their lives for thegreater good of the Order.Verna had once briefly been taken captive by the dream walker and she had toldZedd all about the experience in the hope that they might find a counter, otherthan swearing loyalty in one’s heart to the Lord Rahl and thereby invoking theprotection of the bond. Zedd had tried, but there was no countermagic he couldprovide. In the great war, wizards far more talented than he, and with bothsides of the gift, had tried to devise defenses against dream walkers. Once thedream walker had taken over a person’s mind, there was no defense; you had to dohis bidding, regardless of the cost, even if the cost was your life.Zedd suspected that for a few, death was a coveted release from the agony ofpossession by the dream walker. Suicide was a course blocked by Jagang; heneeded the talents of the Sisters and other gifted. He couldn’t have them allkill themselves for release from the misery of life as his chattel. But if hesent them to their certain death, such as attempting to enter the Keep, thenthey could at last be free of the agony that had become their life.Ahead, the Keep towered on the mountainside. The soaring walls of dark stone,intimidating to most people, offered Zedd the warm sense of home. His eyesroamed the ramparts, and he remembered strolling there with his wife so manyyears ago—a lifetime ago, it seemed. From the towers he had often looked down atthe beautiful sight of Aydindril below. He had once marched across the bridgesand passageways to deliver orders defending the Midlands from an invasion fromD’Hara, led by Darken Rahl’s father.That, too, seemed a lifetime ago. Now Richard, his grandson, was the Lord Rahl,and had succeeded in uniting most of the Midlands under the rule of the D’HaranEmpire. Zedd shook his head at the wonder of it, at the thought of how Richardhad changed everything. By Richard’s hand, Zedd was now a subject of the D’HaranEmpire. What a wonder indeed.Before he reached the far side of the bridge, Zedd glanced down into the chasm.Movement caught his attention. Putting his bony fingers on the rough stone, heleaned out a little for a look. Below, but above the clouds, he saw two hugebirds, black as moonless midnight, gliding along through the split in themountain. Zedd had never seen the like of them. He couldn’t imagine what to makeof the sight.When he turned back to the Keep, he thought he saw three more of the same kindof large black birds flying together, high above the Keep. He decided that theyhad to be ravens. Ravens were big. He must simply be misjudging thedistance—probably from lack of food. Concluding that they had to be ravens, hetried to adjust his estimation of their distance, but they were already gone. Heglanced down, but didn’t see the other two, either.As he passed under the iron portcullis, feeling the warm embrace of the Keep’sspell, Zedd felt a wave of loneliness. He so missed Erilyn, his long-dead wife,as well as his long-passed daughter, Richard’s mother, and, dear spirits, hemissed Richard. He smiled then, thinking of Richard being with his own wife,now. It was still sometimes hard for him to think of Richard as grown into aman. He had had a wondrous time helping to raise Richard. What a time that hadbeen in his life, off in Westland, away from the Midlands, away from magic andresponsibility, with just that ever curious boy and a whole world of wonders toexplore and show him.What a time indeed. Inside the Keep, lamps along the wall obediently sprang toflame as First Wizard Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander made his way along passageways andthrough grand rooms, deeper into the immense mountain fortress. As he passed thewebs he’d placed, he checked the texture of their magic to find that they wereundisturbed. He sighed in relief. He didn’t expect that anyone would be foolishenough to try to enter the Keep, but the world had fools to spare. He didn’treally like leaving such dangerous webs cast all about the place, in addition tothe often dangerous shields already guarding the Keep, but he dared not relaxhis guard.As he passed a long side table in a towering gathering hall, Zedd, as he haddone since he was a boy, ran his finger along the smooth groove in the edge ofthe variegated chocolate-brown marble top. He stopped, frowning down at thetable, and realized that it contained something he suddenly felt the want of: aball of fine black cord left there years ago to tie ribbons and otherdecorations on the lamp brackets in the gathering hall to mark the harvestfestival.Sure enough, in the center drawer, he found the ball of fine cord. He snatchedit up and slipped it into a pocket long emptied of its load of berries. From thewall bracket beside the table, he lifted a wand with six small bells. The wand,one of hundreds if not thousands throughout the Keep, was once used to summonservants. He sighed inwardly. It had been decades since servants and theirfamilies last lived in the Wizard’s Keep. He remembered their children runningand playing in the halls. He remembered the joy of laughter echoing throughoutthe Keep, bringing life to the place.Zedd told himself that one day children would again run and laugh in the halls.Richard and Kahlan’s children. Zedd’s broad smile stretched his cheeks.There were windows and openings in the stone that let light spill into manyhalls and rooms, but there were other places less well lit. Zedd found one ofthose darker places that was dim enough to satisfy him. He stretched a piece ofthe black cord, strung with one of the bells, across the doorway, winding itaround coarse stone molding to each side. Moving deeper through the labyrinth ofhalls and passage-ways, he stopped and strung more strings with a bell at placeswhere it would be hard to see. He had to collect several more of the servantwands for a supply of bells.Although there were shields of magic laced everywhere, there was no telling whatpowers some of the Sisters of the Dark possessed. They would be looking formagic, not bells. It couldn’t hurt to take the extra precaution.Zedd made mental notes of where he strung the fine black cord—he would have tolet Adie know. He doubted, though, that with her gifted sight she would need thewarning. He was sure that with her blind eyes she could see better than anyone.Following the wonderful aroma of ham stew, Zedd made his way to the comfortableroom lined with bookshelves they used most of the time. Adie had hung spices todry from the low beams carved with ancient designs. A leather couch sat before abroad fireplace and comfortable chairs beside a silver-inlaid table placed infront of a diamond-patterned leaded window with a breathtaking view overlookingAydindril.The sun was setting, leaving the city below bathed in a warm light. It almostlooked like it always did, except there was no telltale smoke curling up fromcooking fires.Zedd set his burlap sack loaded with his harvest on piles of books atop a roundmahogany table behind the couch. He shuffled closer to the fire, all the whiletaking deep breaths to inhale the intoxicating aroma of the stew.“Adie,” he called, “this smells delightful! Have you looked outside today? I sawthe oddest birds.”He smiled as he inhaled another whiff.“Adie—I think it must be done by now,” he called toward the doorway to the sidepantry room. “I think we ought to taste it, at least. Can’t hurt to check, youknow.”Zedd glanced back over his shoulder. “Adie? Are you listening to me?”He went to the doorway and peered into the pantry, but it was empty.“Adie?” he called down the stairs at the back of the pantry. “Are you downthere?”Zedd’s mouth twisted with discontentment when she didn’t answer.“Adie?” he called again. “Bags, woman, where are you?”He turned back, peering at the stew bubbling in the kettle hung on the craneover the fire. Zedd scooped up a long wooden spoon from a pantry cupboard.Spoon in hand, he stopped and leaned back toward the stairs. “Take your time,Adie. I’ll just be up here ... reading.”Zedd grinned and hurried for the stew."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13Richard rose up in a rush when he saw Cara marching up a ravine toward camp,pushing ahead of her a man Richard vaguely recognized. In the failing light, hecouldn’t make out the man’s face. Richard scanned the surrounding flat washes,rocky hills, and steep tree-covered slopes beyond, but didn’t see anyone else.Friedrich was off to the south and Tom to the west, checking the surroundingcountry, as Cara had been, to be sure there was no one about and that it was asafe place to spend the night; they were exhausted from picking a sinuous routethrough the increasingly rugged country. Cara had been checking north—thedirection they were headed and the direction Richard considered potentially themost dangerous. Jennsen turned from the animals, waiting to see who theMord-Sith had with her.Once on his feet, Richard wished he hadn’t gotten up quite so quickly—doing somade him light-headed. He couldn’t seem to shake the odd, disconnected sensationhe felt, as if he were watching someone else react, talk, move. When heconcentrated, forcing himself to focus his attention, the feeling wouldsometimes drift at least partly away and he would begin to wonder if it was onlyhis imagination.Kahlan’s hand slipped up on his arm, gripping him as if she thought he mightfall.“Are you all right?” she whispered.He nodded as he watched Cara and the man as he also kept an eye on thesurrounding countryside. By the end of their ride earlier that afternoon todiscuss the book, Kahlan had become even more worried about him. They were bothtroubled about what he’d read, but Kahlan was far more concerned, at the moment,anyway, about him.Richard suspected that he might be coming down with a slight fever. That wouldexplain why he was feeling so cold when everyone else was hot. From time totime, Kahlan would feel his forehead or place the back of her hand against hischeek. Her touch warmed his heart; she ignored his smiles as she fretted overhim. She thought that he might be slightly feverish. Once she had Jennsen feelhis forehead to see if she thought he might be warmer than he should be.Jennsen, too, thought that, if he did have a fever, it was minor. Cara, so far,had been satisfied by Kahlan’s report that he didn’t feel feverish, and hadn’tdeemed it necessary to see for herself.A fever was just about the last thing Richard needed. There were important...important, something. He couldn’t seem to recall at the moment. He concentratedon trying to remember the young man’s name, or at least where he’d seen himbefore.The last rays of the setting sun cast a pink glow across the mountains to theeast. The closer hills were dimming to a soft gray in the gathering dusk. Asdarkness approached, the low fire was beginning to tint everything close aroundit a warm yellow-orange. Richard had kept the cook fire small, not wanting it tosignal their location any more than necessary.“Lord Rahl,” the man said in a reverent tone as he stepped into camp. He dippedhis head forward in a hesitant bow, apparently not sure if it was proper to bowor not. “It’s an honor to see you again.”He was perhaps a couple of years younger than Richard, with curly black hairthat brushed the broad shoulders of his buckskin tunic. He wore a long knife athis belt but no sword. His ears stuck out to the sides of his head as if he werestraining to listen to every little sound. Richard imagined that as a boy he’dprobably endured a lot of taunts about his ears, but now that he was a man hisears made him look rather intent and serious. As muscular as the man was,Richard doubted that he still had to contend with taunts.“I’m ... I’m sorry, but I can’t quite seem to recall...”“Oh, no, you wouldn’t remember me, Lord Rahl. I was only—”“Sabar,” Richard said as it came to him. “Sabar. You loaded the furnaces inPriska’s foundry, back in Altur’Rang.”Sabar beamed. “That’s right. I can’t believe you remember me.”Sabar had been one of the men at the foundry able to have work because of thesupplies Richard hauled to Priska when no one else could. Sabar had understoodhow hard Priska worked just to keep his foundry alive under the oppressive,endless, and contradictory mandates of the Order. Sabar had been there the daythe statue Richard carved had been unveiled; he had seen it before it wasdestroyed. He had been there at the beginning of the revolution in Altur’Rang,fighting close alongside Victor, Priska, and all the others who had seized themoment when it was upon them. Sabar had fought to help gain freedom for himself,his friends, and for his city.That had been a day everything had changed.Even though this man, like many others, had been a subject of the ImperialOrder—one of the enemy—he wanted to live his own life under just laws, ratherthan under the dictates of despots who extinguished any hope of betteringoneself under the crushing burden of the cruel illusion of a greater good.Richard noticed, then, that everyone was standing in tense anticipation, as ifthey had expected this to be trouble.Richard smiled at Cara. “It’s all right. I know him.”“So he told me,” Cara said. She put a hand on Sabar’s shoulder and pushed himdown. “Have a seat.”“Yes,” Richard said, glad to see that Cara had been fairly amiable about it.“Sit down and tell us why you’re here.”“Nicci sent me.”Richard rose again in a rush, Kahlan coming up right beside him. “Nicci? We’reon our way to meet her.”Sabar nodded, rising into a half crouch, seeming not to be sure if he wassupposed to stand, since Richard and Kahlan had, or stay seated.Cara hadn’t sat down; she stood behind Sabar like an executioner. Cara had beenthere when the revolution in Altur’Rang had started and might remember Sabar,but that would make no difference. Cara trusted no one where the safety ofRichard and Kahlan was concerned.Richard gestured for Sabar to remain seated. “Where is she,” Richard asked as heand Kahlan sat down again, sharing a seat on a bedroll. “Is she coming soon?”“Nicci said to tell you that she waited as long as she could, but there havebeen some urgent developments and she could wait no longer.”Richard let out a disappointed sigh. “Some things came up for us, too.” Kahlanhad been captured and taken to the Pillars of Creation as bait to lure Richardinto a trap. Rather than go into all that, he kept the story short and to thepoint. “We were trying to get to Nicci, but needed to go elsewhere. It wasunavoidable.”Sabar nodded. “I was worried when she returned to us and said that you had notshown up at your meeting place, but she told us that she was sure you were busytaking care of something important and that was the reason you had not come.“Victor Cascella, the blacksmith, was very worried, too, when Nicci told usthis. He was thinking you would be returning with Nicci. He said that otherplaces he knows, places he and Priska have dealings with for supplies and such,are on the verge of revolt. These people have heard about Altur’Rang, how theOrder has been overthrown there, and how people are beginning to prosper. Hesaid that he knows free men in these places who struggle to survive under theoppression of the Order as we once did, and they hunger to be free. They wantVictor’s help.“Some of the Brothers in the Fellowship of Order who escaped from Altur’Ranghave gone to these other places to insure that such revolt does not spreadthere. Their cruelty in punishing any they suspect of insurrection is costingthe lives of many people, both the innocent and those valuable to the cause ofoverthrowing the Imperial Order.“In order to insure their control of the gears of governance and to ready theOrder’s defense against the spread of the revolt, Brothers of the Order havegone to all the important cities, Surely, some of these priests have also goneto report to Jagang the fall of Altur’Rang, of the loss of so many officials inthe fighting there, and of the deaths of Brothers Narev and many of his closecircle of disciples.”“Jagang already knows of the death of Brother Narev,” Jennsen said, offering hima cup of water.Sabar smiled his satisfaction at her news. He thanked her for the water, thenleaned forward toward Richard and Kahlan as he went on with his story.“Priska thinks the Order will want to sweep away the success of the revolt inAltur’Rang—that they can’t afford to let it stand. He said that instead ofworrying about spreading the revolt, we must prepare, make defenses, and haveevery man stand ready because the Order will return with the intent ofslaughtering every last person in Altur’Rang.”Sabar hesitated, clearly worried about Priska’s warning. “Victor, though, saidwe should hammer the iron while it is hot and create a just and secure futurefor ourselves, rather than wait for the Order to gather their strength to denyus that future. He says that if the revolt is spreading everywhere, the Orderwill not so easily stamp it out.”Richard ran a weary hand across his face. “Victor is right. If those inAltur’Rang try to sit alone as a singular place of freedom in the heart ofhostile enemy territory, the Order will sweep in and cut out that heart. TheOrder can’t survive on its perverted ideals and they know it; that’s why theymust use force to sustain their beliefs. Without that bully of force, the Orderwill crumble.“Jagang spent twenty years creating a system of roads to knit a diverse andfractured Old World together into the Imperial Order. That was but part of themeans of how he succeeded. Many resisted the rantings of his priests. With roadsto swiftly respond to any dissent, though, Jagang was able to react quickly, tosweep in and kill those who openly opposed his new Order.“More importantly, after eliminating those who resisted the Order’s teachings,he filled the minds of children, who didn’t know any better, with blind faith inthose teachings, turning them into zealots eager to die for what they weretaught was a noble cause—sacrifice to some all-consuming greater good.“Those young men, their minds twisted with the teachings of the Order, are nowoff to the north conquering the New World, butchering any who will not take uptheir altruistic tenets.“But while Jagang and that vast army are to the north, that strength thereleaves the Order weak here. That weakness is our opportunity and we mustcapitalize on it. Now, while Jagang and his men are absent, those same roads hebuilt down here will be our means of rapidly spreading the struggle for freedomfar and wide.“The torch of freedom has been lit by the will of those like you, those inAltur’Rang who seized liberty for themselves. The flames of that torch must beheld high, giving others the chance to see its light. If hidden and insulated,such flames will be extinguished by the Order. There may never be another chancein our lifetimes, or our children’s lifetimes, to seize control of our ownlives. That torch must be carried to other places.”Sabar smiled, filled with quiet pride that he had been a part of it all comingto be. “I know that Victor would like for others, like Priska, to be reminded ofsuch things, of what the Lord Rahl would say about what we must do. Victor wantsto talk to you before he goes to these places to ‘pump the bellows,’ as he putit. Victor said that he awaits your word on how you would move next, on how bestto ‘put the white-hot iron to them’—again, his words.”“So Nicci sent you to find me.”“Yes. I was happy to go to you when she asked me. Victor will be happy, too, notonly that you are well but to hear what the Lord Rahl would say to him.”While Victor was awaiting word, Richard also knew that absent such word, Victorwould act. The revolution did not revolve around Richard—it couldn’t to besuccessful—but around the hunger of people to have their lives back. Still,Richard needed to help coordinate the spreading revolt in order to be sure itwas as effective as possible, not just at bringing freedom to those who soughtit, but at crumbling the foundation of the Order in the Old World. Only if theywere successful in toppling the rule of the Order in the Old World wouldJagang’s attention—and many of his men—be pulled away from conquering the NewWorld.Jagang intended to conquer the New World by first dividing it. Richard had to dothe same if he was to succeed. Only dividing the Order’s forces could defeat it.Richard knew that with everyone evacuated from Aydindril, the Imperial Orderwould now turn its swords on D’Hara. Despite the competence of the D’Harantroops, they would be overwhelmed by the numbers that Jagang would throw atthem. If the Order was not diverted from its cause, or at least divided intosmaller forces, D’Hara would fall under the shadow of the Order. The D’HaranEmpire, forged to unite the New World against tyranny, would end before it hadreally gotten started.Richard had to get back to Victor and Nicci so that they could all continue whatthey had begun—devising the most effective strategy to overthrow the ImperialOrder.But they were running out of time to resolve another problem, a problem theydidn’t yet understand.“I’m glad you found us, Sabar. You can tell Victor and Nicci that we need to seeto something first, but as soon as we do, we’ll be able to help them with theirplans.”Sabar looked relieved. “Everyone will be happy to hear this.”Sabar hesitated, then tilted his head, gesturing north. “Lord Rahl, when I cameto find you, following the directions Nicci gave me, I went past the area whereshe was to meet with you, and then I continued coming south.” Worry stole intohis expression. “Not many days ago, I came to a place, miles wide, that wasdead.”Richard looked up. He realized that his headache seemed to be suddenly gone.“What do you mean, dead?”Sabar waved his hand out toward the evening gloom. “The area where I wastraveling was much like this place; there were some trees, clumps of grass,thickets of brush.” His voice lowered. “But then I came to a place whereeverything that grew ended. All at the same place. There was nothing but rockbeyond. Nicci had not told me that I would come to such a place. I admit, I wasafraid.”Richard glanced to his right—to the east—to the mountains that lay beyond. “Howlong did this dead place last?”“I walked, leaving life behind, and I thought I might be walking into theunderworld itself.” Sabar looked away from Richard’s eyes. “Or into the jaws ofsome new weapon the Order had created to destroy us all.“I came to be very afraid and I was going to turn back. But then I thought abouthow the Order made me afraid my whole life, and I didn’t like that feeling.Worse, I thought about how I would stand before Nicci and tell her I turnedaround rather than go to Lord Rahl as she asked of me, and that thought made meashamed, so I went on. In several miles I came again to growing things.” He letout a breath. “I was greatly relieved, and then I felt a little foolish that Ihad been afraid.”Two. That now made two of the strange boundaries.“I’ve been to places like that, Sabar, and I can tell you that I, too, have beenafraid.”Sabar broke into a grin. “Then I was not so foolish to be afraid.”“Not foolish at all. Could you tell if this dead area was extensive? Could youtell if it was more than just a patch of open rock in that one place? Could yousee if it ran in a line, ran in any direction in particular?”“It was like you say, like a line.” Sabar flicked his hand toward the east. “Itcame down out of the far mountains, north of that depression.” He held his handflat like a cleaver, and sliced it downward in the other direction. “It ran offto the southwest, into that wasteland.”Toward the Pillars of Creation.Kahlan leaned close and spoke under her breath. “That would be almost parallelto the boundary we crossed not far back to the south. Why would there be twoboundaries so close together? That makes no sense.”“I don’t know,” Richard whispered to her. “Maybe whatever the boundary wasprotecting was so dangerous that whoever placed it feared that one might not beenough.”Kahlan rubbed her upper arms but didn’t comment. By the look on her face,Richard knew how she felt about such a notion—especially considering that thoseboundaries were now down.“Anyway,” Sabar said with a self-conscious shrug, “I was happy I did not turnback, or I would have had to face Nicci after she had asked me to help LordRahl—my friend Richard.”Richard smiled. “I’m glad, too, Sabar. I don’t think that place you went throughis a danger any longer, at least not a danger the way it was once.”Jennsen could contain her curiosity no longer. “Who is this Nicci?”“Nicci is a sorceress,” Richard said. “She used to be a Sister of the Dark.”Jennsen’s eyebrows went up. “Used to?”Richard nodded. “She worked to further Jagang’s cause, but she finally came tosee how wrong she had been and joined our side.” It was a story he didn’t reallyfeel like going into. “She now fights for us. Her help has been invaluable.”Jennsen leaned in, even more astonished. “But can you trust someone like that,someone who had labored on behalf of Jagang? Worse, a Sister of the Dark?Richard, I’ve been with some of those women, I know how ruthless they are. Theymay have to do as Jagang makes them, but they’re devoted to the Keeper of theunderworld. Do you really think you can trust with your life that she will notbetray you?”Richard looked Jennsen in the eye. “I trust you with a knife while I sleep.”Jennsen sat back up. She smiled, more out of embarrassment than anything else,Richard thought. “I guess I see your point.”“What else did Nicci say,” Kahlan asked, keen to get back to the matter at hand.“Only that I must go in her place and meet you,” Sabar said.Richard knew that Nicci was being cautious. She didn’t want to tell the youngman too much in case he was caught.“How did she know where I was?”“She said that she was able to tell where you were by magic. Nicci is aspowerful with magic as she is beautiful.”Sabar said this in a tone of awe. He didn’t know the half of it. Nicci was oneof the most powerful sorceresses ever to have lived. Sabar didn’t know that whenNicci was laboring toward the ends sought by the Order, she was known as Death’sMistress.Richard surmised that Nicci had somehow used the bond to the Lord Rahl to findhim. That bond was loyalty sworn in the heart, not by rote, and its powerprotected those so sworn from the dream walker entering their minds.Full-blooded D’Harans, like Cara, could tell through the bond where the LordRahl was. Kahlan had confided to him that she found it unnerving the way Caraalways knew where Richard was. Nicci wasn’t D’Haran, but she was a sorceress andshe was bonded to Richard, so she might have been able to manipulate that bondto tell where he was.“Sabar, Nicci must have sent you to us for a reason,” Richard said, “other thanto say that she couldn’t wait for us at our meeting place.”“Yes, of course,” Sabar said as he nodded hastily, as if chagrined to have to bereminded. “When I asked her what I was to say to you, she told me that she hadput it all in a letter.” Sabar opened the leather flap of the pouch at his belt.“She said that when she realized how far away you really were, she wasdistraught and couldn’t take the time to journey to you. She told me that it wasimportant for me to be sure I found you and gave you her letter. She said theletter would explain why she could not wait.”With one finger and a thumb, Sabar lifted out the letter, looking as if he werehandling a deadly viper instead of a small roll sealed with red wax.“Nicci told me that this is dangerous,” he explained, looking up into Richard’seyes. “She said that if anyone but you opened it, I should not be standing tooclose or I would die with them.”Sabar carefully laid the rolled letter on Richard’s palm. It warmed appreciablyin his hand. The red wax brightened, as if lit by a ray of sunlight even thoughit was getting dark. The glow spread from the wax to envelop the whole length ofthe rolled letter. Fine cracks raced all across the red wax, like autumn ice ona pond breaking up under the weight of a foot placed on it. The wax suddenlyshattered and crumbled away.Sabar swallowed. “I hate to think of what would have happened had anyone but youtried to open it.”Jennsen leaned in again. “Was that magic?”“Must have been,” Richard told her as he started to unroll the letter.“But I saw it fall apart,” she said in a confidential tone.“Did you see anything else?”“No, it just all of a sudden crumbled.”With a thumb and finger, Richard lifted some of the disintegrated wax from hispalm. “She probably put a web of magic around the letter and keyed that spell tomy touch. If anyone else had tried to break that web to open the letter it wouldhave ignited the spell. I guess that my touch unlocked the seal. You saw theresult of the magic—the broken seal—not the magic itself.”“Oh, wait!” Sabar smacked his forehead with the flat of his palm. “What am Ithinking? I’m supposed to give you this, too.”Shrugging the straps off his shoulders and down his arms, he pulled his packaround onto his lap. He quickly undid the leather thongs and reached inside,then carefully lifted out something wrapped in black quilted material. It wasonly about a foot tall but not very big around. By the way Sabar handled it, itappeared to be somewhat heavy.Sabar set the wrapped object on the ground, upright, in front of the fire.“Nicci told me that I should give this to you, that the letter would explainit.”Jennsen leaned in a little, fascinated by the mystery of the tightly wrappedobject. “What is it?”Sabar shrugged. “Nicci didn’t tell me.” He made a face that suggested he wassomewhat uncomfortable with the way he was in the dark about much of the missionhe’d been sent on. “When Nicci looks at you and tells you to do something, itgoes out of your head to ask questions.”Richard smiled to himself as he began to unroll the letter. He knew all too wellwhat Sabar meant.“Did Nicci say anything about who could unwrap that thing?”“No, Lord Rahl. She just said to give it to you, that the letter would explainit.”“If it had a web around it, like the letter, she would have warned you.” Richardlooked up. “Cara,” he said, gesturing at the bundled package sitting before thefire, “why don’t you unwrap it while Kahlan and I read the letter.”As Cara sat cross-legged on the ground and started working on the knots in theleather thongs around the black quilted wrap, Richard held the letter sideways abit so that Kahlan could read it silently along with him.Dear Richard and Kahlan,I am sorry that I cannot tell you everything right now that I would have youknow, but there are urgent matters I must see to and I dare not delay. Jaganghas initiated something I considered impossible. Through his ability as a dreamwalker, he has forced Sisters of the Dark he controls to attempt to createweapons out of people, as was done during the great war. This is dangerousenough in itself, but because Jagang does not have the gift, his understandingof such things is very crude. He is a blundering bull trying to use his horns toknit lace. They are using the lives of wizards as the fodder for hisexperiments. I don’t yet know the exact extent of their success, but I fear todiscover the results. More of this in a moment.First, the object I sent. When I picked up your trail and began tracking it towhere we were to meet, I discovered this. I believe you have already come acrossit because it has been touched by a principal involved in the matter or involvedwith you.The object is a warning beacon. It has been activated—not by this touch, but byevents. I cannot overstate the danger it represents.Such objects could only be made by the wizards of ancient times; the creation ofsuch an object required both Additive and Subtractive Magic, and required thegift of both to be innate. Even then, they are so rare that I have neveractually seen one.I have, however, read about them down in the vaults at the Palace of theProphets. Such warning beacons are kept viable by a link to the dead wizard whocreated them.Richard sat back and let out a troubled breath. “How can such a link bepossible?” Kahlan asked.He hardly had to read between the lines to be able to tell that Nicci waswarning him in the gravest possible terms.“It has to be linked somehow to the underworld,” Richard whispered back.Little points of firelight danced in her green eyes as she stared at him.Kahlan glanced again at Cara as she worked at the knots, pulling off one of theleather thongs around an object linked to a dead wizard in the underworld.Kahlan held up the edge of the letter as she urgently read along with him.From what I know of such warning beacons, they monitor powerful and vitalprotective shields created to seal away something profoundly dangerous. They arepaired. The first beacon is always amber. It is meant to be a warning to the onewho caused the breach of the seal. The touch of a principal or one involved witha principal kindles it so it may be recognized for what it is and serve as itwas intended—as a warning to those involved. Only after alerting the one it ismeant to warn can it be destroyed. I send it to be absolutely certain you haveseen it.The precise nature of the second beacon is unknown to me, but that beacon ismeant for the one able to replace the seal.I don’t know the nature of the seal or what it was protecting. Without doubt,though, the seal has been breached.The source of the breach, while not the specific cause activating this beacon,is self-evident.“Oh, now wait a minute,” Cara said, standing, backing away as if she hadreleased a deadly plague from the black quilting, “it isn’t my fault this time.”She pointed down at it. “You told me to, this time.”The translucent statue Cara had touched before now stood in the center of itsunfolded black quilted wrapping.It was the same statue: a statue of Kahlan.The statue’s left arm was pressed to its side, the right arm was raised,pointing. The statue, in an hourglass shape, looked as if it were made oftransparent amber, allowing them to see inside.Sand trickled out of the top half of the hourglass, through the narrowed waist,into the bottom of the full dress of the Mother Confessor.The sand was still trickling down, just as it had been the last time Richard hadseen the thing. At that time, the top half had been more full than the bottomhalf. Now, the top held less sand than the bottom.Kahlan’s face had gone ashen.When he’d first seen it, Richard wouldn’t have needed Nicci to tell him howdangerous such a thing was. He hadn’t wanted any of them to touch it. When theyhad first come across it, in a recess of rock beside the trail, looking almostlike part of the rock itself, the thing was opaque, with a dull, dark surface,yet it was clearly recognizable as Kahlan. It was lying on its side.Cara wasn’t pleased to find such a thing and didn’t want to leave arepresentation of Kahlan lying about for anyone to find and to pick up forwho-knew-what. Cara snatched it up, then, even though Richard started to yell ather to leave such a thing be.When she picked it up, it started turning translucent.In a panic, Cara set it back down.That was when the right arm had lifted and pointed east.That was when they could begin to see through the thing, to see the sand insidetrickling down.The implied danger of the sand running out had them all upset. Cara wanted topick it up again and turn it over, to stop the sand from falling. Richard, notknowing anything about such an object and doubting that so simple a solutionwould have any beneficial effect, hadn’t allowed Cara to touch it again. He hadpiled rocks and brush around it so no one else would know it was there.Obviously, that hadn’t worked.He knew now that Cara’s touch had nothing to do with what was happening, exceptto initiate the warning, so he thought to confirm his original belief. “Cara,put it down.”“Down?”“On its side—like you wanted to do the last time—to see if that will stop thesand.”Cara stared at him for a moment and then used the toe of her boot to tip thefigure over on its side.The sand continued to run as if it still stood upright.“How can the sand do that?” Jennsen asked, sounding quite shaken. “How can thesand still fall—how can it fall sideways?”“You can see it?” Kahlan asked. “You can see the sand falling?”Jennsen nodded. “I sure can, and I have to tell you, it’s giving my goose bumpsgoose bumps.”Richard could only stare at her staring at the statue of Kahlan lying on itsside. If nothing else, the sand running sideways through the statue had to bemagic. Jennsen was a pillar of Creation, a hole in the world, a pristinelyungifted offspring of Darken Rahl. She should not be able to see magic.And yet, she was seeing it.“I have to agree with the young lady,” Sabar said. “That’s even more frighteningthan those big black birds that I’ve seen circling for the last week.”Kahlan straightened. “You been seeing—”When he heard Tom’s urgent warning yell, Richard rose up in a rush, drawing hissword in one swift movement. The unique sound of ringing steel filled the nightair.The magic did not come out with the sword."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14Kahlan ducked to the side, out of harm’s way, as Richard pulled his sword free.The distinctive ring of steel being drawn in anger fused with Tom’s warning yellstill echoing through the surrounding hills to send a flash of fright tinglingacross her flesh. As she stared out into the empty blackness of the surroundingnight, her instinct was to reach for her own sword, but she had packed it in thewagon rather than wear it, so as not to raise suspicions about who they mightbe—women in the Old World did not carry weapons.By the light of the fire, Kahlan could clearly see Richard’s face. She had seenhim draw the Sword of Truth countless times and in a variety of situations, fromthat very first time when Zedd, after giving him the sword, commanded him todraw it and Richard tentatively pulled it from its scabbard, to times he pulledit free in the heat of battle, to times like this when he drew it suddenly indefense.When Richard drew the sword, he was also drawing its attendant magic. That wasthe function of the weapon; the magic had not been created simply to defend thesword’s true owner, but, more importantly, to be a projection of his intent. TheSword of Truth was not even really a talisman, but rather a tool, of the Seekerof Truth.The true weapon was the rightly named Seeker who wielded the sword. The sword’smagic answered to him.Each and every one of the times Richard had drawn the sword, Kahlan had seenthat magic dancing dangerously in his gray eyes.This was the first time he had drawn the sword that she didn’t see the magic inhis eyes; the raptor’s glare was pure Richard.While seeing him draw the sword without seeing its concomitant magic evident inhis eyes shocked her, it seemed to surprise Richard even more. For an instant hehesitated, as if mentally stumbling.Before they had time to even wonder what had prompted Tom’s warning yell,shadowy shapes slipping through the cover of the nearby trees suddenly stormedout of the darkness and into their midst. The sudden sound and fury ofbloodcurdling cries filled the night air as men rampaged into the camp, lit atlast by firelight.They didn’t appear to be soldiers—they weren’t wearing uniforms—and they weren’tattacking as soldiers would, with weapons drawn. Kahlan didn’t see any of themen brandishing swords or axes or even knives.Weapons or not, there were a lot of men and they yelled fierce battle cries asif they intended nothing short of bloody murder. She knew, though, that thesudden shock of deafening noise was a tactic designed to render the intendedtarget powerless with fright, making them easier to cut down. She knew becauseshe used such tactics herself.Blade in hand, Richard was fully in his element; focused, resolute, ruthlesslycommitted—even without his sword’s attendant magic.As assailants charged in, the sword, driven by Richard’s own wrath, flashedthrough the air, a flash of crimson light from the fire’s flames reflected alongthe blade’s length, lending it a fleeting stain of red. In that charged momentof attack met, there was a split second when Kahlan feared that without thesword’s magic, it all might go terribly wrong.In an instant, the camp that had been so quietly tense became pandemonium.Although the attackers weren’t dressed like soldiers, they were all big and asthey swept in there was no doubt whatsoever as to their hostile intent.A man rushing onward threw his arms up to seize Richard before his sword couldbe brought to bear. The sword’s tip whistled as it came around, driven by deadlycommitment. The blade severed one of the man’s raised arms before explodingthrough his skull. The air above the fire filled with a spray of blood, bone,and brain. Another man lunged. Richard’s sword ripped through his chest. In thespace of two blinks, two men were dead.The magic at last seemed to slam into Richard’s eyes, as if finally catching upwith his intent.Kahlan couldn’t make sense of what the men were doing. They attacked withoutweapons drawn, but they seemed no less fierce for it. Their speed, numbers, andsize, and the angry look of them, were enough to make most anyone tremble infright.From the darkness, more men rushed in on them. Cara stepped into the path of theattack, lashing out with her Agiel. Men cried out in horrifying pain when herweapon made contact, causing hesitation among the attackers. Sabar, knife tohand, tumbled to the ground with one of the men who had seized him from behind.Jennsen ducked away from another man snatching for her hair. As she spun awayfrom him, she slashed his face with her knife. His cries joined a stridentchorus of others.Kahlan realized that it wasn’t just men yelling, but the horses were alsoscreaming in fright. Cara’s Agiel against a bull neck brought a terrifyingshriek. Men yelled with effort and shouted orders that were cut off abruptly asRichard’s sword tore through them. All the yelling seemed directed at the taskof overwhelming the four of them.Kahlan understood, then, what was going on. This was not an attempt to kill, butto capture. For these men, killing would be a great mercy compared to what theyintended.Two of the burly men dove across the fire, arms spread wide as if to tackleRichard and Kahlan. Cara reached out and seized a fistful of shirt, abruptlyspinning one of the two around. She drove her Agiel into his gut, dropping himto his knees. The other man unexpectedly encountered Richard’s sword thruststraight in with formidable muscle driving it. The scream of mortal pain wasbrief before the sword slashed his throat. Cara, standing above the man on hisknees, pressed her Agiel to his chest and gave it a twist that dropped himinstantly.Already, Richard was leaping over the fire to penetrate into the brunt of theattack. As his boots landed with a thud, his sword cut the man atop Sabar nearlyin two, spilling his viscera across the ground.The man Jennsen had slashed rose up only to be met by her knife driven bydesperate fright. She jumped back as he tumbled forward, clutching the base ofhis throat where she had severed his windpipe. Cara snagged the man Jennsendidn’t see going for her back. The Mord-Sith, her face a picture of savageresolve, held her Agiel to his throat, following him to the ground as he chokedon his own blood.Then, among the men Richard ripped into, Kahlan saw the knives coming out. Themen abandoned their failed attempt to bring him down by grabbing andoverpowering him, and decided, instead, to knife him. If anything, the threat ofthe knives served only to further unleash Richard’s fury. By the look in hiseyes, the sword’s magic seemed to be fully engaged in the battle.For an instant, Kahlan stood transfixed by the sight of Richard so ruthlesslycommitted to self-defense that the act of killing became a gracefulmanifestation of art—a dance with death. Compared with Richard’s fluidmovements, the men blundered like bulls. Without wasted motion, Richard slippedamong them as if they were statues, his sword delivering unrestrained violence.Each thrust met a vital area of the enemy. Each swing sliced through flesh andbone. Each turn met an attack and crushed it. There was no lost opportunity, noslash that missed, no thrust gone wide, no bobble that only slightly wounded.Each time he spun past the thrust of a blade, met a rush, or turned to a newattack, he cut without mercy.Kahlan was furious that she didn’t have her sword. There was no telling how manymore men there were. She knew all too well what it was like to be helpless andoverwhelmed by a gang of men. She started edging toward the wagon.Jennsen and Sabar were both tackled by a burly man diving in out of thedarkness. As they hit the ground, the man landed atop them, knocking the windfrom them. His big hands pinned their wrists to the ground, keeping their knivesat bay.Richard’s blade swept past with lightning speed, slicing across the man’s back,severing his spine. Richard went to a knee as he turned, whipping the swordaround to impale another attacker rushing in at a dead run, trying to get toRichard before he could recover. The look on the man’s face was a picture ofhorrified surprise as he ran instead onto Richard’s sword, running it into hisown chest up to the hilt. The heavy man atop Jennsen and Sabar convulsed, unableto draw a breath, as they threw him off. Richard, still on one knee, yanked thesword free as the mortally wounded man fell past him.As another man rushed into camp, looking around, trying to get his bearings,Cara slammed her Agiel against his neck. As he crumbled, she drove her elbow upto smash the face of a man following the first in, trying to grab her frombehind while she was occupied. Crying out, his hands covered crushed bone andgushing blood. She spun and kicked him between the legs. As he fell forward, hishands going to his groin, she broke his jaw with her knee, turned, and dropped athird man by slamming her Agiel to his chest.Another attacker threw himself at Sabar, knocking him back. Sabar lashed outwith his knife, making solid contact. Another man saw the opening and snatchedup Nicci’s letter lying on the ground. Kahlan dove for the letter in his fist,but missed as he yanked his hand back before dashing away. Jennsen blocked hisescape. He straight-armed her as he charged past. Jennsen was knocked reeling,but came around to bury her knife between his shoulder blades.Jennsen managed to keep hold of her knife, twisting it forcefully, as the manarched his back with a gasp of pain and then a bellow of anger that withered toa wet burble before it was fully out of his lungs. Jennsen’s knife had found hisheart. He staggered, stumbled, and fell onto the fire. The flames whooshed tolife as his clothing ignited. Kahlan tried to snatch the letter from his fist ashe writhed in horrifying pain, but, with the intensity of the heat, she couldn’tget close enough.It was already too late, though; the letter she and Richard had only had achance to partially read flared briefly before transforming to black ash thatdisintegrated and lifted skyward in the roar of flames.Kahlan covered her mouth and nose, gagging on the stench of burning hair andflesh as she was driven back by the heat. Though it seemed like hours offighting, the assault had only just begun and already men lay dead everywhere asyet more of the big men joined the attack.As she recoiled from the flames and her futile attempt to recover the lostletter, Kahlan turned again toward the wagon, toward her sword.She looked up and saw a man who seemed as big as a mountain charging right ather, blocking her way. He grinned at seeing that he had run down a woman withouta weapon.Beyond the man, Kahlan saw Richard. Their eyes met. He had taken his sword tothe bulk of the attack, trying to cut it down before it could get to the rest ofthem, trying to end it before harm could get to any of the rest of them.He couldn’t be everywhere at once.He wasn’t close enough to get to her in time. That didn’t stop him from trying.Even as he did, Kahlan discounted the attempt. He was too far away. The effortwas futile.Looking into the eyes of the man she loved more than life itself, she saw hispure rage; she knew that Richard was seeing a face that showed nothing: aConfessor’s face, as her mother had taught her. And then the racing enemy camebetween them, blocking their sight of one another.Kahlan’s vision focused on the man bearing down on her. His arms lifted like abear lost in a mad charge. His teeth were gritted with determination. A grimacetwisted his face in his wild effort to reach her before she could dodge to theside, before she had a chance to escape.She knew he was too close for her to have that chance and so she didn’t wasteany effort in a useless attempt.This one had made it past the killing. He had avoided Jennsen and Sabar. He hadfigured his attack to skirt Richard’s blade while making it past Cara’s Agiel asshe turned to another man. He hadn’t charged in madly like the rest; he haddelayed just enough to time his onslaught perfectly.This one knew he was on the verge of having what he sought.He was far less than a heartbeat away, plunging toward her at full speed.Kahlan could hear Richard’s scream even as her gaze met the gleam of the man’sdark eyes.The man let out a cry of rage as he lunged. His feet left the ground as hesailed through the air toward her. His wicked grin betrayed his confidence.Kahlan could see his eyeteeth hooked over his cracked lower lip, saw the darktooth in the front of the top row between his other yellow teeth, saw the littlewhite hook of a scar, as if he had once been eating with a knife and hadaccidentally sliced the corner of his mouth. His stubble looked like wire. Hisleft eye didn’t open as wide as his right. His right ear had a big V-shapednotch taken out of the upper portion. It reminded her of the way some farmersmarked their swine.She could see her own reflection in his dark eyes as her right arm came up.Kahlan wondered if he had a wife, a woman who cared for him, missed him, pinedfor him. She wondered if he might have children, and, if he did, what a man likethis would teach his children. She had a momentary flash of the ugliness itwould be to have this beast atop her, his wire stubble scraping her cheek raw,his cracked lips on hers, his yellow teeth raking her neck as he lost himself inwhat he wanted.Time twisted.She held out her arm. The man crashed in toward her. She felt the coarse weaveof his dark brown shirt as the flat of her hand met the center of his chest.That heartbeat of time she had before he was atop her had not yet begun. Richardhad not yet managed to take a single frantic step.The weight of the bear of a man against her hand felt as if it were but a baby’sbreath. To Kahlan, it seemed as if he were frozen in space before her.Time was hers.He was hers.The rush of combat, the cries, the yells, the screams; the stink of sweat andblood; the flash of steel, the clash of bodies; the curses and growls; the fear,the terror, the heart-pounding dread... the rage ... was no longer there forher. She was in a silent world all her own.Even though she had been born with it and had always felt it there in the coreof her being, the awesome power within, in many ways, seemed incomprehensible,inconceivable, unimaginable, remote. She knew it would seem that way until shelet her restraint slip, and then she would once again be joined with a force ofsuch breathtaking magnitude that it could only be fully comprehended as it wasbeing experienced. Although she had unleashed it more times than she couldremember, no matter how prepared she was the extraordinary violence of it alwaysstill astonished her.She regarded the man before her with cold calculation, ready for that violence.As he had charged in on her, time had belonged to this man.Now time belonged to her.She could feel the thread count of the fabric of his shirt, feel his woollychest hairs beneath it.The heart-pounding shock of the sudden attack, the violence of it, was gone now.Now there was only this man and her, forever linked by what was to happen. Thisman had consciously chosen his own fate when he chose to attack them. Hercertainty of what was called for carried her beyond the need for the assessmentof emotion, and she felt none—no joy, not even relief; no hate, not evenaversion; no compassion, not even sorrow.Kahlan shed those emotions to make way for the rush of power, to give it freerun.Now he had no chance.He was hers.The man’s face was contorted with the intoxicated, gloating glee of hiscertitude that he was the glorious victor who would have her, that he was nowthe one to decide what was to become of her life, that she was but his toplunder.Kahlan unleashed her power.By her deliberate intent, the subordinate state of her birthright instantlyaltered into overpowering force able to alter the very nature of consciousness.In the man’s dark eyes had come the spark of suspicion that something which hecould not comprehend had irrevocably begun. And then there came the lightningrecognition that his life, as he had known it, was over. Everything he wanted,thought about, worked toward, hoped for, prayed for, possessed, loved, hated ...was ended.In her eyes he saw no mercy, and that, more than anything, brought him starkterror.Thunder without sound jolted the air.In that instant, the violence of it was as pristine, as beautiful, as exquisite,as it was horrific.That heartbeat of time Kahlan had before he was on her had still not yet begun.She could see in the man’s eyes that even thought itself was too late for him,now. Perception itself was being outpaced by the race of brutal magic tearingthrough his mind, destroying forever who this man had been.The force of the concussion jolted the air.The stars shuddered.Sparks from the fire lashed along the ground as the shock spread outward in aring, driving dust before its passing. Trees shook when hit by the blow,shedding needles and leaves as the raging wave swept past.He was hers.His full weight flying forward knocked Kahlan back a step as she twisted out ofthe way. The man flew past her and crashed to the ground, sprawling on his face.Without an instant of hesitation, he scrambled up onto his knees. His hands cameup in prayerful supplication. Tears flooded his eyes. His mouth, which only aninstant before was so warped with perverted expectation, now distorted with theagony of pure anguish.“Please, Mistress,” he wailed, “command me!”Kahlan regarded him, for the first time in his new life, with an emotion:contempt."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15Only the sound of Betty’s soft, frightened bleating drifted out over theotherwise silent campsite. Bodies lay sprawled haphazardly across the ground.The attack appeared to be over. Richard, sword in hand, rushed through thecarnage to get to Kahlan. Jennsen stood near the edge of the fire’s light, whileCara checked the bodies for any sign of life.Kahlan left the man she had just touched with her power kneeling in the dirt,stalking past him toward Jennsen. Richard met her halfway there, his free armsweeping around her with relief.“Are you all right?”Kahlan nodded, quickly appraising their camp, on the lookout for any moreattackers, but saw only the men who were dead.“What about you?” she asked.Richard didn’t seem to hear her question. His arm slipped from her waist. “Dearspirits,” he said, as he rushed to one of the bodies lying on its side.It was Sabar.Jennsen stood not far away, trembling with terror, her knife held up defensivelyin a fist, her eyes wide. Kahlan gathered Jennsen in her arms, whisperingassurance that it was over, that it was ended, that she was all right.Jennsen clutched at Kahlan. “Sabar—he was—protecting me—”“I know, I know,” Kahlan comforted.She could see that there was no urgency in Richard’s movements as he laid Sabaron his back. The young man’s arm flopped lifelessly to the side. Kahlan’s heartsank.Tom ran into camp, gasping for air. He was streaked with blood and sweat.Jennsen wailed and flew into his arms. He embraced her protectively, holding herhead to his shoulder as he tried to regain his breath.Betty bleated in dismay from beneath the wagon, hesitantly emerging only afterJennsen called repeated encouragement to her. The puling goat finally rushed toJennsen and huddled trembling against her skirts. Tom kept a wary watch of thesurrounding darkness.Cara calmly walked among the bodies, surveying them for any sign of life. Withmost, there could be no question. Here and there she nudged one with the toe ofher boot, or with the tip of her Agiel. By her lack of urgency, there was noquestion that they were all dead.Kahlan put a tender hand to Richard’s back as he crouched beside Sabar’s body.“How many people must die,” he asked in a low, bitter voice, “for the crime ofwanting to be free, for the sin of wanting to live their own life?”She saw that he still held the Sword of Truth in a white-knuckled fist. Thesword’s magic, which had come out so reluctantly, still danced dangerously inhis eyes.“How many!” he repeated.“I don’t know, Richard,” Kahlan whispered.Richard turned a glare toward the man across the camp, still on his knees, hishands pressed together in a beseeching gesture begging to be commanded, fearingto speak.Once touched by a Confessor, the person was no longer who they had once been.That part of their mind was forever gone. Who they were, what they were, nolonger existed.In its place the magic of a Confessor’s power placed unqualified devotion to thewants and wishes of the Confessor who had touched them. Nothing else mattered.Their only purpose in life, now, was to fulfill her commands, to do her bidding,to answer her every question.For one thus touched, there was no crime they wouldn’t confess, if she asked itof them. It was for this alone that Confessors had been created. Their purpose,in a way, was the same as the Seeker’s—the truth. In war, as in all otheraspects of life, there was no more important commodity for survival than thetruth.This man, kneeling not far away, cried in abject misery because Kahlan had askednothing of him. There could be no agony more ghastly, no void more terrifying,than to be empty of knowing her wish. Existence without her wish was pointless.In the absence of her command, men touched by a Confessor had been known to die.Anything she now asked of him, whether it be to tell her his name, confess histrue love’s name, or to murder his beloved mother, would bring him boundless joybecause he would finally have a task to carry out for her.“Let’s find out what this is all about,” Richard said in a low growl.In exhaustion, Kahlan stared at the man on his knees. She was so weary she couldhardly stand. Sweat trickled down between her breasts. She needed rest, but thisproblem was more immediate and needed to be attended to first.On their way to the man waiting on his knees, his eyes turned expectantly uptoward Kahlan, Richard halted. There, in the dirt before his boots, was theremains of the statue Sabar had brought to them. It was broken into a hundredpieces, none of them any longer recognizable except that those pieces were stilla translucent amber color.Nicci’s letter had said that they didn’t need the statue, now that it had givenits warning—a warning that Kahlan had somehow broken a protective shield sealingaway something profoundly dangerous.Kahlan didn’t know what the seal protected, but she feared that she knew all toowell what she had done to break it.She feared even more that, because of her, the magic of Richard’s sword hadbegun to falter.As Kahlan stood staring down at the amber fragments ground into the dirt,despair flooded into her.Richard’s arm circled her waist. “Don’t let your imagination get carried away.We don’t know what this is about, yet. We can’t even be certain that it’strue—it could even be some kind of mistake.”Kahlan wished that she could believe that.Richard finally slid his sword back into its scabbard. “Do you want to restfirst, sit a bit?”His concern for her took precedence over everything. From the first day she methim, it always had. Right then, it was his well-being that concerned her.Using her power sapped a Confessor of strength. It had left Kahlan feeling notonly weak, but, this time, nauseated. She had been named to the post of MotherConfessor, in part, because her power was so strong that she was able to recoverit in hours; for others it had taken a day or sometimes two. At the thought ofall those other Confessors, some of whom she’d dearly loved, being long dead,Kahlan felt the weight of hopelessness pulling her even lower.To fully recover her strength, she would need a night’s rest. At the moment,though, there were more important considerations, not the least of which wasRichard.“No,” she said. “I’m all right. I can rest later. Let’s ask him what you will.”Richard’s gaze moved over the campsite littered with limbs, entrails, bodies.The ground was soaked with blood. The stench of it all, along with the stillsmoldering body beside the fire, was making Kahlan sicker by the second. Sheturned away from the man on his knees, toward Richard, into the protection ofhis arms. She was exhausted.“And then let’s get away from this place,” she said. “We need to get away fromhere. There might be more men coming.” Kahlan worried that if he had to draw thesword again, he might not have the help of its magic. “We need to find a moresecure camp.”Richard nodded his agreement. He looked over her head as he held her to hischest. Despite everything, or perhaps because of everything, it felt wonderfulsimply to be held. She could hear Friedrich just rushing back into camp, pantingas he ran. He stumbled to a halt as he let out a moan of astonishment mixed withrevulsion at what he saw.“Tom, Friedrich,” Richard asked, “do you have any idea if there are any more mencoming?”“I don’t think so,” Tom said. “I think they were together. I caught them comingup a gully. I was going to try to make it back here to warn you, but four ofthem came over a rise and jumped me while the rest ran for our camp.”“I didn’t see anyone, Lord Rahl,” Friedrich said, catching his breath. “I camerunning when I heard the yelling.”Richard acknowledged Friedrich’s words with a reassuring hand on the man’sshoulder. “Help Tom get the horses hitched. I don’t want to spend the nighthere.”As the two men sprang into action, Richard turned to Jennsen.“Please lay out some bedrolls in the back of the wagon, will you? I’d likeKahlan to be able to lie down and rest when we move out.”Jennsen patted Betty’s shoulder, urging the goat to follow her. “Of course,Richard.” She hurried off to the wagon, Betty trotting along close at her side.As everyone rushed as quickly as possible to get their things together, Richardwent by himself to an open patch of ground nearby to dig a shallow grave. Therewas no time for a funeral pyre. A lonely grave was the best they could do, butSabar’s spirit was gone, and wouldn’t fault the necessity of their hurried carefor his body.Kahlan reconsidered her thought. After the letter from Nicci and learning themeaning of the warning beacon, she now had even more reason to doubt that manythings, including spirits, were still true. The world of the dead was connectedto the world of the living by links of magic. The veil itself was magic and saidto be within those like Richard. They had learned that without magic those linksthemselves could fail, and that, since those other worlds couldn’t existindependent of the world of life, but only existed in a relational sense to theworld of life, should the links fail completely, those other worlds might verywell cease to exist—much as, without the sun, the concept of daytime would notexist.It was now clear to Kahlan that the world’s hold on magic was slipping, and hadbeen slipping for several years.She knew the reason.Spirits, the good and the bad, and the existence of everything else thatdepended on magic, might soon be lost. That meant that death would become final,in every sense of the word. It could even be that there was no longer thepossibility of being with a loved one after death, or of being with the goodspirits. The good spirits, even the underworld itself, might be passing intonothingness.When Richard was finished, Tom helped him gently place Sabar’s body in theground. After Tom spoke quiet words asking the good spirits to watch over one oftheir own, he and Richard covered the body over.“Lord Rahl,” Tom said in a low voice when they were finished, “while some of themen began the attack on you, here, others slit the horses’ throats beforejoining their fellows to come after you four.”“All the horses?”“Except mine. My draft horses are pretty big. The men were probably worriedabout getting trampled. They left some men to take care of me, so these herethought they had me out of the way. They probably figured they could worry aboutthe draft horses later, after they had the rest of you.” Tom shrugged his broadshoulders. “Maybe they even planned to capture you, tie you up, and take you inthe wagon.”Richard acknowledged Tom’s words with a single nod. He wiped his fingers acrosshis forehead. Kahlan thought he looked worse than she felt. She could see thatthe headache had returned and was crushing him under the weight of its pain.Tom looked around their camp, his gaze playing over the fallen men. “What shouldwe do with the rest of the bodies?”“The races can have the rest of them,” Richard said without hesitation.Tom didn’t look to have any disagreement with that. “I’d better go helpFriedrich finish getting the horses hitched to the wagon. They’ll be a handfulwith the scent of blood in their nostrils and the sight of the others dead.”As Tom went to see to his horses, Richard called to Cara. “Count the bodies,” hetold her. “We need to know the total.”“Richard,” Kahlan asked in a confidential tone after Tom was out of earshot andCara had started stepping over some of the bodies and between others, goingabout the task of taking a count, “what happened when you drew the sword?”He didn’t ask what she meant or try to spare her from worry.“There’s something wrong with its magic. When I drew the sword, it failed toheed my call. The men were rushing in and I couldn’t delay in what I had to do.Once I met the attack, the magic finally reacted.“It’s probably due to the headaches from the gift—they must be interfering withmy ability to join with the sword’s magic.”“The last time you had the headaches they didn’t interfere with the sword’spower.”“I told you, don’t let your imagination get carried away. This has only happenedsince I’ve started getting the headaches again. That has to be the reason.”Kahlan didn’t know if she dared believe him, or if he really even believed ithimself. He was right, though. The problem with the sword’s magic had onlyrecently developed—after he started getting the headaches.“They’re getting worse, aren’t they?”He nodded. “Come on, let’s get what answers we can.”Kahlan let out a tired sigh, resigned to that part of it. They had to use thischance to find out what information was now available to them.Kahlan turned to the man still on his knees."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16The man’s tearful eyes gazed pleadingly up at Kahlan as she stepped in front ofhim. He had been waiting, alone and without her wishes, for quite a while and asa result was in a state of dire misery.“You are to come with us,” Kahlan told him in a cold tone. “You are to walk infront of the wagon for now, where we can keep an eye on you. You will obey theorders of any of the others with me as you would obey my orders. You will answerall questions truthfully.”The man fell to his belly on the ground, in tears, kissing her feet, thankingher profusely for at last commanding him. Groveling on the ground, with thatV-shaped notch in his ear, he reminded her of nothing so much as a swine.Fists at her side, Kahlan screamed “Stop that!” She didn’t want this murderingpig touching her.He sprang back instantly, aghast at the rage in her voice, horror-struck thatshe was displeased with him. He cringed motionless at her feet, his eyes wide,fearful that he would do something else to displease her.“You aren’t in a uniform,” Richard said to the man. “You and the other menaren’t soldiers?”“We’re soldiers, just not regular soldiers,” the man said with eager excitementto be able to answer the question and thus do Kahlan’s bidding. “We’re specialmen serving with the Imperial Order.”“Special? How are you special?”With a hint of uncertainty in his wet eyes, the man looked nervously up atKahlan. She gave him no sign. She had already told him that he was to follow alltheir orders. The man, at last certain of her intention, rushed to go on.“We’re a special unit of men—with the army—our task is to capture enemies of theOrder—we have to pass tests to be sure we’re able men—loyal men—and that we canaccomplish the missions we’re sent on—”“Slow down,” Richard said. “You’re talking too fast.”The man glanced quickly at Kahlan, his eyes filling with tears that he mighthave displeased her, too.“Go on,” she said.“We don’t wear uniforms or let our purpose be known,” the man said with obviousrelief that if he continued it would satisfy her. “Usually we work in cities,searching out insurrectionists. We mingle with people, get them to think of usas one of them. When they plot against the Order, we go along until we find outthe names of all those involved and then we capture them and turn them over forquestioning.”Richard stared down at the man for a long time, his face showing no reaction.Richard had been in the hands of the Order and “questioned.” Kahlan could onlyimagine what he must have been thinking.“And do you hand over only those who you know to be plotting against the Order?”Richard asked. “Or do you simply turn in those you suspect and anyone who theyknow?”“If we suspect they might be plotting—like if they keep to themselves and theirown group, and won’t open their lives to other citizens—then we turn them in tobe questioned so that it can be determined what they might be hiding.” The manlicked his lips, keen to tell them the full extent of his methods. “We talk tothose they work with, or neighbors, and get the names of anyone they associatewith, any of their friends—sometimes even their closest family members. Weusually take at least some of them, too, and turn them over for questioning.When they’re questioned, they all confess their crimes against the Order so thatproves our suspicions about them were right.”Kahlan thought that Richard might draw his sword and behead the man on the spot.Richard knew all too well what they did to those who were brought in, knew howhopeless was their plight.Confessions obtained under torture often provided names of anyone who might besuspicious for any reason, making the job of torturing a very busy profession.The people of the Old World lived in constant fear that they would be taken toone of the many places where people were questioned.Those pulled in were rarely guilty of plotting against the Order; most peoplewere too busy just trying to survive, trying to feed their families, to havetime to plot to overthrow the rule of the Imperial Order. Many people did,however, talk about a better life, about what they would like to do, to grow, tocreate, to own, about their hopes that their children would have a better lifethan theirs. Since mankind’s duty was sacrifice to the betterment of theirfellow man, not to their own betterment, that, to the Imperial Order, was notjust insurrection, but blasphemy. In the Old World, misery was a widespreadvirtue, a duty to a higher calling.There were others who didn’t dream of a better life, but dreamed of helping theOrder by turning in the names of those who spoke ill of the Order, or hid foodor even a bit of money, or talked of a better life. Turning in such “disloyalcitizens” kept yet other fingers from pointing at the informer. Informing becamean indicator of sanctity.Instead of drawing his sword, Richard changed the subject. “How many of you werethere, tonight?”“Including me, twenty-eight,” the man said without delay.“Were you all together in one group when you attacked?”The man nodded, keen to admit their whole plan and thus gain Kahlan’s approval.“We wanted to make sure you and, and...” His eyes turned to Kahlan as herealized the incompatibility of his two goals—confessing and pleasing the MotherConfessor.He burst into tears, clasping his hands prayerfully. “Forgive me, Mistress!Please, forgive me!”If his voice was the quintessence of emotion, hers was the opposite. “Answer thequestion.”He brought his sobbing to a halt in order to speak as he had been commanded.Tears, though, continued to stream down his filthy cheeks. “We stayed togetherfor a focused attack, so we could be sure that we captured Lord Rahl and, and...you, Mother Confessor. When trying to capture a good-size group we split up,with half holding back to look for anyone who might try to slip away, but I toldthe men that I wanted the both of you, and you were said to be together, so thiswas our chance. I didn’t want to run the risk that you would have any hope offighting us off, so I ordered all the men to the attack, having some cut thethroats of the saddle horses, first, to prevent any possibility of escape.”His face brightened. “I never suspected that we might fail.”“Who sent you?” Kahlan asked.The man shuffled forward on his knees, his hand tentatively coming up to touchher leg. Kahlan remained motionless, but by her icy glare let him know thattouching her would displease her greatly. The hand backed away.“Nicholas,” he said.Kahlan’s brow twitched. She had been expecting him to say Jagang had sent him.She was wary of the possibility that the dream walker might be watching throughthis man’s eyes. Jagang had in the past sent assassins after he had slipped intotheir thoughts. With Jagang in a person’s mind, he dominated and directed them,and even Cara could not control them. Nor, for that matter, could Kahlan.“You’re lying to me. Jagang sent you.”The man fell to pitiful weeping. “No, Mistress! I’ve never had any dealings withHis Excellency. The army is vast and far-flung. I take my orders from those inmy section. I don’t think that the ones they take orders from, or theircommanders, or even theirs, are worthy of His Excellency’s attention. HisExcellency is far to the north, bringing the word of the Order’s salvation to alawless and savage people; he would not even be aware of us.“We are but a lowly squad of men with the muscle to snatch people the Orderwants, either for questioning or to silence them. We are all from this part ofthe empire and so we were called upon because we were here. I am not worthy ofthe attention of His Excellency.”“But Jagang has visited you—in your dreams. He has visited your mind.”“Mistress?” The man looked terrified to have to question her rather than answerher question. “I don’t understand.”Kahlan stared. “Jagang has come into your mind. He has spoken to you.”He looked sincerely puzzled as he shook his head. “No, Mistress. I have nevermet His Excellency. I have never dreamed about him—I don’t know anything abouthim, except that Altur’Rang has the honor of being the place where he was born.“Would you like me to kill him for you, Mistress? Please, if it is your wish,allow me to kill him for you?”The man didn’t know how preposterous such a notion was; in his desire to pleaseher, though, if she commanded it he would be only too happy to make the attempt.Kahlan turned her back on the man as Richard watched him.She leaned toward Richard a bit as she spoke quietly, so the man wouldn’t hear.“I don’t know if those visited by the dream walker must always be aware of it,but I think they would be. The ones I’ve seen before were mindful of Jagang’spresence in their mind.”“Couldn’t the dream walker slip into a person’s mind without their being awareof it just so he could watch us?”“I suppose it’s possible,” she said. “But think of all the millions of people inthe Old World—he can’t know whose mind to enter so he can watch. Dream walker ornot, he is only one man.”“Are you gifted?” Richard asked the man.“No.”“Well,” Richard whispered, “Nicci told me that Jagang rarely bothers with theungifted. She said that it was difficult for him to take the mind of theungifted, so he simply uses the gifted he controls and has them control theungifted for him. He has all the Sisters he’s captured that he has to worryabout. He has to maintain his control over them and direct theiractions—including what we started to read in Nicci’s letter—about how he’sguiding the Sisters in altering people into weapons. Besides that he heads thearmy and plans strategy. He has a lot of things to manage, so he usuallyconfines himself to the minds of the gifted.”“But not always. If he has to, if he needs to, if he wants to, he can enter theminds of the ungifted. If we were smart,” Kahlan whispered, “we would kill thisman now.”As they spoke, Richard’s glare never left the man. She knew he would nothesitate to agree unless he thought the man might still be of use.“I have but to command it,” Kahlan reminded him, “and he will drop dead.”Richard took in her eyes for a moment, then turned back to the man and frowned.“You said someone named Nicholas sent you. Who is this Nicholas?”“Nicholas is a fearsome wizard in the service of the Order.”“You saw him. He gave you these orders?”“No. We are too lowly for one such as he to bother with us. He sent orders thatwere passed down.”“How did you know where we were?” Richard asked.“The orders included the general area. They said that we should look for youcoming north at the eastern edge of the desert wasteland and if we found you wewere to capture you.”“How did Nicholas know where we were?”The man blinked, as if searching his mind to see if he had the answer. “I don’tknow. We weren’t told how he knew. We were told only that we were to search thisarea and if we found you we were to bring you both in, alive. The commander whopassed on the orders told me not to fail or the Slide would be very displeasedwith us.”“Who would be displeased? ... The Slide?”“Nicholas the Slide. That is what he’s called. Some people just call him ‘theSlide.’ “Frowning, Kahlan turned back to the man. “The what?”The man began trembling at her frown. “The Slide, Mistress.”“What does that mean? The Slide?”The man fell to wailing, his hands clasped together again as he begged herforgiveness. “I don’t know, Mistress. I don’t know. You asked who sent me, thatis his name. Nicholas. People call him the Slide.”“Where is he?” Richard asked.“I don’t know,” the man blurted out as he wept. “I received my orders from mycommander. He said that a Brother of the Order brought the orders to hiscommander.”Richard took a deep breath as he rubbed the back of his neck. “What else do youknow about this Nicholas, other than that he’s a wizard and he’s called ‘theSlide’?”“I only know to fear him, as do my commanders.”“Why? What happens if you displease him?” Kahlan asked.“He impales those who displease him.”With the stench of blood and burning flesh, along with the things she washearing, it was all Kahlan could do to keep from being sick. She didn’t know howmuch longer her stomach could take it if they stayed in this place, if this mantold her anything else.Kahlan gently grasped Richard’s forearm. “Please, Richard,” she whispered, “thisisn’t really getting us anything very useful. Please, let’s get out of here? Ifwe think of anything, we can question him more later.”“Get out in front of the wagon,” Richard said without hesitation. “I don’t wanther having to look at you.”The man bobbed his head and scrambled away.“I don’t think Jagang is in his mind,” Kahlan said, “but what if I’m wrong?”“For now, I think we should keep him alive. Out in front of the wagon, Tom willhave a clear view of him. If we’re wrong, well, Tom is very quick with hisknife.” Richard let out a shallow breath. “I’ve already learned somethingimportant.”“What?”His hand in the small of her back started her moving. “Let’s get going and I’lltell you about it.”Kahlan could see the wagon waiting in the distant darkness. Tom’s eyes followedthe man as he ran out in front of the big draft horses and stood waiting.Jennsen and Cara were in the back of the wagon. Friedrich sat up on the seatbeside Tom.“How many?” Richard called to Cara as they approached the wagon.“With the four out in the hills that Tom took care of, and this one, here,twenty-eight.”“That’s all of them, then,” Richard said with relief.Kahlan felt his hand on the small of her back slip away. He staggered to a halt.Kahlan paused beside him, not knowing why he’d stopped. Richard sank to oneknee. Kahlan dropped down beside him, throwing an arm around him for support. Hesqueezed his eyes shut in pain. With his arm pressed across his abdomen, hedoubled over.Cara leaped over the side of the wagon and raced to their side.Despite how exhausted Kahlan was, panic jolted her instantly to full alert. “Weneed to get to the sliph,” she said to Cara as well as Richard. “We need to getto Zedd and get some answers—and some help. Zedd can help.”Richard drew labored breaths, unable to speak as he held his breath against awave of agony. Kahlan felt helpless not knowing what to do to help him.“Lord Rahl,” Cara said, kneeling before him, “you have been taught to controlpain. You must do that, now.” She seized a fistful of his hair and lifted hishead to be able to look into his eyes. “Think,” she commanded. “Remember. Putthe pain in its place. Do it!”Richard clutched her forearm as if to thank her for her words. “Can’t,” hefinally managed to say to Kahlan through his obvious suffering. “We can’t go inthe sliph.”“We must,” she insisted. “The sliph is the fastest way.”“And if I step down into the sliph, breathe in that quicksilver creature—and mymagic fails?”Kahlan was frantic. “But we must go in the sliph to get there in a hurry.” Shefeared to say “in time.”“And if anything is wrong, I’ll die.” He panted, trying to catch his breathagainst the pain. “Without magic, breathing the sliph is death. The sword isfailing me.” He swallowed, coughed, gasped for breath. “If my gift is causingthe headaches, and that’s making magic falter in me, and I enter the sliph, Iwill be dead after I take the first breath. There’s no way to test it.”An icy wave of terror shot through her veins. Getting to Zedd was Richard’s onlyhope. That had been her plan. Without help, the headaches of the gift would killhim.She feared, though, that she knew why the magic of his sword was failing, and itwasn’t the headaches. She feared that it was in fact the same thing that hadcaused the seal to be broken. The warning beacon testified that she was thecause of that. If it was true, then she was the cause of that and much more.If she was right, she realized, if it was true, then Richard was right about thesliph—going into the sliph would indeed be death. If she was right, then hewouldn’t even be able to call the sliph, much less travel by it.“Richard Rahl, if you’re going to throw mud on my best ideas then you had betterhave an idea of your own to offer in its place.”He was gasping, now, in the clutch of violent pain. And then Kahlan saw bloodwhen he coughed.“Richard!”Tom, looking alarmed, raced up beside them. When he saw the blood running downRichard’s chin, he turned ashen.“Help him to the wagon,” Kahlan said, trying to keep her voice steady.Cara put her shoulder under his arm. Tom circled an arm around Richard andhelped Kahlan and Cara lift him to his feet.“Nicci,” Richard said.“What?” Kahlan asked.“You wanted to know if I had an idea. Nicci.” He gasped in pain and struggled toget his breath. Yet more blood came when he coughed. It was dripping off hischin.Nicci was a sorceress, not a wizard. Richard needed a wizard. Even if they hadto travel overland, they could race there. “But Zedd would be better able—”“Zedd is too far,” he said. “We need to get to Nicci. She can use both sides ofthe gift.”Kahlan hadn’t thought of that. Maybe she really could help.Halfway to the wagon, Richard collapsed. It was all they could do to hold up hisdead weight. With Tom gripping him under the backs of his shoulders and Cara andKahlan each holding a leg, they ran the rest of the way to the wagon.Tom, without the need of help from Cara and Kahlan, hoisted Richard into theback of the wagon. Jennsen hurriedly unfurled another bedroll. They laid Richardout as carefully as they could. Kahlan felt as if she were watching herselfreact, move, talk. She refused to allow herself to give in to panic.Kahlan and Jennsen tried to lean in, to see how he was, but Cara shoved themback out of the way. She bent over Richard, putting her ear to his mouth,listening. Her fingers felt for a pulse at the side of his throat. Her otherhand cupped the back of his neck, no doubt preparing to hold him to give him thebreath of life if she had to. Mord-Sith were knowledgeable about such things;they knew how to keep people alive in order to extend their torture. Cara knewhow to use that knowledge to help save lives, too.“He’s breathing,” Cara said as she straightened. She laid a comforting hand onKahlan’s arm. “He’s breathing easier now.”Kahlan nodded her thanks, unwilling to test her voice. She moved in closer toRichard, on the other side, while Cara wiped the blood from his chin and mouth.Kahlan felt helpless. She didn’t know what to do.“We’ll ride all night,” Tom said over his shoulder as he climbed up into thedriver’s seat.Kahlan forced herself to think. They had to get to Nicci.“No,” she said. “It’s a long way to Altur’Rang. We’re not near any roads;picking our way cross country in the dark is foolhardy. If we’re reckless andpush too hard we’ll just end up killing the horses—or they could break a leg,which would be just as bad. If we lose the horses, we can’t very well carryRichard all the way and expect to make it in time.“The wisest thing to do is to go just as fast as we possibly can, but we alsohave to get rest along the way to be ready should we be attacked again. We haveto use our heads or we’ll never make it.”Jennsen held Richard’s hand in both of hers. “He has that headache, and hefought all those men—maybe if he can just get some sleep, he’ll be better,then.”Kahlan was buoyed by that thought, even though she didn’t think it was thatsimple. She stood in the wagon bed, looking out at the man waiting for her tocommand him.“Are there any more of you? Any more sent to attack us or capture us? Did thisNicholas send anyone else?”“Not that I’m aware of, Mistress.”Kahlan spoke softly to Tom. “If he even looks like he’s going to cause anytrouble, don’t hesitate. Kill him.”With a nod, Tom readily agreed. Kahlan dropped back down and felt Richard’sbrow. His skin was cold and wet.“We’d best go on until we find a place that will be easier to defend. I thinkJennsen is right that he needs rest; I don’t think bouncing around in the backof this wagon is going to help him. We’ll all need to get some rest and thenstart out at first light.”“We need to find a horse,” Cara said. “The wagon is too slow. If we can find ahorse, I’ll ride like the wind, find Nicci, and start back with her. That way wedon’t have to wait all the way until we get there in the wagon.”“Good idea.” Kahlan looked up at Tom. “Let’s get going—find a place to stop forthe night.”Tom nodded as he threw off the brake. At his urging, the horses heaved theirweight against the hames and the wagon lurched ahead.Betty, puling softly, lay beside an unconscious Richard and put her head down onhis shoulder. Jennsen stroked Betty’s head.Kahlan saw tears running down Jennsen’s cheeks. “I’m sorry about Rusty.”Betty’s head came up. She let out a pitiful bleat.Jennsen nodded. “Richard will be all right,” she said, her voice choked withtears as she took Kahlan’s hand. “I know he will.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17Zedd thought he heard something.The spoonful of stew he was about to put into his waiting mouth paused. Heremained motionless, listening.The Keep often had sounded alive to him, as if it were breathing. Once in awhile it even sounded as if it were letting out a small sigh. Ever since he wasa boy, Zedd had, on occasion, heard loud snaps that he never could trace. Hesuspected such sounds were most likely the massive stone blocks moving just atad, popping as they yielded ground against a neighbor. There were stone blocksdown in the foundations of the Keep that were the size of small palaces.Once, when Zedd was no more than ten or twelve, a loud crack had rung throughthe entire Keep as if the place had been struck with a giant hammer. He ran outof the library, where he’d been studying, to see other people coming out ofrooms all up and down the hall, looking about, whispering their worries to oneanother. Zedd’s father had later told him that it was found to be nothing morethan one of the huge foundation blocks cracking suddenly, and while it posed nostructural problem, the abrupt snap of such an enormous piece of granite hadbeen heard throughout the Keep. Although such occurrences were rare, it was notthe last time he heard such a harmless, but frightening, sound in the Keep.And then there were the animals. Bats flew unrestricted through parts of theKeep. There were towers that soared to dizzying heights, some empty inside butfor stone stairs curving up around the inside of the outer wall on their way upto a small room at the top, or an observation deck. In the dusty streamers ofsunlight penetrating the dark interiors of those towers there could be seenmyriad bugs flitting about. The bats loved the towers.Rats, too, lived in parts of the Keep. They scurried and squeaked, sometimescausing a fright. Mice were common in places, making noise scratching andgnawing at things. And then there were the cats, offspring of former mousers andpets, but now all wild, that lived off the rats and the mice. The cats alsohunted the birds that flew in and out of uncovered openings to feed on bugs, orto build nests up in high recesses.There were sometimes awful sounds when a bat, a mouse, a bird, or even a catwent somewhere they weren’t permitted. The shields were meant to keep peopleaway from dangerous or restricted areas, but they were also placed to preventunauthorized access to many of the items stored and preserved in the Keep. Theshields guarded against life; they made no distinction between human andnonhuman life.Otherwise, after all, a pet dog that innocently wandered into a restricted areacould theoretically retrieve a dangerous talisman and proudly take it to a childmaster who could be put in peril by it. Those who placed the shields were awarethat it was also possible for unscrupulous people to train animals to go torestricted areas, snatch whatever they might be able to carry, and bring it tothem. Not knowing what animal might potentially be trained for such a task, theshields were made to ward all life. If a bat flew into the wrong shield, it wasincinerated.There were shields in the Keep that even Zedd could not get through because theyrequired both sides of the gift and he had only the Additive.Some of the shields took the form of a barrier of magic that physicallyprevented passage in some way, either by restricting movement or by inducing asensation so unpleasant that one wouldn’t force oneself beyond. Those shieldswere meant to prevent ungifted people or children from entering certain areas,not to prevent entrance to the gifted, so it was not necessary for those shieldsto kill.But such shields only worked for those who were ungifted.In other places, entrance was strictly forbidden to anyone but those with notonly the appropriate ability, but proper authority. Without both the appropriateability and authority granted by spells keyed to the particular defenses in thatarea, such as metal plates that had to be touched by an authorized wizard, theshields killed whatever entered them. The shields killed animals as infallibly,as effectively, as they would kill any intruder.Such dangerous shields gave warnings of heat, light, or tingling as a warning soas to prevent people from unintentionally going near them—after all, with thesize of the place, it was easy enough to become lost. Such warnings worked forthe animals, too, but occasionally a cat chased a panicked mouse into a lethalshield, and sometimes the cat, racing after, would run right into it as well.As Zedd waited, listening, the silence stretched on, unbroken. If he really hadheard something, it could have been the Keep moving, or an animal squeaking whenit approached a shield, or even a gust of wind coming through one of thehundreds of openings. Whatever it was, it was silent, now. The wooden spoonfulof stew finally completed its journey.“Umm...” Zedd declared to no one in particular. “Good!”To his great disappointment when he’d first tasted it, he had found that thestew wasn’t done. Rather than hurry the process with a bit of magic, andpossibly incur Adie’s wrath for meddling with her cooking, Zedd had sat down onthe couch and resigned himself to doing a bit of reading.There was no end to the reading. Books offered the potential of valuableinformation that could aid them in ways they couldn’t foretell. From time totime, as he read, he checked the progress of the stew, rather patiently, hethought.Now, as he tasted it, it finally seemed to be done. The chunks of ham were sotender they would fall apart when his tongue pressed them to the roof of hismouth. The whole delightfully bubbling pot had taken on the heady melding ofonions and oils, carrots and turnips, a hint of garlic and a dizzying swirl ofcomplementary spices, all crowded with nuggets of ham, some still with crisp fatalong one edge.To his great annoyance, Zedd had long ago noticed that Adie hadn’t made anybiscuits. Stew went well with biscuits. There should be biscuits. He decidedthat a bowl of stew would hold him until she returned and made some. Thereshould be biscuits. It was only right.He didn’t know where Adie had gone. Since he had been down in Aydindril most ofthe day, he reasoned that she had probably gone off to one of the libraries tosearch through books for anything that might be of help. She was a great helpferreting potentially relevant books out of the libraries. Being fromNicobarese, Adie sought out books in that language. There were books all overthe Keep, so there was no telling where she was.There were also storerooms filled with racks and racks of bones. Other roomscontained rows of tall cabinets, each with hundreds of drawers. Zedd had seenbones of creatures there that he had never seen in life. Adie was an expert ofsorts on bones. She had lived for a good portion of her life in seclusion in theshadow of the boundary. People living in the area had been afraid of her; theycalled her the bone woman because she collected bones. They had been everywherein her house. Some of those bones protected her from the beasts that came out ofthe boundary.Zedd sighed. Books or bones, there was no telling where she was. Besides that,there were any number of other things in the Wizard’s Keep that would be ofgreat interest to a sorceress. She might even have simply wanted to go for awalk, or up on a rampart to gaze at the stars and think.It was much easier to wait for her to come back to her stew than for him to golooking for her. Maybe he should have put one of the bells around her neck.Zedd hummed a merry tune to himself as he spooned stew into a wooden bowl. Nouse waiting on an empty stomach, he always said; that only made a persongrouchy. It was really better to have a snack and be in good humor than to waitand be miserable. He would only be bad company if he was miserable.On the eighth spoon of stew into the bowl, he heard a sound.His hand froze above the bubbling pot.Zedd thought he’d heard a bell tinkle.Zedd wasn’t given to flights of imagination or to being unreasonably jumpy, buta cold shiver tingled across his flesh as if he’d been touched by the icyfingers of a spirit reaching out from another world. He stood motionless, partlybent toward the pot in the fire, partly turned toward the hall, listening.It could be a cat. Maybe he hadn’t tied the thin cord high enough and as a catwent under the line its tail had swished up and rung the bell. Maybe a cat wasbeing mischievous and as it sat on its haunches, tail swishing back and forth,it had batted a bell. It could be a cat.Or maybe a bird had landed on the line to roost for the night. A person couldn’tget past the shields in order to trip a belled cord. Zedd had placed extrashields. It had to be an animal—a cat, or a bird.If so, if no one could get past the regular shields and the extras he hadplaced, then why had he strung bells?Despite the likely explanations, his hair was trying to stand on end. He didn’tlike the way the bell had rung; there was something about the character of thesound that told him it wasn’t an animal. The sound had been too firm, tooabrupt, too quick to stop.He realized fully, now, that a bell had in fact rung. He wasn’t imagining it. Hetried to re-create the sound in his mind so that he might be able to put shapeto the form that had tripped the cord.Zedd silently set the bowl down on the side of the granite hearth. He rose up,listening with an ear turned toward the passage from where he had heard thebell. His mind raced through a map of all the bells he’d placed.He needed to be sure.He slipped through the door and into the passageway, the back of his shoulderbrushing the plastered wall as he moved down to the first intersection on hisright, watching not just ahead but behind as well. Nothing moved in the hallwayahead. He paused, leaning ahead to take a quick glance down the hall to theright. When he found it clear, he took the turn.Zedd moved quickly past closed doors, past a tapestry of vineyards that he hadalways thought was rather poorly executed, past an empty doorway to a room witha window that looked out over a deep shaft between towers on a high rampart, andpast three more intersections until he reached the first stairway. He sweptaround the corner to the right, up the stairs that curved around to the left asthey climbed up and crossed over the hall he’d just been in. In this way hecould head back toward a network of halls where he’d placed a web of bellswithout using those same halls.Zedd followed a mental map of a complex tangle of passages, halls, rooms, anddead ends that, over a lifetime, he had come to know intimately. Being FirstWizard, he had access to every place in the Keep except those places thatrequired Subtractive Magic. There were a few places where he could get confused,but this was not one of them.He knew that unless someone was following in his footsteps, they would have toeither go back or pass a place where he had set traps of elaborate magic as wellas simple string. Then, if they didn’t see the cord, they would ring anotherbell. Then he would be sure.Maybe it was Adie. Maybe she simply hadn’t seen the inky cord stretched across adoorway. Maybe she had been annoyed that he’d strung bells and maybe she’d rungone just to vex him.No, Adie wasn’t like that. She might shake her finger at him and deliver ascathing lecture on why she didn’t agree with him that stringing bells was aneffective thing to do, but she wouldn’t pull a trick about something she wouldrecognize as intended to warn of danger. No, Adie might possibly haveaccidentally rung the bell, but she wouldn’t have rung it deliberately.Another bell rang. Zedd spun to the sound and then froze.The bell had come from the wrong direction—from where he’d set a bell on theother side of a conservatory. It was too far from the first for anyone to havemade it this soon. They would have had to go up a tower stairway, across abridge to a rampart, along a narrow walkway in the dark, past severalintersections to the correct turn that would descend a spiral ramp and make itdown through a snarl of passageways in order to break the cord.Unless there was more than one person.The bell had chimed with a quick jerk and then clattered as it skittered acrossstone. It had to be a person tripping over the cord and sending the bellskipping across the stone floor.Zedd changed his plan. He turned and raced down a narrow passageway to the left,climbing the first stairwell, running up the oak treads three at a time. He tookthe right fork at the landing, raced to the second circular stairwell of cutstone and climbed as fast as his legs would carry him. His foot slipped on thenarrow wedges of spiraling steps and he banged his shin. He paused to wince onlyfor a second. He used the time to consult his mental map of the Keep, and thenhe was moving again.At the top, he dashed down a short paneled hall, sliding to a stop on thepolished maple floor. He shouldered open a small, round-topped oak door. Astarry sky greeted him. He sucked deep draughts of cool night air as he racedalong the narrow rampart. He paused twice along the way to peer down through theslots in the crenellated battlements. He didn’t see anyone. That was a goodsign—he knew where they had to be if they weren’t moving by an outer route.He ran on across the swaying span between towers, robes flying behind, crossingover the entire section of the Keep where both bells had rung far below, goingover the top of the area in order to get behind whoever had tripped the cords.While they had tripped bells on opposite sides of the conservatory, they had tohave come in through the same wing—he knew that much. He wanted to get behindthem, bottle them in before they could get to an unprotected section where theywould encounter a bewildering variety of passageways. If they were to make itthere and hide in that area, he could have a time of rooting them out.His mind raced as fast as his feet as he tried to think, tried to recall all theshields, tried to figure how someone could have gotten past the defenses to getto that specific wing where the bells that had rung were placed. There wereshields that should have made it impossible. He had to consider thousands ofcorridors and passageways in the Keep, trying to come up with all the potentialroutes. It was like a complex multilevel puzzle, and despite how thorough he’dbeen, it was possible he’d missed something. He had to have missed something.There were rooms or even entire sections that were shielded and could not beentered, but often they could be circumvented. Even if a hall was shielded atboth ends, so as to prevent anyone from getting to the rooms in that hall, youcould still usually get around to the other end of the hall and make your way towhatever lay beyond. That was deliberate; while the rooms might have helddangerous items of magic that had to be kept contained, there needed to be waysto get to them, and get beyond to other rooms that might, from time to time,also have to be restricted. Most of the Keep was like that—a three-dimensionalmaze with almost endless possible routes.For the unwary, it could also be a killing field of traps. There were placeslayered with warning barriers and other devices that would keep any innocentperson away. Beyond those protective layers, the shields gave no warning beforethey killed. Trespassers would not know there were shields embedded beyond, andthat they were stepping into a trap. Such shields were designed that way inorder to kill invaders who penetrated that deep; the lack of warning wasdeliberate.Zedd supposed it was possible for someone to bypass all the shields and worktheir way into the depths of the place in order to ring those particular bells,but for the life of him, he couldn’t trace all the steps necessary. But whoeverit was, no matter how lucky they were, they would soon get themselves stuck inthe labyrinth and then, if they weren’t killed by a shield, he could deal withthem.Zedd gazed out past towers, ramparts, bridges, and open stairs to roomsprojecting from soaring walls, out on the city of Aydindril far below, now alldark and dead-looking. How had someone gotten past the stone bridge up to theKeep?A Sister of the Dark, maybe. Maybe one of them had figured out how to useSubtractive Magic to take his shield down. But even if one had, the shields inthe Keep were different. Most of them had been placed by the wizards in ancienttimes, wizards with both sides of the gift. A Sister of the Dark would not beable to breach such shields—they had been designed to withstand enemy wizards ofthat time. They were far more powerful than any mere Sister of the Dark.And where was Adie? She should have been back. He wished now that he had goneand found her. She needed to know that there was someone in the Keep. Unless shealready knew. Unless they had her.Zedd turned and raced down the rampart. At the projecting bastion, he seized therailing to the side to halt his forward rush and spin himself around the corner.He raced down the dark steps as if he were running down a hill.With his gift, he could sense that there was no one in the vicinity. Since therewas no one near, that meant that he had managed to get behind them. He had themtrapped.At the bottom of the steps he threw open the door and flew into the hallwaybeyond.He crashed into a man standing there, waiting.Zedd’s momentum knocked the big man from his feet. They fell in a tangle,sliding together along the polished green and yellow marble floor, bothgrappling for control.Zedd could not have been more surprised. His gifted sense told him the man wasnot there. His gifted sense was obviously wrong. The disorientation ofencountering a man when he had sensed that the hall was empty was more jarringthan the headlong tumble.Even as he was rolling, Zedd was casting webs to tangle the man in a snare ofmagic. The man, in turn, lunged to tangle Zedd in meaty arms.In desperation, despite the close range, Zedd pulled enough heat from thesurrounding air to unleash a thunderous blast of lightning and cast it directlyinto the man. The blinding flash burned a lacing line through the stone blockwall beyond him.Only too late did Zedd realize that the discharge of deadly power had lancedthrough the man without effect. The hall filled with shards of stone whistlingabout, ricocheting from walls and ceiling, skipping along the floor.The man landed on Zedd, driving the wind from him. Desperately yelling for help,the man wrestled Zedd on the slippery floor. Zedd concocted a weak and fumblingdefense, to give the man a false sense of confidence, until he was able tosuddenly land a knee sharply at the point of his attacker’s sternum. The mancried out in surprise as much as in pain as he flipped backward off Zedd,gasping to get his wind back.Having sucked so much heat from the air had left it as frigid as a winter night.Clouds of their breath filled the cold air as both men panted with the effort ofthe struggle. The man again cried out for help, hoping to bring comrades to hisaid.Zedd would assume that anyone would fear to attack a wizard by muscle alone.This man, though, had no need to fear magic. Even if he hadn’t known thatbefore, certainly the evidence was now all too clear. Yet, despite the man beingat least twice the size of his opponent, less than a third his age, and havingimmunity from the conjuring being thrown at him, Zedd thought that he foughtrather... squeamishly.However timid the man was, he was determined. He scrambled to attack again. Ifhe broke Zedd’s neck, it wouldn’t matter that he did so timidly.As the man regained his feet and lunged, Zedd drew back his arms, elbows cocked,fingers spread, and cast more of the lightning, but this time he knew betterthan to waste his effort trying to cut down a man not touched by magic. Instead,Zedd sought to rake the floor with the conjured bolts of power. It slammed intothe stone with unrestrained violence, ripping and splintering whole sections,throwing sharp jagged shards streaking through the air.A fist-sized block of stone hurtling at tremendous speed crashed into the man’sshoulder. Above the boom of thunderous power, Zedd heard bones snap. The impactspun the man around and knocked him back against the wall. Since Zedd now knewthat this intruder could not directly be harmed by magic, he instead filled thehall with a deafening storm of magic designed not to assail the man directly butto tear the place apart into a cloud of deadly flying fragments.The man, as he recoiled from striking the wall, again threw himself at Zedd. Hewas met by a shower of deadly shards whistling through the air toward him. Bloodsplattered across the wall beyond as the man was ripped to shreds. In a blink,he was killed and dropped heavily to the floor.From beyond the smoke and dust filling the hall, two more men suddenly flew atZedd. His gifted sense told him that, like the first man, these men were notthere, either.Zedd threw yet more lightning to rip up the floor and unleash flying stone atthe men, but they were already through the flares of power, diving onto him. Hecrashed to his back, the men atop him. They seized his arms.Zedd struggled frantically to let loose a blast to bring down the ceiling. Hebegan to whirl the air above the men to tear the hall to pieces, and them withit.A beefy hand with a filthy white rag clamped down over Zedd’s face. He gasped,only to inhale a powerful smell that made his throat want to clench shut, buttoo late.With the cloth and the big hand covering his whole face, Zedd couldn’t see. Theworld spun sickeningly.Soft, silent blackness pressed in around him as he fought to resist it, until helost consciousness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18Zedd woke, his head spinning, his stomach heaving with rippling waves of nausea.He didn’t think that in his entire life he had ever felt so sick. He hadn’tknown it was possible to feel so intense an urge to vomit, without actuallythrowing up. He couldn’t lift his head. If he could just die right then, itwould be a welcome release from such dizzying agony.He started to put his hands over the light hurting his eyes, but found hiswrists were tied behind his back.“I think he’s waking,” a man said in a subservient voice.Despite his nausea, Zedd instinctively tried to use his gift to sense how manypeople were around him. For some reason, his gift that ordinarily flowed aseasily as thought, as simply as using his eyes to see, his ears to hear, feltthick and slow, as if mired in molasses. He reasoned that it was probably theresult of whatever vile substance it was they had soaked the rag in to cause himto pass out when held over his face. Still, he managed to sense that there wasonly one person around him.Powerful hands seized his robes and yanked him to his feet. Zedd gave himselfpermission to vomit. Against all expectation, it didn’t happen. The dark nightswam before his blurred vision. He could make out trees against the sky, stars,and the looming black shape of the Keep.Suddenly, a tongue of flame ignited in midair. Zedd blinked at the unexpectedbrightness. The small flame, wavering with a lazy motion, floated above theupturned palm of a woman with wiry gray hair. Zedd saw other people in theshadows; his gifted sense was wrong. Like the man who had attacked him, these,too, had to be people not affected by magic.The woman standing before him peered at him intently. Her expression twistedwith satisfied loathing.“Well, well, well,” she said with patronizing delight. “The great wizard himselfawakes.”Zedd said nothing. It seemed to amuse her. Her fearsome scowl and humped nose,lit from the side by the flame she held above her palm, floated closer.“You are ours, now,” she hissed.Zedd, having waited patiently to gather his resolve, abruptly initiated therequired mental twist to the gift all the way down to his soul in order tosimultaneously call down lightning, focus air to slice this woman in two, andgather every stone and pebble from all around to crush her under an avalanche ofrock. He expected the night to light with such power as he unlocked and sentforth.Nothing happened.Not waiting to waste the time to analyze what could be the difficulty, he wasforced to abandon attempts at satisfying his emotional preferences, and toignite wizard’s fire itself to consume her.Nothing happened.Not only did nothing happen, but it felt as if the attempt itself were but apebble falling endlessly into a vast, dark well. The expectation withered in theface of what he found within himself: a kind of dreadful emptiness.Zedd felt as if he couldn’t light a tongue of flame to match hers if his lifedepended on it. He was somehow cut off from forming his ability into much ofanything useful other than to use it for a bit of dim awareness. Probably alingering result of the foul-smelling substance they had pressed over his faceto make him lose consciousness.Since Zedd couldn’t muster any power, he did the only thing he could: he spit inher face.With lightning speed, she backhanded him, knocking him from the arms of the menholding him. Unable to use his hands to break his fall, he hit the groundunexpectedly hard. He lay in the dirt for a time, his ears ringing in theaftereffect of the hit he’d taken, waiting for someone to lean over and killhim.Instead, they hauled him to his feet again. One of the men seized his hair andpulled his head up, forcing him to look into the woman’s face. The scowl he sawthere looked like it spent a great deal of time on her face.She spit in his face.Zedd smiled. “So, here we have a spoiled child playing the game of tit for tat.”Zedd grunted with the sudden shock of a wallop of pain that twisted inside ofhis abdomen. Had the men not been holding him under his arms he would havedoubled over and fallen to the ground. He wasn’t quite sure how she had doneit—probably with a fist of air delivered with all the power of her gift behindit. She had left the gathered air loosely formed, rather than focusing it to asharp edge, or it would have torn him in two. As it was, he knew it would leavehis middle black and blue.It was a long and desperate wait before he was able to at last draw a breath.The men who his gift said weren’t there pulled him straight.“I’m disappointed to discover I’m in the hands of a sorceress who can be no moreinventive than that,” Zedd mocked.That brought a smile to her scowl. “Don’t you worry, Wizard Zorander, HisExcellency very much wants your scrawny hide. He will be playing a game of titfor tat that I believe you will find quite inventive. I have learned that whenit comes to inventive cruelty, His Excellency is peerless. I’m sure he will notdisappoint you.”“Then what are we standing around for? I can’t wait to have a word with HisExcellency.”As the men held his head back for her, she ran a fingernail down the side of hisface and across his throat, not hard enough to draw blood, but enough to hint ather own restrained cruelty. She leaned in again. One eyebrow lifted in a waythat ran a chill up Zedd’s spine.“I imagine you have grand ideas about such a visit, about what you think youwill do or say.” She reached out and hooked a finger around something at hisneck. When she gave it a firm tug, he realized that he was wearing a collar ofsome sort. By the way it dug into the flesh at the back of his neck, it had tobe metal.“Guess what this is,” she said. “Just guess.”Zedd sighed. “You really are a tedious woman. But I imagine you’ve heard thatofttimes before.”She ignored his gibe, eager to be the messenger of bad news. Her scowling smilewidened. “It’s a Rada’Han.”Zedd’s sense of alarm rose, but he kept any trace of it from his face.“Really.” He paused for an extended, bored yawn. “Well, I’d not expect a womanof your limited intellect to think up something clever.”She slammed a knee into his groin. Zedd doubled over in pain, unable to containhis groan. He hadn’t been expecting something so crude.The men pulled him up straight, not allowing him pause to recover. Being pulledup straight brought a gasp of agony. His teeth were clenched, his eyes werewatering, and his knees wanted to buckle, but the men held him upright.Her smile was getting annoying. “You see, Wizard Zorander? Being clever isn’tnecessary at all.”Zedd saw her point but didn’t say so.He was already preparing to unlock the cursed collar from his neck. He’d been“captured” before—by the Prelate herself—and had had a Rada’Han put around hisneck, like some boy born with the gift who needed training. The Sisters of theLight put such a collar around those boys so that the gift wouldn’t harm thembefore they could learn to control their gift. Richard had been captured and putin such a Rada’Han right after his gift came to life in him.The collar was also used to control the young wizard wearing it, to give pain,when the Sisters thought it necessary. Zedd understood the Prelate’s reasons forwanting Richard’s help, since they knew he had been born with both sides of thegift, and, too, they worried about the dark forces that pursued him, but hecould never forgive her for putting Richard in a collar. A wizard needed to betrained by a wizard, not some misguided gaggle like the Sisters of the Light.The Prelate, though, had harbored no delusion of actually training Richard to bea wizard. She had collared him in order to smoke out the traitors among herflock: the Sisters of the Dark.Unlike Richard, though, Zedd knew how to get such a disgusting contrivance offhis neck. In fact, he had done it before, when the Prelate had thought to collarhim and thus force his cooperation.Zedd used a thread of power to probe at the lock, not overtly, so as this womanmight notice it, but just enough to find the twist in the spell where he wouldbe able to focus his ability to snap the conjured lock.When the time was right, when he had his feet solidly under him, when his headstopped spinning long enough, he would break the collar’s hold. In that sameinstant, before she knew what had happened, he would release wizard’s fire andincinerate this woman.She hooked a finger under the collar again and gave it another tug.“The thing is, my dear wizard, I would expect that a man of your renowned talentmight know how to get such a device off.”“Really? I’m renowned?” Zedd flashed her a grin. “That’s very gratifying.”Her utter contempt brought her a smile of pure disdain. With her finger throughthe collar she pulled him close to her twisted expression. She ignored his wordsand went on.“Since His Excellency would be extremely displeased should you get the collaroff, I’ve taken measures to insure that such a thing would not happen. I usedSubtractive Magic to weld it on.”Now, that was a problem.She nodded to the men. Zedd glanced to them at each side and noticed for thefirst time that their eyes were wet. It shocked him to realize they wereweeping.Weeping or not, they followed her orders, unceremoniously lifting him andheaving him in the back of a wagon as if he were firewood.Zedd landed beside someone else.“Glad to see you be alive, old man,” a soft voice rasped. It was Adie. The sideof her face was swollen and bleeding. It looked like they’d clubbed her nearlyto death. Her wrists were tied behind her back as well. He saw, too, tears onher cheeks.It broke his heart to see her hurt. “Adie, what did they do to you?”She smiled. “Not as much as they intend to, I fear.”In the dim light of a lantern, Zedd could see that she, too, wore one of theawful collars.“Your stew was excellent,” he said.Adie groaned. “Please, old man, do not mention food to me right now.”Zedd cautiously turned his head and saw more men waiting in the darkness off tothe side. They had been behind him, so he hadn’t noticed them before. His gifthad not told him they were there.“I think we’re in a great deal of trouble,” he whispered to no one inparticular.“Really?” Adie rasped. “What be your first clue?”Zedd knew she was only trying to make him smile, but he could not even manage asmall one.“I be sorry, Zedd.”He nodded, as best he could lying on his side with his wrists bound behind hisback. “I thought I was so clever, laying every kind of trap I could think of.Unfortunately, such traps didn’t work for those who are not affected by magic.”“You could not know of such a thing,” Adie said in a comforting tone.His mood sank into bitter regret. “I should have taken it into account after weencountered that one down at the Confessors’ Palace, in the spring. I shouldhave realized the danger.” He stared off into the darkness. “I served our causeno better than a fool.”“But where did all of them come from?” She looked on the verge of losing herselfto panic. “I have never encountered a single such person in my entire life, andnow there be a whole gang of them standing there.”Zedd hated to see Adie so distraught. Adie only knew there were a number of themby the telltale sounds they made. At least he could see the men with his eyes,if not his gift.The men stood around, heads hanging, waiting to be commanded.They didn’t look pleased by what was happening. They all looked young, in theirtwenties. Some were crying. It seemed strange to see such big men weeping. Zeddalmost regretted killing one of them. Almost.“You three,” the woman growled to more of the men waiting in the shadows as shelifted another lantern from one of them and sent the flame she held into it,“get in there and start the search.”Adie’s completely white eyes turned to Zedd, her expression grave. “Sister ofthe Dark,” she whispered.And now they had the Keep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19And just how can you be sure that it was a Sister of the Dark you saw?” Vernaasked, absently, as she dipped her pen again.She scrawled her initials at the bottom of the request for a Sister to travel toa town down south to see to a local sorceress’s plans for a defense of theirarea. Even in the field, the paperwork of the office of the Prelate seemed tohave chased after and found her. Their palace had been destroyed, the prophethimself was at large and the real Prelate was off alone chasing after him, someof the Sisters of the Light had pledged their souls to the Keeper of theunderworld and in so doing had brought the Keeper a step closer to having themall in the dark forever of eternity, a good number of the Sisters—both Sistersof the Light and Sisters of the Dark—were in the cruel hands of the enemy anddoing his bidding, the barrier separating the Old and New World was down, thewhole world had been turned upside down, the only man—Richard Rahl—whom prophecynamed as having a chance of defeating the threat of the Imperial Order was offwho-knew-where doing who-knew-what, and yet, the paperwork managed to survive itall and persist to vex her.Some of Verna’s assistants handled the paperwork and the requests, but, as muchas she disliked dealing with such tedious matters, Verna felt a sense of duty tokeep an eye on it all. Besides, as much as paperwork vexed her, it also occupiedher mind, preventing her from dwelling on the might-have-been.“After all,” Verna added, “it could just as easily have been a Sister of theLight. Jagang uses both for their ability with magic. You can’t really be sureit was a Sister of the Dark. He’s been sending Sisters to accompany his scoutsall winter and spring.”The Mord-Sith placed her knuckles on the small desk and leaned in. “I’m tellingyou, Prelate, it was a Sister of the Dark.”Verna saw no point in arguing, since it mattered little, so she didn’t. “If yousay so, Rikka.”Verna turned over the paper to the next in the stack, a request for a Sister tocome and speak to children on the calling of the Sisters of the Light, with alecture on why the Creator would be against the ways of the Imperial Order andon their side. Verna smiled to herself, imagining how Zedd would fume at thevery idea of a Sister, in the New World, lecturing her views on such a subject.Rikka withdrew her knuckles from the desk. “I thought you might say as much.”“Well, there you go, then,” Verna mumbled as she read the next message from theSisters of the Light to the south reporting on the passes through the mountainsand the methods that had been used to seal them off.“Wait right here,” Rikka growled before flying out of the tent.“I’m not going anywhere,” Verna said with a sigh as she scanned the writtenaccount, but the fiery, blond-headed woman was already gone.Verna heard a commotion outside the tent. Rikka was delivering a scathinglecture to someone. The Mord-Sith was incorrigible. That was probably why,despite everything, Verna liked her.Since Warren had died, Verna’s heart was no longer in much of anything, though.She did as she had to, did her duty, but she couldn’t make herself feel anythingbut despair. The man she loved, the man she had married, the most wonderful manin the world... was gone.Nothing much mattered after that.Verna tried to do her part, to do as was needed, because so many people dependedon her, but, if truth be told, the reason she worked herself nearly to death wasto try to keep her mind occupied, to think of something else, anything else,except Warren. It didn’t really work, but she kept at it. She knew that peoplecounted on her, but she just couldn’t make herself truly care.Warren was gone. Life was empty of what mattered most to her. That was the endof it, the end of her caring about much of anything.Verna idly pulled her journey book from her belt. She didn’t know what made herdo so, except perhaps that it had been some time since she had last looked for amessage from the real Prelate. Ann was having her own crisis of caring eversince Kahlan had laid the blame for so much of what had gone wrong, includingbeing the cause of the war itself, right at the Prelate’s feet. Verna thoughtthat Kahlan had been wrong about much of it, but she understood all too well whyshe thought that Ann had been responsible for tangling up their lives; Verna hadfelt the same way for a time.Holding the journey book off to the side with one hand, flipping the pages witha thumb, Verna saw a message flash by.Rikka swept back into the tent. She plunked a heavy sack down on Verna’s desk,right on top of the reports.“Here!” Rikka said, fury powering her voice.It was then, when Verna looked up, that she saw for the first time the strangeway Rikka was dressed. Verna’s mouth fell open. Rikka was not wearing theskintight red leather that the Mord-Sith typically wore, except for occasionallywhen they were relaxing and then they sometimes wore brown leather, instead.Verna had never seen the woman in anything other than those leather outfits.Now Rikka had on a dress.Verna could not remember being so astonished.Not just a dress, but a pink dress that no decent woman of Rikka’s age, probablyher late twenties or early thirties, would be caught dead in. The necklineplunged down to reveal ample cleavage. The twin mounds of exposed flesh wereshoved up and nearly spilling out the top. Verna was amazed that Rikka’s nippleshad managed to remain covered, what with the way her breasts heaved with herheated breathing.“You, too?” Rikka snapped.Verna finally looked up into Rikka’s blazing blue eyes. “Me, too, what?”“You, too, can’t get enough of looking at my chest?”Verna felt her face go scarlet. She gave her red face an excuse by shaking afinger at the woman.“What are you doing dressed like that in an army camp! Around all thesesoldiers! You look like a whore!”Despite how their leather outfits went all the way up to their necks, the tightleather left little to the imagination. Seeing the woman’s flesh, though, wasaltogether different, and quite shocking.Verna realized, only then, because she had finally looked up at the woman’sface, that Rikka’s single braid was undone. Her long blond hair was as free as ahorse’s mane. Verna had never seen one of the Mord-Sith out in public withouther hair done up in the single braid that in large part identified theirprofession of Mord-Sith.Even seeing the woman’s cleavage exposed was not as shocking as seeing her hairundone. It was that, more than anything, Verna realized, that lent a lewd lookto the woman. Something about her braid being undone seemed sacrilegious, eventhough Verna could not condone a profession dedicated to torture.Verna remembered, then, that she had asked one of the Mord-Sith, Cara, to do herworst to the young man—a boy, really—who had murdered Warren. Verna had sat upthe entire night listening to that young man scream his life away. His sufferinghad been monstrous, and yet it had not been nearly enough to suit her.At times, Verna wondered if in the next life the Keeper of the underworld wouldhave something wholly unpleasant in store for her for all eternity in recompensefor what Verna had done. She didn’t really care; it had been worth whatever theprice might be.Besides, she decided, if she was to be punished for condemning that man to justretribution, then the very concept of justice would have to be invalid,rendering living a life of good or evil to have no meaning. In fact, for thejustice she had meted out to that vile amoral animal walking the world of lifein the form of a man who had murdered Warren, she should be rewarded in theafterlife by being eternally in the warmth of the Creator’s light, along withthe good spirit of Warren, or else there was no justice.General Meiffert swept into the tent, fists at his sides, coming to a haltbeside Rikka. He raked his blond hair back when he saw Verna sitting behind herlittle desk, and cooled visibly.He’d had the carpenters nail together the tiny desk for her out of scrapfurniture left in an abandoned farm. It was nothing like the desks at the Palaceof the Prophets, of course, but it had been given with more concern and meaningbehind it than the grandest gold-leafed desk she had ever seen. General Meifferthad been proud at seeing how useful Verna found it.With a quick glance, he took in Rikka’s dress and her hair. “What’s this about?”“Well,” Verna said, “I’m not sure. Something about one of Jagang’s Sistersscouting a pass.”Rikka folded her bare arms atop her nearly bare bosom. “Not just a Sister, but aSister of the Dark.”“Jagang has been sending Sisters scouting the passes all winter,” the younggeneral said. “The Prelate has laid traps and shields.” His level of concernrose. “Are you telling us that one of them got through?”“No, I’m telling you that I went hunting for them.”Verna frowned. “What are you talking about? We lost half a dozen Mord-Sithtrying that. After you found the heads of two of your sister Mord-Sith mountedon pikes, the Mother Confessor herself ordered you to stop throwing their livesaway on such useless missions.”Rikka at last smiled. It was the kind of satisfied smile, especially coming froma Mord-Sith, that tended to give people nightmares.“Does this look useless?”Rikka reached into her sack and pulled out a human head. Holding it by the hair,she brandished it in front of Verna’s face. She turned, shook it at GeneralMeiffert as well, and then plunked it down on the desk. Gore oozed out over thereports.“Like I said, a Sister of the Dark.”Verna recognized the face, even as twisted in death as it was. Rikka was right,it was a Sister of the Dark. The question was, how did she know it was a Sisterof the Dark, and not one of the Light?Outside Verna could hear horses clopping past her tent. Some of the soldierscalled out greetings to men returning from patrols. In the distance could beheard conversations and men issuing orders. Hammers on steel rang like bells asmen worked hot metal into useful shapes for repairs to equipment. Nearby, horsesfrisked in a corral. As men made their way past Verna’s tent, their gearjingled. Fires crackled as wood was added for the cooks or roared as bellowspumped to turn it white-hot for the blacksmiths.“You touched her with your Agiel?” Verna asked in a quiet voice. “Your Agieldoesn’t work effectively on those the dream walker controls.”Rikka’s smile turned sly. She spread her arms. “Agiel? Do you see an Agiel.”Verna knew that no Mord-Sith would ever let her Agiel out of her control. With aglance to the woman’s cleavage, she could only imagine where she had it hidden.“All right,” General Meiffert said, his tone no longer indulgent. “I want toknow what’s going on, and I want to know right now.”“I was down near Dobbin Pass, checking around, and what do I find but anImperial Order patrol.”The general nodded as he let out a frustrated sigh. “They’ve been coming in thatway from time to time. But how did you manage to come across such an enemypatrol? Why hadn’t one of our Sisters already snared them?”Rikka shrugged. “Well, this patrol was still on the other side of the pass. Backat that deserted farm.” She tapped Verna’s desk with her toe. “Where you got thewood for this.”Verna twisted her mouth with displeasure. Rikka wasn’t supposed to be beyond thepass. The Mord-Sith, though, recognized no orders but those from Lord Rahlhimself. Rikka had only followed Kahlan’s orders because, during his absence,Kahlan was acting on Richard’s behalf. Verna suspected that it was simpler thanthat, though; she suspected that they had only followed the Mother Confessor’sorders because she was wife to Lord Rahl, and if they didn’t it would bring LordRahl’s wrath down on them. As long as such orders weren’t viewed by theMord-Sith as troublesome, they went along. When they decided otherwise, they didas they wished.“The Sister was by herself,” Rikka went on, “having one powerful-lookingheadache.”“Jagang,” Verna said. “Jagang was issuing his order, or punishing her forsomething, or giving her a lecture in her mind. He does that from time to time.It isn’t pleasant.”Rikka stroked the hair on the woman’s head sitting on Verna’s desk, making amess of the reports. “The poor thing,” she mocked. “While she was off among thepines staring at nothing while she pressed her fingers to her temples, her menwere back at the farmhouse, having their way with a couple of young women. Thetwo were squealing and crying and carrying on, but the men weren’t put off by itany.”Verna lowered her eyes as she let out a heavy breath. Some people had refused tobelieve the necessity of fleeing before the arrival of the Imperial Order.Sometimes, when people refused to recognize the existence of evil, they foundthemselves having to face precisely that which they had never been willing toadmit existed.Rikka’s satisfied smile returned. “I went in and took care of the brave soldiersof the Imperial Order. They were so distracted, they paid no attention as Isnuck up behind them. The women were so terrorized that they screamed eventhough I was saving them. The Sister hadn’t been paying any attention to thescreaming before, and didn’t then, either.“One of the young women was blond and about my size, so an idea struck me. I puton her dress and took out my braid, so I might be mistaken for her. I gave theone girl some of the men’s clothes to wear and told them both to run for thehills, in the opposite direction of the Sister, and not to look back. I didn’thave to tell them twice. Then I sat down on a stool outside the barn.“Sure enough, in a while the Sister came back. She saw me sitting there, hangingmy head, pretending to be crying. She thought the other woman was still inside,with the men. She said, ‘It’s time those foolish bastards in there were donewith you and your friend. His Excellency wants a report, and he wants itnow—he’s ready to move.’ “Verna came up out of her chair. “You heard her say that?”“Yes.”“Then what?” General Meiffert asked.“Then the Sister made for the side door into the barn. When she stormed past me,I rose up behind her and cut her throat with one of the men’s knives.”General Meiffert leaned toward Rikka. “You cut her throat? You didn’t use yourAgiel?”Rikka gave him a look that suggested she thought he hadn’t been payingattention. “Like the Prelate said, an Agiel doesn’t work very well on those thedream walker controls. So I used a knife. Dream walker or not, cutting herthroat worked just fine.”Rikka lifted the head before Verna again. One of the reports stuck to the bottomof it as it swung by the hair. “I sliced the knife through her throat and aroundher neck. She was thrashing about quite a bit, so I had a good hold on her asshe died. All of a sudden, there was an instant when the whole world wentblack—and I mean black, black as the Keeper’s heart. It was as if the underworldhad suddenly taken us all.”Verna looked away from the head of a Sister she had known for a very long timeand had always believed was devoted to the Creator, to the light of life. Shehad been devoted, instead, to death.“The Keeper came to claim one of his own,” Verna explained in a quiet voice.“Well,” Rikka said, rather sarcastically, Verna thought, “I didn’t think thatwhen a Sister of the Light died such a thing happened. I told you it was aSister of the Dark.”Verna nodded. “So you did.”General Meiffert gave the Mord-Sith a hurried clap on the back of the shoulder.“Thanks, Rikka. I’d better spread the word. If Jagang is starting to move, itwon’t be many days before he’s here. We need to be sure the passes are readywhen his force finally gets here.”“The passes will hold,” Verna said. She let out a silent sigh. “At least for awhile.”The Order had to come across the mountains if they were to conquer D’Hara. Therewere few ways across those formidable mountains.Verna and the Sisters had shielded and sealed those passes as well as it waspossible to seal them. They had used magic to bring down walls of rock inplaces, making the narrow roads impassable. In other places, they had used theirpower to cleave away roads cut into the steep sides of mountains, leaving no waythrough, except to clamber over rubble. To prevent that, and in other places,the men had worked all winter constructing stone walls across the passes. Atopthose walls were fortifications from which they could rain down death on thenarrow passes below. Additionally, in every one of those places, the Sisters hadset snares of magic so deadly that coming through would be a bloody ordeal thatwould only get worse, and that was before they encountered the walls lined withdefenders.Jagang had Sisters of the Dark to try to undo the barriers of both magic andstone, but Verna was more powerful, in the Additive anyway, than any of them.Besides that, she had joined her power with other Sisters in order to invest inthose barriers magic that she knew would prove formidable.Still, Jagang would come. Nothing Verna, her Sisters, and the D’Haran army coulddo would ultimately be able to withstand the numbers Jagang would throw at them.If he had to command his men to march through passes filled a hundred feet deepwith their fallen comrades, he would not flinch from doing so. Nor would itmatter to him if the corpses were a thousand feet deep.“I’ll be back a little later, Verna,” the general said. “We’ll need to get theofficers and some of the Sisters together and make sure everything is ready.”“Yes, of course,” Verna said.Both General Meiffert and Rikka started to leave.“Rikka,” Verna called. She gestured down at the desk. “Take the dear departedSister with you, would you please?”Rikka sighed, which nearly spilled her bosom out of the dress. She made along-suffering face before snatching up the head and vanishing out of the tentbehind the general.Verna sat down and put her head in her hands. It was going to start all overagain. It had been a long and peaceful, if bitterly cold, winter. Jagang hadmade his winter encampment on the other side of the mountains, far enough awaythat, with the snow and cold, it was difficult to launch effective raids againsthis troops. Just as it had the summer before, the summer Warren had died, nowthat the weather was favorable, the Order would begin to move. It was startingall over again. The killing, the terror, the fighting, running, hunger,exhaustion.But what choice was there, other than to be killed. In many ways, life had cometo seem worse than death.Verna abruptly remembered, then, about the journey book. She worked it out ofthe pocket in her belt and pulled the lamp closer, needing the comfort as wellas the light. She wondered where Richard and Kahlan were, if they were safe, andshe thought, too, about Zedd and Adie all alone guarding the Wizard’s Keep.Unlike everyone else, at least Zedd and Adie were safe and at peace where theywere—for the time being, anyway. Sooner or later, D’Hara would fall and thenJagang would return to Aydindril.Verna tossed the small black book on the desk, smoothed her dress beneath herlegs, and scooted her chair closer. She ran her fingers over the familiarleather cover on an object of magic that was over three thousand years old. Thejourney books had been invested with magic by those mysterious wizards who solong ago had built the Palace of the Prophets. A journey book was twinned, andas such, they were priceless; what was written in one appeared at the same timein its twin. In that way, the Sisters could communicate over vast distances andknow important information as it happened, rather than weeks or even monthslater.Ann, the real Prelate, had the twin to Verna’s.Verna, herself, had been sent by Ann on a journey of nearly twenty years to findRichard. Ann had known all along where Richard had been. It was for that reasonthat Verna could understand Kahlan’s rage at how Ann had seemed to twist her andRichard’s life. But Verna had come to understand that the Prelate had sent heron what was actually a mission of vital importance, one that had brought changeto the world, but also brought hope for the future.Verna opened the journey book, holding it a little sideways to see the words inthe light.Verna, Ann wrote, I believe I have discovered where the prophet is hiding.Verna sat back in surprise. After the palace had been destroyed, Nathan, theprophet, had escaped their control and had since been roaming free, a profounddanger.For the last couple of years, the rest of the Sisters of the Light had believedthat the Prelate and the prophet were dead. Ann, when she’d left the Palace ofthe Prophets with Nathan on an important mission, had feigned their deaths andnamed Verna Prelate to succeed her. Very few people other than Verna, Zedd,Richard, and Kahlan knew the truth. During that mission, however, Nathan hadmanaged to get his collar off and escape Ann’s control. There was no tellingwhat catastrophe that man could cause.Verna leaned over the journey book again.I should have Nathan within days, now. I can hardly believe that after all thistime, I nearly have my hands on that man. I will let you know soon.How are you, Verna? How are you feeling? How are the Sisters and how go matterswith the army? Write when you can. I will be checking my journey book nightly. Imiss you terribly.Verna sat back again. That was all there was. But it was enough. The very notionof Ann finally capturing Nathan made Verna’s head swim with relief.Even that momentous news, though, failed to do much to lift her mood. Jagang wasabout to launch his attack on D’Hara and Ann was about to finally have Nathanunder control, but Richard was somewhere off to the south, beyond their control.Ann had worked for five hundred years to shape events so that Richard could leadthem in the battle for the future of mankind, and now, on the eve of what couldvery well prove to be that final battle, he was not there with them.Verna drew the stylus out of the journey book’s spine and leaned over to writeAnn a report.My dearest Ann, I’m afraid that things here are about to become very unpleasant.The siege of the passes into D’Hara is about to begin."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20The sprawling corridors of the People’s Palace, seat of power in D’Hara, werefilled with the whisper of footsteps on stone. Ann pushed herself back a littleon the white marble bench where she sat stuffed between three women on one sideand an older couple on the other, all gossiping about what people were wearingas they strolled the grand halls, or what other people did while they were here,or what they most wanted to see. Ann supposed that such gossip was harmlessenough and probably meant to take people’s minds off the worries of the war.Still, it was hard to believe that at such a late hour people would rather beout gossiping than in a warm bed asleep.Ann kept her head down and pretended to be pawing through her travel bag whileat the same time keeping a wary eye on the soldiers passing not too far away asthey patrolled. She didn’t know if her caution was necessary, but she wouldrather not find out too late that it was.“Come from far?” the closest woman beside her asked.Ann looked up, realizing that the woman had spoken to her. “Well, yes, I guessit has been a bit of a journey.”Ann put her nose back in her bag and rummaged in earnest, hoping to be leftalone.The woman, middle-aged with her curls of brown hair just starting to carry a bitof gray, smiled. “I’m not all that far from home, myself, but I do so like tospend a night at the palace, now and then, just to lift my spirits.”Ann glanced around at the polished marble floors, the glossy red stone columnsbelow arches, decorated with carved vines, that supported the upper balconies.She gazed up at the skylights that allowed the light to flood in the placeduring the day, and peered off at the grand statues that stood on pedestalsaround a fountain with life-sized stone horses galloping forever through ashimmering spray of water.“Yes, I see what you mean,” Ann murmured.The place didn’t lift her spirits. In fact, the place made her as nervous as acat in a doghouse with the door closed. She could feel that her power wasfrighteningly diminished in this place.The People’s Palace was more than any mere palace. It was a city all joinedtogether and under countless roofs atop a huge plateau. Tens of thousands ofpeople lived in the magnificent structure, and thousands more visited it daily.There were different levels to the palace itself, some where people had shopsand sold goods, others where officials worked, some that were living quarters.Many sections were off limits to those who visited.Sprawled around the base of the plateau were informal markets where peoplegathered to buy, sell, and trade goods. On the climb all the way up through theinterior of the plateau to reach the palace itself, Ann had passed manypermanent shops. The palace was a center of trade, drawing people from all overD’Hara.More than that, though, it was the ancestral home of the House of Rahl. As such,it was grand for arcane reasons beyond the awareness or even understanding ofmost of the people who called it home or visited it. The People’s Palace was aspell—not a place spelled, as had been the Palace of the Prophets where Ann hadspent most of her life. The place itself was the spell.The entire palace had been built to a careful and precise design: that of aspell drawn on the face of the ground. The outer fortified walls contained theactual spell form and the major congregations of rooms formed significant hubs,while the halls and corridors themselves were the drawn lines—the essence of thespell itself, the power.Like a spell being drawn in the dirt with the point of a stick, the halls wouldhave had to have been built in the sequence required by the specific magic thespell was intended to invoke. It would have been enormously expensive to buildit in that manner, ignoring the typical requirements of construction andaccepted methods of the trade of building, but only by doing so would the spellwork, and work it did.The spell was specific. It was a place of safety for any Rahl. It was meant togive a Rahl more power in the place, and to leach power away from anyone elsewho entered. Ann had never been in a place where she felt such a waning of herHan, the essence of life and the gift within. She doubted that in this place herHan would for long be vital enough to light a candle.Ann’s jaw dropped in astonishment as another element of the spell abruptlyoccurred to her. She looked out at the halls—part of the lines of thespell—filled with people.Spells drawn with blood were always more effective and powerful. But when theblood soaked into the ground, decomposed, and dissipated, the power of the spellwould often fade as well. But this spell, the drawn lines of the spellitself—the corridors—were filled with the vital living blood of all the peoplemoving through them. Ann was struck dumb with awe at such a brilliant concept.“So, you’re renting a room, then.”Ann had forgotten the woman beside her, still staring at her, still holding thesmile on her painted lips. Ann forced herself to close her mouth.“Well...” Ann finally admitted, “I haven’t actually made arrangements yet as towhere I will sleep.”The woman’s smile persisted, but it looked as if it was taking more and moreeffort all the time. “You can’t curl up on a bench, you know. The guards won’tallow it. You have to rent a room, or be put out at night.”Ann understood, then, what the woman was driving at. To these people, mostdressed in their finest clothes for their visit to the palace, Ann must looklike a beggar in their midst. After all the gossip about what people werewearing, this woman must have been disconcerted to find herself beside Ann.“I have the price of a room,” Ann assured her. “I just haven’t found where theyare, yet, that’s all. After such a long journey, I meant to go there right awayand get myself cleaned up, but I just needed to rest my weary feet for a bit,first. Could you tell me where to find the rooms to rent?”The smile looked a little easier. “I’m off to my own room and I could take you.It isn’t far.”“That would be kind of you,” Ann said as she rose now that she saw the guardsmoving off down the corridor.The woman stood, bidding her two benchmates a good night.If Ann was tired, it was only from being caught up in the afternoon devotion tothe Lord Rahl. A bell in an open square had tolled, and everyone had moved togather there and bow down. Ann had noticed then that no one missed the devotion.Guards moved among the crowd watching people gather. She felt like a mouse beingwatched by hawks so she joined with the other people moving toward the square.She had spent nearly two hours on her knees, on a hard clay tile floor, boweddown with her forehead touching the ground like everyone else, repeating thedevotion in concert with all the other somber voices.Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.Twice a day, those in the palace were expected to go to the devotion. Ann didn’tknow how people endured such torture.Then she remembered the bond between the Lord Rahl and his people that preventedthe dream walker from entering their minds, and she knew how they could endureit. She, herself, had briefly been a prisoner of Emperor Jagang. He murdered aSister right before her eyes, just to make a point.In the face of brutality and torture, she guessed that she knew how peopleendured a mere devotion.For her, though, such a spoken devotion to the Lord Rahl, to Richard, was hardlynecessary. She had been devoted to him for nearly five hundred years before hehad even been born.Prophecy said that Richard was their only chance to avoid catastrophe. Annpeered carefully around the halls. Now she just needed the prophet himself.“This way,” the woman said, tugging at Ann’s sleeve.The woman gestured for Ann to follow her down a hallway to the right. Ann pulledher shawl forward, covering the pack she carried, and hugged her travel bagcloser as she followed along the wide corridor. She wondered how many peoplesitting on benches and low marble walls around fountains were gossiping abouther.The floor had a dizzying pattern of dark brown, rust, and pale tan-colored stonerunning across the hall in zigzag lines meant to look three-dimensional. Ann hadseen such traditional patterns before, down in the Old World, but none of thisgrand scale. It was a work of art, and it was but the floor. Everything aboutthe palace was exquisite.Shops were set back under a mezzanine to each side. Some of them looked to sellitems travelers might want. There was a variety of small food and drink stands,everything from hot meat pies, to sweets, to ale, to warm milk. Some places soldnightclothes. Others sold hair ribbons. Even at this late hour, some of theshops were still open and doing brisk business. In a place such as this, therewould be people who worked at night and would have need of such shops. Theplaces that offered to do up a woman’s hair, or paint her face, or promised todo wonders with her fingernails, were all closed until morning. Ann doubted theycould pull off wonders with her.The woman cleared her throat as they strolled down the broad corridor, gazing atthe shops to each side. “And where have you traveled from?”“Oh, far to the south. Very far.” Ann took note of the woman’s focused attentionas she leaned in a bit. “My sister lives here,” Ann said, giving the womansomething more to chew on. “I’m here to visit my sister. She advises Lord Rahlon important matters.”The woman’s eyebrows lifted. “Really! An advisor to Lord Rahl himself. What anhonor for your family.”“Yes,” Ann drawled. “We’re all proud of her.”“What does she advise him on?”“Advise him on? Oh, well, matters of war.”The woman’s mouth fell open. “A woman? Advising Lord Rahl on warfare?”“Oh yes,” Ann insisted. She leaned over and whispered, “She’s a sorceress. Seesinto the future, you know. Why, she wrote me a letter and told me she saw mecoming to the palace for a visit. Isn’t that amazing?”The woman frowned a bit. “Well, that does seem rather remarkable, since here youare and all.”“Yes, and she told me that I’d meet a helpful woman.”The woman’s smile returned, it again looked forced. “She sounds to be quitetalented.”“Oh, you have no idea,” Ann insisted. “She is so specific in her forecasts aboutthe future.”“Really? Had she anything else to say about your visit, then? Anythingspecific?”“Oh yes indeed. Why, do you know that she told me I would meet a man when I camehere?”The woman’s gaze flicked around the halls. “There are a lot of men here. Thathardly seems very specific. Surely, she must have said more than that... I mean,if she is so talented, and an advisor to Lord Rahl and all.”Ann put a finger to her lip, frowning in feigned effort at recollection. “Why,yes, she did, now that you mention it. Let’s see if I can remember...” Ann laida hand on the woman’s arm in a familiar manner. “She tells me about my futureall the time. My sister is always telling me so many things about my future inher letters that I sometimes feel as if I’m having trouble catching up with myown life! I sometimes have trouble remembering it all.”“Oh do try,” the woman said, eager for the gossip. “This is so fascinating.”Ann returned the finger to her lower lip as she gazed at the ceiling, pretendingto be engaged in deep thought, and noticed for the first time that the ceilingwas painted like the sky, with clouds and all. The effect was quite clever.“Well,” Ann finally said when she was sure she had the woman’s full attention,“my sister said that the man I would meet was old.” She returned the hand to thewoman’s arm. “But very distinguished. Not old and decrepit, but tall—verytall—with a full head of white hair that comes all the way down to his broadshoulders. She said that he would be clean-shaven, and that he would be ruggedlyhandsome, with penetrating dark azure eyes.”“Dark azure eyes ... my, my,” the woman tittered, “but he does sound handsome.”“And she said that when he looks at a woman with those hawklike eyes of his,their knees want to buckle.”“That is precise,” the woman said, her face getting flushed. “Too bad she didn’tknow this handsome fellow’s name.”“Oh, but she did. What kind of advisor to the Lord Rahl would she be if shewasn’t talented enough to know such things.”“She told his name, too? She can really do such tellings of the future?”“Oh my yes,” Ann assured her.She strolled along for a time, watching people making their way up and down thehall, stopping at some of the shops that were still open, or sitting on benches,gossiping.“And?” the woman asked. “What is the name your sister foretold? The name of thistall distinguished gentleman.”Ann frowned up at the ceiling again. “It was N something. Nigel or Norris, orsomething. No, wait—that wasn’t it.” Ann snapped her finger and thumb. “The nameshe said was Nathan.”“Nathan,” the woman repeated, looking almost as if she had been ready to pluckthe name off Ann’s tongue if she didn’t spit it out. “Nathan.”“Yes, that’s it. Nathan. Do you know anyone here at the palace by that name?Nathan? A tall fellow, older, with long white hair, broad shoulders, azureeyes?”The woman peered up at the ceiling in thought. This time it was Ann leaning in,waiting for word, watching intently for any reaction.A hand seized Ann’s dress at her shoulder and brought her to an abrupt halt. Annand the woman turned.Behind them stood a very tall woman, with a very long blond braid, with veryblue eyes, wearing a very dark scowl and an outfit of very red leather.The woman beside Ann went as pale as vanilla pudding. Her mouth fell open. Annforced her own mouth to stay shut.“We’ve been expecting you,” the woman in red leather said.Behind her, back up the hallway a short distance, spread out to block the hall,stood a dozen perfectly huge men in perfect leather armor carrying perfectlypolished swords, knives, and lances.“Why, I think you must have me mistaken for—”“I don’t make mistakes.”Ann wasn’t nearly as tall as the blond woman in red leather. She hardly came uppast the yellow crescent and star across her stomach.“No, I don’t suppose you do. What’s this about?” Ann asked, losing the timidinnocent tone.“Wizard Rahl wanted us to bring you in.”“Wizard Rahl?”“Yes. Wizard Nathan Rahl.”Ann heard a gasp from the woman beside her. She thought the woman was going tofaint, and so took hold of her arm.“Are you all right, my dear?”She stared, wide-eyed, at the woman in red leather glowering down at her. “Yes.I have to go. I’m late. I must go. Can I go?”“Yes, you had better go,” the tall blonde said.The woman dipped a quick bow and muttered “Good night” before scurrying off downthe hall, looking over her shoulder only once.Ann turned back to the scowl. “Well I’m glad you found me. Let’s be off to seeNathan. Excuse me ... Wizard Rahl.”“You won’t be having an audience with Wizard Rahl.”“You mean, not tonight, I won’t be having an ... audience with him tonight.”Ann was being as polite as she could be, but she wanted to clobber thattroublesome man, or wring his neck, and the sooner the better.“My name is Nyda,” the woman said.“Pleased to meet—”“Do you know what I am?” She didn’t wait for Ann to answer. “I am Mord-Sith. Igive you this one warning as a courtesy. It is the only warning, or courtesy,you will receive, so listen closely. You came here with hostile intent againstWizard Rahl. You are now my prisoner. Use of your magic against a Mord-Sith willresult in the capture of that magic by me or one of my sister Mord-Sith and itsuse as a weapon against you. A very, very unpleasant weapon.”“Well,” Ann said, “in this place my magic is not very useful, I’m afraid. Hardlyworth a hoot, as a matter of fact. So, you see, I’m quite harmless.”“I don’t care how useful you find your magic. If you try to so much as light acandle with it, your power will be mine.”“I see,” Ann said.“Don’t believe me?” Nyda leaned down. “I encourage you to try to attack me. Ihaven’t captured a sorceress’s magic for quite a while. Might be ... fun.”“Thank you, but I’m a bit too tired out—from my travels and all—to be attackinganyone just now. Maybe later?”Nyda smiled. In that smile Ann could see why Mord-Sith were so feared. “Fine.Later, then.”“So, what is it you intend to do with me in the meantime, Nyda? Put me up in oneof the palace’s fine rooms?”Nyda ignored the question and gestured with a tilt of her head. Two of the men ashort way back up the hall rushed forward. They towered over Ann like two oaktrees. Each grasped her under an arm.“Let’s go,” Nyda said as she marched off down the hall ahead of them.The men started out after her, pulling Ann along with them. Her feet seemed totouch the floor only every third or fourth step. People in the hall parted forthe Mord-Sith. Passersby pressed themselves up against the walls to the side, agoodly distance away. Some people disappeared into the open shops, from wherethey peered out windows. Everyone stared at the squat woman in the dark dressbeing hauled along by the two palace guards in burnished leather and gleamingmail. Behind she could hear the jangle of metal gear as the rest of the menfollowed along.They turned into a small hall to the side going back between columns holding aprojecting balcony. One of the men rushed forward to unlock the door. Before sheknew it, they’d all swept through the little door like wine through a funnel.The corridor beyond was dark and cramped—nothing like the marble-lined hallwaysmost people saw. Not far down the hall, they turned down a stairway. The oaktreads creaked underfoot. Some of the men handed lanterns forward so Nyda couldlight her way. The sound of all the footsteps echoed back from the darknessbelow.At the bottom of the steps, Nyda led them through a maze of dirty stonepassageways. The seldom-used halls smelled musty, and in places damp. When theyreached another stairwell, they continued down a square shaft with landings ateach turn, descending into the dark recesses of the People’s Palace. Annwondered how many people in the past were taken by routes such as this, never tobe seen again. Richard’s father, Darken Rahl, and his father before him, Panis,were rather fond of torture. Life meant nothing to men such as those.Richard had changed all that.But Richard wasn’t at the palace, now. Nathan was.Ann had known Nathan for a very long time—for nearly a thousand years. For mostof that time, as Prelate, she had kept him locked in his apartments. Prophetscould not be allowed to roam free. Now, though, this one was free. And, worse,he had managed to establish his authority in the palace—the ancestral home ofthe House of Rahl. He was an ancestor to Richard. He was a Rahl. He was awizard.Ann’s plan suddenly started to seem very foolish. Just catch the prophet offguard, she’d thought. Catch him off guard and snap a collar back around hisneck. Surely, there would be an opening and he would be hers again.It had seemed to make sense at the time.At the bottom of the long descent, Nyda swept to the right, following a narrowwalk with a stone wall soaring up on the right and an iron railing on the left.Ann gazed off over the railing, but the lantern light showed nothing but inkydarkness below. She feared to think how far it might drop—not that she had anyideas of a battle with her captors, but she was beginning to worry that theyjust might heave her over the edge and be done with her.Nathan had sent them, though. Nathan, as irascible as he could sometimes be,wouldn’t order such a thing. Ann considered, then, the centuries she had kepthim locked away, considered the extreme measures it had sometimes taken to keepthat incorrigible man under control. Ann glanced over the iron rail again, downinto the darkness.“Will Nathan be waiting for us?” she asked, trying to sound cheerful. “I’dreally like to talk to him. We have business we must discuss.”Nyda shot a dark look back over her shoulder. “Nathan has nothing to talk to youabout.”At an uncomfortably narrow passageway tunneling into the stone on the right,Nyda led them into the darkness. The way the woman rushed lent a frighteningaspect to an already frightening journey.Ann at last saw light up ahead. The narrow passageway emptied into a small areawhere several halls converged. Ahead and to the right they all funneled downsteep stairs that twisted as they descended. As she was prodded down the stairs,Ann gripped the iron rail, fearful of losing her footing, although the big handholding a fistful of her dress at her right shoulder would probably preclude anychance of falling, to say nothing of running off.In the passageway at the bottom of the stairs, Nyda, Ann, and the guards came toa halt under the low-beamed ceiling. Wavering light from torches in floor standsgave the low area a surreal look. The place stank of burning pitch, smoke, stalesweat, and urine. Ann doubted that any fresh air ever penetrated this deep intothe People’s Palace.She heard a hacking cough echoing from a dim corridor to the right. She peeredinto that dark hall and saw doors to either side. In some of the doors fingersgripped iron bars in small openings. Other than the coughing, no sound came fromthe cells holding hopeless men.A big man in uniform waited before an iron-bound door to the left. He looked asif he might have been hewn from the same stone as the walls. Under differentcircumstances, Ann might have thought that he was a pleasant enough lookingfellow.“Nyda,” the man said by way of greeting. When his eyes turned back up after apolite bow of his head, he asked in his deep voice, “What have we here?”“A prisoner for you, Captain Lerner.” Nyda seized the empty shoulder of Ann’sdress and hauled her forward as if showing off a pheasant after a successfulhunt. “A dangerous prisoner.”The captain’s appraising gaze glided briefly over Ann before he returned hisattention to Nyda. “One of the secure chambers, then.”Nyda nodded her approval. “Wizard Rahl doesn’t want her getting out. He saidshe’s no end of trouble.”At least half a dozen curt responses sprang to mind, but Ann held her tongue.“You had better come with us, then,” Captain Lerner said, “and see to her beinglocked in behind the shields.”Nyda tilted her head. Two of her men dashed forward and pulled torches fromstands. The captain finally found the right key from a dozen or so he had on aring. The lock sprang open with a strident clang that filled the surrounding lowcorridors. It sounded to Ann like a bell being tolled for the condemned.With a grunt of effort, the captain tugged the heavy door, urging it to slowlyswing open. In the long hallway beyond, Ann saw but a couple of candles bringingmeager light to the small openings in doors to each side. Men began hooting andhowling, like animals, calling vile curses at who might be entering their world.Arms reached out, clawing the air, hoping to net a touch of a passing person.The two men with torches swept into the hall right behind Nyda, the firelightilluminating her in her red leather so all those faces pressed up against theopenings in their doors could see her. Her Agiel, hanging on a fine chain at herwrist, spun up into her fist. She glared at the openings in the doors to eachside. Filthy arms drew back in. Voices fell silent. Ann could hear men scurry tothe far recesses of their cells.Nyda, once certain there would be no misbehavior, started out again. Big handsshoved Ann ahead. Behind, Captain Lerner followed with his keys. Ann pulled thecorner of her shawl over her mouth and nose, trying to block the sickeningstench.The captain took a small lamp from a recess, lit it from a candle to the side,and then stepped forward to unlock another door. In the low passageway beyond,the doors were spaced closer together. A hand covered with infected lesions hunglimp out of one of the tiny openings to the side.The hall beyond the next door was lower, and no wider than Ann’s shoulders. Shetried to slow her racing heart as she followed the rough, twisting passageway.Nyda and the men had to stoop, arms folded in, as they made their way.“Here,” Captain Lerner said as he came to a halt.He held up his lantern and peered into the small opening in the door. On thesecond try, he found the right key and unlocked the door. He handed his smalllamp to Nyda and then used both hands to pull the lever. He grunted and tuggedwith all his weight until the door grated partway open. He squeezed around thedoor and disappeared inside.Nyda handed in the lamp as she followed the captain in. Her arm, sheathed in redleather, came back out to seize a fistful of Ann’s dress and drag her in after.The captain was opening a second door on the other side of the tiny room. Anncould sense that this was the room containing the shield. The second door gratedopen. Beyond was a room carved from solid bedrock. The only way out was throughthe door, and the outer room that contained the shield, and then the seconddoor.The House of Rahl knew how to build a secure dungeon.Nyda’s hand gripped Ann’s elbow, commanding her into the room beyond. Even Ann,as short as she was, had to duck as she stepped over the high sill to getthrough the doorway. The only furniture inside was a bench carved from the stoneof the far wall itself, providing both a seat and a bed off the floor. A tinewer full of water sat on one end of the bench. At the opposite end was asingle, folded, brown blanket. There was a chamber pot in the corner. At leastit was empty, if not clean.Nyda set the lamp on the bench. “Nathan said to leave you this.”Obviously it was a luxury the other guests weren’t afforded.Nyda stepped one leg over the sill, but paused when Ann called her name.“Please give Nathan a message for me? Please? Tell him that I would like to seehim. Tell him that it’s important.”Nyda smiled to herself. “He said you would say those words. Nathan is a prophet,I guess he would know what you would say.”“And will you give him that message?”Nyda’s cold blue eyes looked to be weighing Ann’s soul. “Nathan said to tell youthat he has a whole palace to run, and can’t come running down to see you everytime you clamor for him.”Those were almost the exact words she had sent down to Nathan’s apartmentscountless times when a Sister had come to her with Nathan’s demands to see thePrelate. Tell Nathan that I have a whole palace to run and I can’t go runningdown there every time he bellows for me. If he has had a prophecy, then write itdown and I will look it over when I have the time.Until that moment, Ann had never truly realized how cruel her words had been.Nyda pulled the door shut behind her. Ann was alone in a prison she knew shecould not escape.At least she was near the end of her life, and could not be held as a prisonerfor nearly her entire life, as she had held Nathan prisoner for his.Ann rushed to the little window. “Nyda!”The Mord-Sith turned back from the second door, from beyond the shield Ann couldnot cross. “Yes?”“Tell Nathan ... tell Nathan that I’m sorry.”Nyda let out a brief laugh. “Oh, I think Nathan knows you’re sorry.”Ann thrust her arm through the door, reaching toward the woman. “Nyda, please.Tell him ... tell Nathan that I love him.”Nyda stared at her a long moment before she pushed the outer door closed."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21Kahlan lifted her head. She gently laid a hand on Richard’s chest as she turnedher ear toward the sound she’d heard off in the darkness. Beneath her hand,Richard’s chest rose and fell with his labored breathing, but, even at that, shefelt relief—he was still alive. As long as he was alive she could fight to finda solution. She wouldn’t give him up. They would get to Nicci. Somehow, theywould get to her.A quick glance to the position of the quarter moon told her that she’d beenasleep less than an hour. Clouds, silvery in the moonlight, had silently begunstreaming in from the north. In the distant sky she saw, too, the moonlit wingsof the black-tipped races that always trailed them.She hated those birds. The races had been following them ever since Cara hadtouched the statue of Kahlan that Nicci said was a warning beacon. Those darkwings were never far, like the shadow of death, always following, alwayswaiting.Kahlan recalled all too well the sand in that hourglass statue trickling out.Her time was running out. She had no actual indication of what would happen whenthe time that sand had represented finally ran out—but she could imagine wellenough.The place where they had set up camp, before a sharp rise of rock with a standof bristlecone pine and thorny brush to one side, wasn’t as protected or tenablea camp as any of them would have liked, but Cara had confided that she wasafraid that if they didn’t stop, Richard wouldn’t live the night.That whispered warning had set Kahlan’s heart to pounding, brought cold sweat toher brow, and swept her to the verge of panic.She had known that the rough wagon ride, slow as it had been while they madetheir way across open country in the dark, seemed to have made it more difficultfor Richard to breathe. Less than two hours after they had started out, afterCara’s warning, they’d been forced to stop. After they had stopped, they wereall relieved that Richard’s breathing became more even, and sounded a littleless labored.They needed to make it to roads so that traveling would be easier on Richard,and so they could make better time. Maybe after he rested the night, they couldmake swifter progress.She had to fight constantly to tell herself that they would get him there, thatthey had a chance, and that the journey’s purpose wasn’t merely empty hope meantto forestall the truth.The last time Kahlan had felt this helpless, felt this sense of Richard’s lifeslipping away, she’d at least had one solid chance available to her to save him.She’d had no idea, at the time, that that one chance taken would be the catalystthat would initiate a cascade of events that would begin the disintegration ofmagic itself.She was the one who had made the decision to take that chance, and she was theone responsible for all that was now coming to pass. Had she known what she nowknew, she would have made the same decision—to save Richard’s life—but that madeher no less liable for the consequences.She was the Mother Confessor, and, as such, was responsible for protecting thelives of those with magic, of creatures of magic. And, instead, she might verywell be the cause of their end.Kahlan sprang to her feet, sword in hand, when she heard Cara’s whistledbirdcall to alert them to her return. It was a birdcall Richard had taught her.Kahlan slid the shutter on the lantern open all the way to provide more light.She saw Tom, hand resting on the silver-handled knife at his belt, rise from thenearby rock where he’d been sitting as he watched over both the camp and the manKahlan had touched with her power. The man still lay on the ground at Tom’s feetwhere Kahlan had ordered him to stay.“What is it?” Jennsen whispered as she appeared at Kahlan’s side, hastilyrubbing the sleep from her eyes.“I’m not sure, yet. Cara signaled, so she must have someone with her.”Cara walked in out of the darkness, and, as Kahlan had suspected, she waspushing a man ahead of her. Kahlan frowned, trying to recall where she’d seenhim before. She blinked, then, realizing it was the young man they had comeacross a week or so back—Owen.“I tried to get to you sooner!” Owen cried out when he saw Kahlan. “I swear, Itried.”Holding him by the shoulder of his light coat, Cara marched the man closer, thenyanked him to a halt in front of Kahlan.“What are you talking about?” Kahlan asked.When Owen caught sight of Jennsen standing behind Kahlan’s shoulder, he pausedwith his mouth hanging open for an instant before he answered.“I meant to get to you earlier, I swear,” he said to Kahlan, sounding on theverge of tears. “I went to your camp.” He clutched his light coat closed at hischest as he began to tremble. “I, I saw ... I saw all the ... remains. DearCreator, how could you be so brutal?”Kahlan thought Owen looked like he might throw up. He covered his mouth andclosed his eyes as he shook.“If you mean all those men,” Kahlan said, “they tried to capture us, to kill us.We didn’t collect them from their rocking chairs beside their hearths and bringthem out into this wasteland where we slaughtered them. They attacked us; wedefended ourselves.”“But, dear Creator, how could you...” Owen stood before her, unable to controlhis shivering. He closed his eyes. “Nothing is real. Nothing is real. Nothing isreal.” He repeated it over and over, as if it were an incantation meant toprotect him from evil.Cara forcibly dragged Owen back a bit and sat him down on a shelf of rock. Eyesclosed meditatively, he mumbled “Nothing is real” to himself continually whileCara took up a position to the left side of Kahlan.“Tell us what you’re doing here,” Cara commanded in a low growl. Although shedidn’t say it, the “or else” was clear enough.“And be quick about it,” Kahlan said. “We have enough trouble and we don’t needyou added on top of it.”Owen opened his eyes. “I went to your camp to tell you about it, but... allthose bodies...”“We know about what happened back there. Now, tell us why you’re here.” Kahlanwas at the end of her patience. “I’m not going to ask you again.”“Lord Rahl,” Owen wailed, tears bursting forth at last.“Lord Rahl what,” Kahlan demanded through gritted teeth.“Lord Rahl has been poisoned,” he blurted out as he wept.Gooseflesh prickled up Kahlan’s legs. “How can you possibly know such a thing istrue?”Owen stood, clutching twisted wads of his coat at his chest. “I know,” he cried,“because I’m the one who poisoned him.”Could it be? Could it be that it wasn’t really the runaway power of the giftkilling Richard, but poison? Could it be that they had it all wrong? Could it bethat it was all caused by this man poisoning Richard?Kahlan felt her sword’s hilt slip from her fingers as she started for the man.He stood watching her come, like a fawn watching a mountain lion about to leap.Kahlan knew there was something strange about this man. Richard, too, hadthought there was something unsettling about him, something not quite right.Somehow, this quaking stranger had poisoned Richard.Richard barely hung to life. He was suffering and in pain. This man had been thecause of it all. Kahlan would know why, and she would know the truth of it.Kahlan closed the distance quickly. She would not risk his escape. She would notrisk his lies.She would have his confession.Her hand started coming up toward him. Her power was recovered—she could feel itthere, in the core of her being, at the ready.This man had tried to kill Richard. She intended to find out if there was a wayto save him. This man could tell her.She committed herself to taking him.It was not necessary for Kahlan to invoke her birthright, but merely to withdrawher restraint of it. Her feelings about what this man had done faded away; theyno longer mattered in this. Only the truth would serve her now. She was a beingof raw commitment.He had no chance. He was hers.She saw him standing frozen, watching her come, saw his blue eyes widen, saw thetears running down his cheeks. Kahlan felt the cold coil of power straining forrelease, demanding to be freed. As her hand rose toward this man who had harmedRichard, she wanted nothing so much as what she would have.He was hers.Cara abruptly jumped in between them.Kahlan’s sight of the man was blocked by the Mord-Sith. Kahlan tried to brushCara aside, but she was ready and firmly held her ground. Cara seized Kahlan bythe shoulders and forced her back three paces.“No. Mother Confessor, no.”Kahlan was still focused on Owen, even if she couldn’t see him. “Get out of myway.”“No. Stop.”“Move!” Kahlan tried to shove Cara aside, but the woman had her feet spread andcouldn’t be budged. “Cara!”“No. Listen to me.”“Cara, get out of—”She shook Kahlan so hard that Kahlan thought her neck would snap. “Listen tome!”Kahlan panted in rage. “What.”“Wait until you hear what he says. He came here for a reason. When he finishes,you can use your power if you want, or you can let me make him scream until themoon covers its ears, but first we need to hear what he says.”“I’ll find out soon enough what he says, and I’ll know the truth. When I touchhim he will confess every detail.”“And if Lord Rahl dies as a result? Lord Rahl’s life hanging in the balance. Wemust think of that first.”“I am. Why do you think I’m going to do this?”Cara pulled Kahlan close to hear her whisper. “And what if using your power onthis man kills him for some reason we don’t yet even know about. Remember whenwe didn’t know everything in the past? Remember Marlin Pickard announcing he hadcome to assassinate Richard? It was too easy then, and it’s too easy this time.“What if your touching this man is someone’s design—a trick, with this man sentas bait of some sort? What if they want you to do it for some reason? What ifyou do what they intend you to do—then what? It won’t be a simple mistake thatwe can work to fix. If Lord Rahl dies we can’t bring him back.”Cara’s fierce blue eyes were wet. Her powerful fingers dug into Kahlan’sshoulders. “What can it hurt to hear him first, before you touch him? You canthen touch him, if you still think it’s necessary—but hear him first. MotherConfessor, as a sister of the Agiel, I’m asking you, please, for the sake ofLord Rahl’s life, wait.”More than anything, it was Cara’s reluctance to use force that gave Kahlanpause. If there was anyone who would be more than willing to use physical forceto protect Richard, it was Cara.In the dim light of the lantern, Kahlan studied the emotion in Cara’sexpression. Despite everything Cara said, Kahlan didn’t know if she could affordto take the chance, to hesitate.“What if it’s a stab in the dark?” Jennsen asked from behind.Kahlan glanced back over her shoulder at Richard’s sister, at the worry on herface.Kahlan had made a mistake before in not acting quickly enough, and it resultedin Richard being captured and taken from her. Then it was his freedom; this timeit was his life at stake.She knew that while hesitation had been a mistake in that instance, that didn’tmean that immediate action was always right.She looked back into Cara’s eyes. “All right. We’ll hear what he has to say.”With a thumb, she brushed a tear from Cara’s cheek, a tear of terror forRichard, a tear of terror at the thought of losing him. “Thanks,” Kahlanwhispered.Cara nodded and released her. She turned and folded her arms, fixing Owen in herglare.“You had better not make me sorry for stopping her.”Owen peered about at all the faces watching him—Friedrich, Tom, Jennsen, Cara,Kahlan, and even the man Kahlan had touched, lying on the ground not far away.“In the first place, how could you possibly have poisoned Richard?” Kahlanasked.Owen licked his lips, fearful of telling her, even though that was apparentlywhy he had returned. His gaze finally broke toward the ground.“When I saw the dust rising from the wagon, and I knew that I was near, I dumpedout what water I had left, so it would appear I had none. Then, when Lord Rahlfound me, I asked for a drink. When he gave me his waterskin so I could have adrink, I put poison in it, just before I handed it back. I was relieved that youhad showed up, too. It was my intention that I poison both Lord Rahl and you,Mother Confessor, but you had your own water and didn’t take a drink when heoffered it to you. But I guess it doesn’t matter. This will work just as well.”Kahlan couldn’t make sense of such a confession. “So you intended to kill usboth, but you were only able to poison Richard.”“Kill... ?” Owen looked up in shock at the very idea. He shook his heademphatically. “No, no, nothing like that. Mother Confessor, I tried to get toyou earlier, but those men went to your camp before I got there. I needed to getthe antidote to Lord Rahl.”“I see. You wanted to save him—after you’d poisoned him—but when you got to ourcamp, we’d gone.”His eyes filled with tears again. “It was so awful. All the bodies—the blood.I’ve never seen such brutal murder.” He covered his mouth.“It would have been murder—our murder,” Kahlan said, “had we not defendedourselves.”Owen seemed not to hear her. “And you were gone—you’d left. I didn’t know whereyou’d gone. It was hard to follow your wagon’s trail in the dark, but I had to.I had to run, to catch up with you. I was afraid the races would get me, but Iknew I had to reach you tonight. I couldn’t wait. I was afraid, but I had tocome.”The whole story was nonsense to Kahlan.“So you’re like one of those people who starts a fire, calls out an alarm, andthen helps put it out—all so you can be a hero.”Startled, Owen shook his head. “No, no, nothing like that. Nothing like that atall—I swear. I hated doing it. I did. I hated it.”“Then why did you poison him!”Owen twisted his light coat in his fists as tears trickled down his cheeks.“Mother Confessor, we have to give him the antidote, now, or he will die. It’salready so very late.” He clasped his hands prayerfully and gazed skyward. “DearCreator, let it not be too late, please.” He reached out for Kahlan, as if tourgently beg her as well, to assure her of his sincerity, but at the look on herface, drew back. “There’s no more time, Mother Confessor. I tried to get to youearlier—I swear. If you don’t let him have the remedy now, it will be the end ofhim. It will all be for naught—everything, all if it, all for nothing!”Kahlan didn’t know if she dared trust in such an offer. It made no sense topoison a man and then save him.“What’s the antidote?” she asked.“Here.” Owen hurriedly pulled a small vial from a pocket inside his coat. “Hereit is. Please, Mother Confessor.” He held the square-sided vial out toward her.“He must have this now. Please, hurry, or he will die.”“Or this will finish him,” Kahlan said.“If I wanted to finish him, I could have done so when I slipped the poison intohis waterskin. I could have used more of it, or I could simply not have comewith the antidote. I’m not a killer, I swear—that’s why I had to come in thefirst place.”Owen wasn’t making a whole lot of sense. Kahlan wasn’t confident in such anoffer. It was Richard’s life that would be forfeit if she chose wrong.“I say we give Richard Owen’s antidote,” Jennsen whispered.“A stab in the dark?” Kahlan asked.“You said that there were times when there is no choice but to act immediately,but even then it must be with your best judgment, using all your experience andeverything you do know. Earlier, in the wagon, I heard Cara tell you that shedidn’t know if Richard would live the night. Owen says he has an antidote. Ithink this is one of those times we must act.”“If it means anything,” Tom offered in a confidential tone, “I’d have to agree.I don’t see as there really is any choice. But if you have an alternative thatmight save Lord Rahl, I think now would be the time to add it to the stew.”Kahlan didn’t have any alternative, except getting to Nicci, and that waslooking more and more like no more than empty hope.“Mother Confessor,” Friedrich offered in a hushed tone, “I agree as well. Ithink you should know that if you let him have the remedy, we all were inagreement that it was the best choice to be made.”If the antidote killed Richard, they wouldn’t blame her. That was what he wassaying.Jennsen stepped toward Owen, pulling Betty along with her. “If you’re lyingabout this being an antidote, you will have to answer to me, and to Cara, andthen to the Mother Confessor—if there’s even anything left of you by then. Youdo understand that, don’t you?”Owen shrank from her, his head turned away, as he nodded vigorously, apparentlyfearing to look up at her, or at Betty. Kahlan thought that he looked moreafraid of Jennsen than of any of the rest of them.Cara leaned toward Kahlan and whispered. “He has to have an antidote. Whatpurpose would it be to place himself in danger of all we’ll do to him if he’slying? Why even come back here, if he only wanted to poison Lord Rahl? He hadalready poisoned him and gotten away. Mother Confessor, I say that we give LordRahl the antidote, and we do it quickly.”“Then why poison him in the first place?” Kahlan whispered back. “If you intendto give a man the antidote, then why poison him?”Cara let out a frustrated sigh. “I don’t know. But right now, if Lord Rahldies...”Cara’s words trailed off at the unthinkable.Kahlan looked over at Richard lying unconscious. She went weak at the thought ofhim never waking. How could she live in a world without Richard?“How much do we give him?” she asked Owen.Owen rushed forward, past Jennsen. “All of it. Make him drink it all down.” Hepressed the small, square-sided bottle into Kahlan’s hands. “Hurry. Pleasehurry.”“You’ve hurt him,” Kahlan said with unrestrained menace. “Your poison hurt him.He’s been coughing up blood, and he passed out from the pain. If you think I’llever forget that and be pleased with you for now returning to save his life,you’re wrong.”Owen nervously licked his lips. “But I tried to get to you. I was bringing youthe antidote so that wouldn’t happen. I never intended him such pain. I tried toget to you—but you slaughtered all those men.”“So, it’s our fault, then?”Owen smiled just a bit as he nodded, a small smile of satisfaction that she’dfinally seen the light and at last understood that it wasn’t his fault at all,but their fault.While Jennsen watched Owen, keeping him back out of the way, Tom watched the manKahlan had touched, and Friedrich watched Betty, Kahlan and Cara knelt andlifted Richard so they could try to get him to drink the antidote. Cara proppedhis back against her thigh while Kahlan cradled his head in her arm.She pulled the stopper with her teeth and spit out the cork. Careful not tospill and waste any of the antidote, she put the bottle to his lips and tippedit up. She watched it wet his lips. She tilted his head back more, so that hismouth would fall open a bit, and tipped the bottle some more. Carefully, she letsome of the clear liquid dribble into his mouth.Kahlan didn’t know if what was in the bottle really was an antidote. It wascolorless and looked to her just like water. As Richard smacked his lips alittle, swallowing what she had poured in his mouth, Kahlan smelled the bottle.The liquid had the slight aroma of cinnamon.She dribbled more of it into Richard’s mouth. He coughed, but then swallowed.Cara used a finger to swipe up a drop that ran down his chin and return it tohis mouth.Kahlan, her heart pounding with worry, poured the rest of the liquid past hislips. Holding the empty bottle between her thumb and first finger, she used thepalm of her hand to push Richard’s jaw up, forcing his head back, forcing him toswallow.She sighed with relief when he swallowed several times, taking all the cure. Atleast she’d been able to get him to swallow it.Carefully, Kahlan and Cara laid Richard back down. As Cara stood, Owen rushedforward.“Did you give him all of it? Did he drink it all?”Cara’s Agiel spun into her fist. As Owen, in his exuberance to get to Richard,charged forward, Cara rammed her Agiel into Owen’s shoulder.Owen tottered back a step. “I’m sorry.” He rubbed his shoulder where Cara hadjabbed her Agiel into him. “I only wanted to see how he is. I don’t mean anyharm. I want him to be well, I swear.”Kahlan stared in astonishment. Cara glanced down at her Agiel, then at Owen.Her Agiel hadn’t worked on him. He wasn’t affected by magic.Even Jennsen was staring at Owen. He was just like her—a pillar of Creation,born pristinely ungifted and unaffected by magic. While Jennsen understood whatthat meant, it didn’t seem that Owen did. He had no idea that Cara had doneanything more than poke him good and hard to get him to stand back.Her Agiel should have dropped him to his knees.“Richard drank all the antidote. Now it must do its work. In the meantime, Ithink we had better get some sleep.” Kahlan gestured with a tilt of her head.“See to the watches, would you Cara? I’ll stay with Richard.”Cara nodded. She gave Tom a look, which he understood.“Owen,” Tom said, “why don’t you come over by me and spend the night over here,with this fellow.”Owen blanched at the look on the face of the big D’Haran, and understood that hewasn’t being offered a choice. “Yes, all right.” He turned back to Kahlan. “I’llpray that he got the antidote in time. I’ll pray for him.”“Pray for yourself,” she said.When everyone had gone, Kahlan lay down beside Richard. Now that she was alonewith him, tears of worry finally began to seep out. Richard was shivering withcold, even though it was a warm night. She drew the blanket back up around himand then put her hand on his shoulder as she cuddled close, not knowing if whenthe new day came he would still be with her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22Richard opened his eyes, only to squint at the light, even though it was farfrom sunny. By the layered streaks of violet tinting the iron gray sky, itappeared to be just dawn. A heavy overcast hung low overhead. Or it could besunset—he wasn’t really sure. He felt strangely disoriented.The dull throbbing in his head ached back down through his neck. His chestburned with every breath he drew. His throat was raw. It hurt to swallow.The heavy pain, though, the pain that had squeezed so hard it had taken hisbreath and had made the world go black, seemed to have ebbed. The bone-chillinggrip of cold had lifted, too.Richard felt as if he had lost contact with the world for a time—how long a timehe didn’t know. It seemed like it had been an eternity, as if the world of lifewas a distant memory from his past. He also felt as if he had come close tonever waking again. It brought a flash of sweat to his brow to feel that he hadbeen close to losing his life, to realize that he might never have awakened.The surroundings were different from those he remembered. Close by, a wall ofstraw-colored rock with sharp fractured edges rose nearly straight up. To theside he saw a stand of twisted bristlecone pine. Pale, bare wood stood out innaked relief where sections of dark bark had peeled open. The imposing mountainsloomed closer than he remembered, and there were more trees on the slopes of thenearby hills.Jennsen lay curled up in a blanket beside Betty, her back against the rear wheelof the wagon. Tom was asleep not too far away right beside his draft horses.Friedrich sat on a rock standing watch. Richard couldn’t make sense of the twomen who lay at Friedrich’s feet. Richard thought one of them must be the manKahlan had touched with her power. The other one, though, he wasn’t sure of,although Richard thought there was something familiar about him.Kahlan was sound asleep up against him. His sword lay on his other side, closeby his hand. On the other side of Kahlan lay her sword, sheathed, but at theready.All the Seekers who had used the Sword of Truth before Richard, the good and theevil, had left within the sword’s magic the essence of their skill. By masteringthe sword as the true Seeker for whom the makers of the sword intended itspower, Richard had learned to tap that ability and make it his own, to draw onall the skill and knowledge of those before him. He had become a master of theblade, in more ways than one, and part of that had come from the blade itself.Kahlan had been taught to use a sword by her father, King Wyborn Amnell, onceking of Galea before Kahlan’s mother had taken him for her mate. Richard hadcompleted Kahlan’s training, teaching her how to use a sword in ways she hadnever been shown, ways that used her size and speed to her best advantage,rather than fighting like the enemy and depending on strength.Despite his pounding head, and the pain when he drew a breath, the warm feel ofKahlan against his side brought him a smile. She looked so beautiful, even withher hair all in a tangle. She made his heart ache with longing. He had alwaysloved her long beautiful hair. He loved to watch her sleep almost as much as heloved to gaze into her arresting green eyes. He loved to make her hair a tangledmess.He remembered, back when he had first met her, watching her sleep on the floorof Adie’s home, watching her slow heartbeat in the vein in her neck. Heremembered, as he’d watched, being struck by the life in her. She was just soalive, so passionately filled with life. He couldn’t stop smiling as he lookedat her.Gently, he bent and kissed the top of her head. She stirred, nuzzling up tighterto him.Suddenly, she jerked upright, sitting on a hip as she stared wide-eyed at him.“Richard!”She threw herself down beside him, her head on his shoulder, her arm across hischest. She clutched him for dear life. A single gasp of a sob that terrified himwith its forlorn misery escaped her throat.“I’m all right,” he soothed as he smoothed her hair.She pushed herself up again, slower, gazing at him as if she hadn’t seen him inan eternity. Her special smile, the one she gave only him, spread incandescentacross her face.“Richard...” She seemed only able to stare at him and smile.Richard, still lying back trying to let his head clear, lifted an arm justenough to point. “Who is that?”Kahlan looked back over her shoulder. She turned back and took up Richard’shand.“Remember that fellow a week or so back? Owen? That’s him.”“I thought I recognized him.”“Lord Rahl!” Cara dropped to the ground on the side of him opposite Kahlan.“Lord Rahl...”She, too, seemed to have trouble finding words. Instead, she took up his freehand. That, in itself, said a world to him.Richard took the hand back, kissed his first two fingers and touched the fingersto her cheek.“Thanks for watching out for everyone.”Jennsen hobbled over, the blanket still tangled around her legs. “Richard! Theantidote worked! It worked, dear spirits, it worked!”Richard rose up onto an elbow. “Antidote?” He frowned at the three women aroundhim. “Antidote to what?”“You were poisoned,” Kahlan told him. She aimed a thumb back over her shoulder.“Owen. When he came to us the first time, you gave him a drink. In thanks, heput poison in your waterskin. He intended to poison me with it, too, but onlyyou drank it.”Richard’s glare settled on the men at Friedrich’s feet, watching them.He noddedhis confirmation that it was true, as if he should be commended for it.“One of those little mistakes,” Jennsen said.Richard puzzled at her. “What?”“You said that even you made mistakes, and even a little one could cause bigtrouble. Don’t you remember? Cara said you were always making mistakes,especially simple ones, and that’s why you need her around.” Jennsen flashed hima teasing smile. “I guess she was right.”Richard didn’t correct the story, but said, as he stood, “It just goes to showhow you can be taken by surprise by something as simple as that fellow overthere.”Kahlan was watching Owen. “I have a suspicion he isn’t so simple.”Cara put her arm out for Richard to grab hold of in order to steady himself.“Cara,” he said as he had to sit down on a nearby crate from the wagon, “bringhim over here, would you?”“Gladly,” she said as she started across their camp. “Don’t forget to tell himabout Owen,” Cara said to Kahlan.“Tell me what?”Kahlan leaned close as she watched Cara haul Owen to his feet. “Owen ispristinely ungifted—like Jennsen.”Richard raked his hair back, trying to make sense of it. “Are you saying thathe’s also my half brother?”Kahlan shrugged. “We don’t know that; we know only that he’s pristinelyungifted.” A wrinkle of puzzlement tightened on her brow. “By the way, back atthe camp where those men attacked us, you were about to tell me somethingimportant you figured out when we were questioning the man that I touched, butyou never got the chance.”“Yes”—Richard squinted, trying to recall what the man had told them—”it wasabout the one he said gave the orders sending him to capture us: Nicholas ...Nicholas something.”“The Slide,” Kahlan reminded him. “Nicholas the Slide.”“Right. Nicholas told him where to find us—at the eastern edge of the wasteland,heading north. How could he know?”Kahlan mulled over the question. “Come to think of it, how could he know? We’veseen no one, at least no one we were aware of, who could have reported where wewere. Even if someone had seen us, by the time they reported our position andNicholas sent the men, we would have been far from here. Unless Nicholas isclose.”“The races,” Richard said. “It has to be that he’s the one watching us throughthe races. We’ve seen no one else. That’s the only way anyone could have knownwhere we were. This Nicholas the Slide had to have seen us, to have seen wherewe were, through those birds that have been shadowing us. That’s how he was ableto give our location along with the orders.”Richard rose as the man approached.“Lord Rahl,” Owen said, arms spread in a gesture of relief as he scurriedforward, Cara holding a fistful of his coat at his shoulder to keep him reinedin. “I’m so relieved you’re better. I never meant for the poison to hurt you asit did—and it never would have, had you had the antidote sooner. I tried to getto you sooner—I meant to—I swear I did, but all those men you slaughtered... itwasn’t my fault.” He added a small smile to the pleading expression he gaveKahlan. “The Mother Confessor knows, she understands.”Kahlan folded her arms as she looked up at Richard from under her frown. “It’sour fault, you see, that Owen didn’t make it to us sooner with the antidote tothe poison. Owen got to our last camp, intending to hand over the antidote tocure you, only to find that we had murdered all those men and then up and left.So, it’s not his fault—his intentions were good and he tried; we spoiled hiseffort. Very inconsiderate of us.”Richard stared, not sure if Kahlan was giving him a sarcastic summation of whatOwen had told her, or an accurate portrayal of Owen’s excuse, or if his headstill wasn’t clear.Richard’s mood turned as dark as the thick overcast.“You poisoned me,” he said to Owen, wanting to be sure he had the man’s storystraight, “and then you brought an antidote to where we were camped, but whenyou got to that camp, you came across the men who had attacked us and you foundwe had gone.”“Yes.” His cheer that Richard had it right abruptly faded. “Such savagery fromthe unenlightened is to be expected, of course.” Owen’s blue eyes filled withtears. “But still, it was so...” He hugged himself and closed his eyes as herocked his weight from side to side, from one foot to the other. “Nothing isreal. Nothing is real. Nothing is real.”Richard seized the man’s shirt at his throat and yanked him closer. “What do youmean, nothing is real?”Owen paled before Richard’s glare. “Nothing is real. We can’t know if what wesee, if anything, is real or not. How could we?”“If you see it, then how can you possibly think it isn’t real?”“Because our senses all the time distort the truth of reality and deceive us.Our senses only delude us into the illusion of certainty. We can’t see atnight—our sight tells us that the night is empty—but an owl can snatch up amouse that with our eyes we couldn’t sense was there. Our reality says the mousedidn’t exist—yet we know it must, in spite of what our vision tells us—thatanother reality exists outside our experience. Our sight, rather than revealingtruth, hides the truth from us—worse, it gives us a false idea of reality.“Our senses deceived us. Dogs can smell a world of things we can’t, because oursenses are so limited. How can a dog track something we can’t smell, if oursenses tell us what is real and what isn’t. Our understanding of reality, ratherthan being enhanced by, is instead limited by, our flawed senses.“Our bias causes us to mistakenly think we know what is unknowable—don’t yousee? We aren’t equipped with adequate senses to know the true nature of reality,what is real and what isn’t. We only know a tiny sampling of the world aroundus. There is a whole world hidden from us, a whole world of mysteries we don’tsee—but it’s there just the same, whether we see it or not, whether we have thewisdom to admit our inadequacies to the task of knowing reality, or not. What wethink we know is actually unknowable. Nothing is real.”Richard leaned down. “You saw those bodies because they were real.”“What we see is only an apparent reality, mere appearances, a self-imposedillusion, all based on our flawed perception. Nothing is real.”“You didn’t like what you saw, so you choose, instead, to say it isn’t real?”“I can’t say what’s real. Neither can you. To say otherwise is unenlightenedarrogance. A truly enlightened man admits his woeful ineffectiveness whenconfronting his existence.”Richard pulled Owen closer. “Such whimsy can only bring you to a life of miseryand quaking fear, a life wasted and never really lived. You had better startusing your mind for its true purpose of knowing the world around you, instead ofabandoning it to faith in irrational notions. With me, you will confine yourselfto the facts of the world we live in, not fanciful daydreams as concocted byothers.”Jennsen tugged on Richard’s sleeve, pulling him back to hear her as shewhispered. “Richard, what if Owen is right—not necessarily about the bodies, butabout the general idea?”“You mean you think his conclusions are all wrong, and yet, somehow, theconvoluted idea behind them must be right.”“Well, no—but what if what he says really is true? After all, look at you andme. Remember the conversation we had a while back, the one where you wereexplaining how I was born without eyes to see”—she glanced briefly at Owen andapparently abbreviated what she had intended to say—”certain things. Rememberthat you said that, for me, such things don’t exist? That reality is differentfor me? That my reality is different than yours?”“You’re getting what I said wrong, Jennsen. When most people get into a patch ofpoison ivy, they blister and itch. Some rare people don’t. That doesn’t mean thepoison ivy doesn’t exist, or, more to the point, that its existence depends onwhether or not we think it’s there.”Jennsen pulled him even closer. “Are you so sure? Richard, you don’t know whatit’s like to be different from everyone else, to not see and feel what they do.You say there’s magic, but I can’t see it, or feel it. It doesn’t touch me. Am Ito believe you on faith, when my senses say it doesn’t exist? Maybe because ofthat I can understand a little better what Owen means. Maybe he doesn’t have itall wrong. It makes a person wonder what’s real and what’s not, and if, like hesays, it’s only your own point of view.”“The information our senses give us must be taken in context. If I close my eyesthe sun doesn’t stop shining. When I go to sleep I’m consciously unaware ofanything; that doesn’t mean that the world ceases to exist. You have to use theinformation from your senses in context along with what you’ve learned to betrue about the nature of things. Things don’t change because of the way we thinkabout them. What is, is.”“But, like he says, if we don’t experience something with our own senses, thenhow can we know it’s real?”Richard folded his arms. “I can’t get pregnant. So would you argue that for mewomen don’t exist.”Jennsen backed away, looking a little sheepish. “I guess not.”“Now,” Richard said, turning back to Owen, “you poisoned me—you admit thatmuch.” He tapped his fist against his own chest. “It hurts in here; that’s real.You caused it.“I want to know why, and I want to know why you brought the antidote. I’m notinterested in what you think of the camp where the men who attacked us lay dead.Confine yourself to the matter at hand. You brought the antidote for the poisonyou gave me. That can’t be the end of it. What’s the rest?”“Well,” Owen stammered, “I didn’t want you to die, that’s why I saved you.”“Stop telling me your feelings about what you did and tell me instead what youdid and why. Why poison me, and why then save me? I want the answer to that, andI want the truth.”Owen glanced around at the grim faces watching him. He took a breath as if togather his composure.“I needed your help. I had to convince you to help me. I asked, before, for yourhelp and you refused, even though my people have great need. I begged. I toldyou how important it was for them to have your help, but you still said no.”“I have my own problems I must deal with,” Richard said. “I’m sorry the Orderinvaded your homeland—I know how terrible that is—but I told you, I’m trying tobring them down and our doing so will only help you and your people in youreffort to rid yourselves of them. You aren’t the only one who has had their homeinvaded by those brutes. We have men of the Order murdering our loved ones aswell.”“You must help us, first,” Owen insisted. “You and those like you, theunenlightened ones, must free my people. We can’t do it ourselves—we are notsavages. I heard what you all had to say about eating meat. Such talk made meill. Our people are not like that—we can’t be, because we are enlightened. I sawhow you murdered all those men back there. I need you to do that to the Order.”“I thought that wasn’t real?”Owen ignored the question. “You must give my people freedom.”“I already told you, I can’t!”“Now, you must.” He looked at Cara, Jennsen, Tom, and Friedrich. His gazesettled on Kahlan. “You must see to it that Lord Rahl does this—or he will die.I have poisoned him.”Kahlan seized Owen’s shirt. “You brought him the antidote to the poison.”Owen nodded. “That first night, when I told you all of my great need, I had justgiven him the poison.” His gaze returned to Richard. “You had just drunk it,within hours. Had you agreed to give my people the freedom they need, I wouldhave given you the antidote then, and you would be free of the poison. It wouldhave cured you.“But you refused to come with me, to help those who cannot help themselves, asis your duty to those in need. You sent me away. So, I did not offer you theantidote. In the time since, the poison has worked its way through your body.Had you not been selfish, you would have been cured back then.“Instead, the poison is now established in you, doing its work. Since it was solong since you drank the poison, the antidote I had with me was no longer enoughto cure you, only to make you better for a while.”“And what will cure me?” Richard asked.“You will have to have more of the antidote to rid you of the rest of thepoison.”“And I don’t suppose you have any more.”Owen shook his head. “You must give my people freedom. Only then, will you beable to get more of the antidote.”Richard wanted to shake the answers out of the man. Instead, he took a breath,trying to stay calm so that he could understand the truth of what Owen had doneand then think of the solution.“Why only then?” he asked.“Because,” Owen said, “the antidote is in the place taken by the Imperial Order.You must rid us of the invaders if you are to be able to get to the antidote. Ifyou want to live, you must give us our freedom. If you don’t, you will die.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23Kahlan reached in to seize Owen by the throat. She wanted to strangle him, tochoke him, to make him feel the desperate, panicked need of breath that Richardhad endured, to make him suffer, to show him what it was like. Cara went forOwen as well, apparently having the same thought as Kahlan. Richard thrust hisarm out, holding them both back.Holding Owen’s shirt in his other fist, Richard shook the man. “And how long doI have until I get sick again? How long do I have to live before your poisonkills me?”Owen’s confused gaze flitted from one angry face to another. “But if you do as Iask, as is your duty, you will be fine. I promise. You saw that I brought youthe antidote. I don’t wish to harm you. That is not my intent—I swear.”Kahlan could only think of Richard in crushing pain, unable to breathe. It hadbeen terrifying. She couldn’t think of anything else but him going through itagain, only this time never to wake.“How long?” Richard repeated.“But if you only—”“How long!”Owen licked his lips. “Not a month. Close to it, but not a month, I believe.”Kahlan tried to push Richard away. “Let me have him. I’ll find out—”“No.” Cara pulled Kahlan back. “Mother Confessor,” she whispered, “let Lord Rahldo as he must. You don’t know what your touch would do to one such as he.”“It might do nothing,” Kahlan insisted, “but it might still work, and then wecan find out everything.”Cara restrained her with an arm around her waist that Kahlan could not pry off.“And if only the Subtractive side works and it kills him?”Kahlan stopped struggling as she frowned at Cara. “And since when have you takenup the study of magic?”“Since it might harm Lord Rahl.” Cara pulled Kahlan back farther away fromRichard. “I have a mind, too, you know. I can think things through. Are youusing your head? Where is this city? Where is the antidote within the city? Whatwill you do if using your power kills this man and you are the one who condemnsLord Rahl to death when you could have had the information we need had you nottouched him.“If you want, I will break his arms. I will make him bleed. I will make himscream in agony. But I will not kill him; I will keep him alive so that he cangive us the information we need to rid Lord Rahl of this death sentence.“Ask yourself, do you really want to do this because you believe it will gainyou the answers we need, or because you want to lash out, to strike out at him?Lord Rahl’s life may hang on you being truthful with yourself.”Kahlan panted from the effort of the struggle, but more from her rage. Shewanted to lash out, to strike back, just as Cara said—to do whatever she couldto save Richard and to punish his attacker.“I’ve had it with this game,” Kahlan said. “I want to hear the story—the wholestory.”“So do I,” Richard said. He lifted the man by his shirt and slammed him downatop the crate. “All right, Owen, no more excuses for why you did this or that.Start at the beginning and tell us what happened, and what you and your peopledid about it.”Owen sat trembling like a leaf. Jennsen urged Richard back.“You’re frightening him,” she whispered to Richard. “Give him some room or hewill never be able to get it out.”Richard took a purging breath as he acknowledged Jennsen’s words with a hand onher shoulder. He walked off a few paces, standing with his hands clasped behindhis back as he stared off in the direction of the sunrise, toward the mountainsKahlan had so often seen him studying. It had been on the other side of therange of the smaller, closer mountains, tight in the shadows of those massivepeaks thrusting up through the iron gray clouds, where they had found thewarning beacon and first encountered the black-tipped races.The clouds that capped the sky all the way to the wall of those distant peakshung heavy and dark. For the first time since Kahlan could remember, it lookedlike a storm might be upon them. The expectant smell of rain quickened the air.“Where are you from?” Richard asked in a calm voice.Owen cleared his throat as he straightened his shirt and light coat, as ifrearranging his dignity. He remained seated atop the crate.“I lived in a place of enlightenment, in a civilization of advanced culture ...a great empire.”“Where is this noble empire?” Richard asked, still staring off into thedistance.Owen stretched his neck up, looking east. He pointed at the far wall of toweringpeaks where Richard was looking.“There. Do you see that notch in the high mountains? I lived past there, in theempire beyond those mountains.”Kahlan remembered asking Richard if he thought they could make it over thosemountains. Richard had been doubtful about it.He looked back over his shoulder. “What’s the name of this empire?”“Bandakar,” Owen said in a reverent murmur. He smoothed his blond hair to theside, as if to make himself a respectable representative of his homeland. “I wasa citizen of Bandakar, of the Bandakaran Empire.”Richard had turned and was staring at Owen in a most peculiar manner. “Bandakar.Do you know what that name, Bandakar, means?”Owen nodded. “Yes. Bandakar is an ancient word from a time long forgotten. Itmeans ‘the chosen’—as in, the chosen empire.”Richard seemed to have lost a little of his color. When his eyes met Kahlan’s,she could see that he knew very well what the word meant, and Owen had it wrong.Richard seemed to suddenly remember himself. He rubbed his brow in thought. “Doyou—do any of your people—know the language that this ancient word, bandakar, isfrom?”Owen gestured dismissively. “We don’t know of the language; it’s long forgotten.Only the meaning of this word has been passed down, because it is so importantto our people to hold on to the heritage of its meaning: chosen empire. We arethe chosen people.”Richard’s demeanor had changed. His anger seemed to have faded away. He steppedcloser to Owen and spoke softly.“The Bandakaran Empire—why isn’t it known? Why does no one know of your people?”Owen looked away, toward the east, seeing his distant homeland through wet eyes.“It is said that the ancient ones, the ones who gave us this name, wanted toprotect us—because we are a special people. They took us to a place where no onecould go, because of the mountains all around. Such mountains as only theCreator could impose to close off the land beyond, so that we are protected.”“Except that one place”—Richard gestured east—”that notch in the mountain range,that pass.”“Yes,” Owen admitted, still staring off toward his homeland. “That was how weentered the land beyond, our land, but others could enter there as well; it wasthe one place where we were vulnerable. You see, we are an enlightened peoplewho have risen above violence, but the world is still full of savage races. So,those ancient people, who wanted our advanced culture to survive, to thrivewithout the brutality of the rest of the world ... they sealed the pass.”“And your people have been isolated for all this time—for thousands of years.”“Yes. We have a perfect land, a place of an advanced culture that is undisturbedby the violence of the people out here.”“How was the pass, the notch in the mountains, how was it sealed?”Owen looked at Richard, somewhat startled by the question. He thought it over amoment. “Well... the pass was sealed. It was a place that no one could enter.”“Because they would die if they entered this boundary.”With an icy wave of understanding, Kahlan suddenly understood what composed theseal to this empire.“Well, yes,” Owen stammered. “But it had to be that way to keep outsiders frominvading our empire. We reject violence unconditionally. It’s unenlightenedbehavior. Violence only invites ever more violence, spiraling into a cycle ofviolence with no end.” He fidgeted with the worry of such a trap catching themup in the allure of its wicked spell. “We are an advanced race, above theviolence of our ancestors. We have grown beyond. But without the boundary thatseals that pass and until the rest of the world rejects violence as we have, ourpeople could be the prey of unenlightened savages.”“And now, that seal is broken.”Owen stared at the ground, swallowing before he spoke. “Yes.”“How long ago did the boundary fail?”“We aren’t sure. It is a dangerous place. No one lives near it, so we can’t bepositive, but we believe it was close to two years ago.”Kahlan felt the dizzying burden of confirmation of her fears.When Owen looked up, he was a picture of misery. “Our empire is now naked tounenlightened savages.”“Sometime after the boundary came down, the Imperial Order came in through thepass.”“Yes.”“The land beyond those snowcapped mountains, the Empire of Bandakar, is wherethe black-tipped races are from, isn’t it?” Richard said.Owen looked up, surprised that Richard knew this. “Yes. Those awful creatures,innocent though they are of malice, prey on the people of my homeland. We muststay indoors at night, when they hunt. Even so, people, especially children, aresometimes surprised and caught by those fearsome creatures—”“Why don’t you kill them?” Cara asked, indignantly. “Fight them off? Shoot themwith arrows? Dear spirits, why don’t you bash their heads in with a rock if youhave to?”Owen looked shocked by the very suggestion. “I told you, we are above violence.It would be even more wrong to commit violence on such innocent creatures. It isour duty to preserve them, since it is we who entered into their domain. We arethe ones who bear the guilt because we entice them into such behavior which isonly natural to them. We preserve virtue only by embracing every aspect of theworld without the prejudice of our flawed human views.”Richard gave Cara a stealthy gesture to be quiet. “Was everyone in the empirepeaceful?” he asked, pulling Owen’s attention away from Cara.“Yes.”“Weren’t there occasionally those who... I don’t know, misbehaved? Children, forexample. Where I come from, children can sometimes become rowdy. Children whereyou come from must sometimes become rowdy, too.”Owen shrugged a bit with one shoulder. “Well, yes, I guess so. There were timeswhen children misbehave and become unruly.”“And what do you do with such children?”Owen cleared his throat, plainly uncomfortable. “Well, they are... put out oftheir home for a time.”“Put out of their home for a time,” Richard repeated. He lifted his arms in aquestioning shrug. “The children I know will usually be happy to be put outside.They simply go play.”Owen shook his head emphatically at the serious nature of the matter. “We aredifferent. From the time we are born, we are together with others. We are allvery close. We depend on one another. We cherish one another. We spend all ourwaking hours with others. We cook and wash and work together. We sleep in asleeping house, together. Ours is an enlightened life of human contact, humancloseness. There is no higher value than being together.”“So,” Richard asked, feigning a puzzled look, “when one of you—a child—is putout, that is a cause of unhappiness?”Owen swallowed as a tear ran down his cheek. “There could be nothing worse. Tobe put out, to be closed off from others, is the worst horror we can endure. Tobe forced out into the cold cruelty of the world is a nightmare.”Just talking about such a punishment, thinking about it, was making Owen startto tremble.“And that’s when, sometimes, the races get such children,” Richard said in acompassionate tone. “When they’re alone and vulnerable.”With the back of his hand Owen wiped the tear from his cheek. “When a child mustbe put out to be punished, we take all possible precautions. We never put themout at night because that is when the races usually hunt. Children are put outfor punishment only in the day. But when we are away from others, we arevulnerable to all the terrors and cruelties of the world. To be alone is anightmare.“We would do anything to avoid such punishment. Any child who misbehaves and isput out for a while will not likely misbehave again anytime soon. There is nogreater joy than to finally be welcomed back in with our friends and family.”“So, for your people, banishment is the greatest punishment.”Owen stared into the distance. “Of course.”“Where I come from, we all got along pretty well, too. We enjoyed each other’scompany and had great fun when many people would gather. We valued our timestogether. When we’re away for a time, we inquire about all the people we knowand haven’t seen in a while.”Owen smiled expectantly. “Then you understand.”Richard nodded, returning the smile. “But occasionally there will be someone whowon’t behave, even when they’re an adult. We try everything we can, but,sometimes, someone does something wrong—something they know is wrong. They mightlie or steal. Even worse, at times someone will deliberately hurt anotherperson—beat someone when robbing them, or rape a woman, or even murder someone.”Owen wouldn’t look up at Richard. He stared at the ground.As he spoke, Richard paced slowly before the man. “When someone does somethinglike that where you come from, Owen, what do your people do? How do anenlightened people handle such horrible crimes some of your people commitagainst others?”“We attack the root cause of such behavior from the beginning,” Owen was quickto answer. “We share all we have to make sure that everyone has what they needso that they don’t have to steal. People steal because they feel the hurt ofothers acting superior. We show these people that we are no better than they andso they need not harbor such fears of others. We teach them to be enlightenedand reject all such behavior.”Richard shrugged nonchalantly. Kahlan would have thought that he would be readyto strangle the answers out of Owen, but, instead, he was behaving in a calm,understanding manner. She had seen him act this way before. He was the Seeker ofTruth, rightfully named by the First Wizard himself. Richard was doing whatSeekers did: find the truth. Sometimes he used his sword, sometimes words.Even though this was the way Richard often disarmed people when he questionedthem, in this case it struck Kahlan that such a manner was precisely what Owenwould be most accustomed to, most comfortable with. This gentle manner waspulling answers from the man and filling in a lot of information Kahlan hadnever thought of trying to get.She had already learned that she was the cause of what had befallen thesepeople.“We both know, Owen, that, try as we might, such efforts to change people’s waysdon’t always work. Some people won’t change. There are times when people do evilthings. Even among civilized people, there are some who will not behave in acivil manner despite all your best efforts. What’s worse is that, if allowed tocontinue, these few jeopardize the whole community.“After all, if you have a rapist among you, you can’t allow him to continue toprey on women. If a man committed murder, you couldn’t allow such a man tothreaten the empire with his ways, now could you? An advanced culture,especially, can’t be faulted for wanting to stop such dangers to enlightenedpeople.“But you’ve shunned all forms of violence, so you can hardly punish such a manphysically—you couldn’t put a murderer to death—not if you’ve truly rejectedviolence unconditionally. What do you do with such men? How does an enlightenedpeople handle grave problems, such as murder?”Owen was sweating. It seemed not to have occurred to him to deny the existenceof murderers—Richard had already led him past that, had already established theexistence of such men. Before Owen could think to object, Richard was alreadybeyond, to the next step.“Well,” Owen said, swallowing, “as you say, we are an enlightened people. Ifsomeone does something to harm another, they are given ... a denunciation.”“A denunciation. You mean, you condemn their actions, but not the man. You givehim a second chance.”“Yes, that’s right.” Owen wiped sweat from his brow as he glanced up at Richard.“We work very hard to reform people who make such mistakes and are given adenunciation. We recognize that their actions are a cry for help, so we counselthem in the ways of enlightenment in order to help them to see that they arehurting all our people when they hurt one, and that since they are one of ourbeloved people, they are only hurting themselves when they hurt another. We showsuch people compassion and understanding.”Kahlan caught Cara’s arm, and with a stern look convinced her to remain silent.Richard paced slowly before Owen, nodding as if he thought that soundedreasonable. “I understand. You put a great deal of effort into making them seethat they can never do such a thing again.”Owen nodded, relieved that Richard understood.“But then there are times when one of those who has received a denunciation, andhas been counseled to the very best of your ability, goes out and does the samecrime again—or one even worse.“It’s clear, then, that he refuses to be reformed and that he’s a threat topublic order, safety, and confidence. Left to his own devises, such a person, byhimself, will bring the very thing you unconditionally reject—violence—to stalkamong your people and win others to his ways.”A light mist had begun to fall. Owen sat on the crate, trembling, frightened,alone. Only a short time ago he had been reluctant to answer even the most basicquestion in a meaningful way; now Richard had him speaking openly.Friedrich stroked the jaw of one of the horses as he quietly watched. Jennsensat on a rock, Betty lying at her feet. Tom stood behind Jennsen, a hand restinggently on her shoulder, but keeping an eye on the man Kahlan had touched withher power. That man sat off to the side, listening dispassionately as he waitedto be commanded. Cara stood beside Kahlan, ever watchful for trouble, butobviously caught up in the unfolding story of Owen’s homeland, even if she washaving a hard time holding her tongue.For her part, Kahlan, while she could sympathize with Cara’s difficulty inholding her tongue, was transfixed by the tale of a mysterious empire thatRichard casually, effortlessly, drew from this man who had poisoned him. Shecouldn’t imagine where Richard was going with his matter-of-fact questions. Whatdid this empire’s forms of punishment have to do with Richard being poisoned? Itwas clear to her, though, that Richard knew where he was headed, and that thepath he was following was wide and sunlit.Richard paused before Owen. “What do you do in those instances?—when you can’treform someone who has become a danger to everyone. What do an enlightenedpeople do with that kind of person?”Owen spoke in a soft voice that carried clearly in the misty early-morning hush.“We banish them.”“Banish them. You mean, you send them into the boundary?”Owen nodded.“But you said that going into the boundary is death. You couldn’t simply sendthem into the boundary or you would be executing them. You must have a place tosend them through. A special place. A place where you can banish them, withoutkilling them, but a place where you know they can never return to harm yourpeople.”Owen nodded again. “Yes. There is such a place. The pass that is blocked by theboundary is steep and treacherous. But there is a path that leads down into theboundary. Those ancient ones who protected us by placing that boundary placedthe path as well. The path is said to allow passage out. Because of the way themountain descends, it is a difficult path, but it can be followed.”“And just because of how difficult it is, it’s not possible to climb back up? Toenter the Bandakaran Empire?”Owen chewed his lower lip. “It goes down through a terrible place, a narrowpassageway through the boundary, a lifeless land, where it is said that deathitself lies to each side. The person banished is given no water or food. He mustfind his own, on the other side, or perish. We place watchers at the entrance ofthe path, where they wait to be sure that the one banished has gone through andis not lingering in the boundary only to return. The watchers wait and watch forseveral weeks to be sure that the one banished has gone beyond in search ofwater and food, in search of his new life away from his people.“Once beyond, the forest is a terrible place, a frightening place, with rootsthat descend over the edge like a land of snakes. The path takes you down underthat cascade of roots and running water. Then, even lower, you find yourself ina strange land where the trees are far above, reaching for the distant light,but you see only their roots twisting and stretching down into the darknesstoward the ground. It is said that once you see that forest of roots toweringall around you, you have made it through the boundary and the pass through themountains.“There is said to be no way to enter our land from that other side—to use thepass to return to our empire.“Once banished, there is no redemption.”Richard moved up close beside Owen and placed a hand on his shoulder.“What did you do to be banished, Owen?”Owen sank forward, putting his face in his hands as he finally broke downsobbing."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24Richard left his hand on Owen’s shoulder as he spoke in a compassionate tone.“Tell me what happened, Owen. Tell me in your own way.”Kahlan was startled to hear, after all Owen had said, that he had become one ofthe banished. She saw Jennsen’s jaw fall open. Cara lifted an eyebrow.Kahlan could see that Richard’s hand on Owen’s shoulder was an emotionallifeline for the man. He finally sat up, sniffling back the tears. He wiped hisnose on his sleeve.He looked up at Richard. “Should I tell you the whole story? All of it?”“Yes. I’d like to hear it all, from the beginning.”Kahlan was struck at how much Richard reminded her, at that moment, of hisgrandfather, Zedd, and the way Zedd always wanted to hear the whole story.“Well, I was happy among my people, with them all around me. They held me totheir breast when I was young. I was always safe in their welcoming arms. WhileI knew of other children who became unruly and were put out as punishment, Inever did anything to be put out. I hungered to learn to be like my people. Theytaught me the ways of enlightenment. For a time I served my people as the WiseOne.“Later, my people were pleased with how enlightened I was, how I embraced themall, and so they made me the speaker of our town. I traveled to nearby towns tospeak the words of what the people of my town all believed as one. I went to ourgreat cities for the same reason. I was always happiest, though, when I was homewith my closest people.“I fell in love with a woman from my town. Her name is Marilee.”Owen stared off into his memories. Richard didn’t rush him, but waited patientlyuntil he began again at his own pace.“It was spring, a little more than two years ago, when we fell joyfully in love.Marilee and I spent time talking, holding hands, and, when we could, sittingtogether while among all the others. Among all the others, though, I only hadeyes for Marilee. She only had eyes for me.“When we were with others, it felt like we were alone in the world, Marilee andI, and the world belonged to us alone, that only we had the eyes to see all itshidden beauty. It is wrong to feel this way, to be so alone in our hearts is tobe selfish and to think our eyes can see so clearly is sinful pride, but wecould not help ourselves. The trees blossomed just for us. The water in thestreams burbled their music just for us. The moon rose for us alone.” Owenslowly shook his head. “You could not understand how it was ... how we felt.”“I understand quite well how it was,” Richard assured him in a quiet voice.Owen glanced up at Richard; then his gaze moved to Kahlan. She nodded to himthat it was so. His brow twitched with wonder. He looked away then, perhaps,Kahlan thought, in guilt.“Well,” Owen said, going back to his story, “I was the speaker of our town—theone who speaks what all decide that must be decided as being true. I alsosometimes helped other people resolve questions of what is right according tothe tenets of an advanced culture.” Owen flicked his hand in a self-consciousmanner. “As I said, I once served my people as the Wise One, so the peopletrusted me.”Richard just nodded, not interrupting, even though Kahlan knew that he didn’tquite understand the meaning of many of the details of what Owen was saying anymore than she did. The gist of the story, though, was becoming all too clear.“I asked Marilee if she would be my wife, if she would marry me and no other.She said that it was the happiest day of her life, to be asked by me, for I saidI wanted no other but her. It was the happiest day of my life when she said shewould have me as her husband.“Everyone was very pleased. Everyone loved us both, and kept us sheltered intheir arms for a long time to show their joy. As we sat together with everyone,we all talked about the plans for the wedding and how much we would all bepleased that Marilee and I would be husband and wife and bring children amongour people.”Owen stared off in his thoughts. It seemed that he might have forgotten thathe’d stopped speaking.“So, was it a grand wedding?” Richard finally prompted.Owen still stared off. “The men of the Order came. That was when we firstrealized that the seal, that had protected our people since the beginning times,had failed. There was no longer a barrier protecting us.“Our empire was now naked to savages.”Kahlan knew that what she had done had caused the boundary to fail, resulting inthese people being defenseless. She had had no choice, but that didn’t make itany easier to hear.“They came to our town, where I was speaker. Our town, like others, has wallsall around; those who gave us our name, Bandakar, proclaimed that towns shouldbe built such as this. It was wise of them to tell us this. The walls protect usfrom the beasts of the forests, make us safe, without having to harm anycreatures.“The men of the Order set up a camp outside our walls. There was really no placefor them to stay in the town—we have no accommodations to house so many peoplebecause we never have great numbers of visitors from other towns. Worse, I wasfearful of having such men as they looked sleeping under our roof with us. Itwas wrong to have such fear; it is my failing, not theirs, I know, but I had thefear.“Since I was the speaker for my town, I went out to their camp with food andofferings. I was filled with my sinful failing of being afraid of them. Theywere big, some with long, dark, greasy, tangled hair, some with shaved heads,many with filthy beards of coarse hair—none of them with fair sun-golden hairlike our people. It was shocking to see them wearing hides of animals, leatherplates, chains and metal, and straps with sharp studs. Hanging on their belts,they all carried vicious-looking implements the likes of which I had never in mylife imagined, but which I later learned were weapons.“I told these strange men that they were welcome to share what we had, that wewould honor them. I told them that they were invited to sit with us, to sharetheir words with us.”Everyone waited in silence, not wanting to say a word as tears ran down Owen’sface and dripped off his jaw.“The men of the Order did not sit with us. They did not share their words withus. Though I spoke to them, they acted as if I were not worthy of theirrecognition, other than to grin at me as if they intended to eat me.“I sought to allay their fears, since it is the fear of others that causeshostility. I assured the men that we were peaceful and intended them no illwill. I told them that we would do our best to accommodate them among us.“The man who was their speaker, a commander he called himself, spoke to me then.He told me that his name was Luchan. His shoulders were twice as wide as mine,even though he was no taller than me. This man, Luchan, said that he did notbelieve me. I was horrified to hear this. He said that he thought my peoplemeant him harm. He accused us of wishing to kill his men. I was shaken that hewould think such a thing of us, especially after I had told him of our openwelcome to his men. I was shaken to know that I had done something to cause himto feel we were threatening to him and his men. I assured him of our desire tobe peaceful with them.“Luchan smiled at me then, not a smile of happiness, not a smile like I had everseen before. He said that they were going to burn down our town and kill all thepeople in it to prevent us from attacking his men as they slept. I begged him tobelieve our peaceful ways, to sit with us and share his worries and we would dowhat we needed to do to dispel such doubts and show him our love of him forbeing our fellow man.“Luchan said, then, that he would not burn down our town and kill us all upon acondition, as he called it. He said that if I would surrender my woman to him asa token of my sincerity and goodwill he would then believe our words. He saidthat if, on the other hand, I failed to send her out to him, what happened wouldbe my fault, would be on my head, for not cooperating with them, for not showingmy sincerity and goodwill toward them.“I went back to hear the words of my people. Everyone agreed and said that Imust do this—that I must send Marilee out to the men of the Order so that theywould not burn down our town and murder everyone. I asked them not to decide soquickly, and offered the idea that we could close the gates in the wall to keepthe men from coming in and harming us. My people said that men such as thesewould find a way to break the wall, and then they would murder everyone forshutting our gates and shaming them with our bigotry toward them. The people allspoke up loudly that I must show the man Luchan goodwill and our peacefulintent, that I must allay his fears of us.“I never felt so alone among my people. I could not go against the word ofeveryone, for it is taught that only the voices of people joined together in onevoice can be wise enough to know the true way. No one person can know what isright. Only consensus can make a thing right.“My knees trembled as I stood before Marilee. I heard myself ask if she wishedme to do as the men wanted—as our people wanted. I told her that I would runaway with her if she would wish it. She wept as she said that she would not hearsuch sinful talk from me, for it would mean the death of everyone else.“She said that she must go to the men of the Order to appease them or therewould be violence. She told me that she would tell them of our peaceful ways andthus gentle them toward us.“I was proud of Marilee for upholding the highest values of our people. I wantedto die for being proud of such a thing as would take her from me.“I kissed Marilee a last time, but I could not stop my tears. I held her in myarms and we wept together.“Then, I took her out to the man who was their commander, Luchan. He had a thickblack beard, a shaved head, and a ring through one ear and one nostril. He saidthat I had made a wise choice. His sundarkened arms were nearly as big around asMarilee’s waist. His big filthy hand took Marilee by her arm and bore her awaywith him as he turned back and told me to ‘scurry back’ to my town, to mypeople. His men laughed at me as they watched me go back up the road.“The men of the Order left my town and my people alone. We had peace I hadpurchased with Marilee.“I had no peace in my heart.“For a time, the men of the Order were gone from our town. They returned, then,one afternoon, and called for me to come out. I asked Luchan about Marilee, ifshe was well, if she was happy. Luchan turned his head and spat, then said hedidn’t know, that he never asked her. I was worried, and asked if she spoke withhim of our peaceful ways, assured him of our innocent intent toward him. He saidthat when he was with women he wasn’t much interested in them for their talking.“He winked at me. Though I had never seen anyone wink in such a fashion, I knewhis meaning.“I was very frightened for Marilee, but I reminded myself that nothing is real,that I could not really know anything from what I was hearing. I was onlyhearing what this one man said of things, as he saw them, and I knew that I wasonly sensing part of the world. I could not know reality from my eyes and earsalone.“Luchan said, then, that I should open the town gates lest they think we wereacting in a hostile way toward them. Luchan said that if we failed to do as heasked, it would begin a cycle of violence.“I went back and spoke his words to all the people gathered around me. My peopleall spoke in one voice, and said that we must open the gates and invite them into prove that we held no hostility, no prejudice, toward the men.“The men of the Order came in through those gates we let stand wide for them andseized nearly all the women, from those still the age of girls to grandmothers.I stood with the other men, begging them to leave our women be, to leave us be.I told them that we had agreed to their demands to prove to them that we meantthem no harm, but it did no good. They would not listen.“I told Luchan, then, that I had sent Marilee to him as his condition for peace.I told him that they must honor their agreement. Luchan and his men laughed.“I cannot say if what I saw then was real. Reality is in the realm of fate, andwe, in this place we think we know as the world, cannot know it in full truth.That day, fate swept down on my people; we had no say in it. We know that wemust not fight against fate, for it has already been foreordained by the truereality we cannot see.“I watched as our women were dragged away. I watched, unable to do anything, asthey screamed our names, as they reached out for us, as the hands of those bigmen held our women and bore them away from us. I had never heard such screams asI heard that day.”The overcast seemed as if it would soon brush the tops of the trees. In thethick silence, Kahlan heard a bird in the bristlecone pines singing. Owen wasalone, off in his solitary world of terrible memories. Richard stood, armsfolded, watching the man, but saying nothing.“I went to other towns,” Owen finally said. “In a couple of places, the Orderhad been there before me. The men of the Order did much the same to those townsas they had done to my town; they took the women. In some places they also tooka few men.“In other places I went, the Order had not come yet. As the speaker of my town,I told them of what had befallen my town and I urged others to do something.They were angry with me and said it was wrong to resist, that to resist was togive in to violence, to become no better than the savages. They urged me torenounce my outspoken ways and to heed the wisdom of the joined voices of ourpeople that had brought enlightenment and thousands of years of peace. They toldme that I was only looking at events through my limited eyes, and not the betterjudgment of the group.“I went then to one of our important cities and told them again that the seal onthe pass was broken and that the Imperial Order was upon us, and that somethingmust be done. I urged them to listen to me and to consider what we could do toprotect our people.“Because I was so inconsiderately assertive, the assembly of speakers took me tothe Wise One so that I might have his counsel. It is a great honor to have thewords of the Wise One. The Wise One told me that I must forgive those who haddone these things against my people, if we were to end the violence.“The Wise One said that the anger and hostility shown by the men of the Orderwas a mark of their inner pain, a cry for help, and they must be showncompassion and understanding. I should have been humbled by such clear wisdom ascould only come from the Wise One, but instead I spoke out of my wish forMarilee and all the other people to be returned from such men, and for thespeakers to help me in this.“The Wise One said that Marilee would find her own happiness without me and thatI was guilty of selfishness for wanting to keep her for myself. He said thatfate had come for the other people and it was not my place to make demands offate.“I asserted to the speakers and the Wise One that the men of the Order had notupheld the agreement made by Luchan for Marilee to be sent to them. The Wise Onesaid that Marilee had acted properly by going in peace to the men so that thecycle of violence would end. He said that it was selfish and sinful for me toput my wants above peace she selflessly worked toward and that my attitudetoward them was probably what had provoked the men to anger.“I asked what I was to do, when I had acted honestly but they had not. The WiseOne said that I was wrong to condemn men I did not know, men I had not firstforgiven, or tried to embrace, or even to understand. He said that I mustencourage them in the ways of peace by throwing myself before them and beggingthem to forgive me for acting in a way that kindled their inner pain byreminding them of past wrongs done to them.“I told the Wise One, then, in front of all the other speakers, that I did notwant to forgive these men or to embrace these men, but that I wanted to castthem out of our lives.“I was given a denunciation.”Richard handed Owen a cup of water but said nothing. Owen sipped at the waterwithout seeing it.“The gathering of speakers commanded me to go back to my town and seek theadvice of those among whom I lived, commanding that I ask my people to counselme back to our ways. I went back intending to redeem myself, only to discoverthat it had become worse than before.“Now, the Order had returned to take whatever they wanted from the town—food andgoods. We would have given them whatever they wanted, but they never asked, theyjust took. More of our men had been taken away, too—some of the boys and some ofthose who were young and strong. Other men, who had in some way offended thedignity of the men of the Order, had been murdered.“People I knew stood staring with empty eyes at blood where our friends haddied. In other such places, people gathered to mound remembrances over theblood. These places had become sacred shrines and people knelt there to pray.The children would not stop crying. No one would counsel me.“Everyone in my town trembled behind doors, but they cast their eyes down andopened those doors when the men of the Order knocked, lest we offend them.“I could not stand to be in our town any longer. I ran to the country, eventhough I was terrified that I would be alone. There, in the hills, I found othermen, selfish as I, hiding in fear for their lives. Together, we decided to tryto do something, to try to bring an end to the misery. We resolved to restorepeace.“At first, we sent representatives to speak with the men of the Order, to letthem know that we meant them no harm, and that we only sought peace with them,and to ask what we could do to satisfy them. The men of the Order hung these menby their ankles from poles at the edge of our town and skinned them alive.“I knew these men all my life, these men who had counseled me, advised me,broken fasts with me, sheltered me in their arms with joy when I had told themMarilee and I wanted to be wed. The men of the Order left these poor men to hangby their ankles as they screamed in agony in the hot summer sun, where theblack-tipped races came and found them.“I reminded myself that what I saw that day was not real, and that I should notbelieve such sights, that possibly my eyes were deceiving me as punishment forhaving improper thoughts, and that my mind could not possibly know if this sightwas real or an illusion.“Not every man that had gone to speak with the men of the Order was killed. Afew of our men were sent back to us with word from the Order. They said that ifwe did not come down out of the hills and return to their rule in our town, toshow that we did not intend to attack them, then they would begin skinning adozen people a day, and hanging them on poles for the races, until either wereturned to demonstrate our peaceful intent, or until every last person left inthe town was skinned alive.“Many of our men wept, unable to stand to think that they would be the cause ofa cycle of violence, so they went back to the town to show that they intended noharm.“Not all of us went back. A few of us remained in the hills. Since mostreturned, and the Order had no count of us, they thought all had complied withtheir command.“Those few of us who were left in the hills hid, living off the nuts, fruits,and berries we could find or the food we snuck back and stole. We slowlygathered together supplies to see us through. I told the other men with me thatwe should find out what the Order was doing with our people they had taken away.Since the men of the Order didn’t know us, we could sometimes mingle in withpeople working the fields or tending to animals and sneak back into our townwithout the Order knowing who we were—without knowing that we were men from thehills. Over the next months, we followed and watched the men of the Order.“The children had been sent away, but the men of the Order had taken all thewomen to a place they built—an encampment, they called it—that they fortifiedagainst attack.”Owen put his face in his hands again as he spoke through sobs. “They were usingour women as breeding stock. They sought to have them bear children—as manychildren as they could birth—children of their soldiers. Some women were alreadypregnant. Most of those who weren’t already pregnant became pregnant. Over thenext year and a half, many children were born. They were nursed for a time, andthen they were all sent away as their mothers were gotten pregnant again.“I don’t know where these children were taken—somewhere beyond our empire. Themen who had been taken from the towns were also taken away beyond our empire.“The men of the Order did not watch their captives well, since our peopleshunned violence, so a couple of men escaped and ran to the hills, where theyfound us. They told us that the Order had taken them to see the women, and toldthem that if they did not do as they were told, if they did not follow all theorders they were given, then all these women before them would die—that theywould be skinned alive. These men who escaped did not know where they were to betaken, or what it was they were to do, only that if they did not follow theinstructions given them, then they would be the cause of the violence to ourwomen.“After a year and a half of hiding, of meeting with others, we learned that theOrder had spread to other places in our empire, taken other towns and cities.The Wise One and the speakers went into hiding. We discovered that some townsand cities had invited the Order to come in, to be among them, in an attempt toappease them and keep them from doing harm.“No matter how hard our people tried, their concessions failed to placate thebelligerence of the men of the Order. We could not understand why this was true.“In some of the largest cities, though, it was different. The people there hadlistened to the speakers of the Order and had come to believe that the cause ofthe Imperial Order was the same as our cause—to bring an end to abuse andinjustice. The Order convinced these people that they abhorred violence, thatthey had been enlightened as were our people, but they had to turn to violenceto defeat those who would oppress us all. They said that they were champions ofour people’s cause of enlightenment. The people there rejoiced that they were atlast in the hands of saviors who would spread our words of enlightenment to thesavages who did not yet live by peace.”Richard, a thunderstorm building, could hold his tongue no longer. “And evenafter all the brutality, these people believed the words of the Imperial Order?”Owen spread his hands. “The people in those places were swayed by the words ofthe Order—that they were fighting for the same ideals as we lived by. They toldour people in those cities that they had only acted as they did because my townand some of the other places like it had sided with the savages from thenorth—with the D’Haran Empire.“I had heard this name before—the D’Haran Empire. During the year and a halfthat I lived in the hills with the other men, I sometimes traveled out of ourland, out into the surrounding places, to see what I could discover that mighthelp us to cast the Imperial Order out of Bandakar. While I was out of my land,I went to some of the cities in the Old World, as I learned it was called. Inone place, Altur’Rang, I heard whispers of a great man from the north, from theD’Haran Empire, who brought freedom.“Other of my men also went out to other places. When we returned, we all toldeach other what we had seen, what we had heard. All those who came back told ofthe same thing, told of hearing of one called Lord Rahl, and his wife, theMother Confessor, who fought the Imperial Order.“Then, we learned where the Wise One was being kept safe, as were most of ourgreatest speakers. It was in our greatest city, a place where the Order had notyet come. The Order was busy with other places and so they were in no hurry. Mypeople were going nowhere—they had nowhere to go.“The men who were with me wanted me to be their speaker, to go to talk withthese great speakers, to convince them that we must do something to stop theImperial Order and cast them out of Bandakar.“I journeyed to the great city, a place I had never been before, and I wasinspired at seeing a place that such a great culture as ours had built. Aculture about to be destroyed, if I could not convince these great speakers andthe Wise One to think of something to do to stop the Order.“I spoke before them with great urgency. I told them of all the Order had done.I told them of the men I had in hiding, waiting for word of what they were todo.“The great speakers said that I cannot know the true nature of the Order fromwhat I and a few men had seen—that the Imperial Order was a vast nation and wesaw only a tiny speck of their people. They said that men cannot do such cruelacts as I described because it would cause them to shrink back in horror beforethey could complete them. To prove it, they suggested that I try to skin one ofthem. I admitted that I could not, but I told them that I had seen the men ofthe Order do this.“The speakers scorned my insistence that it was real. They said I must alwayskeep in mind that reality is not for us to know. They said that the men of theImperial Order were probably frightened that we might be a violent people, andsimply wanted to test our resolve by tricking us into believing that the thingsI described were real so that they could see how we reacted—if peace was reallyour way, or if we would attack them.“The great speakers said, then, that I could not know if I really saw all thethings I said, and that even if I did, I could not judge if they were for thebad, or the good—that I was not the person to judge the reasons of men I did notknow, that to do so would be to believe that I was above them, and to put myselfabove them would be an act of prejudiced hostility.“I could only think of all the things I had seen, of the men with me who allagreed that we must convince the great speakers to act to preserve our empire. Icould only see in my mind the face of Luchan. And then, I thought of Marilee inthe hands of this man. I thought of the sacrifice she had made, and how her lifewas cast away into this horror for nothing.“I stood up before the great speakers and screamed that they were evil.”Cara snorted a laugh. “Seems you can tell what’s real, when you put your mind toit.”Richard shot her a withering glare.Owen glanced up and blinked. His thoughts had been so distant as he told hisstory that he hadn’t really heard her. He looked up at Richard.“That was when they banished me,” he said.“But the boundary seal had failed,” Richard said. “You had already come and gonethrough the pass. How could they enforce a banishment with the boundary down?”Owen waved dismissively. “They do not need the wall of death. Banishment is in away a sentence of death—the death of the person as a citizen of Bandakar. Myname would be known throughout the empire, at least what was left of it, andevery person would shun me. I would be turned away from every door. I was one ofthe banished. No one would want to have any contact with me. I was now anoutcast. It does not matter that they could not put me beyond the barrier; theyput me beyond my people. That was worse.“I went back to my men in the hills to collect my things and confess to themthat I had been banished. I was going to go out beyond our homeland, as I hadbeen commanded by the will of our people through our great speakers.“But my men, those in the hills, they would not see me go. They said that thebanishment was wrong. These men had seen the things I had seen. They had wives,mothers, daughters, sisters who had been taken away. They all had seen theirfriends murdered, seen the men skinned alive and left to suffer in agony as theydied, seen the races come to circle over them as they hung on those poles. Theysaid that since all our eyes had seen these things, then these things must betrue, must be real.“They all said that we had gone into the hills because we love our land and wantto restore the peace we once had. They said that the great speakers were theones whose eyes did not see and they were condemning our people to murder at thehands of savage men and those of our people who lived to a cruel life under therule of the Imperial Order, to be used as breeding stock or as slaves.“I was shocked that these men would not reject me for being banished—that theywanted me to stay with them.“It was then that we decided that we would be the ones to do something, to comeup with the plan we always wanted the speakers to decide. When I asked whatwould be our plan, everyone said the same thing.“They all said that we must get Lord Rahl to come and give us freedom. They allspoke with one voice.“We decided, then, what we would do. Some men said that one such as the LordRahl would come to cast out the Order when we asked.Others thought you might not be willing, since you are unenlightened and not ofour ways, not of our people. When we considered that possibility, we decidedthat we must have a way to insure you would have to come, should you refuse us.“Since I was banished, I said that it was upon me to do this thing. Except tolive in the hills with my men, I could have no life among our people unless wecast out the Imperial Order and our ways were restored to us. I told the menthat I did not know where I could find the Lord Rahl, but that I would not giveup until I did so.“First, though, one of the men, an older man who had spent his life working withherbs and cures, made me the poison I put into your waterskin. He made me theantidote as well. He told me how the poison worked, and how it could becounteracted, since none of us wished to consider that it would come to murder,even of an unenlightened man.”By the sidelong look Richard gave her, Kahlan knew that he wanted her to holdher tongue, and knew that she was having difficulty doing so. She redoubled hereffort.“I was worried about how I would find you,” Owen said to Richard, “but I knew Ihad to. Before I could go in search of you, though, I had to hide the rest ofthe antidote, as was our plan.“While in a city where the Order had won the people to their side, I heard somepeople at a market say that it was a great honor that the very man who had cometo their city was the most important man among all those of the Imperial Orderin Bandakar. The thought struck me that this man might know something of the manthe Order hated most—Lord Rahl.“I stayed in the city for several days, watching the place where this man wassaid to be. I watched the soldiers come and go. I saw that they sometimes tookpeople in with them, and then later the people came back out.“One day I saw people come back out and they did not appear to be harmed, so Imade my way close to them to hear what they might say. I heard them talk thatthey had seen the great man himself. I could not hear much of what they said oftheir visit inside, but none said that they were hurt.“And then I saw the soldiers come out, and I suspected that they might be goingto get more people to take them in to see this great man, so I went before theminto a central gathering square. I waited, then, near the open isles between thepublic benches. The soldiers rushed in and gathered up a small crowd of peopleand I was swept up with the others.“I was terrified of what would happen to me, but I thought this might be my onlychance to go in the building with this important man, my only chance to see whathe looked like, to see the place where he was so I could know where to sneakback and listen, as I had learned to do when living in the hills with my men. Ihad resolved to do this to see if I could learn any information on Lord Rahl.Still, I was trembling with worry when they took us all into the building anddown halls and up stairs to the top floor.“I feared that I was being led to the slaughter and wanted to run, but Ithought, then, of my men back in the hills, depending on me to find the LordRahl and get him to come to Bandakar and give us freedom.“We were taken through a heavy door into a dim room that filled me with fearbecause it stank of blood. The windows on two walls of the stark room wereclosed off by shutters. I saw that across the room there was a table with abroad bowl and, nearby, a row of fat, sharpened wooden stakes standing nearly astall as my chest. They were stained dark with blood and gore.“Two women and a man with us fainted. Out of anger, the soldiers kicked them inthe heads. When the people did not rise, the soldiers dragged them away by theirarms. I saw blood trails smear along the floor behind them. I didn’t want tohave my head caved in by the boot of one of these gruesome men, so I resolvednot to faint.“A man swept into the room, suddenly, like a chill wind. I had not ever beenafraid of any man, even Luchan, like I was afraid of this man. He was dressed inlayer upon layer of cloth strips that flowed out behind as he moved. His jetblack hair was swept back and smoothed with oils that made it glisten. His noseseemed to stick out even more than it would have, had he not slicked back hishair. His small black eyes were rimmed in red. When those beady eyes fixed onme, I had to remind myself that I had vowed not to faint.“He peered at each person in turn as he slowly walked past us, as if he werepicking out a turnip for dinner. It was then, as his knobby fingers came outfrom his odd clothes to point in a waving manner at one person and then anotheruntil he had pointed out five people, that I saw that his fingernails were allpainted as black as his hair.“His hand waved, dismissing the rest of us. The soldiers moved between the fivepeople this man had pointed out and the rest of us. They started pushing ustoward the door, but just then, before we could be ushered out, a commander witha nose that had been flattened to the side, as if from being broken repeatedly,came in and said that the messenger had arrived. The man with the black hair ranhis black nails back through his black hair and told the commander to tell themessenger to wait, that by morning he would have the latest information.“I was then led out and down the stairs along with the rest of the people. Wewere taken outside and told to go away, that our services wouldn’t be needed.The soldiers laughed when they said this. I left with the others, so as not tomake the men angry. The people all whispered about having seen the great manhimself. I could think only of what the latest information might be.“Later, after dark, I sneaked back, and in the rear of the building Idiscovered, behind a gate through a high wooden fence, a narrow alleyway. In thedark, I entered the alley and hid myself inside a doorway entrance to the backhall of the building. There were passageways beyond, and, in the candlelight, Irecognized one passage as the place I had been earlier.“It was late and there was no one in the halls. I moved deeper into thepassageways. Rooms and recesses lined each side of the hall, but with the latehour no one came out. I sneaked up the stairs and crept to the big thick door tothe room where I had been taken.“It was there, in that dark hall before the big door, that I heard the mosthorrifying cries I have ever heard. People were begging and weeping for theirlives, crying for mercy. One woman pleaded endlessly to be put to death to endher suffering.“I thought I would vomit, or faint, but one thought kept me still and hidden,kept me from running as fast as my legs would carry me. That was the thoughtthat this was the fate of all my people if I did not help them by bringing LordRahl.“I stayed there all night, in a dark recess in a hall across from the big door,listening to those poor people in unimaginable agony. I don’t know what the manwas doing to them, but I thought I would die of sorrow for their slow suffering.The whole of the night, the moans of agony never ceased.“I shivered in my hiding place, weeping, and told myself that it wasn’t real,that I shouldn’t be afraid of what was not real. I imagined the people’s pain,but told myself that I was putting my imagination on top of my senses—the verything I had been taught was wrong. I put my thoughts to Marilee, the times wehad been together, and ignored the sounds that were not real. I could not knowwhat was real, what these sounds really were.“Early in the morning the commander I had seen before returned. I peekedcarefully out from my dark hiding place. The man with the black hair came to thedoor. I knew it was him because when his arm came out of the room to hand theman a scrolled paper, I saw his black fingernails.“The man with the black hair said to the commander with the flattened, crookednose, he called him ‘Najari,’ that he had found them. That’s what hesaid—’them.’ Then he said, ‘They’ve made it to the east edge of the wastelandand are now heading north.’ He told the man to give the messenger the ordersright away. Najari said, ‘Shouldn’t be long, then, Nicholas, and you will havethem and we’ll have the power to name our price.’ “"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25Richard spun around. “Nicholas? You heard him say that name?”Owen blinked in surprise. “Yes. I’m sure of it. He said Nicholas.”Kahlan felt a weary hopelessness settle over her, like the cold, wet mist.Richard gestured urgently. “Go on.”“Well, I wasn’t sure that they were talking about you—about the Lord Rahl andthe Mother Confessor—when the commander said ‘them,’ but by the grim excitementin their voices I had the impression that it was so. Their voices reminded me ofthe first time the Order came, at the way Luchan smiled at me in a way I hadnever seen before, like he might eat me.“I thought that this information was my best chance to find you. So I startedout at once.”Borne on a light gust, drizzle replaced the morning mist. Kahlan realized thatshe was shivering with the cold.Richard pointed at the man sitting on the ground not far away, the man with thenotch in his right ear, the man Kahlan had touched. Some of the storm withinRichard boiled to the surface.“There is the man the orders from Nicholas were sent to. He brought with himthose men you saw at our last camp. Had we not defended ourselves, had we putour own sincere hatred of violence above the nature of reality, we would be aslost as Marilee.”Owen stared at the man. “What is his name?”“I don’t know and it doesn’t matter to me in the least. He fought for theImperial Order—fought to uphold a view of all life, including his, asunimportant, interchangeable, expendable in the mindless pursuit of an idealthat holds individual lives as worthless in themselves—a tenet that demandssacrifice to others until you are nothing.“He fights for the dream of everybody to be nobody and nothing.“The beliefs of the Order hold that you had no right to love Marilee, thateveryone is the same and so your duty should be to marry someone who could bestuse your help. In that way, through selfless sacrifice, you would properly serveyour fellow man. Despite how you struggle not to see what’s before your eyes,Owen, I think somewhere beneath all your regurgitated teachings, you know thatthat is the greatest horror brought by the Order—not their brutality, but theirideas. It is their beliefs that sanction brutality, and yours that invite it.“He didn’t value his own life, who he was; why should I care what his name was.I give him what was his greatest ambition: nothingness.”When Richard saw Kahlan shivering in the cold drizzle, he withdrew his hot glarefrom Owen and retrieved her cloak from her pack in the wagon. With the utmostgentleness and care, he wrapped it around her shoulders. By the look on hisface, he seemed to have had all he could take of listening to Owen.Kahlan seized his hand, holding it to her cheek for a moment. There was somesmall good in the story they had heard from Owen.“This means that the gift isn’t killing you, Richard,” she said in aconfidential tone. “It was the poison.”She was relieved that they hadn’t run out of time to get him help, as she had sofeared on that brief, eternal wagon ride when he’d been unconscious.“I had the headaches before I ran into Owen. I still have the headaches. Thesword’s magic as well faltered before I was poisoned.”“But at least this now gives us more time to find the solutions to thoseproblems.”He ran his fingers back through his hair. “I’m afraid we have worse problems,now, and not the time you think.”“Worse problems?”Richard nodded. “You know the empire Owen comes from? Bandakar? Guess what‘Bandakar’ means.”Kahlan glanced at Owen sitting hunched on the crate and all by himself. Sheshook her head as her gaze returned to Richard’s gray eyes, troubled more by thesuppressed rage in his voice than anything else.“I don’t know, what?”“In High D’Haran it’s a name. It means ‘the banished.’ Remember from the book,The Pillars of Creation, when I was telling you what it said about how theydecided to send all the pristinely ungifted people away to the Old World—tobanish them? Remember that I said no one ever knew what became of them?“We just found out.“The world is now naked before the people of the Bandakaran Empire.”Kahlan frowned. “How can you know for certain that he is a descendant of thosepeople?”“Look at him. He’s blond and looks more like full-blooded D’Harans than he doesthe people down here in the Old World. More importantly, though, he’s notaffected by magic.”“But that could be just him.”Richard leaned in closer. “In a closed place like he comes from, a place shutoff from the rest of the world for thousands of years, even one pillar ofCreation would have spread that ungifted trait throughout the entire populationby now.“But there wasn’t just one; they were all ungifted. For that, they were banishedto the Old World, and in the Old World, where they tried to establish a newlife, they were again all collected and banished to that place beyond thosemountains—a place they were told was for the bandakar, the banished.”“How did the people in the Old World find out about them? How did they keep themall together, without a single one surviving to spread their ungifted trait tothe general population, and how did they manage to then put them all in thatplace—banish them?”“Good questions, all, but right now not the important ones.“Owen,” Richard called as he turned back to the others, “I want you to stayright there, please, while the rest of us decide what will be our single voiceabout what we must do.”Owen brightened at a method of doing things with which he identified and feltcomfortable. He didn’t seem to detect, as did Kahlan, the undercurrent ofsarcasm in Richard’s voice.“You,” Richard said to the man Kahlan had touched, “go sit beside him and seethat he waits there with you.”While the man scurried to do as he was told, Richard tilted his head in gestureto the rest of them, calling them away with him. “We need to talk.”Friedrich, Tom, Jennsen, Cara, and Kahlan followed Richard away from Owen andthe man. Richard leaned back against the chafing rail of the wagon and foldedhis arms as they all gathered close around him. He took time to appraise eachface looking at him.“We have big problems,” Richard began, “and not just from the poison Owen gaveme. Owen isn’t gifted. He’s like you, Jennsen. Magic doesn’t touch him.” Hisgaze remained locked on Jennsen’s. “The rest of his people are the same as he,as you.”Jennsen’s jaw fell open in astonishment. She looked confused, as if unable toreconcile it all in her mind. Friedrich and Tom looked nearly as startled.Cara’s brow drew down in a dark frown.“Richard,” Jennsen finally said, “that just can’t be. There’s too many of them.There’s no way that they can all be half brothers and sisters of ours.”“They aren’t half brothers and sisters,” Richard said. “They’re a line of peopledescended from the House of Rahl—people like you. I don’t have time right now toexplain all of it to you, but remember how I told you that you would bearchildren who were like you, and they would pass that pristinely ungifted traiton to all future generations? Well, back a long time ago, there were people likethat spreading in D’Hara. The people back then gathered up all these ungiftedpeople and sent them to the Old World. The people down here then sealed themaway beyond those mountains, there. The name of their empire, Bandakar, means‘the banished.’ “Jennsen’s big blue eyes filled with tears. She was one of those people, peopleso hated that they had been banished from the rest of the people in their ownland and sent into exile.Kahlan put an arm around her shoulders. “Remember how you said that you feltalone in the world?” Kahlan smiled warmly. “You don’t have to feel aloneanymore. There are people like you.”Kahlan didn’t think her words seemed to help much, but Jennsen welcomed thecomfort of the embrace.Jennsen abruptly looked back up at Richard. “That can’t be true. They had aboundary that kept them locked in that place. If they were like me they wouldn’tbe affected by a boundary of magic. They could have come out of there any timethey wished. Over all this time, at least some of them would have come out intothe rest of the world—the magic of the boundary couldn’t have held them back.”“I don’t think that’s true,” Richard said. “Remember when you saw the sandflowing sideways in that warning beacon that Sabar brought us? That was magic,and you saw it.”“That’s right,” Kahlan said. “If she’s a pillar of Creation, then how is such athing possible?”“That’s right,” Jennsen agreed. “How could that be, if I’m truly ungifted?” Hereyebrows went up. “Richard—maybe it’s not true after all. Maybe I have a bit ofthe spark of the gift—maybe I’m not really, truly ungifted.”Richard smiled. “Jennsen, you’re as pure as a snowflake. You saw that magic fora reason. Nicci wrote us in her letter that the warning beacon was linked to thewizard who created it—linked to him in the underworld. The underworld is theworld of the dead. That means that the statue functioned partly throughSubtractive Magic—magic having to do with the underworld. You may be immune tomagic, but you are not immune to death. Gifted or not, you’re still linked tolife, and thus death.“That’s why you saw some of the magic of the statue—the part relating to theadvancement of death.“The boundary was a place in this world where death itself existed. To go intothat boundary was to enter the world of the dead. No one returns from the dead.If any pristinely ungifted person in Bandakar had gone into the boundary, theywould have died. That was how they were sealed in.”“But they could banish people through the boundary,” Jennsen pressed. “Thatwould have to mean that the boundary didn’t really affect them.”Richard was shaking his head even as she was protesting. “No. They were touchedby death, the same as anyone. But there was a way left through the boundary—muchlike the one that once divided the three lands of the New World. I got throughthat boundary without being touched by it. There was a pass through it, aspecial, hidden place to get through the boundary. This one was the same.”Jennsen wrinkled her nose. “That makes no sense, then. If that was true, and itwasn’t hidden from them—since they all knew of this passage through theboundary—then why couldn’t they all just leave if they wanted to? How could itseal the rest of them in, if they could send banished people through?”Richard sighed, wiping a hand across his face. It looked to Kahlan like hewished she hadn’t asked that question.“You know the area we passed a while back?” Richard asked her. “That place wherenothing grew?”Jennsen nodded. “I remember.”“Well, Sabar said he came through another one, a little to the north of here.”“That’s right,” Kahlan said. “And it ran toward the center of the wasteland,toward the Pillars of Creation—just like the one we saw. They had to be roughlyparallel.”Richard was nodding to what she was beginning to suspect. “And they were toeither side of the notch into Bandakar. They weren’t very far apart. We’re inthat place right now, between those two boundaries.”Friedrich leaned in. “But Lord Rahl, that would mean that if someone wasbanished from the Bandakaran Empire, when they emerged from that boundary theywould find themselves trapped between the walls of these two boundaries outhere, and there wasn’t much room between them. A person would have nowhere to gobut...”Friedrich covered his mouth as he turned west, looking off into the gloom.“The Pillars of Creation,” Richard finished with quiet finality.“But, but,” Jennsen stammered, “are you saying that someone made it that way?Made these two boundaries deliberately to force anyone who was sent out of theBandakaran Empire to go into that place—the Pillars of Creation? Why?”Richard looked into her eyes for a long moment. “To kill them.”Jennsen swallowed. “You mean, whoever banished these people wanted anyone theyin turn sent out, anyone they exiled, to die?”“Yes,” Richard said.Kahlan pulled her cloak tighter around herself. It had been hot for so long shecould hardly believe that the weather had so suddenly turned cold.Richard swiped a lock of wet hair back off his forehead as he went on. “Fromwhat Adie told me once, boundaries have to have a pass to create balance on bothsides, to equalize the life on both sides. I suspect that those down here in theOld World who banished these people wanted to give them a way to get rid ofcriminals and so told the people about the existence of the pass. But theydidn’t want such people to be loosed on the rest of the world. Criminals or not,they were ungifted. They couldn’t be allowed to run free.”Kahlan immediately saw the problem with his theory. “But all three boundarieswould have had to have a pass,” she said. “Even if the other two passes, in theremaining two boundaries, were secret, that still left the possibility thatanyone exiled and sent through the notch might find one of them and so not tryto escape through the Pillars of Creation where they would die. That left thechance that they might still escape into the Old World.”“If there really were three boundaries, such might be the case,” Richard said.“But I don’t think there were three. I think there really was only one.”“Now you’re not making any sense,” Cara complained. “You said there was the onegoing north and south blocking the pass, and then there were these two parallelones out here, going east and west, to funnel anyone who came out of the empirethrough that first boundary, toward the Pillars of Creation where they woulddie.”Kahlan had to agree. It seemed that there might be a chance for someone toescape through one of the other two.“I don’t think there were three boundaries,” Richard repeated. “I think therewas only one. That one boundary wasn’t straight—it was bent in half.” He heldtwo fingers up, side by side. “The bottom of the bend went across the pass.” Hepointed at the web between the two fingers. “The two legs extended out here,parallel, going off to where they ended at the Pillars.”Jennsen could only ask “Why?”“It seems to me, by how elaborate the whole design was, that the ones who sealedthose people in wanted to give them a way to rid themselves of dangerous people,possibly knowing from what they had learned of their beliefs that they wouldbalk at executing anyone. When these people were banished here to the Old World,they may have already had at least the core of the same beliefs they hold now.Those beliefs leave them completely vulnerable to those who are evil. Protectingtheir way of life, without executing criminals, meant they had to cast suchpeople out of their community or be destroyed by them.“The banishment away from D’Hara and the New World, across the barrier into theOld World, must have terrified them. They stuck together as a means of survival,a common bond.“Those down here in the Old World who put them behind that boundary must haveused those people’s fear of persecution to convince them that the boundary wasmeant to protect them, to keep others from harming them. They must haveconvinced those people that, since they were special, they needed suchprotection. That, along with their well-established need to stick together, hadto have reinforced in them a terrible fear of being put out of their protectedplace. Banishment had a special terror to those people.“They must have felt the anguish of being rejected by the rest of the peoples ofthe world because they were ungifted, but, together as they were, they also feltsafe behind the boundary.“Now that the seal is off, we have big problems.”Jennsen folded her arms. “Now that there’s more than one of us—more than onesnowflake—you’re having worries about a snowstorm?”Richard fixed her with a reproachful look. “Why do you think the Order came inand took some of their people?”“Apparently,” Jennsen said, “to breed more children like them. To breed preciousmagic out of the race of man.”Richard ignored the heat in her words. “No, I mean why would they take men?”“Same reason,” Jennsen said. “To mate with regular women and give them ungiftedchildren.”Richard drew in a patient breath and let it out slowly. “What did Owen say? Themen were taken to see the women and told that if they didn’t follow orders thosewomen would be skinned alive.”Jennsen hesitated. “What orders?”Richard leaned toward her. “What orders, indeed. Think about it,” he said,looking around at the rest of them. “What orders? What would they want ungiftedmen for? What is it they would want ungifted men to do?”Kahlan gasped. “The Keep!”“Exactly.” Richard’s unsettling gaze met each of them in turn. “Like I said, wehave big problems. Zedd is protecting the Keep. With his ability and the magicof that place he can no doubt single-handedly hold off Jagang’s entire army.“But how is that skinny old man going to resist even one young ungifted man whois untouched by magic and comes up and grabs him by the throat?”Jennsen’s hand came away from her mouth. “You’re right, Richard. Jagang, too,has that book—The Pillars of Creation. He knows how those like me aren’t touchedby magic. He tried to use me in that very way. That’s why he worked so hard toconvince me that you were trying to kill me—so that I would think my only chancewas to kill you first. He knew I was ungifted and couldn’t be stopped by magic.”“And, Jagang is from the Old World,” Richard added. “In all likelihood he wouldhave known something about the empire beyond that boundary. For all we know, inthe Old World Bandakar might be legendary, while those in the New World, beyondthe great barrier for three thousand years, would never have known what happenedto those people.“Now, the Order has been taking men from there and threatening them with thebrutal murder of their defenseless women—women who are loved ones—if those mendon’t follow orders. I think those orders are to assault the Wizard’s Keep andcapture it for the Imperial Order.”Kahlan’s legs shook. If the Keep fell, they would lose the one real advantage,however limited, they had. With the Keep in the hands of the Order, all thoseancient and deadly things of magic would be available to Jagang. There was notelling what he might unleash. There were things in the Keep that could killthem all, Jagang included. He had already proven with the plague he’d unleashedthat he was willing to kill any number to have his way, that he was willing touse any weapon, even if such weapons decimated his own people as well.Even if Jagang did nothing with the Keep, just him having control of it deniedthe D’Haran Empire the possibility of finding something there that could helpthem. That was, in addition to protecting the Keep, what Zedd was doing while hewas there—trying to find something that would help them win the war, or at leastfind a way to put the Imperial Order back behind a barrier of some kind andconfine them to the Old World.Without the Keep, their cause would likely be hopeless. Resistance would benothing more than delaying the inevitable. Without the Keep on their side, allresistance to Jagang would eventually be crushed. His troops would pour intoevery part of the New World. There would be no stopping them.With trembling fingers Kahlan clutched her cloak closed. She knew what awaitedher people, what it was like when the Imperial Order invaded and overpoweredplaces. She had been with the army for nearly a year, fighting against them.They were like a pack of wild dogs. There was no peace with such animals afteryou. They would be satisfied only when they could tear you apart.Kahlan had been to cities, like Ebinissia, that had been overrun by ImperialOrder soldiers. In a wild binge of savagery that went on for days, they hadtortured, raped, and murdered every person trapped in the city, finally leavingit a wasteland of human corpses. None, no matter their age, had been spared.That was what the people of the New World had to look forward to.With enemy troops overrunning all of the New World, any trade that was notalready disrupted would be brought to a standstill. Nearly all businesses wouldfail. The livelihood of countless people would be lost. Food would quicklybecome scarce, and then simply unavailable at any cost. People would have nomeans of supporting themselves and their families. People would lose everythingfor which they had worked a lifetime.Cities, even before the troops arrived, would be in a destructive panic. Whenthe enemy troops arrived, most people would be burned out of their homes, drivenfrom their cities and their land. Jagang would steal all supplies of food forhis troops and give conquered land to his favored elite. The true owners of thatland would perish, or become slaves working their own farms. Those who escapedbefore the invading horde would desperately cling to life, living like animalsin wild areas.Most of the population would be in flight, running for their lives. Hundreds ofthousands would be out in the elements without shelter. There would be littlefood, and no ability to prepare for winter. When the weather turned harsh, theywould perish in droves.As civilization crumbled and starvation became the norm, disease would sweepacross the land, catching up those on the run. Families would collapse as thosethey depended on suffered agonizingly slow and painful deaths. Children and theweak would be alone, to be preyed upon as a source of food for the starving.Kahlan knew what such widespread disease was like. She knew what it was to watchpeople dying by the thousands. She had seen it happen in Aydindril when theplague was there. She saw scores stricken without warning. She had watched theold, the young—such good people—contract something they could not fight, watchedthem suffer in misery for days before they died.Richard had been stricken with that plague. Unlike everyone else, though, he hadgotten it knowingly. Taking the plague deliberately had been the price to getback to her. He had traded his life just to be with her again before he died.That had been a time beyond horror.Kahlan knew, firsthand, savage desperation. It was then that she had taken theonly chance available to her to save his life. It was then that she had loosedthe chimes. That act had saved Richard’s life. She hadn’t known at the time thatit would also be a catalyst that would set unforeseen events into motion.Because of her desperate act, the boundary to this empire had lost its power andfailed. Because of her, all magic might eventually fail.Now, because of that boundary failing, the Wizard’s Keep, their last bastion towork a solution against the Order, was in terrible jeopardy.Kahlan felt as if it was all her fault.The world was on the brink of destruction. Civilization stood at the thresholdof obliteration in the name of the Order’s mindless idea of a greater good. TheOrder demanded sacrifice to that greater good; what they were determined tosacrifice was reason, and, therefore, civilization itself. Madness had cast itsshadow across the world and would have them all.They now stood in the edge of the shadow of a dark age. They were all on the eveof the end times.Kahlan couldn’t say that, though. She couldn’t tell them how she felt. She darednot reveal her despair.“Richard, we simply can’t allow the Order to capture the Keep.” Kahlan couldhardly believe how calm and determined her voice sounded. She wondered if anyoneelse would believe that she thought they still stood a chance. “We have to stopthem.”“I agree,” Richard said.He sounded determined, too. She wondered if he saw in her eyes the true depthsof her despair.“First,” he said, “the easy part: Nicci and Victor. We have to tell them that wecan’t come now. Victor needs to know what we would say to him. He will need toknow that we agree with his plans—that he must proceed and that he can’t waitfor us. We’ve talked with him; he knows what to do. Now, he must do it, andPriska must know that he has to help.“Nicci needs to know where we’re going. She needs to know that we believe we’vediscovered the cause of the warning beacon. She has to know where we are.”He left unsaid that she had to come to help him if he couldn’t get to herbecause his gift was killing him.“She needs to know, too,” Richard said, “that we only had a chance to read partof her warning about what Jagang was doing with the Sisters of the Dark increating weapons out of people.”Everyone’s eyes widened. They hadn’t read the letter.“Well,” Kahlan said, “with all the other problems we have, at least that’s onewe won’t have to deal with for now.”“We have that much on our side,” Richard agreed. He gestured to the manwatching, the man waiting for Kahlan to command him. “We’ll send him to Victorand Nicci so they will know everything.”“And then what?” Cara asked.“I want Kahlan to command him that when he’s finished with carrying out thatpart of his orders, he’s then to go north and find the Imperial Order army. Iwant him to pretend to be one of them to get close enough to assassinate EmperorJagang.”Kahlan knew how implausible such a scheme was. By the way everyone stared inastonishment, they had a good idea, too.“Jagang has layers of men to protect him from assassination,” Jennsen said.“He’s always surrounded by special guards. Regular soldiers can’t even get closeto him.”“Do you really think he has any chance at all to accomplish such a thing?”Kahlan asked.“No,” Richard admitted. “The Order will most likely kill him before he can getto Jagang. But he will be driven by the need to fulfill your orders. He will besingle-minded. I expect he will be killed in the effort, but I also suspect hewill at least make a good attempt of it. I want Jagang to at least lose somesleep knowing that any of his men might be assassins. I want him to worry thathe will never know who might be trying to kill him. I don’t want him ever to beable to sleep soundly. I want him to be haunted by nightmares of what might becoming next, of who among his men might be waiting for an opening.”Kahlan nodded her agreement. Richard appraised the grim faces waiting for therest of what he had to say.“Now, to the most important part of what must be done. It’s vital we get to theKeep and warn Zedd. We can’t delay. Jagang is ahead of us in all this—he’s beenplanning and acting and we never realized what he was up to. We don’t know howsoon those ungifted men might be sent north. We haven’t a moment to lose.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara reminded him, “you have to get to the antidote before timeruns out. You can’t go running off to the Keep to ... Oh, no. Now you just waita minute—you’re not sending me to the Keep again. I’m not leaving you at a timelike this, at a time when you’re next to defenseless. I won’t hear of it and Iwon’t go.”Richard laid a hand on her shoulder. “Cara, I’m not sending you, but thanks foroffering.”Cara folded her arms and shot him a fiery scowl.“We can’t take the wagon up into Bandakar—there’s no road—”“Lord Rahl,” Tom interrupted, “without magic you’ll need all the steel youhave.” He sounded only slightly less emphatic than Cara had.Richard smiled. “I know, Tom, and I agree. It’s Friedrich who I think must go.”Richard turned to Friedrich. “You can take the wagon. An older man, by himself,will raise less suspicion than would any of the rest of us. They won’t see youas a threat. You will be able to make better time with the wagon and withouthaving to worry that the Order might snatch you and put you in the army. Willyou do it, Friedrich?”Friedrich scratched his stubble. A smile came to his weathered face. “I guessI’m at last being called upon to be a boundary warden, of sorts.”Richard smiled with him. “Friedrich, the boundary has failed. As the Lord Rahl,I appoint you to the post of boundary warden and ask that you immediatelyundertake to warn others of the danger come from out of that boundary.”Friedrich’s smile departed as he put a fist to his heart in salute and solemnpledge."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26Somewhere back in a distant room, where his body waited, Nicholas heard aninsistent noise. He was absorbed in the task at hand, so he ignored the sound.The light was fading, and although light helped to see, darkness would nothinder eyes such as he used.Again, he heard the noise. Indignant that the sound kept calling him, keptannoying him, kept demanding his attention, he returned to his body.Someone was banging a fist on the door.Nicholas rose from the floor, where his body sat cross-legged, taking his bodywith him. It was always, at first, disorienting to have to be in his body again,to be so limited, so confined. It felt awkward to have to move it about, to usehis own muscles, to breathe, to see, to hear with his own senses.The knock came again. Irate at the interruption, Nicholas went not to the doorbut to the windows, and threw the shutters closed. He cast a hand out, ignitingthe torch, and finally stalked to the door. Layered strips of cloth covering hisrobes flowed out behind, like a heavy mantle of black feathers.“What is it!” He threw open the heavy door and peered out.Najari stood just outside, in the hall, his weight on one foot, his thumbshooked behind his belt. His muscular shoulders nearly touched the walls to eachside. Nicholas saw, then, the huddled crowd behind the man. Najari’s crookednose, flattened to the left in some of the numerous brawls his temper got himinto, cast an oddly shaped shadow across his cheek. Anyone unfortunate enough tofind themselves in a brawl with Najari usually suffered far worse than a merebroken nose.Najari waggled a thumb over his shoulder. “You asked for some guests, Nicholas.”Nicholas raked his nails back through his hair, feeling the silken smoothpleasure of oils gliding against his palm. He rolled his shoulders, rufflingaway his pique.Nicholas had been so absorbed in what he had been doing that he had forgottenthat he had requested that Najari bring him some bodies.“Very good, Najari. Bring them in, then. Let’s have a look at them.”Nicholas watched as the commander led the gaggle of people into the flickeringtorchlight. Soldiers in the rear herded the stragglers through the door and intothe large room. Heads swiveled around, looking at the strange, starksurroundings, at the wooden walls, the torches in brackets, the plank flooring,the lack of furniture other than a stout table. Noses twitched at the sharpsmell of blood.Nicholas watched carefully as people spotted the sharpened stakes standing in aline along the wall to their right, stakes as thick as Najari’s wrists.Nicholas studied the people, watching for the telltales of fear as they spreadout along the wall beside the door. Eyes flitted about, worried, and at the sametime eager to take it all in so they could report to their friends what they hadseen inside. Nicholas knew that he was an object of great curiosity.A rare being.A Slide.No one knew what his name meant. This day, some would learn.Nicholas glided past the undulating mob. They were a curious people, these odd,ungifted creatures, curious like mockingbirds, but not nearly so bold. Becausethey were without any spark whatsoever of the gift, Nicholas had to handle themin special ways in order for them to be of any use to him. It was a bother, butit had its rewards.Some necks craned in his wake, trying to better see the rare man.He ran his nails through his hair again just to feel the oils slide against hishand. As he leaned close to some of the people he passed, observing individualsin the gathering, one of the women before him closed her eyes, turning her faceaway. Nicholas lifted a hand toward her, flicking out a finger. He glanced toNajari to be sure he saw which one had been picked.Najari’s gaze flicked from the woman up to Nicholas; he had noted the selection.A man back against the wall stood stiff, his eyes wide. Nicholas flicked afinger at him. Another man twisted his lips in an odd manner. Nicholas glanceddown and saw that the man, in a state of wild fright, had wet himself.Nicholas’s finger flitted out again. Three selected. Nicholas walked on.A thin whine escaped the throat of a woman in the front, right before him. Hesmiled at her. She peered up, trembling, unable to take her wide-eyed gaze fromhim, from his red-rimmed black eyes, unable to halt the puling sound escapingher throat. She had never seen one so human ... yet not. Nicholas tapped hershoulder with a long-nailed finger. He would reward her unspoken revulsion withservice to a greater good. His.Jagang had sought to create something ... unusual, for himself. A bauble offlesh and blood. A magical trinket crafted from a wizard. A lapdog ... withteeth.His Excellency had gotten what he wanted, and more. Oh, so much more.Nicholas would enjoy seeing how the emperor liked having a puppet withoutstrings, a specially crafted creation with a mind of its own, and talents tofulfill his wishes.A man at the rear, against the wall, appeared to be somewhat uninterested, as ifimpatient for the exhibition to be over so he could go back to his own affairs.While none of these people could be said to think of themselves as importantindividuals with consequential sway over any meaningful aspects of life in theirempire, a few occasionally exhibited tendencies, even if inconsistent, towardself-interest. Nicholas flicked his finger for the fifth time. The man wouldsoon have reason to be highly interested in the proceedings, and he would findthat he was no better than anyone else. He would be going nowhere—at least notin body.Everyone stared in silence as Nicholas chuckled alone at his own joke.His amusement ended. Nicholas tipped his head toward the door in a single nod.The soldiers jumped into action.“All right,” Najari growled, “move along. Move! Get going. Out, out, out!”The feet of the crowd shuffled urgently through the door as ordered. Some peoplecast worried glances back over their shoulders at the five Najari had cut out ofthe flock. Those five were shoved back when they sought to stay with the rest. Astiff finger to the chest backed them up as effectively as would a club or asword.“Don’t cause any trouble,” Najari warned, “or you will be making trouble for theothers.”The five remaining huddled close to one another, rocking nervously side to sidelike a covey of quail before a bird dog.When the soldiers had driven the rest of the people out, Najari closed the doorand stood before it, hands clasped behind his back.Nicholas returned to the windows, opening the shutters on the west wall. The sunwas down, leaving a red slash across the sky.Soon they would be on the wing, on the hunt.Nicholas would be with them.Casting an arm back without needing to turn to look, he doused the torch. Theflickering light was a distraction during this cusp of time, the transienttwilight that was so fragile, so brief. He would need the light, but, at themoment, he wanted only to see the sky, to see the glorious, unbounded sky.“Are we going to be able to leave soon?” one of the people asked in a timidsqueak.Nicholas turned and peered at them. Najari’s eyes revealed which one had spoken.Nicholas followed his commander’s gaze. It was one of the men—the one who hadbeen impatient to leave, of course.“Go?” Nicholas asked as he swept in close to the man. “You wish to go?”The man stood with his back bent, leaning away from Nicholas.“Well, sir, I was only wondering when we would be going.”Nicholas stooped in even more, peering deeply into the man’s eyes. “Wonder insilence,” he hissed.Returning to the windows, Nicholas rested his hands on the sill, his weight onhis arms, as he breathed in deeply the gathering night while taking in the sweepof crimson sky.Soon, he would be there, be free.Soon, he would soar as no one else but he could.Impulsively, he sought them.Eyes bulging with the effort, he cast his senses where none but his could go.“There!” he screeched, throwing his arm out, pointing a long black nail at whatnone but he could see. “There! One has taken to wing.”Nicholas spun around, strips of cloth lifting, floating up. Panting through arush of fluttering excitement, he gazed at the eyes staring at him. They couldnot know. They could not understand one such as he, understand what he felt,what he needed. He hungered to be on the hunt, to be with them, ever since hehad imagined such a use for his ability.He had reveled in the experience, dedicating himself to it as he learned his newabilities. He had been off with those glorious creatures as often as he couldafford the time, ever since he had come here and discovered them.How ironic it now seemed that he had resisted. How odd that he once had fearedwhat those gruesome women, those Sisters of the Dark, had conspired to do to him... what they had done to him.His duty, they had called it.Their vile magic had cut like a red-hot blade through him. He had thought hiseyes might burst from his head from the pain that had seared through him. Tiedspread-eagled to stakes in the ground in the center of their wicked circle, hehad dreaded what they were going to do to him.He had feared it.Nicholas smiled.Hated it, even.He had been afraid because of the pain, the pain of what they were doing to him,and the even greater pain of not knowing what more they intended to do to him.His duty, they had called it, to a greater good. His ability boreresponsibilities, they had insisted.He watched through glazed eyes as Najari bound the hands of the five peoplebehind each of their backs.“Thank you, Najari,” he said when the man had finished.Najari approached. “The men will have them by now, Nicholas. I told them to sendenough men to insure that they would not escape.” Najari grinned at theprospect. “There’s no need to worry. They should all be on their way back tous.”Nicholas narrowed his eyes. “We will see. We will see.”He wanted to see it himself. With his own vision—even if his own vision wasthrough another’s eyes.Najari yawned on his way to the door. “See you tomorrow, then, Nicholas.”Nicholas opened his mouth wide, mimicking the yawn, even though he didn’t yawn.It felt good to stretch his jaws wide. Sometimes he felt trapped inside himselfand he wanted out.Nicholas closed the door behind Najari and bolted it. It was a perfunctory act,done more to add to the aura of peril than out of necessity. Even with theirhands tied behind their backs, these people could, together, probably overpowerhim—knock him down and kick in his head, if nothing else. But for that, theywould have to think, to decide what they ought to do and why, to commit to act.Easier not to think. Easier not to act. Easier to do as you are told.Easier to die than to live.Living took effort. Struggle. Pain.Nicholas hated it.“Hate to live, live to hate,” he said to the silent, ghostly white faceswatching him.Out the window the streaks of clouds had gone dark gray as the touch of the sunpassed beyond them and night crept in to embrace them. Soon, he would be amongthem.He turned back from the window, taking in the faces watching him. Soon, theywould all be out there, among them."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27Nicholas seized one of the nameless men. Powered by muscles crafted of theSisters’ dark art, he hoisted the man into the air. The man cried out insurprise at being lifted so easily. He struggled hesitantly against muscle hewould not be able to resist were he even to put daring into it. These peoplewere immune to magic, or Nicholas would have used his power to easily lift themaloft. Absent the necessary spark of the gift, they had to be manhandled.It made little difference to Nicholas. How they got to the stakes wasunimportant. What happened to them once there was all that mattered.As the man in his arms cried out in terror, Nicholas carried him across theroom. The other people withdrew into a far corner. They always went to the farcorner, like chickens about to be dinner.Nicholas, his arms around the man’s chest, lifted him high in the air, judgingthe distance and angle as he raced ahead.The man’s eyes went wide, his mouth did likewise. He gasped with the shock, thengrunted as Nicholas, hugging the man tight in his arms, drove him down onto thestake.The man’s breath came in short sharp gasps as the sharpened stake penetrated upthrough his insides. He went still in Nicholas’s powerful arms, fearing to move,fearing to believe what was happening to him, fearing to know it was true ...trying to deny to himself that it could be true.Nicholas straightened to his full height before the man. The man’s back was asstraight and stiff as a board as he sat impaled on the sharpened stake. Hiseyebrows pushed his sweat-beaded brow up in furrows as he writhed in slow agony,his legs trying to touch the ground that was too far away.Into that confusion of sensation, Nicholas reached out with his mind, at thesame time clawing his hands before the man with the effort as he slid his ownbeing, his own spirit, into the core of this living creature, slid into thisman’s open mind, into the cavernous cracks between his abrupt and disconnectedthoughts, there to feel his agony and fright. There to take control. Once he hadslipped his own mind in there with this man, seeped through his consciousness,Nicholas drew his essence out and into himself.With a staggering fusion of destructive and creative power dealt by those womenthat day, Nicholas had been born into a new being, part him, and yet more. Hehad become what no man had ever been before—what others wished to make of him,what others wished him to be.What had been unleashed in him by those Sisters all linked in their ability toharness powers they could never have touched alone and should never have invokedtogether, they instilled in him. They engendered in him powers few could everhave imagined: the power to slide into another living person’s thoughts, andwithdraw their spirit.He drew his closed fists back toward his own abdomen with the effort of drawingwith him the spirit of this man on the cusp of life and death, drew onward themarrow of this man’s soul. Nicholas felt the slick heat of this other spiritslide into his, the hot rush of sensation at feeling himself filled with anotherspirit.Nicholas left the body there, impaled on the first stake, as he rushed to thewindows, his head spinning with the first intoxicating wave of excitement at thejourney only now just begun, at what was to come, at what power he wouldcontrol.He opened his mouth wide again in a yawn that was not a yawn, but a callcarrying more than just his silent voice.His eyes swam with wavering images. He gasped in the first scent of the forestsout beyond, where his intent had been cast.He rushed back and seized a woman. She begged as she wept, begged to be sparedas he bore her to her stake.“But this is nothing,” he told her. “Nothing compared to what I have endured.Oh, you cannot imagine what I have endured.”He had been staked naked to the ground, in the center of a circle of those smugwomen. He had been nothing to them. He had not been a man, a wizard. He had beennothing but the raw material, the flesh and blood innervated by the gift, thatthey needed for what they wanted, that they used in yet another of their trials,all to be twisted by their tinkering at creation.He had the ability, so duty required he sacrifice it.Nicholas had been the first to live through their tests, not because they tookcare—not because they cared—but because they had learned what didn’t work, andso avoided their past errors.“Scream, my dear. Scream all you want. It will help you no more than it helpedme.”“Why!” she screamed. “Why!”“Oh, but I must, if I am to have your spirit to soar on the wings of my distantfriends. You will go on a glorious journey, you and I.”“Please!” she wailed. “Dear Creator, no!”“Oh, yes, dear Creator,” he mocked. “Come and save her—like you came and savedme.”Her wailing did her no good. His hadn’t either. She had no idea how immeasurablyworse his agony had been than hers would be. Unlike her, he had been condemnedto live.“Hate to live, live to hate,” he murmured in a comforting whisper. “You willhave the glory and the reward that is death.”He drove her down onto the stake. He reckoned her not far enough onto the stake,and shoved her down another six inches, until he judged it deep enough withinher, deep enough to produce the necessary pain and terror, but not deep enoughto lance anything inside that would kill her right off. She thrashed, tryingdesperately, hands helpless behind her back, to somehow remove herself.He was only dimly aware of her cries, her worthless words. She thought theymight somehow make a difference.Pain was his goal. Their complaints of it only confirmed that he was achievinghis goal.Nicholas stood before the woman, hands clawed, as he slid his own spirit throughher sundered thoughts and into the core of her being. With mental strength farsuperior to his physical strength, he pulled her back. He gasped as he felt herspirit slide into his.For now, he slipped those spirits out of tortured, dying bodies while thosespirits existed in the netherworld between the worldly form they knew was lostto them, but still alive, and the world of the dead already calling them in frombeyond. Life could no longer hold them, but death could not yet have them. Inthat time of spiritual transition, they were his, and he could use those spiritsfor things only he could imagine.And he had not yet really even begun to imagine.Such ability as he possessed was not something that could be taught byanother—there was no other but he. He was still learning the extent of hispowers, the things he could do with the spirit of another. He had only scratchedthe surface.Emperor Jagang had sought to create something akin to himself, a dream walker, abrother, of sorts. One who could enter another’s mind. He had gotten far morethan he could have ever have imagined. Nicholas didn’t simply slide intoanother’s thoughts, as Jagang did; he could slide into their very soul, and drawtheir spirit back into himself.The Sisters hadn’t counted on that aberration of their tinkering with hisability.Rushing to the window, his mouth pulled open as wide as it would go in a yawnthat wasn’t a yawn. The room swam behind him. It was only partly there, now.Now, he was beginning to see other places. Glorious places. See them with newvision, with spirits no longer bound to their paltry bodies.He rushed to the third person, no longer aware even if they were man or woman.Their soul was all that mattered—their spirit.He drove them onto a stake with urgent effort, slid into them and drew theirspirit into his, shuddering with the power of it entering him.He rushed to the window again, opening wide his mouth again, twisting his headside to side again with the thrill of it, the slick, silken, sliding ecstasy ofit... the loss of physical orientation, the exaltation of being above hiscorporeal existence, the former bounds of his mere worldly form—carried aloftnot simply with his own efforts, but by the spirits of others that he had freedfrom their bodies.What a glorious thing it was.It was almost like the joy he imagined death would be.He seized the fourth weeping person and with delirious expectation ran with themacross the room, to the stakes, to the fourth stake, and drove them screamingonto it.As he lurched back from them, he thrust himself into their wildly racing,confused, swirling thoughts, and took what was there for the taking. He tooktheir spirit into himself.When he controlled a person’s spirit, he controlled their very existence. Hebecame life and death for them. He was their savior, their destroyer.He was in many ways like those spirits he took, trapped in a worldly form,hating to live, to endure the pain and agony that was life, yet fearing to dieeven while longing for the promise of its sweet embrace.With four spirits swirling through him, Nicholas staggered to the fifth person,cowering in the corner.“Please!” the man wailed, trying to ward what he would not commit to warding.“Please, don’t!”The thought occurred to Nicholas that the stakes were really a hindrance; usingthem required him to carry people around like woolly sheep to have their soulssheared. Yes, he was still learning what he could do and how to control what hedid, but to have to use the stakes was limiting. When he thought about it, itwas actually insulting that a wizard of his ability would have to use so crude adevice.What he really wanted to do was to slide into another’s spirit and take itwithout any warning—without needing to bring people to the stakes.When he was fully able to do that—to simply walk up to another, say “Good day,”and slide like the thrust of a dagger into the heart of their spirit, there todraw it into his—then he would be invincible. When he was able to do that, thenno one could challenge him. No one would be able to deny him anything.As the man shrank down before him, Nicholas, before he fully realized what itwas he was doing, driven by an angry need, by hatred, thrust out his hand as hethrust his own mind into this man, into the spaces between thought.The man stiffened, just as those on the stakes stiffened, when Nicholas hadimpaled them with his ability.He drew back his closed fist toward his middle as he drew in this man’s spirit.He gasped with the heat of it, with the silky slick feel of it sliding into him.They stared at each other, each in shock, each considering what this meant forthem.The man slumped back against the wall, sliding down, in soundless, silent,terrible empty agony.Nicholas realized that he had just done what he had never done before. He hadjust taken a soul by his will alone.He had just freed himself to take what he wanted, when he wanted, where hewanted."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28Nicholas, his vision a blur, staggered to the window.All five were his, now.This time, as his mouth opened wide, a cry at last came forth, a cry of the fivespirits joining his as he drew them together into one force guided by his willalone. Their worldly agony was a distant concern to them. Five spirits gazed outof the windows along with him, five spirits now waiting to soar out into thenight, to where he chose to send them.Those Sisters had not known what they unleashed that night. They could not haveknown the power they fused into him, the ability they burned into him.They had achieved what none had achieved for thousands of years—the altering ofa wizard into something more, honing him into a weapon of specific intent. Theyhad imbued him with power beyond that of anyone living. They had given himdominion over the spirits of others.Most had escaped, but he had killed five of them.The five were enough. After he had slid into their souls and pulled theirspirits back into his that night, he had appropriated their Han, their force oflife, their power, for himself.It was only fitting, as their Han was not natural to them, but was male Han theyhad stolen from young wizards—a birthright they had sucked from those to whom itbelonged in order to give themselves abilities they had not been born with,could not be born with. Yet more nameless people with ability to be sacrificedto those who needed it, or simply wanted it.Nicholas had taken it all back from their trembling bodies, pulled it out ofthem as he had clawed their living insides open. They had been sorry that theyhad done Jagang’s bidding, that they had twisted him into something Creationnever intended.Not only had they made him into a Slide, they had given up their Han to him, andmade him that much more powerful for it.After each of those five women had died, the world had gone darker than dark foran instant when the Keeper had come and taken them to his realm.The Sisters had destroyed him that day, and they had created him.He had a lifetime to explore and discover what he could do with his newabilities.And, to be sure, Jagang would grant him payment for that night. Jagang wouldpay, but he would pay gladly, for Nicholas would give him something none butNicholas the Slide could give him.Nicholas would be rewarded with things enough to repay him for what had beendone to him... He hadn’t decided, yet, what that reward would be, but it wouldbe worthy of him.He would use his ability to hold sway over lives—important lives. He no longerneeded to cart people to the stakes. He knew how to take what he wanted, now.Now he knew how to slip into their minds at the time of his choosing and taketheir souls.He would trade those lives for what he would have in power, wealth, splendor. Itwould have to be something appropriate...He would be an emperor.It would have to be more than this petty empire of sheep, though. He wouldfrolic in rule. He would have his every whim fulfilled, once he was givendominion over... over something important. He hadn’t decided just what, yet. Itwas an important decision, what he would have as his reward. No need to rush it.It would come to him.He turned from the window, the five spirits swirling within his, soaring throughhim.It was time to use what he had pulled together.Time to get down to business, if he was to have what he wanted.He would get closer, this time. He was frustrated from not being closer, fromnot seeing better. It was dark, now. He would get closer, this time, under coverof the darkness.Nicholas took the broad bowl from the table and placed it on the floor beforethe five who still owned the spirits within him. They writhed in otherworldlyagony, even the man not on a stake, an agony of both body and soul.Nicholas sat cross-legged on the floor before the bowl. Hands on his knees, hethrew his head back, eyes closed, as he gathered the power within, the powercreated by those wicked women, those wonderful wicked women.They had considered him a pathetic wizard of little worth except as flesh andblood and gift to toy with—a sacrifice to a greater need.When he had time, he would go after the rest of them.With a more immediate task at hand, Nicholas dismissed those Sisters from hismind.Tonight, he would not merely watch through other eyes. Tonight, he would againgo with the spirits he cast.Tonight, he would not merely watch through other eyes. Tonight, his spirit wouldtravel to them.Nicholas opened his mouth as wide as it would go, his head rocking from side toside. The joined spirits within released a part of themselves into the bowl,whirling in a silken, silvery swirl lit with the soft glow of their link to thelife behind him, placekeepers for their journey, a stitch in the world holdingthe knot in the thread of their travels.His spirit, too, let slip a small portion to remain with his body, to drift inthe bowl with the others.Fragments of the five spirits revolved with the fragment of his, their light oflife glowing softly in this safe place as he prepared to journey. He cast hisown spirit away, then, leaving behind the husk of a body sitting on the floorbehind him as he fled out into the dark sky, borne on the wings of his investedpower.No wizard before had ever been able to do as he, to leave his body and have hisspirit soar to where his mind would send him. He raced through the night, fastas thought, to find what he hunted.He felt the rush of air flowing over feathers. As quick as that, he had racedaway through the night and was with them, pulling the five spirits along withhim.He summoned the dark forms into a circle with him, and, as they gathered around,cast the five spirits into them. His mouth was still open in a yawn that was nota yawn that back in a room somewhere distant let forth a cry to match the five.As they circled, he felt the rush of air beneath their wings, felt theirfeathers working the wind to direct them as effortlessly as his own thoughtdirected not only his spirit but the other five as well.He sent those five racing through the night, to the place where he had sent themen. They raced over hills, turning to scan the open country, to look out overthe barren land. The cloak of darkness felt cool, encasing him in obscure blacknight, obscure black feathers.He caught the scent of carrion, sharp, cloying, tantalizing, as the fivespiraled down toward the ground. Through their eyes that saw in the darknessNicholas saw then the scene below, a place littered with the dead. Others oftheir kind had gathered to feed in a frenzy of ripping and gorging.No. This was wrong. He didn’t see them.He had to find them.He willed his charges up from the gory feast, to search. Nicholas felt a pang ofurgency. This was his future that had slipped away from him—his treasureslipping through his grasp. He had to find them. Had to.He spurred his charges onward.This way, that way, over there. Look, look, look. Find them, find them. Look.Must find them. Look.This was not supposed to be. There had been enough men. No one could escape thatmany experienced men. Not when they came by stealth and attacked with surprise.They had been selected for their talents. They knew their business.Their bodies lay sprawled all about. Beak and claw ripped at them. Screeches ofexcitement. Hunger.No. Must find them.Up, up, up. Find them. He had to find them.He had suffered the agony of a new birth in those dark woods, those terriblewoods, with those terrible women. He would have his reward. He would not bedenied. Not now. Not after all that.Find them. Look, look, look. Find them.On powerful wings, he soared into the night. With eyes that saw in the dark, hesearched. With creatures that could catch the scent of prey at great distance,he tried for a whiff of them.Through the night they went, hunting. Hunting.There, there he saw their wagon. He recognized their wagon. Their big horses. Hehad seen it before—seen them with it before. His minions circled in close onnearly silent wings, dropping in closer to see what Nicholas sought.Not there. They weren’t there. A trick. It had to be a trick. A diversion. Notthere. They had sent the wagon away to trick him, to send him off their trail.With wings powered by anger, he soared up, up, up to search the countryside.Hunt, hunt. Find them. He flew with his five in an ever wider pattern to searchthe ground beneath the night. They flew on, searching, searching. His hunger wastheir hunger. Hunt for them. Hunt.The wings grew weary as he drove them onward. He had to find them. He would notallow rest. Not allow failure. He hunted in expanding swaths, searching,hunting, hunting.There, among the trees, he saw movement.It was only just dark. They wouldn’t see their pursuers—not in the dark—but hecould see them. He forced the five down, circling, circling, forced them inclose. He would not fail this time to see them, to get close enough. Circling,holding him there, circling, watching, circling, watching, seeing them there.It was her! The Mother Confessor! He saw others. The one with red hair and hersmall four-legged friend. Others, too. He must be there, too. Had to be there,too. He would be there, too, as the small group moved west.West. They moved west. They had traveled to the west of where he had seen themlast.Nicholas laughed. They were coming west. The captors sent for them all lay dead,but here they came anyway. They were coming west.Toward where he waited.He would have them.He would have Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor.Jagang would have them.It came to him, then—his reward. What he would have in return for the prizes hewould deliver.D’Hara.He would have the rule of D’Hara in return for these two paltry people. Jagangwould reward him with the rule of D’Hara, if he wanted those two. He would notdare deny Nicholas the Slide what he wanted. Not when he had what Jagang wantedmost, more than any other prize. Jagang would pay any price for these two.Pain. A scream. Shock, terror, confusion raged through him. He felt the wind,the wind that carried him so effortlessly, now ripping at him like fistssnatching at feathers as he tumbled in helpless pain.One of the five falling at blinding speed smacked the ground.Nicholas screamed. One of the five spirits had been lost with its host. Backsomewhere distant, in some far-off room with wooden walls and shutters andbloody stakes, back, back, back in another place he had almost forgottenexisted, back, back, back far away, a spirit was ripped from his control.One of the five back there had died at the same instant the race had crashed tothe ground.Scream of hot pain. Another tumbled out of control. Another spirit escaped hisgrasp into the waiting arms of death.Nicholas struggled to see in the confusion, forcing the remaining three to holdhis vision in place so he could see. Hunt, hunt, hunt. Where was he? Where washe? Where? He saw the others. Where was Lord Rahl?A third scream.Where was he? Nicholas fought to hold his vision despite the hot agony, thebewildering plummet.Pain ripped through a fourth.Before he could gather his senses, hold them together, force them with the powerof his will to do his bidding, two more spirits were yanked away into the voidof the underworld.Where was he?Talons at the ready, Nicholas searched.There! There!With violent effort, he forced the race over into a dive. There he was! There hewas! Up high. Higher than the rest. Somehow up high. Up on a ledge of rock abovethe rest. He wasn’t down there with them. He was up high.Dive for him. Dive down for him.There he was, bow drawn.Ripping pain tore through the last race. The ground rushed up at him. Nicholascried out. He tried frantically to stop the spinning. He felt the race slam intothe rock at frightening speed. But only for an instant.With a gasp, Nicholas drew a desperate breath. His head spun with the burningtorture of the abrupt return, an uncontrolled return not of his doing.He blinked, his mouth open wide in an attempt to let out a cry, but no soundcame. His eyes bulged with the effort, but no cry came. He was back. Whether ornot he wanted to be, he was back.He looked around at the room. He was back, that was the reason no cry came. Noscreech of a race joined his own. They were dead. All five.Nicholas turned to the four impaled on stakes behind him. All four were slumped.The fifth man lay slouched in the far corner. All five limp and still. All fivedead. Their spirits gone.The room was as silent as a crypt. The bowl before him glowed only with thefragment of his own spirit. He drew it back in.He sat in the stillness for a long time, waiting for his head to stop spinning.It had been a shock to be in a creature as it was killed—to have a spirit of aperson in him as they died. As five of them died. It had been a surprise.Lord Rahl was a surprising man. Nicholas hadn’t thought, back that first time,that he would be able to get all five. He had thought it was luck. A second timewas not luck. Lord Rahl was a surprising man.Nicholas could cast his spirit out again if he wanted, seek out new eyes, buthis head hurt and he didn’t feel up to it; besides, it didn’t matter. Lord Rahlwas coming west. He was coming to the great empire of Bandakar.Nicholas owned Bandakar.The people here revered him.Nicholas smiled. Lord Rahl was coming. He would be surprised at the kind of manhe found when he arrived. Lord Rahl probably thought he knew all manner of men.He did not know Nicholas the Slide.Nicholas the Slide, who would be emperor of D’Hara when he gave Jagang theprizes he sought most: the dead body of Lord Rahl, and the living body of theMother Confessor.Jagang would have them both for himself.And in return, Nicholas would have their empire."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29Ann heard the distant echo of footsteps coming down the long, empty, darkcorridor outside the far door to her forgotten vault under the People’s Palace,the seat of power in D’Hara. She was no longer sure if it was day or night.She’d lost track of time as she sat in the silent darkness. She saved the lampfor times when they brought food, or the times she wrote to Verna in the journeybook. Or the times she felt so alone that she needed the company of a smallflame, if nothing else.In this place, within this spell of a palace for those born Rahl, her power wasso diminished that it was all she could do to light that lamp.She feared to use the little lamp too often and run out of oil; she didn’t knowif they would give her more. She didn’t want to run out and only then find theywould give her no more. She didn’t want not to have at least the possibility ofthat small flame, that small gift of light.In the dark she could do nothing but consider her life and all she had worked sohard to accomplish. For centuries she had led the Sisters of the Light in theireffort to see the Creator’s light triumph in the world, and see the Keeper ofthe underworld kept where he belonged, in his own realm, the world of the dead.For centuries she had waited in dread of the time that prophecy said was nowupon them.For five hundred years she had waited for the birth of the one who had thechance to succeed in leading them in the struggle to see the Creator’s gift,magic, survive against those who would cast that light out of the world. Forfive hundred years she had worked to insure that he would have a chance to dowhat he must if he was to have a chance to stop the forces that would extinguishmagic.Prophecy said that only Richard had the chance to preserve their cause, to keepthe enemy from succeeding in casting a gray pall over mankind, the only one witha chance to prevent the gift from dying out. Prophecy did not say that he wouldprevail; prophecy said only that Richard was the only one to have a chance tobring them victory. Without Richard, all hope was lost—that much was sure. Forthis reason, Ann had been devoted to him long before he was born, before he roseup to become their leader.Kahlan saw all of Ann’s efforts as meddling, as tinkering with the lives ofothers. Kahlan believed that Ann’s efforts were in fact the cause of the verything she feared most. Ann hated that she sometimes thought that maybe Kahlanwas right. Maybe it was meant to be that Richard would be born and by his freewill alone would choose to do those things that would lead them to victory intheir battle to keep the gift among men. Zedd certainly believed that it wasonly by Richard’s mind, by his free will, by his conscious intent, that he couldlead them.Maybe it was true, and Ann, in trying to direct those things that could not beand should not be directed, had brought them all to the brink of ruin.The footsteps were coming closer. Maybe it was time to eat and they werebringing dinner. She wasn’t hungry.When they brought her food, they put it on the end of a long pole and thenthreaded that pole through the little opening in the outer door, all the wayacross the outer shielded room, through the opening in the second, inner door,and finally in to Ann. Nathan would risk no chance for escape by having herguards have to open her cell door merely to give her food.They passed in a variety of breads, meats, and vegetables along with waterskins.Although the food was good, she found no satisfaction in it. Even the finestfare could never be satisfying eaten in a dungeon.At times, as Prelate, she had felt as if she were a prisoner of her post. Shehad rarely gone to the dining hall where the Sisters of the Light hadeaten—especially in the later years. It put everyone on edge having the Prelateamong them at dinner. Besides, done too often it took the edge off theiranxiety, their discomposure, around authority.Ann believed that a certain distance, a certain worried respect, was necessaryin order to maintain discipline. In a place that had been spelled so that timeslowed for those living there, it was important to maintain discipline. Annappeared to be in her seventies, but with her aging process slowed dramaticallywhile living under the spell that had covered the Palace of the Prophets, shehad lived close to a thousand years.Of course, a lot of good her discipline had done her. Under her watch as Prelatethe Sisters of the Dark had infested her flock. There were hundreds of Sisters,and there was no telling just how many of them had taken dark oaths to theKeeper. The lure of his promises were obviously effective. Such promises were anillusion, but try to tell that to one so pledged. Immortality was seductive towomen who watched everyone they knew outside the palace grow old and die whilethey remained young.Sisters who had children saw those children sent out of the palace to be raisedwhere they could have a normal life, saw those children grow old and die, sawtheir grandchildren grow old and die. To a woman who saw such things, saw theconstant withering and death of those she knew while she herself all the timeseemed to remain young, attractive, and desirable, the offer of immortality grewincreasingly tempting when her own petals began to wilt.Growing old was a final stage, the end of a life. Growing old in the Palace ofthe Prophets was a very long ordeal. Ann had been old for centuries. Being youngfor a very long time was a wonderful experience, but being old for a very longtime was not—at least it was not for some. For Ann, it was life itself that waswonderful, not so much her age, and all she had learned. But not everyone feltthat way.Now that the palace had been destroyed, they would all age at the same rate aseveryone else. What had only a short time ago been a future of maybe anotherhundred years of life for Ann was suddenly perhaps no more than a blink of adecade—certainly not much more.But she doubted she would live all that long in such a dank hole, away fromlight and life.Somehow, it didn’t seem as if she and Nathan were close to a thousand years old.She didn’t know what it felt like to age at the normal rate outside the spell,but she believed she felt little different than those outside the palace felt asthey aged. She believed that the spell that slowed their aging also alteredtheir perception of time—to a degree, anyway.The footsteps were getting closer. Ann wasn’t looking forward to another meal inthis place. She was beginning to wish they would let her starve and get it overwith. Let her die.What good had her life been? When she really thought about it, what good had shereally accomplished? The Creator knew how she tried to guide Richard in whatneeded to be done, but in the end it seemed that it was Richard’s choice to actas he did, in most cases against what she thought needed to be done, that turnedout to be correct. Had she not tried to guide events, bring him to the Palace ofthe Prophets in the Old World, maybe nothing would have changed and that wouldhave been the way he was to save them all—by not having to act and lettingJagang and the Imperial Order eventually wither and die in the Old World, unableto spread their virulent beliefs beyond. Maybe she’d brought it all to ruin withher efforts alone.She heard the door at the end of the passageway to her cell scrape open. Shedecided that she wouldn’t eat. She wouldn’t eat again until Nathan came to speakwith her, as she had requested.Sometimes, with the food, they sent in wine. Nathan sent it in to vex her, shewas sure of that. From his confinement in the Palace of the Prophets, Nathan hadsometimes requested wine. Ann always saw the report when such a request wasmade; she declined every such request.Wizards were dangerous enough, prophets—who were wizards with the talent ofprophecy—were potentially vastly more dangerous, and drunken prophets were themost dangerous of all. Prophecy given out willy-nilly was an invitation tocalamity. Even simple prophecy escaping the confines of the stone walls of thePalace of the Prophets had started wars.Nathan had sometimes requested the company of women. Ann hated those requeststhe most, because she sometimes granted them. She felt she had to. Nathan hadlittle of life, confined as he was to his apartments, his only real crime beingthe nature of his birth, his abilities. The palace could easily afford the priceof a woman to sometimes visit him.He made a mockery of that, often enough—giving out prophecy that sent the womanfleeing before they could speak with her, before they could silence her.Those without the proper training were not meant to see prophecy. Prophecy waseasily misinterpreted by those without an understanding of its intricacies. Todivulge prophecy to the uninitiated was like casting fire into dry grass.Prophecy is not meant for the unenlightened.At the thought of the prophet being loose, Ann’s stomach tightened into a knot.Even so, she had sometimes secretly taken Nathan out herself, to go on importantjourneys with her—mostly journeys having to do with guiding some aspect ofRichard’s life, or, more accurately, trying to insure that Richard would be bornand have a life. Besides being trouble on two feet, Nathan was also a remarkableprophet who did have a sincere interest in seeing their side triumph. After all,he saw in prophecy the alternative, and when Nathan saw prophecy, he saw it inall its terrible truth.Nathan always wore a Rada’Han—a collar—that enabled her, or any Sister, tocontrol him, so taking him on those journeys wasn’t actually putting the worldat risk of the man. He had to do as she said, go where she said. Whenever shehad taken him out on a mission with her, he was not really free, since he wore aRada’Han and she could thus control him.Now he was without a Rada’Han. He was truly free.Ann didn’t want any supper. She resolved to turn it away when they passed thepole in to her. Let Nathan fret that she might refuse food altogether and diewhile under his fickle control. Ann folded her arms.Let him have that on his conscience. That would bring the man down to see her.Ann heard the footsteps come to a halt outside the far door. Muffled voicesdrifted in to her. Had she ready access to her Han, she would have been able toconcentrate her hearing toward those voices and easily hear their words. Shesighed. Even that ability was useless to her here, in this place, under thepower invoked by the spell form of the layout of the palace. It would hardlymake sense to create such elaborate plans to curtail another’s magic and allowthem to hear secrets whispered inside the walls.The outer door squealed in protest as it was pulled open. This was new. No onehad opened the outer door since the day they shut her in the place.Ann rushed to the door to her small room, to the faint square of light that wasthe opening in the iron door. She grabbed hold of the bars and pulled her faceup close, trying to see who was out there, what they were doing.Light blinded her. She staggered back a few steps, rubbing her eyes. She was soused to the dark that the harsh lantern light felt as if it had burned hervision with blazing light.Ann backed away from the door when she heard a key clattering in the lock. Thebolt threw back with a reverberating clang. The door grated open. Cool air,fresher than the stale air she was used to breathing, poured in. Yellow lightflooded around the room as the lantern was thrust into the room at the end of anarm encased in red leather. Mord-Sith."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30Ann squinted in the harsh glare as the Mord-Sith stepped over the sill andducked in through the doorway into the room. Unaccustomed to the lantern light,Ann at first could only discern the red leather outfit and the blond braid. Shedidn’t like to contemplate why one of the Lord Rahl’s elite corps of torturerswould be coming down to the dungeon to see her. She knew Richard. She could notimagine that he would allow such a practice to continue. But Richard wasn’there. Nathan seemed to be in charge.Squinting, Ann at last realized that it was the woman she had seen before: Nyda.Nyda, appraising Ann with a cool gaze, said nothing as she stepped to the side.Another person was following her in. A long leg wearing brown trousers steppedover the sill, followed by a bent torso folding through the opening. Rising upto full height, Ann saw with sudden surprise who it was.“Ann!” Nathan held his arms open wide, as if expecting a hug. “How are you? Nydagave me your message. They are treating you well, I trust?”Ann stood her ground and scowled at the grinning face. “I’m still alive, nothanks to you, Nathan.”She of course remembered how tall Nathan was, how broad were his shoulders. Now,standing before her, the top of his full head of long gray hair nearly touchingthe stone chisel marks in the ceiling, he looked even taller than sheremembered. His shoulders, filling up so much of the small room, looked evenbroader. He wore high boots over his trousers and a ruffled white shirt beneathan open vest. An elegant green velvet cape was attached at his right shoulder.At his left hip a sword in an elegant scabbard glimmered in the lamplight.His face, his handsome face, so expressive, so unlike any other, made Ann’sheart feel buoyant.Nathan grinned as no one but a Rahl could grin, a grin like joy and hunger andpower all balled together. He looked like he needed to sweep a damsel into hispowerful arms and kiss her without her permission.He waved a hand casually around at her accommodations. “But you are safe inhere, my dear. No one can harm you while under our care. No one can bother you.You have fine food—even wine now and again. What more could you want?”Fists at her side, Ann stormed forward at a pace that brought the Mord-Sith’sAgiel up into her fist, even though she stayed where she was. Nathan held hisground, held his smile, as he watched her come.“What more could I want!” Ann screamed. “What more could I want? I want to belet out! That’s what more I could want!”Nathan’s small, knowing smile cut her to her core. “Indeed,” he said, a singleword of quiet indictment.Standing in the stony silence of the dungeon, she could only stare up at him,unable to bring forth an argument that he would not throw back at her.Ann turned a glare on the Mord-Sith. “What message did you give him?”“Nyda said that you wanted to see me,” Nathan answered in her place. He spreadhis arms. “Here I am, as requested. What is it you wanted to see me about, mydear?”“Don’t patronize me, Nathan. You know very well what I wanted to see you about.You know why I’m here, in D’Hara—why I’ve come to the People’s Palace.”Nathan clasped his hands behind his back. His smile had finally lost itsusefulness.“Nyda,” he said, turning to the woman, “would you leave us alone for now.There’s a good girl.”Nyda appraised Ann with a brief glance. No more was needed; Ann was no threat toNathan. He was a wizard—no doubt he had told her that he was the greatest wizardof all time—and was within the ancestral home of the House of Rahl. He had noneed to fear this one old sorceress—not anymore, anyway.Nyda gave Nathan a if-you-need-me-I’ll-be-right-outside kind of look beforecontorting her perfect limbs through the doorway with fluid grace, the way a catwent effortlessly through a hedge.Nathan stood in the center of the cell, hands still clasped behind his uprightback, waiting for Ann to say something.Ann went to her pack, sitting on the far end of the stone bench that had beenher bed, her table, her chair. She flipped back the flap and reached inside,feeling around. Her fingers found the cold metal of the object she sought. Anndrew it out and stood over it, her shadow hiding it.Finally, she turned. “Nathan, I have something for you.”She lifted out a Rada’Han she had intended to put around his neck. Right then,she didn’t quite know how she had thought she could accomplish such a feat. Shewould have, though, had she put her mind to it; she was Annalina Aldurren,Prelate of the Sisters of the Light. Or, at least, she once had been. She hadgiven that job to Verna before feigning her and Nathan’s death.“You want me to put that collar around my neck?” Nathan asked in a calm voice.“That’s what you expect?”Ann shook her head. “No, Nathan. I want to give this to you. I’ve been doing alot of thinking while I’ve been down here. Thinking about how I’d probably neverleave my place of confinement.”“What a coincidence,” Nathan said. “I used to spend a great deal of timethinking that very same thought.”“Yes,” Ann said, nodding. “I expect you did.” She handed him the Rada’Han.“Here. Take this. I never want to see one of these again.“While I did what I thought best, I hated every minute of it, Nathan. I hated todo it to you, especially. I’ve come to think that my life has been a misguidedmess. I’m sorry I ever put you behind those shields and kept you a prisoner. IfI could live my life over again, I’d not do it the same way.“I expect no leniency; I showed you none.”“No,” Nathan said. “You didn’t.”His azure eyes seemed to be looking right into her. He had a way of doing that.Richard had inherited that same penetrating Rahl gaze.“So, you are sorry you kept me a prisoner all my life. Do you know why it waswrong, Ann? Are you even aware of the irony?”Almost against her better judgment, she heard herself ask, “What irony?”“Well,” he said as he shrugged, “what is it we’re fighting for?”“Nathan, you know very well what we’re fighting for.”“Yes, I do. But do you? Tell me, then, what it is we’re struggling to protect,to preserve, to insure remains alive?”“The Creator’s gift of magic, of course. We fight to see that it continues toexist in the world. We struggle for those who are born with it to live, for themto learn to use their ability to its full extent. We fight for each to have andto celebrate their unique ability.”“I think that’s kind of ironic, don’t you? The very thing you think is worthfighting for is what you feared. The Imperial Order proclaims that it’s not inthe best interest of mankind for a gifted individual to possess magic, so thatunique ability must be stripped away from them. They claim that, since all donot have this ability in identical and equal measure, it’s dangerous for some tohave it—that man must cast aside the belief that a man’s life is his own tolive. That those who were born with magic must therefore be expunged from theworld in order to make the world a better place for those who don’t have suchability.“And yet, you worked under that very premise, acted on those same wickedbeliefs. You locked me away because of my ability. You saw what I am able to do,that others cannot do, as an evil birthright that could not be allowed to beamong mankind.“And yet, you work to preserve that very thing which you fear in me—my uniqueability—in others. You work to allow everyone born with magic to have theinalienable right to their own life, to be the best of what they can be withtheir own ability ... and yet you locked me away to deny me that very sameright.”“Just because I want the Creator’s wolves to run free to hunt, as they wereintended, doesn’t mean that I want to be their dinner.”Nathan leaned toward her. “I am not a wolf. I am a human being. You tried,convicted, and sentenced me to life in your prison for being who I was born, forwhat you feared I might do, simply because I had the ability. You then soothedyour own inner conflict by making that prison plush in an attempt to convinceyourself that you were kind—all the while professing to believe that we mustfight to allow future people to be who they are.“You qualified your prison as right because it was lavish, in order to mask fromyourself the nature of what you were advocating. Look around, Ann.” He swept hisarm out at the stone. “This is what you were advocating for those you decideddid not have the right to their own life. You decided the same as the Order,based on an ability you did not like. You decided that some, because of theirgreater potential, must be sacrificed to the good of those less than they. Nomatter how you decorated your dungeon, this is what it looks like from theinside.”Ann gathered her thoughts, as well as her voice, before she spoke. “I thought Ihad come to understand something like that while I sat all alone down here, butI realize now that I hadn’t, really. All those years I felt bad for locking youaway, but I never really examined my rationale for doing so.“You’re right, Nathan. I believed you held the potential for great harm. Ishould have helped you to understand what was right so you could act rationally,rather than expect the worst from you and lock you away. I’m sorry, Nathan.”He put his hands on his hips. “Do you really mean it, Ann?”She nodded, unable to look up at him, as her eyes filled with tears. She alwaysexpected honesty from everyone else, but she had not been honest with herself.“Yes, Nathan, I really do.”Confession over, she went to her bench and slumped down. “Thank you for coming,Nathan. I’ll not trouble you to come down here again. I will take my justpunishment without complaint. If you don’t mind, I think I’d like to be aloneright now to pray and consider the weight on my heart.”“You can do that later. Now get up off your bottom, on your feet, and pick upyour things. We have matters to attend to and we have to get going.”Ann looked up with a frown. “What?”“We have important things to do. Come on, woman. We’re wasting time. We need toget going. We’re on the same side in this struggle, Ann. We need to act like itand work together toward preserving our causes.” He leaned down toward her.“Unless you’ve decided to retire to sit around the rest of your life. If not,then let’s be on our way. We have trouble.”Ann hopped down from the stone bench. “Trouble? What sort of trouble.”“Prophecy trouble.”“Prophecy? There is trouble with a prophecy? What trouble? What prophecy?”Fists on his hips, Nathan fixed her with a scowl. “I can’t tell you about suchthings. Prophecy is not meant for the unenlightened.”Ann pursed her lips, about to launch into scolding him up one side and down theother, when she caught the smile working at the edges of his mouth. It caughther up in a smile of her own.“What’s happened?” she asked in the tone of voice friends used when they haddecided that past wrongs were recognized and matters now set on a correct path.“Ann, you’ll not believe it when I tell you,” Nathan complained. “It’s that boy,again.”“Richard?”“What other boy do you know who can get in the kind of trouble only Richard canget into.”“Well, I no longer think of Richard as a boy.”Nathan sighed. “I suppose not, but it’s hard when you’re my age to think of oneso young as a man.”“He’s a man,” Ann assured him.“Yes, I guess he is.” Nathan grinned. “And, he’s a Rahl.”“What sort of trouble has Richard gotten himself into this time?”Nathan’s good humor evaporated. “He’s walked off the edge of prophecy.”Ann screwed up her face. “What are you talking about? What’s he done?”“I’m telling you, Ann, that boy has walked right off the edge of prophecyitself—walked right off into a place in prophecy where prophecy itself doesn’texist.”Ann recognized that Nathan was sincerely troubled, but he was making no sense.In part, that was why some people were afraid of him. He often gave people theimpression he was talking gibberish when he was talking about things that no onebut he could even understand. Sometimes no one but a prophet could trulyunderstand completely what he grasped. With his eyes, the eyes of a prophet, hecould see things that no one else could.She had spent a lifetime working with prophecy, though, and so she couldunderstand, perhaps better than most, at least some of his mind, some of what hecould grasp.“How can you know of such a prophecy, Nathan, if it doesn’t exist? I don’tunderstand. Explain it to me.”“There are libraries here, at the People’s Palace, that contain some valuablebooks of prophecy that I’ve never had a chance to see before. While I had reasonto suspect that such prophecies might exist, I was never certain they actuallydid, or what they might say. I’ve been studying them since I’ve been here andI’ve come across links to other known prophecy we had down in the vaults at thePalace of the Prophets. These prophecies, here, fill in some important gaps inthose we already know about.“Most importantly, I found an altogether new branch of prophecy I’ve never seenbefore that explains why and how I’ve been blind to some of what’s been goingon. From studying the forks and inversions off of this branch, I’ve discoveredthat Richard has taken a series of links that follow down a particular pathwayof prophecy that leads to oblivion, to something that, as far as I can tell,doesn’t even exist.”One hand on a hip, the other tracing invisible lines in the air, Nathan pacedthe small room as he talked. “This new link alludes to things I’ve never seenbefore, branches that I’ve always known must be there, but were missing. Thesebranches are exceedingly dangerous prophecies that have been kept here, insecret. I can see why. Even I, had I seen them years ago, might havemisinterpreted them. These new branches refer to voids of some sort. Since theyare voids, their nature can’t be known; such a contradiction can’t exist.“Richard has gone into this area of void, where prophecy can’t see him, can’thelp him, and worse, can’t help us. But more than not seeing him with prophecy,it’s as if where he is and what he is doing do not exist.“Richard is dealing in something that is capable of ending everything we know.”Ann knew that Nathan would not exaggerate about something of this nature. Whileshe was in the dark about precisely what he was talking about, the essence of itgave her the cold sweats.“What can we do about it?”Nathan threw up his arms. “We have to go in there and get him. We have to bringhim back into the world that exists.”“You mean, the world that prophecy says exists.”Nathan’s scowl was back. “That’s what I said, isn’t it? We have to somehow gethim back on the thread of prophecy where he shows up.”Ann cleared her throat. “Or?”Nathan snatched up the lamp, then her pack. “Or, he will cease to be part ofviable lines of prophecy, never to be involved with matters of this worldagain.”“You mean, if we don’t get him back from wherever his is, he will die?”Nathan gave her a curious look. “Have I been talking to the walls? Of course hewill die! If that boy isn’t in prophecy, if he breaks all the links to prophecywhere he plays a role, then he voids all those lines of prophecy where heexists. If he does that, then they become false prophecy and those branches withword of him will never come to pass. None of the other links contain anyreference to him—because in the origin of those links, he dies, first.”“And what happens on those links that don’t contain him?”Nathan took up her hand as he pulled her toward the door. “On those links, ashadow falls over everyone. Everyone who lives, anyway. It will be a very longand very dark age.”“Wait,” Ann said, pulling him to a halt.She returned to the stone bench and placed the Rada’Han in the center. “I don’thave the power to destroy this. I think maybe it should be locked away.”Nathan nodded his approval. “We will lock the doors and instruct the guards thatit is to remain in here, behind the shields, for all time.”Ann held a warning finger up before him. “Don’t get the idea that just becauseyou’re not wearing a collar I will tolerate misbehavior.”Nathan’s grin returned. He didn’t come right out and agree. Before he wentthrough the door, he turned back to her.“By the way, have you been talking to Verna through your journey book?”“Yes, a little. She’s with the army and pretty busy, right now. They’redefending the passes into D’Hara. Jagang has begun his siege.”“Well, from what I’ve been able to gather from military commanders here, at thepalace, the passes are formidable and will hold for a while, at least.” Heleaned toward her. “You have to send a message to her, though. Tell her thatwhen an empty wagon rolls into their line, to let it through.”Ann made a face. “What does that mean?”“Prophecy is not meant for the unenlightened. Just tell her.”“All right,” Ann said with breathless difficulty as Nathan pulled her throughthe tight doorway. “But I’d best not tell her you’re the one who said it, or shewill likely ignore the advice. She thinks you’re daft, you know.”“She just never got a chance to come to know me very well, that’s all.” Heglanced back. “What with me being unjustly locked away, and all.”Ann wanted to say that perhaps Verna knew Nathan all too well, but decidedbetter of it right then. As Nathan started to turn toward the outer door, Annsnatched his sleeve.“Nathan, what else about this prophecy you found aren’t you telling me? Thisprophecy where Richard disappears into oblivion.”She knew Nathan well enough to know by his agitation that he hadn’t told hereverything, that he thought he was being gallant by sparing her worry. With asober expression, he gazed into her eyes for a time before he finally spoke.“There is a Slide on that fork of prophecy.”Ann frowned as she turned her eyes up in thought. “A Slide. A Slide,” shemuttered to herself, trying to recall the name. It sounded familiar. “ASlide...” She snapped her fingers. “A Slide.” Her eyes went wide. “DearCreator.”“I don’t think the Creator had anything to do with this.”Ann impatiently waved in protest. “That can’t be. There has to be somethingwrong with this new prophecy you found. It has to be defective. Slides werecreated in the great war. There couldn’t be a Slide on this link ofprophecy—don’t you see? The prophecy must be out of phase and long ago expired.”Ann chewed her lower lip as her mind raced.“It isn’t out of phase. Don’t you think that was my first thought, too? Youthink me an amateur at this? I worked through the chronology a hundred times. Iran every chart and calculation I ever learned—even some I invented for thetask. They all came out with the same root. Every link came out in order. Theprophecy is in phase, chronology, and all its aspects are aligned.”“Then it’s a false link,” Ann insisted. “Slides were conjured creatures. Theywere sterile. They couldn’t reproduce.”“I’m telling you,” Nathan growled, “there is a Slide on this fork with Richardand it’s a viable prophetic link.”“They couldn’t have survived to be here.” Ann was sure of what she was saying.Nathan knew more about prophecy than she, there was no doubt of that, but thiswas one area where she knew exactly what she was talking about—this was her areaof expertise. “Slides weren’t able to beget children.”He was giving her one of those looks she didn’t like. “I’m telling you, a Slidewalks the world again.”Ann tsked. “Nathan, soul stealers can’t reproduce.”“The prophecy says he wasn’t born, but born again a Slide.”Ann’s flesh began to tingle. She stared at him a time before finding her voice.“For three thousand years there have been no wizards born with both sides of thegift but Richard. There is no way anyone...”Ann paused. He was watching her, watching her finally realize what had to be.“Dear Creator,” she whispered.“I told you, the Creator had nothing to do with this. The Sisters of the Darkmothered him.”Shaken to her core, Ann could think of nothing to say.There was no worse news she could have heard.There was no defense against a Slide.Every soul was naked to a Slide’s attack.Outside the second door, Nyda waited in the hall, her face as grim as ever, butnot as grim as Ann’s. The hall was dark but for the dim light coming from thestill flames of a few candles. No breath of wind ever made it this deep into thepalace. The only color among the dark rock soaking up that small bit of lightwas the blood red of Nyda’s red leather.Being pulled along by the hand, feeling a jumble of emotions, Ann leaned towardthe woman and vented a pent-up fiery scowl. “You told him what I said to tellhim, didn’t you?”“Of course,” Nyda answered as she fell into step behind the two of them.Turning halfway around, Ann shook a finger at the Mord-Sith. “I’ll make yousorry you told him.”Nyda smiled. “Oh, I don’t think so.”Ann rolled her eyes and turned back to Nathan. “By the way, what are you doingwearing a sword? You, of all people—a wizard. Why are you wearing a sword?”Nathan looked hurt. “Why, Nyda thinks I look dashing with a sword.”Ann fixed her eyes on the dark passageway ahead. “I just bet she does.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31Standing at the edge of a narrow rim of rock, Richard looked down on the raggedgray wisps of clouds below. Out in the open, the cool damp air that drifted overhim carried the aromas of balsam trees, moss, wet leaves, and saturated soil. Heinhaled deeply the fragrant reminders of home. The rock, mostly granite, crackedand weather-worn into pillowed blocks, looked much the same as that in hisHartland woods. The mountains, however, were far larger. The slope rising upbehind him was dizzying.To the west before him, far below, lay a vast stretch of fractured ground andever-rising rugged hills carpeted in forests. To his left and right, because heknew what he was looking for, he could just make out the strip of ground, devoidof trees, where the boundary had been. Farther off to the west rose up thelesser mountains, mostly barren, that bordered the wasteland. That wasteland,and the place called the Pillars of Creation, was no longer visible. Richard washappy to have left it far behind.The sky was empty of black-tipped races—for the moment, anyway. The huge birdsmost likely knew that Richard, Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, Tom, and Owen were headingwest.Richard had shot the last five races as they had begun gathering in theircircling behavior, surprising them by being high up the side of the mountainabove the others in his group, closer to where the races flew. After killing theraces, Richard had led the rest of his small company into denser woods. Hedidn’t think that the races they’d been seeing up until then had spotted themsince. Now that they were traveling through forests of towering trees Richardthought that, if he was careful, they might be able to lose their watchers.If this man, Nicholas, had seen them through the eyes of those five races, thenhe knew they had been headed west. But, now that they were hidden, he couldn’tassume that they would continue west. If Richard could disappear from where thebirds would look for him, and failed to appear where they would expect him, thenNicholas might have second thoughts. He might realize they could have changeddirection and gone north, or south. Nicholas might then begin to realize thatthey had used that period of confusion to run away somewhere else, to flee him.It was possible that Richard could keep them hidden under the cover of the treesand in so doing keep Nicholas from discovering them. Richard didn’t want the manto know where they’d gone, or to have any idea where they were at any giventime. It was hardly a certainty that he could deceive Nicholas in this way, butRichard intended to try.Shielding his eyes with the flat of his hand, Richard scanned the rise of denseforest before them in order to get the lay of the land fixed in his mind beforehe headed back in under the thick vegetation where the others waited. Thetrailers of clouds below were but the tattered castoffs of the churning blanketof gloom above them. The mountainside ascended sharply into that wet overcast.As Richard evaluated the rock, the slope, and the trees, he finally found whathe sought. He studied the ascent of the mountain one last time before scanningthe sky again to make sure it was clear. Seeing no races—or any other birds, forthat matter—he headed in to where the others waited. He knew that just becausehe didn’t see any birds didn’t mean that they weren’t there watching him. Therecould be a few dozen races sitting in trees where he would likely never spotthem. But, for the moment, he was still where they would expect him, so hewasn’t greatly concerned.He was about to do what they would not expect.Richard climbed back up the slick bank of moss, leaves, and wet roots. If hefell, he would have only the one chance to grab the small ledge where he’d beenstanding before he would tumble out into the clear air and a drop of severalthousand feet. The thought of that drop made him hold tighter to the roots tohelp him climb, and made him test carefully every score in the rock where heplaced his boot before committing his weight to it.At the top of the bank he ducked under overhanging branches of scrawny mountainmaple that grew in the understory of hardwoods leaning out beside the toweringpines in an effort to capture the light. Leaves of the ash and birch risingabove the mountain maple collected the drizzle, until their leaves had as muchas they could hold and released it to patter down in fat drops that slapped thelower leaves above Richard’s head. When a light breeze caught those upperleaves, they released their load to rain down in sudden but brief torrents.Stooping under low-spreading branches of fir trees, Richard followed his trackback through thickets of huckleberry into the more open ground of the hushedwoods beneath the thick canopy of ancient evergreens. Pine needles had beenwoven by the wind into sprawling mats that cushioned his steps. Spiraling webshung by spiders to catch the small bugs that zigzagged all about had insteadnetted the mist and were now dotted with shimmering drops of water, like jewelednecklaces on display.Back in the sheltering cover of rock and the thick growth of young spruce,Kahlan stood when she saw Richard coming. When she stood, everyone else then sawhim, and came to their feet as well. Richard ducked in under the wispy greenbranches.“Did you see any races, Lord Rahl?” Owen asked, clearly nervous about thepredators.“No,” Richard told him as he picked up his pack and slung it over a shoulder. Heslipped his other arm beneath the second strap as he pulled the pack up onto hisback. “That doesn’t mean they didn’t see me, though.”Richard hooked his bow over the back of his left shoulder, along with awaterskin.“Well,” Owen said, wringing his hands, “we can still hope they won’t know wherewe are.”Richard paused to look at the man. “Hope is not a strategy.”As the rest of them all started collecting their things from the brief break,hooking gear on belts and shouldering packs, Richard drew Cara by the arm out ofthe cover of small trees and pulled her close.“See that rise through there?” he asked as he held her near him so she could seewhere he was pointing. “With the strip of open ground that passes in front ofthe young oak with the broken dead limb hanging down?”Cara nodded. “Just after where the ground rises and goes over that trickle ofwater running down the face of the rock, staining it green?”“That’s the spot. I want you to follow up over that area, then cut to the right,taking that cleft up—that one there beyond the split in the rock, there—and seeif you can scout a trail up to the next shelf up above these trees here.”Cara nodded. “Where will you be?”“I’m going to take the rest of us up to the first break in the slope. We’ll bethere. Come back and tell us if you find a way over the projection.”Cara hoisted up her pack onto her back and then picked up the stout staffRichard had cut for her.“I didn’t know that Mord-Sith could cut trails,” Tom said.“Mord-Sith can’t,” Cara said. “I, Cara, can. Lord Rahl taught me.”As she vanished into the trees, Richard watched her walk. She moved gracefully,disturbing little as she made her way into the trackless woods. She moved withan economy of effort that would conserve her energy. It had not always been so;she had learned well the lessons he had given her. Richard was pleased to seethat the lessons had stuck and his efforts had not been wasted.Owen came forward, looking agitated. “But Lord Rahl, we can’t go that way.” Hewaggled a hand back over his shoulder. “The trail goes that way. That is theonly way up and through the pass. There lies the way down, and with it the wayback up, now that the boundary is gone. It’s not easy, but it’s the only way.”“It’s the only way you know of. By how well that trail looks to be traveled, Ithink it’s the only way Nicholas knows of as well. It appears to be the way theOrder troops move in and out of Bandakar.“If we go that way the races will be watching. If, on the other hand, we don’tshow up, then he won’t know where we went. I want to keep it that way from nowon. I’m tired of playing mouse to his owl.”Richard let Kahlan lead them up through the woods, following the natural routeof the land when the way ahead was reasonably evident. When she was in doubt shewould glance back at him for direction. Richard would look where she was to go,or nod in the direction he wanted her to take, or, in a few cases, he needed togive her instruction.By the lay of the land, Richard was pretty sure that there was an ancient trailup through the mountain pass. That pass, that from afar looked like a notch inthe wall of mountains, was in reality no mere notch but a broad area twisting asit rose back up between the mountains. Richard didn’t think that the path thatthe Bandakar people used to banish people through the boundary was the only waythrough that pass. With the boundary in place it may well have been, but theboundary was no longer there.From what he’d seen so far, Richard suspected that there once had been a routethat in ancient times had been the main way in and out. Here and there he wasable to discern depressions that he believed were remnants of that ancient,abandoned route.While it was always possible that the old passage had been abandoned for goodreason, such as a landslide that made it impassable, he wanted to know if thatonce traveled way was still usable. It would, at the least, since it was in adifferent part of the mountains than the known path, take them away from wherethe races were likely to be looking for them.Jennsen walked up close beside Richard when the way through towering pines wasopen enough. She tugged Betty along by her rope, keeping her from stopping tosample plants along the way.“Sooner or later the races will find us, don’t you think?” Jennsen asked. “Imean, if we don’t show up where they expect to find us, then don’t you thinkthey will search until they do find us? You were the one who said that from thesky they could cover great distances and search us out.”“Maybe,” Richard said. “But it will be hard to spot us in the woods if we useour heads and stay hidden. In forests they can’t search nearly as much area asthey could in the same amount of time out in the wasteland. In open ground theycould spot us miles away. Here, they will have a hard time of it unless they’rereally close and we are careless.“By the time we don’t show up where the known trail makes it up into Bandakar,they will have a vast area they suddenly will need to search and they won’t haveany idea which direction to look. That compounds the problem for them in findingus.“I don’t think that the viewing Nicholas gets through their eyes can be verygood, or he wouldn’t need to gather the races now and again to circle. If we canstay out of sight long enough, then we’ll be among the people up in Bandakar andthen Nicholas, through the eyes of the races, will have a hard, if notimpossible, time picking us out from others.”Jennsen thought it over as they entered a stand of birch. Betty went the wrongway around a tree and Jennsen had to stop to untangle her rope. They all hunchedtheir shoulders against the wet when a breeze brought down a soaking shower.“Richard,” Jennsen asked in a voice barely above a whisper as she caught back upwith him, “what are you going to do when we get there?”“I’m going to get the antidote so I don’t die.”“I know that.” Jennsen pulled a sodden ringlet of red hair back from her face.“What I mean is, what are you going to do about Owen’s people?”Each breath he drew brought a slight stitch of pain deep in his lungs. “I’m notsure, yet, just what I can do.”Jennsen walked in silence for a moment. “But you will try to help them, won’tyou?”Richard glanced over at his sister. “Jennsen, they’re threatening to kill me.They’ve proven that it isn’t an empty threat.”She shrugged uncomfortably. “I know, but they’re desperate.” She glanced aheadto make sure that Owen wouldn’t hear. “They didn’t know what else to do to savethemselves. They aren’t like you. They never fought anyone before.”Richard took a deep breath, the pain pulling tight across his chest when he didso. “You’d never fought anyone before, either. When you thought I was trying tokill you, as our father had, and you believed that I was responsible for yourmother’s death, what did you do? I don’t mean were you correct about me, butwhat did you do in response to what you believed was happening?”“I resolved that if I wanted to live I would have to kill you before you killedme.”“Exactly. You didn’t poison someone and tell them to do it or they would die.You decided that your life was worth living and that no one else had the rightto take it from you.“When you are willing to meekly sacrifice your ultimate value, your life, theonly one you will ever have, to any thug who on a whim decides to take it fromyou, then you can’t be helped. You may be able to be rescued for one day, butthe next day another will come and you will again willingly prostrate yourselfbefore him. You have placed the value of the life of your killer above your own.“When you grant to anyone who demands it the right of life or death over you,you have already become a willing slave in search of any butcher who will haveyou.”She walked in silence for a time, thinking about what he’d said. Richard noticedthat she moved through the woods as he had taught Cara to move. She was nearlyas at home in the woods as he was.“Richard.” Jennsen swallowed. “I don’t want those people to be hurt any more.They’ve already suffered enough.”“Tell that to Kahlan if I die from their poison.”When they reached the meeting place, Cara wasn’t there yet. They all were readyfor a brief rest. The spot, a break in the slope back against granite that roseup steeply to the next projection in the mountain, was protected high overheadby huge pines and closer down by brush. After so long out in the heat of thedesert, none of them were yet accustomed to the wet chill. While they spread outto find rocks for seats so they wouldn’t have to sit in the wet leaf litter,Betty happily sampled the tasty weeds. Owen sat to the far side, away fromBetty.Kahlan sat close to Richard on a small lump of rock. “How are you doing? Youlook like you have a headache.”“Nothing to be done about it for now,” he said.Kahlan leaned closer. The warmth of her felt good against his side.“Richard,” she whispered, “remember Nicci’s letter?”“What about it?”“Well, we assumed that this boundary into Bandakar being down was the reason forthe first warning beacon. Maybe we’re wrong.”“What makes you think so?”“No second beacon.” She pointed with her chin off to the northwest. “We saw thefirst way back down there. We’re a lot closer to the place where the boundarywas and we haven’t spotted a second beacon.”“Just as well,” he said. “That was where the races were waiting for us.”He remembered well when they found the little statue. The races were perched intrees all around. Richard hadn’t known what they were at the time, other thanthey were large birds he’d never seen before. The instant Cara picked up thestatue, the black-tipped races had all suddenly taken to wing. There had beenhundreds.“Yes,” Kahlan said, “but without the second beacon, maybe this isn’t the problemthat we thought caused the first.”“You’re assuming that the second beacon will be for me—that I’m the one it willbe meant for and so we would have seen it. Nicci said that the second beacon isfor the one who has the power to fix the breach in the seal. Maybe that’s notme.”Looking at first startled by the idea, Kahlan thought it over. “I’m not sure ifI’d be pleased about that or not.” She leaned tighter against him and hooked anarm around his thigh. “But no matter who is meant to be the one who can seal thebreach again, the one who’s supposed to restore the boundary, I don’t think theywill be able to do so.”Richard ran his fingers back through his wet hair. “Well, if I’m the one thisdead wizard once believed could restore the boundary, he’s wrong. I don’t knowhow to do such a thing.”“But don’t you see, Richard? Even if you did know how, I don’t think you could.”Richard looked at her out of the corner of his eye. “Jumping to conclusions andletting your imagination get carried away, again?”“Richard, face it, the boundary failed because of what I did. That’s why thewarning beacon was for me—because I caused the seal to fail. You aren’t going totry to deny that, are you?”“No, but we have a lot to learn before we know what’s really going on.”“I freed the chimes,” she said. “It’s not going to do us any good to try to hidefrom that fact.”Kahlan had used ancient magic to save his life. She had freed the chimes inorder to heal him. She’d had no time to spare; he would have died within momentsif she had not acted.Moreover, she’d had no idea that the chimes would unleash destruction upon theworld. She hadn’t known they had been created three thousand years before fromunderworld powers as a weapon designed to consume magic. She had been told onlythat she must use them to save Richard’s life.Richard knew what it felt like to be convinced of the facts behind events and tohave no one believe him. He knew she was now feeling that same frustration.“You’re right that we can’t hide from it—if it is a fact. But right now we don’tknow that it is. For one thing, the chimes have been banished back to theunderworld.”“And what about what Zedd told us, about how once the destructive cascade ofmagic begins—which it did—then there is no telling if it can be stopped even ifthe chimes are banished. There is no experience in such an event upon which tobase predictions.”Richard didn’t have an answer for her, and was at a disadvantage because hedidn’t have her education in magic. He was saved from having to speculate whenCara came in through a tight patch of young balsam trees. She pulled her packoff her shoulders and let it slip to the ground as she sat on a rock facingRichard.“You were right. We can get through there. It looks to me like I can see a wayto continue on up from the ledge.”“Good,” Richard said as he stood. “Let’s get going. The clouds are gettingdarker. I think we need to find a place to stop for the night.”“I spotted a place under the ledge, Lord Rahl. I think it might be a dry placeto stay.”“Good.” Richard hoisted her pack. “I’ll carry this for you for a while, let youhave a break.”Cara nodded her appreciation, falling into line as they moved through the tighttrees and immediately had to start to climb up the steeply rising ground. Therewas enough exposed rock and roots to provide good steps and handholds. Wheresome of those steps were tall, Richard stretched down to give Kahlan a hand.Tom helped Jennsen and passed Betty up a few times, even though the goat wasbetter at scrambling up over rock than they were. Richard thought he was doingit more for Jennsen’s peace of mind than Betty’s. Jennsen finally told Tom thatBetty could climb on her own.Betty proved her right, bleating down at Tom after effortlessly clambering up aparticularly trying spot.“Why don’t you help me up, then,” Tom said to the goat.Jennsen smiled along with Richard and Kahlan. Owen just watched as he skirtedthe other way around the rock. He was afraid of Betty. Cara finally asked forher pack back, having entertained long enough the possibility of beingconsidered frail.Shortly after the rain started, they found the low slit of an opening under aprominent ledge, just as Cara had said they would. It wasn’t a cave, but a spotwhere a slab from the face of the mountain above had broken off and fallen over.Boulders on the ground held the slab up enough to create a pocket beneath. Itwasn’t large, but Richard thought they would all fit under it for the night.The ground was dirty, scattered with collected leaf litter and forest debris ofbark, moss, and a lot of bugs. Tom and Richard used branches they’d cut toquickly sweep the place out. They then laid down a clean bed of evergreen boughsto keep them up off the water that did run in.The rain was starting to come down harder, so they all squatted down and hurriedto move in under the rock. It wasn’t a comfortable-looking spot, being too lowfor them to stand in, but it was fairly dry.Richard dared not let them have a fire, now that they had left the regulartrail, lest the smoke be spotted by the races. They had a cold supper of meats,leftover bannock, and dried goods. They were all exhausted from climbing allday, and while they ate engaged in only a bit of small talk. Betty was the onlyone with enough room to stand. She pushed up against Richard until she got hisattention and a rub.As darkness slowly enveloped the woods, they watched the rain fall outside theircozy shelter, listening to the soft sound, all no doubt wondering what lay aheadin a strange empire that had been sealed away for three thousand years. Troopsfrom the Imperial Order would be there, too.As Richard sat watching out into the dark rain, listening to the sounds of theoccasional animal in the distance, Kahlan cuddled up beside him, laying her headon his lap. Betty went deeper into the shelter and lay down with Jennsen.Kahlan, under the comfort of his hand resting tenderly on her shoulder, wasasleep in moments. As weary as he was from the day’s hard journey, Richardwasn’t sleepy.His head hurt and the poison deep within him made each breath catch. He wonderedwhat would strike him down first, the power of his gift that was giving him theheadaches, or Owen’s poison.He wondered, too, just how he was going to satisfy the demands of Owen and hismen to free their empire so that he could have the antidote. The five of them,he, Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, and Tom, hardly seemed the army needed to drive theOrder out of Bandakar.If he didn’t, and if he couldn’t get to the antidote, his life was coming to aclose. This very well could be his final journey.It seemed like he had just gotten back together with Kahlan after beingseparated from her for half his life. He wanted to be with her. He wanted thetwo of them to be able to be alone.If he didn’t think of something, all they had in each other, all they had aheadof them, was just about over. And that was without even considering theheadaches of the gift.Or the Imperial Order capturing the Wizard’s Keep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32Richard gripped the edge of the rock at the face of the opening to help pullhimself up and out from the dark hole in the abrupt rise of granite before them.Once out, he brushed the sharp little granules of rock from his hands as heturned to the others.“It goes through. It isn’t easy, but it goes through.”He saw a dubious look on Tom’s face, and a look of consternation on Owen’s.Betty, her floppy ears perked ahead in what Richard thought could only be a goatfrown, peered down into the narrow chasm and bleated.“But I don’t think we can,” Owen complained. “What if...”“We get stuck?” Richard asked.Owen nodded.“Well, you have an advantage over Tom and me,” Richard said as he picked up hispack from nearby to the side where he’d left it. “You’re not quite as big. If Imade it through and back, then you can make it, Owen.”Owen waved a hand up the steep ascent to his right. “But what about that way?Couldn’t we just go around?”“I don’t like going into dark, narrow places like this, either,” Richard said.“But if we go around that way we have to go out on the ledges. You heard whatCara said; it’s narrow and dangerous. If it were the only way it would beanother matter, but it’s not.“The races could spot us out there. Worse, if they wanted, they could attack usand we could easily fall or be forced over the edge. I don’t like going inplaces like this, but I don’t think I’d like to be out there on a windblownledge no wider than the sole of my boot, with a fall of thousands of feetstraight down if I make one slip, and then have one of those races suddenly showup to rip into me with their talons or those sharp beaks of theirs. Would youprefer that?”Owen licked his lips as he bent at the waist and looked into the narrowpassageway. “Well, I guess you’re right.”“Richard,” Kahlan asked in a whisper as the rest of them started taking offtheir packs so they could more easily fit through, “if this was a trail, as yoususpect, why isn’t there a better way through?”“I think that sometime only in the last few thousand years this huge section ofthe mountain broke away and slid down, coming to rest at this angle, leaving anarrow passageway beneath it.” He pointed up. “See up there? I think this entireportion down here used to be up there. I think it’s now sitting right where thetrail used to be.”“And there’s no other way but this cave or the ledges?”“I’m not saying that. I believe there’s other old routes, but we would have tobacktrack for most of a day to take the last fork I saw, and then there isn’tany guarantee with that one, either. If you really want, though, we can go backand try.”Kahlan shook her head. “We can’t afford to lose any time. We need to get to theantidote.”Richard nodded. He didn’t know how he was supposed to rid an entire empire ofthe Imperial Order so they could get to the antidote, but he had a few ideas. Heneeded to get the antidote; he saw no reason he had to play by Owen’s rules—orthe Order’s.Kahlan gave the narrow, dark tunnel another look. “You’re sure there aren’t anysnakes in there?”“I didn’t see any.”Tom handed Richard his sword. “I’ll go last,” he said. “If you make it through,I can.”Richard nodded as he laid the baldric over his shoulder. He turned the scabbardat his hip in order to clear the rock and then started in. He hugged his pack tohis abdomen as he crouched to make it into the small space. The slab of rockabove him lay at an angle, so that he couldn’t remain upright, but had to twistsideways and back as he went into the darkness. The farther in he went, thedarker it became. As the others followed him into the narrow passage, it blockedmuch of the light, making it even darker.The rains of recent days had finally ended, but runnels and runoff continued toflow from the mountain. Their wading through ankle-deep water standing in thebottom of the cavern sent echoes through the narrow confines. The waves in thewater played gloomy light along the wet walls, providing at least someillumination.The thought occurred to him that if he was a snake, this would make a good spotto call home. The thought also occurred to him that if Kahlan, right behind him,happened upon a snake in such cramped quarters, she would not be pleased withhim in the least for taking her in.Things that were frightening outside were different when you couldn’t maneuver,couldn’t run. Panic always seemed to lurk in tight places.As it became darker, Richard had to feel his way along the cold stone. In placeswhere water seeped down the rock, the walls were slimy. In some spots there wasmud, in other places dry rock to walk on. Most of it, though, was wet muck.Spongy leaves had collected in some of the irregular low places.By the smell, it was obvious that some animal had died and was decomposingsomewhere in the sodden grotto. He heard moans and complaints from behind whenthe rest of them encountered the stench. Betty bleated her unhappiness.Jennsen’s echoing whisper told the goat to be quiet.Even the displeasure of the smell was forgotten as they worked their way underthe immense curtain of rock draped over where the trail used to be. This wasn’ta true cave, like underground caves Richard had encountered before. It was onlya narrow crack under what was, in essence, a big rock. There were no chambersand different routes to worry about; there was only one narrow void under therock, so lighting their way wasn’t critical. He knew, too, that it wasn’t allthat long. It only felt that way in the dark.Richard reached the spot where the way ahead abruptly started up at a steepangle. Feeling the walls all around to find places to grab, he started thedifficult climb. In places he had to wedge his back against one wall and use hisfeet against the opposite wall to brace himself while grappling for any ledge orcrack in the rock he could find to help pull himself up. He had to balance hispack in his lap as he went, and keep his sword from getting wedged. It was slowgoing.Richard finally reached the high table where the rock from above had first comedown. The hollow left under the mountain of rock was basically horizontal,rather than vertical, as it had been. Rock rested along the edge of most of theshelf, but there was one place with ample room for them to make it through, overthe edge and then in under the slab above them. Once up onto the flat, he leanedover as far as he could, extending a hand down to help Kahlan.He heard the grunts of effort from below Kahlan as the rest of the small companyworked their way up the precipitous passage.From his place atop the table of rock, Richard could finally see light ahead andlight above. He had scouted the route and knew that they were close to being outthe other side, but first they had to make it across the shelf of rock where theslab left little room above them. It was uncomfortably confining.Richard didn’t like such places. He knew, though, that there was no other waythrough. This was the place he worried most about. Tight as it was, it wasfortunately close to the end.“We have to crawl on our bellies from here,” he told Kahlan. “Hold my ankle.Have everyone behind do the same.”Kahlan peered ahead toward the light coming from the opening. The glare of thatlight made it difficult to see to the sides. “Richard, it doesn’t look bigenough. It’s just a crack.”Richard pushed his pack out onto the rock. “There’s a way. We’ll be out soon.”Kahlan let out a deep breath. “All right. The sooner the better.”“Listen to me,” he called back into the darkness. “We’re almost out.”“If you make us walk through any more rotting animals, I’ll clobber you,”Jennsen called up to him. Everyone laughed.“No more of that,” Richard said. “But there is a difficult spot ahead. I’ve beenthrough it, so I know we can all make it. But you have to listen to me and do asI say. Crawl on your stomach, pushing your pack ahead of you. Hold the ankle ofthe person in front of you. That way you’ll all follow in the right place.“You’ll see the light ahead of you. You can’t go toward the light. That isn’tthe way out. The ceiling drops down too low and the slope of the rock startspitching down to the left. If you slip down in there it gets even tighter;you’ll not be able to get out. We have to go around the low place in theceiling. We have to go around on the right side, where it’s dark, but not aslow. Does everyone understand?”Agreement echoed up from the darkness.“Richard,” Jennsen called in a small voice, “I don’t like being in here. I wantout.”Her voice carried a thread of panic.“I don’t either,” he told her. “But I’ve been through and out the other side. Imade it through and back. You’ll be fine. Just follow me and you won’t have aproblem.”Her voice drifted up to him from the darkness. “I want to go back.”Richard couldn’t let her go back. The ledges, where they were exposed to theraces, were too dangerous.“Here,” Kahlan told her, “you come ahead of me. Take hold of Richard’s ankle andyou’ll be out before the rest of us.”“I’ll see that Betty watches you go through and follows,” Tom offered.That seemed to break the impasse. Jennsen moved up to the ledge and handed herpack up. Richard, lying on his stomach in the low slit of the shelf, took herhand to help her up.When she saw in the light how low and tight it was, that Richard had to lie onhis stomach, she started to tremble. When Richard helped pull her up, and herface came up close to him, he could see her tears in the dim light.Her wide blue eyes took in the way ahead, how low it was.“Please, Richard, I’m afraid. I don’t want to go in under there.”He nodded. “I know, but it’s not far. I won’t let you stay in here. I’ll seethat you get out.” He cupped a hand to the side of her face. “I promise.”“How do I know you’ll keep your promise?”Richard smiled. “Wizards always keep their promises.”“You said you don’t know much about being a wizard.”“But I know how to keep promises.”She at last agreed and let him help her the rest of the way up. When he pulledher all the way up onto the shelf of the mountainside, and she actually felt howthe roof of rock didn’t allow her any room to get up and that she had to lieflat just to fit, and worse, that the roof of rock was only scant inches aboveher back, she started to shiver with terror.“I know how you feel,” he told her. “I do, Jennsen. I hate this, too, but wehave no choice. It’s not dangerous if you just follow me through the place wherethere’s room. Just follow me and we’ll be out before you know it.”“What if it comes down and crushes us? Or what if it comes down just enough topin us so we can’t move or breathe?”“It won’t,” he insisted. “It’s been here for ages. It isn’t going to come down.It’s not.”She nodded but he didn’t know if she really heard him. She began to whimper ashe turned himself around so he could lead her out.“Take my ankle,” he called back to her. “Here, push your pack up to me and I’lltake care of it for you. Then you’ll only have to worry about holding on to myankle and following behind.”“What if it gets too tight and I can’t breathe? Richard, what if I can’tbreathe?”Richard kept his voice calm and confident. “I’m bigger than you, so if I fit,you will.”She only nodded as she shivered. He extended his hand back and had to tell heragain to pass her pack forward before she did as he instructed. Once he had herpack, he tied the straps to his and pushed them both on ahead. She seized hisankle as if it were the only thing keeping her from falling into the arms of theKeeper of the underworld.He didn’t complain, though, about how hard she held him; he knew her fear.Richard pushed the packs out ahead and started inching his way forward. He triednot to think about the rough ceiling of rock only a hand-width above his back.He knew it would become narrower before they got out. The shelf of rock slopedupward to the right slightly, into the dark. The light was to the left, anddown.It looked like the easiest way out was to go straight toward the opening. Itwasn’t far. They had to go, instead, up into the darkness and around thenarrowing of the cleft in order to get around to a place where they could fitthrough. Forcing himself to go up, into the dark where it felt tighter and moreclosed in, rather than toward the light of the opening, felt wrong, but he hadalready scouted the route and he knew that his feelings were wrong about this.As he moved deeper into the darkness, going around the impassable area in thecenter of the chamber, he reached the spot where the rock above lowered.Advancing in farther, it came down until it pressed against his back. He knew itwasn’t far, not more than a dozen feet, but, without being able to take a fullbreath, the cramped passage was daunting.Richard pushed the packs ahead as he wriggled and wormed his way along. He hadto push with the toes of his boots and, with his fingers finding any purchaseavailable, pull his chest through, force himself to make headway into the dark,away from the light.Jennsen’s fingers had an iron grip on his ankle. That was fine with Richard,because he could then help pull her through with him. He wanted to be able tohelp pull her through when she reached the spot that would compress her chest.And then she suddenly let go of his ankle."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33Off behind him, Richard could hear Jennsen scrambling away. “Jennsen? What’sgoing on? What are you doing?” She was crying out, whining in terror, as shebolted toward the light at the opening.“Jennsen!” Richard called to her. “Don’t go that way! Stay with me!” Wedged inas he was, he couldn’t easily turn to see. He forced himself ahead, crabbingsideways, trying to spot her. Jennsen was clambering toward the light, ignoringhim as he called to her. Kahlan wormed her way up to him. “What’s she doing?”“She’s trying to get out. She sees the opening, the light, and won’t listen.”Richard shoved the packs and frantically worked his way ahead, moving into thearea beyond the tight spot, to where it was open enough that he could at lastget a full breath and almost get up on his hands and knees.Jennsen screamed. Richard could see her clawing frantically at the rock, but shewasn’t making any headway. In a frenzy of effort, she tried to push herselfforward, but, instead, she’d slipped sideways farther down the slope, wedgingherself in tighter.Each exaggerated, panting breath as she strained and stretched ratcheted her indeeper.Richard called to her, trying to get her to listen, to do as he said. In herdesperation, she wasn’t responding to any of his instructions. She saw theopening, wanted out, and would not listen to him.Fast as he could, Richard scrambled through the darkness and around toward theopening, guiding Kahlan, Owen, Cara, and Tom through the only way he knew theycould make it. Kahlan held tight to his ankle and he could hear by the pantingof effort that the rest of them were all following in a line behind her.Jennsen screamed in terror. She struggled madly, but couldn’t move. Wedged in asshe was, with rock compressing her rib cage top and bottom, it was becomingdifficult for her to breathe.“Jennsen! Take a slow breath! Slow down!” Richard called to her as he scurriedaround toward the opening. “Breathe slow! Breathe!”Richard finally reached the opening. He emerged from the dark crevasse,squinting in the sudden light. On his knees, he leaned in and helped pull Kahlanout. Betty scrambled out, somehow having passed the rest of the people. As Owenand then Cara clambered out of the opening, Richard pulled the baldric over hishead and handed his sword to Kahlan.Tom called out that he was going back in to try to reach Jennsen.As soon as the rest were safely out, Richard dove back into the fissure.Headfirst, on his hands and knees, he scuttled into the dark. He could see thatTom, from his angle of approach, had no chance to get to her.“Tom, I’ll get her.”“I can reach her,” the man said even as he was getting himself wedged tight.“No you can’t,” Richard said in a stern tone. “Wishing won’t make it so. You’lljust get yourself stuck. Listen to me. Back out, now, or your weight will helppush you downhill and get you stuck so hard that we won’t be able to get youout. Back up, now, while you’re still able to. Go. Let me get her.”Tom watched Richard moving around behind him, and then, making a face thatshowed how unhappy he was to be doing it, he started pushing himself back upinto the darkness, where there was a few precious inches’ more room that wouldlet him make it back out.Richard worked his way through the tight spot and then moved down the slope sothat he wouldn’t be facing downhill as he tried to help Jennsen and possiblywedge himself in tighter than he wanted. If he wasn’t careful, he would do thesame thing Tom had been about to do. Down in the darkness, Jennsen cried inpanic.Richard, flat on his belly, wiggled and snaked his way deeper, all the whilemoving to his left, down the pitch in the shelf of rock. “Jennsen, breathe. I’mcoming. It’s all right.”“Richard! Please don’t leave me here! Richard!”Richard spoke in a calm, quiet voice as he moved around behind her down into thetighter part of the cave. “I’m not going to leave you. You’ll be fine. Just waitfor me.”“Richard! I can’t move!” She grunted with effort. “I can’t breathe! The ceilingis coming down! It’s moving—I can feel it coming down. It’s squeezing me! Pleasehelp me! Richard—please don’t leave me!”“You’re fine, Jennsen. The ceiling isn’t moving. You’re just stuck. I’ll haveyou out in a minute.”Even as he worked his way into the low spot, trying to get up close behind her,she was still struggling to move forward, making it worse—there was no way shecould go forward and make it out. As she kept struggling, though, she was slowlyslipping deeper down the slope and with every frantic breath wedging herself intighter. He could hear how desperately she was trying to breathe, to draw eachshallow breath against the immovable compression of rock.Finally all the way back around behind her, Richard started pushing himself inthe way she’d gone. She had gone into a narrow channel that closed down on theuphill side of her, so there could be no moving her sideways up the slope; hehad to get her to back up the way she’d gone in. He had to get her to go awayfrom the light and back into what she feared.The roof of rock scraped against his back, making it difficult to draw a fullbreath. He had to take shallow breaths as he moved deeper. The farther he went,he could not even breathe that deeply.The need for air, for a deep breath, made the pain of the poison feel likeknives twisting in his ribs. Arms stretched forward, Richard used his boots toforce himself in deeper, trying to ignore his own rising sense of panic. Hereasoned with himself that there were others who knew where he was, that hewasn’t alone. With the powerful feeling that a mountain of rock was crushinghim, reasoning with himself was difficult, especially when the shallow split ofrock he was pressed into hardly let him get any air as it was and he wasdesperately working himself deeper trying to reach Jennsen. He knew that he hadto help pull her out of where she was stuck or she would die there.“Richard,” she cried, “it hurts. I can’t breathe. I’m stuck. Dear spirits, Ican’t breathe. Please, Richard, I’m scared.”Richard stretched, trying to reach her ankle. It was too far away. He had toturn his head sideways to advance. Both ears scraped against rock. He wiggled,inching in tighter even though his better judgment was telling him that he wasalready in trouble.“Jennsen, please, I need you to help me. I need you to push back. Push back withyour hands. Push back toward me.”“No! I have to get out! I’m almost there!”“No, you’re not almost there. You can’t make it that way. You have to trust me.Jennsen, you’ve got to push back so I can reach you.”“No! Please! I want out! I want out!”“I’ll get you out, I promise. Just push back so I can reach you.”With her blocking the light he couldn’t tell if she was doing as he instructedor not. He squirmed in another inch, then another. His head was almost stuck. Hecouldn’t imagine how she had gotten in as far as she had.“Jennsen, push back.” His voice was strained. He couldn’t get enough of a breathto talk and to breathe, too.His fingers stretched forward, reaching, stretching, reaching. His lungs burnedfor air. He just wanted to take a deep breath. He desperately needed a breath.Not being able to draw one was not only painful, but frightening. His heartbeatpounded in his ears.As high as they were in the mountains, the air was already thin and it wasdifficult to get enough air the way it was. Limited to taking shallow breathswas making him light-headed. If he didn’t get back to where he could breathesoon, the two of them were going to be forever in this terrible place.The tips of Richard’s fingers caught the edge of the sole of Jennsen’s boot. Hecouldn’t get a good grip on her foot, though.“Push back,” he whispered into the dark. It was all he could do to keep his ownpanic in check. “Jennsen, do as I say. Push back. Do it.”Jennsen’s boot moved back into his hand. He snatched it in a tighter grip andimmediately worked his way back a few inches. Pulling with all his might, hestrained to drag her back with him. Try as he might, she wouldn’t budge. She waseither stuck tight, or was fighting to go forward.“Push back,” he whispered again. “Use your hands, Jennsen. Push back toward me.Push.”She was sobbing and crying something he couldn’t make out. Richard wedged hisboots, top and bottom, in the tight cleft and then pulled with all his might.His arm shook with the effort. He managed to draw her back a few inches.He wiggled himself back an equal distance and pulled again. With agonizingeffort, he slowly, painstakingly, started drawing her out of the dead end shehad fled into in a panicked attempt to get out.At times, she tried to squirm back toward the light. Richard, the rockcompressing him tight, kept a firm hold of her boot and muscled her back yetmore, not allowing her to take back any of the distance he gained.He couldn’t straighten his head. That made it more difficult to use his musclesto move the both of them. With his head lying on the right, he reached back withhis left arm and gripped a small lip of rock in the ceiling, using it to helphaul them back. With his right arm, stretched forward and holding her by theboot, he drew her back inch by inch.As he reached back again for another handhold, Richard saw something not far tohis left, down the slope, wedged where the rock narrowed. At first he thought itwas a rock. As he struggled to draw Jennsen back, he stared at the thing alsostuck in the rock. He reached to the side and touched it. It was smooth anddidn’t feel at all like the granite.As he began to make good progress backward he stretched to the side and managedto get his fingers around the thing. He pulled it to his side and continued towiggle back.With great relief, he was finally back far enough to where he was able to getenough air. He lay still for a time, just catching his breath. Almost as much asair, though, he wanted out.While he talked to Jennsen, distracting her with instructions she onlyintermittently followed, he began forcing her back and to the right, where therewas more room. Finally, he managed to move up beside her and seize her wrist.Once he had her, he started moving her back up the slope, into the darkness,into the tight place that he knew was the only true way out.With him up beside her, she was a little more cooperative. All the while, hekept reassuring her. “This is the way, Jennsen. This is the way. I’ll not leaveyou. I’ll get you out. This is the way. Just come with me and we’ll be out in afew minutes.”When they worked their way up into the dark, tight spot, she began strugglingagain, trying again to scramble for the light of the opening, but he wasblocking her way. He stayed close at her side as he kept them both movingforward. She seemed to find strength in his constant assurances and his firmgrip on her wrist. He was not about to let her get away from him again.When they pushed through to the place where the roof rose up a bit, she startedweeping with expectant joy. He knew the feeling. Once the ceiling rose up a footor two, he hurried as fast as he could to get her to the opening, to the light.The others were waiting right at the entrance to help pull them out. Richardheld the thing he’d retrieved under his left arm as he helped push Jennsen outfirst. She rushed into Tom’s waiting arms, but only until Richard crawled outand got to his feet. Then, crying with relief, Jennsen fled into his arms,clinging to him for dear life.“I’m so sorry,” she said over and over as she cried. “I’m so sorry, Richard. Iwas so afraid.”“I know,” he comforted as he held her.He’d been in a similar situation before where he thought he might never gethimself out of such a terrifying place, so he did understand. In such astressful circumstance, where you feared you were about to die, it was easy tobe overpowered by the blind need to escape—to live.“I feel so confused.”“I don’t like such tight places, either,” he said. “I understand.”“But I don’t understand. I’ve never been afraid of places like that. Ever sinceI was very young I’ve hid in tight little places. Such places always made mefeel safe because no one could find me or get to me. When you spend your liferunning and hiding from someone like Darken Rahl, you come to appreciate small,dark, concealed places.“I don’t know what came over me. It was the strangest thing. It was like thesethoughts that I wouldn’t get out, that I couldn’t breathe, that I would die,just started coming into my head. Feelings I’ve never had before just started toseep into me. They just seemed to overwhelm me. I’ve never done anything likethat before.”“Do you still feel these strange feelings?”“Yes,” she said as she wept, “but they’re starting to fade, now that I’m out,now that it’s over.”Everyone else had moved off a ways to give her the time she needed to setherself straight. They sat not far off waiting on an old log turned silver inthe weather.Richard didn’t try to rush her. He just held her and let her know she was safe.“I’m so sorry, Richard. I feel like such a fool.”“No need. It’s over, now.”“You kept your promise,” she said through her tears.Richard smiled, happy that he had.Owen, his face tense with worry, looked like he couldn’t help himself fromasking a question. “But Jennsen?” he asked as he stepped forward. “Why didn’tyou do magic to help yourself?”“I can’t do magic any more than you can.”He rubbed his palms on his hips. “You could if you let yourself. You are one whois able to touch magic.”“Other people might be able to do magic, but I can’t. I don’t have any abilityfor it.”“What others think is magic is only themselves tricking their senses and onlyblinds them to real magic. Our eyes blind us, our senses deceive us—as Iexplained before. Only those who have never seen magic, only those who havenever used, sensed, perceived it, only those who do not have any ability orfaculty for it, can actually understand it and therefore only they can be truepractitioners of real magic. Magic must be based entirely on faith, if it is tobe real. You must believe, and then you truly can see. You are one who can domagic.”Richard and Jennsen stared at the man.“Richard,” Kahlan said in an odd voice before he could say anything to Owen.“What’s that.”Richard blinked at her. “What?”She pointed. “That, there, under your arm. What is it?”“Oh,” he said. “Something I found wedged in the rock near Jennsen, back in whereshe was stuck. In the dark, I couldn’t tell what it was other than that itwasn’t rock.”He pulled it out to have a look.It was a statue.A statue in his likeness, wearing his war wizard’s outfit. The cape was fixed inplace as it swirled to the side of the legs, making the base wider than thewaist.The lower portion of the figure was a translucent amber color, and through itcould be seen a falling trickle of sand that had nearly filled the bottom half.The statue was not all amber, though, as Kahlan’s had been. Near the middle,obscuring the narrowing where the sand dribbled through, the translucent amberof the bottom began darkening. The higher up the figure, the darker it became.The top—the shoulders and head—were as black as a night stone.A night stone was an underworld thing, and Richard remembered all too well whatthat wicked object had looked like. The top of the statue looked to be made ofthe same sinister material, all glossy and smooth and so black that it looked asif it might suck the light right out of the day.Richard’s heart sank at seeing himself represented in such a way, as a talismantouched by death.“She made it,” Owen said, shaking an accusatorial finger at Jennsen stillsheltered under Richard’s right arm. “She made it with magic. I told you shecould. She spun it of evil magic back in that cave when she wasn’t thinking. Themagic took over and came out of her, then, when she wasn’t thinking about howshe couldn’t do magic.”Owen didn’t have any idea what he was talking about. This was not a statueJennsen made.This was the second warning beacon, meant to warn the one who could seal thebreach.“Lord Rahl...”Richard looked up. It was Cara’s voice.She was standing off a ways, her back to them, looking up at a small spot of skyoff through the trees. Jennsen turned in his arms to see what had put the oddtone in Cara’s voice. Holding his sister close, he stepped up behind Cara andpeered up through the trees where she was looking.Through a thin area in the canopy of pine, he could see the rim of the mountainpass above them. Silhouetted against iron gray clouds stealing past wassomething man-made.It looked like a huge statue sitting atop the pass."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34Icy wind tore at Richard’s and Kahlan’s clothes as they huddled close togetherat the edge of a thick stand of spruce trees. Low, ragged clouds raced by as ifto escape the colossal, dark, swirling clouds building above them. Fat flakes ofsnow danced in the cold gusts. Richard’s ears burned in the numbing cold.“What do you think?” Kahlan asked.Richard shook his head. “I don’t know.” He glanced behind them, back into theshelter of the trees. “Owen, are you sure you don’t know what it is? You don’thave any idea at all?”The roiling clouds made an ominous backdrop for the imposing statue sitting upon the ridge.“No, Lord Rahl. I’ve never been here before; none of us ever traveled thisroute. I don’t know what it could be. Unless...” His words trailed off into themoan of the wind.“Unless what?”Owen shrank back, twisting the button on his coat as he glanced to the Mord-Sithon one side of him and Tom and Jennsen on the other. “There is aforetelling—from the ones who gave us our name and protected us by sealing thepass. It is taught that when they gave our empire its name, they also told usthat one day a savior would come to us.”Richard wanted to ask the man just what exactly it was he thought they neededsaving from—if they had lived in such an enlightened culture where they weresafe from the unenlightened “savages” of the rest of the world. Instead, heasked a simpler question he thought Owen might be able to answer.“So you think that maybe that’s a statue of him, your savior?”Owen fidgeted, his shoulders finally working into a shrug. “He is not just asavior. The foretelling also says that he will destroy us.”Richard frowned at the man, hoping this was not going to be another of hisconvoluted beliefs. “This savior of yours is going to destroy you. That makes nosense.”Owen was quick to agree. “I know. No one understands it.”“Maybe it’s meant to say that someone will come to save your people,” Jennsensuggested, “but he will fail and so only end up destroying them in the attempt.”“Maybe.” Owen’s face twisted with the displeasure of having to contemplate suchan outcome.“Maybe,” Cara suggested in a grim tone, “it means this man will come, and afterseeing your people, decide they aren’t worth saving”—she leaned toward Owen—”anddecide to destroy them instead.”Owen, as he stared up at Cara, seemed to be considering her words as a realpossibility, rather than the sarcasm Richard knew them to be.“I don’t think that is the meaning,” Owen finally told her after earnestconsideration. He turned back to Richard. “The foretelling, as it has beentaught to us, you see, says, first, that a man will come who will destroy us. Itthen goes on to say that he is the one who will save us. ‘Your destroyer willcome and he will redeem you,’ “ Owen quoted. “That is how we have been taughtthe words, how they were told to my people when we were put here, beyond thispass.”“ ‘Your destroyer will come and he will redeem you,’ “ Richard repeated. He tooka patient breath. “Whatever it originally said has probably been confused andall jumbled up as it’s been passed down. It probably no longer resembles theoriginal saying.”Rather than disagree, as Richard expected, Owen nodded. “Some believe, as yousay, that over the time since we were protected and given our name, maybe thetrue words have been lost, or confused. Others believe that it has been passeddown intact and must have important meaning. Some believe that the foretellingwas meant to say only that a savior will come. Others think it means only that adestroyer will come.”“And what do you believe?” Richard asked.Owen twiddled the button on his coat until Richard thought it might come off. “Ibelieve that the foretelling is meant to say that a destroyer will come—and Ibelieve that he is this man Nicholas, of the Order—and then that a savior willcome and save us. I believe that man is you, Lord Rahl. Nicholas is ourdestroyer. You are our savior.”Richard knew from the book that prophecy didn’t function with these people, withpillars of Creation.“What your people think is a foretelling,” Richard said, “is probably nothingmore than an old adage that people have gotten mixed up.”Owen held his ground, if hesitantly. “We are taught that this is a foretelling.We are taught that those who named us told us this foretelling and that theywanted it passed down so all might know of it.”Richard sighed, the wind pulling out a long cloud of his breath. “So you thinkthat up there is a statue of me, put there thousands of years ago by the oneswho protected you behind the boundary? How would they know, long before I wasborn, what I would look like in order to make a statue of me?”“The true reality knows everything that will be,” Owen said by rote. He forced ahalf smile as he shrugged again. “After all, it made that little statue that youfound look like you.”Unhappy to be reminded of that, Richard turned away from the man. The smallfigure had been made to look like him by magic tied to the boundary, and,possibly, to a dead wizard in the underworld.Richard scanned the sky, the rocky slopes all around, the tree line. He didn’tsee any sign of life. The statue—they still couldn’t quite make out what itwas—sat distant up a treeless, rocky rise. It was yet quite a climb up to thatrim of the pass, to that statue.Richard was not going to like it if it did indeed turn out to be a statue of himbeneath the gathering gloom.He already didn’t like it one bit that the second warning beacon was meant forhim. It bound him to a responsibility, a duty, he neither wanted nor couldaccomplish.He had no idea how to restore the seal on Bandakar. Zedd had once createdboundaries that were probably similar to the one that had been down here in theOld World, but even Zedd had used constructed magic he had found in the Keep.Such constructed spells had been created by ancient wizards with vast power andknowledge of such things. Zedd had told him that there were no more such spells.Richard certainly had no idea how to call forth a spell that could create such aboundary. More to the point, he didn’t see how it would do any good even if heknew how. What had really been freed from Bandakar when the boundary failed wasthe trait of being born without any trace of the gift—that was why they had allbeen banished here in the first place. The Imperial Order was already breedingwomen from Bandakar in order to breed the gift out of mankind. There was notelling how far that trait had already spread. Breeding the women, as it soundedlike they were doing, now, would gain them more children who were pristinelyungifted, children who would be indoctrinated in the teachings of the Order.When they started using the men for breeding, the number of such children wouldvastly increase. A woman could have a child every year. In the same time, a mancould sire a great number of children bearing his pristinely ungifted trait.Despite the Order’s creed of self-sacrifice, they had not yet, it would seem,been willing to sacrifice their women to such an undertaking. Raping the womenin Bandakar and proclaiming it for the good of mankind was fine with the men ofthe Order. For the men ruling the Imperial Order to give over their own women tobe bred, however, was quite another matter.Richard had no doubt that they eventually would start using their own women tothis purpose, but that would come later. In the meantime, the Order wouldprobably soon start using all the women captured and held as slaves for thispurpose, breeding them to men from Bandakar. The Order’s conquest of the NewWorld would provide them with plenty more women for breeding stock.Whereas in ancient times those in the New World tried to limit the trait fromspreading in man, the Imperial Order would do whatever they could to accelerateit.“Richard,” Kahlan asked in a low voice, so the others farther back in the treeswouldn’t hear, “what do you think it means that the second warning beacon, theone for you, is turning black like the night stone? Do you think it means toshow you the time you have left to get the antidote?”Since he had only just found it, he hadn’t given it much thought. Even so, hecould interpret it only as a dire warning. The night stone was tied to thespirits of the dead—to the underworld.It could be, as Kahlan suggested, that the darkening was meant to show him howthe poison was taking him, and that he was running out of time. For a number ofreasons, though, he didn’t believe that was the explanation.“I don’t know for sure,” he finally told her, “but I don’t think it’s a warningabout the poison. I think that the way the statue is turning black is meant torepresent, materially, how the gift is failing in me, how it’s slowly beginningto kill me, how the underworld, the world of the dead, is slowly enshroudingme.”Kahlan’s hand slipped up on his arm, a gesture of comfort as well as worry.“That was my thought, too. I was hoping you would argue against it. This meansthat the gift might be more of a problem than the poison—if, after all, thisdead wizard used the beacon to warn you about it.”Richard wondered if the statue up on the ridge of the pass would hold anyanswers. He certainly didn’t have any. To make it up there and see, they wouldhave to leave the shelter of the forest and travel out in the open.Richard turned and signaled the others forward.“I don’t think the races would be expecting us here,” he said as they gatheredaround him. “If we really did manage to lose them they won’t know where we went,what direction, so they won’t know to look for us, here. I think we can make itup there without the races, and therefore Nicholas, knowing.”“Besides,” Tom said, “with those low clouds hugging most of the mountains, theymay not be able to search.”“Maybe,” Richard said.It was getting late. In the distant mountains a wolf howled. On another slopeacross a deep cleft in the mountains, a second wolf answered. There would bemore than two.Betty’s ears perked toward the howls as she crowded against Jennsen’s legs.“What if Nicholas uses something else?” Jennsen asked.Cara gripped the blond braid lying over the front of her shoulder as she scannedthe woods to the sides. “Something else?”Jennsen pulled her cloak tighter around herself as the wind tried to lift itopen. “Well, if he can look through a race’s eyes, then maybe he can lookthrough the eyes of something else.”“You mean a wolf?” Cara asked. “You think that wolf you heard might be him.”“I don’t know,” Jennsen admitted.“For that matter,” Richard said, “if he can look through the black eyes of theraces, maybe he could just as easily look through the eyes of a mouse.”Tom swiped his windblown blond hair back from his forehead as he cast a waryglance at the sky. “Why do you think he always seems to use the races, then?”“Probably because they’re better able to cover great distances,” Richard said.“After all, he’d have a lot of trouble finding us with a mouse.“More than that, though, I think he likes the imagery of being with suchcreatures, likes thinking of himself as being part of a powerful predator. Heis, after all, hunting us.”“So you think we only have to worry about the races, then?” Jennsen asked.“I think he would prefer to watch through the races, but that isn’t his end,only the means,” Richard said. “He’s after Kahlan and me. Since getting us ishis end, I think he will turn to whatever means he must, if necessary. He verywell might look through even the eyes of a mouse if it would help him get us.”“If his end is having you,” Cara said, “then Owen is helping his ends bybringing you right to him.”Richard couldn’t argue with that. For the moment, though, he had to go alongwith Owen’s wishes. Soon enough, Richard intended to start doing things his ownway.“For now,” Richard said, “he’s still trying to find us, so I expect that he willstick to the races, since they can cover great distances. But, since I’ve killedraces with arrows, he must realize that we at least suspect someone is watchingus through their eyes. As we get closer to him, I see no reason that in thefuture he might not use something else so we won’t know he’s watching us.”Kahlan looked to be alarmed by the idea. “You mean, something like a wolf, or,or ... I don’t know, maybe an owl?”“Owl, pigeon, sparrow. If I had to guess, then I’d guess that at least until hefinds us he will use a bird.”Kahlan huddled close beside him, using his body to block the wind. They were uphigh enough in the mountains that they were just beginning to encounter snow.From what Richard had seen of the Old World, it generally appeared too warm forsnow. For there to be snow this time of year it could only be in the mostimposing of mountains.Richard gestured to the icy flakes swirling in the air. “Owen, does it get coldin winter in Bandakar? Do you get snow?”“Winds come down from the north, following down our side of the mountains, Ibelieve. In winter it gets cold. Every couple of years, we get a bit of snow,but it does not last long. Usually in the winter it rains more. I do notunderstand why it snows here, now, when it is summer.”“Because of the elevation,” Richard answered idly as he studied the risingslopes to each side.Higher yet, the snowpack was thick, and in places, where the wind blew driftsinto overhangs, it would be treacherous. Trying to cross such precipitous,snow-covered slopes would be perilous, at best. Fortunately, they were nearingthe highest point they would have to climb to make it over the pass, so theywouldn’t have to traverse heavy snow. The bitterly cold wind, though, was makingthem all miserable.“I want to know what that thing is,” Richard finally said, gesturing up at thestatue on the rise. He looked around at the others to see if anyone objected. Noone did. “And, I want to know why it’s there.”“Do you think we should wait for dark?” Cara asked. “Darkness will hide usbetter.”Richard shook his head. “The races must be able to see pretty well in thedark—after all, that’s when they hunt. If given a choice, I’d rather be in theopen during the daylight, when I can see them coming.”Richard hooked his bow under his leg and bent it enough to attach the bowstring.He drew an arrow from the leather quiver over his shoulder and nocked it,holding it at rest against the bow with his left hand. He scanned the sky,checking the clouds, and looking for any sign of the races. He wasn’t entirelysure about the shadows among the trees, but the sky was clear of races.“I think we’d better be on our way.” Richard’s gaze swept across all theirfaces, first, making sure they were paying attention. “Walk on the rocks if atall possible. I don’t want to leave a trail behind in the snow that Nicholascould spot through the eyes of the races.”Nodding their understanding, they all followed after him, in single file, outonto the rocks. Owen, in front of the ever-watchful Mord-Sith, kept a wary eyetoward the sky. Jennsen and Betty watched the woods to the sides. In the stronggusts, they all hunched against the wind and the stinging bite of icy crystalshitting their faces. In the thin air it was tiring climbing up the steepincline. Richard’s legs burned with the effort. His lungs burned with thepoison.By the look of the sheer walls of rock rising up into broken clouds to eitherside, Richard didn’t see any way, other than the pass, for people to make itover the imposing mountains, at least, not without a journey of tremendousdifficulty, hardship, and probably a great loss of life. Even then, he wasn’treally certain that it was even possible.In places, as they trudged up the edge of the steep rise, he could see backthrough gaps in the rock walls of the mountains, under the dark bottom ofclouds, to sunlight beyond the pass.None of them spoke as they climbed. From time to time they had to pause to catchtheir breath. They all kept an eye to the churning sky.Richard spotted a few small birds in the distance, but nothing of any size.As they approached the top, following a zigzagging course so they could moreeasily make it up without having to scale rock faces of jutting ledges, Richardcaught glimpses of the statue sitting on a massive base of granite.From the high vantage point in the pass, he could now see that the rock oneither side of the rise fell away in precipitous drops. The gorge at the bottomof either side dead-ended at vertical climbs of what would have to be thousandsof feet. Whatever routes might have branched off lower down, they would have toconverge before going up this rise; by the lay of the land, it became clear tohim that this was the only way to make it through this entire section of thepass.He realized that anyone approaching Bandakar by this route would have to climbthis ridge in the rise, and they would unavoidably come upon the monument.As he mounted the final cut between the snow-dusted boulders standing twice hisheight, Richard was able at last to take in the entire statue guarding the pass.And guarding the pass it was. This was a sentinel.The noble figure sitting atop a vast stone base was seated as he watchfullyguarded the pass. In one hand the figure casually held a sword at the ready, itspoint resting on the ground. He appeared to be wearing leather armor, with hiscape resting over his lap. The vigilant pose of the sentinel gave it a resolutepresence. The clear impression was that this figure was set to ward what wasbeyond.The stone was worn by centuries of weather, but that weathering failed to wearaway the power of the carving. This figure was carved, and it was placed, withgreat purpose. That it was out in the middle of nowhere, at the summit of amountain pass no longer traveled and a trail possibly abandoned after this wasset here, made it, to Richard, all the more arresting.He had carved stone, and he knew what had gone into this. It was not what hewould call fine work, but it was powerfully executed. Just looking at it gavehim goose bumps.“At least it doesn’t look like you,” Kahlan said.At least there was that.But this thing being there all alone for what very well might have beenthousands of years was worrisome.“What I’d like to know,” Richard said to her, “is why this second beacon wasdown there, down the hill, in that cave, and not up here.”Kahlan shared a telling look with him. “If Jennsen hadn’t done what she did, youwould never have found it.”Richard walked around the base of the statue, searching—for what he didn’t know.Almost as soon as he started looking, he saw, on the front of the base, on thetop of one of the decorative moldings, an odd void in the snow. It looked as ifsomething had been sitting there and had then been taken away. It was a track,of sorts, a telltale.Richard thought the barren spot looked familiar. He pulled the warning beaconfrom his pack and checked the shape of the bottom. His thought confirmed, heplaced the figure of himself in the void in the snow collected on the rim of thebase. It was a perfect fit.The little figure had been here, with this statue.“How do you think it came to be down in the cave?” Cara asked in a suspiciousvoice.“Maybe it fell,” Jennsen offered. “It’s pretty windy up here. Maybe the windblew it off and it tumbled down the hill.”“And just managed to roll through the woods without being stopped by a tree, andthen, neat as can be,” Richard said, “roll right into the small opening of thecave, and then just happened to come to be stuck in the rock right near whereyou, by coincidence, ended up stuck. Stuck, I might add, in a terrifying placeyou aren’t terrified of.”Jennsen blinked in wonder. “When you put it like that...”Standing at the crown of the pass, in front of the statue right where thewarning beacon would have rested, and now again rested, Richard could see thatthe spot held a commanding view of the approach to Bandakar. The mountainsblocking off the view to either side were as formidable as anything he’d everseen. The rise where the sentinel sat overlooked the approach into the pass backbetween those towering, snowcapped peaks. As high as they were, they were stillonly at the foothills of those mountains.The statue was not looking ahead, as might be expected of a guardian, butrather, its unflinching gaze was fixed a little to the right. Richard thoughtthat was a bit odd. He wondered if maybe it was meant to show this sentinelkeeping a vigilant eye on everything, on every potential threat.Standing as he was, directly in front of the statue’s base, in front of wherethe warning beacon sat, Richard looked to the right, in the direction the man inthe statue was looking.He could see the approach of the pass up through the mountains. Farther out, inthe distance, he could see vast forests to the west, and beyond that, the low,barren mountains they had crossed.And, he could see a gap in those mountains.The eyes of the man in the statue were resolutely fixed upon what Richard nowsaw.“Dear spirits,” he whispered.“What is it?” Kahlan asked. “What do you see?”“The Pillars of Creation.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35Kahlan, standing beside Richard, squinted into the distance. From the base ofthe statue they had a commanding view of the approaches from the west. It seemedas if she could see half a world away. But she couldn’t see what he saw.“I can’t see the Pillars of Creation,” she said.Richard leaned close, having her sight down his arm where he pointed. “There.That darker depression in the expanse of flat ground.”Richard’s eyes were better at seeing distant things than were hers. It was allrather hazy-looking, being so far away.“You can recognize where it lies by the landmarks, there”—he pointed off to theright, and then a little to the left—”and there. Those darker mountains in thedistance that are a little higher than the rest have a unique shape. They serveas good reference points so you can find things.”“Now that you point them out, I can see the land where we traveled from. Irecognize those mountains.”It seemed amazing, looking back on where they’d been, how high they were. Shecould see, spread out into the distance, the vast wasteland beyond the barrenmountain range and, even if she couldn’t make out the details of the dreadfulplace, she could see the darker depression in the valley. That depression sheknew to be the Pillars of Creation.“Owen,” Richard asked, “how far is this pass from your men—the men who werehiding with you in the hills?”Owen looked baffled by the question. “But Lord Rahl, I have never been up thisportion of the pass before. I have never seen this statue. I have never beenanywhere close to here before. It would be impossible for me to tell such athing.”“Not impossible,” Richard said. “If you know what your home is like, you shouldbe able to recognize landmarks around it—just as I was able to look out to thewest and see the route we traveled to get here. Look around at those mountainsback through the pass and see if you recognize anything.”Owen, looking skeptical, walked the rest of the way up behind the statue andpeered off to the east. He stood in the wind for a time, staring. He pointed ata mountain in the distance, through the pass.“I think I know that place.” He sounded astonished. “I know the shape of thatmountain. It looks a little different from this spot, but I think it’s the sameplace I know.” He shielded his eyes from the gusts of wind as he gazed to theeast. He pointed again. “And that place! I know that place, too!”He rushed back to Richard. “You were right, Lord Rahl. I can see places I know.”He stared off then as he whispered to himself. “I can tell where my home is,even though I’ve not been here. Just by seeing places I know.”Kahlan had never seen anyone so astounded by something so simple.“So,” Richard finally prompted, “how far do you think your men are from here?”Owen looked back over his shoulder. “Through that low place, then around thatslope coming from the right...” He turned back to Richard. “We have been hidingin the land near where the seal on our empire used to be, where no one ever goesbecause it is near the place where death stalks, near the pass. I would guessmaybe a full day’s steady walk from here.” He suddenly turned hesitant. “But Iam wrong to be confident of what my eyes tell me. I may just be seeing what mymind wants me to see. It may not be real.”Richard folded his arms and leaned back against the granite base of the statueas he gazed out toward the Pillars of Creation, ignoring Owen’s doubt. KnowingRichard as she did, Kahlan imagined that he must be considering his options.Standing beside him, she was about to lean back against the stone of thestatue’s base, but instead paused to first brush the snow off from beside wherethe warning beacon rested. As she brushed the snow away, she saw that there werewords carved in the top of the decorative molding.“Richard ... look at this.”He turned to see what she saw, and then started hurriedly brushing away more ofthe snow. The others crowded around, trying to see what was written in the stoneof the statue’s base. Cara, on the other side of Richard, ran her hand all theway to the end to clean off the entire ledge.Kahlan couldn’t read it. It was in another language she didn’t know, but thoughtshe recognized.“High D’Haran?” Cara asked.Richard nodded his confirmation as he studied the words. “This must be a veryold dialect,” he said, half to himself as he scrutinized it, trying to figure itout. “It’s not just an old dialect, but one with which I’m not familiar. Maybebecause this is so distant a place.”“What does it say?” Jennsen wanted to know as she peered around Richard, betweenhim and Kahlan. “Can you translate it?”“It’s difficult to work it out,” Richard mumbled. He swiped his hair back withone hand as he ran the fingers of his other lightly over the words.He finally straightened and glanced up at Owen, standing to the side of thebase, watching.Everyone waited while Richard looked down at the words again. “I’m not sure,” hefinally said. “The phraseology is odd...” He looked up at Kahlan. “I can’t besure. I’ve not seen High D’Haran written this way before. I feel like I shouldknow what it says, but I can’t quite get it.”Kahlan didn’t know if he really couldn’t be sure, or if he didn’t want to speakthe translation in front of the others.“Well, maybe if you think it over for a while, it might come to you,” sheoffered, trying to give him a way of putting it off for the time being if hewanted to.Richard didn’t take her offer. Instead, he tapped a finger to the words on theleft of the warning beacon. “This part is a little more clear to me. I think itsays something like ‘Fear any breach of this seal to the empire beyond ...’ “He wiped a hand across his mouth as he considered the rest of the words. “I’mnot so sure about the rest of it,” he finally said. “It seems to say, ‘forbeyond is evil: those who cannot see.’ ““Of course,” Jennsen muttered in angry comprehension.Richard raked his fingers back through his hair. “I’m not at all sure I have itright. Something about it still doesn’t make sense. I’m not sure I have itright.”“You have it perfectly right,” Jennsen said. “Those who cannot see magic. Thiswas placed by the gifted who sealed those people away from the rest of the worldbecause of how they were born.” Her fiery eyes filled with tears. “Fear anybreach of this seal to the empire beyond, for beyond is evil—those who cannotsee magic. That’s what it means, those who cannot see magic.”No one argued with her. The only sound was the rush of the wind across the openground.Richard spoke softly to her. “I’m not sure that’s it, Jenn.”She folded her arms and turned away, glaring out toward the Pillars of Creation.Kahlan could understand how she felt. Kahlan knew what it was like to be shunnedby almost everyone except those who were like you. Confessors were thought of asmonsters by many people. Given the chance, Kahlan was sure that much of the restof humanity would be happy to seal her away for being a Confessor.But just because she could understand how Jennsen felt, that didn’t mean Kahlanthought the young woman was right. Jennsen’s anger at those who banished thesepeople was justified, but her anger at Richard and the rest of them for havingthe same spark of the gift, which made them in that way the same, was not.Richard turned his attention to Owen. “How many men do you have waiting in thehills for you to return?”“Not quite a hundred.”Richard sighed in disappointment. “Well, if that’s all you have, then that’s allyou have. We’ll have to see to getting more later.“For now, I want you to go get those men. Bring them here, to me. We’ll waithere for you to return. This will be our base from where we work a plan to getthe Order out of Bandakar. We’ll set up a camp down there, in those trees, whereit’s well protected.”Owen looked down the incline to where Richard pointed, and then off toward hishomeland. His confused frown returned to Richard. “But, Lord Rahl, it is you whomust give us freedom. Why not just come with me to the men, if you want to seethem?”“Because I think this will be a safer place than where they are now, where theOrder probably knows they’re hiding.”“But the Order does not know that there are men hiding, or where they are.”“You’re deluding yourselves. The men in the Order are brutal, but they aren’tstupid.”“If they really know where the men are, then why hasn’t the Order come to callthem in?”“They will,” Richard said. “When it suits them, they will. Your men aren’t athreat, so the men of the Order are in no hurry to expend any effort to capturethem. Sooner or later they will, though, because they won’t want anyone to thinkthey can escape the Order’s rule.“I want your men away from there, to a place they’ve not been: here. I want theOrder to think they’re gone, to think they’ve run away, so they won’t go afterthem.”“Well,” Owen said, thinking it over, “I guess that would be all right.”Tom stood watch near the far corner of the statue’s base, giving Jennsen room tobe alone. She looked angry and he looked like he thought it best just to leaveher be. Tom looked as if he felt guilty for having been born with the spark ofthe gift that allowed him to see magic, that same spark possessed by those whohad banished people like Jennsen.“Tom,” Richard said, “I want you to go with Owen.”Jennsen’s arms came unfolded as she turned toward Richard. “Why do you want himto go?” She suddenly sounded a lot less angry.“That’s right,” Owen said. “Why should he go?”“Because,” Richard said, “I want to make sure that you and your men get backhere. I need the antidote, remember? The more men I have back here with me whoknow where it is, the better. I want them safely away from the Order for now.With blond hair and blue eyes, Tom will fit in with your people. If you run intoany soldiers from the Order they will think he’s one of you. Tom will make sureyou all get back here.”“But it could be dangerous,” Jennsen objected.Richard fixed her in his challenging stare. He didn’t say anything. He simplywaited to see if she would dare to attempt to justify her objections. Finally,she broke eye contact and looked away.“I guess it makes sense, though,” she finally admitted.Richard turned his attention back to Tom. “I want you to see if you can bringback some supplies. And I’d like to use your hatchet while you’re gone, ifthat’s all right.”Tom nodded and pulled his hatchet from his pack. As Richard stepped closer totake the axe, he started ticking off a list of things he wanted the man to lookfor—specific tools, yew wood, hide glue, packthread, leather, and a list ofother things Kahlan couldn’t hear.Tom hooked his thumbs behind his belt. “All right. I doubt I’ll find it allright off. Do you want me to search out what I can’t find before I return?”“No. I need it all, but I need those men back here more. Get what’s readilyavailable and then get back here with Owen and his men as soon as possible.”“I’ll get what I can. When do you want us to leave?”“Now. We don’t have a moment to lose.”“Now?” Owen sounded incredulous. “It will be dark in an hour or two.”“Those couple of hours may be hours I need,” Richard said. “Don’t waste them.”Kahlan thought that he meant because of the poison, but he could have had thegift in mind. She could see how much pain he was in because of the headachecaused by the gift. She ached to hold him, to comfort him, to make him better,but she couldn’t make it all just go away; they had to find the solutions. Sheglanced at the small figure of Richard standing on the base of the statue. Halfof that figure was as dark as a night stone, as dark and dead as the deepestpart of the underworld itself.Tom swung his pack up over his shoulder. “Take care of them for me, will you,Cara?” he asked with a wink. She smiled her agreement. “I’ll see you all in afew days, then.” He waved his farewell, his gaze lingering on Jennsen, beforeshepherding Owen around the statue and toward the man’s homeland.Cara folded her arms and leveled a look at Jennsen. “You’re a fool if you don’tgo kiss him a good journey.”Jennsen hesitated, her eyes turning toward Richard.“I’ve learned not to argue with Cara,” Richard said.Jennsen smiled and ran over the ridge to catch Tom before he was gone. Betty, atthe end of a long rope, scampered to follow after.Richard stuffed the small figure of himself into his pack before picking up hisbow from where it leaned against the statue. “We’d better get down into thetrees and set up a camp.”Richard, Kahlan, and Cara started down the rise toward the concealing safety ofthe huge pines. They had been long enough out in the open, as far as Kahlan wasconcerned. It was only a matter of time before the races came in search ofthem—before Nicholas came looking for them.As cold as it was up in the pass, Kahlan knew they didn’t dare build a fire; theraces could spot the smoke and then find them. They needed instead to build asnug shelter. Kahlan wished they could find a wayward pine to protect and hidethem for the night, but she had not seen any of those down in the Old World andwishing wasn’t going to grow one.As she stepped carefully on dry patches of rock, avoiding the snow so as not toleave tracks, she checked the dark clouds. It was always possible that it mightwarm just a little and that the precipitation could turn to rain. Even if itdidn’t, it still would be a miserably cold night.Jennsen, Betty following behind, returned, catching up with them as theyzigzagged down through the steep notches of ledge. The wind was getting colder,the snow a little heavier.When they reached a flatter spot, Jennsen caught Richard’s arm. “Richard, I’msorry. I don’t mean to be angry with you. I know you didn’t banish those people.I know it’s not your fault.” She gathered up the slack on Betty’s rope, loopingit into coils. “It just makes me angry that those people were treated like that.I’m like them, and so it makes me angry.”“The way they were treated should make you angry,” Richard said as he startedaway, “but not because you share an attribute with them.”Taken aback by his words, even looking a little hurt, Jennsen didn’t move. “Whatdo you mean?”Richard paused and turned back to her. “That’s how the Imperial Order thinks.That’s how Owen’s people think. It’s a belief in granting disembodied prestige,or the mantle of guilt, to all those who share some specific trait or attribute.“The Imperial Order would like you to believe that your virtue, your ultimatevalue, or even your wickedness, arises entirely from being born a member of agiven group, that free will itself is either impotent or nonexistent. They wantyou to believe that all people are merely interchangeable members of groups thatshare fixed, preordained characteristics, and they are predestined to livethrough a collective identity, the group will, unable to rise on individualmerit because there can be no such thing as independent, individual merit, onlygroup merit.“They believe that people can only rise above their station in life whenselected to be awarded recognition because their group is due an indulgence, andso a representative, a stand-in for the group, must be selected to be awardedthe badge of self-worth. Only the reflected light off this badge, they believe,can bring the radiance of self-worth to others of their group.“But those granted this badge live with the uneasy knowledge that it’s only anillusion of competence. It never brings any sincere self-respect because youcan’t fool yourself. Ultimately, because it is counterfeit, the sham of esteemgranted because of a connection with a group can only be propped up by force.“This belittling of mankind, the Order’s condemnation of everyone and everythinghuman, is their transcendent judgment of man’s inadequacy.“When you direct your anger at me for having a trait borne by someone else, youpronounce me guilty for their crimes. That’s what happens when people say I’m amonster because our father was a monster. If you admire someone simply becauseyou believe their group is deserving, then you embrace the same corrupt ethics.“The Imperial Order says that no individual should have the right to achievesomething on his own, to accomplish what someone else cannot, and so magic mustbe stripped from mankind. They say that accomplishment is corrupt because it isrooted in the evil of self-interest, therefore the fruits of that accomplishmentare tainted by its evil. This is why they preach that any gain must besacrificed to those who have not earned it. They hold that only through suchsacrifice can those fruits be purified and made good.“We believe, on the other hand, that your own individual life is the value andits own end, and what you achieve is yours.“Only you can achieve self-worth for yourself. Any group offering it to you, ordemanding it of you, comes bearing chains of slavery.”Jennsen stared at him for a long moment. A smile finally overcame her. “That’swhy, then, I always wanted to be accepted for who I was, for myself, and alwaysthought it unfair to be persecuted because of how I was born?”“That’s why,” Richard said. “If you want to be proud of yourself because of whatyou accomplish, then don’t allow yourself to be chained to some group, and don’tin turn chain other individuals to one. Let your judgment of individuals beearned.“This means I should not be hated because my father was evil, nor should I beadmired because my grandfather is good. I have the right to live my own life,for my own benefit. You are Jennsen Rahl, and your life is what you, alone, makeof it.”They made the rest of the way down the hill in silence. Jennsen still had afaraway look as she thought about what Richard had said.When they reached the trees, Kahlan was relieved to get in under the shelteringlimbs of the ancient pines and even more so when they entered the secludedprotection of the lower, thicker balsam trees. They made their way through densethickets into the quiet solitude of the towering trees, and farther down theslope, to a place where an outcropping of rock offered protection from theelements. It would be easier to construct a shelter in such a place by leaningboughs against it in order to make a relatively warm shelter.Richard used Tom’s hatchet to cut some stout poles from young pines in theunderstory which he placed against the rock wall. While he lashed the polestogether with wiry lengths of pine roots he pulled up from the mossy ground,Kahlan, Jennsen, and Cara started collecting boughs to make dry bedding and tocover over the shelter.“Richard,” Jennsen asked as she dragged a bundle of balsam close to the shelter,“how do you think you are going to rid Bandakar of the Imperial Order?”Richard laid a heavy bough up high on the poles and tied it in place with alength of the wiry pine root. “I don’t know that I can. My primary concern is toget to the antidote.”Jennsen looked a bit surprised. “But aren’t you going to help those people?”He glanced back over his shoulder at her. “They poisoned me. No matter how youdress it up, they’re willing to murder me if I don’t do as they wish—if I don’tdo their dirty work for them. They think we’re savages, and they’re above us.They don’t think our lives are worth as much—because we are not members of theirgroup. My first responsibility is to my own life, to getting that antidote.”“I see what you mean.” Jennsen handed him another balsam bough. “But I stillthink that if we eliminate the Order there, and this Nicholas, we’ll be helpingourselves.”Richard smiled. “I can agree with that, and we’re going to do what we can. Butto truly help them, I need to convince Owen and his men that they must helpthemselves.”Cara snorted a derisive laugh. “That will be a good trick, teaching the lambs tobecome the wolves.”Kahlan agreed. She thought that convincing Owen and his men to defend themselveswould be more difficult than the five of them ridding Bandakar of the ImperialOrder by themselves. She wondered what Richard had in mind.“Well,” Jennsen said, “since we’re all in this, all going to face the Order upin Bandakar, don’t you think that I have a right to know everything? To knowwhat you two are always making eyes at each other about and whispering about?”Richard stared at Jennsen a moment before he looked back at Kahlan.Kahlan laid her bundle of branches down near the shelter. “I think she’s right.”Richard looked unhappy about it, but finally nodded and set down the balsambough he was holding. “Almost two years ago, Jagang managed to find a way to usemagic to start a plague. The plague itself was not magic; it was just theplague. It swept through cities killing people by the tens of thousands. Sincethe firestorm had been started with a spark of magic, I found a way to stop theplague, using magic.”Kahlan did not believe that such a nightmare could be reduced to such a simplestatement and even begin to adequately convey the horror they had gone through.But by the look on Jennsen’s face, she at least grasped a little bit of theterror that had gripped the land.“In order for Richard to return from the place where he had to go to stop theplague,” Kahlan said, leaving out terrible portions of the story, “he had totake the infection of plague. Had he not, he would have lived, but lived alonefor the rest of his life and died alone without ever seeing me or anyone elseagain. He took the plague into himself so that he could come back and tell me heloved me.”Jennsen stared, wide-eyed. “Didn’t you know he loved you?”Kahlan smiled a small bitter smile. “Don’t you think your mother would come backfrom the world of the dead to tell you she loves you, even though you know shedoes?”“Yes, I suppose she would. But why would you have to become infected just toreturn? And return from where?”“It was a place, called the Temple of the Winds, that was partially in theunderworld.” Richard gestured up the pass. “Something like that boundary waspart of the world of the dead but was still here, in this world. You might saythat the Temple of the Winds was something like that. It was hidden within theunderworld. Because I had to cross a boundary of sorts, through the underworld,the spirits set a price for me to return to the world of life.”“Spirits? You saw spirits there?” Jennsen asked. When Richard nodded, she asked,“Why would they set such a price?”“The spirit who set the price of my return was Darken Rahl.”Jennsen’s jaw dropped.“When we found Lord Rahl,” Cara said, “he was almost dead. The Mother Confessorwent on a dangerous journey through the sliph, all alone, to find what wouldcure him. She succeeded in bringing it back, but Lord Rahl was moments away fromdeath.”“I used the magic I recovered,” Kahlan said. “It was something that had thepower to reverse the plague that the magic had given him. The magic I invoked todo this was the three chimes.”“Three chimes?” Jennsen asked. “What are they?”“The chimes are underworld magic. Summoning their assistance keeps a person fromcrossing over into the world of the dead.“Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, at the time I didn’t know anything elseabout the chimes. It turns out that they were created during the great war toend magic. The chimes are beings of sorts, but without souls. They come from theunderworld. They annul magic in this world.”Jennsen looked confused. “But how can they accomplish such a thing?”“I don’t know how they work, exactly. But their presence in this world, sincethey are part of the world of the dead, begins the destruction of magic.”“Can’t you get rid of the chimes? Can’t you find a way to send them back?”“I already did that,” Richard said. “But while they were here, in this world,magic began to fail.”“Apparently,” Kahlan said, “what I began that day when I called the chimes intothe world of life began a cascade of events that continues to progress, eventhough the chimes have been sent back to the underworld.”“We don’t know that,” Richard said, more to Kahlan than to Jennsen.“Richard is right,” Kahlan told Jennsen, “we don’t know it for sure, but we havegood reason to believe it’s true. This boundary locking away Bandakar failed.The timing would suggest that it failed not long after I freed the chimes. Oneof those mistakes I told you about, before. Remember?”Jennsen, staring at Kahlan, finally nodded. “But you didn’t do it to hurtpeople. You didn’t know it would happen. You didn’t know how this boundary wouldfail, how the Order would go in there and abuse those people.”“Doesn’t really make any difference, does it? I did it. I caused it. Because ofme, magic may be failing. I accomplished what the Order is working so hard tobring about. As a result of what I did, all those people in Bandakar died, andothers are now out in the world where they will once again do as they did inancient times—they will begin breeding the gift out of mankind.“We stand at the brink of the end times of magic, all because of me, because ofwhat I did.”Jennsen stood frozen. “And so you regret what you caused? That you may have donesomething that will end magic?”Kahlan felt Richard’s arm around her waist. “I only know a world with magic,”she finally said. “I became the Mother Confessor—in part—to help protect peoplewith magic who are unable to protect themselves. I, too, am a creature ofmagic—it’s inextricably bound into me. I know profoundly beautiful things ofmagic that I love; they are a part of the world of life.”“So you fear you may have caused the end of what you love most.”“Not love most.” Kahlan smiled. “I became the Mother Confessor because I believein laws that protect all people, give all individuals the right to their ownlife. I would not want an artist’s ability to sculpt to be stopped, or asinger’s voice to be silenced, or a person’s mind to be stilled. Nor do I wantpeople’s ability to achieve what they can with magic to be stripped from them.“Magic itself is not the central issue, not what this is about. I want all theflowers, in all their variety, to have a chance to bloom. You are beautiful,too, Jennsen. I would not choose to lose you, either. Each person has a right tolife. The idea that there must be a choice of one over another is counter towhat we believe.”Jennsen smiled at Kahlan’s hand on her cheek. “Well, I guess that in a worldwithout magic, I could be queen.”On her way by with balsam boughs, Cara said, “Queens, too, must bow to theMother Confessor. Don’t forget it.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36Light flooded in as the lid of the box suddenly lifted. The rusty hinges groanedin protest of every inch the lid rose. Zedd squinted at the abrupt, blindinglight of day. Beefy arms flipped the hinged lid back. If there had been anyslack in the chain around his neck, Zedd would have jumped at the booming bangwhen the heavy cover flopped back, showering him in dirt and rusty grit.Between the bright light and the dust swirling through the air, Zedd couldhardly see. It didn’t help, either, that the short chain around his neck wasbolted to the center of the floor of the box, leaving only enough slack for himto be able to lift his head a few inches. With his arms bound in iron behind hisback, he could do little more than lie on the floor.While Zedd was forced to lie there on his side, his neck near the iron bolt, heat least could breathe in the sudden rush of cooler air. The heat in the box hadbeen sweltering. On a couple of occasions, when they had stopped at night, theyhad given him a cup of water. It had not been nearly enough. He and Adie hadbeen fed precious little, but it was water he needed more than food. Zedd feltlike he might die of thirst. He could hardly think of anything but water.He had lost track of the number of days he had been chained to the floor of thebox, but he was somewhat surprised to find himself still alive. The box had beenbouncing around in the back of a wagon over the course of a long, rough, butswift journey. He could only assume that he was being taken to Emperor Jagang.He was also sure that he would be sorry if he was still alive at the end of thejourney.There had been times, in the stifling heat of the box, when he had expected thathe would soon fade into unconsciousness and die. There were times when he longedto die. He was sure that falling into such a fatal sleep would be far preferableto what was in store for him. He had no choice, though; the control the Sisterexerted through the Rada’Han prevented him from strangling himself to death withthe chain, and it was pretty hard, he had discovered, to will himself to die.Zedd, his head still held to the floor of the box by the stub of chain, tried topeer up, but he could see only sky. He heard another lid bang open. He coughedas another cloud of dust drifted over him. When he heard Adie’s cough, he didn’tknow if he was relieved to know that she, too, was still alive, or sorry thatshe was, knowing what she, like he, would have to endure.Zedd was, in a way, ready for the torture he knew he would be subjected to. Hewas a wizard and had passed tests of pain. He feared such torture, but he wouldendure it until it finally ended his life. In his weakened condition, heexpected that it wouldn’t take all that long. In a way, such a time undertorture was like an old acquaintance come back to haunt him.But he feared the torture of Adie far more than his own. He hated above all elsethe torture of others. He hated to think of her coming under such treatment.The wagon shuddered as the front of the other box dropped open. A cry escapedAdie’s throat when a man struck her.“Move, you stupid old woman, so I can get at the lock!”Zedd could hear Adie’s shoes scraping the wooden crate as, hands bound behindher back, she tried to comply. By the sounds of fists on flesh, the man wasn’thappy with her efforts. Zedd closed his eyes, wishing he could close his ears aswell.The front of Zedd’s confining box crashed open, letting in more light and dust.A shadow fell across him as a man approached. Because his face was pinned to thefloor by the chain, Zedd couldn’t see the man.A big hand reached in, fitting a key to the lock. Zedd kept his head stretchedas far away as possible to give the man all the room available to let him do hiswork. Such effort earned Zedd a heavy punch in the side of his head. The blowleft his ears ringing.The lock finally sprang open. The man’s big fist seized Zedd by the hair anddragged him, like a sack of grain, out of the box and toward the rear of thewagon. Zedd pressed his lips together, to keep from crying out as his bonesbumped over protruding wooden runners in the wagon bed. At the back edge of thewagon he was summarily dumped off the back to slam down onto the ground.Ears ringing, head spinning, Zedd tried to sit up when he was kicked, knowing itwas a command. He spat out dirt. With his hands tied behind his back he washaving difficulty complying. After three kicks, a big man grabbed him by thehair and lifted him upright.Zedd’s heart sank to see that they sat among an army of astounding size. Thedark mass of humanity blighted the land as far as he could see. So, it wouldseem, they had arrived.Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Adie sitting in the dirt beside him, herhead hanging. She had a livid bruise on her cheek. She didn’t look up when ashadow fell across her.A woman in a long drab skirt moved in before them, distracting him from hisappraisal of the enemy forces. Zedd recognized the brown wool dress. It was theSister of the Dark who had put the collar around their necks. He didn’t know hername; she’d never offered it. In fact, she hadn’t spoken to them since they werechained in their boxes. She stood over them, now, like the strict governess ofincorrigible children.The ring through her lower lip, marking her as a slave, in Zedd’s mindirrevocably tarnished her air of authority.The ground was covered with horse manure, most, but not all, old and dried. Outbeyond the Sister, horses stood picketed seemingly without any order among thesoldiers. Horses that looked like they might belong to the cavalry were wellkept. Workhorses were not so healthy. Among the horses and men, wagons andstacks of supplies dotted the late-day landscape.The place had the foul stink of shallow latrines, horses, manure, and the filthysmell of crowded human habitation failing to meet common sanitary needs. Zeddblinked when acrid woodsmoke from one of the thousands of cook fires driftedacross him, burning his eyes.The air was also thick with mosquitoes, gnats, and flies. The flies were theworst. The mosquito bites would itch later, but the flies stung the instant theybit, and with his arms bound behind his back, there wasn’t much he could doabout it other than shake his head to try to keep them out of his eyes and nose.The two soldiers who had freed Zedd and Adie from their boxes stood patiently tothe sides. Beyond the woman’s skirts a vast encampment spread out as far as theeye could see. There were men everywhere, men engaged in work, at rest, and atrecreation. They were dressed in every variety of clothing, from leather armor,chain mail, and studded belts to hides, dirty tunics, and trousers in theprocess of rotting into rags. Most of the men were unshaven, and all were asfilthy as feral recluses living in mad seclusion. The mass encampment generateda constant din of yells, whistles, men hollering and laughing, the jangle andrattle of metal, the ring of hammers or rhythm of saws, and, piercing through itall, the occasional cry of someone in agonizing pain.Tents by the thousands, tents of all sorts, like leaves after a big wind, laylittering the gently rolling landscape at the foothills of towering mountains tothe east. Many a tent was decorated with loot; gingham curtains hung at anentrance, a small chair or table sat before a tent, here and there an item ofwomen’s personal clothing flew as a flag of conquest. Wagons and horses and gearwere all jammed together among the rabble in no seeming plan. The ground hadbeen churned to a fine dust by the masses in this mock city devoid of skeletalorder.The place was a nightmare of humanity reduced to the savagery of a mob on theloose, the scope of their goals no more than the impulse of the moment. Thoughtheir leaders had ends, these men did not.“His Excellency has requested you both,” the Sister said down to them.Neither Zedd nor Adie said anything. The men hauled them both to their feet. Asharp shove started them moving behind the Sister after she marched away. Zeddnoticed, then, that there were more soldiers, close to a dozen, escorting them.The wagon had delivered them to the end of a road, of sorts, that ran a windingcourse through the sprawling encampment. The end of the road, where wagons satin a row, appeared to be the entrance to an inner camp, probably a command area.The regular soldiers outside a ring of heavily armed guards ate, played dice,gambled, bartered loot, joked, talked, and drank as they watched the prisonersbeing escorted.The thought occurred to Zedd that if he called out, proclaiming that he was theone who was responsible for the light spell that had killed or wounded so manyof their chums, maybe the men would riot, set upon them, and kill them beforeJagang had a chance to do his worst.Zedd opened his mouth to try out his plan, but saw the Sister glance back overher shoulder. He discovered that his voice was muted through her control of thecollar around his neck. There would be no speaking unless she allowed it.Following the Sister, they walked past the standing row of wagons in front ofthe one that had brought them. There were well over a dozen freight wagons alllined up before the cordoned-off area with the larger tents. None of the wagonswere empty, but all were loaded with crates.With sinking realization, Zedd understood. These were wagons with goods lootedfrom the Wizard’s Keep. These were all wagons that had made the journey withthem. They were all full of the things those ungifted men, at the Sister’sorders, had taken out of the Keep. Zedd feared to think what priceless items ofprofound danger sat in these crates. There were things in the Keep that becamehazardous to anyone should they be removed from the shields that guarded them.There were rare items that, if removed from their protective environment, suchas darkness, for even a brief time, would cease to be viable.Guards in layered hides, mail, leather, and armed with pikes set with long steelpoints flanked by sharpened winged blades, huge crescent axes, swords, andspiked maces prowled the restricted area. These grim soldiers were bigger andmore menacing-looking than the regular men out in the camp—and those werefearsome enough. While the special guards patrolled, ever watchful, theunconcerned regular soldiers just outside the perimeter carried on with theirbusiness.The guards led the Sister, Zedd, and Adie through an opening in a line of spikedbarricades. Beyond were the smaller of the special tents. Most were round andthe same size. Zedd thought that these were probably the tents of the staff theemperor would keep close, his attendants and personal slaves. Zedd wondered ifthe Sisters were all held within the emperor’s compound.Up ahead, the palatial vision of the grand tents of an emperor and his entouragerose up in the late-afternoon light. No doubt some of these comfortable tentsset about the center compound, within the ring of tents for servants andattendants, were accommodations for high-ranking officers, officials, and theemperor’s most trusted advisors.Zedd wished he had a light spell and the ability to ignite it. He could probablydecapitate the Imperial Order right then and there.But he knew that such confusion and turmoil would only be a temporary setbackfor the Imperial Order. They would provide another brute to enforce theirmessage. It would take more than killing Jagang to end the threat of the Order.He wasn’t even sure anymore just what it would take to free the world of theoppression and tyranny of the Imperial Order.Despite the seductively simplistic notions held by most people, the EmperorJagang was not the driving force of this invasion. The driving force was avicious ideology. To exist, it could not permit successful lives to be lived insight of the suffering masses produced as a result of the beliefs and dictatesof the Imperial Order. The freedom and resulting success of the people living inthe New World put the lie to all the Order preached. It was blasphemy to succeedon your own; since the Order taught that it could not be done, it could only besinful. Sin had to be eliminated for the greater good. Therefore, the freedom ofthe New World had to be crushed.“These the ones?” a guard with short-cropped hair asked. The rings hanging fromhis nose and ears reminded Zedd of a prized pig decorated for the summer fair.Of course, prized pigs would have been washed and clean and would have smelledbetter.“Yes,” the Sister said. “Both of them, as instructed.”With deliberate care the man’s dark-eyed gaze took in Adie and then Zedd. By hisscowl, he apparently thought himself a righteous man who was displeased withwhat he saw: evil. After noting the collars they both wore, showing that theywould be no danger to the emperor, he stepped aside and lifted a thumb,directing them through a second barricade beyond the tents of the attendants,servants, and slaves. The guard’s glare followed the sinners on their way tomeet their proper fate.Other men, from inside the inner compound, swept in to surround them. Zedd sawthat these men wore more orderly outfits. They were layered in similar leatherand mail, wearing heavy leather weapon belts, their chests crisscrossed withstudded straps. There was a uniformity to them, a sameness, that showed thesewere special guards. The weapons hung on those wide belts were better made, andthey carried more of them. By the way they moved, Zedd knew that these were nottypical men rounded up to be soldiers, but trained men with highly developedtalents for warfare.These were the emperor’s elite bodyguards.Zedd looked longingly at the nearly full water bucket set out for the menstanding guard in the heat. It wouldn’t do, if you were an emperor, to have yourelite guards falling over from lack of water. Knowing what the response waslikely to be, Zedd didn’t ask for a drink. A sidelong glance showed Adie lickingher cracked lips, but she, too, remained silent.Up a slight rise sat by far the largest and grandest of the tents, among theimpressive but lesser quarters of the emperor’s retinue. The emperor’s tentappeared more a traveling palace, actually, than a tent. It boasted a tri-peakedroof pierced by high poles bearing colorful standards and flags. Brightlyembroidered panels adorned the exterior walls. Red and yellow banners flappedlazily in the hot, late-day air. Tassels and streamers all around it made itlook like a central gathering tent at a festival.A guard flanking a doorway met Zedd’s gaze before he lifted aside the lambskincovered with shields of gold and hammered medallions of silver, allowing thementrance. One of the other guards stiff-armed Zedd’s shoulder, nearly knockinghim sprawling. Zedd staggered through the doorway into the dimly lit interior,Adie stumbling in after him.Inside, the raucous noise of the encampment was muted by layers of rich carpetsplaced haphazardly. Hundreds of silk and brocade pillows lined the edge of thefloor. Colorfully decorated hangings divided up the murky interior space andcovered the outer walls. Openings overhead, screened with gauzy material, let inlittle light but did allow some air to move through the quiet gloom of the grandtent. It was so dim, in fact, that lamps and candles were needed.In the middle of the room, toward the back, sat an ornate chair draped withrich, red silks. If this was Emperor Jagang’s throne, he was not in it.While guards surrounded Zedd and Adie, keeping them restricted in place, one ofthe men went off behind the fabric walls from where a glow of light came. Theguards standing close around Zedd stank of sweat. Their shoes were caked withmanure. For all the sumptuous surroundings doing their best to simulate areverent aura, a sacred setting, an abiding barnyard stench permeated the place.The horse manure and human sweat of the men who had entered the tent with Zeddand Adie were only making it worse.The man who had gone behind the walls poked his head back out, signaling theSister forward. He whispered to her and then she, too, disappeared behind thewalls.Zedd stole a look at Adie. Her completely white eyes stared ahead. He shiftedhis weight as an excuse to lean toward her and stealthily touched her shoulderwith his, a message of comfort where there could be none. She returned a slightpush; message received, and appreciated. He longed to embrace her, but knew heprobably never would again.Muffled words could be heard, but the heavy wall hangings muted them so thatZedd couldn’t understand any of it. Had he access to his gift, he would havebeen able to hear it all, but the collar cut him off from his ability. Even so,the nature of the Sister’s report, the words, were short and businesslike.Those slaves working in the tent at brushing carpets, or polishing fine vases,or waxing cabinets paid no attention to the people the guards had brought in,but the sudden, low tone of menace that came from beyond the wall caused themall to put markedly more attention into their work. While no doubt prisonerswere brought before the emperor often enough, Zedd was sure that it would not bewise for those working in the grand tent to pay any notice to the emperor’sbusiness.From beyond the walls composed of woven scenes also came the warm smell of food.The variety of scents Zedd was able to detect was astonishing. The stink of theplace, though, tended to make the fragrant aromas of meats, olive oil, garlic,onions, and spices somewhat repugnant.The Sister stepped out from behind the wall of colorful hangings. The ringthrough her lower lip stood out in stark relief against her ashen skin. She gavea slight nod to the men to either side of the prisoners.Powerful fingers gripping their arms, Zedd and Adie were ushered toward theopening and the glow of light beyond."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37Dragged to an abrupt halt, Zedd, at last, stood shackled before the intentglower of the dream walker himself, Emperor Jagang.Enthroned in an ornately carved high-backed chair behind a grand dining table,Jagang leaned on both elbows, a goose leg spanning his fingers as he chewed.Points of candlelight reflecting off the sides of his shaved head danced as thetendons all the way up through his temples rippled with his chewing. A thinmustache, growing down from the corners of his mouth and at the center under hislower lip, moved rhythmically in time with his jaw, as did the fine chainconnected to gold loops in his ear and nose. Greasy goose fat covering hismeaty, ringed fingers glistened in the candlelight and ran down his bare arms.From his place behind his table, Jagang casually studied his latest captives.Despite the candles set about the table and on stands to either side, the insideof the tent had the murky feel of a dungeon.To each side of him on the broad table sat plates of food, goblets, bottles,candles, bowls, and, here and there, books and scrolls. There being no room forall of the silver platters among the multitude, some of them had to bestrategically balanced atop small decorated pillars. There looked to be enoughfood for a small army.For all the Order’s talk of sacrifice for the betterment of mankind being theirnoble cause, Zedd knew that such abundance at the emperor’s table was meant tosend a contradictory message, even when there was no one but the emperor himselfto see it.Slaves stood lined up along the wall behind Jagang, some holding additionalplatters, some in stiff poses, all awaiting command. Some of those in back wereyoung men—young wizards, from what Zedd had heard—dressed in loose-fitting whitetrousers and nothing else. This was where wizards in training at the Palace ofthe Prophets had ended up, along with the captured Sisters who had been theirteachers. All were now captives of the dream walker. The most accomplished ofmen, men with enormous potential, were used as houseboys to perform menialtasks. This, too, was a message sent by the emperor of the Imperial Order toshow everyone that the best and the brightest were to be used to clean chamberpots, while brutes ruled them.The younger women, Sisters of both the Dark and the Light, Zedd assumed, woreoutfits that ran from neck to wrist to ankle, but were so transparent that thewomen might as well have been naked. This, too, was meant to show that EmperorJagang thought little of these women’s talents, and valued them only for hispleasure. The older, less attractive women standing off to the sides wore drabclothes. These were probably Sisters who served the emperor in other menialways.Jagang delighted in having under his control, as slaves, some of the most giftedpeople in the world. It suited the nature of the Order to demean those withability, rather than to celebrate them.Jagang watched Zedd taking in the house slaves, but showed no emotion. The dreamwalker’s bull neck made him look almost other than human. The muscles of hischest, as well as his massive shoulders, were displayed by an open, sleevelesslamb’s-wool vest. He was as powerful and brawny a man as Zedd had seen, anintimidating presence even at rest.As Zedd and Adie stood mute, Jagang’s teeth tore off another chunk of meat fromthe goose leg. In the tense silence, he watched them as he chewed, as ifdeciding what he might do with his newest plunder.More than anything, it was his inky black eyes, devoid of any pupils, irises, orwhites, that threatened to halt the blood in Zedd’s veins. The last time he hadseen those eyes, Zedd had not been shackled, but that ungifted girl hadprevented Zedd from finishing the man. That was going to turn out to be themissed opportunity that Zedd would most regret. His chance to kill Jagang hadslipped through his fingers that day, not because of the vast power of all theskilled Sisters and troops arrayed against him, but all because of a singleungifted girl.Those black eyes, the eyes of a mature dream walker, glistened in thecandlelight. Across their dark voids, dim shapes shifted, like clouds on amoonless night.The directness of the dream walker’s gaze was as obvious as was Adie’s when shelooked at Zedd with her pure white eyes. Under Jagang’s direct glare, Zedd hadto remind himself to relax his muscles, and remember to breathe.The thing about those eyes that most terrified him, though, was what he saw inthem: a keen, calculating mind. Zedd had fought against Jagang long enough tohave come to understand that one underestimated this man at great peril.“Jagang the Just,” the Sister said, holding an introductory hand out to thenightmare before them. “Excellency, this is Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander, FirstWizard, and a sorceress by the name of Adie.”“I know who they are,” Jagang said in a deep voice as heavy with threat as withdistaste.He leaned back, hanging one arm over the back of the chair and one leg over acarved arm. He gestured with the goose leg.“Richard Rahl’s grandfather, as I hear told.”Zedd said nothing.Jagang tossed the partially eaten leg on a platter and picked up a knife. Withone hand he sawed a chunk of red meat off a roast and stabbed it. Elbow on thetable, he waved the knife as he spoke. Red juice ran down the blade.“Probably not the way you had hoped to meet me.”He laughed at his own joke, a deep, resonating sound alive with menace.With his teeth, Jagang drew the chunk of meat off the knife and chewed as hewatched them, as if unable to decide on a wealth of delightfully terribleoptions parading through his thoughts.He washed the meat down with a gulp from a jeweled silver goblet, his gaze neverleaving them. “I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you have come to visitme.”His grin was like death itself. “Alive.”He rolled his wrist, circling the knife. “We have a lot to talk about.” Hislaugh died out, but the grin remained. “Well, you do, anyway. I’ll be a goodhost and listen.”Zedd and Adie remained silent as Jagang’s black-eyed gaze went from one to theother.“Not so talkative, just yet? Well, no matter. You will be babbling soon enough.”Zedd didn’t waste the effort telling Jagang that torture would gain him nothing.Jagang would not believe any such boast, and even if he did, it would hardlystay his wish to see it done.Jagang fingered a few grapes from a bowl. “You are a resourceful man, WizardZorander.” He popped several grapes in his mouth and chewed as he spoke. “Allalone there in Aydindril, with an army surrounding you, you managed to gull meinto thinking I had trapped Richard Rahl and the Mother Confessor. Quite atrick. I must give you credit where credit is due.“And the light spell you ignited among my men, that was remarkable.” He putanother grape in his mouth. “Do you have any idea how many hundreds of thousandsof them were caught up in your wizardry?”Zedd could see the corded muscles in the man’s hairy arm draped over the back ofthe chair stand out as he flexed the fist. He relaxed the hand then and leanedforward, using his thumb to gouge out a long chunk of ham.He waved the meat as he went on. “It’s that kind of magic I need you to do forme, good wizard. I understand, from the stupid bitches I have who callthemselves the Sisters of the Light, or the Sisters of the Dark, depending onwho they’ve decided can offer better favors in the afterlife, that you probablydidn’t conjure that little bit of magic on your own, but, rather, you used aconstructed spell from the Wizard’s Keep and simply ignited it among my men withsome kind of trick, or trigger—probably some small curiosity that one of thempicked up and in the act of having a look, they set it off.”Zedd was somewhat alarmed that Jagang had been able to learn so much. Theemperor took a big bite off the end of the piece of ham as he watched them. Hisindulgent look was beginning to wear thin.“So, since you can’t do such marvelous magic yourself, I’ve had a few itemsbrought from the Keep so you can tell me how they work, what they do. I’m surethere must be a great number of intriguing items among the inventory. I’d liketo have some of those conjured spells so they can blow open a few of the passesinto D’Hara for us. It would save me some time and trouble. I’m sure you canunderstand my eagerness to be into D’Hara and have this petty resistance finallyover with.”Zedd heaved a deep breath and finally spoke. “For most of those items, you couldtorture me to the end of time and I still wouldn’t be able to tell you anythingbecause I don’t have any knowledge of them. Unlike you, I know my own limits. Isimply don’t know what such a spell might look like. Even if I did, that doesn’tmean I would know how to work it. I was simply lucky with that one I used.”“Maybe, maybe, but you do know about some of the items. You are, after all, as Ihear told, First Wizard; it is your Keep. To claim ignorance of the things in itis hardly credible. Despite your claim of luck, you managed to know enough aboutthat constructed light web to ignite it among my men, so you obviously haveknowledge about the most powerful of the items.”“You don’t know the first thing about magic,” Zedd snapped. “You have a headfull of grand ideas and you think all you have to do is command they be done.Well, they can’t. You’re a fool who doesn’t know the first thing about realmagic or its limits.”An eyebrow lifted over one of Jagang’s inky eyes. “Oh, I think I know more thanyou might think, wizard. You see, I love to read, and I, well, I have theadvantage of perusing some of the most remarkably gifted minds you can imagine.I probably know a great deal more about magic than you give me credit for.”“I give you credit for bold self-delusion.”“Self-delusion?” He spread his arms. “Can you create a Slide, Wizard Zorander?”Zedd froze. Jagang had heard the name; that was all. The man liked to read. He’dread that name somewhere.“Of course not, and neither can anyone else alive today.”“You can’t create such a being, Wizard Zorander. But you have no idea how much Iknow about magic. You see, I’ve learned to bring lost talents back to life—artsthat have long been believed to be dead and vanished.”“I give you the grandiosity of your dreaming, Jagang, but dreaming is easy. Yourdreams can’t be made real just because you dream them and decide that you wishthem to come alive.”“Sister Tahirah, here, knows the truth of it.” Jagang gestured with his knife.“Tell him, darlin. Tell him what I can dream and what I can bring to life.”The woman hesitantly stepped forward several paces. “It is as His Excellencysays.” She looked away from Zedd’s frown to fuss with her wiry gray hair. “WithHis Excellency’s brilliant direction, we were able to bring back some of the oldknowledge. With the expert guidance of our emperor, we were able to invest in awizard named Nicholas an ability not seen in the world for three thousand years.It is one of His Excellency’s greatest achievements. I can personally assure youthat it is as His Excellency says; a Slide again walks the world. It is nofancy, Wizard Zorander, but the truth.“The spirits help me,” she added under her breath, “I was there to see the Slideborn into the world.”“You created a Slide?” Fists still bound behind his back, Zedd took an angrystride toward the Sister. “Are you out of your mind, woman!” She retreated tothe back wall. Zedd turned his fury on Jagang. “Slides were a catastrophe! Theycan’t be controlled! You would have to be crazy to create one!”Jagang smiled. “Jealous, wizard? Jealous that you are unable to accomplish sucha thing, can’t create such a weapon against me, while I can create one to takeRichard Rahl and his wife from you?”“A Slide has powers you couldn’t possibly control.”“A Slide is no danger to a dream walker. My ability is quicker than his. I amhis better.”“It doesn’t matter how quick you are—it isn’t about being quick! A Slide can’tbe controlled and he isn’t going to do what you want!”“I seem to be controlling him just fine.” Jagang leaned in on an elbow. “Youthink magic is necessary to control those you would master, but I don’t needmagic. Not with Nicholas nor with mankind.“You seem to be obsessed with control, I am not. I managed to find a peoplethose like you didn’t want to walk freely among their fellow man, a people castout by the gifted, a people reviled for not having any spark of your preciousgift of magic—a people hated and banished because your kind wasn’t able tocontrol them. That was their crime: being outside the control of your magic.”Jagang’s fist slammed the table. The slaves all jumped with the platters.“This is how your kind wants mankind’s future to be; your kind wants only thosewith a spark of the gift to be allowed to walk free. This, so you can use yourgift to control them! Like that collar around your neck, your lust is to collarall of mankind with magic.“I found those outcast ungifted people and have brought them back into the foldof their fellow man. Much to your disapproval and the loathing of your kind,they can’t be touched by your vile magic.”Zedd couldn’t imagine where Jagang had found such people. “And so now you have aSlide to control them for you.”“Your kind condemned and banished them; we have welcomed them among us. In fact,we wish to model man himself after them. Our cause is theirs by their verynature—purity of mankind without any taint of magic. In this way the world willbe one and at last at peace.“I have the advantage over you, wizard; I have right on my side. I don’t needmagic to win; you do. I have mankind’s best future in mind and have set ourirreversible course.“With the help of these people, I took your Keep. With their help, I haverecovered invaluable treasures from within. You couldn’t do a thing to stopthem, now could you? Man will now set his own course, without the curse of magicdarkening his struggle.“I now have a Slide to help us to that noble end. He is working with thosepeople for the benefit of our cause. In doing so, Nicholas has already provedinvaluable.“What’s more, that Slide, which your kind could never control, has vowed todeliver to me the two I want most: your grandson and his wife. I have greatthings planned for them—well, for her, anyway.” His red-faced rage melted into agrin. “For him, not so great things.”Zedd could hardly contain his own rage. Were it not for the collar stifling hisgift, he would have reduced the entire place to ash by now.“Once this Nicholas becomes adept at what he can do, you will find that he willwant revenge of his own, and a price you may find far too high.”Jagang spread his arms. “There, you are wrong, wizard. I can afford whateverNicholas wants for Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor. There is no such thing asa price too high.“You may think me greedy and selfish, but you would be wrong. While I enjoy thespoils, I most relish the role I play in bringing heathens to heel. It is theend that truly concerns me, and in the end I will have mankind bow as theyshould to our just cause and the Creator’s ways.”Jagang seemed to have spent his flash of intensity. He leaned back and scoopedwalnuts from a silver bowl.“Zedd be wrong,” Adie finally spoke up. “You have shown us that you know whatyou be doing. You will be able to control your Slide just fine. May I suggestyou keep him close, to aid you in your efforts.”Jagang smiled at her. “You, too, my dried-up old sorceress, will be telling meall you know about what is in those crates.”“Bah,” Adie scoffed. “You be a fool with worthless treasures. I hope you pull amuscle carrying them with you everywhere.”“Adie’s right,” Zedd put in. “You are an incompetent oaf who is only going to—”“Oh, come, come, you two. Do you think you will throw me into a fit of rage andI’ll slaughter the both of you on the spot?” His wicked grin returned. “Spareyou the proper justice of what is to come?”Zedd and Adie fell silent.“When I was a boy,” Jagang said in a quieter tone as he stared off into thedistance, “I was nothing. A street tough in Altur’Rang. A bully. A thief. Mylife was empty. My future was the next meal.“One day, I saw a man coming down the street. He looked like he might have somemoney and I wanted it. It was getting dark. I came up silently behind him,intending to bash in his head, but just then he turned and looked me in the eye.“His smile stopped me in my tracks. It wasn’t a kindly smile, or a weak smile,but the kind of smile a man gives you when he knows he can kill you where youstand if it pleases him.“He pulled a coin from his pocket and flipped it to me, and then, without aword, turned and went on his way.“A few weeks later, in the middle of the night, I woke up in an alley, where Islept under old blankets and crates, and I saw a shadowy form out by the street.I knew it was him before he flipped me the coin and moved off into the darkness.“The next time I saw him, he was sitting on a stone bench at the edge of an oldsquare that some of the less fortunate men of Altur’Rang frequented. Like me, noone would give these men a chance in life. People’s greed had sucked the lifeout of these men. I used to go there to look at them, to tell myself I didn’twant to grow up to be like them, but I knew I would, a nobody, human refusewaiting to pass into the shadow of oblivion in the afterlife. A soul withoutworth.“I sat down on the bench beside the man and asked him why he’d given me money.Instead of giving me some answer that most people would give a boy, he told meabout mankind’s grand purpose, the meaning of life, and how we are here only asa brief stop on the way to what the Creator has in store for us—if we are strongenough to rise to the challenge.“I’d never heard such a thing. I told him that I didn’t think that such thingsmattered in my life because I was only a thief. He said that I was only strikingback from the injustice of my lot in life. He said that mankind was evil formaking me the way I was and only through sacrifice and helping those like mecould man hope to be redeemed in the afterlife. He opened my mind to man’ssinful ways.“Before he left, he turned back and asked me if I knew how long eternity was. Isaid no. He said that our miserable time in this world was but a blink before weentered the next world. That really made me think, for the first time, about ourgreater purpose.“Over the next months, Brother Narev took the time to talk to me, to tell meabout Creation and eternity. He gave me a vision of a possible better futurewhere before I had none. He taught me about sacrifice and redemption. I thoughtI was doomed to an eternity of darkness until he showed me the light.“He took me in, in return for helping him with life’s chores.“For me, Brother Narev was a teacher, a priest, an advisor, a means tosalvation”—Jagang’s gaze rose to Zedd—”and a grandfather, all rolled into one.“He gave me the fire of what mankind can and should be. He showed me the truesin of selfish greed and the dark void of where it would lead mankind. Overtime, he made me the fist of his vision. He was the soul; I was the bone andmuscle.“Brother Narev allowed me the honor of igniting the revolution. He placed me atthe fore of the rise of mankind over the oppression of sinfulness. We are thenew hope for the future of man, and Brother Narev himself allowed me to be theone to carry his vision in the cleansing flames of mankind’s redemption.”Jagang leaned back in his chair, fixing Zedd with as grim a look as Zedd hadever seen.“And then this spring, while carrying Brother Narev’s noble challenge tomankind, to those who had never had a chance to see the vision of what man canbe, of the future without the blight of magic and oppression and greed andgroveling to be better than others, I came to Aydindril... and what do I find?“Brother Narev’s head on a pike, with a note, ‘Compliments of Richard Rahl.’“The man I admired most in the world, the man who brought to us all the halloweddream of mankind’s true purpose in this life as charged by the Creator himself,was dead, his head stuck on a pike by your grandson.“If ever there was a greater blasphemy, a greater crime against the whole ofmankind, I don’t know of it.”Sullen shapes shifted across Jagang’s black eyes. “Richard Rahl will be dealtjustice. He will suffer such a blow, before I send him to the Keeper. I justwanted you to know your fate, old man. Your grandson will know something of thatkind of pain, and the additional torment of knowing that I have his bride andwill make her pay dearly for her own crimes.” A ghost of the grin returned.“After he has paid this price, then I will kill him.”Zedd yawned. “Nice story. You left out all the parts where you slaughterinnocent people by the tens of thousands because they don’t want to live underyour vile rule or Narev’s sick, twisted vision.“On second thought, don’t bother with the sorry excuses. Just cut off my head,put it on a pike, and be done with it.”Jagang’s smile returned in its full glory. “Not as easily as that, old man.First you have some talking to do.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38Ah, yes,” Zedd said. “The torture. I almost forgot.”“Torture?”With two fingers Jagang signaled a woman to the side. The older Sister standingwringing her hands flinched at seeing his gaze on her and immediately rushed offbehind a curtain of wall hangings. Zedd could hear her whispering urgentinstructions to people beyond, and then the thump of feet rushing across thecarpets and out of the tent.Jagang went back to his leisurely meal while Zedd and Adie stood before him,starving, dying of thirst. The dream walker finally set his knife across aplate. Seeing this, the slaves sprang into action, clearing away the variety ofdishes, most having been tasted, but that hardly made a dent in them. In amatter of moments the entire table was emptied of the food and drink, leavingonly the books, the scrolls, the candles, and the silver bowl of walnuts.Sister Tahirah, the Sister who had captured Zedd and Adie at the Keep, stood tothe side, her hands clasped before her as she watched them. Despite her obviousfear of Jagang, and her servile fawning over the man, the knowing smirk at Zeddand Adie betrayed the pleasure she was deriving from what was to come.When half a dozen grisly men entered the room and stood off to the side, Zeddbegan to understand what it was that pleased Sister Tahirah.They were unkempt, brawny, and as merciless-looking as any men Zedd had everseen. Their hair was wildly tangled and greasy. Their hands and forearms werespattered with sooty smears, their fingernails ragged and foul. Their filthyclothes were stained dark with dried blood from the labor of their profession.These men worked at torture.Zedd looked away from the Sister’s steady gaze. She hoped to see fear, panic, orperhaps sobbing.Then a group of men and women were ushered into the dim room in the emperor’stent. They looked to be farmers or humble working folk, probably picked up bypatrols. The men embraced their wives as children huddled around the women’sskirts like chicks around hens. The people were herded over to the side of theroom, opposite the line of torturers.Zedd’s eyes suddenly turned to Jagang. The dream walker’s black eyes werewatching him as he chewed a walnut.“Emperor,” said the Sister who had brought the families in, “these are some ofthe local people, people from the countryside, as you requested.” She held anintroductory hand out. “Good people, this is our revered emperor, Jagang theJust. He brings the light of the Imperial Order to the world, guided by theCreator’s wisdom, that we might all lead better lives and find salvation withthe Creator in the afterlife.”Jagang surveyed the cluster of Midlanders as they awkwardly bowed and curtsied.Zedd felt sick at seeing the timid terror on their faces. They would have had towalk through the encampment of Order soldiers. They would have seen the size ofthe force that had overrun their homeland.Jagang lifted his arm toward Zedd. “Perhaps you know this man? This is FirstWizard Zorander. He is one who has ruled you with his command of magic. As youcan see, he is now shackled before us. We have freed you from the wicked rule ofthis man and those like him.”The people’s eyes darted between Zedd and Jagang, unsure of their role in theemperor’s tent, or what they were supposed to do. They finally bobbed theirheads, mumbling their thanks for their liberation.“The gifted, like these two, could have used their ability to help mankind.Instead, they used it for themselves. Where they should have sacrificed forthose in need, they were selfish. It is criminal to behave as they have, live asthey have, with all they have. It makes me angry to think of all they could dofor those in need, those like you poor people, were it not for their selfishways. People suffer and die without the help they could have had, without thehelp these people could have given, were they not so self-centered.“This wizard and his sorceress are here because they have refused to help usfree the rest of the people of the New World by telling us the function of thevile things of magic we have captured along with them—things of magic theyscheme to use to slaughter untold numbers of people. This selfish wizard andsorceress do this out of spite that they could not have their way.”All the wide eyes turned to Zedd and Adie.“I could tell you people of the vast numbers of deaths this man is responsiblefor, but I fear you would be unable to fathom it. I can tell you that I simplycannot allow this man to be responsible for tens of thousands more deaths.”Jagang smiled at the children then and gestured with both hands, urging them tocome to him. The children, a dozen or so, from six or seven to maybe twelve,clung to their parents. Jagang’s gaze rose to those parents as he again motionedthe children to come to him. The parents understood and reluctantly urged theirchildren to do as the emperor bid of them.The clump of innocence haltingly approached Jagang’s outstretched arms and widegrin. He embraced them woodenly as they shuffled in close around him. He tousledthe blond hair of a boy, and then the straight sandy hair of a girl. Several ofthe younger ones peered pleadingly back at parents before cringing at Jagang’smeaty hand on their backs, his jovial pat on their cheek.Silent terror hung thick in the air.It was as frightening a sight as Zedd had ever witnessed.“Well, now,” the smiling emperor said, “let me get to the reason I have calledupon you people.”His powerful arms gathered the children before him. As a Sister blocked a boywanting to return to his parents, Jagang put his huge hands on a young girl’swaist and set her upon his knee. The girl’s wide eyes stared up at the smilingface, the bald head, but mostly at the nightmare void of the dream walker’s inkyeyes.Jagang looked from the girl back to the parents. “You see, the wizard andsorceress have refused to offer their help. In order to save a great many lives,I must have their cooperation. They must answer honestly all my questions. Theyrefuse. I’m hoping you good people can convince them to tell us what we need toknow in order to save the lives of a great many people, and free a great manymore from the oppression of their magic.”Jagang looked toward the row of men standing silently against the opposite wall.With a single tilt of his head, he commanded them forward.“What are you doing?” a woman asked, even as her husband tried to restrain her.“What do you intend?”“What I intend,” Jagang told the crowd of parents, “is for you good people toconvince the wizard and the sorceress to talk. I’m going to put you in a tentalone with them so that you can persuade them to do their duty tomankind—persuade them to cooperate with us.”As the men began seizing the children, they finally burst out in frightenedcrying. The parents, seeing their red-faced children bawling in terror, criedout themselves and rushed forward to retrieve them. The big men, each holdingone or two little arms in a fist, shoved the parents back.The parents fell to hysterical screaming for the children to be freed.“I’m sorry, but I can’t do that,” Jagang said over the wails of the children. Hetilted his head again and the men started carting the twisting, screamingchildren out of the tent. The parents were wailing as well, trying to reach inpast big filthy arms to touch what was to them most precious in the world.The parents were bewildered and horrified, fearing to cross a line that wouldbring wrath down on their children, yet not wanting them to be carted away.Against their urgent pleading, the children were swiftly whisked away.As the children were taken out, the Sisters immediately blocked the doorwaybehind them, keeping the parents from following. The tent fell to pandemonium.With the single word “silence” from Jagang, and his fist on the table, everyonefell silent.“Now,” Jagang said, “these two prisoners are going to be confined to a tent. Allof you are going to be in there, alone, with them. There will be no guards, nowatchers.”“But what about our children?” a woman in tears begged, caring nothing aboutZedd and Adie.Jagang pulled a squat candle toward him on the table. “This will be the tentwith these two, and you good people.” He circled a finger around the candle.“All around this tent with you and the criminals, there will be other tentsclose.”Everyone stared at his ringed finger going round and round the candle. “Yourchildren will be close by, in these tents.” Jagang scooped up a handful ofwalnuts from the silver bowl. He dribbled some onto the table around the candleand put the rest into his mouth.The room was silent as they all stared at him, watching him chew the walnuts,afraid to ask a question, afraid to hear what he might say next.Finally a woman could no longer hold her tongue. “Why will they be there, inthose tents?”Jagang’s black eyes took them all in before he spoke, making sure none wouldmiss what he had to tell them.“Those men who took your children to those tents will be torturing them.”The parents’ eyes widened. Blood drained from their faces. One woman fainted.Several others bent to her. Sister Tahirah squatted beside the woman and toucheda hand to the woman’s forehead. The woman’s eyes popped open. The Sister toldthe women to get her to her feet.When Jagang was satisfied that he had everyone’s attention, he circled a fingeraround the candle again, over the walnuts around it. “The tents will be closearound so you can all clearly hear your children being tortured, to be sure thatyou understand that they will not be spared the worst those men can do.”The parents stood frozen, staring, seemingly unable to believe the reality ofwhat they were hearing.“Every few hours, I will come to see if you good people have convinced thewizard and the sorceress to tell us what we need to know. If you have notsucceeded, then I will go off to other business and when I have the time I willreturn again to check if these two have decided to talk.“Just be sure that this wizard and sorceress do not die while you convince themto be reasonable. If they die, then they can’t answer our questions. Only whenand if they answer questions will the children be released.”Jagang turned his nightmare eyes on Zedd. “My men have a great deal ofexperience at torturing people. When you hear the screams coming from the tentsall around, you will have no doubt as to their skill, or their determination. Ithink you should know that they can keep their guests alive under torture fordays, but they cannot work miracles. People, especially such young, tendersouls, cannot survive indefinitely. But, should these children die before youagree to cooperate, there are plenty more families with children who can taketheir place.”Zedd could not halt the tears that ran down his face to drip off his chin asSister Tahirah took his arm and pulled him toward the doorway. The crowd ofparents fell on him, clawing at his clothes, screaming and crying for him to doas the emperor asked.Zedd dug in his heels and struggled to a stop before the table. Desperate handsclutched at his robes. As he looked around at their tear-stained faces, meetingthe eyes of each, they fell silent.“I hope you people can now understand the nature of what it is we are fighting.I am so sorry, but I cannot dull the pain of this darkest hour of your lives. IfI were to do as this man wants, countless more children would be subjected tothis tyrant’s brutality. I know that you will not be able to weigh this againstthe precious lives of your children, but I must. Pray the good spirits take themquickly, and take them to a place of eternal peace.”Zedd could not say more to them, to their desperate gazes. He turned his wateryeyes to Jagang. “This will not work, Jagang. I know you will do it anyway, butit will not work.”Behind the heavy table, Jagang slowly rose. “Children in this land of yours areplentiful. How many are you prepared to sacrifice before you allow mankind to befree? How long are you willing to persist in your stubborn refusal to allow themto have a future free from suffering, want, and your uninspired morals?”The heavy gold and silver chains around his neck, the looted medallions andornaments resting against his muscled chest, and the rings of kings on hisfingers all sparkled in the candlelight.Zedd felt the numb weight of a hopeless future under the yoke of the monstrousideals of this man and his ilk.“You cannot win in this, wizard. Like all those who fight on your side tooppress mankind, to allow the common people to be left to cruel fate, you arenot even willing to sacrifice for the sake of the lives of children. You arebrave with words, but you have a cold soul and a weak heart. You don’t have thewill to do what must be done to prevail. I do.”Jagang tilted his head and the Sister shoved Zedd toward the door. Thescreaming, crying, begging crowd of people closed in around Zedd and Adie,clawing and pawing at them in wild desperation.In the distance, Zedd could hear the horrifying screams of their terrifiedchildren."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39They aren’t far,” Richard said as he stepped back in among the trees. He stoodsilently watching as Kahlan straightened the shoulders of her dress.The dress showed no ill effects from its long confinement in their packs. Thealmost white, satiny smooth fabric glistened in the eerie light of the churningovercast. The flowing lines of the dress, cut square at the neck, bore no laceor frills, nothing to distract from its simple elegance. The sight of Kahlan inthat dress still took his breath away.She looked out through the trees when they heard Cara’s whistle. The warningsignal Richard had taught Cara was the plaintive, high, clear whistle of acommon wood pewee, although Cara didn’t know that’s what it was. When he’d firsttold Cara that he wanted to teach her a pewee birdcall as a warning signal, shesaid she wasn’t going to learn the call of any bird named a pewee. Richard gavein and told her that he would instead teach her the call of the small, fierce,short-tailed pine hawk, but only if she would be willing to work hard at gettingit right, since it was more difficult. Satisfied to have her way, Cara hadagreed and readily learned the simple whistle. She was good at it and used itoften as a signal. Richard never told her that there was no such thing as ashort-tailed pine hawk, or that hawks didn’t make whistles like that.Out through the screen of branches, the dark form of the statue stood guard overan area of the pass that for thousands of years had been deserted. Richardwondered again why the people back then would have put such a statue in a passno one was likely to ever again visit. He thought about the ancient society thathad placed it, and at what they must have thought, sealing people away for thecrime of not having a spark of the gift.Richard brushed pine needles off the back of the sleeve of Kahlan’s dress.“Here, hold still; let me look at you.”Kahlan turned back, arms at her sides, as he smoothed the fabric at her upperarms. Her unafraid green eyes, beneath eyebrows that had the graceful arch of araptor’s wings in flight, met his gaze. Her features seemed to have only grownmore exquisite since he had first met her. Her look, her pose, the way she gazedat him as if she could see into his soul, struck a chord in him. Clearly evidentin her eyes was the intelligence that had from the first so captivated him.“Why are you looking at me like that?”Despite everything, he couldn’t hold back his smile. “Standing there like that,in that dress, your long hair so beautiful, the green of the trees behind you...it just suddenly reminded me of the first time I saw you.”Her special smile, the smile she gave no one but him, spread radiantly throughher bewitching eyes. She put her wrists on his shoulders and locked her fingersbehind his neck, pulling him into a kiss.As it always did, her kiss so completely consumed him with his need of her thathe momentarily lost track of the world. She melted into his embrace. For thatmoment there was no Imperial Order, no Bandakar, no D’Haran Empire, no Sword ofTruth, no chimes, no gift turning its power against him, no poison, no warningbeacons, no black-tipped races, no Jagang, no Nicholas, no Sisters of the Dark.Her kiss made him forget everything but her. In that moment there was nothingbut the two of them. Kahlan made his life complete; her kiss reaffirmed thatbond.She pulled back, gazing up into his eyes again. “Seems like you’ve had nothingbut trouble ever since that day you found me.”Richard smiled. “My life is what I’ve had since that day I found you. When Ifound you, I found my life.”Holding her face in both hands, he kissed her again.Betty nudged his leg and bleated.“You two about ready?” Jennsen called down the hill. “They’ll be here, soon.Didn’t you hear Cara’s whistle?”“We heard,” Kahlan called up to Jennsen. “We’ll be right there.”Turning back, she smiled as she looked him up and down. “Well, Lord Rahl, youcertainly don’t look the way you did the first time I saw you.” She straightenedthe tooled leather baldric lying over the black tunic banded in gold. “But youlook exactly the same, too. Your eyes are the same as I saw that day.” Shecocked her head as she smiled up at him. “I don’t see the headache of the giftin your eyes.”“It’s been gone for a while, but after that kiss, it would be impossible to havea headache.”“Well, if it comes back,” she said with intimate promise, “just tell me and I’llsee what I can do to make it go away.”Richard ran his fingers through her hair and gazed one last time into her eyesbefore slipping his arm around her waist. Together they walked through thecathedral of trees that was their cover off to the side near the crown of theridge, and out toward the open slope. Between the trunks of the pines, he couldsee Jennsen running down the hill, leaping from rock to rock, avoiding thepatches of snow. She rushed in to meet them just within the small cluster oftrees.“I spotted them,” she said, breathlessly. “I could see them down in the gorge onthe far side. They’ll be up here soon.” A grin brightened her face. “I saw Tomleading them.”Jennsen took in the sight of both of them, then—Kahlan in the white dress of theMother Confessor and Richard in the outfit he had in part found in the Keep thathad once been worn by war wizards. By the surprise on Jennsen’s face, he thoughtshe might curtsy.“Wow,” she said. “That sure is some dress.” She looked Richard up and downagain. “You two look like you should rule the world.”“Well,” Richard said, “let’s hope Owen’s people think so.”Cara pushed a spruce bough aside as she ducked in under the limbs of trees.Dressed again in her skintight red leather outfit, she looked as intimidating asshe had the first time Richard had seen her in the grand halls of the People’sPalace in D’Hara.“Lord Rahl once confided in me that he intended to rule the world,” Cara said,having heard Jennsen’s pronouncement.“Really?” Jennsen asked.Richard sighed at her awe. “Ruling the world has proven more difficult than Ithought it would be.”“If you would listen more to the Mother Confessor and to me,” Cara advised, “youwould have an easier time of it.”Richard ignored Cara’s cockiness. “Would you get everything together? I want tobe up there with Kahlan before Tom arrives with Owen and his men.”Cara nodded and started collecting the things they’d been working so hard tomake, stacking some and taking a count of others. Richard laid a hand onJennsen’s shoulder.“Tie Betty up so that she’ll stay here for now. All right? We don’t need her inthe way.”“I’ll see to it,” Jennsen said as she fussed with ringlets of her red hair.“I’ll make sure she won’t be able to bother us or wander off.”It was plainly evident how eager she was to see Tom again. “You look beautiful,”Richard assured her. Her grin returned to overpower the anxious expression.Betty’s tail was a blur as she peered up at them, eager to go wherever the restof them were going. “Come on,” Jennsen said to her friend, “you’re staying herefor a while.”Jennsen snatched Betty’s rope, holding her back, as Richard, with Kahlan closeat his side, made his way out past the last of the trees and onto the openledge. Somber clouds hung low against the face of surrounding mountains. Withthe towering snowcapped peaks hidden by the low, ominous clouds, Richard thoughtit felt like they were near the roof of the world.The wind down at the ground had died, leaving the trees motionless and, bycontrast, making the boiling movement of the cloud masses seem almost alive. Theflurries of the day before had ended and then the sun had made a briefappearance to shrink the patches of snow on the pass. He didn’t think there wasmuch chance of seeing the sun this day.The towering stone sentinel waited at the top of the trail, watching foreverover the pass and out toward the Pillars of Creation. As they approached it,Richard scanned the surrounding sky but saw only some small birds—flycatchersand white-breasted nuthatches—flitting among the nearby stand of spruce trees.He was relieved that the races had remained absent ever since they had takenthis ancient trail up through the pass.The first night up in the pass, farther back down the slope in the heavierforests, they had worked hard to build a snug shelter, just managing to get itdone as darkness had settled into the vast woods. Early the next day, Richardhad cleared snow off the statue and all around the ledges of the base.He had discovered more writing.He now knew more about this man whose statue had been placed there in the pass.Another small flurry had since dusted snow over the writing, burying again thelong-dead words.Kahlan placed a comforting hand on his back. “They will listen, Richard. Theywill listen to you.”With every breath, pain pulled at him from deep inside. It was getting worse.“They’d better, or I’ll have no chance to get the antidote to this poison.”He knew he couldn’t do it alone. Even if he knew how to call upon his gift andcommand its magic, he still would not be able to wave a hand or perform somegrand feat of conjuring that would cast the Imperial Order out of the BandakaranEmpire. He knew that such things were beyond the scope of even the most powerfulmagic. Magic, properly used, properly conceived, was a tool, much like hissword, employed to accomplish a goal.Magic was not what would save him. Magic was not a panacea. If he was tosucceed, he had to use his head to come up with a way to prevail.He no longer knew if he could even depend on the magic of the Sword of Truth.Nor did he know how long he had before his own gift might kill him. At times, itfelt as if his gift and the poison were in a race to see which could do him infirst.Richard led Kahlan the rest of the way up and around to the back of the statue,to a small prominence of rock at the very top of the pass where he wanted towait for the men. From that spot they could see through the gaps in themountains and back into Bandakar. Out at the edge of the level area, Richardspotted Tom down below leading the men through the trees and up the switchbacktrail.Tom peered up as he ascended the trail and spotted Richard and Kahlan. He sawhow they were dressed, where they stood, and gave no familiar wave, realizingthat doing so would be inappropriate. Through breaks in the trees, Richard couldsee men following Tom’s gaze up above them.Richard lifted his sword a few inches, checking that it was clear in itsscabbard. Overhead, the dark, towering clouds all around seemed to havegathered, as if they were all crowding into the confines of the pass to watch.Standing tall as he gazed off to the unknown land beyond, to an unknown empire,Richard took Kahlan’s hand.Hand in hand, they silently awaited what would be the beginning of a challengethat would change forever the nature of the world, or would be the end of hischance at life."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40As the men following Tom emerged from the trees below and into the open, Richardwas dismayed to see that their numbers were far less than Owen said had beenhiding with him in the hills. Rubbing the furrows on his brow with hisfingertips, Richard stepped back up to the short plateau where Kahlan waited.Her own brow drew down with concern. “What’s wrong?”“I doubt they brought fifty men.”Kahlan took up his hand again, her voice coming in gentle assurance. “That’sfifty more than we had.”Cara came up behind them, dropping her load off to the side. She took up stationbehind Richard to his left, on the opposite side from Kahlan. Richard met hergrim gaze. He wondered how the woman always managed to look as if she fullyexpected everything to happen just as she wished it to happen, and that was theend of it.Tom stepped up over the edge of the rock, the men following. He was sweatingfrom the exertion of the climb, but a tight smile warmed his face when he sawJennsen just coming up the other side of the rise. She returned the brief smileand then stood in the shadows beside the base of the statue, back out of theway.When the unkempt band of men caught sight of Richard in his black pants andboots, black tunic trimmed in a band of gold around the edge, the broad leatherbelt, the leather-padded silver wristbands with ancient symbols circling them,and the gleaming silver-and-gold-wrought scabbard, they seemed to lose theircourage. When they saw Kahlan standing beside him, they cowered back toward theedge, bowing hesitantly, not knowing what they were supposed to do.“Come on, then,” Tom told them, prompting them all to come up onto the expanseof flat rock in front of Richard and Kahlan.Owen whispered to the men as he moved among them, urging them to come forward asTom was gesturing. They complied timidly, shuffling in a little closer, butstill leaving a wide safety margin between themselves and Richard.As the men all gazed about, unsure as to what they were supposed to do next,Cara stepped forward and held an arm out toward Richard.“I present Lord Rahl,” she said in a clear tone that rang out over the mengathered at the top of the pass, “the Seeker of Truth and wielder of the Swordof Truth, the bringer of death, the Master of the D’Haran Empire, and husband tothe Mother Confessor herself.”If the men had looked timid and unsure before, Cara’s introduction made them allthe more so. When they looked from Richard and Kahlan back to Cara’s penetratingblue eyes, seeing her waiting, they all went to a knee in a bow before Richard.When Cara stepped deliberately to the fore, in front of the men, turned, andwent to her knees, Tom got the message and did the same. Both bent forward andtouched their foreheads to the ground.In the silent, late-morning air, the men waited, still unsure what it was theywere to do.“Master Rahl, guide us,” Cara said in a clear voice so the men could all hearher. She waited.Tom looked back over his shoulder at all the blond-headed men watching. When Tomfrowned with displeasure, the men understood that they were expected to followthe lead. They all finally went to both knees and bowed forward, imitating Tomand Cara, until their foreheads touched the cold granite.“Master Rahl, guide us,” Cara began again, never lifting her forehead from theground.This time, led by Tom, the men all repeated the words after her.“Master Rahl, guide us,” they said with a decided lack of unity.“Master Rahl, teach us,” Cara said when they all had finished the beginning ofthe oath. They followed her lead again, but still hesitantly and without muchcoordination.“Master Rahl, protect us,” Cara said.The men repeated the words, their voices coming a little more in union.“In your light we thrive.”The men mumbled the words after her.“In your mercy we are sheltered.”They repeated the line.“In your wisdom we are humbled.”Again they spoke the words after her.“We live only to serve.”When they finished repeating the words, she spoke the last line in a clearvoice: “Our lives are yours.”Cara rose up on her knees when they finished and glared back at the men allstill bowed forward but peeking up at her. “Those are the words of the devotionto the Lord Rahl. You will now speak it together with me three times, as isproper in the field.”Cara again put her forehead to the ground at Richard’s feet.“Master Rahl, guide us. Master Rahl, teach us. Master Rahl, protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Richard and Kahlan stood above the people as they spoke the second and thirddevotion. This was no empty show put on by Cara for the benefit of the men; thiswas the devotion as it had been spoken for thousands of years and Cara meantevery word of it.“You may rise now,” she told the men.The men cautiously returned to their feet, hunched in worry, waiting silently.Richard met all their eyes before he began.“I am Richard Rahl. I am the man you men decided to poison so as to enslave meand thus force me to do your bidding.“What you have done is a crime. While you may believe that you can justify youraction as proper, or think of it as merely a means of persuasion, nothing cangive you the right to threaten or take the life of another who has done you noharm nor intended none. That, along with torture, rape, and murder, is the meansby which the Imperial Order rules.”“But we meant you no harm,” one of the men called out in horror that Richardwould accuse them of such a ghastly crime. Other men spoke up in agreement thatRichard had it all wrong.“You think I am a savage,” Richard said in a tone of voice that silenced themand put them back a step. “You think yourselves better than me and so thatsomehow makes it all right to do this to me—and to try to do it to the MotherConfessor—because you want something and, like petulant children, you expect usto give it to you.“The alternative you give me is death. The task you demand of me is difficultbeyond your imagination, making my death from your poison a very realpossibility, and likely. That is the reality of it.“I already came close to dying from your poison. At the last possible instant Iwas granted a temporary stay of my execution when one of you gave me aprovisional antidote. My friends and loved ones believed I would die that night.You were the cause of it. You men consciously decided to poison me, therebyaccepting the fact that you might be killing me.”“No,” a man insisted, his hands clasped in supplication, “we never intended toharm you.”“If there was not a credible threat to my life, then why would I do as you wish?If you truly mean me no harm and are not committed to killing me if I don’t goalong with you, then prove it and give me the antidote so that I can have mylife back. It’s my life, not yours.”This time no one spoke up.“No? So you see, then, it is as I say. You men are committed to either murder orenslavement. The only choice I have in it is which of those two it will be. Iwill hear no more of your feelings about what you intended. Your feelings do notabsolve you of your very real deeds. Your actions, not your feelings, speak thetruth of your intent.”Richard clasped his hands behind his back as he paced slowly before the men.“Now, I could do as you people are fond of doing, and tell myself that I can’tknow if any of it is true. I could do as you would do, declare myself inadequateto the task of knowing what’s real and refuse to face reality.“But I am the Seeker of Truth because I do not try to hide from reality. Thechoice to live demands that the truth be faced. I intend to do that. I intend tolive.“You men must today decide what you will do, what will be the future of yourlives and the lives of the ones you love. You are going to have to deal withreality, the same as I must, if you are to have a chance at life. Today you willhave to face a great deal of the truth, if you are to have that which you seek.”Richard gestured to Owen. “I thought you said there were more men than this.Where are the rest?”Owen took a step forward. “Lord Rahl, to prevent violence, they turnedthemselves over to the men of the Order.”Richard stared at the man. “Owen, after all you’ve told me, after all those menhave seen from the Order, how could they possibly believe such a thing?”“But how are we to know that this time it will not stop the violence? We can’tknow the nature of reality or—”“I told you before, with me you will confine yourself to what is, and not repeatmeaningless phrases you have memorized. If you have real facts I want to hearthem. I’m not interested in meaningless nonsense.”Owen pulled his small pack off his back. He fished around inside and came upwith a small canvas pouch. Tears welled up in his eyes as he gazed at it.“The men of the Order found out that there were men hiding out in the hills. Oneof those men hiding with us has three daughters. In order to prevent a cycle ofviolence, someone in our town told the men of the Order which girls were hisdaughters.“Every day the men of the Order tied a rope to a finger of each one of thesethree girls. One man held the girl while another pulled on the rope until herfinger tore off. The men of the Order told a man from our town to go to thehills and give the three fingers to our men. Every day he came.”Owen handed the bag to Richard. “These are the fingers from each of hisdaughters.”“The man who brought them to our men was in a daze. They said he no longerseemed human. He talked in a dead voice. He repeated what he had been bidden tosay. He had decided that since nothing was real, he would see nothing and do ashe was told.“He said that the men of the Order told him that some of the people from ourtown had given the names of the men in the hills and that they had the childrenof those other men, as well. They said that unless the men returned and gavethemselves up, they would do the same to the other children.“A little more than half the men hiding in the hills could not stand to think ofthemselves being the cause of such violence, and so they went back to our townand gave themselves over to the men of the Order.”“Why are you giving me this?” Richard asked.“Because,” Owen said, his voice filled with tears, “I wanted you to know why ourmen had no choice but to turn themselves in. They could not stand to think oftheir loved ones suffering such terrible agony because of them.”Richard looked out at the mournful men watching him. He felt his anger boilingup inside, but he kept it in check as he spoke.“I can understand what those men were trying to do by giving themselves up. Ican’t fault them for it. It won’t help, but I couldn’t fault them fordesperately wanting to spare their loved ones from harm.”Despite his rage, Richard spoke in a soft voice. “I’m sorry that you and yourpeople are suffering such brutality at the hands of the Imperial Order. Butunderstand this: it is real, and the Order is the cause of it. Those men ofyours, if they did as the Order commanded or if they failed to, were not thecause of violence. The responsibility for causing violence is entirely theOrder’s. You did not go out and attack them. They came to you, they attackedyou, they enslave and torture and murder you.”Most of the men stood in slumped poses, staring at the ground.“Do any of the rest of you have children?”A number of the men nodded or mumbled that they did.Richard ran his hand back through his hair. “Why haven’t the rest of you turnedyourselves in, then? Why are you here and not trying to stop the suffering inthe same way the others did?”The men looked at one another, some seeming confused by the question whileothers appearing unable to put their reasons into words. Their sorrow, theirdistress, even their hesitant resolve, were evident on their faces, but theycould not come up with words to explain why they would not turn themselves in.Richard held up the small canvas bag with the gruesome treasure, not allowingthem to avoid the issue. “You all knew about this. Why did you not return aswell?”Finally one man spoke up. “I sneaked to the fields at sunset and talked to a manworking the crops, and asked what happened to those men who had returned. Hesaid that many of their children had already been taken away. Others had died.All the men who had come in from the hills had been taken away. None wereallowed to return to their homes, to their families. What good would it do forus to go back?”“What good, indeed,” Richard murmured. This was the first sign that they graspedthe true nature of the situation.“You have to stop the Order,” Owen said. “You must give us our freedom. Why haveyou made us make this journey?”Richard’s initial spark of confidence dimmed. While they might have in partgrasped the truth of their troubles, they certainly weren’t facing the nature ofany real solution. They simply wanted to be saved. They still expected someoneto do it for them: Richard.The men all looked relieved that Owen had at last asked the question; they wereapparently too timid to ask it themselves. As they waited, some of the mencouldn’t help stealing glances at Jennsen, standing to the rear. Most of the menalso appeared troubled by the statue looming behind Richard. They could only seethe back of it and didn’t really know what it was meant to be.“Because,” Richard finally told them, “in order for me to do as you want, it’simportant that you all come to understand everything involved. You expect me tosimply do this for you. I can’t. You are going to have to help me in this or youand all of your loved ones are lost. If we are to succeed, then you men musthelp the rest of your people come to understand the things I have to tell you.“You have gone this far, you have suffered this much, you have made this much ofa commitment. You realize that if you do the same as your friends have beentrying to do, if you apply those same useless solutions, you, too, will beenslaved or murdered. You are running out of options. You all have made adecision to at least try to succeed, to try to rid yourselves of the bruteskilling and enslaving your people.“You men here are their last chance ... their only chance.“You must now hear the rest of what I have to tell you and then make up yourminds as to what will be your future.”The haggard, ragtag men, all dressed in worn and dirty clothes, all looking likethey’d had a very difficult time of living in the hills, either spoke up ornodded that they would hear him out. Some even looked as if they might berelieved by how directly and honestly he spoke to them. A few even looked hungryfor what he might say."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41Three years ago from the coming autumn,” Richard began, “I lived in a placecalled Hartland. I was a woods guide. I had a peaceful life in a place I lovedamong those I loved. I knew very little about the places beyond my home. In someways I was like you people before the Order came, so I can understand some ofwhat you felt about how things changed.“Like you, I lived beyond a boundary that protected us from those who would dous harm.”The men broke out in excited whispering, apparently surprised and pleased thatthey could relate to him in this way, that they had something so basic in commonwith him.“What happened, then?” one of the men asked.Richard couldn’t help himself; he couldn’t hold back the smile that overwhelmedhim.“One day, in my woods”—he held his hand out to the side—”Kahlan showed up. Likeyou, her people were in desperate trouble. She needed help. Rather than poisonme, though, she told me her story and how trouble was coming our way. Much likeyou, the boundary protecting her people had failed and a tyrant had invaded herhomeland. She also came bearing a warning that this man would soon come to myhomeland, too, and conquer my people, my friends, my loved ones.”All the faces turned toward Kahlan. The men stared openly, as if seeing her forthe first time. It looked to be astonishing to them that this statuesque womanbefore them could be a savage, as they thought of outsiders, and have the samekind of trouble they’d had. Richard was leaving out vast chunks of the story,but he wanted to keep it simple enough to be clear to these men.“I was named the Seeker of Truth and given this sword to help me in thisimportant struggle.” Richard lifted the hilt clear of the scabbard by half thelength of the blade, letting the men all see the polished steel. Many grimacedat seeing such a weapon.“Together, side by side, Kahlan and I struggled to stop the man who sought toenslave or destroy us all. In a strange land, she was my guide, not only helpingme to fight against those who would kill us, but helping me to come tounderstand the wider world I had never before considered. She opened my eyes towhat was out there, beyond the boundary that had protected me and my people. Shehelped me to see the approaching shadow of tyranny and know the true stakesinvolved—life itself.“She made me live up to the challenge. Had she not, I would not be alive today,and a great many more people would be dead or enslaved.”Richard had to turn away, then, at the flood of painful memories, at the thoughtof all those lost in the struggle. At the victories so hard won.He put his hand to the statue for support as he remembered the gruesome murderof George Cypher, the man who had raised him, the man who, until that struggle,Richard had always believed was his father. The pain of it, so distant and faraway, came rushing back again. He remembered the horror of that time, ofsuddenly realizing that he would never again see the man he dearly loved. He hadforgotten until that moment how much he missed him.Richard gathered his composure and turned back to the men. “In the end, and onlywith Kahlan’s help, I won the struggle against that tyrant I had never knownexisted until the day she had come into my woods and warned me.“That man was Darken Rahl, my father, a man I had never known.”The men stared in disbelief. “You never knew?” one asked in an astonished voice.Richard shook his head. “It’s a very long story. Maybe another time I will tellyou men all of it. For now, I must tell you the important parts that arerelevant to you and those you love back there in your homes.”Richard looked at the ground before him, thinking, as he paced in front of thedisorderly knot of men.“When I killed Darken Rahl, I did it to keep him from killing me and my lovedones. He had tortured and murdered countless people and that alone earned himdeath, but I had to kill him or he would have killed me. I didn’t know at thetime that he was my real father or that in killing him, since I was his heir, Iwould become the new Lord Rahl.“Had he known who I was, he might not have been trying to kill me, but he didn’tknow. I had information he wanted; he intended to torture it out of me and thenkill me. I killed him first.“Since that time, I have come to learn a great deal. What I learned connectsus”—Richard gestured to the men and then placed the hand on his own chest as hemet their gazes—”in ways you must come to understand, as well, if you are tosucceed in this new struggle.“The land where I grew up, Kahlan’s land, and the land of D’Hara, all make upthe New World. As you have learned, this vast land down here outside where yougrew up is called the Old World. After I became Lord Rahl, the barrierprotecting us from the Old World failed, much as your own boundary failed. Whenit did, Emperor Jagang of the Imperial Order, down here in the Old World, usedthe opportunity to invade the New World, my home, much as he invaded your home.We’ve been fighting him and his troops for over two years, trying to defeat themor at least to drive them back to the Old World.“The barrier that failed had protected us from the Order, or men like them, foraround three thousand years, longer, even, than you were protected. Before thatbarrier was placed at the end of a great war, the enemy at the time, from theOld World, had used magic to create people called dream walkers.”The men fell to whispering. They had heard the name, but they didn’t reallyunderstand it and speculated on what it could mean.“Dream walkers,” Richard explained, when they had quieted, “could enter aperson’s mind in order to control them. There was no defense. Once a dreamwalker took over your mind, you became his slave, unable to resist his commands.The people back then were desperate.“A man named Alric Rahl, my ancestor, came up with a way to protect people’sminds from being taken over by the dream walkers. He was not only the Lord Rahlwho ruled D’Hara at the time, but he was also a great wizard. Through hisability he created a bond that when spoken earnestly or given in a more simpleform with heartfelt sincerity, protected people from dream walkers enteringtheir minds. Alric Rahl’s link of magic to his people, through this bond,protected them.“The devotion you men all gave is the formal declaration of that bond. It hasbeen given by the D’Haran people to their Lord Rahl for three thousand years.”Some of the men in front stepped forward, their faces etched with anxiety. “Arewe protected, then, from the dream walkers, Lord Rahl, because we gave thisoath? Are we protected from the dream walkers entering our minds and taking us?”Richard shook his head. “You and your people need no protection. You are alreadyprotected in another way.”Relief swept through the crowd of men. Some gripped the shoulder of another, orplaced a hand in relief on a friend’s back. They looked as if they feared thatdream walkers were stalking them, and they had just been spared at the lastinstant.“But how is it that we can be protected?” Owen asked.Richard took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “Well, that’s the part thatin a way connects us. You see, as I understand it, magic needs balance in orderto function.”There were knowing nods all around, as if these pristinely ungifted men all hadan intimate understanding of magic.“When Alric Rahl used magic to create this bond in order to protect his people,”Richard went on, “there needed to always be a Lord Rahl to complete the bond, tomaintain its power. Not all wizards bear children who also possess this giftedability, so part of what Alric Rahl did when he created this bond was to make itso that the Lord Rahl would always bear one son who had magic, who had the gift,and could complete this bond with the people of D’Hara. In this way they wouldalways be protected.”Richard held up a finger to make his point as he swept his gaze over the crowdof men. “What they didn’t know at the time was that this magic inadvertentlycreated its own balance. While the Lord Rahl always produced a gifted heir—awizard like him—it was only discovered later that he also occasionally producedoffspring who were entirely without any magic.”Richard could see by the blank looks that the men didn’t grasp what he wastelling them. He imagined that for people living such isolated lives, his storymust seem rather confusing, if not far-fetched. He remembered his own confusionabout magic before the boundary had come down and he’d met Kahlan. He hadn’tbeen raised around magic and he still didn’t understand most of it himself. He’dbeen born with both sides of the gift, and yet he didn’t know how to control it.“You see,” he said, “only some people have magic—are gifted, as it’s called. Butall people are born with at least a very tiny spark of the gift, even thoughthey can’t manipulate magic. Until just recently, everyone thought of thesepeople as ungifted. You see? The gifted, like wizards and sorceresses, canmanipulate magic, and the rest of the people can’t, so they were believed to beungifted.“But it turns out that this isn’t accurate, since there is an infinitesimalspark of the gift in everyone born. This tiny spark of the gift is actually whatallows people to interact with the magic in the world around them, that is, withthings and creatures that have magical properties, and with people who aregifted in a more comprehensive sense—those who do have the ability to manipulatemagic.”“Some people in Bandakar have magic, too,” a man said. “True magic. Only thosewho have never seen—”“No,” Richard said, cutting him off. He didn’t want them losing track of hisaccount. “Owen told me about what you people believe is magic. That’s not magic,that’s mysticism. That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about realmagic that produces real results in the real world. Forget what you’ve beentaught about magic, about how faith supposedly creates what you believe in andthat is real magic. It’s not real. It’s just the fanciful illusion of magic inpeople’s imaginations.”“But it is real,” someone said in a respectful but firm voice. “More real thanwhat you see and feel.”Richard turned a harsh look on the men. “If it’s so real, then why did you haveto use a known poison on me that was mixed by a man who had worked his wholelife with herbs? Because you know what’s real, that’s why; when it was vital toyour self-interest, to your lives, you resorted to dealing in reality, to whatyou know really works.”Richard pointed back at Kahlan. “The Mother Confessor has real magic. It’s nofanciful curse put on someone and when they die ten years later people believethe curse was the cause. She has real magic that is in elemental ways linked todeath, so it affects even you. She can touch someone, with this real magic, andin an instant they will be dead. Not ten years from now—right now, on the spot.”Richard stood resolutely in front of the men, gazing from eye to eye. “Ifsomeone doesn’t believe that is real magic, then let’s have a test. Let themperform their faith-based magic and put a spell on me—to kill me right here andnow. After they’ve done that, then they will come forward and be touched by theMother Confessor’s very real, lethal power. Then everyone else will be able tosee the results and judge for themselves.” He looked from face to face. “Anyonewilling to take up the test? Any magicians among all you ungifted people willingto try it?”When the men remained silent, no one moving, Richard went on.“So, it would seem that you men do have some understanding of what’s real andwhat isn’t. Keep that in mind. Learn from it.“Now, I told you how the Lord Rahl always bore a son with magic so he could passon the rule of D’Hara and his gifted ability in order to make the bond work.But, as I said, the bond that Alric Rahl created may have had an unintendedconsequence.“Only later was it discovered that the Lord Rahl, possibly as a means ofbalance, also sometimes produced offspring that were entirely without anymagic—not just ungifted in the way most people are, but unlike any people everborn before: they were pristinely ungifted. These pristinely ungifted people hadabsolutely no spark of the gift whatsoever.“Because of that, because they were pristinely ungifted, they were unable tointeract with the real magic in the world. They were unable to be touched bymagic at all. For them, magic might as well not exist because they were not bornwith the ability to see it or to interact with it. You might say they were likea bird that could not fly. They looked like a bird, they had feathers, they atebugs, but they couldn’t fly.“Back then in that time, three thousand years ago, after the bond had beencreated to protect people from dream walkers in the war, the wizards finallysucceeded in placing a barrier between the Old and the New World. Because thosein the Old World could no longer come to the New World to wage war, the greatwar ended. Peace finally came.“The people of the New World discovered, though, that they had a problem. Thesepristinely ungifted offspring of the Lord Rahl passed this trait on to theirchildren. Every offspring of a marriage with at least one of these pristinelyungifted partners bears pristinely ungifted children—always, every time. Asthese offspring married and had children and then grandchildren and thengreat-grandchildren, as there were more and more of them, that pristinelyungifted trait began spreading throughout the population.“People, at the time, were frightened because they depended on magic. Magic waspart of their world. Magic was what had saved them from the dream walkers. Magichad created the barrier that protected them from the horde from the Old World.Magic had ended the war. Magic healed people, found lost children, producedbeautiful creations of art that inspired and brought joy. Magic could help guidepeople in the course of future events.“Some towns grew up around a gifted person who could serve people’s needs. Manygifted people earned a living performing such services. In some things, magicgave people control over nature and thus made the lives of everyone better.Things accomplished with the aid of magic improved the living conditions ofnearly everyone. Magic was a force of individual creation and thus individualaccomplishment. Nearly everyone derived some benefit from it.“This is not to say that magic was or is indispensable, but that it was a usefulaid, a tool. Magic was like their right arm. Yet it’s the mind of man, not hismagic, that is indispensable—much like you could survive without your right arm,but you couldn’t survive without your mind. But magic had become intertwined inthe lives of everyone, so many believed that it was absolutely indispensable.“The people came to feel that this new threat—the pristinely ungifted traitspreading through the population—would be the end of everything they knew,everything that they thought was important, that it would be the end of theirmost vital protection—magic.”Richard gazed out at all the faces, waiting to make sure that the men hadgrasped the essence of the story, that they understood how desperate the peoplemust have been, and why.“So, what did the people do about these new pristinely ungifted people amongthem?” a man in the back asked.In a quiet tone, Richard said, “Something terrible.”He pulled the book from a leather pouch on his belt and held it up for all themen to see as he again paced before them. The clouds, laden with storms of snow,rolled silently through the frigid valley pass, bound for the peaks above them.“This book is called The Pillars of Creation. That’s what the wizards back thencalled these pristinely ungifted people—pillars of Creation—because they had thepower, with this trait that they passed along to their offspring, to alter thevery nature of mankind. They were the foundation of an entirely new kind ofpeople—people without any connection to magic.“I only just a short time ago came across this book. It’s meant for the LordRahl, and others, so that they will know about these pristinely ungifted peoplewho are unaffected by magic. The book tells the history of how these people cameabout—through those born to the Lord Rahl—along with the history of what wasdiscovered about them. It also reveals what the people back then, thousands ofyears ago, did about these pillars of Creation.”Men rubbed their arms in the cold air as Richard slowly paced before them. Theyall looked caught up in the story.“So,” Owen asked, “what did they do?”Richard came to a stop and stood watching their eyes before he spoke.“They banished them.”Astonished whispering broke out among the men. They were stunned to hear thefinal solution. These people understood banishment, they understood it all toowell, and they could sympathize with these banished people of so long ago.“That’s terrible,” a man in front said, shaking his head.Another frowned and held up a hand. “Weren’t these pillars of Creation relatedto some of the other people? Weren’t they part of the towns? Didn’t the peoplefeel sorrow at banishing these ungifted people?”Richard nodded. “Yes. They were friends and family. Those banished people wereintimately intertwined in the lives of nearly everyone. The book tells how heavyhearted the people felt at the decision that had been reached about thesepristinely ungifted people. It must have been an awful time, a dreadful choicethat no one liked, but those in charge at the time decided that in order forthem to preserve their way of life, to preserve magic and all it meant to them,to preserve that attribute of man, rather than value the lives of individualsfor who they were, they had to banish these pristinely ungifted people.“What’s more, they also decreed that all future offspring of the Lord Rahl,except his gifted heir, should be put to death to insure that no pillar ofCreation ever again came among them.”This time there was no whispering. The men looked saddened by the story of thesemysterious people and the terrible solution of how to deal with them. Heads hungas the men thought about what it must have been like back in such a grim time.Finally, a man’s head came up. His brow twitched. He finally asked the questionRichard expected to be asked, the question he had been waiting for.“But where were these pillars of Creation banished to? Where were they sent?”Richard watched the men as other eyes turned up, curious about the historicmystery, waiting for him to go on.“These people were not affected by magic,” Richard reminded them. “And thebarrier holding back the Old World was a barrier created of magic.”“They sent them through the barrier!” a man guessed aloud.Richard nodded. “Many wizards had died and given their power into that barrierso that their people would be protected from those in the Old World who wantedto rule them and to end magic. That was a large part of what the war had beenfought over—those in the Old World had wanted to eradicate magic from mankind.“So, those people in the New World sent these pristinely ungifted people, thesepeople without any magic, through the barrier to the Old World.“They never knew what became of them, those friends and family and loved onesthey had banished, because they had been sent beyond a barrier that none of themcould cross. It was thought that they would establish new lives, would make anew beginning. But, because the barrier was there, and it was enemy territorybeyond, the people of the New World never knew what became of those banishedpeople.“Finally, a few years ago, that barrier came down. If these banished people hadmade a life for themselves in the Old World, they would have had children andspread their pristinely ungifted attribute”—Richard lifted his arms in ashrug—”but there is no trace of them. The people down here are just the same asthe people up in the New World—some born gifted but all born with at least thattiny spark of the gift that enables them to interact with magic.“Those people from ancient times seemed just to have vanished.”“So now we know,” Owen reasoned as he stared off in thought, “that all thosepeople sent to the Old World so long ago tragically died out... or maybe werekilled.”“I had thought as much myself,” Richard said. He turned and faced the men,waiting until all eyes were on him before going on.“But then I found them. I found those long-lost people.”Excited whispering broke out again. The men appeared inspired by the prospect ofsuch people surviving against all odds.“Where are they, then, Lord Rahl,” a man asked, “these people with whom youshare ancestry? These people who had to endure such cruel banishment andhardship?”Richard leveled a cutting gaze at the men. “Come with me, and I will tell youwhat became of these people.”Richard led them around the statue, to the front, where, for the first time,they could see the full view of the sentinel in stone. The men were awestruck atfinally seeing the statue from the front. They talked excitedly among themselvesabout how real it looked, about how they could clearly see the stalwart featuresof the man’s face.By the utter shock in their voices and by what the men were saying, Richard gotthe distinct impression that they’d never seen a statue before, at least nostatue as monumental as this one. It appeared that for these men the statue mustbe something akin to a manifestation of magic, rather than, as Richard knew itto be, a manifestation of man’s ability.Richard placed a hand on the cold stone of the base. “This is an ancient statueof an Old World wizard named Kaja-Rang. It was carved, in part, as a tribute tothe man because he was a great and powerful wizard.”Owen lifted a hand to interrupt. “But I thought the people in the Old Worldwanted to be without magic? Why would they have a great wizard—and why,especially, would they pay a tribute to such a man of magic?”Richard smiled at Owen catching the contradiction. “People don’t always act in aconsistent manner. What’s more, the more irrational are your beliefs, the moreglaring the inconsistencies. You men, for example, try to gloss overincongruities in your behavior by applying your convictions selectively. Youclaim that nothing is real, or that we cannot know the true nature of reality,and yet you fear what the Order does to you—you believe firmly enough in thereality of what they’re doing that you want it to stop.“If nothing were real, then you would have no reason to want to stop theImperial Order. In fact, it’s counter to your professed beliefs to try to stopthem, or to even feel that their presence is real, much less detrimental, sinceyou assert that man is inadequate at the task of knowing reality.“Yet you grasp the reality of what’s happening at the hands of the men of theOrder, and know very well that it’s abhorrent, so you selectively suspend theprecepts of your beliefs in order to send Owen to poison me in an attempt to getme to rid you of your very real problem.”Some of the men looked confused by what Richard said while others looked to beembarrassed. A few looked astonished. None looked willing to challenge him, sothey let him go on without interrupting.“The people in the Old World were the same way—they still are. They claimed theydidn’t want magic, and yet when faced with that reality, they didn’t want to dowithout it. The Imperial Order is like this. They’ve come to the New Worldclaiming to be a champion of freeing mankind of magic, proclaiming themselves tobe noble for holding such a goal, and yet they use magic in the pursuit of thisprofessed goal. They contend that magic is evil, and yet they embrace it.“Their leader, Emperor Jagang, uses those with magic to help accomplish hisends, among which, he claims, is the eradication of magic. Jagang is a dreamwalker descended from those dream walkers of so long ago. His ability as a dreamwalker is magic, yet he does not disqualify himself from leading his empire.Even though he has magic, which he claims makes people unfit to have any say inthe future, he calls himself Jagang the Just.“Despite what they declare they believe, their goal is to rule people, plain andsimple. They seek power but dress it up in noble-sounding robes. Every tyrantthinks he is different. They are all the same. They all rule by brute force.”Owen was frowning, trying to grasp it all. “So, those in the Old World did notlive by their word, by what they claimed they believed. They lived in conflict.They preached that man was better without magic, but they continued to want touse magic.”“That’s right.”Owen gestured up at the statue. “What of this man, then? Why is he here, if heis against what they preached?”Dark clouds roiled above the towering statue. The still air hung cold, heavy,and damp. It felt as if a storm were holding back its onslaught, waiting to hearthe rest.“This man is here because he fought to save the people of the Old World fromsomething they feared more than magic itself,” Richard said.He gazed up at the resolute face with its eyes fixed forever on the place calledthe Pillars of Creation.“This man,” Richard said in a quiet voice, “this wizard, Kaja-Rang, collectedall of those pristinely ungifted people, those pillars of Creation, who had beenbanished down here from the New World, along with any people who while theylived here had joined with them, and he sent them all there.”Richard pointed off into the distance behind the statue.“He put all those people in that place, protected by the mountains all around,and then he placed a boundary of death before them, across this pass, so thatthey could never again come out to be among the rest of the people of the world.“Kaja-Rang gave these people their name: the Bandakar. The name, bandakar, isfrom a very old language called High D’Haran. It means ‘the banished.’ This man,Kaja-Rang, is the one who sealed them in and saved his people from thepristinely ungifted, from those without magic.”“You,” Richard said to the men before him, “are the descendants of thosebanished people. You are the descendants of Alric Rahl, of the people sent intoexile in the Old World. You are all descendants of the House of Rahl. Yourancestors and mine are the same men. You are the banished people.”The top of the pass before the statue of Kaja-Rang was dead silent. The menstared in shock.And then pandemonium broke out. Richard made no effort to stop them, to bringthem to be quiet. Rather, he stood close beside Kahlan as he let them take itin. He wanted to give them the time they needed to come to grasp the enormity ofwhat he had told them.Arms in the air, some men cried out with the outrage at what they’d heard,others wailed with the horror of the story, some wept in sorrow, many argued, afew protested various points that others answered, while yet others repeated keyelements to one another almost as if to hear the words again so they could testthem, agreeing finally that it might very well be so.But through it all, they all slowly began to grasp the enormity of what they’dheard. They all began to hear the ring of truth in the story. Chattering likemagpies, all talking at once, they expressed disbelief, outrage, wonder, andeven fear, as they came to the heady comprehension of who they really were.At the whispered urging of some among the group, after having gotten over theinitial shock, the men all quieted and at last turned back to Richard, hungry toknow more.“You are this gifted man, the favored heir, the Lord Rahl, and we are the onesbanished by your kind,” one of the men said, expressing what looked to be acommon fear, the unspoken question of what this would mean for them.“That’s right,” Richard said. “I am the Lord Rahl, the leader of the D’HaranEmpire, and you are the descendants of the pillars of Creation who werebanished. I am gifted as have been my ancestors, every Lord Rahl before me. Youare ungifted as were your ancestors.”Standing before the statue of Kaja-Rang, the man who had banished them, Richardlooked out at all the tense faces.“That banishment was a grievous wrong. It was immoral. As Lord Rahl, I denouncethe banishment and declare it forever ended. You are no longer the Empire ofBandakar, the banished ones, you are now once again, as you once were, D’Harans,if you choose to be.”Every man seemed to hold his breath, waiting to see if he meant it, or would addmore, or if he might even recant it.Richard put his arm around Kahlan’s waist as he calmly gazed out at all thehopeful expressions.Richard smiled. “Welcome home.”And then they were all falling at his feet, kissing his boots, his pants, hishands, and, for those who couldn’t crowd in close enough, the ground before him.In short order, they were kissing the hem of Kahlan’s dress.They had found a relation, and were in turn welcoming him among them."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42As the men crowded around their feet, openly offering their gratitude for endingtheir sentence of banishment, Richard shared a sidelong glance with Kahlan. Caralooked decidedly displeased by the display but didn’t interfere.Trying to bring a halt to the tearful tribute, Richard gestured for the men toget up. “There is much more to tell you. Listen to me, now.”The smiling, tearful men drew back, hands clasped while gazing at him as if hewere a long-lost brother. There were a few older men among the crowd and some ofmiddle age, but most ranged from young, like Owen, to a little older, likeRichard. They were all men who had been through terrible times.The most difficult part still lay ahead; Richard had to make them face up towhat was to come.Looking over at Jennsen, standing alone off to the side, he gestured for her tocome forward.Jennsen emerged from the shadows of the statue, catching the attention of alleyes as she made her way toward Richard. The men all watched her coming into thelight. She looked so beautiful that Richard couldn’t help smiling as she steppedacross the rocks. Pulling on a red ringlet, she cast a shy glance at the men.When Richard held an arm out, she sought protection under the shelter of thatarm as she gazed nervously out at men who were like her in one important way.“This is my sister, Jennsen Rahl,” Richard said. “She was born pristinelyungifted, just like all of you. Our father tried to kill her, as has been donefor thousands of years with ungifted offspring.”“And you?” a man asked, still skeptical. “You will not reject her?”Richard hugged Jennsen with the one arm. “For what? For what crime should Ireject her? Because she was born a woman, instead of a man like me? Because sheisn’t as tall as me? Because she has red hair, instead of hair like mine?Because her eyes are blue and not gray? ... Because she is ungifted?”The men shifted their weight to the other foot or folded their arms. Some, afterall he had already said, averted their eyes, looking embarrassed to have evenasked the question.“She’s beautiful, smart, and uses her head. She, too, fights for her right tolive, and does so through reasoned means. She is as you men, pristinelyungifted. Because she shares an understanding of the value of life, I embraceher.”Richard heard the bleat and turned. Betty, her rope trailing behind, trotted upthe rise. Jennsen rolled her eyes as Betty came close, peering up, her tailwagging in a blur.Jennsen snatched up the rope, inspecting the end. Richard could see that it hadbeen chewed through.“Betty,” she scolded, shaking the end of the rope at the unrepentant goat, “whatdid you do?”Betty bleated her answer, clearly proud of herself.Jennsen heaved a sigh as she shrugged an apology at Richard.The men had all taken several steps back, murmuring their dread to one another.“I’m not a witch,” Jennsen told them in a heated tone. “Just because I have redhair that doesn’t mean I’m a witch.”The men looked thoroughly unconvinced.“I’ve had dealings with a very real witch woman,” Richard told them. “I canassure you, red hair is no mark of a witch. It just isn’t true.”“It is true,” one of the men insisted. He pointed at Betty. “There is herattendant spirit.”Richard’s brow wrinkled. “Attendant spirit?”“That’s right,” another told him. “A witch always has a familiar with her. Shecalled her attendant spirit and it came to her.”“Called her?” Jennsen brandished the frayed end of the rope at the men. “I tiedher to a tree and she chewed through her rope.”Another man shook his finger at her. “You called her with magic and she came.”Fists at her sides, Jennsen took a step toward the men. They took a collectivestep back.“You men all had family and friends—a community of people. I had no friends andcould have none because my mother and I had to run from my father my whole lifeto keep from being caught. He would have tortured and murdered me had he caughtme—the same as he would have done with you. I could have no childhood friends,so my mother gave me Betty. Betty was just newborn; we grew up together. Bettychewed through her rope because I’m the only family she’s ever known and shesimply wanted to be close to me.“I was banished from everyone for my crime of birth, just like your ancestors.You all know the injustice of such banishment and you know its pain. And now youfoolish men would banish me from your acceptance because I have red hair and agoat as a pet? You are spineless cowards and hypocrites!“First you poison the only person in the world brave enough to end ourbanishment from the rest of mankind and now you fear me and reject me because ofsilly superstitions. If I did have magic, I’d burn you all to a cinder for yourcruel attitudes!”Richard put a hand on her shoulder and drew her back. “It will be all right,” hewhispered to her. “Just let me talk to them.”“You tell us that you’re a wizard,” an older man in the back called out, “andthen you expect us to believe it’s so—on faith—because you say it is, while youclaim that we should not hold to our beliefs, such as our fear that she could bea witch with her familiar, because it’s held only on faith.”“That’s right,” another said. “You claim your belief is in real magic, while youdismiss our belief. A lot of what you say makes sense, but I don’t agree withall of it.”There could be no partial agreement. To reject part of the truth was to rejectit all. Richard considered his options, how he could convince people withoutmagic, who could not see magic, that real magic existed. From their perspective,he seemed guilty of the same error he was telling them they were making. Howcould he demonstrate a rainbow of color to the blind?“You have a point,” Richard said. “Give me a moment and I will show you thereality of the magic I talk about.”He motioned Cara closer. “Get me the warning beacon,” he said in a confidentialtone.Cara immediately took off down the hill. He saw that Jennsen’s angry blue eyeswere filled with tears but she didn’t cry. Kahlan pulled her back farther asRichard addressed the men.“There is more I must tell you—some things you need to understand. I have endedthe banishment, but that does not mean that I unconditionally accept you back asone of our people.”“But you said that we were welcomed home,” Owen said.“I’m stating the obvious—that you have a right to your own life. Out of goodwillI welcome you all to be part of D’Hara if you wish—part of what D’Hara nowstands for. But by welcoming you back, that does not mean that I welcome peopleunconditionally.“All men should be free to live their own lives, but make no mistake, there is avast difference between that freedom and anarchy.“If we triumph in our struggle, you are welcome to be free people of a D’HaranEmpire which holds a belief in specific values. For example, you can thinkwhatever you wish and try to persuade others of the value of your beliefs, butyou cannot act on a view that those who fight to gain that freedom are savagesor criminals, even though you expect to enjoy the fruits of their struggle. Atminimum, they have earned your respect and gratitude. Their lives are no lessthan yours and are not expendable for your benefit. That is slavery.”“But you have savage ways and engage in violence for a land we have never evenseen,” one of the younger men said. He pointed an arm back toward Bandakar. “Theonly land we have ever known is here and we unconditionally reject your love ofviolence.”“Land?” Richard spread his arms. “We do not fight for land. We are loyal to anideal—an ideal of liberty wherever man lives. We do not guard territory, bleedfor a piece of dirt. We don’t fight because we love violence. We fight for ourfreedom as individuals to live our own lives, to pursue our own survival, ourown happiness.“Your unconditional rejection of violence makes you smugly think of yourselvesas noble, as enlightened, but in reality it is nothing less than abject moralcapitulation to evil. Unconditional rejection of self-defense, because you thinkit’s a supposed surrender to violence, leaves you no resort but begging formercy or offering appeasement.“Evil grants no mercy, and to attempt to appease it is nothing more than apiecemeal surrender to it. Surrender to evil is slavery at best, death at worst.Thus, your unconditional rejection of violence is really nothing more thanembracing death as preferable to life.“You will achieve what you embrace.“The right, the absolute necessity, of vengeance against anyone who initiatesforce against you is fundamental to survival. The morality of a people’sself-defense is in its defense of each individual’s right to life. It’s anintolerance of violence, made real by an unwavering willingness to crush any whowould launch violence against you. The unconditional determination to destroyany who would initiate force against you is an exaltation of the value of life.Refusing to surrender your life to any thug or tyrant who lays claim to it is infact embracing life itself.“If you are unwilling to defend your right to your own lives, then you aremerely like mice trying to argue with owls. You think their ways are wrong. Theythink you are dinner.“The Imperial Order preaches that mankind is corrupt and evil, and thereforelife is of little value. Their actions certainly bear this out. They moralizethat you can only win salvation and happiness in some other world, and then onlyby sacrificing your life in this one.“Generosity is fine, if it’s by your free choice, but a belief in the primacy ofself-sacrifice as a moral requisite is nothing less than the sanctioning ofslavery. Those who tell you that it is your responsibility and duty to sacrificeare trying to blind you to the chains they are slipping around your neck.“As D’Harans, you will not be required to sacrifice your life to another, and bythe same token you cannot demand that others sacrifice themselves to you. Youmay believe as you wish, you may even feel that you cannot take up arms andfight directly for our survival, but you must help support our cause and you maynot contribute materially or spiritually to the destruction of our values andtherefore our lives—that is treason and will be treated as such.“The Imperial Order has violently invaded innocent lands, like yours. They haveenslaved, tortured, raped, and murdered in order to seize rule. They have doneno less in the New World. They have forfeited their right to be heard. There isno moral dilemma involved, no ethical question open to debate; they must beground into dust.”A man stepped forward. “But common decency in dealing with our fellow manrequires that we must show them mercy for their misguided ways.”“There is no greater value than life—and that’s what you partially recognize byyour confused notion of granting mercy. Their conscious, deliberate act ofmurder takes the irreplaceable value of life from another. A murderer, by hisown choice to kill, forfeits the right to his own life. Mercy for such evil isnothing short of excusing it and thus allowing evil to prevail—it codifies thetaking of innocent life by not making the murderer forfeit their own guiltylife.“Mercy grants value to the life of a killer, while, at the same time, it stripsaway the value of the life of the innocent victim. It makes the life of a killermore important than the life of an innocent. It is thus a trade of the good tothe evil. It is the victory of death over life.”“So,” Owen wondered aloud, “because the Order has attacked your land andmurdered its people, you intend to try to kill every living person in the OldWorld?”“No. The Order is evil and from the Old World. That does not mean that thepeople of the Old World are evil simply because they happen to have been born ona patch of ground ruled by evil men. Some actively support these rulers andtherefore embrace evil, but not everyone does. Many of the people in the OldWorld are also the victims of the rule of the Imperial Order and suffer greatlyunder its brutality. Many struggle against this evil rule. As we speak, manyrisk their lives to rid themselves of these evil men. We fight for the samething: liberty.“Where those who seek liberty were born is irrelevant. We believe in the valueof the individual’s life. That means that where someone lives does not make themevil—it’s their beliefs and actions that matter.“But make no mistake—many people are an active part of the Imperial Order andits murderous ways. Actions must have consequences. The Order must beeradicated.”“Surely, you would allow some compromise,” one of the older men said.“If, hoping to appease it, you willingly compromise with unrepentant evil, youonly allow such evil to sink its fangs into you; from that day on its venom willcourse through your veins until it finally kills you.”“But that’s too harsh a sentiment,” the man said. “It’s just being stubborn andobstructing a constructive path. There is always room for compromise.”Richard tapped his thumb against his chest. “You men decided to give me poison.That poison will kill me; that makes it evil. How would you suggest I compromisewith poison?”No one had an answer.“In trade between willing parties who share moral values and who deal fairly andhonestly with one another, compromise over something like price is legitimate.In matters of morality or truth, there can be no compromise.“Compromising with murderers, which is precisely what you are suggesting, grantsthem moral equivalence where none can rightfully exist. Moral equivalence saysthat you are no better than they; therefore, their belief—that they should beable to torture, rape, or murder you—is just as morally valid as your view—thatyou have the right to live free of their violence. Moral compromise rejects theconcept of right and wrong. It says that everyone is equal, all desires areequally valid, all action is equally valid, so everyone should compromise to getalong.“Where could you compromise with those who torture, rape, and murder people? Inthe number of days a week you will be tortured? In the number of men to beallowed to rape your loved ones? In how many of your family are to be murdered?“No moral equivalence exists in that situation, nor can it exist, so there canbe no compromise, only suicide.“To even suggest compromise can exist with such men is to sanction murder.”Most of the men appeared shocked and startled to hear someone speaking to themin such a straightforward manner. They seemed to be losing interest in theirsupply of empty adages. Some of the men looked to be moved by Richard’s words. Afew even looked inspired by their clarity; he could see it in their eyes, as ifthey were seeing things for the first time.Cara came up behind Richard and handed him the warning beacon. Richard wasn’tsure, but it seemed as if the inky black had taken over more of the surface ofthe small figure than the last time he’d seen it. Inside, the sand continued totrickle down onto the accumulated pile in the bottom.“Kaja-Rang placed the boundary across this pass to seal your people in. He isthe one who named you. He knew your people shunned violence and he feared youmight end up being prey to criminals. He is the one who gave you a way to banishthem from your land so that you could continue to have the kind of life youwanted. He told your people of the passage through the boundary so that youcould rid yourselves of criminals if you rallied the will.”Owen looked troubled. “If this great wizard, Kaja-Rang, didn’t want our peopleamong the population of the Old World because we would mix with them and spreadour pristinely ungifted trait, as you call it, then what about the criminals webanish? Sending those men out into the world would cause the thing they feared.Making this pass through the boundary and telling our ancestors about it wouldseem to defeat the whole purpose of the boundary.”Richard smiled. “Very good, Owen. You are beginning to think for yourself.”Owen smiled. Richard gestured up at the statue of Kaja-Rang.“You see where he’s looking? It’s a place called the Pillars of Creation. It’s adeathly hot place where nothing lives—a land stalked by death. The boundary thatKaja-Rang placed had sides to it. When you sent people out of your land, throughthe boundary, the walls of death to the sides prevented those banished peoplefrom escaping into the world at large. They had only one way they could go: thePillars of Creation.“Even with water and supplies, and knowing where you must go to get past it,trying to go through the valley known as the Pillars of Creation is almostcertain death. Without water and supplies, without knowing the land, withoutknowing how to travel it and where you must go to escape such a place, those youbanished faced certain death.”The men stared, wide-eyed. “Then, when we banished a criminal, we were actuallyexecuting them,” one of the men said.“That’s right.”“This Kaja-Rang tricked us, then,” the man added. “Tricked us into what wasactually the killing of those men.”“You think that a terrible trick?” Richard asked. “You people were deliberatelysetting known criminals loose on the world to prey on unsuspecting people. Youwere knowingly setting free violent men, and condemning unsuspecting peopleoutside your land to be victims of violence. Rather than put murderers to death,you were, as far as you knew—had you given it any thought—knowingly assistingthem in going on to kill others. In the blind attempt to avoid violence at allcost, you actually championed it.“You told yourselves that those other people didn’t matter, because they weren’tenlightened, like you, that you were better than they because you were aboveviolence, that you unconditionally rejected violence. If you even thought aboutit, you considered these people beyond the boundary to be savages, their livesunimportant. For all intents and purposes, you were sacrificing their innocentlives for the lives of those men you knew to be evil.“What Kaja-Rang was doing, besides keeping the pristinely ungifted from being atlarge in the world, was executing those criminals you banished before they couldharm other people. You think yourselves noble in rejecting violence, but youractions would have fostered it. Only Kaja-Rang’s actions prevented it.”“Dear Creator. It is far worse than that.” Owen sank down, sitting heavily. “Farworse than you even realize.”Other men, too, looked to be stricken with horror. Some had to lower themselvesto the ground as Owen had. Others, their faces in their hands, turned away, orwalked off a few paces.“What do you mean?” Richard asked.Owen looked up, his face ashen. “The story I told you about our land ... aboutour town and the other great cities? How in my town we all lived together andwere happy with our lives?” Richard nodded. “Not all were.”Kahlan crossed her arms and leaned toward Owen. “What do you mean, not allwere?”Owen lifted his hands in a helpless gesture. “Some wanted more than our simplejoyful life. Some people ... well, they wanted to change things. They said theywanted to make things better. They wanted to improve our life, to build placesfor themselves, even though this is against our ways.”“Owen is right,” an older man said in a grim tone. “In my time I have seen agreat many of these people who were unable to endure what some called thechafing principles of our empire.”“And what happened when people wanted to make these changes, or could not endurethe principles of your empire?” Richard asked.Owen looked to each side, to the other dispirited faces. “The great speakersrenounced their ideas. The Wise One said they would only bring strife among us.Their hopes for new ways were turned aside and they were denounced.” Owenswallowed. “So these people decided they would leave Bandakar. They went out ofour land, taking the path through the opening in the boundary, to find a newlife for themselves. Not a single one ever returned to us.”Richard wiped a hand across his face. “Then they died looking for their newlife, a better life than what you had to offer.”“But you don’t understand.” Owen rose to his feet. “We are like those people.”He swept his arm back at his men. “We have refused to go back and give ourselvesover to the men of the Order, even though we know that people are being torturedbecause we hide. We know it will not stop the Order, so we don’t go back.“We have gone against the wishes of our great speakers, and the Wise One, to tryto save our people. We have been denounced for what we choose to do. We havegone out of the pass to seek information, to find a way to rid ourselves of theImperial Order. Do you see? We are much the same as those others throughout ourhistory. Like those others, we chose to leave and try to change things ratherthan to endure the way things were.”“Then perhaps you are beginning to see,” Richard said, “that everything you weretaught showed you only how to embrace death, not life. Perhaps you see that whatyou called the teaching of enlightenment was no more than blinders pulled overyour eyes.”Richard put his hand on Owen’s shoulder. He gazed down at the statue of himselfin his other hand and then looked around at the tense faces.“You men are the ones left after all the rest have failed the tests. You alonegot this far. You alone have started to use your minds to try to find a solutionfor you and your loved ones. You have much more to learn, but you have at leaststarted to make some of the right choices. You must not stop now; you must meetwith courage what I will call upon you to do, if you are to truly have a chanceto save your loved ones.”For the first time they looked at least a little proud. They had beenrecognized, not for how well they repeated meaningless sayings, but for thedecisions they reached on their own.Jennsen was frowning in thought. “Richard, why couldn’t people get back inthrough the passage out through the boundary? If they wanted to go off and havea new life but then discovered that they would have to go through the Pillars ofCreation, why wouldn’t they go back, at least to get supplies, to get what theyneeded so they could make it through?”“That’s right,” Kahlan said. “George Cypher went through the boundary at Kings’Port and then returned. Adie said that the boundary had to have a passage, avent, like where these people banished criminals, so why couldn’t people comeback in? There was a pass out, so why did they never return?”The men nodded, curious to hear why no one ever came back.“From the first, I’ve wondered the same thing.” Richard rubbed a thumb along theglossy black surface of the statue of himself. “I think that the boundaries inthe Midlands had to have an opening through them because they were so big—solong. This boundary, here, is nothing compared to those; I doubt that the samekind of vent would be needed.“Because it was just one bent section of a boundary and not very long, I suspectthat Kaja-Rang was able to put in a pass that allowed criminals to be banishedthrough it, but would not allow passage back in. After all, if a criminal wasbanished and found he couldn’t escape, he would return. Kaja-Rang wouldn’t havewanted that to happen.”“How could such a thing work?” Jennsen asked.Richard rested his left hand on the hilt of his sword. “Certain snakes canswallow prey much larger than themselves. Their teeth are angled back so that asthe prey is devoured, it’s impossible for it to come back out, to escape. Isuppose that the pass through the boundary could have been somehow likethat—only able to be traversed in one direction.”“Do you think such a thing is possible?” Jennsen asked.“There is precedent for such safeguards,” Kahlan said.Richard nodded his agreement. “The great barrier between the New and the OldWorld had defenses to allow certain people, under specific conditions, onepassage through and back, but not two.” He pointed the warning beacon up at thestatue. “A wizard of Kaja-Rang’s ability would surely have known how to craft apass through the boundary that did not allow any return. After all, he called itup out of the underworld itself and it remained viable for nearly three thousandyears.”“So then anyone who went out of this boundary died,” Owen said.Richard nodded. “I’m afraid so. Kaja-Rang appeared to have made elaborate plansthat functioned as he intended for all this time. He even made contingenciesshould the boundary fail.”“That’s something I don’t understand,” a young man said. “If this wizard was sogreat, and his magic was so powerful that he could make a wall of death to keepus separated from the world for three thousand years, then how could it possiblyfail? In the last two years it simply went away. Why?”“I believe it was because of me,” Kahlan said.She took a step closer to the men. Richard didn’t try to stop her. At thispoint, it wouldn’t do to appear as if he were withholding information from them.“A couple of years ago, in a desperate act to save Richard’s life, Iinadvertently called forth underworld power that I believe may be slowlydestroying magic in our world. Richard banished this evil magic, but it had beenhere in the world of life for a time, so the effects may be irreversible.”Worried looks passed among the men. This woman before them had just admittedthat because of something she’d done, their protection had failed. Because ofher, horrifying violence and brutality had befallen them. Because of her, theirway of life had ended."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43You still have not shown us your magic,” one of the men finally said.Richard’s hand slipped away from the small of Kahlan’s back as he stepped towardthe men.“Kaja-Rang devised a facet to his magic, linked to the boundary he placed here,to help protect it.” Richard held up the small figure of himself for all the mento see. “This was sent to warn me that the boundary to your land had failed.”“Why is the top part of it that strange black?” asked a man standing in thefront.“I believe that it’s an indication of how I’m running out of time, how I may bedying.”Worried whispering swept through the group of men. Richard held up a hand,urging them to listen to him as he went on.“This sand inside—can you all see this sand?”Stretching their necks, they all tried to get a look, but not all were closeenough, so Richard walked among them, holding up the statue so that they couldall see that it looked like him, and see the sand falling inside.“This is not really sand,” he told them. “It’s magic.”Owen’s face twisted with skepticism. “But you said we couldn’t see magic.”“You are all pristinely ungifted and aren’t touched by magic, so you can’t seeregular magic. The boundary, however, still prevented you from going out intothe world, didn’t it? Why do you suppose that was so?”“It was a wall of death,” an older man spoke up, seeming to think that it wasself-evident.“But how could it harm people who are not affected by magic? Going into theboundary itself meant death for you the same as anyone else. Why?“Because the boundary is a place in this world where the underworld alsoexisted. The underworld is the world of the dead. You may be ungifted, but youare mortal; since you are linked to life, so, too, are you linked to death.”Richard again held the statue up. “This magic, as well, is tied to theunderworld. Since you are all mortal, you have a connection to the underworld,to the Keeper’s power, to death. That’s why you can see the sand that shows howmy time trickles away.”“I don’t see anything magical about sand trickling down,” a man grumbled. “Justbecause you say it’s magic, or that it’s your life trickling away, that doesn’tseem to prove anything.”Richard turned the statue sideways. The sand continued to flow, but sideways.Gasps and astonished whispering broke out among the men as they watched the sandflowing laterally.They crowded in close like curious children to see the statue as Richard held itup, on its side, so they could see magic. Some reached out and tentativelytouched the inky black surface as Richard held the figure of himself out forthem to inspect. Others leaned close, peering in to see the sand flowing askewin the lower part, where the figure was still transparent.The men spoke of what a wonder it was, but they weren’t sure about hisexplanation of underworld magic.“But we all see this,” one of the men said. “This doesn’t show us that we’rereally different from you or anyone else, as you say we are. This shows us onlythat we are all able to see this magic, the same as you. Maybe we aren’t thispristinely ungifted people you seem to think we are.”Richard thought about it a moment, thought about what he could do to show themthe true aspects of magic. Even though he was gifted, he didn’t know a greatdeal about controlling his own gift, except that it was in part powered by angerlinked to need. He couldn’t simply demonstrate some bit of magic the way Zeddcould, and besides, even if he could do something magical, they wouldn’t be ableto see it.Out of the corner of his eye, Richard saw Cara standing with her arms folded. Anidea came to him.“The bond between the Lord Rahl and his people is a bond of magic,” Richardsaid. “That same magic powers other things, besides the protection that the bondaffords against the dream walker.”Richard gestured for Cara to come forward. “In addition to being my friend, Carais also a Mord-Sith. For thousands of years Mord-Sith have been fierceprotectors of the Lord Rahl.” Richard lifted Cara’s arm for the men to see thered rod hanging from the fine gold chain at her wrist. “This is an Agiel, theweapon of a Mord-Sith. The Agiel is powered by a Mord-Sith’s connection to theLord Rahl—to me.”“But it has no blade on it,” a man said as he looked closely at the Agielswinging on the end of the gold chain. “It has nothing of any use as a weapon.”“Take a closer look at it,” Richard suggested as he held Cara’s elbow and guidedher forward, among the men. “Look at it closely to satisfy yourself that whatthis man has observed, that it has no blade, that it is nothing more than thisslender rod, is true.”The men leaned in close as Cara walked among them, holding her arm up, lettingthe men touch and inspect her Agiel as it dangled from its chain. When they hadall had a look, inspecting the length of it, looking at the end, hefting it tosee that it wasn’t heavy and couldn’t really be used as a club, Richard toldCara to touch it to the men. The Agiel spun up into her fist. Men flinched backat the grim look on her face as she came at them with the thing that Richard hadtold them was a weapon.Cara touched her Agiel to Owen’s shoulder.“She touched me with this red rod before,” he assured his men. “It doesnothing.”Cara pressed the Agiel to every man close enough for her to reach. A few cringedback, fearful of being harmed, even though it had harmed none of their fellows.Many of the men, though, felt the touch of her Agiel and were satisfied thatthere was no ill effect.Richard rolled up his sleeve. “Now, I will show you that this really is apowerful weapon of magic.”He held his arm out to Cara. “Draw blood,” he said in a calm voice that did notbetray what he really thought of being touched by an Agiel.Cara stared at him. “Lord Rahl, I don’t—”“Do it,” Richard commanded as he held his arm out.“Here,” Tom said, thrusting his bared arm in front of her. “Do it to me,instead.”Cara immediately saw this as a preferable test.“No!” Jennsen objected, but too late.Tom cried out as Cara touched the end of her Agiel to his arm. He staggered backa step, a trickle of blood running down his arm. The men stared, unsure whatthey were seeing.“It must be a trick of some kind,” one suggested.As Jennsen comforted Tom, Richard held his arm out again.“Show them,” he told Cara. “Show them what a Mord-Sith’s Agiel can do with magicalone.”Cara looked into his eyes. “Lord Rahl...”“Do it. Show them, so they understand.” He turned to the men. “Gather aroundcloser so you can see that it does its terrible task with no visible means.Watch closely so that you can all see that it’s magic alone doing its grislywork.”Richard clenched his fist as he held the inside of his arm up for her to touch.“Do it so that they can clearly see what it will do; otherwise it will be fornothing. Don’t make me do this for nothing.”Cara pressed her lips tight with the displeasure of his command. She looked oncemore at the resolve in his eyes. When she did, he could see in her blue eyes thepain it gave her to hold the Agiel. He clenched his teeth and nodded that he wasready. With an iron visage, she laid the Agiel against the inside of hisforearm.It felt like lightning hit him.The touch of the Agiel was out of all proportion to what it would appear itshould feel like. The thunderous jolt of pain shot up his arm. The shock of itslammed into his shoulder. It felt like the bones in his entire arm shattered.Teeth gritted, he held his trembling arm out as Cara slowly dragged the Agieldown toward his wrist. Blood-filled blisters rose in its wake. Blood gushed downhis arm.Richard held his breath, kept his abdominal muscles tight, as he went to oneknee, not because he intended to, but because he couldn’t remain standing underthe weight of pain as he held his arm up for Cara as she pressed the Agiel toit. The men gasped as they watched, shocked at the blood, the obvious pain. Theywhispered their astonishment.Cara withdrew the weapon. Richard released the rigid tension in his muscles,bending forward as he panted, trying to catch his breath, trying to remainupright. Blood dripped off his fingers.Kahlan was there beside him with a small scarf Jennsen pulled from a pocket.“Are you out of your mind?” she hissed heatedly as she wrapped his bleeding arm.“Thanks,” he said in response to her care, not wanting to address her question.He couldn’t make his fingers stop trembling. Cara had held little back. He wassure that she hadn’t broken any bones, but it felt as if she had. He could feeltears of pain running down his face.When Kahlan finished, Cara put a hand under his arm and helped him to his feet.“The Mother Confessor is right,” she growled under her breath. “You are out ofyour mind.”Richard didn’t argue the need of what he’d had her do, but instead turned to themen. He held his arm out. A wet crimson stain slowly grew along the length ofthe scarf bandage.“There is powerful magic for you. You can’t see the magic, but you can see theresults. That magic can kill, should Cara wish it.” The men cast worried glancesher way, viewing her with newfound respect. “But it could not harm you menbecause you have no ability to interact with such magic. Only those born withthe spark of the gift can feel the touch of an Agiel.”The mood had changed. The sight of blood had sobered everyone.Richard paced slowly before the men. “I’ve given you the truth in all that I’vetold you. I’ve kept nothing important or relevant from you, nor will I. I’vetold you who I am, who you are, and how we’ve come to this point. If there isanything you wish to know, I will give you my truthful answer.”When Richard paused, the men looked around at one another, seeing if anyonewould ask a question. No one did.“The time has come,” Richard said, “for you men to decide your future and thefuture of your loved ones. Today is the day upon which that future hinges.”Richard gestured toward Owen. “I know that Owen had a woman he loved, Marilee,who was taken away by the Order. I know that each of you has suffered great lossat the hands of the men of the Imperial Order. I don’t know all your names, yet,or the names of the loved ones taken from you, but please believe me when I tellyou that I know such pain.“While I understand how you came to the point where you thought you had nooptions but to poison me, it wasn’t right for you to have done so.” Many menlooked away from Richard’s gaze, casting their own downward. “I’m going to giveyou a chance to set the proper course for yourselves and your loved ones.”He let them consider this a moment before going on. “You men have passed manytests to make it this far, to have survived this long in such a brutal situationas you have all faced, but now you must make a choice.”Richard rested a hand on the hilt of his sword. “I want to know where you’vehidden the antidote to the poison you’ve given me.”Worried looks spread through the crowd. Men glanced to the side, trying to judgethe feelings of their fellows, trying to see what they would do.Owen, too, tried to gauge the reaction of his friends, but being just asuncertain as he, they offered no firm indication of what they wanted to do.Finally he licked his lips and timidly asked a question.“If we say that we will tell you where the antidote is, will you agree to firstgive us your word that you will help us?”Richard resumed his measured pacing. The men nervously waited for his answer asthey watched blood drip off his fingers, leaving a trail of crimson drops on thestone.“No,” Richard said. “I will not allow you to link two separate issues. It waswrong to poison me. This is your chance to reverse that wrong. Linking it to anyconcession perpetuates the fallacy that it can somehow be justified. Telling mewhere you’ve hidden the antidote is the only proper thing for you to do, now,and must be without condition. This is the day you must decide how you will liveyour future. Until you give me your decision, I will tell you nothing more.”Some of the men looked on the verge of panic, some on the verge of tears. Owenprodded them all back, away from Richard, so that they could discuss it amongthemselves.“No,” Richard said, his pacing coming to a halt. The men all fell silent andturned back toward him. “I don’t want any of you coming to a decision because ofwhat another says. I want each of you to give me your own personal decision.”The men stared. A number spoke up all at once, wanting to know what he meant.“I want to know, without any preconditions, what each individual chooses todo—to free me of the poison, or to use it as a threat on my life to gain mycooperation. I want to know each man’s choice.”“But we must reach a consensus,” one man said.“For what purpose?” Richard asked.“In order for our decision to be correct,” he explained. “No proper decisionabout the right course of action in any important situation can be made withouta consensus.”“You are attempting to give moral authority to mob rule,” Richard said.“But a consensus points to the proper moral judgment,” another man insisted,“because it is the will of the people.”“I see,” Richard said. “So what you’re saying is that if all of you men decideto rape my sister, here, then it’s a moral act because you have a consensus torape her, and if I oppose you, I’m immoral for standing alone and failing tohave a consensus behind me. That about the way you men see it?”The men shrank back in confused revulsion. One spoke up.“Well... no, not exactly—”“Right and wrong are not the product of consensus,” Richard said, cutting himoff. “You are trying to make a virtue of mob rule. Rational moral choices arebased on the value of life, not a consensus. A consensus can’t make the sun riseat midnight, nor can it change a wrong into a right, or the other way around. Ifsomething is wrong, it matters not if a thousand other men are for it; you muststill oppose it. If something is just, no amount of popular outcry should stayyou from your course.“I’ll not hear any more of this empty gibberish about a consensus. You are not aflock of geese; you are men. I will know the mind of each of you.” He gesturedto the ground at their feet. “Everyone, pick up two pebbles.”Richard watched as the bewildered men hesitantly bent and did his bidding.“Now,” Richard said, “you will put either one or both pebbles in a closed fist.Each of you will come up to me, to the man you poisoned, and you will open yourfist so that I can see your decision but the others can’t.“One pebble will mean no, you will not tell me where the antidote is locatedunless I first pledge to try to free your people. Two pebbles in your one fistwill mean yes, you agree to tell me, without any precondition, where to find theantidote to the poison you’ve given me.”“But what will happen if we agree to tell you?” one of the men asked. “Will youstill give us our freedom?”Richard shrugged. “After each of you has given me your answer, you will all findout mine. If you tell me the location of the antidote, I may help you, or onceI’m free of your poison, I may leave you and return to taking care of my ownurgent problems. You will only find out after you’ve given me your answer.“Now, turn away from your friends and put either one pebble in your fist for noor two pebbles to agree to reveal the location of the poison. When you’vefinished, come forward one at a time and open your hand to show me your ownindividual decision.”The men milled around, casting sidelong glances at one another, but as he’dinstructed, they refrained from discussing the matter. Each man finally setabout privately slipping pebbles into his fist.As the men were occupied, Cara and Kahlan moved in close around Richard. Itlooked like the two of them had been reaching conclusions of their own.Cara seized his arm. “Are you crazy?” she whispered in an angry tone.“You’ve both already asked me that today.”“Lord Rahl, need I remind you that you once before called for a vote and it onlygot you into trouble? You said you would not do such a foolish thing again.”“Cara is right,” Kahlan argued in a low voice so the men couldn’t hear.“This time is different.”“It’s not different,” Cara snapped. “It’s trouble.”“It’s different,” he insisted. “I’ve told them what’s right and why; now theymust decide if they will choose to do the right thing or not.”“You’re allowing others to decide your future,” Kahlan said. “You’re placingyour fate in their hands.”Richard let out a deep breath as he gazed into Kahlan’s green eyes and then theicy blue eyes of the Mord-Sith. “I have to do this. Now, let them come up andshow me their decision.”Cara stormed off to stand back by the statue of Kaja-Rang. Kahlan gave his arm asqueeze, offering her silent support, accepting his decision even if she didn’tunderstand his reasons. A brief smile of appreciation was all he could managebefore she turned and walked back to stand by Cara, Jennsen, and Tom.Richard turned away, not wanting to let Kahlan see how much pain he was in. Theache from the poison was slowly creeping back up his chest. Every breath hurt.His arm still trembled with the lingering ache of being touched by an Agiel. Theworst, though, was the headache. He wondered if Cara could see it in his eyes.After all, the business of Mord-Sith was pain.He knew he couldn’t wait until after helping these men fight off the Orderbefore getting the antidote to the poison. He had no idea how to rid theirempire of the Imperial Order. He couldn’t even rid his own empire of theinvaders.Worse, though, he could feel that he was running out of time. His gift wasgiving him the headaches and, if not attended to, would eventually kill him, butworse, it was weakening him, allowing the poison to work faster. With eachpassing day he was having more and more difficulty working past the poison.If he could get these men to agree to do this, to tell him where they’d hiddenthe antidote, then he might be able to recover it in time.If not, then his chance to live was as good as over."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44The men milled around the top of the pass, some staring off into their ownthoughts, some gazing up at the statue of Kaja-Rang, the man who had banishedtheir people. Some of the men snatched glimpses at their companions. Richardcould see that they were aching to ask friends what they would do, but they keptto Richard’s orders and didn’t speak.Finally, when Richard stepped up before them, one of the younger men cameforward. He had been one of the men eager to hear Richard’s words. He’d lookedas if he had listened carefully and considered the things Richard had told them.Richard knew that if this man said no, then there was no chance that any of theothers would agree.When the young, blond-headed man opened his fist, two pebbles lay in his palm.Richard let out an inner sigh that at least one of the men had actually chosento do the right thing.Another man came forward and opened his fist, showing two pebbles sitting in hispalm. Richard nodded in acknowledgment, without showing any reaction, and lethim move aside. The rest of the men had lined up. Each stepped forward in turnand silently opened his hand. Each showed him two pebbles, showing that he wouldrecant their death threat, and then moved off so that the next man could showhis choice.Owen was the last in line. He looked up at Richard, pressed his lips tight, andthen thrust out his hand. “You have done us no harm,” he said as he opened hisfist. There in his palm lay two pebbles.“I don’t know what will happen to us, now,” Owen said, “but I can see that wemust not cause you harm because we are desperate for your help.”Richard nodded. “Thank you.” The sincerity in his voice brought smiles to manyof the faces watching. “You have all showed two pebbles. I’m encouraged thatyou’ve all chosen to do the right thing. We now have common ground upon which tofind a future course.”The men looked around one another in surprise. They each cheerfully gathered inclose to their friends, talking excitedly to one another about how they had allmade the same decision. They looked gleeful that they were united in theirdecision. Richard moved back to where Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, and Tom stood.“Satisfied?” he asked Kahlan and Cara.Cara folded her arms. “What would you have done had they all chosen to keep theantidote’s location a secret until after you helped them?”Richard shrugged. “I’d be no better off than I was, but no worse off, either.I’d have to help them, but at least I would know that I dare not trust any ofthem.”Kahlan still didn’t look pleased. “And what if most of them would have said yes,but some stuck to their ways and said no?”Richard looked into her resolute green eyes. “Then, after the ones who agreedhad told me where to find the antidote, I would have had to kill those who saidno.”Understanding the seriousness of his explanation, Kahlan nodded. Cara smiled hersatisfaction. Jennsen looked shocked.“If any would have said no,” he explained to Jennsen, “then they would have beenchoosing to continue to enslave me, to hold a sentence of death over my head inorder to manipulate my life to get what they wanted from me. I would never beable to trust them in what I must ask the rest of them to do. I couldn’t trustour lives to such treachery. But, now, that’s one less problem we have to worryabout.”Richard turned to the waiting men. “Each of you has decided to return my life tome.”The faces watching him turned serious as they waited to hear what he would donow. Richard gazed down at the small figure of himself, at the sand tricklingdown, at the eerie black surface that had already descended over the top of thestatue, like the underworld itself slowly claiming his life. His fingers leftsmears of blood across the surface of the figure.The clouds had lowered in around them, thickening so that the afternoon lightseemed more like the gloom of dusk.Richard lowered the statue and looked back up at the men. “We will do our bestto see if we can help you get rid of the Order.”A cheer rose into the thin, cold air. The men hooted their excitement as well astheir relief. He hadn’t yet seen any of them smile quite this broadly before.Those smiles, more than anything, revealed the depth of their wish to be free ofthe men of the Order. Richard wondered how they would feel about it when hefinally told them their part.He knew that as long as Nicholas the Slide was able to seek them out through theeyes of the races, he would remain a threat that would haunt them wherever theywent and endangered all of their work to get the Old World to rise up andoverthrow the Imperial Order. More than that, though, Nicholas would be able todirect killers to find them. The thought of Nicholas seeing Kahlan and knowingwhere to find her gave Richard chills. He had to eliminate Nicholas. It waspossible that in doing so, in eliminating their leader, he would also help thesepeople drive the Order from their homes.Richard gestured for the men to gather in closer. “First, before we get to thematter of freeing your people, you need to show me where you’ve hidden thepoison.”Owen squatted down and selected a stone from nearby. With it, he scratched achalky oval on the face of a flat spot in the rock. “Say that this line is themountains surrounding Bandakar.” He set the stone at the end of the oval closestto Richard. “Then this is the pass into our land, where we are now.”He plucked three pebbles from the ground. “This is our town, Witherton, where welived,” he said as he set the first pebble down not far from the rock thatrepresented the pass. “There is antidote there.”“And this is where all of you men were hiding?” Richard asked as he circled afinger over the first pebble. “In the hills surrounding Witherton?”“Mostly to the south,” Owen said, pointing to the area. He placed the secondpebble near the middle of the oval. “Here there is another vial of antidote, inthis city, here, called Hawton.” He placed the third pebble near the edge of theoval. “Here is the third vial, in this city, Northwick.”“So then,” Richard summed up, “I just need to go to one of those three placesand recover the antidote. Since your town is the smallest, that would probablybe our best chance.”Some of the men shook their heads; others looked away.Owen, looking troubled, touched each of the three pebbles. “I’m sorry, LordRahl, but one of these is not enough. Too much time has passed. Even two will beinsufficient by now. The man who made the poison said that if too much timepassed, all four would be necessary to insure a remedy.“He said that if you did not immediately take the first antidote I brought, thenit would only halt the poison for a while. He said that then the other threevials would all be needed. He said that in this case, the poison would possiblygo through three states. If you are to be free of the poison, you must drink allof the three remaining antidotes. If you don’t, you will die.”“Three states? What does that mean?”“The first state will be pain in your chest. The second state will be dizzinessthat makes standing difficult.” Owen looked away from Richard’s gaze. “In thethird state the poison makes you blind.” He looked up and touched a hand toRichard’s arm, as if to dispel his worry. “But taking three vials of theantidote will cure you, make you well.”Richard wiped a weary hand across his brow. The pain in his chest told him thathe was in the poison’s first state.“How much time do I have?”Owen looked down as he straightened his sleeve. “I’m not sure, Lord Rahl. Wehave already taken a lot of time traveling this far since you had that firstvial. I think we have no time to lose.”“How much time?” Richard asked in as calm a voice as he could manage.Owen swallowed. “To be truthful, Lord Rahl, I’m surprised that you are able tostand the pain from the first state of the poison. From what I was told, thepain would grow as time passed.”Richard simply nodded. He didn’t look up at Kahlan.With soldiers of the Imperial Order occupying Bandakar, getting in to recoverthe antidote from one place sounded difficult enough, but retrieving it from allthree places sounded beyond difficult.“Well, since time is short, I have a better idea,” Richard said. “Make me moreof the antidote. Then we won’t have to worry about getting what you’ve hiddenand we can simply worry about how best to take on the men of the Order.”Owen shrugged one shoulder. “We can’t.”“Why not?” Richard leaned in. “You made it before—you made the antidote that youhid. Make it again.”Owen shrank back. “We can’t.”Richard took a patient breath. “Why not?”Owen pointed off at the small bag he’d brought, now lying to the side—the bagcontaining the fingers of three girls. “The father of those girls was the manwho made the poison and made the antidote. He is the only one among us who knewhow to make such complex things with herbs. We don’t know how—we don’t even knowmany of the ingredients he used.“There may be others in the cities who could make an antidote, but we don’t knowwho they are, or if they are still alive. With men of the Order in those placeswe wouldn’t even be able to find these people. Even if we could, we don’t knowwhat was used to make up the poison, so they would not know how to make anantidote. The only chance you have to live is to recover the three vials ofantidote.”Richard’s head was hurting so much that he didn’t know if he could stand muchlonger. With only three vials in existence, and all three needed if he was tolive, he had to get to them before anything happened to any one of them. Someonecould find one and throw it out. They could be moved. They could be broken, theantidote draining away into the ground. With every breath, he felt stitches ofpain pull inside his chest. Panic gnawed at the edges of his thoughts.When Kahlan rested her hand on his shoulder, Richard laid a grateful hand overhers.“We will help you get the antidote, Lord Rahl,” one of the men said.Another nodded. “That’s right. We will help you get it.”The men all spoke up, then, saying that they would all help to get the antidoteso that Richard could rid himself of the poison.“Most of us have been to at least two of these places,” Owen said. “Some of ushave been to all three. I hid the antidote, but I told the others the places, sowe all know where it is. We know where we have to get in to recover it. We willtell you, too.”“Then that’s what we’ll do.” Richard squatted down as he studied the stone map.“Where is Nicholas?”Owen leaned in and tapped the pebble in the center. “Here, in Hawton, is thisman Nicholas.”Richard looked up at Owen. “Don’t tell me. You hid the antidote in the buildingwhere you saw Nicholas.”Owen shrugged self-consciously. “At the time, it seemed like a good idea. Now, Iwish I had thought better of it.”Standing behind Richard, Cara rolled her eyes in disgust. “I’m surprised youdidn’t hand it to Nicholas and ask him to hold on to it for you.”Appearing eager to change the subject, Owen pointed at the pebble representingNorthwick. “In this city is where the Wise One is hiding. Maybe we can get helpfrom the great speakers. Maybe the Wise One will give us his blessing and thenpeople will help us in our effort to rid our land of the Imperial Order.”After all he’d learned about the people who lived beyond the boundary inBandakar, Richard didn’t think he could count on any meaningful help from them;they wanted to be free of marauding brutes, but condemned their only real meansto be free. These men had at least proven a degree of resolve. These men wouldhave to work to change other people’s attitudes, but Richard had his doubts thatthey would garner much immediate help.“In order to accomplish what you men rightfully want—to eradicate the Order, orat least make them leave your homes—you are going to have to help. Kahlan, Cara,Jennsen, Tom, and I aren’t going to be able to do it alone. If it’s to work, youmen must help us.”“What is it you wish us to do?” Owen asked. “We already said we will take you tothese places where the antidote is hidden. What more can we do?”“You are going to have to help us kill the men of the Order.”Instantly, heated protests erupted. All of the men talked at once, shaking hishead, warding the notion with his hands. Although Richard couldn’t make out alltheir words, their feelings about what he said were obvious enough. What wordshe did hear were all objections that they couldn’t kill.Richard rose up. “You know what these men have done,” he said in a powerfulvoice that brought them to silence. “You ran away so you wouldn’t also bekilled. You know how your people are being treated. You know what’s being doneto your loved ones in captivity.”“But we can’t harm another,” Owen whined. “We can’t.”“It’s not our way,” another man added.“You banished criminals through the boundary,” Richard said. “How did you makethem go through if they refused?”“If we had to,” one of the older men said, “a number of us would hold him, sothat he could harm no one. We would tie his hands and bear him to the boundary.We would tell such a banished man that he must go out of our land. If he stillrefused, we would carry him to a long steep place in the rock where we would layhim down and push him feet first so that he would slide down the rock and gobeyond. Once we did this, they weren’t able to return.”Richard wondered at the lengths these people went to not to harm the worstanimals among them. He wondered how many had to suffer or die at the hands ofsuch criminals before the people of Bandakar were sufficiently motivated to takewhat were to them extreme measures.“We understand much of what you have told us,” Owen said, “but we cannot do whatyou ask. We would be doing wrong. We have been raised not to harm another.”Richard snatched up the bag with the girls’ fingers and shook it at the men.“Every one of your loved ones back there is thinking of nothing but being saved.Can any of you even imagine their terror? I know what it’s like to be tortured,to feel helpless and alone, to feel like you will never escape. In such asituation you want nothing more than for it to stop. You would do anything forit to stop.”“That’s why we needed you,” an older man said. “You must do this. You must ridus of the Order.”“I told you, I can’t do it alone.” With an arm wrapped in a bloody bandage,Richard gestured emphatically. “Surrendering your will to men of the Order whowould do such things as this solves nothing. It simply adds more victims. Themen of the Order are evil; you must fight back.”“But if only you would talk to those men like you talked to us, they would seetheir misguided ways. They would change, then.”“No, they won’t. Life doesn’t matter to them. They’ve made their choice totorture, rape, and kill. Our only chance to survive, our only chance to have afuture is to destroy them.”“We can’t harm another person,” one of the men said.“It’s wrong to harm another,” Owen agreed.“It’s always immoral to hurt, much less kill, another person,” a middle-aged mansaid to the mumbled agreement of his fellows. “Those who do wrong are obviouslyin pain and need our understanding, not our hate. Hate will only invite hate.Violence will only begin a cycle of violence that never solves anything.”Richard felt as if the ground he had gained with these men was slipping awayfrom him. He was about to run his fingers back through his hair when he saw thatthey were covered in blood. He dropped his arm and shifted his approach.“You poisoned me to get me to kill these men. By that act, you’ve already proventhat you accept the reality that it’s sometimes necessary to kill in order tosave innocent lives—that’s why you wanted me. You can’t hold a belief that it’swrong to harm another and at the same time coerce me to do it for you. That’ssimply killing by proxy.”“We need our freedom,” one of them said. “We thought that maybe because of yourcommand as a ruler you could convince these men, for fear of you, to leave usbe.”“That’s why you have to help me. You just said it—for fear of me.You must helpme in this so that the threat, the fear, is credible. If they don’t believe thethreat is real then why would they leave your land?”One of the others folded his arms. “We thought you might rid us of the Orderwithout violence, without killing, but it is up to you to do such killing ifthat is your way. We cannot kill. From our very beginning, our ancestors havetaught us that killing is wrong. You must do this.”Another, nodding his agreement, said, “It’s your duty to help those who cannotbring themselves to do what you can do.”Duty. The polite name put to the chains of servitude.Richard turned away, closing his eyes as he squeezed his temples between fingersand thumb. He’d thought that he was beginning to get through to these men. He’dthought he would be able to get them to think for themselves—in their own bestinterest—rather than to function spontaneously according to the rote dictates oftheir indoctrination.He could hardly believe that after all he’d told them, these men would stillrather have their loved ones endure torture and brutal murder than harm the mencommitting the crimes. By refusing to face the nature of reality, these men werewillingly giving the good over to evil, life over to death.He realized then that it was even more basic than that. In the most fundamentalsense, they were willfully choosing to reject the reality of evil.Deep inside him, every breath pulled a stitch of pain. He had to get theantidote. He was running out of time.But that alone would not solve his problems; his gift was killing him just assurely as the poison. He felt so sick from the pounding pain of his headachethat he thought he might throw up. Even the magic of his sword was failing him.Richard feared the poison, but in a more central way, he feared the encroachingdeath from within, from his gift. The poison, as dangerous as it was, had aclearly defined cause and cure. With his gift, he felt lost.Richard looked back into Kahlan’s troubled eyes. He could see that she had nosolution to offer. She stood in a weary pose, her arm hanging straight with theweight of the warning beacon that seemed to tell him only that he was dying, butoffered no answers. Its whole reason for being was to call him to a proclaimedduty to help replace the boundary, as if his life was not his own, but belongedto anyone who laid claim to it by shackling him with a declaration of duty.That concept—duty—was no less a poison than that which these men had given him... a call to sacrifice himself.Richard took the small statue from Kahlan’s hand and stared down at it. The inkyblack had already enveloped half the length of the figure. His life was beingconsumed. The sand continued to trickle away. His time was running out.The stone figure of Kaja-Rang, the long-dead wizard who had summoned him withthe warning beacon and charged him with an impossible task, loomed over him asif in silent rebuke.Behind him, the men huddled close, affirming to one another their beliefs, theirways, their responsibility to their ancient ideals, that the men of the Orderwere acting as they were because they were misguided and could still bereformed. They spoke of the Wise One and all the great speakers who hadcommitted them to the path of peace and nonviolence. They all reaffirmed thebelief that they must follow the path that had been laid down for them from thevery beginning by their land’s founders, their ancestors, who had given themtheir customs, their beliefs, their values, their way of living.Trying to elevate these men to understand what was right and necessary seemed asdifficult as trying to lift them by a slender thread. That thread had broken.Richard felt trapped by the deluded convictions of these people, by theirpoison, by the headaches, by Nicholas hunting them, and by a long-dead wizardwho had reached out from the underworld to try to enslave him to a long-deadduty.Anger welling up inside him, Richard cocked his arm and heaved the warningbeacon at the statue of Kaja-Rang.The men ducked as the small figure shot by just over their heads to shatteragainst the stone base of the statue. Amber fragments and inky black shards flewin every direction. The sand from inside splattered in a stain across the frontof the granite pedestal.The cowering men fell silent. Overhead, wisps trailing from the sullen cloudsdrifted by, almost close enough to reach up and touch. A few icy flakes of snowfloated along in the still air. All around, a frigid fog had moved in to envelopthe surrounding mountains, leaving the top of the pass with the stone sentinelseeming isolated and otherworldly, as if this were all there was to existence.Richard stood in the dead quiet at the center of everyone’s attention.The words written in High D’Haran on the statue’s base echoed through Richard’smind.Fear any breach of this seal to the empire beyond... for beyond is evil: thosewho cannot see.The High D’Haran words streamed again and again through his mind. Thetranslation of those words just didn’t feel right.“Dear spirits,” Richard whispered in sudden realization. “I had it wrong. That’snot what it says.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45Khalan felt as if her heart were being crushed by the ordeal these men wereputting Richard through. Just when she’d thought he had gotten them tounderstand the truth of what was needed, it seemed to have slipped away as themen reverted to their willful blindness.Richard, though, seemed almost to have forgotten the men. He stood staring atwhere the warning beacon had shattered against the statue. Kahlan stepped closerto him and whispered.“What do you mean, you had it wrong, and that’s not what it says? What are youtalking about?”“The translation,” he said in what sounded like startled comprehension. He stoodmotionless, facing the towering statue of Kaja-Rang. “Remember how I told youthat it was an odd way to phrase what it said?”Kahlan glanced to the statue and then back to Richard. “Yes.”“It wasn’t odd at all; I just had it wrong. I was trying to make it say what Ithought it would say—that those beyond couldn’t see magic—instead of just seeingwhat was before me. What I told you before isn’t what it says...”When his voice trailed off, Kahlan reached up and gripped his arm to draw hisattention. “What do you mean, that’s not what it says?”Richard gestured toward the statue. “I see what I did wrong with the phrasalsequence, why I was having trouble with it. I told you I wasn’t sure of thetranslation. I was right to have doubts. It doesn’t say, ‘Fear any breach ofthis seal to the empire beyond... for beyond is evil: those who cannot see.’ “Jennsen leaned in close beside Kahlan. “Are you sure?”Richard looked back at the statue, his voice distant. “I am now.”Kahlan pulled on his arm, making him look at her. “So what does it say?”His gray eyes met her gaze briefly before turning to the eyes of the statue ofKaja-Rang staring out at the Pillars of Creation, at his final safeguardprotecting the world from these people. Instead of answering her, he startedaway.The men parted as Richard strode toward the statue. Kahlan stayed close on hisheels, Cara following in her wake. Jennsen gathered up Betty’s rope and pulledher along. The men, already backing out of the way for Richard, kept a wary eyeon the goat and her mistress as they passed. Tom stayed where he was, keeping acareful but unobtrusive watch over all the men.At the statue, Richard swiped the dusting of snow off the ledge, revealing againthe words carved in High D’Haran. Kahlan watched his eyes moving along the lineof words, reading them to himself. He had a kind of excitement in his movementsthat told her he was racing after an important quarry.For the moment, she could also see that his headache was gone. She couldn’tunderstand the way it ebbed from time to time, but she was relieved to seestrength in the way he moved. Hands spread on the stone, leaning on his arms, helooked up from the words. Without the headache, there was a vibrant clarity inhis gray eyes.“Part of this story has been puzzling,” he said. “I understand now. It doesn’tsay, ‘Fear any breach of this seal to the empire beyond... for beyond is evil:those who cannot see.’ “Jennsen’s nose wrinkled. “It doesn’t? You mean it wasn’t meant to be about thesepristinely ungifted people?”“Oh, it was about them, all right, but not in that respect.” Richard tapped afinger to the carved words. “It doesn’t say ‘for beyond is evil: those whocannot see,’ but something profoundly different. It says, ‘Fear any breach ofthis seal to the empire beyond ... for beyond are those who cannot see evil.’ “Kahlan’s brow drew down. “... those who cannot see evil.”Richard lifted his bandaged arm up toward the figure towering over them. “That’swhat Kaja-Rang feared most—not those who couldn’t see magic, but those who couldnot see evil. That’s his warning to the world.” He aimed a thumb back over hisshoulder, indicating the men behind them. “That’s what this is all about.”Kahlan was taken aback, and a little perplexed. “Do you think it might be thatbecause these people can’t see magic they also can’t recognize evil,” she asked,“or that because of the way they’re different they simply don’t have the abilityto conceive of evil, in much the same way they can’t conceive of objective magicas having nothing to do with mysticism?”“That might in part be what Kaja-Rang thought,” Richard said. “But I don’t.”“Are you so sure?” Jennsen asked.“Yes.”Before Kahlan could make him explain, Richard turned to the men. “Here, instone, Kaja-Rang left a warning for the world. Kaja-Rang’s warning is aboutthose who cannot see evil. Your ancestors were banished from the New Worldbecause they were pristinely ungifted. But this man, this powerful wizard,Kaja-Rang, feared them for something else: their ideas. He feared them becausethey refused to see evil. That’s what made your ancestors so dangerous to thepeople of the Old World.”“How could that be?” a man asked.“Thrown together and banished to a strange place, the Old World, your ancestorsmust have clung desperately to one another. They were so afraid of rejection, ofbanishment, that they avoided rejecting one of their own. It developed into astrong belief that no matter what, they should try not to condemn anyone. Forthis reason, they rejected the concept of evil for fear they would have to judgesomeone. Judging someone as evil meant they would have to face the problem ofremoving them from their midst.“In their flight from reality, they justified their practices by settling on thefanciful notion that nothing is real and so no one can know the nature ofreality. That way, they wouldn’t have to admit that someone was evil. Better todeny the existence of evil than have to eliminate the evildoer in their midst.Better to turn a blind eye to the problem, ignore it, and hope it went away.“If they admitted the reality of evil, then eliminating the evildoer was theonly proper action, so, by extension, since they had been banished, they thoughtthat they must have been banished because they were evil. Their solution was tosimply discard the entire concept of evil. An entire belief structure developedaround this core.“Kaja-Rang may have thought that because they were pristinely ungifted andcouldn’t see magic, they also couldn’t see evil, but what he feared was theinfection of their beliefs spreading to others. Thinking requires effort; thesepeople offered beliefs that needed no thought, but merely adopting somenoble-sounding phrases. It was, in fact, an arrogant dismissal of the power ofman’s mind—an illusion of wisdom that spurned the requirement of any authenticeffort to understand the world around them or the nuisance of validation. Suchsimplistic solutions, such as unconditionally rejecting all violence, areespecially seductive to the undeveloped minds of the young, many of whom wouldhave eagerly adopted such disordered reasoning as a talisman of enlightenment.“When they began fanatically espousing these empty tenets to others, it probablyset off the alarm for Kaja-Rang.“With the spread of such ideas, with the kind of rabid hold it has over somepeople, such as it has over you men, Kaja-Rang and his people saw how, if suchbeliefs ran free, it would eventually bring anarchy and ruin by sanctioning evilto stalk among their people, just as it leaves you men defenseless against theevil of the Imperial Order now come among you.“Kaja-Rang saw such beliefs for what they were: embracing death rather thanlife. The regression from true enlightenment into the illusion of insightspawned disorder, becoming a threat to all of the Old World, raising the specterof a descent into darkness.”Richard tapped his finger on the top of the ledge. “There is other writing uphere, around the base, that suggests as much, and what became the eventualsolution.“Kaja-Rang had those who believed these teachings collected, not only all thepristinely ungifted banished from the New World, but also the rabid believerswho had fallen under their delusional philosophy, and banished the whole lot ofthem.“The first banishment, from the New World down to the Old, was unjust. Thesecond banishment, from the Old World to the land beyond here, had been earned.”Jennsen, twiddling the frayed end of Betty’s rope, looked dubious. “Do youreally think there were others banished along with those who were pristinelyungifted? That would mean there were a great many people. How could Kaja-Ranghave made all these people go along? Didn’t they resist? How did Kaja-Rang makethem all go? Was it a bloody banishment?”The men were nodding to her questions, apparently wondering the same thing.“I don’t believe that High D’Haran was a common language among the people, notdown here, anyway. I suspect that it was a dying language only used amongcertain learned people, such as wizards.” Richard gestured to the land beyond.“Kaja-Rang named these people Bandakar—the banished. I don’t think the peopleknew what it meant. Their empire was not called the Pillars of Creation, or somename referring only to the ungifted. The writing here suggests that it wasbecause it was not only the pristinely ungifted who were banished, but all thosewho believed as they did. They all were Bandakar: the banished.“They thought of themselves, of their beliefs, as enlightened. Kaja-Rang playedon that, flattering them, telling them that this place had been set aside toprotect them from a world not ready to accept them. He made them feel that, inmany ways, they were being put here because they were better than anyone else.Not given to reasoned thinking, these people were easily beguiled in thisfashion and duped into cooperating with their own banishment. According towhat’s hinted at in the writing here around the statue’s base, they went happilyinto their promised land. Once confined to this place, marriage and subsequentgenerations spread the pristinely ungifted trait throughout the entirepopulation of Bandakar.”“And Kaja-Rang really believed they were such a terrible threat to the rest ofthe people of the Old World?” Jennsen asked. Again, men nodded, apparently insatisfaction that she had asked the question. Kahlan suspected that Jennsenmight have asked the question on behalf of the men.Richard gestured up at the statue of Kaja-Rang. “Look at him. What’s he doing?He’s symbolically standing watch over the boundary he placed here. He’s guardingthis pass, watching over a seal keeping back what lies beyond. In his eternalvigilance his hand holds a sword, ever at the ready, to show the magnitude ofthe danger.“The people of the Old World felt such gratitude to this important man that theybuilt this monument to honor what he had done for them in protecting them frombeliefs they knew would have imperiled their society. The threat was no triflingmatter.“Kaja-Rang watches over this boundary even in death. From the world of the deadhe sent me a warning that the seal had been breached.”Richard waited in the tense silence until all the men looked back at him beforehe quietly concluded.“Kaja-Rang banished your ancestors not only because they couldn’t see magic,but, more importantly, because they couldn’t see evil.”In restless disquiet, the men glanced about at their companions. “But what youcall evil is just a way of expressing an inner pain,” one of them said, more asa plea than as an argument.“That’s right,” another told Richard. “Saying someone is evil is prejudicedthinking. It’s a way of belittling someone already in pain for some reason. Suchpeople must be embraced and taught to shed their fears of their fellow man andthen they will not strike out in violent ways.”Richard swept his glare across all the watching faces. He pointed up at thestatue.“Kaja-Rang feared you because you are dangerous to everyone—not because you areungifted, but because you embrace evil with your teachings. In so doing, intrying to be kind, to be unselfish, in trying to be nonjudgmental, you allowevil to become far more powerful than it otherwise would. You refuse to seeevil, and so you welcome it among you. You allow it to exist. You give it powerover you. You are a people who have welcomed death and refused to denounce it.“You are an empire naked to the shadow of evil.”After a moment of thick silence, one of the older men finally spoke up. “Thisbelief in evil, as you call it, is a very intolerant attitude and is far toosimplistic a judgment. It’s nothing less than an unfair condemnation of yourfellow man. None of us, not even you, can judge another.”Kahlan knew that Richard had a great deal of patience, but very littletolerance. He had been very patient with these men; she could see that he hadreached the end of his tolerance. She half expected him to draw his sword.He walked among the men, his raptor glare moving individuals back as he passed.“Your people think of themselves as enlightened, as above violence. You are notenlightened; you are merely slaves awaiting a master, victims awaiting killers.They have finally come for you.”Richard snatched up the small bag and stood before the last man who had spoken.“Open your hand.”The man glanced to those at his sides. Finally, he held his hand out, palm up.Richard reached into the bag and then placed a small finger, its flesh witheredand stained with dried blood, in the man’s hand.The man obviously didn’t want the little finger sitting in the palm of his hand,but after he looked up into Richard’s withering glower, he said nothing and madeno attempt to rid himself of the gory trophy.Richard walked among the men, ordering random men to open their hands. Kahlanrecognized the ones he selected as men who had objected to the things he wastrying to do to help them. He placed a finger in each upturned hand until thebag was empty.“What you hold in your hand is the result of evil,” Richard said. “You men allknow the truth of it. You all knew evil was loose in your land. You all wantedthat to change. You all wanted to be rid of evil. You all wanted to live. Youall wanted your loved ones to live.“You all had hoped to do it without having to face the truth.“I have tried to explain things to you so that you could understand the truenature of the battle we all face.”Richard straightened the baldric over his shoulder.“I am done explaining.“You wanted me brought to your land. You have accomplished your goal. Now, youare going to decide if you will follow through with what you know to be right.”Richard again stood before them, his back straight, his chin held high, hisscabbard gleaming in the gloomy light, his black tunic trimmed in gold standingout in sharp contrast against the fog-shrouded mountains behind him. He lookedlike nothing so much as the Lord Rahl. He was as commanding a figure as Kahlanhad ever seen.After Richard and Kahlan’s beginning so long ago, when they had struck out fromthose secluded woods of his, Richard had turned the world upside down. From thebeginning, he had always been at the heart of their struggle, and was now theruler of an empire—even if that endangered empire was largely a mystery to him,as was his gift.His cause, though, was crystal clear.Together, Kahlan and Richard were at the center of the storm of a war that hadengulfed their world. It had now engulfed these men and their land.Many people saw Richard as their only salvation. Richard seemed forever tryingto prove them wrong. For many others, though, he was the single most hated manalive. For them, Richard sought to give them cause; he told people that theirlife was their own. The Imperial Order wanted him dead for that more than forany blow he had dealt them.“This is the way things are going to be,” Richard finally said in a voice ofquiet authority.“You will surrender your land and your loyalty to the D’Haran Empire, or youwill be the subjects of the Imperial Order. Those are your only two choices.There are no others. Like it or not, you must choose. If you refuse to make achoice, events will decide for you and you will likely end up in the hands ofthe Imperial Order. Make no mistake, they are evil hands.“With the Order, if you are not murdered, you will be slaves and treated assuch. I think you know very well what that entails. Your lives will have novalue to them except as slaves, called upon to help them spread their evil.“As part of the D’Haran Empire, your lives will be your own. I will expect youto rise up and live them as the individuals you are, not as some speck of dirtin a pit of filth you have dug yourselves into.“The seal to your hiding place, to the Bandakaran Empire, has failed. I don’tknow how to repair it, nor would I if I could. There is no more Empire ofBandakar.“There is no way to allow you to be who you were and to protect you. Maybe theOrder can be thrown out of your land, but they cannot be effortlessly kept out,for it is their ideas that have come to destroy you.“So choose. Slaves or free men. Life as either will not be easy. I think youknow what life as slaves will be like. As free men you will have to struggle,work, and think, but you will have the rewards that brings, and those rewardswill be yours and no one else’s.“Freedom must be won, but then it has to be guarded lest those like the Ordercome again to enslave those wishing for someone else to do their thinking.“I am the Lord Rahl. I intend to go get the antidote to the poison you’ve givenme. If you men choose to be part of this struggle, to rid yourselves and yourloved ones of evil, then I will help you.“If you choose not to stand with us, then you may go back and let the Order dowith you what they will, or you can run. If you run, you may survive for a time,as you have been doing, but, because that is not the way you wish to live, youwill die as frightened animals, never having lived what life has to offer.“So choose, but if you choose to stand with me against evil, then you will haveto relinquish your self-imposed blindness and open your eyes to look around atlife. You will have to see the reality of the world around you. There is goodand bad in the world. You will have to use your minds to judge which is which sothat you can seek the good and reject the bad.“If you choose to stand with me, I will do my best to answer any honest questionand try to teach you how to triumph against the men of the Order and those likethem. But I will not suffer your mindless teachings that are nothing more than acalculated rejection of life.“Take a look at the bloody fingers you or your friends hold. Look at what wasdone to children by evil men. You should hate such men who would do this. If youdon’t, or can’t, then you have no business being with those of us who embracelife.“I want each of you to think about those children, about their terror, theirpain, their wish not to be hurt. Think of what it was like for them to be aloneand in the hands of evil men. You should rightfully hate the men who would dosuch things. Hold tight to that righteous hatred, for that is the hatred ofevil.“I intend to recover the antidote so that I can live. In the process, I alsointend to kill as many of those evil men as I can. If I go alone, I may succeedin getting the antidote, but alone I will not succeed in liberating your homesfrom the Imperial Order.“If you choose to go with me, to help me in this struggle, we may have a chance.“I don’t know what I face there, so I can’t honestly tell you that we have agood chance. I can only tell you that if you don’t help me, then there is likelyno chance.”Richard held up a finger. “Make no mistake. If you choose to join us and we takeup this struggle, some of us will probably die. If we do not, all of us willdie, not necessarily in body, but in spirit. Under such rule as the Order hasshown you, no one lives, even though their bodies might for a time endure themisery of life as slaves. Under the Order, every soul withers and dies.”The men were silent as Richard paused to meet their gazes. Most could not lookaway, while some seemed shamed and so they stared at the ground.“If you choose to side with me in this struggle,” Richard said with deliberatecare, “you will be called upon to kill men of the Order, evil men. If you oncethought that I enjoyed killing, let me assure you that you are very wrong. Ihate it. I do it to defend life. I would never expect you to relish killing. Itis a necessity to do it, not to enjoy doing it. I expect you to relish life anddo what is necessary to preserve it.”Richard picked up one of the items, lying off to the side, that they had madewhile waiting for Tom and Owen to bring the men up into the pass. It looked likelittle more than a stout stick. It was in fact made of oak limbs. It was roundedat the back to fit the hand, narrow at a point in the middle, and pointed at theother end.“You men don’t have weapons. While we waited for you to arrive, we’ve madesome.” He waggled his fingers, requesting Tom to come forward. “The men of theOrder won’t recognize these as weapons, at first, anyway. If questioned, youshould tell them that they’re used to make holes in the ground to plant crops.”With his left hand, Richard seized Tom’s shirt at his shoulder, to hold him, anddemonstrated the weapon’s use by slowly showing how it would be thrust upward,toward a man’s middle just under his ribs, to stab him. Some faces among the mentwisted with revulsion.“This can most easily be driven up into a man’s soft part, up in under hisribs,” Richard told them. “Once you thrust it in, give it a quick sideways twistto break it off at the narrow point. That way, the man won’t be able to pull itout. With such a thing lodged in his insides, if he can even stand, he won’twant to be running after you or trying to wrestle you. You’ll be better able toget away.”One of the men lifted a hand. “But a piece of wood like that will be wet andwouldn’t break. Many of the wood fibers will just bend over, leaving the handleend attached.”Richard tossed the weapon to the man. After he caught it, he said, “Look at themiddle, where it’s cut to a narrow neck. You’ll see that it’s been held over afire and dried for that very reason. Notice the pointed end, too. You’ll seethat it’s been cut and split into four sections, with the points bent open, likea flower bud, so that as it’s thrust into an enemy it has a good chance to breakopen, the four sides going in different directions to do more damage. With thatone thrust, it will be like stabbing him four times.“When you snap it off in him, he won’t be able to fight you because every movehe makes will wrench those long oak splinters through his vulnerable insides. Ifit doesn’t hit something vital and kill him immediately, he’s certainly likelyto die within the day. While he’s dying, he’ll be screaming in agony and fear. Iwant such evil men to know that the pain and death they inflict on others willbe coming for them. That fear will cause them to begin to think of running. Itwill make them lose sleep, wear them down, so that when we do get to themthey’ll be easier to kill.”Richard picked up another item. “This is a small crossbow.” He held it high forthe men to see as he pointed out its features.”As you can see, the bowstring islocked back on this nut. A stout bolt is laid in this groove, here. Pulling thislever rotates the nut, releasing the string and firing the bolt. It isn’t fancy,and you men aren’t experienced at using such weapons, but at close, range youdon’t have to be all that good a shot. “I’ve started a number of crossbows andhave a whole pile of stocks and parts made. With the items that you men broughtback, we can finish making them. They’re rather crude, and, as I said, theywon’t be good at much of a distance, but they are small and you can hide themunder a cloak. No matter how big and strong the enemy is, the smallest of youcan kill him. Not even his chain-mail armor will protect against such a weaponfired at close range. I can promise you that they will be very deadly.”Richard showed the men hardwood clubs they would stud with nails. Such weaponscould also be concealed. He showed them a simple cord with a small wooden handleat each end that was used to strangle a man from behind when stealth wasparamount.“As we take these men, we’ll be able to get other weapons—knives, axes, maces,swords.”“But, Lord Rahl,” Owen said, looking beside himself with worry, “even if we wereto agree to join you in this, we are not fighters. These men of the Order arebrutes who are experienced at such things. We would stand no chance againstthem.”The others voiced their worried agreement. Richard shook his head as he held uphis hands for them to be quiet.“Look at those fingers you hold. Ask yourselves what chance those little girlshad against such men. Ask yourselves what chance your mothers, your sisters,your wives, your daughters have. You are the only hope for these people. You arethe only hope for yourselves.“Most likely, you men would not stand a chance against such men, either. But Ihave no intention of fighting them as you’re thinking. That’s a good way to getkilled.” Richard pointed at one of the younger men. “What is it we want? Thereason you came to get me?”The man looked confused. “To get rid of the men of the Order?”“Yes,” Richard said. “That’s right. You want to be rid of murderers. The lastthing you want is to fight them.”The man gestured at the weapons Richard had shown them. “But these things...”“These men are murderers. Our task is to execute them. We want to avoid fights.If we fight them, we risk being hurt or killed. I am not saying that we won’thave to fight them, but that isn’t our goal. There will be times when there maybe limited numbers of them and we can be sure that with surprise we can takethem out before a fight has a chance to erupt. Keep in mind that these men havebeen conditioned to none of your people putting up any resistance. We hope tokill them before it occurs to them to draw a weapon.“But if we don’t have to face them, all the better. Our goal is to kill them. Tokill every one of them we can. Kill them when they sleep, when they are lookingthe other way, when they are eating, when they are talking, when they aredrinking, when they are out for a stroll.“They are evil. We must kill them, not fight them.”Owen threw up his hands. “But, Lord Rahl, if we were to start killing them, theywould take revenge on all the people they have.”Richard watched the men, waiting until he was sure everyone was payingattention.“You have just recognized the reality that they are evil. You’re right; theywill probably start killing captives as a way to convince you to surrender. Butthey are killing them now. Over time, if left to do as they will, the killingthey do will be on a vast scale. The faster we kill them, the sooner it’s overand the sooner the murder will stop. Some people will lose their lives becauseof what we do, but in doing it, we will free all the rest. If we do nothing,then we condemn those innocent people to the mercy of evil and evil grants nomercy. As I’ve said before, you can’t negotiate with evil. You must destroy it.”A man cleared his throat. “Lord Rahl, some of our people have sided with the menof the Order—believed their words. They will not want us to harm the men of theOrder.”Richard let out a heavy breath. He turned away for a moment, gazing off into thegloom, before turning his attention once more to the men. “I’ve had to killpeople I knew my whole life because they sided with the Order, much the same asyou are saying. They came to believe the men of the Imperial Order, and becauseI was opposed to the Order, they tried to kill me. It’s a terrible thing to haveto kill someone like that, someone you know. I believe the alternative isworse.”“The alternative?” the man asked.“Yes, letting them murder me. That’s the alternative: losing your life andlosing the cause for which you fight—the lives of your loved ones.” Richard’sexpression had turned grave. “If some of your people have joined with the Order,or work to protect them, then it may be that you could end up facing them. Itwill be their life, or yours. It could even mean the lives of the rest of us. Ifthey side with evil, then we must not allow them to stop us from eliminatingevil.“This is part of what you must weigh in your decision to join us or not. If youtake up this struggle, you must accept that you may have to kill people youknow. You must weigh this in the choice you will make.”The men no longer seemed shocked by his words. They looked solemn as theylistened.Kahlan saw small birds flitting past, looking to roost for the night. The sky,the icy fog, was getting darker. She scanned the sky, ever watchful forblack-tipped races. With the weather in the pass so dreadful, she doubted theywould be around. The fog, at least, was comforting for that reason.Richard looked exhausted. She knew how hard it was for her to breathe in thehigh, thin air, so it had to be far worse for him; she feared how, because ofthe poison, the thin air robbed Richard of his strength. They needed to be downout of the high pass.“I have told you the truth and all I can for now,” Richard told the men. “Yourfuture is now up to each of you.”He quietly asked Cara, Jennsen, and Tom to collect their things. He put a gentlehand on Kahlan’s back as he turned to the men and gestured down the hill.“We’re going back down to our camp in those woods. You men decide what you willdo. If you are with us, then come down there in the protection of the trees,where the races won’t be able to spot us when the weather lifts. We will need tofinish making the weapons you will carry.“If any of you choose not to join us, then you’re on your own. I plan not to behere, at this camp, for long. If the Order captures you they will likely tortureyou and I don’t want to be anywhere nearby when you scream your lungs out as youreveal where our camp was.”The forlorn men stood huddled in a group.“Lord Rahl,” Owen asked, “you mean we must choose now?”“I’ve told you all I can. How much longer can those being tortured, raped, andmurdered wait for you? If you wish to join us and be part of life, then comedown to our camp. If you choose not to be on our side, then I wish you luck. Butplease don’t try to follow us or I’ll have to kill you. I was once a woodsguide; I will know if any of you follow us.”One of the men, the one who had been the first to show Richard two pebbles tosay that he would reveal the location of the antidote, stepped forward, awayfrom the rest of the men.“Lord Rahl, my name is Anson.” Tears filled his blue eyes. “I wanted you to knowthat, to know who I am. I am Anson.”Richard nodded. “All right, Anson.”“Thank you for opening my eyes. I’ve always had some of the thoughts that youexplained. Now I understand why, and I understand the darkness kept over myeyes. I don’t want to live like that anymore. I don’t want to live by words thatdon’t mean anything and I don’t want the men of the Order to control my life.“My parents were murdered. I saw my father’s body hanging from a pole. He neverhurt anyone. He did nothing to deserve such a murder. My sister was taken. Iknow what those men are doing to her. I can’t sleep at night thinking about it,thinking about her terror.“I want to fight back. I want to kill these evil men. They’ve earned death. Iwant to grind them into dust, as you have said.“I choose to join with you and fight to gain my freedom. I want to live free. Iwant those I love to live free.”Kahlan was stunned to hear one of them say such things, especially without firstconsulting with the rest of the men. She had watched the eyes of the other menas Anson spoke. They all listened keenly to everything Anson said.Richard smiled as he placed a hand on the young man’s shoulder. “Welcome toD’Hara, Anson. Welcome home. We can use your help.” He pointed off at Cara andTom picking up the weapons they’d brought to show the men. “Why don’t you helpthem take those things back down to our camp.”Anson grinned his agreement. The soft-spoken young man had broad shoulders and athickly muscled neck. He was genial, but looked determined. If she were in theImperial Order, Kahlan would not want to see such a powerfully built man comingafter her.Anson eagerly tried to take the load from Cara’s arms. She wouldn’t relinquishit, so he picked up the rest of the things and followed Tom down the hill.Jennsen went along, too, pulling Betty behind by her rope, tugging for the firstfew steps because Betty wanted them to stay with Richard and Kahlan.The other men watched as Anson started down the hill with Cara, Tom, andJennsen. They then moved off to the side, away from the statue, while theywhispered among themselves, deciding what they would do.Richard glanced at the figure of Kaja-Rang before starting down the hill.Something seemed to catch his eye.“What’s the matter?” Kahlan asked.Richard pointed. “That writing. On the face of the pedestal, below his feet.”Kahlan knew there had been no writing in that spot before, and she was still toofar away to really tell if she could see writing in the flecked granite. Sheglanced back to see the others making their way down the hill, but insteadfollowed Richard when he started toward the statue. The men were still off tothe side, busily engaged in their discussion.She could see the spot on the face of the pedestal where the warning beacon hadshattered. The sand from inside the statue representing Richard was stillsplattered across the face of the pedestal.As they got closer, she could hardly believe what she was beginning to see. Itlooked as if the sand had eroded the stone to reveal lettering. The words hadnot been there before; that much she was sure of.Kahlan knew a number of languages, but she didn’t know this one. She recognizedit, though. It was High D’Haran.She hugged her arms to herself in the chill wind that had come up. The somberclouds stirred restlessly. She peered around at the imposing mountains, manyhidden by a dark shroud of fog. Swirling curtains of snow obscured other slopesin the distance. Through a small, brief opening in the wretched weather, thevalley she could see off through the pass offered the promise of green andwarmth.And the Imperial Order.Kahlan, close beside Richard, wished he would put a warm arm around her. Shewatched as he stared at the faint letters in the stone. He was being far tooquiet for her peace of mind.“Richard,” she whispered, leaning close to him, “what does it say?”Transfixed, he ran his fingers slowly, lightly over the letters, his lipssoundlessly pronouncing the High D’Haran words.“Wizard’s Eighth Rule,” Richard whispered in translation. “Taiga Vassternich.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46Following behind the messenger, Verna stepped aside as a tight pack of horsesraced by. Their bellies were caked with mud, their nostrils flared withexcitement. The eyes of the cavalry soldiers bent over their withers showed grimdetermination. With the constant level of activity of recent weeks, she had tomaintain a careful vigil whenever she stepped out of a tent lest she be run downby one thing or another. If it wasn’t horses charging through camp, it was menat a run.“Just up ahead,” the messenger said over his shoulder.Verna nodded to his young face as he glanced back. He was a polite young man.His curly blond hair and his mannerly behavior combined to remind her of Warren.She was defenseless against the wave of pain that cut through her with thememory of Warren being gone, at the emptiness of each day.She couldn’t remember this messenger’s name. There were so many young men; itwas hard to recall all their names. Though she tried her best, she couldn’t keeptrack of them. At least for a while now they hadn’t been dying at a terrifyingrate. As harsh as the winters were up in D’Hara, such weather had at least beena respite from the battles of the previous summer, from the constant fightingand dying. With summer again upon them, she didn’t think that the relative quietwas going to last much longer.For now the passes held against the ImperialOrder. In such narrow and confined places, the enemy’s weight of numbers didn’tmean so much. If only one man would fit through a narrow hole in a stone wall,it meant little that there were a hundred waiting behind him to go through, or athousand. Defending against one man, as it were, was not the impossible taskthat it was trying to fight the onslaught of Jagang’s entire force.When she heard the distant thunder, felt it rolling through the ground, sheglanced up at the sky. The sun had not made an appearance in two days. Shedidn’t like the looks of the clouds building against the slopes of themountains. It looked like they could be in for a nasty storm.The sound might not have been thunder. It was possible that it was magic theenemy hammered against the shields across the passes. Such battering would dothem no good, but it made for uneasy sleeping, so, if for no other reason, theykept at it.Some of the men and the officers passing in the other direction gave her a nodin greeting, or a smile, or a small wave. Verna didn’t see any Sisters of theLight. Many would be at the passes, tending shields, making sure none of theImperial Order soldiers could get through. Zedd had taught them to considerevery possibility, no matter how outlandish, and guard against it. Day and nightVerna ran every one of those places through her mind, trying to think if therewas anything they had overlooked, anything they had missed, that might allow theenemy forces to flood in upon them.If that happened, if they broke through, then there was nothing to stop theiradvance into D’Hara except the defending army, and the defending army was nomatch for the numbers on the other side of those mountains. She couldn’t thinkof any chink in their armor, but she worried constantly that there might be one.It seemed that the final battle might be on them at any moment. And where wasRichard?Prophecy said that he was vital in the battle to decide the future course ofmankind. With it appearing that they very well could be one battle from the endof it all, of freedom’s final spark, the Lord Rahl ran the very real risk ofmissing the moment of his greatest need. She could hardly believe that forcenturies Prophecy foretold of the one who would lead them, and when the timefinally arrives, he’s off somewhere else. Lot of good Prophecy was doing them.Verna knew Richard’s heart. She knew Kahlan’s heart. It wasn’t right to doubteither of them, but Verna was the one staring into the eyes of Jagang’s hordeand Richard was nowhere to be found.From what little information Verna had gleaned from Ann’s messages in thejourney book, there was trouble afoot. Verna could detect in Ann’s writings thatthe woman was greatly troubled by something. Whatever the cause, Ann and Nathanwere racing south, back down through the Old World. Ann avoided explaining,possibly not wanting to burden them with anything else, so Verna didn’t press.She had enough trouble conceiving of why Ann would have joined with the prophetrather than collaring him. Ann said only that a journey book was not a goodplace to explain such things.Despite the good work the man sometimes did, Verna considered Nathan dangerousin the extreme. A thunderstorm brought life-giving rain, but if you were the onestruck by its lightning, it didn’t do you much good. For Ann and Nathan to joinforces, as it were, must be indicative of the trouble they were all in.Verna had to remind herself that not everything was going against them, noteverything was hopeless and dismal. Jagang’s army had, after all, suffered astunning blow at the hands of Zedd and Adie, losing staggering numbers ofsoldiers in an instant and suffering vast numbers of casualties. As a result theImperial Order had turned away from Aydindril, leaving the Wizard’s Keepuntouched. Despite the dream walker’s covetous hands, the Keep remained out ofhis reach.Zedd and Adie had the defense of the Keep well in hand, so it was not alltrouble and strife; there were valuable assets on the side of the D’HaranEmpire. The Keep might yet prove decisive in helping to stop the Imperial Order.Verna missed that old wizard, his advice, his wisdom, though she would neveradmit it aloud. In that old man she could see where Richard got many of his bestqualities.Verna halted when she saw Rikka striding across in front of her. Verna snatchedthe Mord-Sith’s arm.“What is it, Prelate?” Rikka asked.“Have you heard what this is about?”Rikka gave her a blank look. “What what’s about?”The messenger stopped on the other side of the intersection of informal roads.Horses trotted past in both directions, one pulling a cart of water barrels.Fully armed men crossed on the side road. The encampment, one of several,surrounded by a defensive berm, had evolved into a city of sorts, with bywaysthrough its midst for men, horses, and wagons.“Something is going on,” Verna said.“Sorry, I haven’t heard anything.”“Are you busy?”“Nothing urgent.”Verna took a good grip on Rikka’s arm and started her walking. “General Meiffertsent for me. Maybe you’d best come along. That way if he wants you, too, wewon’t have to send someone looking for you.”Rikka shrugged. “Fine by me.” The Mord-Sith’s expression turned suspicious. “Doyou have any idea what’s wrong?”As Verna kept an eye on the messenger ahead of her weaving his way among men,tents, wagons, horses, and repair stations, she glanced over at Rikka. “Nothingthat I know of.” Verna’s expression contorted a bit as she tried to put herqueazy mood into words. “Did you ever wake up and just feel like there wassomething wrong, but you couldn’t explain why it seemed like it was going to bea bad day?”“If it’s to be a bad day, I see to that it’s someone else’s, and I’m the causeof it.”Verna smiled to herself. “Too bad you’re not gifted. You would make a goodSister of the Light.”“I would rather be Mord-Sith and be able to protect Lord Rahl.”The messenger stopped at the side of the camp road. “Back there, Prelate.General Meiffert said to bring you to that tent by the trees.”Verna thanked the young man and made her way across the soft ground, Rikka ather side. The tent was away from the main activity of the camp, in a quieterarea where officers often met with scouts just back from patrols. Verna’s mindraced, trying to imagine what news scouts could have brought back. There was noalarm, so the passes still held. If there was trouble, there would be a flurryof activity in the camp, but it seemed about the same as any other day.Guards saw Verna coming and ducked into the tent to announce her arrival. Almostimmediately, the general stepped out of the tent and rushed to meet her. Hisblue eyes reflected iron determination. The man’s face, though, was ashen.“I saw Rikka,” Verna explained as General Meiffert dipped his head in a hurriedgreeting. “I thought I ought to bring her just in case you needed her, too.”The tall, blond-headed D’Haran glanced briefly at Rikka. “Yes, that’s fine. Comein, please, both of you.”Verna snatched his sleeve. “What’s this about? What’s going on? Is somethingwrong?”The general’s eyes moved to Rikka and back to Verna. “We’ve had a message fromJagang.”Rikka leaned in, her voice taking on an edge. “How did a messenger from Jagangget through without someone killing them?”It was standard practice that no one came through for any reason. They didn’twant so much as a mouse making it through. There was no telling if it might besome kind of trick.“It was a small wagon, pulled by a single horse.” He tilted his head towardVerna. “The men thought the wagon was empty. Remembering your instructions, theylet it through.”Verna was somewhat surprised that Ann’s warning to let an empty wagon throughhad been so correct. “A wagon came of its own accord? An empty wagon droveitself in?”“Not exactly. The men who saw it thought it was empty. The horse appears to be aworkhorse that is used to walking roads, so it plodded along the road as it hadbeen trained.” General Meiffert pressed his lips together at the confusion onVerna’s face and then turned away from the tent. “Come on, and I’ll show you.”He led them to the third tent down the line and held the flap aside. Vernaducked in, followed by Rikka and the general. On a bench inside sat a youngnovice, Holly, with her arm around a very frightened-looking girl no more thanten years old.“I asked Holly to stay with her,” General Meiffert whispered. “I thought itmight make her less nervous than a soldier standing over her.”“Of course,” Verna said. “Very wise of you. She’s the one who brought themessage, then?”The young general nodded. “She was sitting in the back of the wagon, so the menseeing it coming at first thought it was empty.”Verna now understood why such a messenger got through. Soldiers weren’t nearlyso likely to kill a child, and the Sisters could test her to insure she was nothreat. Verna wondered if Zedd would have something to say about that; threatoften came in surprising packages. Verna approached the pair on the bench,smiling as she bent down.“I’m Verna. Are you all right, young lady?” The girl nodded. “Would you likesomething to eat?”Trembling slightly as her big brown eyes took in the people looking at her, shenodded again.“Prelate,” Holly said, “Valery already went to get her something.”“I see,” Verna said, holding the smile in place. She knelt down and gentlypatted the girl’s hands in her lap to reassure her. “Do you live around here?”The girl’s big brown eyes blinked, trying to judge the danger of the adultbefore her. She calmed just a little at Verna’s smile and kind touch. “A bit oftravel to the north, ma’am.”“And someone sent you to see us?”The big brown eyes filled with tears, but she didn’t cry. “My parents are backthere, down over the pass. The soldiers there have them. As guests, they said.Men came and took us to their army. We’ve had to stay there for the last fewweeks. Today they told me to take a letter over the pass to the people here.They said that if I did as I was told, they would let my mother and father andme go home.”Verna again patted the girl’s small hands. “I see. Well, that’s good of you tohelp your parents.”“I just want to go home.”“And you shall, child.” Verna straightened. “We’ll get you some food, dear, soyou have a full tummy before you go back to your parents.”The girl stood and curtsied. “Thank you for your kindness. May I go back after Ieat, then?”“Certainly,” Verna said. “I’ll just go read the letter you brought while youhave a nice meal, and then you can return to your parents.”As she sat back up on the bench, squirming her bottom back beside Holly, shecouldn’t help keeping a wary eye on the Mord-Sith.Trying not to show any apprehension, Verna smiled her good-bye to the girlbefore leading the others out of the tent. She couldn’t even imagine what Jagangwas up to.“What’s in the letter?” Verna asked as they hurried to the command tent.General Meiffert paused outside the tent, his thumb burnishing a brass button onhis coat as he met Verna’s gaze. “I’d just as soon you read it for yourself,Prelate. Some of it is plain enough. Some of it, well, some of it I’m hoping youcan explain to me.”Stepping into the tent, Verna saw Captain Zimmer waiting off to the side. Thesquare-jawed man was absent his usual infectious smile. The captain was incharge of the D’Haran special forces, a group of men whose job it was to go outand spend their days and nights sneaking around in enemy territory killing asmany of the enemy as possible. There seemed to be an endless supply. The captainseemed determined to use up the supply.The men in Captain Zimmer’s corps were very good at what they did. Theycollected strings of ears they took from the enemies they killed. Kahlan used toalways ask to see their collection whenever they returned. The captain and hismen dearly missed her.They all glanced up at a flash of lightning. The storm was getting closer. Aftera moment’s pause, the ground shook with the rolling rumble of thunder.General Meiffert retrieved a small folded paper from the table and handed it toVerna.“This is what the girl brought.”Looking briefly to the two men’s grim expressions, Verna unfolded the paper andread the neat script.I have Wizard Zorander and a sorceress named Adie. I now hold the Wizard’s Keepin Aydindril and all it contains. My Slide will soon present me with Lord Rahland the Mother Confessor.Your cause is lost. If you surrender now and open the passes, I will spare yourmen. If you do not, I will put every one of them to death.Signed, Jagang the Just.The arm holding the paper in her trembling fingers lowered.“Dear Creator,” Verna whispered. She felt dizzy.Rikka snatched the paper from her hand and stood facing away as she read it. Shecursed under her breath.“We have to go get him,” Rikka said. “We have to get Zedd and Adie away fromJagang.”Captain Zimmer shook his head. “There is no way we could accomplish such athing.”Rikka’s face went red with rage. “He’s saved my life before! Yours, too! We haveto get him out of there!”In contrast to Rikka’s anger, Verna spoke softly. “We all feel the same abouthim. Zedd has probably saved all of our lives more than once. Unfortunately,Jagang will do all the worse to him for it.”Rikka shook the message before their faces. “So we are just going to let him diethere? Let Jagang kill him? We sneak in, or something!”Captain Zimmer rested the heel of his hand on a long knife at his belt.“Mistress Rikka, if I told you that I had a man hidden somewhere in this camp,in one of the hundreds of thousands of tents, and no one would bother you or askyou any questions, but would allow you to freely go about a search, how long doyou think it would take you to find such a hidden man?”“But they won’t be in just any tent,” Rikka said. “Look at us, here. Thismessage came. Did it go to just any random tent in the whole camp? No, it wentto a place where such things are handled.”“I’ve been to the Imperial Order encampment too many times to count,” CaptainZimmer said as he cast his arm out toward the enemy over the mountains to thewest. “You can’t even imagine how big their camp is. They have millions of menthere.“Their encampment is a quagmire of cutthroats. It’s a place of chaos. Thatdisorder allows us to slip in, kill some of them, and get out fast. You don’twant to be there very long. They recognize outsiders, especially blondoutsiders.“Moreover, there are layers of different kinds of men. Most of the soldiers arelittle more than a mob of thugs that Jagang turns loose from time to time. Noneof them are allowed beyond a certain point within their own camp. The menguarding the areas with higher security are not nearly so stupid and lazy as thecommon soldiers.“The men in those protected areas aren’t as numerous as the common soldiers, butthey are trained professionals. They are alert, vigilant, and deadly. If youcould somehow manage to get through the sea of misfits to reach the island atthe core where the torture and command tents are, those professional soldierswould have you on the end of a pike in no time.“Even they are not all the same. The outer ring of this core, besides havingthese professionals guarding it, is where the Sisters are. They both live thereand use magic to watch for intruders. Beyond them are further rings, startingwith the elite guards, and then, finally, the emperor’s personal guards. Theseare men who have been fighting with Jagang for years. They kill anyone, even theelite guard officers, if they become at all suspicious of them. If they evenhear word of someone saying disparaging things about the emperor, they hunt themdown and have them tortured. After being tortured, if they live through it, theyare then put to death.“I’m not saying that my men and I would be unwilling to risk our lives trying toget Zedd out of there; I’m saying that we would be giving our lives up fornothing.”The mood in the tent could not have been more hopeless.The general gestured with the paper when Rikka handed it back. “Any idea what aSlide is, Prelate?”Verna met his blue-eyed gaze. “A soul stealer.”The general frowned. “A what?”“In the great war—three thousand years ago—the wizards of that time createdweapons out of people. Dream walkers, like Jagang, were one such weapon. Thebest way I can explain it to you is that a Slide is in some ways like a dreamwalker. A dream walker can enter a person’s mind and seize control of them. ASlide, I believe, is something like that, only he seizes your spirit, yoursoul.”Rikka made a face. “Why?”Verna lifted her hands in frustration. “I don’t really know. To control theirvictim, perhaps. Altering gifted people was an ancient practice. They sometimeschanged gifted people with magic to suit a specific purpose. With Sub-tractiveMagic they took away traits they didn’t want, and then they used Additive Magicto add to or enhance a trait they did want. What they created were monsters.“I’m not really well versed in the subject. When I became Prelate I had accessto books I had never seen before. That’s where I saw the reference to Slides.They were used to slip into another person’s being and steal the essence of whothey where—their spirit, their soul.“Altering people in such a way as to create these Slides is a long-dead art. I’mafraid that I don’t know a great deal about the subject. I do remember readingthat the ones called Slides were exceedingly dangerous.”“Long-dead art,” the general muttered. He looked like he was making a greateffort to restrain himself. “Those wizards of that time made such weapons asSlides, but how could Jagang? He’s no wizard. Could it be that he’s lying?”Verna thought about the question a moment. “He has gifted people under hisdirect control. Some are able to use underworld magic. As I said, I don’t know agreat deal about it, but I suppose it’s possible that he was able to do it.”“How?” the general demanded. “How could Jagang do such things? He’s not even awizard.”Verna clasped her hands before herself. “He has Sisters of the Light and theDark. In theory, I suppose he has what he needs. He is a man who studieshistory. I know from personal experience that he puts great value in books. Hehas an extensive and quite valuable collection. Nathan, the prophet, was veryconcerned about this very thing, and destroyed a number of important volumesbefore they could fall into Jagang’s possession.“Still, the emperor possesses a great many others—in fact, he has a hugecollection. Now that he has captured the Keep, he has access to importantlibraries. Those books are dangerous, or they wouldn’t have been sealed away inthe Wizard’s Keep in the first place.”“And now Jagang has control of them.” General Meiffert ran his fingers backthrough his hair. He gripped the back of the chair set before the small tableand leaned his weight on his arms. “Do you think he really has Zedd and Adie?”The question was a plea for some thread of hope. Verna swallowed as shecarefully considered the question. She answered in an honest voice, not wantingto be the founder of a false faith. Since she’d read the message from Jagang,she, herself, had been searching for that same thread of hope.“I don’t think he’s a man who would find any satisfaction in bragging aboutsomething he hadn’t actually accomplished. I think he must be telling us thetruth and wants to gloat over his accomplishment.”The general released his grip on the chair and turned as he considered Verna’swords. Finally, he asked a question worse yet.“Do you think he’s telling the truth that this Slide has Lord Rahl and theMother Confessor? Do you think this terrible creation, this Slide, will soondeliver the two of them to Jagang?”Verna wondered if this was the reason for Ann and Nathan’s headlong rush downthrough the Old World. Verna knew that Richard and Kahlan were down there,somewhere. There could be no more urgent reason for Ann and Nathan to racesouth. Was it possible that this Slide had already captured them, or capturedtheir souls? Verna’s heart sank. She wondered if Ann already knew that the Slidehad Richard, and that was why she wasn’t saying much about her mission.“I don’t know,” Verna finally answered.“I think Jagang just made a mistake,” Captain Zimmer said.Verna lifted an eyebrow. “Such as?”“He has just betrayed to us how much trouble he’s having with the passes. He’sjust told us how well our defenses are working and how desperate he is. If hedoesn’t get through this season, his whole army will have to sit out anotherwinter. He wants us to let him through.“D’Haran winters are hard, especially on men such as his, men not used to theconditions. I saw with my own eyes good indications of how many men he lost lastwinter. Hundreds of thousands of men died from disease.”“He has plenty of men,” General Meiffert said. “He can afford the losses. He hasa steady supply of new troops to replace the ones who died from the fevers andsickness last winter.”“So, you think the captain is wrong?” Verna asked.“No, I agree that Jagang would like very much to get it over with; I just don’tthink he cares how many of his men die. I think he’s eager to rule the world.Patient as he generally is, he sees the end at hand, the goal within his grasp.We’re the only thing standing in his way, keeping his prize from falling to him.His men, too, are impatient for the plunder.“His choice to split the New World first by driving up to Aydindril has left himclose to his goal, but in some ways, even more distant from it. If he can’t makeit through the passes, he may decide to pick up his army and make a long marchback south again, to the Kern River valley, to where he can then come over andup into D’Hara. Once his army takes to the open ground down south, there’s noway for us to stop them.“If he can’t break through the passes now, it means a long march and a longdelay, but he will still have us in the end. He would rather have us now and iswilling to offer the lives of our men to close a deal.”Verna stared off. “It’s a grave mistake to try to appease evil.”“I agree,” General Meiffert said. “Once we opened the passes, he would slaughterevery last man.”The mood in the tent was as gloomy as the sky outside.“I think we should send him back a letter,” Rikka said. “I think we should tellhim that we don’t believe him that he has Zedd and Adie. If he expects us tobelieve him, he should prove it; he should send us their heads.”Captain Zimmer smiled at the suggestion.The general tapped a finger on the table as he thought it over. “If it’s as yousay, Prelate, and Jagang really does have them, then there’s nothing we can doabout it. He will kill them. After what Zedd did to Jagang’s force back inAydindril, to say nothing of all the havoc he caused the Imperial Order lastsummer when the Mother Confessor was with us, I know it won’t be an easy death,but he will kill them in the end.”“Then you agree that nothing else can be done,” Verna said.General Meiffert wiped a hand across his face. “I hate admitting it, but I’mafraid they’re lost. I don’t think we should give Jagang the satisfaction ofknowing how we truly feel about it.”Verna’s head spun at the thought of Zedd and Adie being put to torture, of thembeing in the hands of Jagang and his Sisters of the Dark. She quailed at thethought of the D’Haran forces losing Zedd. There simply was no one with hisexperience and knowledge. There was no one who could replace him.“We write Jagang a letter, then,” Verna said, “and tell Jagang we don’t believehe has Zedd and Adie.”“The only thing we can do,” Rikka said, “is to deny Jagang what he wants most.What he wants is for us to give up.”General Meiffert pulled out the chair at the table, inviting Verna to sit andwrite the letter. “If Jagang is angered by such a letter, he just might send ustheir heads. If he did, that would spare them terrible suffering. That’s theonly thing we can do for them—the best we could do for them.”Verna took stock of the grim faces and saw only resolve at what had to be done.She sat in the chair the general held for her, wiggled the stopper out of theink bottle, and then took a piece of paper from a small stack in a box to theside.She dipped the pen and stared at the paper for a moment, trying to decide how tophrase the letter. She tried to imagine what Kahlan would write. As it came toher, she bent over the table and began writing.I don’t believe you are competent enough to capture Wizard Zorander. If youwere, you would send us his head to prove it. Don’t bother me anymore with yourwhining for us to open the passes for you because you are too inept to do ityourself.Reading over Verna’s shoulder, Rikka said, “I like it.”Verna looked up at the others. “How should I sign it?”“What would make Jagang the most angry—or worried?” Captain Zimmer asked.Verna tapped the back of the pen against her chin as she thought. Then it cameto her. She put pen to paper.Signed, the Mother Confessor."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47Richard scanned the site off in the broad, green valley, watching for any signof troops. He looked over at Owen.“That’s Witherton?”Hands pressed against the rich forest floor at the crown of a low ridge, Owenpulled himself closer to the edge. He stretched his neck to see over the riseand finally nodded before pulling back.Richard had thought it would be bigger. “I don’t see any soldiers.”Owen crawled back away from the edge. In the shadowed cover among ferns and lowscrub, he stood and brushed the moist crumbles of leaves from his shirt andtrousers.“The men of the Order mostly stay inside the town. They have no interest inhelping to do the work. They eat our food and gamble with the things they havetaken from our people. When they do these things they are interested in littleelse.” His face heated to red. “At night, they used to collect some of ourwomen.” Since the reason was obvious enough, Owen didn’t put words to it. “Inthe daytime they sometimes come out to check on our people who work in thefields, or watch to see that they come back in at night.”If the soldiers had once camped outside the city walls, they no longer did.Apparently, they preferred the more comfortable accommodations within the town.They had learned that these people would offer no resistance; they could becowed and controlled by words alone. The men of the Imperial Order were safesleeping among them.The wall around Witherton blocked much of Richard’s view of the place. Otherthan through the open gates, there wasn’t much to see. The wall was constructedof upright posts not a great deal taller than the height of a man. The posts, avariety of sizes no bigger around than a hand-width, were bound tightlytogether, top and bottom, with rope. The wavy wall snaked around the town,leaned in or out in places. There was no bulwark, or even a trench before thewall. Other than keeping out grazing deer or maybe a roaming bear, the wallscertainly didn’t look strong enough to withstand an attack from the ImperialOrder soldiers.The soldiers had no doubt made a point of using the gate into the town forreasons other than the strength of the wall. Opening the gates for soldiers ofthe Imperial Order had been a symbolic sign of submission.Broad swaths of the valley were clear of trees, leaving fields of grain to growalongside row crops in communal gardens. Tree limbs knitted into fencing kept incows. There, the wild grasses were chewed low. Chickens roamed freely nearcoops. A few sheep grazed on the coarse grass.The smells of rich soil, wildflowers, and grasses carried on a light breeze intothe woods where Richard watched. It was a great relief to have finally descendedfrom the pass. It had been getting difficult to breathe in the thin air up onthe high slopes. It was considerably warmer, too, down out of the lofty mountainpass, although he still felt cold.Richard checked the sweep of open valley one last time and then he and Owen madetheir way back into the dense tangle of woods toward where the others waited.The trees were mostly hardwoods, maple and oak, along with patches of birch, butthere were also stands of towering evergreens. Birds chirped from the densefoliage. A squirrel up on the limb of a pine chattered at them as they passed.The deep shade below the thick forest crown was interrupted only occasionally bymottled sunlight.Some of the men, swatting at bugs, stood in a rush when Richard led Owen intothe secluded forest opening. Richard was glad to stand in the warmth of sunlightslanting in at a low angle.It appeared that the open area in the dense woods had been created when a hugeold maple had been hit by lightning. The maple split and fell in two directions,taking other trees down with it. Kahlan hopped down off her seat on the trunk ofthe fallen monarch. Betty, her tail wagging in a blur, greeted Richard, eagerlylooking for attention, or a treat. Richard scratched behind her ears, the goat’sfavorite form of attention.More of the men came into the open from behind upturned roots that had beenturned silver by years of exposure to the elements. A crop of spruce, none morethan chest high, had sprung up in the sunny spot created when the old maple haddied such a sudden and violent death. Spread among Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, andTom were the rest of the men—his army.Back up in the pass, Ansons saying that he wanted to help rid his people of theImperial Order soldiers seemed to have galvanized the rest of the men, and thebalance had finally tipped. Once it had, a lifetime of darkness and doubt gaveway to a hunger to live in the light of truth. The men all declared, in abreathtaking moment of determination, that they wanted to join with Richard tobe part of the D’Haran Empire and fight the soldiers of the Imperial Order togain their freedom.They had all decided that the men of the Order were evil and deserved death,even if they themselves had to do the killing.When Tom glanced down to see Betty going back to browsing on weeds, Richardnoticed that the man’s brow was beaded with sweat. Cara fanned herself with ahandful of big leaves from a mountain maple. Richard was about to ask them howthey could be sweating when it was such a cool day when he realized that it wasthe poison making him cold. With icy dread, he recalled how the last time he hadgotten cold, the poison had nearly killed him that awful night.Anson and another man, John, took off their packs. They were the ones planningto slip in among the field-workers returning to town at nightfall. Once theysneaked into town, the two men planned to recover the antidote.“I think I’d better go with you,” Richard said to Anson. “John, why don’t youwait here with the others.”John looked surprised. “If you wish, Lord Rahl, but there is no need for you togo.”It wasn’t supposed to be a foray that would result in any violence, only therecovery of the antidote. The attack on the Imperial Order soldiers was to beafter the antidote had been safely recovered and they had assessed thesituation, the number of men, and the layout.“John is right,” Cara said. “They can do it.”Richard was having difficulty breathing. He had to make an effort not to cough.“I know. I just think I had better have a look myself.”Cara and Kahlan cast sidelong glances at each other.“But if you go in there with Anson,” Jennsen said, “you can’t take your sword.”“I’m not going to start a war. I just want to get a good look around at theplace.”Kahlan stepped closer. “The two of them can scout the town and give you areport. You can rest—they will only be gone a few hours.”“I know, but I don’t think I want to wait that long.”By the way she appraised his eyes, he thought she must be able to see how muchpain he was in. She didn’t argue the point further but instead nodded heragreement.Richard pulled the baldric and sword belt off over his head. He slipped it allover Kahlan’s head, laying the baldric across her shoulder.“Here. I pronounce you Seeker of Truth.”She accepted the sword and the honor by planting her fists on her hips. “Nowdon’t you go starting anything while you’re in there. That’s not the plan. Youand Anson will be alone. You wait until we’re all together.”“I know. I just need to get the antidote and then we’ll be back in no time.”Beside getting the antidote, Richard wanted to see the enemy forces, how theywere placed, and the layout of the town. Having the men draw a map in the dirtwas one thing, seeing it for himself was another; these men didn’t know how toevaluate threat points.One of the men took off his light coat, something a number of the men wore, andheld it out to Richard. “Here, Lord Rahl, wear this. It will make you look morelike one of us.”With a nod of thanks, Richard drew the coat on. He had changed out of his warwizard’s outfit into traveling clothes, so he didn’t think he would look out ofplace with the way the men from the town of Witherton looked. The man was nearlyRichard’s size, so the coat fit well enough. It also hid his belt knife.Jennsen shook her head. “I don’t know, Richard. You just don’t look like one ofthem. You still look like Lord Rahl.”“What are you talking about?” Richard held out his arms, looking down athimself. “What’s wrong with the way I look?”“Don’t stand up so straight,” she said.“Hunch your shoulders and hang your head a little,” Kahlan offered.Richard took their advice seriously; he hadn’t thought about it, but the men didtend to hunch a lot. He didn’t want to stand out. He had to blend in if hedidn’t want to raise the suspicions of the soldiers. He bent over a little.“How’s that?”Jennsen screwed up her mouth. “Not much different.”“But I’m bending down.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said in a soft voice as she gave him a meaningful look, “youremember how it was to walk behind Denna, when she held the chain to the collararound your neck. Make yourself like that.”Richard blinked at her. The mental image of his time as a captive of a Mord-Sithhit him like a slap. He pressed his lips tight, not saying anything, andconceded with a single nod. The memory of that forsaken time was depressingenough that he would have no trouble using it to fall into the role.“We had better be on our way,” Anson said. “Now that the sun is falling behindthe mountains, darkness comes quickly.” He hesitated, then spoke again. “LordRahl, the men of the Order will not know you—I mean they probably will notrealize you aren’t from our town. But our people do not carry weapons; if theysee that knife, they will know you are not from our town, and they will send upan alarm.”Richard lifted open the coat, looking at the knife. “You’re right.” He loosenedhis belt and removed the sheath holding the knife. He handed it to Cara forsafekeeping.Richard cupped a hand quickly to the side of Kahlan’s face as a way of sayinghis good-bye. She seized the hand in both of hers and pressed a quick kiss tothe backs of his fingers. Her hands looked so small and delicate holding his. Hesometimes kidded her that he didn’t see how she could possibly get anything donewith such small hands. Her answer was that her hands were a normal size andperfectly adequate, and his were simply outsized.The men all noticed Kahlan’s gesture of affection. Richard was not embarrassedthat they did. He wanted them to know that other people were the same as they inimportant, human ways. This was what they were fighting for—the chance to behuman, to love and cherish loved ones, to live their lives as they wanted.The light faded quickly as Richard and Anson made their way through the woodsrunning beside fields of wild grasses. Richard wanted to work around to wherethe forest came in closer to the men out weeding in the gardens and tending toanimals. With the nearby mountains to the west being so high, the sun vanishedbehind them earlier than what would normally be sunset, leaving the sky a swathof deep bluish green and the valley in an odd golden gloom.By the time he and Anson had reached the place where they would leave the woods,it was still a little too light, so they waited a short while until Richard feltthe murky light in the fields was dim enough to hide them. The town was somedistance away and since Richard couldn’t make out any men outside the gates, hereasoned that if soldiers were watching, then they couldn’t see him, either.As they moved quickly through the field of wild grass, staying low and out ofsight, Anson pointed. “There, those men going back to town, we should followthem.”Richard spoke quietly back over his shoulder. “All right, but don’t forget, wedon’t want to catch up with them or they might recognize you and make a fuss.Let them stay a good distance ahead of us.”When they reached the town walls, Richard saw that the gates were no more thantwo sections of the picket walls. A couple of posts no bigger than Richard’swrist had been tied sideways to stiffen two sections of wall and make them intogates. The ropes that tied the posts together served as the hinges. The sectionswere simply lifted and swung around to open or close them. It was far from asecure fortification.In the murky light of twilight, the two guards milling around just inside thegates and watching workers return couldn’t really see much of Richard and Anson.To the guards, they would appear to be two more workers. The Order understoodthe value of workers; they needed slaves to do the work so that the soldiersmight eat.Richard hunched his shoulders and hung his head as he walked. He rememberedthose terrible times as a captive when, wearing a collar, he walked behindDenna, devoid of all hope of ever again being free. Thinking of that inhumantime, he shuffled through the open gates. The guards didn’t pay him anyattention.Just as they were nearly past the guards, the closest one reached out andsnatched Anson’s sleeve, spinning him back around.“I want some eggs,” the young soldier said. “Give me some of the eggs youcollected.”Anson stood wide-eyed, not knowing what to do. It seemed ludicrous that thesetwo young men were allowed to serve their cause by being bullies. Richardstepped up beside Anson and spoke quickly, remembering to bow his head so thathe wouldn’t loom over the man.“We have no eggs, sir. We were weeding the bean fields. I’m sorry. We will bringyou eggs tomorrow, if it pleases you.”Richard glanced up just as the guard backhanded him, knocking him flat on hisback. He instantly took a firm grip on his anger. Wiping blood from his mouth,he decided to stay where he was.“He’s right,” Anson said, drawing the guard’s attention. “We were weeding beans.If you wish it, we will bring you some eggs tomorrow—as many as you want.”The guard grunted a curse at them and swaggered off, taking his companion withhim. They headed for a nearby long, low structure with a torch lashed to a poleoutside a low door. In the flickering light of that torch, Richard couldn’t makeout what the place was, but it appeared to be a building dug partway into theground so that the eaves were at eye level. After the two soldiers were a safedistance away, Anson offered Richard a hand to help him up. Richard didn’t thinkhe’d been hit that hard, but his head was spinning.As they started out, faces back in doorways and around dark corners peeked outto watch them. When Richard looked their way, the people ducked back in.“They know you are not from here,” Anson whispered.Richard didn’t trust that one of those people wouldn’t call the guards. “Let’shurry up and get what we came here for.”Anson nodded and hurriedly led Richard down a narrow street with what lookedlike little more than huts huddled together to each side. The single torchburning outside the long building where the soldiers had gone provided littlelight down the street. The town, at least what Richard could see of it in thedark, was a pretty shabby-looking place. In fact, he wouldn’t call it a town somuch as a village. Many of the structures appeared to be housing for livestock,not people. Only rarely were there any lights coming from any of the squatbuildings and the light he did see looked like it came from candles, not lamps.At the end of the street, Richard followed Anson through a small side door intoa larger building. The cows inside mooed at the intrusion. Sheep rustled intheir pens. A few goats in other pens bleated. Richard and Anson paused to letthe animals settle down before making their way through the barn to a ladder atthe side. Richard followed Anson as he climbed quickly to a small hayloft.At the end of the loft, Anson reached up over a low rafter to where it tied intothe wall behind a cross brace. “Here it is,” he said as he grimaced, stretchinghis arm up into the hiding place.He came out with a small, square-sided bottle and handed it to Richard. “This isthe antidote. Hurry and drink it, and then let’s get out of here.”The large door banged open. Even though it was dark outside, the torch down thestreet provided just enough light to silhouette the broad shape of a manstanding in the doorway. By his demeanor, he had to be a soldier.Richard pulled the stopper from the bottle. The antidote had the slight aroma ofcinnamon. He quickly downed it, hardly noticing its sweet, spicy taste. He nevertook his eyes off the man in the doorway.“Who’s in here?” the man bellowed.“Sir,” Richard called down, “I’m just getting some hay for the livestock.”“In the dark? What are you up to? Get down here right now.”Richard put a hand against Anson’s chest and pushed him back into the darkness.“Yes, sir. I’m coming,” Richard called to the soldier as he hurried down theladder.At the bottom of the ladder, he turned and saw the man coming toward him.Richard reached for his knife under the coat he was wearing, only rememberingthen that he didn’t have his knife. The soldier was still silhouetted againstthe open barn door. Richard was in the darkness and the man probably wouldn’t beable to see him. He silently moved away from the ladder.As the soldier passed near him, Richard stepped in behind him and reached to hisside, seizing the knife sheathed behind the axe hanging on his belt. Richardgingerly drew the knife just as the man stopped and looked up the ladder to thehayloft.As he was looking up, Richard snatched a fistful of hair with one hand andreached around with the other, slicing deep through the soldier’s throat beforehe realized what was happening. Richard held the man tight as he struggled, awet gurgling the only sound coming from him. He reached back, franticallygrabbing at Richard for a moment before his movements lost their energy and hewent limp.“Anson,” Richard whispered up the ladder as he let the man slip to the ground,“come on. Let’s go.”Anson hurried down the ladder, coming to a halt as he reached the bottom andturned around to see the dark shape of the dead man sprawled on the ground.“What happened?”Richard looked up from his work at undoing the weapon belt around the deadweight of the soldier. “I killed him.”“Oh.”Richard handed the knife, in its sheath, to Anson. “Here you go. Now you have areal weapon—a long knife.”Richard rolled the dead soldier over to pull the belt the rest of the way outfrom under the man. As he tugged it free, he heard a noise and turned just intime to see another soldier running in toward them.Anson slammed the long knife hilt-deep into the man’s chest. The man staggeredback. Richard shot to his feet, bringing the weapon belt with him. The soldiergasped for breath as he clutched at the knife handle. He dropped heavily to hisknees. One hand clawed at the air above him as he swayed. Pulling a final gasp,he toppled to his side.Anson stood staring at the man lying in a heap, the knife jutting from hischest. He bent, then, and pulled his new knife free.“Are you all right?” Richard whispered when Anson stood.Anson nodded. “I recognize this man. We called him the weasel. He deserved todie.”Richard gently clapped Anson on the back of the shoulder. “You did well. Now,let’s get out of here.”As they made their way back up the street, Richard asked Anson to wait while hechecked down alleyways and between low buildings, searching for soldiers. As aguide, Richard often scouted at night. In the darkness, he was in his element.The town was a lot smaller than he had expected. It was also much less organizedthan he thought it would be, with no apparent order to where the simplestructures had been built. The streets through the haphazard town, if they couldbe called streets, were in most cases little more than footpaths betweenclusters of small, single-room buildings. He saw a few handcarts, but nothingmore elaborate. There was only one road through the town, leading back to thebarn where they had recovered the antidote and run into the two soldiers, thatwas wide enough to accommodate a wagon. His search didn’t turn up any patrollingsoldiers.“Do you know if all the men of the Order stay together?” Richard asked when hereturned to Anson, waiting in the shadows.“At night they go inside. They sleep in our place, by where we came in.”“You mean that low building where the first two soldiers went?”“That’s right. That’s where most people used to gather at night, but now the menof the Order use it for themselves.”Richard frowned at the man. “You mean you all slept together?”Anson sounded mildly surprised by the question. “Yes. We were together wheneverpossible. Many people had a house where they could work, eat, and keepbelongings, but they rarely slept in them. We usually all slept in the sleepinghouses where we gathered to talk about the day. Everyone wanted to be together.Sometimes people would sleep in another place, but mostly we sleep theretogether so we can all feel safe—much like we all slept together at night as wemade our way down out of the pass with the statue.”“And everyone just... lay down together?”Anson diverted his eyes. “Couples often slept apart from others by being withone another under a single blanket, but they were still together with ourpeople. In the dark, though, no one could see them ... together under ablanket.”Richard had trouble imagining such a way of life. “The whole town fit in thatsleeping building? There was enough room?”“No, there were too many of us to all sleep in one sleeping house. There aretwo.” Anson pointed. “There is another on the far side of the one you saw.”“Let’s go have a look, then.”They moved quickly back toward the town gates, such as they were, and toward thesleeping houses. The dark street was empty. Richard didn’t see anyone on thepaths between buildings. What people were left in the town had apparently goneto sleep or were afraid to come out in the darkness.A door in one of the small homes opened a crack, as if someone inside werepeering out. The door opened wider and a thin figure dashed out toward them.“Anson!” came the whispered voice.It was a boy, in his early teens. He fell to his knees and clutched Anson’s arm,kissing his hand in joy to see him.“Anson, I am so happy that you are home! We’ve missed you so much. We feared foryou—feared that you were murdered.”Anson grabbed the boy by his shirt and hauled him to his feet. “Bernie, I’m welland I’m happy to see you well, but you must go back in now. The men will seeyou. If they catch you outside...”“Oh, please, Anson, come sleep at our house. We’re so alone and afraid.”“Who?”“Just me and my grandfather, now. Please come in and be with us.”“I can’t right now. Maybe another time.”The boy peered up at Richard, then, and when he saw that he didn’t recognize himshrank back.“This is a friend of mine, Bernie—from another town.” Anson squatted down besidethe boy. “Please, Bernie, I will return, but you must go back inside and staythere tonight. Don’t come out. We fear there might be trouble. Stay inside. Tellyour grandfather my words, will you now?”Bernie finally agreed and ran back into the dark doorway. Richard was eager toget out of the town before anyone else came out to pay their respects. If he andAnson weren’t careful, they would end up attracting the attention of thesoldiers.They moved quickly the rest of the way up the street, using buildings for cover.Pressing up against the side of one at the head of the street, Richard peeredaround the corner at the squat daub-and-wattle sleeping house where the guardshad gone. The door was open, letting soft light spill out across the ground.“In there?” Richard whispered. “You all slept in there?”“Yes. That is one of the sleeping houses, and beyond it the other one.”Richard thought about it for a moment. “What did you sleep on?”“Hay. We put blankets over it, usually. We changed the hay often to keep itfresh, but these men do not bother. They sleep like animals in dusty old hay.”Richard looked out through the open gates at the fields. He looked back at thesleeping house.“And now the soldiers all sleep in there?”“Yes. They took the place from us. They said it was to be their barracks. Nowour people—the ones still alive—must sleep wherever they can.”Richard made Anson stay put while he slipped through the shadows, out of thelight of the torch, to survey the area beyond the first building. The secondlong structure also had soldiers inside laughing and talking. There were moremen than were needed to guard such a small place, but Witherton was the gatewayinto Bandakar—and the gateway out.“Come on,” Richard said as he came up beside Anson, “let’s get back to theothers. I have an idea.”As they made their way to the gate, Richard looked up, as he often did, to checkthe starry sky for any sign of black-tipped races. He saw instead that the poleto each side of the gate held a body hanging by the ankles. When Anson saw them,he paused, held frozen by the horror of the sight.Richard laid a hand on the man’s shoulder and leaned close. “Are you all right?”Anson shook his head. “No. But I will be better when the men who come to us anddo such things are dead.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 48Richard didn’t know if the antidote was supposed to make him feel better, but ifit was, it hadn’t yet done its work. As they crept through the pitch-blackfields, his chest hurt with every breath he took. He paused and closed his eyesbriefly against the pain of the headache caused by his gift. He wanted nothingmore than to lie down, but there was no time for that. Everyone started out oncemore when he did, quietly making their way through the fields outside ofWitherton.It felt good, at least, to have his sword back, even if he dreaded the thoughtof having to draw it for fear of finding its magic was no longer there for him.Once they recovered the other two bottles of the antidote and he was rid of thepoison, then maybe they could make it back to Nicci so that she could help himdeal with his gift.He tried not to worry if a sorceress could help a wizard once his gift had goneout of control, as his had. Nicci had vast experience. As soon as he reachedher, she could help him. Even if she couldn’t help him, he felt confident thatshe would at least know what he had to do in order to get the help he needed.After all, she was once a Sister of the Light; the purpose of the Sisters of theLight had been to help those with the gift to learn to control it.“I think I see the outer wall,” Kahlan said in a quiet voice.“Yes, that’s the place.” Richard pointed. “There’s the gate. See it?”“I think so,” she whispered back.It was a dark night, with no moon. While the others were having difficultyseeing much of anything as they made their way through the dark, Richard wasglad for the conditions. The starlight was enough for him to see by, but hedidn’t think it was enough to give the soldiers any help in seeing them.As they crept closer, the sleeping house came into view through the open gate.The torch still burned outside the door to the building where the soldiersslept. Richard signaled everyone to gather around close. They all crouched low.He grabbed the shoulder of Anson’s shirt and pulled him up closer yet, then didthe same with Owen.Both now carried battle-axes. Anson also carried the knife he’d earned. The restof the men carried the weapons they had helped finish making.When Richard and Anson had returned to the forest clearing, Anson had told thewaiting men everything that had happened. When he said that he killed the mancalled the weasel, Richard held his breath, not sure exactly how the men wouldreact to hearing that one of their own had actually killed a man. There was abrief moment of astonished silence, and then spontaneous joy at theaccomplishment.Every man wanted to shake Anson’s hand to congratulate him, to tell him howproud they were. At that moment, any lingering doubts Richard harbored hadvanished. He had allowed the men to celebrate briefly while he waited for thenight to darken, and then they had started making their way through the fields.This was the night that Witherton gained its freedom.Richard looked around at all the dark shapes. “All right, now, remember all thethings we’ve told you. You must stay quiet and hold the gates steady while Ansonand Owen cut the rope where they hinge. Be careful not to let the gates fallonce the ropes are cut.”In the dim starlight Richard could just make out the men nodding to hisinstructions. Richard carefully checked the sky, looking for any sign ofblack-tipped races. He didn’t see any. It had been a long time since they’d seenany races.It seemed that the trick of taking to the forests just before they changed theirexpected route and being careful to stay out of sight from the sky had worked.It was possible that they had succeeded in slipping out from under Nicholas theSlide’s surveillance. If they really had escaped his observation, then hewouldn’t know where to begin looking for them.Richard briefly squeezed Kahlan’s hand and then started for the opening in thetown wall. Cara crouched close at his other side. Tom was bringing up the rear,along with Jennsen, making sure there were no surprises from behind.They had left Betty not only tied up, but confined to a makeshift pen to be sureshe didn’t follow after them and give them away at the wrong moment. The goathad been unusually distraught to be left behind, but with lives at stake theycouldn’t risk Jennsen’s goat causing trouble. She would be happy enough afterthey returned.When they reached the fields close to the town gates, Richard motioned foreveryone to get down and stay where they were. Along with Tom, Richard moved upto the gates, taking cover in the shadow of the wall. There was a soldier justinside the gate, pacing slowly in his lonely nighttime sentry duty. He wasn’tbeing very careful, or he would not be doing such duty in the light of thetorch.As the soldier turned to walk away from them, Tom slipped up behind the man andswiftly silenced him. As Tom dragged the dead man through the gates to hide himin the darkness outside the wall, Richard moved in through the gates, staying inthe shadows and away from the torch burning outside the sleeping house. The doorto the sleeping house stood open, but no light or sound came from inside. Thislate, the men were bound to be asleep.He moved past the first long building to the second, and there came upon anotherguard. Quickly, silently, Richard seized the man and cut his throat, holding himtight as he struggled. When he finally went limp, Richard laid him in thedarkness at the head of the second sleeping house, around the corner from thetorchlight.In the distance, the men had already swarmed over the gates, holding them upwhile Anson and Owen worked quickly at cutting the ropes that acted as hinges.In moments, both sections of gate were freed. Richard could hear the soft gruntsof effort as the heavy gates were manhandled around by the two gangs of men.Jennsen handed Richard his bow, the string already strung. She handed him one ofthe special arrows, holding the rest at the ready for him. Kahlan slipped up tothe torch on the pole outside the first building and lit several small torches,handing each of them off to the men. She kept one for herself.Richard nocked the arrow and then glanced around at the faces seeming to floatbefore him in the wavering torchlight. In answer to the unspoken question, theyall nodded that they were ready. He checked the men balancing the two gates andsaw their nod. The bow in one hand, with his fist holding the arrow in place,Richard gave hand signals to the men, starting them moving.What had been a slow, careful approach from the woods into the town suddenlytransformed into a headlong rush.Richard held the head of the arrow nocked in his bow in the flame of the torchKahlan held out for him. As soon as it caught, he ran to the open door of thesleeping house, leaned into the darkness, and fired the arrow toward the back.As the blazing arrow flew the length of the building, it illuminated row uponrow of men sleeping on the bed of straw. The arrow landed at the far end,spilling flame across the straw. A few heads lifted at the confusing sight.Jennsen handed Richard another. He immediately drew string to cheek and thearrow shot toward the middle of the interior.As Richard pulled back from the doorway, two men with torches, dripping flamingdrops of pitch, heaved them just inside. They hissed as they flew through theair, landing amid the sleeping men, bouncing and tumbling through the straw,igniting a wall of flame.In a matter of only a few heartbeats since the attack started, the firstsleeping house was set afire from one end to the other. The largest blaze, bydesign, was the fire spread by the pitch-laden torches, at the end of thebuilding nearest the door. Confused cries came from inside, muted by the thickwalls. The sleeping soldiers scrambled to their feet.Richard checked that the men with the heavy gates were coming; then he ranaround the sleeping house to the second building. Jennsen, following closebehind, handed him an arrow, the flames around its head wrapped in oil-soakedcloth making a whooshing sound as she ran.One of his men pulled the torch from the stand outside the building where theguard Richard killed had been patrolling. Richard leaned in the doorway only tosee a big man charging at him out of the dark interior. Richard pressed his backagainst the doorjamb and kicked the man squarely in the chest, driving him back.Richard drew the bowstring back and shot the flaming arrow off into theinterior. As it lit the interior in its flight through the building, he couldsee that some of the men had been awakened and were getting up. Turning to takethe second flaming arrow from Jennsen, he saw smoke pouring up from the firstbuilding. As soon as he drew string to cheek and loosed the second arrow, heleaned away and men heaved the torches in.One torch fell back out of the doorway. It had bounced off the chest of a manrushing for the doorway to see what was happening. The pitch from the torchcaught his greasy beard afire. He let out a bloodcurdling scream. Richard kickedhim back inside. In an instant, men by the dozens were racing for the door, notonly to escape the burning building, but to meet the attack. Richard saw theflash of weapons being drawn.He sprang back from the doorway as the men carrying the heavy section of gaterushed in. They turned the gate sideways and rammed it in under the eaves, butbefore they could bring the bottom down to wedge it against the ground, theweight of bellowing men inside crashed into the section of gate and drove itback. The men carrying it fell back, the weight knocking them from their feet,the gate landing atop them.Suddenly, men were pouring from the doorway. Richard’s men were ready and fellon them, driving the wooden weapons into their soft underbellies and snappingthe handles off as man after man spilled out of the doorway. Standing to theside of the door, others used their maces to bash in the skulls of soldiers whoemerged. When one soldier came out with his sword raised, the man to the sideclubbed his arm as another rushed in and drove a wooden stake in up under hisribs. The more men who fell at the doorway, the more those trying to get outwere slowed and could be dispatched.The soldiers were so stunned to see these people fighting that in some casesthey fought back only ineffectually. As a soldier leaped over the bodies in thedoorway and lifted a sword, a man jumped on his back and seized his arm whileanother stabbed him. Another, crying orders, charged Jennsen, only to have thebolt of a crossbow fired into his face. A few soldiers escaped the burningbuilding and managed to slip past Richard’s men only to meet Cara’s Agiel. Theirscreams, worse than the cries of men on fire, briefly brought the gaze of everyman, from both sides of the battle.Fallen knives and swords were scooped up by the men of the town and turned onthe men from the Imperial Order. Richard fired an arrow into the center of thechest of a man emerging from the smoke that rolled out of the doorway. As he wasfalling, a second arrow felled the man behind him. As more men rushed out, theyfell over those piled around the doorway and were hacked to death withcommandeered axes or stabbed with confiscated swords. Since they could emergeonly one at a time, the soldiers couldn’t mount a coordinated attack, but thosewaiting could.As Richard’s men fought back those struggling to get out of the doorway of theburning building, other men rushed to help lift the gate so those under it couldget up and get control of it. Once the gate was lifted, the men swung it aroundand, with a cry of joint effort, ran with it toward the building. They drove thetop up under the eaves, first, but when they brought the bottom edge down, thebodies piled in the doorway prevented them from getting the bottom down so theycould wedge it in place.Richard called out orders. Some of his men rushed in and seized an arm or a legof a dead man and dragged the body aside so the others could finally bring thebottom of the gate down against the building to close off the opening.One man from inside squeezed through just before they had the gate in place. Theweight of the door pinned him against the building. Owen leaned in and with asword he’d picked up decisively stabbed the man through the throat.As men inside pounded at the gate covering the doorway and threw their weightagainst it, men on the outside piled around to push it down and hold it inplace. Other men fell to their knees and drove stakes into the ground to lockthe gate section in place, trapping the soldiers inside.Behind, streamers offlame leaked out from under the eaves of the first building and leaped up intothe night sky. The roof of the building ignited all at once, explosivelyengulfing the entire sleeping house in sparks and flames. Screams of men beingburned alive ripped the night.The waves of heat coming off the massive fire as the first building was consumedby the flames began to carry the heavy aroma of cooking meat. It remindedRichard that, for the killing he did, his gift demanded the balance of noteating meat. After all the killing of this night, since his gift was alreadyspinning out of control, he would have to be even more careful to avoid eatingany meat.His head was already hurting so much that he was having trouble focusing hisvision; he couldn’t afford to do anything that would further unbalance his gift.If he was not careful, the poison wouldn’t get the chance to be the first tokill him.Heavy black smoke billowed out from around the edges of the gate covering thedoorway of the second sleeping house. Screams and pleas came from inside. Themen of the town moved back, watching, as smoke began rolling up from under itseaves. The battle seemed to have ended as quickly as it had started.No one spoke as they stood in the harsh glare from the roaring fires. Flames atethrough the second building. With a loud whoosh it was engulfed in fire.The heat drove everyone back away from the two sleeping houses. As they movedback from the burning buildings, they encountered the rest of the people of thetown, all gathered in the shadows, watching in stunned silence.One of the older men took a step forward. “Speaker Owen, what is this? You havecommitted violence?”Owen stepped away from the men he was with to stand before the people of histown. He held an arm back, pointing toward Richard.“This is Lord Rahl, of the D’Haran Empire. I went in search of him to help us befree. We have much to tell you, but for now you must know that tonight, for thefirst time in many seasons, our town is free.“Yes, we have helped Lord Rahl to kill the evil men who have terrorized us. Wehave avenged the deaths of our loved ones. We will no longer be victims. We willbe free!”Standing silently, the people seemed able only to stare at him. Many lookedconfused. Some looked quietly jubilant, but most just looked stunned.The boy, Bernie, ran up to Anson, peering up in astonishment. “Anson, you andour other people have freed us? Truly?”“Yes.” He laid a hand on Bernie’s shoulder. “Our town is now free.”“Thank you.” He broke into a grin as he turned back to the town’s people. “Weare free of the murderers!”A sudden, spontaneous cheer rose into the night, drowning out the sound of thecrackling flames. The people rushed in around men they had not seen for months,touching them, hugging them, all asking questions of the men.Richard took Kahlan’s hand as he stepped back out of the way, joining Cara,Jennsen, and Tom. These people who were so against violence, who lived theirwhole life avoiding the truth of what their beliefs caused, were now basking inthe tearful joy of what it really meant to be freed from terror and violence.People slowly left their men to come and look at Richard and those standing withhim. He and Kahlan smiled at their obvious joy. They gathered in close beforehim, smiling, staring, as if Richard and those with him were some strangecreatures from afar.Bernie had attached himself to Anson’s arm. Others had the rest of the menfirmly embraced. One by one, though, the men started pulling away so that theycould stand behind Richard and Kahlan.“We are so happy that you are home, now,” people were telling the men. “We haveyou back, at last.”“Now we are all together again,” Bernie said.“We can’t stay,” Anson told him.Everyone in the crowd fell silent.Bernie, like many of the others, looked heartbroken. “What?”Buzzing, worried whispers spread through the crowd. Everyone was shaken by thenews that the men were not home to stay.Owen lifted a hand so they would listen. When they went silent, he explained.“The people of Bandakar are still under the cruel power of the men from theOrder. Just as you have become free tonight, so must the rest of the people ofBandakar be free.“Lord Rahl and his wife, the Mother Confessor, as well as his friend andprotector Cara, his sister Jennsen, and Tom, another friend and protector, haveall agreed to help us. They cannot do it alone. We must be part of it, for thisis our land, but more importantly, our people, our loved ones.”“Owen, you must not engage in violence,” an older man said. In view of theirsudden freedom, it was not an emphatic statement. It seemed to be an objectionmore out of obligation than anything else. “You have begun a cycle of violence.Such a thing is wrong.”“We will speak with you before we go, so that you might come to understand, aswe have, why we must do this to be truly free of violence and brutality. LordRahl has shown us that a cycle of violence is not the result of fighting backfor your own life, but is the result of a shrinking back from doing what isnecessary to crush those who would kill you. If you do as you must in duty toyourself and your loved ones, then you will eradicate the enemy so completelythat they can no longer do you any harm. Then, there is no cycle of violence,but an end to violence. Then, and only then, will true peace and freedom takeroot.”“Such actions can never accomplish anything but to start violence,” an old manobjected.“Look around,” Anson said. “The violence has not begun tonight, but ended.Violence has been crushed, as it should be, by crushing evil men who bring itupon us.”People nodded to one another, the heady relief of being suddenly freed from thegrip of the terror brought by the soldiers of the Imperial Order plainlyovercoming their objections. Joy had taken over from fear. The reality of havingtheir lives returned had opened their eyes.“But you must understand, as we have come to understand,” Owen said, “thatnothing can ever again be the way it once was. Those ways are in the past.”Richard noticed that the men weren’t slouching anymore. They stood with theirheads held high.“We have chosen to live,” Owen told his people. “In so doing, we have found truefreedom.”“I think we all have,” the old man in the crowd said."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49Zedd frowned with the effort of concentrating on what it was Sister Tahirah hadplaced on the table before him. He looked up at her, at the way her scowlpinched in around her humped nose.“Well?” she demanded.Zedd looked down, squinting at the thing before him. It looked like aleather-covered ball painted with faded blue and pink zigzagged lines all aroundit.What was it about it that seemed so familiar, yet so distant?He blinked, trying to better focus his eyes. His neck ached something fierce. Afather, hearing his young son in the next tent screaming in appalling agony, hadgrabbed Zedd by the hair and yanked him away from other parents who, pulling andpawing at him, made desperate demands of their own. Because of the torn musclesin his neck, it was painful to hold up his head. Compared to the torture he’dheard, though, it was nothing.The dim interior of the tent, lit by several lamps hanging from poles, felt asif it were detached from the ground and swirling around him. The foul placestank. The heat and humidity only made the smell, and the spinning, worse. Zeddfelt as if he might pass out.It had been so long since he’d slept that he couldn’t even remember the lasttime he had actually lain down. The only sleep he got was when he fell asleep inthe chair while Sister Tahirah was seeing to another object being unloaded fromthe wagons, or when she went to bed and the next Sister hadn’t yet arrived totake the next stint in their laborious cataloging of the items brought from theKeep. The catnaps he got were rarely longer than a few precious minutes at atime. The guards had orders not to allow him or Adie to lie down.At least the screams of the children had ended. At least, as long as hecooperated, those cries of pain had stopped. At least, as long as he went along,the parents had hope.A violent crack of pain suddenly hammered the side of his head, knocking himback. The chair toppled over, spilling him to the ground. With his arms boundbehind his back, he couldn’t do anything to break the fall and he hit hard.Zedd’s ears rang, not only from the fall, but with the aftermath of the blow ofthe Sister’s power delivered through the collar around his neck.He hated that wicked instrument of control. The Sisters were not shy aboutexercising that control. Because the collar locked him away from the use of hisown gift, he could not use his ability to defend himself. Instead, they used hispower against him.It took little or no provocation to send one of the Sisters into a fit ofviolence. Many of these women had once been kindly people devoting their livesto helping others. Jagang had enslaved them to a different cause. Now they didhis bidding. Though they might have once been gentle, they were now, he knew,trying to keep one step ahead of the discipline Jagang meted out to them. Thatdiscipline could be excruciating beyond endurance. The Sisters were expected toget results; Jagang would not be interested in the excuse that Zedd was beingdifficult.Zedd saw that Adie, too, had been knocked to the ground. Any punishment hereceived, she, too, endured. He felt more agony for her than for himself.Soldiers standing to the side moved in to right the chair and lift Zedd into it.With his arms bound behind his back, he couldn’t get up by himself. They sat himdown hard enough to drive a grunt from his lungs.“Well?” Sister Tahirah demanded. “What is it?”Zedd once again leaned in, staring down at the round object sitting by itself inthe center of the table. The faint blue and pink lines zigzagging all around itstirred deep feelings. He thought he should know this thing.“It’s ... it’s...”“It’s what!” Sister Tahirah slammed the book against the edge of the table,causing the round object to bounce up and roll a few inches before it came to astop closer to Zedd. She tucked the book under one arm as she leaned with theother on the table. She bent down toward him.“What is it? What does it do?”“I... I can’t remember.”“Would you like me to bring in some children,” the Sister said in the soft,sweet tone of a very bitter threat, “and show you their little faces before theyare taken to the tent next to us to be tortured?”“I’m so tired,” he said. “I’m trying to remember, but I’m so tired.”“Maybe while the children are screaming you would like to explain to theirparents that you are tired and just can’t quite seem to remember.”Children. Parents.Zedd suddenly remembered what the object was. Painful memories welled up. Hefelt a tear run down his cheek.“Dear spirits,” he whispered. “Where did you find this?”“What is it?”“Where did you find it?” Zedd repeated.Huffing impatiently, the Sister straightened. She opened the book and made anoisy show of turning heatedly through the pages. Finally, she stopped andtapped a finger in the open book.“It says here that it was found hidden in an open recess in the back of a blacksix-drawer chest in a corridor. There was a tapestry of three prancing whitehorses hanging above the chest.”She lowered the book. “Now, what is it?”Zedd swallowed. “A ball.”The Sister glared. “I know it’s a ball, you old fool. What is it for? What doesit do? What is its purpose?”Staring at the ball no bigger than his fist, Zedd remembered. “It’s a ball forchildren to play with. Its purpose is to bring them pleasure.”He remembered this ball, brightly colored back then, frequently bouncing downthe halls of the Wizard’s Keep, his daughter giggling and chasing after it. Hehad given it to her for doing well in her studies. Sometimes she would roll itdown the halls, urging it along with a switch, as if she were walking a pet. Herfavorite thing to do was to bounce it on the floor so that it would come upagainst a wall, after which it would bounce to another wall at an intersectionof stone hallways. In that way she made it bounce around a corner. She wouldwatch which hall it went down, left or right, then chase after it.One day she came to him in tears. He asked her to tell him her troubles. Shecrawled up in his lap and told him that her ball had gone somewhere and gottenitself lost. She wanted him to get it unlost. Zedd told her that if she looked,she would likely find it. She spent days despondently wandering the halls of theKeep, searching for it. She couldn’t find it.Finally, starting out one morning at sunrise, Zedd made the long walk down tothe city of Aydindril, to the market on Stentor Street. That was where he hadfirst come across a stand where they sold such toys and found the ball with thezigzagged lines. There he bought her another one—not just like it, but insteadone with pink and green stars. He deliberately chose a ball unlike the one she’dlost because he didn’t want her to think that wishes could be miraculouslyfulfilled, but he did want her to know that there were solutions that couldsolve problems.He remembered his daughter hugging his legs, thanking him for the new ball,telling him that he was the best father in all the world and that she would beever so much more careful with the new ball and never lose it. He had smiled ashe watched her put a little hand to her heart and recite a little-girl oath shehad invented on the spot.She treasured the ball with the pink and green stars. Since it was small, it wasone of the few things she had been able to take with her, after she was grown,when she and Zedd ran away to Westland, after Darken Rahl had raped her.When Richard had been young, he had played with that ball. Zedd remembered thesmile on his daughter’s face as she watched her own child play with thatprecious ball. Zedd could see in her beautiful eyes the memories of her ownchildhood as she watched Richard play. She had kept that ball her whole life,kept it until she died.This ball before him was the very same one his daughter had lost. It must havebounced up behind the chest and fallen into a recess in the back, where it hadbeen for all those long years.Zedd leaned forward, resting his forehead on the dusty ball surrounded withfaded blue and pink zigzagged lines, the ball which her little fingers had onceheld, and wept.Sister Tahirah seized a fistful of his hair and pulled him upright. “I don’tbelieve you’re telling me the truth. It’s an object of magic. I want to knowwhat it is and what it does.” Holding his head back, she glared into his eyes.“You know that I will not hesitate to do what is necessary to make youcooperate. His Excellency accepts no excuses for failure.”Zedd stared up at her, blinking away his tears. “It’s a ball, a toy. That’s allit is.”With a sneer, she released him. “The great and powerful Wizard Zorander.” Sheshook her head. “To think that we once feared you. You are a pathetic old man,your courage crushed by nothing more than the cry of a child.” She sighed. “Imust say, your reputation far exceeds the reality of your mettle.”The Sister scooped up the ball, turning it in her fingers as she inspected it.She huffed with disgust and tossed it aside, as if it were worthless. Zeddwatched the ball bounce and roll across the ground, coming to rest at the sideof the tent, against the bench where Adie sat. He looked up into her completelywhite eyes to see her watching him. Zedd turned away, waiting while the Sistermade notes in her book.“All right,” she finally said, “let’s go have a look at what they’ve unloaded inthe next tent.”The soldiers lifted him from the chair before he had a chance to try to do ithimself. His shoulders ached from his wrists being bound behind his back andfrom being lifted by his arms. Adie, too, was lifted to her feet. The booksnapped closed. Sister Tahirah’s wiry gray hair whipped around as she turned andled them out of the tent.Because the Sisters knew how dangerous items of magic from the Wizard’s Keepcould be, especially if the wrong combination of magic were to accidentally beallowed to combine or touch, they were cautious enough to bring the items, oneat a time, out of each individual, protected, shielded crate in the wagons. Zeddknew that there were things in the Keep that, by themselves, were not dangerous,but became so in the presence of other things that, by themselves, were also notdangerous. Sometimes it was only the combination of specific items that createda desired outcome.The Sisters had vast experience in the most esoteric things of magic and so theyat least understood the principles involved. They treated the cargo with thecare due such potentially hazardous goods. Once each object was uncrated, theyplaced it, by itself, in a tent to await examination. They took Zedd and Adiefrom tent to tent so that Zedd could identify each treasure, tell them what itwas, explain how it worked.They had been at it for days—how many, Zedd couldn’t remember. Despite his bestefforts, the endless days and nights had all begun to melt together in his mind.Zedd did all he could to stall, but there was only so much he could do. Thesewomen knew magic. They would not easily be fooled by any invented explanation.They had made very clear the consequences of any such deception.And, Zedd didn’t know how much they knew. At times they feigned ignorance ofsomething which they actually understood quite well, just to see if he wastelling the truth.Fortunately, as of yet, they had uncovered nothing that was extravagantlydangerous. Most of the items from the crates were simple-looking objects, butwere actually for a narrowly focused purpose—a pole that could remotely judgethe depth of water in a well, an iron decoration shaped like a fan of leavesthat prevented words from carrying beyond an open door where it was placed, alarge looking glass that revealed when a person entered another room. Whilepossibly useful to Emperor Jagang, such items were not all that valuable ordangerous; they were not going to help him to conquer and rule the world.What dangerous things the Sisters had uncrated and shown him were not reallyanything that a Sister couldn’t easily produce with a spell of her own. The mostdangerous item had been a constructed spell held within an ornate vase that,under specific conditions, such as when the vase was filled with water, createda temperature inversion that produced a blast of flame. Zedd was not betrayinghis cause or putting innocent lives at risk by revealing how the spell worked;any Sister worth her salt could reproduce the same effect. The purpose of thespell was protective; had it touched other stolen items, which, because theywere stolen, was a reversal of intended ownership that such a spell recognized,it would have ignited and destroyed those items, keeping them from covetoushands.None of the things so far discovered would do Jagang any real good. There werethings in the Keep, though, that could cause him harm. There were spells there,such as the constructed spell in the vase, that recognized the nature of theperson invoking their magic. Opened by the right person, such as Zedd, thosethings would do nothing, but, opened by a thief, they would create calamity.The Keep had thousands of rooms. The looting of it had netted the Imperial Ordera caravan of cargo wagons, but even that much hardly scratched the surface ofthe contents of the Keep.So far, Zedd had not seen any plums.He didn’t know if he would live to see any. The ride in the box after hiscapture had been brutal. He was still not recovered from the injuries inflictedafter meeting Jagang. Guards let the parents do what they would to convince Zeddand Adie to give in, but they wouldn’t allow the parents to get so carried awaythat they killed such prize prisoners. The parents had known that they weren’tto kill them, but in the heat of such raw passion, Zedd knew that such orderswere easy to forget. Zedd yearned for them to kill him and end it. The emperor,though, needed them alive, so the guards stood careful watch.After the first few horrifying hours of listening to children being subjected tocrippling torture, of being among their parents, who understandably demanded,quite forcefully, that he cooperate and tell the emperor what he wanted to know,Zedd had given in—not for the sake of the parents so much as to stop thosebrutal men from what they were doing to the children.He had figured that he had nothing to lose, really, by giving in. It stopped thetorture of the children for the time being. The Keep was vast; the things theybrought were only a tiny portion of them. Zedd reasoned that the caravan ofwagons probably didn’t hold anything of any real value to Jagang. It would takequite a while to catalog everything—it could be weeks more before they reachedthe last item. There was no purpose in allowing children to endure torture whenthere might not be anything useful for Zedd to betray to Jagang.Once, when they were alone while the Sister had gone to check on thepreparations in the next tent, Adie had asked what he would do if they presentedhim with something that would materially help Jagang win. Zedd hadn’t had achance to answer; the soldiers had come in then and taken the two of them to theSister in the next tent.He was hoping to drag out the process for as long as possible. He hadn’t countedon how they would keep at it day and night.It sometimes took quite a while for the Sisters to get out the next treasure andhave it ready. They were understandably cautious and took no chances. Thosestrange men without any trace of the gift who helped them might not be harmed ifany errant item of magic were to accidentally be set in motion, but everyoneelse certainly was vulnerable. Careful as they were, there were enough peopleworking at the preparations that Zedd and Adie were not allowed to sleep forlong before they were taken off to unravel the next puzzle for them.As he and Adie were dragged through the dark camp to the next tent, Zedd’s legswould hardly hold him. Seeing his daughter’s long-lost ball had sapped much ofhis remaining strength. He had never felt so old, so feeble. He feared that hiswill to go on was flagging.He didn’t know how much longer he could keep his sanity.He wasn’t at all sure that he actually still possessed it. The world seemed tohave turned into a crazy place. At times the whole thing seemed dreamlike. Whathe knew and what he didn’t know sometimes seemed to have all twisted togetherinto a knot of confusion.As he was marched through the dark camp, through the humid heat, he began toimagine that he saw things—mostly people—from his past. He began to doubt thathe really had seen that ball. He wondered if, like some of the other things hewas seeing, he had imagined it as well. Could it maybe have been a simple ball,and he only thought that it was the one his daughter had lost? Had he imaginedthe zigzagged colors around it? He was beginning to question himself over everylittle thing.Looking up at all the people in the crowded encampment, he thought he saw hislong-dead wife, Erilyn, in the faces of the women held nearby under guard. Theywere mothers, their worst nightmares ready to come to life if Zedd didn’tcooperate. His gaze passed over children clutching their mother’s skirts, ortheir father’s legs. They looked at him. his wavy white hair in disarray,probably thinking he was some crazy man. Maybe he was.The torches lit the sprawling camp with a kind of flickering light that madeeverything seem imaginary. The campfires, spread as far as he could see, lookedlike a star field lying across the ground, as if the world had turned upsidedown.“Wait,” the Sister said to the guards.Zedd was jerked to a halt as the Sister ducked inside the tent. Adie cried outas the man holding her wrenched her arm in the act of stopping her.Zedd swayed on his feet, wondering if he might pass out. The whole nighttimecamp wavered in his vision.As he looked at one of the girls held captive across the way, he stared,astonished, thinking he recognized her. Zedd looked up at the emperor’s eliteguard in the distance holding the child. Zedd blinked his blurred vision. Theguard, in leather and mail armor, with a belt full of weapons, looked like a manZedd used to know. Zedd turned away at the memory, only to see a Sister, makingher way among the tents not far away, who also looked like someone else he knew.He looked around at soldiers going about their business. Elite soldiers guardingthe emperor’s compound looked like men he thought he remembered.Zedd truly was terrified, then. He was sure that he was losing his mind. Hecouldn’t possibly be seeing the people he thought he saw.His mind was all he had. He didn’t want to be some babbling old man sitting bythe side of a road begging.He knew that people sometimes became irrational—lost their mind—when they gotold or were pressed past their endurance. He had known people who had snapped,who had gone insane, and saw things that weren’t really there. That’s what hewas doing. He was having visions of people from his past who weren’t reallythere. That was a sure sign of insanity—seeing your past come to life, thinkingyou were back with long-lost loved ones.His mind was the most important thing he had.Now he was losing that, too.He was losing his sanity."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50Nicholas heard an annoying noise back in another place.A disturbance of some sort, back where his body waited.He ignored it, watching the streets, watching the buildings go by. The sun hadjust set. People, wary people, moved past. Color. Sound. Activity.It was a dingy place, with buildings crowded close. Watch, watch. Alleyways weredark and narrow. Strangers stared. The street smelled. None of the buildingswere more than two stories; he was sure of it. Most were not even that.Again, he heard the noise back where his body waited. It was forceful, callinghis attention.He ignored the thump, thump, thump back somewhere else as he watched, trying tosee where they were going. What’s this? Watch, watch, watch. He thought he knew,but he wasn’t positive. Look, look. He wanted to be sure. He wanted to watch.He so enjoyed watching.More noise. Obnoxious, demanding, thumping noise.Nicholas felt his body around him as he slammed back to where it waited, sittingcross-legged on the wooden floor. He opened his eyes, blinking, trying to see inthe dim room. Slivers of dusk leaking in around the edges of the closed shutterslent only somber light to the room.He stood, wavering on his feet for a moment, not yet used to the strange feelingof being back in his own body. He started walking across the room, looking down,watching as he lifted each foot out ahead, shifted his weight with every step.He had been gone so much lately, day and night, that he was not used to havingto do such things on his own. He had been so often in another place, anotherbody, that he had difficulty adjusting to his own.Someone was banging on the door, yelling for him to open it. Nicholas wasfurious at the uninvited caller, at such a rude intrusion.With wobbly gait, he made his way to the door. It felt so confining being backin his own body. It moved in such an odd manner. He rolled his shoulders,resisting the urge to bend forward. He pulled and stretched his neck one way,then the other.It was bothersome to have to move himself about, to use his own muscles, to feelhimself breathe, to see, hear, smell, feel with his own senses.The door was barred by a heavy bolt to prevent unwelcome callers from enteringwhile he was off to other places. It wouldn’t do to have someone messing withhis body while he wasn’t there using it himself. Wouldn’t do at all.Someone pounding on the other side of the door bellowed his name and demanded tobe let in. Nicholas lifted the heavy bolt and heaved it over. He threw open thethick door.A young soldier stood just outside in the hall. A common, grubby soldier. Anobody.Nicholas stared in stunned fury at the lowly man who would just walk up thestairs to the room everyone knew was off-limits and pound on the forbidden door.Where was Najari’s flat, crooked nose when he needed it? Why wasn’t someoneguarding the door?A broken bone jutted from the back of the bloody fist the man had been hammeringagainst the door.Nicholas craned his neck, peering past the soldier out into the dimly lit hall,and saw the bodies of guards sprawled in pools of blood.Nicholas ran his fingernails back through his hair, shivering with delight atthe silken smooth feel of oils gliding against his palm. He rolled his shoulderswith the pleasure of the sensation.Opening his eyes, he fixed his gaze on the wide-eyed, common soldier whom he wasabout to kill. The man was dressed like many of the Imperial Order soldiers, atleast the better-outfitted soldiers, with leather chest armor, a sleeve ofprotective mail on his right arm, and a number of leather straps and beltsholding a variety of weapons from a short sword to a mace with a spiked metalhead to knives. Despite how deadly all his gear appeared, the expression on hisface was one of startled terror.Nicholas puzzled for a moment at what such a meaningless man could possibly haveto say that would be worth his life.“What is it, you insipid fool?”The man lifted an arm, then the hand, then a single finger in a manner thatreminded Nicholas of nothing so much as a puppet having its strings pulled. Thefinger tipped to one side, then the other, then back again, the way someonemight waggle a finger in admonition.“Ah, ah, ah.” The finger twitched side to side again. “Be polite. Be awfullypolite.”The soldier, his eyes wide, seemed surprised by his own haughty words. The voicesounded too deep—too mature—to belong to this young man.The voice, in fact, sounded dangerous in the extreme.“What is this?” Nicholas frowned at the soldier. “What’s this about?”The man started into the room, his legs moving in a most peculiar, stiltedmanner. In some ways it reminded Nicholas of how it must look when he used hisown legs after not being in his body for a long spell. He stepped aside as theman walked woodenly into the center of the dim room and turned. Blood drippedfrom the hand that had been pounding against the door, but the man, his eyesstill wide with fear, seemed not to notice what had to be painful injuries.His voice, though, came out anything but afraid. “Where are they, Nicholas?”Nicholas approached the man and cocked his head. “They?”“You promised them to me, Nicholas. I don’t like it when people don’t keep theirword. Where are they?”Nicholas drew his brow down even farther, leaned in even more. “Who?”“Richard Rahl and the Mother Confessor!” the soldier bellowed in unrestrainedrage.Nicholas backed away a few paces. He understood, now. He had heard the stories,heard that the man could do such things. Now he was seeing it for himself.This was Emperor Jagang, the dream walker himself.“Remarkable,” Nicholas drawled. He approached the soldier who was not a soldierand tapped a finger against the side of the man’s head. “That you in there, YourExcellency?” He tapped the man’s temple again. “That’s you, isn’t it,Excellency.”“Where are they, Nicholas?” It was as dangerous-sounding a question as Nicholashad ever heard.“I told you that you would have them, and you shall.”“I think you’re lying to me, Nicholas,” the voice growled. “I don’t think youhave them, as you promised you would.”Nicholas flipped a hand dismissively as he strolled off a few paces. “Oh, foo. Ihave them by a string.”“I think otherwise. I have reason to believe that they aren’t down here at all.I have reason to believe that the Mother Confessor herself is far to the north... with her army.”Nicholas frowned as he approached the man, leaning in close, peering into theeyes. “Do you completely lose your senses when you go cavorting into anotherman’s mind like that?”“Are you saying it isn’t so?”Nicholas was losing patience. “I was just watching them when you barged in hereto pester me. They were both there—Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor.”“Are you sure?” came the deep gravelly voice out of the young soldier’s mouth.Nicholas planted his fists on his hips. “Are you questioning me? How dare you! Iam Nicholas the Slide. I will not be questioned by anyone!”The soldier took an aggressive step forward.Nicholas held his ground and lifted a finger in warning. “If you want them, thenyou had better be awfully careful.”The soldier watched with wide eyes, but Nicholas could see more in those eyes:menace.“Talk, then, before I lose my patience.”Nicholas screwed his mouth up in annoyance. “Whoever told you that they were tothe north, that the Mother Confessor is with their army, either doesn’t knowwhat they’re talking about or is lying to you. I’ve kept a careful eye on them.”“But have you seen them lately?”The room was growing dark. Nicholas cast a hand toward the table, sending asmall spark of his gift into three candles there, setting their wicks to flame.“I told you, I was just watching them. They are in a city not far from here.Soon, they will be coming here, to me, and then I will have them. You don’t havelong to wait.”“What makes you think they’re coming to you?”“I know everything they do.” Nicholas held his arms aloft, his black robesslipping up to his elbows, gesturing expansively as he walked around the man,speaking of what he alone knew. “I watch them. I have seen them lying togetherat night, the Mother Confessor tenderly holding her husband in her arms, holdinghis head to her shoulder, comforting his terrible pain. It’s quite touching,actually.”“His pain?”“Yes, his pain. They are in Northwick right now, a city not far to the north ofhere. When they are finished there, if they live through their visit, then theywill be coming here, to me.”Jagang in the soldier looked around, taking in the freshly dead bodies lyingagainst the wall. His attention returned to Nicholas.“I asked, what makes you think so?”Nicholas looked over his shoulder and lifted an eyebrow at the emperor. “Well,you see, these fool people here—the pillars of Creation who so fascinateyou—have poisoned the poor Lord Rahl. They did it to try to insure his help ingetting rid of us.”“Poisoned him? Are you sure?”Nicholas smiled at the note of interest he detected in the emperor’s voice. “Oh,yes, quite sure. The poor man is in a great deal of pain. He needs an antidote.”“Then he will do what he must to get such an antidote. Richard Rahl is asurprisingly resourceful man.”Nicholas leaned his backside against the table and folded his arms. “He may beresourceful, but he’s now in a great deal of trouble. You see, he needs two moredoses of the antidote. One of them is in Northwick. That’s why he went there.”“You would be surprised at what that man can accomplish.” It would have beenimpossible to miss the bristling anger in the emperor’s voice. “You would be afool to underestimate him, Nicholas.”“Oh, but I never underestimate anyone, Excellency.” Nicholas smiled meaningfullyat the emperor watching him through another man’s eyes. “You see, I’m reasonablysure that Richard Rahl will retrieve the antidote in Northwick. In fact, I amcounting on it. We shall see. I was watching him as you came in, watching whatwould happen. You spoiled it.“But even if he obtains the antidote in Northwick, he will still need to get thelast dose. The antidote in Northwick alone will not spare his life.”“Where’s this other dose of his antidote?”Nicholas reached in a pocket and showed the emperor the square-sided bottle,along with a satisfied smile.“I have it.”The man with an emperor inside him smiled. “He may come to take it from you,Nicholas. But, more likely, he will have someone else make him more of theantidote so that he won’t even have to bother coming here.”“Oh, I don’t think so. You see, Excellency, I am quite thorough in my work. Thispoison that Lord Rahl took is complex, but not nearly as complex as theantidote. I know, because I had the only man who can make it tortured until hetold me what it was, told me all about it, told me its secrets. It contains awhole list of things I couldn’t even begin to recall.“I had the man killed, of course. Then I had the man who tortured the confessionout of him, tortured the antidote’s list of ingredients out of him, killed aswell. It wouldn’t do to have the resourceful Richard Rahl find either man andsomehow discover from them what was in the cure.“So, you see, Excellency, there is no one to make Lord Rahl any more of theantidote.” He held the bottle by the neck and wagged it before the man. “This isthe last dose. Lord Rahl’s last chance at life.”Through the eyes of a young soldier, Jagang watched the bottle Nicholas dangledbefore him. Any trace of humor had vanished.“Then Richard Rahl will come here and get it.”Nicholas pulled the cork. He took a whiff. The liquid inside carried the slightaroma of cinnamon.“You think so, Excellency?”Making a great show of it, Nicholas poured the liquid out onto the floor.As Emperor Jagang watched, Nicholas shook the bottle, making sure that the verylast drop fell out.“So, you see, Excellency, I have everything well in hand. Richard Rahl will notbe a problem. He will shortly die from the poison—if my men don’t manage to gethim before then. Either way, Richard Rahl is a dead man—just as you requested.”Nicholas bowed, as if at the conclusion of a grand performance before anappreciative audience.The man smiled again, a smile of strained forbearance.“And what of the Mother Confessor?” the emperor asked.Nicholas noted the clear undertone of restrained wrath. He was displeased not tobe roundly admired for his great accomplishment. After all, this Emperor Jaganghad not managed to capture the prize he so keenly sought. Nicholas smiledindulgently.“Well, the way I see it, Excellency, now that I’ve told you Lord Rahl is soon tojoin the ranks of the Keeper’s flock in the underworld, I have no assurance thatyou will keep your part of the bargain. I would like a commitment, on your part,before I give you the Mother Confessor.”“What makes you think you can capture her?”“Oh, I have that well in hand. Her own nature will deliver her into my hands.”“Her own nature?”“You let me worry about that, Excellency. All you need know is that I willdeliver the Mother Confessor to you, alive, as promised. You might say that LordRahl was free—a gift on my part—but you will have to pay the price if you are tohave the prize you covet: the Mother Confessor.”“And what would be your price?”Nicholas strolled around the man in the center of the room. He gestured with theempty antidote bottle at the surroundings. “Not my idea of the proper way tolive, if one has to live.”“So, you would have riches as a reward for doing your duty to the Creator, tothe Imperial Order, and to your emperor.”The way Nicholas saw it, he had done more than his duty that night in the woodswith the Sisters. Instead of saying so, he shrugged.“Well, I will let you have the rest of the world you have fought so hard togain. I only want D’Hara. An empire of worth for my own.”“You wish to rule the land of D’Hara?”Nicholas performed an exaggerated bow. “Under you, of course, Excellency.” Hestraightened. “I will rule as do you, through fear and terror, all in the nameof sacrificing for the betterment of mankind.”The dream walker watched through the eyes of the frightened soldier. The glintin those eyes was looking dangerous again.“You play a risky game, Slide, making such demands. Your life must mean littleto you.”Nicholas showed the emperor a smile that said he was tiring of trifling. “Hateto live, live to hate.”Finally, the emperor’s smile returned to the man’s lips.“D’Hara is your wish? It is done. Lord Rahl dead, and the Mother Confessordelivered to me, alive, and you will then have D’Hara to do with as you wish...as long as you pay homage to the rule of the Imperial Order.”Nicholas indulged Jagang with a more polite smile as he bowed his head. “But ofcourse.”“Then, when Richard Rahl is dead and I have the Mother Confessor, you shall benamed Emperor Nicholas of the land of D’Hara.”“You are a wise emperor.”This was the man who had prescribed Nicholas’s fate. This was the man who hadsent those Sisters to practice their vile craft, to sunder him with the terribleagony of destroying who he had been, to mother him in an agonizing secondCreation.They had decreed that he sacrifice himself to their cause. Nicholas had had nosay in it. Now, at least, for the small task of dealing with the petty enemiesof the Order, he would have his reward. He would have riches and power that hecould never have dared imagine before he had been reborn.They had destroyed him, but they had created him again more powerful than he hadever been.Now he was but one step away from being Emperor Nicholas.It had been a bitter road.Driven by angry need, by hatred, Nicholas thrust out his hand as he thrust hisown mind, like a hot dagger, into the mind of this man before him, into thespaces between his thoughts, into the marrow of his soul.He hungered to feel the slick heat of this other spirit slide into his own, thehot rush of taking him while Jagang was still within the man’s mind.But there was nothing there.In that spark of time, Jagang has already slipped away.The man crashed to the floor, dead.Nicholas—Emperor Nicholas—smiled at the game only just begun. He was beginningto wonder if he had set the price too low."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 51As they made their way up the street, Kahlan glanced to the small windows in thesurrounding buildings. In the gathering darkness, she doubted that the faces shesaw peering out of the windows could tell much about the people they saw out inthe street, but she pulled the hood of her cloak forward anyway.From the stories the men had told, it was not safe to be a woman in Bandakar, soKahlan, Jennsen, and Cara covered their identity to draw as little attention aspossible. Kahlan knew that people in fear for their own lives sometimes tried toshift attention away from themselves by offering another to the wolves. Worse,she also knew that there were bitter people devoted to the morbid ideal of theperpetual cannibalism of appeasement that they defined as peace.Richard slowed and checked the alley as they passed. One hand gripped the frontof his simple black cloak so that, if need be, he could lift it open and drawhis sword.Their men were spread out so as not to appear to be a mob moving throughNorthwick. Any gathering of crowds of men, except in markets, would no doubt bereported and swiftly draw the attention of the Imperial Order soldiers. They hadtimed their entry into the city to be just as night fell so as to better obscurethem, yet not so late that their presence on the streets would be suspicious.“There,” Owen said as they reached the corner, tilting his head to the right.“Down that way.”Richard looked back over his shoulder to make sure that everyone was still withhim, then turned down the narrow street. The buildings in the city were mostlysingle-story, but they were entering a district where a number had a secondstory, usually hanging several feet out over the street. Kahlan saw nothingtaller than the squat two-story buildings.The area they had turned in to reeked with the stench of sewage in a shallowditch to the side. The dusty streets of Northwick kept making her cough. Sheimagined that when it rained the place turned into a quagmire that stank evenworse. She saw that Richard made a great effort not to cough. It wasn’t alwayspossible. At least, when he did, he wasn’t coughing up blood.As they kept to the shadows in under the overhangs and eaves, Kahlan moved upcloser to him. Jennsen followed right behind. Anson, out ahead, scouted theirroute, looking for all the world as though he were by himself.Richard scanned the sky again. It was empty. They hadn’t seen any black-tippedraces since before they started up the pass into Bandakar. Kahlan and Cara wereglad not to see the huge black birds. Richard, though, seemed as troubled by notseeing them as he once was when he did.Cara hung back a bit, along with a half-dozen men. Tom and some others weremoving up a parallel street. Yet other men, who knew where they were headed,made their way through the city by a different route. Even though there wereless than fifty in their force, such numbers together could bring attention andtrouble.For now, they didn’t need trouble. They needed the antidote.“Where is the city center?” Kahlan asked Owen when she got close enough to beable to speak in a low voice.Owen swept his arm around, indicating the street they were on. “This is theplace. These shops are where the major commerce is, where people come. In theopen squares the people sometimes set up markets.”Kahlan saw a leather shop, a bakery, a place that sold cloth, but nothing moreelaborate. “This is the center of your great city? These post-and-beam buildingswith living quarters over the shops? This is your major business center?”“Yes,” Owen said, sounding half puzzled and half proud.Kahlan let out a sigh, but didn’t comment. Richard did.“This is the result of your advanced culture?” He gestured around at the shabbydaub-and-wattle buildings. “In close to three thousand years this is what yourgreat culture has accomplished? This is what you have managed to build?”Owen smiled. “Yes. It is magnificent, is it not?”Instead of answering the question, Richard said, “I thought you were inAltur’Rang.”“I was.”“Well, even that dingy place was far more advanced than this city of Northwick.”“It was? I am sorry, Lord Rahl, but I did not see much of Altur’Rang. I wasafraid to go far into such a place, and I did not stay for long.” Owen lookedback at Kahlan. “Do you mean to say that the city where you are from is moremagnificent than this one?”Kahlan blinked at the man. How could she possibly explain Aydindril, theWizard’s Keep, the Confessors’ Palace, the palaces on Kings Row, the People’sPalace, the marble and granite work, the soaring columns, the noble works ofart, or any of a hundred other places and sights to a man who thoughtstraw-and-dung buildings were an example of advanced culture? In the end, shedecided that this was not the time to try.“Owen, I hope that when we are all free of the oppression of the Imperial Order,Richard and I can show you and your people some other places in the worldoutside of Bandakar—show you some other centers of major commerce and art, someof what mankind elsewhere has accomplished.”Owen smiled. “I would like that, Mother Confessor. I would like it very much.”He stopped abruptly. “Oh, here is the place. It is down here.”A head-high wooden gate weathered to a brownish gray barred the alleyway beyondfrom sight. Richard checked both ways up the street, looking to see if anyonewas watching. The street was empty of everyone but their men. As he kept an eyeto the street, he pushed the gate open enough to allow Owen to slip through.Owen poked his head back out. “Come, it is clear.”Richard gave a hand signal to the men up at the corner. He put his arm aroundKahlan’s waist, holding her close as he squeezed with her through the gate intothe alley.The walls of the buildings on either side that came to the edge of the narrow,dusty alleyway had no windows. Some of the tightly packed structures thatweren’t set so far back had room for small backyards. As they moved cautiouslyup the alley, more of their men poured in through the gate at the far end.Chickens penned in one of the yards flapped their wings in fright at the peoplemoving close by.Jennsen pulled Betty along by her rope, keeping the goat close so she couldn’tcause any trouble. Betty remained quiet, seeming nervous in the strangesurroundings of a city. She wasn’t even wagging her tail as she peered up atRichard, Kahlan, and Jennsen for reassurance as they moved deeper into the heartof the jumble of buildings.Tom appeared at the other end of the alleyway, bringing another group of men.Richard signaled for them to spread out and wait at that end of the alleyway.Cara came up from behind, the hood of her cloak pulled up like Kahlan’s andJennsen’s. “I don’t like it.”“Good,” Richard whispered in answer.“Good?” Cara asked. “You think it’s good that I don’t like this place?”“Yes,” Richard said. “If you were ever happy and unconcerned, then I’d beworried.”Cara twisted her mouth with a reply she decided to keep to herself.“Here,” Owen said, grabbing Richard’s arm to stop him.Richard looked where Owen had pointed and then stared down at the man. “This isa palace.”Owen nodded. “One of them. We have several palaces. I told you, we are anadvanced culture.”Richard gave Kahlan a sidelong glance, but said nothing.From what Kahlan could see in the dim light, the backyard was dry dirt withclumps of grass growing here and there. A wooden stairway at the back of thebuilding led up to a small balcony with a door onto the second floor. As theypassed through a short gate into the yard, Kahlan saw that under the stairsthere was a stairwell going down.Owen looked around, then leaned close. “They are downstairs. This is where theyare hiding the Wise One.”Richard scanned the alley and the surrounding buildings. He rubbed hisfingertips across his brow.“And the antidote is in there?”Owen nodded. “Do you wish to wait while I go get it?”Richard shook his head. “We’ll go with you.”Kahlan held his arm, wishing she could do more to comfort his pain. The bestthing, though, was to get the antidote. The sooner they rid him of the poison,the sooner he could deal with solving the problem of the headaches caused by thegift.Some of their men waited nearby. She saw in their eyes their fear of being backin a city where the Imperial Order soldiers had control. She didn’t know whatshe and Richard could do to help them free their people of those troops, but sheintended to come up with something. Were it not for her desperate act, no matterhow unwitting, these people would not be suffering and dying at the hands of theOrder.The last gray glow of twilight made Richard’s eyes look as if they were made ofsteel. He pulled Jennsen close.“Why don’t you and Tom stay out here, with Betty, and stand watch. Stay underthe concealment of the stairs and balcony. If you see any soldiers, come let usknow.”Jennsen nodded. “I’ll let Betty graze on the grass. It would look more naturalif any patrols pass by.”“Just keep out of sight,” he said. “If soldiers see a young woman like you theywon’t hesitate to snatch you.”“I’ll keep her out of sight,” Tom said as he came up into the yard. He aimed athumb over his shoulder. “I have the men spread out so they won’t be sonoticeable.”Kahlan and Cara followed Richard and Owen toward the back of the building. Atthe stairwell down, Owen paused when Richard instead went to the door into thebuilding.“This way, Lord Rahl.”“I know. Wait while I check the hallway inside, make sure it’s clear.”“It is just empty rooms where people sometimes meet.”“I want to check it anyway. Cara, wait here with Kahlan.”Kahlan followed Richard to the door under the balcony. “I’m going with you.”Cara was right on Kahlan’s heels. “If you want to check the hall,” she toldRichard, “then you may come with us.”After a quick glance at Kahlan’s eyes, he didn’t argue with her. Looking atCara, he said, “Sometimes...”Cara flashed him a defiant smile. “You wouldn’t know what to do without me.”Kahlan saw that as he turned to the door, he couldn’t help but smile. Her heartlifted at seeing Richard’s smile, and then she felt a sudden pang of sorrow forCara, knowing how she must miss General Meiffert with their army far to thenorth in D’Hara. It wasn’t often that a Mord-Sith could come to care aboutsomeone the way Kahlan knew Cara cared about Benjamin. Cara wouldn’t come outand admit it, though, and had put first her wish to protect Richard and Kahlan.When she and Cara had been back with that army, Kahlan had promoted the thencaptain to general after a battle in which they had lost a number of officers.Captain Meiffert had risen to the occasion. Since then, he had held their armytogether. While she had complete faith in him, she also feared for hiswell-being, as Cara certainly must. Kahlan wondered if they would ever again seethe young general.Richard opened the door a crack and peered into the dark hallway beyond. It wasempty. Cara, Agiel in hand, pushed through and entered ahead of them, wanting tobe sure that it was safe. Kahlan followed Richard in. There were two doors toeach side. At the far end of the hall stood a door with a small window.“What’s out there?” Kahlan whispered as Richard looked through the window.“The street. I see some of our men.”On the way back, Richard checked rooms on one side while Cara checked the roomson the other. They were all empty, just as Owen had said.‘This might be a good place to hide our men,” Cara said.Richard nodded. “That’s what I was thinking. We could make strikes from here,from their midst, rather than risk being spotted coming in from the countrysideto attack.”Before they reached the back door, Richard suddenly stumbled, banging a shoulderagainst the wall before going to one knee. Kahlan and Cara grabbed for him,keeping him from falling on his face.“What’s wrong?” Cara whispered.He paused a moment, apparently waiting for a bout of pain to lift. His fingerssqueezing Kahlan’s arm hurt so much that her eyes were watering, but she madeherself remain silent.“I just... just got dizzy for a minute.” He panted, trying to recover hisbreath. “The dark hall, I guess.” His fingers released their viselike grip onKahlan’s arm.“The second state. That’s what Owen called it. He said that the second state ofthe poison was dizziness.”Richard looked up at her in the dark. “I’m all right. Let’s go get theantidote.”Owen, waiting in the shadows in the stairwell, started down when they reachedhim. At the bottom of the stairs he pushed the door open and looked in.“They are still here,” he said with relief. “The speakers are still here—Irecognize some of their voices. The Wise One must still be here with them. Theyhave not moved to another hiding place as I feared they might.”Owen was hoping the great speakers would agree to help rid their people of theImperial Order. After they had refused in the past, Kahlan didn’t think theywould agree this time, but then, Owen and his men had not at first agreed tofight. Owen believed that with the commitment of the men they had, and with whathad happened in his town, the assembly of speakers would see that there was achance of being free again and would be more open to hearing what had to bedone. Many of the men shared Owen’s confidence that help was at hand.More important than talking to the speakers, as far as Kahlan was concerned, wasthat this was where the second bottle of antidote was hidden. That came aboveall else. They had to secure the antidote.Whenever she thought about the possibility of Richard dying, it made her kneestremble.Just inside the small vestibule, Owen rapped gently on the door.Soft candlelight came from inside when the door pulled in a crack. A man peeredout for a moment; then his eyes went wide.“Owen?”Kahlan didn’t think the man intended to open the door. Before he had a chance tothink it over, Richard pushed the door open and moved into the room. The manhastily backed out of Richard’s way.Richard pulled Cara close. “Guard the door. None of these people comes outunless I say so.”Cara nodded and took up a position outside the door.“What is the meaning of this?” the man inside demanded of Owen as he gaped infear at Richard and Kahlan.“Great speaker, it is vital that we speak with all of you.”The place was aglow with candles. A dozen and a half men sitting around on rugssipping tea or leaning against pillows lining the walls abruptly fell silent.The stone walls were the outer foundation of the building. Stone piers marchedin two lines down the center of the large room, supporting fat beams far aboveRichard’s head. There was no decoration. It looked like little more than abasement made comfortable with rugs and pillows where the men congregated at oneend of the extensive room. Simple wooden tables against the walls at one endheld candles.Some of the men rose to their feet.“Owen,” one of them said in grave reprimand, “you have been banished. What areyou doing here?”“Honored speaker, we are well past petty issues of banishment.” Owen held out anintroductory hand. “These are friends of mine, from outside our land.”Kahlan grabbed Owen’s shirt at the shoulder and pulled his ear close as shegritted her teeth. “Antidote.”Owen nodded apologetically. The men, all older, watched indignantly as Owen wentto the corner at the far right. He grasped a stone near chest height, andtwisted it side to side. Richard reached in and helped Owen wiggle the stoneloose. When he finally pulled the heavy block out far enough to turn it to theside, Owen reached in behind and came out with the bottle. He wasted no time inhanding it to Richard.When Richard pulled the cork, Kahlan detected the slight aroma of cinnamon.Richard downed the contents.“You must leave,” one of the men growled. “You are not welcome here.”Owen didn’t back down. “We must see the Wise One.”“What!”“The men of the Order have invaded our land. They are torturing and murderingour people. Others they have taken away.”“Nothing can be done about this,” the red-faced speaker said. “We do as we mustso that our people can go on with their lives. We do as we must to avoidviolence.”“We have ended violence,” Owen told the man. “At least, in our town. We killedall the men of the Order who held us in the grip of fear, who raped and torturedand murdered our people. Our people there are now free of these men of theOrder. We must fight back and free the rest of our people. It is your duty asspeakers to do right by our people and not accommodate their enslavement.”The great speakers were apoplectic.“We will hear none of this!”“We will speak of it with the Wise One and see what he has to say.”“No! The Wise One will not see you! Never! You are all denied! You must allleave!”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 52One of the men came forward and angrily seized a fistful of Richard’s shirt,trying to push him out. “You are the cause of this! You are an outsider! Asavage! One of the unenlightened! You have brought profane ideas among ourpeople!” He did his best to shake Richard. “You have seduced our people toviolence!”Richard snatched the speaker’s wrist and wrenched his arm around, taking him tohis knees. The man cried out in pain. Without letting up, Richard leaned downtoward him.“We have risked our lives helping your people. Your people are not enlightened,but people the same as anyone else. You are going to listen to us. This night,the future of you and your people will be shaped.”Richard released the man with a shove, then went to the door and stuck his headout. “Cara, go ask Tom to help you get all the rest of the men to come downhere. I think they had better all be part of this.”As Cara ran to spread the word that Richard wanted all the men to gather intothe basement of the “palace,” he ordered the speakers back against the wall.“You have no right to do this,” one protested.“You are the representatives of the people of Bandakar. You are their leaders,”Richard told them. “The time has come for you to lead.”Behind, men started filing into the candlelit room. It wasn’t long before theywere all quietly assembled. The basement was large enough that Owen’s men tookup only part of the available space. Kahlan saw other, unfamiliar peoplestraggle in as well. Knowing the nature of these people, and since Cara wasletting them in, Kahlan didn’t think that they presented a threat.Richard gestured toward the quiet gathering watching the speakers. “These menfrom the town of Witherton have faced the truth of what is happening to theirpeople. They will no longer tolerate such brutality. They will no longer bevictims. They wish to be free.”One of the speakers, a man with a narrow, pointed chin, huffed dismissively.“Freedom can never work. It only gives people license to be self-centered. Athoughtful person, dedicated to the welfare of an enlightened mankind, mustreject the immoral concept of ‘freedom’ for what it is—selfish.”“That’s right,” another agreed. “Such simplistic beliefs can only provoke acycle of violence. This silly notion of ‘freedom’ leads to viewing things asblack or white. Such uninspired morals are obsolete. Individuals have no rightto judge others—especially in such authoritarian terms. What is needed iscompromise among all sides if there is to be peace.”“Compromise?” Richard asked. “A cycle of violence can only exist if you grantall people, including those who are evil, moral equivalence—if you say thateveryone, including those who decide to harm others, has an equal right toexist. That is what you do when you refuse to crush evil—you give moral standingand power to those who murder.“Devotion to compromise in such arenas is a sick idea that says you must cut offa finger, and then a leg, and then an arm to feed the monster living among you.Evil feeds on the good. If you kill the monster, the violence ends.“You have two choices before you. Choose to live in cringing fear, on yourknees, apologizing endlessly for wishing to be allowed to live as you struggleto appease an ever-expanding evil, or eliminate those who would harm you andfree yourselves to live your own lives—which means you must remain vigilant,ever ready to protect yourself.”One of the speakers, his eyes going wide, lifted an arm to point at Richard. “Iknow you, now. You are the one who was named in Prophecy. You are the one thatProphecy says will destroy us!”Whispers carried the accusation back through the crowd.Richard gazed back at his gathered men, then directed a withering glare at thespeakers. “I am Richard Rahl. You’re right; I am the one named in the Prophecygiven to your people so long ago. ‘Your destroyer will come and he will redeemyou.’“You’re right; this Prophecy is about me. But if I had not come along, it wouldeventually have been another who would have fulfilled those words, whether inanother year, or another thousand years, because these words are really aboutman’s honorable commitment to life.“Your people were banished because they refused to see the truth of the worldaround them. They chose to close their minds to reality. I have ended thatblindness.”Richard pointed back at the men with him. “When the truth was put before thesemen, they chose at last to open their eyes and see it. Now, the rest of yourpeople must meet the same challenge and make a choice as to how they will livetheir future.“ ‘Your destroyer will come and he will redeem you’ are words of the potentialfor a better future. They mean that your way of life, of impeding people frombeing their best, of restricting them from being all that they can be, of yourblind destructive ways that crush the spirit of each individual and over timehave caused so many of the best of your people to abandon you and go into theunknown beyond the boundary... is ended.“The men of the Order may have invaded your land, but, spiritually, they changenothing for you. Their violence is merely more apparent than your slowsuffocation of human potential. They offer the same unseeing lives you alreadylive, simply with a more manifest form of brutality.“I have brought the light of truth to some of your people, and in so doing Ihave destroyed their dark existence. The rest of your people must now decide ifthey will continue to cower in darkness or come into the light I have broughtamong you.“In bringing that light to your people, I have redeemed them.“I have shown them that they can soar on their own wings, aspire to reach forwhat they want for themselves. I have helped them take back their own lives.“Yes, I have destroyed the pretext that is the chains of their repression, butin so doing I have freed the nobility of their spirits.“That is the meaning of the Prophecy. It is up to each of you to rise to theoccasion and seek to triumph, or to hide in your self-imposed darkness withouttrying. There is no guarantee that if you try you will succeed. But withouttrying, you will assure failure and lives of dread for yourselves and yourchildren. The only difference will be that if you choose to live the same as youdo now, if you continue to appease evil, you will now know that it’s at theprice of your soul.”Richard turned away from the speakers. Before he closed his eyes to rub themwith his fingertips, Kahlan saw the terrible agony in those eyes. She wantednothing more than to get to the last antidote and then to do what they must torid him of the pain caused by his gift. She knew she was slowly losing him. Itseemed to her as if Richard were somewhere all alone, dangling from the edge ofa cliff, holding on by his fingertips, and his fingers were slowly slipping.Owen stepped forward. “Honored speakers, the time has come to hear from the WiseOne. If you do not think this crisis for our people warrants it, then nothingdoes. This is our future, our lives, that are at stake.“Bring out the Wise One. We will hear his words, if he truly is wise and worthyof our loyalty.”After noting the murmurs of agreement throughout the room, the speakers puttheir heads together, whispering among themselves to find a consensus that wouldtell them what to do. Finally, about half of them went off into a back room.One of the remaining speakers bowed his bald head. “We will see what the WiseOne has to say.” Kahlan had seen such contemptuous smiles often enough. Liftinghis pointed chin, he serenely clasped his hands before himself. “Before allthese people, we will put your blasphemous words to the Wise One and hear hiswisdom so that this matter may be put to rest.”Men emerged from the back room carrying posts draped with red cloth, notchedboards, and planks. Before the door into a back room, they began assembling asimple platform with posts at each corner and the heavy red drapes designed toenclose it. When the structure was finally completed, they placed a large pillowon the platform and then drew the drapes together. Other men carried over twotables, holding a number of candles, and placed one on each side of the drapedceremonial seat of wisdom. In short order, the speakers had created a simple butreverent setting.Kahlan knew a number of peoples in the Midlands who had magic and functioned inthe capacity she imagined that this Wise One did. They also usually hadattendants, such as these speakers. She also knew better than to underestimatesuch simple shamans and their link to the spirit world. There were those who hadvery real connections and very real power over their people.What she couldn’t imagine was how a people without any magic whatsoever couldhave such an agent of the spirits. If it was true that they did, and such aperson went against them, then all their work would have been for nothing.The speakers lined up to either side and then drew the curtains in the frontjust enough to see into the dim interior.There, sitting cross-legged on the pillow, was what appeared to be a boy inwhite robes, his hands resting prayerfully in his lap. He didn’t look very old,maybe eight or ten at most. A black scarf was tied around his head to cover hiseyes.“He’s just a boy,” Richard said.At the interruption, one of the speakers shot Richard a murderous glare. “Only achild is innocent enough of the contamination of life to be free to touch truewisdom. As we grow older we layer our experiences over our once perfect insight,but we remember those once unadulterated connections and so we realize how onlyin a child can wisdom itself be so pure.”Heads throughout the room bobbed knowingly.Richard cast a sidelong glance at Kahlan.One of the speakers knelt before the platform and bowed his head “Wise One, wemust ask your knowing guidance. Some of our wish to begin a war.”“War solves nothing,” the Wise One said in a pious voice.“Perhaps you would like to hear his reasons.”“There are no valid reasons for fighting. War is never a solution. War is anadmission of failure.”The people in the room shrank back, looking ill at ease to have brought suchcrude inquiries before the Wise One, inquiries he had no trouble untangling withsimple wisdom that laid bare obvious immorality.“Very wise. You have shown us wisdom in its true, simple perfection. All menwould do well to heed such truth.” The man bowed his head again. “We have triedto tell—”“Why are you wearing a blindfold?” Richard asked, cutting off the speakerkneeling before the platform.“I hear anger in your voice,” the Wise One said. “Nothing can be accomplisheduntil you shed your hate. If you search with your heart, you can find the goodin everyone.”Richard put a hand on Owen’s back, urging him ahead. He reached back into thecrowd of men and grabbed a pinch of Anson’s shirt, pulling him forward as well.The three men moved up to the Wise One’s platform. Only Richard stood tall. Withhis foot, he forced the kneeling speaker aside.“I asked why you’re wearing a blindfold,” Richard said.“Knowledge must be denied so as to make room for faith. It is only through faiththat real truth can be reached,” the Wise One said. “You must believe before youcan see.”“If you believe, without seeing the truth of what is,” Richard said, “thenyou’re simply being willfully blind, not wise. You must see, first, in order tolearn and understand.”The men around Kahlan looked uncomfortable that Richard was speaking in this wayto their Wise One.“Stop the hate, or you reap only hate.”“We were talking about knowledge. I haven’t asked you about hate.”The Wise One put his hands together prayerfully before himself, bowing his headslightly. “Wisdom is all around us, but our eyes blind us, our hearing deafensus, our minds think and so make us ignorant. Our senses only trick us; the worldcan tell us nothing of the nature of reality. To be at one with the greateressence of the true meaning of life, you must first stare blindly inward todiscover truth.”Richard folded his arms over his chest. “I have eyes, so I can’t see. I haveears, so I can’t hear. I have a mind, so I can’t know anything.”“The first step to wisdom is to accept that we are inadequate to know the natureof reality, and so nothing we think we know can be real.”“We must eat to live. How is one to track a deer in the woods so you can eat?Blindfold yourself? Stuff wax in your ears? Do it while you’re asleep so yourmind won’t contribute any thinking to the task at hand?”“We do not eat meat. It is wrong to harm animals just so that we might eat. Wehave no more right to live than an animal.”“So you eat only plants, eggs, cheese—things like that.”“Of course.”“How do you make cheese?”In the awkward silence, someone in the back of the room coughed.“I am the Wise One. I have not been called upon to do this work. Others makecheese for us to eat.”“I see; you don’t know how to make cheese for your dinner because no one hasever taught you. That’s perfect. Here you are, then, blindfolded and with aclear mind not all clogged up with troublesome knowledge on the subject. So, howdo you make cheese? Is it coming to you? Is the method of making cheese beingsent to you through your blindfolded divine introspection?”“Reality cannot be tested—”“Tell me how, if you were to wear a blindfold so you couldn’t see, put wax inyour ears so you couldn’t hear, and put on heavy mittens so you couldn’t feelanything, how you would even do something as simple as picking a radish to eat.Tell you what, you can leave the wax out of your ears, and not bother with themittens. Just leave that blindfold on and show me how you can pick a radish soyou have something to eat. I’ll even help you find the door, first; then you’reon your own. Come on, then. Off you go.”The Wise One licked his lips. “Well, I...”“If you deny yourself sight, hearing, touch ... how will you plant food tosustain your life, or how can you even hunt for berries and nuts? If nothing isreal, then how long until you starve to death while you wait for some innervoice of ‘truth’ to feed you?”One of the speakers rushed forward, trying to push Richard back. Richard shovedthe man so hard that it sat him on the ground. The speakers cowered back a fewpaces. Richard put one boot up on the platform, laid his arm across his knee,and leaned close to the Wise One.“Answer my questions, ‘Wise One.’ Tell me what staring blindly inwardly has sofar revealed to you about making cheese. Come on; let’s hear it.”“But... it’s not a fair question.”“Oh? A question regarding the pursuit of a value is not fair? Life requires allliving things to successfully pursue values if they are to continue to live. Abird dies if it can’t succeed at catching a worm. It’s basic. People are nodifferent.”“Stop the hate.”“You already have on a blindfold. Why don’t you plug your ears and hum a tune toyourself so you won’t be thinking about anything”—Richard leaned in and loweredhis voice dangerously—”and in your state of infinite wisdom, Wise One, just tryto guess what I’m about to do to you.”The boy squealed in fright and scooted back.Kahlan pushed her way between Richard and Anson and sat back on the platform.She put an arm around the terrified boy and pulled him close to comfort him. Hepressed himself into her sheltering protection.“Richard, you’re scaring the poor boy. Look at him. He’s shaking like a leaf.”Richard pulled the blindfold off the boy’s head. In confused dismay, he peeredfearfully up at Richard.“Why did you go to her?” Richard asked in a gentle tone.“Because, you were about to hurt me.”“You mean, then, that you were hoping she would protect you?”“Of course—you’re bigger than me.”Richard smiled. “Do you see what you’re saying? You were frightened and youhoped to be protected from danger. That wasn’t wrong of you. was it? To want tobe safe? To fear aggression? To seek help from someone you thought might be bigenough to stop the threat?”The boy looked confused. “No, I guess not.”“And what if I held a knife to you? Wouldn’t you want to have someone prevent mefrom cutting you? Wouldn’t you want to live?”The boy nodded. “Yes.”“That’s the value we’re talking about, here.”He frowned. “What do you mean?”“Life,” Richard said. “You want to live. That is noble. You don’t want someoneelse to take your life. That is just.“All creatures want to live. A rabbit will run if threatened; that’s why he hasstrong legs. He doesn’t need the strong legs or big ears to find and eat tendershoots. He has the big ears to listen for threats, and the strong legs toescape.“A buck will snort in warning if threatened. A snake may shake a rattle to wardoff threats. A wolf growls a warning. But if the danger keeps coming and theycan’t escape, a buck may trample it, the snake may strike, and the wolf mayattack. None of them will go looking for a fight, but they will protectthemselves.“Man is the only creature who willingly submits to the fangs of a predator. Onlyman, through continual indoctrination such as you’ve been given, will reject thevalues that sustain life. Yet, you instinctively did the right thing in going tomy wife.”“I did?”“Yes. Your ways couldn’t protect you, so you acted on the chance that she might.If I really were someone intent on harming you, she would have fought to stopme.”He looked up into Kahlan’s smile. “You would?”“Yes, I would. I, too, believe in the nobility of life.”He stared in wonder.Kahlan slowly shook her head. “But your instinctive act of seeking protectionwould have done you no good had you instead sought the protection of people wholive by the misguided teachings you repeat. Those teachings condemnself-preservation as a form of hate. Your people are being slaughtered with theaid of their own beliefs.”He looked stricken. “But, I don’t want that.”Kahlan smiled. “Neither do we. That’s why we came, and why Richard had to showyou that you can know the truth of reality and doing so will help you survive.”“Thank you,” he said to Richard.Richard smiled and gently smoothed down the boy’s blond hair. “Sorry I had tofrighten you to show you that what you were saying didn’t really make any sense.I needed to show you that the words you’ve been taught can’t serve you well—youcan’t live by them because they are devoid of reality and reason. You look to melike a boy who cares about living. I was like that when I was your age, and Istill am. Life is wonderful; take delight in it, look around with the eyes youhave, and see it in all its glory.”“No one has ever talked to me about life in this way. I don’t get to see much. Ihave to stay inside all the time.”“Tell you what, maybe, before I go, I can take you for a walk in the woods andshow you some of the wonders of the world around you—the trees and plants,birds, maybe we’ll even see a fox—and we’ll talk some more about the wonders andjoy of life. Would you like that?”The boy’s face lit up with a grin. “Really? You would do that for me?”Richard smiled one of those smiles that so melted Kahlan’s heart. He playfullypinched the boy’s nose. “Sure.”Owen came forward and ran his fingers affectionately through the boy’s hair. “Iwas once like you—a Wise One—until I got a little older than you.”The boy frowned up at him. “Really?”Owen nodded. “I used to think that I had been chosen because I was special andsomehow only I was able to commune with some glorious otherworldly dominion. Ibelieved that I was gushing great wisdom. Looking back, I am ashamed to see howfoolish it all was. I was made to listen to lessons. I was never allowed to be aboy. The great speakers praised me for repeating back the things I had heard,and when I spoke then with great scorn to people, they told me how wise I was.”“Me, too,” the boy said.Richard turned back to the men. “This is what your people have been reduced toas a source of wisdom—listening to children repeating meaningless expressions.You have minds in order to think and understand the world around you. Thisself-imposed blindness is a dark treason to yourselves.”The men in front, that Kahlan could see from where she sat holding the boy, allhung their heads in shame.“Lord Rahl is right,” Anson said, turning back to the men. “Until today, I neveractually questioned it or thought about how foolish it really is.”One of the speakers shook his fist. “It is not foolish!”Another, the one with the pointed chin, leaned in and snatched Anson’s knifefrom the sheath at his belt.Kahlan could hardly believe what she had just seen. It felt as if she werewatching a nightmare suddenly unfold, a nightmare she wasn’t able to stop oreven slow. It seemed she knew what was going to happen before she saw it.With an enraged cry, the speaker suddenly struck out, stabbing Anson before hecould react. Kahlan heard the blade hit bone. Driven by blind rage, the speakerswiftly drew back the fist holding the now bloody knife to stab Anson again.Anson’s face twisted in shock as he began going down.Points of candlelight reflecting off the polished length of razor-sharp steelblurred into streaks as Richard’s sword flashed past Kahlan. Even as the swordswept around, the unique ring of steel as it had been drawn accompanied itsterrifying arc toward the threat. Driven by Richard’s formidable strength, thetip of the sword whistled through the air. As the speaker’s arm reached the apexof its swing, as it once more began a deadly journey down, Richard’s bladeslammed into the side of the speaker’s neck and without seeming to slow in theleast ripped through flesh and bone, cleaving off the man’s head and oneshoulder along with the arm holding high the knife. The lightning slash threwlong strings of blood against the stone wall of the foundation of the palace ofthe Bandakar Empire.As the speaker’s head and the one shoulder with the arm attached tumbled throughthe air in an odd, wobbling spiral, his body collapsed in a heap. The headsmacked the floor with a sickening thud and bounced across the carpets, leavinga trail of blood as it tumbled.Richard swept the crimson blade around, directing it toward the potential threatof the other speakers. Kahlan pressed the boy’s face to her shoulder, coveringhis eyes.Some of the men fell in around Anson. Kahlan didn’t know how badly he washurt—or if he was even still alive.Not far away, the gory head and arm of the dead speaker lay before a table setwith candles. The fist still held the knife in a death grip. The sudden carnagelying there before them all, the blood spreading across the floor, washorrifying. Everyone stared in stunned silence.“The first blood drawn by you great speakers,” Richard said in a quiet voice tothe cluster of cringing speakers, “is not against those who come to murder yourpeople, but against a man who committed no violence against you—one of your ownwho simply stood up and told you that he wanted to be free of the oppression ofterror, free to think for himself.”Kahlan stood, and saw then that there were far more people in the room thanthere had been before. Most were not their men. When Cara made her way throughthe silent throng to Kahlan’s side, Kahlan took her by the arm and leaned close.“Who are all those people?”“The people from the city. Runners brought them the news that the town ofWitherton had been freed. They heard about our men being here to see the WiseOne and wanted to witness what would happen. The stairs and halls upstairs arefull of them. The words that have been spoken down here have spread up throughthe whole crowd.”Cara was obviously concerned about being close enough to protect Richard andKahlan. Kahlan knew that many of the people had been swayed by what Richard hadbeen saying, but now she didn’t know what they would do.The speakers seemed to have lost their conviction. They didn’t want to beassociated with the one among them who had done such a thing. One of themfinally left his fellow speakers and made the lone walk over to the boy standingbeside the curtain-draped platform, and under Kahlan’s protective arm.“I am sorry,” he said in a sincere voice to the boy. He turned to the peoplewatching. “I am sorry. I don’t want to be a speaker any longer.“Prophecy has been fulfilled; our redemption is at hand. I think we would dobest to listen to what these men have to say. I think I would like to livewithout the fear that the men of the Order are going to murder us all.”There were no cheers, no wild ovation, but, rather, silent agreement as all thepeople Kahlan could see nodded with what looked like expectant hope that theirsecret wish to be free of the brutality of the Imperial Order was not a sinful,secret thought after all, but was really the right thing.Richard knelt beside Owen as other men worked at tying a strip of cloth aroundAnson’s upper arm. He was sitting up. His whole arm was soaked in blood, but itlooked like the bandage was slowing the bleeding. Kahlan sighed in relief atseeing that Anson was alive and not seriously hurt.“It looks like it will need to be stitched,” Richard said.Some of the men agreed. An older man pushed his way through the crowd andstepped forward.“I do such things. I also have herbs with which to make a poultice.”“Thank you,” Anson said as his friends helped him stand. He looked light-headedand the men had to steady him. Once sure of his feet, he turned to Richard.“Thank you, Lord Rahl, for answering the call in the words of the devotion Ispoke: ‘Master Rahl, protect us.’“I never thought I would be the first to bleed for what we have set out to do,or that the blood would be drawn by one of our own people.”Richard gently clapped Anson on the back of his good shoulder, showing hisappreciation for Anson’s words.Owen looked around at the crowd. “I think we have all decided to be free again.”When the crowd nodded their agreement, Owen turned to Richard. “How will we getrid of the soldiers in Northwick?”Richard wiped his sword clean on the cloth of the dead speaker’s trouser leg.His gaze turned up to the crowd. “Any idea how many soldiers there are here inNorthwick?”There was no anger in his voice. Kahlan had seen, since the moment he had drawnhis sword, that his eyes had been absent of the Sword of Truth’s attendantmagic. There was no spark of the sword’s rage in the Seeker’s eyes, no magicdangerously dancing there, no fury in his demeanor. He had simply done what wasnecessary to stop the threat. While it was a relief that he had swiftlysucceeded, it was gravely worrisome that the sword’s magic had not come outalong with the sword itself.What had always been there to help him before had apparently finally failed him.That absence of his sword’s magic left Kahlan feeling icy apprehension.People in the crowd looked around at others and then spoke of hundreds of men ofthe Order they had seen. Another man said there were several thousand.An older woman lifted her hand. “Not that many, but approaching it.”Owen turned to Richard. “That’s a lot of men for us to take on.”Having never been in a real battle, he didn’t know the half of it. Richarddidn’t seem to hear Owen. He slid his sword back into the scabbard hidden underhis black cloak.“How do you know?” he asked the woman.“I am one of the people who help prepare their meals.”“You mean you people cook for the soldiers?”“Yes,” the old woman said. “They do not wish to do it for themselves.”“When do you next have to cook?”“We have large kettles we are just starting to get ready for tomorrow’s meal. Ittakes us all night to prepare the stew so that we can cook it tomorrow for theirevening meal. Besides that, we also have to work all night making biscuits,eggs, and porridge for their morning meal.”Kahlan imagined that the soldiers were probably pleased to have such a readysupply of pliant slaves. Richard paced in a short track between her and Owen. Hepinched his lower lip as he considered the problem. With such a small force oftheir own, nearly two thousand armed men was a lot to take on, especiallyconsidering how inexperienced the men were. Kahlan recognized that Richard wasscheming something.He took the arm of the older man tightening the bandage around Anson’s wound.“You said you had herbs. Do you know about such things?”The man shrugged. “Not a great deal, just enough to make simple remedies.”Kahlan’s mood sank. She had thought that maybe this man might know somethingabout making more of the antidote.“Do you have access to lily of the valley, oleander, yew, monkshood, hemlock?”The man blinked in surprise. “Common enough, I guess, especially just to thenorth in the wooded areas.”Richard turned to his men standing at the fore of the crowd. “We must eliminatethe men of the Order. The less fighting we have to do, the better.“While it’s still dark, we need to slip out of the city and go collect thethings we need.” He lifted a hand to the woman who had spoken about cooking forthe soldiers. “You show us where you’re going to do all the cooking oftomorrow’s evening meal. We’ll bring you some extra ingredients.“With what we put in the stew, the soldiers will be getting violently sickwithin hours. We will put different things in different kettles, so the symptomswill be different, to help create confusion and panic. If we can get enough ofthe poisons into the stew, most of them will die within hours, sufferingeverything from weakness and paralysis to convulsions.“Late in the night, we’ll go in and finish any who aren’t yet dead, or who maynot have eaten. If we prepare carefully, Northwick will be free of the ImperialOrder without having to fight them. It will be swiftly ended without any of usbeing hurt.”The room was silent for a moment; then Kahlan saw smiles breaking out among thepeople. A ray of light had come into their lives.With the heady thought of imminent freedom, some began to weep as they suddenlyfelt the need to come forward and tell brief accounts of those they loved whohad been raped, tortured, taken away, or murdered.Now that these people had been given a chance to live, none wanted to turn back.They saw salvation, and were willing to do what had to be done to gain it.“This will destroy our way of life,” someone said, not in bitterness, but inwonder.“Redemption is at hand,” one of the other people in the crowd added."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 53Standing in dusty streamers of late-day sunlight, Zedd wavered on his feet as hewaited not far from the tent where Sister Tahirah had just taken a small crate.While she was inside carefully unpacking and preparing the item of magic forinspection, the guards stood not far off, talking among themselves about theirchances of having ale that night. They were hardly worried about a skinny oldman with a Rada’Han around his neck and his arms shackled behind his backcausing them any trouble or running off.Zedd used the opportunity to lean against the cargo wagon’s rear wheel. Hewanted only to be allowed to lie down and go to sleep. Without being obvious, helooked over his shoulder at Adie. She gave him a brief, brave smile.The wagon he leaned against was full of items looted from the Keep that had yetto be identified. For all Zedd knew, he could be leaning against a wagon full ofsimple magic meant to entertain and teach children, or something so powerfulthat it would hand Jagang victory in one blinding instant.Some of the items brought from the Keep were unknown to Zedd. They had beenlocked behind shields that he had never been able to breach. Even in hischildhood the old wizards at the Keep had not been able to get at what wasbehind many of the shields. But the men who had assaulted and taken the Wizard’sKeep were untouched by magic and apparently had no trouble getting throughshields that had been in place for thousands of years. Everything Zedd knew hadbeen turned upside down. In some ways, it seemed like this was not only the endof the Wizard’s Keep as it had been intended and envisioned, but the end of away of life as well, and the death of an era.The items brought from the Keep that Zedd had so far identified were of no greatvalue to Jagang in winning the war. There were a few things, now back inprotective crates, that were a mystery to Zedd; for all he knew, they could beprofoundly dangerous. He wished that they could all be destroyed before one ofthe Sisters of the Dark discovered how to use them to create havoc.Zedd looked up when he saw one of the elite soldiers in leather and mail pausenot far away, his attention keenly focused on something. His right ear had a bigV-shaped notch taken out of the upper portion, the way some farmers marked theirswine. Although he wore the same kind of outfit as the rest of the elitesoldiers, his boots weren’t the same. Zedd saw, when the man looked around, thathis left eye didn’t open as wide as his right, but then he moved off into thebands of patrolling soldiers.As Zedd watched the constantly churning press of soldiers, Sisters, and othersmoving past, he kept having the disconcerting visions of people from his past,and others he knew. It was disheartening to be having suchwill-o’-the-wisps—illusions spawned by a mind that from lack of sleep, andperhaps the constant tension, was failing him. The faces of some of the eliteguards looked hauntingly familiar. He guessed he had been seeing the men fordays and they were beginning to look familiar.In the distance he saw a Sister walking past who looked like someone he knew. Hehad probably met her recently, was all. He’d met a number of Sisters recently,and it was never congenial. Zedd admonished himself that he had to keep a graspon his wits.One of the little girls not far away, being held prisoner by a big guardstanding over her, was watching Zedd and when he glanced up at her, she smiled.He thought it the oddest thing a frightened child—amid such chaos of soldiers,prisoners, and military activity—could do. He supposed that such a child couldnot possibly understand that she was there to be tortured, if necessary, to makesure Zedd told all he knew. He looked away from her long blond hair cascadingdown around her shoulders, her beautiful, oddly familiar face. This wasmadness—in more ways than one.The hump-nosed Sister emerged from the tent. “Bring them in,” she snapped.The four guards jumped into action, two seizing Adie, the other two taking Zedd.The men were big enough that Zedd’s weight was trivial to them. The way theyheld him up by his arms prevented half his steps from touching the ground. Theyhorsed him into the tent, advanced him around the table, spun him around, anddropped him into the chair with such force that it drove the wind from his lungsin a grunt.Zedd closed his eyes as he grimaced in pain. He wished they would just kill himso that he wouldn’t ever have to open his eyes again. But when they killed him,they would send his head to Richard. Zedd hated to think of the anguish thatwould cause Richard.“Well?” Sister Tahirah asked.Zedd opened his eyes and peered at the object sitting before him in the centerof the table.His breath caught.He blinked at what he saw, too astonished to let out the breath.It was constructed magic called a sunset spell.Zedd swallowed. Surely, none of the Sisters had opened it. No, they wouldn’thave opened it. He wouldn’t be sitting there if they had.Before him on the table sat a small box, the size of half his palm. The box wasshaped like the upper half of a stylized sun—a half disc with six pointed rayscoming out from it, meant to represent the sun setting at the horizon. The boxwas lacquered a bright yellow. The rays were also yellow, but with lines oforange, green, and blue along their edges.“Well?” Sister Tahirah repeated.“Ahh...”She was looking in her book, not at the small yellow box. “What is it?”“I’m ... not sure I remember,” he said, stalling.The Sister wasn’t in a patient mood. “Do you want me to—”“Oh, yes,” he said, trying to sound nonchalant, “I recall, now. It’s a box witha spell that produces a little tune.”That much was true. The Sister was still reading in her book. Zedd glanced backover his shoulder at Adie sitting on the bench. He could see in her eyes thatshe knew by his demeanor that something was up. He hoped the Sister couldn’tdetect the same thing.“It’s a music box, then,” Sister Tahirah murmured, more interested in hercatalog of magic.“Yes, that’s right. A box that contains a spell for music. When you remove thelid, it produces a melody.” Sweat trickled down from his neck, down between hisshoulder blades. Zedd swallowed and tried not to let his trembling carry in hisvoice. “Take the lid off—you’ll see.”She peered suspiciously over the top of the book. “You take the lid off.”“Well... I can’t. My hands are shackled behind my back.”“Use your teeth.”“My teeth?”The Sister used the back end of her pen to push the yellow half-sun box closerto him. “Yes, your teeth.”He had been counting on her suspicion, but he dared not overplay it. He workedhis tongue in his mouth, desperately trying to work up some saliva. Blood wouldbe better, but he knew that if he bit the inside of his lip the Sister would getsuspicious. Blood was too common a catalyst.Before the Sister got leery, Zedd leaned forward and tried to stretch his lipsaround the box. He worked to get his bottom teeth at the bottom of the sun andhis top teeth hooked over a pointed ray. The box was a hair too big. With a handon the back of his head, Sister Tahirah pushed him down on it. That was all heneeded and he captured the lid with his teeth.He lifted the lid, but the whole box came up off the table. He shook his headand, at last, the top came free. He set the lid aside.If not opened by a party to the theft of items preserved at the Keep, a sunsetspell had to be activated by a wizard whom the spell would recognize. Quickly,before she saw what he was doing, he let some saliva drop into the box in orderto activate the spell.Zedd felt giddy as the music started. It worked. It was still viable. He glancedthrough the narrow slit of the tent flap. The sun would be down soon.He wanted to jump up and dance to the merry tune. He wanted to let out a whoop.Even though he didn’t have long to live, he still felt exhilarated. The ordealwas almost over. In a short time, all the things of magic that were stolen wouldbe destroyed, and he would be dead. They would never get anything out of him. Hewould not betray their cause.He felt bad that the captured families who were being used to help gain hiscooperation would also die, but at least they would no longer have to suffer. Hefelt a sudden pang of sadness that Adie, too, would die. He hated the thought ofthat nearly as much as the thought of her suffering.The Sister reached in and replaced the lid. “Very cute.”The music stopped. It didn’t matter, though. The spell had been activated. Themusic was simply confirmation—and a warning to get out of range. No chance ofthat.It didn’t matter.Sister Tahirah scooped the yellow box off the table. “I’m going to put thisback.” She leaned down toward Zedd. “While I’m gone, I’m going to have theguards bring in the next child and let you have a good look at her, let youthink about what those men in the next tent are going to do to her—withouthesitation—if you stall and waste our time like that again.”“But I—”His words were cut off as she used the Rada’Han around his neck to send a shockof searing pain from the base of his skull down to his hips. His back arched ashe cried out, nearly losing consciousness. He slumped back in his chair, hishead hanging back, unable to lift it for the moment.“Come with me,” Sister Tahirah said to the guards. “I’ll need some help. Theguard who brings in the next child can watch them for a few minutes.”Panting from the lingering pain, tears filling his eyes, Zedd stared at theceiling of the tent. He saw light as the flap was opened. Shadows moved acrossthe canvas as the Sister and the four men left and she sent in the guard withthe child. Zedd stared up at the ceiling, not wanting to look at the face ofanother child.Finally, recovered from the bout of pain, he sat up.One of the big elite guards, dressed in their leather, mail, and a broad beltholding an assortment of weapons, stood to the side with a blond-headed girlheld before him. It was the girl who had smiled. Zedd closed his eyes a momentin the agony of what they would do to this poor child who reminded him so muchof someone he knew.When he opened his eyes, she smiled again. Then she winked.Zedd blinked. She lifted up her flower print dress just enough so that Zeddcould see two knives strapped to each of her thighs. He blinked again at what hewas seeing. He looked up into her smiling face.“Rachel... ?” he whispered.Her smile widened into a beaming grin.Zedd looked up at the face of the big man standing guard behind her.“Dear spirits...” Zedd whispered.It was the boundary warden.“I hear you’ve gotten yourself into a bit of trouble,” Chase said.For an instant, Zedd thought that for sure he must be seeing things. Then herealized why Rachel looked so familiar, yet different; she was more than two anda half years older than the last time he’d seen her. Her blond hair, oncechopped short, was now long. She had to be nearly a foot taller.Chase hooked his thumbs behind the broad leather belt. “Adie, as levelheaded asyou are, I imagine it had to be Zedd who got you into this fix.”Zedd looked over his shoulder. Adie wore a beautiful, tearful smile. He couldn’tremember the last time he had seen her smile.“He be nothing but trouble,” she told the boundary warden.It had been two and a half years since he’d seen Chase. The boundary warden wasan old friend. He was the one who had taken them to meet Adie back then so shecould show Richard the way through the boundary before Darken Rahl had broughtit down. Chase was older than Richard, but one of his dearest and most trustedfriends.“An older boundary warden, Friedrich, came looking for me,” Chase explained. “Hesaid that ‘Lord Rahl’ had sent him to the Keep to warn you about some trouble.He said that Richard had told him about me, and since you were gone and the Keephad been captured, he came to Westland looking for me. Boundary wardens canalways count on one another.“Rachel and I decided to come pull your scrawny hide out of the fire.”Zedd glanced at the sunlight coming through the tent’s narrow opening. “You haveto get out of here. Before the sun sets—or you’ll be killed. Hurry, get out ofhere while you can.”Chase lifted an eyebrow. “I’ve come all this way and I don’t intend to leavewithout you.”“But you don’t understand—”A knife poked through the side of the tent and ran a slit down through thecanvas. One of the elite guards pushed his way in through the slit. Zedd staredin astonishment. The man looked familiar, but he didn’t look right.“No!” Zedd called to Chase as the big man went for the axe hanging at his hip.“Stay where you are,” the man who came in through the slit in the side of thetent said to Chase. “There’s a man right outside who will put a sword throughyou if you move.”Zedd’s jaw dropped. “Captain Zimmer?”“Of course. I’ve come to get you out of here.”“But, but, you have black hair.”The captain flashed one of his infectious smiles. “Soot. Not a good idea to haveblond hair in the middle of Jagang’s camp. I’ve come to rescue you.”Zedd was incredulous. “But you all have to get out of here. Hurry, before thesun sets. Get out!”“Do you have any more men?” Chase asked the captain.“A handful. Who are you?”“An old friend,” Zedd told him. “Now, look here—”At that, cries and shouts came from outside. Captain Zimmer rushed to the tent’sopening. A man poked his head in.“It’s not us,” he said in answer to the captain’s unspoken question.In the distance, Zedd could hear the shouts of “Assassin!”Captain Zimmer rushed behind Zedd and worked a key in the manacles. They brokeopen. Zedd’s arms were suddenly free. The captain hurried to undo Adie’s as shestood and turned her back to him.“Sounds like our chance,” Rachel said. “Let’s use the commotion to get you outof here.”“The brains of the group,” Chase said with a grin.The first thing Zedd did when his arms were free was fall to his knees and hugthe girl. He couldn’t bring forth words, but they weren’t needed. To feel herspindly arms around his neck was better than any words.“I’ve missed you, Zedd,” she whispered in his ear.Outside the tent, mayhem had broken out. Orders were being shouted, men wererunning, and in the distance the clash of steel rang out.The Sister burst back into the tent. She saw Zedd free and immediately releaseda bolt of power through his collar. The shock sent him sprawling.Just then, a second, young, blond Sister in a drab brown wool dress charged inbehind Sister Tahirah. Sister Tahirah spun around. The second Sister smacked herso hard it nearly knocked the woman from her feet. Without pause, Sister Tahirahunleashed a bolt of her power that lit the inside of the tent with a blindingflash. Instead of it blasting the second Sister back through the tent’s doorway,as Zedd had expected, Sister Tahirah cried out and crumpled to the ground.“Got you!” the second Sister growled as she planted a boot on Sister Tahirah’sneck, keeping her on the ground.Zedd blinked in astonishment. “Rikka?”Rikka was already turning, her Agiel in her fist. She held it toward Chase.“Rikka?” Captain Zimmer asked from the other side of the tent, soundingstartled, not just to see who it was, but perhaps to see the Mord-Sith with herblond hair undone from its single braid and flying free.“Zimmer?” She frowned at his black hair. “What are you doing here?”“What am I doing here? What are you doing here!” He gestured to her dress. “Whatare you wearing?”Rikka grinned that wicked grin she had. “The dress of a Sister.”“Sister?” Zedd asked. “What Sister?”Rikka shrugged. “One who didn’t want to give up her dress. She lost her headover the whole affair.” With her finger and thumb Rikka pulled her lower lipout. “See? I borrowed her ring, too. I spread the split and hung it here, so I’dlook like a real Sister.”Rikka pulled Sister Tahirah up by her hair and shoved her toward Adie. “Get thatthing off her neck.”“I will do no such—”Rikka drove her Agiel up under the Sister’s chin. Blood gushed out over herlower lip. The Sister started choking on it as she gasped in agony.“I said, get that thing off Adie’s neck. And don’t you ever question me again.”Sister Tahirah scrambled to Adie to do as the Mord-Sith had commanded.Chase planted his fists on his hips as he glared down at Zedd, still on theground. “So what are we going to do now—draw straws to see who gets to rescueyou?”“Bags! Isn’t anyone listening? You people have to get out of here!”Rachel shook a finger at Zedd. “Now, Zedd, you know you’re not supposed to saybad words in front of children.”Sputtering in frustration, Zedd gaped up at Chase.“I know,” the boundary warden said with a sigh. “She’s been a trial for me,too.”“The sun’s about to set!” Zedd roared.“It would be better if we could delay until it did,” Captain Zimmer said. “Itwould be easier to get out of camp in the dark.”A humming noise filled the tent, making the very air vibrate, and then there wasa sudden metallic pop. Adie cried out with relief as the collar fell away.“Isn’t anyone listening?” Zedd scrambled to his feet and shook his fists. “I’veignited a sunset spell!”“A what?” Chase asked.“A sunset spell. It’s a protective device from the Keep. It’s a shield of sorts.When it recognizes that other shields are being violated and protected items arebeing taken, it insinuates itself among the stolen goods. When a thief opens itto see what it is, it activates the spell. At the first sunset the spell ignitesand destroys everything that has been plundered.”Sister Tahirah shook her fist at him. “You fool!”Rikka seized his arm. “Then let’s get going.”Chase grabbed Zedd’s other arm and pulled him back. “Now, hold on.”Zedd yanked both arms free and pointed out through the slit in the side of thetent at the setting sun. “We’ve got mere moments until this place is afireball.”“How big a fireball?” Captain Zimmer asked.Zedd threw up his hands. “It will kill thousands. It won’t destroy the camp byany means, but this whole area is going to be leveled.”Everyone started talking, but Chase cut them all off with an angry command forsilence. “Now listen to me. If we look like we’re escaping, we’ll be caught.Captain, you and your men come with me. We’ll pretend like Zedd and Adie are ourprisoners. Rachel, too—that’s how I got in here; I found out they were holdingchildren.” He flipped a hand toward Rikka and Sister Tahirah. “They will looklike Sisters in charge of prisoners, along with us playing as the guards.”“Do you want that thing off your neck, first?” Rikka asked Zedd.“No time for that now. Let’s go.”Adie grabbed Zedd’s arm. “No.”“What!”“Listen to me, old man. There be those families and children in these tentsaround us. They will die. You go. Get to the Keep. I will get the innocentpeople out of here.”Zedd didn’t like the idea, but arguing with Adie was a fool’s task, and besides,there was no time.“We split up, then,” Captain Zimmer said. “Me and my men will play the part ofguards and get the men, women, and children out of here, back to our lines,along with Adie.”Rikka nodded. “Tell Verna that I’m going to go with Zedd to help take back theKeep. He will need a Mord-Sith to keep him out of trouble.”Everyone looked around to see if there would be any arguments. No one saidanything. It suddenly seemed settled.“Done,” Zedd said.He threw his arms around Adie and kissed her cheek. “Be careful. Tell Verna I’mgoing to take the Keep back. Help her defend the passes.”Adie nodded. “Be careful. Listen to Chase—he be a good man to come all this wayfor you.”Zedd smiled and then gasped as Chase grabbed his robes and yanked him out of thetent. “The sun is setting—let’s get out of here. Remember, you’re our prisoner.”“I know the part,” Zedd grumbled as he was dragged out of the tent like a sackof grain. He smiled as Adie, already rushing away, looked over her shoulder onelast time. She smiled back, and then was gone.“Wait!” Zedd called. He quickly reached into one of the wagons and retrievedsomething he didn’t want to be destroyed. He slipped it into a pocket. “Allright, let’s go.”Outside the tent, the camp was in pandemonium. Elite guards, in a state of highalert and with weapons drawn, raced past on their way toward the command tents.Other men ran to the ring of barricades. Trumpets blared alarms and codedmessages that directed men to tasks. Zedd feared his small group might be setupon and held for questioning.Instead of waiting for that to happen, Chase reached out and snatched a soldierrunning past. “What’s the matter with you? Get me some protection for theseprisoners until I can get them to a safe place! The emperor will have our headsif we allow them to be recaptured!”The soldier quickly collected a dozen men and fell in around Rikka, SisterTahirah, Chase, Rachel, and Zedd. Rachel was doing a convincing job of bawlingin fear. For effect, Chase would occasionally give her a shake and yell at herto shut up.Zedd glanced back over his shoulder, seeing the sun touch the horizon. Hegrowled at Rikka, out ahead, for her to pick up her pace.At the barricades, scowling guards looked them over carefully as they approachedand then opened their ranks. They were preventing anyone from getting in, andwere momentarily confused by such a company of their own men with prisonersmaking their way out. One man decided to step out to stop and question them.Chase straight-armed him. “Idiot! Out of our way! Emperor’s orders!”The man frowned as he stared at the procession sweeping past. While heconsidered what to do, they were past and gone, swallowed up in the larger camp.In moments, they were out of the heart of the camp. In short order, regularsoldiers, seeing Rikka at the lead, moved to block their path. A beautiful womanout among the regular soldiers was asking for trouble, and with the confusionthe men saw in the command area, they believed they had an opportunity whilethose in authority were busy. Rikka and Chase kept their small group moving at aquick pace. The grinning soldiers closed ranks, blocking the way. One of themen, missing his two front teeth, took a step out in front of his men. With onethumb hooked behind his belt, he held up the other hand.“Hold on there. I think the ladies would like to stay for a visit.”Without pause, Rachel reached under the hem of her dress and pulled a knife. Shedidn’t slow or even look back as she flipped the knife up over her shoulder. Inone fluid motion, without missing a step, Chase caught the knife by the tip andheaved it at the toothless man. With a thunk, the knife slammed hilt-deep intothe man’s forehead.As he was still toppling back, Rachel flipped a second knife up over hershoulder. Chase caught it and sent it on its way. As the second man twistedtoward the ground, dead, the rest of the men backed away to let the small group,marching onward, in among them. Deadly rights within the Imperial Order campwere not a rarity.Elite guards or not, the soldiers were confident in their numbers and, with abeautiful woman in their midst, sure of what they wanted. Men all around closedin.Zedd snatched a quick glance back. “Now! Hit the ground!”Rikka, Chase, Rachel, and Zedd dove to the dirt.For an instant, everyone above them froze, staring in surprise. The soldiers whowere accompanying them, weapons already drawn for the fight they expected, alsostopped and stood in confusion.Sister Tahirah saw her opportunity and cried out. “Help! These people are—”The world ignited with brilliant white light.An instant later a thunderous blast rocked the ground. A wall of debrisfollowed, driven before a roar of noise.Men were blown into the air. Some were cut down by flying wreckage. The eliteguards that had escorted them tumbled through the air over Zedd.Sister Tahirah had turned toward the flash. A wagon wheel shot toward them atincredible speed, hitting her chest-high, cutting her in two. The bloodied wheelsailed onward without even being slowed. The Sister’s shredded remains wereflung across the ground along with the bodies of countless men.As the blast from behind still rumbled, the screams of terribly wounded men roseinto the lingering rays of sunset.Zedd dearly hoped that Adie had not wasted any time in escaping.Chase seized Zedd’s robes at one shoulder and hauled him to his feet as he sweptRachel up in his other arm. Rikka grabbed Zedd’s robes at the other shoulder andpulled him ahead. Together, Zedd’s two rescuers rushed with him into thecarnage.Rachel hid her face in Chase’s shoulder.Zedd was about to ask Chase why in the world he would teach a young girl suchthings with knives when he recalled that he himself had been the one who hadonce commanded Chase to the task of teaching her everything the boundary wardenknew.Rachel was a special person. Zedd had wanted her to be prepared for what lifemight have in store.“You should have let me make the Sister take off that collar when we had thechance,” Rikka said as they ran.“If we had taken the time,” Zedd answered, “we would have been back there andcaught up in that fireball.”“I suppose,” she said.As they slowed a bit to catch their breath, men ran in every direction. In theconfusion and disorder, no one noticed that the four of them were making goodtheir escape. As they hastily made their way through the vast Imperial Orderencampment, Zedd put an arm around Rikka’s shoulders and pulled her closer.“Thank you for coming to save my life.”She flashed him a cunning smile. “I wouldn’t leave you to those pigs—not afterall you’ve done for us. Besides, Lord Rahl has Cara protecting him; I’m sure hewould want a Mord-Sith protecting his grandfather as well.”Zedd had been right. The world was turned upside down.“We have horses and supplies hidden,” Chase said. “On our way out of this place,we’d better take a horse for Rikka.”Rachel looked back over Chase’s shoulder, her arms around his neck. She gaveZedd a serious frown as she whispered, “Chase is unhappy because he had to leaveall his weapons behind and be so lightly armed.”Zedd glanced to the battle-axe at one hip, the sword at Chase’s other, and twoknives at the small of his back. “Yes, I can see where being so defenselesswould make a man grumpy.”“I don’t like this place,” Rachel whispered in Chase’s ear.He patted her back as she laid her head on his shoulder. “We’ll be back in thewoods in no time, little one.”Amid the screams and death, it was as tender a sight as Zedd could imagine."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 54Verna paused when the sentry rushed up in the dark. She moved her hands up onthe reins, closer to the bit, to keep her horse from spooking.“Prelate—I think it might be an attack of some sort,” the soldier said inbreathless worry.She frowned at the man. “What might be an attack? What is it?”“There’s something coming up the road.” He pointed back toward Dobbin Pass. “Awagon, I think.”The enemy was always sending things at them—men sneaking through the darkness,horses encased in spells designed to blow a breach in their shields runningwildly toward them, innocent enough wagons with archers hiding inside, powerfulspell-driven winds laced with magic conjuring of every sort.“Since it’s dark, the commander thinks it’s suspicious and we shouldn’t take anychances.”“Sounds wise,” Verna said.She had to get back to their camp. She had made the rounds herself to get a goodlook at their defenses, to see the men at the outposts, before their nightlymeeting back at camp to go over the day’s reports.“The commander wants to destroy the wagon before it gets too close. I’vechecked, Prelate—there are no other Sisters at hand. If you don’t want to see tothis, we can have the men up above drop a rockslide on the wagon and crush it.”Verna had to get back to meet with the officers. “You had better tell yourcommander to take care of it in whatever manner he sees fit.”The soldier saluted with snap of a fist to his heart.Verna pulled her horse around and put a foot into the stirrup. Why would theImperial Order think they could get a wagon through, especially at night?Certainly, they weren’t foolish enough to think it wouldn’t be seen in the dark.She paused and looked at the soldier hurrying away.“Wait.” He stopped and turned. “I changed my mind. I’ll go with you.”It was foolish to use the rocks they had ready overhead; they might need them ifa full-scale attack suddenly charged up this pass. It was silly to waste such adefense.She followed the man up the trail to the lookout point where his company waited.The men were all watching through the trees. The road out ahead and below themlooked silver in the light of the rising moon.Verna inhaled the fragrance of balsam firs as she watched the wagon making itsway up the silvery road, being pulled by a single, plodding horse. Tense archerswaited at the ready. They had a shielded lantern standing by to light firearrows in order to set the wagon ablaze.Verna didn’t see anyone in the wagon. An empty wagon seemed pretty suspicious.She recalled the strange message from Ann, warning her to let an empty wagonthrough.But they had already done that. Verna recalled that the girl with the messagefrom Jagang had come in by this route and method. Verna’s heart pounded in worryat the thought of what new message Jagang might be sending, now.Perhaps it was Zedd’s and Adie’s heads.“Hold,” she called to the archers. “Let it through, but stand at the ready incase it’s a trick.”Verna made her way down the narrow path between the trees. She stood behind ascreen of spruce, watching. When the wagon was close enough, she opened a smallgap in the weave of the vast shield she and the Sisters had spun across thepass. The pattern of magic was barbed with every nasty sort of magic they couldconjure. This pass was small enough that the shields alone could hold it, and ifthe enemy did come, it was too small for any numbers to come all at once. Evenwithout the formidable shield, the pass was relatively easy to hold.When the wagon passed through the shield, Verna closed the hole. When it rolledclose enough, one of the men ran out of the trees and look control of the horse.As the wagon drew to a halt, dozens of archers behind him and on the other side,behind Verna, drew their weapons. Verna had spun a web of magic and she wasprepared to unleash it at the slightest provocation.The tarp in the bed of the wagon eased back. A little girl sat up. It was thechild who had brought the message the last time. Her face lit up at seeingVerna, someone she recognized.Verna’s heart skipped a beat at the thought of what the message might be, thistime.“I brought some friends,” the girl said.People lying in the back of the wagon pulled the tarp aside and started sittingup. They looked like parents with their frightened children.Verna blinked in shock when she saw some of the people help Adie up. Thesorceress looked to be exhausted. Her black and gray hair was no longer partedneatly in the middle, but was in as much disarray as Zedd’s usually was.Verna rushed over, leaning in to help the woman. “Adie! Oh, Adie, am I ever gladto see you!”The old sorceress smiled. “I be awfully happy to see you, too, Verna.”Verna’s gaze swept over the people in the wagon, her heart still pounding withapprehension. “Where’s Zedd?”“He escaped as well.”Verna closed her eyes with a silent prayer of gratitude.Her eyes popped open. “If he escaped, then where is he?”“He be on his way back to the Keep, in Aydindril,” Adie said in her raspy voice.“The enemy has captured it.”“We heard.”“That old man intends to have his Keep back.”“Knowing Zedd, I feel sorry for anyone who gets in his way.”“Rikka be with him.”“Rikka! What was she doing over there? I ordered her not to do that!” Vernarealized how that must have sounded. “We thought it would be pointless, that shewouldn’t have a chance and we would just lose her for nothing.”“Rikka be Mord-Sith. She has a mind of her own.”Verna shook her head. “Well, even though she wasn’t supposed to do that, nowthat I see you again and know Zedd has escaped as well, I’m glad that thatobstinate woman didn’t listen to me.”“Captain Zimmer be on his way back as well.”“Captain Zimmer!”“Yes, he and some of his men decided to come to rescue us as well. They becoming back the way they travel, unseen in the night.” Adie gestured to thesurrounding trees. “They be up around us, protecting the wagon on our way in.The captain feared that some of the enemy might stop the wagon and capture usall over again. He wanted to make sure we be safe.”The captain and his men had special signals that allowed them to move throughthe pass without being attacked by their own men, or the Sisters, by mistake.The nature of the way Captain Zimmer and his men worked was that they were, forthe most part, outside regular command. Kahlan had set it up that way so theycould act on their own initiative. While it could at times be aggravating, thosemen accomplished more than anyone ever expected.“Zedd wanted me to help these people escape.” Adie gave Verna a meaningful look.“There be others we could not help.”Verna glanced over at the people huddling together at the back of the wagon. “Ican only imagine what Jagang has been doing with people like that.”“No,” Adie said. “I doubt you can.”Verna changed to an even more horrifying subject. “Has Jagang been able to findanything from the Keep, so far, that he will use against us?”“Thankfully, no. Zedd set a spell that destroyed the things stolen from theKeep. There be a big explosion in the middle of their camp.”“Like the one back in Aydindril that killed so many of them?”“No, but it still caused much destruction and killed some important people—evensome of Jagang’s Sisters, I believe.”Verna never thought she would see the day that she would be pleased to hear thatSisters of the Light had died. Those women were controlled by the dream walker,and even when they had been offered freedom, they had been too afraid to believethose trying to rescue them. They had chosen to remain Jagang’s slaves.With a sudden thought, Verna grabbed a fistful of Adie’s robes. “Could the spellZedd ignited possibly have taken out Jagang?”With her completely white eyes, Adie looked back up Dobbin Pass toward theImperial Order camp. “I wish I had better news, Prelate, but Captain Zimmer, onthe way out, told me that just as we were about to be rescued, an assassinmanaged to get deep into the inner camp.”“An assassin? Who was it? Where was he from?”“None of us knows. He appeared much like others from the Old World. The intruderbe driven by a single-minded determination to get to Jagang and kill him. Hesomehow made it into the inner defenses, killed some people, and took theuniform of the elite guards so he might get to Jagang. The guards somehowrecognized he not be one of their own. They hacked the man to pieces before hecould get close to the emperor.“Jagang left the area until his men could check over their defenses and makesure there be no more assassins about. Many of the Sisters went with him,helping with his safeguards. That be when Zedd set off the sunset spell. We didnot know Jagang had left the area, but it would have make no difference. Zeddhad to use the spell when it be put before him. The spell be triggered by thesun setting.”Verna nodded. For a moment, she had been hoping ...“Still, you and Zedd escaped, and that’s what matters for now. Thank theCreator.”“A surprising number of people showed up all at once to rescue us.” Adie liftedan eyebrow. “I do not recall seeing the Creator among them.”The warm breeze ruffled Verna’s curly hair. “I suppose not, but you know what Imean.”The crickets in the woods kept up their steady chirping. Life seemed to be alittle sweeter, their situation a little less hopeless.She let out a sigh. “I hope the Creator will at least help Zedd and Rikka takeback the Keep.”“Zedd will not need the Creator’s help,” Adie said. “Another man showed up tohelp get us out. Chase be an old friend of Zedd, me, and Richard. Chase willhave those holding the Keep praying for the protection of the Creator.”“Then we can look forward to the day the Keep is back in our hands and Jagang isdenied help in breaking through the passes into D’Hara.”Verna waved her arm, signaling, and the four couples standing at the back of thewagon shuffled forward with their children.“Welcome to D’Hara,” Verna told them. “You will be safe, here.”“Thank you for helping get us out,” one of the men said with a bow of his headto Adie. “I feel ashamed, now, of the terrible things I had been thinking ofyou.”Adie smiled to herself as she tightened her thin fingers on his shoulder. “True.But I could not blame you.”The girl who had brought the message the last time tugged on Verna’s dress.“This is my mother and father. I told them how nice you were to me, before.”Verna squatted down and hugged the girl. “Welcome back, child. Welcome back.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 55Whenever a breath of wind sighed among the branches above, silvery streamers ofmoonlight cascading down through the forest canopy glided about in the darknesslike ghosts on the prowl. Kahlan peered around, barely able to make out thesomber shapes of the looming trees as she tried to see if there was anythingthat did not belong. She heard no chirps of bugs, no small animals scurryingamong the leaf litter, no mockingbirds singing throughout the night as there hadbeen. Carefully picking her way over the mossy ground, she did her best to seein the gloom so as not to step in holes and cracks in the rocky places or poolsof standing water in the low areas.Ahead of her, Richard slipped through the open forest like a shadow. At times heseemed to disappear, causing her to fear that he might no longer be with them.He had ordered everyone following behind him not to talk and to walk as quietlyas possible, but none of them could move through the woods as silently as hedid.For some reason, Richard was as tense as his bowstring. He felt that somethingwas wrong, but he didn’t know what. While it might seem a beautiful moonlitnight in the woods, the way Richard was acting, on top of the haunting silence,had draped a pall of foreboding over everyone.Kahlan was at least pleased that the skies had cleared. The rains of recent dayshad made travel not just difficult, but miserable. While it hadn’t really beencold, the wet made it feel so. Taking shelter had not been an option. Until theyhad the final dose of the antidote, they had no choice but to press on.The antidote from Northwick had improved Richard’s condition a little, inaddition to stopping the advance of the symptoms of his poisoning, but now thetemporary improvement was dissipating. Kahlan was so worried for him that shehad no appetite.They now had well over double the number of men with them, and many more thanthat were making their way toward the city of Hawton by different routes. Thoseother groups of men planned to eliminate the lesser detachments of ImperialOrder soldiers stationed in villages along the way. Richard, Kahlan, and theirsmaller group were pushing toward Hawton as rapidly as possible, deliberatelyavoiding contact with the enemy so as to get there before Nicholas and hissoldiers knew they were on their way. Stealth would afford them the best chanceof recovering the final dose of the antidote.Once they had the antidote, then they could gather with the rest of the men foran attack. Kahlan knew that if they could first eliminate Nicholas it would makeit much easier, and less risky, to defeat the remaining Imperial Order troops.If she could somehow find a way to get close to Nicholas she could touch himwith her power. She knew better than to suggest such an idea to Richard; hewould never go along with it.To a certain extent, Kahlan felt responsible for what these people had sufferedunder the Imperial Order. After all, if not for her freeing the chimes, theboundary protecting Bandakar would still be in place. Yet, if these people couldrid themselves of the Imperial Order, the changes that had come about also meantthe true freedom they had never really enjoyed and, with it, the opportunity forbetter lives.The change in the people in Northwick had been heartening to witness. Thatnight, the men Richard and Kahlan had brought had stayed up most of the nighttalking to the people there, explaining the things Richard and Kahlan hadexplained to them. The morning after the annihilation of the soldiers who hadtaken over their city and held them in the grip of fear, the people hadcelebrated by singing and dancing in the streets. Those people had learned notonly just how precious freedom really was, but also that their old ways providedno real tools for improving the quality of their lives.After Richard had dissolved the ancient illusions of the Wise One’s wisdom andthe meaningless tenets the speakers substituted for knowledge, and after thekilling of the enemy soldiers, the men of Northwick had not been shy aboutvolunteering to help rid their land of the Imperial Order. Freed from theenforced blindness of a repressive mindset, many now hungered aloud for a futureof their own making.Kahlan unexpectedly came up against Richard’s outstretched arm. She put a handto her chest, over her galloping heart, then immediately turned and passed thesignal to stop back to those behind. There was still no sound in the darkwoods—not so much as the buzz of a mosquito.Richard slipped his pack off of his back, set it on a low rock, and startedquietly searching through it.Kahlan leaned close to whisper. “What are you doing?”“Fire. We need light. Pass the word back for some of the men to get outtorches.”While Richard pulled out a steel and flint, Kahlan whispered instructions toCara, who in turn passed them back. In short order, several men tiptoed forwardwith torches.The men gathered in close, squatting down beside a low jumble of rock next toRichard. He picked a stick up off the ground and dipped it in a small containerfrom his pack. He then wiped the stick across the top of a high point on therock.“I’m putting some pine resin on this rock,” he told the men. “Hold your torchesover it so that when I strike a spark and the resin flames up, it will light thetorches.”Pine resin, painstakingly collected from rotting trees, was valuable forstarting fires in the rain. A spark would ignite it even when wet. It burned hotenough to often be able to catch damp wood on fire.Richard had always seemed at home in the dark. Kahlan had never seen him need tohave light like this. She stared intently out into the night, wondering what itwas he thought might be out there that they couldn’t see.“Cara,” Richard whispered, “pass the word back. I want everyone to get out aweapon. Now.”Without hesitation, Cara turned to pass on the orders. After a seemingly endlessspan of silence, broken only by the soft whisper of steel sliding past leather,word came back and she leaned down toward Richard. “Done.”Richard looked up at Kahlan and Jennsen. “Both of you, as well.”Kahlan drew her sword, Jennsen her silver-handled dagger with the ornate letterR that stood for the House of Rahl.Richard struck the spark. The pine pitch flamed up with an angry hiss; thetorches caught; light ignited in the heart of the dark forest.In the sudden, harsh glare, everyone turned and looked about to see what mightbe hiding in the darkness around them.Men gasped.In the trees all around them, perched on branches everywhere, sat black-tippedraces. Hundreds of them. Beady black eyes watched the people.In that moment of sudden bright light, everything but the flickering flame wassilent and still.With a burst of wild cries, the races launched their attack.From all around, all at once, the races descended on them. The night airsuddenly filled with a riot of glossy black feathers, the sweep of huge wings,hooked beaks, and reaching talons. After such a long silence, the sound ofpiercing cries and beating wings was deafening.Everywhere, the people met the attack with fierce determination. Some of the menwere knocked to the ground, or stumbled and fell. Others cried out as they triedto protect themselves with one arm while driving off the attack with the other.Men hacked at the races atop their friends and turned to ward off otherscreeching beasts that flew in toward them.Kahlan saw the red-striped breast of a race abruptly appear right before herface. She swung her sword, lopping off a wing, and spun around, bringing thesword up to hit another bird coming in from the other side. She stabbed a raceon the ground at her feet as it reached in with its beak, like a vulture, to tryto rip flesh from her leg.Richard’s sword was a blur of silver slashing through the winged attackers. Acloud of black feathers surrounded him. The birds were attacking everyone, butthe assault appeared to be centered around Richard. It almost seemed as if theraces were trying to drive the people back from Richard so that more of thebirds could get at him.Jennsen frantically stabbed at birds going for him. Kahlan swung at others,knocking them to the ground, wounded or dead. With measured efficiency, Carasnatched them out of the air and swiftly wrung their necks.Everywhere, men stabbed, cut, and hacked at the onslaught of fierce raptors.Some men used their torches as weapons. The night was filled with the screams ofthe birds, with the flapping of wings, with the thud of weapons striking home.Birds tumbled and fell as they were hit. More dove in to take their place. Thetrees all around poured the monstrous birds down on them. Wounded and dyingbirds struggling on the ground made the forest floor a writhing sea of blackfeathers.The ferocity of the attack was frightening.And then, it was suddenly over.A few of the birds on the ground, wings spread, still tried to get up, theirfeathers making a silken rasp as they rubbed against the feathers of dead birdsbeneath them. Here and there men stabbed or chopped at a bird still alive on theground at their feet. It wasn’t long before all the creatures finally wentstill. No more races came from the sky.Dead races mounded up against Richard like snow drifted in a storm.Men panted as they held torches aloft. They peered into the darkness beyond thelight, looking for any sign of more trouble from above. But for the hissing ofthe torches, the night was silent. The branches of the trees all around appearedto be empty.Kahlan could see scratches and cuts on Richard’s arms and hands. She wadedthrough the sea of dead birds to get to his pack sitting on a near by rock. Theforest floor around him was nearly knee-deep with dead races. She had to flip adead bird off Richard’s pack. Pushing her hand down into his pack, she blindlysearched until her fingers found a folded waxed paper that contained a salve.Cara rushed in close to Richard when she saw him unsteady on his feet. Shegrasped his arm, lending him support.“What in the world was that all about?” Jennsen asked, panting, still catchingher breath as she pulled strands of red ringlets off her sweaty face.“I guess they finally decided to try to get us,” Owen said.Jennsen patted Betty’s head when the goat stepped unhurt through the corpses ofraces to get in closer to her friends. “One thing for sure is that they finallyfound us again.”“There was an important difference this time,” Richard said. “They weren’tfollowing us. They were here, waiting for us.”Everyone stared at him.“What do you mean?” Kahlan paused at daubing salve on his cuts. “They’vefollowed us before. They must have seen us.”Betty moved in closer, leaning against Kahlan’s leg to stand and watch her andRichard talking. Kahlan wasn’t in the mood to be scratching the goat’s ears, soshe pushed her out of the way.Richard laid a hand on Cara’s shoulder to steady himself. Kahlan noticed how heswayed on his feet. At times he was having difficulty standing.“No. They haven’t been following us. The skies have been empty.” Richardgestured to the dead birds all around him. “These races weren’t following us.They were waiting for us. They knew we were coming here. They lay in wait.”That was a chilling thought—if it was true.Kahlan straightened, holding the waxed paper in one hand; a finger of her otherhand, loaded with salve, waiting. “How could they possibly know where we weregoing?”“That’s what I’d like to know,” Richard said.Nicholas glided back into his body, his mouth still opened wide in a yawn thatwas not a yawn. He stretched his neck to one side and then the other. He smiledwith his delight in the game. It had been dazzling. It had been delicious. Hiswidening grin bared his teeth.Nicholas staggered to his feet, wavering unsteadily for a moment. It remindedhim of the way Richard Rahl swayed on his feet, dizzy with the effects of apoison that was inexorably doing its deadly work.Poor Richard Rahl needed the last dose of the antidote.Nicholas opened his mouth again in a yawn that was not a yawn, twisting hishead, eager to be away, eager to learn more. He would return soon enough. Hewould watch them. Watch them as they worried, as they struggled in vain tounderstand what was happening, watch them as they approached. They would reachhim in mere hours.The fun was truly about to begin.Nicholas wound his way across the room, stepping between the bodies sprawledeverywhere. They had all died suddenly when the races were killed. Here andthere the dead were stacked in piles atop one another, the way the races inthose dark woods had been heaped around Richard Rahl.Such violent deaths. Those spirits had been horrified as they were slaughtered,but there was nothing they could do to stop it.Nicholas had controlled their souls, their fate. Now they were beyond hiscontrol; they now belonged to the Keeper of the dead.Nicholas ran his fingernails back through his hair, shivering with delight as hefelt the slick oils glide through his fingers and against his palm.He had to drag three bodies aside before he could get at the door. He threw theheavy latch over and opened the thick door.“Najari!”The man stood not far away, leaning against the wall, waiting. His muscular formstraightened.“What is it?”Nicholas opened his arm back in graceful indication, his fingers tipped withblack nails stretching wide. “There is a mess in here that needs to be cleanedup. Get some men and have these bodies taken away.”Najari stepped to the door and stretched his neck to peer into the room.“The whole crowd we brought in?”“Yes.” Nicholas snapped. “I needed them all, and some more I had the soldiersfetch for me. I’m done with them all, now. Get rid of them.”When the races had attacked, each had been driven by the soul of one of theseungifted people, and each of those souls had been driven by Nicholas. It hadbeen a stupendous achievement—the simultaneous command of so many with suchprecision and coordination. When the races had been killed, though, so, too,died the bodies back in the room with Nicholas.He supposed that one day he really should learn how to call back such spiritswhen their hosts died. It would save him from having to get new ones each time.But people were plentiful. Besides, if he were to find a way to call them back,then he would have to mind the people once their spirits returned, after theyhad learned his use of them.Still, it was annoying when Richard Rahl killed those Nicholas used to help himwatch.“How much longer?” Najari asked.Nicholas smiled, knowing what the man was curious about. “Soon. Very soon. Youmust get these people out of here before they arrive. Then, keep our men out ofthe way. Let them do as they will.”Najari flashed a cunning smile. “As you wish, Nicholas.”Nicholas lifted an eyebrow. “Emperor Nicholas.”Najari chuckled as he started away to get his men. “Emperor Nicholas.”“You know, Najari, I’ve been thinking.”Najari turned back. “About what?”“About Jagang. We’ve worked so hard. What reason is there for me to bow to him?A legion of my silent army could swoop in upon him and that would be that. Iwouldn’t even need an army. He could mount his horse one day, and I could bethere in the beast, waiting to throw him and trample him to death.”Najari rubbed his stubble. “True enough.”“Of what use is Jagang, really? I could just as easily rule the Imperial Order.In fact, I would be better suited to it.”Najari cocked his head. “Then what of the plans we’ve already laid?”Nicholas shrugged. “Why change them? But why should I give the Mother Confessorto Jagang? And why let him have the world? Perhaps I will keep her for my ownamusement... and have the world as well.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 56Richard pressed his back up against the clapboard wall. He had to pause amoment, waiting for the world to stop spinning. He was so cold he felt numb. Asdark as it was, he was having difficulty seeing.But it was more than the darkness.He knew that his sight was beginning to fail him.At night it was worse. He had always been able to see better at night than mostother people. Now, he was no better able to see at night than Kahlan. Thatwasn’t a big difference, but he knew it was meaningful.The third state of the poison had begun.Fortunately, they were close to having the final dose.“This is the alleyway, here,” Owen whispered.Richard looked up and down the street. He didn’t see anything moving. The cityof Hawton was asleep. He wished he could be, too. He was so exhausted and dizzyhe could hardly put one foot in front of the other. He had to take shallowbreaths to keep from coughing. Coughing brought on the worst pain. At least hewasn’t coughing up blood.Coughing now, though, could be fatal, so he swallowed, trying to stifle theurge. If they made any noise, it might alert the soldiers.When Owen moved into the alleyway, Richard, Kahlan, Cara, Jennsen, Tom, Anson,and a handful of their men followed in single file.There had been no lights burning in the windows facing the streets. As the smallgroup moved through the alley close to the walls, Richard saw no windows. A fewof the walls did have doors.At a narrow space between buildings, Owen turned in, following the brick pathhardly wider than Richard’s shoulders.Richard seized Owen by the arm. “Is this the only way in?”“No. See there? The walkway goes through to the street in front, and there isanother door inside that comes up on the other side of the building.”Satisfied that they had alternative escape routes, Richard gave Owen a nod. Theytook the dark stairwell down to a room at the bottom under the building. Tomstruck flint to steel a number of times until he managed to light a candle.Once the candle was lit, Richard gazed around at the small, empty, windowlessroom. “What is this place?”“The basement of a palace,” Owen said.Richard frowned at the man. “What are we doing here?”Owen hesitated and glanced at Kahlan.Kahlan saw the look. She pushed Richard down until he sat and leaned backagainst the wall. A footsore Betty squeezed between them and lay down besideRichard, pleased to have a rest. Jennsen squatted close, on the other side ofBetty. Cara closed him in from the other side.Kahlan knelt in front of him and then sat back on her heels. “Richard, I askedOwen to bring us here—to a place where we would be safe. We can’t all go intothat building to get the antidote.”“I suppose not. That’s a good idea. Owen and I will go; the rest of you can stayhere where no one will spot you.”He started to get up, but Kahlan pushed him back down. “Richard, you have towait here. You can’t go. You’re dizzy. You need to save your strength.”Richard gazed into her green eyes, eyes that always captivated him, always madeeverything else but her seem unimportant. He wished they could be alonesomewhere peaceful, like the home he had built for her back in the mountainswhere he had taken her to recover after she had been hurt... when she had losttheir unborn child after being beaten nearly to death by those brutes.She was the most precious thing alive. She was everything. He wanted so much forher to be safe.“I’m strong enough,” he said. “I’ll be fine.”“If you start coughing in that place where the soldiers are, then you’ll becaught and never get out—much less recover the antidote. You and Owen would bothbe caught. There is no telling how many soldiers are in there. What will happento us if you’re caught? What would happen if...” Her voice trailed off. Shehooked a stray strand of hair behind an ear. “Look, Richard, Owen went in therebefore; he can go in there again.”Richard saw desperation in her eyes. She was terrified of losing him. He hatedthat he was making her afraid.“That’s right, Lord Rahl,” Owen assured him. “I will get the antidote and bringit to you.”“While we’re waiting, you can get some rest,” Kahlan said. “Some sleep would doyou more good than anything else until they bring back the antidote.”Richard couldn’t debate how tired he was. He still didn’t like the idea of notgoing himself.“Tom could go with him,” Cara suggested.Richard looked up into Cara’s blue eyes. He looked up into Kahlan’s eyes. Heknew he had already lost this argument.“How far is this place?” Richard asked Owen.“A goodly distance. Here, we are just at the fringe of the city. I wanted totake us to a place where we would be less likely to encounter soldiers. Theantidote is at most an hour distant. I thought it best if we were not too farinto the city if we had to get back out, but we are close enough so that youwill not have long to wait for the antidote.”Richard nodded. “All right. We’ll wait here for you and Tom.”Kahlan paced in the small, damp basement as the others sat against the wall,waiting in silence. She couldn’t stand the tension. It felt too much like adeathwatch.They were so close that it made it seem impossibly far. They had waited so longthat the small amount of time left seemed an eternity that would never end.Kahlan told herself to calm down. Shortly, Richard would have the antidote. Hewould be better, then. He would be cured of the poison, then.But what if it didn’t work? What if he had already waited so long that he wasbeyond any cure? No, the man who had made the poison and the antidote had toldOwen that this last dose would cure Richard of the poison for good. Because ofthe beliefs of these people, they would be certain that the poison wasreversible. They would never have used it if they believed it would risk a life.But what if what they believed was wrong?Kahlan rubbed her shoulders as she paced, and admonished herself to stopinventing problems to worry about. They had enough real problems without lettingher imagination get carried away. They would get the antidote and then theywould address the problem with Richard’s gift. After that, they had to turntheir attention to larger issues of Jagang and his army.When Kahlan glanced over and saw that Richard had fallen sound asleep, shedecided to go outside and watch for Owen and Tom. Cara, leaning against the wallbeside Richard, guarding him while he slept, nodded when Kahlan whispered toher, telling her where she was going. Jennsen, seeing that Kahlan was headingfor the door, quietly followed her out. Betty had fallen asleep beside Richard,so Jennsen left her there.The moonlit night had cooled. Kahlan thought she should be sleepy, but she waswide awake. She followed the brick path out between the buildings toward thealley.“Owen will be back soon,” Jennsen said. “Try not to worry. It will be over,soon.”Kahlan glanced over in the dark. “Even after he has the antidote, we still havehis gift to worry about. Zedd is too far. We’re going to have to get to Nicciright away. She is the only one close enough that might know what to do to helphim.”“Do you think the trouble with his gift is getting worse?”Kahlan was haunted by the pain she so often saw in his eyes. But there was moreto it.“When he used the sword the last two times I could see that even the sword’smagic had failed him. He’s in more trouble with his gift than he will admit.”Jennsen chewed her lower lip as she watched Kahlan pace. “Tonight he will havethe antidote,” she finally said in soft assurance. “Soon, we can be on our wayto Nicci.”Kahlan turned when she thought she heard a noise in the distance. It had soundedlike the crunch of a footstep. Two dark figures appeared off at the end of thealleyway. By the way one of them towered over the other, Kahlan was pretty surethat it was Tom and Owen. She wanted to run to meet them, but she knew howdeadly tricks could be, so she drew Jennsen back with her around the corner ofthe building, into the darkest part of the shadows. This was no time to getcareless.When the two men reached the narrow walkway and started to turn in. Kahlanstepped out in front of them, prepared to unleash her power if necessary.“Mother Confessor—it’s me, Tom, and Owen,” Tom whispered.Jennsen let out a breath. “Are we ever glad to see you back.”Owen looked both ways down the alley. When he turned to check, Kahlan sawmoonlight reflect off tears running down his face.“Mother Confessor, we have trouble,” Tom said.Owen spread his hands. “Mother Confessor, I, I...”Kahlan grabbed his shirt in both fists. “What’s wrong? The antidote was there,wasn’t it? You have it, don’t you?”“No.” Owen choked back his tears and pulled out a folded piece of paper.“Instead of the bottle of antidote, I found this in its hiding place.”Kahlan snatched it out of his hands. With trembling fingers, she unfolded thepaper. She turned as she held it close so she could read it in the light of themoon.I have the antidote. I also hold by a thread the lives of the people ofBandakar. I can end all their lives as easily as I can end the life of RichardRahl .I will give over the antidote and the lives of all the people in thisempire in exchange for the Mother Confessor.Bring the Mother Confessor to the bridge over the river one mile to the east ofwhere you are. In one hour, if I do not have the Mother Confessor, I will pourthe antidote in the river and then I will see to it that all the people of thiscity die.Signed, Emperor NicholasKahlan, her heart racing out of control, started east.Tom grabbed her arm and held her back. “Mother Confessor, I know what it says.”Kahlan’s hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Then you know why I have no choice.”Jennsen put herself in front of Kahlan to stop her from starting out once again.“What does the letter say?”“Nicholas wants me in exchange for the antidote.”Jennsen put her hands against Kahlan’s shoulders to stop her. “What?”“That’s what the letter says. Nicholas wants me in exchange for the lives ofeveryone else in this empire and the antidote to save Richard’s life.”“The lives of everyone else ... but how could he carry out such a threat?”“Nicholas is a wizard. There are any number of deadly things available to such aman. If nothing else, he could use wizard’s fire and incinerate the entirecity.”“But his magic won’t harm the people here—they’re pristinely ungifted, the sameas me.”“If he uses wizard’s fire to set a building ablaze, like we did to thosesoldiers sleeping back in Owen’s town, it won’t matter to the people inside howthe fire started. Once the buildings catch fire, then it’s just regularfire—fire that will kill anyone. If not that, Nicholas has soldiers here. Hecould immediately start executing people. He could have thousands beheaded inhardly any time at all. I can’t even imagine what else he could do, but he putthis letter where the antidote was hidden, so I know he’s not bluffing.”Kahlan stepped around Jennsen and started out again. She couldn’t make herselfstop trembling. She tried to slow her racing heart, but that didn’t work,either. Richard had to have the antidote. That was what mattered. She focusedher attention ahead as she marched swiftly up the dark street.Tom paced along beside her, opposite Jennsen. “Mother Confessor, wait. We haveto think this out.”“I already have.”“We can take a force of men to the meeting place—take the antidote by force.”Kahlan kept going. “From a wizard? I don’t think so. Besides, if Nicholas wereto see such a force coming he would probably pour the antidote in the river.Then what? We have to do as he demands. We have to get our hands on theantidote, get it safely away from them.”“What makes you think that after Nicholas has you he won’t then pour it in theriver?” Tom asked.“We’ll have to make the exchange in a way that best insures we get the antidote.We aren’t going to rely on his goodwill and honesty. Owen and Jennsen arepristinely ungifted. They won’t be harmed by his magic. They can help make surewe get the antidote in the exchange.”Jennsen pulled her hair away from her face as she leaned close. “Kahlan, youcan’t do this. You can’t. Please, Richard will go crazy—we all will. Please, forhis sake, don’t do this.”“At least he will be alive to go crazy.”Tears streamed down Jennsen’s face. “But this is suicide!”Kahlan watched the buildings, the streets, making sure there were no troops tohem them in. “Let’s hope Nicholas thinks so, too.”“Mother Confessor,” Owen pleaded, “you can’t do this. This is what Lord Rahl hasshown us is wrong. You can’t bargain with a man like Nicholas. You can’t try toappease evil.”“I have no intention of appeasing Nicholas.”Jennsen wiped tears from her cheek. “What do you mean?”Kahlan stiffened her resolve. “What is our best chance of getting rid of theImperial Order in this city—and all of Bandakar? Eliminating Nicholas. Howbetter to get close to him than to make him think he has won?”Jennsen blinked in surprise. “You intend to touch him with your power. That’swhat you’re thinking, isn’t it? You think you will have a chance to touch himwith your Confessor power.”“If I get him in my sight, he’s dead.”“Richard would never agree to this,” Jennsen said.“I’m not asking him. This is my decision.”Tom stepped in front of her, blocking the way. “Mother Confessor, I’m sworn toprotect the Lord Rahl, and I understand risking your life to protect him—butthis is different. You may be acting to try to save his life, but at what cost?We would lose too much. You can’t do this.”Owen moved around in front of her, too. “I agree. Lord Rahl will be more thancrazy if you exchange yourself for the antidote.”Jennsen nodded her agreement. “He will kill us all. He will take off our headsfor allowing you to do this.”Kahlan smiled at their tense expressions. She put a hand to the side ofJennsen’s face.“Remember back just after we’d met you, and I told you that there were timeswhen there was no choice but to act?”Jennsen nodded, her tears returning.“This is one of those times. Richard is getting sicker by the day. He’s dying.If he doesn’t get the antidote, he has no chance and will soon be dead. That’sthe truth of the way things are.“How can we let this chance slip away from us? There are no more opportunitiesafter this. Our chances to save him will forever be lost. It will be the end. Idon’t want to live without him. I don’t want the rest of our people to livewithout him.“If I do this, then Richard will live. If Richard lives, then there will stillbe a chance for me, too. I can touch Nicholas with my power, or Richard and therest of you can think of something to do to save me.“But if Richard dies, then our chances end.”“But, Mother Confessor,” Jennsen sobbed, “if you do this, then we’ll loseyou...”Kahlan looked to each face, her anger rising. “If any of you have a better idea,then put words to it. Otherwise, you are risking me losing the only chanceleft.”No one had anything to say. Kahlan was the only one with a realistic plan ofaction. The rest of them had only wishes. Wishing would not save Richard.Kahlan started out once again, hurrying her pace to get there in time."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 57Kahlan paused in the quiet darkness not far from the bridge. She could just makeout what appeared to be a burly man standing on the other side. He was allalone. She couldn’t see his face, or tell what he looked like. She scanned thefar bank of the river, along with the trees and buildings she could make out inthe moonlight, looking for soldiers, or anyone else.Jennsen clutched her arm. “Kahlan... please.” Her voice was choked with tears.Kahlan felt oddly calm. There were no options for her to weigh, so she sufferedno gnawing indecision; there was only one choice. Richard lived, or he died. Itwas as simple as that. The choice was clear.Her mind was made up, and with that came clarity and determination. She couldnow focus on what she was to do.The river through the city was larger than Kahlan had expected. The steep banksto each side, in this area, anyway, were a few dozen feet high and lined withstone blocks. The bridge itself, wide enough for wagons to pass each other, hadtwo arches to make the span and side rails with simple stone caps. The watersbelow were dark and swift. It was not a river she would want to have to try toswim.Kahlan approached as far as the foot of the bridge and stopped. The man on theother side watched her.“Do you have the antidote?” she called over to him.He lifted what looked like a little bottle high above his head. He lowered thearm and pointed to the bridge. He wanted her to come across.“Mother Confessor,” Owen pleaded, “won’t you reconsider?”She gazed into his wet eyes. “Reconsider what? If I will have Richard liverather than let him succumb to the poison? If I will try to kill Nicholas inorder to make it possible to defeat them and for your people to have a betterchance to free themselves? How would I ever live with myself if Richard diedwithout the antidote and I knew there was something I could have done that wouldhave saved him and also have given me a chance to get close enough to Nicholasto eliminate him?“I couldn’t live with myself if I failed to do this.“We are fighting this war to stop people like this, people who bring death uponus, people who want us dead because they cannot stand that we live our lives aswe wish, that we are successful and happy. These people hate life; they worshipdeath. They demand that we do the same and join them in their misery.“As Mother Confessor, I decreed vengeance without mercy against the ImperialOrder. Changing from our course is suicide. I will not reconsider.”“What would you have us tell Lord Rahl?” Tom asked.She smiled. “That I love him, but he knows that.”Kahlan unbuckled her sword belt and handed it to Jennsen. “Owen, come with me.”Kahlan started out, but Jennsen threw her arms around her and hugged herfiercely. “Don’t worry,” she whispered. “We’ll get the antidote to Richard, andthen we’ll come back for you.”Kahlan hugged Jennsen briefly, whispered her thanks, and then started onto thebridge. Owen walked at her side, saying nothing.The man on the far side watched, but stayed where he was.In the center of the bridge, Kahlan stopped. “Bring the bottle,” she calledacross.“Come over here and you can have it.”“If you want me, you will come to the center of the bridge and give the bottleto this man to take back, as Nicholas offered.”The man stood for a time, as if considering. He looked like a soldier. He didn’tmatch the description of Nicholas that Owen had given her. Finally, he startedonto the arch of the bridge. Owen whispered that it looked like the commander hehad seen with Nicholas. Kahlan waited, watching the man walk through themoonlight. He wore a knife at one side and a sword at his other hip.When he had almost reached her, he came to a halt and waited.Kahlan held her hand out. “The note said we were to trade. Me for what Nicholashas.”The man, his crooked nose flattened to the side, smiled. “So we were.”“I am the Mother Confessor. Either give me the bottle or you die here, now.”He pulled the square-sided bottle from his pocket and placed it in her hand.Kahlan saw that it was full of clear liquid. She pulled the cork and smelled it.It had the slight aroma of cinnamon, as had the other bottles of the antidote.“He goes back with this,” Kahlan said to the grim-looking man as she handed Owenthe bottle.“And you come with me,” the man said as he grabbed her wrist. “Or we all die onthis bridge. He may go, as agreed, but if you try to run you will die.”Kahlan glanced to Owen. “Go,” she growled.Owen looked over at the man with black hair, then back to her. He looked like hehad a lot to say, but he nodded and then ran back over the bridge to where Tomand Jennsen stood waiting, watching.When Owen reached the other two, the man said, “Let’s go, unless you’d like todie here.”Kahlan yanked her arm back. When he turned and started out, she followed behindhim as they crossed the rest of the way over the bridge. She scanned the shadowsamong the trees on the far side of the river, the thousand hiding places amongbuildings beyond, the streets in the distance. She didn’t see anyone, but thatdidn’t really make her feel any better.Nicholas was there, somewhere, hiding in the darkness, waiting to have her.Suddenly, the night lit up from behind. Kahlan spun and saw the bridge envelopedin a boiling ball of flame. The fire turned black as it billowed up. Stonessailed into the air above the inferno. As the luminous cloud rose, she could seethe bridge beneath the roaring fireball crumpling. The arches caved in onthemselves and the entire structure began the long drop into the river.With icy dread, Kahlan wondered if there were any more bridges across the river.How would she get back to Richard if she succeeded? How was help going to get toher if she didn’t?On the far side, Kahlan could see Tom, Jennsen, and Owen running back up theroad toward where Richard slept. They were not about to waste time watching abridge being destroyed. At the thought of Richard, Kahlan almost let out a sob.The man unexpectedly shoved her. “Move.”She glared at him, at his self-satisfied smile, at the smug confidence she sawin his eyes.As she walked ahead of this man and he occasionally shoved her, Kahlan’s temperwas on a low boil. She had the urge to use her power and take out the despicablebrute, but she had to concentrate on the task at hand: Nicholas.Walking up the street leading away from the river, she was just able to make outsoldiers hanging back in the shadows on the dark side streets, blocking everyescape route. It didn’t matter. At the moment, she wasn’t interested in escape,but in her objective. The man behind her, as arrogantly as he was behaving, wasalso wary and treated her with cautious contempt.The farther she walked into the city on the far side of the river, the closerthe clusters of small buildings were packed together. Side streets of narrowtwisting warrens ran off among the ramshackle structures. What trees there weregrew crowded in close to the street. Their branches hung out over her like armsraised to snatch her in their claws. Kahlan tried not to think about how deepshe was getting into enemy territory, and how many men were surrounding her.The last time she had been surrounded and trapped by such savage men she hadbeen beaten and bad come perilously close to dying. Her unborn child had died.Her child. Richard’s child.She had also lost a kind of innocence that day, a simplistic sense of herinvincibility. In its place had come the understanding of how frail life was,how frail her own life was, and how easily it could be lost. She knew how muchit had hurt Richard to fear he might lose her. She remembered the terrible agonyin his eyes every time he had looked at her. It was completely different fromthe pain she saw in his eyes from his gift. It had been a helpless suffering forher. She hated the thought of that pain returning to haunt him.From the shadows to the right side, a man stepped out from behind a building. Hewore black robes, covered in layers of what looked like strips of cloth, almostas if he were covered in black feathers. They lifted in the breeze created byhis stride, lending him an unsettling, floating fluidity as he moved.His hair was slicked back with oils that glistened in the moonlight. Close-set,small black eyes rimmed in red peered out at her from an altogether unwholesomeface. He held his wrists to his chest, as if he were holding back claws tippedwith black fingernails.Kahlan needed no introduction to know that this was Nicholas the Slide. She hadtaken confessions from men who appeared to be no more than polite young men,working fathers, or kindly grandfathers but in truth were men who had carriedout acts of ruthless cruelty. To look at them behind their bench where they madeshoes, or behind a counter where they sold bread, or in a field tending theiranimals it would be difficult to believe them capable of their vile crimes. Butlooking at Nicholas, Kahlan saw such utter corruption that it tainted everythingabout the man, right down to the indecent squint of his eyes.“The prize of prizes,” Nicholas hissed. He reached out, making a fist. “And Ihave her.”Kahlan hardly heard him. She was already lost to the commitment of wielding herpower. This was the man who held the lives of innocent people hostage. This wasthe man who brought suffering and death in his shadow. This was the man whowould kill her and Richard, if given the chance.She snatched his outstretched wrist capped with his fist.He appeared no more than a statue before her.The night, sprinkled with a vault of stars, seemed cold and distant.Beneath her grip of him, Kahlan could feel Nicholas tense, as if to draw backhis arm. But it was too late.He had no chance. He was hers.Time was hers.The men all around, who had begun rushing in, were far too distant to matter.They could never reach her in time to save Nicholas. Not even the man who hadbrought her from the bridge, who now stood not more than a few paces away, wasclose enough to matter.Time was hers.Nicholas was hers.She gave no thought to what those men would do to her. Right then, it didn’tmatter. Right then, nothing but her ability to do what needed doing mattered.This man had to be eliminated.This was the enemy.This was the man who had invaded a land to torture, rape, and murder innocentpeople in the name of the Imperial Order. This was a man who had been mutated bymagic into a monster designed to destroy them. This man was a tool of conquest,a being of evil.This was the man who held Richard’s life in the balance.The power within raged to be released.All her emotions evaporated before the heat of that power. She no longer feltfear, hate, anger, horror. The emotions behind her reasons were now gone. In theall-consuming race of time suspended before the violent rush of her power, shefelt only a resolute determination. Her power had become an instrument of purereason.All her barriers fell before it.In an infinitesimal spark of time as she watched the beady eyes staring at her,her power became all.As she had done countless times before, Kahlan released her restraint on it, andreleased herself into the flux of violence focused to a singular purpose.Where she should have felt the exquisite release of merciless force, she feltinstead a terrifying emptiness. Where there should have been the fierce twistingof her power through this man’s mind, there was ... nothing.Kahlan’s eyes went wide as she gasped.As she felt hot pain knife through her.As she felt the thrust of something foreign and terrible beyond anything shecould have imagined.Hot agony lanced through her consciousness all the way into her very soul.It felt as if her insides were being ripped apart.She tried to scream but couldn’t.The night went blacker still.Kahlan heard laughter echoing through her soul."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 58Richard’s eyes popped open. He felt suddenly, completely, horrifyingly wideawake.The hair at the back of his neck lifted. It felt as if all his hair wanted tostand on end. His heart raced nearly out of control.He shot to his feet. Cara, right beside him, caught his arm, surprised to seehim suddenly stand up. Looking as if she feared he might fall, she frowned inconcern.“Lord Rahl, what’s the matter? Are you all right?”The room was silent. Startled faces all around stared up at him.“Get out!” he yelled. “Get your things! Everyone out! Now!”Richard snatched up his pack. He didn’t see Kahlan, but saw her pack and grabbedit as well. He wondered if he might still be dreaming. But he never rememberedhis dreams. He wondered if the feeling might be some lingering dread from adream. No. It was real.At first made confused and indecisive by Richard’s sudden commands, when the mensaw him urgently picking up his gear, everyone scooped up their things andscrambled to their feet. Men everywhere were snatching anything they saw lyingabout, no matter whose it was.“Move!” Richard yelled as he pushed hesitant men toward the door. “Go. Move,move, move.”It felt as if something brushed against him, a sliding caress of his flesh,something warm and wicked. Goose bumps tingled up his arms.“Hurry!”Men scrambled wildly up the dark stairs ahead of him. Betty, caught up in themood of panicked escape, shot between his legs and ran up the steps. Cara wasclose behind him.The hair at the nape of his neck prickled as if lightning was about to strike.Richard scanned the dark, empty room.“Where’s Kahlan and Jennsen?”“They went outside before,” Cara said.“Good. Let’s go!”Just as Richard reached the top of the stairs, a fiery blast from back in theroom knocked him sprawling. Cara fell on his legs. The stairwell lit in a flashof yellow and orange light as the entire basement filled with flames. Gouts offire rolled up the stairwell.Richard seized Cara’s arm and dove with her through the open doorway. As theyburst out into the night, the building behind them erupted in a thunderous roarof flames. Parts of the building broke apart, lifting in the billowing blaze.Richard and Cara ducked as flaming boards fell all around them, bouncing andflipping across the ground lit by the glow.Finally away from the burning building, Richard made a quick appraisal of thealley, looking to see if there were any soldiers about to set upon them. Notseeing anyone he didn’t recognize, he started the men moving down the alley toput some distance between them and the burning building.“We have to get away from here,” Richard told Anson. “Nicholas knew we werehere. The fire will draw attention and troops. We haven’t much time.”Looking around, he still didn’t see Kahlan anywhere. His concern rising, hespotted Jennsen, Tom, and Owen running up the alley toward him. By the looks ontheir faces, he immediately knew that something was wrong.Richard seized Jennsen’s arm as she ran up close. “Where’s Kahlan?”Jennsen gulped air. “Richard—she, she—”Jennsen burst into tears. Owen waved a square-sided bottle and a piece of paper,as he, too, wept uncontrollably.Richard looked at Tom, expecting an answer, and fast. “What’s going on?”“Nicholas found the antidote. He offered it in trade... for the MotherConfessor. We tried to stop her, Lord Rahl—I swear we did. She wouldn’t listento any of us. She insisted that she was going to get the antidote and then stopNicholas. After you have the antidote, if she fails to stop Nicholas and return,she wants you to come for her.”The leaping flames lit the grim faces around him.“Once her mind is made up,” Tom added, “there’s no talking her out of it. Shehas a way of making you do as she says.”Richard knew the truth of that. Amid the roar and crackle of the fire, thebuilding groaned and popped. The roof began to fall in, sending showers ofsparks skyward.Owen urgently handed the square-sided bottle to Richard. “Lord Rahl, she did itto get the antidote. She wanted you to have it so you could be well. She saidthat comes first—before it is too late.”Richard pulled the cork on the bottle. It had the slight aroma of cinnamon. Hetook the first swallow, expecting a thick, sweet, spicy taste. It didn’t tastethat way at all.He looked at Jennsen’s and Owen’s faces. “This is water.”Jennsen’s eyes went wide. “What?”“Water. Water with a little cinnamon in it.” Richard poured it on the ground.“It’s not the antidote. She traded herself to Nicholas for nothing.”Jennsen, Owen, and Tom stood in mute shock.Richard felt a kind of detached calm. It was over. It was the end of everything.He now had a limited amount of time to do what had to be done ... and theneverything was at an end for him.“Let me see this note,” he said to Owen.Owen handed it over. Richard had no trouble reading by the light coming from thefire. As Cara, Tom, Jennsen, and Owen watched, he read it over three times.Finally, his arm lowered. Cara snatched the note away and read it for herself.Richard gazed up the alleyway at the burning building, trying to figure it out.“How did Nicholas know that someone was coming for the antidote? He said we hadan hour. How did he know we were here, this close, and coming for it, in orderto write in the note that he gave us an hour?”“Maybe he didn’t,” Cara said. “Maybe he wrote the note days ago. Maybe he justwrote that to make us rush without thinking.”“Maybe.” Richard gestured behind him. “But how did he know we were here?”“Magic?” Jennsen offered.Richard didn’t like the idea that Nicholas apparently knew so much and wasalways one step ahead of them.“How did you know that Nicholas was about to set this place ablaze?” Cara askedhim.“I woke suddenly,” Richard said. “My headache was gone and I just knew we had toget out at once.”“So your gift worked?”“I guess so. It does that—it works sometimes to warn me.”He wished he could somehow make it more dependable. At least this time it hadbeen, or they would all be dead.Tom peered out into the night. “So, you think Nicholas is close? That he knewwhere we were and set the place afire?”“No. I think he wants us to believe he’s close. He’s a wizard. He could havesent wizard’s fire from a great distance. I’m no expert on magic; he might haveused some other means to set the fire from a distance.”Richard turned to Owen. “Take me to this building where you hid the antidote,where Nicholas was when you first saw him.”Without hesitation, Owen started out. The rest of the small group followed afterhim.“Do you think she will be there?” Jennsen asked.“There’s only one way to find out.”By the time they reached the river they were out of breath. Richard was furiousto find the bridge gone, with stone blocks from it scattered on the banks farbelow; the rest of it had apparently vanished beneath the dark water. Owen andsome of the other men said that there was another bridge farther to the north,so they took off in that direction, following the road that twisted along besidethe river.Before they reached the bridge, a knot of soldiers rushed out from a side streetwith weapons raised, yelling battle cries.The night rang with the distinctive sound of Richard’s sword being drawn. Whilethe blade was free, its magic was not. With the heart-pounding threat, it didn’tmatter. Richard had anger to spare and met the enemy with a cry of his own.The first man lunged. Richard’s strike was so violent it cleaved the burly mandown through the leather armor over his shoulder to his opposite hip. As Richardspun without pause to a soldier coming at him from behind, he brought the swordaround with such speed that the man was beheaded before he had cocked his swordarm. Richard drew his elbow back, smashing the face of a man rushing in to stabhim from behind. A quick thrust took down another man before Richard could turnto finish the man behind, who had dropped to his knees, his hands covering hisbleeding face. A moonlit flash of Richard’s sword brought measured death.Tom slashed through the men at the same time as Cara’s Agiel took others down.Cries of surprised pain shattered the quiet of the night. All the while, Richardswept through the enemy like a wind-borne shadow.In mere moments, the night was again silent. Richard, Tom, and Cara hadeliminated the enemy squad before any of their men could react to the threatthat had come out of the darkness. Scarcely had they caught their breath whenRichard was already charging onward to the bridge.When they reached it, two slouching Imperial Order soldiers stood guard, pikesstanding upright. The guards seemed to be surprised that people would be runningtoward them at night. Probably because the people of Bandakar had never beforedared to cause them any trouble, the two guards stood watching Richard comeuntil he pulled his sword from behind and took them down with a rapid thrust tothe first man and a powerful sweeping slice that cut the second in two alongwith the pike standing at his side.The small company raced unopposed across the bridge and into the darkness amongthe crowded buildings. Owen directed Richard at every turn as they rushed onwardtoward the place where Owen had hidden the antidote and where he had recovered,instead of the antidote, the note demanding Kahlan in exchange for Richard’slife, in exchange for the lives of an empire naked to the dark talents ofNicholas the Slide.In the somber heart of the city made up of small, squat, mostly single-storybuildings, Owen pulled Richard to a stop. “Lord Rahl, down here, at the corner,we turn to the right. A short distance beyond is a square where people oftengather. At the far end of the square will be a building taller than those aroundit. That is the place. Down a small street to the side of it, there will be analleyway that runs behind the building. That is the way I got in, before.”Richard nodded. “Let’s go.”Without waiting to see if the tired men were with him, he started out, keepingin close to the buildings, to the shadows cast by the moon. Richard moved aroundthe building at the corner. Hung over a small front window was a carved signdisplaying loaves of bread. It was still too early for the baker to be at work.Richard looked up and froze. There before him was the square with trees andbenches. The building across the open square was in ruin. Only smolderingtimbers remained. A small crowd had gathered around, watching what had hours agoobviously been a large fire.“Dear spirits,” Jennsen whispered in horror. She covered her mouth, fearing tospeak aloud the worry on everyone’s mind.“She wouldn’t be in there,” Richard said in answer to the unspoken fear.“Nicholas wouldn’t take her back here just to kill her.”“Then why do this?” Anson asked. “Why burn the place down?”Richard watched the wisps of smoke slowly curling up into the cool night air, athis hopes disappearing. “To send me a message that he has her and I’ll not findher.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said under her breath, “I think we had better get out ofhere.”From the darkness around the building that had burned down, Richard could juststart to make out the sight of soldiers by the hundreds, no doubt waiting tocatch them.“I feared as much,” Owen said. “That’s why I brought us in by such a circuitousroute. See that road over there, where all the soldiers are? That’s the roadcoming from the bridge we crossed.”“How do they always know where we are, or where we will be?” Jennsen whisperedin frustration. “And when?”Cara grabbed Richard’s shirt and started pulling him back. “There are too many.We don’t know how many more are around us. We need to get out of here.”Richard was loath to admit it, but she was right.“We have men waiting for us,” Tom reminded him. “And a lot more coming.”Richard’s mind raced. Where was she?Finally he nodded. The instant he did, Cara took him by his arm and they dashedoff into the darkness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 59Under the sweep of stars, Richard willed himself to stand up straight and tallbefore all the men gathered beneath the spreading branches of the oak trees atthe forest’s edge. A few candles burned among the gathering so they could allsee. By the time they charged into the city of Northwick to make their attack,it would just be light.Richard wanted nothing more than to get into the city and find Kahlan, but hehad to use everything he had at hand to help, or he might waste the chance. Hehad to do this, first.Most of these men had never really fought before. Owen and Anson’s men from thetown of Witherton had been there at the first attack on the sleeping houses andhad taken part in the skirmishes there. The rest of the men were from Northwick,where Richard had gone to see the Wise One. They had been in on the clashes withthe soldiers who weren’t poisoned. There had not been a great many enemysoldiers to fight, but the men had done what had to be done. If anything, thoseminor but bloody encounters had served only to make the men more determined,showing them that they could win freedom themselves, that they were in controlof their own destiny.This, though, was different. This was going to be a battle on a scale they hadnot experienced. Worse, it was in a city that had, for the most part, willinglyjoined with the Order’s cause. The populace was not likely to offer much help.Had he more time, Richard might have come up with a better plan that would havechipped away at the enemy’s numbers, first, but there was no time. It had to benow.Richard stood before the men, hoping to give them something to help them carrythe day. He had trouble thinking of anything but finding Kahlan. In order tohave the best chance to save her, he put her from his mind and focused on thetask at hand.“I had hoped we wouldn’t have to do it this way,” he said. “I had hoped we coulddo it in some manner like we’ve done before, with the fire, or the poisoning, sothat none of you would be hurt. We don’t have that option. Nicholas knows we’rehere. If we run, his men will come after us. Some of us might escape ... for awhile.”“We are finished running,” Anson said.“That’s right,” Owen agreed. “We have learned that running and hiding bringsonly greater suffering.”Richard nodded. “I agree. But you must understand that some of us are probablygoing to die, today. Maybe most of us. Maybe all of us. If any of you choose notto fight, then we must know now. Once we go in, we’ll all be depending on eachother.”He clasped his hands behind his back as he paced slowly before them. It was hardto make out their faces in the dim light. Richard knew, too, that his time wasrunning out. His sight would only get worse. His dizziness would only get worse.He knew he was never going to get better.If he was to have a chance to get Kahlan away from the men of the Order, it hadto be at once, with these men or without them.When none said that they wanted to quit, Richard went on. “We need to get totheir commanders for two reasons: to find out where the Mother Confessor isbeing held, and to eliminate them so that they can’t direct their soldiersagainst us.“You all have weapons, now, and in the limited time we’ve had, we’ve done ourbest to teach you how to use them. There’s one other thing you must know. Youwill be afraid. So will I.“To overcome this fear, you must use your anger.”“Anger?” one of the men asked. “How can we bring forth anger when we’re afraid?”“These men have raped your wives, your sisters, your mothers, daughters, aunts,cousins, and neighbors,” Richard said as he paced. “Think about that, when youlook into the enemy’s eyes as they come at you. They have taken most of thewomen away. You all know why. They have tortured children to make you give up.Think about the terror of your children as they screamed in fear and pain, dyingbloody and alone after being mutilated by these men.”The heat of Richard’s anger seeped into his words. “Think about that when yousee their confident grins as they come at you. These men have tortured peopleyou loved, people who never did anything against them. Think about that as thesemen come at you with their bloodstained hands.“These men have sent many of your people away to be used as slaves. Many more ofyour people have been murdered by these men. Think about that, when they come tomurder you, too.“This is not about a difference of opinion, or a disagreement. There can be nodebate or uncertainty about this among moral men. This is about rape, torture,murder.”Richard turned and faced the men. “Think about that, when you face thesebeasts.” He tapped a fist to his chest as he ground his teeth. “And when youface these men, men who have done all these things to you and your loved ones,face them with hate in your hearts. Fight them with hate in your hearts. Killthem with hate in your hearts. They deserve no better.”The woods were silent as the men considered his chilling words. Richard knewthat he had rage enough, and hate enough, to be eager to get at the men of theImperial Order.He didn’t know where Kahlan was, but he intended to find out and to have herback. She had done as she had to in order to get the antidote to save his life.He understood what she had done, and couldn’t fault her for it—that was the kindof woman she was. She loved him just as fiercely as he loved her. She had donewhat she had to do. But he was not going to let her down. She was depending onhim to come for her.The terrible irony was that it had all been for nothing. The antidote she hadmade such a sacrifice to obtain was no antidote at all.Richard looked out at all their faces, so intent on what he had to tell them onthe eve of such a momentous battle, and remembered, then, the words on thestatue at the entrance to this land, the words of the Wizard’s Eighth Rule:Taiga Vassternich.“There is one last thing to tell you,” he said. “The most important thing ofall.”Richard faced them as the leader of the D’Haran Empire, an empire struggling tosurvive, to be free, and told them those two words in their language.“Deserve Victory.”It was just turning light as they charged into the city. Only one of them hadremained behind: Jennsen. Richard had forbidden her from joining the fight.Besides being young and not nearly as strong as the men they would come upagainst, she would only create a tempting target. Rape was a sacred weapon ofthe wicked, and one this enemy used religiously. The men of the Imperial Orderwould rally for such a prize. Cara was different; she was a trained warrior andmore lethal than any of them except Richard.Jennsen hadn’t been pleased to be left behind, but she had understood Richard’sreasons and hadn’t wanted to give him anything else to worry about. She andBetty had remained behind in the woods.A man they had sent out to scout because he knew the area well emerged from aside alley. As they reached him they all moved up against the wall, trying toremain out of sight as best they could.“I found them,” the scout said, trying to catch his breath. He pointed to theright of their route into the city.“How many?” Richard asked.“I think it must be their main force within the city, Lord Rahl. It’s where theysleep. They seem to still be there, as you expected, and not yet up. The placethey’ve taken over contains buildings for city offices and administration. But Ibring troubling news, as well. They are being protected by the people of thecity.”Richard ran his fingers back through his hair. He had to concentrate to keepfrom coughing. He gripped the window frame of the building beside him to helphimself stand.“What do you mean, they are being protected?”“There are crowds of people from the city surrounding the place occupied by thesoldiers. The people are there to protect the soldiers—from us. They are thereto stop us from attacking.”Richard let out an angry breath. “All right.” He turned back to the worried,expectant faces of all the men. “Now, listen to me. We are joined in a battleagainst evil. If anyone sides with evil, if they protect evil men, then they areserving to perpetuate evil.”One of the men looked unsure. “Are you saying that if they try to stop us, wemight have to use force against them?”“What is it these people seek to accomplish? What is their goal? They want toprevent us from eliminating the Imperial Order. Because they hate life, theydespise freedom more than slavery.”With grim determination, Richard met the men’s gazes. “I’m saying that anyonewho protects the enemy and seeks to keep them in power, for whatever reason, hassided with them. It’s no more complicated than that. If they try to protect theenemy or hamper us from doing as we must—kill them.”“But they aren’t armed,” a man said.Richard’s anger flared. “They are armed—armed with evil ideas that seek toenslave the world. If they succeed, you die.“Saving the lives of innocent people and your loved ones—and having far lessloss of life in the end—is best served by crushing the enemy as decisively andquickly as possible. Then there will be peace. If these people try to preventthat, then they are, in effect, siding with those who torture and murder—theyhelp them to live another day to murder again. Such people must not be treatedany differently than what they in truth are: servants of evil.“If they try to stop you, kill them.”There was a moment of silence; then Anson put a fist to his heart. “With hate inmy heart... vengeance without mercy.”Looks of iron determination spread back through the men. They all put fists totheir hearts in salute and took up the pledge. “Vengeance without mercy!”Richard clapped Anson on the side of the shoulder. “Let’s go.”They raced out from the long shadows of the buildings and poured around thecorner. The people off at the end of the street all turned when they spottedRichard’s force coming. More people—men and women from the city—surged into thestreet in front of the compound of buildings the soldiers had taken up asbarracks and a command post. The people looked like a scraggly lot.“No war! No war! No war!” the people shouted as Richard led the men up thestreet at a dead run.“Out of the way!” Richard yelled as he closed the distance. This was no time forsubtlety or discussions; the success of their attack depended in large part onspeed. “Get out of the way! This is your only warning! Get out of the way ordie!”“Stop the hate! Stop the hate!” the people chanted as they locked arms.They had no idea how much hate was raging through Richard. He drew the Sword ofTruth. The wrath of its magic didn’t come out with it, but he had enough of hisown. He slowed to a trot.“Move!” Richard called as he bore down on the people.A plump, curly-haired woman took a step out from the others. Her round face wasred with anger as she screamed. “Stop the hate! No war! Stop the hate! No war!”“Move or die!” Richard yelled as he picked up speed.The red-faced woman shook her fleshy fist at Richard and his men, leading anangry chant. “Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!”On his way past her, gritting his teeth as he screamed with the fury of theattack begun, Richard took a powerful swing, lopping off the woman’s head andupraised arm. Strings of blood and gore splashed across the faces behind hereven as some still chanted their empty words. The head and loose arm tumbledthrough the crowd. A man made the mistake of reaching for Richard’s weapon, andtook the full weight of a charging thrust.Men behind Richard hit the line of evil’s guardians with unrestrained violence.People armed only with their hatred for moral clarity fell bloodied, terriblyinjured, and dead. The line of people collapsed before the merciless charge.Some of the people, screaming their contempt, used their fists to attackRichard’s men. They were met with swift and deadly steel.At the realization that their defense of the Imperial Order’s brutality wouldactually result in consequences to themselves, the crowd began scattering infright, screaming curses back at Richard and his men.Richard’s army did not pause as they tore through the ring of protectors, now onthe run, but continued on to the maze of buildings among grassy open spacesdotted with trees. The soldiers who were outside began to realize that this timethey would have to protect themselves, that the people of the city could nolonger do it for them. These were men used to slaughtering defenseless, docilevictims. For more than a year of occupation they had not had to fight.Richard was the first on them, taking down men on his way into their midst. Caracharged in at his right, Tom at his left, the deadly point of a spear drivinginto soldiers only now pulling free their weapons. These were men used tooverwhelming their cowering opponents with sheer numbers, not with fightingresolute opposition. They did so now, and for their lives.Richard moved through them as if they were statues. They thrust a blade at wherehe had been, while he cut where they were going and met them there withrazor-sharp steel. He came up behind others as they looked both ways, losingtrack of him, only to have him reach around and draw his sword across theirthroats. Others he beheaded before they realized he was about to strike.He wasted no effort with exaggerated movements and wild slashes. He cut withdeadly proficiency. He didn’t try to best men to show them he was better; hesimply killed them. He didn’t give them any chance to fight back; he cut themdown before they could.Now that he was committed to the fight, he was committed to the dance withdeath, which meant one thing: cut. It was his duty, his purpose, his hunger tocut the enemy down quickly, resolutely, and utterly.They were not prepared for this level of violence unleashed.As his men fell on the soldiers, a great cry rose up. As men fell, their screamsfilled the morning.Seeing a man who looked like an officer, Richard wheeled around him and laid hisblade across the man’s throat.“Where is Nicholas and the Mother Confessor?”The man answered by trying to grab Richard’s arm. He wasn’t nearly quick enough.Richard pulled his sword across the man’s throat, nearly severing his head, ashe spun to a man coming at him from behind. The man skidded to a stop in aneffort to avoid Richard’s blade, only to be stabbed through the heart.The battle raged on, moving back between the buildings as they took down thosemen who met the attack. Yet more men, layered in leather, mail, hides, andweapon belts, came out of the barracks at hearing the clash. They werefierce-looking men looking better suited to murder than any men Richard had everseen.As they came onward, Richard seized anyone who looked like an officer. None ofthem were able to give him an answer. None of them knew the whereabouts ofeither Nicholas or Kahlan.Richard had to fight off the dizziness as well as the soldiers. By focusing onthe dance with death and the precepts the sword had taught him in the past, hewas able to surmount the effects of the poison. He knew that such effortscouldn’t long replace the required strength of endurance, but for the moment hewas able to do as he had to.It was somewhat surprising to see how well his men were doing. They helped oneanother as they moved deeper into the enemy lines. By fighting in that way,using one another’s strengths, they were often able to survive together whereone alone would not have.Some of his men had not survived; Richard saw several lying dead. But thesurprised enemy was being slaughtered. The Imperial Order soldiers were notcharged with righteous, resolute determination. Richard’s men were. The Ordersoldiers were little more than a gang of thugs allowed to run loose. They nowfaced men calling them to account. The men of the Order fought a disorderlyattempt to spare their own individual lives, without thought to a coordinateddefense, while Richard’s men fought to a singular purpose of exterminating theenemy’s entire force.Richard heard Cara calling urgently for him from the narrow space between twobuildings. At first, he thought she was in trouble, but when he rounded thecorner he saw then that she had a husky man on his knees. She held his head upby a fistful of his greasy black hair. One ear displayed a row of silver rings.Cara had her Agiel at his throat. Blood ran down his chin.“Tell him!” she yelled at the man when Richard ran up.“I don’t know where they are!”In a fit of fury, Cara slammed the tip of her Agiel to the base of the man’sskull. He flinched, his arms shaking with the shattering shock of pain thatbrought a gasp rather than a scream. His eyes rolled back in his head. Holdinghim by his tangled hair, Cara bent him back over her knee to hold him upright.“Tell him,” she growled.“They left,” he mumbled. “Nicholas left last night. They carried a woman awaywith them, but I don’t know who she was.”Richard went to a knee and grabbed the man’s shirt. “What did she look like?”The man’s eyes were still rolling. “Long hair.”“Where did they go?”“Don’t know. Gone. In a hurry.”“What did Nicholas tell you before he left?”The man’s eyes slowly came into focus. “Nicholas knew you were going to attackat dawn. He told me the route you would take into the city.”Richard could hardly believe what he was hearing. “How could he possibly knowthat?”He hesitated. The sight of Cara’s Agiel made him talk.“I don’t know. Before he left, Nicolas told me how many men you had, told mewhen you would attack, and by which route. He told me to get people from thecity to shield us from your attack. We gathered our most fanatical supportersand told them that you were coming to murder us, that you wanted to make war.”“When did Nicholas leave? Where did he take this woman?”Blood dripped from the man’s chin. “I don’t know. They just left in a hurry lastnight. That’s all I know.”“If you knew we were coming, why didn’t you make a better defense?”“Oh, but we did. Nicholas told me to take care of the city. I assured him thatsuch a small force as yours cannot possibly defeat us.”Something was terribly wrong. “Why not?”For the first time, the man smiled. “Because you don’t know how many men wereally have. Once I knew where your attack was coming, I was able to call in allmy forces.” The man’s smile widened. “Do you hear that horn in the distance?Here they come.” A belly laugh rolled up. “You are about to die.”Richard gritted his teeth. “You first.”With a mighty thrust, he ran his sword through the officer’s heart. The man’seyes widened in shock. Richard gave the blade a twist as he withdrew it to besure the job was done.“We’d better get the men out of here,” Richard said as he took Cara’s arm andran for the corner of the buildings.“Looks like we’re too late,” she said when they came out from behind cover andsaw the legions of men pouring in all around them.How did Nicholas know when and where they were going to attack? There had beenno one around—no races, not so much as a mouse had been there when they had madetheir plans as they moved through the countryside. How could he have known?“Dear spirits,” Cara said. “I didn’t think they had this many men in Bandakar.”The roar of the soldiers was deafening as they charged in. Richard was alreadyspent. Each deep breath he pulled was agonizingly painful. He knew that therewas no choice.He had to find a way to get to Kahlan. He had to hold out at least that long.Richard whistled in a signal to gather his men. As Anson and Owen ran up.Richard looked around and saw most of the others.“We have to try to break out of here. There’s too many of them. Stay together.We’re going to try to punch through. If we make it, scatter and try to make itback to the forest.”With Cara at one side, Tom at the other, Richard charged at the head of his mentoward the enemy lines. Thousands of the Imperial Order soldiers poured out fromthe city around them and into the open. It was a frightening sight. There wereso many that it almost seemed as if the ground itself were moving.Before Richard reached the soldiers, the morning suddenly lit with blindingblasts of fire. Thunderous eruptions of flame tore through the enemy lines,killing men by the hundreds. Sod, trees, and men were hurled into the air. Men,their clothes, hair, and flesh burning, tumbled across the ground.Richard heard a howl coming from behind. It sounded somehow familiar. He turnedjust in time to see a roiling ball of liquid yellow flame wailing through theair toward them. It expanded as it came, tumbling with seething, deadlyintensity.Wizard’s fire.The incandescent, white-hot inferno roared by just overhead. Once past Richardand his men, it descended, crashing down among the enemy soldiers, spilling aflood of liquid death out among them. Wizard’s fire stuck to what it touched,burning with ferocious intensity. A single droplet of it would burn down througha man’s leg to the bone. It was horrifyingly deadly. It was said to be soexcruciatingly painful that those who lived longed only for death.The question was, who was it coming from?To the other side, men of the Order fell as something scythed through theirranks. It almost looked as if a single blade cut them down by the hundreds,ripping them apart with bloody ferocity. But who was doing it?There was no time to stand around and wonder. Richard and his men had to turn tomeet the soldiers who made it through the devastating conjuring. Now that theirnumbers had been so thinned, the Imperial Order soldiers were unable to mount aneffective attack. Their charge fell apart on the blades of Richard’s men.As they fought, more deadly fire came in to catch those trying to run, or thosewho massed to attack. In other places, Order soldiers fell without Richard orhis men touching them. They gasped in great agony, clutching their chests, andfell dead.Before long, the morning fell silent but for the groans of the wounded.Richard’s men rallied around him, unsure of what had happened, worried thatwhatever had befallen these men might suddenly turn and befall them as well.Richard realized that they didn’t see the attack of wizard’s fire and magic inthe same way as he did; to them it must seem a miracle of salvation.Richard spotted two people beside one of the buildings off to the side of thegrounds. One was taller than the other. He squinted, trying to make them out,but he just couldn’t see who they were. With a hand on Tom’s shoulder forsupport, they headed toward the two figures.“Richard, my boy,” Nathan said when Richard made it over to him. “So good tofind you well.”Ann, a squat woman in a plain gray dress, smiled that knowing smile of hers, sofilled with joy, satisfaction, and at the same time a kind of knowing tolerance.“I doubt you two could imagine how glad I am to see you,” Richard said, stillcatching his breath, trying not to breathe too deeply. “But what are you doinghere? How in the world did you find me?”Nathan leaned in with a sly smile. “Prophecy, my boy.”Nathan wore high boots and a ruffled white shirt with a vest and an elegantgreen velvet cape attached at his right shoulder. The prophet cut quite thefigure.Richard saw then that Nathan was wearing an exquisite sword in a polishedscabbard. It seemed to Richard rather odd for a wizard who could commandwizard’s fire to carry a sword. It seemed even more odd to see the man abruptlydraw the weapon.Ann suddenly gasped as someone sprang from behind the building and grabbed her.It was one of the people from the city who had gathered to protect the army—atall, slender, pinched-faced woman with a formidable scowl and a long knife.“You are murderers!” she cried, her straight hair whipping side to side. “Youare filled with hate!”The ground around Ann and the woman erupted, chunks of dirt and grass flying upinto the air. Ann, a sorceress, was apparently trying to fight off her attacker.The woman was unaffected. Against a pristinely ungifted person, magic wasn’tworking.Nathan, not far to the side of Ann, stepped in and without ado ran the tallwoman through with his sword. The woman staggered back, his sword through herchest, her face a picture of surprise. She dropped, sliding off the red blade.Ann, free of her attacker, glanced at the dead woman. She fixed Nathan in ascowl. “Dashing indeed.”Nathan smiled at her private joke. “I told you, they aren’t touched by magic.”“Nathan,” Richard said, “I still don’t understand—”“Come here, my dear,” Nathan said, signaling off behind him.Jennsen ran out from behind the building. She threw her arms around Richard.“I’m so glad you’re all right,” she said. “I hope you aren’t angry with me.Nathan showed up in the woods not long after you and the men left. I rememberedseeing him before—at the People’s Palace in D’Hara. I knew he was a Rahl, so Itold him the trouble we were in. He and Ann wanted to help. We came as fast aswe could.”Jennsen looked expectantly up at Richard. He answered her worry with a hug.“You did the right thing,” he told her. “You used your head for something theorders didn’t anticipate.”Now that the heat of battle had ended, Richard was dizzier than ever. He had tolean on Tom for support.Nathan put a shoulder under Richard’s other arm. “I hear you’re having troublewith your gift. Maybe I can help.”“I don’t have time. Nicholas the Slide has Kahlan. I have to find her or—”“Don’t play a fool when you aren’t,” Nathan said. “It won’t take long to bringyour gift into harmony. You need the help of another wizard to get it undercontrol—like the last time I helped you—or you won’t be of any use to anyone.Come on, let’s get you inside one of these places where it’s quiet. Then I cantake care of that much of your troubles.”Richard wanted nothing more than to find Kahlan, but he didn’t know where tolook. He felt like falling into the man’s arms and surrendering his destiny tohim, to his experience, to his vast knowledge. Richard knew Nathan was right. Hefelt like crying with relief that help was finally at hand. Who better to helphim get his gift back under control than a wizard?Richard had never even dared to hope to have this opportunity; he had planned ontrying to get to Nicci because she was the only one he could think of who mightknow what to do. This was infinitely better than a sorceress helping him.A wizard was the only one really meant to help with this kind of trouble withanother wizard’s gift.“Just make it quick,” he told Nathan.Nathan smiled that Rahl smile of his. “Come on, then. We’ll have your gift backto right in no time at all.”“Thank you, Nathan,” Richard mumbled as he let the big man help him through anearby doorway."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 60Richard sat cross-legged on the wood floor facing Nathan. The barren room had nofurniture. Nathan said none was needed, that the floor was fine with him. Ann,not far away, sat on the floor as well. Richard was a little surprised thatNathan was allowing her to observe, but didn’t question it. There was thepossibility that he might want to have her help for some part of it.Everyone else waited outside. Cara wasn’t happy about allowing Richard out ofher sight, but Richard calmed her concern by telling her that he would feel morecomfortable and able to concentrate on correcting the problem with his gift ifhe knew she was outside keeping an eye on everything for him.The two windows had been shuttered, allowing in only dim light and keeping outmost of the noise. With his hands on his knees, the prophet pushed his backstraighter and, drawing a deep breath, seemed to pull an aura of authorityaround himself. Nathan was the one who had first taught Richard about his gift,telling him how war wizards, like Richard, weren’t like other wizards. Insteadof tapping the core of power within themselves, they directed their intentthrough their feelings.It had been a difficult concept to grasp. Nathan had told Richard that his powerworked through anger.“Lose yourself in my eyes,” Nathan said in a quiet voice.Richard knew he had to try to put his worry for Kahlan aside.Trying to keep his breathing steady so as not to cough, he stared into Nathan’shooded, deep, dark, azure eyes. Nathan’s gaze drew him in. Richard felt as if hewere falling up into the clear blue sky. His breath came in ragged pulls, andnot of his own doing. He felt Nathan’s commanding words more than heard them.“Call forth the anger, Richard. Call forth the rage. Call forth the hate andfury.”Richard’s head was swimming. He concentrated on calling his anger. He thoughtabout Nicholas having Kahlan and he had no trouble summoning rage.He could feel another force within his own, as if he were drowning and someonewere trying to hold his head above water.He drifted, alone, in a dark and still place. Time seemed to mean nothing.Time.He had to get to Kahlan in time. He was her only chance.Richard opened his eyes. “Nathan, I’m sorry, but...”Nathan was drenched in sweat. Ann was sitting beside him, holding Richard’s lefthand, Nathan his right. Richard wondered what had happened.Richard looked from one face to the other. “What’s wrong?”They both looked grim. “We tried,” Nathan whispered. “I’m sorry, but we tried.”Richard frowned. They had only just begun.“What do you mean? Why are you giving up so soon?”Nathan cast a sidelong glance at Ann. “We’ve been at it for two hours. Richard.”“Two hours?”“I’m afraid there is nothing I can do, my boy.” By the sound of his voice, hemeant it.Richard ran his fingers back through his hair. “What are you talking about?You’re the one who told me the last time, when I had this problem, joining witha wizard would set it straight. You said it was a simple matter for a wizard tofix such a disharmony with the gift.”“That’s the way it should be. But your gift is somehow tangled up into a knotthat’s strangling you.”“But you’re a prophet, a wizard. Ann, you’re a sorceress. Together you bothprobably know more about magic than anyone who has lived in thousands of years.”“Richard, there has not been another born like you in the last three thousandyears. We don’t know that much about how your particular gift works.” Ann pausedto push stray strands of gray hair back into the bun at the back of her head.“We tried, Richard. I swear to you, we both tried our best. Your gift is beyondNathan’s help, even with my ability enhancing his power. We tried everything weknow, and even a few things we thought up. None of it had any effect. We cannothelp you.”“So, what must I do?”Nathan’s azure eyes turned away. “Your gift is killing you, Richard. I don’tknow the cause, but I’m afraid that it has spiraled into a phase that is out ofcontrol and fatal.”Ann’s eyes were wet. “Richard ... I’m so sorry.”Richard looked from one distraught face to the other.“I guess it doesn’t really matter,” Richard said.Nathan frowned. “What do you mean it doesn’t matter?”Richard rose up, groping for the wall to keep his balance. “I’ve been poisoned.The antidote is gone... There is no cure. I’m afraid that I’m running out oftime. I guess the joke is on my gift—something else is going to get me first.”Ann stood and gripped his upper arms. “Richard, we can’t help you right now, butyou can at least rest while we try to figure out—”“No.” Richard waved off her concern. “No. I can’t waste what little time I haveleft. I have to get to Kahlan.”Ann cleared her throat. “Richard, at the Palace of the Prophets, Nathan and Iwaited for your birth for a very long time. We worked to clear those obstaclesthat Prophecy showed us lay in your path. The prophecies name you as central tothe course of the future of the world. In fact, they say you are the only onewith a chance; we need you to lead us in this battle.“We don’t know what is wrong with your gift, but we can work on it. You must behere so that if we come up with a solution, we can set your power right.”“I’ll not live for you to cure me. Don’t you see? The poison is killing me. Ithas three states. I’m already entering the third state: blindness. I’m going todie. I must use what time I have left to find Kahlan. You aren’t going to haveme to lead you, but if I can get her away from Nicholas, you will have her tolead the struggle in my place.”“You know where she is, then?” Nathan asked.Richard realized that in the state of focused, concentrated thought, as he wasadrift in that quiet place while Nathan was trying to help him, it had come tohim where Nicholas most likely had taken Kahlan. He had to get there whileNicholas was still there with her.“Yes, I believe I do.”Richard pulled open the door. Cara, sitting right outside, shot to her feet. Herexpectant expression quickly withered when he shook his head, signaling that ithadn’t worked.“We have to get going. Right away. I think I know where Nicholas took Kahlan. Wehave to hurry.”“You know?” Jennsen asked, holding Betty close by the rope.“Yes. We need to leave at once.”“Where is she, then?” Jennsen asked.Richard gestured. “Owen, remember how you told us about a fortified encampmentthe Imperial Order built when they first came to Bandakar and they were worriedabout their safety?”“Back near my town,” Owen said.Richard nodded. “That’s right. I think Nicholas took Kahlan there. It’s a secureplace they built to hold some of the women captive. There would be plenty ofsoldiers to protect him and it’s the kind of place built specifically to bedefensible, so it would be much more difficult to approach than his place, here,in the city.”“Then how will we approach it?” Jennsen asked.“We’ll have to figure that out once we get there and see the place.”Nathan joined Richard at the door. “Ann and I will go with you. We might be ableto help rescue Kahlan from the Slide. While we travel the two of us can work ona solution for untangling your gift.”Richard gripped Nathan’s shoulder. “There are no horses in this land. If you canrun and keep up with us, you’re welcome, but I can’t afford to slow for you. Idon’t have much time, and neither does Kahlan. Nicholas will not likely hold herthere long. After he pauses for rest and supplies and then leaves this land, itwill be even more difficult to find him. We have no time to lose. We’re going tohave to travel as swiftly as possible.”Nathan’s eyes turned down in disappointment.Ann drew Richard into a brief hug. “We’re far too old to keep up the speed afootthat you and these young people can. When you get her away from the Slide, comeback and we’ll do our best to help you. We’ll work on the problem while you’regetting her out of his clutches. Come back then, and we’ll have a solution.”Richard knew that he would never live that long, but there was no point insaying it. “All right. What can you tell me about a Slide?”Nathan drew his thumb along his jaw as he considered the question. “Slides aresoul stealers. There is no defense against them. Even I would be powerless tostop them.”Richard didn’t suppose that needed any explanation. “Cara, Jennsen, Tom, you cancome with me.”“What about us?” Owen asked.Anson stood close by, looking eager to be included, and nodded at Owen’ssuggestion. There were others as well, who had stood vigil outside the placewhere Nathan had tried to help Richard. They were all men who had fought hard.If he was to get Kahlan back, he would likely need some men, at least.“Your help would be welcome. I think most of the men should stay here withNathan and Ann. The people here in Hawton need to have you men explaineverything to them—help them to understand all that you’ve learned. They willneed to make some changes to adjust to interacting with the world out there nowopen to them.”As Richard started away, Nathan grabbed ahold of his sleeve. “Richard, as far asI know, you have no defense against a soul stealer, but there is one thing Irecall from an old tome in the vaults in the Palace of the Prophets.”“I’m listening.”“They somehow travel outside their body ... send their own spirit out.”Richard rubbed his fingertips across his brow as he thought about Nathan’swords. “That has to be how he was watching me, tracking me. I believe he watchedme through the eyes of huge birds that live here, called black-tipped races. Ifwhat you’re saying is right, then maybe he leaves his body in order to do this.”Richard looked up at Nathan. “How does this help me?”Nathan leaned closer, cocking his head to peer with one azure eye. “That is whenthey are vulnerable—when they are out of their body.”Richard lifted his sword a few inches in the scabbard to be sure it was clear.“Any idea how to catch him outside of his body?” He let the sword drop back.Nathan straightened. “Afraid not.”Richard nodded his thanks anyway and stepped down out of the doorway. “Owen, howfar is this fortified encampment?”“Back close to where the path used to go out through the boundary.”That was why Richard hadn’t seen it; they had come on the ancient route used byKaja-Rang. Ordinarily, it would be a journey of well over a week. They didn’thave nearly that long.He took in all the faces watching him. “Nicholas has quite a head start on usand he will be in a hurry to escape with his prize. If we travel swiftly anddon’t stop long to rest, there’s a good chance we can still catch up with him bythe time he reaches their encampment. We need to be on our way at once.”“We’re only waiting for you, Lord Rahl,” Cara said.So was Kahlan."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 61Each day of hard travel, Richard’s condition worsened, but his fear for Kahlandrove him relentlessly onward. Most of the time, hour after hour, throughsunlight, darkness, and occasional rain, they ran at a steady lope. Richard useda staff he’d cut himself to help keep his balance. When he thought he would beunable to go on, Richard deliberately picked up the pace to remind himself thathe could not give up. They stopped at night only long enough to get a few hours’sleep.The men had trouble keeping up with him. Cara and Jennsen didn’t; they were bothused to strenuous exertion in the course of difficult journeys. All of them,though, were so exhausted from the unrelenting pace that they talked only whennecessary. Richard drove himself doggedly, trying not to think about his ownhopeless condition. It didn’t matter. He reminded himself that with every stepthey ran, if it was fast enough, they were gaining on Nicholas and just thatmuch closer to Kahlan.In moments of despair, Richard told himself that Kahlan had to be alive, thatNicholas could have killed her long ago if that was his intention. He wouldn’thave run if she were dead. Kahlan would be much more valuable to him alive.In a way, he felt an odd kind of relief. He could push as hard as he needed. Hedidn’t have to worry about his health. There was no antidote to the poison.Given the time, it would kill him. There was no solution to the problem of hisgift being out of control; that, too, would kill him. There was nothing Richardcould do about either. He was going to die.The wooded hills were easy enough traveling. They were open, with broad, greenmeadows sprinkled with wildflowers and a patchwork of grassland. Wildlife wasabundant. Were he not dying, in pain, and sick with worry for Kahlan, Richardmight have enjoyed the beauty of the land. Now it was just an obstacle.The sun in his eyes was slipping down behind the towering mountains. Soondarkness would be upon them. A little earlier, Richard had used his bow to takea buck when the opportunity presented itself. Tom had made quick work ofbutchering it. The rest of them needed to eat, or they would not be able to keepup the pace. Richard supposed that they would have to stop for a while to cookthe meat and get some sleep.Owen came up beside Richard as they trotted through a sea of grass rollingbeneath the breeze. Owen pointed ahead. “There, Lord Rahl. That stream comingout of the hills is getting close to the Order’s encampment. Just a littlefarther, over that line of hills and toward the mountains.” He pointed to theright. “Off that way, not far, is my town of Witherton.”Richard changed his course a little to the left, heading for the woods thatstarted at the foot of a gentle rise. They made the trees just as the orangedisc of the sun slipped behind the snowcapped mountains.“All right,” Richard said, coming to a breathless halt as they entered a smallclearing. “Let’s set up camp here. Jennsen, Tom, why don’t you two and the menstay here—get some meat cooking while I go with Owen and Cara to scout thisfortification and see if I can figure out how we’re going to get in.”When Richard started out, using his staff to help balance, Betty startedfollowing him. Jennsen snatched Betty’s rope.“Oh, no you don’t,” Jennsen said. “You’re staying here. Richard doesn’t need youtagging along to attract attention at the worst possible time.”“What should we make for you to eat, Lord Rahl?” Tom asked.Richard couldn’t stand the thought of eating meat. After all the bloodyfighting, he needed to balance his gift more than ever. His gift was killinghim, but if he did the wrong thing it might hasten the end and then he might notlast long enough to get Kahlan away from Nicholas.“Whatever we have that isn’t meat. You have time before we come back, so you cancook some bannock, some rice, maybe some beans.”Tom agreed to take care of it and Richard followed after Owen. Cara, lookingmore unhappy than he could ever remember seeing her, put a hand on his shoulder.“How are you holding up, Lord Rahl?”He dared not tell her how much pain he was in from the gift, or that he hadstarted to cough up blood. “I’m all right for now.”By the time they dragged back into their camp, almost two hours later, the meaton the spit was finished cooking and some of the men had already eaten. Theywere just curling up in blankets to get some sleep.Richard was beyond being tired. He was certain that they had been close toKahlan. It had been agonizing to have to return, to leave the place whereNicholas held her, but he had to use his head. Wild, irrational action wouldbring only failure. It would not get Kahlan out of there.Richard was being driven by needs beyond food or sleep, but as he watched Owensit heavily near the fire, he knew that Owen and Cara were exhausted and heimagined that they had to be hungry. Rather than sit, Cara waited at his side.She would not allow him to get far from her watchful protection. Nor would shevoice any concern for herself or her needs.He could never have imagined, back in the beginning, ever feeling this close toa Mord-Sith.Jennsen stood and rushed to meet him. “Richard—here, let me help you. Come andsit.”Richard flopped down on the grass near the fire. Betty came over and begged aplace beside him. He let her lie down.“Well?” Tom asked. “What do you think of the place?”“I don’t know. It has well-made timber walls with trenches dug before them.There are snares and traps all around the place. It has a gate—a real gate.”Richard sighed as he rubbed his eyes. His sight was getting blurry. It wasgetting more difficult all the time to see things. “I haven’t quite figured itout, yet.”It was hard to think with the smell of the cooking meat. It was making him sick.Richard took a piece of bannock and the bowl of rice and beans Jennsen handedhim.He couldn’t eat while watching them eat the meat or, worse, smelling it.Richard stood. “I’m going to go for a walk.” He didn’t want to make them feelbad about their dinner, or feel guilty for eating meat in front of him. “I needsome time alone to think it out.”Richard gestured for Cara to sit back down and stay where she was.“Get some dinner,” he told her. “I need you to stay strong.”Richard walked off through the trees, listening to the chirp of crickets,watching the stars through the canopy of leaves. It was a relief to be alone,not to have people asking him anything. It was tiring to have people alwaysdepending on him.Richard found a quiet place where an old oak had fallen. He sat and leaned backagainst the trunk. He wished he never had to get up. If not for Kahlan, hewouldn’t.Betty showed up. She stood before him, looking at him intently as if to ask whatthey were going to do next. When Richard said nothing, Betty lay down in frontof him. It occurred to him that maybe Betty just wanted to offer him somecomfort.Richard felt a tear run down his cheek. Everything was falling to pieces. Hecouldn’t hold those pieces together any longer. He could hardly breathe past thelump in his throat.He lay down and put an arm over Betty.“What am I going to do?” He sniffled. He wiped the back of his hand across hisnose.“Kahlan, what am I going to do?” he whispered in forlorn misery. “I need you somuch. What am I going to do?”He was at the end of all hope.He had thought, when he’d seen Nathan unexpectedly arrive, that help was athand. The bright ember of that last hope had been extinguished. Not even apowerful wizard could help him.Powerful wizard.Kaja-Rang.Richard froze.The words sent to him by Kaja-Rang, those two words emblazoned across thegranite base of that statue, echoed through his mind.Those two words were meant for Richard.Taiga Vassternich.Deserve Victory.“Dear spirits...” Richard whispered.He understood."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 62Nicholas watched as Lord Rahl made his way back into the camp among his menafter his despairing whispered last prayer to the dear spirits. So sad. So verysad that the man was going to die. He would soon be with his dear spirits ... inthe Keeper’s realm of the underworld.Nicholas relished the game. The poor Lord Rahl was so lost and confused.Nicholas wished the game could continue for a good long time, but Lord Rahl hadlittle time left. So sad.But it would be much more fun after Lord Rahl died, after that last detail wasfinally finished. Jagang thought this pathetic man was resourceful. Don’tunderestimate him, Jagang had warned. Perhaps Jagang was no match for the greatRichard Rahl, but Nicholas the Slide was.His spirit swelled with delight at the expectant thought of Lord Rahl’s death.That was going to be something to watch. It would be a grand finale of the playof life. Nicholas intended to see it all, to see every sad moment of the lastact. He imagined that Lord Rahl’s friends would gather to weep and wail as theystood by, helpless, watching him slip into the welcoming embrace of death,eternity’s shepherd, come to help him begin the magnificent, never-endingspiritual journey away from the bitter interlude that had been life.The finalcurtain was about to draw closed. Nicholas so loved sad endings. He could hardlywait to watch it played out.Hate to live, live to hate.Nicholas wondered, too, as did Lord Rahl, what would get him first, the poisonor his gift. It seemed to tug first toward one, and then toward the other. For atime the headaches inflicted by his gift nearly put him down; then the poisonwould tighten its pain and make him gasp in agony. It was a fascinatingquestion, one that, as in any good play, would not be answered until the veryend. The tension was delicious.Nicholas was rooting for the gift to win the fatal contest. Poison was all welland good, but what a vastly more intriguing twist of fate it would be to see awizard of Lord Rahl’s ability and potential, a wizard unlike any to be bornsince an era long buried in the dunghill of mankind’s history, succumb to hisbirthright—to his own vast but vain power ... another victim of men reaching toohigh in life. That would be a fascinating and fitting end.Not long to wait.Not long at all.Nicholas watched, not wanting to miss a single delectable detail. With thespirit of Richard Rahl’s lovely bride beside him, as it were, Nicholas feltalmost a part of the family as he attended the approach of such a great man’stragic end.Nicholas felt it only fair that the Mother Confessor should get to see it allplayed out, see the sad end to her beloved. As she watched along with Nicholas,she was suffering seeing the agony of it as Richard Rahl walked back into hiscamp.Nicholas savored her distress. He had not yet begun to make her suffer. He wouldsoon have a very long time with her to explore her capacity for suffering.The people there in the woods around the campfire looked up, curious as theirmaster returned among them. They all waited, with Nicholas, watching, withNicholas, as their Lord Rahl stood over them. His figure wavered in the fire, asit did in Nicholas’s vision. It was almost as if he were already but a spirit,about to drift away into the glorious oblivion of the dead.“I’ve figured it out,” Lord Rahl told them. “I know how to attack thefortification.”Nicholas’s ears pricked up. What was this?“At first light we go in,” Lord Rahl said. “Just as the sun breaks over themountains. Right then, on the east side, we’ll come in over the wall. The guardswon’t be able to see well because the sun will be in their eyes when they lookin that direction. Men don’t look where it’s troublesome to look.”“I like it,” one of the other men said.“So we will sneak in, then, rather than try to attack,” another said.“Oh, no, there will be an attack,” Lord Rahl said. “A big attack. An attack thatwill set their heads to spinning.”What was this? What was this? Nicholas watched, watched, watched. This was mostcurious. First Lord Rahl was going to sneak over the wall, and then he wouldhave his men attack? How was he going to set their heads to spinning? Nicholaswas fascinated.He moved in a little closer, fearing to miss a precious word.“The attack will involve all the rest of you men,” Lord Rahl said. “You will allcome in toward the gate at first light. While you’re attacking through the gateand drawing their attention, I will be slipping over the wall. While you will bethere to distract them, in part, you will play an even more vital role that theywill never expect.”The game was afoot. Nicholas was in rapture as he listened, as he watched. He soliked the game—especially when he knew all the rules, and could bend them to hiswishes. It was going to be a glorious day, tomorrow.“But, Lord Rahl,” the big man, Tom, asked, “how are we going to be able toattack through the gate if it’s as formidable as you say?”Nicholas hadn’t thought of that. How curious. A key part of Lord Rahl’s planseemed to be faulty.“That’s the real trick,” Lord Rahl said. “I’ve already figured it out and you’llbe amazed to hear how you’re going to do it.”He had already figured it out? How curious. Nicholas wanted to hear whatpossible solution could solve such a major hitch in Lord Rahl’s plan.Lord Rahl stretched and yawned. “Look,” he said, “I’m exhausted. I can’t standup anymore. I need to get some rest before I lay it all out for you. It’scomplicated, so I’d better wait until just before we leave.“Wake me up two hours before dawn, and I’ll explain the whole thing, then.”“Two hours before dawn,” Tom repeated in confirmation of the orders.Nicholas was furious. He wanted to hear it now. He wanted to know the wonderful,fabulous, complicated plan.Lord Rahl gestured to his delicious companion, the one named Cara, and then toseveral of the young men. “Why don’t you come with me and get some sleep whilethe rest finish their meal.”As they started away, Lord Rahl turned back. “Jennsen, I want you to keep Bettyhere, with you. Make sure she stays here. I need some sleep; I don’t need thesmell of goat to wake me up.”“Am I going with you in the morning, Richard?” the one called Jennsen asked.“Yes. You play an important part in the plan.” Lord Rahl yawned again. “I’llexplain after I’ve slept. Don’t forget, Tom. Two hours before dawn.”Tom nodded. “I will wake you myself, Lord Rahl.”Nicholas would be there as well, to watch, to hear the final piece of LordRahl’s plan. Nicholas could hardly stand to wait that long. He would be thereearly. He would hear every word of it.And then, Nicholas would have a surprise waiting for Richard Rahl when he andhis men came for a visit.Maybe neither the poison nor his gift would take Lord Rahl.Maybe Nicholas would do it himself.Her spirit a helpless prisoner of the Slide, Kahlan could do nothing but watchalong with him. She was unable to answer Richard’s forlorn pleas, unable to cryin sorrow for him, unable to do anything. She ached to be able to hold him inher arms again, to comfort his pain, his heartache.He was near the end. She knew that. It broke her heart to see his precious lifeslipping away.To see his tears.To hear him cry her name in longing.To hear him say how much he needed her.She felt so cold and alone. She loathed the feeling of being adrift. Shedesperately wanted to be back in her body. It waited somewhere back in a lonelyroom in the fortified encampment. Nicholas’s body waited there, too. If only shecould get back there.Most of all, she wished there were some way she could warn Richard that Nicholasknew his plan."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 63Nicholas lay in wait in the camp, sniffing, listening, watching, eager for thegame to continue. He had come early, fearing to miss anything. He was sure ithad to be two hours before dawn—time for the last act of the play. It was timefor the man, Tom, to wake Lord Rahl. It was time. Watch, watch, watch. Where washe? Somewhere, somewhere. Look, look, look.Men off through the trees stood guard over the camp. Where was Tom? There hewas. Nicholas saw that Tom was one of the men standing vigil as others slept.Didn’t want to be late. Lord Rahl’s orders. He wasn’t sleeping, he was awake, sohe should know it was time.What was the man waiting for? His master had given him a command. Why wasn’t hedoing as he had been told?The woman, Jennsen, woke and rubbed her eyes. She looked up and took appraisalof the stars and moon. It was time—she knew it was. She threw off her blanket.Nicholas followed behind as she rushed past the low glow of the smolderingembers, rushed through the stand of young trees, rushed to the big man leaningagainst a stump.“Tom, isn’t it time to wake Richard?”Somewhere back in a distant room in the fortification, where his body waited,Nicholas heard an insistent noise. He was absorbed in the task at hand, in thegame, so he ignored the sound.Probably Najari. The man was eager to have a chance to get at the MotherConfessor, a chance to enjoy her more feminine charms. Nicholas had told Najarithat he would have his chance, but he had to wait until Nicholas returned.Nicholas didn’t want the man tampering with her body while they were gone.Najari sometimes didn’t know his own strength. The Mother Confessor was valuableproperty and Nicholas didn’t want that property damaged.Najari had proven to be a loyal man and deserved a small reward, but not untillater. He would not disobey Nicholas’s orders. He would be sorry if he did.Maybe it was just—Wait, wait. What was this? Watch, watch, watch. The man stood and put a handreassuringly on the young woman’s shoulder. How very touching.“Yes, I guess it is about time. Let’s go wake Lord Rahl.”Again the noise. Stealthy, sharp yet soft.Most odd. But it would have to wait.Through the woods. Hurry. Watch, watch, watch. Hurry. Couldn’t they move faster?Didn’t they grasp the importance of the occasion? Hurry, hurry, hurry.“Betty,” the Jennsen woman growled, “stop bumping my legs.”Again there was a skulking sound back somewhere with his body.And then, another, more urgent sound.This time, the sound ran a sharp shiver through Nicholas’s very soul.It was as deadly a sound as he had ever heard.As the Sword of Truth cleared its scabbard, the distinctive ring of steel filledthe dimly lit room.With the sword came ancient magic, unhindered, unrestrained, unleashed.The sword’s power instantly inundated Richard with its boundless fury, a furythat answered only to him. The force of that power flooded into every fiber ofhis being. It had been so long since he had truly felt it, truly felt the fullmagnitude of it, that for an instant Richard paused in the exaltation of theprofound experience of simply holding such a singular weapon.His own righteous wrath had already slipped its bounds. Joined now with the purerage of the Sword of Truth, both spiraled through him like twin storms rampagingunchecked.Richard gloried that they could, and at being the ultimate master of both.The Seeker of Truth willed both storms ever onward even as the sword began itsfearsome journey, the merciless lightning of those thunderheads about to strike.The tip of the blade whistled though the night air, still two hours before dawn.Hesitant and uncertain, Nicholas watched as the man, Tom, and the Jennsen womanmoved through the woods to awaken their dying Lord Rahl.Somewhere back in a distant room in the fortification, where his body waited,Nicholas heard a scream.It was not a scream of fear, but a riotous cry of unbridled rage. It sent ashiver through his soul.With sudden alarm, knowing that it could not be ignored, Nicholas slammed backinto his body where it sat on the floor, waiting for him.Unsteady from the abrupt return, Nicholas blinked as he opened his eyes.Lord Rahl himself stood before him, feet spread, both hands gripping his sword.It was a picture of sheer muscular force focused by terrifying resolve.Nicholas’s eyes went wide at seeing the gleaming blade arcing through the stillair.Lord Rahl was in the midst of a scream of startling power and rage. Every bit ofhis might was committed to the swing of his sword.Nicholas had a sudden and completely unexpected realization: he didn’t want todie. He very much wanted to live. As much as he hated life, he realized, now,that he wanted to hold on to it.He had to act.He summoned his power, rallied his will. He had to stop this avenging soulbefore him. He reached out with his power to seize this other’s spirit. He feltthe horrifying shock of a staggering blow against the side of his neck.Richard was still screaming as his sword, with every ounce of power and speed hecould put behind it, swept around, just clearing the top of Nicholas’s leftshoulder.Richard saw every detail as the blade tore through flesh and bone, turningmuscle, tendon, arteries, and windpipe inside out, following with precision thepath to which the Seeker had justly committed it. Richard had dedicatedeverything to the swift journey of his sword. Now, he watched as that journeyreached its destination, as the blade cleared the neck of Nicholas the Slide, asthe man’s head, its mouth still opened in the beginning of shock not fullycomprehended, his beady eyes still trying to grasp the totality of what theywere seeing, lifted into the air, beginning to turn ever so slowly as the swordbelow it passed along its deadly arc, as curved ropes of the man’s blood begantracing a long wet line across the wall behind him.Richard’s scream ended as the sword’s swing reached its limit. The world camecrashing back around him.The head hit the floor with a loud, bone-cracking thunk.It was ended.Richard recalled the rage. He had to get it under control immediately. He hadsomething yet more important to accomplish.In one fluid motion, Richard slid the bloody blade home into its scabbard as heturned to the second body leaned up against the wall to the right.The sight of her almost overcame him. To see her there, alive, breathing,seemingly unhurt, brought a wild rush of joy. His worst fears, fears he wouldnot even allow into his conscious mind, evaporated in an instant.But then he realized that she was not all right. She could not have sleptthrough such an attack.Richard fell to his knees and took her up in his arms. She felt so light, solimp. Her face was ashen and beaded with sweat. Her eyelids were half closed,her eyes rolled back in her head.Richard sank back within himself, seeking strength to bring back the one heloved more than life itself. He opened his soul to her. All he wanted, all heneeded, as he held her to him, was for her to live, to be whole.Instinctively, in a way he did not fully understand, he let his power well upfrom a place deep inside his mind. He released himself into the torrent as itrushed onward. He let his love of her, his need of her, flood through theirconnection as he hugged her to his breast.“Come home to where you belong,” he whispered to her.He let the core of his power course through her, intending it to be like abeacon to light her way. It felt as if he were searching through the dark, usingthe light of ability from deep within to help him. Even though he couldn’tdefine the precise mechanism, he could consciously focus his purpose, his need,and what he wanted to accomplish.“Come home to me, Kahlan. I’m here.”Kahlan gasped. Even though she hung limp, he felt the intensity of the life inhis arms. She gasped again, as if she had nearly drowned and needed air.At last, she stirred in his arms, her limbs moving, groping. She opened hereyes, blinking, and looked up. Astonished, she sank back into his arms.“Richard ... I heard you. I was so alone. Dear spirits, I was so alone. I didn’tknow what to do... I heard Nicholas scream. I was lost and alone. I didn’t knowhow to get back. And then I felt you.”She embraced him tightly, as if she never wanted to let go.“You led me back through the darkness.”Richard smiled down at her. “I’m a guide, remember?”She puzzled at him. “How could you do that?” Her beautiful green eyes openedexpectantly. “Richard, your gift...”“I figured out the problem with my gift. Kaja-Rang had given me the solution.I’d had the solution long before that, but I never realized it. My gift is fine,now, and the sword’s power works again. I was being so blind that I will beashamed to tell it all to you.”Richard’s breath caught, and he coughed, then, unable to hold it back anylonger. Nor could he hold back grimacing at the pain.Kahlan gripped his arms. “The antidote—what happened to the antidote! I sent itback with Owen. Didn’t you get it?”Richard shook his head as he coughed again, the pain feeling as though it rippedhim deep inside. He finally regained his breath. “Well, now, that is a problem.It wasn’t the antidote. It was just water with a bit of cinnamon in it.”Kahlan’s face went ashen. “But...” She looked over at Nicholas’s body, at hishead lying upended at the end of a bloody trail across the floor.“Richard, if Nicholas is dead, how are we going to get the antidote?”“There isn’t any antidote. Nicholas wanted me dead. He would have destroyed theantidote long ago. He gave you a fake to be able to capture you.”Her face had gone from joy to horror.“But, without the antidote...”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 64There’s no time to worry about the poison just now,” Richard told her as hehelped her to her feet.No time? She watched his step falter as he made his way across the room. Hegroped for the window ledge.At the small window opening in the outer wall of the fortification he signaledwith the high, clear whistle of the common wood pewee—the whistle Cara thoughtwas that of the mythical short-tailed pine hawk.“I used a ladder pole,” he explained. “Cara is on her way.”Kahlan tried to make her way over to him, but her body felt alarminglyunfamiliar to her. She staggered a couple of steps, her legs moving woodenly.She had the urge to get down on her hands and feet to walk. She felt like astranger inside her own skin. It seemed foreign to have to breathe on her own,to have to look through her own eyes, to have to listen through her own ears. Itwas a strange, haunting sensation to feel her clothes against her skin.Richard held out his hand to help steady her. Kahlan thought that as wobbly asshe was, she might still be more steady on her feet than Richard.“We’re going to have to fight our way out,” he said, “but we’ll have some help.I’ll get you the first sword I can.”Richard blew out the flame of the single candle before a tin reflector on asmall shelf.“Richard, I’m not yet used to being ... back inside myself. I don’t think I’mready to go out there. I can hardly walk.”“We don’t have a lot of choice. We have to get out. Learn as you go. I’ll helpyou.”“You can hardly walk yourself.”Cara, at the top of a pole ladder Richard had cut, leaned forward and wriggledin through the small window.Halfway in, Cara gaped in delighted wonder. “Mother Confessor—Lord Rahl did it.”“You don’t need to sound so surprised,” Richard griped as he helped theMord-Sith the rest of the way in.Cara only briefly took note of the dead man sprawled across the floor beforeKahlan threw her arms around the woman.“You can’t imagine how glad I am to see you,” Cara said.“Well, you can’t imagine how glad I am to see you through my own eyes.”“If only the trade you made had worked,” Cara added in a whisper.“We’ll find another way,” Kahlan assured her.Richard slowly drew the door open a crack and peeked out. He shut the door andturned back.“It’s clear. Doors to the left and around the balcony are the rooms with thewomen in them. Stairs to the right are the closest that lead down. Some of therooms at the bottom are for officers; others are barracks for soldiers.”Cara nodded. “I’m ready.”Kahlan looked from one to the other. “Ready for what?”Richard took her by the elbow. “I need you to help me see.”“Help you see? Is it progressing that fast?”“Just listen. We’re going to move along the balcony to the left and open thedoors. Do your best to keep the women calm. We’re going to break them out ofhere.”Kahlan was a bit confused by everything—it was completely different from theplans she had been hearing along with Nicholas. She knew she would just have tofollow Richard and Cara’s lead.Outside, on the simple wooden balcony, there were no lamps or torches. The moonwas down behind the black sprawl of the mountains. Kahlan’s sight when Nicholashad controlled her had been like looking through a greasy pane of wavy glass.The sparkling vault of stars overhead had never looked so beautiful. In thatstarlight, Kahlan could see simple buildings lined up around the outer wall ofthe fortification.Richard and Cara moved along the balcony, opening doors. At each one, Caraquickly ducked inside. Some of the women came out in their nightshirts; someKahlan could hear inside rushing to get dressed. In some of the rooms, babiescried.While Cara was in one of the rooms, Richard opened another door. He leaned closeto Kahlan and whispered, “Go in and tell the women inside that we’ve come tohelp them escape. Tell them that their men have come to get them out. But theymust be as quiet as possible, or we’ll be caught.”Kahlan rushed in, as best she could on unsteady legs, and woke the young womanin the bed to the right. She sat up, terrified, but silent. Kahlan reachedaround and shook the woman in the other bed.“We’ve come to help you escape. You mustn’t make any noise. Your men are goingto help. You have a chance to be free.”“Free?” the first woman asked.“Yes. It’s up to you, but I strongly advise you to take the chance, and tohurry.”The women flew out of their beds and grabbed for clothes.Richard, Kahlan, and Cara moved farther down the balcony, asking the women whohad already come out to help rouse the others. In a matter of a few minutes,hundreds of women were huddled together out on the balcony. There was no problemkeeping them quiet; they were all too familiar with the consequences of causingtrouble. They didn’t want to do anything to get themselves caught trying toescape. Before long, they had made it all the way around the fortificationbalcony.Many of the women had very young babies—ones too young to be taken away. Thebabies were mostly sound asleep in their mothers’ arms, but some of them startedto cry. The mothers desperately tried to rock and cuddle them into silence.Kahlan hoped that it was a common enough sound that it wouldn’t draw theattention of the soldiers.“Wait here,” Richard whispered to Kahlan. “Keep everyone up here until we getthe gate open.”With Cara right behind him, Richard slipped carefully down the steps and startedacross the open yard. When one of the babies suddenly began bawling, soldierscame out of a building to see what was going on. They spotted Richard andKahlan. The soldiers yelled, sounding an alarm.Kahlan heard the distinctive ring of steel as Richard drew his sword. Men rushedout of some of the doors, heading Richard and Cara off. Being used to dealingwith these people, the men rushing toward Richard apparently weren’t greatlyconcerned about violence. They were wrong, and fell as soon as they got closeenough for Richard to strike. Some Richard took down as he ran; others Caracaught as they tried to come in from the side.The screams of some of the men as they fell woke the whole encampment. Menrushed out of barracks below, pulling on their trousers and shirts, draggingweapon belts behind.In the faint starlight, Kahlan spotted Richard by the dropgate. He took a mightyswing. Sparks showered across the wall as the sword shattered one of the heavychains holding up the gate. Richard ran to the other side, to cut the otherchain. Two men caught up to him there. In one fluid movement, Richard cut themboth down.As Cara dropped other men who were rushing in at Richard, he swung the swordagain. White-hot fragments of steel filled the air along with the ringing soundof metal shattering. The gate groaned and slowly started to fall outward.Richard heaved his weight against it and it picked up speed. With a resoundingcrash, it came down, raising clouds of dust.A great cry rose up as men outside, wielding swords, axes, and battle maces,charged in across the broken bridge and into the fortification. The soldiersrushed to meet the invasion and there was a great clash of weapons and men.Kahlan saw, then, that soldiers were racing up the stairway on the opposite sideof the balcony.“Come on!” Kahlan yelled to the women. “We have to get out now!”Holding the rail to keep her balance, Kahlan raced down the steps, all the womenpouring down behind her, a number carrying screaming babies. Richard ran to meether at the bottom. He tossed her a short sword with a leather-wound grip. Kahlancaught it by the handle just in time to turn and slash a soldier running up frombeneath the balcony.Owen made his way through the fighting and over to the women. “Come on!” hecalled to them. “Get to the gate! Run!”The women, galvanized by his command, started running across the compound. Asthey reached the fighting, some of the women, instead of running out the gate,took the opportunity to leap on the backs of soldiers fighting Owen and his men.The women bit the men on the backs, beat at their heads, tore at their eyes. Thesoldiers were not restrained in dealing with the women, and several werebrutally killed. It didn’t stop others from joining the fight.If they would only run for the gate, they could escape, but instead, they wereattacking the soldiers with their bare hands. They had been held in bondage tothese men for a very long time. Kahlan could only imagine what they had gonethrough and couldn’t say she blamed them. She was still having difficultymoving, making her body do what she wanted it to do, or she would have joinedthem.Kahlan turned at a sound only to see a man charging in at her. She recognizedhis flattened nose. Najari—Nicholas’s right-hand man. He was one of the men whohad carried her to the fortification. He wore a wicked grin as he came for her.She could have used her power on him, but she feared to trust it right then. Sheinstead brought the short sword out from behind her back and slammed it throughNajari’s gut. He stood stiffly right in front of her, his eyes wide. She couldsmell the stink of his breath. Kahlan wrenched the handle of the sword to theside. Mouth opened wide, he panted, fearing to draw a deep breath, fearing tomove and cause any more damage. Kahlan gritted her teeth and swept the sword’shandle around in an arc, ripping his insides apart.She stared into his startled eyes as he slid off her sword. He grunted in painas he dropped to his knees, holding his wound together as best he could. Henever got what Kahlan knew he intended, what Nicholas had promised him. He fellforward onto his face, spilling his insides across the ground at her feet.Kahlan turned to the attack. Richard was engaged in slashing his way through mentrying to surround him as he fought to keep the gate clear. Others, Richard’smen, came at the enemy from behind, cutting into them the way Richard had taughtthem.Kahlan saw Owen not far away. He was standing in the open, among the fallen andthe fighting, staring across the raging battle to a man just outside one of thedoors under the balcony.The man had a thick black beard, a shaved head, and a ring through one ear andone nostril. His arms were as big as tree limbs. His shoulders were twice aswide as Owen’s.“Luchan.” Owen said to himself.Owen started across the open area of the fortification, past men engaged inpitched battle, past those crying out and those falling to blades, past swordsand axes sweeping through the air, as if he didn’t even see them. His eyes werelocked on the man watching him come.The face of a young woman appeared in the dark doorway behind Luchan He turnedand growled at her to go back inside, that he was going to take care of thelittle man from her village.When Luchan turned back around, Owen was standing before him.Luchan laughed and put his fists on his hips. “Why don’t you scurry back intoyour hole?”Owen said nothing, gave no warning, made no demands. He simply lit into Luchanwith a vengeance —just as Richard had counseled him to do —slamming a knife intothe big man’s chest over and over before Luchan had a chance to react. He hadunderestimated Owen. It had cost him his life.The woman rushed out of the doorway and came to a halt over the body of herformer master. She stared down at him, at his one arm splayed out to the side,at the other lying across his bloody chest, at the unseeing eyes. She looked upat Owen.Kahlan assumed that this was Marilee, and feared that she was going to rejectOwen for harming another, that she would castigate him for what be had done.Instead, she rushed to Owen and threw her arms around him.The woman went to her knees beside the body and took the bloody knife fromOwen’s hand. She turned to the fallen Luchan and stabbed him half a dozen timeswith such force that it drove the knife in up to the hilt with every thrust.Watching her tearful fury, Kahlan didn’t have to wonder how she had been treatedby the man.Her anger spent, she stood again and tearfully hugged Owen.Kahlan needed to get to Richard. She was relieved that her ability to move asshe intended was returning. She started making her way around the edge of thebattle, staying close to the walls, past men who saw her and thought she wouldbe an easy mark. They didn’t know that from a young age she had been taught touse a sword by her father, King Wyborn, and that Richard had later honed herskill to deadly proficiency, teaching her how to use her lighter weight to giveher lethal speed. It was the last mistake the men made.Off across the open area, a mob of soldiers, now fully awake and fully preparedto engage in battle, swarmed out of the barracks. They all charged for Richard.Kahlan knew right away that there were too many. Richard’s men couldn’t stop theflood of soldiers as they streamed across the encampment. All of them crashed intoward Richard.Kahlan heard a deafening crack like lightning as the walls of the fortificationlit with a flash. She had to turn away and shield her eyes. Night turned to day,and at the same time, a darkness darker than any night was loosed.A blazing white-hot bolt of Additive Magic twisted and coiled around and througha crackling black void of Subtractive Magic, creating a violent rope of twinlightning joined to a terrible purpose.It seemed as if the noonday sun crashed down among them. The air itself wasdrawn into the fierce heat and light. Try as she might, Kahlan couldn’t draw abreath against the force of it.Richard’s fury gathered it all into a single point. In an explosive instant, thethunderous ignition of light unleashed a devastating blast of staggeringdestruction radiating outward across the entire encampment, annihilating theImperial Order soldiers.The night fell dark and silent.Men and women stood stunned among the sea of blood and viscera, gazing around atthe unrecognizable remains of the enemy soldiers.The battle was over. The people of Bandakar had carried the day. At last, thewomen fell to wailing and crying, ecstatic to be free. They knew many of the menwho had come to free them, and clung to them in gratitude, overwhelmed with joyto be reunited. They hugged friends, relatives, and strangers alike. The men,too, wept with relief and happiness.Kahlan rushed through the maze of rejoicing people crowded into the open area ofthe fortification. Men cheered her, thrilled that she, too, had been liberated.Many of the men wanted to talk to her, but she kept running to get to Richard.He stood to the side, leaning against the wall, Cara helping to hold him up. Hestill gripped his blood-slicked sword in his fist, the blade’s tip resting onthe ground.Owen, too, made his way over to Richard.“Mother Confessor! I’m so relieved and thankful to have you back!” He lookedover at a smiling Richard. “Lord Rahl, I would like you to meet Marilee.”This woman, who only a short time ago had savagely stabbed the corpse of hercaptor now seemed too shy to speak. She dipped her head in greeting.Richard straightened and smiled that smile Kahlan so loved to see, a smilefilled with the sheer pleasure of life. “I’m very happy to meet you, Marilee.Owen has told us all about you, and about how much you mean to him. Through allthat happened, you were always first in his mind and heart. His love for youmoved him to act to change his entire empire for the better.”She seemed to be overwhelmed by it all, and by his words.“Lord Rahl came to us and did something more important than saving us all,” Owentold Marilee. “Lord Rahl gave me the courage to come and fight for you, to fightto save you—for all of us to fight for our own lives and the lives of those welove.”Beaming, Marilee leaned in and kissed Richard on the cheek. “Thank you, LordRahl. I never knew my Owen could do such things.”“Believe me,” Cara said, “we had our doubts about him, too.” She clapped Owen onthe back of the shoulder. “But he did well.”“I, too, have come to understand the value of what he has done,” Marilee said toRichard, “of the things you seem to have taught our people.”Richard smiled at the two of them, but then he could no longer hold back thecoughing that so hurt him. The mood of joyous liberation suddenly changed.People rushed in around them, helping to hold him up. Kahlan saw blood runningdown his chin.“Richard,” she cried. “No...”They eased him to the ground. He clutched at Kahlan’s sleeve, wanting to haveher close. Kahlan saw tears running down Cara’s cheek.It seemed that he had spent all the strength he had left. He was slipping intothe fatal grasp of the poison, and there was nothing they could do for him.“Owen,” Richard said, panting to catch his breath when the spell of coughingstopped. “How far to your town?” His voice was getting hoarse.“Not far—only hours, if we hurry.”“The man who made the poison and the antidote ... he lived there?”“Yes. His place is still there.”“Take me there.”Owen looked puzzled, but he nodded eagerly. “Of course.”“Hurry,” Richard added, trying to get up. He couldn’t.Tom appeared in the crowd. Jennsen was there, too.“Get some poles!” Tom commanded. “And some canvas, or blankets. We’ll make alitter. Four men at a time can carry him. We can run and get him there quickly.”Men rushed to the buildings, searching for what they would need to make alitter."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 65Kahlan hurriedly pulled the tin off the shelf and opened the lid. The tincontained a yellowish powder. It was the right color. She leaned down and showedit to Richard as he lay in the litter. He reached in and took a pinch.He smelled it. He put his tongue to it and then nodded.“Just a little,” he whispered, lifting it out to her. Kahlan held out her palmwhile he dribbled some of the crushed powder in her hand. He threw the rest onthe floor, too weak to bother returning it to the tin. Kahlan added the smallportion on her palm to one of the pots of boiling water.Cloth bags of herbs steeped in other pots of hot water. Alkaloids from driedmushrooms were soaking in oil. Richard had other people grating stalks ofplants.“Lobelia,” Richard said. His eyes were closed.Owen bent down. “Lobelia?”Richard nodded. “It will be a dried herb.”Owen turned to the shelves and started looking. There were hundreds of littlesquare cubbyholes in the wall of the place where the man who had made Richard’spoison, and the antidote, used to work. It was a small, simple, single-roombuilding with little light. It was not nearly as well equipped as the herbalistplaces Kahlan had seen before, but the man had an extensive collection ofthings. More than that, he had once made the antidote, presumably from what wasthere.“Here!” Owen said, holding a bag down for Richard to see. “It says lobelia onthe tag.”“Grind a little pile half the size of your thumbnail, sift out the fibers anddiscard them, then add what’s left to the bowl with the darker oil.”Richard knew about herbs, but he didn’t know anywhere near enough about herbs toconcoct the cure for the poison he had been given.His gift seemed to be guiding him.Richard was in a near trance, or nearly unconscious; Kahlan wasn’t exactly surewhich. He was having difficulty breathing. She didn’t know what else to do tohelp him. If they didn’t do something, he was going to die, and soon. As long ashe lay quietly on the litter he was resting more comfortably, but that was notgoing to make him recover.It had been a short run to Witherton, but it had taken too long as far as Kahlanwas concerned.“Yarrow,” Richard said.Kahlan leaned down. “What preparation?”“Oil,” Richard said.Kahlan fumbled through the shelves of small bottles. She found one labeledYARROW OIL. She squatted down and held it before Richard.“How much?”She lifted one of his hands and put the bottle in it, closing his fingers aroundit so he could tell its size. “How much?”“Is it full?”Kahlan hurriedly wiggled out the whittled wooden stopper. “Yes.”“Half,” Richard said. “In with any of the other oils.”“I found the feverfew,” Jennsen said as she hopped down from the stool.“Make a tincture,” Richard told her.Kahlan replaced the stopper in the bottle and squatted down beside Richard.“What next?”“Make an infusion of mullein.”“Mullein, mullein,” Kahlan mumbled as she turned to the task.As Richard gave them instructions, half a dozen people worked at boiling,blending, crushing, grating, filtering, and steeping. They added some of thepreparations together as they were completed, and kept others separate as theyworked on them. As they worked, the number of various tasks were combined andreduced at specified points.Richard gestured for Owen. Owen brushed his hands clean on his trouser legs ashe bent down to await instruction.“Cold,” Richard said, his eyes closed. “We need something cold. We need a way tocool it.”Owen thought a moment. “There’s a stream not far.”Richard pointed to various stations where people labored. “Pour those bowls ofpreparations and powders into the boiling water in the kettle, there. Then takeit to the stream. Hold the kettle down in the water to cool it.” Richard held upa finger in caution. “Don’t put it in too deep and let the water from the streamrun in over the top, or it will be ruined.”Owen shook his head. “I won’t.”He stood impatiently as Kahlan poured the contents of shallow bowls into theboiling pot of water. She didn’t know if any of this made sense, but she knewthat Richard had the gift, and he certainly had figured out and eliminated theproblem he had been having with it. If his gift could guide him in making theantidote, it might save his life.Kahlan didn’t know anything else that would.She handed the kettle to Owen. He ran out the door to put it in the stream tocool it. Cara followed him out to make sure that nothing happened to what mightbe the only thing that could save Richard’s life.Jennsen sat on the floor on the other side of him, holding his hand. With theback of her wrist, Kahlan pushed her hair off her face. She sat beside Richardand took his free hand to wait for Owen and Cara to return.Betty stood in the doorway, her ears pricked forward, her tail intermittentlygoing into a hopeful blur of wagging whenever Jennsen or Kahlan looked her way.It seemed like hours until Owen came running back with the kettle, althoughKahlan knew it really hadn’t been all that long.“Filter it through a cloth,” Richard said, “but don’t squeeze the cloth at theend; just let the liquid run through until you have half a cup of it. Onceyou’ve done that, then add the oils to the liquid you collected in the cup.”Everyone stood watching Kahlan work, snatching up what she needed, tossing itaway when she was finished with it. When she had enough liquid from the kettlecollected in the cup, she poured in the oils.“Stir it with a stick of cinnamon,” Richard said.Owen climbed up on the stool. “I remember seeing cinnamon.”He handed a stick down to Kahlan. She stirred the golden liquid, but it didn’tseem to be working.“The oil and water don’t want to mix,” she told Richard.His head was rolled to the side away from her. “Keep mixing. A moment will comewhen they suddenly come together.”Dubious, Kahlan kept stirring. She could see that the oils were stickingtogether in globs and not mixing with the water she had filtered through thecloth. The more it cooled, the less and less it looked like it was going towork.Kahlan felt a tear of desperation run down her cheek and drip off her jaw.The contents of the cup stiffened. She kept stirring, not wanting to tellRichard that it wasn’t working. She swallowed past the growing lump in herthroat.The contents in the cup began to melt. Kahlan gasped. She blinked. Everything inthe cup suddenly went together into a smooth, syrupy liquid.“Richard!” She wiped the tear from her cheek. “It worked. It mixed together. Nowwhat?”He held his hand out. “It’s ready. Give it to me.”Jennsen and Cara helped him to sit up. Kahlan held the precious cup in bothhands and carefully put it to his mouth. She tipped it up to help him drink. Ittook a while to get it down. He had to stop from time to time as he sipped,trying not to cough.It was a lot more than had been in any of the little square-sided bottles, butKahlan figured that maybe he needed more, since he was so late to be taking it.When he was finished, she reached up and set the cup on the counter. She lickeda drop of the liquid off her finger. The antidote had the slight aroma ofcinnamon and a sweet, spicy taste. She hoped that was right.Richard worked at recovering his breath after the effort of drinking. Theygently laid him back down. His hands were trembling. He looked miserable.“Just let me rest, now,” he murmured.Betty, still standing in the doorway, watching intently, bleated her wish tocome in.“He will be all right,” Jennsen said to her friend. “You just stay out there andlet him rest.”Betty puled softly and then lay down in the doorway to wait along with the restof them. It was going to be a long night. Kahlan didn’t think she was going tobe able to sleep until she knew if Richard would be all right.Zedd pointed. “There’s another one, there, that needs to be cleaned up,” he saidto Chase.Chase wore a chain-mail shirt over a tan leather tunic. His heavy black trousersheld a black belt set with a large silver buckle emblazoned with the emblem ofthe boundary wardens. Beneath his black cloak, strapped everywhere—legs, waist,upper arms, over the backs of his shoulders—was a small arsenal of weapons,everything from small thin spikes held in the fist and used to puncture theskull to a crescent-shaped battle-axe used to divide a skull cleanly with oneblow. Chase was deadly with any of them.It had been a while now since they needed the skills of a boundary warden. Chaseseemed to be a man without a mission.The big man walked across the rampart and bent to pull a knife from beneath thebody.He grunted in recognition. “There it is.” He held the walnut-handled knife up tothe light as he inspected it. “I was worried I’d lost it.”He slipped the knife into an empty sheath without having to look. With one hand,he grabbed the waistband of the trousers and picked up the stiff body. Hestepped into an opening in the crenellated wall and heaved the body out into theair.Zedd looked over the edge. It was a drop of several thousand feet before therock of the mountain flared enough for anything falling to make contact. It wasseveral thousand more feet down a granite cliff before the forest began.The golden sun was getting low in the mountains. The clouds had taken onstreaks, of gold and orange. From this distance, the city below was as beautifulas ever, except Zedd knew that it was an empty place without the people to bringit life.“Chase, Zedd,” Rachel called from the doorway, “the stew is ready.”Zedd threw his skinny arms into the air. “Bags! It’s about time! A man couldstarve waiting for stew to cook.”Rachel planted her fist with the wooden spoon on her hip and shook a finger ofher other hand at him. “If you keep saying bad words, you’ll not get anydinner.”Chase let out a sigh as he glanced over at Zedd. “And you think you havetroubles. You wouldn’t think that a girl who doesn’t come up to my belt bucklecould be such a trial.”Zedd followed Chase to the doorway through the thick stone wall. “Is she alwaysthis much trouble?”Chase mussed Rachel’s hair on the way past. “Always,” he confided.“Is the stew good?” Zedd asked. “Worth watching my language for?”“My new mother taught me how to make it,” Rachel said in a tempting singsong.“Rikka had some before she went out, and she said it was good.”Zedd smoothed back his unruly white hair. “Well, Emma can cook better than anywoman I ever met.”“Then be good,” Rachel said, “and I’ll give you biscuits to go with the stew.”“Biscuits!”“Sure. Stew wouldn’t be stew without biscuits.”Zedd blinked at the child. “Why, that’s what I always thought, too.”“You’d better let me see if she made it right, first,” Chase said as they passedthrough the tapestry lined halls of the Keep. “I’d hate you to go making anyfirm commitments before we even know if the stew is edible.”“Friedrich helped me with the heavy parts,” Rachel said. “He says it’s good.”“We’ll see,” Chase said.Rachel turned and shook her wooden spoon at him. “You have to wash your hands,first, though. I saw you throwing that dead man over the wall. You have to washyour hands before you come to the table and eat.”Chase gave Zedd a look of strained forbearance. “Somewhere, there’s a boyenjoying himself right now, probably carrying around a dead frog, oblivious tothe sorry fact that he’s someday going to be married tolittle-miss-wash-your-hands-before-you-eat.”Zedd smiled. When Chase had taken Rachel in to be his daughter, it was justabout the best thing Zedd could ever have wished for, Rachel thought so, too,and it looked like she still did. She was fiercely devoted to the man.As they sat at the table, before the cheery fire in the hearth, Zedd enjoyinghis third bowl of stew, he couldn’t recall the Keep being such a wonderfulplace. It was because there was a child, along with friends, once again in thehalls of the Keep.Friedrich, the man who had come on Richard’s orders to warn Zedd of theimpending attack on the Keep, had realized he had not been in time. The man usedhis head and had sought out Chase, the old friend he had heard Richard talkabout.While Chase had gone to rescue Zedd and Adie, Friedrich had returned to the Keepto spy on the people who had taken it. By watching carefully and staying out ofsight of a Sister, Friedrich had been able to provide Chase and Zedd invaluableinformation about the number of people occupying the Keep, and their routines.He then helped take the place back.Zedd liked the man. He was not only frightfully handy with a knife, butentertaining at conversation. Friedrich, since he had been married to asorceress, was able to converse with Zedd without being intimidated as some wereof wizards. Having lived in D’Hara all his life, Friedrich was also able to fillin pieces of information.Rachel held up a carving of a hawk. “Look what Friedrich made for me, Zedd.Isn’t it the most beautiful thing you ever did see?”Zedd smiled. “It certainly is.”“It’s nothing,” Friedrich scoffed. “If I had some gold leaf, then I could gildit for you. That used to be what I did for a living.” He leaned back and smiledto himself. “Until Lord Rahl made me a boundary warden.”“You know,” Zedd drawled offhandedly to both men, “the Keep is even morevulnerable, now, to those who might come and don’t have magic than to those whodo. I’m just fine protecting against those who are affected by magic, but notthe other kind.”Chase nodded. “Seems so.”“Well, the thing is,” he went on, “I was thinking that since there’s no boundaryany longer, and what with all the trouble about, perhaps you two would like totake on the responsibility of helping to protect the Wizard’s Keep. I’m notnearly so fit for the task as would be someone trained in such things.” Zeddleaned in, his brow lowering. “It’s vitally important.”Elbows on the table, Chase chewed a bite of biscuit as he watched Zedd. Finally,he stirred his spoon around in his bowl.“Well, it could be a disaster if Jagang were to use those ungifted men to gethis hands on the place again.” He thought about it. “Emma will understand.”Zedd shrugged. “Bring her here.”Chase frowned. “Bring her here?”Zedd gestured around. “The Keep is certainly big enough.”“But what would we do with our children?” Chase leaned back. “You don’t want allmy children here in the Keep, Zedd—they’d be running up and down, playing in thehalls. It would drive you batty. Besides,” Chase added, peering with onescowling eye at Rachel, “each one’s uglier than the next.”Rachel hid her giggle behind a biscuit.Zedd remembered the sounds of children’s laughter in the Keep, the sounds of joyand love.“Well, it would be a burden,” he agreed, “but this is, after all, about theprotection of the Keep. What sacrifice wouldn’t it be worth making to protectthe Keep?”Rachel looked from Chase to Zedd. “My new sister, Lee, could bring Cat back toyou, Zedd.”“That’s right!” Zedd said, throwing his hands up. “I haven’t seen Cat for ages!Is Lee treating Cat well?”Rachel nodded earnestly. “Oh, yes. We all take good care of Cat.”“What do you think, Rachel?” Chase finally asked. “Would you want to live herein this dusty old place with Zedd?”Rachel ran over and hugged Chase’s leg. “Oh, yes, can we, please? It would beever so grand.”Chase sighed. “Then I guess it’s settled. But you’ll have to behave and notbother Zedd by being too loud.”“I promise,” Rachel said. She frowned up at Zedd. “Will Mother have to crawlinto the Keep through that little tunnel, like we did?”Zedd chuckled. “No, no, we’ll let her come in the proper way, like the lady sheis.” He turned to Friedrich. “How about it, boundary warden? Would you bewilling to continue doing Lord Rahl’s bidding and stay to help guard the Keep?”Friedrich slowly spun the bird carving by the tip of one wing, thinking.“You know,” Zedd added, “while you’re waiting for some fearsome attack, thereare any number of old gilded things here at the Keep that are in terrible needof repair. Perhaps you would consider taking on the job of being the Keep’sofficial gilder? We have plenty of gold leaf. And, someday, when the peoplereturn to Aydindril, you would have a steady supply of customers.”Friedrich stared down at the table. “I don’t know. This one adventure was allwell and good, but since my wife, Althea, died, I don’t seem to be interested inmuch.”Zedd nodded. “I know how it is. I used to have a wife. I think it would do yougood to get paid to do something needed.”Friedrich smiled. “All right, then. I will take your job, wizard.”“Good,” Chase said. “I’ll have someone to help me when I need to locktroublesome children in the dungeon.”Rachel giggled as he set her on the ground.Chase pushed his chair back and stood. “Well, Friedrich, if we’re going to beKeep wardens, then I think we ought to make some rounds and satisfy ourselvesabout the security of a few things. As big as this place is, Rikka could use thehelp.”“Just mind the shields,” Zedd reminded them as they headed for the door.After the two men had gone off, Rachel got Zedd another biscuit to go with therest of his stew. Her little brow bunched together earnestly.“When we live here, we’ll try to be real quiet for you, Zedd.”“Well, you know, Rachel, the Keep is a big place. I doubt you would bother memuch if you and your brothers and sisters wanted to play a little bit.”“Really?”Zedd pulled the leather-covered ball painted with faded blue and pink zigzaggedlines all around it out of his pocket and set it on the table.Rachel’s eyes lit up in astonishment.“I found this old ball,” he said, gesturing with his biscuit. “I think a ballhas a much better time if it has someone to play with it. Do you think you andyour brothers and sisters might like to play with this when you live here? Youcan bounce it down the halls to your heart’s content.”Her mouth fell open. “Really, Zedd?”Zedd grinned at the look on her face. “Really.”“Maybe I can bounce it in the dark hall that makes the funny noises. Then itwouldn’t bother you any more than now.”“This old place is full of funny noises—and a bouncing ball isn’t liable tocause too much trouble.”She climbed up in his lap and put her little arms around his neck, hugging himtightly.“It’s a lot better hugging you now that you found those things to get that awfulcollar off your neck.”Zedd rubbed her back as she hugged him. “Yes, it is, little one; yes, it is.”She leaned back and looked at him. “I wish Richard and Kahlan could be here toplay with the ball, too. I miss them something fierce.”Zedd smiled. “Me, too, little one. Me, too.”She frowned at him. “Don’t get tears, Zedd. I won’t make a lot of noise tobother you.”Zedd shook a bony finger at her. “I’m afraid you have a lot to learn aboutplaying with a ball.”“I do?”“Of course. Laughing goes with playing with a ball like biscuits go with stew.”She frowned at him, not sure if he was telling the truth.He set her on the floor. “Tell you what. Why don’t you come with me and I’llshow you.”“Really, Zedd?”Zedd stood up and mussed her hair. “Really.”He scooped the ball off the table. “Let’s see if you can show this ball how tohave a good time.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 66Richard rested his back against a rock in the shade of a stand of white oaks ashe gazed off at the line of silver maples shimmering in the breeze. The airsmelled fresh after the rain of the day before. The clouds had moved on and lefta clear, bright blue sky behind. His head finally felt clear, as well.It had taken three days, but he was finally recovered from the effects of thepoison. His gift had not only helped bring Kahlan back from the brink, buthimself as well.The people of the town of Witherton were just beginning to try to put theirlives back together. With all the people they’d lost, it was going to bedifficult for them. There were gaping holes where there used to be friends ormembers of families. Still, now that they were free there was the beginning of avibrant sense of their future being better.But just because they were free, that did not mean they would stay that way.Richard gazed up the broad valley beyond the town. People were out working withtheir crops and tending to the animals. They were going back to their lives. Hewas impatient to be on his way, and back to his own life. This place had keptthem from important business, from people who had been waiting for them.He guessed that this place had been important business as well. It was hardtelling what this all had begun, or what the future would hold.For sure, the world would never be the same.Richard saw Kahlan coming out through the gate, Cara beside her. Betty frolickedalong at their side, eager to see where they were going. Jennsen must have letthe goat go for a romp. Betty had grown up and spent her entire life on themove. She’d never stayed in one place for long. Maybe that was why she alwayswanted to follow Richard and Kahlan. She recognized family and wanted to be withthem.“So, what’s she going to do?” Richard asked Kahlan as she came close and set herpack down beside Richard’s.“I don’t know.” With the flat of her hand to her brow, Kahlan shielded her eyesfrom the sunlight. “I think she wants to tell you first.”Cara set her pack beside Kahlan’s. “I think she’s torn and doesn’t know what todo.”“How do you feel?” Kahlan asked as she reached down and with her fingertipsrubbed the back of his shoulder. Her gentle touch was a calming connection.Richard smiled up at her. “I keep telling you, I’m fine.”He tore off a strip of dried venison and chewed as he watched Jennsen, Tom,Owen, Marilee, Anson, and a small group of the men finally emerge through thegates and make their way across the waving field of waist-high green grass.“I’m hungry,” Kahlan said. “Can I have some?”“Sure.” Richard pulled strips of the meat from his pack, stood, and handed apiece to both Kahlan and Cara.“Lord Rahl,” Anson said, waving, as the group joined Richard, Kahlan, and Carain the shade of the oaks, “we wanted to come out to say good-bye and see youoff. Maybe we will walk with you toward the pass?”Richard swallowed. “We’d like that.”Owen frowned. “Lord Rahl, why are you eating meat? You just healed your gift.Won’t you harm your balance?”Richard smiled. “No. You see, incorrectly trying to apply a false notion ofbalance was what caused the problem I was having with my gift.”Owen looked puzzled. “What do you mean? You said that you must not eat meat asthe balance to the killing you sometimes must do. After the battle at thefortification, don’t you need to balance your gift all the more?”Richard took a deep breath and let it out slowly as he gazed out over themountains.“You see, the thing is,” Richard said, “I owe you all an apology. You alllistened to me, but I didn’t listen to myself.“Kaja-Rang tried to help me with the words revealed on the statue, the words Itold you—Deserve Victory. They were, first of all, meant for me.”“I don’t understand,” Anson said.“I told you that your life is your own to live and that you have every right todefend it.“Yet, I was telling myself that I had to balance the killing I did to defend mylife and the lives of my loved ones by not eating meat—in essence, saying myself-defense, my killing of those who attack me and other innocent people, wasmorally wrong, and so for the killing I’d done I needed to make amends to themagic that helped me by offering it the appeasement of balance.”“But your sword’s magic didn’t work, either,” Jennsen said.“No, it didn’t, and that should have been the thing that made me realize whatthe problem was, because both my gift and the sword’s magic are differententities, yet they reacted logically to the same unreasoned action on my part.The sword’s magic began to fail because I myself, by not eating meat, was sayingthat I did not completely believe that I was justified in using force to stopothers who initiate violence.“The sword’s magic functions through the belief structure of the sword’s owner;it only works against what the Seeker himself perceives as the enemy. Thesword’s magic will not work against a friend. That was the key I should haveunderstood.“When I thought that the use of the sword had to be balanced, I was, in effect,expressing a belief that my actions were in some way unjustified. Therefore,because I held that remnant of faith in a false concept that had been inculcatedin me throughout my life, just as all the people of Bandakar were taught—thatkilling was always wrong—the sword’s magic began to fail me.“The Sword of Truth’s magic, as my gift, could only again be viable when Icomprehended—completely—that the magic needs no balance for the killing I’vedone because the killing I’ve done is not only moral, but the only moral courseof action I could have taken.“By not eating meat, I was acknowledging that some part of my mind believed thesame thing that the people here in Bandakar believed when we first met Owen andhis men—that killing is always wrong.“By thinking that I must not eat meat as a balance, I was denying the moralnecessity of self-preservation, denying the essential of protecting the value oflife. The very act of seeking ‘balance’ for what I’m right in doing is aconflict which is what was causing the headaches and also caused the Sword ofTruth’s power to fail me. I was doing it to myself.”Richard had violated the Wizard’s First Rule by believing a lie—that it wasalways wrong to kill—because he feared it was true. He had also violated theSecond Rule, among others, but most grievous of all, he had violated the SixthRule. In so doing, he had ignored reason in favor of blind faith. The failure ofhis gift and the sword’s power was a direct result of not applying reasonedthought.Fortunately, with the Eighth Rule, he had come to reexamine his actions andfinally realized the flaw in his thinking. Only then was he able to correct thesituation.In the end, he had fulfilled the Eighth Rule.Richard shifted his weight to the other foot as he gazed at the faces watchinghim. “I had to come to understand that my actions are moral and need no balance,but are in themselves balanced by my reasoned actions, that killing is sometimesnot only justified, but the only right and moral thing to do.“I had to come to understand the very thing I was asking all of you tounderstand. I had to understand that I must deserve victory.”Owen looked over at those with him and then scratched his head. “Well,considering everything, I guess we can understand how you could make such amisjudgment.”Jennsen, her red hair standing out against the green of the trees and fields,squinted at him in the sunlight. “Well,” she said with a sigh, “I’m glad to bepristinely ungifted. Being a wizard sounds awfully hard.”The men all nodded while voicing their agreement.Richard smiled at Jennsen. “A lot of things in life are hard to figure out. Likewhat you’ve been considering. What have you decided?”Jennsen clasped her hands and glanced over at Owen, Anson, and all the rest ofthe people with them.“Well, this is no longer a banished empire. It’s no longer an empire naked tothe aggression of tyrants. It’s part of the D’Haran Empire, now. These peoplewant the same as us.“I think I’d like to stay with them for a while and help them come to be part ofthe wider world, just as I’ve been starting to do. It’s kind of exciting. I’dlike to take your suggestion, Richard, and help them in that.”Richard smiled at his sister. He ran his hand down her beautiful red hair.“On a condition,” she added.Richard let his hand drop back. “Condition?”“Sure. I’m a Rahl, so ... I was kind of thinking that I ought to have someproper protection. I could be a target, you know. People want to kill me. Jagangwould love to—”Richard laughed as he drew her into a hug with one arm to silence her.“Tom, being as you are a protector to the House of Rahl, I’m assigning you toprotect my sister, Jennsen Rahl. It’s an important job and it means a great dealto me.”Tom lifted an eyebrow. “Are you sure, Lord Rahl?”Jennsen swatted him with the back of her hand. “Of course he’s sure. He wouldn’tsay it unless he was sure.”“You heard the lady,” Richard said. “I’m sure.”The big blond D’Haran smiled with a boyish grin. “All right, then. I swear Iwill protect her, Lord Rahl.”Jennsen gestured vaguely back at the men and the town behind her.“Since I’ve been with them, they have come to see that I’m not a witch, andBetty is not a spirit guide—although for a time there I was afraid they might beright about Betty.”Richard peered down at the goat. Betty cocked her head. “I guess none of us butBetty knew the truth of what Nicholas was up to.” At the sound of her name,Betty’s ears pricked forward and her tail went into a fit of expectant wagging.Jennsen patted Betty’s round middle. “Now that these people understand that I’mnot a witch, but I do share some of their traits, I suggested I might play animportant role.” She drew the knife at her belt and held it up, showing Richardthe ornate letter “R” engraved on the silver handle. “I suggested that I be theofficial representative of the House of Rahl—if you approve.”Richard grinned. “I think that’s an excellent idea.”“I think that would be wonderful, Jennsen.” Kahlan pointed to the east with herchin. “But don’t wait too long before you get back to Hawton to see Ann andNathan. They will be a valuable help in insuring that the people here are nolonger the prey of the Imperial Order. They will help you.”Jennsen twisted her fingers together. “But aren’t they going to want to be goingwith the both of you? Helping you?”“Ann thinks she should direct Richard’s life,” Kahlan said. “I don’t think someof her directions have been the best thing.” She slipped her arm throughRichard’s. “He is the Lord Rahl, now. He needs to do things his way, nottheirs.”“They both feel responsible for us,” Richard explained. “Nathan Rahl is aprophet. Prophecy, because of the way it functions, actually does requirebalance. The balance to Prophecy is free will. I am the balance. I know thosetwo don’t like it, but I think I need to be free of them—for now. at least.“But there is more to it. I think it’s more important that they help the peoplehere, first. We already know the uses to which Jagang will put the pristinelyungifted. I think it’s vital that these people here, who are willing to valueand protect the freedom they’ve won, are given some guidance in how to do that.“Ann and Nathan will be able to set up defenses that will help protect thepeople here. They will also be valuable in teaching you the history that isimportant for you to know.”After Richard picked up his pack and slipped his arms through the straps, Owengripped Richard’s hand. “Thank you, Lord Rahl, for showing me that my life isworth living.”Marilee stepped forward and hugged him. “Thank you for teaching Owen to beworthy of me.”Richard laughed. Owen laughed. Cara gave Marilee an approving clap on the back.And then all the men laughed.Betty pushed in and with a flurry of tail wagging got the point across that shedidn’t want to be left out.Richard knelt down and scratched Betty’s ears. “And you, my friend, from now onI don’t want you letting any Slides using you to spy on people.”Betty pushed her head against his chest as he scratched her ears, and bleated asif to say she was sorry."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 67Alone at last beneath the vast blue sky, the soaring walls of snowcappedmountains, and in among the trees, Richard felt good about being on their way.He would miss Jennsen, but it was only for a time. It would do her good to be onher own, yet among people also discovering how to live their own lives as theylearned more about the wider world. He knew he would not trade away all he hadlearned since he’d left his sheltered life in Hartland. If not for that, hewouldn’t be with Kahlan.It felt good to walk and stretch his legs. He hitched his bow up higher on hisshoulder as they made their way through the dappled sunlight of the hushedforest floor. After being so close to death as well as to losing his ability tosee, he found everything more vibrant. The mosses looked more lush, the leavesmore shimmery, the towering pines more awe-inspiring.Kahlan’s eyes seemed more green, her hair softer, her smile warmer.As much as he at one time had hated the fact that he had been born gifted, hewas now relieved to have his gift back. It was part of him, part of who he was,part of what made him the individual he was.Kahlan had once asked him if he wished she had been born without her Confessor’spower. He had told her that he would never wish that, because he loved her forwho she was. There was no way to separate out the parts of a person. That was todeny their individuality. He was no different. His gift was part of who he was.His abilities touched everything he did.His problem with his gift was of his own making. The magic of the Sword of Truthhad helped him understand that by failing him. In so doing, it had revealed hisown failure to recognize the truth.To have it back at his hip, and to know that it was once again in harmony withhim and ready to defend him and those he loved, was a comforting feeling—notbecause he wished to fight, but because he wished to live.The day was warm and they made good time climbing the rocky trail up into thepass. By the time they reached the crown of the notch through the formidablemountains, it was colder, but without a biting wind it was not unpleasant.At the top of the pass they stopped to gaze up at the statue of Kaja-Rang,sitting where it had been for thousands of years, all alone, keeping vigil overan empire of those who once could not see evil.In some ways, the statue’s presence was a monument to failure. Where Kaja-Rangand his people had failed to get these people to see the truth, Richard hadsucceeded—but not without Kaja-Rang’s help.Richard put his hands on the cold granite, on the words—Taiga Vassternich—thathad helped save his life.“Thank you,” he whispered up at the face of the man staring off toward thePillars of Creation, where Richard had discovered his sister.Cara placed her hands over the words, and Richard was surprised to see her lookup at the statue and say, “Thank you for helping to save Lord Rahl.”After they started descending the pass, first crossing the open ledges and thenmaking it down into the dense woods, Richard heard the call of a pewee, thesignal he had taught Cara that had served them so well.“You know,” Cara said as she led them down the rocky ground beside a smallstream, “Anson knows a lot about birds.”Richard stepped carefully among the tangle of cedar roots. “Really.”“Yes. While you were recovering we spent time talking.” She put a hand againstthe fibrous bark of the reddish trunk of a cedar to keep her balance. She pulledher long blond braid forward over her shoulder as she started out again, runningher hand down the length of the braid.“He complimented me on my bird whistle,” Cara said.Richard glanced to Kahlan. She shrugged to let him know that she didn’t have anyidea what Cara was getting at.“I told you that you learned it well,” Richard said.“I told him that you taught it to me, that it was the call of the short-tailedpine hawk. Anson said that there wasn’t any such bird as a short-tailed pinehawk. He said the call I used as a signal—the call you taught me—was a commonwood pewee. Me, a Mord-Sith, using the call of a bird named a pewee. Imaginethat.”They walked in silence for a moment.“Am I in trouble?” Richard finally asked.“Oh, yes,” Cara answered.Richard couldn’t help smiling but he made sure the Mord-Sith didn’t see it, nor.did Cara see Kahlan look back over her shoulder with the special smile she gaveno other but him.Kahlan lifted an arm, pointing. “Look.”Through the gaps in the crowns of the cedars, against the bright blue sky, theysaw a black-tipped race circling high above them, riding the mountain aircurrents. The races were no longer hunting them. This one was simply looking forits dinner.“What’s that old saying?” Cara asked. “Something about a bird of prey circlingover you at the beginning of a journey being a warning sign.”“Yes, that’s right,” Richard said. “But I’m not going to let that old talebother me; we’ll let you come with us anyway.”Kahlan laughed and received a scolding scowl. Kahlan laughed all the more whenRichard started laughing, too. Cara couldn’t hold out, and as she turned back tothe trail, Richard saw the smile spread across her face."},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsChapter 1 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_002.html#filepos457]Chapter 2 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_002.html#filepos15299]Chapter 3 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_003.html#filepos30612]Chapter 4 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_004.html#filepos46677]Chapter 5 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_005.html#filepos75263]Chapter 6 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_006.html#filepos86185]Chapter 7 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_007.html#filepos116157]Chapter 8 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_008.html#filepos141916]Chapter 9 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_009.html#filepos160598]Chapter 10 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_010.html#filepos181211]Chapter 11 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_011.html#filepos198862]Chapter 12 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_012.html#filepos233991]Chapter 13 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_013.html#filepos260646]Chapter 14 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_014.html#filepos295496]Chapter 15 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_015.html#filepos315994]Chapter 16 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_016.html#filepos331470]Chapter 17 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_017.html#filepos357458]Chapter 18 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_018.html#filepos382049]Chapter 19 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_019.html#filepos396680]Chapter 20 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_020.html#filepos422895]Chapter 21 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_021.html#filepos456102]Chapter 22 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_022.html#filepos482976]Chapter 23 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_023.html#filepos505111]Chapter 24 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_024.html#filepos530604]Chapter 25 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_025.html#filepos572916]Chapter 26 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_026.html#filepos606490]Chapter 27 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_027.html#filepos620186]Chapter 28 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_028.html#filepos632953]Chapter 29 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_029.html#filepos650127]Chapter 30 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_030.html#filepos663151]Chapter 31 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_031.html#filepos689243]Chapter 32 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_032.html#filepos715640]Chapter 33 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_033.html#filepos731780]Chapter 34 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_034.html#filepos752042]Chapter 35 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_035.html#filepos777233]Chapter 36 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_036.html#filepos809180]Chapter 37 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_037.html#filepos829101]Chapter 38 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_038.html#filepos854044]Chapter 39 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_039.html#filepos869364]Chapter 40 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_040.html#filepos882277]Chapter 41 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_041.html#filepos900014]Chapter 42 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_042.html#filepos933579]Chapter 43 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_043.html#filepos963608]Chapter 44 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_044.html#filepos985695]Chapter 45 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_045.html#filepos1010974]Chapter 46 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_046.html#filepos1051473]Chapter 47 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_047.html#filepos1083225]Chapter 48 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_048.html#filepos1113171]Chapter 49 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_049.html#filepos1134872]Chapter 50 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_050.html#filepos1156959]Chapter 51 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_051.html#filepos1177430]Chapter 52 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_052.html#filepos1198128]Chapter 53 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_053.html#filepos1234863]Chapter 54 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_054.html#filepos1267825]Chapter 55 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_055.html#filepos1280998]Chapter 56 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_056.html#filepos1299807]Chapter 57 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_057.html#filepos1318938]Chapter 58 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_058.html#filepos1333506]Chapter 59 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_059.html#filepos1348409]Chapter 60 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_060.html#filepos1380523]Chapter 61 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_061.html#filepos1394061]Chapter 62 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_062.html#filepos1403667]Chapter 63 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_063.html#filepos1413090]Chapter 64 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_064.html#filepos1425208]Chapter 65 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_065.html#filepos1446182]Chapter 66 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_066.html#filepos1470831]Chapter 67 [../Text/Naked_Empire_split_067.html#filepos1485867]"}]
