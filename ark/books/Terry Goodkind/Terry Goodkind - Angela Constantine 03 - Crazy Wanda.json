Under theharsh glare of the light on the power pole at the edge of the lot, the frayedbill of the man’s leather baseball cap cast a shadow down over his gaunt face.His tattered white undershirt had tea-colored stains. The way his lips sank inaround an unfiltered cigarette betrayed the fact that he was all gums. By hisrattling cough as he had coasted to a stop, Angela was pretty sure that heeither had lung cancer or was well on his way to getting it.The old man spread his legs and planted his feet on the ground to steady thebike as he cleared phlegm from his throat. He leaned to the side to spit out abig wad. At least he spit away from her.His gaze drifted up from her knee-high boots, up her bare, long legs and cutoffshorts, finally reaching her face. He squinted his left eye against a risingcurl of smoke as he took a drag from the cigarette between his sunken lips. Theglow from that long drag momentarily lit the coarse stubble covering thecontours and folds of his leathery skin.He took the cigarette from his mouth with the first two fingers of his left handand flicked off the ash.“Well, well, well,” he drawled in a raspy voice that still possessed the hint ofa once-tough man. “Didn’t you grow up to be as pretty as an angel.”Angela was scowling. She had seen him panhandling in the parking lot before, butthis was the first time he had ever approached her.She’d parked with her front bumper almost touching the wall of the bar. He wasstraddling his bike at the end of the gap between her truck and the car in thenext spot.Without a word, she started to go past him. He put a hand out to lean againstthe side of her truck and block her path. It looked to her like the practicedreflex of a man who had used that same move to stop countless young women.“Get out of my way,” she said with menace.He gestured beseechingly with the hand holding the cigarette. “Might you give anold friend a bit of help?”“We aren’t ‘old friends,’ ” she said.She knew what “help” drunks and crackheads usually wanted. She had no intentionof giving him any of her money. She worked hard and didn’t want what she earnedgoing up in smoke.“Oh, but we are,” he said, squinting at her with the one eye without smoke init. “I’m Albert. I’m your father.”Angela was caught off guard for only an instant. She huffed a laugh. “Yeah,right. I don’t know an Albert.”“I was a friend of your mother, Sally.”“So were lots of guys.”Any one of the drunks, tweakers, or dealers who hung around their trailer couldhave been her father. It wasn’t like it would have been a rare conquest. Neitherher mother nor the degenerates she slept with gave paternity much thought.Over the years Angela saw all those men up close, many without their clothes. ToAngela it didn’t matter which one of them had fathered her. They were allpsychos. She didn’t remember Albert hanging around the trailer when she waslittle, but then, it was hard to remember all the creeps she’d seen back then.Since she had no intention of giving this man any money, talking to him would bepointless. She needed to get inside for her shift. As she went to push past him,he rolled his bicycle forward, planting the front wheel against the truck’s backfender to pen her in.“I just need some money to help me get by. Can’t you see your way to giving yourpoor old dad a twenty?”Much to his helpless annoyance, Angela grabbed the bike’s head tube, lifted thefront end, and set it aside.That was when he pulled a knife. “You look like you could easily spare a twentyfor your needy father,” he said with a cunning grin. Even though it was arelatively small knife and in poor condition, it was easily big enough to belethal. “But since you want to be such a heartless little bitch about it, I’lltake all you got.”Because she was conceived by addicts and had spent nine months developing in awomb awash with alcohol and every kind of illicit drug her mother could get herhands on, it was something of a miracle that Angela had been born at all. Whileshe might have appeared normal, she knew that she had been born broken, leftwith the quite abnormal and freaky ability to recognize killers by their eyes.She knew by this man’s eyes that he was in the declining stages of dangerous,but he wasn’t a killer.Of course, that didn’t mean, even at this late stage of his life, that hecouldn’t start a new profession. She could tell by his eyes and his hair-triggertemperament that he had been an intimidating man most people would have avoided.Now, though, he was just a shell of his former self, a lion without his teeth.“Quit stalling. Do as I say and hand over all your money. I’d hate to have tostab my own daughter.”“If you really were Sally’s friend, then you would know that neither my mothernor the degenerates she slept with had any idea who fathered me, so your claimis baseless.”“Well, I slept with her a time or two, so it could just as well be me.”He waved the knife in her direction, hoping it would urge her to hand over hermoney.“Get that knife out of my face and get out of my way or I’ll call the police andfile assault charges against you. I’d bet you have a long rap sheet andoutstanding warrants, so they would be happy to throw you in jail.”He grew the kind of calculating smile that Angela knew all too well from men whointended her harm, even if they didn’t intend murder.The once-dangerous man reemerged in his tone. “One way or another you’re goingto give me your money.”She leaned down toward him, close enough to smell his stink.“Move.”When he thrust the knife toward her she was ready. She caught his wrist andturned his frail arm out to the side, away from her. The ravages of a life ofdrugs and alcohol had left him skin and bones, hardly a worthy adversary for herstrength.Yipping in pain, and apparently still intent on stabbing her, he struggled towrestle his arm away. She held his wrist in a viselike grip as she kept his armtwisted aside. With her other hand she pried his little finger and then his ringfinger from the handle of the knife, bending both back until he twisted andhowled in pain.Once she had extinguished his aggression with a good bit of pain, she releasedhis fingers, grabbed the end of the handle, and twisted the knife out of hishand.“Give it back!” he cried, cradling his sore fingers with his other hand. “It’smine! Give it back!”He reminded her of nothing so much as a shriveled, gnomelike character whiningfor his magic knife back, as if it were the source of his strength.She pointed the tarnished blade at his face. “Get lost. If you ever threaten meagain you had better hope that the cops take you to jail to protect you fromme.”His gaze went to the large tattoo across her throat. “I see now what kind ofangel you really are.”“Then I guess you had best get on down the road.”Angela heaved the knife away. It skittered across the parking lot and came torest in weeds growing in the cracked asphalt at the edge of the road.He glanced her way briefly to see if she intended to hit him, then pedaled away,intent on retrieving his knife. The bike wobbled as he tried to control it withone hand on one handlebar and a wrist on the other.Angela felt a little bad about hurting such a frail old man, but she had a rule:Don’t be nice to people who try to kill you."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2Angela woke with a start from a dead sleep when she heard a hollow thud comefrom outside the house. She snatched her gun off the nightstand before her feethad even hit the floor. A rush of adrenaline flashed like ice through her veinsand brought her wide awake in an instant.Her heart hammered as she sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, listeningintently, trying to make sense of the sound, trying to think of what it couldbe. It had been too loud to be a pinecone hitting the ground or even the roof.Those often made a thud, but not this loud. This had been something moresubstantial—a quick crack of sound that had reverberated back from the woods.She wondered briefly if it could be dear old Dad, but the old derelict couldn’tpossibly have pedaled his pink girl’s bicycle this far out of town. He wouldhave died of exhaustion before he got very far from his haunts.Unless someone had given him a ride.Ducking low as she crossed the room, she darted a glance out the bedroom door,first to the left toward the front, and then to the right toward the back door,where she thought the sound had come from. She knew that just because the soundhad come from out back didn’t mean someone couldn’t be out front as well, oreven inside the house. Living alone and with her house being so isolated, Angelaalways worried about a home invasion.Her long drive had a stout cable across it, but that wouldn’t stop a big wirecutter. The security provided by the cable was more in the statement it made,along with a skull and crossbones sign warning against trespassing. The onlypurpose in cutting the cable, though, would be to drive up the long drive to thehouse. She hadn’t heard car tires crunching on gravel.Just to be sure, she cleared the kitchen and then the living room on the waythrough. When she was away from home she carried a Walther P22, because it waslighter and much easier to conceal, but it required exceptional accuracy. If theshot placement was on target, though, it was as deadly as any gun but withoutoverpenetration or making a huge, bloody mess. That was why it was the choice ofassassins.In her house when it was dark she would likely only be able to see a bad guy’sdark shape. For that reason, she kept a Glock 9 mm loaded with hollow-points onher nightstand. It only needed to hit center mass to stop a threat.Stepping silently across the living room in her bare feet, Angela peeked outpast the edge of the curtain to check the yard. The moonlight provided enoughlight to see that there was no car in sight, only her primer-gray pickup.After the quick appraisal out the front, gun up and at the ready, Angela hurriedto the back door between the bedroom and the kitchen. She scanned out the smallwindow in the door. The dense forest of towering pines blocked much of themoonlight, but because she’d been asleep her eyes were well adjusted to thedark.She spotted two shapes moving through those shadows. They were too low to bedeer. She thought at first that they were dogs.Then, when one of them moved into the moonlight between the shadows, she sawthat it was a dark-colored wolf. More than that, it was a wolf she recognized.It was Bardolph.Bardolph had been shot by a sheriff’s deputy the previous winter. Angela hadbeen angry that the deputy had shot the animal. She didn’t want it to suffer aslow, agonizing death, and she didn’t have the heart to kill it, so she hadtaken it to an animal emergency hospital. While it was there the staff who hadcared for it had named it Bardolph.Because the wolf was potentially quite dangerous, once it had recovered Angelareleased it quite a distance away from her house into the woods where she hadfound it. It had returned the favor by attacking a maniac who had tried to killher. She had saved its life, and it had in turn saved hers. It had seemed thatkarma was alive and well in the universe.She presumed the wolf would live in the vast preserve surrounding her home. Nowit had shown up by her house. Since wolves avoided people, she didn’t know whyit would come around.Angela opened the door to get a better look. It was a relatively warm summernight, so she stood in the doorway in only her underwear, watching. It was thenthat she spotted the second wolf. Bardolph stayed back by the trees as hewatched the second wolf investigating the backyard. It was lighter-colored and abit smaller. Angela was pretty sure it was female.“Well, my old friend,” she murmured, “it looks like you found yourself a mate.”Wanting to see, smell, and touch everything in the yard, the female rubbedagainst the picnic table, leaving her scent. Angela saw, then, that a boardshe’d left on the table had been knocked off onto a knob of rock sticking upfrom the ground. She realized that that had been the sound she had heard.The whole time the she-wolf investigated the backyard, she kept a wary eye onAngela; then she abruptly advanced toward Angela, snarling, lips curled back,showing her teeth. It was a frightening sight.Angela had her gun up and at the ready. She didn’t want to shoot the creature,but she would if she had to. She hoped simply pointing the gun at the snarlingbeast would be enough to keep it at bay.It wasn’t.The female wolf suddenly advanced aggressively toward Angela, mouth opened,teeth bared, closing the distance.Just before Angela pulled the trigger, Bardolph loped up to intercept thefemale. He growled and snapped at her. In a display of dominance, he put hisneck over hers and pushed her head down, as if to tell her to back off. Shelicked his face in submission and then they twined their necks together for amoment before bounding off into the woods.Angela stood in the doorway, gun lowered to her side, watching the dark woodswhere the pair had vanished. It had been an amazing sight. She was thrilled tohave seen him again.She hadn’t seen Bardolph for months, not since back in the dead of a bitterwinter. For the life of her, Angela couldn’t figure out why he had come aroundher place in the woods, and why he had brought his new mate.She heard the pair, then, off on Grandfather Mountain, howl at the moon.Her life in the woods, in the house her grandparents had built, was hersanctuary of solitude. It made up for the other part of her life working withher own messenger service and at Barry’s Place tending bar. Those two lives—onein the woods and one in Milford Falls—could not be more different. While theyseemed opposites, in some ways, when it came to the evil men who occasionallycrossed paths with her, those two lives were connected. Those evil men endedtheir murderous careers in Angela’s world of solitude, never to be seen again."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3As Angela set beers down in front of a boisterous group of men at a round table,one of them, Ricky Sparling, leaned back in his chair.“Where’s Wanda?”Angela put a bowl of pretzels on the table as she flipped the tray around withher other hand and tucked it under her arm. “Beats me,” she said over the loudthump of rock music. “She should have been here hours ago.”It was busy, even for a Friday night. With Wanda a no-show, Angela was being runragged trying to keep up with orders. At least the extra tips helped soothe herannoyance at Wanda for leaving her high and dry.The men were a lumber crew from one of the remaining small operations workingjust outside Milford Falls. Ricky Sparling owned the small company and it madehim a good living. They specialized in select cutting from property owners. Theyall smelled of fresh-cut pine, gasoline, and smoke from diesel equipment.Ricky had on a red plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He leaned in on hiselbows.“I’m buying this round.” He grinned at Angela as he handed her some foldedbills. “Keep the change.”The men chuckled a little when he winked at her. She didn’t respond to his wink.“When Wanda comes in I’ll let her know you were asking after her.”Angela hurried back to the bar to get the next order ready. She set the tray ona stack at the side and noticed Barry on the phone in the hall. She quicklyopened a bottle of beer for an older man sitting at the bar and scooped up themoney he laid down. She rang the beer up on the cash register and gave the manhis change.With the loud rock music that always played in the bar, Angela couldn’t hearwhat Barry was saying, although by his animated gestures she could tell he wasmiffed.When the call ended he quickly ducked into the cooler where the kegs were keptand returned with a hand truck loaded with cases of bottled beer for therefrigeration unit behind the bar.Angela gestured. “The second tap isn’t working.”Barry’s expression twisted with long-suffering displeasure as he loaded beerbottles into the cooler. “Probably that damn coupling again. I don’t think Ihave a new one. I’ll have to see if I can fix it after closing.”“Something wrong?” Angela asked.“Crazy Wanda.”“Ah,” she said with a knowing nod as she drew beers and poured shots for thenext order. “So what’s her excuse for being late?”Barry straightened and leaned closer. “She got her ass thrown in jail.”Angela rolled her eyes. “Again?”“Yeah.”“What’s she done this time?”“She says it’s all a big misunderstanding.”Angela let out a half laugh. “Isn’t it always?”“She says she wanted to get her things from her ex-boyfriend’s place, but hewouldn’t ever meet her there to let her in. So, of course, crazy Wanda broke awindow and let herself in. At least, that’s her story.”Wanda could turn the most ordinary of situations into drama. It seemed she hadnow turned a simple breakup with her most recent boyfriend into an arrest. Wandawas a walking, talking soap opera.Even though she was often late, Barry didn’t fire her, because she was good ather job—when she was there—so on balance she was good for the bar. With hernaturally friendly nature and bubbly personality, she got men to stick aroundand buy drinks they didn’t know they wanted.“Anyway,” Barry said, “she asked me to please come bail her out.”“Why you? Let her parents bail her out.”“That’s what I told her. She says they won’t answer their phone.”Angela nodded knowingly. “Caller ID.”Barry frowned up at her from putting bottles in the cooler. “What?”“They probably saw on their caller ID that it was a number from the jail andthey didn’t want to bail her out again.”Barry sighed as he went back to loading more bottles into the cooler. “Thatmakes sense.”Angela didn’t know anyone who got hauled to jail as often as Wanda did, and itwas never for anything serious. It was always some trivial issue she managed toblow up into a fracas.One time she got pulled over for running a stop sign. She argued with the copand angrily refused to sign the ticket. She became increasingly belligerentuntil she had to be restrained. She spent the night in jail until she saw thejudge in the morning. He dropped the charges in return for her paying a big finefor the ticket.As a result of missing work while sitting in jail, she got behind in her bills.Bill collectors started harassing her, which set her off in fits of anger whenshe stormed into work.“It’s your own damn fault,” Angela had told her when she was complaining aboutall her troubles.“It’s not my fault!” Wanda protested.Angela quietly reminded her that had she simply signed the ticket, she wouldhave paid a less expensive fine and not missed work and then she wouldn’t havegotten behind in her bills and bill collectors wouldn’t be after her. It was soinarguable, and put to her in such a calm manner, that it had stopped Wanda’sfit cold. After a moment of grumbling, Wanda had finally said, “I suppose you’reright.”Angela somehow ended up being the one person in Wanda’s life she would listento. Angela assumed it was because she didn’t really care if Wanda listened toher or not, while everyone else did and they almost always shouted at her,argued with her, or lectured her. While most people could set her off with onewrong word, Angela’s dispassionate advice had the opposite effect on her.Over time Wanda came to consider Angela a trusted friend. As far as Angela couldtell, her only friend. Wanda would confide things to Angela that she wouldconfide to no one else. Angela wasn’t trying to befriend Wanda or win her over,she was simply treating her the way she treated everyone.Although Wanda considered her a trusted friend, Angela most certainly didn’tfeel the same about Wanda. Angela didn’t have friends and didn’t want any.She did feel a bit sorry for her, though. She was a scatterbrain without commonsense who acted before she thought.Wanda had big breasts and a big mouth to match. She also had an open, friendlynature that made her the life of any party. The male customers loved her flirtypersonality, as well as her big breasts. The women, not so much. Especially whenshe put an easygoing hand on their men. Wanda was only too happy to be thecenter of attention. That was why Barry put up with Wanda’s troublesome side.“I really can’t leave the bar while we’re open,” Barry said. “I wish Wandawouldn’t pull this crap.”“You want me to go spring her?” she asked.Angela always did her best to avoid authorities. Unlike Wanda, she didn’t liketo give the police any reason to take notice of her or remember her. But Barrywas a good guy who had given her a chance with a good paying job and she feltbad that Wanda was dragging him into it.“And be down the both of you?” He shook his head. “Besides, those legs of yourssell a lot more drinks than a pudgy guy in khaki pants.”Angela had to smile. “I suppose so. Why not let her stew until after closing?”“That makes sense.” He thought about it briefly. “But after closing I need totake care of that damn tap coupling, the receipts, stocking up, and then I needto tally everything.”“Why don’t I go bail her out after closing?”Barry considered momentarily. “Tomorrow is Saturday. It’s going to be a busynight. Lots of men will be coming in tomorrow night and I really need her here.”He gave Angela a sideways look. “If you wouldn’t mind …”“That’s my other job, remember? I pick up packages.” Angela smiled. “You getthings ready for tomorrow and I’ll go get the crazy lady.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Angela found a parking spot on the street around the corner from the entrance tothe police station. She hadn’t wanted to walk into the station wearing thecutoff shorts she wore at work in the bar. Fortunately, she had a pair of jeansin her truck and was able to change first. Since it was spitting rain andthreatening to turn into a downpour, she put on a lightweight, hooded,waterproof jacket that she always kept in her pickup.The hood of the black jacket covered her red-tipped, platinum-blond hair. Likeher cutoff shorts, her hair drew attention, which was all well and good in thebar, or out in public, or when luring in a killer, but not so desirable in apolice station. With the jacket zipped all the way up, it also covered the bigtattoo across her throat, which she would rather not show off in a policestation because it was something people remembered.With her hood up against the rain and the drawstring pulled tight, she lookedreasonably unremarkable among the people in the station. Barry had already foundout that Wanda had been arraigned on trespassing charges earlier in the day andwas being held awaiting bail. At the arraignment her bond had been set at athousand dollars, but only ten percent cash was required.The police station was relatively busy, even in the middle of the night, or morelikely, Angela realized, because it was the middle of the night. As she knew alltoo well from working in a bar, darkness seemed to bring trouble out of thewoodwork.Angela found the bond window, paid the bail, and signed some papers. While shewas there she asked to read the charges. The policewoman behind the counterpulled a sheet out and handed it to Angela. When she finished reading it, shethanked the woman and handed it back.The benches were already packed, so she leaned against the wall as she waited.As she waited, she appraised the eyes of people, especially men, making sure shewas not in the presence of someone seriously dangerous.It was a half hour before a female officer came out from a hallway with Wanda intow. The policewoman took her to a counter where she was given back her bighandbag and the contents for her to check.As Angela watched Wanda put her loop earrings back on, she realized that whileshe thought of Wanda as one seriously screwed-up woman, she was actually quitestriking. She was the kind of woman that men seemed to fall in love with far tooquickly.Her head was shaved partway up on each side, leaving her thick, black hair tostand up on top and tumble down her broad shoulders in back. Sometimes she putit into a single, fat braid. Angela wouldn’t want that style of hair, but itworked well with the package that was Wanda.She was wearing a pink tank top that had difficulty containing her breasts, ablack miniskirt, and red strap heels. Apparently, she had been ready to go in towork at the bar when she had been arrested and taken to jail. Her figure wasactually quite shapely, even if her outfit was over-the-top. Over-the-top workedjust fine in her job at Barry’s Place and made her good tips.Wanda, jamming her things back into the big, gray leather handbag, looked likebottled fury as Angela stepped up to the counter beside her. “Thanks forcoming,” Wanda grumbled with a quick sideways glance. “I didn’t want to botheryou. I asked Barry to come. Why didn’t he come?” It was more an angry indictmentthan a question.“Yeah, well, Barry was pretty busy trying to fix a broken tap and gettingeverything else ready for a busy Saturday night, so I offered to come get you.”She nodded to Angela as she cast a glare back at the disinterested police behindthe counter. “Let’s get out of this dump.”“I’m parked just around the corner,” Angela said as they walked out into thelight rain.Wanda folded her arms against the wet night chill and put her head down againstthe steady, light rain. She hurried as best she could in high heels.Angela unlocked her truck and let Wanda in first to get her out of the rain,then took off the jacket and slipped in behind the wheel. Once the truck wasstarted she turned on the heater.“I left my car in the alley behind Brad’s place. I was getting my stuff when hecame home and called the cops.” She looked over. “Want to stop somewhere and geta drink? I could use a good stiff drink. I know a place—”“Thanks, but no thanks. It’s been a long day. I’ll take you to get your car,then we both need to get home and get a good night’s sleep.” Angela glanced overas Wanda looked out the side window into the dark night. “Tomorrow night isgoing to be busy.”Wanda turned back. “Was it busy tonight?”“As a matter of fact, it was. Without you there to help I feel like I ran amarathon.”Wanda stared out again at the lights flashing past in the rain. Her bluster wasalready fading. “Sorry to leave you hanging.”“Ricky Sparling asked about you. I told him that I would pass the message alongto you.”Wanda suddenly looked concerned. “You didn’t tell him I was in jail, did you?”“It was before you called Barry. I told him all I knew, that you were late, andI didn’t know where you were.”Wanda let out a sigh of relief. She fished her phone out of her handbag andchecked her messages, then started writing a text. Angela looked out of thecorner of her eye and could see that it was to Ricky. It said something aboutmaking it up to him.Ricky wasn’t the sharpest axe in the woods, but he worked hard and made goodmoney. He also had the kind of weak-willed personality that needed a strongwoman to give him directions. Wanda was just that sort of woman and more.After she sent the text she put the phone away and turned to Angela. “Say, wouldyou mind if I spent the night at your place?”Angela nearly drove off the road. She quickly pulled herself together. “You needto go home to your own place.”“Well, I gave up my apartment to live with Brad. Since he kicked me out so hecould screw around with some whore, my place at the moment is back home with myGod-fearing parents. If I go there I’ll have to listen to another lecture aboutGod’s plan for me and how I’m disrespecting him. They’re such jerks.”Wanda was gasoline. Her parents seemed to be a lit match.She smoothed her skirt on her lap. “So, what do you say? Can I crash with you?”Angela thought that being simple and straightforward would be best. “Sorry, no.”Wanda frowned. “Why not?”“First of all, nothing personal, but I never let anyone stay at my house. I worklong, hard hours. It’s my sanctuary away from everything and everyone and I wantit to stay that way. Secondly, I have no intention of making the situation morecomfortable for you just because you screwed up.”Wanda looked out the side window again. “Yeah, I guess I did kind of screwthings up.”“You have keys to your mom and dad’s house, right?”Wanda nodded.“And you still have your room there, right?”“Yeah. They keep it for me. I think they’re hoping I’ll somehow magically turnback to being fourteen so they can have a do-over with raising me.”“So, listen to me. I want you to go home, quietly let yourself in, leave a noteon their coffeemaker saying you’re asleep in your room and to let you sleep inbecause you got in late and you have to work Saturday night. Draw a heart on it,or something. Can you do that?”“I suppose,” she mumbled. “But it wasn’t my fault—”“So your ex-boyfriend broke his own window and called the cops and made up astory that it was you?” Angela wasn’t going to let her shift the blame for hersituation.“Well, no. But if he wouldn’t have—”“When I paid the bond, I read Brad’s statement in the complaint to the police.”“Yeah, well Brad is a lying asshole.” Wanda thought about that a moment and thenwas overcome with a curious frown. “Where do you live, anyway? I never haveheard where you live.”Angela never let anyone know where she lived. She greatly valued her privacy—andother things about her place in the woods. Her mail even went to Mike’s MailService.“I live alone out in the country in a place my grandfather built.”“Doesn’t that get kind of lonely?”“No. I don’t get lonely. I guess I’m strange that way.” Angela knew Wanda wastrying to change the subject of her guilt. She didn’t let her. “So did you stealBrad’s gun?”Wanda looked over in surprise. “What?”“Brad said in his statement to the police that you stole his gun.”“Brad’s an asshole. I told you that.”“Did you steal his gun?”Wanda huffed. “Brad’s got this big three-fifty-seven Magnum revolver. He likesto show it off because he thinks it makes his dick bigger.”“Did you steal it?”“What would I want with a gun? He changed the locks and wouldn’t meet me thereto get my stuff, so before I came in to work I broke a little window and went into get my clothes. Big deal; it’s just ten dollars’ worth of glass to fix thewindow. He’s just trying to cause trouble for me because I caught him cheating.”“Did you steal his gun?”“He held me against my will for the police.” She leaned over indignantly.“That’s kidnapping! He threatened me. He said if I tried to leave he’d hurt me.Brad has a nasty temper. He’s smacked me around a few times, so I knew he wasn’tbluffing.“Then these hard-ass cops showed up. After they cuffed me and patted me downreal good, if you know what I mean, they put me in the back of their police carwhile they searched my car looking for the gun Brad told them I stole.“The only thing in my car was my clothes that I took out of Brad’s place. Theydidn’t find any gun or anything else of his. That’s why they couldn’t charge mewith theft of a weapon. Brad’s an asshole and he was just trying to cause metrouble.”“You’re lucky the charge was only trespassing.”“The police only took me to jail because Brad insisted on pressing charges, andtrespassing was all they could come up with. I didn’t take anything other thanmy own clothes, so they couldn’t charge me with theft. If the cops wouldn’t havebeen such pricks they would have just let me go and told me to stay away fromBrad’s place or they would arrest me if I came back. That’s what they shouldhave done. But they didn’t. They wanted me in the back of their car with myhands cuffed behind my back, so they could watch me in the backseat and try tolook up my skirt.” She stared ahead. “Perverts.”Angela drove in silence, wondering if there was a grain of truth in Wanda’sstory. She knew from personal experience that there were police who could bereal jerks. There were times when they came to her mother’s trailer when theyhad been more than jerks. That’s why she didn’t like having anything to do withthem. She gritted her teeth at her own memories of encounters with police on apower trip.Wanda used her fingers to fluff her wet hair. “Did Ricky say he thinks I’m hot?”Angela came back from her unpleasant memories and frowned over at Wanda. “Whatis this, study hall in high school?”Wanda shrugged. “I think I’m falling in love with him.” She frowned as a suddenthought came to her. She leaned a little toward Angela. “Ricky Sparling is mine.Don’t you dare wrap those long legs of yours around him.”Angela kept her gaze out at the rainy road. “Ricky Sparling is married.”“I know that. But his wife is a bitch. She cheats on him.”“Isn’t that what he’s doing with you?”“Yeah, but that’s because the bitch won’t give him a divorce because she wantshis money, so he’s going to have to divorce her instead. But first he needs tohire a private detective to follow her around and get proof of all herextramarital affairs so he has grounds for the divorce. I can’t imagine why anywoman would do that to him. I’d never cheat on him. He’d be all I ever wanted.”Angela was tired. She knew Wanda’s fuse was already lit, so she kept herthoughts to herself as she drove to Brad’s run-down little house in a run-downpart of town. Even this late, and even in the rain, there were people out on thestreet or huddled against buildings. From a lifetime of experience, she couldeasily spot half a dozen drug deals going down.She always carried a gun, if not on her, then in the center armrest, so shewasn’t worried, but this wasn’t a neighborhood where women should be alone. Shedrove into the alley behind Brad’s house and stopped behind Wanda’s faded redhatchback.“Go home and get some sleep,” she told Wanda. “I need you there tomorrow night.If you don’t pull it together Barry is going to finally get fed up and fireyou.”Wanda nodded. “Yeah, I know. I’ll be there. Thanks for coming and getting me,Angela.”Halfway out of the truck, she stopped and turned back. “Can I ask you aquestion?”“You’re just full of questions tonight.”Wanda grinned. “I’m a curious girl. What does that big tattoo across your throatmean? ‘Dark Angel.’ What’s it mean?”“Your parents taught you to pray, didn’t they?”“Are you kidding? I spent half my childhood on my knees praying.”“Then pray that you never have a reason to learn what it means. Good night,Wanda.”Wanda wasn’t sure what Angela meant. “All right. Good night. And thanks againfor bailing me out. You’re a doll.”Angela waited until Wanda had started her car and driven off down the alleybefore backing out into the street and turning around to go home.She was glad to be rid of the crazy lady so she could finally go home to peaceand quiet and get some sleep.Home. It suddenly occurred to her why Bardolph the wolf had come around herhouse with his new mate.“I’ll be damned,” she said under her breath as she drove through the rainy nighttoward her remote house in the mountains where wolves lived."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5Wanda drove her small Chevy hatchback slowly down the narrow alley, navigatingaround tipped-over trash cans and junk appliances people had piled to the side.She watched in her rearview mirror, through the rain running down the backwindow, as Angela backed her truck out of the alley, swung around, and headedoff in the opposite direction. As soon as the lights of Angela’s pickup were outof sight, Wanda turned right out of the alley and drove around the block to comeback in the alley again.Angela was the one person Wanda trusted. Angela wasn’t like anyone else sheknew. She was smarter than anyone else she knew. Not necessarily book smart, butlife smart. It often felt like Angela could look into her eyes and tell what shewas thinking, or even what she had done. Angela just seemed to know things rightout of thin air. Angela always told Wanda the truth, but without bitching at herlike everyone else. Wanda adored her like a big sister.Even so, Wanda could hardly tell Angela everything.She drove slowly, hoping not to make enough noise to wake anyone. She stopped inthe same spot she’d just been parked in. She left the engine running and theheadlights on. She got out and pushed the door closed without latching it so asto make as little noise as possible.She looked across the alley at Brad’s house. The lights weren’t on. She wouldhave loved to have thrown a rock through his bedroom window. It would probablyscare the crap out of whatever whore he was sleeping with.But she had more important things to do.She squatted down in the weeds beside three heavily dented trash cans. In thelight from the headlights, she looked behind the cans, among scrap pieces ofboards and old wood paneling. She found the small square of weathered plywoodshe was looking for. Its edges were delaminated, wrinkled, and cracking apart.Afraid of getting splinters, she lifted it carefully. With all the spiderwebs inthe weeds, she was worried about spiders.There, under the pieces of plywood, was the zippered cloth gun case holding the.357 Magnum revolver and three full boxes of bullets. She reached in and quicklypulled it out, hoping not to give any spiders time to bite her.Once she had retrieved the gun, she hurried back to her car and put the gun caseinto the big, gray, sloppy handbag she was carrying that day expressly becauseit was big enough to easily conceal the gun. She smiled to herself as she putthe car in gear and rolled slowly out of the alley.She had to smile, too, at having the forethought to hide the gun. She hadn’tknown Brad would come home and catch her, much less call the police, but she hadbeen concerned that he might see her and follow her, or even, once he came homeand found his gun missing, go to her parents and break into her car looking forit. She’d hidden it so she could come back at a later date and retrieve it afterthings had cooled down.Since the police had already searched her car, that had convinced Brad, and thepolice, that she hadn’t taken his gun.She was smarter than both Brad and the cops. She’d told them when they cuffedher that it was a bad neighborhood. Anyone could have gotten in his house andstolen it. She’d even convinced Angela that she hadn’t taken Brad’s gun.She had to grin at the thought of police searching her car and failing to findthe gun Brad had been yelling about, and at the look on Brad’s face when theycame back and told him she didn’t have his gun. He’d been so sure she had takenit. It made him look stupid.Brad had told her once, when he was showing off the handgun, that a hollow-point.357 slug would go into a person like a nickel and come out the other side likea bag of quarters.He thought the gun made him tough. She wondered how tough he felt now. At first,she hadn’t really cared about the gun, she just wanted to take it away from him.Now, she was glad to have it. The gun made her just as tough as he was.Wanda’s mood darkened as she drove through the alley, envisioning blowing Brad’sbrains out. It felt good thinking about it.By the time she reached her parents’ house she was exhausted from all thetrouble Brad and the police had caused her. She wished she could somehow geteven with him for cheating on her and throwing her out. She slipped her handinto her handbag and felt the gun case. She smiled at having taken the bastard’sprize handgun. It felt like she had taken his manhood.Wanda parked on the street in front of her parents’ house behind a car up onblocks. She was careful never to leave any valuables in her car because it wassuch a bad neighborhood. Even though her car was a piece of shit, it was betterthan most of the cars in the neighborhood. She hated the place.She had keys to the house, so she let herself in and then quietly closed thefront door, hoping not to have to talk to her parents. When she turned aroundshe was momentarily startled by the figure of her father standing in the shadowsnot far away at the bottom of the stairs.She put a hand to the top of her chest, catching her breath. “You scared thecrap out of me!”His expression was grim. Standing there in her mother’s fluffy slippers, plaidboxer shorts, and an undershirt he looked silly.“I saw that you called from the police station,” he said. “What have you donethis time?”Wanda’s temper heated. “Why didn’t you answer the damn phone and come help getme out?”“Your whole life your mother and I have done our best to raise you to be aGod-fearing young woman. When you got into trouble we prayed with you to drivethe devil’s influence from you and to guide you to the right path. But youalways let the devil back in.“I work too hard for my money to use it to bail you out of jail when it could goto better use at the church. I’ll not steal from what should go to them to bailyou out anymore. You don’t need bail money, you need the devil beaten out ofyou. You’re not too old for that, you know.”“Fuck you,” she snapped as she stormed past.Wanda had never walked the right path, as he put it. She had always pretended,but she never really cared about any of their religious nonsense. Once she hadmoved out, she thought she was finally free of it all, and now, because of thatbastard Brad, here she was, right back in her parents’ house again.She slammed her bedroom door and then flopped down on the bed. She put her headin her hands. She was sick and tired of everyone causing her problems.She wished that she hadn’t given up her apartment, but Brad had wanted her tomove in with him. She realized now that he had been playing her so he could haveready access to pussy.She needed to get a place to stay, but bill collectors were already after herand her credit was shot. Apartments checked credit records. She dreaded thethought of having to get a slum apartment, but things would get ugly if shestayed at her parents’ for long.She fished her phone out of her big handbag.sorry i missed u at the bar. my a hole x was causing me problems again.In a few moments he texted back. Sorry. I was asleep. You going to be at Barry’sPlace tonight?Yes.Okay, I’ll talk to you then. Good night, babe.Wanda flicked the phone back on the bed. She was wired after confronting herfather, as if he knew anything about life outside his stupid church. She hadwanted to talk to Ricky. It irritated her that he would rather sleep than talkto her. She thought, then, that he probably couldn’t talk because he was in bedright next to his wife.Wanda was going to have to do something about that."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6After a busy day with her messenger service, delivering packets for her lawyercustomers, Angela finally made her way up her long drive, glad to be home ifonly for a little while. She always loved the solitude of her place in the woodsamong the mountains. She was hungry and looked forward to making herself somedinner before changing for work at Barry’s Place. The peace and quiet in thewoods surrounding her house steeled her for the noise and all the people at thebar where she worked.It was tough having two jobs, but for the time being the work was there and themoney was good. She missed not being able to spend more time at home hikingthrough the mountains, but there might not always be work. Growing up as she hadhad taught her to expect that bad times would always come around.She put olive oil in a pan on the stove and then laid in a chicken breast. Sheleft the back door open so that the aroma of the cooking chicken would drift outinto the woods while she went through the mail she had picked up from Mike’sMail Service on her way home. She threw away the advertisements and set thebills aside on the kitchen table.When she leaned back to look out the open back door, she saw Bardolph not faraway at the edge of the woods. He was pacing. Angela smiled at seeing him. Asshe had done every day for several weeks, she had taken two half chickens out ofthe refrigerator.She picked up the chicken waiting on the counter and took it outside. Bardolphknew her, but he was still a wild animal and wary. She was well aware that hehad the potential to be extremely dangerous. Both wolves were hungry. She didn’twant to end up being their meal instead of the chicken, so she always kept a gunon her just to be on the safe side.Standing out back, Angela heaved one of the chicken halves as far as she could.Bardolph paused, looking around briefly to see if it was safe. Finallysatisfied, he came closer and snatched up the chicken. He carried it back in hismouth and placed it before the female wolf as she emerged from the shadows.Bardolph quickly returned to retrieve the second half when Angela tossed ittoward him.Each holding a prize, the wolves quickly retreated into the edge of the forest.Angela was pretty sure Bardolph’s mate was carrying pups and that was why he hadsought out her place. When he had been recovering from being shot, Angela hadfed him raw chicken. Now he had a mate and she needed food.Although the woods surrounding Angela’s place were vast, food was still hard tocome by. A pregnant female wolf would need to eat. When they eventually took adeer, or caught small animals, Angela knew they would stop coming around. Wolveswould rather fend for themselves than have any contact with people. Until then,Angela was a source of food they could count on when they needed it.Watching them as they vanished into the woods, she marveled at the rareprivilege of seeing such magnificent, wild creatures. Not many people would everhave the chance she did to experience such things. It was just one more reasonher place was so important to her, and why she never let people come around. Shewanted to keep her place wild and special.Angela stood in the doorway for a time, gazing off into the dark woods. Shecouldn’t see the wolves anymore, but she knew they were out there, somewhere.When she heard one of them let out a long, wild howl, she smiled and went backinside to finish cooking her own dinner."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7Angela looked up from mixing a couple of drinks and saw Wanda swoop in the doorlooking hurried. Angela sighed inwardly with relief that help had arrived. Shehad been wondering if it would. Barry had, too. He was on the edge again withWanda.For the last several weeks she had been showing up when she was scheduled.Angela suspected it was because Ricky Sparling had become a regular on Wanda’snights. When she missed the start of this shift, Angela had begun to worry thatshe had fallen off the “no drama” wagon. Thankfully she was only late.“Good,” Barry said as he passed behind Angela. “Crazy Wanda has graced us withher royal presence.”“She’s only a little late,” Angela said, wondering as she said it why she wasdefending her.Wanda came around behind the bar and put her purse under the counter. “Sorry I’mlate,” she said, catching her breath. “I ran into Albert out in the parkinglot.”Angela put the two mixed drinks on a tray. “Well, you’re here just in time totake this to table twelve.”Angela watched Wanda saunter among the tables to the calls and whistles of a fewmen. She swung her hips in a show as she lifted an arm and twirled a hand inappreciation of her fans. Wanda had arrived, the party could begin. She set thedrinks down and whispered in the ear of one of the men. He laughed and swattedher bottom as she left.When she returned with the empty tray and a big grin, she handed it across thebar to Angela. “They said you might as well start making them a second round.”Angela smiled to herself at Wanda’s sales ability.Wanda leaned in to be heard over the music. “So, he said that you would give methe twenty back.”Angela collected an empty and quickly wiped down the bar as a man left. “Whatare you talking about?”“Albert,” Wanda said, as if that was explanation enough.Angela frowned as she pulled a couple of bottles from the cooler for an order.“Who the hell is Albert?”Wanda leaned farther in on the bar. “Don’t be silly.”“I’m not being silly. I don’t know an Albert.”“Albert,” Wanda repeated as if Angela was being dense. “You know, Albert. Yourfather.”Angela straightened. “What?”“Your father. Albert.” She flicked her hand over her shoulder toward the door.“I saw him in the parking lot.”“Old guy, leather ball cap? Riding a pink girl’s bike?”“That’s him. Looks like he’s down on his luck. He asked for a twenty. Real nicelike. He said that he didn’t want to come in and bother you while you wereworking and that you would pay me back.”Angela was instantly fuming. “You gave him money?”Wanda looked puzzled. “He’s your father, isn’t he? He looked like he’s run intohard times. He said he knew you were busy and asked if I could give him atwenty. He said, ‘My daughter will gladly pay you back.’ ”Angela could feel her face heat with anger. “You gave that junkie money?”“Well, yeah. Like I said, he told me he was your dad.”Angela threw the towel down beside the sink. “I’ll be right back.”Angela hurried through the crowded bar and raced out into the parking lot. Shestopped and looked around. She spotted him leaning against her truck, smoking acigarette. His bike was lying on the ground.As Angela marched toward him, he saw her coming and quickly picked up hisbicycle. He put the cigarette between his lips and hopped on his bike. Angelaraced across the lot, but he was already pedaling away. He glanced back over hisshoulder once, lifted his arm high to give her the finger, and then was gonedown the road, happy that she knew he’d gotten back at her.Back inside, Wanda returned to the bar after delivering drinks. “What was thatall about?”“That bum isn’t my father.” Angela pulled four five-dollar bills out of her tippocket. “Here. He conned you out of this. It’s not your fault. You were justbeing nice.”Wanda looked a bit confused. “He said he was your father.”“I know, but he was only saying that to get money so he could get himself somebooze or maybe some arm candy.”Wanda shrugged as she stuffed the cash into a pocket. She looked a bit confused.“Are you sure?”Angela let out a deep breath. “My mother’s a drug addict. Whoever got herpregnant with me could be any one of the other addicts she slept with. Therewere plenty of possibilities. I suppose it’s not out of the question that hecould have been the one who got her pregnant.”“Oh. Well, sorry.”“Not your fault, but don’t give him money anymore unless you don’t expect me topay you back. I work too hard to throw my money away on panhandlers.”Wanda turned when she saw Ricky Sparling coming in the door. “There’s my guy.”She was suddenly all sparkles and grins. “I have to go say hi.”Angela caught her arm. “Your guy? Wanda, have you forgotten? Ricky Sparling ismarried.”“I know. But he’s taking care of that.”Angela let the woman’s arm go. “You’re just asking for grief.” Even as she saidit, she knew it was wasted effort.“Don’t worry. We’ll be able to be together soon.”With that she hurried off to sit on Ricky’s lap as she gave him a big kiss thatearned a scattering of applause. Ricky had taken a table in the corner where hecould watch Wanda go about her job. Angela thought he looked like a lost puppywaiting patiently for affection. Little did he know exactly what kind of womanhad a leash around his neck.Later that night, when the crowd had thinned, Wanda came up to the bar andleaned over close. “I’m going to take a short break. Cover for me, okay?”Before Angela could agree, Wanda had already danced over to Ricky and grabbedhis hand. She pulled him outside with her.Angela forgot all about it until twenty or thirty minutes later when Wandafloated back in. All smiles, she leaned over the bar toward Angela to be heardover the music.“I’m back,” she said, still catching her breath. “I had to take care of my man.”She winked at Angela as she reached for a tray of drinks that needed to bedelivered.Angela put a hand on her arm to stop her. “You better go fix your lipstick,first. It’s all over your face.”Wanda giggled as if embarrassed, which she was not. “Oops. Thanks.” She left thetray and hurried toward the bathroom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8Wanda breathlessly pulled Ricky’s hand out from under her tank top.“What’s wrong?” he asked, equally breathlessly.“I have to get home to bed.” That was a lie, of course, but she was growingirritated with the stalled progress of their relationship. She had thought thatby now he would have rid himself of his wife and they would be able to move intogether in his nice house in a nice part of town. She’d driven past it a numberof times, dreaming.He smiled and started kissing her neck while pushing his hand under her topagain. “That sounds good to me.”She pushed him off her. “It sounds good to me, too. It sounds a lot better thanthe backseat of your Suburban. But I’ve already told you a dozen times that youcan’t come to my parents’ house. They’re crazy religious. They would never allowa man to be there with me. They would think you were the devil. My father wouldgo berserk and probably beat the both of us.”“Well, we could go up to the Riley Motel.”“With the prostitutes turning tricks? You really want people to think I’m awhore?”“No, of course not—”“Maybe that’s all I really am to you. A whore you can bang.”“Babe, no, don’t say that. You know I love you. It’s just that you said you weregoing to get a place of your own. When you do we could go there, and we wouldn’thave to go to a motel where people would think less of you.”Wanda fussed with her hair, trying to get it back into place. The parking lotoutside the bar was empty except for her car and Ricky’s big Suburban, which hehad parked out back.“And you said that you were going to be filing papers to divorce her. You’vebeen saying it for a month, now, that once you filed the papers she would be outand then I could move in with you. Why should I get a place if I’m going to bemoving in with you?”Ricky sat back. “Babe, you know I’m trying to handle it. My wife is giving meall kinds of grief. She’s a witch on wheels. I hate her. I wish she would justdrop dead.”Wanda stared at him, liking the thought. “So, you still haven’t filed thepapers?”“Well, no, not exactly. You know how it is. First things first. I’ll think ofsomething. I promise.”“What about the private detective? Hasn’t he gotten anything on her yet?”Ricky hesitated. “He will, babe. I’m sure he will. In the meantime, I have toplay it cool, you know? We have to be careful. If my wife caught us together shewould be able to throw me out and she would get everything.”“What do you have that makes that much of a difference? You don’t have kids. Youhave a job, she can get a job. You just split things up and each go yourseparate way. You pull down good money with your business. You can get anotherplace. Then we’d be done with her and we could be together. That’s what you’realways telling me you want.”“And I do want that, but she’ll take the house if I don’t get something on her,first.”Wanda shrugged. “So what? You make good money. She’d be out of the picture andthen we could get a new place and be together. That’s what matters.”“But my parents left me the house. It’s paid off. It’s worth a lot. I don’t wantto lose it. Our marriage has been over for a long time and I’ve told her weshould split up, but she won’t go along with getting a divorce. She said that Ishould just go right ahead and leave her if that’s what I want and then she’llget the house and a nice big alimony check every week. Damn, Wanda, she wouldget half of what my business is worth. You know how hard I’ve worked for what Ihave. She hasn’t done a damn thing for the business. She just sits on her ass,but she’d still get half of it.”“And that’s what matters to you? Is that more important than us being together?”“Well, no, but …”“If you really loved me you’d get her out of your life—one way or another.You’re a big strong guy. You need to man up and stop letting her push youaround.”“I know, babe, but let’s talk about it later, okay?”She pushed him away when he tried to get on top of her. “You’re pussy whipped. Ihave to go home and get some sleep and think about where my life is going. Ithought it was going to be with you, but now you’re making me doubt that you’reman enough to do what needs to be done. Maybe I need to find me a real man.”“Come on, babe, don’t be like that. You know I love you and all I want is to bewith you.”“If you really mean that, Ricky, then you would have the balls to do somethingabout it. There are other ways to get rid of her besides divorce.”He wasn’t getting the hint. She could see that sooner or later she was going tohave to lay it all out for him. If she was going to have him and his big housein a nice part of town, she was going to have to take charge and tell him whatto do. She knew how to make men do what she wanted.“It won’t be much longer, I promise. I’ll call the detective in the morning andsee if he has anything yet. I know she’s cheating on me. I just need him tocatch her at it and then I can file for divorce and have her kicked out. Then wewill have the house with her out of the picture and she won’t get anything.”Out of the picture was exactly what Wanda wanted.“How much longer is that going to take?”He ran a hand back over his face. “Not much longer. I promise.”Wanda knew that the whole detective thing was a dead end, but for the time beingshe had to play along. Once it fell through she would exert her control over himand then solve the problem once and for all.Wanda opened the door. “It had better not, Ricky. I’m getting sick and tired ofthis. If you want to be with me, then you need to get rid of the bitch. Thebackseat of your truck isn’t my idea of how I want to be together with the man Ilove. I thought you loved me, too. Or maybe you just want to get laid?”“No, no, I swear. It’s not like that. I do love you, I swear.” He tried to puthis arm around her, but she twisted out of his embrace and stepped down to thepavement. She leaned back in.“If you really mean that, then one way or another, you need to get rid of her,understand?”He nodded. “Okay, I’ll think of something.”Wanda had already thought of something."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9Wanda was in a dead sleep when someone pounding on the front door brought herhalf awake. She could tell by the light leaking in around the curtain that itwas midmorning. When she came home from working late at the bar, she usuallyslept at least until noon. She knew it couldn’t be noon, yet. She groaned androlled over, hoping the racket would end so she could drop back into the balm ofsleep.Then she heard a woman yelling. Wanda didn’t recognize the voice. Probablysomeone from their church, or maybe a neighbor. She heard her father sayingsomething to try to calm the woman down, but he started getting angry himself.Despite all his talk of God and the true path and seeking the Lord’s guidance,her father had a mean streak. His angry fits could last for hours. Afterward, hesometimes felt guilty and spent hours praying with Wanda’s mother, trying tosmooth over the scene he’d made, asking the Lord for forgiveness.There had been plenty of times when Wanda had been little when he’d flown into arage and beaten her. She couldn’t remember having deserved it, but she couldclearly remember the injustice of times when he accused her of things she hadn’tdone and then whipped her with his belt.A number of times he accused her of serving the devil and tried to beat the evilout of her. Her mother never lifted a finger to stop the beatings. When she hadbeen in tears afterward, her mother not only never tried to soothe her, buttreated her with cold indifference.God might have forgiven the both of them, but Wanda never had.She knew that her father wouldn’t dare lay a finger on her now. The last timehe’d flown into a rage over some boy she had been seeing and yanked his beltfree of his pants, she had leaned in and said, “Go ahead and do it. Then I’llcall the police. I’m underage. You’ll go to jail. Social service will take meout of this hellhole. What will people in your church think of you then?” Thathad wilted his fit.When there was an urgent knock at her bedroom door, Wanda sat up and rubbed hereyes. “What!”Her mother pushed open the door. Wanda could see her dark shape in the dim lightof the hallway.“Wanda, you had better get out here. There’s a woman out here demanding to seeyou.”Wanda flopped back on the bed. “Whoever it is, tell her to go away.”Her mother came to the bed and shook her arm. “Wanda, get out there, now!”Wanda could tell by her mother’s tone that she wasn’t going to let it go, soWanda swung her legs around and put her feet on the floor. She sat on the edgeof the bed as she stretched and yawned. Her mother threw her robe at her.“Here. Put this on. Hurry up.”She didn’t know what her mother could be so upset about, but Wanda was gettingangry. She didn’t like being woken up, especially by her parents. She was anadult. She didn’t want her parents coming into her room anymore. By the time shehad her robe on, she was in a murderous mood.She threw the robe closed and tied it as she hurried down the dark hall. All thecurtains in the house were still drawn, so it had to be early morning. The frontdoor stood open. Wanda saw a rather chunky woman in ugly jeans that showed off abulging belly and a broad, fat ass. Her short, curly hair made her look twicewhat was probably her true age. She stood with her fists on her hips as sheglared, watching Wanda come into the room.Wanda’s father held an arm out. “This young woman would like to speak with you.”Wanda frowned. “Who are you, and what the hell do you want this early in themorning?”The woman charged right up into Wanda’s face. “I’m Ricky Sparling’s wife, that’swho the hell I am!”Wanda shoved her back. “So what?”“I heard you’re the whore he’s been screwing.”“Who told you that?”“It doesn’t matter who told me. I know it’s true!”“And how would you know it’s true?” Wanda scoffed.“Because when I asked Ricky if it was true he was screwing a cheap tramp namedWanda from the bar he goes to, he got that shit-eating expression on his faceand he couldn’t look me in the eye. He couldn’t even come up with a lie. He knewhe’d been caught, and I knew that what I’d been told was true.”Before Wanda could say anything, the woman shook her finger right in Wanda’sface. “If you come sniffing around him again I’m going to strangle the life outof you! Got it, bitch?”The woman didn’t wait for an answer. She stormed out the open door and down thewalk to her car. The tires squealed as she sped away.Wanda’s father quietly closed the front door.With a grim look, her mother folded her arms. “Well?”Wanda glared. “Well, what?”“Is that woman’s husband cheating on her with you?”“Why don’t you two mind your own business?”“You’re living in our house, so it is our business!” her father yelled.“Adultery is a serious sin! It’s a sign that the devil works through you!”“Fuck off,” Wanda said as she turned toward her room.“Wanda!” her mother called after her. “We won’t have you speak to us in thatway. You will show us proper respect.”Wanda rolled her eyes as she started toward her room. Her father grabbed her bythe arm hard enough to leave bruises. He yanked her back around. “You heard me.As long as you live under our roof, you are going to live a God-fearing life.”“I told you, I’m going to get my own place, so you don’t need to worry aboutit.”“When? It had better be soon. We aren’t going to put up with you bringing evilinto our home.”“I’m leaving as soon as I get dressed. Is that soon enough for you? I don’t needany more crap from the two of you.”“As soon as you leave, I’m going to have the locks changed. When you accept theLord as your savior and renounce your sinful ways then we’ll allow you to comehome again, but not before!”Wanda was too angry to say anything, so she marched off and slammed the door toher room.As she pulled out a suitcase she tried to think who could have told Ricky’s wifeabout them. Ricky had always said that they needed to be careful until he couldget something on her so he could be the one to file for divorce. Who knew aboutthem?Wanda paused from stuffing clothes in the suitcase and straightened. Shesuddenly realized who it had to be. There was only one person who could havetold Ricky’s wife that he was seeing Wanda. It couldn’t be. But it had to betrue.Wanda’s anger turned white hot."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10Wanda left her parents’ house as soon as she had packed a couple of suitcasesand stuffed some shoes, hair products, and her makeup case into tote bags. Herparents were still in the living room, still ranting about Wanda’s sins. Sheignored them on her way out. She could hear the front door being locked behindher.She drove around for a while, seething over the betrayal, furious over whatRicky’s wife had said to her. The nerve of the woman had Wanda gritting herteeth in a rage and squeezing the life out of the steering wheel.She had no place to stay and no one to stay with, so she got a room at the RileyMotel. The place was a dump, but it was by-the-week and cheap, which was all shecould afford, and besides, she didn’t plan on living there long. She was sickand tired of waiting on other people to make the changes that needed to be made.It was time for her to take control and set things right.Ricky wasn’t ever going to do what needed doing on his own. He didn’t have thenecessary initiative. Fortunately, Ricky was pliable as putty. She simply neededto mold him to do what needed to be done.It wasn’t her night to work. It was Angela’s night, though. Wanda was livid thatsomeone had gone behind her back and told Ricky’s wife about them. Itcomplicated things.There was only one person it could be: Angela.Angela was always reminding her that Ricky was married. Wanda had thought sheand Angela were friends. It was hard to believe that Angela would stab her inthe back like this. It had to be that she was jealous of what Wanda had withRicky. Otherwise a friend wouldn’t go behind a friend’s back and double-crossthem.The more she thought about the betrayal the angrier she became. She couldn’t getit out of her mind. The way Ricky’s wife had barged in on Wanda was humiliating.All because Angela had betrayed her.Once it was dark, she drove down the long hill and cruised through the parkinglot of Barry’s Place. She saw Angela’s pickup parked there, but not finding whoshe was looking for she kept going, trying to think of where he could be. Shedrove slowly through the parking lot of a small nearby strip mall, but didn’tsee him there, either. Since he seemed to hang around the bar a lot, she wentback there, thinking he might have shown up by then. No luck. She drove slowlythrough a couple of neighborhoods known for drugs, but he was nowhere to beseen.On her way back to the bar again she finally spotted him at a liquor store. Hewas leaning up against the wall on the darker side of the building, smoking acigarette and drinking from a bottle in a brown paper bag. His pink bicycle wasleaned up against the wall next to him. He was alone.Wanda parked right in front of him and shut off the engine. He watched warily asshe got out of her car, ready to bolt if it turned out to be trouble.“Albert?”He looked even more ready to run.“Albert, I’m a friend of Angela’s. Your daughter. Remember? I gave you a twentyone night in the parking lot of Barry’s Place.”He finally nodded that he remembered. “What do you want? I can’t give you thetwenty back. I told you to get it from my daughter.”Wanda smiled as she approached. “I know. Angela already paid me back for themoney I gave you.”“Good,” he said, still wary. “I told you she would.”“I was wondering if you’d like to earn some more money.”He used a thumb to push the bill of his leather ball cap up a little as hefrowned at her. “What did you have in mind?”“I just need some information. I’m willing to pay you for it.”“How much?”Wanda shrugged. “Depends on how helpful you can be.”He stood up away from the building and looked around suspiciously, fearing itmight be some kind of trap.“What could I possibly tell you that you’d pay me for?”“You said that Angela is your daughter. She says otherwise.”“So?”“So, if you really are her father, it seems to me like you would know where shelives.”He took off the cap and scratched his scalp as he thought. What sparse hair hehad was gray and wispy thin. He looked up.“I used to hang around with Sally, Angela’s mother. When Angela was young sheoften went to stay with her grandparents at their place out in the countryside.It was way out in the mountains. Could that be the place you mean?”Wanda smiled. Angela had told her that her grandfather had built the house shelived in. “That’s the place. Do you know where it is?”He squinted out into the darkness. He looked back at her.“How much is this information worth to you?”“How much do you want for it?”“A hundred bucks.”Wanda considered a moment. “All right. Tell me where it is and I’ll give you ahundred dollars.”He scratched his cheek. “I grew up in Milford Falls, so I tend to know whereeverything is. I have the general idea of the area in my head, but I can’tremember well enough that I could give you exact directions. I’d have to drivearound with you until I recognized the correct roads.”“Okay. Put your bike in the back of my car and let’s go.”He leaned back against the building and folded his arms. “You just asked if Iknew. A guided tour of the back roads to find her place will cost you an extratwenty.”Wanda leaned back in the car for her billfold and took out three twenties. Justby his facial features, she didn’t really believe that he was Angela’s father,but if he knew where Angela lived, that was good enough. She held the twentiesout to him.“Half now and the other half once you show me her place.”He studied the money in her hand, then her eyes, and then he took the cash. Hefolded it and stuffed it into a pocket.“When do you want to go there?”Angela was at work, so Wanda knew she wouldn’t be home for hours and hours. “Iwant to go now.”He nodded once. “All right, then. You open the hatch of your car and I’ll put mybike in.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11After a long shift at the bar, Angela was looking forward to some solitude andsome sleep. Brandy, the girl who alternated with Wanda on her nights off, was alot less tiring to work with. She was cheerful, friendly, and efficient. Moreimportantly, she was not subject to the same dark moods that could make for along night.But then Barry had told her that Wanda had called in and quit. It was Wanda’sregular night off, as was the next night, so at least it gave Barry a couple ofdays to hire a replacement. He said that a woman, Tiffany, had come in askingabout work, and that she seemed like a good fit for the spot. Angela was gladshe wasn’t going to have to handle things alone, although she had done thatenough not to be worried about it. She was puzzled, though, as to why Wandawould simply up and quit.After she parked her pickup in front of her house and shut off the engine,Angela put her head back against the headrest for a moment, just to enjoy thesilence. When Bardolph howled, she smiled. She was excited that she would beable to get a glimpse of him and his mate. Seeing such magnificent creatures wasalways a treat.Once inside, she took out a couple of half chickens and set them on the counterwhile changing out of her work clothes. She was looking forward to a hot showerand a good night’s sleep, but first she wanted to take the chicken out to thewolves.Angela took one of the chicken halves out the back door in her left hand. In herother hand she carried a gun, as she always did. Even though they accepted ahandout of raw chicken, they were still wild animals and Angela knew better thanto assume they weren’t dangerous. Angela wasn’t so much worried about Bardolph,because he knew her, but the female had shown herself to be aggressive. Beingpregnant probably only made her more edgy.As Angela walked out into the moonlit backyard, she spotted Bardolph sittingback at the edge of the woods. He let out a long, mournful howl. Angela frownedat how different it sounded from his usual howls.And then she suddenly saw why.Angela had almost stepped on the female wolf lying dead at her feet.In sudden shock and dismay, Angela knelt down beside the dead animal. It had anentry wound through the front of its chest, exiting out the back where thedamage was extensive. It seemed clear that someone had shot the wolf with alarge-caliber weapon.Angela ran her hand over the lifeless pups in the dead female’s cold womb. “I’mso sorry,” she whispered.She’d been delighted that Bardolph had found a mate so that he wouldn’t bealone, and that they were going to have pups. But now someone had unexpectedlyput an end to it.It was shocking that the wolf had been shot and killed, but what was even morealarming was that someone with a gun had been on her property and close up byher house.Angela stood with her own gun in hand and looked around, searching the shadows,feeling unexpectedly vulnerable. She didn’t see anyone, but that didn’t meanthey couldn’t still be there. She felt violated that someone had invaded herprivate sanctuary.She went back inside and retrieved a flashlight. She inspected the backyard butdidn’t see any signs of who had been there. Since there was grass, rock, moss,and small brush, she wouldn’t necessarily expect there to be footprints, so shewasn’t all that surprised when she found none.She next walked down the drive, searching from side to side for tracks of anykind. Here and there, in the gravel, was a random footprint or two where theintruder had stepped off the grass onto the side of the road in order to avoidbrush. The gravel was too dry and loose for clear footprints, but she could tellby the different sizes of the prints that they were from two different people.Out at the road, on the other side of her barbed-wire fence and the cable acrossthe drive, she found tire marks where a vehicle had pulled off the road andparked. It looked to be a relatively small car. Stretching up and looking inboth directions, Angela didn’t see any sign of it.When she spotted something in the beam of her flashlight, she squatted down andfound the stub of an unfiltered cigarette. It was just beside the tire trackswhere the car had pulled off the road and stopped. The cigarette was on thepassenger side. There was a footprint that made it clear the passenger hadgotten out and snubbed out the cigarette with a shoe.With nothing to be found other than the crushed cigarette and no one around,Angela finally made her way back up the road to the house. The tracks seemed toindicate they had deliberately pulled off the road and parked at the bottom ofher drive. When they had walked up the drive and gone around the back of thehouse, the wolf had probably come out of the woods, possibly viewing the personas prey or a threat, and had been shot.It was puzzling that the house hadn’t been touched. She wondered if they hadbeen spooked by the wolf and left, fearing that someone might have heard thegunshot.With a heavy heart, Angela retrieved a shovel and went about digging a hole nearthe woods. It was hard going through roots. She had to pry out rocks and tossthem aside, but she was animated by her anger over the wolf having been killed,as well as the vulnerable feeling of someone having been right there around herhouse. At least they hadn’t broken in.When the hole was deep enough, she grabbed the two hind legs and dragged thedead animal into the hole. With the back of her hand, she wiped tears from hercheek, and then she started shoveling the dirt into the grave.Bardolph watched from the shadows among the trees. He howled once. When she hadfinished shoveling in all the dirt, she knelt down and used her hands to pat thedirt down.As she did, Bardolph came close and slowly walked past her, brushing his sideagainst her before sniffing the grave. He seemed to understand that his mate wasgone.He moved to the other side of the grave, lay down, and rested his head on top ofthe fresh dirt, as if he intended to hold vigil. Together they grieved for thedead wolf, and all that could have been."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12Wanda had been waiting in the parking lot not far from Ricky’s house for anhour. She was annoyed that he still hadn’t called. She had spent the last twoweeks on the phone, reminding him how terrible it would be for him if his wifedivorced him and how it was only a matter of time, now that she’d been told hewas cheating. He would lose his house. He would have to pay a good chunk of hisincome to her for alimony. It could jeopardize his business. She would be aleech, sucking him dry, for the rest of his life.Wanda had hammered home how a divorce would ruin his life, and how in turn itwould ruin their lives together. To keep that from happening, they simply neededto get rid of her.Wanda had kept Ricky at arm’s length while stoking the furnace of his fears.Wanda had wanted him aching for her until he finally saw that her way was theonly way.But he was an hour late in calling her. If he chickened out on her now she wasgoing to be a lot more than simply angry with him. She had invested too muchtime in this for him to have second thoughts.At last the phone rang. It was Ricky.“Well?”“She’s finally asleep,” he said, sounding frazzled. “It took a lot longer thanwe thought it would. She wanted to stay up and watch TV. So I made her anotherdrink. I dissolved a couple more Valium in it. It took a while, but she’sfinally out.”“Good. I’ll be there in five minutes.”Wanda was excited to get it over and done with. She had to force herself todrive the speed limit through the nice part of town. The last thing she neededwas to get pulled over by the police.She yearned to live in such a nice area. Her parents’ house was a dump in adumpy part of town. Her father had a low-paying job cleaning vehicles at atrucking company. If that wasn’t bad enough, he gave a portion of his income tothe church. He always said that it was God’s house that mattered, not theirs.After a lifetime of putting up with her parents’ fanaticism and living in arun-down, dangerous part of town, and now living by the week in the wretchedRiley Motel, Wanda deserved better. Now, it was finally within reach.As she came around the corner, past some beautiful maple trees, she saw that thegarage door was open. She’d driven past his house a number of times before. Itwas the kind of house she’d dreamed of since she was a girl. A real pretty housewith shutters. A real pretty house with a nice yard. A real pretty house with agood-looking husband to take care of her.Ricky was walking back and forth inside the garage, waiting, looking nervous ashell. She smiled as she parked off to the side, out of the way so he would beable to get his big Suburban out of the garage. Given how he was pacing, shethought that maybe she should have told him to take one of the Valium himself.“Do you have it?” she asked as she met him in the garage.He held up a big, heavy-duty, milky-white nylon cable tie as he pushed thebutton to lower the garage door. “What if she wakes up?”“There’s two of us and one of her. What’s she gonna do? She’s too drugged to beable to put up much of a fight.” Wanda smiled. “She’ll probably sleep throughthe whole thing.”Ricky paced anxiously. “Maybe we should just have used the pills. You know,given her enough of an overdose to stop her breathing. Made it look likesuicide.”“Did you have an easy time getting half a dozen Valium into her?”“Hell no. Why do you think it took so long?”“Then how would you have gotten her to swallow half a bottle of them?”He made a face. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”“You know I’m right. We’ve talked about this, Ricky.”She swept an arm around his neck and pulled him down to give him a passionatekiss. That did the trick. He put his arms around her and pulled her close toreturn the kiss.“It’s been too long,” he said, his voice thick with desire.“Well, when we get done with this business we can go to bed. Together. In ourhouse.”“At last,” he said, smiling. “I can’t tell you how much of a relief it was tohave her asleep after our big fight.”“What big fight?”“She was yelling and screaming, still pissed over finding out about us. She saidshe was going to divorce my ass and have everything. I told her that she waswrong, that there was nothing serious going on, and whoever told her I wascheating on her didn’t know what they were talking about.”Wanda wasn’t listening very intently. As she looked around the garage she wassmiling over what was to come. Her parents’ house wasn’t big enough to have agarage, much less a garage with room for cabinets and a workbench.“I presume she didn’t believe you.”“Hell no,” he said. “It made her even more angry that I was denying it. She saidthen that she knew it was true because the old guy told her that he had seen usbutt-naked in the back of my Suburban parked behind the bar.”Wanda frowned as she turned back. “What are you talking about? What old guy?”Ricky threw up his hands in exasperation. “She said she was suspicious of why Ispent so much time at that bar, so she went there to see if she could catch mewith someone, but before she went in she met this old guy in the parking lot, aguy on a pink bicycle. She asked him if he knew the man who had the big muddySuburban. He said that for fifty dollars he’d tell what he knew. She gave himthe cash and he told her, then, that he’d seen me together a lot with a womannamed Wanda who works there in the bar. He told her that after the bar closedone night he saw us going at it in the back of my truck.”Wanda stood staring in shock.“She said she went into the bar the next morning when I was at work and told theowner she was a friend of Wanda’s and wanted to know where she lived so shecould drop off some things she had borrowed. I guess Barry told her where youwere living with your parents at the time.”That conniving bitch had made Wanda believe it was Angela who had told her, andall along it had been that bum, Albert. Wanda had gone to Angela’s house to geteven for the betrayal, intent on spray-painting some names on her door, and thenmaybe shooting the place up. It had been dark out in the countryside and theycould hardly see.Before she could do what she had intended, Angela’s dog suddenly appeared out ofthe darkness, snarling viciously at her. She instinctively pointed the gun andpulled the trigger. She hadn’t expected the force of the kickback from Brad’s.357. It nearly knocked her on her ass. The sound had nearly deafened her.After recovering from the shock of the recoil and noise, she had seen in themoonlight that Angela’s dog was dead. She had figured that was even betterrevenge than she had intended, so they had left.“I made a drink for her with a couple pills in it,” Ricky was saying, “and toldher that I was sorry and that I’d make it up to her. I apologized and beggedlike crazy for her forgiveness. I put on quite an act convincing her I wassincere and to have a drink with me, then another. She finally calmed down.After the drinks she was slipping into a mellow mood and wanted to watch TVbefore going to bed. She could hardly keep her eyes open as it was, but shedidn’t want to go to bed. I didn’t know what to do and I was afraid of makingher angry, so I made her another drink and put a couple more pills in it.”Wanda was hardly listening. She was outraged that it had been Albert all alongwho had blabbed everything to Ricky’s wife. Wanda wanted to strangle the littlesnitch for making her believe it was Angela who had betrayed her, when all alongit had been him. He hadn’t said a word about any of it as he directed her toAngela’s house out in the desolate mountains.“Let’s get on with it,” Wanda said, to stop Ricky from rambling on with thestory. It was clear his wife had rattled him. Wanda knew he was on the verge ofchickening out, so she turned him around and give him a little shove toward thedoor into the house.As Ricky led her through the dimly lit house, Wanda looked around with wideeyes. She’d never been in a house that nice. The carpet was plush underfoot. Thefurniture looked expensive. There was a huge TV on the wall. Ricky walked ontiptoes ahead of her, as if he might wake his wife and she would come out of thebedroom with a baseball bat.When they reached the end of the hallway, he quietly pushed open the door andstood aside to let Wanda see his wife sprawled on her back on the bed, her armssplayed out, one leg hanging off the side of the mattress. She was fully clothedin those same kind of jeans that displayed her big belly and fat ass. Wanda hada hard time understanding how a good-looking guy like Ricky ever ended up withsuch a pig.“Hurry up,” Wanda urged.Ricky looked back at her, then went in and put one knee on the bed to lean overhis wife. He pulled the heavy-duty cable tie from his pocket and slipped itaround her neck like a necklace. She moaned but didn’t open her eyes.Wanda stood beside the bed and watched him feed the end of the cable tie throughthe ratchet mechanism. He grunted as he pulled it tight.When he did, his wife started to have difficulty breathing. She opened her eyesas she urgently tried to suck in air. It made an awful sound as she struggled tobreathe in and out through the constriction.“Pull it tighter,” Wanda told him, “it’s not tight enough.”He grunted with the effort. “I’m pulling it as tight as I can. My fingers keepsliding off. I can’t get a good grip.”“I’ll be right back,” Wanda said.“She’s trying to get up!”Wanda rolled her eyes at having to explain everything to him. “Put your knee onher damn chest.”While he followed her instructions, Wanda raced out of the bedroom, down thehall, and back to the garage. She snatched up a pair of pliers she had seenbefore on the workbench and ran back to the bedroom.When she got there, Ricky was trying to hold his wife down on the bed with aknee. She was clawing at him as she made a horrible sucking sound trying tobreathe.“Here,” Wanda told him, “use these to pull it tight.”Ricky grabbed the tail of the cable tie with the pliers and, while pressing theheel of his hand against the catch at the side of her throat, pulled morethrough. It made a ratcheting sound as he pulled it tighter, locking it downever harder. It bunched up her skin as it dug deep into her fleshy neck. Hiswife reached up, trying to get one hand around his throat as she clawed at thenylon cable tie around her neck with the other.“Tighter!” Wanda yelled.He gritted his teeth with the effort of yanking it tighter. It clicked a fewtimes with each hard pull.No longer able to get any air, the woman opened her eyes wide in terror thatovercame the booze and drugs. She was now wide awake and in mortal fear.Wanda leaned in over her. “Remember when you said you were going to strangle thelife out of me, bitch? Well, I guess you’re the one having the life strangledout of her.”As she stared wide-eyed at Wanda, Wanda spit in her face.Her arms flailed weakly. As her face began to turn blue, her arms slowed down,and after a last swipe at her husband, they flopped down on the bed.Standing close together, Ricky and Wanda watched as his wife’s body convulsed afew times before it finally went still. Her lips were a blackish blue. Herbulging eyes remained open, but they no longer saw anything.Wanda felt a giddy wave of satisfaction at getting back at the woman for thescene she’d made in front of Wanda’s parents. Wanda smiled wider when she sawthat the woman had pissed her pants.It had been such an exhilarating experience that she was a bit sad it was over.Together they checked her pockets to make sure she didn’t have anyidentification on her; then they rolled the dead woman up in a blanket and tiedrope around it. It wasn’t easy, but they managed to lug her dead weight out tothe garage. Ricky opened the back of the truck and they hoisted her in.“See? Easy,” Wanda said. “No blood, no evidence.”They went back to the bedroom and stuffed a bunch of the dead woman’s clothesand shoes into black plastic garbage bags. Before putting the purse in one ofthe bags, they took out the keys and all the identification along with a fewreceipts. They would burn the bags of clothes, but to be on the safe side theywanted to destroy the identification separately in order to be certain thatnothing was left. Wanda put the house key in her own pocket.Ricky’s wife didn’t have any relatives in Milford Falls. All of her family livedin California. There would be no one to report her missing. If anyone evercalled to inquire about her, Ricky’s story would be that their marriage had beenfalling apart for some time and after a big argument, she’d packed most of herthings and left him. He would say that he didn’t know where she had gone butassumed back to California.Once they had loaded everything into the Suburban, they were finally on theirway. As they drove through town, Wanda took the SIM card out of the dead woman’sphone, folded it back and forth until it broke apart, then tossed the pieces outthe window one at a time. She twisted the phone until it broke and threw it inthe river as they crossed a bridge.Ricky worked in the forests that surrounded Milford Falls, so he knew all theback roads and remote areas. It was late, so there was little traffic. Once theymade their way out of town they didn’t see any cars. They drove for nearly anhour down increasingly narrow roads, ending up on a dirt road across privateproperty where he had recently cut trees.He finally stopped in a place with a steep drop-off down into a ravine. The roadon the large private property had only been used by his logging crew, so no onewould come this far out.They pulled the dead woman out of the truck and pushed her over the edge. Rickywatched with a flashlight to make sure she went far down the rocky hillside intoan inaccessible spot. Leaves and forest debris that the body disturbed tumbleddown to cover the corpse.Once they had disposed of the body, they drove back to the yard of Ricky’sbusiness. It was located in a remote area just out of town so it would be closerto the woods where they worked. The parked log trucks and other equipment madethe place look ghostly in the moonlight.Ricky poured some gasoline in two of the big burn barrels where they sometimesburned brush, then pulled clothes out of the bags and tossed them in one at atime so they would burn better. He occasionally tossed in some branches to helpkeep a fire going so it would burn everything completely. They stood together,his arm around her, as they watched the fires burn. Every once in a while, hewould add more clothes and fuel to make sure everything was reduced to ashes.Wanda couldn’t wait to get home to her new house."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13The first night in her new home was exciting. The sex was fantastic, althoughRicky seemed distracted. Once she made sure he was well satisfied and had fallenasleep, she explored her new home, marveling at the size of the rooms, thecolor-coordinated decorating, the quality of the fabrics on couch and chairs,and the beautiful chandelier on a dimmer switch in the dining room. Sheinspected the knickknacks and looked in closets. She ate leftover chicken shefound in the refrigerator as she inspected the dishes in the cabinets and thesilverware in the drawers.Things were finally working out.A couple of days later, Ricky sold his wife’s car to some sleazy charactersWanda knew who dealt in stolen automobiles. Since it was a nearly new, commonmodel, they were eager to have it. The price was dirt cheap on the conditionthat it never be found. They said they parted out the cars they hooked, so therewas no worry of that. Wanda used some of the money to buy herself some new shoesshe’d had her eye on.It took some time, talking to people she knew who frequented bars, but Wandafinally found out where Albert lived. She was deeply angry that he had toldRicky’s wife about them, leading to the scene at Wanda’s parents’ house, butworse, he had caused Wanda to believe that it had been Angela who had snitched.All that time she had spent with Albert, driving around on godforsaken roadsthrough the woods until they found Angela’s place, he had never once mentionedthat he’d told Ricky’s wife about her.Because he’d kept that from her, she had mistakenly blamed Angela for betrayingher, and as a result she had shot Angela’s dog when it surprised her. She wasangry at Albert about that. It turned out that Angela had had nothing to do withtelling Ricky’s wife about Wanda. It had been Albert’s doing all along. Angelahad been the one person Wanda had trusted, the one person she really caredabout, and Wanda had shot her dog.It had all been Albert’s fault.She had quit her job specifically because she had been so hurt, believing Angelahad betrayed her, that she didn’t want to see her ever again. It turned out shehad nothing to do with it.It had all been Albert’s fault.Now that Wanda was with Ricky, she didn’t really need her job back, but shefound that she really missed Angela in her life. She’d never missed anyonebefore. But she missed seeing Angela, missed talking to her.Wanda wanted to get back in Angela’s good graces. Angela represented someindescribable core in Wanda’s life. Angela somehow made her want to do better.Angela had always been straight with her, always been honest. Angela alwaysexplained how she could get out of problems without calling her names orlecturing her the way her parents did. She just seemed to know the right thingto do when Wanda was completely bewildered as to how to get out of a jam. Angelahad been a true friend when no one else cared enough to help her. And Wanda hadshot her dog.It had all been Albert’s fault.While she could never in a million years tell Angela what she had done, she didwant to be friends with her again. She thought that maybe she could get her jobback working at the bar with Angela and that would help mend their relationship.The problem was, there was always a risk of that bastard Albert ratting on herand telling Angela that Wanda had been the one who had shot her dog. Albert hadalready betrayed her to Ricky’s wife, so he obviously couldn’t be trusted.There was only one way to make sure he didn’t talk.She was going to have to kill him.She had found out he was homeless—no surprise—and lived in a seedy part of townnot far from Barry’s Place, off in the woods in a ravine behind some smallbusinesses along a busy street. There were a number of homeless encampmentsscattered through the area.It was late in the day when she finally found Albert’s lair. Tucked underscraggly trees and in among a tangle of brush was a tent of sorts made out ofold blue plastic tarps. The roof was held up by ropes and twine strung to trees.The ground all around was littered with empty plastic bottles, food containers,and wine bottles, many of them broken. She suspected that the broken bottleswere a poor man’s barbed-wire fence. By the unmistakable, gagging smell, sheknew he used the nearby bushes as his toilet.Wanda leaned down and spotted his feet just inside the opening. He was asleep.Since he prowled at night, that made sense. She navigated her way through theburglar alarm of empty cans and bottles, through the minefield of broken glass,and stepped over his pink bicycle. Quiet as a mouse, she ducked down and wentinside.He was snoring in a deep sleep. Seeing used needles and empty booze bottleslying all over the dirt floor of his “home,” she knew why he was sleeping sosoundly. She relaxed, realizing that in a drugged state he wasn’t liable to wakeeasily or be too alert once he did. She had to smile at how easy it was to dealwith troublesome people when they were drunk or drugged.Wanda had her big .357 Magnum revolver with her, but she was reluctant to use itunless absolutely necessary. She could always shoot him and then make a quickexit. Being a revolver, it had the advantage of not leaving shell casings, theway a semiauto would. Anyone seeing a well-dressed woman walking casually downthe street wouldn’t think the shot had come from her. She would simply act assurprised and confused as everyone else as she departed the area.She saw a stained pillow off to the side and considered using that to muffle thegunshot. Not ideal, but better than nothing. That was, until she saw somethingbetter.Albert was lying on his side. Just inside the back waistband of his filthy pantsshe spotted the handle of a knife sticking up.When she yanked the knife out of the sheath, he snorted partially awake andflopped over on his back. Wanda immediately threw her leg over and straddled himto hold him down.He opened his bloodshot eyes and blinked up at her in confusion.“You little bastard,” she growled down at him.He looked left and right, then back up at her face looming over him. “What …Wanda?”“That’s right. The Wanda you lied to, the Wanda you tricked, the Wanda youdouble-crossed.”“What are you talking about?”He sounded like he was getting angry. Good.“You told Ricky’s wife about us.”He frowned. “So what?”“You led me to Angela’s house and didn’t say a thing when I told you how angry Iwas at her for betraying me. You never said a word about it being you all along.Because of you I shot her dog.”“Fuck you!”Wanda, already on a hot boil, went over the edge. She slammed the knife into theside of his neck.He grabbed her wrist as she yanked it back out, but the damage was done. He wasnot only old, but still in a fog from whatever he’d drunk or shot up.Blood pumped out of the side of his neck in thick spurts. She moved her rightleg back so it wouldn’t get on her. His eyes wide, he gasped.Wanda wrenched her wrist away from his weak grip and with both hands on thehandle put the point of the blade at the base of his throat in the hollow of hisneck. Looking into his eyes, she pounced over the knife with all of her weight,shoving the blade all the way in.As she got up, she watched the pool of blood under his head grow larger andlarger.She smiled as his eyes grew big and round, looking at her in confusion the wholetime he gasped, trying to get air, one hand over the spurting wound in the sideof his neck, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, his other hand waving wildly,trying to snatch at her. Each long pull for air made a gurgling sound as itbubbled through the blood.The question in his panicked eyes was obvious.“Why?” she asked for him. “Because you made me betray my only friend. You mademe betray Angela, the only person in my life who ever treated me decent. Theonly one. That’s why.”He couldn’t answer with the knife blade jammed down through his windpipe. He wastoo weak to pull the knife out and he couldn’t stop the blood pumping out of himinto the dirt floor of his pathetic hovel.“You wasted your life, old man. If you really are Angela’s father, you missedout on a lifetime of knowing her. You missed out on knowing how smart and goodshe is. You missed out on her beautiful smile. You missed out on loving her.”She didn’t know if her words registered in his dying brain. She hoped so.Wanda’s parents missed out on loving her, too. All they ever did was tell herhow evil she was, make her pray for hours, and beat her for allowing the devilinto her heart. They missed out on having her love them as she grew up. Justlike this pathetic old man had, they took advantage of her, too.He worshiped drugs and booze. If he really was Angela’s father, he should haveworshiped her. Just like Wanda’s parents, he missed out on life.Wanda’s chest heaved with the excitement of watching him bleed out, with thesatisfaction of getting even with someone who had done her wrong.The thought occurred to her that he wasn’t the only one."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14Wanda felt good after leaving Albert dead in his dump. In fact, she felt morethan good, she felt invigorated. She had killed a man who had caused her a lotof trouble, a man who needed to be dead. Killed him with her own hands. She felta deep sense of satisfaction at having rid herself of a problem.When someone finally found his body and reported it to the police, they wouldnaturally assume that he had been killed and robbed by another homeless wino.Happened all the time. No one would ever have a reason to suspect Wanda of thekilling.With the problem of Albert out of the way, she was looking forward to havingdinner with Ricky once he finished work for the day. She idly contemplated whatshe could fix him for dinner, what he would like, what would make him happy. Shewanted him to be happy with her.As she drove through town she thought about how easy it had been to kill bothtroublesome people—Ricky’s wife and Albert. Not only had it been easy, it hadbeen deeply satisfying.Wanda found herself absently driving home. Not home to her new home with Ricky,but home to where she’d grown up. She was disgusted by the neighborhood as shedrove past her parents’ house. Junk lay in yards. Why did people leave junk intheir yards? The little house where she had grown up looked even smaller thanshe remembered.There were people out sitting on porches and hanging out on the street, so shedrove past and parked in an alley a block away. There were other cars parked inthe alley. No one would think anything of her faded, old hatchback. It fit rightin.She was going to have to tell Ricky to get her a new car.Wanda grabbed her big handbag off the passenger seat as she got out of the car.It was a short walk out of the alley where she’d parked and into the next one.Her parents’ house was near the middle of the block. Tall, weathered woodenfences surrounded most of the places. At other yards, chain-link fences keptbarking dogs in.The weedy dirt backyard at her parents’ house was surrounded by a dilapidatedwooden fence. Her parents didn’t have a dog, so she didn’t know why they didn’tkeep their yard up. They said dogs were a distraction from the Lord’s path.Lawns probably were as well.Angela fished her keys out of her handbag. She knew her father had changed thelocks on the front door. She smiled to discover he had been too cheap to changethem on the back door.She was in kind of a daze as she walked into the familiar, haunted house of herchildhood nightmares. She stood in the kitchen for a time, taking it in, lettingher rage build.Her father was due home any moment, so she knew her mother would be in theliving room waiting so they could say their evening prayers before dinner. Wandastood by the back door, waiting, too, and wondering why she hadn’t thought ofthis sooner.She heard the front door and her parents’ voices. Her mother mentioned somethings they would need to get from the store. Her father complained about hispants getting torn on a truck fender. Her mother said she could sew them.After they had been silent for a time, Wanda pulled the big .357 Magnum revolverout of her purse. It was beginning to feel good in her hands. It made her theequal of those who had always tormented her. It made her better than them.She took a deep breath to settle her excitement. She wanted to soak it all in.She had gone over it in her head a thousand times. Today it was finally the day.Gun in hand, she walked into the living room. Her parents were kneeling, as sheknew they would be at this time of day, before their little shrine in the alcovewith a statue of the Virgin Mary to one side. The paint on the old plasterstatue had been worn off on the edges in some places and was chipped in others.The tip of the Virgin Mother’s nose was missing.On her way into the living room, Wanda plucked the fat throw pillow from herfather’s chair and pressed it against the barrel of the gun.“I’m home,” she announced.Startled, her father turned. “How did you get here? I told you, you are corruptand sinful and aren’t welcome in this God-fearing house anymore!”Wanda shot him in the face.Just as Brad had told her, the .357 hollow-point went in like a nickel and cameout like a sack of quarters. The back of his head exploded out all over thepicture of Jesus and the cross beside it. The Virgin Mary got new red robes.Bloody bits dripped down the wall.Her mother sprang to her feet in surprise and horror.“Wanda!”Wanda shot her in the center of the chest before she could start bitching ather.Surprisingly, her mother didn’t even take a step. She simply dropped straightdown into a heap, her arms and legs at loony angles.Wanda looked to make sure she was dead and then tossed the pillow back on herfather’s chair. It had worked fairly well at muffling the sound.She was a bit surprised at how easy it had all been. A lifetime of wishing theywere dead, and now, here they were, dead. She remembered his interminablelectures of “you reap what you sow.” How true. She wondered why she hadn’t doneit sooner and saved herself a lot of grief.Wanda took her father’s wallet out of his pocket and removed all the cash. Therewasn’t enough money to be of any real consequence, but she wanted the police tothink it was a home invasion and robbery. In this neighborhood it wouldn’t besurprising. She tossed the wallet aside. She removed her mother’s wedding ringto add to the robbery theme. She would throw it in a dumpster later.After making it look like the living room had been tossed looking for valuables,she went upstairs to their bedroom and opened all the dresser drawers, pullingout clothes as she went to make it look like the bad guy had ransacked theplace. Since the police wouldn’t know what valuables her parents had, theywouldn’t have any idea what might have been stolen.After she finished methodically staging the home invasion, murder, and robbery,she left out the back door. The police would think the bad guy had gotten inthrough the unlocked door.The dogs in the fenced yards were still barking. They barked as they followedher along inside their fences as she walked back to her car. She knew most ofthese dogs. They barked virtually nonstop and were always ignored by theirowners.No one seemed to have paid any attention to the gunshots, either. In thisneighborhood gunfire wasn’t all that uncommon. Since no one came out of theirhouses to look, Wanda guessed that being inside the house and using a pillowmust have muffled the shots enough that no one took note.Back in her car, she drove calmly away, exhilarated and overwhelmed with a senseof satisfaction.She couldn’t believe how easy it was to kill people and get away with it if youknew what you were doing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15Wanda’s parents didn’t have any life insurance, and they didn’t have bankaccounts. Her father didn’t believe in banks, so he kept what little cash he hadin a tin box on the top shelf in the bedroom closet. Wanda had taken the cashand left the box on the floor with half the clothes in the closet. It amountedto a few hundred dollars. He always felt guilty for keeping some money forhimself and not giving it to the church. No doubt he prayed for forgiveness, sohe could be absolved of guilt and still have the money. He had always prayedafter beating her, too, probably to be absolved of that as well.It was several days before the bodies were discovered. The police called Wandaand asked her to come in. She cried and gasped in shock over the murders thewhole time they asked questions. The police asked if she knew of anyone whocould have had a beef with her parents. She told them that everyone loved herGod-fearing parents. After exhausting their list of questions, the policethanked her for coming down and said they were sorry for her loss. Idiots.Wanda didn’t tell Ricky what had really happened. What would be the point? Theless he knew, the better. All he knew was what she had told him about how badlythey had treated her growing up and how her father had beaten her, so hewouldn’t need to pretend he was sad.Her parents had owed more on their house than it was worth, so the bank wasgoing to take it. That was fine with Wanda. She didn’t ever want to see theplace again.Since her parents had no life insurance, Ricky paid for the funeral. Wandacontributed most of the cash she had taken from their house. She said it was hersavings from tips at the bar. He said it wasn’t necessary, but she said they hadbeen her parents and she wouldn’t have it any other way. He nodded hisunderstanding.The service at the church went on forever, with a long sermon and then prayersfor their souls. The funeral itself was simple, but nice. Her mother’s casketwas open, her father’s closed. Their friends from church came and cried andprayed their little hearts out. They all told Wanda how sorry they were. Shedabbed her eyes and thanked them.The graveside service was mercifully short.She was relieved when it was all over.Life with Ricky gradually settled down to a routine. While he was busy at workearning money, she kept the house tidy and cooked dinner for him. The beautifulhouse came to feel homey. She was happy there.But there was one thing still nagging at her, the same thing that had beenbothering her for quite some time, the thing she couldn’t get over.She missed Angela in her life.The more time that went by, the more important she realized Angela had been toher.Even though she had Ricky and a wonderful house, she still felt empty inside.Life seemed flat. Angela was somehow bigger than life. Wanda missed Angela andwanted to be friends with her again, so she decided she would see if she couldget back her old job at the bar.It felt good driving into the parking lot at Barry’s Place again. The good partof her old job was that people in the bar liked her. She’d had a lot of funthere. It had been where she’d met Ricky.Being a weeknight it wasn’t busy, so she was pretty sure she would have a chanceto talk to Barry and ask for her job back, but first she really wanted to seeAngela.Wanda was relieved to see that Angela’s primer-gray pickup was in the parkinglot. Barry would be there as well. Barry was always there. Wanda planned onbeing giggly and coy when she asked Barry for forgiveness and her old job back.He was a softhearted guy, so she was pretty sure she could talk him into it.That way she would be working with Angela again. That way they would justnaturally get back to being friends and spending time together at the bar.It was a dream come true living with Ricky in such a nice house, but it would bethe cherry on top to get back in Angela’s good graces again. Wanda would make itup to her somehow. Maybe she could get Angela a puppy. She would be the bestfriend Angela had ever had.Inside the bar, men recognized her and shouted their greetings. Wanda grinnedand winked on her way past. It felt good. She didn’t see Barry, but Angela wasbehind the bar.Wanda walked up to the bar and hopped up on a stool right in front of Angela.She slung her big handbag up onto the next stool and then folded her arms on thebar as she leaned in.When Wanda looked up into Angela’s eyes, the world stopped.Wanda’s mouth went dry. Her fingers tingled. She felt hot and faint.She sat paralyzed at the look on Angela’s face, but mostly at the look in hereyes.She knew.It was crystal clear in her eyes. Angela knew. There wasn’t a shred of doubt inWanda’s mind that Angela knew everything. Wanda didn’t know how she knew, butshe knew it all.Wanda snatched up her handbag and ran out of the bar."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16Angela’s phone rang as she walked out into the dimly lit parking lot. The callwas from Wanda. She had known it would be. Angela could see her car across theparking lot, Wanda sitting in it, phone in hand.She answered the call but didn’t say anything.“Angela?” Wanda asked after a moment of silence. “Angela? Are you there?”Angela stopped where she was as she watched Wanda across the parking lot. “I’mhere.”“Angela … I’m so sorry.”“What are you sorry for, Wanda?”“I’m sorry that I shot your dog,” she said in a tearful voice.It took Angela a fraction of a second to realize what Wanda was talking about.When she had found the cigarette butt, Angela had suspected Albert. For somereason she had also suspected Wanda, because it had just seemed like somehowcrazy Wanda would be involved. But it still surprised and saddened her to hearthe confession.“Why would you have done that, Wanda?”Wanda was choking in tears, now. “It’s a long story, but I thought you had toldRicky’s wife about him and me.”“I didn’t approve of what you were doing, and told you so, but I’m not asnitch.”“I know.” Angela could see her nodding in her car. “I know. I was so stupid.”“You were stupid about a lot of things, Wanda.”“What do you mean?”“They found the body of Ricky’s wife today. The property owner noticed where avehicle had stopped. He saw footprints. It made him curious, so he investigatedand found the body.”Wanda was silent.“You really blew it this time, Wanda.”“What do you mean?”“The police arrested Ricky this afternoon. Now they’re looking for you.”“You mean Ricky killed his wife?”“Oh please, don’t try to bullshit me, Wanda. I know what you did.”“You couldn’t possibly know.”“I told you I was born a freak, remember?”“Yes, but I don’t know what that means.”“My mother used drugs. Lots of drugs. Because of that I was born broken. I don’tfeel things like normal people. But it also left me with the freaky ability torecognize killers just by looking in their eyes. And when I look into theireyes, I see more than their guilt. I see everything they’ve done. Everything. Isee everything about those sins written on their soul.“When I looked into your eyes a few minutes ago, I saw everything. I think yourealized that, didn’t you? That’s why you ran out.”“But the police won’t be able to—”“The police aren’t stupid. The forensics lab will look at the nylon cable tiefrom around her throat. They will find tool marks on the end of that nylon tie.They will go looking for the tool that left those marks.“They will find a pair of pliers on the workbench in Ricky’s garage.”“How could you possibly … ?”“The forensics lab will match the tool marks on those pliers to the marks on thecable tie from around the neck of Ricky’s dead wife.”“So Ricky—”“I told you, cut the BS. I already saw in your eyes that you ran and got thosepliers because Ricky couldn’t pull the cable tie tight enough around his wife’sneck. The police will find your fingerprints on those pliers. They will inspectthe rope you and Ricky wrapped around the body. The forensics lab will find somedark hairs tangled in that rope. DNA analysis will show those hairs to be fromyou.”“But my fingerprints on the pliers don’t mean—”“Your fingerprints are also on the knife you shoved through Albert’s throat.”That gave her pause.“Did you ever think to wipe off your fingerprints? Did that ever occur to you,Wanda? Didn’t you think the police would check the murder weapon for prints?”She stammered for a moment, trying to find her voice. “I … I thought they wouldassume it was another homeless drunk who killed him and robbed him. They weresupposed to think it was another drunk.”Wanda sounded desperate, wanting it to be so. In a way, Angela felt sorry forher. She was a killer, and deserved to die, but Angela felt a little sad for howWanda wasn’t able to think things through and simply thought she could get awaywith things because she wanted to. But then, killers always thought they wouldget away with it. They never considered consequences. They never realized howsmart the authorities were.“Then you went to your parents’ house,” Angela said, “and you murdered them. Youused a throw pillow from your father’s chair to muffle the shots. The bulletswill match the gun you stole from Brad. The gun you have in your big handbag.”“My parents were monsters!”“Maybe so,” Angela said, “but they never murdered anyone.”The cold logic of that left Wanda speechless. It often had in the past whenAngela pointed out what should be obvious.Wanda’s car was parked near the streetlight. Angela could see her lean over andpull the revolver out of her handbag.When she did, Angela switched her phone to her other hand and pulled her own gunout of the holster inside the waistband at the small of her back. Gun in hand,she started walking slowly, deliberately, toward Wanda’s car.“What’s going to happen to me?” Wanda asked through tears.“The police aren’t stupid. You left evidence everywhere, Wanda. They’ve alreadyarrested Ricky. Ricky never had much of a spine. He just did what you told himto do. He’s going to start singing. Today, tomorrow, the next day, he will breakdown and confess everything. He will want to minimize his role, so he will sayit was all your doing. To bolster his story, he will tell them how you spit inhis wife’s face while she was dying.“The forensics lab will match DNA they find on her face to you. The police aregoing to find your fingerprints on the pliers just like they are going to findyour prints on the knife you put through Albert’s throat, just like they aregoing to find your fingerprints on your father’s wallet that you tossed asideafter you took out the cash.”Wanda hung her head as she cried silently for a moment.“I made Albert suffer for what he did,” she finally said. “For what he did toyou. If Albert really was your father, he should have loved you like I do.”“You have a crazy way of showing love, Wanda.”“Not crazy to me.”“That’s the problem,” Angela said softly into her phone.“Angela … what’s going to happen to me?”Angela didn’t ever allow killers to get away with killing. It was her strangecalling. It was what she lived for. It was her only reason for living. It washer purpose.Although what she did with killers was justice, the police wouldn’t see it thatway, so she didn’t ever want to be caught. For that reason, she never leftbodies where they could be found.In this case, though, Wanda had a gun in her hand, a gun she had used to murderher parents. Whether or not she pointed it at Angela didn’t matter. It would beseen as self-defense, so this time there was no need to worry about the body.Wanda’s car was sitting at a slight angle. The window would deflect a small .22round in an unpredictable way. Angela needed Wanda to roll down the window soshe would have that clean shot. Then it would be over in an instant. Wandawouldn’t know what hit her. She would simply cease to exist.Angela kept the gun hidden behind her thigh as she held the phone up to her earwith her other hand.“Angela,” Wanda cried over the phone, “I’m so scared. What’s going to happen tome?”“The truth? If you surrender, or run and are captured, you will be arrested,tried, and convicted of four murders. If they don’t give you a death sentence,you will spend the rest of your life in a living hell, never to be free again.“The thing is, Wanda, one way or another, you are going to pay for your sins.Sooner or later, one way or another, everyone pays for their sins.”As Angela got closer, she could finally see Wanda’s eyes as she wept. “CrazyWanda,” she murmured to herself. Wanda always acted first and thought later.“Come on, Wanda,” Angela whispered, “roll down your window. It will all be overbefore you know what happened.”Wanda just sat there, gun in hand, phone to her ear.“Angela …”Angela stopped not far from the car.“What?”“Angela, I finally understand what that tattoo on your throat means. You saidone time to pray that I never had reason to know what it meant. But now I know.You really are a dark angel. A dark angel sent for me.”As Angela watched, Wanda put gun the barrel in her mouth.A sudden sound, like a sledgehammer wrapped with a T-shirt striking an anvil,rang through the still darkness.The inside of the car windows instantly misted with red.Angela stood staring for a moment, then slipped her gun back in the holsterunder her top at the small of her back.This was one body of a killer she had no desire to see.She turned and walked back to the bar. Her part in this was over. Wanda was nomore.Someone else would discover the body and call 911.Angela didn’t ever get involved with the authorities if she could avoid it. Withthis, she could avoid it. Soon, someone else would call them.She didn’t know if she would ever see Bardolph again, but if she did, she wouldtell him that his mate’s killer was dead. Somehow, she thought he wouldunderstand."},{"pageContent":"Read more about Angela Constantine in the major novelTHE GIRL IN THE MOONand in the novellaTROUBLE’S CHILD"},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsTitle Page [index_split_000.html#filepos175]Copyright Page [index_split_001.html#filepos548]CONTENTS [index_split_002.html#filepos667]CHAPTER ONE [index_split_003.html#filepos1848]CHAPTER 2 [index_split_004.html#filepos11833]CHAPTER 3 [index_split_005.html#filepos20092]CHAPTER 4 [index_split_006.html#filepos30525]CHAPTER 5 [index_split_007.html#filepos48741]CHAPTER 6 [index_split_008.html#filepos58319]CHAPTER 7 [index_split_009.html#filepos62437]CHAPTER 8 [index_split_010.html#filepos71196]CHAPTER 9 [index_split_011.html#filepos79554]CHAPTER 10 [index_split_012.html#filepos88332]CHAPTER 11 [index_split_013.html#filepos96563]CHAPTER 12 [index_split_014.html#filepos104036]CHAPTER 13 [index_split_015.html#filepos122850]CHAPTER 14 [index_split_016.html#filepos134419]CHAPTER 15 [index_split_017.html#filepos143095]CHAPTER 16 [index_split_018.html#filepos149373]"}]
