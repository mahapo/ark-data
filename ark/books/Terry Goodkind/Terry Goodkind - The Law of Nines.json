The white skull and crossbones seemed to be straining to keep frombeing blown off the flapping black flag as the flatbed truck, apparently tryingto beat the light, cannonballed through the intersection. The truck heeled overas it cut an arc around the corner. White PVC pipe rolled across the diamondplate of the truck bed, sounding like the sharp rattle of bones. At the speed itwas traveling the truck looked to be in danger of capsizing.Alex glanced to the only other person waiting at the curb with him. With hismind adrift in distracted thoughts he hadn’t before noticed the lone womanstanding just in front of him and to the right. He didn’t even remember seeingwhere she’d come from. He thought that he saw just a hint of vapor rising fromthe sides of her arms into the chill air.Since he wasn’t able to see the woman’s face, Alex didn’t know if she saw thetruck bearing down on them, but he found it difficult to believe that shewouldn’t at least hear the diesel engine roaring at full throttle.Seeing by the truck’s trajectory that it wasn’t going to make the corner, Alexsnatched the woman’s upper arm and yanked her back with him.Tires screeched as the great white truck bounced up over the curb right whereAlex and the woman had been standing. The front bumper swept past, missing themby inches. Rusty dust billowed out behind the truck. Chunks of sod and dirt flewby.Had Alex hesitated they both would have been dead.On the white door just above the name “Jolly Roger Plumbing” was a picture of ajovial pirate with a jaunty black patch over one eye and a sparkle painted inthe corner of his smile. Alex glared back as the pirate sailed past.When he looked up to see what kind of maniac was driving he instead met thedirect, dark glare of a burly passenger. The man’s curly beard and thick mat ofdark hair made him look like he really could have been a pirate. His eyes,peering out of narrow slits above plump, pockmarked cheeks, were filled with akind of vulgar rage.The big man appeared infuriated that Alex and the woman would dare to be in theway of their off-road excursion. As the door popped open there was no doubt asto his combative intent.He looked like a man stepping out of a nightmare.Alex felt a cold wave of adrenaline flood through him as he mentallychoreographed his moves. The passenger, who seemed to be getting ready to leapout of the still-moving truck, would reach him before the driver could join in,making it one against one—at least for a brief time. Alex couldn’t believe thatit was happening, but it was and he knew that he was going to have to deal withit.Calm fury filled him as he prepared himself for the unavoidable.Everything slowed until each beat of his heart seemed to take an eternity. Hewatched the muscles in the man’s arm bulge as he held the door open. Inresponse, Alex’s own muscles tightened, ready to meet the threat. His mind wascocooned in silence.Just as the passenger’s stout leg swung out the open door, flashing lights andthe sudden wail of a siren made the burly man turn his attention away. A policecar, tires squealing, launched across the intersection in a way that suggestedthe cops were angered by the truck’s stunt. The police car had been parkedbeside a hedge to the side of the drive into the parking lot across the street.As they had sped past, the men in the truck apparently hadn’t seen the parkedpolice car watching traffic. Lost in his own thoughts, Alex hadn’t, either.The loudspeaker crackled to life. “Pull it over!”The world seemed to rush back in.The white plumbing truck, trailing a fog of dust, slowed as it rolled off thecurb up ahead, the black-and-white police car right behind it. As the truckstopped, two policemen leaped out, hands resting at the ready on their guns asthey approached from both sides of the truck at the same time. They yelledorders and both men carefully emerged with their hands up. In an instant theofficers had them out and leaning on the front fenders of the truck.Alex felt the tension drain out of his muscles, leaving his knees feeling weak.As he turned his glare from the men being frisked, he found the woman’s gazefixed on him. Her eyes were the luscious color of his finest sable artistbrushes. It was clearly evident to him that behind those sensuous brown eyes sheappraised the world around her with an incisive intellect.She glanced deliberately down at his big hand still tightly gripping her upperarm. He had intended to toss her back out of harm’s way so that the passengercouldn’t hurt her, but the police had shown up first.She looked up at him in silent command.“Sorry,” he said, releasing her arm. “You were about to be run down by pirates.”She said nothing.He had meant his comment to be lighthearted, to ease the fright of what hadnearly happened, but by her calm expression she didn’t appear to be the leastbit amused. He hoped he hadn’t hurt her arm. He knew that sometimes he didn’trealize his own strength.Not knowing what to do with his hands, Alex combed his fingers back through histhick hair as he stuffed his other hand in a pocket.He cleared his throat, changed his tone to be more serious, and started over.“I’m sorry if I hurt your arm, but that truck would have hit you if I hadn’tpulled you back out of the way.”“It matters to you?”Her voice was as captivating as her eyes.“Yes,” he said, a little puzzled. “I wouldn’t like to see anyone get hurt in anaccident like that.”“Perhaps it wasn’t an accident.”Her expression was unreadable. He could only wonder at her meaning. He was at aloss as to how to respond.The memory of the way she’d been standing at the curb still hung in the shadowsin the back of his mind. Even lost in distant, dejected thoughts at the time, hehad noticed that her body language hadn’t been quite right. Because he was anartist, a person’s balance, either at rest or in motion, stood out to him. Therehad been something out of the ordinary about the way she had been standing.Alex wasn’t sure if, by her answer, she was simply trying to do the same as hehad been doing—trying to lighten the heart-pounding scare of what had nearlyhappened—or if she was dismissing his chivalry as a presumptuous line. Heimagined that a woman as attractive as she was had to deal with men constantlytrying clever lines in order to meet her.The satiny black dress that hugged her curves looked to be either high fashionor oddly out of time and place—he couldn’t quite decide which—as did the long,deep green wrap draped over her shoulders. Her luxuriant fall of soft,summer-blond hair could have gone either way as well.Alex figured that she had to be on her way to the exclusive jewelry store thatwas the anchor of the upscale Regent Center across the street. The slanted glassfaçade was just visible beyond the shade of ash and linden trees spread acrossthe broad grounds separating the upscale shops from Regent Boulevard.He glanced over at the plumbing truck sitting at the curb. The strobing lightsfrom the police car made the white truck look alternately blue and red.After getting handcuffs on the passenger, the police officer pointed at the curband told the man to sit beside the driver. The man sat and crossed his legs.Both wore dark work clothes covered with grime. While both men quietly did asthey were told, neither looked to be the least bit cowed.One of the officers started toward Alex as the other spoke into the radioclipped to his shirt at the shoulder.“Are you two all right?” the man asked as he approached, his voice stillcarrying an adrenaline edge. “They didn’t hit you, did they?”Both of the cops were young and built like weightlifters. Both had bull necks.Black, short-sleeved shirts stretched over the swell of their arms served onlyto emphasize the size of their muscles.“No,” Alex said. “We’re fine.”“Glad to hear it. That was quick thinking. For a minute I thought you two weregoing to be roadkill.”Alex gestured toward the men in handcuffs. “Are they being arrested?”With a quick glance he took in the woman, then shook his head. “No, unless theycome back with warrants. With guys like this you never know what you’ve got, sowe often cuff them for our own safety until they can be checked out. When mypartner is finished writing up that ticket, though, I don’t think they’ll be inthe mood to pull a stunt like this again for a while.”That two cops this powerfully built would be worried about the guys in the truckto the point of cuffing them made Alex not feel so bad for being spooked whenhe’d looked into the dark eyes of the passenger.He glanced at the badge and extended his hand. “Thanks for coming along when youdid, Officer Slawinski.”“Sure thing,” the man said as he shook Alex’s hand. By the force applied to thegrip Alex figured that the man was still keyed up. Officer Slawinski turnedaway, then, eager to get back to the pirates.The driver, still sitting on the curb, was thinner but just as mean-looking asthe burly passenger. He sat stone-faced, giving brief answers as the officerstanding over him asked questions while writing the ticket.The two officers spoke briefly, apparently about the results of the warrantcheck, because Officer Slawinski nodded, then uncuffed the passenger and toldhim to get back in the truck. After climbing back in, the passenger rested ahairy arm out the side window as the other cop started uncuffing the driver.In the truck’s big, square side mirror, Alex saw the man’s dark eyes glaringright at him. They were the kind of eyes that seemed to be out of place in acivilized world. Alex told himself that it had to be that in such a newly built,luxurious part of town the work-worn construction vehicles, despite there beinga lot of them, all seemed to be out of place. In fact, Alex recalled having seenthe Jolly Roger Plumbing truck before.Alex’s small house, not far away, had once been at the outskirts of town among acluster of other homes built in the seclusion of wooded hills and cornfields,but they had long since been swallowed by the ever-expanding city. He now livedin a desirable area, if not exactly on a desirable street or in a desirablehouse.Alex stood frozen for a moment, staring at the grubby, bearded face watching himin the truck’s mirror.Then the man grinned at him.It was as wicked a grin as Alex had ever seen.As the black flag atop the truck lifted in a gust of wind, the skull also gaveAlex a grim grin.He noticed then that the woman, ignoring the activity, was watching him. As thelight turned green, Alex gestured.“Would you allow me to escort you safely across the street?” he asked in a toneof exaggerated gallantry.For the first time she smiled. It wasn’t a broad grin, or a smile thatthreatened to break into laughter, but rather a simple, modest curve of her lipssaying that this time she got the lighthearted nature of his words.Still, it seemed to make the world suddenly beautiful on what was otherwise arather depressing day for him."},{"pageContent":"2.I’ D LOVE TO PAINT YOU SOMETIME—if you’d be interested, I mean,” Alex said asthey made their way across the broad boulevard. “Paint me?” she asked, her browtwitching just a little. It was an achingly feminine look that invited anexplanation.“I’m an artist.”He glanced at the traffic stopped across the intersection to his left, makingsure that no rogue construction trucks were about to make another run at them.With the lights flashing on the police car sitting at the curb, everyone wasdriving cautiously.He was glad to at last be away from the pirate plumbers. They looked to havedeveloped a grudge. Alex felt a flash of anger at the injustice of theirbelligerent attitude toward him.“So you paint portraits?” she asked.Alex shrugged. “Sometimes.”Portraits weren’t his specialty, although they did occasionally bring him someincome. He would work for free, though, just for a chance to paint this woman.In his mind he was already analyzing the curves and planes of her features,trying to imagine whether he could ever get such an enchanting face right. Hewould never start such a work unless he was confident that he could get itperfect. This was not a woman he would want to render in anything less thanperfection. Changing her in any way would be unthinkable.He gestured to the low, elegant structure peeking through the shimmering leaves.“I have a few pieces at the gallery.”She glanced to where he had indicated, almost as if she expected to see thegallery itself standing there.“I’m headed there now, as a matter of fact. If you’d like to see some of mywork, the gallery is down a little ways from Regent Jewelry . . .”His voice trailed off. He suddenly felt a little foolish at his presumption. Heimagined that a woman like her would be interested only in the exclusive jewelrystore or the boutiques. Since she wasn’t wearing any jewelry he wasn’t sure whyhe assumed such a thing, but he guessed he feared that she probably wasn’tinterested in art—or his art, anyway.“I’d like to see your work.”He looked over at her. “Really?”She nodded as she pulled a wavy lock of blond hair back off her face.Alex felt his cell phone vibrate silently in his pocket, letting him know thatanother text message was being delivered. He sighed inwardly as he cut astraight line across the nearly empty parking lot. It was only midmorning; mostpeople didn’t arrive until closer to lunchtime. A few dozen expensive cars,glittering in subdued shades of silvers, reds, and ambers, were parked in acluster around the main entrance.Message delivered, his phone finally stopped vibrating. Bethany, he was sure,was responsible. He hadn’t even known that his phone was capable of receivingtext messages until after he’d met her several weeks back. After he’d gone outwith her a second time she had started sending him text messages. They werepainfully petty. He rarely read them anymore. She usually asked things like ifhe was thinking of her. He hardly even knew her. What was he supposed to say?That she hadn’t entered his mind?He ignored the phone as he opened the center-pivot glass door for the woman. Itwasn’t the kind of shopping area that lent itself to the financially timid. Sheglided through the doorway with the kind of grace and confidence born of beingused to such places.Before the door closed Alex glanced back across the lot, between the lindentrees lining the edge of the street, to the white truck still sitting at thecurb in front of the police car. He couldn’t make out the men inside.As they passed into the hushed, grand seclusion inside, he was a littlesurprised to see the woman only glance at the alluring glimmer of RegentJewelry. As they strolled through the halls, her cool gaze took in eachexclusive shop in equal measure. The dress shop, Alex knew, didn’t sellanything, except maybe a scarf, for less than four figures. The woman scannedthe outfits in the window with no more interest than she took in the shoes inthe next store window, or the purses in the next.Alex saw other women cast appraising glances her way. She looked at the otherwomen, but in an altogether different manner. They were evaluating her socially.She was assessing them . . . spatially, checking their distance before brieflytaking in their faces as if to see whether she recognized them.“Down here, around the corner,” Alex said, drawing her attention.When he spoke to her she met his gaze with a focused involvement that wasrespectful and interested. He couldn’t imagine this woman ever sending him atext message.She allowed him to direct her around the curve of the corridor decorated withsweeping inlaid metal lines in the speckled pink granite floor. Cast-stonearches stood at a branch of halls. The one Alex took led into a sunlit corridor.Skylights overhead let streamers of light play across the planters overflowingwith philodendron and an assortment of salmon-colored hibiscus.Alex drew them to a halt before the gallery window surrounded with ornate goldmolding. The molding, meant to resemble a picture frame, showcased some of themore expensive and sought-after works just inside.Alex gestured through the window. “This is the place.”A twitch of disapproval ghosted across her features. “Do you mean to say thatyou . . . painted this?”She was looking at the large piece displayed in the center of the crowded floorjust inside the window. It had been done by R. C. Dillion, a midwestern artistwho was becoming a national figure. It was said of him that R. C. Dillion was atthe forefront of a new reality in art.“No, not that one,” Alex said. He leaned closer as he pointed beyond thenonobjective works crowding the window to a small landscape displayed on aneasel near the back. “That’s one of mine back there. The mountain scene with thepines in the foreground to the left.”Alex was relieved to see that Mr. Martin, the gallery owner, had at least put asmall spotlight on the painting rather than setting it on the floor, leanedagainst a wall, as he sometimes did. The small light made the sunlit clearing,within the hushed cathedral of trees, come to life.“See the one I mean?” he asked as he glanced over at her.Her mouth opened a little in surprise. “Alexander, it’s beautiful.”Alex froze.He knew that he hadn’t yet mentioned his name. He knew because he had beenwaiting for the right time to do so without sounding like he was coming on toher.It finally dawned on him that she’d probably been to Regent Center before andshe must have visited the gallery. That only made sense; wealthy women knew thegallery, after all—they just didn’t tend to take note of his work. Alex’s bio,with his photo, was posted beside his paintings. He signed his name in thelonger form—Alexander—and that was also the way it was shown on his biography.She must have known his name from that.She looked up to study his face intently. “Why did you paint that?”Alex shrugged. “I like the woods.”Her eyes began to look a little more liquid, as if what she saw in that paintinghad some hallowed meaning to her. “No, I mean why did you paint that particularplace in the woods?”“I don’t know. I just made it up from my imagination.”She looked like she wanted to say something, but she instead turned back tostare through the window, looking too taken for words.Alex was about to ask why that particular scene seemed to matter so much to herwhen his cell phone rang. He didn’t want to answer it, but the woman was staringthrough the window, absorbed in gazing at his painting, so he turned aside andopened the phone.“Hello?”“Alex, it’s me,” Bethany said.“Uh, hi,” he said quietly as he hunched over the phone.“Didn’t you get my text messages?”“I’m sorry, I haven’t read any of them today. I told you, you should just callif you have something to say.”“You’re so silly, Alex,” she said in a lilting voice that he found grating. “Whodoesn’t use text? Don’t be so ancient. Everyone does it.”“I don’t. So, what is it?”“Well, if you would have read the messages that I took the time to send you,you’d know. I made plans to take you out tonight and get you good and drunk foryour birthday.”She sounded miffed. Alex didn’t really care. Nor did he care to get drunk or doanything else to celebrate such a somber day. He was even more annoyed at herpresumption.Bethany was beginning to assume that there was far more between them than wasactually there. He’d taken her out a couple of times—enough to find out thatthey didn’t really have anything in common. The dates had been relatively shortand unremarkable. He didn’t know what she saw in him, anyway. They just didn’tclick. She liked expensive things and Alex wasn’t wealthy. She liked to partyand Alex didn’t.And, his art bored her.“I’m sorry, Bethany, but let me read your messages and I’ll get back to you.”“Well—”He flipped the cover closed and turned back to the woman. She was watching himagain in that way that he couldn’t quite figure out.“Sorry.” He briefly held up the phone in explanation before stuffing it backinto his pocket.She glanced back over her shoulder to his painting. “Me too. My time is up,” shesaid as she turned away from the window to face him. “I have to go for now.”“Really? Well can I at least—”The phone rang again. He wished he had shut it off.The woman’s small smile returned, curving her lips in a way that was bewitching.She arched an eyebrow as she gestured to his pocket. “You’d better talk to heror she’ll be even more angry with you.”“I don’t really care.”But Alex knew that Bethany wasn’t going to give up, so he finally pulled theringing phone from his pocket. He held a finger up toward the woman. “Give mejust a moment, please?”The woman took one last look through the window and then turned back to him,considering. The way her expression turned serious made him pause in place.The phone stopped ringing as it went to message.“Be careful of mirrors,” she said at last into the quiet. “They can watch youthrough mirrors.”Goose bumps tingled up Alex’s arms.He almost dropped the phone when it rang again.“What?”She only stared at him with that bottomless gaze.“Please,” he said, “hold on for just a second?”She melted back into the shadows between the shops, as if to give him hisprivacy on the phone.He turned away and flipped open the phone. “What?”“Alex, don’t you ever—”“Look, I’m right in the middle of something important. I’ll call you back.”He flipped the phone closed without waiting for Bethany to agree and turned backto where the woman waited in the shadowy nook.She was gone. Simply . . . gone."},{"pageContent":"3.ALEX CRANED HIS NECK, K , looking around at the well-dressed shoppers strollingthe hushed hall. Most were women. He didn’t see the one he was looking for.How could she have vanished so quickly?He trotted to the archway, looking back toward the massive Regent Jewelry, buthe didn’t see her there, either. It was not simply startling that she had leftso quickly, it was maddening. He had wanted to get her name, at least.He hadn’t expected that he would so abruptly run out of time. He had missed hischance.But maybe not. She had said that she had to go “for now.”He wondered what she’d meant by that.He let out a long sigh. Probably nothing. She was probably only being polite.She’d probably wanted to be rid of him the same way he’d wanted to be rid ofBethany.Somehow, though, it didn’t seem like that was it. Something else was going on,he just didn’t know what.In the hallway filled with the whisper of footsteps and soft conversationsprinkled with light laughter it began to feel like he had just imagined thewhole thing.That was a thought he truly didn’t want to have, especially not on this day ofall days.The Regent Center suddenly felt very empty and very lonely. His mood, which hadonly started to lift, sank back down.He pressed his lips tightly together in agitation at Bethany and her mindlesstext messages and phone calls. They were never important, but they had justinterrupted something that was.Letting out another sigh of disappointment, he finally made his way back throughthe clusters of women out for a bit of shopping. He scanned the faces, absentlylooking for the one who had vanished. He eventually ended up back at the gallerywithout seeing her, somehow having known that he wouldn’t find her.Seized by a sudden idea, he peered in the window, wondering if maybe the womanhad actually gone inside to look at his painting while he was answering thephone. Maybe he simply hadn’t noticed. Maybe she’d just wanted to see it upclose. After all, she had seemed to be taken by the painting.Peering in the gallery window, he didn’t see the woman, but Mr. Martin saw himand flashed a polite smile.Hand-wrought Tibetan bells hung by a knotted prayer cord on the door into thesmall shop rang their simple, familiar chime as Alex closed the door on his wayin. He only glanced at the featured pieces on his way past. He had troublecalling them “works.”The slender Mr. Martin, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit, had a habit ofnesting his hands one atop the other. He usually reversed the order severaltimes before their arrangement suited him. A bright pink tie flared from hiscollar just below his prominent Adam’s apple.“Mr. Martin, how are things today? I just stopped by to see if—”“Sorry, Alex. None of your pieces have sold since the one last month.”Alex drew his lower lip through his teeth. “I see.”He guessed he would have to walk whenever possible until he could get his truckfixed. Fortunately the places he needed to get to were close enough, now thatshops and stores had opened in the last year. His grandfather’s house had alwaysbeen within walking distance. Ben, in fact, was probably waiting for Alex tostop by.Mr. Martin drew on his thin smile again as he leaned in patiently. “If you wouldlet me guide you, Alex, I know that I could make a name for you—along with a lotof money.” He lifted a hand, waggling his lithesome fingers toward the paintingdisplayed in the center view of the window. “R. C. Dillion is making himself afortune with his striking works. His all too obvious anguish and distress overthe ruination of the planet is not just heartbreaking, but sought after.Collectors want an artist who can bring such meaningful emotion to the canvas.It gives them a certain sense of pride to let others see the important concernsthey so obviously share with the artist.”Alex glanced at the angry slashes of red paint. It certainly did represent ruin.“I hadn’t been aware that that was what R. C. Dillion was trying to portray.”“Of course not, Alex, because you won’t take my valuable advice and open yourmind to the essence of other realities, as important artists do.”“I like painting the essence of our own reality,” Alex said as civilly as hecould. “If you think that the buyers are so interested in the planet, why don’tyou show them my paintings of it?”Mr. Martin smiled in that tolerant way he had. “I do, Alex, I do, but they’remore interested in true artistic vision than . . . than what you do. You shownothing of the rapacious nature of mankind. Your work is charming, but notimportant. It’s hardly groundbreaking.”“I see.”Had he not been so dejected, Alex likely would have gotten angry. Through hisgloom, though, the slight didn’t lift his hackles. Instead it only served toweigh him down further.“But I assure you, Alex, I do display your work as favorably as possible, and wehave had some minor success with it.” The smile became fawning as Mr. Martinremembered that occasionally one of Alex’s paintings did sell, and that hisgallery took a forty percent commission. “I’m hoping for better sales of yourwork when the holidays come around.”Alex nodded. He knew that arguing his beliefs about art was pointless. It onlymattered if he could sell his work. He had success with a few people whoappreciated his landscapes. There were still people who wanted to see works likehis, paintings that crystallized the beauty of a scene. There were people whoappreciated a vision that uplifted them.The woman, after all, had liked it, and she easily appeared more intelligentthan any of Mr. Martin’s collectors. She knew what she liked and wasn’t afraidto say so. Most of Mr. Martin’s clients depended on him to tell them what theyshould like. They were willing to pay handsomely for such erudite guidance.Still, Alex needed to eat.“Thanks, Mr. Martin. I’ll check back—”“Don’t worry, Alex, I’ll call you right away if one of your pieces sells, butplease think about what I said.”Alex nodded politely before he headed for the door. He knew that no matter howhungry he got he would never throw paint at a canvas and pretend it was art.It was turning out to be an even more depressing birthday than he had expected.His grandfather might cheer him up, though.He paused, then turned back. “Mr. Martin, I need to take this one with me.”A frown creased Mr. Martin’s brow as he watched Alex lift the small paintingfrom the easel. “Take it? But why?”Taking one painting left the gallery with six of his pieces to sell. It wasn’tlike there was a run on his work.“It’s for a gift—for someone who values it.”A cunning grin overcame Mr. Martin. “Clever, Alex. Sometimes a small gift can bethe seed that starts an expensive collection.”Alex forced a brief smile and nodded as he tucked the painting under his arm.He didn’t know if he would ever see the woman again. He realized that it wasrather silly to think that he would.But if he did, he wanted to give her the little painting. He wanted to see hersmile again, and if it took only a painting then it would be more than worth it."},{"pageContent":"4.I THINK THE MIRRORS ARE WATCHING ME,” Alex said as he stared off into distantthoughts. Ben shot him a look back over his shoulder. “Mirrors tend to do that.”“No, I mean it, Ben. Lately it feels like they’re watching me.”“You mean you see yourself watching you.”“No.” He finally focused his gaze on his grandfather. “I mean it feels likesomeone else is watching me through mirrors.”Ben gave him a look. “Someone else.”“Yes.”Alex wondered how she knew.He was beginning to seriously doubt that she had been real. Was it possible thathe could have imagined such a thing?Was it beginning to happen to him, too? He fought back a ripple of panic at thethought.“Don’t let your imagination get the best of you, Alexander,” his grandfathersaid, turning back to the work at his bench.Alex’s gaze again wandered off into gloomy memories.“Do you think that I’ll end up crazy, too?” he murmured after a time.In the dead silence he turned to see that his grandfather had halted histinkering at his timeworn workbench to stare up with an unsettling look, a kindof hard glare that could have been born only in dark and angry thoughts.Alex found such a look frightening in that it was so unlike his grandfather, orat least the man Alex knew.A wrinkled smile finally banished the forbidding look. “No, Alex,” the old mansaid in a gentle voice, “I don’t think that at all. Why would you come up withsuch depressing thoughts on your birthday?”Alex leaned back against the paneling covering the stairwell nook so that themirror on the wall to his left couldn’t see him. He folded his arms.“I’m the same age, you know. Today I’m twenty-seven, the same age as she waswhen she got sick . . . when she went crazy.”The old man stirred a long finger through a battered aluminum ashtrayoverflowing with a collection of odd screws. Ben had had that ashtray full ofused screws for as long as Alex could remember. It wasn’t a convincing search.“Alexander,” Ben said in a soft sigh, “I never thought your mother was crazythen, and I still don’t.”Alex didn’t think that Ben would ever come to grips with the sad reality. Alexremembered all too well his mother’s inconsolable, hysterical fits overstrangers who were supposedly after her. He didn’t believe that the doctorswould keep the woman locked in an institution for eighteen years if she wasn’tseriously mentally ill, but he didn’t say so. Even having the silent thoughtseemed cruel.He had been nine when his mother had been institutionalized.At such a young age Alex hadn’t understood. He had been terrified. Hisgrandmother and Ben took him in, loved him, took care of him, and eventuallybecame his legal guardians. Living just down the street from his parents’ housekept continuity in Alex’s life. His grandparents kept the house clean and inshape for when his mother got better and was released—for when she finally camehome. That never happened.Over the years as he grew up Alex would go over there from time to time, usuallyat night, to sit alone in the house. It felt like his only connection to hisparents. It seemed to be another world there, always the same, everything frozenin place, like a stopped clock. It was an unchanging reminder of a life that hadbeen abruptly interrupted, a life suspended.It had made him feel like he didn’t know his place in the world, like he wasn’teven sure who he was.Sometimes at night, before he went to sleep, Alex still worried that he, too,would end up falling prey to insanity. He knew that such things ran in families,that insanity could be passed down. As a boy, he’d heard other kids say as much,even if it had been in whispers behind his back. The whispers, though, hadalways been just loud enough for him to hear.Yet when Alex looked at the way other people lived, the things they did, thethings they believed, he thought that he was the sanest person he knew. He oftenwondered how people could be so deluded about things, like the way they wouldbelieve it was art if someone else simply said it was.Still, there were things when he was alone that worried him.Like mirrors.He studied the side of the old man’s gaunt face as he searched through all theodd bits of junk littering the workbench. His gray stubble showed that he hadn’tshaved that morning and possibly the morning before that. He had probably beenbusy in his workshop and had no idea that the sun had come and gone and comeagain. His grandfather was like that—especially since his wife, Alex’sgrandmother, had died. Alex often thought that his grandfather had his owndifficulties dealing with reality after his son and then his wife had bothpassed away.No one thought the old man was crazy, exactly. Most people thought that he wasmerely “eccentric.” That was the polite word people used when a person was alittle loony. His grandfather’s impishly innocent outlook on life—the way healways smiled and marveled at everything, and the way he became distracted bythe most ordinary objects, along with his utter lack of interest in the businessof others—reassured people that he was harmless. Just the neighborhood nut. Mostpeople regarded Ben as a meaningless old man who tinkered with the likes of tincans, tattered books, and odd assortments of mold that he grew in glass petridishes.It was an image that Alex knew his grandfather cultivated—being invisible, hecalled it—and was quite different from the kind of man Ben was in reality.Alex never thought that Ben was crazy, or even eccentric, merely . . . unique, asingular, remarkable individual who knew about things that most people could noteven imagine. From what Alex gathered, Ben had seen enough death. He loved lifeand simply wanted to investigate everything about it.“What are you doing here, anyway?” Ben asked.Alex blinked at the question. “What?”“It’s your birthday. Shouldn’t you be with a young woman, out enjoyingyourself?”Alex let out a deep breath, not wanting to get into it. He forced a smile. “Ithought you might have a present for me, so I came by.”“A present? What for?”“My birthday, remember?”The old man scowled. “Of course I remember. I remember everything, remember?”“Did you remember to get me a present?” Alex chided.“You’re too old for a present.”“I got you a present for your birthday. Are you too old?”The scowl deepened. “What am I to do with, with . . . whatever that thing is.”“It makes coffee.”“My old pot makes coffee.”“Bad coffee.”The old man shook a finger. “Just because things are old, that doesn’t meanthey’re of no use anymore. New things aren’t necessarily any better, you know.Some are worse than what came before.”Alex leaned in a little and lifted an eyebrow. “Did you ever try the coffeemakerI got you?”Ben withdrew the finger. “What is it you want for your birthday?”Alex shrugged. “I don’t know. I thought you’d get me a present, that’s all. Idon’t really need anything, I guess.”“There you go, then. I didn’t need a coffeemaker, either. Could have saved yourmoney and bought yourself a present.”“It was meant to show respect. It was token of love.”“I already know you love me. What’s not to love?”Alex couldn’t help smiling as he slid onto the spare stool. “You have a funnyway of making me forget about my mother on my birthday.”Alex immediately regretted his words. It seemed inappropriate to even suggestthat he might want to forget his mother on his birthday.Ben, a tight smile on his lips, turned back to his workbench and picked up asoldering iron. “Consider it my birthday gift.”Alex watched smoke curl up as his grandfather soldered the end of a long, thinmetal tube to the top of a tin lid.“What are you making?”“An extractor.”“What are you trying to extract?”“An essence.”“An essence of what?”The old man turned in a huff. “Sometimes you can be a pest, Alexander, do youknow that?”Alex lifted one shoulder in a half-shrug. “I was just curious, that’s all.” Hewatched in silence as solder turned to liquid metal and flowed around the end ofthe tube.“Curiosity gets you into trouble,” his grandfather finally said, half under hisbreath.Alex’s gaze dropped away. “I remember my mother saying—back before she gotsick—that I got my sense of curiosity from you.”“You were a kid at the time. All kids are curious.”“You’re hardly a kid, Ben. Life should be about being curious, shouldn’t it?You’ve always been curious.”In the silence of the basement room, the only sound was the “tick” made eachtime the plastic tail of the black cat went back and forth, marking each passingsecond on the clock in the cat’s stomach.Still hunched over the bench, Ben turned his dark eyes toward his grandson.“There are things in this world to be curious about,” the old man said in asoft, cryptic voice. “Things that don’t make proper sense, aren’t the way theyappear. That’s why I’ve taught you the way I have—to be prepared.”A shiver tingled up between Alex’s shoulder blades. His grandfather’s chillingtone was like a doorway opening a crack, a doorway into places Alex could notbegin to imagine. It was a doorway into places that were not the realm oflighthearted wonder that usually seemed to make up Ben’s life. It was the flipside of lighthearted, seen only during training sessions.Alex was well aware that, for all his tinkering, his grandfather never reallymade anything. Not in the conventional sense, anyway. He never made a birdhouse,or fixed a screen door, or even cobbled together lawn art out of scraps ofmetal.“What essence are you extracting?”The old man smiled in a curious fashion. “Oh, who knows, Alexander? Who reallyknows?”“You must know what you’re trying to do.”“Trying and doing are two different things,” Ben muttered. He looked back overhis shoulder and changed the subject. “So, what is it you want for yourbirthday?”“How about a new starter motor for my truck.” Alex’s mouth twisted indiscontent. “Not all old things are so great. Women aren’t much impressed with aguy who has a Jeep that won’t start half the time. They’d rather go out with aguy with a real car.”“Ah,” the old man said, nodding to himself.Alex realized that, without meaning to, he had just answered the question he’davoided when he’d first come down into Ben’s workshop. He realized that hehadn’t remembered to call Bethany back. He supposed it was more avoidance thanforgetfulness.“Anyway,” Alex said, leaning an arm on the bench, “she’s not my type.”“You mean she thinks that you’re too . . . curious?” The old man chuckled at hisown joke.Alex shot Ben a scowl. “No, I mean she’d rather be out going to clubs anddrinking than doing anything with her life. In fact, she wants to get me drunkfor my birthday. There’s more to life than just partying.”“Like what?” Ben prodded softly.“I don’t know.” Alex sighed, tired of the subject. He slid off the stool. “Iguess I’d better get going.”“A date with someone else?”“Yeah, with a junkyard to try to find a cheap starter motor that works.”Maybe if he did ever see the strange woman again, and his Cherokee would start,he could take her for a drive in the country. He knew some beautiful roadsthrough the hills.He considered his memory of the woman, the way she walked through Regent Centeras if she belonged in such places, and dismissed his daydream as unrealistic.“You should get a new car, Alex—they work a lot better.”“Tell that to my checking account. The gallery hasn’t sold one of my paintingsin nearly a month.”“You need money for a car? I might be able to help out—considering that it’syour birthday.”Alex made a sour face. “Ben, do you have any idea what a new car costs? I’mdoing all right but I don’t have that much money.” Alex knew that hisgrandfather didn’t, either.Ben scratched the hollow of his cheek. “Well, I think you just might have enoughfor any new car you could want.”Alex’s brow twitched. “What are you talking about?”“It’s your twenty-seventh birthday.”“And what does that mean?”Ben tilted his head in thought. “Well, as near as I can figure, it has somethingto do with the seven.”“The seven what?”“The seven . . . in twenty-seven.”“You lost me.”Ben squinted off into the distance as he journeyed into distracted thoughts.“I’ve tried to figure it out, but I can’t make sense of it. The seven is my onlyreal clue, the only thing I have to go on.”Alex heaved a sigh in irritation at Ben’s habit of wandering off down rabbitholes. “You know I don’t like riddles, Ben. If you have something to say, thentell me what you’re talking about.”“The seven.” Ben looked up from his essence extractor. “Your mother wastwenty-seven when it came to her. Now you’re twenty-seven, and it’s come toyou.”The skin of Alex’s arms tingled with goose bumps. By her twenty-seventh birthdayinsanity had come to his mother. The familiar basement was beginning to feelclaustrophobic.“Ben, stop fooling around. What are you talking about?”Ben paused at his work and twisted around on his stool to study his grandson. Itwas an uncomfortable, searching gaze.“I have something that comes to be yours on your twenty-seventh birthday,Alexander. It came to your mother on her twenty-seventh birthday. Well, it wouldhave . . .” He shook his head sadly. “The poor woman. Bless her tortured soul.”Alex straightened, determined not to get caught up in some fool word game withhis grandfather.“What’s going on?”His grandfather slipped down off the stool. He paused to reach out with a bonyhand and pat Alex on the shoulder.“Like I said, I have something that becomes yours on your twenty-seventhbirthday.”“What is it?”Ben ran his fingers back over his head of thin, gray hair. “It’s . . . well,” hesaid, waving the hand in a vague gesture, “let me show you. The time has comefor you to see it.”"},{"pageContent":"5.ALEX WATCHED AS HIS GRANDFATHER shuffled across the cluttered basement, kickingthe odd cardboard box out of his way. At the far wall he moved rakes, hoes, andshovels to the side. Half of them fell over, clattering to the floor. Bengrumbled under his breath as he used a foot to push the errant rakes away untilhe had cleared a spot against the brick foundation. To Alex’s astonishment hisgrandfather then started pulling bricks out of a pilaster in the foundationwall.“What in the world are you doing?”Holding an armload of a half-dozen bricks, Ben paused to look back over hisshoulder. “Oh, I put it in here in case of fire.”That much made sense—after a fashion. Alex was perpetually surprised that hisgrandfather hadn’t already burned down his house, what with the way he wasalways using matches, torches, and burners in his tinkering.As Ben started stacking bricks on the floor, Alex turned to check. Just as he’dsuspected, his grandfather had forgotten the soldering iron. Alex picked it upjust as it was starting to blacken a patch on the workbench. He set the hot ironin its metal holder, then sighed in exasperation as he wet a finger with histongue and used it to quench the smoking patch of wood.“Ben, you nearly caught your bench on fire. You have to be more careful.” Hetapped the fire extinguisher hanging on the foundation wall. He couldn’t tell ifit was full or not. He turned over the tag, squinting, looking for an expirationor last inspection. He didn’t see one. “This thing is charged and up-to-date,isn’t it?”“Yes, yes,” Ben muttered.When Alex turned back, his grandfather was standing close, holding out a largemanila envelope. Traces of ancient stains were visible under a layer of graymortar dust.“This is intended for you . . . on your twenty-seventh birthday.”Alex stared at the suddenly ominous thing his grandfather was holding out.“How long have you had this?”“Nearly nineteen years.”Alex frowned. “And you kept it walled up in your basement?”The old man nodded. “To keep it safe until I could give it to you at the propertime. I didn’t want you to grow up knowing about this. Such things, before theright time, can change the course of a young person’s life—change it for theworse.”Alex planted his hands on his hips. “Ben, why do you do such strange things?What if you’d died? Did you ever think of that? What if you’d died and yourhouse got sold?”“My will leaves you the house.”“I know that, but maybe I’d sell it. I would never have known that you had thishidden away down here.”His grandfather leaned close. “It’s in the will.”“What’s in the will?”“The instructions that tell you where this was kept and that it’s yours—but notuntil your twenty-seventh birthday.” Ben smiled in a cryptic fashion. “Wills areinteresting things; you can put a lot of curious things in such documents.”When his grandfather shoved the envelope at him Alex took it, but onlyreluctantly. As strange as his grandfather’s behavior sometimes was, this rankedright up there with the strangest. Who would keep papers hidden in the brickwall in his basement? And why?Alex was suddenly worried about the answers to those questions—and others thatwere only beginning to formulate in the back of his mind.“Come on,” his grandfather said as he shuffled back to the workbench. With anarm he swept aside the clutter that covered the work surface. He slapped hispalm on the cleared spot on the bench. “Put it here, in the light.”The flap was torn open—with no attempt to be sneaky about it. Knowing hisgrandfather, he would have long ago opened the envelope and studied whatever wasinside. Alex noticed that the neatly typed address label was made out to hisfather. He pulled a stack of papers from the envelope. They were clippedtogether at the top left corner. The cover letter had an embossed logo in fadedblue ink saying it was from LANCASTER, BUCKMAN, FENTON, a law firm in Boston.He tossed the papers on the workbench. “You’ve known all along what this is?”Alex asked, already knowing the answer. “You’ve read it all?”Ben waved a hand dismissively. “Yes, yes. It’s a transfer of deed. Once it’sexecuted, you become a landowner.”Alex was taken aback. “Land?”“Quite a lot of land, actually.”Alex was suddenly so full of questions that he couldn’t seem to think straight.“What do you mean, I’ll become a landowner? What land? Why? Whose is it? And whyon my twenty-seventh birthday?”Ben’s brow creased as he paused to consider. “I think it has to do with theseven. Like I said, it went to your mother on her twenty-seventhbirthday—because your father had died before his twenty-seventh birthday when itwould have gone to him. So, the way I figure it, the seven has to be the key.”“If it went to my mother, then why is it mine?”Ben tapped the papers lying on the workbench. “It was supposed to go to her,because your father had passed away, but the title to the land couldn’t betransferred to her.”“Why not?” Alex asked.His grandfather lowered his voice as he leaned closer. “Because she was declaredmentally incompetent.”The silence dragged on a moment as Ben let that sink in before he went on.“The stipulations in this last will and testament specify that the heir to whomthe title is transferred must be of sound mind. Your mother was declared not tobe of sound mind and has been in that institution ever since. There’s a codicilto the will that stipulates that if the heir in line isn’t able to takeownership of the title to the land because of death or mental incapacitation,then it remains in abeyance until the next heir in line becomes twenty-seven,whereupon it is automatically reassigned to them. If there is no heir, or ifthey are likewise declared in violation of the stipulations—”“You mean crazy.”“Well, yes,” Ben said. “If for any reason the title can’t be transferred to yourfather, mother, or any of their issue—that means their descendants, and you’rethe only one of those—then the land goes to a conservation trust.”Alex scratched his temple as he tried to take it all in.“How much land are we talking about?”“Enough for you to sell it and buy yourself a new car. That’s what you ought todo.” Ben shook a cautionary finger. “This business with the seven is nothing tofool around with, Alex.”For some inexplicable reason beyond his grandfather’s admonition, Alex didn’tfeel at all fortunate at the windfall.“Where is this land?”Ben gestured irritably. “Back East. In Maine.”“Where you used to live?”“Not exactly. It’s farther inland. It was land that has been in our familyforever, but they’re all dead now, so it goes to you.”“Why not to you?”Ben shrugged. “Don’t know.” He suddenly grinned and leaned in. “Well, actually,it’s probably because they never liked me. Besides, it’s just as well—I’ve nodesire to live there again. Blackflies and mud in the spring, mosquitoes in thesummer, and endless snow in the winter. I’ve spent enough of my life hip deep inmud and bugs. The weather here suits me better.”Alex wondered if the people who made up the will had discounted Ben because theydidn’t consider him of sound mind in the first place.“I’ve heard that autumn is beautiful back East,” Alex said.Autumn would soon arrive. He wondered if there was enough land to get away andbe alone for a while to paint. From time to time Alex liked to hike intowilderness areas to be alone and paint. He liked the way the simplicity ofprimeval solitude allowed him to lose himself in the scenes he created.“How much land are we talking about? Is there at least a few acres or so? I’veheard that some of the land in Maine is pretty expensive.”“That’s on the coast,” Ben scoffed. “This is inland. Inland the land isn’t worthnearly as much. Still . . .”Alex gingerly lifted the cover letter, as if it might suddenly bite him, andscanned the legal jargon.“Still,” his grandfather went on, “I’d venture to say that this is enough to buyyou a car.” He leaned closer. “Any car you want.”Alex looked up from the papers. “So how much land is it?”“A little under fifty thousand acres.”Alex blinked. “Fifty thousand acres?”His grandfather nodded. “You’re now one of the largest private landowners inMaine—other than the paper companies. At least, you will be once the title istransferred.”Alex let out a low whistle at the very thought. “Well, I guess I very well mightbe able to sell a piece of it and buy me a car. I might even sell enough tobuild—”Ben was shaking his head. “Sorry, but you can’t.”“Can’t what?”“Sell a part of it. The covenants to the deed say that you can’t sell any partof it. If you ever want to sell, you have to sell the whole thing, all in onelot, all together and intact, to the conservation trust that’s holding the land.They own the surrounding land.”“I’d have to sell it all—and just to this one group?” Alex frowned. “Are yousure I couldn’t just sell some of it if I wanted to? Just a little?”Ben was shaking his head. “Back when the papers first came your father and Istudied the documents. We even went to a lawyer friend your father knew. Heconfirmed what we thought from what we’d read. It’s airtight. Any violation ofthe stipulations will result in the title reverting permanently to theconservation trust.“It’s a very tricky document. It’s drawn up in a way that ensures that anydeviation from the stipulations will cause the land to go to the trust. There’sno wiggle room. It’s constructed so as to tightly control what happens to theland. You might say that it doesn’t grant an inheritance so much as it offerschoices among very limited options.“With your father’s premature passing, and then your mother getting sick, thetransfer of title wasn’t able to go forward, so it was put in abeyance, inlimbo, until you were twenty-seven.”“What if I don’t want to decide right now what I want to do?”“You have the year you are twenty-seven to decide to take title or not. Youdon’t have to take the land. You can refuse it and then it goes to the trust. Ifyou don’t act while you’re still twenty-seven, title to the land automaticallytransfers to the trust—except under one condition: your heir.“You’re presently the last heir in line, Alex. You aren’t allowed to will theland to anyone other than a direct descendant. If you never have children, then,when you eventually die, the land goes to the trust.”“What if next week I get hit by a bus and die?”“Then the title immediately transfers to the trust—permanently—because you don’thave an heir, a child. If you become a father, even if you don’t act to claimrightful ownership during the time you’re twenty-seven, then that child becomespart and parcel of the will. It waits for them to come of age. In fact, that’show you came to this place. If you’re hit by a bus it doesn’t affect anyoffspring’s rights, just as your father’s death didn’t negate your rights.“You can take title and enjoy the land all you want and if you ever havechildren you can pass it on to them, providing you haven’t sold it to the trust.Once sold to them it’s theirs forever.”“If I can only sell to the trust, then they can set the price cheap.”Ben flipped through the pages, searching, until he found what he was lookingfor. “No, look here.” He tapped the page. “You have to sell it to the DaggettTrust—that’s the conservation group—but they must pay fair market value. You canname your own appraiser to ensure that the price is fair. And I can tell youthat at fair market value that much land, even being inland, is worth afortune.”Alex stared off in thought. “I could paint all I want.”Ben smiled. “You know that I think a person should prepare for the worst butlive all they can of life. You could sell the land and then paint the rest ofyour life and never have to sell one of them. I hate to see you having to sellyour paintings. They hold such love of life. I hate to see you part with them.”Alex frowned as he came back from imagining. “Why would this trust want to buythis particular piece of land?”Ben shrugged. “They already own all of the surrounding land. None of it has everbeen developed. Most of it is virgin timber that’s been in trust for ages; theywant to keep it that way. Our family’s piece is the last remaining part to thepuzzle.“The land owned by the trust is closed to people. No one is ever allowed ontothe land—not even hikers. The Nature Alliance is a little miffed that theyaren’t allowed in. They think they should have special access since they’re sodevoted to preserving nature and all. I guess they went along, though, since theconservation group’s purpose seems so high-minded.”“Well, what if I decide I don’t want to sell it? What if I want to keep it andbuild a house on it?”Ben tapped the papers again. “Can’t. The deed comes with a conservationeasement. That’s why we’ve never had to pay any property taxes. It’s some kindof special state wilderness area act that exempts land from taxes if it has aconservation easement constructed in the way this one has been drawn up.”“So, then, the land is of no use to me. I can’t use it for anything?”Ben shrugged. “You can enjoy it, I suppose. It’s your land if you want it. Youcan walk it, camp on it, things like that, but you can’t build any permanentbuildings on it. You also must abide by the trust bylaws that you won’t allowstrangers—hikers, campers, and such—on the land.”“Or I can sell it.”“Right. To the Daggett Trust.”It was all so unexpected and overwhelming. Alex had never owned any land, otherthan the house that had been his parents’. The house, just down the street, thehome where he’d partially grown up and now lived, was now in his name. In asense it still felt like it belonged to the ghosts of those long gone. With hishome on an ordinary lot Alex had a difficult time imagining how much land fiftythousand acres was. It seemed enough land that a person could become foreverlost there.“If I can’t really do anything with it, maybe I should just sell it,” Alex said,thinking out loud.Ben pulled his soldering project closer. “That sounds wise. Sell it and buyyourself that car you want.”Alex suspiciously eyed the back of his grandfather’s head. “I like the Cherokee.I only want a starter motor.”“It’s your birthday, Alex. Now you can buy yourself a proper present. The kindnone of us could ever afford for you.”“I never really wanted for anything,” Alex said in quiet protest as he laid ahand gently on his grandfather’s shoulder. “I always had everything I needed,and what I really needed the most.”“Kind of like my coffeepot,” his grandfather muttered. “Never wanted anythingbetter.” He abruptly turned back, looking uncharacteristically stern. “Sell theland, Alex. It’s just trees and rocks—it’s good for nothing.”Trees and rocks sounded good to Alex. He loved such places. That was hisfavorite thing to paint.“Sell it, that’s my advice,” Ben pressed. “You’ve no need of Castle Mountain.”“Castle what?”“Castle Mountain. It’s a mountain that sits roughly in the center of the land.”“Why’s it called Castle Mountain?”Ben turned away and worked for a time bending the tubing on his essenceextractor to some plan known only to him. “People say it looks like a castle.Never saw the resemblance, myself.”Alex smiled. “I don’t think Indian Rock looks much like an Indian.”“There you go. Same thing. People see what they want to see, I guess.” Bendidn’t look back as he handed the papers over his shoulder. “Get the deedtransferred, then sell the place and be rid of it, that’s my advice, Alex.”Alex slowly made his way to the stairs as he considered it all. He paused andlooked back at his grandfather.A dark look shadowed Ben’s face. “This is one of those things that I mentionedbefore, Alex, one of those things that doesn’t make proper sense.”Alex wondered at seeing such a forbidding look for a second time that day.“Thanks, Ben, for your advice.”His grandfather turned back to his soldering. “Don’t thank me unless you takethe advice. Unless you heed it, it’s just words.”Alex nodded absently. “I’m going to go see my mom.”“Give her my best,” Ben murmured without turning.His grandfather rarely went to visit his daughter-in-law. He hated the placewhere she was confined. Alex hated the place, too, but his mother was there andif he wanted to see her he had no choice.Alex stared down at the envelope in his hand. It seemed that such an unexpectedbirthday present should make him happy, but it didn’t. It only reminded him ofhis dead father and his mother lost to another world.Now this unknown connection to the past had found him.Alex ran his fingers lightly over the age-dried label made out to his father. Afaded pencil line ran through the name. Above, in the same nearly vanished,ghostlike pencil, was written his mother’s name. Her name was stricken throughwith a dark, angry line drawn in black ink.Above that, in his grandfather’s handwriting, it said “Alexander Rahl.”When Alex reached the landing on the stairs he thought that he saw someone outof the corner of his eye.He turned only to see himself looking back from a mirror.He stared for a moment; then his cell phone rang. When he answered it, he couldhear only weird, garbled sounds, like disembodied whispers churning up fromsomewhere deep on the other side of the universe. He glanced at the display. Itsaid OUT OF AREA. No doubt a wrong number. He flipped the cover closed andslipped the phone back in his pocket.“Alexander,” Ben called.Alex looked back, waiting.“Trouble will find you.”Alex smiled at his grandfather’s familiar mantra. It was meant as a world oflove and concern wrapped in a call for vigilance. The familiar touchstone madehim feel better, feel resolute.“Thanks, Ben. I’ll talk to you later.”Alex picked up the painting that he had brought from the gallery and headed upthe stairs."},{"pageContent":"6.ALEX HAD BEEN FORTUNATE. His Jeep Cherokee had started on the first try.After the long drive to the older part of downtown Orden, Nebraska, he parkednear the end of a side street that sloped off downhill. That way, if his Jeepwouldn’t start, he could let it roll to get the engine to turn over.In this older section of town there wasn’t much parking other than on thetree-lined streets. The needs of a hospital, parking being only one of them, hadlong ago rendered the facility obsolete and so it had been converted to aprivate asylum: Mother of Roses. The state paid for patients, like Alex’smother, who were placed there by the order of the court.In the beginning Ben had tried to get his daughter-in-law released into his andAlex’s grandmother’s custody. Alex had been too young to understand it all, butthe end result had been that Ben had eventually given up. Years later, when Alexhad pursued the same course, he had likewise gotten nowhere.Dr. Hoffmann, the head of the psychiatric staff, had assured Alex that hismother was better off under professional care. Besides that, he said that theycould not legally give him the responsibility of caring for a person who intheir professional opinion could still become violent. His grandfather had putan arm around Alex’s shoulders and told him to come to terms with the fact thatwhile there were those who went to Mother of Roses to get help, to get better,his mother would likely die there. It had felt to Alex like a death sentence.The mature trees on the streets in that part of town and on the limited groundsof Mother of Roses asylum made the place look less harsh than it was. Alex knewthat the somewhat distant hill where he’d parked made a convenient excuse todelay walking into the building where his mother was imprisoned. His insidesalways felt like they knotted up when he went into the place.On the way over he had been so distracted by scattered thoughts competing forattention that he’d nearly run a red light. The thought of Officer Slawinskiscowling at him had dissuaded him from trying to make it through the yellow. Asit turned out, the light had switched to red before he’d even reached thecrosswalk.For some reason it felt like a day to be careful. Staring up at the glow of ared light that had come quicker than expected had felt like cosmic confirmationof his caution.Walking beneath the enclosing shade of the mature oaks and maples, Alex headedaround the side of the nine-story brick building. The front, on ThirteenthStreet, had broad stone steps up to what he supposed was a beautiful entrance ofcast concrete meant to look like a stone façade of vines growing over an ornatepointed arch framing deep-set oak doors. Going in the front was a lot moretrouble because it required going through layers of bureaucracy needed forgeneral visitors. Close family were allowed to go in through a smaller entranceat the rear.Grass under the huge oaks in back thinned to bare dirt in patches where theground was heaved and uneven from massive roots hidden beneath. Alex glanced upat the windows all covered with security wire. Flesh was no match for that steelmesh. The back of the building was more honest about what it was.The sprawling lower floors of the hospital were for patients who went to Motherof Roses for treatment for emotional disorders, substance abuse and addiction,as well as rest and recovery. Alex’s mother was imprisoned on the smaller ninthfloor, a secure area reserved for patients considered dangerous. Some of themhad killed people and had been found to be mentally incompetent. Several timessince Alex’s mother had been confined at Mother of Roses there had been seriousattacks on other patients or staff. Alex always worried for her safety.He scanned the top row of almost opaque windows, even though he had never seenanything more than shadows in them.The steel door in back had a little square window with safety wire crisscrossedthrough it. When he pulled open the door he was hit by the hospital smell thatalways made him resist taking a deep breath.An orderly recognized him and nodded a greeting. Alex flashed a wooden smile ashe tossed his keys, pocketknife, change, and phone in a plastic tub on a tableto the side of the metal detector. After he passed through without setting offthe buzzers, an older security guard, who also knew Alex but didn’t smile,handed over the phone and his change. He would keep the knife and keys untilAlex left. Even keys could be snatched from a visitor and used as a weapon.Alex bent at the steel desk beyond the metal detector and picked up a cheap blueplastic pen attached by a dirty string to the registry clipboard. That stringwas the most lax security in the entire building. The woman at the desk, Doreen,knew him. Holding the phone to her ear with a shoulder, she flipped through aledger, answering questions about laundry deliveries. She smiled at Alex as helooked up from signing his name. She’d always been nice to him over the years,sympathizing with him at having to visit his mother in such a place.Alex took the only elevator that went to the ninth floor. He hated the greenmetal doors. The paint had been scratched off in horizontal patches by med cartshitting into it, leaving dirty metal to show through. The elevator smelledmusty. He knew the tune of every clunk and clatter it made on the way up,anticipated every shimmy in its labored travel.The elevator porpoised to a stop and finally opened before the ninth-floornurses’ station. Locked doors led to the women’s wing on one side, the men’s onthe other. Alex signed his name again and put in the time: three p.m. Visitorswere carefully monitored. He would have to sign out, with the time, when heleft. The elevator door at the top was kept locked and no one would unlock itwithout a completed sign-in-and-sign-out sheet—a precaution against a patienttalking his way past a gullible new employee.An orderly in white slacks and smock came out from a small office in the back ofthe nurses’ station, pulling his keys out on a thin wire cable extending fromthe reel attached to his belt. The orderly, a big man who always hunched, knewAlex. Just about everyone working at Mother of Roses knew Alex Rahl.The man looked through the little window in the solid oak door and then,satisfied that the way was clear, turned the key in the lock. He yanked open theheavy door.The man handed over a plastic key for the buzzer on the other side. “Ring whenyou’re finished, Alex.”Alex nodded. “How’s she doing?”The man shrugged his rounded shoulders. “Same.”“Has she caused you any trouble?”The man arched an eyebrow. “She tried to stab me to death with a plastic spoon afew days back. Yesterday she jumped a nurse and would have beaten her senselessif another orderly wouldn’t have been ten steps away at the time.”Alex shook his head. “I’m sorry, Henry.”The man shrugged again. “Part of the job.”“I wish I could make her stop.”Henry held the door open with one hand. “You can’t, Alex. Don’t beat yourself upover it. It’s not her fault; she’s sick.”The hall’s grayish linoleum floor was struck through with darker gray swirls andgreen speckles, presumably meant to add a little bit of interest. It was as uglyas anything Alex could imagine. Light from the sunroom up ahead reflected offthe ripply floor, making it look almost liquid. The evenly spaced rooms to eachside had varnished oak doors with silver metal push plates. None had locks. Eachroom was home to someone.Cries coming from dark rooms echoed through the hall. Angry voices and shoutswere commonplace—arguments with imaginary people who bedeviled some of thepatients.The showers at the rear of the bathroom were kept locked, along with a few ofthe rooms, rooms where patients were placed when they became violent. Locking apatient in a room was meant to encourage them to behave and be sociable.The sunroom, with its skylights, was a bright spot in a dark prison. Varnishedoak tables were neatly spaced throughout the room. They were bolted to thefloor. The flimsy plastic chairs weren’t.Alex immediately spotted his mother sitting on a couch against the far wall. Shewatched him coming without recognizing him. On rare occasions she did know whohe was, but he could tell by the look in her eyes that this time she didn’t.That was always the hardest thing for him—knowing that she usually didn’t haveany idea who he was.A TV bolted high on the wall was tuned to Wheel of Fortune. The gaiety andlaughter from the TV struck a stupefying contrast with the somber dayroom. A fewpatients laughed with the TV audience without comprehending what they werelaughing at. They only knew that laughter was called for and so they laughed outof a sense of social duty. Alex guessed that it was better to laugh than cry.Between the laughter, some of the younger women glared at him.“Hi, Mom,” he said in his sunniest voice as he approached.She wore pale green hospital-issue pajama pants and a simple flower-print top.The outfit was hideously ugly. Her hair was longer than the other residents’.Most of the women had their hair cut short and curled. Alex’s mother wasprotective of her sandy-colored, shoulder-length hair. She threw fits if theytried to cut it. The staff didn’t feel it was worth a battle to cut it short.Occasionally they would try, thinking she might have forgotten that she wantedit long. That was one thing she never forgot. Alex was glad that she hadsomething that seemed to matter to her.He sat on the couch beside her. “How are you doing?”She stared at him a moment. “Fine.” By her tone, he knew that she didn’t have aclue as to who he was.“I was here last week. Remember?”She nodded as she stared at him. Alex wasn’t sure if she even understood thequestion. Sometimes she would say things that he knew weren’t true. She wouldtell him that her sister had visited. She didn’t have a sister. She would saythat she had gone shopping. She was never allowed to leave the confines of theninth floor.He ran his hand down the side of her head. “Your hair looks pretty today.”“I brush it every day,” she said.An overweight male orderly wearing shiny black shoes that squeaked rolled a cartinto the sunroom. “Snack time, ladies.”The top of the cart displayed a few dozen plastic cups half filled with orangejuice, or something that resembled orange juice. The shelves in the cart heldbaloney-and-lettuce sandwiches on wheat bread. At least, Alex assumed it wouldbe baloney. It usually was.“How about a sandwich, Mom? You’re looking kind of skinny.Have you been eating?”Without protest she rose to take a sandwich and glass from the man with the cartwhen he rolled it near. “Here you go, Helen,” the man said as he handed her aplastic cup of orange juice and a sandwich.Alex followed as she shuffled to a table off in the far corner, away from theother residents.“They always want to talk,” she said as she glared at the women clustered on theother side of the room, where they could see the television. Most of the peoplein the place talked to imaginary people. At least his mother never did that.Alex folded his arms on the table. “So, what’s new?”His mother chewed a mouthful for a moment. Without looking up she swallowed andsaid under her breath, “I haven’t seen any of them for a while.”“Is that right?” he asked, playing along. “What did they want?”It was hard to make conversation when he didn’t know what she was talking abouthalf the time.“What they always want. The gate.”“What gate?” He couldn’t imagine what she imagined.She suddenly looked up. “What are you doing here?”Alex shrugged. “It’s my birthday, Mom. I wanted to spend it with you.”“You shouldn’t spend your birthday in this place, Alex.”Alex’s breath halted for an instant. He could count on the fingers of one handthe times she had called him by his name except when prompted.“It’s my birthday. It’s what I want to do, Mom,” he said quietly.Her mind seemed to drift away from the subject. “They look at me through thewalls,” she said in an emotionless tone. Her eyes turned wild. “They look atme!” she screamed. “Why won’t they stop watching me!”A few of the people on the other side of the room turned to look at thescreaming woman. Most didn’t bother. Screaming in the institution wasn’t anuncommon occurrence and was usually treated with indifference. The orderly withthe cart glanced over, appraising the situation. Alex put a hand on her arm.“It’s all right, Mom. No one is looking at you now.”She glanced around at the walls before finally appearing to calm down. Inanother moment, she went back to her sandwich as if nothing had happened.After she took a sip of orange juice, she asked, “What birthday is it?” She putthe sandwich up to her mouth.“My twenty-seventh.”She froze.She took the sandwich out of her mouth and carefully set it down on the paperplate. She glanced around, then seized Alex’s shirtsleeve.“I want to go to my room.”Alex was a bit puzzled by her behavior, as he frequently was, but he went along.“All right, Mom. We can sit in there. It’ll be nice, just the two of us.”She held his arm in a tight grip as they walked back down the depressing hall.Alex walked. She shuffled. She wasn’t an old woman, but her spirit always seemedbroken.It was the Thorazine and other powerful antipsychotic drugs that made her thatway, and made her shuffle. Dr. Hoffmann said that Thorazine was all that kepther functioning as well as she did, and that without it she would become soviolently psychopathic that she would have to be restrained twenty-four hours aday. Alex certainly didn’t want that for her.When they went into her simple room she shut the door. The doors didn’t lock.She opened it and checked the hall three times before she seemed satisfied. Herroommate, Agnes, was older. She never spoke. She did stare, though, so Alex wasglad that she had stayed in the sunroom.The TV, bolted high on the wall, was on, but the sound was muted. He rarely sawthe TV turned off. The sound was usually muted, though. He’d never seen hismother change the channel. He didn’t understand why she and Agnes wanted the TVon without the sound.“Go away,” Alex’s mother said.“After a while, Mom. I’d like to sit with you for a time.”She shook her head. “Go away and hide.”“From what, Mom?”“Hide,” she repeated.Alex took a deep breath. “Hide from what?”His mother stared at him for a time. “Twenty-seven,” she finally said.“Yes, that’s right. I’m twenty-seven today. You had me twenty-seven years ago,nine in the evening on the ninth of September. That’s the date today. You had mehere, at this very place, back when it was a regular hospital.”She leaned close and licked her lips. “Hide.”Alex wiped a hand across his face. “From who, Mom?” He was tired of thepointless, circular conversation.His mother rose from where she sat on the edge of the bed and went to a smallwardrobe. She pawed through the items folded on the shelf. After a brief searchshe came up with a shawl. At first, Alex thought that she was cold. But shedidn’t put the shawl around her shoulders.She stood before the small dresser and draped the shawl over the polished metalsquare, bolted to the wall, that served as a mirror.“Mom, what are you doing?”His mother turned back with fire in her eyes. “They look at me. I told you. Theylook at me through the windows in the walls.”Alex was starting to feel creepy.“Mom, come sit down.”His mother sat on the edge of the bed, closer, and took one of his hands in bothof hers. It was an act of affection that unexpectedly brought a tear to Alex’seye. She had never done such a thing before. Alex thought that it was the bestbirthday present he could have gotten, better even than fifty thousand acres ofland.“Alex,” she whispered. “You must run and hide before they get you.”It was startling to hear his name from her lips for the second time in the sameday. It took a great effort to summon his voice.“And who is it that I should hide from, Mom?”She glanced around and then leaned closer so he could hear her whisper.“A different kind of human.”He stared at her a moment. It made no sense, but something about it soundedserious, sounded sincere.Just then something on the TV caught his eye. He looked up and saw that it wasthe local news. A police spokesman was standing before a cluster of microphones.A news crawler moving across the bottom of the screen said “Two Metro officersfound dead.”Alex reached over for the remote and turned up the sound.“Do you know why they were there, in behind the warehouses?” a reporter askedthrough the clamor.“The Center and Ninetieth Street section was within their patrol area,” theofficial said. “Alleys throughout there provide access to loading docks. Wecheck them often, so there was nothing unusual about them being there in thatlocation.”Alex remembered when Ninetieth Street, about ten or twelve miles from his house,used to be the outskirts of town.Another reporter shouted the others down. “There are reports that both officerswere found with their necks broken. Is that true?”“I can’t comment on such stories. As I’ve said, we will have to wait for thecoroner’s report. When we have it we will release the findings.”“Have the families been notified?”The man at the microphone paused, obviously having trouble getting words out.Anguish shaped his features. He kept swallowing back his emotion.“Yes. Our prayers and sympathy go out to their families at this difficult time.”“Can you release their names, then?” a woman waving her pen for attention asked.The official stared out at the tight knot of reporters. His gaze finally droppedaway. “Officer John Tinney, and Officer Peter Slawinski.” He started spellingthe names.Alex’s whole body flashed as cold as ice.“They break people’s necks,” his mother said in a dead tone as she stared at theTV. He thought that she must be repeating what she’d just heard. “They want thegate.”Her eyes went out of focus. He knew; she was going back into that dark place.Once her eyes went out of focus like that she wouldn’t speak again for weeks.He felt his cell phone vibrate in his pocket. Another text message from Bethany.He ignored it as he put an arm tenderly around his mother’s shoulders."},{"pageContent":"7.ALEX SAT FOR A WHILE just holding his mother, trying to imagine what madnesshaunted her. She no longer seemed to know that he was there.The worst part was that he had no hope. The doctors had said that she wouldnever get better, never be her old self again, and that he needed to understandthat. They said there was brain damage that couldn’t be reversed. While theyweren’t exactly sure what had caused the damage to her brain, they said that,among other things, it caused her to sometimes become violent. They said thatsuch damage was not reversible. They’d said that she was a danger to herself andothers and always would be.After a while Alex gently laid her back on her bed. She was as limp as adoll—just a bundle of bone and muscle, blood and organs, existing often withoutconscious awareness, without anything other than a vestigial intellect. Hefluffed up the pillow under her head. Her empty eyes remained fixed on theceiling. As far as Alex knew, she didn’t know where she was, or that there wasanyone there with her. She was for the most part dead to the world; her bodyjust hadn’t fully caught up with that fact.He pulled her shawl off the mirror, folded it, and replaced it in the wardrobebefore sitting again on the edge of the bed.When his phone rang he pulled it out and answered.“Hey, birthday boy,” Bethany said, “I have a big surprise for you.”Alex made an effort to keep the annoyance out of his voice. “Well, I’m afraidthat—”“I’m sitting outside your house.”He paused a moment. “My house.”Her voice turned flirtatious and lilting. “That’s right.”“What are you doing there?”“Well,” she said in an airy, intimate whisper, “I’m waiting for you. I want togive you your birthday present.”“Thanks for the thought, Bethany, but I really don’t need anything, honest. Saveyour money.”“No money involved,” she said. “Just get your tail home, birthday boy. Tonightyou’re going to get yourself laid.”Now Alex was really getting annoyed with her. He thought it easiest not to sayso, though. He didn’t want to have a fight with a woman he hardly knew. Therewas no point to it.“Look, Bethany, I’m really not in the mood.”“You just leave that to me. I’ll get you in the mood. I think you ought to getlucky on your birthday, and I’m just the girl to make it special.”Bethany was an attractive woman—in fact she bordered on being voluptuous—but themore he got to know her the less and less attractive Alex found her to be. Shehad nothing more than a superficial allure. He couldn’t talk to her aboutanything meaningful, not because she wasn’t intelligent enough, but because shedidn’t care about anything meaningful. In a way, that was worse. She was aliving, breathing example of superficial, and willfully so. She seemed to haveno interests other than that she had a kind of odd, narrow focus on him and thetwo of them having a good time—or, at least, what was a good time by herdefinition.“I can’t, right now,” he said, trying not to sound angry, even though he wasgetting angry.She let out a low, breathy chuckle. “Oh, I’ll make sure you can, Alex. Don’t youworry about that. You just get yourself home and let Beth take care ofeverything.”“I’m visiting my mother.”“I think I can throw a better party. Promise. Just come give me a chance to makeyour birthday something you’ll never forget.”“My mother is in the hospital. She’s ill and not doing well. I’m going to besitting with her.”That finally threw Bethany into silence for a moment.“Oh,” she finally said, the sexiness gone from her voice. “I didn’t know.”“I’ll call you later,” Alex said. “Maybe in a few days.”“Well,” she said, sounding uncertain and reluctant to end the conversation soquickly, “I’m sure your mother is going to need to get her rest. Why don’t youcall me later today, after your visit?”Somehow, it didn’t sound quite like a question. It sounded more like aninstruction. He hadn’t wanted to have this conversation—not at the moment, notsitting there with his mother—but Bethany was giving him no choice.“Look, the truth is I don’t think I’m the guy for you. You’re an attractivewoman, you really are. There are a lot of guys who like you. I think you’d bebetter off with one of them instead of me. You’d have a lot more fun with them,with guys who are interested in the same things that interest you.”“But I like you.”“Why?”“I don’t know.” She paused a moment. “You get me hot,” she finally said, fallingback on her lusty voice, as if lust was magic that could banish any objections.He imagined that it very well might with most men, but he wasn’t most men.“I’m sorry, Bethany. You’re a nice enough person, but we’re just not right foreach other. It’s as simple as that.”“I see.”He didn’t say anything, hoping that she would leave it at that and not decide tomake it ugly. It wasn’t like they’d been seeing each other for any length oftime. There was no reason to make a big deal out of it. It had been a couple ofdates, nothing more. He’d kissed her a few times. That was it. She’d made itclear that he was welcome to go farther, to go as far as he wanted, butsomething had made him keep her at arm’s length. Now he was glad he had.“Alex, I’ve got to go. I need . . . I need to think about this.”“I understand. You think about it, but I think it’s best if we go our separateways.”He could hear her breathing for a moment; then, without a further word, she hungup on him.“Good,” he said under his breath as he used his thumb to push the phone backinto the pocket of his jeans.He glanced over at his mother. She stared unblinking at the ceiling.Alex picked up the TV remote when he saw another report about the two murderedMetro officers. The place they’d been found was a good dozen miles from where hehad met Officers Tinney and Slawinski earlier that day.It shook Alex to realize that the two men were dead. If he found it shocking, hecould only imagine how horrifying the news had to be for those close to them.Both men had seemed so competent, so in control. He’d seen them for only a fewminutes, but it seemed impossible to think that both of those men could be dead.The swiftness of such a thing left Alex feeling shaken and even more depressed.He envied people who enjoyed their birthdays.Just then his phone rang again. He was reluctant to answer it, thinking it wouldbe Bethany with a list of grievances over her hurt feelings and wanting to rantat him, but when he checked the small exterior display window it said OUT OFAREA.Alex flipped open the cover and put the phone to his ear. “Hello, this is Alex.”Weird, garbled sounds and disembodied whispers crackled through the receiver.The sounds made his mouth go dry.Alex immediately flipped the cover closed. He stared at the phone a moment, thenfinally slipped it back in his pocket.The sounds had been so unusual, so haunting, that he distinctly rememberedhearing them before. It had been the call he had gotten earlier, just as he hadbeen about to leave his grandfather’s house, just after he had learned about theland that came to be his on his twenty-seventh birthday.He remembered that he’d gotten the call right after he had thought that someonehad been looking at him through the mirror. It had also been shortly after hehad asked if Ben thought he would end up crazy like his mother.Alex glanced at the polished metal mirror before looking around at themint-green room. He wondered if he was destined to end up spending the rest ofhis life in a place like this, like his mother.He wondered how he would know if he had gone crazy. He didn’t feel crazy.He bet that his mother didn’t feel crazy, either."},{"pageContent":"8.WHEN MR. MARTIN CALLED out of the blue, Alex could hardly believe the news. Allsix of his paintings had sold.Holding the phone to an ear with a shoulder, Alex had swirled his brush in a jarof murky water and then wiped it on a paper towel as Mr. Martin asked him tocome collect his money. Alex had been deeply absorbed in the work of painting aneerie evening mist along a shoreline of a mountain lake and didn’t want to stop,but Mr. Martin had seemed unusually anxious that Alex get there as soon aspossible. He wouldn’t say anything about the person who had bought thepaintings, only that they had paid cash and he wanted to give Alex his portion.He had made a weak excuse that he knew Alex needed the money.Alex hadn’t talked to Bethany since she’d called him while he had been visitinghis mother two days before. Things seemed to be looking up in more ways thanone. His truck even started on the first try.When he pulled into the parking lot at Regent Center it was early afternoon. Thegray sky looked to be a harbinger of an approaching storm. The air had anunusual chill to it, a first breath of the coming change of season.Alex parked next to a new Jeep, hoping that his would start again later withouta lot of difficulty. With the sale of the six paintings he could certainlyafford to get the starter fixed. He had thought to replace the starter himselfbut he reconsidered; he would need to finish up the painting he was working onwhen Mr. Martin had called. The gallery would need to have more of his paintingsif the buyer should decide to return and collect more of Alex’s pieces, or ifanother buyer came along. It was far easier to sell paintings and getcommissions if there was something on display.Before he locked his truck, Alex picked the small painting wrapped in brownpaper off the floor of the back seat. He didn’t want to give it back to Mr.Martin to sell or display, but he was afraid of it being stolen out of histruck. He’d brought the painting with him because he wanted to give it to thewoman if he ever saw her again.The halls of Regent Center were more crowded than they had been the last timehe’d been there, the day he had seen the woman. With the painting tucked underhis arm he quickly made his way toward the gallery, checking the faces of peoplealong the way just in case she was there. He thought that it was a baselesshope, even a silly hope, but he couldn’t help himself from hoping to see her.When he caught sight of himself in a mirror displayed in the window of aboutique, he stepped a little quicker to get out of sight of it.As he walked in front of the gallery window Alex spotted Mr. Martin pacing nearthe rear of the shop. He had on a dark suit with a bright orange tie, an oddchoice that on Mr. Martin somehow worked. The bells on the door softly rangtheir familiar strain as Alex went inside. Mr. Martin, dry-washing his hands,stepped briskly among the pieces on easels.“Ah, Alex, thank you for coming so quickly.”“It’s been a while since my last payday,” Alex said with a smile as he tried tofigure out why the man wasn’t smiling.“Indeed,” Mr. Martin said without catching Alex’s attempt to lighten the mood.Alex followed the gallery owner to the rear of the shop, where Mr. Martin sat ona rolling swivel chair and nervously worked a key to open a locked drawer. Oncehe had the drawer open he unlocked a metal box inside and pulled out a thickenvelope. Inside was a stack of cash. He stood to count out the payment.“Wait a minute,” Alex said, holding up a hand. “You usually give me the story,first. I’ve never sold six pieces at once before. It must have been an unusualsale. Who was the buyer? What happened? How did you convince them to buy sixpaintings? Did they just love the paintings and have to have them all?”Mr. Martin gazed into Alex’s eyes for a moment as if overwhelmed by the barrageof questions. Alex realized that he was probably spooking the man. Alexfrequently found that he made people nervous with his questions.“Well,” Mr. Martin said at last, seemingly trying to recall it in exact detail,“a man came in. He glanced around but I soon realized that he wasn’t looking atthe things that were on display—wasn’t looking at different pieces the waypeople usually do. He seemed to be searching for something specific. I asked ifI could show him something special.“He said yes, that he would like to see the work of Alexander Rahl. Naturally Iwas only too happy to show him your paintings.Before I could begin to talk you up, he said that he would take them. I showedhim that I had six of your paintings and asked which of them he would beinterested in. He said he would take them all. I was momentarily stunned.“The man asked how much he owed. He never even asked the price. Just asked whathe owed.”Mr. Martin licked his thin lips. “I was overjoyed for you. I knew how much youneed the money, Alex, so as I regained my wits I took the opportunity, as thegallery owner and your representative, to get the best possible price for you. Iquickly considered the dated, low price we were asking and then, in view of theman’s interest, added some to it.”Alex was slightly amused at his good fortune, and Mr. Martin’s quick thinking.“So how much did you add?”Mr. Martin swallowed. “I doubled the price. I told the man that they were fourthousand apiece—and a good investment in an up-and-coming contemporary artist.”“That’s twenty-four thousand dollars,” Alex said in astonishment. “You certainlyearned your commission, Mr. Martin.”Mr. Martin nodded. “That makes your portion, after commission, fourteen thousandfour hundred dollars.”Without delay he started counting off hundred-dollar bills. Alex was a bitdumbfounded and just stood there as the man counted out the money. Whenfinished, the gallery owner took a deep breath. He seemed to be glad to be ridof the money. Alex straightened the thick stack of hundred-dollar bills beforereturning them to the envelope. He folded it in half and stuffed it all in thefront pocket of his jeans.Alex couldn’t understand why the man seemed so nervous. Mr. Martin often soldpaintings for a great deal more than Alex’s work. One of R. C. Dillion’spaintings would have gone for well over what Alex had just earned for six. Maybeit was just that it had all been in cash.“What then?” Alex asked, his suspicion growing. “Did the man say anything else?”“There’s a little more to the story.” Mr. Martin straightened the orange knot athis throat. “After he had paid—in cash, the same cash I just gave you—he said,‘These are mine, now, right?’ I said, ‘Yes, of course.’“He then picked up one of his paintings, pulled a fat black marker out of hispocket—you know, the indelible kind—and started writing all over the painting. Iwas stunned. I didn’t know what to do. When he had finished, he did the same toeach in turn. Wrote all over them.”Mr. Martin clenched his hands together. “I’ve never had such an experience. Iasked the man what he thought he was doing. He said that they were his paintingsand he could do any damn thing he wanted to with them.”Mr. Martin leaned closer. “Alex, I would have stopped him, I swear I would have,but, well, they were his, and he was very . . . insistent about what he wasdoing. By his change in attitude I was beginning to fear what would happen if Iwere to interfere. So I didn’t. I had the money, after all—cash at that.”Alex stood with his jaw hanging. He was overjoyed to have the money from thesale but at the same time he was incensed to hear that his work had beendefaced.“So he finished marking all over my work and then just took his ruined paintingsand left?”Mr. Martin scratched his jaw, his gaze turning aside. “No. He set them down andsaid that he wanted me to give them back to you. He said, ‘Give them back toAlexander Rahl. My treat.’ ”Alex heaved a sigh. “Let me see them.”Mr. Martin gestured to the paintings sitting against the wall in the corner ofthe office area. They were placed face-to-face, and no longer in frames.When Alex lifted the first one and held it out in both hands he was struckspeechless. In fat black letters sprawled diagonally across the painting it saidFUCK YOU ASSHOLE.The painting was covered with every other hateful, vile, vulgar name there was.“Alex, I want them out of here.”Alex stood, hands trembling, staring at his beautiful painting covered with uglywords.“Do you hear me, Alex? I can’t have these in here. What if a customer shouldhappen to see them? You have to take them with you. Right now. Get them out. Iwant them out of here. I want to forget all about this.”Through his fury Alex could only nod. He knew that Mr. Martin didn’t fear acustomer seeing them. Many of Mr. Martin’s artists routinely spoke like this infront of customers. The customers took the artist’s “colorful” speech as anindication of social sensitivity and artistic introspection. The more times anartist could drop the F bomb in a sentence the more visionary he became to them.No, Mr. Martin was not offended by the words—he was used to hearing them in thegallery—he was frightened by the man who had written them, and by the context ofthose words: raw hatred.Mr. Martin cleared his throat. “I’ve been giving the matter a great deal ofthought, and I think it best if for now we don’t display any of your work.”Alex looked up. “What?”Mr. Martin gestured to the painting. “Well, look at it. This kind of man couldget violent. He looked like he was ready to break my neck if I dared lift afinger to stop him.”Alex’s first thought was that it was Bethany’s doing, but he dismissed the idea.He was pretty sure she didn’t have that kind of money to spend on a grudge.“What did this guy look like? Describe him.”“Well,” Mr. Martin said, taken aback a little by the heat in Alex’s tone, “hewas tall, and good size—about like you. He was dressed casually but notexpensively. Tan slacks, some kind of bland shirt, not tucked in. It was beigewith a vertical blue stripe of some sort down the left side.”Alex didn’t recognize the description.He felt sick with anger. He ripped the canvas off the stretcher, then did thesame with the other five. He only briefly saw the insults and obscene wordsdesecrating the scenes of beauty. The range of profanity turned his stomach, notso much because of the words themselves, but because of the naked hate theyconveyed.They were just paintings of beauty. That’s all they were. Something to upliftpeople who looked at them, something to make people feel good about life and theworld they lived in. To harbor hatred for beauty was one thing, but to go togreat expense just to express that hate was quite another.Alex realized that Mr. Martin was right. Such a man could easily become violent.Alex hoped to meet him."},{"pageContent":"9.WITH THE ROLLED - UP RUINED CANVASES under one arm and the painting that he’dcarefully wrapped in brown paper tucked under his other arm, Alex left Mr.Martin’s gallery without an argument. Despite how much he was fuming, therewasn’t any point in arguing. Mr. Martin was afraid.Alex couldn’t really blame the man. Alone as he was most of the time, he was asitting duck in the gallery. The stranger could come back at any time. What wasMr. Martin supposed to do? Alex couldn’t expect the gallery owner to have it inhim to be able to handle an altercation that could become violent.Conflicting emotions raged through Alex’s thoughts as he made his way out intothe elegant halls. He was depressed, he was furious. He wanted to run home andlock himself away from a world where such people roamed free. He wanted to findthe guy and shove the black markers down his throat.When Alex looked up, the woman was standing not far off in front of him,watching him approach. He slowed to a stop.She was in the same black dress, with the same green wrap draped over hershoulders. He thought that he saw wisps of vapor—a hint of steam or smoke—risingfrom her fall of blond hair and her shoulders, but as soon as he focused on it,it was gone.As impossible as it seemed, she looked even better than he remembered.“You come here often?” he asked.Her gaze never left his as she slowly shook her head. “This is only my secondtime here.”Something about the serious set of her features gave him pause. He knew that shewasn’t there to shop.His grandfather’s old mantra, Trouble will find you, echoed through his mind.“Are you all right, Alex?” she asked.“Sure.” The sound of her voice made him all right. “You know my name, but Idon’t know yours.”A small smile softened her features as she glided a step closer. “I am Jax.”Her name was as unusual as everything else about her. He could hardly believethat he was really seeing her again.“I’d give anything to paint you, Jax,” he said under his breath to himself.She smiled at his words, smiled in a way that accepted them as a compliment, butdidn’t reveal her view of them or her willingness to be the subject of apainting.He finally pulled his gaze away to check around, to see if anyone was close.“Did you hear the news on the TV?”Her brow twitched. “News? No. What news?”“You remember the other day when we first met out on the street? When that trucknearly ran us over.”“The pirates, as you called them. I remember.”“Well, later that same day those two cops who stopped the truck were founddead.”She stared at him a moment. “Dead?”He nodded. “The news said that both men had been found with their necks broken.”The method of murder registered in her eyes. She let out a long sigh as sheshook her head. “That’s terrible.”Alex suddenly wished he hadn’t started the conversation with grim news. Hegestured to a bench set in among a grouping of large round planters.“Would you sit with me? I’d like to show you something.”She returned the smile and at his bidding sat on the small mahogany bench. Hugesplit-leaf philodendrons created a green roof over the bench. The plantersoverflowing with plants to either side and behind made it resemble a forestretreat for just the two of them. The planters and vegetation blocked them offfrom most but not all of the shoppers strolling the halls.Alex set the rolled-up canvases on the bench to his right, on the side away fromher. He placed the painting on her lap.“What’s this?” she asked.“A gift.”She stared at him a moment, then pulled off the brown paper.She looked genuinely stunned to see the painting. She lifted it reverently inher hands. Her eyes welled up with tears.It took her a moment to find her voice. “Why are you giving me this?”Alex shrugged. “Because I want to. You thought it was beautiful. Not everyonethinks my work is beautiful. You did. I wanted you to have it.”Jax swallowed. “Alex, tell me why you painted this particular place.”“Like I told you before, it’s from my imagination.”“No, it’s not,” she said rather emphatically.He paused momentarily, surprised by her words. “Yes it is. I was merely paintinga scene—”“This is a place near where I live.” She touched a graceful finger to the shadebeneath towering pines. “I’ve spent countless hours sitting in this very place,gazing off at the mountain passes here, and here. The views from this hiddenplace are unparalleled—just as you’ve painted them.”Alex didn’t know what to say. “It’s just a painting of the woods. The woods canlook much the same in one place as another. A species of tree all look prettymuch the same. I’m sure that it simply reminds you of this place you know.”With the edge of a knuckle she wiped a tear from under an eye. “No.” Sheswallowed and then pointed to a spot he clearly recalled painting. For somereason he’d put extra care into the trunk of the tree. “See this notch you putin this tree?” She glanced up at him. “I put that notch there.”“You put it there,” he said in a flat tone.Jax nodded. “I was testing the edge I’d put on my knife. The bark is thickthere. I sliced paper-thin pieces of it to test the edge. Bark is tough, but iseasier on a freshly sharpened blade than other things, like wood, might be.”“And you like to sit at a place like this?”“No, not a place like this place. This place. I like to sit at this place. Thisplace is Shineestay.”“Shineestay? What’s that mean?”“It’s an ancient word that means ‘place of power.’ You have painted that exactplace.” She looked again at the scene and tapped a spot to the side of thesunlit glen. “The only minor difference is that there is a tree, here, near theside of this open area, that you have not painted. This is the exact same spot,except for that one tree that’s missing.”Alex felt goose bumps tickle the nape of his neck. He knew the tree she wastalking about. He had painted it.He had originally painted it exactly where she was pointing, but while it mighthave been right in such a forest, it had been compositionally wrong for thepainting, so he had painted over it. He recalled at the time wondering why he’dpainted it in the first place, since it didn’t fit in the composition. Even ashe looked where Jax was pointing, he could see the faint contour of thebrushstrokes of the tree beneath the paint that now lay over it.Alex was at a loss to explain how it could be the place she knew. “Where is thisplace?”She stared at him a moment. Her voice regained a bit of its distant, detachededge. “Alex, we need to talk. Unfortunately, there is a great deal to say, andlike the last time, I can’t stay long.”“I’m listening.”She glanced at passersby. “Is there somewhere not far away that’s a little moreprivate?”Alex pointed down the hall. “There’s a restaurant down there that’s nice. Thelunch rush is over, so it would be quiet and more private. How about if I buyyou lunch and you can tell me what you have the time to tell me?”She pressed her lips tightly together a moment as she considered the place he’dpointed out. “All right.” He wondered why she was being so cautious. Maybe shehad a grandfather like Ben.As they stood, she held the painting tightly to herself. “Thank you for this,Alex. You can’t possibly know what this means to me. This is one of my favoriteplaces. I go there because it’s beautiful.”He bowed his head at her kind words. “I painted it because it’s beautiful. Thatyou like it is a greater reward for me than you could know.”He still wanted to know how he could have painted a place she knew, a place sheknew so well, but he sensed the tension in her posture and decided to go easy.She’d said that she wanted to explain things, so he thought it best if he didn’tintimidate her out of wanting to do so.Alex picked up the rolled canvases and then tucked them under an arm as theystarted down the hall.“How did you come by the name Jax?”She brightened, almost laughed, at the question. “It’s a game. You toss jax onthe ground, throw a ball up in the air, and then try to pick up the jax andcatch the ball in the same hand after it bounces once. It’s a simple child’sgame but as you try for ever more jax it requires a sharp eye and quick hands.Certain people were amazed at how quick I am with my hands, so my parents namedme Jax.”Alex frowned as he tried to reconcile the story. “But when you were born youcouldn’t have played anything yet. A kid has to be, what, five to ten years oldbefore they can play that kind of game? How could your parents know you weregoing to be quick with your hands when you were just born?”She stared straight ahead as she walked. “Prophecy.”Alex blinked. “What?”“A prophet told them about me before I was born, told them how everyone would beamazed at how quick I would be with my hands, how it would first be noticedbecause I would be a natural at the game of jax. That’s why they named me Jax.”Alex wondered what kind of weird religion her parents belonged to that put thatmuch stock in the words of prophets. He thought that if her parents expected herto be quick with her hands then they would encourage her to practice and as aresult she would end up quick. He wanted to say so, to say a lot of things, aska lot of questions, but a growing sense of caution reminded him to take it easyand let her tell her own story. So he kept his questions on the light side.“But Jack, like in jacks, is a boy’s name.”“The boy’s name Jack is spelled with a k. My name is spelled with an x. J-A-Xcomes from the game of jax, not the boy’s name.”“But the game is called jacks, J-A-C-K-S.”“Not where I come from,” she said.“Where’s that?”“You wouldn’t know it,” she said after a moment. “It’s a long way from here.”For some reason she had avoided answering his question, but he let it go.As they strolled down the hall he watched her out of the corner of his eye. Heoften watched people, studied their posture, their natural way of moving, theirattitude expressed through the way they carried themselves, to help himaccurately paint the human form.Most people when in public conveyed either a casual or a businesslike attitude.People were often focused on the place they were headed, never really aware ofanything along the way. That tunnel vision affected the way they moved. Thoseprojecting a businesslike attitude held their bodies tight. Others, beingself-absorbed and out of touch with their surroundings, moved in a looserfashion. Most people were self-absorbed, unaware of who was around them or ofany potential threat, and their body language betrayed that fact. In some casesthat casual attitude drew dangerous attention. It was what predators looked for.Most people never consciously considered the reality that bad things happened,that there were those who would harm them. They simply had never encounteredsuch situations and didn’t believe it could happen to them. They were willfullyoblivious.Jax moved in a different way. Her form, unlike the tight businesslike posture,carried tension, like a spring that was always kept tight, yet she moved withgrace. She carried herself with confidence, aware of everything around her. Insome ways it reminded him of the way a predator moved. Through small clues inher posture she projected an aura of cool composure that bordered onintimidating. This was not a woman whom most men would approach lightly.In fact, that awareness was what he found the most riveting. She watched thepeople moving through the halls—every one of them—without always lookingdirectly at them. She kept track of them out of the corner of her eye, measuringeach, checking each one as if for distance and potential threat.“Are you looking for anyone in particular?” he asked.Absorbed in thoughts of her own, she said, “Yes.”“Who?”“A different kind of human.”In an instant Alex yanked her around a corner and slammed her up against thewall. He hadn’t intended to be so rough about it, but the shock of hearing thosewords tripped something within him and he acted.“What did you say?” he asked through gritted teeth.He held her left arm with his right hand. The painting was pressed between them.His left forearm lay across her throat, his hand gripping her dress at heropposite shoulder. If he were to push, he could crush her windpipe.She stared unflinching into his eyes. “I said I was looking for a different kindof human. Now, I suggest that you think better of what you’re doing andcarefully let go of me. Don’t move too fast or you’ll get your throat cut andI’d hate to have to do that. I’m on your side, Alex.”Alex frowned and then, when she pushed just a little, realized that she wasindeed holding the point of a knife to the underside of his chin. He didn’t knowwhere the knife had come from. He didn’t know how she had gotten it there sofast. But he did know that she wasn’t kidding.He also didn’t know which of them would beat the other if it came down to it. Hewas fast, too. But it was not, and had not been, his intent to hurt her—merelyto restrain her.He slowly started to release his hold on her. “My mother said the same thing tome a few days ago.”“So?”“She’s confined to a mental institution. When I visited her she told me that Imust run and hide before they get me. When I asked her who it was that wastrying to get me, she said ‘a different kind of human.’ Then the report came onabout those two officers being murdered. It said they were found with theirnecks broken. My mother said, ‘They break people’s necks.’ Then she retreatedinto that faraway world of hers. She hasn’t spoken since. She won’t speak againfor weeks.”Jax squeezed his arm sympathetically. “I’m sorry about your mother, Alex.”He glanced around to see if anyone was paying attention to them. No one was.People probably assumed that they were two lovers whispering sweet nothings toeach other.His blood was up and, despite her calming voice and her gentle touch, he washaving trouble coming back down. He made himself unclench his jaw.Something between them had just changed, changed in a deadly serious way. He wassure that she felt it as well.“I want to know how it is that you said the very same thing my crazy mothersaid. I want you to tell me that.”From mere inches away she gazed into his eyes. “That’s why I’m here, Alex.”"},{"pageContent":"10.THE DOOR TO THE REGENT GRILL, covered in tufted black leather, closed silentlybehind them. There were no windows in the murky inner sanctum of the restaurant.The hostess, a pixie of a woman with an airy scarf flowing out behind, led themto a quiet niche that Alex requested. With the exception of two older women outin the center of the room, under a broad but dimly lit cylindrical chandelier,the restaurant was empty of patrons.Empty or not, Alex didn’t want his back to the room. He got the distinct feelingthat Jax didn’t, either.They both slid into the booth, sitting side by side, with their backs to thewall.The padded, upholstered walls covered with gold fabric, the plush chairs, themottled blue carpets, and the ivory tablecloths made the restaurant a quiet,intimate retreat. The location in back felt safe in its seclusion.After the hostess set the menus down and left and the busboy had filled theirwater glasses, Jax again glanced around before speaking.“Look, Alex, this isn’t going to be easy to explain. It’s complex and I don’thave enough time right now to make it all clear for you. You need to trust me.”Alex wasn’t exactly in an indulgent mood. “Why should I trust you?”She smiled a little. “Because I may very well be the only one who can keep youfrom getting your neck broken.”“By who?”She nodded toward the rolled-up canvases on the bench on the far side of him.“By the people who did that to your paintings.”His brow twitched. “How would you know about that?”Her gaze turned down to her folded hands. “We caught a glimpse of him doing it.”“‘We’? What do you mean, we caught a glimpse of him doing it?”“We were trying to look through the mirror in Mr. Martin’s gallery. We weretrying to find you.”“Where were you when you were ‘looking’ through the mirror?”“Please, Alex, would you just listen? I don’t have the time to explain a hundreddifferent complicated details. Please?”Alex let out a deep breath and relented. “All right.”“I know that the things I’m telling you might sound impossible, but I swear thatI’m telling you the truth. Don’t close your mind to what is beyond your presentunderstanding. People sometimes invent or discover things that expand theirknowledge so that they accept as possible what only the day before they hadthought was impossible. This is something like that.”“You mean like how people used to think that no one would ever be able to carryaround a tiny little phone without it having to be connected to wires.”She looked a little confused by the analogy. “I suppose so.” She turned back tothe subject at hand. “One day I hope I can help you better grasp the reality ofthe situation. For now, please try to keep an open mind.”Alex slowly twirled the stem of the water glass between his thumb and firstfinger, watching the ice remain still in place as the glass spun. “So, you weresaying how you were looking for me.”Jax nodded. “I knew that you had a connection to the gallery. It’s how I knewwhere you were today. I had to hurry if I was to catch you. Because we had tohurry we couldn’t prepare properly and as a consequence I don’t have much timehere.”Alex wiped a hand across his face. He was starting to feel like maybe he wasbeing played for a fool. “You need a room with my mother.”“You think this is some kind of joke?” She looked up at him with fieryintensity. “You have no idea how hard this is for me. You have no idea thethings I’ve been through—the chances I’ve had to take to come here.”She clenched her jaw and swallowed, trying to keep her voice under control.“This isn’t a joke, Alex. You have no idea how afraid I am, how lost I feelhere, how alone, how terrified.”“I’m sorry, Jax.” Alex looked away from the pain in her brown eyes and took asip of water. “But you’re not alone. Tell me what’s going on?”She let out a calming breath. “I’ll do my best, but you have to understand thatfor now I simply can’t tell you everything. It isn’t just that I don’t have thetime to explain it all right now, it’s also that you aren’t yet ready to hear itall. Worse, we’re in the dark about a lot of it ourselves.”“Who is this ‘we’ you keep mentioning?”She turned cautious. “Friends of mine.”“Friends.”She nodded. “We’ve been working for years, trying for years to figure some of itout. They helped get me here.”“Get here from where?”She looked away and said simply, “From where I live.”Alex didn’t like her evasive answer, but he decided that there was no harm injust letting it play out for the moment.“Go on.”“We finally came to a point where we thought it would work, so despite the riskwe attempted it, but we don’t yet know how to make it work reliably. Not likethe others do.”“You mean work to get here, to where I live, from where you live?”“That’s right.”“What would have happened if you hadn’t gotten it right, if it didn’t ‘work’?”She stared into his eyes for a long moment. “Then I would have been lost for alleternity in a very bad place.”Alex could tell by the tension in her expression how real the peril was—to her,at least—and how much the thought of failure frightened her. Considering thatthis woman was not easily intimidated, that in and of itself gave him pause.He was about to again ask who the others on her team were when a waitress cameup to the table and smiled warmly. “Can I get you two something to drink? Maybea glass of wine?”“I could really use some hot tea,” Jax said.The tone of that simple request revealed how weary she was, and how close shewas to her wits’ end.“I’m fine with water. The lady doesn’t have a lot of time, though.Maybe we could order?” He turned to Jax as he picked up a menu. “What would youlike? Chicken? Beef? A salad?”“I doesn’t matter. Whatever you’re having is fine.”It was clear that she didn’t care about food, so Alex ordered two chickensalads.As the waitress left, Alex’s phone rang. He reflexively asked Jax to excuse hima moment as he pulled the phone out of his pocket.“Hello, this is Alex.”He’d thought that maybe it was Mr. Martin calling to say that he’d changed hismind. Instead, Alex was greeted with garbled noises. He heard a strained,disembodied voice torn by howling that sounded like it said, “She’s there. She’sthere.” Otherworldly whispers and strange, soft moans underlay the cracklingstatic.And then Alex made out his name in the background whispers.Jax leaned in. “What’s wrong?”He was going to flip the cover closed and tell her that it was nothing, but forsome reason he decided that maybe she should hear it. He held the phone up toher ear.She leaned in closer, listening.And then the blood drained from her face.“Dear spirits,” she whispered to herself, “they know I’m here.”“What?” Alex asked. “Do you recognize it?”Stricken with alarm, she stared wide-eyed at him as she listened to the sounds.“Make it stop.”Alex took the phone back and closed it.“They’re tracking you with that thing.”“Tracking me?”Her face still ashen, she said, “From the other side.”Alex frowned. “The other side of what?”When she only stared with a haunted look, Alex turned the phone off. Beforeputting it in a pocket, just to be safe, he popped out the battery and put it ina different pocket.The waitress swooped in and set down a cup for Jax and a pot of hot water alongwith a small basket of tea bags.After the waitress left, Jax poured herself some hot water. Her hands weretrembling.For a moment she sat staring at the cup of hot water, as if she expected it todo something. She finally picked up the cup, brought it close, and peered downinto the water. She set the cup back down.Jax nested her hands in her lap. Her brow wrinkled as she fought back tears.“What’s wrong?” he asked.For a woman who had the presence of mind to put a knife to his throat when hehad unexpectedly shoved her up against the wall, she seemed pretty shaken.“How do you make the tea work?” she asked in a broken voice on the ragged edgeof control.Alex was baffled. “Make the tea work? What do you mean?”“I never imagined how hard this would be,” she said, more to herself than him.“The tea?”She crumpled her napkin in a tight fist as she fought back tears.“Everything.” She swallowed and then with great effort summoned her voice.“Please, Alex. I want some tea, but I don’t know how to work it.”Seeing her genuine distress made his heart hurt. He wouldn’t ever have imaginedthat this woman would let herself be seen as helpless. Something was bringingher to the edge.Alex gently touched his fingers to the back of her hand. “It’s all right, Jax.Don’t let it get to you. We all have days when we’re overwhelmed. It’s no bigdeal. I’ll help you.”He pulled a package of tea from the basket, opened the paper flap, and pulledout the tea bag. He held it up by the square paper at the end of the string.“See? The tea is in here, in the tea bag.” Her gaze tracked the tea bag thewhole way as he lowered it into the cup and draped the string over the edge.“Just let it steep for a little bit and you’ll have tea.”She leaned in and looked down into the cup. As she watched, the water starteddarkening.Jax’s sudden smile banished her tears. Her face took on the look of a child whohad just seen a magic trick for the first time.“That’s how it works? That’s all you have to do?”Alex nodded. “That’s it. You obviously don’t have tea bags where you come from.”She shook her head. “It’s very different here.”“You like it better where you live, don’t you?”She considered the question only briefly. “Yes. It’s home. Despite the trouble,it’s home. I think you would like it there, too.”“What makes you think that?”She reached over and trailed her fingers tenderly across the painting. “Youpaint such places. You paint beauty.” She looked back up at him. “This will helpme convince the others.”“Convince them of what?”“Convince them to trust my choices.”“Who are these others, Jax?”“Others something like me.”“They live in this other place? Where you live?”“Yes. Do you remember the two men when you first saw me?” she asked, seeminglychanging the subject. “The two that the authorities stopped?”Alex nodded. “The pirates. Do you know who they were?”“Yes. They were a different kind of human. Different from you. Different fromyour mother. Among other things, they will break the necks of anyone who gets intheir way. Those are the people your mother feared.”“What do you mean they—”The waitress appeared with two plates. “I had them put a rush on it, since youhaven’t much time.”“Thank you,” Jax said with a sincere smile.After the waitress had hurried off to her work, Alex went back to his questions.“What do you mean—”“Do I have to do anything to this so that I can eat it?” Jax looked up from thesalad. “Is there anything I need to do first?”Alex held up a fork. “No. Just dig in.” He stabbed a piece of chicken with thefork. “The chicken is cut up so you don’t even have to use a knife.” He realizedthat if a knife was needed she would have that knack down pat.He ate the bite to demonstrate.She smiled. “Thank you, Alex, for being patient. For understanding that patienceis needed in this.”If she only knew how impatient he was, but he didn’t want to spook her.“Why?”“Because if I were to tell you everything right now you wouldn’t believe me, andyou need to believe me. But, on the other hand, time is slipping through myfingers, so I have to tell you at least some of it.”Alex almost smiled at the curious dance they were doing, both trying not tospook the other.“Jax, how did my mother know those things—know about a different kind of human,about men who break people’s necks?”“I think in part because we tried to warn her.”“About what?”“That people were hunting her. But we couldn’t get here, yet. The others could.They’ve been coming here for some time now. We tried to warn her throughmirrors, but they apparently got to her. We tried to warn you, too.”The hair on the backs of Alex’s arms stood up on end.“My grandfather showed me some papers about an inheritance. Does that haveanything to do with these other people you tried to warn my mother about?”She stared down at her plate for a time before answering. “All we know at themoment is that there are some very dangerous people who are up to something. Wehaven’t yet managed to fit the pieces together.”Alex wanted a better answer. “My grandfather said that the inheritance wassupposed to go to my father on his twenty-seventh birthday, but since he diedbefore then it was reassigned to my mother. She had to be put in an asylumbefore the inheritance could go to her on her twenty-seventh birthday. It seemslogical that this inheritance might be connected with what happened to her.”“I don’t know, but it’s possible. I’m sorry we weren’t able to help her, Alex.I’m sorry your family has had such trouble.”Alex ate silently for a moment. “My grandfather, Ben, says that he thinks thatthe whole troublesome matter has something to do with the seven—the seven intwenty-seven.”“The seven?” She looked incredulous. “That’s just crazy.”“That’s what I thought.”She shook her head to herself. “The seven. How could he ever come up withsomething like that? It’s the nine.”Alex’s forkful of chicken paused on the way to his mouth.“What?”“It’s the nine. It’s not the seven in twenty-seven—it’s the nine. Two plusseven. Nine. Nines are triggers.”“That doesn’t make sense. I was nine, once. My father was. My mother was. Wewere all eighteen. The one plus the eight in eighteen equals nine, just like thetwo plus the seven in twenty-seven equals nine.”Alex couldn’t believe he was arguing such a point.Jax was shaking her head. “Yes, but the nine and the eighteen are the first andsecond occurrence of a nine. Twenty-seven is the third nine. It’s the thirdthat’s important.”Alex stared at her. “The third nine.”She nodded. “That’s right. Threes are pivotal numbers—spells of threes andsuch.”Alex blinked in disbelief. “Spells of—”“Three is a base component of nine. The multiplying element.” Jax gestured withher fork, as if to imply that it was self-evident. “That’s why twenty-seven iskey: it’s the third nine. It’s called the Law of Nines.”“The Law of Nines,” Alex repeated as he stared. “You’ve got to be kidding.”“It’s easier than tea.”“Somehow, I don’t think so,” Alex said.The woman believed in numerology. Alex thought that Ben should be the onesitting there having such a conversation.Alex couldn’t believe that a number could have any kind of real meaning. Athought came to mind. He almost hated to mention it.“I was born on September ninth. Ninth month, ninth day, at nine in the evening.”“To be precise, you were born at nine minutes after nine.”A chill tickled up between his shoulder blades to the nape of his neck. “How doyou know that?”“We checked.” She took a sip of tea as she watched him over the rim of her cup.“What else do you know about me?”“Well, you don’t remember your dreams.”Alex’s frown deepened. “How in the world would you know that?”“You’re a Rahl.” She shrugged. “Rahl men don’t remember their dreams.”“How do you know about Rahl men? Are there Rahls where you come from?”“No,” she said with a suddenly wistful look. “Where I come from the House ofRahl has long since died out.”“Look, Jax, I’m only getting more confused.” He refrained from using a strongerword than “confused.” “You’re making me think all kinds of things about you thatI’d really rather not think.” He was starting to think that she was crazy—ormaybe that he was. “Why don’t you clear it up for me.”“I’m not from your world,” she said in quiet finality as she looked into hiseyes. “I’m a different kind of human than you.”"},{"pageContent":"11.ALEX STARED FOR A MOMENT. “You mean you’re an alien. From Mars, or something.”Her expression darkened. “I may not know what Mars is, but your tone is all tooclear. This isn’t a joke. I risked my life to come here.”“Risked your life how?”“That isn’t your concern.”“What is my concern?”“That there are people from my world, dangerous people, who are likely to comeafter you for reasons we don’t yet fully understand. I wouldn’t like you to beunprepared.”He wondered how one prepared for people from some other dimension or time ortwilight zone or something—he couldn’t imagine what—who were liable to comelooking for one.Alex tapped his fork on a piece of chicken in his salad as he considered herwords. If there was ever a look that meant business, she was giving it to him.Still, he just couldn’t bring himself to take seriously such talk of peoplecoming from a different world. He wondered yet again if his lifelong worry wascoming to pass: he wondered if he could be going crazy like his mother had. Heknew that she believed things that weren’t real.He pushed the thoughts aside. He wasn’t crazy. Jax was real enough. It actuallymade more sense for him to believe that she was crazy. Yet, despite how absurdher story was, she simply didn’t strike him as crazy.Even if he couldn’t believe that this woman was from some other world, somethingseemed to be going on, and it was serious. Deadly serious, if he was to believeher.He wanted to ask her exactly how she had traveled from this other world, but heinstead checked his tone and started over. “I’m listening.”She took a sip of tea. “Someone is meddling.”“With my family?”“Yes.”“Why?”“Most likely because you’re a Rahl. We believe that unless you have children youwill be the last in the Rahl bloodline.”“And you think someone is interested in the Rahls?”“If I had to guess I’d say that they may have killed your father to prevent himfrom getting to his twenty-seventh birthday.”“My father died in a car accident. He wasn’t murdered.”“Maybe not.” Jax arched an eyebrow. “But if you had been run down the other daydon’t you suppose it would have looked like an accident?”“Are you saying that was intentional? That those men were trying to kill me?Why?”She leaned back and sighed as she dismissed the suggestion with a flick of herhand. “I’m only saying that if they had been trying to kill you it would havelooked like an accident, don’t you think?”He stabbed a piece of chicken as he recalled the murderous look the bearded manhad given him. He looked up at her. She was watching him again.“Why are these people so interested in the Rahl bloodline?”“We’re not entirely sure, yet. Like I said, we don’t fully understand theirreasons or what is going on.”She seemed not to be sure about a lot of things. Alex didn’t know if he believedthat she was as in the dark as she claimed, but he decided that since she chosenot to tell him yet she must have her reasons, so he let it go.Jax sat back a little as she went on. “When I was but a child, a few peoplestarted to get an inkling that something was going on, something nefarious. Theydug into things, followed people, spied on them, and eventually, along the way,as one thing led to another, they found out that your mother was in danger. Theytried to help her. In the end they weren’t able to do so. They didn’t yet knowenough.”“If twenty-seven is so important, what with the Law of Nines and all,” he asked,“then why didn’t these dangerous people do anything to my grandfather, Ben? He’sa Rahl.” There were just too many holes in her story. He gestured with his forkto make his point. “Or, for that matter, why not come after any of the previousgenerations?”“Some of my friends believe that these other people simply weren’t able to gethere yet.”“But you think differently?”Reluctantly, she nodded. “I think that important elements of the prophecyweren’t yet in place. It was too soon. Up until now it had been the wrong time,the wrong Rahl, for the prophecy.”“I don’t believe in fortune-telling.”She shrugged. “It could be that you’re right, that it’s nothing more than somekind of baseless lunatic idea they came up with. They would hardly be the firstgroup of people who acted on a completely deluded idea.”He hadn’t expected her answer. “That’s true enough.”“Whatever their reasons, some time ago they found a way to come here. These arepeople who, in my world, kill for the things they believe in.”Alex again thought about the plumbing truck that had nearly run him down. Hethought about the two dead officers, their necks broken. He remembered hismother saying “They break people’s necks.” He didn’t want to ask the questionfor fear of lending credibility to a subject he didn’t think deserved it, but hecouldn’t help himself.“What is this prophecy?”She glanced around the empty room, checking that no one was near. The two womenhad already paid their check and left. The waitress was at a distant waitstation, her back to them, folding a stack of black napkins for the dinnersetting.Jax leaned in and lowered her voice. “The gist of the prophecy is that onlysomeone from this world has a chance to save our world.”He bit back a sarcastic remark and asked instead, “Save it from what?”“Maybe save it from these people who are coming here to make sure that theprophecy can’t come to pass.”“Sounds like a dog chasing its own tail,” he said.She opened her hands in an empathetic gesture. “For all we know, it could bethat they don’t believe you’re a part of this prophecy. Maybe they wantsomething else from you.”“But you think I’m involved in this in some way.”She laid her fingers on the sunlit place in the painting beside her beforelooking up at him. “You may live in this world, be a part of this world, but youhave links, no matter how insubstantial, to our world. You proved it by paintinga place in my world.”Or so she said. “It could just be a place that resembles it.”She remained mute, but the look she gave him was answer enough.Alex ran his fingers back through his hair. “Your world, my world. Jax, I hopeyou can understand that when all is said and done I can’t really believe whatyou’re telling me.”“I know. I couldn’t believe it when I first came here and saw what looked likehuge metal things floating in the air, or carriages moving without horses, orany of a dozen other things that to me are impossible. It’s not easy for me toreconcile it all in my own head. This will not be easy for you, either, Alex,but I know of no other way if there is to be a chance to save our world.”He felt as if he had just seen a sliver of light through the door she had openeda crack. This was a mission of desperation as far as she was concerned. Shemeant for him to help her save her world.He wasn’t sure if she had intended for him to see that brief glimpse of herpurpose. Rather than try to pry at that door and have her slam it shut in hisface, he asked something else, hoping to put her at ease.“How is your world different from mine? Is it that they don’t have advances likeairplanes, cars, and the technology we have?” Were he not sitting with a womanwho seemed deadly serious, he doubted that he could have asked such questionswith a straight face. “What makes the people there, what makes you, a differentkind of human?”“This is a world without magic,” she said without a trace of humor.“So . . . you mean to imply that there is magic in your world? Real magic?”“Yes.”“And you’ve seen it? Seen real magic.”She studied his eyes for a moment before a slight but intimidating smile grew atthe corners of her mouth.“Among other abilities, I am a sorceress.”“A sorceress who can’t make tea.”“A sorceress who in my world can do a great deal more than make tea.”“But not in this world?”“No,” she finally admitted, her daunting smile fading. “Not in this world. Thisis a world without magic. I have no power here.”He found that to be rather convenient.“So, we come from very different worlds, then.”“Not so different,” Jax said in a way that sounded like it was somehow meant tobe comforting.Alex studied her placid expression. “We don’t have magic. You say your worlddoes. How much different could our worlds be?”“Not so different,” she repeated. “We have magic, but so do you, after afashion. It’s just that it manifests itself in a different way. You do the verysame things we do, if with different methods.”“Like what?”“Well, that thing in your pocket.”“The phone?”She nodded as she leaned back and pulled something out of a pocket near herwaist. She held up a small black book.“This is a journey book. It works much like that phone you get messages on. Likeyour phone, we use this to get messages from people and to convey information toothers. I write in my journey book and through magic the words appear at thesame time in its twin. You say words on your phone device and words come outsomewhere else. I am accustomed to writing messages, not speaking them. But youcan also make your phone device function as a journey book, make words appear init, am I right?”Bethany’s text messages sprang to mind. “Yes, but that’s all done throughtechnology.”She shrugged. “We do the same things you do. You do it by means of technology,we use magic. The words may be different but they do basically the same thing.They both implement intent and that’s all that really matters. They bothaccomplish the same tasks.”“Technology is nothing at all like magic,” Alex insisted.“Technology itself is not what’s important, is it?”“What do you mean?”“Do you really know any better than I do how a phone device works? Can youexplain to me how the message gets from one place to another”—she waggled herfingers across in front of them—“how the words come invisibly through the airand end up here, in the device in your pocket, in a way that you can understandthem? Do you really know what makes all that technology work? Can you explainall the unseeable things that happen, the things that you take for granted?”“I guess not,” he admitted.“Nor can I explain how a journey book works. What’s important is that the peoplehere used their minds to create this technology in order to accomplish theirends, much like those where I come from think up ways to create things usingmagic to accomplish what we need to accomplish. It’s as simple as that. It’ssecond nature to both of us. We both use what has been created. For all youknow, your phone really could work through magic and you would never know thedifference.”“But there are people here who understand the technology and can describeexactly how all of the parts work, how the phone works, how the words appear.”“I know people who can describe exactly how a journey book works. I’ve even satthrough long lectures on the subject, but while I get the general nature of it Istill can’t tell you exactly how to align the fibers within the paper withAdditive and Subtractive elements to give them the sympathetic harmony needed tomake words appear. It’s not my area of expertise. What matters most to me isthat someone somehow did create it and I can use it to help me accomplish thethings I need to do.“We simply say that it works by magic and leave it at that. How it works isn’tso important to me. That it does work is what matters.“If you wish to describe what we do in our world as merely a different form oftechnology rather than use the word ‘magic,’ if that makes it easier for you toaccept, then call it by that name. The name makes no difference.“Magic and technology are merely tools of mankind. If you called that phone amagic talking box, would you use it any differently?”“I concede the point.” Alex gestured. “So, do something. Show me.”She leaned back and slipped the little black book back where she kept it. “Itold you, this is a world without magic. I can’t use magic here. Magic doesn’twork here. Believe me, I wish it did, because it would make this a lot easier.”“I hope you realize how convenient that excuse sounds.”She leaned in again with that deadly serious look she had. “I’m not here toprove anything to you, Alex. I’m here to find out what’s going on so I can tryto stop it. You just happen to be in the middle of it and I’d not like to seeyou get hurt.”That reminded him of what he’d said when he had pulled her back from getting runover by pirate plumbers—that he’d not like to see her get hurt.“A little difficult, isn’t it, if you can’t use your sorceress powers,considering that you don’t know how this world works. I mean, no offense, butyou didn’t even know how to make tea.”“I didn’t come here thinking it would be easy. I came out of desperation. Thereis a saying in our world that sometimes there is magic in acts of desperation.We were desperate.”Alex scratched his temple, unable to contain his sarcasm. “Don’t tell me, thepeople who sent you are sorcerers. A whole coven of sorcerers.”She stared into his eyes for a moment. Tears welled up.“I didn’t risk eternity in the black depths of the underworld to come here forthis.”She set down her napkin, picked up the painting, and stood. “Thank you for thebeautiful painting. I hope you heed my warnings, Alex. Since you don’t seem toneed my help, I’ll attend to other concerns.”She stopped and turned back. “By the way, covens have to do withwitches—thirteen of them—not sorcerers. I’d not like to even contemplatethirteen witch women all together in one place at once. They’re known for theirrather rash temperament. Be glad they can’t get here; they’d simply gut you andbe done with it.”She marched away without a further word.Alex knew that he’d blown it. He’d crossed a line he hadn’t known was there. Ormaybe he crossed a line that he should have known was there. She had wanted himto listen, to try to understand, to trust her. But how could he be expected tobelieve such a preposterous story?The waitress had seen Jax leaving and headed for the table. Alex pulled out ahundred-dollar bill—the only kind of cash he had—threw it on the table, and toldthe waitress to keep the change. It was the biggest tip he’d ever left in hislife. He rushed across the quiet room, weaving among the tables.“Jax, wait. Please?”Without slowing she glided through the door and out into the halls, her blackdress flowing out behind like dark fire.“Jax, I’m sorry. Look, I don’t know anything about it. I admit it. I’m sorry. Ishouldn’t be so flippant—it’s one of my faults—but how would you react if thesituation were reversed, if before today I told you how we make tea?”She ignored his words.“Jax, please, don’t go.”He broke into a trot trying to catch up with her. Without looking back sheturned down a small, dimly lit hall toward a side exit. Long skeins of wavyblond hair trailed out behind her like flags of fury. An exit sign cast the hallin hazy red, otherworldly light.Jax reached the door before he could catch up with her. She stopped abruptly andturned to him in a way that made him stop dead in his tracks. He was almostclose enough to reach out and touch her. Something warned him to stay where hewas.“Do you know the meaning of the name Alexander?”Alex wanted to say something to her, to apologize, to talk her into staying, buthe knew without a doubt that he had better answer her question and no more or hewould cross a line . . . forever.“It means ‘defender of man, warrior.’ ”She smiled to herself just a little. “That’s right. And do you value your name,its meaning?”“Why do you think I sign my work, my passion, ‘Alexander’?”She gazed at him a long moment, her features softening just a bit. “Maybe thereis hope for you. Maybe there is yet hope for all of us.”She abruptly turned and threw open the door. Without looking back she said overher shoulder, “Heed my words, Alexander, defender of man: Trouble will findyou.”Harsh afternoon light flared into the hall, turning her figure into nothing morethan a harsh fragment of silhouette twisting the shafts of light.Alex reached the door just as it slammed shut. He threw it open again and ranout into an empty side parking lot. Trees grew in a green band close to thebuilding. Beyond grassy hillocks waited parked cars that in the flat gray lightof the overcast afternoon no longer looked nearly so lustrous.Jax was nowhere to be seen.Alex stood staring around at the quiet, empty surroundings.She’d been out of his sight for only a few seconds. She couldn’t have been morethan a half-dozen steps ahead of him. It seemed crazy, but she had vanished. Thewoman had just vanished into thin air.Just like she had vanished the last time.He wondered if this was how it had been for his mother."},{"pageContent":"12.ALEX REALIZED THAT it was dark and that he had been driving around in a daze forhours. He found it unnerving that he hadn’t even noticed that it had gottendark.Jax’s final words, her warning, kept echoing in his thoughts. He didn’t know ifshe had meant them literally, or in the way his grandfather always meant them.He was beginning to wonder if his grandfather had always meant more than Alexhad thought. While Ben had the seven wrong—according to Jax—he had been on tosomething, or close to it, anyway.But that was only if the things she had been saying were true. If not, then itmade Ben just the eccentric old man most people believed him to be. But Alexknew him to be a strong and wise man, a man in many ways shaped, perhapshaunted, by his years in special forces, doing only god knew what back beforeAlex had been born.Alex had learned only obliquely, from his parents’ conversations, the shadowyshape of Ben’s history. Alex had on occasion seen medals usually kept out ofsight. Twice he had heard phone calls from men Ben only addressed as “sir.” Benwould smile in that distant way he had and thank the caller for letting himknow. Ben never talked about the things he had done, dismissing them as hispast, as his time away.But he did pass on lessons from those times. Ben thought it was important forAlex to know certain things that few others could teach him. Those lessons spokevolumes about the teacher.Alex again wondered about Jax’s warning, and about Ben’s.Alex didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how to handle such a strangesituation. It just didn’t fit any template he knew of. No one, not even Ben, hadever told him how to handle a person who said they were from a different world.He felt foolish taking such a story seriously, but at the same time he wanted tobelieve her. She had needed him to believe her. He felt trapped in a situationwhere if he believed her he might end up being a fool, a dupe, but if he didn’tbelieve her, and what she was telling him actually was true, then he might endup being responsible for some undefined but terrible consequences.But how could such a story be true? How could he even consider believing such astory about visitors from other worlds? It simply wasn’t possible.Yet his mother had warned him of some of the very same things Jax had tried towarn him about. He couldn’t make that add up. How could he not take such a thingseriously?Jax was the key to finding the truth. More than that, even, it felt to him likeshe was somehow the key to his life.He felt drawn to her in a way he’d never been drawn to anyone else. She was amesmerizing woman. For Alex, her insight and intelligence amplified her beauty.Despite all of her mystery and the strange things she had to say, he feltcomfortable with her, more comfortable than he had ever felt with anyone. Shehad the same inner spark—some way of looking at the world—that he had. He couldsee it in her eyes. He almost felt as if he could look into her eyes and see hersoul laid bare to him.Gloom crushed him for having driven her away.In his mind, he again ran through a speech he would like to make. He would liketo ask her to imagine how she would feel if he were to abruptly show up in herworld and tell her that he talked into a metal device and people anywhere in theworld could hear him. How would she have taken the news if he told her thatpeople in his world flew in metal tubes tens of thousands of feet in the air? Hecouldn’t stop his racing mind from coming up with examples of technology thatshe would surely find impossible to believe. If he had come to her in the wayshe had come to him, would she have believed him?It troubled him somewhat that even thinking of what he might say to her might betaking her story too seriously and falling into some kind of con game.He wanted to tell her so much, to find out so much. Some of the things she’dsaid were just flat too eerily correct to discount, but at the same time herstory was beyond hard to swallow. Other worlds. Who was she trying to fool?There were no other worlds.Did she expect him to believe that some sorcerers had boiled up a magic brew andsomehow beamed her to the Regent Center? And that yet others had placed a callto his phone from a different universe, or planet, or dimension, or something?He wondered why, if her story was so hard to swallow, he had smashed his cellphone.He realized that he needed to talk to her more than any other person in theworld. Or in both worlds, if it really was true.But if it wasn’t true, then what had he seen? What about the things she knew,the things she could tell him that she shouldn’t be able to know. How in theworld could she know that he didn’t remember his dreams? That was just plaincreepy. Was she simply taking a wild stab in the dark? Guessing? After all, alot of people probably didn’t remember their dreams.Or did she really know?Yet again he worried that the whole thing could be some kind of elaborate trick.There were stage magicians, after all, who could make a woman, an elephant, oreven a plane disappear. Even though they made it look completely convincing heknew that such things weren’t real, knew it was all a trick.Alex didn’t like being tricked by magicians. It always struck him as a form ofdishonesty about the nature of reality. Maybe that was why he didn’t like magictricks—and magic, real magic, simply didn’t exist. He’d always felt that realitywas better than magical; it was wondrous. That was part of the reason he nevertired of painting the beauty of the world.But why would Jax try to trick him? What reason would she have for doing such athing? What was there for her to gain?The fifty thousand acres came to mind.He couldn’t stop wondering if it could be some kind of trick to con him out ofthe inheritance. That much land was worth a fortune.She claimed to have watched through a mirror as someone had gone into thegallery and defaced his paintings, but wouldn’t it make more sense that it hadbeen done by someone working with her? It seemed like a lot of money for a con,but if she was really after the land, the cost of the paintings would be apittance in comparison to what they stood to gain if they could somehow trickhim out of a fortune likely to be worth millions.Such a motive easily made more sense than that she had come from some distantworld, that she was a different kind of human, a sorceress with magicalabilities. Who was she kidding? A sorceress. What kind of fool did she take himfor? Did she really expect him to believe her?But he did.Against everything, he did. He couldn’t explain why, but he believed her. Therewas something about her that struck him as not only sincere but desperate.Either she had to be the best con artist ever born, or she really was adifferent kind of human from a different world. He couldn’t imagine how it couldbe anything other than a trick or the truth. It came down to one of those twochoices, and that was what was driving him crazy.If she really was telling him the truth, then maybe his father, who had died ina car accident, had really been murdered and his mother’s brain damage wasn’tanything natural, like a stroke, as the doctors had thought. If Jax really wastelling the truth, that meant that there really was something going on,something deadly serious.But instead of telling her that he believed her, or at least listeningrespectfully, he’d chased her away. He desperately wished he hadn’t done that,but he hadn’t been able to help himself.Maybe he’d just been afraid of being a sucker, of being the dupe of a beautifulwoman. Wasn’t that how con artists worked? Use a beautiful woman to lull a guyinto believing anything, doing anything?But he did believe her.Right then, more than anything, lacking Jax, Alex decided that he needed to talkto Ben. His grandfather, strange as he could sometimes be, seemed like the rightperson to help unravel what had become a tight knot of doubts.Alex smiled at the thought of explaining that it wasn’t the seven intwenty-seven, but the nine, a number powered by threes, that was really what wasimportant. His grandfather would be astounded. His grandfather would take suchtalk seriously. His grandfather might even be able to put it all into some kindof context that made sense.As Alex turned onto Atlantic Street, headed home, he saw a red glow in the sky.Within a few blocks it became clear that it was a fire. A house in the distancewas burning. A red glow lit billowing black smoke.He soon realized that the blaze was in the direction of his house. Alex grippedthe steering wheel tighter and tighter the closer he got to home. Could someonefrom this other world already be trying to cause him trouble, maybe even killhim? He sped up, suddenly eager to get home, hoping that it wasn’t his housethat was burning—there were valuable paintings there. Valuable to him, anyway.When he spotted flashing lights in the rearview mirror he pulled over. Anambulance raced past. He suddenly felt guilty worrying about mere paintings andhoped no one was hurt in a fire. He couldn’t imagine the horror of being burned.His heart in his throat, Alex pulled around the corner, accelerating up thestreet, past houses with lights all on and people standing out in their yardslooking toward the blaze.With a jolt, he realized that it was his grandfather’s house that was burning.Alex slammed on the brakes as he pulled to the side of the street and parkedcrookedly at the curb. Cars with onlookers had parked to watch.Fire trucks crowded the street, all parked at cockeyed angles. Amber lights onthe fire trucks strobed the night. A police car, blue lights flashing, wasparked crossways, blocking traffic.Alex set the brake and leaped out. He ran with all his strength toward hisgrandfather’s house. His vision narrowed down until all he saw was the familiarhome engulfed in a terrifying glow of yellow and orange flames. He didn’t evensee all the firefighters in heavy yellow coats and helmets striped withreflective tape. Panic powered his legs as he ran.An arm suddenly hooked him around the middle, spinning him around, stopping himcold. He pushed at the arms that came around and encircled him.“Let me go! It’s my grandfather’s house! Let me go!”“Hold on there,” a big cop said. “You can’t get any closer.”“I have to! We have to get him out!”Two firemen stepped in around him.“He’s already out, son,” the older man said.Alex stared at him. “He is?” He looked around as the cop finally released him.“Where is he?”The senior fireman put an arm around Alex’s shoulders and walked him toward oneof the two ambulances. All the flashing lights up and down the street made thescene seem surreal, otherworldly. One red-and-white ambulance was parked, allits doors closed. The back doors of the other were spread wide. Paramedics stoodaround, not looking at all in a hurry.Even at a distance the heat was so intense that it hurt the side of Alex’s face.Acrid smoke burned his throat. Hoses snaked all over the street. Streamers ofwater arced off into the furnace of flame. It was easy to see that there wasshortly going to be nothing left of his grandfather’s house.As they got closer, Alex saw a gurney with the slight form of what might havebeen a body entirely covered in a gray blanket. Two paramedics stood over it onthe far side.“I’m sorry,” the man holding Alex’s shoulders said as they approached. “He waslong gone when we got in there.”Alex stood staring at the gurney. He ran the words through his mind again, andthen again. They didn’t seem real.“He’s dead? Ben is dead?”“I’m afraid so. From the looks of it, the fire started downstairs in a workshop.That’s where we found the gentleman. One of my men looked in the basement doorand spotted him reflected in a mirror. He was on the floor not far to the side.There wasn’t much left of him by then but we were at least able to use the hosesto cool the doorway enough to manage to recover his remains. I’m sorry, son.”“I’m his only family,” Alex said in a distant voice, somehow feeling that it allcouldn’t be real. “The only family left. I always told him to be careful withtorches and soldering irons down there.”“It very well may be that he passed on from a heart attack or stroke and thensomething hot left unattended started the fire. I’ve seen it happen that waywith older people.”“But he was burned?”“I’m afraid so, but it’s very possible that it was after he was already gone. Wedon’t know yet.”“Ben,” Alex said in a tearful voice as he knelt beside the remains covered in agray blanket, “please don’t leave me like this. I need you so much right now.”It felt like the world was falling in on him.Some of the rafters gave way and the entire roof came crashing down. Huge flamesroared up into the air. Columns of sparks and billowing smoke lifted into thenight sky.Alex laid an arm over his grandfather and broke down in tears."},{"pageContent":"13.THE CORONER’S OFFICE HAD BENN unable to determine the actual cause of death.They said that the remains were too badly burned to make that determination, butthat since he had been found on the floor down in his workshop, rather than inbed, it was improbable that Alex’s grandfather had been overcome by smoke in hissleep. The fire extinguisher, hanging nearby on the foundation wall, was chargedand in working order, but it hadn’t been used. There was an exit door not faraway.Considering those factors and the lack of any evidence to the contrary, thecoroner’s finding was that Benjamin Rahl had most likely lost consciousness ordied of natural causes before the fire started, and the fire had been the resultof something hot left unattended at his workbench while he was eitherunconscious or already deceased.Alex had his grandfather’s remains cremated. Ben had always said that he didn’twant his corpse rotting in the ground, that he’d rather have the cleanpurification of fire consume his worldly self.Still, considering what had happened, having Ben cremated seemed insensitive.Alex knew, though, that it was what his grandfather had wanted.But more than that, Ben, who Ben was, was gone. The remains were not Ben, not toAlex, anyway. Those remains had been released by the fire to return to theelements of the universe.The house was gone as well. Even much of the foundation had collapsed and whathadn’t was unstable, leaving a hazardous sight. After the fire marshal and theinsurance company adjuster finished their investigation, they had turned theproperty over to Alex. At the city’s insistence Alex had hired a company to haulaway the debris and fill in the hole.Since then, whenever he walked up the street to his grandfather’s place, thejourney felt dreamlike. Even standing there staring at the open gap in theneighborhood, at the smoothed-over lot, he couldn’t believe it. His mind filledin the empty hole with a ghostlike memory of the home. It seemed impossible thatit was all gone—both his grandfather and the house where Alex had been raisedfor the last half of his childhood.In the weeks that followed, that wasn’t all that felt dreamlike. Alex at timeswondered if it was possible that he had imagined Jax.In the beginning, under the choking weight of grief, he hadn’t thought a lotabout her. He lost himself in the routine of his daily workouts. All he couldreally think about was Ben. He had real issues to deal with and there was no oneelse to handle things, no one else to help him.But over time, nagging thoughts of Jax returned. With his mother in a mentalinstitution it was only too easy to imagine that he was falling prey to the samesort of delusional madness that had overcome her. It sometimes felt like thatmadness was lurking just out of sight, ready to smother him, too.He tried hard to keep such fears in perspective, tried hard not to give them anypower over him, tried hard not to let his imagination get the best of him. Yes,his mother was sick, but that didn’t mean that the same thing would happen tohim.His mother hadn’t spoken since his birthday, when she had told him to run andhide, when she had warned him about a different kind of human who broke people’snecks. He worried at times that he’d somehow built upon his mother’s strangewords to come up with Jax and her story—created a delusion of his own.On one hand he knew that it wasn’t possible that he could have imagined Jax, buton the other hand it often seemed easier to believe that he had dreamed her up,much the way he did the scenes he loved painting. He knew, though, that suchthoughts were most likely born of his dejection that she had never tried tocontact him again. He was just beating himself up over having driven her away,just feeling sorry for himself.For a time his desire to believe Jax’s story had been bolstered when he hadspotted a popular science magazine in the store. On the cover had been a starfield strewn with galaxies. The headline read “Our universe and multiplicitytheory; maybe we’re not alone.”That night Alex sat in his quiet house and carefully read the series of articlesrevolving around the possibility of other universes beyond what was called the“Light Horizon,” the term used in Big Bang cosmology to describe the edge of theobservable universe, the farthest distance astronomers could see. Since thelight beyond the Light Horizon had not yet arrived to be seen, it was not knownhow large the universe actually was or what, if anything, might be beyond it.Astrophysicists speculated how the universe, made up of space, time, and matter,might be able to bend back on itself through wormholes so that the most distantparts of the universe would be but a step away. They went further to talk abouthow the universe itself might not be singular, not everything there was, andthat there might be others out beyond. Through theories that touched on blackholes, white holes, dark matter, dark energy, the nonlinear oddities of thespace-time continuum, string theory and superstring theory which suggested asmany as ten dimensions, it was hoped that physicists would eventually be able tocome to understand if and how other universes existed beyond our own.Some astrophysicists postulated that the universe was like a bubble, and theevents that created the bubble of the universe created others, a whole mass ofthem, each bubble a separate universe sparking into existence, growing, andexpanding in a larger mass of universe bubbles. Other scientists believed thatthe universe was in fact like a sheet of time, space, and matter—fourdimensions—floating in a greater void of a fifth dimension along with otheruniverses, other four-dimensional sheets of time, matter, and space.These physicists believed that there were dimensions beyond the four familiardimensions, and that these additional dimensions were membranes that when theytouched threw matter into the four dimensions we know. In other words, createduniverses that floated in this fifth dimension.They even proposed that these other dimensions might be gateways between theuniverses.Alex couldn’t help wonder if Jax had come from one of those places. Perhaps shewasn’t so much from another world as she was from another universe and hadtraveled through a gateway of other dimensions. While it gave him chills toponder the possibilities, he felt in his heart that it was nothing more thandaydreaming, a mere hook upon which to hang his hope that she was real and thatshe had been telling him the truth.He needed her to be telling him the truth, or his entire impression of her, whathe thought of her—her intelligence, her passion for life, her presence—wouldcrumble. He didn’t want to believe she was from another world. How could hebelieve such a story?But if she was lying to him that would be worse.Alex felt trapped in that dilemma, not wanting to believe her story, yet notwanting her to end up being nothing more than a scheming con artist, a liar.But Jax was gone. He didn’t really have any reason to hope that she wouldreturn. Alex knew that he’d missed his chance to ever find out more, to eversolve the riddle.By the time he’d finished reading, it was dark in the house beyond the singlelamp beside his chair. He felt not only alone but lonely in that envelopingdarkness. The information in the articles hadn’t convinced him of anything, ashe had hoped. In fact, in an odd way it only left him feeling more convinced ofthe impossibility of it all. It seemed to him that the physicists were seducingthemselves into ever more grand, fantastical theories. The science, if it reallywas science and not the projection of wishes, was beyond him.As the rhythm of life demanded his attention he increasingly lost interest inthe magazine articles. He had real life to deal with.A week after finally cremating his grandfather, Alex had gone back to painting.At first it had seemed like it was only something to do to try to fill theemptiness. The world felt so quiet, so dead, so sad. It had never seemed thatway before. He had talked to Ben almost every day. In many ways it was Ben whohad made the world all the more alive for him.As time wore on, Alex found that painting at least took his mind to otherplaces, other worlds, and helped him forget his grief. He was alone most of thetime, gone into those worlds that came to life on his canvases, and that suitedhim.He supposed that he could at least find some solace in the fact that Ben had leda full life. He had relished every day he’d had. That was more than most peopleever did. A lot of people merely marked time until a holiday, until they couldgo on vacation, until they could retire, always waiting for their life to begin.Ben never waited. He had lived each day.After a few weeks, when Alex thought that maybe enough time had passed, he hadcalled Mr. Martin to see if he would consider taking some paintings for thegallery. Mr. Martin was apologetic but said that he didn’t feel comfortabledoing so. The man was insistent. Alex saw no point in pushing. It was the way itwas.Rather than dwelling on the problem, Alex decided that he needed to find asolution, so he made the rounds of galleries where he thought he would feelcomfortable showing his work. He finally managed to find one down in the oldmarket district that agreed to take on a few smaller pieces. The shops were lessexpensive there, but they drew a variety of people and within a week the galleryhad managed to sell a small painting for nine hundred dollars. The gallery hadbeen pleased and asked Alex to bring in a few more paintings, one or two alittle larger, so they could try to sell some of his more expensive work.Before the month was out Alex had also contacted Lancaster, Buckman, Fenton, thelaw firm in Boston, and asked if they could see to transferring the title to theland to his name. They assured him that they could handle it and in fact,according to the stipulations in the will, they were the only law firm legallyallowed to handle anything to do with the land.It also turned out that there were hefty legal fees involved if he wanted totake title to the land, but considering the money he had from the six paintingsthat had been defaced at Mr. Martin’s gallery and the settlement check for hisgrandfather’s house due from the insurance company, Alex would have no problemhandling the legal fees. The land would be his and the matter would be settled.He hadn’t yet decided if he wanted to sell the land, but he figured that he hadthe rest of his life to decide. Mr. Fenton from the law firm assured Alex thathe could sell the land to the Daggett Trust at any point should he decide to doso. Alex asked if Mr. Fenton thought they could afford to pay fair market valuefor so much land. The man went out of his way to assure Alex that the DaggettTrust was well funded and would be able to handle such a purchase without anydifficulty.If Alex died without ever deciding to sell, and if he had no heir, the landwould revert to the conservation group without them having to pay a penny, so ina way it made sense to sell the land, because then the money would be his nomatter what happened. But, on the other hand, if he died he wouldn’t be able tospend money from the grave.Mr. Fenton told him that the Daggett Trust had made inquiries, hoping for Alex’sdecision on selling sooner rather than later. Something about it riled Alex andmade him come to a decision. He asked Mr. Fenton to tell the people at the trustthat he was taking title and had every intention of keeping the land. The lawyerhad then gone to great lengths to make certain that Alex understood therestrictions to the deed, and that any violation would result in him losing theland, even after he had title. Alex had assured the man that he understood.Alex was looking forward to the transfer of title being completed. He wanted tospend some time alone in the woods painting. He was warming to the idea of sucha vast place being his, of having a world to explore and call his own.As he sat in his studio listening to the rain beat against the window, herealized that after nearly a month he was finally starting to feel better, toget beyond his grief, to again find satisfaction in his work and at least alittle quiet pleasure in life. He had a new gallery that wanted his work, and hewas starting to think about a trip to Maine to begin to explore the wildernessand fill his mind with impressions to paint.It felt like things were getting back to normal. Things were moving forward. Ina sense, it felt like a new beginning, like his life could at last really begin.Jax, as well, was becoming a distant—if haunting—memory. Whatever the real storywith her was, she hadn’t made any attempt to contact him again. The more timethat passed the more his hopes faded. If she was real, if her story was forreal, she surely would have done something by now. She would have contacted him,sent a message . . . something.He couldn’t be sure that she hadn’t been involved in some scheme with peopletrying to con him. He didn’t think that was true, but the possibility existedand it troubled him.He’d seen no evidence of otherworldly people. In fact, he didn’t like to dwellon her revelations because the whole idea was seeming more absurd with eachpassing day and he didn’t like to think of Jax in such an unflattering light. Hedidn’t like to think of her as playing a part in a con game, but neither did helike to think of her being a wacko who imagined she was from a different planet.Having a mentally ill mother was more than enough craziness for Alex.In the end he didn’t know what to think, so he tried to put thoughts of Jaxaside and devote himself to his painting.Outside, in the blackness, lightning ignited in staccato flashes, giving ghostlyform to the glistening trees. When the wind blew and the lightning strobed andflickered, it made the branches seem to move in abrupt fits, almost as if thetrees were staggering through the inky blackness. At times the rain patteringagainst the window became heavy, turning the soft sound to a low roar. As thenight wore on, the rain at times came down in curtains that swept over the houseas if trying to beat it down and wash it away.The storm suited Alex as he painted mountains with clouds stealing in among thetowering peaks. The thunder brought nature in to him in a visceral way as heworked on the gloom in the forest beneath towering clouds.Near midnight the doorbell rang."},{"pageContent":"14.ALEX FROZE FOR A MOMENT, brush in hand, as the echo of the bell slowly died out.His first thought was to wonder if it was possible that it could be Jax.He quickly discounted the notion. It was foolish to think it was her. But thenhe realized that if by any chance it was her it would be even more foolish tokeep her standing out in the rain.He stuck the brush in the jar of water on the table to the side of his easel andwiped his hands on a towel while rolling back his chair. As he stood areflection caught his eye. He glanced briefly in the mirror across the room torake back his disorderly hair. He didn’t take the time to do any more to cleanup, fearing that if it was Jax she might leave before he got to the door.The only lights on in the house were the ones in his studio. As he ran down thedark hall, his way was lit sufficiently by the flickering flashes of lightning,so he didn’t pause to fumble for switches and instead rounded the turn into thedark living room without slowing. Thunder following each crackling bolt oflightning rumbled through the structure of the house. The rain outside rattledagainst the windows. In the living room the flashes of lightning coming in thetall window threw a glaring slash of light across the hardwood floor.Alex stopped before the door. His heart didn’t. Hope kept it racing.When he took a quick look through the peephole he saw what he hadn’t at allexpected.Bethany stood near the porch light, just in under the overhang and out of therain. She was alone.Standing in the dark living room, Alex’s heart sank. It wasn’t Jax after all. Helet out a heavy sigh.He hadn’t talked to Bethany in weeks. After Jax had warned him that a differentkind of human was tracking him through his phone, he’d smashed it and thrown itin a dumpster at a convenience store. At the time it had made sense.He bought a generic phone from a rack inside the store. It had a differenttelephone number, of course, so he left the new number with his new gallery anda couple of other places that might need to get ahold of him, like Lancaster,Buckman, Fenton. The simple phone was enough to serve his needs. Not one forlong phone conversations, he hadn’t yet even had to buy more minutes.In the case of Bethany, having a new number had been an advantage; she couldn’tcall him or send him text messages. He had thought that if she couldn’t contacthim she would soon forget about him and move on with her life. Apparently, hehad been wrong about that.He could see through the peephole that she was wearing a slinky silver dress cutrather low. The dress was designed to make clear what lay beneath. In Bethany’scase that was near perfection. She was a gorgeous woman, but that was all and itjust wasn’t enough for Alex. There was no substance to support the looks. Therewas nothing about her that inspired Alex to desire her. She seemed to be aliving example of the saying that looks weren’t everything.The only lights on in the house were those in his back studio. The rest of theplace was dark. The thought occurred to him that he could simply not answer thedoor and pretend he wasn’t home.But that would be cowardly, and worse, dishonest.Since he really didn’t want to start up another conversation with her—or worse,get in an argument—he decided he would state his feelings briefly, but clearly.Tell her the truth but keep it short and to the point.Alex pulled open the door to face her.As soon as he did, before he could open his mouth to say a word, Bethany liftedher arm, pointed a gun at his chest, and pulled the trigger."},{"pageContent":"15.BEFORE ALEX WAS ABLE TO DODGE more than a few inches to the side, the gun wentoff.At the same time that he heard the bang, it felt like a bolt of lightningslammed into him. Instant, overwhelming pain drove out a scream.Every muscle in his body abruptly went rigid. It was all so sudden that hecouldn’t make sense of what was happening. He knew he’d been hit, but hecouldn’t tell where. Paralyzed by a shock of enormous force clamping down onhim, his body wouldn’t respond to his wishes.Alex toppled backward. Try as he might, he couldn’t even lift an arm to breakhis fall. Somehow, it didn’t seem to matter.As he fell back he saw twin coils of fine wire unspool from the gun.It wasn’t a regular gun, he realized, but a Taser. As he shuddered under thegrip of the pain, it seemed that it might as well have been a regular gun. Hewas surprised that, despite the agony that made his body unresponsive, his mindworked.Bethany stepped into the room to stand over him.Alex could hear himself screaming in unendurable agony, but he could do nothingother than endure it.He’d had time to move only inches before she’d pulled the trigger. One of thesteel darts had stuck in his left pectoral muscle. At the same time the otherdart, going lower by design in order to spread the electrical charge through thelargest muscle mass, had firmly lodged in his lower abdomen. All his muscles hadcramped iron stiff with all-consuming pain. It felt like a mountain was crushinghim.Regular stun guns caused pain. Because he had no control of his body, he knewthat it wasn’t one of those older models, but one of the newer Shaped Pulsegenerators. The way they interrupted muscle control in addition to causing painwas enough to take down an angry bull. He could hear the snapping, clickingsound of the electrical discharges.There was nothing he wanted more than for the torment to stop.After a five-second eternity, it finally did.When the voltage abruptly cut off, the pain also vanished. When it did, Alex layon his back, panting, trying to recover not just from the physical ordeal butthe sudden shock of it. Mere moments ago he had been absorbed in painting thequiet beauty of a forest scene. Now he was flat on his back, disoriented, tryingto catch his breath, and scared out of his wits.He knew that a Taser could deliver countless hits. He moved his arms a littlejust to make sure he could, but not enough to look threatening. At that point,he didn’t know what Bethany was capable of. He saw that she still had her fingeron the trigger. With the darts already stuck in him, she had but to pull thetrigger to deliver another charge. Until he decided what to do, he thought itbest to do nothing and let her think he wasn’t going to put up a fight.Glaring flashes of lightning illuminated her figure standing over him. When thebright flashes flickered out and the rumble of thunder died away, only the faintlight of the streetlamp off through the rain beyond the open door softly lit thecurving edge of her figure.“Hello, Alex,” she said in a silky voice.Alex thought that she looked remarkably calm. She looked like she had completecontrol and knew it.“Bethany, what do you think . . .”Two big men stepped out of the dark night and through the open doorway into hisliving room. A few cracks of lightning backlit wisps of vapor, like mist risinginto the humid night air off the heat of their hulking forms.Alex didn’t recognize the men, but they certainly looked like a nightmare comeout of such a night. He noticed that, despite the rain, none of the three waswet.“Now, Alex,” Bethany said, “if you know what’s good for you, you’ll be a goodboy and not cause me any trouble—you’ve already caused me enough. If you’regood, I think you will find this far more pleasurable than you ever imagined.”She flashed him a self-satisfied smile. “And I bet you have imagined it oftenenough.”Alex couldn’t make sense of what she was talking about. He wondered if a Tasercould scramble a person’s mind. He didn’t think so. Everything else seemedordered and logical. Up was up, down was down. He recognized her. It was onlywhat she said that didn’t fit into any context.Bethany glanced briefly at the men. “Get him into a bedroom.”Alex couldn’t imagine what in the world Bethany and the two men intended to dowith him. But whatever they intended, he had no illusions that it was going tobe anything other than bad. He wondered if Bethany, in her anger over hisrejection of her, had hired a couple of thugs to beat him senseless.He wondered if it could be something worse than a beating. He wondered if sheintended for them to murder him.Such a vendetta carried to the point of violence would be absurd, but people didabsurd things all the time.Ben had taught him that you had to consider any attacker as having deadlyintent, because once you were dead it was too late to wish you had defendedyourself. Alex knew that if he was to survive he was going to have to use hishead. He knew that he couldn’t afford to wait and hope for an opening.He was going to have to make his own opening before things got any worse. Hecould not afford to be restrained.The men stooped over him at a steep angle to lift him up. Alex feigned limp,groggy compliance. When Bethany glanced briefly toward the back bedroom, heacted.In a sudden and violent burst of motion Alex whipped an arm around one man’shead and used their off-balance weight to pull them both the rest of the wayover. In the same instant that he clamped his forearm around the man’s neck hegrabbed his own wrist to lock his arms tight together and flexed his fist back,bulging the muscle in his forearm against the side of the man’s neck, making themuscle hard in order to help shock the carotid artery.He knew, though, that he wouldn’t have the several seconds needed to bring themove to a lethal conclusion, so instead, as they plunged backward toward thefloor, he planted his foot to break his fall. As the three of them came crashingdown Alex added all his muscle to the man’s falling weight, bringing the man’shead down over his knee as if it were an anvil.The man’s neck snapped over with a loud pop. His muscular bulk immediately wentlimp, sprawling atop Alex’s legs as they both hit the floor. The second manrolled and sprang to his feet.Bethany spun back and pulled the trigger.Alex instantly went rigid again as the voltage from the Taser hit him. Hescreamed under the agony of overpowering pain as his muscles shuddereduncontrollably. The man’s dead weight lay sprawled over his legs, but evenwithout the weight it would have been impossible for Alex to move his arms orlegs the way he wanted, impossible to do anything. Despite monumental effort,his muscles would not respond. The electrical charge was in control of his body.Bethany stepped close. He expected her to launch into an enraged lecture at theleast. Instead, she appeared calm, as if she were accustomed to administeringagony.When the timed voltage from the gun abruptly halted, Alex sagged with a moaningsigh of relief.Bethany gestured to the man with her. He understood and lifted the dead weightof the other man to get him off the coils of wire. Once clear, he let go of theman, allowing him to slump to the side. It wasn’t hard to tell that the man wasdead. From the corner of his eye, Alex watched, gauging the distance to the onestill alive.Alex had thought that the steel darts would pull out in the brief but violentbattle. He was wrong. They were stuck fast.When the dead man had been moved out of the way and safely off the wires,Bethany squatted down beside Alex. Her blond hair, lit by lightning, slippedforward over her shoulders.“If you want to cause me trouble, Alex, I can keep pulling this trigger allnight long. Is that what you’d like?”Focused on trying to find even a fraction-of-a-second opening in which to act,he wasn’t paying close attention to what she’d said. Fast as he could, hereached up to snatch the wire connected to the barb stuck in the left side ofhis chest in order to yank it out.He wasn’t even close to quick enough before she pulled the trigger.Another lightning shock of pain crashed through him. She jammed the Taser downinto his thigh, adding a third electrical contact to make the charge goingthrough him all that much stronger. Despite how desperately he tried to move, toskitter away, it proved impossible. He cried out as tears of pain rolled downhis face. He wanted to draw up into the fetal position. His arms and legsflailed, but not in response to his conscious direction. In that moment, Alexthought that he would do anything to make it stop. When it finally did, hisscreams again trailed off to a groan.“If you want to keep trying to pull out the wires, go ahead, but I guarantee youthat I can pull the trigger faster and I can keep pulling it all night. Is thatwhat you want? I’ve already asked you once, Alex. Do you want me to keep pullingthe trigger?”Alex immediately shook his head. He desperately didn’t want that. The ordealalready had him at the edge of exhaustion. His muscles were aching from therepeated strain. From what he knew of Taser guns sold to law enforcement, theyadvised that several hits were often needed to gain compliance from combativeindividuals.He knew that as long as her attention was on him he wouldn’t be able to movefast enough. Her finger on the trigger would beat any move he could make.She smiled in satisfaction as she patted his cheek. “You look good, Alex. Asgood as I remember. I couldn’t stop thinking of how hot you get me.”At first he thought she couldn’t have said what he’d thought she said, but thesuggestive smile she was giving him told him that he’d heard her right. Alexcouldn’t imagine what crazy scheme she was up to, but he thought he’d betterkeep his mouth shut.“Now, Alex, I want you to be a good boy. If you are, this will all be over soonenough.” She kissed the end of a finger and pressed the finger to his lips.“Don’t worry, I’ll make it good for you. Really, really good. You’re going toenjoy it. I promise.”Alex couldn’t keep from asking. “What are you talking about?” She rested herforearm on her knee as she leaned closer in darkness punctuated occasionallywith the harsh illumination of lightning. She arched an eyebrow. “Why, yourbirthday present, Alex. Don’t you remember what I promised you for yourbirthday? Pretty little Beth always keeps her promises.”"},{"pageContent":"16.THERE WAS A DEAD MAN lying next to him, there was another big man glaringmurderously down at him, and there were two barbed steel Taser probes stuck inthe flesh of his chest and abdomen. Alex couldn’t imagine anything lessconducive to romance.“Bethany, you can’t possibly be serious.”“Oh, but I am,” she said with a wicked little grin. “Now, as I said, if you’dlike I can keep pulling this trigger until you wish you were dead, even if itwon’t actually kill you. Sooner or later, though, the agony will be too much andyou’ll give in. Your other choice is to forgo the drama, accept what is going tohappen one way or another, and just lay back and enjoy yourself.”She arched an eyebrow again. “What’s it going to be, lover boy?”Alex didn’t want to agree, but he was sure that he didn’t want her to pull thattrigger again. When she lifted the stun gun, making a display of waggling it infront of him as she cocked her head in a questioning manner, he reluctantlynodded.“Good boy.” She rose up. “Get him in the bedroom,” she told the man.He reached down with a big hand, seized Alex’s arm, and hauled him to his feet.The man spun Alex around, careful not to get tangled in the wires, and shovedhim in the direction of the bedroom. Bethany warned Alex to keep his hands upand well away from the wires. He didn’t try to stall or protest as they madetheir way down the dark hall. He was sure that any pleas would fall on deafears. She’d already proven that she could pull the trigger faster than he couldsnatch the wires.Brief but bright lightning flashes made his two captives seem to be nothing morethan a procession of garishly lit statues. Whenever the lightning died out theyturned into unseen ghosts pursuing him.As Bethany followed Alex through the bedroom doorway, lightning flickered again.Rain beat against the two windows like a thing alive wanting in.“Nice,” she said, glancing around in the sporadic fits of illumination. “Notwhat I’m used to, but nice.”More distant flashes of lightning lit her again, but less harshly. She reachedout and ran a finger along the metal bedpost as she smiled. “I especially likethe iron bed.”She gestured to the man. He shoved Alex to topple him backward onto the bed. Thewicked steel barbs, still solidly lodged in the meat of his muscles andconnected to the Taser by fine wires, were starting to hurt in earnest.The man pounced on him, straddling his hips, using his weight to hold Alex down.He pulled out some beefy nylon zip ties, pressed one against Alex’s wrist, andthen looped it around a stout piece of the iron headboard. He stuck the looseend through the little ratchet block and pulled it tight enough to cut painfullyinto the flesh. Alex had used such ties before. He knew they could be cutwithout a great deal of difficulty, but pulling on them to try to break themwould accomplish nothing except to cut his wrists down to the bone.The man zip-tied Alex’s other hand to the headboard, then bound both anklestogether and fastened them to the footboard.“Double them up,” Bethany said to the man as she watched Alex’s eyes, “just tobe sure.”Alex fought back rising panic as the man added more ties to both wrists and hisankles. One tie would be impossible to break; more than one was meant toreinforce the message that not only did he have no chance to get away, but thatBethany was the one who dictated his fate.Alex imagined that Bethany intended to torture him in some fashion beforekilling him. He fought back gnawing dread.He could hardly believe that he had just killed a man. He wished he could killthe other one as well. He wished he could get his hands around Bethany’s throat.“That should do it,” the man said. “There’s no way he can break those.”Bethany again waggled her Taser as Alex watched. “Well, just in case he gives meany trouble, I’ll leave the barbs in him. If he doesn’t cooperate . . .” Sheshrugged as she flashed him a meaningful smile.The man stood at ease behind her and folded his arms.Bethany tilted her head, indicating the door. “Why don’t you go wait outside.This is rather private business. I don’t think having you as an audience willhelp him get it up.”Alex wasn’t sure that he’d heard her correctly.“All right,” the man grumbled. “Just don’t be long.”Bethany turned a glare on him in a way that seemed to cause him to shrink aninch. “Who do you think you’re talking to?” she growled through gritted teeth.“How long have I planned, have I worked, have I waited? How dare you presume totell me to rush through it? It takes as long as it takes.“It only matters that I get what I came for. To that end I intend on stayinghere the whole night to be sure that when I leave I leave pregnant.”She planted her fists on her hips and leaned toward the man. “Got it?”“Got it,” the man answered in a contrite tone.“Now, get out. I’ll let you know when I’m done, then you can have your fun withhim. You just wait outside until then.”The man nodded and then pulled a knife from a sheath behind his back. After helicked the blade he gave Alex a grim grin.“When she’s finished with you, then I settle the score for what you did outthere in the other room.”As he left he turned once to glare back over his shoulder at Alex. Bethanywatched through the doorway until the front door slammed behind the man.She turned back, her tone becoming airy again. “Better, lover?”“Why is it better? I still have to look forward to having my throat cut.”“Well,” she said with a shrug, “at least you get me first. You should bethankful that it’s me who found you and not Jax.”Alex’s breath caught with the shock of that name. His mind reeled. Regaining hissenses, he hoped that the flickers of lightning had hidden his reaction. Hethought he ought to help cover his surprise by sending her off topic.“Who’s Jack?”“Not Jack, Jax. Lucky for you I’m the one who found you first—I’ll at least makesure you die with a smile. Jax would simply have bled you out.”“Why? Who is she?”Bethany’s smile ghosted away. “Jax is a diplomatic assassin.”Alex’s brow tightened. “Diplomats are the opposite of assassins.”“No, no, dear boy, she’s an assassin.” Her gaze focused a million miles off. “Avery special assassin, for very special targets.”Alex didn’t want to believe her. But he remembered all too well the way Jax hadpulled a knife on him, remembered how fast she had gotten it to his throat,though she’d had just cause at the time. He had, after all, just slammed her upagainst the wall and had his arm against her throat. He couldn’t really faulther reaction. Still, Bethany’s words gave him pause.“Special targets. What do you mean?” he asked. “What kind of special targets?”“Jax kills those who seek peace.”He finally grasped her meaning. “Like diplomats.”“Among others. She’s a specialist. She is sent after only the most exceptionalindividuals, individuals, like diplomats, who are seeking unity, order, andprefer peaceful resolution to conflict.”In the softer flickers of lightning, Alex could see the distant look inBethany’s eyes, as if she were looking into another world. Dark animus coloredher expression. “She’d love nothing more than to get her blade into me.”Alex said nothing.Bethany’s gaze, along with her smile, returned, almost as if to reassure him.“But she never will. I’m too well protected, even for Jax.”“Why would this very special assassin want to kill you?”What he really wanted to know was what made her think she was so special, butconsidering his circumstances he thought better of phrasing it that way.All the things Jax had told him about being from another world raced around inhis mind, trying to find a proper fit with what Bethany was saying.Bethany ran her fingers through his hair. It almost seemed a deliberate attemptto distract herself from what were obviously troubling thoughts of Jax. “Let’snot worry about such unpleasantness. Let’s just worry about you and me. This isa special night for both of us.”She leaned even closer, trailing a finger along his cheek. Her seductive tonereturned. “Time for what Bethany promised you.”Alex couldn’t see that he had any choice in the matter. He tried to think of away he could get a hand free, but there wasn’t anything within reach of hisfingers. He knew that twisting his hands would accomplish nothing. Even if hetried she would use the Taser to take the fight out of him.A thought he’d had before returned. If she was touching the steel darts when shepulled the trigger, the Taser would do the same to her as it did to him. Hewondered if she knew that. He wondered how he could manage such a thing. Hewondered what it would accomplish even if he could. Nothing, probably.She had it all planned out. She was in control of the situation. When she wasfinished, the man with the knife would have his turn.Bethany unbuckled his belt, then unzipped his pants and started tugging themdown. When she had them down to his knees she smiled wickedly and slunk on allfours up the length of him.Straddling him, she reached around with one hand and unzipped the back of herdress before pulling it off over her head. She wasn’t wearing anythingunderneath. Everything the dress had advertised about what lay beneath thesilver sheath was true.“You spoiled this on your birthday, Alex, and caused me a great deal of trouble.I had to wait another whole moon until the correct time in my cycle came aroundagain.”Things were starting to make sense to him. Crazy sense, but sense.She leaned down to kiss him on the mouth. When he turned his face away shelightly kissed his cheek instead. “But now I’m told that I’m as ready as readycan be. I’ve had experts confirm that tonight’s the night, lucky boy.“Time to make an heir.”"},{"pageContent":"17.BETHANY PRESSED HER NAKED THIGHS tight to either side of him as she leanedforward. She tenderly kissed his neck as he stared up into the darkness. Hefound her tender advances revolting.He was enraged at being bound up and helpless. He was angry with himself forallowing it to get this far. He didn’t know what else he could have done, but heshould have done something. Worse, he didn’t delude himself about what was instore for him when she had finished getting what she wanted. The mental image ofthe big man licking the blade before delivering his threat was not somethingAlex could easily put from his mind.“Are you ready to take our relationship to the next level?” Her intimate whisperin his ear sounded as if she was ready. “Or are you going to need Bethany tohelp get you in the mood?”The situation was so absurd that he couldn’t find words. The only thing he wasin the mood for was breaking her neck.His sense of panic had already melted away under the heat of anger.She leaned forward, pressing herself against him. Her firm breast pushed thesteel barb harpooned into the left side of his chest deeper into the muscle. Itfelt like it was bottoming on rib bone. He gritted his teeth against the stingof pain.As she nibbled his ear, caught up in what she was doing, Alex tried to pullaway, tried to stall. “Bethany, why in the world are you doing this?”“Why in the world.” She laughed softly in his ear. “That’s funny, Alex. Whichworld do you mean?”The magnitude of her words shook him to his core. He wished he had believed Jax.He had thought her story was crazy. Now he wished he had listened to her. Heremembered the last thing she had told him: “Trouble will find you.”It was the last thing his grandfather had told him as well.Alex struggled to focus. “What I mean is, I don’t know why you are doing this,since you can’t seriously think that you’re worthy of bearing my child.”That shocked her into sitting up—not what he had wanted.Her brow tightened. “What?”“You’re hardly suitable. Let’s face it, considering all of your undesirabletraits you’re not really fit to bear a Rahl.”When the illumination of lightning flared in through the window he could see herindignant glower.“Is that right?”“If you weren’t so stupid you’d know it is. My offspring deserves better thanthe likes of you for a mother.”“You arrogant bastard,” she hissed. “You’re wrong. You will give me a child—yourheir—and I will be the one to guide him, not you. After you do this much of itthere will be no further need of you. That child will be devoted to me. Youronly part in his life is that you are going to father him.”He looked up into her eyes. “I’ll see you dead, first. You have my promise onthat.”“How dare you!” When the lightning cracked again he could see that her face hadgone scarlet. “How dare you talk to me that way, you little bastard.”She lifted the Taser in her fist and pulled the trigger.The shock of the high-voltage arc slammed into him. He couldn’t believe how muchit hurt. He flailed helplessly. The zip ties holding his arms ripped into theflesh of his wrists.With Bethany sitting up, her skin wasn’t touching the probes, so she felt noneof it. She glared down at him as he screamed incoherent curses. She wasn’tbothered in the least by his agony. She seemed incapable of empathy.When it finished and he sagged back on the bed, she gave him a moment to recoverbefore leaning over again to whisper in his ear. “We have all night, Alex. Wouldyou like me to pull the trigger a few more times just to get it through thatthick head of yours that I’m going to have my way? I would rather you just givein without all the drama. It really is getting quite tedious, you know.”In the darkness he could feel her belly pushing against the lower probe and herbreast pressed firmly onto the other. When he didn’t argue she writhed a little,rubbing herself against him seductively, as if to show him the benefits of herbetter side. His sweat from the ordeal made her skin slick. She started nibblingon his ear as she got down to business.“You’ve got to be pretty stupid, Bethany, if you think that that fat ass ofyours is ever going to get a guy hot for you. You’re really making a fool ofyourself trying to be sexy, if you want to know the truth of it.”That had the desired effect. She growled in rage and without bothering to sit uppulled the trigger.She didn’t realize that with her flesh touching the steel probes the Taser wouldgive her the same paralyzing shock it gave him.Through his helpless grunts of pain he could hear her cries of terrifiedtorment. He’d known what to expect, at least. He’d known it was coming. Theshock of it was far worse for her because she hadn’t been expecting it.Bethany didn’t know what was happening to her. She screamed not just in pain,but in panic.Alex didn’t think she was all that familiar with technology.In the throes of agony, her arms flailed. Alex heard the Taser hit the floor andbounce a few times. When the five seconds passed and the pain ended, she saggedlimp atop him.He decided that whatever her long-range plan was, he wasn’t going to go alongwillingly. She would just have to pick up the Taser gun and pull the trigger allnight long if that was what she wanted to do, but he wasn’t going to cooperate.As she regained her wits, she pressed a hand against his chest to push herselfupright. With her other hand she swept her hair back off her sweaty face.She looked down into his eyes. “Where I come from, that’s nothing.”“It’s nothing here, either,” he lied.A smile stole its way back onto her face. She lay back down against him, herwarm breath in his ear again.“I know what you’re doing, Alex,” she whispered, “but it isn’t going to work.I’m not falling for your little ploy. I’m not going to let you get me angryenough to cut your throat. I came here to accomplish what needs accomplishingand I intend to see it through.“Be as stubborn as you want, but it won’t do you any good. You’re going to getme pregnant tonight. There isn’t anything you can do about it—it’s just the waymen are made.“Afterwards, I’m going to use a knife on you myself and make sure that youregret every word you said.”In the darkness of the room lit only occasionally by flashes of lightningfiltered through the sheets of rain, Alex felt the gloom of his situation settleback in on him. He had been momentarily euphoric that he had been able to trickher into getting a jolt from the Taser, but what good did it really do him? Hewasn’t going to be able to trick her into it again and he wasn’t going to beable to free himself from his bonds.It might have been satisfying to see her take such a jolt for a change, but itdidn’t stop her. He knew she was going to get even and then some.He turned his gaze off into the darkness as he gave in to despair."},{"pageContent":"18.ALEX THOUGHT OF BEN,and the lessons his grandfather had taught him. Ben had beenin terrible, desperate situations. He had faced death. Those were the kinds ofsituations Alex’s grandfather had wanted to prepare him for. Ben had wanted himto be prepared to face death with resolve, should he ever find himself in such asituation, in order to survive.Ben had framed it in the mantra “Trouble will find you.” It was a way ofreminding him to always be ready, that trouble of any sort could come at anytime. His grandfather had often said that trouble usually came when you werealone. Ben had been right.Alex reminded himself not to give up. Ben had taught him better than that.He decided that if all he could do was to make Bethany angry enough to kill himrather than follow through with her plan, if that was the only success he couldhave, then he was going to take that option. He didn’t have only the choices shehad given him. He didn’t have to abide by her rules.He knew that above all else he could not let her have what she wanted or in theend more people would die. He didn’t know how that would come about, but he wascertain of the eventuality.This was not an absurd battle with a headstrong woman. This wasn’t simply amatter of her wanting his child. This was something much bigger, something sheand the people with her were willing to kill to get. This was something that heknew he couldn’t allow her to win—even if it meant that he had to die to preventit.Jax had come to this world because there was something terribly wrong. She hadsaid that to get here she’d risked being lost in eternal darkness. No one wouldtake such a risk without a powerful reason. This was in some way connected withthe trouble that had so concerned Jax.She had been telling him the truth. If only he had believed her at the time.Bethany impatiently reached down between her legs to grab hold of him. He heldhis breath.“You might as well relax, lover boy. I’m going to have my way and you know it.”He didn’t answer. He focused on how angry it made him that she thought she couldhave her way by trying to get him to give in to lust.To divert his mind from Bethany, from the soft warmth of her, from her insistentattempt to engender that lust, he thought about the night Ben had died.His mind drifted to thoughts about his mother locked away for the rest of herlife in that awful place. She knew something about this, he was sure of it now.Dread of what was going to happen to him when Bethany used a knife on him tomake him regret his words also lurked in the back of his mind. He could imaginelying there with his arms and legs securely restrained as she started cuttinghim. He would be helpless. He knew that Bethany had no empathy for pain.In light of such things, it wasn’t hard to ignore her insincere cooing.“I think I’m actually going to enjoy this,” she whispered in his ear. “Make meenjoy it, Alex.”It wasn’t at all hard to wish her dead.In a distant flickering of lightning he saw her back abruptly arch. The movementcaught his attention because there was something very odd, very unnatural, evenalarming, about the swift, upward curving movement of her naked body and thesudden breath she sucked in.He was about to hurl an insult at her in an effort to take her off track whenanother bolt of lightning crashed to ground not far away. As the harsh lightcoming in through the window fell across Bethany’s face, Alex saw her blue eyesgo wide. Thunder shook the house.Before the light died out he thought he caught the glint of a blade.For an instant he wondered if she had finally had enough of his resistance, ifshe had become enraged enough that she had decided to slaughter him right thenand there in his own bed and be done with it. Visions of her stabbing him as helay restrained and helpless ran in a sudden panic through his mind. Even thoughthere was nothing he could do to stop her, he reflexively tensed for theexpected thrust of a knife slamming down into him.Instead, Bethany’s chin lifted even farther as her neck curved back in line withher arched spine.As the lightning flashed again Alex was stunned to catch just a glimpse of afist holding Bethany’s hair, pulling her head back. The odd, unnatural arch ofBethany’s back and neck suddenly made sense. His immediate thought was that theman had come back in and had decided to take matters into his own hands.A bloody blade swept around in front of Bethany’s throat. It sank in deep as itwas pulled from ear to ear.Gouts of blood from severed arteries pumped out through the horrific gash. Thefist held Bethany’s head back. Her arms flailed weakly as her chest heaved, herbreath bubbling out of the gaping wound with a scream unable to be delivered.Lightning again flared and thunder rumbled. Founts of thick blood running fromthe yawning cut funneled down between Bethany’s breasts. Her hands flexed,clutching weakly at the air to her sides. Her mouth worked as she tried to gaspfor a breath. Bloody froth from her severed windpipe sprayed everywhere.Alex was paralyzed by the sight of this woman in her death throes. The killingwas so grisly it didn’t seem real.When light from the storm ignited in a long fit of flashes he could see Bethanyblinking in confused desperation as she convulsed.Her whole body went limp as her last breath of life gurgled from her failinglungs.The fist holding her by the hair tossed her off the side of the bed. She hit thefloor with a bony thud.In another flash of lightning Alex saw Jax standing before him holding theblood-slicked knife.She was gazing into his eyes as if there was nothing else in the room, nothingelse in existence."},{"pageContent":"19.YOU JUST WOULDN’T BELIEVE how long I’ve wanted to do that,” Jax said in a voicethat sounded better than he remembered, and he remembered it as mesmerizing.Alex wondered if she could have hunted Bethany from another world and followedher to his bedroom in order to catch her without all of her protection.“She mentioned something about that.”In a flicker of lightning he saw a hint of satisfaction curve her mouth.Alex had wanted Bethany dead, and he grasped that she was involved in somethingthat would result in harm to a great many people. She had promised the thug withher that he could cut Alex up, and then changed her mind and decided to do itherself just because he had insulted her. Still, he had never seen anything asgruesome as her death.Jax must have read the look on his face because she addressed his unspokenthought. “Alex, it was quick. What she would have done to you with her knifewould have lasted hours. In the storm no one would have heard you screaming andcrying. She would have enjoyed your suffering.”Alex swallowed and nodded. He was relieved that she had put it in perspective.“Jax—” He glanced to the rain lashing at the window. He turned a puzzled frownon her. “How come you aren’t wet?”“It wasn’t raining where I came from.”He saw wisps of vapor, silhouetted by the flashes of light coming in the window,curling up from her arms and shoulders just as they vanished.The last time he’d seen her she had basically told him that he was on his ownand that she was going to go tend to her own business. She had warned him thattrouble would find him.He wondered why she’d had a change of heart. “What are you doing here?”Her gaze was still locked on his. “We happened across some of what they hadplanned. I got here as fast as I could.”“I’m really glad to see you. I mean, really, really glad.”“Well, since you’re finished with your sick little part in this coupling, pullup your pants and let’s go. We need to get out of here.”“I didn’t take any part in it, and don’t you think that if I could pull my pantsup I would?” When she didn’t answer he signaled with his eyes toward his wrists.“Cut me free. Please?”The thought of what Bethany had told him about Jax crossed his mind. WatchingBethany die in such a brutal fashion left him shaky and sick to his stomach. Inhis whole life he’d never seen anything so horrific. He was covered withsplatters of her blood. Only moments before, her living, breathing body had beenpressed up against him. Now she lay on the floor dead and he was covered only inher blood.With the way Jax was staring at him, he wondered if he might be next.At last withdrawing her gaze from his, she glanced up at his wrists. In flashesof lightning she could see that he was tied to the bed and finally grasped thereality of the situation. She looked back at him and at last smiled just alittle.“Sure.”As she bent close to him to cut the zip ties, distant flickers of lightning lither growing smile. By the nature of it he thought that it revealed how happy shewas about his helpless condition—not because he was helpless, but because ittold her that he was telling her the truth that he hadn’t been a willing part ofit.As she leaned across him to cut the tie on the far side, he caught a hint of herfragrance. It complemented everything else about her.Alex would have given just about anything not to have been this close toBethany. He would have given just about anything to stay this close to Jax.“Thanks for coming, Jax,” he said softly. “I guess I owe you one—in addition toan apology.”She paused to look down into his eyes from only inches away. She was pressedlightly against his chest. He could feel her steady heartbeat.“I’m sorry I couldn’t have gotten here sooner, Alex. I really am.”“You got here in time.”She slowly shook her head. “Not in time to save your grandfather.” Her words hithim like a blow. “You mean that Bethany had something to do with that?”Jax stretched farther to finish cutting his wrist free, then straightened. “Iwasn’t there, but I was able to catch a glimpse through the mirror in hisworkshop. I saw Queen Bethany and I saw fire.”Alex sank back against the bed. He’d buried his grief, but hearing that Ben hadlikely been murdered not only resurrected the anguish, it also awakened asmoldering fury.Ben hadn’t died from natural causes. He would still be alive if not for Bethany.Maybe Ben would still be alive were Alex not somehow involved. But how could hehave avoided being born a Rahl?As Jax cut his ankles free, Alex yanked out the barbs and pulled up his pants.It was a great relief. She had the grace not to make a point of his embarrassingsituation.“Queen Bethany? What do you mean, ‘Queen’?”“In our world she was a queen. A very troublesome queen. She hurt anyone shedidn’t like, and she didn’t like a lot of people. I had to come to this world toget close to her.”Her words caught him by surprise and reignited his sense of caution. He wonderedif he had been part of some grand scheme after all—a scheme to assassinate atroublesome queen. He wondered if he had been nothing more than human bait.“What’s a queen from your world doing in my world?”Jax considered him for a moment. “She apparently had some use for the House ofRahl.”“What use?”Jax arched an eyebrow. “Don’t tell me you didn’t understand what she was intenton doing here tonight in this bed.”“I get that much of it.”Alex reminded himself to cool the heat in his voice. It wasn’t her fault thatBethany had tied him to the bed and intended to kill him after she finishedgetting what she wanted. It wasn’t Jax’s fault that Bethany had murdered Ben.He buckled his belt as he collected his thoughts. This woman had, after all,just saved his life. She could have just as easily let him spend the last fewhours of his life being cut up by Bethany.Somehow Alex couldn’t think of Bethany as a queen. He could barely think of heras an adult.“What I mean is that I don’t know why she had a use for the ‘House of Rahl,’ asyou put it. I don’t know what’s going on.”“We have that in common,” Jax said under her breath as she glanced down atBethany’s corpse lying in a spreading pool of blood."},{"pageContent":"20.ALEX PULLED THE PHONE out of his pocket. “I’d better call the police.”With his thumb he flipped it open. Jax snatched his wrist before he could dial.She used the tip of the bloody knife in her other hand to flip the phone closed.“You’re not going to alert anyone. The last thing we need is the authoritiesgiving us trouble. We already have enough trouble. We need to get out of here,and we need to get out now.”He tried not to take too deep a breath, because the smell of blood was gagginghim. “But the body is going to be found sooner or later. When it is, the policeare going to think that I murdered her. I’ve got her blood all over me.”With a finger and thumb, as if to prove his point, he lifted his blood-soakedshirt away from his body for her to see. He wanted the sodden shirt off of him.He needed to change it. He needed a shower.“If I run it will only make me look guilty. Attractive women who end up dead areusually killed by their husband or some other man in their life. The police willnaturally think that I murdered her.”Jax glanced down at the body. “Did you really think she was attractive?”“Yes—no—” Alex raked his fingers back through his hair. “Yes, she was obviouslyattractive, but no, I wasn’t attracted to her.”“Calm down, Alex.”As he gathered his thoughts he realized that she was right. Calling the policewould be a problem. What was he going to tell them? How could he possiblyexplain it?“How in the world are we going to get rid of her body—and not be found out?”“I’ll take care of it,” Jax said.“There’s blood everywhere!” He swung his arm around at the room. “You can’tpossibly clean up all this mess. The police have ways of finding even thetiniest speck of blood. They have technology that makes blood glow in the darkso that they’ll still find the tiniest specks of blood that you miss no matterhow well you clean it up.”“They’re not going to find any blood, even with their technology.”Alex didn’t think that she grasped how good technology could be or the way itwas going to look to the police. He had dated Bethany. People had seen themtogether. She had been killed in his bedroom. She was naked. What else were thepolice going to think? He certainly couldn’t tell them the truth, and lyingwould only get him in deeper trouble.“Jax, they will find traces of blood, and then what am I going to tell them?That she was from another world? That she wanted to have sex with me so that Iwould get her pregnant with my Rahl heir and then she was going to kill me?They’ll never believe me. I’d be lucky if they thought I was crazy, but theywon’t. They’ll think I murdered her.”Jax gripped his arm. “Calm down, Alex. Let me handle it. I know what I’m doing.”“Let you handle it? In five minutes you’re liable to vanish again.” How could hetell her how much he feared being locked up? “You’ll be gone again and I’ll beleft here alone to handle it.”“Not this time,” she said in a somewhat haunted voice.Alex looked up. “What do you mean?”She gazed into his eyes for a long moment. “If I hadn’t gotten here in time youwould have been lost.”“Lost? You mean I would have been killed when she was finished?”“Yes. I had to get here as fast as possible. I wasn’t able to take certain . . .precautions.”“Precautions?”“I had to forgo the procedures I used before.”“What procedures?”“I didn’t have time to establish a lifeline this time.”“A lifeline . . .” Alex paused a moment. “Do you mean that you can’t get back toyour world?”Her gaze broke away. “Not for now.”He suddenly realized the magnitude of what she had done in order to save hislife. His worry about everything else evaporated in his sudden concern for her.“When will you be able to get back to your home?”“You let me worry about that. For now I’m stuck here.”“For how long?”“Maybe a day or two.”“But maybe longer?”She swallowed. “Maybe forever.”The lightning died out again, plunging the room into gloom lit only by the faintglow of streetlights, but it was enough to see the worry in her eyes.“It’s all right, Jax. You won’t be alone. I’ll help you.”She gestured with her knife to the still body on the floor. When lightningcrackled again a flickering rectangle of light coming in the window fell acrossthe curve of Bethany’s naked hip. “Yes, I can see that you have everything wellin hand.”Despite everything, Alex was able to smile just a little.“Do you think your friends will send anyone to help you?”She shook her head.“Why not?”“Because right now I’m the only one able to undertake such a journey. We’re onour own.”He let out a deep breath. “Jax, I need you to know how sorry I am for the way Itreated you the last time.” He discarded the speech, the excuses, that he’drehearsed in his mind a few hundred times. “You came to help me and I didn’tlisten. I didn’t mean to belittle what you and others have done. I just didn’tunderstand. It was so hard to—”She lifted a hand to keep him from going on. “When I went back the last time Itold people about some of the things I saw here, some of the technology I saw.They reacted much the same way as you. They didn’t believe me, didn’t believethat I had succeeded in coming to this world. Many of them thought I was makingit up to cover failure.“It made me realize just how hard it had to be for you. I suspect that were thesituation reversed and were it you who had come to my world instead, I wouldn’thave believed you, either.“For now let’s both try to be a little more understanding of the gulf betweenus. We need to help each other if we’re to survive what is coming.”Alex didn’t know what was coming, but he nodded. It felt as if a weight had beenlifted from his shoulders, a weight that he’d been carrying since she’d left thelast time.Still, it was profoundly difficult to get his mind around the idea that thiswoman had actually come from another world.“Where is this world of yours? Your home? Is it across the universe? In anotheruniverse? Through some wormhole in space that allows you to step out of yourworld and into mine?”“I can only tell you that the place I come from is on the other side ofdarkness, on the other side of nothing.”“I don’t understand.”“We don’t either.” She lifted a hand in a helpless gesture and then let it dropto her side. “There’s a lot I can’t explain. All I know for sure is that theyare very different places, but at the same time they are very much the same.Right now, though, that’s not our problem. Right now, our problem is that ifwe’re going to find answers we first of all need to stay alive and to do that weneed to get out of here.”Alex nodded. “What are we going to do with Bethany’s body?”“Send her back to my world,” Jax said as she squatted down beside the deadwoman.When next the lightning flashed Alex was shocked to see Jax using the tip of herknife to cut strange symbols in Bethany’s forehead. “What are you doing?”“I’m sending her back to my world.”“But before you said this is a world without magic. How do you expect to do sucha thing if there’s no magic here?”“She came here with a lifeline, the same as I did the two previous times. I’mmerely activating it.”He gestured to the bed. “Jax, there’s blood everywhere—it’s all over me. Even ifyou get rid of Bethany’s body, her blood is still going to be everywhere justwaiting to be discovered.”Working at the grisly task, Jax spoke without looking up. “The blood is hers andnot from this world. It will return with her.” She looked up and grinned. “Iwish I could be there to see their faces when I send their queen back to themlike this.”As lightning flashed, the room lit for a moment in its harsh glare only toplunge back into shadows as a cracking boom of thunder shook the house. Outside,branches clattered together in the wind. Rain beat steadily against the windows.Jax swiftly cut two more mysterious symbols. Despite Bethany being dead, bloodoozed from the strange network of lines. Alex couldn’t help taking in the designwith an artistic eye, seeing the sense of movement in the lines’ composition.“There,” Jax said to herself as she stood.“There what?” In the harsh illumination of another flash of lightning he peereddown at the dead woman. “What’s supposed to happen?”Bethany might have been beautiful in life, but in death, with the way the woundacross her neck gaped open, she was grotesque. The sight turned his stomach. Inthe next flash of lightning he noticed a stab wound in her lower back. Jax’sblade had been bloody when he’d first seen it. It dawned on him that she musthave stabbed Bethany first to disable her.As Jax stood, the flickers of lightning died out and the room again went dark.Rain thrumming against the window made the darkness feel altogether creepy.When the lightning crackled again, there was nothing at their feet. No body, noblood.Alex blinked in surprise and disbelief. Bethany was gone.Just . . . gone.“There,” Jax said. “Feel better?”“How did you do that?” he asked in shock, pointing at the empty place on thefloor.“I told you. I activated her lifeline to pull her back.”Unable to believe his own eyes, Alex backed up until he bumped into the bed.“No, I mean, really. How did you do that?”He turned and in the next flash of lightning saw that the sheets were pristinewhite. There was no blood. Not a speck. He looked down at himself, then ran hishand over his clean shirt. There was no blood on it.It was as if Bethany had never been there.Jax leaned in. “Are you all right?”Alex nodded dumbly. “It’s impossible, but I saw it.”“I’ve told you every word true, Alexander.”He could only nod.She let out a sigh. “This must all be hard for you, Alex. Later on maybe I canhelp you understand it better, but right now we have to get out of here.” Shecast him a suspicious look. “By the way, what happened to that fellow out in theother room, out near the door?”“What—” Alex remembered then. “Oh, him. I broke his neck.”“Really?” Jax arched an eyebrow. “Well done, Alex. Well done.”“There were two. After I broke his neck the other one tied me to the bed. ThenBethany sent him out to wait until she was finished with me. He’ll be out therein the rain somewhere, waiting.”Jax looked unconcerned. “I already took him out and sent him back. I need tosend back the one you killed; then we can get out of here.”“Well, if the threat has been removed, maybe we don’t—”She gripped his arm. “Alex, we need to get out of here.”“You think Bethany’s people might send others after us?”“That, too.”He wondered what she meant. “How long will we have to be gone?”She gave him a heated look, then relented a little, her expression softening.“Alex, you need to listen to me.“Dangerous people have been coming here, to this world, for some time now. WhileI know some of what’s going on, I’m in the dark about much of it. I don’t think,though, that they’re coming here for a holiday.“Many innocent people have already died. This is a matter of survival for us. Amatter of life and death.“But that’s my world, not yours. You enjoy peace here in your world. You haveyour own life. We believe that it’s each person’s right to choose to live theirown life as they see fit. You have no obligation to help us.“But if that’s your choice then please tell me now. I don’t have any time towaste.“Someone from my world killed your grandfather and tried to kill you tonight.Your family has probably long been involved, possibly even been a target, thoughthey’ve been unaware of it. Prophecy from my world suggests that you’re involvedin this. The Law of Nines confirms it.“You can choose to ignore my warning. You can choose not to believe thatprophecy from my world applies to you. You can choose to do nothing and see whatwill happen, to stay out of it and just worry about keeping yourself safe.“You are free to run and hide, if you so wish.“But when they come after you, and I believe they will, you will have to face italone. I can’t wait for you. I won’t.“You have to make a choice, not because I say so, but because of the things thatare happening. No matter what you choose to do, nothing is ever going to be thesame—not for you, not for me.“I will respect whatever choice you make, Alexander, but I will not come backfor you again. You will be on your own.“If you choose to come with me, then you must understand that we’re fightingpeople who don’t belong in this world, and those people are killers. Make nomistake, if you choose to come with me, then you are choosing to fight them. Theman you killed tonight will likely not be the last.”“But maybe we could get help, get the authorities to understand and to help us—”“No. Their involvement would only end up costing more lives. Remember the twoofficers who detained those men when I first came here? Those officers ended upwith their necks broken. If we call authorities to help us, those two willhardly be the last. I don’t know who is here from my world, or even if some fromyour world might be involved.”He hadn’t even considered that. “You think people in this world might becooperating with those who have come here?”“We can’t ignore the possibility. Evil people, and those willing to help them,exist everywhere. We can’t risk being betrayed. Our only safety lies in no oneknowing about us.“The authorities in this world wouldn’t believe that there are people fromanother world among them. I don’t have the time to try to convince them, andbesides, I don’t have any way to do so. I can’t do magic here. I’ve already usedprecious time convincing you.”“But maybe I could help convince people—”“No one will believe you. You have insanity in your family. They will assumeyou’re crazy, too.”Alex knew that she was right. How many times had he questioned his own sanitysince first meeting Jax?“Your grandfather was one who knew that sometimes the best way to fight is asmall covert force, not a big battle involving a lot of men.”“How do you know that?”“We learned a little about him, that long ago he served with such shadow forces.Did he tell you some of it?”Alex nodded. He stood in the darkness for a time listening to the storm rage allaround, thinking about Ben’s lessons.“And if I choose to come with you, what then?” he asked.“If you come with me you might have to face dangers I can’t begin to guess. Inmy world I would know what to expect, but in this world I don’t. We will have nohelp. Whatever comes we will be facing it alone. We very well might die.”“You make it sound pretty hopeless.”“I can promise you only one thing,” she said with grim intensity. “If you comewith me I will protect you with my life.”Alex blinked in surprise. “Why would you do that?”“This is not the time to get into it, but know that I will lay down my lifebefore yours is lost.”She had already saved his life. Her solemn oath seemed like a portent of somegrim future lurking in the darkness waiting to envelop him.“I could really use your help to try to figure this out,” she finally said, “butI have to know that if you come with me you won’t be a liability. A lot ofpeople, a lot of lives, are depending on me. I won’t risk my life lugging alongdead weight. I need to know that if you come with me I can count on you.”He had protected her life the first time he’d seen her. He couldn’t imagine everallowing harm to visit her.“This may not be a choice you want to make, Alex, but it is the choice you face.We have spent too long here already. Are you coming with me or not?”She leaned closer in the darkness. “Decide.”Alex gazed into her eyes, feeling as if he could see into her soul. He hadalways had the vague feeling that he never really knew who he was. It had alwaysseemed like he had been waiting for something. It seemed now like he had beenwaiting his whole life for this moment.“I knew from the first instant I saw you tonight—when I saw that you had comeback—that I’m in this with you. Something is going on, something I don’tunderstand, but something deadly. This involves me. Somehow we’ve been throwntogether from worlds apart. I can’t turn away. I won’t. I’m in this.”A small smile softened her expression. She reached out and gently grasped hisarm, giving it a squeeze as if in sympathy for all the trouble that had foundhim, trouble she couldn’t shelter him from.Her voice turned intimate and gentle. “Let’s go, then.”“Wait a second,” he said as he hurriedly knelt down and threw the bedcovers backout of the way.He reached under the bed, letting his fingers settle into the four tabs of thegun safe bolted to the floor. He pressed the proper sequence and the door poppedopen.He reached in and pulled out the gun and all six spare magazines.“What’s that?” she asked.“A Glock 17.”Jax frowned. “A weapon made with technology?”“Yes, technology that will help protect us.”In the dark, he ran his index finger over the tab behind the ejection port,making sure that it was raised, indicating that a round was chambered. He alwayskept the gun loaded, but this was no time to find out otherwise.“What makes the three dots glow?”“Tritium. The sights are made with it so you can aim better in low light.”“In my world I can make a substance that glows much like that.” He noticed thatshe paid close attention to the weapon. He recalled how well she handled aknife. This was a woman who knew the value of weapons in staying alive. Heretrieved the molded polymer paddle holster and pushed it down over hiswaistband. When he holstered the gun, the retention lock clicked into place. Hethrew on a light jacket to hide the gun, then took several boxes of hollow-pointammunition from a drawer and put them in the jacket pockets along with theloaded magazines.He retrieved all the cash he had in the safe and stuffed most of it in hispockets. He handed some to Jax. She looked at it as if she were seeing someotherworldly secret.“It’s money,” he told her. “We’ll need money. You should have some on you justin case.”Without questioning, she folded the cash and slipped it into a pocket at herwaist.“We’re going to need to get you some clothes.”“I’m wearing clothes,” she said.“Yes, but you kind of stand out in that black dress and cloak. If we’re tryingnot to be found, then I think it would be best for you not to stand out. We needto blend in, be invisible among people.”She smiled. “Good thinking. Hurry, now. It would be bad if we were trappedhere.”The whole idea of people from another world chasing them seemed like some crazywaking nightmare to him. At the same time, it felt more real than anything inhis life had ever felt.“Do you know who is after us?” Alex asked.“Yes,” she said. “Pirates.”"},{"pageContent":"21.WAIT HERE UNTIL I MAKE sure it’s clear and I start the truck,” Alex said,gesturing out at his faded red Cherokee sitting in the drive.Jax glanced back into the dark house from the kitchen doorway. “All right, buthurry.”She was clearly more focused on what might be behind them in the darkness. Theintruders had come through the front door the last time. He wondered if sheexpected more of them to arrive and come up behind them through the house.Alex carefully ducked his head out, took a quick look, then pulled back in. Therain wasn’t letting up. He looked out a second time, checking the otherdirection. The Jeep was parked right outside in the driveway that ran along theside of the house.“I don’t see anyone,” he told her.She turned back from her survey of the darkness within. “That doesn’t mean alot. It’s dark and hard to see in the rain. They could be hiding anywhere. Butmore than that, just because you don’t see anyone right now doesn’t mean theycouldn’t show up at any moment.”That was a disturbing thought. “Can they do that anywhere they want?”“Theoretically, yes, but as a practical matter, no. Queen Bethany and her thugsknew this location. They came to this world right here, in this place. It onlymakes sense that others might have this point plotted as well.”“You mean that to come here you have to know specifically where you want to go?”“Not exactly. It’s not so much that it’s a problem having to do with coming hereas it is knowing specifically where you want to be when you get here. Theworlds—yours and mine—are big places. Imagine if you were to go to my world, notknowing anything about it. How would you find me, one person, in that wholeworld, among millions of people? Coming here is one thing, knowing where youwant to be when you get here is quite another.”“I see what you mean. Sounds like it must be difficult.”“When I was trying to find you the second time I watched the area of the artgallery because it was a place I knew you went. It was where we first locatedyou and at the time the only known place I had for you. That’s why we need toget away from your known locations.”“That complicates things.”“I didn’t promise you it would be easy.”“I guess not.”With his index finger he absently pressed the release lever on the side ofholster and lifted the gun just enough to make sure that it was clear. He letthe weapon drop back and click into place.“Best if we stick to the plan, then. You stay hidden in the shadows and keep alookout until I start the truck. And pull the door shut behind you when youleave the house,” he added. “I’d like to have a home to come back to one ofthese days.”Jax smiled sympathetically. “I know how you feel.”Alex slipped out the doorway and into the rain. It felt to him like stepping outof his old life and into a new one.Everything felt new to him, different, as if he were seeing the world with neweyes.It seemed he could feel each individual muscle in his body as he moved. Hethought that he could have counted every cold drop of rain that fell on him. Hewas aware of the different sensations of the rain on his face, of it matting hishair, of it wetting his pant legs, and of it spattering on the backs of hishands. He could smell the wet dirt, the concrete, and the trees. He could hearthe rain beating against the roof of the house, gurgling down the gutters,splashing in puddles, whispering against the leaves of the big maple tree at therear corner of his house, and drumming on the metal panels of the Jeep. Cloudslit from within by lightning revealed their greenish, roiling shapes beforegoing dark again. He could feel the thunder in the distance rumbling through theground. Lightning flickered closer in the west, illuminating the glistening, wetscene in stark, colorless contrast.All of his senses were firing. The world was not just new to him, but an alienplace.He swiftly unlocked the driver’s door and popped it open only enough to turn onthe interior dome light. He looked in the windows, checking that no one washiding in the back. Once he knew the truck was empty he hopped in and hit theunlock button so that Jax would be able to get in on the passenger side.When he turned the key in the ignition he heard only a click. His pounding heartseemed to skip a beat. He tried again, and again it only clicked. The starterwas resting in a dead spot. He knew from experience that he could turn the keyall night and it wouldn’t start the engine.Alex was furious at himself. He could hardly believe that he hadn’t replaced thestarter when he’d had the time. With everything surrounding Ben’s death he hadignored the matter of the starter. The excuse was pointless. An excuse wouldn’tundo the mistake.Jax ran from the house to stand in the open door of the truck. “What’s wrong?Does it always take this long?”“It won’t start.”“Magic is a lot more dependable than technology,” she said as she leaned in alittle under the shelter of the roof.“Really? How’s your magic working for you right now?”She sighed when she realized she had no argument.“I just need to roll it down the driveway to get it to start.”He always backed the truck up the sloping drive for just such an eventuality.“I’ll push it to get it going. I do it often enough. It will be fine. Run aroundand get in the—”Alex looked up just as a dark form slammed full force into Jax from behind. Thebreath left her lungs in a grunt. The violence of the impact drove her ontoAlex, knocking him back over the center console. The armrest jammed painfullyinto his kidneys. His shoulders were pressed down against the passenger seat,his neck bent at a torturous angle. In such an awkward position, the full weightof both Jax and the huge man atop her prevented him from drawing a full breath.Time seemed to stop.The growling man had a meaty arm around Jax’s neck. Lethal rage lit his darkeyes. He was only an instant away from twisting her neck and snapping it like atwig.Alex held his breath against the strain of monumental effort.His gun had already cleared the holster.He drove his fist past Jax’s head and rammed the end of the barrel into theman’s left eye socket.Without an instant’s hesitation, before the man could react, before he couldjerk back away from the gun, before he could snap her neck, Alex pressed thetrigger.The hot glare of the muzzle flash lit the inside of the truck. The sound of thegun going off was deafening. In the darkness Alex could also see the flash ofthe muzzle blast coming out the back of the man’s head, lighting a cloud ofblood, bone, and brain as the hollow-point round blew through. The recoilsnapped Alex’s hand back.Most of the debris went out the open door, but some of it splattered against theinside of the windshield and side window in the back seat. The ejected brassshell casing ricocheted off the headliner, then pinged off the passenger window.The instant the bullet tore through his brain, the hulk of a man went as limp asmud. He wasn’t thrown back like in the movies; he simply dropped dead in place.The man, who an instant before had been a blur of ferocity, was suddenly stonestill.Jax gripped the bottom of the steering wheel for leverage and with a growl ofeffort arched her back. Alex helped push her up. The dead man slid off her backand down into a heap at the side of the driveway. One arm splayed over his head,as if trying to hide the ghastly wound.Alex at last drew a needed breath. His ears rang from the sound of the gunshot.The gun had been right beside Jax’s head when it had gone off. He hoped ithadn’t deafened her.He hoped, too, that the gunshot hadn’t roused the neighborhood. On any regular,quiet night it would have awakened everyone within a couple of blocks, but withthe thunder booming enough to shake the ground, a single gunshot was lost innature’s mayhem.It had all happened so fast. The night was suddenly back to normal. The raindroned on. In a blink the killing was over and done with, a man’s life ended.Jax rubbed her neck with both hands as she twisted her head aroundexperimentally. Blood dripped from sodden strands of her blond hair.“Are you all right?” he asked, checking the darkness. “I was afraid that hemight have broken your neck.”“He would have,” she said, still catching her breath. “I guess that answers thequestion of whether or not I can count on you. Your Glock technology workspretty good.”“That’s a Glock for you. Pull trigger go boom.”“Thank you, Alexander. That was quick thinking.”He nodded. “Just returning the favor.”He holstered his gun as Jax bent down to the dead man and swiftly began cuttingsymbols that Alex recognized as the same design she had cut into Bethany.Ordinarily a gory sight like the aftermath of such a shooting might have madehim sick, but he was too angry to be anything but angry.Jax stood as soon as she had finished. She was getting faster at it. It hadtaken mere moments this time. He supposed that practice at magic that invokedtravel to another world was just like any other practice that helped make onefaster, like drawing a gun and firing at a threat.Somewhere between the sporadic flashes of lightning the man wasn’t thereanymore. It still seemed impossible the way he simply vanished. Alex glancedinto the truck. The blood that had been splattered all over and running down theside of the dashboard was gone as well. It looked as if it had never been there,as if nothing had happened.“Alex, we need to go. Men like that usually travel in pairs. The second will behere any—”There was a soft thud to the air that Alex felt as a thump deep in his chest.For an instant it seemed like there was a dark smudge swirling in the air rightbeside Jax. As soon as he saw it, the indistinct, dark stain in the nightchanged into a vortex of vapor in the humid air.The vapor almost instantly condensed into a shape.Alex was already starting to draw the gun even as he could still feel the thumpdeep in his chest. The shape came into being before his weapon had cleared theholster. Jax was already spinning toward the threat.There was no question in Alex’s mind; he had just seen a man step out of anotherworld and hit the ground running, charging at them out of the downpour. Thevapor rising from his beefy arms evaporated into the rain as he came at them.Before Alex could get the gun up and on target to fire, Jax spun, slashing openthe man’s abdomen.As the man stumbled to a stop to stare down in shock at his insides erupting outof the long gash just as he had appeared in a new world, Jax rammed her knife upthrough his eye. The blade went in hilt-deep. It was as effective as thehollow-point round had been.The man went down before he’d known what happened.In the quiet whisper of rain, Jax looked up at Alex. “Like I said, usually inpairs.”Ben had always said that in close-quarters combat, a knife was often faster thana gun. Alex was a believer.As she hurriedly squatted down to repeat her task of activating the man’slifeline, Alex holstered his Glock. “Let’s get away from here before we find outthey travel in quads.”Jax glanced up, giving him the oddest look. She then gestured. “You said thatyou had to push the, the . . . what did you call that thing?”“Truck. I have to push it down the drive to get it to start,” he said as heducked in and released the parking brake. He leaned his weight into thewindshield pillar to get the truck rolling. “Hurry with him while I get thetruck started. When I do, jump in.”The truck rolled down the drive, picking up speed. Alex ran beside it, pushing,then when it was going at a good clip he hopped in and put it in gear. As heturned to the right out into the street, in the downhill direction, he liftedhis foot off the clutch. The engine caught. He pumped the gas a few times tomake sure it wouldn’t stall, then put it in reverse, spinning the wheels on thewet pavement as he backed to the drive. Jax ran down the driveway to meet him.The second man was gone.Alex rolled his hand, urging her to hurry.Jax pressed up against the door. She slapped the palms of her hands against thepassenger window as the truck started rolling forward.“Alex! Wait! How do I get in?”Rather than try to explain where the handle was and how to push the button, heleaned across and popped open the door. The woman had opened a doorway betweendimensions or worlds or something, and yet she couldn’t open a truck door.Jax jumped in. “Sometime you will have to teach me how to do that on my own.”As he shifted into second, leaving his house in the distance behind, he noticedthat she had a death grip on the console and the door’s armrest.“Do we have to go so fast?” she asked in a breathless voice.Alex glanced down at the speedometer. “We’re only doing thirty.”“Can you make it go slower, please?”For someone who had just gutted a man three times her size and given him alobotomy for good measure, she suddenly seemed pretty squeamish. He guessed thathe was starting to feel pretty squeamish himself. He slowed down a little to lether get used to the sensation.With her blond hair plastered against her head she looked half drowned. Henoticed, too, that her hair was no longer stained with blood. Her wet dress wasa shambles from the brief battle. Seeing her alive, though, he doubted that shecould have looked any better to him. At least she also looked like she wasstarting to relax, if only a little.“I’m sorry, Alex.”“About what?”She waited until he looked over at her. “That you had to kill that man.”“I’m just thankful that he wasn’t able to hurt you.”As they raced away slowly down the street, he noticed her hands fisted in herlap. She looked like she wanted to pound rocks.“What’s wrong?”She stared off through the passenger window. “I should have been paying moreattention. It’s not like me to be so careless. I almost got us both killed.”Alex was angry as well, but for a different reason. He was still in the grip ofrage—rage at a man who had tried to hurt her and had come so close to doing so.“Don’t be so hard on yourself. We’re both alive and they’re both dead. That’swhat matters.”“Not to me,” she said under her breath as she looked away. “I didn’t come hereto be stupid.” He could detect a catch in her voice when she said, “People aredepending on me.”“Jax, look at me.” Reluctantly, she did. “We survived. I don’t think thosepeople depending on you would give you points for style. They’d only care thatwe survived so that we can find out how to stop this.”She smiled a bit at last. “You’re right. We survived. I would lecture you forbeing so sloppy, Alexander Rahl, but I was no better. Let’s hope that we bothare more careful so that the next time it isn’t nearly so close.”He returned the smile. “Deal.”"},{"pageContent":"22.ALEX SLOWED AS HE TURNED the truck into the well-lit parking lot. Even in themiddle of the night it was half full.“What is this place?” Jax asked.Alex pointed off to the right. “That’s a gambling casino over there. Gamblingisn’t legal on land, but it’s allowed on boats, so they build the whole place onbig barges and tie them to docks at the edge of the river.”“Do you spend time at this place?”Alex knew what she was getting at. He remembered her admonition about places hewas known to frequent. He had been afraid, though, that if he simply parked in astrange neighborhood or an empty lot they would draw unwanted attention.“I know of it, but I’ve never been here before.”She pulled a strand of hair back off her face. “Good.”“This place is always busy, so we won’t look suspicious parked here. We can pullthe cargo cover over the back and sleep under it.It will be cramped, but it will keep us out of sight for the rest of the night.”“I’m not so tired. I’ll stay up and stand watch.”Alex shot her a look. “Stand watch? Anyone sitting in a parked car might attractattention. You, in that dress, with that long blond hair, this time of night,are bound to draw a crowd. That’s the last thing we need.”“I look a mess,” she said as she glanced down at her dress. “Besides, I worethis dress so that I wouldn’t draw attention.”“Trust me,” he said. “A crowd.”Out of the corner of his eye he saw her start combing her fingers through wavesof her damp hair, trying to coax it back into place. Alex thought that herdisheveled condition somehow made her look all the more alluring. He had alwaysthought that if he saw a beautiful woman with her clothes and hair in disarrayand he still thought she was beautiful, then she truly was beautiful. Jax wasmore than that. She was gorgeous.A thought he definitely didn’t like crossed his mind. He wondered if her lookshelped her get close to men she intended to kill.He forced his thoughts off of how attractive she was and pulled into a parkingplace between a couple of minivans. They would make the Jeep harder to spot foranyone looking for it. Centered between towering light poles, it was as dark aplace as he could manage in the casino lot.He knew that casinos had cameras that watched their parking lots, but as long asno one approached his Cherokee he doubted there would be any reason for securityto notice them. People darted through the rainy night, hurrying to get to theircars or into the casinos. He hoped that none of those figures hidden by shadowsand rain were looking for him and Jax.Once he had turned off the wipers, with the way the rain was coming down, it washard to see much in the blur of water flowing down the windows. Alex gesturedoff to the left.“Over there are some outlet stores. We can get some more clothes there, but theydon’t open until morning.”She gazed into the distance where he pointed. “Morning is still hours away.”“So we’d better get what rest we can.”“But I—”“Didn’t you say that you weren’t paying good enough attention and you almost gotus killed? You need sleep to stay alert.”Jax sighed. “I suppose you’re right. Maybe we should try to get some rest whilewe can.”Rather than go out in the rain and get wet going in through the tailgate—andrisk being watched by security—they both climbed over the seats into the rearcargo area. With the way the rain was coming down he was pretty sure that anysecurity camera that happened to be pointed in their direction wouldn’t be ableto see anything inside the Jeep.Alex kept a blanket and a small duffel bag filled with emergency gear in theback. He spread the blanket over the floor, then pulled the cargo shade overthem and hooked it in place. Once it was secure he turned on a small LED lightfrom the bag. It wasn’t bright, but in the confined space it was more thanample. Jax watched him as he squirmed out of his jacket.“Lie down,” he told her.She didn’t object. He put the duffel bag under her head for a pillow, thendraped his jacket over her, covering her as best he could. She had to pull herknees up to fit in the small area.“Thanks,” she said as she watched him.Alex nodded as he leaned back against the wheel arch. It wasn’t verycomfortable, but he found it far preferable to being someplace where guys fromanother world could suddenly pop up and break his neck.Once they were settled he turned off the light. Yellowish lamp-light from thetall poles leaked in around the edges of the cargo shade. The rain running downthe windows made the light waver softly on her face. She was still watching him.“We need to figure out our next move.”Alex shrugged. “Maybe not. Maybe it’s over.”Her face was a picture of incredulity. “Over?”“Maybe we’ve finished it, tonight. Bethany is dead. Once they all realize thatthey’ve lost their leader, isn’t it likely they’ll quit? Maybe you’ve alreadyaccomplished what you came here to do.”Jax twisted a thread sticking out from the edge of the blanket for a moment asif trying to find words, or maybe trying to decide how much she wanted to tellhim.“I can see why it would seem that way to you, Alex—I really can—but it’s morecomplicated than that. Queen Bethany wasn’t the real problem.”She certainly had seemed like a problem to Alex. “What are you talking about?She came here from your world. You said that they have probably been interferingwith my family for a long time. She killed Ben—you said so yourself. She wanteda Rahl heir for herself, and then she planned to kill me.” Alex folded his arms.“She even had some guy buy my paintings and ruin them.”“The man who did that had no connection with her.”Alex frowned. “How do you know that?”“Because when I was looking for you through the mirror in the gallery I saw theman who ruined your paintings. His name is Sedrick Vendis. He had nothing to dowith Queen Bethany.”“Sedrick Vendis? Who the hell is he? And what do you mean he had nothing to dowith Bethany? What’s this all about?”Jax lifted a hand, urging him to calm down. “Queen Bethany was on the same sideas these people, but lately she’s been operating outside of areas where shebelonged.”“You lost me.”Jax sighed. “Bethany was a petty queen, but she was ambitious, so she alignedherself with powerful people. In the course of helping them she apparentlylearned about you and saw an opportunity for herself. Somewhere along the lineshe hatched a scheme to gain more power. She snuck here behind their backs.“The people who have been coming here, who have caused your family trouble, thepeople who are endangering both our worlds, weren’t aware of what she has beenup to. If Sedrick Vendis had known that Queen Bethany had taken tomeddling—especially if he had known what she was trying to do with you—he wouldhave killed her himself.”“So who is this Vendis character?”“He’s the right-hand man to Radell Cain, the real power behind all the trouble.I could hardly believe it when I saw Vendis here that day. It’s a bad sign thatVendis himself would come here, and that he was that close to you. Vendis is theone Cain sends to do his dirty work.”“What do you mean about them endangering your world? What’s Cain after?”Jax sighed. “Power. In the end it’s nothing more complicated than that. Justlike other people throughout history, he lusts for power. He doesn’t care whator who is destroyed in the process, as long as he gets what he wants. It’s hardto believe, but deaths in the millions mean nothing to men like that. They onlycare about power for themselves.“For the longest time we had peace and prosperity. People valued hard work andachievement. Most of us had a sense of the goodness of life. Over time, though,those kinds of things came to be seen as outmoded by more and more people whofelt entitled to prosperity without effort. They resented being told that theirdesires were a recipe for ruin.”“You mean they blamed the messenger.”Jax nodded. “There are always people like Radell Cain who are ready to takeadvantage of public resentment. He played on people’s emotions by blamingeverything on those who were still productive and prosperous, saying that theywere uncaring and insensitive. People swooned at Cain’s simplistic, populistnotions. He made what was really nothing more than simple greed sound somehowmorally righteous. He made taking what others had worked to earn sound likejustice. People ate it up.“In the middle of unrest and difficult times, Cain won people over with promisesof change—a new vision, a new direction. He made change sound like a miraclesolution to all our problems. People mindlessly embraced the notion of change.”“I guess people love hearing that nothing is their fault,” Alex said, “thatother people are to blame for their troubles.”Jax nodded. “For a lot of people it beats hard work and personalresponsibility.”“So, what was the great change that Radell Cain wanted?”“He made magic into a scapegoat. He said that it tainted everything it touchedbecause it was unfair. So, to solve all our problems, he called for bold change:a world without magic.”Alex shrugged. “I live in a world without magic. What’s wrong with that?”“But you live in a world with technology. In many ways technology and magic areinterchangeable. You could almost make the case that for all practical purposesthey’re really the same thing. Most of us don’t really understand thecomplexities of magic, like with my journey book, we simply use it. In yourworld there must be people who understand the complex technology of phones, butI bet that most people using phones don’t really know how they work.“Technology, like magic, helps everyone live better. It doesn’t merely help youto survive, it helps you to be prosperous and healthy, to live longer, to livebetter. But because magic is used by everyone, and actually understood by sofew, that knowledge has become distrusted and viewed as somehow sinister. RadellCain plays on those common fears.”“How is it that you know so much about the technology we have and yet you didn’tknow how to make tea?”“We’ve studied things here as best we could, learned what we could, but it’sonly a dim overview captured in small snatches. We partially grasp the greatsweep of how technology applies to life here, but we never understood all thedetails.“We know, for example, that you somehow use cars and trucks to help you getplaces, deliver food and goods, but we don’t understand how those machines work.We know they’re important only because we see them all the time. We’ve seenpeople talk on phones, and while we never understood exactly what they were, wegot the general idea. We once saw a red vehicle arrive to help an injuredperson, saw hoses and boxes and strange technology used to save their life.While we don’t know what was being done or how it worked, we grasped that it wassomething like a healer in my world would do.“What little we know is mostly a result of trying to learn about the Rahls inyour world as we tried to figure out what Radell Cain is after, here. Duringthat search we saw things, learned a little about the technology you use. Ourview, however, is profoundly limited. It’s like a deaf blind man trying torecount a visit to a new place.“While our tools are limited, we did the best we could. It took decades just toisolate the Rahl line here. That’s why I know a little about your grandfather’shistory and how technology is woven into your lives. We know a few random,isolated things. Making tea just wasn’t one of them.”“So you’re saying that what Radell Cain wants to do in your world is theequivalent of stopping us from using technology?”Jax nodded. “It’s not the same, exactly, but it’s a good enough comparison. Andhe doesn’t merely want to stop people from using it—he wants to entirely stripthe world of it, take it entirely out of existence. He paints it as a utopianworld.”“Do you think it would be as bad as you fear?”“Some of us understand exactly what it would mean for us, and we’re terrified.”“Why?”“Well, imagine life here without technology. Imagine life without the technologythat heats your buildings, helps grow food in abundance, makes your lights glow.What would your lives be like without your phones, your trucks, your medicinesand cures, without the means to supply the people in your cities with goods andservices?“Imagine all the people in cities deprived of every kind of technology,technology that they use every day to survive. Imagine everyone suddenly havingto find a way to grow their own food, to preserve it, to store it safely.”“People are pretty ingenious,” Alex said with a shrug. “I’m sure it would behard but I think they would cope.”“Cope? Think of the reality of your world, tomorrow, suddenly stripped of yourtechnology—no phones, no computer devices, no way to find out anything. Think itthrough, Alex.“Without your technology the fabric of civilization itself would come apartwithin days—if not hours. Everyone would be on their own. One city wouldn’t knowwhat the next was doing, or if they were even alive. There’d be no planes orcars or anything else. You couldn’t travel to other places unless you walked. Doyou have any idea how long it takes to walk just a few dozen miles? A distancethat in your cars takes a brief time would be days of hard travel on foot.“There would be no way for people to know what had happened to their far-flungloved ones. No one would know what had happened to their government. No wordwould come about anything. Everyone—everyone—would be in the dark, literally andfiguratively. You would all be sitting there with no phones, no electricaldevices, no heat, no way to get anything or summon help. Your world would fallsilent.“It wouldn’t be long until supplies of food started to rot and run out. How longwould it be until roving gangs started to loot what they wanted? Who would stopthem? How would the police know when and where crimes were being committed? Howwould they hear anyone cry for help? How would they get there? Law and orderwould quickly become a thing of the past.“When it turns cold, then what? Millions of people will rush to cut wood to tryto keep warm, that’s what. Makeshift fires used to keep warm will inevitably getout of hand. Your technology to fight the fires would be gone. Once fires catchhold, they will rampage unchecked, growing to firestorms that will gut citiesand leave tens of thousands homeless.“Disease will spread like a plague with no means to stop it. Life will be notmerely cheap but short.“When all the food is gone you will begin dying by the millions. Those stillalive will not have the strength or the will to bury all the dead. In the end,in the grip of starvation, the living will eat the dead.“The only law will be survival.“Those who once held idyllic notions of how simple and clean life would bewithout the demon of technology—like those in my world who believe the samething about life without magic—will die filthy, terrified, and confused. Theiridealistic notions will crumble in the cold face of reality. Like those in myworld, they will be unprepared for the consequences of their pompous beliefs.“What before had been simple will become tremendously difficult or impossible.The ignorant, the frightened, the weak, the criminal, will defecate in runoffareas, in streams, and in rivers, wanting their waste to be washed away. Theywon’t care about anyone downstream. Finding water will be a monumental chore.Finding clean, disease-free water will be impossible.“Sewage and garbage will lie in the open. Vermin will multiply into a nightmareof filth. The stench of human habitation will be unbearable, but you will livein it, sleep in it, have sex in it, bear children you cannot care for in it.Without technology, the product of your minds, mankind will be marked by thestench of sickness and death.“Schools, of course, will be a thing of the past. Learning will be stopped inits tracks; knowledge will wither daily. Survival itself will be anall-consuming struggle. As people die in droves the aptitude for technology, theskills, the expertise that was so common and taken for granted, will be lost.Without it your world will plunge headlong into the depths of a bottomless darkage of filth and misery. Millions upon millions of lives will be cut short asthey are born into profound ignorance, abject poverty, backward superstition,and the rule of the most brutal.“That is the reality of a world without technology—brief lives of unimaginablemisery, filth, and savagery.”Only the rain droning on filled the sudden silence. Jax sat quietly for amoment, letting it all sink in, letting the horror of understanding settle overhim.Alex knew that the Dark Ages had been a time much like she described. Theknowledge built up by past civilizations had been lost as mankind plummeted intoa black abyss. Survival was such a struggle that there were stretches ofcenturies about which next to nothing was known. That mankind emerged in theRenaissance was a testament to the nobility of the human spirit. It was onlywhen mankind rose up and began to develop technology to shape the world thatlight came into their dark existence.But it had taken a thousand years for that light to return.“That is what Radell Cain’s ideas mean to our world, Alex,” she said softly.“That will be our fate. We will be stripped of everything we’ve made of ourworld and our lives.”Alex sat sobered by such a description. He’d never really considered thefar-reaching ramifications of such a thing. He now realized that Jax had. Ifanything, she was painting a kinder picture than what would be the horrifyingreality.If technology were suddenly taken away, the suffering and dying would be beyondimagining. Without all the factories and common technologies that people whinedabout, they’d be lucky to be able to grub enough worms to keep them alive.Alex gestured vaguely. “You could use technology instead—build things, makethings, create the things you need—just like we did. Mankind here developed whatwe have from nothing.”She cast him a reproachful look. “And how many millennia did you live in a worldof darkness lit only by fire?”He knew she was right.“It took the people here centuries to create, invent, and discover things toimprove your lives. We, too, have spent countless eons developing parallelabilities that enable us to live without suffering the most common afflictionsand wants. We use those abilities to tell us the best time to plant, the besttime to harvest. Without those methods, thousands would starve. There areendless examples of how abilities developed over a long history help uslive—help us live in an unnatural and evil way, according to Radell Cain.“Because he wants to rule, because he needs something to blame simply so that hecan gain power, everything we have will be forever lost, and once lost, it can’tbe recovered.”“But why would Cain want to do that? He would rule a wasteland.”Jax arched an eyebrow. “You just said it. He would rule. He is willing to laywaste to civilization just to gain immense power for himself.“If he really cared what became of people under his rule he wouldn’t incite suchhatred for values, hold the victims responsible for the crimes against them, andshift blame to the innocent whenever anything goes wrong. He would work to solveproblems instead of using them to seize complete power for himself.“After Cain gets what he wants, no one will be able to challenge him. He willrule the world—a cold, dead, starving world—but he will rule it nonetheless,living in lavish excess with all the trappings his heart desires. What little ofeverything there is, he will control. That’s all that really matters to him. Heis a man completely without empathy for others. It only matters to him that hegets what he wants. If a few million die he doesn’t really care—the dead don’teat.”Alex stared off as he listened. “It seems impossible to believe that peoplewould go along with such a thing.”Jax sighed. “I know. It’s hard for us to believe, too, but every day peoplewillingly undergo a process called ‘the Cleansing’ to remove any giftedability—that means magic. Afterwards, after this rebirth, the magic they wereborn with and learned to master is forever gone. They tell other people thatthey feel free for the first time in their lives and pressure them to give uptheir ‘tainted’ abilities as well. Crowds wait in lines to have it done, to goalong with everyone else, to prove their virtue.”Jax looked away, her eyes filling with tears. “That’s the worst part, that somany would not value their own unique abilities, not value themselves, much lessrespect those who have fought and died so that they could live free to make thechoice to surrender that precious right of choice—along with their gift andtheir individuality.”She gripped the blanket in a fist. “I often think that they deserve everythingthey’re going to get. I only regret that those of us who value what we have willsuffer the same fate. They’re the ones I fight for. The rest of them be damned.”Alex swallowed at the pain so clearly evident in her voice. “We have people likethat in our world, too. People who say that freedom is no longer practical, thatwe must surrender it for a greater common good.”“Fear them,” she whispered. “They are the heart of evil. They tolerate tyranny,excuse it, compromise with it. In so doing they always bring savagery and deathupon the rest of us.”Alex listened to the rain drumming on the roof for a time. There was somethingabout the power in her voice, the fierce intensity, the conviction, the passionof purpose, that added to his impression that this was no ordinary woman. Thiswas a woman who knew what she was talking about.This woman was not a follower of anyone. She was a leader.“If Sedrick Vendis is Cain’s right-hand man, and important in his own right,then why would he travel to this world and buy my paintings just to defacethem?”Jax glowered with dark thoughts for a moment. “I don’t know,” she said at last.“At the time I thought it seemed rather strange, to say the least.”“So,” he finally asked, “you really think that Radell Cain wants something fromme?”Her eyes turned back up to lock onto his gaze. “The Law of Nines says that youare central in this.”He didn’t budge from her steady gaze. “Bethany told me that you’re an assassin,and that you would kill me.”"},{"pageContent":"23.JAX DIDN’T SHY FROM THE QUESTION. “If I came to kill you, then why aren’t youdead?”Alex didn’t like her evasive answer. He chose his words carefully, but kept itsimple and sincere. “Back at the house you said that if I came with you, you hadto be able to depend on me. I deserve no less, Jax. I think you owe me thetruth.”“Now you sound like a Rahl,” she said.His voice took on an edge. “I am a Rahl.”She let out a long, deep breath and looked away from his eyes again.“Well, the truth is I did come here expecting that I might end up having to killyou.”Somehow, that didn’t surprise him, but it did surprise him that she so freelyadmitted it.“But you said that I’m the one named in this prophecy of yours—”“It’s not my prophecy. It’s an ancient core prophecy, well known in certaincircles.”“Well, if I’m the one the prophecy pertains to, then why in the world would youwant to kill me, and why am I not dead?”“You are not dead because I chose not to kill you.”Alex decided to wait for her to explain. She picked at a loose thread on theblanket for a time before doing so.“The prophecy says, ‘Someday, someone born not of this world will have to saveit.’ That’s all that it says.“Short prophecy, such as this, is often the most troublesome and the mostdangerous. While it may sound simple, you can’t assume it is.“Since it’s so obviously important, the prophecy has been studied extensively,but it still remains one of those great unsolved questions that frustrate theexperts. From the beginning it’s been a prophecy associated with the House ofRahl.“In certain circles it has been known for just as long that there are members ofthe House of Rahl in this world who—”“How could there be members of the House of Rahl in your world and in my world?They’re separate worlds, separate places, maybe not even the same universe ordimension. How can there be the same line of people in both worlds?”Her eyes had a timeless look of authority, or perhaps wisdom, about them.“Because your ancestors and the ancestors of a great many other people here oncelived in my world.”Alex stared at her. He wasn’t even sure that he had heard her correctly.“That’s impossible.”Her serious expression was unwavering.“The ancestors of people here at one time lived in my world. This world was bornfrom mine, or at least some of the people were.”He had seen things that proved she was telling the truth that she had somehowtraveled here from some other place, or time, or dimension. But this? This wasjust plain crazy.Alex realized then that maybe he was taking her too literally.“You mean that ancient stories say this. That it’s a legend, a myth, some kindof Dark Ages fairy tale.”“It’s the reason that there are Rahls in both worlds—or, at least there used tobe. There are no longer any Rahls in my world. At one time they were only in myworld. Long ago some came here, to this world, to start new lives.”He thought then that he could see how the whole thing had started and how itmight have come to be misunderstood. “All right, I get it. All you’re reallysaying is that long ago some people named Rahl came to this world, much like youcame to this world, and started lives here living among the people here. That’swhy there are Rahls here. The Rahls here are descendants of a few people whoonce traveled here—sort of like you did.”“No, it’s more than that. History says that long ago our world was engulfed inwar. There were many people who didn’t want magic in their lives—didn’t want itto exist. They believed it was evil. They were adamant that they wanted to livein a world free of it. They were willing to die for that cause. They wereunwilling to allow anyone with magic to live free. They were unwilling to allowanyone with magic to live at all.“Because there could be no peace with them, because they refused to coexistpeacefully with the gifted, because they were fanatically committed to killingany gifted and wiping magic from existence, they were granted their foolish wishto live in a world without magic. But they weren’t allowed to undo our world.They were all banished here, to a world where magic didn’t exist.”“You mean, they didn’t want magic back then, either? The same as now? The sameproblem all over again?”She paused for a moment, thinking. “No, it’s not the same. Before, it was amovement, a fundamental religious belief that was larger in its scope. It was afanaticism that would not tolerate any other point of view. They believed thatthis was the will of the Creator and that they would be rewarded in theafterlife for killing the gifted.“Now it’s nothing more than a cynical ploy Radell Cain is using to cover a grabfor power. Tyrants don’t want their subjects to possess weapons. Eliminatingmagic takes a weapon away from anyone who might resist. That’s what Cain isreally after—taking away the ability of people to resist his rule.“Those who didn’t want magic back then got their wish; they were sent here. Someof the Rahl line who weren’t born with the gift chose to also come here to startnew lives.”“So we’re aliens? Our ancestors traveled here from your world?”Her nose wrinkled as she thought it over. “They didn’t exactly ‘travel’ the wayyou’re thinking, the way I did or the way Cain and his people do. The worldswere said to have been joined together—at least for an instant they were at thesame place at the same time—then they split apart, with the people who wanted tolive without magic left in this world. I don’t know how many were banished, butvast numbers, well over half the people in our world, were gone after theparting.”He thought the whole idea was too far-fetched to take seriously, but he decidednot to debate it for the moment. Instead he asked something else.“How long ago is this supposed to have happened?”“Our scale of time might be different from yours, so I can’t be certain, and wehave only the bones of history left, but that history suggests that in our worldit was long ago.“There would be virtually no record of the event here in this world. Thememories of the people who came here degraded. The breakdown of memory was partof the process. The loss of magic would have been for the most partinstantaneous, though some of it might have lingered for a short time. After awhile it would have faded, along with any memories of its origin.“It would have been a very dark and terrible time for those who came here. Evenstarting a fire, which with our ability is simple, would have been a struggle.“As a result, generation upon countless generation would have lived in savageryand ignorance that would have been ruled by superstition and hardship. Recordingevents would have been a luxury beyond the scope of people struggling just tosurvive another day. There would likely be no real record of it here.“The era would now seem a black hole in your history.”“So that’s why we don’t have magic and you do?”“Yes. Your ancestors—like mine—were people who lived lives with magic as aroutine part of everyday life. The difference is that the people in our worldstill have their magic; the people who came to your world don’t.”Alex wiped a weary hand across his face. He tried his best to keep theimpatience out of his voice. “I guess that I can imagine that there is magic inyour world, Jax. It’s a different place. For all I know, the laws of naturecould be different there. But here things don’t work that way. It isn’t justthat magic doesn’t exist here—it can’t exist here. The laws of nature don’tpermit such a thing.”He had almost said “such a silly thing” but restrained himself.“So?”“So, I can’t believe that it was ever part of reality for the people of myworld.”“It wasn’t, once they were here.” Seeing that the answer didn’t satisfy him, shelooked up, thinking for a moment before asking a question. “You don’t have havewizards, witches, sorceresses, dragons, or magic here in this world?”“No, not real ones.”“Then why are those things part of all cultures, all peoples, throughout yourhistory? Why do different people in different places in different times speak ofthem? Why do they even have the words for things that can’t possibly exist?”“It’s just ancient legend, myth.”Jax arched an eyebrow. “Why has this myth always been basically the same inevery culture, in every corner of your world? Why do they all have the samewords for the same imaginary things—myths—that can’t exist? Where do you supposesuch common myth was born?”Alex didn’t have an answer.She leaned closer. “It was born in my world. The reality was left behind in myworld. Why is magic such a universal part of your language, your culture, eventhough it does not exist here, cannot exist here? Why?“Those who came here could bring with them only the fading memories of thosethings. As you say, magic is not part of the reality of nature here. It can’texist here. I’m sure that those who resettled here soon came to deeply regretever having wished for a life without magic. There could have been nothing worsefor them than getting exactly what they had wanted.“Those things lost lived on in this world but only as a ghost of what once was,of what is now gone.“That myth, that legend, is all the history that’s left from those who came herefrom my world.“They left magic behind, yet it still haunts you.”"},{"pageContent":"24.ALEX COULDN’T BRING HIMSELF to accept her story as true—it just seemed toofar-fetched and there were too many things that didn’t seem to fit with what heknew of the history of the world. Yet at the same time it had a haunting qualityto it, some kind of lingering whisper that he couldn’t entirely banish. Therehad been vast dark stretches in human history about which virtually nothing wasknown.“I don’t have an answer for you, Jax, but just because I don’t know the answerdoesn’t mean that there isn’t one. For all I know, it could be that your historyis really the one based on legend and myth.”“Have it your way, Alex,” she said with a sigh. “If it’s too much for you rightnow, then let it be. Besides, that isn’t what matters at the moment. Whatmatters now is that the Law of Nines indicates you are the one named in theprophecy from my world, where prophecy is magic and magic is real.”He knew that she was right about at least some of it. He knew that what wasgoing on now was real. His muscles ached from the shocks Bethany had given himwith the Taser. He’d seen bodies vanish. He’d seen a man appear out of thin air.He didn’t know the truth about the past or if he could ever believe the wholefar-fetched notion, but he did know that something was going on now, and it mostdefinitely involved him.“All right, I’m listening,” he said. “What matters now?”“We believe that Cain’s people have been coming to this world to find somethingthat will help them tip the balance to their side once and for all. We don’tknow what it is they’re after, but they’re expending a lot of resources on it,so we fear that if they find what they’re after, we’re finished.”Alex lifted his hands in exasperation. “But if your people believe in prophecyand that I’m the one who can save your world, then why would they want me dead?I die, you all die.”She regarded him with the kind of expression that made him a littleuncomfortable. “Prophecy can mean something very different from what you thinkit does. What if you were to cooperate with Cain’s people? What if you weretortured into helping them? What if you helped them without realizing what youwere doing? Any of those would result in the same end. You would be directlyresponsible for the deaths of millions.“If any of those things turned out to be true, then the only way you could beour salvation would be if you died before you could help Radell Cain.“The prophecy, you see, does not say that you must be alive to save our world.It could mean that you must die if our world is to be saved.”Alex ran his fingers back into his hair and held his head. He wanted the wholenightmare to be over. He hated the deliberately vague nature of prophecy.Prophecy always tried to make any outcome look like a prediction or else itspoke of war, floods, and droughts because there would always be war, floods,and droughts. As far as Alex was concerned, prophecy, like magic, was childishnonsense that depended on the gullible.“Why then,” he finally asked, “didn’t you kill me?”“If I believed that version of the prophecy you would already be dead.”“So you believe this prophecy, but the other way around?”“We have a saying: ‘The House of Rahl is not ruled by prophecy; the House ofRahl reigns over prophecy.’“The first time you saw me, you pulled me back to save me. It was a test. Mytest. You passed that test. Had I judged you to be the kind of man to help theenemy I would have killed you on the spot and have been gone before you hit theground.”“So, because I pulled you back from getting run over by pirate plumbers, youdecided not to kill me?”“In part. I subscribe to the Rahl view of prophecy, that it needs the balance offree will in order to exist. Free will in the House of Rahl meant that they didnot abide by prophecy.”That bit of common sense made him feel better. “So the Rahl line in your worlddidn’t believe in prophecy, either.”She laid a hand on his forearm. “I came because of prophecy—not because Ibelieve it, but because Cain does. I believe that you, Alexander Rahl, are thekey to solving what’s going on. Radell Cain believes it as well.”“If he needs me, then why hasn’t he acted? You said they’ve been coming to thisworld for some time. Why haven’t they done what they came to do? Why haven’tthey snatched me?”“I asked myself that same question,” she said. “What I finally decided is thathe must not know enough about what he’s looking for. I’m sure that he knows ingeneral, but I don’t think he knows nearly enough, yet, to act.”“How could he be here looking for something and not know what he’s looking for?”“Well, let’s say, for the sake of argument, that when the worlds were parted,besides sending people here, an important book was also sent here. Things likethat have been done before to keep dangerous information out of the wronghands.”“You think he’s looking for a book?”“I’m just using that as an example. How would he find it here? He couldn’t usemagic here to help him—magic doesn’t work here, remember? Where would he look?”“So for some reason he’d try to find it through a Rahl?”“Do you know where to find such a book that came from my world and didn’t belonghere? How would you know where it was, or even what it was? You couldn’t. Maybehe’s already killed members of your family trying to make them tell him and hefound out that that didn’t work. So, what’s he to do, now?”“I’d like to know the answer to that question,” Alex said.“He knows that you’re involved in all this—that’s why he has been watching youthrough mirrors, tracking you with your phone. He’s trying to find answers. Butsince you’re his last lead, he has to be careful.”For the first time since they had fled his house Alex felt a bit of optimism.“So if Cain needs me, then those men who tried to run us down when I first sawyou must have been Bethany’s men.”“No, they were Cain’s men.”Alex lifted his hands in frustration. “That doesn’t make sense. If he needssomething from me, if he’s been watching me, then why would he suddenly have hismen try to run me down?”“They weren’t trying to run you down. They were watching you. When they saw me,they recognized me. They were trying to run me down. You prevented them fromdoing so.”Alex paused a moment. “You recognize them? You know them?”“I know the big one, the one who was on the side closest to us. His name isYuri. I killed his brother.”Alex sighed. This was one determined woman.“That was my first, brief visit here. I wasn’t able to stay long.When I returned home we immediately began making preparations so I could comeback again, but it takes time. It was while I was watching the gallery throughthe mirrors, looking for you, that those preparations were finally completed.That was when I saw Vendis. When I returned to this world you gave me thatpainting.“You have no idea what it meant to me.”“I think I do,” he said softly.She smiled a little but shook her head. “When I saw that painting I knew thatyou are central to solving what is going on. So, I thought that if I told yousome of the nature of the trouble, you might be motivated to help me. But . . .”“But I made you angry instead.”Jax smiled as she nodded. “When I went back I told people how you so faithfullypainted the Shineestay, the place I told you about. People understood, then.”“Just because I painted a forest that looked similar?”“No. Because I told them how you painted the exact place, down to the placementof every tree—except the one tree I mentioned that was missing from the scene.”Alex remembered. He had painted over that particular tree because it didn’t fitthe composition. He didn’t say so, though, as he listened to her go on with herstory.“You see, it’s said that long ago the Rahl leader at the time—the one who issaid to have separated the worlds—believed that magic involved art, that thecreation of new magic in some ways involved the application of artisticprinciples at the least and maybe even artistic ability.”“Oh come on. Now you’re telling me that art is magic?”“No, not at all, but Lord Rahl believed—”“Who?”“The man who was the leader at the time of the separation event was a Rahl, thelast Rahl we know anything about before the House of Rahl vanished somewhere inhistory. Back then he was called simply ‘Lord Rahl.’ He fought and won much thesame battle of survival that we find ourselves fighting now. The title of LordRahl has since come to represent the preservation of magic and individualliberty, to represent for us the very concept of freedom.“We don’t know a great deal about the time back then, but it is known that LordRahl’s victory against all odds ushered in a period of peace and prosperityknown as the Golden Age that lasted hundreds of years. This man was itsarchitect. His victory over tyranny and the banishment of those who wanted toeliminate the gift made it all possible.“For this reason the very concept of the Lord Rahl is hated by Radell Cain andhis ilk.“Anyway, Lord Rahl believed that new forms of magic are acts of creation thatnecessarily involve elements of artistic visualization. Art—good art—involvesprinciples of balance, flow, placement, and composition, among other things.These elements must be in harmony, each element working with all the others, inorder for art to have deep meaning to us, for it to truly touch our souls. Somagic and art, he believed, were inescapably linked. When you painted a pictureof my world, you were somehow tapping into that elemental concept that he usedto bridge worlds, time, and space.”“Does this mean that you’re not going to try to kill me?” he asked with a smile.She returned a sleepy smile. “I’m here to protect you, Alex. I need your help ifwe’re to solve this. Other than finding you and trying to keep both of us alive,I don’t know what to do next. That part is up to you.”Alex blinked in surprise. “Me? How should I know? These people came here fromyour world. I’m in the dark about the whole thing. Why would you expect me toknow what to do?”She stared at him as if it should be self-evident. “You’re Alexander Rahl.”“Jax,” he said at last, looking away from her eyes as he considered how to puthis thoughts into words, “I don’t know if you really have the right person.”“The Law of Nines says you are the right person.”“That’s not what I mean.” He lifted a hand in a weak gesture. “I think thatmaybe you’re putting too much faith in me. This Law of Nines business is justsuperstition. I fell into the prophecy by chance, that’s all. None of it saysanything about me as an individual. I’m just a guy who paints pictures for aliving. I don’t know about any of this. I don’t know how to fight people fromanother world.”“You’ve done all right so far.”He shrugged off the notion. “I was just trying to stay alive. That doesn’t meanyou should put your faith in me. Even if people from the House of Rahl reallydid come here, exactly as you say, that was an awfully long time ago. I can’tlive up to what they could do in your world.” He ran his fingers back throughhis hair in frustration. “I just don’t think you—”“Alex, listen to me.” She waited until he looked at her. “There is a mirror inthe room where you paint. When I was waiting for the preparations to be made forme to make a longer visit here, I sat for hours at a time watching you paint,wishing I could find a way to warn you through that mirror of all the forceshoming in on you.”Alex had remembered well her advice when he’d first met her that people couldwatch him through mirrors. He had been careful with mirrors even before thatwarning. And he had purposely placed that one in his studio, hoping he would bewatched—hoping that Jax would see him through that mirror and decide to return.He had placed it there specifically for her.“I learned a lot watching you through that mirror.”He smiled a little. “A lot about how to paint, maybe.”“No. A lot about you. When you watch a person for a long time you come tounderstand their dedication, their focus, their moods, their emotions—the waythey think, or don’t bother to think. You come to learn what’s important tothem.“One day, as you turned to wipe your brush, I saw a picture catch your eye. Itwas the picture of your grandfather that you kept on the desk beside you. Youlaid down your brush and picked up that picture and sat staring at it for a timeuntil tears ran down your face.”“It’s human to grieve,” Alex said. “There’s nothing meaningful about that,nothing special.”She nodded. “I know. It’s natural to grieve, to be sad, to pine for one lost, tohave a broken heart. But as you wept, your other hand fisted. Your jaw clenched.Your face turned red with rage. You pounded your fist on the desk as you wept.”Alex swallowed at the memory of the heat of that emotion. “What of it? I wasangry.”“You were angry at death for taking him. You were raging against death itself.You raged against death because life means that much to you. You’re the rightman, Alexander Rahl. You’re the man I came here to find.”Alex listened to the rain as he thought about her words.“Then that bell rang,” she said. “I saw Bethany’s reflection in a window.“In that instant I saw all that was about to be lost.“We’re still struggling to learn to come here. It’s very difficult and takes usquite some time to craft a lifeline. Passing into the great void is dauntingbeyond imagining.”Alex couldn’t picture such a thing. “In what way?”Jax stared off into the memories for a moment. Flashes of lightning cast herface in an otherworldly bluish light.“It’s like leaping off a cliff into eternal night . . . falling without end.Every second you expect to hit the bottom. Your muscles and nerves ache inexpectation of a sudden, bone-shattering impact. An eternity of fear iscompressed into every one of those moments that you exist in a place withoutanything but that fear.“At first you may feel like you have leaped into endless night, but a pointcomes when you realize that there is no up, no down, no hot, no cold, no light,no sensation of any kind, not even breathing, not even your own heart beating.You are without anything that makes you feel alive.“In that moment comes panic.”When lightning hit nearby, giving off a loud crack of thunder that shook theJeep, Alex jumped. Jax didn’t. It was as if she was in another place beyond thereach of the real world.“How long does it take?” Alex finally asked after she had been silent for atime. “How long must you endure such a thing?”Her haunted eyes stared unblinking into memories. “You feel as if you havesomehow plummeted into eternity. You feel alone beyond anything I could explain.“There comes a time when you begin to believe that you’ve died. You can’t seeanything, you can’t hear anything. You feel as if you must be dead.”Jax seemed to force herself to abandon the memory, as if staying there anylonger might cause the place to snatch her back. She took a purging breath andlooked over at him.“When I start for this world I have a reference point found with the aid ofmagic, so from here there is no way for me to find a reference point in myworld, no way to know where to return to. That’s why I need a lifeline to pullme back through that eternal void to my world. Without a lifeline there is noway to return.“When I went back the last time I took the painting you gave me, but I lost itin the void. I loved that painting and wanted more than anything to take it backwith me for others to see. I held it as tightly as I could, but I lost it. Idon’t remember where or how it was gone, it just was. That experience provedwhat we had thought—things can’t be brought back from this world to ours.“I’m sorry, Alex, that I lost your beautiful gift.”He offered her a smile of comfort. “I’ll paint you another.”She nodded her thanks for his understanding.“When I saw Bethany and her thugs at your door I knew that I didn’t have amoment to lose. I had to come immediately, even though I had no lifeline ready.“I had to come because you are the right man, Alex.”Alex listened to the rain drumming steadily against the roof of the Jeep and thedistant rumble of thunder. He remembered the day in his studio that she haddescribed. He had forgotten all about the mirror by then; he thought that hewould never see her again. That hadn’t been the only day he had raged againstdeath for taking Ben. If she had been watching him, she would know that, too.Ben wouldn’t be dead were it not for these people coming to his world, comingfor his family, coming for him.If he didn’t stop them, who would? How many more would die?Jax laid a hand on his arm. “Are you all right, Alex?”He nodded. He wondered how she could be all right, knowing that she had no wayto get home.“We need to stop them,” he said with quiet resolve. “I don’t know if I’m theright man, but I’m the only Rahl you’ve got. If I can do anything to help, Iwill. If we can figure this out and stop them, then maybe other people won’tneedlessly lose their loved ones.”“Thank you, Alex,” she whispered. She again gently rested her hand on his arm,as if to say she understood all that his words conveyed, and was sorry to haveto ask so much of him.He knew that, for her, there was no turning back. There wasn’t any turning backfor him, either. No matter what happened, they were now committed.Her face brightened with a small smile. “So, any ideas?”“Well,” he said, “Bethany knew something about what these other people wereafter. She wanted to bear my successor. That could only gain one thing: theinheritance that came to be mine when I turned twenty-seven. I think we need tofind out about this land that I’m inheriting.”“I suppose that it makes sense for us to look into it. But I can’t see how itwould have anything to do with what they’re after. What do they need with land?”“I don’t know, but Bethany sure seemed intent on having it.”“Not necessarily. It makes more sense to me that what she was really after wasyour child, a Rahl child.”“What good would a Rahl child do her?”“A Rahl in my world would be currency of immense value. A Rahl heir would havemade her far more important than she otherwise was.”“You think she intended to get pregnant and return to your world? You just saidthat you can’t take anything back.”“But if she got pregnant, the child would have been hers as well. It would havebeen a part of her. That, I’d be willing to bet, she could have taken backthrough the void to my world.”“I was sure it had to be something to do with the land,” Alex muttered.“It may be,” Jax said. “I’m only saying there are other important reasons shewould have wanted you to get her pregnant. I can see why she would want a Rahlchild, but I can’t imagine what she would want with land. She has land—a lot ofit.”“So you’re convinced it’s not the land they’re after?”Jax shrugged. “I’m only pointing out that there are other reasons people from myworld might be interested in you.”Alex let out a sigh. “Well, as far as I know my mother is the only other livingRahl. I’ve heard her say that people always want to know things from her.“The land is far away, but my mother is close. Before we consider the land angleI think we should go ask my mother what these people want to know from her. I’mnot sure if she’ll be able to talk, but we can try.”“You said she was crazy.”“Maybe she isn’t as crazy as I thought. Maybe they’ve driven her crazy. Anyway,it’s a place to start.”Jax watched his eyes for a moment. “That makes sense. Tomorrow, then, we go seeyour mother.” She lay back and yawned. “You were right, we’d better get somesleep.”Alex nodded as he yawned in turn. He watched as she rearranged her duffel-bagpillow. Her eyes closed.“Jax, you’re someone important where you come from, aren’t you?”“I’m just a woman, Alex. A woman who has no powers here. A woman who is afraidthat she will never see her home again. A woman who is afraid for the lives ofthose she loves.”“Those you love. Like a man you love?”“No,” she whispered, her eyes still closed. “Not that kind of love. I have noone like that.”He watched her breathing slow for a time. She looked bone-tired. Traveling froma distant world through that void had sounded like more than merely anexhausting experience.“Jax,” he asked softly, “are you like a queen or something?”She smiled sadly without opening her eyes, “In my world, queens once bowed tothose like me, but not anymore. Now they bow to Cain.” Her voice seemed halfwayinto the world of sleep. “Now I’m just a frightened, desperate woman a long wayfrom home. A woman who often fears she is foolish to think she can win againstthese people.”He watched her for a time. “I don’t think you’re foolish in the least,” hewhispered as he tucked the jacket around her, “I think you’re the bravest personI’ve ever met.”She was already asleep and didn’t hear him."},{"pageContent":"25.THAT’ S FINE,” MR. FENTON SAID. “I shouldn’t have any trouble having the finaltitle documents ready for you in a few days.” “Thank you,” Alex said into thephone. “That should work out. I’m not sure of my travel plans yet, but I imaginethat it will take me at least a few days to get there.”“I’ll give you a call, Mr. Rahl, and let you know when the documents are ready.”“Uh, no . . . don’t bother,” Alex said, his mind racing for an excuse. “I’mhaving trouble receiving calls on my phone. There’s something wrong with it.When I get time I’m going to have to see about getting it fixed or replaced.I’ll let you know when I do. In the meantime I’d hate to miss your calls and Iwouldn’t be aware that you were trying to reach me. Tell you what, I’ll call youin a few days and let you know when I’ll be in Boston.”“I look forward to seeing you. Thank you for calling. Oh, and the people at theDaggett Trust were quite pleased with your decision and are eager to meet you.”Alex wondered why.“All right, then, I’ll call you as soon as I know something about my travelplans.”“Thank you, Mr. Rahl. I’ll talk to you soon.”Alex flipped the phone closed and then dropped it in his large cup of water.Bubbles rose from the phone as Alex carefully folded over the top of the papercup several times to seal it. He placed the cup upright in a trash container sothat the water wouldn’t spill out, at least for a time.He clearly remembered Jax saying that people on the other side had been usinghis phone to track him. He didn’t have any sure way to know if the same peoplehad somehow locked on to his new phone or not. For all he knew, placing a callto the lawyer’s office could somehow enable Cain’s people to find him throughthe phone.Possible or not, he wasn’t going to take any chances. It was a cheap genericphone. He would buy another. The number would be different, but he’d told thelawyer not to try to call him. There was no one else he needed to talk to, atleast not enough to risk his life.His new gallery might want to get in touch with him, especially if they sold oneof his paintings, but in light of all that had happened that wasn’t importantfor the time being. He had new concerns. He had a new life, it seemed. Hewondered how short that life might be.Alex glanced down the hall, toward the restrooms. He had already finishedwashing up. Jax was still in the ladies’ room. An outlet mall was not the bestplace to clean up, but it was better than nothing.They’d already had a breakfast of sausage and egg sandwiches in the food court.Jax had devoured three.Remembering that she hadn’t been able to open the door of the Jeep on her own,he had carefully explained the faucets and toilets to her, just in case shedidn’t know how to use them. She’d listened with interest, like a student payingattention to a lecture in a course she needed to pass.The morning had dawned with bright blue skies, but it was windy, a remnant ofthe violent storms that had passed through the night before. At least the rainhad moved on. Seeing the bright blue skies as they had emerged from the cargoarea of the Cherokee had made the night before—the lightning and thunder, thedesperate fights, the killing, the blood—seem like a distant nightmare.The next time he glanced down the hall, he saw Jax coming. She smiled when shesaw him. It was a smile that sparkled in her warm brown eyes and lifted hisheart. After the night before they both knew that they only had each other todepend on. They had a bond of purpose.Surprisingly enough, she looked for the most part to be back to her normal self.He didn’t know how she had accomplished such a feat after how soaked they hadbeen, and after sleeping in the cramped quarters of the Jeep, but she had. Hesmiled to himself when the thought crossed his mind that it seemed like she hadto have used magic to restore her lush fall of blond hair to full glory.The only problem with the way Jax looked was that she looked too good. In RegentCenter she fit in. In an outlet mall near the casinos, where fancy dress wastoo-short skirts or muffin-top jeans, a tank top, and flip-flops, she stood out.With most of the men in the mall looking her over from top to bottom, he didn’tknow how to tell if Jax was being watched by someone from another world or not.Alex was eager to get her something else to wear so that she wouldn’t draw quiteso much attention.“You look very nice,” he said as she joined him.“Yes, I know what you mean. Let’s get me some other clothes so that I don’t lookso very nice.”Alex wondered if such a thing was even possible. He was sure, though, thatdifferent clothes would at least draw less attention. Jax was apparently wellaware of how different her attire looked from that of other people in the mall.Being a target as she was, she had to worry about standing out.“Did you have any trouble using the faucets or anything?”“No, but a thin girl in the washing room was a little too curious about me.”“Why? What did she say?”“She said, ‘So, like, are you a supermodel or something?’ ” Jax quoted,mimicking the adolescent voice. “I wasn’t entirely sure what she meant, but Ithink I got the idea. When I told her no, she said, ‘So, like, what do you do,then? Like, for a living.’ ”Alex smiled at the story, and the predicament Jax had found herself in.“What did you tell her?”“I told her that I killed people for a living.”Alex lost a step. “You told her what?”“That I kill people. I’m not familiar enough with your world to come up with acredible lie, so I told her the truth.” Jax flicked her hand, dismissing thealarm on his face. “People usually don’t believe the truth. They’d rather hear agood lie.”“What did the girl say when you told her that you kill people?”“She said, ‘Like for real? That’s so cool.’ ”“Good. I thought for a moment you might have scared her.”“No, she seemed rather preoccupied with death. Her fingernails and lips werepainted black. What’s the purpose of trying to resemble a corpse?”“I think it’s a phase some girls go through,” Alex said. “Didn’t you ever, Idon’t know . . . rebel against adults when you were young? Want to bedifferent?”Jax frowned up at him. “No. Why would I do such a thing?”Alex sighed. “I guess you really are from another world. What did you do, then,when you were her age?”“I studied and practiced.”Alex frowned over at her as they walked among the scattering of people alllooking at them on the way by. “What did you study and practice?”A little smile curved one side of her mouth. “How to kill people.”He watched her for a moment. “Is that one of those truth tricks of yours, or alie you think I might believe?”“Both,” she said.“What does that mean?”She smiled to herself. “I studied languages. I speak a lot of the languages inmy world. Feel better?”He decided not to press her and changed the subject. “Considering that otherpeople are likely to ask questions, too, and we might find ourselves questionedwhen we’re not together, I think we’d better come up with a believable story,something we can use if need be.”“Don’t tell me,” she said, fanning her face as if feeling faint, “we’re madly inlove, I am betrothed to you, and we’re to be married.”Alex winced a little. “Well, as a matter of fact, that is what I came upwith—the engaged part. I thought it would be a useful story. I mean, if I’m totake you into the hospital where my mother is locked up I should have some kindof plausible story. They don’t let just anyone in. You need to be someone close,like a relative, a spouse, something like that.”“Why is your face red?”“Look, I just figured that if we said that you were my fiancée it would satisfypeople and avoid a problem. I didn’t realize that you’d object.”“Relax,” she said with a smile. “I thought of that same story myself.”“Oh. You did?”“Of course. What else could we say to people where your mother is held? That I’ma woman who dropped in from another world and I would like to speak with thecrazy lady?”“Is my face really red?”She glanced up at him. “A little.”“So, you’re my fiancée? You’re all right with that story?”She arched an eyebrow at him. “Unless you’re planning on us going through withthe marriage.”He slowed and gestured to a window filled with female mannequins dressed incasual clothes, glad to have a change of subject. “We should be able to get yousomething in here.”He held the big glass door open for her. She looked back over her shoulder.“Your face is still red, Alex.”“Well, actually,” he said, “I was thinking that maybe it would be best if we didactually go through with it and get married. If it was legal it would solve alot of problems. When we get to the lawyer’s office, already being married wouldhelp the transfer of the title to the land go smoothly. . . .”He was pleased to see her freeze and stare at him. “Just kidding,” he said.“Your face is red.”She shook her head to herself. “I imagine it is.”Round racks with pants, tops, and skirts crowded the floor of the store. Alexdirected Jax toward a rack with jeans. As they made their way through theislands of clothes, he leaned close.“Jax, is there any way to tell if someone is from your world? A way to tell ifthey’re a different kind of human?”“No. They’re the same as you, except that in my world they have magic. Here theydon’t. I only know they’re from my world if I recognize them.”“Or if they try to kill you.”“Well, in my world we would call that a clue.”“My world too,” he said, disconcerted to realize that there was no way to tellfriend from foe.When they reached the rack with the jeans he found the size-8 section and pulledout a pair.“This looks like it might fit you,” he said.Jax glanced around at the circular racks stuffed with clothes. “To think, thereare so many things already made that you have a good chance to happen acrosssome that will fit.”“They’re sized,” he said. “They come in standard sizes.”She shook her head in wonder as she took the jeans from him. Her brows drewtogether. “These are worn out. Are they a donation for the poor? Is that whatthis place is?”Alex laughed softly. “No, no, they’re new. They’re made to look used. Believeme, they’re not for the poor.”Jax appraised him suspiciously.“It’s the fashion,” he assured her.She looked like she suspected that he might be putting her on again. “Thefashion is to look destitute, with holes in your clothes? Why would anyonechoose to look that way?”“I don’t know.” He scratched his temple. “I guess the fashion is to look as ifyou’re wearing comfortable old clothes. It’s meant to look casual.”“Like making yourself look like a freshly dead corpse?” She sighed as she laidthe jeans over the rack. The saleswomen were all acutely interested in Jax. Insuch a shop her graceful black dress and blond hair made her look like a queenvisiting a dump.“Please, Alex, can we get clothes that don’t have holes in them? I want to fitin, but . . .”“Sure.” He pulled out another pair that he thought might be more to her liking.“These aren’t even as expensive as the ones with the holes already worn inthem.”“Now you’re joking at my expense.”“I’m telling you the truth, the ones with holes cost more. Would you like me totell you a lie that you’d rather believe?”When she still looked skeptical he pulled out another pair and showed her theprice tags.She took the jeans from him. “I like these better.”“You won’t be as fashionable.”“Will I fit in?”“Yes.”“Then may I have these instead? Please?”Alex smiled. “Of course you can. We’ll get you whatever you feel comfortablewearing. You pick.” He gestured with his chin. “Over there is a fitting roomwhere you can try them on to see if they fit and how they look.”“I can try anything I want?”“Sure.”She looked relieved and started searching through the rack herself. With acritical eye she appraised the different styles and picked out several pair thatdidn’t have holes and cuts already put in them for the convenience of the busy,fashion-conscious woman. As she searched, she handed him jeans to hold.Along the way to the fitting room they stopped at several more racks with slacksand several with tops. She wasn’t interested in skirts; she thought they wouldshow too much of her legs and draw attention. From what Alex had seen of herlong, muscular legs, he had to agree. In the end, though, she changed her mindand decided to try one.She was picking up the knack for shopping pretty quickly. Alex didn’t think thatthe saleswomen would find anything at all odd about the way she shopped. Theywould think that she was a woman who knew exactly what she wanted.As Jax went in to try on her armload of clothes, Alex found a chair and casuallypulled it out to the side so that he could have a view of the fitting-room doorand also the entrance to the shop. He wanted a clear view if anyone unwelcomecame in.He hoped that no one like that showed up. Firing his gun at night in the middleof a thunder-and-lightning storm was one thing; having to fire the weapon in themiddle of a shopping mall was quite another. If the bad guys didn’t get him, thegood guys were sure to.Jax soon emerged from the fitting room wearing a pair of low-rise jeans and ablack top. “How does this look?”“Hot.”She frowned. “Not really. I think I would need my cape over this to keep me warmif it gets at all chilly.”“No, I mean it looks hot—attractive, beautiful. Hot.”She got the picture. “Well, I’m glad you think I look hot, but is it good enoughto serve the purpose of fitting in?”“Yes. It’s perfect. Try on some more. You’ll need a few outfits. Try on theblack pants, the ones that look tailored.”When she came out in a simple white blouse and the black pants, he nodded.“Good. That’s the right look.”The lawyer said that the transfer of title would be ready in a couple of days,but Alex would have to sign the papers in person. As meticulous as the lawyersounded, Alex didn’t want Jax to raise eyebrows. He was hoping the lawyer mightbe able to give them some information, or at least a clue, that could help them.If they were to put a man of such orderly nature at ease, Alex thought, he andJax needed to appear respectable.They picked out a few more outfits, mostly jeans, that would look normal in mostsituations and be good for traveling. After they paid for the clothes they satat a table in the food court so he could cut off the tags. He used hispocketknife for the task, warning Jax not to pull her knife out in public. Afterhe was finished with a pair of jeans and the black top that she liked, she wentto the bathroom to change while Alex removed the rest of the tags and labels.He noticed that when she came out she still attracted attention, but it was alittle different. It was admiring glances rather than frowning curiosity.She came to a halt before him as he picked up the bags with their purchases. Shehanded him a bag with her black dress. He felt a little guilty about asking herto wear clothes she wasn’t accustomed to.“Well, what do you think?” he asked.She gave him a crooked smile. “I think I look hot.”Alex heaved a sigh of relief, glad that she was taking it well. “You’ll get noargument from me. Better yet, you look like you belong in this world. Hopefully,Cain’s people won’t recognize you now.”“That may be too much to hope.” She took his arm as they started back to thetruck. “Thank you, Alex, for helping me fit in better here. It will make iteasier to find answers.”On the way through the mall back toward the parking lot, Jax abruptly pulled himto a halt. He looked over to see her staring into a store window.The shop was called Pandora’s Treasure Box. The place sold an extensive varietyof figurines and such. They had a lot of wizards and dragons from what Alexcould see.Jax shot him a meaningful look. “What is this?”Alex shrugged. “Some people are interested in that kind of thing.”Without further word, she marched in the door of the shop."},{"pageContent":"26.PANDORA’S TREASURE BOX SPECIALIZED in items that, for the most part, looked tobe related to some aspect of magic. They had everything from board games withflying creatures, to amulets, to fairies, to gnomes, to dragons of every sort,to wizards and witches, to crystals, to intricate handmade magic wands that costhundreds of dollars. Glass shelves in the center of the shop held more elaboratecollectible figurines. Books on the shelves against the far wall had titlesabout spells, wizards, and magic.Alex had seen places like Pandora’s Treasure Box before. As a boy he had visitedsuch shops a time or two. He’d outgrown them in his early teens.A smiling, overweight woman in a baggy maroon sweatshirt came out from behindthe counter. A small dragon comb adorned her short, curly brown hair. Readingglasses hung around her neck on a chain festooned with delicate winged fairies.She looked to be in her fifties.“I’m Mary, welcome to Pandora’s Treasures. May I help you two find anythingspecial?” she asked in a warm, friendly voice.“We’re just looking,” Alex said before Jax could say anything. It didn’t help.“Why do you have these things?”The woman’s face creased with a perplexed smile as she glanced around. “They’retreasures. People love to collect them. There’s nothing like a wizard sitting onyour desk to brighten your day.”“Depends on the wizard,” Jax said.The woman chuckled. “You’re right, my dear. Some of them can be quitemischievous.”“What makes you think so?”Mary held a hand out to a display in the center of the shop. “Well, just look atthem. We have all sorts. Some wizards are very serious, but there are some—likethis fellow here—who love a bit of mischief.” The wizard was levitating a dog.The woman was right about the variety. There were jolly-looking wizards inpeaked hats, wizards with long pointed beards pondering books or crystal balls,and wizards in black robes with glowering, hooded eyes that looked like theyreally could cast spells. Some were plain pewter while others had been paintedin elaborate detail.Alex thought they had better things to do and wanted to leave.The woman gazed lovingly at her display. “These figures are reminders to peoplethat magic is in the world all around us.”“No, it’s not,” Jax said.She did not look at all pleased. Alex was beginning to worry.“Why, of course it is,” the woman said with a jovial chuckle. “We may not beable to see it, but magic is very real. You just have to be attuned to it.” Sheheaved a sigh. “It would be a sad world if we didn’t have magic.”“Yes,” Alex said before Jax could say anything, “I can see why people would wantto collect these, but magic isn’t real.”Mary winked at him. “Oh, don’t let the magic go out of your life. That would bea sad thing, wouldn’t it, to become so cynical? We all have the capacity to tunein to magic if only we pay attention. We have but to open ourselves to it.”She lifted a delicate chain off a stand. “We have these crystals on necklacesyou might like for your lovely lady. They would be beautiful on her, don’t youthink? People say that the crystals help them feel the waves of magic emanatingup all around us.”Jax wasn’t listening. “These things are dead wrong,” she said to herself underher breath. Mary, showing Alex the necklace, didn’t seem to notice.Jax leaned in a little to peer intently at the items displayed on the secondshelf down. A card read “exclusive pieces.” When the woman saw Jax’s area ofinterest, she put the necklace back and turned her attention to the centerdisplay.Jax carefully pulled a figure out from the back.The woman looked pleased at the selection. “Ah, you have good taste.”Jax lifted the figure, an acrylic casting of a nicely sculpted woman with longflowing hair and a simple white dress cut square at the neck.“Woman of mystery,” Mary said softly.Jax looked up. “What?”“They call her the Woman of Mystery.”“Is that right?” Alex put in, trying his best to sound cheery. He wanted out ofthe shop. He could see how quietly upset Jax was getting. “Well, we—”“She’s an ancient figure.” The woman leaned a little closer. “I’ve owned thisshop for twenty-seven years and I rarely come across examples of this particularpersonage.”“Twenty-seven years,” Alex said. “Isn’t that something.” He saw Jax cast him asidelong glance.“Yes, that’s right. In that time I’ve seen the Woman of Mystery offered for salein a few different forms. Always fine pieces, though, like this one. I like tokeep one in the shop. That distinctive dress is a hallmark of the Woman ofMystery. It’s how you can identify her.”“Really,” Alex said, paying more attention to Jax.“Yes.” Mary sighed. “Not a lot of people seem to be interested in collectingher. I usually end up having each figure for quite some time before they sell,but I still can’t resist always getting another so that I always have one instock.”“Why don’t people usually collect this piece?” he asked.“Maybe because so little is known about her. I know a great deal about all of mybetter pieces, but even I am not sure of her powers.”“Her powers?” Jax asked, looking up sharply.“Yes,” Mary said. “It’s not known if she’s a sorceress, a white witch, or someother figure of mysterious magic. For that reason she’s always called the Womanof Mystery. I know her when I see her—I recognize her by that dress and her longhair. I’ve never seen her called by any other name, except by people who don’tknow her.”“What do you mean, ‘know her’ ? ” Jax asked, heat evident in her tone. “Howcould anyone possibly know her?”The woman reverently lifted the small statue from Jax’s hands.“The figure was originally found in a few very old books. Very old—and they werefrom different places. Though she looked somewhat different in each of thebooks, the plates in those books always depicted her in this dress.” Mary ran afinger along the neckline of the dress. “Always white, always cut square at theneck. That’s how I know her as the Woman of Mystery when I see her. She’s veryspecial.”“Why?” Alex asked, caught up in the story.The woman’s smile broadened at having interested customers. “Well, she’smysterious. No one knows her origin or who she is.And, like I said, no one knows her powers. But she has them, that much is sure.”“How do you know that she’s even supposed to have powers?” Alex asked. “Maybethose pictures were of a queen, or a famous woman from the time—a saint, apatron of the arts, something like that.”“Alex,” Jax whispered, “can we go, please?”Mary was talking and didn’t hear Jax. “What little is known from those ancientbooks is sketchy, however they do say that she had great power, though theynever say what those powers were. Some translations hold her in reverence, whileothers indicate that she was greatly feared.” Mary sighed. “She’s a woman ofmystery.” Her smile turned sly. “But she has magic.”“I don’t see how you can say that,” Alex said.The woman peered into his eyes for a time. “I know, because people are afraid ofher. I have customers who collect figures of every sort—even some of the mostfrightening wizards. Not a lot of those people, though, will have her in theircollection.”“Superstitious nonsense,” Alex said. “If they don’t know anything about her, whywould they be afraid?”The woman shrugged. “I don’t know. To tell you the truth, she’s my favorite.”She gazed proudly down at the statue as she turned it in her hands. “For as longas I’ve owned the shop, the Woman of Mystery has always been my favorite.”She at last remembered herself and lifted the statue out to them. “Are youinterested in having a Woman of Mystery in your life?”Jax, looking a little ashen, deliberately turned away.Alex already had a woman of mystery in his life, but he didn’t say so. “Possiblyanother time.”The woman smiled sadly. “I understand. A lot of people are afraid of her.”“I’m not afraid,” Alex said, defensively.“Good.” The shop owner set the figure back on the shelf, where a littlespotlight shone on it. “The Woman of Mystery needs friends in this world today.”“Alex, I want to go,” Jax whispered again, more insistently this time.Alex put a hand on her back, reassuring her, letting her know that he’d heardher.“Well, thanks for your time, but we have to be on our way.”Alex had to hurry to catch up with Jax.“What’s wrong?” he asked as he leaned toward her. She didn’t answer as shemarched on through the halls.“I don’t want to talk about it.”“Jax, what’s the matter? Are you all right?”“No, I’m not all right. That was an awful place.”“What do you mean it was awful?”“They have everything all wrong, yet in some of it I can see the specter of itsorigin.”“All right, but why are you letting that get you so upset?”“Because they have the trappings but not the humanity behind it all. It’s afixation on the wrong things. Those things don’t care about the life behind themagic. They have a wizard waving a stupid wand to lift a dog, while the realman, the real wizard, would touch someone who is suffering and lift a burdenfrom their heart. Instead, they show people like game trophies on display.”“But they mean no harm, Jax. They’re just knickknacks.”“It’s more than that.”“Like what?”She halted abruptly and turned to gaze up at him as if pleading not merely forunderstanding, but for her very life.“Don’t you get it, Alex? Don’t you see what was lost? Can you begin to imaginethe wonder of what it must have been? People here can’t remember it, yet theycan’t forget it. After all this time this whole world still longs for it, stillmourns what they lost. It was such a remarkable, magnificent, glorious part oflife that they ache to have it back, even though they don’t remember what itwas.”“But that’s past. If it really was lost, as you say, what difference does itmake now? We are who we are.”She tapped a finger against her chest. “The difference it makes is that it’sgoing to be my world, too. That’s going to happen to us. We’re going to lose itall, just as the people here lost it all. The wonder this world misses we have,but we’re going to lose it just so a few people can seize power for themselves.Everything we have is going to be taken from us. It’s all going to be destroyedat the cost of millions of lives just so a few people can grab power.”It was heartbreaking to hear the anguish in her voice and to see the torment inher eyes.Alex put a hand on the side of her neck and with a thumb wiped away a tear as itran down her cheek.When another tear followed, and then another, he leaned back against the insidecorner of a projecting wall of a shoe store and pulled Jax into his shelteringarms.Once in his protective embrace she dissolved into tears. He tightened his armsaround her as she wept softly.Alex glanced down the hall at the shoppers going about their day. Most didn’tnotice Jax and Alex. Those who did thought that they were simply a couplehugging in a nook—not all that uncommon in a mall. The passersby were politeenough not to stare.“Jax, listen to me,” he said in a quiet but firm tone. “The people you’refighting are coming here because they need something. We’re not going to letthem get what they need. We’ll stop them, then the people in your world willhave a chance.”“You don’t know these people, Alex,” she said as she wept. “I couldn’t begin todescribe their brutality. If we don’t find out what they’re after, then thepeople in my world will lose everything. I’m only one person with no powerhere.”He ran a hand down the back of her head. “Jax, we’ll stop them. That’s why youcame here. That’s why you found me. We’ll stop them. I’m not going to give up orlet you face it alone. I’ll help you. We’ll stop them.”“But I feel so alone, so homesick. . . . And I can’t ever get home.”“I know,” he whispered as he held her.Her fingers finally tightened on his jacket, gathering it into her fists. “I’msorry,” she said through tears, “forgive me.”“You don’t have anything to be sorry for.”“Yes, I do. So many people are counting on me. So many people need me to bestrong. Sometimes, though, I’m afraid that I’m not strong enough for them. I’mterrified that I’ll fail them.”Alex smiled despite how much it hurt his heart to see her miserable. “Jax, if Ihad to pick one word to describe you, it would never be ‘weak.’ ” He rubbed herback as she quieted a little. “We’ll figure it out. We’ll stop them. Whateverthey came here to do, we’ll stop them. I promise.”She nodded against his chest, content to be there for the moment, content to bein the shelter of his arms, relieved for the moment not to have to face a worldthat was alien to her.Something about the way she clung to him told him that she wasn’t used to evergetting that kind of protective comfort, of ever having the shoulder of afriend, or anyone who would simply put an arm around her.Something told him that she also wasn’t used to ever showing weakness of anysort. He couldn’t imagine the strength it took to be in an alien world, to knowthat you couldn’t get home, and be able to remain as composed as she usuallywas. Alex didn’t know how long he would be able to maintain his cool under thatkind of stress.“Thank you, Alex, for being strong, for reminding me to be strong.”“That’s what friends are for—to be strong for you when you need a moment to findyour own strength.”“I guess I never had a real friend before.”“You haven’t?” When she shook her head against him, he said, “Well, you have onenow. Sometimes, one is all you really need.”“Tell you what,” he said after a time. “How about if I take you to meet yourfuture mother-in-law.”That made her laugh. It was a good sound, as beautiful as everything else abouther.“All right,” she said, sniffling. “Let’s go meet Mom.”"},{"pageContent":"27.IT WAS EARLY AFTERNOON when they arrived at Mother of Roses in the older sectionof Orden. As was his custom, Alex found a parking place on a hill and at the endof a block so that if he had to he could let the car roll to get it started. Thespot was only a few blocks from the hospital.He cocked the wheels against the curb, set the brake, and then turned to Jax.“We can’t take weapons into this place.”“They won’t see my knife.”“They don’t have to see it. They have technology that detects metal. The machinewill set off an alarm if we have any weapons on us.”Jax sighed. “We have ways of detecting weapons, too.”“I have to leave my gun here. You have to leave your knife.”“Knives,” she said.“How many do you have on you?”“Three.”“Well, you have to leave them all here.”She didn’t appear to like the idea one bit. “Without my knives I can’t defend usas well.”“I understand, but we have to go through the detector in order to be allowed into see my mother. If we set off an alarm they won’t let us go in, period. Worse,if they find the kind of knife on you that I saw the last time, then we’re goingto have problems we don’t need.”When she hesitated he asked, “Do you want to wait here? I can go alone and seeif my mother can tell me anything. You could wait here until I—”“No,” she said emphatically. “Your grandfather’s place is gone, you don’t go tothat gallery anymore, and you’ve left your house. Not being able to find you atplaces they know—the patterns of your life abruptly changing—may spook them intochanging their plans. You come here regularly. They could be watching the placeto find out where you are. I have to be there to protect you.”“All right, but since we have to go unarmed let’s try to make it as quick aspossible. If my mother is out of it, then there’s no need to stay anyway; shewon’t answer anything when she’s in that state.“I’m hoping, though, that if she sees you with me that might draw her out. I’mhoping that you might have a positive influence.”Jax frowned. “Why would that make any difference?”“She’s my mother. You’re going to marry her baby boy. She’ll want to wring yourneck.”Jax smiled as she hooked a stray lock of wavy blond hair behind an ear. “Maybeyou’re right that a new face will get her attention. Maybe I can help get her totalk.”“I sure hope so, since we’re pretty much in the dark and we need some kind ofanswers. I really don’t want to have to come back every day until she’s awareenough to talk to me. Sometimes that can take months.”“We don’t have months. With the things that have been happening, I’m not evensure that we have days.”Alex let out a sigh. “Let’s hope she can tell us something, then.”He wrapped his gun, safely in its holster, in one of the old T-shirts he kept inthe truck. He used them as rags for cleaning brushes when he went on paintingexcursions to the countryside. He reached down and stuffed the bundle under thedriver’s seat where it would at least be out of sight.He had also stashed nearly all of his money farther back under the seat. Hedidn’t like walking around with large quantities of cash, so he had placed itbeneath the carpet in a depression in the floor.When he looked up, Jax handed him three knives. He wondered where she’d beenkeeping them.Two of the knives, with leather-wrapped handles, were in simple but well-madebrown leather sheaths. The third sheath was a fine-grained black leather,trimmed in silver that matched the knife’s silver handle. Elaborate, beautifullyengraved scrollwork decorated the silver handle. Not wanting to take the time toadmire it, Alex hurriedly rolled the three knives up together in another oldT-shirt from the bag on the floor behind him and stuffed the bundle under thepassenger seat.“What about your pocketknife?” she asked.“It’s more of a common tool. It doesn’t look scary like those knives youcarry—especially that silver one. They don’t want anything that could be used asa weapon going into the hospital, so I have to give them my pocketknife and keysfor safekeeping when I visit.“I’ve been coming to visit my mother for years. I know most everyone who workshere. This isn’t a place like when we went shopping for clothes where there werestrangers coming and going all the time. I know most everyone here.”Jax looked at him out of the corner of her eye. “That’s all the more reason tobe careful.”“You said that Cain’s people don’t know enough yet and they’re just watchingme.”“These people are killers, Alex. I’m only making guesses about what they’redoing and what they may be thinking. We can’t count on that assumption. I couldhave it all wrong.”“All right, I get it. We still have to worry about getting our necks broken.”“We should be so lucky if they catch us.”Alex cast her a suspicious look. “What do you mean?”“They only break people’s necks when they don’t have the luxury of time and theperson isn’t important enough to warrant closer attention.”“What do they do if they have time?”“Any number of things,” she said. “They’re pretty inventive.”Alex wondered why she was being evasive. “What do you mean?”Jax looked away, staring out the window for a time. She finally turned a seriouslook on him.“One of the things Sedrick Vendis likes to do to get people to talk is to hangthem up by their wrists, stretched up high enough so that they can just barelytouch the ground with their tiptoes. Suspended by your wrists like that, youhave to stretch on your toes to take some of the weight off your arms in orderto breathe. It’s an agonizing effort to pull air into your lungs. After a shortwhile, if you don’t use your toes for support, it’s impossible to breathe.“I’m told that it feels rather like you’re drowning. You struggle for everybreath as you slowly suffocate. It takes all your strength and effort to helpkeep enough weight off your arms so that you can get each breath. As you becomeexhausted, panic sets in, heightening the terror of it.“After a night like that, alone, unable to sleep, having great difficultybreathing, exhausted from the effort of taking enough weight off their arms sothey can get each breath, people are only too eager to tell everything theyknow, eager to believe that if they cooperate they will be let down.“Talking, though, doesn’t do them any good. Once the person has confessed allthey know, they are of no further use. Strips of skin are peeled down their backand left hanging to attract animals. Birds, ravens especially, will clean themeat right off the exposed ribs. Maggots start growing in the exposed fleshwhile the person is still alive.“Dehydration, shock, blood loss—it’s not a pretty way to die, nor is it fast.Unless, of course, they grant you mercy and break your legs so that you can’tsupport your weight. Then you suffocate and death comes quickly.”Alex didn’t know what he had been expecting, but it was nothing like this. Hecouldn’t have imagined such a thing.He had to remind himself to breathe. “I can’t imagine anyone being that inhuman,that barbaric.”“Then I won’t tax your imagination by telling you the things they do that areworse.” Her brown eyes turned to focus on him. “You think about that before youlet yourself get caught.”Alex hadn’t been thinking about not getting caught. He’d been thinking onlyabout not letting them catch her. That was the thought that truly terrified him.He finally took a full breath. “Jax, I’m sorry. . . . I shouldn’t have askedsuch a question.”He wiped a hand back across his face. He felt hot and a little sick to hisstomach.“I didn’t mean to sound angry at you for asking,” she said. “I’m angry at thepeople who do these things. You were right to ask—after all, it’s you they’reinterested in. You need to know what these people are really like. You need tounderstand the consequences of hesitation.”Alex clenched his jaw as his revulsion began to melt into smoldering rage.Her expression softened into regret. “I’m sorry I have to bring such things intoyour life, Alex. I’m sorry that I—”“You didn’t bring them into my life,” he said as he held up a hand to stop her.“The truth is the truth. Only a real friend would warn me about the kind ofpeople who are after me.”She smiled sympathetically, relieved that he understood.“Now,” he said, “let’s get in there and see if we can find out what thesebastards want from my world.”"},{"pageContent":"28.WITH A CASUAL BUT CAREFUL LOOK, Jax scanned the entire area before opening herdoor. He saw her appraise the same older couple walking up from behind them thathe’d noticed in the rearview mirror. Jax returned a smile when the couple smiledas they passed by. He noted that she trusted no one, not even an old coupleshuffling along the sidewalk.He wondered how she could summon a smile. He couldn’t.Alex tossed his jacket in the back seat and then locked the Cherokee. He checkedthe back hatch to make sure that it was locked as well. He didn’t like leaving agun in the truck that a thief could discover and steal, but he had no choice.Even though he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, they still couldn’t betaken into a mental institution.He wondered what he was going to do if they ended up having to leave the state.While he was licensed to carry in Nebraska, that license wasn’t valid in otherplaces, especially Boston, where the law took a dim view of people protectingthemselves.Alex had a very clear-cut belief about his fundamental right to his own life. Hedidn’t think that he should have to die just because a criminal wanted to takehis life. He had only one life and he believed that he had the right to defendit, simple as that. Ben had taught him how.In light of the kind of people they were up against, the kind of animals Jax hadjust told him about, he knew that he would rather risk facing a gun charge thanbe without a means of protecting himself, and more than that, protecting Jax. Hewasn’t willing to die because of the dogmatic principles of imperious publicofficials. It was his life, not theirs.From bits and pieces Jax had revealed, he knew that Cain would love nothing morethan to have her in his clutches. Alex knew that if they ever got their hands onher they would do those things that she’d said he couldn’t even imagine.Whatever those things were, he didn’t want to know. He was already angry enough.The limbs of the maple and oak trees lining the residential streets whipped backand forth in the gusty wind, filling the bright day with a rush of noise. Jaxhad to use one hand to hold her hair back off her face as they made their wayquickly along the sidewalk. She used the other to hold on to his arm, playingthe part of his fiancée.The storms had left the ground littered with leaves so that it looked a littlelike autumn, except that the leaves were green instead of bright colors. Hereand there limbs that had been torn off during the storms lay on lawns and at thesides of the street. The air had an odd, dry feel to it, as if hinting at thelooming change of season.Jax silently eyed the imposing front façade of Mother of Roses as they walkeddown Thirteenth Street. Many of the people climbing the broad bank of steps ontheir way to visit patients carried flowers or small boxes wrapped in brightpaper and decorated with ribbons.As they continued past the front entrance, without turning up the steps, Jaxfrowned questioningly up at him. “Family visiting the ninth floor can go in theback,” he told her. “It’s easier.”“The ninth floor,” she repeated in a flat tone.He knew what she was thinking. “I’m afraid so.”Around the side, the usual collection of service vans were crowded into thesmall lot that was really nothing more than an irregular blacktopped area offthe alley. The back of the building was virtually deserted compared with theactivity in front. That had always added to Alex’s feeling of alienation; hewasn’t visiting a normal patient, someone who would eventually get better and gohome, he was visiting someone who was imprisoned because she was a danger tosociety and would never be released.He guessed that in the back of his mind he had always felt a sense of shame overthat, not to mention anxiety that he might end up the same as his mother. Now hefelt a sense of anger, because it was seeming more and more likely that hercondition was the fault of strangers meddling in their lives, strangers whowanted something and didn’t care who they had to hurt to get it.Out of habit, as they took a shortcut across the grass and patches of bare dirtbeneath the shade of the huge oaks, Alex glanced up at the windows on the ninthfloor. He saw nothing more than shadows through the nearly opaque glass.“Are all the windows covered with wire?” Jax asked as she noticed him looking upat the top floor.“All the ones where we’re going.”When he pulled open the steel door at the back entrance, Jax paused and wrinkledher nose at the unfamiliar hospital smell. She stole a quick glance to each sidebefore stepping through the doorway.Inside, the smell of food mixed unappetizingly with the hospital smell. Thekitchens were back off the entrance area. Often-times smaller supplies weretaken to the kitchen through the back entrance.As he did at every other visit, Alex tossed his keys, change, and pocketknife ina blue plastic tub on a table to the side of the metal detector. His phone wastaking a bath in the outlet mall. As he had coached, Jax walked slowly throughthe metal detector. With her hands hooked in her back pockets, she lookedcompletely natural, as if she did it every day. Wearing jeans and the black topshe looked completely normal, as if she belonged with him. Except that he hadnever been with any woman as breathtaking as Jax.The older security guard, Dwayne, who never smiled at Alex, smiled at Jax. Shereturned the smile. As well as Alex was beginning to know her, though, herecognized that her smile wasn’t sincere.After Alex had gone through the metal detector, Dwayne reached in the tub as heusually did to hand back the phone.He looked up. “You don’t have your phone.”Alex snapped his fingers. “Must have left it in the truck.”The guard, with no phone to give back, simply placed the tub on a table againstthe wall that he used as a desk. He would return the keys, change, andpocketknife when they were on their way out. There were no other blue tubs onthe table against the wall. The rest of the empty tubs were stacked togetherbeside the metal detector. As was often the case during the day, Alex was theonly visitor to the ninth floor.At the steel desk beyond the metal detector he picked up the registry clipboardand blue plastic pen attached to the clipboard by its dirty string. He signedhis name, paused, and then wrote “Jax, fiancée” in the guest column.Doreen, who had been paying close attention to Jax, took the clipboard from himand turned it around to see how he’d filled in the “guest” portion. Alex hadnever brought a guest with him when he went to see his mother.Doreen looked up with a grin. “Fiancée! Alex, I never knew. I’m so happy foryou.”Alex returned the smile and introduced Jax. They shook hands. Doreen seemedunable to look away from Jax’s mesmerizing eyes. Alex knew the feeling.“How long have you two been together?” the beaming Doreen asked.“It all happened pretty fast,” Alex said. “She just dropped into my life out ofthe blue. Surprised the hell out of me, to tell you the truth.”“Oh, that’s so exciting, Alex. When’s the big date?” she asked Jax.“As soon as we work out the details,” Jax said.Alex was relieved that Jax had handled the question with such simple grace.On their way to the elevator, Alex leaned close. “That telling-the-truth trickof yours works pretty well.”She gave him a smile at their inside joke. He noticed that she smileddifferently at him than she did at anyone else. There was something specialabout it, something he liked very much.When the green metal door of the elevator opened, Alex took a step in. Jaxbalked, her hand on his arm dragging him to a halt.“What is this?” she asked.Before anyone noticed them stopping, he put an arm around her waist and usheredher inside. “It’s an elevator. It takes us up to the ninth floor, where mymother is held.”She turned around the way he did and faced the front as the door glided closed.“I don’t like being locked in a metal box.”“I can’t really blame you, but it’s fine, honest. It’s just a device that goesup and down, nothing else.”“Aren’t there stairs?”“There’s a fire escape on the outside of the building, but you can’t use itexcept in an emergency. The regular stairway is kept locked to control access tothe ninth floor.”Jax tensed at every clunk and clatter of the elevator’s ascent through thebuilding. She only seemed to relax when it wobbled to a stop and the doorsopened.As she stepped out, her gaze swept the nurses’ station, taking in everything,noting the position of everyone working behind the counter. There were fournurses, three female and one male, plus a woman at the computer. Back down thehall Alex could see an orderly getting a mop and bucket out of a utility room.He was sure that Jax was also checking to make sure that she didn’t recognizeanyone.Standing at the high counter at the nurses’ station, Alex signed his name andwrote in the time. Not a lot of people visited the ninth floor. He saw hissignature from previous visits several places higher up on the sheet. He slidthe clipboard over and motioned Jax to step up to the counter.“You need to sign your name and write down the time,” he said under his breath.“Sign your name on the line below mine and copy the time I put in.”Alex watched her sign her name. He hadn’t known her last name before. When shehad finished he slid it back across the counter to one of the nurses on duty.The big, hunched orderly spotted the two of them through the large window in thepharmacy and came out to greet them.“Alex, what have we here?” Henry broke into a rare grin as he stared at Jax.“Henry, this is Jax, my fiancée. Jax, this is Henry.”She didn’t blanch at the size of the man the way most people did. “Nice to meetyou, Henry.”Henry smiled at the sound of his name coming from her lips. “I had begun toworry about Alex, but I can see now that he was just waiting for the right womanto come along.”“You have that right,” Alex said. Eager not to be pulled into a“How’d you two meet?” conversation, he changed the subject. “How is my motherdoing?”Henry shrugged. “Same. You know the way she is. At least she hasn’t been causinga ruckus lately.”“That’s good,” Alex said as he followed Henry to the solid oak door leading tothe women’s wing.In her sweep of the area, Jax noted a man—a patient—staring at them through thelittle window in the door to the men’s wing. She turned back and watched as theorderly pulled his keys out on the cable extending from the reel attached to hisbelt and then unlocked the door. He ducked and glanced through the window beforetugging open the heavy door.“Your mother was in the sunroom last time I did rounds. You two have a nicevisit.” Henry handed Alex the plastic key for the buzzer. “Ring when you’refinished, Alex.”Alex had probably heard the man say “Ring when you’re finished” a few hundredtimes. It seemed he should realize that Alex would know the routine.Jax glanced at the varnished oak doors to each side as they made their way downthe long corridor toward the sunroom. He knew that she was calculating everythreat, watching for any source of trouble. Of all the places that concernedhim, Alex didn’t really think this was a place they had to worry about. Still,Jax’s attitude was making him jumpy.“We’re locked in here?” she asked. “There is no way for us to get out on our ownif we have to?”“That’s right. If we could get out, then so could the patients, and they don’twant that. We have to go back out the way we came in. There’s a fire escape thatgoes downstairs on the side of the building,” he said as he gesturedsurreptitiously ahead to the fire exit, “but the door is locked. A nurse or anorderly would have to unlock it. There’s a stairway in the back of the nurses’station. It’s kept locked along with the elevator.”When they reached the sunroom, Alex spotted his mother alone on a couch againstthe far wall.She saw Alex coming. He could tell by the look in her eyes that she recognizedhim."},{"pageContent":"29.HI, MOM,” ALEX SAID in a sunny voice as he came to a stop before her.She was wearing powder-blue pajama pants and a flowered hospital gown tied inthe back. He sometimes brought her nice things to wear but she rarely wore them.She was seldom connected to reality enough to be aware of what clothes she hadput on, or to care. On the occasions when she had been aware, she had told himthat she was saving her good clothes for when she got out.Some of her lack of interest in what she wore, he knew, was her mentalcondition, but a large part of it was the result of the drugs. It was theThorazine syrup they gave her that left her so heavily sedated, largelyindifferent to what was going on around her, and made her shuffle when shewalked. It weighed her mind down and made her seem twice her age.Fortunately, they had arrived not long before she was due for another regulardose of medication. Alex had learned over the years that he had the best chanceof seeing her a little more aware when the drugs had started to wear off alittle before it was time for her next dose of medication. He often wonderedwhat she would be like, how much better she might be able to communicate, if shewere not on such powerful drugs. It was frustrating in the extreme not to beable to have a normal conversation with her.Alex had often asked the doctors if she couldn’t be taken off the Thorazine, orat least put on something less powerful. Dr. Hoffmann, the head psychiatrist atMother of Roses, insisted that in her case there was no other antipsychotic drugthat was as effective. He claimed that it was the only thing powerful enough tosuppress her violent psychosis. He said that it was all that was keeping hersomewhat human, keeping her from being a raving lunatic.Dr. Hoffmann had said that he was sure Alex wouldn’t want that for his mother,nor would he want to see her physically restrained twenty-four hours a day. He’dsaid that he was sure Alex would want her to have as much human dignity aspossible. The drugs, he said, were what made that possible.Alex had never been able to argue against that.His mother rose from the worn-out brown leather couch. She didn’t smile. Shealmost never smiled.She took in Jax with a quick glance and then frowned up at him. “Alex, what areyou doing here?”Alex was gratified that she not only remembered his name, but used it. Shealmost never did that. He wondered if maybe Jax was having a positive influence.He hoped so.“I came to visit you. I wanted you to meet—”“I told you to run and hide. Why are you here? You should be hiding.”“I know, Mom. You’re right. But I had to come here first.”“You should be hiding from them.”Alex gently grasped Jax’s elbow and guided her forward. He realized he hadbutterflies. He wanted his mother to like Jax.“Mom, listen to me. I want you to meet my friend. This is Jax. Jax, this isHelen Rahl.”Jax extended her hand. “I’m so very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Rahl,” she saidwith a warm smile. “Now I know where Alex got those penetrating gray eyes ofhis.”His mother looked down at the hand for a moment, then took it. She put her otherhand over the top in a less formal manner.“You are Alex’s friend?” she asked without releasing Jax’s hand.“I am. We’re good friends.”“How good?”Jax smiled. It was a broad, genuine smile. “I care for Alex a great deal, Mrs.Rahl. That’s the truth of it.”“Jax is about as good a friend as anyone could have,” Alex put in.His mother stared at him a moment. “You should be hiding.” She pulled Jax closerby her hand. “You should be hiding, too.”“I think that’s pretty good advice,” Jax said. “As soon as we have a visit withyou I’m going to help Alex hide.”His mother nodded. “Good. You both need to hide.”Alex checked the other women in the sunroom. Most were watching the visitorsrather than the TV.“Mom,” Alex said, taking her arm, “we really need to talk to you. How about ifwe go to your room?”Without protest she let Alex and Jax hold her hands and lead her out of thebright sunroom into the darker corridor. Most of the women on the other side ofthe room watched them leave. A few were engaged in conversations with no one inparticular. One woman waved her arms in a loud argument with someone who wasn’tthere.Alex was relieved to see that his mother’s older roommate, Agnes, was watchingthe soap opera on the TV and didn’t follow them. While she never spoke, she didoften sit in the room and stare at him when he visited his mother.As they went through the doorway into his mother’s room, Jax first casuallyglanced in both directions down the hallway to see who might be watching them goin. A nurse, with an orderly to assist her, was at the far end of the hall,taking a tray of medications into the sunroom. Two orderlies coming down thehall in the other direction smiled as they went by.Alex guided his mother to a leather chair against the wall beneath the window.The nearly opaque glass let in only a frost of light. He and Jax sat on the sideof the bed, facing her.Before they could ask her anything, his mother rose from the chair and shuffledover to a small wardrobe. After a brief search she pulled a shawl from theshelf. When his mother draped the shawl over the polished metal square screwedto the wall that served as a mirror, Jax glanced over at him out of the cornerof her eye. He knew what she was thinking.“They look at me,” his mother muttered on her way back to them.“We know,” Jax said. “I’m glad that you know to cover your mirror.”His mother paused to stare at Jax. “You know?”Jax nodded. “They’ve been watching Alex the same way. That’s why we’re here. Wewant to stop them from looking at you, and from looking at Alex.”There wasn’t a lot of room between the bed and the chair against the wall. Asshe shuffled by, she rested a hand on Jax’s knee for support.She paused, then reached out and ran her thin hand down Jax’s wavy blond hair.“You have such long, beautiful hair.”“Thank you,” Jax said. “So do you.”As she sat, Alex’s mother reached up and ran a hand down over her own hair. “Ibrush it to keep it nice. I won’t let them cut it.”“I never let anyone cut mine, either,” Jax said.Satisfaction at Jax’s words brought a small smile to her thin lips. “Good.” Sheturned her gaze to Alex, as if she had forgotten he was there. “Alex, why aren’tyou hiding, like I told you?”“Mom, we need to know about these people who are looking at you.”“They ask me things, too.”Alex nodded. “I remember you saying that. That’s why we’re here. We need to knowwhat they want.”“What they want?”His mother, when she was lucid, or lucid after a fashion, became easilyconfused. Alex also knew that she wasn’t likely to remain aware of the realworld around her for long. If they didn’t get answers soon her mind would verylikely turn inward. On the other hand, he knew that they needed to be gentle intheir questioning or she would simply switch off. In years of trying, he wasrarely successful at walking the razor’s edge with her.There was also the problem that when they brought in her medication she wouldquickly get groggy. Her speech would begin to slur. Soon after, nothing she saidwould make sense. But that was the drugs, not her mind switching off. As far asAlex was concerned they simply needed to get answers before she couldn’t answer,no matter what the cause.“That’s right, Mom. The people who watch you want something.You told me about it before. You said that they want something from you. We needto know about that.”She touched a slender finger to her lower lip. “They ask about, about . . . theway they talk, it’s not easy to remember. I don’t understand what they want fromme. Always asking things, such confusing things. I don’t understand.”“I know. It’s confusing for us, too. But we need to know what they want fromyou. Please, Mom, just try to remember what it is they want to know.”When his mother only frowned, as if she didn’t understand what he was askingher, Jax leaned in, resting her forearms on her knees.“Mrs. Rahl, they probably say something like ‘Tell us about . . .’ and then theysay something. Remember? When they say, ‘Tell us about,’ what’s the rest of whatthey say?”His mother smoothed down her hair for a moment as she considered. She looked upsuddenly.“They say, ‘Tell us about the gate,’ I think. Is that right?”Jax didn’t so much as blink.“That can’t be it,” she whispered to herself as she slowly stood. “That can’t bewhat they mean.”“What?” Alex stood up next to her. As her gaze cast about distantly, he couldalmost see her mind racing. “What does that mean?”Jax didn’t seem to hear him. She abruptly looked back down at his mother, hervoice becoming insistent, almost demanding.“Is that what they say? ‘Gate’? Is that the exact word?”His mother shrank back into her chair a little. “The exact word?”Alex could tell that she was getting confused by the pressure to come up with ananswer. Seeing the grave look on Jax’s face, though, he decided not tointerfere.“Maybe you’re thinking that’s the word they meant,” Jax said, “but maybe that’snot the word they used. Could it be a longer word that made you think of theword ‘gate’?”She puzzled up at Jax. “Longer word? Maybe . . .”“Maybe what?” Jax pressed.Alex thought that Jax looked like she was about to grab his mother by the collarand haul her to her feet.His mother’s eyes brightened a little as she suddenly seemed to remember.“Not ‘gate.’ ‘Gateway.’ That’s the word.” She held up a finger. “They say, ‘Tellus about the gateway.’ ”Jax went ashen.“Dear spirits, have mercy on us.”Alex put a hand on the small of her back to steady her. “What’s wrong?”“I know what it is they want,” she whispered. Her fingers trembled as she pushedher hair back from her face. “Alex, we’re in a lot of trouble.”Just then the door opened. “Time for your afternoon medications, Helen.”It was a nurse. Alex was so rattled he couldn’t recall her name. She wasmiddle-aged, big-boned, and wore white from head to toe. Her white nurse’s hathad a small red stripe around the edge, but her crisp dress was pure white. Itwent to midcalf, where it covered opaque white hose. Her thick white shoes werespotless.“I don’t want them!” Alex’s mother shouted.“Now, now, Helen,” the woman said as she came closer, “you know that Dr.Hoffmann wants you to take your medications so that you’ll feel better.”“No! Leave me be!”The door opened again as Henry pushed his way in. He saw Alex’s mother wavingher arms, trying to keep the nurse at bay.“Helen, you be nice, now,” Henry said. “You don’t want to be making a ruckus infront of your nice visitors.”Alex’s mother sometimes tackled the nurses when she got the chance. The orderlywas there to make sure that that didn’t happen. Alex considered taking themedication from the nurse and giving it to his mother himself so that maybe shewouldn’t become so agitated that Henry would have to intervene.“We won’t be a minute, Alex,” the nurse whispered to him.Alice. That was her name. “Thanks, Alice. I understand.”He watched Jax out of the corner of his eye as she moved out of the way so thatAlice could squeeze in between the bed and the chair. He was worried about Jax.Alex wanted Alice and Henry out of the room so that he could find out why Jaxhad become so upset at hearing the word “gateway.”Henry looked embarrassed to have to intrude and cause a scene. “I’m sorry,Alex,” he said as he came closer. “We’ll be out of your way as soon as we makesure she takes her meds.”Alex nodded, moving farther down the bed, trying to give the nurse room. As shestepped closer she held the tray up out of the way, in case his mother took aswing at it.Jax, deep in thought, turned away. Upon hearing the word “gateway” she’d saidthat she knew what they wanted. Alex wanted to know what she’d figured out, whatthis was all about. He wanted to find out what had her so upset and distracted.Whatever it was, it appeared that they had found the answer they’d come for.“Leave me be!” his mother yelled, snatching for the tray.“Come on now, Helen,” Alice said, holding it out of reach, “settle down.”The next time Alex glanced over, he saw Henry with a syringe held partially outof sight. He knew that the orderlies sometimes brought a syringe along when theythought there was the possibility of trouble. They’d told him in the past thatthey would rather give his mother a shot when she became violent than try torestrain her physically and risk hurting her.“I told you before, Alice,” his mother yelled, “I don’t know anything about agateway!”Jax looked over sharply.As she did, Henry snatched her by the hair. At the same time he stabbed thesyringe into her rump. Before she knew what had happened or could react, hejammed the plunger home.Alex was already diving over the corner of the bed toward the man. Henry turnedand swung a meaty fist at him but Alex blocked the blow with his forearm as hedove inside the man’s defenses.Behind him, as he crashed into Henry, the nurse swept another syringe off thetray she had been holding up out of sight and rammed it into Alex’s behind. Alexfelt the hot stab of the drug cocktail being injected into his backside as Aliceshoved the plunger all the way into the syringe. Having his hands full withHenry, he hadn’t been able to turn in time to stop the woman.Jax landed a full-force side kick in the woman’s ribs, sending her flying. Aliceknocked his mother back into the chair before crashing headlong into the wall bythe headboard. The tray clattered against the floor. The lamp attached to thewall broke off as she snatched it for support on her way down. The bulbshattered with a pop, sending glass everywhere.As he struggled with the big man, Alex saw Jax reach for a knife at her waist.There was no knife there. She faltered, stumbled, and then started to go downeven as she tried to swing at Henry. She missed by a mile.Alex was lost in rage. Grappling with the powerful orderly, he growled in furyas he swept a leg around behind the man’s legs to take him off his feet. Itupended Henry and they both went down, Alex on top of him. They hit hard, Henryon his back. Alex followed up immediately with a blow from his elbow thatcrushed Henry’s nose.Henry cried out in pain. Out of the corner of his eye Alex saw another orderlycharging into the room.Alex tried to swing his fist as the second man jumped him and swept an armaround his neck, but his own arms were tingling and going numb. They wouldn’trespond to his wishes. He tried harder. When Henry punched him in the middleAlex reflexively rammed his knee up into the man’s groin. Henry cringed in pain.Alex struggled to get up, but the second man at his back had him securely by theneck.Out of the corner of his eye Alex saw Jax trying to crawl toward him to help.Alice planted a white shoe on Jax’s neck, pinning her to the floor. Jax moved asif she were mired in mud. She cried out his name, but it came out as a slurredmurmur.The world began to blur. Everything looked small, as if it were at the distantend of a dark tunnel. Alex yelled Jax’s name, but only a whisper made its wayout.His fingers found hers, then. Both of them held on for dear life as the roomdimmed.Alex felt himself being engulfed by thick, tingling blackness. It was allhappening too fast.His last thought, before thought ceased to exist, was of Jax, of the terror inher eyes."},{"pageContent":"30.ALEX DIDN’T REMEMBER OPENING HIS EYES. He didn’t remember waking. He merelybecame gradually aware that he was awake. After a fashion.Everything looked soft and fuzzy, unreal, distant, dim. He could hear snatchesof sounds but he didn’t know what they were. Figuring out what the sounds weredidn’t strike him as at all important.He was aware of the world all around him, but it seemed far away, not somethinghe was a part of. He was alone . . . somewhere else.His whole body tingled in a thick, numb, twilight way.With the way that everything seemed less than real, it occurred to him that hemight actually be asleep and only dreaming that he was awake. He couldn’t decidewhich was true. He didn’t know how to find the solution to such a puzzle.Try as he might, Alex could not, simply could not, form a complete, coherentthought.Fragments of ideas, bits of things that seemed as if they might be important,floated beyond his mental reach. He couldn’t pull them in, couldn’t make thosefragments come together into a complete thought. He knew that he should be ableto, knew what he wanted to do, but his mind wouldn’t make it happen. He couldnot exert enough willpower to bring himself to think.It felt like his brain was shut off. He struggled to form a complete sentence inhis mind, but his mind could not pull anything together. He would start athought, but it would trail off into nothing as his brain simply failed tocomplete the task. He could not coax it to stay on track, to work, to think.Monumental effort didn’t help.Somewhere in the back of his mind his inability to form complete thoughts, tothink deliberately, was giving rise to a vague, distant, claustrophobic panic.Those feelings, even as they began to surface, sank back down into the blackdepths of indifference, never to fully surface, leaving only fuzzy emptiness.The panic somewhere inside him could not manifest itself into something solidenough to concern him.Alex wanted to be angry, but there was nothing there to form anger.Every time he struggled to feel emotion, he only fell back into feeling nothing.He turned his dim perception away from the futile effort and realized that hewas sitting in a chair. He tried to get up, but his body didn’t respond. Withgreat effort he looked down to see his hand resting on the arm of the chair. Hetried to lift it, but it only levitated a few inches. He couldn’t make himselfcare enough to accomplish the simple task.He squinted, trying to make out the fuzzy white shape not far away, trying tounderstand what it was doing.“You awake, Alex?”He thought it was a woman’s voice.Answering was too unimportant to even try.“I’ll have your bed made in a jiff. Then I’ll let you be so you can get yourrest.”That was what she was doing: making up a bed. She was tucking in sheets. Justgrasping that much of the mystery around him felt like a profoundaccomplishment, but the accomplishment failed to be satisfying.He didn’t know if he knew the woman in white. He couldn’t make himselfconcentrate on her face long enough to tell. His gaze kept sinking to the floor.The gray swirls in the linoleum echoed his thoughts.He wanted to break down in tearful despair at not understanding any of it, butthere was nothing in him that knew how to cry, so he could only sit and stare.“I’ll let the doctor know you’re awake. I’m sure that when he makes his roundshe’ll want to stop in and see you. Okay, hon?”The woman came closer. She pulled a tissue from the box on the windowsill, thenleaned toward him and wiped the side of his mouth and chin.“That better?” she asked as she threw the tissue in the wastebasket beside thechair.Alex wanted to say something, but nothing came to mind.She touched his shoulder sympathetically before moving away. The square of lightdarkened. He wondered distantly if maybe she had gone out and shut the door.Snippets of things echoed through his head, fragments of conversations, flashesof sights. He sat unmoving as the obscure turmoil tumbled inside him.He wondered where he was and how he had come to be there. He couldn’t think itthrough, couldn’t come up from the depths toward the distant surface. He wantedto get up out of the chair, but it seemed too monumental a task.The world kept going dark. Each time he again became aware, he realized that hemust be nodding off.As he sat staring, going in and out of consciousness, the daylight behind himgradually went dark.“Alex?”It was a man’s voice. Alex lifted his head a little and realized that he musthave been asleep again. He blinked slowly, trying to clear his vision. It tookgreat effort to blink, but it didn’t help.The man leaned down toward him. “Alex, hi, how are you doing?” The man had aclipboard in one hand. A stethoscope hung around his neck. He had on a whitecoat and a blue tie. Alex couldn’t muster the will to look up enough to see theface.The man picked up Alex’s hand and shook it. Alex was too limp to participate.“I’m Dr. Hoffmann, Alex. I’ve met you before. Remember? In the past we’vediscussed your mother.”Alex didn’t remember much of anything. He remembered that he had a mother, buthe couldn’t remember what she looked like. The effort to remember details abouther was simply beyond his ability. He could do little more than stare atnothing.“Well, I can see that you’re still pretty out of it. It’s the Thorazine. After awhile, when you get a little more acclimated to your medication, you’ll be ableto function better. You won’t sleep so much, either.”As Alex finally managed to turn his eyes up, the man smiled. He looked nice.Alex hated him. At least, he guessed that maybe he hated him. Somewhere insidehe wanted to hate him, but he couldn’t feel any hate. He couldn’t feel anything.“Best thing to do is just take it easy for now, maybe get up in bed and take anap. You’ve been through quite an ordeal, from what I’ve heard.”With all his strength Alex managed to say, “What?”Dr. Hoffmann looked down to search through his papers. He lifted a page on hisclipboard, then another.“Well, from what I’ve been told and from this report, you became violent,apparently convinced that the staff was trying to harm your mother. Seems youhurt one of the orderlies, Henry, pretty badly. Alice was shaken up as well.”Alex remembered only foggy flickers of a fight. He thought that he rememberedbeing afraid—not afraid for himself, but afraid for someone else.“The staff here would never hurt your mother, Alex, or any patient, for thatmatter. They’re dedicated to helping people who are ill.”The man looked through the papers on his clipboard again. “With your mother’shistory, I’m afraid that your violent outburst is not entirely surprising.” Helet out a sigh. “Sometimes this sort of psychosis runs in families. In the caseof your family, it seems to lead to violent aggression.”Alex managed to lift his back away from the chair a few inches. “What about . ..”The old bed squeaked as Dr. Hoffmann leaned back against it. He clasped hishands together as he held the clipboard in them and stared down at Alex.“I’m sorry, Alex, but I don’t understand what you’re asking.”“Someone . . .”“Someone? Who are you asking about?”Alex didn’t know.“Your mother? Is that who you’re asking about? Helen is doing fine. She wasunderstandably frightened by the whole episode, but she’s fine. I saw herearlier. She’s resting comfortably. I don’t think she even remembers theincident.”Alex wanted to talk, but he couldn’t. He could feel drool running down his chinagain.“Here, let’s have your arm before I go, make sure you’re doing okay.”The doctor pulled Alex’s arm out and wrapped a black blood-pressure cuff aroundit. He put the stethoscope to the crook of Alex’s arm as he pumped the bulb inhis other hand. He concentrated, remaining still for a moment as he watched thedial, then turned the knob to release the rest of the air.“It’s pretty low,” he said as he wrote on the chart, “but that’s to be expectedwith Thorazine. We’ll need to keep an eye on it. As I said, you’ll acclimate tothe medication over time.”“Over time?”The man looked up from the chart. “Alex, I’m afraid that you’ve had a full-blownpsychotic episode that requires aggressive intervention. Considering whathappened, along with your family history . . .” He peered down at his chart,reading for a moment. “As a matter of fact, your mother was the same age,twenty-seven, when her psychopathic symptoms first manifested themselves.”Alex was dimly aware of his nearly lifelong fear of ending up like his mother.“Well,” Dr. Hoffmann finally said with a sigh, “let’s hope for the best. Often,with the right balance of medications, people like you don’t have to live withthe delusions and mania of such an illness.“But I’m afraid that you’re going to have to be here for a while.”“While?” Alex mumbled.“With the violence of the assault there is the possibility that charges will bebrought.”The doctor patted the side of Alex’s knee. “But I don’t want you to worry aboutthat at the moment.” He smiled. “If it comes to that we’ll ask the court to haveyou confined here, under our care. Jail wouldn’t be the proper setting for aperson with a serious mental condition. I’m afraid that it might be necessary tohave you placed here indefinitely—for your own safety, of course.”Alex was not able to form a response, but somewhere deep inside he felt adistant sense of alarm.With a thumb the doctor clicked the cap on the end of his ballpoint pen andslipped it into his coat pocket, all the while watching Alex.“Once you get used to your medication, once it settles you down, we’ll talk moreabout all of this. I’m going to want to know about the thoughts you have thatseem to control you and make you do the things you do.”There was a soft knock at the door. Someone with a tray poked her head in. “Am Iinterrupting, Doctor? It’s time for his medications.”“No, no, come in. We’re done for today.”A woman in white came close. She held the tray out as if she expected Alex to dosomething. He could do little more than focus his vision on it.“I think he’s going to need some help until he’s more used to the medication,”the doctor said.The woman nodded and set the tray on the bed. She held a small paper cup up tohis lips. Alex didn’t know what to do. It seemed so unimportant. With her otherhand on his forehead she tipped his head back and poured syrupy liquid into hismouth. She pushed his chin up with a finger, closing his mouth.“Swallow. That’s it. There you go.”When she removed her hand Alex’s jaw hung from the effort of drinking.“I’ve got rounds, Alex,” Dr. Hoffmann said. “I’ll check up on you in a day ortwo. For now try to take it easy and let the medication do its work, all right?”Alex sat unable to form a response as the man patted the side of Alex’s kneeagain before leaving. The room darkened a little when the door closed.The woman in white tipped another cup up. This time pills rolled into his mouth.She poured water from a third cup into his mouth. He swallowed to keep fromdrowning.“Good,” she said in a soothing voice as she swabbed his chin with a tissue.“Soon you’ll be doing it on your own.”Alex just wanted to go to sleep.“Soon,” she said, “we’ll have you talking up a storm.”"},{"pageContent":"31.ALEX SAT ON THE EDGE of the bed, exhausted from the effort of getting dressed.Every day they told him to get dressed. He wasn’t sure why he had to getdressed, but they had told him to, so he did.Whatever they told him to do, he did.He didn’t want to comply with their orders, but he didn’t have the will to fightthem and couldn’t think of a reason why he should. He knew that he had nochoice, no way out. He was at their mercy.At the same time, his imprisonment seemed unimportant. What difference did itmake? Confinement seemed trivial.The thing that concerned him the most, in fact the only thing that concernedhim, was his inability to think, to form complete, coherent thoughts. That wasthe most exasperating thing of all to him. He would sit for hours staringblankly at nothing, the whole time trying his best to form a sentence in hishead, but nothing would form. It left him feeling hollow, empty, and distantlyfrustrated.He knew that it was the drugs that were causing him to be unable to focus. Morethan anything he wanted out from under the mountainous weight of what thosedrugs were doing to him. He couldn’t envision a way to bring that about.One time when he had turned his face away, saying that he didn’t want themanymore, they had warned him that if he refused, if he became difficult, theywould strap him down to his bed and give him injections.Alex knew he didn’t want that. He knew that it was hopeless to fight them. Afterthey threatened to strap him down to his bed, he took his medication withoutfurther complaint.But more than anything, he wanted out from under the dark weight of thedrug-induced stupor.He had the sense that he had been confined for a couple of days. He couldn’tfigure out how many, but he didn’t believe it had been long. He vaguely recalledthe doctor coming again to talk briefly with him.The doctor had wanted to know about the things that Alex thought about. Alexwasn’t able to identify any thoughts. The doctor had then asked if Alex wasguided by voices. Alex asked what kind of voices. The doctor said that perhapshe heard the voice of the devil, or maybe even people from another world whohaunted him, wanted things, told him things. Alex had felt a vague sense ofalarm at the question, but he didn’t know what the doctor was talking about.The doctor had left, then, saying that he would return another day and theywould talk more about it then, adding that Alex was not going to be going homeanytime soon.Home. This was his home now.A fleeting thought flashed somewhere deep in his mind. It was about his mother.He felt that he needed to know if she was all right.Although the drugs suppressed any emotion, every waking moment Alex felt unsafein the place, even if it was only a vague concern, and so he felt that hismother was in some kind of trouble as well. He was completely helpless to doanything about his fears.When the door opened, he saw a big man lumber in.Alex looked up and saw white bandages over the middle of the face.“How you doing, Alex?”“Fine,” Alex answered by rote before he stared off at the floor again.“They put my nose back together for me. Said it’s going to be fine.”Alex nodded. He didn’t like the man standing as close as he was, but he couldn’timagine what he could do about it.“I wanted to come back to work as soon as possible and see how my patients aregetting along. Everyone here knows how much I love my work and how concerned Iam for the patients.”Alex nodded. In the back of his mind he felt a sense of danger in the pleasantvoice, the casual conversation.“The doctor said that you need to start going out and sitting in the sunroom. Hewants you to get accustomed to being around other people without becomingviolent—get used to fitting into society, I guess you could say. The onlysociety you’re ever going to see again, anyway.“But before I walk you down to the sunroom, I want you to tell me about thegateway.”Alex blinked slowly as he stared up at the man with the bandaged face. “What?”“The gateway. Tell me what you know about it.”“I want to see my mother.”“Your mother?”“I want to see her safe.”Henry, that was his name, Alex remembered.The big man sighed. Then he chuckled softly to himself. “All right, Alex, let’sgo for a walk and see your mother. Might do you some good to see for yourselfthat she’s fine—as fine as she’ll ever be, anyway. Then, after you see thatshe’s fine, I guess you’d better think real hard about telling us what we wantto know—if you want your mother to stay healthy.”“Please.” Alex managed to look up. “Don’t hurt her.”Henry leaned down toward him and smiled. “I guess that’s pretty much up to you,now, isn’t it?”Alex saw to each side of the bandage that both the man’s eyes were blackened. Afew of the pieces came together. Alex thought that he had done that to Henry,that he had hurt him, broken his nose. Try as he might, he couldn’t remember whyhe’d done it.Henry plucked a tissue from the box and wiped Alex’s chin. “Okay, let’s go seeyour mother.”Alex began slowly levering himself to his feet. He immediately got light-headed.Henry stuck a big hand under Alex’s arm to keep him upright.“The doctor said that your blood pressure is pretty low, so you have to becareful or you’re liable to pass out. Got to take it easy, he said, or else youcould get hurt.”Holding him up with one hand under his arm, Henry suddenly punched Alex in theabdomen.Alex doubled over from the shock of the blow and fell back into the chair. Hecovered the cramping pain with one arm, even though the ache seemed remote. Withhis other hand he gripped the arm of the chair. He looked up to see Henrygrinning.The big man reached down and pulled Alex to his feet again, then punched himtwice, both blows harder than the first.Alex crashed back into the chair, moaning.“Do you want to fight back, Alex? Take another swing at me?” He chuckled again.“Guess not. Thorazine takes the fight right out of you, doesn’t it? Makes itimpossible to work up any aggression at all. That’s what it’s for, you know.It’s to keep dangerous psychopaths like you from hurting anyone.”Alex was aware of the pain, but it was only a distant awareness. It seemedinconsequential. Even though he knew he should, he simply didn’t care. Hecouldn’t imagine how to care.“Thorazine represses aggression so well that you can’t even work up a littleanger when you need to. But I guess you know that.”Henry pulled him up, held on to him, and in rapid succession pounded his fistinto Alex’s middle. The blows staggered him back, but Henry was big and strongenough to keep Alex from falling.Alex couldn’t get his breath. He knew that he was struggling to breathe,gasping, but the drugs were preventing him from being able to react. It feltlike they were preventing him from being able to breathe as fast as he neededto.Henry released his hold on Alex’s arm and gave him another mighty punch. Alexcrashed back down into the chair, holding his middle. He couldn’t pull in abreath. He thought he might throw up. He sensed desperation in the way hegasped, but he felt like he was no more than a distant observer.With his nose all bandaged up, Henry was looking a little winded, too.“All right, let’s go for a walk and see your mother. Get it over with.”Alex couldn’t get up. He was having great difficulty drawing each breath. Henrypulled him to his feet and rammed a knee into his groin. Alex collapsed to thefloor, curled up, moaning.Henry watched a moment, pleased by the sight, then yanked Alex to his feetagain. He had great difficulty straightening up. Henry spun him around andshoved him, getting him moving toward the door. Alex tried to walk, but his legswouldn’t move fast enough to walk. He could only shuffle in a hunched posture.Henry followed close behind. “Don’t you think that this is over, Alex, or thatwe’re even. I haven’t even begun to get even.”"},{"pageContent":"32.AT THE HEAVY DOOR Henry pulled his keys out on the reel attached to his belt andused one of them to turn the lock. A few people looked up when Henry led Alexinto the central nurses’ station, but after satisfying their curiosity they wentback to what they were doing.Alex could see several women in the back, down the aisle between the tallshelves, either pulling file folders or putting them away. Beyond the widewindow in the pharmacy room a lone nurse worked at taking inventory. A couple ofother nurses behind the front counter were drinking coffee and discussing theirhome life, their conversation animated from time to time with laughter. None ofthem gave Alex and Henry any more than a passing glance.Alex felt invisible.He shuffled along, unable to move any faster, not caring if he did or didn’t. Hewanted to care, somewhere deep inside he desperately wanted to care, but hecould not bring forth concern. His mind was mostly occupied with the single,simple task of following Henry.He noticed the elevator, remembering that he used to use it when he left thehospital. He couldn’t entirely recall how he had come to be locked in the place,to be a patient with his own room. He couldn’t focus his mind enough to put thesequence of events together, to grasp it all. It was frustrating to be so in thedark about what had happened and how he had come to be there. Even thatfrustration, though, failed to rouse emotion.At the next locked door, Alex waited for it to be unlocked in order to go intothe women’s wing and see his mother, to see if she was all right. He followedthe burly orderly through the door and waited as he locked it behind them.He watched the light from the room up ahead reflect off the ripples in thepolished gray linoleum floor as he shuffled down the endlessly long corridor.Henry stopped to poke his head in one of the doors to the side.“She isn’t in her room,” he said before continuing on toward the sunroom at theend of the hall.When they finally entered the big, bright room at the end of the corridor,several of the woman clustered near the television looked up, but then went backto their show. There were a few other woman scattered around the room but Alexdidn’t pay any attention to them as he followed Henry.“Helen, you have a visitor,” Henry said.She was sitting in a plastic chair at a table, her hands nested in her lap. Shestared straight ahead, not seeming to hear the orderly.“Helen, your son is here to see you.”She looked up at the orderly, blinking slowly. When Henry pointed at Alex shelooked over. There was no recognition in her eyes. She didn’t know who she waslooking at.Alex knew that she, too, was on heavy medications to suppress her aggression. Heknew just how she felt in that regard. But he knew, too, deep down inside, thatwith her it was more than just the medication. There was something fundamentallybroken in her.Alex had wanted to know that his mother was all right, but once seeing that shedidn’t look hurt, his mind began sinking back into the meaningless static thatserved for mental activity.It occurred to him that maybe he should say something.“Mom, how are you?” His own words rang hollow in his mind. He knew they were theright words, but they contained no meaning for him. He could summon no emotionto pair with the words.She stared. “Fine.”Alex nodded. He didn’t know what else to say.“Satisfied?” Henry asked.Alex looked up at the man. “Yes. I want her to be well.”A smile broke out beneath the white bandages. “Good. You remember that. Youremember that you want your mother to be well.”Alex knew that Henry was threatening him but he felt no emotional reaction tothat threat. It was frustrating that he couldn’t find a shred of anger withinhimself.“Well,” Henry said, “now that we all know that Mom is fine, let’s get you backto your room. It won’t be long until it’s time for your medication.”Alex nodded.As he turned, he saw someone sitting not far away on a couch against the wall.She was wearing jeans and a black top, but it was her long blond hair that hadcaught Alex’s attention.It was Jax.Alex froze. He felt a rush of emotion welling up within him, coming close tobreaking the surface of awareness, but the too-distant feeling remained mired ina wilderness of nothing.Jax was sitting alone on the couch. Her hands rested limp at her sides. Herbrown eyes stared straight ahead. She didn’t seem to be aware of anything. Alexdistantly thought that she was achingly beautiful.Henry, who had noticed Alex stop and stare, grinned.“Good-looking woman, eh, Alex?”For the first time that he could remember, Alex felt the presence of the darkshadow of anger somewhere within.“Do you want to say hello?” Henry asked. “Go ahead. Might as well as long aswe’re here.”Alex shuffled closer and came to a stop before her.“Jax?”She looked up. She blinked slowly.Alex saw within those beautiful eyes a spark of recognition.That spark was layered over with the same numbing weight of drugs that he knewso well, the same drugs he hated, but he still saw it there.If Jax recognized him, and he was sure she did, she didn’t act like it, showingno more sign of recognition than had his mother.Alex realized that it had to be deliberate. She didn’t want to betray that sherecognized him. As drugged as she was, she was trying to protect him by notacknowledging that she knew him.“Well,” Henry said, “looks like she isn’t interested in a date.” He nudged Alexwith an elbow as he leaned a little closer. “Maybe she’d like a date with melater tonight after lights-out. What do you think, Alex? Think she might likethat?”Through the unfeeling haze, Alex knew that Jax was in great peril. He again feltthe shadowy presence of anger, but this time it was closer, darker, stronger,even if he couldn’t reach it, couldn’t connect with it.He managed to muster deception. “Maybe.”Henry chuckled. “Maybe she’d like you to tell us all about the gateway. Thinkso, Alex? Think she would be relieved if you did what we want?”“I suppose,” Alex said in a flat, distant tone, deliberately playing dumb. Itwasn’t at all difficult.Henry turned him and shoved him, getting him moving. As he shuffled away, Alexglanced back over his shoulder. Jax’s head didn’t move. Her hands stayed limp ather sides.But her eyes followed him.He knew the private, lonely hell she was in. He knew because he felt the sameway.If Alex was in a daze before, he was even more dazed as they made their way backacross the ninth floor to the men’s wing, to his room. He was beginning toremember pieces.He recognized, if distantly, that he had to do something.He knew that no one was going to show up to save him.He knew that he had to help himself or things were only going to get worse.Henry had made that clear enough. His mother was going to suffer, but the worstof it would be reserved for Jax.If Alex wanted to prevent that, he had to do something.“Here we go,” Henry said as they finally made their way across to the men’ssunroom. “You should sit here and enjoy the sunshine while you think thingsover.”“All right,” Alex said.The orderly guided him over to the couches against the wall. Alex sat withoutprotest. On the other side of the room men stared at the television. Alex staredat the floor.When he heard squeaking he looked over and saw that the squeak was coming fromshiny black shoes. “Snack time, folks,” the overweight orderly said as he pushedthe cart into the room.“You should have yourself a sandwich, Alex,” Henry said.Alex merely nodded.“And in the meantime, you think about things. You think real hard on the answerswe want because we’re running out of patience. Do you understand?”Alex nodded again without looking up.Henry handed him a paper plate with a whole-wheat sandwich on it and a plasticglass of orange drink from the cart. “We’ll talk later.”Alex nodded again without looking up. As he watched Henry walking away, he tooka sip of orange juice, holding the cool liquid in his mouth under his tongue ashis mind frantically tried to summon action. It was like trying to push the deadweight of a mountain.He ate a few bites of the tasteless sandwich to the sounds of contestants in agame show giving answers to questions. Frequently the television audience brokeout in laughter. The men watching didn’t react.Alex needed answers.Not at all hungry, he set down the plate with the sandwich. He sat for a timestaring at nothing, his mind hopelessly blank, feeling overwhelmed withfrustration at his inability to think.The only thing that he seemed able to keep in focus was the image of Jax. Theemotion connected to that image was buried somewhere deep within him.He finally got up and began making his way back toward his room, the whole waystruggling to reason out what he could do. But under the dampening fog ofThorazine, his thoughts would not crystallize. Shuffling his way down the hall,he knew that the drugs were preventing him from thinking of a way to fight back.From somewhere, realization suddenly seemed to be there. Being able to think wasnot the immediate solution, it was the problem. He’d been focusing on theproblem, rather than the solution. The real solution was to eliminate what waspreventing him from thinking: the drugs.In his room, he sat in the chair. Light coming in the frosted window behindslowly faded away to blackness. After a time he smelled food and heard thedinner cart being wheeled down the hall to the sunroom, where they fed thepatients. When one of the women from the cafeteria stuck her head in to remindhim that it was dinnertime, Alex only nodded. He wasn’t hungry.As he sat listening to the buzz of the overhead lights, he held tight to thecore of the real solution: getting off the drugs so that he could think. Heworked at that notion like a mental worry stone. He grasped that if he was tosolve anything, he first had to find a way not to take the drugs they gave him.After that, his mind would work.He didn’t know how he could manage such a thing. They made him take hismedication. They waited and made sure he took it. If he didn’t, they would forcehim. He couldn’t fight them off.And then, the answer was simply there.He had to somehow make them think that he had taken his medication. He had totrick them. But how in the world could he do such a thing?He sat for hours as the evening wore on, struggling mightily to come up with away to do it. If he didn’t somehow accomplish what he needed to do, Jax wasgoing to suffer.He wasn’t aware of the idea coming to him. But he realized that it had. Somepart of him, some inner will, held on to that solution for dear life so that itcouldn’t slip away from him.He knew that if he could pull it off, then without the drugs his mind wouldbegin to work and then maybe he would be able to come to his own rescue.He got up and turned on the smaller reading light over the bed, then shut offthe main ceiling lights. The smaller light gave off a muted illumination, but itwas plenty of light to see by, and it made the room dimmer than the hall. Thepartial darkness would help cover what he intended to do.Exhausted from the effort of plotting and adjusting the lights, he flopped backinto his chair to wait for the nurse to arrive with his evening medications.He nodded off twice before she arrived.He woke with a start when she knocked and announced “Medication time” in amusical voice. She was one of the nicer nurses, a top-heavy woman with at leasta dozen moles on her face and more on her plump arms. She always had a readysmile.“I have your medications for you, Alex.”Alex nodded and reached up for the cup of Thorazine on the tray before she had achance to wonder if he might need help.He tipped his head back as he poured the syrupy medication into his mouth, thenbrought his head back down, making a face as he swallowed. He crushed the papercup in one hand and tossed it in the wastebasket beside his chair.He hadn’t swallowed the medication, though. He held the Thorazine syrup in thehollow under his tongue.She held the tray out for him. He dumped the second cup with the pills into hismouth and immediately captured them under his tongue as well as he tossed thecup in the trash.The nurse yawned while she waited for him to wash down the pills. Alex had torepress his urge to yawn in sympathy with her as he immediately took the thirdcup with the water. He drank it down as he tipped his head back, pretending thathe was swallowing the pills with the water, and then as his head was coming backdown after swallowing the water, he used his tongue to push the syrup and pillsout and into the cup.Alex immediately crumpled the paper cup with the Thorazine and pills in it as hehad done with the previous two and tossed it in the wastebasket.“Have a good night, Alex,” the nurse said as she hurried away.Alex sat in the dimly lit room, unable to summon joy, exhilaration, or triumph.But he knew that when the drugs in his system began to wear off, he would feelall of those delicious things and much more."},{"pageContent":"33.BY THE NEX MORNING, Alex was noticeably more alert. While not entirely out fromunder the numbing influence of the drugs, he did feel as if he was coming out ofa long, dark sleep. He knew it would take more time for the drugs to get out ofhis system. Also, even though he had spit out the last dose of Thorazine, itwasn’t possible to spit out one hundred percent of it. At least he’d been ableto completely eliminate the pills.The first thing he did when he woke was to take the cup from the night before,the one with the medications in it, and crumple it up inside a paper napkin justto make sure that there was no chance the people who collected the trash wouldsee any syrup or pills and alert the staff.If anyone found out that he wasn’t being controlled by the drugs, they would puthim in physical restraints. These people were only posing as medicalprofessionals, after all. They were hardly interested in his well-being. Hedidn’t know how many of the staff were involved in the scheme, so he dared nottrust any of them. For all he knew, the whole place could be in on it.When a nurse came in with his morning dose of medications, Alex acted the sameas he had been acting for days—lethargic, uninterested, sleepy—and repeated histrick of spitting the Thorazine and the pills into the water cup and throwing itaway.Almost immediately after the nurse left, Dr. Hoffmann strolled briskly into theroom. Alex concentrated on sitting still and staring. He finally looked up,blinking slowly as he met the doctor’s gaze.“How are we doing this morning, Alex?”“Fine.”“That’s good to hear,” he said as he pulled the blood-pressure cuff from apocket.He wrapped the cuff around Alex’s arm and pumped up the bulb, then read the dialas he let air out. When finished, he pulled the stethoscope from his ears.“Just as I promised, you’re getting acclimated to the medication.” He wrote onhis chart as he talked. “Your blood pressure is coming back up. It’s a littlesurprising, but everyone reacts differently. You’re young and strong, so yourbody is handling it well.”Alex stared without answering.“Feeling any more alert?”“A little,” Alex said, trying to sound distant.The doctor’s face took on a serious set. “Good, because it’s about time for youto start answering questions. Some people are going to be arriving soon for avisit, and they’re going to want to talk to you.”“All right,” Alex said as if he didn’t care.“These people think it’s time for answers. They aren’t going to be as indulgentas we’ve been in the past.”Alex let his gaze wander to the floor. “All right.”“You had better be prepared to give them those answers or things are going tobecame rather unpleasant. Especially for other people. You don’t want that, now,do you?”“Please,” Alex mumbled, “don’t hurt my mother.”Dr. Hoffmann stood, sliding his pen into his breast pocket. “That’s going to beup to you, Alex. If you don’t want people hurt, then the easiest thing to do isto simply answer their questions. Understand?”Alex nodded.“Good.” He started away, then turned back. He stood near the door frowning as hestudied Alex’s face. Alex stared off without blinking, without moving.“I’ll see you soon,” he said at last.Alex nodded. The doctor tapped his palm against the doorframe for a moment as hewatched Alex, and then he was gone.Once alone, with the door closed, Alex paced. It felt good to pace, to move hismuscles. He also hoped pacing would help to work more of the drugs out of hissystem.Until he could figure out what to do he needed to avoid raising suspicions, sowhen it was time for lunch he shuffled down to the sunroom with the otherpatients. He ate about half of the beef-and-noodle casserole even though he wastoo excited at being able to think to be hungry. Afterward, he stayed in thesunroom for a couple of hours, sitting and staring and keeping up appearances ashe kept an eye on the staff, the whole while trying to come up with a plan.As he sat pretending to be in a stupor, he let anger course through him. It feltgood to be able to feel angry at the people doing this, to embrace that rage andfocus it.He was worried about his mother, but he was far more worried about Jax. She wasthe one from another world, so she was the one in the greatest danger. She hadsaid that she recognized people from her world, like Sedrick Vendis, and Yuri,the passenger in the plumbing truck that had almost run them down. It was likelythat some of these people would recognize her. Icy dread washed through him atthe thought of what they might do to her.Alex returned to his room, where he paced some more as he ached with worry forJax. He missed her. He missed being with her, talking to her, seeing her smile.He wanted her safe. He felt responsible because she wasn’t. He’d brought her tothe hospital and right into a trap.He returned to the sunroom when a woman from the cafeteria told him it was timefor dinner, and after dinner waited in his room for the nurse to bring hisevening medication. As before, he sat with only the reading light on and whenshe came in he repeated his trick of disposing of the medication.Not more than an hour later, when he was thinking that maybe he should go to bedso that no one would be suspicious, Henry showed up.“How you doing, Alex? Doc says that he told you about meeting some new people.”Alex only nodded.“Well, don’t just sit there staring, let’s go.”Alex hadn’t been expecting it to be this soon. He hadn’t come up with a planyet. He blinked slowly up at Henry. “What?”Henry huffed in irritation and marched over to haul Alex up out of his chair.“Come on. People are waiting.”Alex followed behind the orderly, shuffling along in imitation of the way he hadwalked when under the influence of the drugs. He had to force himself to goslow. Henry whistled to himself as he led Alex down the hall and through thenurses’ station.It was late, long after visiting hours, so there were fewer people on duty.Several of them talked about charts and changes to medication orders, payinglittle attention to Henry and his charge. They were cooking something on a hotplate sitting on a small counter at the head of the aisles with the charts. Itsmelled good, like chicken soup.Alex was puzzled as to where Henry was taking him. He did his best to make it aslow journey. Rather than go into any of the patient rooms, or to the sunroom,Henry surprised him by turning him in to the women’s bathroom.Alex couldn’t imagine what was going on, but he had to play along, not askquestions, and act uninterested. His only safety was in everyone thinking he wasdrugged. The bathroom looked almost identical to the one on the men’s side, onlyreversed. They passed the row of sinks and empty stalls. The place was deserted.At the back of the room Henry pulled out his keys and unlocked the door leadingto the showers.Alex could see that inside the entrance area it looked just like the men’s side,with benches bolted to the wall. The entire entrance was done in white tiles.The grout was old and discolored. Pipes, covered in what looked like dozens oflayers of white paint, filled one corner from floor to ceiling. The showers werearound a corner and Alex couldn’t see them.Henry shoved him through the doorway. Dr. Hoffmann was waiting in the entrancearea. There were a couple of other men there as well, orderlies, and Alice, thenurse.A man came out from around the corner. He was bigger than the doctor, aboutAlex’s size. He wore tan slacks and a beige shirt with a vertical blue stripedown the left side.He had the eyes of a predator. He moved like one as well.The hair on the back of Alex’s neck stiffened. He knew who the man was from thedescription Mr. Martin, the gallery owner, had given. It was the man who hadbought six of Alex’s paintings and then defaced them. Jax had also told himabout this man.He was Sedrick Vendis, right-hand man to Radell Cain.“This him?” Vendis asked.Henry nodded. “Alexander Rahl.”Sedrick Vendis glided close, until he stood almost toe-to-toe with Alex. Hestudied Alex’s face before gazing into his eyes. Alex didn’t like how close theman was standing. It was a violation of physical space intended to challenge andintimidate. He forced himself to stay still and act numb.Alex knew that, being this close, he could probably kill the man before anyonewould be able to react. He gave serious consideration to doing so. The ragewithin wanted him to act.But if he did, it wouldn’t help Jax. It was the wrong time and place. It wouldgain him nothing in the bigger picture. He had to use his head. At least now hismind was working.He blinked slowly, keeping his eyes out of focus as he stared at nothing, tryingto look completely passive.“Tell me about the gateway,” Vendis said in a quiet tone of undiluted threat.Alex shrugged, but didn’t answer.Vendis smiled. It was as wicked a smile as Alex had ever seen.“I’m not here to play games, as you will soon learn,” Vendis said, just asquietly, just as menacingly. “Come with me. I have something to show you.”“All right,” Alex said in a slur.He shuffled along behind Vendis, the rest of the people following behind Alex.As he rounded the corner, the long row of showerheads sticking from the whitetile wall came into view. Just like the men’s shower, there were no partitions.The showers were in one long, open room with a drain beneath each showerhead.Alex went numb with dread.About in the middle of the row, Jax, blindfolded, her hands bound together, washanging by her wrists from one of the shower pipes projecting from the wall. Shehad to stretch in order for her tiptoes to reach the floor.She was naked."},{"pageContent":"34.STANDING NEXT TO JAX was a man Alex instantly recognized. He was the burlypassenger from the Jolly Roger Plumbing truck that had almost run over Jax thefirst time Alex had seen her. He was still wearing the same dark, dirty workclothes.Jax’s clothes, the clothes she and Alex had bought together, lay where they hadbeen carelessly tossed to the side as they’d stripped her.The bearded man’s grin displayed crooked, yellow teeth. His dark eyes remainedfixed on Alex, giving him a meaningful look while putting an arm around Jax’swaist in a familiar manner. She flinched slightly at his touch. In her druggedstate she probably wouldn’t be able to understand it all, or to care a greatdeal.“Glad you finally made it for the show,” the pirate said as he reached over withhis other grimy hand and rubbed Jax’s bare belly. “We didn’t want to start in onthis fine bitch until you was here.”Alex could see Jax’s muscles tense at the man’s rough touch. She held herbreath.Alex put all his effort into keeping the rage off his face. It was a monumentaltask. More than anything, he wanted to kill everyone in the room and get Jaxfree. Most of all, though, he wanted to get his hands on the man who had his onJax.He knew, though, that if he did the wrong thing Jax was going to pay the price.He had stopped taking the drugs so that he would be able to think. That was whathe had to do. As Ben had always said, it was his mind that was the real weapon.“Now,” Vendis said, “I want you to tell me all about the gateway.”Alex didn’t reply. He simply blinked dumbly, as if he wasn’t sure what theywanted him to say.“Oh, I’m sorry,” Vendis said in mock apology, gesturing to the filthy man withhis arm tightly around Jax’s waist. “I forgot to introduce you. This fellow hereis Yuri. As it so happens, Yuri knows this young lady. In fact, she killed hisbrother. Isn’t that right, Yuri?”The look on Yuri’s face darkened. “Sure is. But I’m about to settle the score.”“As you can see,” Vendis said, “Yuri has a rather unsympathetic attitude towardthe young lady’s predicament. That’s why I invited him to come along. Men withgrudges tend to be much more focused on getting revenge.”Alex judged that he and Jax would have little chance to get away as long as shewas so heavily drugged. She wouldn’t be able to help him and she wouldn’t beable to run. Trying to carry her and fight off pursuers at the same time wouldnever work. He needed her at least partially alert in order to change the oddsenough that they would have any real chance.“All right,” Alex said in a slur. “Can I go now?”“I didn’t come here to have you play games,” Vendis snapped.“Don’t act stupid with me. We’re finished with all this nonsense of gentlepretense to coax answers forth. I’ve put up with games and the promises ofresults for long enough!“You are going to tell me what I want to know, or else Yuri here is going tostart cutting on her. Nothing fatal, you understand, but definitely disfiguringand, more importantly, agonizing. If you don’t want to cooperate and tell meabout the gateway, I can tell you from experience that she is going to quicklybecome a rather gruesome, bloody sight.”Alex shrugged. “All right.”Vendis glowered. “What do you mean, ‘All right’?”“Go ahead. Cut her up.”A curious smile came to Vendis’s face. “You want me to start cutting her up?”“If you want to,” Alex said.When the man’s frown returned, Alex went on, slurring his words slightly. “She’sdrugged. She won’t feel it. I know. I’m drugged the same way and I don’t reallyfeel much of anything or care. If you kill her, you will be doing us a favor.”“A favor?” The man looked truly puzzled. “What favor?”Alex shrugged. “She will die without really suffering. She won’t feel it much orcare. It will all be over.”Vendis stepped closer. His voice became louder. “You’re making no sense.”“I only know part of what you want. She knows the other part. Without the halfshe knows about the gateway, my half is of no use. If you kill her you will bedoing us both a favor because you will fail to get what you want from this worldand I won’t even have to feel sad about her death because, with the drugs, Ican’t feel sad.“The way she’s drugged, she won’t really feel it when you cut her, so go ahead.Cut her, let her bleed out and die. Then it will all be over and done with andyou won’t get any of what you want.”“You both will die, though. Die an agonizing death.”Alex blinked slowly. He wavered a little on his feet for effect. “If we are todie a horrible death, what better way? This drugged up, neither of us willreally feel it or care. That will be the end of it. Finished.”Vendis turned to the doctor. “Do these potions you gave them do as he says?”The doctor spread his hands. “The drugs are how we control them. It keeps themin a stupor.”“And she won’t feel it if we cut her? He won’t care?”“Well, not exactly. She’ll feel it.” The man cleared his throat. “But perhaps .. . not as much as you would like. It would be only a distant pain. She may cryout a little, but it’s as he says. She really won’t be that aware of the pain,or care. Being on the same drugs, he can’t feel any anger or sadness about it.The drugs’ actual purpose, after all, is to prevent patients from feeling eitherhostility or emotional distress.”Vendis ground his teeth before turning away from the doctor. He stalked to Jax.Yuri backed away.Vendis lifted the blindfold to peer into Jax’s eyes. They were half closed. Shedidn’t look like she was much aware of anything. Alex knew only too well how outof touch she was with what was going on.The thought crossed his mind that if what he was doing didn’t work, then itprobably was just as well that she was drugged. He ached for her and what shewas going through. He wanted nothing more than to break the necks of thesepeople, but he had to mask his anger if he was to have a chance to save her.Vendis reached out then, and viciously twisted her left nipple. She should havecried out. She didn’t flinch or try to pull away. She only hunched her back alittle in a dull response to the pain. No more than a whisper of a moan camefrom her lips. Her glassy eyes showed virtually no reaction.Vendis pulled the blindfold back down. He turned to see Alex staring off, hiseyes out of focus, not reacting. He let out an angry breath.“You are being paid for results,” Vendis growled at the doctor. “This is hardlyproducing results.”The doctor shrugged apologetically. “Well, I don’t think that this kind ofapproach can be expected to be compatible with—”“If you stop these potions you’re giving her,” Vendis cut in, “how long untilshe will be fully awake?”“Within twenty-four hours she would be largely back to herself,” Dr. Hoffmannsaid. “But I would respectfully advise that we not do that. Need I remind youhow dangerous she is?”“I don’t need reminders of anything from the likes of you.”The doctor swallowed at the look in Vendis’s eyes. “Of course not. I only meantto point out . . .” When he saw that his attempt at an explanation was onlydarkening the glower on Vendis’s face, he changed his approach. “With yourapproval, I could cut the dose enough so that she will be aware, yet still becontrollable. I think we can strike a balance that will work to our advantage.”“Will she be awake enough to scream her lungs out when Yuri starts cutting her?”“Absolutely. If we reduce the dose enough, absolutely.” The doctor fiddled witha button on his white coat. “I can adjust the dose to still take some of thefight out of her, but leave her awake and aware enough to feel the pain andscream when you cut her.”The smile returned to Vendis’s face. “Good. How long?”The doctor looked relieved to have been able to redeem himself. “She should bethe way you want her by tomorrow night at this time.” He gestured to Alex. “Whatabout him?”Vendis turned to study Alex’s face a moment. “If he is left like this, are yousure that he won’t care when she screams?”The doctor scratched his temple, then answered reluctantly. “He’s not bluffing.With as much Thorazine as we’re giving him he can’t bluff. With as much as we’regiving him he doesn’t have the ability to care about anything. I believe hereally would rather we kill them both right now while he’s drugged. He knows itwould be an easy way to go compared to what’s in store for them. Maybe it wouldbe best if I also cut back on his Thorazine. Maybe that would be a good idea.”Vendis’s glare slid from Alex to the doctor. “Maybe it would.”“The drugs will be worn off for your purposes by tomorrow night,” the doctorassured him. “We’ll wait for your return, then.”“I have matters I must attend to.” Vendis’s gaze shifted to the others. “See tothis. Any of you knows how to cause agony and make it last until you get whatyou want. I don’t need to waste my time standing around while a couple oftroublesome people bleed and scream and cry for mercy. I only need theinformation once they give it up.”Everyone except Alex bowed.Vendis gestured to the doctor. “Show me out.”After they had gone, everyone let out a sigh of relief.“Well,” Alice said, “I guess we’ll have to wait and do this tomorrow night.”Henry gestured to her and the two orderlies. “You three get him back to hisroom.” He grinned as he glanced back at Jax hanging naked from the showerhead.“Yuri and I will take good care of her tonight.”Alex’s knees went weak.One of the orderlies seized Alex’s arm, turning him around. “Let’s go.”Alex’s mind raced. He had to do something to buy Jax time. He dug in his heelsand looked back over his shoulder.“I know that tomorrow, once you reduce our drugs, you’ll be able to get us bothto talk. I also know that after you get what you want you’ll kill me. When I’mdead I won’t be able to know or care about anything anymore.“But if either of you touches her tonight, before I’m dead, then once I’m offthe drugs I will care and I will have plenty of reason not to talk. If you touchher, I swear on my life you will be trying to explain to Vendis why you failedto get anything from me.”“Well, well,” Alice said. “I think we just found out how much he really caresfor her. He’s going to make this easy for us.”Yuri’s eyes glinted with menace. “And if he cares for her so much, once off thedrugs we won’t have to disfigure her too much before he’s eager to tell useverything he knows.” He glanced over at Henry. “Then we can have her, and wewon’t have to be concerned about what damage we might do. Besides, the way sheis right now it wouldn’t be much better than screwing a corpse. It would be alot more satisfying if she was awake and kicking.”At first displeased, Henry considered a moment. “I guess you may be right.Alice, I don’t trust our patient, here. And I don’t trust a nervous doctor toadjust the dose correctly. He’s worried about his own neck but it’s our necks onthe line. We take orders from His Excellency, not a doctor from this world. Youmake sure that Alex gets enough so that he can’t fight, but not so much that hewon’t care about her screams.”Alice coldly appraised Alex. “I would have to agree with you about the doctor.”She smiled crookedly. “I’ll make sure that my patient is able to be terrified,but not able to fight back. In the meantime, if you two do anything to ruin herso that she can’t talk, or he won’t, I’ll have you both hanging there in herplace when Vendis returns. Got it?”Henry made a sour face. “Got it.”Yuri folded his arms and finally nodded.She shoved Alex. “Let’s go.”"},{"pageContent":"35.THE NEXT MORNING,after an endlessly long, sleepless night of staring up at theceiling in the dark, Alex got dressed and sat on the edge of his bed to wait.All he could think about was Jax hanging there, alone, no one caring how muchagony she was in. Alex was the only one who cared, and he couldn’t do anythingabout it. Not yet, anyway.Not long after he’d gotten dressed, Henry showed up. The big man looked to be ina foul mood. It became obvious just how bad his mood was when he pulled Alex tohis feet and began punching him in the abdomen. Henry apparently didn’t wantmarks that would be obvious. Maybe the others had told him not to damage theirprize.Alex could do nothing but take it. He knew that such a beating to the abdomencould cause dangerous injuries. He also knew that he couldn’t fight back if hewas to keep Henry believing that he was drugged. They had to believe that, if hewas to have a chance to help Jax.This time, though, as Henry slugged him, Alex didn’t have the benefit of drugsto dull the pain. This time it hurt in earnest and left him gasping on thefloor. He fought back the urge to vomit. For a time as he lay on the floorconvulsing in agony, Alex was hating life.“You know, Alex,” Henry said as he stood with his fists at his sides, toweringover Alex, catching his breath, “you would think that we would be even by now.But I have to tell you, when I woke up this morning and my nose was bleedingagain, I realized that we’re not even close to being even.”The big man unexpectedly kicked Alex in the side of the head. It caused Alex tobite the inside of his cheek. He swallowed the coppery taste of blood. Hestruggled to stay conscious, and to stay quiet, to act thoroughly sedated.“Since I have to wait to screw the bitch, I figure you owe me even more. One wayor another you two are going to end up talking up a storm for me.”Henry squatted down to be close when he delivered the rest of the threat. “Tellyou what else. Your day is going to end badly. I’m going to tie a tourniquethere, and here.” Henry used a finger to mark a place on each of Alex’s upperarms. “Then I’m going to cut off your arms, right here. Then I’m going to do thesame things to your legs. The tourniquets will keep you from losing so muchblood that you miss the show.“You’re going to tell us everything you know or we’ll be doing even worse thingsto your lady. And let me tell you, when it comes to using a knife, Yuri is areal artist. Once he gets started he gets inspired and you just can’t stop theman. I think he’s kind of sick in the ways he enjoys hurting women, but maybethat’s just me. You’re going to be eager to tell me everything you know to keepYuri from getting started on her.”Alex lay curled up on the floor gripped by pain and rage. He pretended to begripped by neither.Henry stood. “Alice will be in with your morning medication any time now. Lastnight’s dose will be wearing off by tonight, and this morning’s dose is beingreduced. You’ll be clearheaded enough to hear Jax screaming and begging you totell us what we want to know.”Even if he wanted to, Alex couldn’t tell them what they wanted to know. Hedidn’t know what a gateway was or anything about it. He didn’t think, though,that they were going to believe that.“You understand?” Henry demanded.Alex, curled up on the floor holding his arms across the cramping pain in hismiddle, could only nod.Henry seized Alex’s shirt and hauled him to his feet, then heaved him into thechair. “You sit there and have a nice rest. Alice will be in with yourmedication in a bit. Got that?”Alex nodded as if he didn’t care.Henry paused at the door to look back and smile. “You just got to love a worldthat comes up with Thorazine. Just think, I can pound the crap out of you andthe Thorazine keeps you helpless to lift a finger to defend yourself. What agreat world.”After Henry left, Alex put his throbbing head in his hands, recovering, tryingto clear his vision from the brutal kick. His neck muscles hurt so much that hecould hardly move his head.He let the anger rage through him. He held his hand out to see his fingerstrembling. He knew that he needed to get them under control or someone might getsuspicious.He wanted the day to be over. He wanted to see Jax. She would still be drugged,but not nearly as much. He needed her to be more alert if he was to have achance of helping her.He hated to see her doped up with Thorazine and whatever else was in the pills.He didn’t know if they would stop the pills. Since his mother was on Thorazinehe’d long ago asked questions about them. Thorazine, he had learned, greatlyamplified the effect of whatever pills were taken with it.Alex leaned back in the chair and drew deep, even breaths, trying to calmhimself as he waited for his morning medications to arrive.One more dose of drugs to dodge.He was pretty sure that they wouldn’t bother with the evening dose, since themorning dose wouldn’t be worn off that soon and they surely intended to kill himthat night after they got the information they wanted.Except Alex didn’t have any information to give them. He didn’t know anythingexcept that Jax had figured out what they were after. She hadn’t had time totell him what that was.Still, even that much information was dangerous to them both. That informationin and of itself might be all they needed. If Alex couldn’t find a way to stopthem, they would be able to get him to reveal that Jax knew what they werelooking for, and then torture her to get her to tell them everything she knew.Alex’s grandfather had told him once that everyone had a breaking point andeveryone would eventually talk under torture.These people were obviously experienced at torture. They knew what they weredoing. He couldn’t expect either Jax or himself to be able to hold out forever.Alex knew that he couldn’t let it go that far. He had no option but to try to dosomething before it got to that point. He’d been awake most of the night tryingto come up with something, but it was next to impossible to plan when he didn’tknow exactly what it was that they were going to do. If they came to get him andfirst bound his hands or put him in a straitjacket before taking him to Jax, itwould be all over. He needed them to believe he was drugged enough that hecouldn’t fight them. He needed to keep up the act and put them at ease.If they tried to restrain him, though, he would have no choice but to act.If he had to fight them in his room first, he didn’t know how in the world hewas going to get all the way across the ninth floor of Mother of Roses. Hecouldn’t break down the heavy doors. They were designed to keep mental patientsfrom breaking them down.If he could get keys he could unlock the doors, but not all the staff carriedkeys. Even if he managed to get his hands on a set of keys, he couldn’t simplystroll through so many locked doors, or through the nurses’ station, withoutbeing seen and an alarm being raised.His head spun as he tried to think through the different scenarios. His thinkingwas beginning to become mired in panic.Just then the door swung open. It was his morning medications. Except that thistime it was Alice who marched in with a med tray. Alex sat limp, staring off atnothing.Alice glared down at him a moment, then lowered the tray with the three cups.“Time for your medications. Don’t give me any grief. I have things to do, otherpatients waiting for my caring touch, so hurry it up.”Alex nodded and took the cup with the Thorazine. He trapped the syrupy liquid inhis mouth under his tongue as before, then added the pills to it. He spit thewhole thing into the water cup after drinking down the water. He crushed the cupand threw it in the wastebasket with the first two.Alice had watched him the whole time. Her gaze moved to the wastebasket. Shestood for a moment, then tossed the tray on the bed and bent to retrieve thelarger of the three cups, the one that had held the water and now contained thediscarded drugs.She looked in the cup and then angrily threw it in his lap.“Nice try. You have ten seconds to drink it all down or I’m going to go get acouple of orderlies and we’re going to put you in a straitjacket.”Alex blinked as he had when he’d been heavily drugged. “But I’ll need water toswallow this.”“Clock’s ticking, Alex.”He caught a glimpse of her other hand behind her back. She had a syringe.Alex exploded out of the chair.A brief, clipped cry of surprise was all that made it out before he broke herjaw.He immediately grabbed her throat with both hands. He saw her hand with thesyringe come up. He kept hold of her throat with one hand and with the otherseized her hand and bent it downward until her wrist snapped. The syringedropped to the floor, bouncing several times.Alice couldn’t cry for help, not only because he was crushing her windpipe, butbecause her jaw was broken and hanging crookedly. Blood ran in strings from theside of her mouth, leaving a bright red stain that spread across the shoulder ofher stark white dress.Her back arched as she tried to get away, but Alex had her throat in a deathgrip. She beat her good fist against him to no effect as he took her to herknees. All the while she tried to lean back away from him.Alex was lost in a life-or-death rage. He could see as well as feel his thumbscrushing her throat closed. He put every fiber of his strength into squeezingharder yet. He gritted his teeth, letting out a low growl with the effort.Alice’s eyes bulged. She frantically swung her arm, trying to beat him back.Alex was immune to her impotent blows. She began turning blue. Her tongueswelled from her mouth as she desperately tried to gasp a breath, but it wasimpossible.Alex followed her to the ground, straddling her as he choked the life out ofher. He held her head against the floor, using his weight to help crush herthroat. Her arms flailed weakly. Her mouth moved as if she was trying to saysomething, but her distended tongue prevented her from even mouthing words forwhich there was no air.Alex let his anger rage at this woman who intended to be a party to torturingJax. He wanted this woman dead. He wanted them all dead.Alex had for so long been holding back his rage, his need to strike out andfight back, that it felt exhilarating to finally be able to let that fury loose.He didn’t know how long she had been dead before he even realized it.He finally sat back on his heels, catching his breath. With the back of hiswrist he wiped sweat from his brow.She was purple. Her eyes were wide open, staring at nothing. Her tongue bulgedfrom her mouth, lying over to the side. Saliva and blood trickled out.Alex raked his fingers back though his hair. He thought he might be sick.He finally got up off the corpse. He saw the syringe and picked it up. The capwas missing. He realized that she must have popped it off with a thumb. He castabout and finally found the cap under the bed. He replaced it and put thesyringe in his pocket.In the eerie silence, the bed squeaked as Alex leaned back against it. He staredat the dead woman sprawled in the middle of the floor.He’d had no choice, of course, but this complicated things. He had to figure outwhat he was going to do with her now. He considered stuffing her in thewardrobe, but when he opened the door to check its size, he realized that therewas no way she would fit. He could push her under the bed, but the bedcoversdidn’t hang down far enough to hide anything under such a high hospital bed.He paced, trying to think. Soon, someone was going to come in and they would seeher. If nothing else they would come that night to get him and take him over totheir private torture session in the women’s shower.He considered putting Alice against the wall, behind where the door opened,cleaning up the mess, and then going down to the sunroom to wait. It wouldprobably be Henry who came looking for him. If Alex only left on the readinglamp over the bed, Henry might pop his head in, not see Alex, and go to thesunroom.He realized that that was a lousy plan. Any number of things were likely to gowrong. People were soon going to wonder where Alice was and start searching forher. The orderlies were quick to pick up on such things. Some of the patientscould be dangerous and they didn’t allow staff to go unaccounted for. They knewthat she was doing med rounds. It was probably only a matter of minutes beforethey came looking for her to make sure she was all right.Alex paced, frantically trying to think of what he could do, glancing over atthe corpse every time he turned to pace in the other direction. He needed tosomehow make Alice disappear.He stopped suddenly and stared down at the woman. She was a mess. Blood fromwhen he had struck her and broken her jaw lay in a long string halfway acrossthe floor. Alice had lost control of herself as he had strangled her. There wasa spreading puddle of urine under her sprawled legs.He needed her to disappear.Alex wondered if it was possible.He could try. At this point he had no other ideas and nothing to lose.He ran to the bed. It was old and squeaked whenever someone leaned against it.When things squeaked like that it usually meant that screws had worked loose. Heran his fingers along the metal bars and quickly found a self-tapping metalscrew sticking up at the end of the side rail. He used his thumb and the side ofhis first finger to loosen it. He gritted his teeth with the effort. Had he notbeen so frantic he might not have been able to unscrew it with his bare hands.The screw wasn’t long—certainly not long enough to be an effective weapon—but ithad a relatively sharp point and was long enough for his purpose. He hurriedover to Alice and squatted down beside her purple face.He held the screw over the dead woman’s forehead as he thought. He closed hiseyes as he worked to remember. He had seen Jax activate a lifeline severaltimes. The first time it had been shocking to see her carving in Bethany’sforehead. Such surprise helped indelibly fix the picture in his mind.More than that, though, he was an artist. Designs stuck in his head. Heremembered forms, spatial relationships. He clearly recalled that every time Jaxhad drawn the design it looked the same. He was pretty sure that he rememberedthe way Jax had cut that design into foreheads. He let himself see it in hismind.He could hear orderlies talking as they walked along the hallway outside hisroom. He had no choice but to try.With the point of the screw Alex started carving the lines into Alice’sforehead. He made the arc that Jax had done first, then added two angled lineson the right and one on the left. He cut each line in turn, concentrating on themental picture he had of the lines in Bethany’s forehead, making them preciselythe same angles he remembered.Alex lost himself in the task, just as he lost himself in painting. He made eachstroke with confidence, the way Jax had. The point of the screw dragged againstbone as he pulled it across the skin of Alice’s forehead. He finished with thepattern that overlaid the beginning arc, just as Jax had done.Alex sat back on his heels, holding the screw in his fingers, looking at thething he had drawn. Blood covered his fingers and ran down his wrist.Unexpectedly, Alice ceased to be there. She didn’t become transparent and slowlyfade away like in a ghost movie. It didn’t look like some spooky special effect.There was no drama to it. She was there one moment, and the next instant shesimply wasn’t.Alex blinked in astonishment. He looked around. The blood across the floor wasgone. The puddle of urine was gone. He looked at his bloody fingers holding thescrew. There was no blood. He sat still for a moment, taking it in.He had just drawn a spell and made someone disappear before his very eyes. Hehad done it. It was so astonishing, and such a huge relief, that Alex laughed.He heard orderlies coming down the hall. By their brief, muffled words, he couldtell that they were putting their head into each room along the way, asking ifanyone had seen Alice.Alex scrambled to his chair and sat, working up a dazed look. He stared ahead,waiting for the door to open.That was when he saw the med tray on the bed.Alex jumped up and snatched the tray. He shoved it under the mattress. He wipedhis sweaty hands on his thighs as he looked around the room. Everything lookednormal. Nothing looked out of place.He plopped down in the chair, letting his hands lie limp at his sides.The door opened partway as an orderly leaned halfway in and glanced around theroom. “Have you seen Nurse Alice?”Alex gave the man a stuporous look. “She gave me my medicine and left.”The orderly nodded and hurried away. When the door shut, Alex let out a sigh ofrelief.Now he had to wait for night, when they would come to get him. They would expecthim to be more awake but they would also believe he would still be sufficientlysedated that they could torture answers out of him and he wouldn’t fight back.Alex allowed himself a smile of triumph for this much of it. The next part wouldbe vastly more difficult, and he didn’t know if he would succeed, but he hadfinally taken back control of his life.As he sat waiting, he worried about Jax, hoping she could hold out. He couldn’tfail. The price of failure was unacceptable.He had promised her that as long as he could help it, he wasn’t going to allowthem to hurt her. He meant it."},{"pageContent":"36.LONG AFTER DARK ALEX WAS STILL WAITING. He worried that they might have hatchedsome new plan. A thousand different terrors ran through his mind as he waited.As the night wore on, there might have hatched some new plan. A thousanddifferent terrors ran through his mind as he waited. As the night wore on, therewas nothing he could do but wait. He had no way to get to Jax on his own.Henry and Dr. Hoffmann finally showed up long after lights-out. The doctor waswithout his usual stethoscope, although he was wearing his white coat. Henry,looking smug—as smug as he could look with bandages covering his nose—waitedback near the door.Before the door had closed, Alex had seen two more orderlies fold their arms andtake up posts just outside. They apparently were going to be ready if hisreduced medication had rendered him more alert than they expected. They expectedhim to be at least aware enough to care what happened to him and Jax, but ratherslow and submissive. Alex wanted them to see what they expected to see, so thatwas the part he played.He rose from his chair as the doctor approached, trying to do it in a way thatwould look dull and a little awkward.“Alice gave you your medication this morning?” the doctor asked as he smoothedthin strands of hair over his bald patch.“Yes.” Alex gestured to the wastebasket. “I threw the cups away after I took themedication.”The doctor glanced toward the trash. Alex didn’t think that the man wouldactually go through the trash and inspect the discarded paper cups, andfortunately he didn’t. He instead looked back at Alex’s eyes.“Throughout this entire thing I’ve tried to do this without people having to gethurt. I believe that such methods are the best way of actually getting thetruth. Torture is a poor way to get good information. It isn’t reliable. Peoplebeing tortured will say anything they think the questioner wants to hear. Peoplebeing tortured will confess to witchcraft if that’s what is expected. Butwhether I like it or not, the time for trying to find answers my way is past.”He pressed his lips tight for a moment. “Take my advice, Alex. Answer theirquestions.”“Did they touch her?”The doctor glanced back over his shoulder at the big orderly waiting by thedoor. “No. But she’s been hanging there since last night. The drugs are wearingoff and she’s coming around, but that may only be making it worse for her.Hanging by your arms like that is dangerous in and of itself. She’s havingtrouble breathing.”Alex’s insides roiled. He remembered Jax telling him about how Sedrick Vendisliked to hang people up by their arms and how it slowly and painfully suffocatedthem. He was so angry that it was making him dizzy. Rage strained to be letloose.Instead, he kept quiet as he waited. He knew that the doctor was working up tosomething.“I have a deal to offer you, Alex.”Alex frowned a little. “What kind of deal?”“If you cooperate and tell us everything we want to know, right now, right upfront, I’ll see if I can’t get them to let me give you both an overdose.”“An overdose? You mean to kill us?”Dr. Hoffmann nodded as he looked into Alex’s eyes. “One way or another, afteryou both give up what you know, you’re both going to die. They’re pretty adamantabout wanting you dead and being rid of the Rahl line—after they get what theyneed from you, of course—but they’re especially eager to waste Jax.”“Do they know you’re making such an offer?”“No,” he admitted. “But if you cooperate and tell me everything, I’ll see if Ican’t talk them into letting me give you each an injection. They want theinformation, and they want you both dead. Give me the information without havingto resort to torture and I can make it a peaceful death for both of you. You’lljust go to sleep and never wake up.”Alex knew that Vendis, Yuri, and Henry would never go for such a deal. They werelooking forward to what was coming and they had well-founded confidence thatthey would get all the information they wanted in their own way.“You’re in the wrong line of medicine, Dr. Hoffmann. You should have become aveterinarian.”The doctor frowned. “Why do you say that?”“Because veterinarians get paid for performing euthanasia. When you do that topeople it’s called murder. Murder is punishable by death.”A small, cruel smile touched the corners of his mouth. “But if you don’t let mehelp you, I won’t be committing murder—they will.”Alex tried to act a little slow in his response, as if he had to work to talk.“The nurses’ station is filled with records. You’ve no doubt been billing thestate for care while trying to extract information from people. After all, youhave to justify the patient count and all the drugs you’ve been using. I’m surethat you’ve been going through large quantities of controlled substances.“Sooner or later when the state authorities audit the hospital’s drug recordsthey’re going to discover that something strange has been going on here, thatthe numbers don’t match. They’re going to want to talk to your patients, butyour patients, listed in those records, will be dead.“By the way, what do you plan to do with the bodies? Are you experienced atdisposing of dead people? How many deaths have you been party to, Doctor? Whatare you going to do if corpses of your patients are found? The authorities willcertainly have a lot of questions for you.” Alex let him wonder how he wouldexplain it, let him worry about all the evidence sitting there in those recordsthat would tie him to murder.The doctor glanced briefly in the direction of the nurses’ station, where thefiles were kept on shelves.“They aren’t going to learn anything,” he finally said.He didn’t sound confident. He sounded concerned.“How much are they paying you to be a party to murder, Doctor? Or were you akiller before they ever came along? Did you become a psychiatrist to hide yourneed to kill? To hide your urges? Did you think that being a doctor topsychopaths would be the perfect cover for your own perverted needs?”Dr. Hoffmann’s expression soured. “Have it your way. You can’t say I didn’toffer to help you out. Maybe if you give up the information quickly enoughyou’ll get lucky and they’ll cut your throat before they start in on Jax. Iwould have thought you would have taken the offer for her sake if not your own.”Alex almost grabbed the man by the throat the way he had Alice. With thegreatest of effort he restrained himself. He had to get to Jax. After what hehad just heard about her condition, that was more important than ever.“Let what they do to her be on your conscience, since that’s the choice you madefor her.” The doctor gestured toward the door. “Let’s go.”“Any ideas?” Henry asked as they approached.“Alice must have gotten cold feet and taken off,” Dr. Hoffmann said.He sounded annoyed and short-tempered. Alex knew that he had gotten to the man.He wanted him distracted and preoccupied.“Just as well.” Henry’s face betrayed anything but worry for the woman. “She wastoo uppity for my taste. I often suspected that she was planted here to watchus. Maybe now that it’s being wrapped up she was recalled. We have moreimportant things to worry about. Let’s go.”Alex fell in behind Henry as they turned down the hall. The lights were mostlyoff, leaving the corridor to gloomy shadows. Two more orderlies that Alex hadn’tknown were part of the scheme shadowed the doctor. He wondered if the wholeplace could be a front for their activities.The nurses’ station was staffed by three nurses, all engaged in a lightconversation with an orderly sitting at a desk to the side. Charts and a jumbledstack of files sat on the desk. When they saw the somber group enter theirstation on the way through, they made themselves busy.The women’s ward on the ninth floor was just as dark as the men’s wing had been.The small group paused when Alex’s mother unexpectedly shuffled out of thebathroom. She was wearing pajamas and a pink robe that Alex had given her. Sheonly briefly glanced in their direction before yawning and turning back towardher room. She had looked at Alex, along with the rest of the party, but hedidn’t think she had recognized him.When she had shuffled down the hall and turned in to her room without lookingback, Henry shoved Alex into the women’s bathroom. It was better lit than thehall so that patients could use the bathroom in the night if they needed to. Asign saying “Out of Order” was taped to the shower door.A nurse leaning against the wall unfolded her arms and looked down at her watch.“You’re early.”“What difference does it make?” the doctor snapped.She shrugged. “Just that Yuri isn’t here yet. I had Dwayne stay late to let Yuriin when he gets here.”Dwayne was the security guard inside the back door Alex always used. As hewaited, Alex stood slump-shouldered, trying to act passive. With the way theorderlies stood at ease, it seemed to be working. If only he could slow down hisgalloping heart.Henry came forward, pulling out the keys attached to the reel on his belt. “Wedon’t need Yuri to get started.”“What was Helen Rahl doing in here?” the doctor asked as Henry worked the lock.“Taking a pee,” the nurse said.As the doorway leading into the shower opened, Alex could see that only onelight was on. The cavelike room beyond had a ghostly cast to it. He thought thatit looked like a place where death itself waited.His heart felt like it came up in his throat when he saw Jax still hangingthere. In addition to the blindfold, she was now gagged with a cloth through hermouth and tied behind her head. She trembled slightly. It was clear that she washaving a lot of trouble breathing. She had to push up on her toes as best shecould to draw each ragged breath. Her arms shook with each effort.Alex was so enraged that it was hard for him to focus on where everyone wasaround him. He reminded himself that he had to keep track of where everyone wasor he could be blindsided. Surprises could be deadly. He had to take a measureof the situation and not make a reckless mistake. He couldn’t afford a mistake.Jax couldn’t afford a mistake.The nurse dragged a straight-backed wooden chair from the side. The chair’s feetstuttered across the tile floor, the sound echoing around in the shower. She setthe chair in the center of the room, not far in front of Jax. Alex rememberedseeing Jax’s clothes thrown to the side, but he didn’t remember seeing the chairbefore.Henry, grinning with anticipation, pulled off the blindfold. Jax squinted andblinked at the sudden light, even though the light wasn’t bright. She tookappraisal of everyone in the room. When she met Alex’s gaze there was a world ofmeaning, a shared understanding, in that silent connection.Henry slid his hand down her belly and between her legs. “Getting eager for me,aren’t you?”Alex thought the deadly glare Jax gave him should have backed him up a fewsteps, but it didn’t.Henry, obviously enjoying his control over her, probed further as he used hisother hand to pull the gag from her mouth. He let it hang around her neck. “Oh,sorry.” He chuckled. “I couldn’t hear you.”“You’re already dead,” she told him. “You just don’t know it yet.”Henry removed his hand from between her legs and put it over his heart in mockalarm. “Really? Don’t tell me, you intend to kill me?”By the look in her eyes Alex could see that her rage easily matched his. She letthat lethal look be her only answer.“Did you find Alice?” the nurse asked, tiring of the game Henry was playing.The doctor gestured irritably. “No one has seen her.”“We looked everywhere,” Henry said as he turned his attention away from Jax,“and like the doc says, there’s no sign of her. She’s vanished.”Jax’s gaze immediately sought Alex. He smiled the smallest bit in answer to thequestion in her eyes. A hint of a smile came to the corners of her mouth. Inthat smile he could see that she grasped that he’d had something to do withAlice’s disappearance.But then she had to close her eyes with the effort of pulling herself up withher arms as she stretched on her tiptoes to get a breath. Alex could see howmightily she was struggling to fight back panic at not being able to breathe.“Maybe she went back for some reason,” Henry suggested.The others started speculating as to why Nurse Alice would have left withoutsaying anything. It seemed to be common consensus that the woman typically didthings without telling others what she was up to, so, as far as they were allconcerned, it wasn’t entirely out of character.No one was looking at Alex as he stood submissively. He wanted Jax to be ready.When her eyes turned to look at him again, he gave her a small wink. The smilegrew and stayed on her lips as she returned the wink. He didn’t know if shegrasped his full meaning or if she was merely heartened by the wink.Losing interest in the talk about Alice, Henry pulled a folding knife from hispocket, letting everyone know that it was time to get on with it. Pressing onthe thumb stud, he flicked his wrist and snapped open the blade. One of theother two orderlies did the same. Alex saw that the nurse had a syringe.Henry used the point of his knife to back Alex up a few steps. “Have a seat.”The nurse shoved the chair against the back of his legs. Alex flopped down inthe chair. In his peripheral vision he tried to keep track of the syringe.His level of alarm rose suddenly when the other orderly stepped up close behind,pressing against the chair to hold it in place. The orderly in front of him withthe knife pulled a handful of zip ties from his pocket.Alex realized what they intended to do."},{"pageContent":"37.HURRY UP AND SECURE HIM to the chair,” Henry said. “Thorazine or no Thorazine, Idon’t want to have to worry about either of them being loose and gettingdifficult to handle when we start cutting.”It appeared that they weren’t going to wait for Yuri to show up. While that wasone less man to worry about, Alex knew that he had to remain aware that Yuricould show up at any moment. The nurse had said that they were early, though.Maybe Henry had decided to grab the glory, and Jax, for himself.Alex kept an eye on the knife hand of the orderly in front of him. He knew thatit was the hands that were the killers.“Put your arms behind your back,” the big orderly growled as he seized Alex bythe hair.Alex knew that if they restrained him he would have no chance at all. Jax wouldhave no chance.He had run out of time and options.He remembered lessons Ben had taught him from a young age, warnings that youcouldn’t always choose the fight. The best thing to do was to avoid a fight, ifyou could. But the way that it all too often happened, his grandfather had toldhim, was that you would find yourself in a fight you didn’t want, outnumbered,and outmatched in weapons. That was because people would generally only attackif they felt confident enough in their superiority to feel sure of the outcome.Alex recalled, as a boy just entering adulthood, being troubled by the warning.It didn’t seem fair. He asked Ben what he should do if he ever found himself inthat situation. That question was the gateway to a whole new level of training.Ben had told him that in such a case there wasn’t any such thing as fair. Hisonly chance was speed, surprise, and violence of action.Henry stepped up beside the orderly facing Alex. “Come on, let’s get this overwith so we can get to her.”As the man with the zip ties took a step forward, Alex pushed his shoulders backagainst the man behind him, as if trying to back away from the two knives infront of him. The man behind leaned in to keep Alex from sliding the chair back.That was exactly what Alex had wanted him to do.There was no choice now. He had only one chance.Alex pressed his shoulders against the man behind him. The man pushed back.In an instant of exquisite, unrestrained rage, Alex put all his force intoscreaming a battle cry as he uncoiled, throwing a mighty kick squarely intoHenry’s chest.The blow was powerful enough to break ribs. It drove a grunt from the big man asit knocked him back.The orderly in front of him was so surprised by the sudden burst of movementthat he stood motionless for just an instant. An instant was all Alex needed.With Henry clear, in that instant when everyone else was frozen in shock, beforethe man behind could get a better hold on him, Alex bounded out of the chair andseized the wrist of the hand holding the knife.With an iron grip on the man’s wrist, Alex dove under the arm and came upbehind. As he sprang up he used all his momentum and strength to violently twistthe arm up in a way it wasn’t meant to go. The shoulder popped out of its joint.Sinew separated with a sickening rip. Alex spun around, taking the arm with him.In less than a heartbeat the man’s shoulder was torn apart enough that the armwas useless.Jax was the only one who had been ready for the sudden attack. At the same timeas Alex was taking out the orderly with the knife, before Henry could recover,Jax threw her legs around him, pinning his arms to his side. She locked herankles.The man with the ruined arm let out a shriek of pain that echoed through theshower. Alex wrenched the knife from his dangling hand. The shock and pain—theviolence of action—had immobilized the orderly. Without giving him any time torecover his wits, Alex immediately rammed the captured knife three times inrapid succession into the small of the man’s back, aiming for the kidney.By the way the orderly’s mouth opened with a scream that couldn’t make its wayout, the blade had found its mark. He twisted toward the floor, the torn armhanging, the other reaching blindly back toward the fatal wound. On his waydown, Alex ripped the knife across the man’s neck, severing arteries, to be sureof the kill.At the same time the second orderly dove in toward Alex before the first hadsmacked face-first onto the floor. Alex dodged to the side. As the man missed,slipped on blood, and crashed headlong into the wall, Alex wheeled around,stretched up, and slashed the ties holding Jax to the shower pipe. Her handssprang free.She kept her legs tightly locked around Henry as she gripped his hair with bothfists to keep from being thrown off his back. As exhausted as she had to be,Alex knew that she couldn’t last long. Fortunately, the violent kick, besidesbreaking ribs, had taken enough of the fight out of Henry that she was able tokeep him immobilized—at least for the moment.Alex knew, though, that the big man would recover his senses and wind all toosoon and become a raging bull turning on her. Even so, Alex could do no morethan free her before he had to turn to the man bounding back off the wall andcoming at him, slashing with his knife.Out of the corner of his eye, Alex spotted the doctor scrambling away toward thedoor.Alex ducked under a wild swing, the knife missing his face by a good foot. As hesprang up, Alex punched a quick thrust of the blade in under the man’s armpit,hoping to hit the space between ribs. He felt the blade slide over bone on theway in. The orderly cried out and jerked back. Alex had wanted to puncture alung, but as heavily muscled as the man was, he wasn’t sure the relatively shortblade had gone deep enough.It slowed the man for only a second. He came back at Alex, swinging with avengeance. Alex had to dance back to avoid a half-dozen savage thrusts. Hewaited and picked his spot, and when the man thrust again, Alex stepped insidethe attack and slashed down across the wrist. His blade cut cleanly throughtendons drawn tight. Once parted, they snapped back up into the man’s forearm.His fingers instantly lost their ability to grasp. The severed veins gushedblood at a prodigious rate.The knife clattered to the tile floor. As Alex went for it, the nurse swung thechair. Alex ducked. The chair shattered across his back. In the grip of rage ashe was, the pain seemed distant.The orderly used the opening to roll under Alex, knocking his feet out fromunder him. The nurse dove in with the syringe. Before she could stab it intohim, Alex threw an arm around the orderly’s neck, getting him in a headlock thatalso served as an anchor point. He used the man’s weight to brace himself as hekicked the nurse’s hand before she could stick him. The blow broke her fingers.She let out a cry. The syringe went flying.Alex had his hands full with the big orderly. It was like trying to hold on to abig, powerful, twisting, thrashing alligator. The injuries weren’t enough to puthim out of commission; if anything they made him fight all the harder.Alex seized his own wrist to lock his arm tight around the bull neck, applyingpressure to the carotid arteries. At the same time he leaned back, pulling theman back over the top of a hip, arching his back to keep him off balance andunder control, and to use the man’s weight to add pressure on his neck.Above him, it was obvious that Henry was recovering. He twisted away from thegrip of Jax’s legs. She landed on her back not far from Alex. Henry went forher. Jax kicked up into his groin. The blow staggered the angry orderly.As Henry reflexively bent over from the pain, Jax snatched the keys on his belt.Alex couldn’t figure out what she intended to do with his keys, but he hoped shedid something fast, or despite his obvious pain Henry would have her and startbreaking her bones. He was big enough to break her neck with one meaty hand ifhe ever got it around her throat.Jax scrambled away, staying just out of his reach. He called her every vile namein his vocabulary as he took swings, trying to grab her.Jax pulled the keys out, gathering up the wire hand over hand as it unspooled,turning Henry, keeping him off balance. When it reached the end she scooped up acouple of broken chair legs. In a flash she twisted the legs into the wire,wrapping several loops of it around each stick of wood.When Henry lunged at her, she dodged to the side and, with a good grip on herimprovised wooden handles, gave the wire attached to his belt a mighty yank. Itjerked him around. He stumbled a few steps. In a blink she circled around behindhim.Jax whipped a loop of wire over Henry’s head as she bounded up onto his back,compressing her body as she planted a foot between his shoulder blades. She letout a mighty cry of rage and effort as she used all her strength to straightenher coiled body while at the same time pulling on her improvised wooden handles.For an instant, as he realized the danger, Henry’s meaty hands clawed at thewire around his throat. It was too late. As Jax screamed with effort the wiresliced cleanly down through his throat. Henry’s eyes bulged.As Jax, her foot on his back, pulled the wooden handles she’d made, the wireknifed down through the carotid arteries as well as the esophagus and windpipe.It sliced all the way through everything but a bundle of the tougher tendons.With most of the supporting neck muscles severed, his head flopped to the side.Alex could see that the wire had to have hit perfectly between two vertebrae,rupturing the disc.The nurse screamed at the sight of Henry toppling over. Jax, a foot against hisback and her hands holding the wooden handles as if she were holding the reinsto a monster, rode the towering orderly all the way down. He hit the tile floorhard. His head smacked the hardest, making a sickening crack on impact. A thickred pool spread across the white tiles.The instant Henry landed, Jax snatched the knife from his hand and sprangcatlike up off the man, using him as a launching pad to make a dive for thenurse.Just as the woman turned to run, Jax landed on her back. They both sprawledforward. Before they hit the floor Jax sliced the woman’s throat just asefficiently as she had once sliced Bethany’s throat in Alex’s bed.Alex had been holding the orderly in a headlock for only a moment, yet alreadythe man’s arms moved slowly, blindly, as he tried to fight for his life. Whenhis arms swung, the hand with the severed tendons flopped without control. As helost consciousness the fight was going out of him.Alex used the opening to swiftly reverse his hold and throw a leg over the man.He used the leverage to give power to a quick twist that snapped the big man’sneck.As the orderly went limp, Alex untangled himself and scrambled across the floorto Jax. She was just pushing herself up off the back of the dead nurse.When she saw Alex her look of lethal rage instantly switched to tears ofdeliverance. She threw her arms around his neck. He felt a lump in his ownthroat. With the strength of her hold on him she wordlessly conveyed herprofound sense of relief.In the sudden silence, their breathing echoed softly in the shower room.“Are you all right?” Alex asked as he held her head to his shoulder.“I’m not sure. I felt like I’d become lost in some dark nightmare. I couldn’tunderstand it. I’m better, but I still feel strange, like I’ve lost my mind,lost myself.”“You’re going to be fine. It’s the drugs they gave us. The rest of them willwear off in another day or so. Just stay with me. It will get better, Ipromise.”She nodded against his shoulder. Now that the desperate fight had abruptly cometo an end, the adrenaline rush was fading. Her arms loosened around his neck asher strength ebbed. Her voice, too, was weak.“I thought it was over. I thought I was going to die hanging there. But when Isaw you I knew it would be all right.”He smiled as he held her shoulders and lifted her away from him. “We’re not outof this yet. I need you to stay strong a little longer. Get dressed. Hurry.”Alex found the keys at the end of the wire cable that had nearly decapitatedHenry. He hurriedly worked to disconnect the keys from the fitting at the end ofthe cable.“I guess now I know how you felt,” Jax said as she pulled the jeans up hermuscular legs, trying to cover herself as swiftly as possible.“How I felt? What do you mean?”“When I came to save you at your house and caught you with your pants down.”Against all odds, despite the blood everywhere, despite the way his heart stillpounded from the terror and rage, Alex laughed."},{"pageContent":"38.HURRY, ” ALEXSAID, avoiding looking at Jax in her half-naked condition.“Hoffmann is probably raising an alarm, getting together help. The last thing weneed is to get trapped in here.”“Yuri is due to show up, too,” Jax reminded him as she pulled her boots on.“Yuri is not someone to mess with. He’s not like these two in here were, or evenHenry. He’s better than good with a knife.”“Let’s see if we can get out of here before we have to worry about him.”Jax was already moving before she finished pulling the black top over her head.Alex put a hand to the small of her back not only to guide her as she wasfrantically trying to finish dressing while they headed for the door, but to beready if she faltered from exhaustion. He couldn’t imagine how she could evenstand after having to strain up on her tiptoes all night just to get eachbreath. She had to be running on fumes.“What happened to the nurse they were saying disappeared?” Jax asked as theyboth carefully peeked around the corner.“I strangled her.”“I expected something like that,” she said, still struggling to get her breath.“What I want to know is why they couldn’t find her body? How were you able tohide it in this place?”Alex squatted beside the door that had been left open when the doctor had runout. He looked out into the well-lit bathroom and then under the row of stalls.It seemed to be clear. He turned back to Jax as she pulled her long blond hairout of the neck of the black top.“I activated her lifeline.”Jax froze. “You what?”“I cut those symbols in her forehead, like I saw you do. When I finished, shevanished.”Jax stared at him. “Alex, that was a complicated spell form. It has to be doneprecisely right.”“Well, I guess I was precise enough. It worked. Why are you looking at me likethat?”“I practiced for months before I was able to do it properly. Not only does ithave to be drawn exactly right, but each part of it has to be added in thecorrect order, at the proper time. How could you remember it?”Alex shrugged. “I remember visual things.” He winced a little as he leanedcloser. “I didn’t do magic, did I?”“No,” she said with a bit of a smile that put him at ease. “You merely activateda lifeline that was already there within her. It doesn’t take magic to do it,just the precise form to activate it.”She looked back into the shower room at the four dead people sprawled on thetile floor. Blood was running toward the shower drains. “I think that maybe Iought to activate the lifelines of these people. I don’t think that we want thebodies left lying there to be discovered. It would be better for us if peoplewondered what happened, wondered where they were. Until word is sent here abouttheir return we’d have the advantage of the others here in this world being inthe dark about what happened.”When she pulled her hair back from her face he saw that her hands were shaking.He didn’t know how much strength she had left.Alex agreed with her but he feared they couldn’t spare the time. “I think itwould be worse if we were to get trapped in here and have it start all overagain.”“Yes, but what if—” She paused and frowned. “Do you smell smoke?”Alex realized that he did. “Yes. That can’t be good.”He put an arm around her waist to help her as he started through the bathroom.At the outer door they squatted down again, pressing up tight against the wallto the side in case anyone burst through the door. With a finger, Alex slowlyeased the door open a few inches. He carefully checked out into the hallway butcould effectively look in only one direction: back toward the nurses’ station.The partially opened door allowed a stronger smell of smoke into the bathroom.“We’d better find out what’s going on. Are you ready?”Jax nodded. “Which way are we going?”Alex looked out again. He pointed with a thumb.“Toward the nurses’ station. I want to know what’s burning. There are a lot ofpeople locked in this place. Fire in here could end up being a disaster.“Let’s stay to the side of the hall and stay low. If there’s anyone waiting inambush, I don’t want to give them an opportunity to surround us.”When Jax nodded, Alex took her hand to keep her close as he slipped out thedoor. Staying low, they moved quickly along the edge of the dimly lit corridor.He didn’t see anyone in either direction. The lights were on in the nurses’station. He could see a gray haze of smoke beyond the glass windows. He wonderedwhy the smoke alarm wasn’t going off.Jax pulled him to a stop. She was breathing heavily. “I’m sorry. I need to resta moment. I can hardly move my legs.”Alex helped her sit and lean back against the wall. “I can’t believe that youcan move at all, after what you’ve been through.”She closed her eyes and worked at getting her breath. Besides the physicalordeal, she was still on a partial dose of the Thorazine meant to take the fightout of her. He had stopped taking his, but she was still far from clearheaded.Alex pressed a hand to her shoulder. “Rest here a moment. I’m going to go take apeek into the nurses’ station. I want to know what’s going on.”“No.” She seized his arm, holding on as if her life depended on it. “We need tostay together. I’m better now. Let’s go.”She looked exhausted but he realized that in her drugged condition, in a strangeplace, in a strange world, she had to be terrified to be left alone, especiallyas weak as she was. He wanted nothing more than to take her in his arms and holdher tight, protect her, and keep her safe. But they weren’t safe, not yet,anyway.He realized that she was probably right, they should stay together. If anythinghappened, he didn’t know if she had enough strength left to defend herself.Although she never failed to amaze him.“If you need to stop to get your breath just say so. All right?”Jax nodded as she rose up into a crouch. They stayed low enough as theyapproached the nurses’ station to be under the bottom of the window. He couldhear flames crackling on the other side of the door.When he carefully rose up to get a glimpse, he didn’t see anyone at the counterinside. He tried different keys until he found the one that fit the lock. Heturned the lock slowly, trying to be as quiet as possible.Once he had the door unlocked, he again snuck a quick glimpse in the window. Hestill didn’t see anyone, so he opened the door and slipped inside. The smokestung his eyes. He had to resist the urge to cough. They stayed low as they wentin.Alex peeked over the top of the counter and saw that way in the back the doctorwas frantically throwing liquid on the fire already raging in the aisles betweenthe files. An orderly pulled files off the shelves and threw them on the burningpile as the doctor doused them with yet more liquid.Alex went back to the wall beside the door, out of sight of the two working totorch the place, and pulled the lever of the fire alarm. Nothing happened. Helooked up at the sprinklers. They remained off. He snatched up the phone to dial911. The line was dead.Jax slipped in the door. Alex squatted down beside her.“What’s going on?” she whispered. “What’s burning?”“They’ve started a fire to destroy the files.” He kept his voice low even thoughthe noise of the fire covered it. “The fire alarm doesn’t work and the phone isdead. They were obviously prepared to destroy the whole place to cover theirtracks if anything ever went wrong. The doctor panicked and is implementingthose procedures.”They both rose up just enough to take a look over the counter. Alex could seethat the fire was already burning strongly and spreading fast. It would be hardto put out.He looked around and spotted a fire extinguisher on the wall, but he doubted itwould be big enough. He was sure that the hospital had to have fire hoses. Hedidn’t know where they were, but assumed that they were in the back of thenurses’ station.Alex knew that he had to put out the fire or the whole building would go up inflames. He tried to think of where there would be more extinguishers. Thereweren’t any out in the wards, because they couldn’t trust the patients. Theextinguishers were heavy and could be used as weapons.The doctor threw more of the flammable liquid on the burning mound of files onthe floor until the bottle was empty. It appeared to be a bottle from thepharmacy, probably alcohol. The doctor pulled another from his pocket and threwit against the shelves. The bottle shattered against the steel shelving,spilling the liquid all down the files. Fire erupted up the side of the shelves,the flames roaring and crackling, lapping at the ceiling.As he started to turn, Alex saw Jax on the floor. His first thought was that shehad passed out from exhaustion. She tried to push herself up on her arms. Itlooked to be a struggle.Realizing that something was wrong, Alex started to bend down to help her. Justthen, out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a nurse behind him.Almost at the same time as he saw the nurse, Alex felt a sharp stab in his lefthip. With an icy flood of dread and alarm he instantly knew what she had done.Almost at the same time, before he could react, a heavy office chair arcedthrough the air, crashing into the nurse, sending her sprawling.As Alex yanked the syringe from his backside he was shocked to see that it washis mother who had thrown the chair. She had thrown it just in the nick of time.The nurse had only started to push the plunger in before the chair had clobberedher. Alex had gotten some of the drug, but not nearly all of it.His mother had just saved his life.“The nurse hit her,” his mother said, pointing at Jax on the floor.“Mom—”An orderly loomed up out of the darkness behind her and threw an arm around herneck. As she screamed, Alex dove for the man. Even as he was still in midair hesaw that it was too late.His mother collapsed dead to the floor as he sailed over her, crashing into theorderly who had just broken her neck.The man made the mistake of trying to catch Alex. He expected a fight. He wasn’texpecting a knife.His eyes widened with surprise as the blade plunged deep into his lower abdomen.Alex gave it a mighty pull, slicing up until the blade hit ribs.Alex shoved the suddenly stiff, gravely wounded man to the side and fell to hisknees beside his mother. He stared in shock at her lifeless form for a moment,unable to think what to do. His mind went blank.Jax appeared beside him. Her hand urged his face away. “There’s nothing you cando.”"},{"pageContent":"39.ALEX KNELT BESIDE HIS MOTHER’S BODY, in shock that she was dead. As Jax turnedhis face away from the terrible sight, he looked up into her sad eyes, eyes thatseemed to understand all he was feeling, to sympathize with the long, darkjourney that had started when she first showed up in his life.Seeing bright red blood matting the right side of her blond hair brought Alexabruptly to his senses.He reached out, putting a finger to the side of her chin, turning her head alittle so that he could take a look.“I’m sure that it looks worse than it is,” she said. “It stunned me for amoment, that’s all.”It wasn’t bleeding heavily, and her eyes weren’t dilated. She didn’t lookdisoriented or confused. He wasn’t an expert, but it looked to him that shewasn’t badly hurt. The ordeal of hanging in the shower was much more of acontinuing worry.Alex knew that he couldn’t sit there mourning his mother or they would die, too.His mother had just saved his life. He couldn’t let that sacrifice be fornothing.He had to fight against the dulling effect of the drugs that he’d gotten fromthe syringe. It was only a portion of the dose that had been in the vial, but itwas enough that he could feel it slowing his thinking. He had to force himselfto focus, to move, to act.The immediate problem returned with clarity. It was night. Patients were asleep.He had to alert all the people in the hospital or they would likely end uptrapped in a burning building.The man on the floor not far away lay on his side, both arms across his abdomen,holding the grievous wound closed.“Please,” the man moaned, “help me.”Alex ignored him, stood up, and snatched the fire extinguisher off the wall. Ashe did, Jax straddled the nurse who had blindsided her and tried to inject Alexwith whatever was in the syringe. Before the woman came to, Jax sliced theartery on each side of her neck so she would quickly bleed to death.Jax flipped the woman over and swiftly cut symbols in her forehead. When thewoman vanished, Jax looked up at him.“I guess that answers that. There seem to be a lot of people from my worldworking here.”He wondered how deeply the tentacles from another world reached into his. Therewas no time to consider the problem, though. Fire extinguisher in hand, heheaded for the blaze.Alex yanked the pin out of the extinguisher as he rounded the corner and racedtoward the shelves. He knew that if he was to have a chance to knock down thefire he would have to act quickly. He doubted that one extinguisher would beenough, but one was all he had at the moment.He pointed the nozzle and squeezed the lever. Nothing happened. The extinguisherwas dead. It was a sickening, helpless feeling to be facing leaping flames witha dead extinguisher.When he looked up he came face-to-face with Dr. Hoffmann.The doctor held his hands out, urging Alex to stop and listen. “Alex . . . youdon’t understand.”Alex gritted his teeth and rammed the bottom of the extinguisher squarely intothe man’s face. Grunting in shock, the doctor put his hands over his face as hestaggered back. Blood in his eyes blinded him and ran out between his fingers.One arm waved blindly, trying to find something for support. He stumbled andfell backward into the pile of burning files.An alcohol bottle in his pocket broke when he hit the side of the shelving. Hispants, soaked with the alcohol, burst into flames. As he scrambled to his feet,fire ascended his white coat with a whoosh. The roaring orange flames engulfedhis face. His screams went up an octave.The orderly who had been working at pulling down the files heard the screams andcame running from behind the next row of shelves, where he had been working toburn files. Alex swung the extinguisher. Even over the sound of the fire, hecould hear the clear ring of steel on bone as the heavy extinguisher caved inthe side of the orderly’s skull.Jax seized his arm and pulled him back. “Alex! Hurry! We have to get the peopleout of here or they’ll all burn to death.”“Wait. Maybe there’s a fire hose and I can put it out.”Without waiting for her to answer, he ran around the outside of the shelves,making his way toward the back. The growing flames leaped and lapped at theceiling. He found the hose on the wall near the stairway.He yanked the hose off the wall and spun the wheel to turn on the water. Nowater came out. He spun the wheel until it came to the stop at the limit of itstravel. No water. They had shut down the fire hoses along with the sprinklers.Growling in anger, Alex ran back to find Jax kneeling beside his mother, closingher eyes. She looked up at him.“I’m sorry, Alex. I wish we didn’t have to leave her.”He nodded as he took her by the hand. “I know. Come on, we need to open thefire-escape doors and get people out of here or they’ll be trapped.”Alex left the door leading to the men’s side closed for the moment in the hopethat it would keep the fire from spreading. Together, they ran into the darkenedcorridor of the women’s wing.“Wake the people in every room. Tell them there’s a fire and they have to getout. I’ll go unlock the fire-escape door. Send them down there.”Jax nodded and turned in to the first room as he continued on. He screamed“Fire!” at the top of his lungs, hoping that it would wake at least some of thewomen. It did. By the time he got to the door he could see women in nightgownsemerging from their rooms to see what the shouting was about.Alex worked frantically at the door, finally found the right key, and got thedoor unlocked. He threw it open and waved his arms, signaling to the womenfarther back up the hall.“Come on! Fire! Everyone out!”A few of the women started down the hall, but more simply stood staring. Jaxcame out of a room, pushing two women. She gathered up others along the way,shoving them, urging them to hurry.Alex started going into rooms on the opposite side of the corridor from Jax,pulling women out of bed and herding them toward the fire escape. In short orderthey had most of the women moving out of the fire-escape door.Alex took Jax by the arm. “Come on, we need to get the men’s wing opened.”“I don’t think we have all the women out. Some ran from me and hid.”Alex could see the flames leaping out toward the counter in the nurses’ station.“There are nine floors in this building. We don’t have time to do more than whatwe’ve done. We need to keep moving and get as many people out as we can. I’mhoping that as we go down to the other floors, where the people aren’t asmentally ill or as heavily sedated, we can get some of them to help us. Butwe’re running out of time.”Alex unlocked the fire-escape door at the end of the corridor on the men’s sideas Jax started rousing the male patients. All the while he screamed, “Fire!”When the two of them had ushered the men out onto the fire escape, telling themto go down to the ground where they would be safe, Alex and Jax turned back into the heart of the building. The fire, already racing through the ceiling, hadjumped over the walls of the nurses’ station into the wards on both sides.Gritty black smoke billowed along the ceiling. As they ran toward the center ofthe building, Alex could see bright yellow and orange tongues of flame lickingout through the greasy black smoke. Paint on the walls bubbled and crackled andcurled.Alex couldn’t believe how fast the fire had gotten out of control, or how hot itwas. Just since they got the men out the fire escape, the smoke rolling alongthe ceiling had lowered to half the height of the hall. He worried about beingcaught by the flames, but he knew that smoke was deadly, too. It could render aperson unconscious.Pulling Jax by the hand he headed for the nurses’ station. He could tell by howmuch effort he had to put into urging her along that she was well beyondexhausted. She stumbled several times. The drugs were making it difficult forhim to hurry. He hoped Jax didn’t simply pass out. If that happened he didn’tknow what he would do.Beyond the front of the counter, on the other side of the nurses’ station, hecould see the body of his mother. There was nothing he could do for her now.There were people still alive who would die if he didn’t leave her and try toget people to safety. He knew it was the logical thing to do, but he hated howcruel it felt.“Help me,” the orderly lying near her pleaded. “Please . . . don’t leave me.”He was lying on his side, holding his guts in with both arms. He lay stiff andstill, fearing to move.This was the man who had killed his mother. He had no trouble killing a helplesswoman. Now, fearing for his own life, he was reduced to begging for mercy. Alexonly briefly met his beseeching gaze and then hurried on. He was in anything buta merciful mood.They had to skirt the far side of the utility room to get past the flames tomake it to the internal stairway in the back. Alex stopped Jax as hereconsidered the plan to go down to each floor alerting patients to the fire.Jax leaned back against the wall, closing her eyes as she caught her breath.Alex realized that he had no way of knowing how many of the staff were involvedin Dr. Hoffmann’s plot. For all he knew, everyone could be involved.They could be rushing down into an ambush.For all he knew, Hoffmann had alerted the staff before starting to set fire tothe files. They might be torching the place on the floors below.“Do you think that all the people working here could be from your world?” heasked Jax.She opened her eyes, struggling to focus. “I don’t know, Alex. I suppose it’spossible. We know they’ve been coming here for a long time. It’s possible thatover that time they’ve infiltrated the whole place. But why would they do such athing?”“Dr. Hoffmann was taking orders from Sedrick Vendis. Maybe they weren’t justtrying to get information from my mother. Maybe they used this place to getinformation out of other people when they needed to. After all, they kept youand me here in an attempt to find out what we knew.”“That’s possible,” she said, running her fingers back into her hair as she triedto think. “We know they’ve been working on things here in this world for a longtime, but we don’t know the extent of their meddling. They would have had plentyof time to set up this hospital as a place for questioning people. From whatI’ve seen it would certainly have given them the seclusion, anonymity, and coverthey would have wanted.”“So then there’s no telling how many of staff could be involved,” Alex said,thinking out loud. “For all we know, they could all be involved.”Jax wiped a weary hard across her face. “I can’t answer that.”“From what I can tell, it seems most of the people working up here on this floorwere from your world. Others, like Hoffmann, were cooperating with them. This isa large facility. The top two floors are relatively small, but below that thehospital extends along the whole block. It has a lot of different mental-healthservices. It could be that they confined their activities to this floor andmaybe the unit below. Being locked down as they are they could controleverything easier. Dr. Hoffmann could have seen to that control.”Jax gave him a look. “But we’d better not take that for granted.”“I think you’re right.”If there were other people involved, they could be looking for him and Jax.Going down to the next nurses’ station could get the two of them captured. Butwithout an alarm to warn them, a lot of innocent people could die in the fire.He tried to think of what to do.Struck with an idea, Alex went into the utility room and snatched a couple ofthe longer white coats off the rack. They looked like lab coats that went tomid-thigh. He handed one to Jax. “This might help fool them.”They buttoned up the coats on the way to the stairs. It took Alex afrustratingly long time to find the right key out of the dozens on the fat keyring. He was finally able to unlock the stairway door. Once in the stairway, heshut the door tight, hoping it would slow the spread of the fire.Jax followed close behind as they raced down the stairs to whatever waited."},{"pageContent":"40.ALEX UNLOCKE THE DOOR on the eighth floor and raced past the utility room andthe shelving area with the files. He didn’t see any fire. That much of it was agood sign. Several nurses turned when they heard Alex and Jax coming. One ofthem, frowning, stepped toward them to block their way. “Who the hell are—”“Fire!” Alex screamed. “The top floor is on fire! It’s already spread throughthe ceiling. The whole upper floor is involved. We opened the fire-escape doorsand got everyone we could out of the place.”“I’d better go check it out,” one of the other nurses said.“You need to evacuate your whole floor! Do it now!”“There’s been no alarm,” the first nurse said. “We can’t evacuate a securefacility without an alarm—especially when we don’t know who you are.”Alex, gritting his teeth in frustration, ran to the wall and yanked down thelever on the fire alarm. Nothing happened.“See? The alarm doesn’t work. Hurry! The fire is spreading out of control. Youneed to get everyone out, now!”One of the nurses at the counter picked up the phone. She pressed the line ofbuttons one at a time.“The phone lines are dead.” She sounded stunned.Alex snatched the fire extinguisher off the wall. He pulled the pin and squeezedthe handle.“Dead.” He held it up, squeezing the lever, demonstrating. “See? Theextinguisher upstairs was dead, too. The sprinklers don’t work. There’s no wayto fight the fire or even slow it down. The people in here have only onechance—they have to get out and they have to get out now!”The first nurse frowned at him. “What department do you work in? Who are you?”“Get moving or you’re all going to burn to death!” Alex yelled.His tone of voice changed their attitude and sent them scrambling into action,rushing to the locked doors to each side. One of the nurses ran for the stairwayAlex and Jax had come down. As two of the other nurses pulled keys from theirpockets and unlocked the doors, Alex spotted a purse on the lower workingcounter behind the higher public counter.He grabbed the purse and dumped the contents out onto the desk. A cell phoneslid across the counter. Alex snatched it up. As soon as he had the power on, hepunched the buttons.“Nine one one. What’s the nature of your emergency?”“Mother of Roses Psychiatric Hospital is on fire.”“What address?”“It’s the old hospital on Thirteenth Street.” Alex pressed his fingertips to hisforehead, trying to think. “I don’t know the exact address.”“Can you see flames, or smoke?”“I’m inside the building. The fire is on the top floor.”“How extensive is the fire?”“The entire top floor is ablaze. The fire alarms don’t work. The sprinklers andthe fire hoses don’t work. Get the fire department here now!”“They’re on their way, sir. Please stay on the line. What is your name?”Alex ignored the question. “I have to help the staff get people out of here!Hurry—get the fire trucks here!”He tossed the phone on the counter without hanging up. He saw the nurses out inthe wards rousing the patients. He headed for the stairs in the back to go downto the next floor. Jax was right behind him. At the doorway into the stairwellhe met one of the nurses coming back down. Her face was nearly as white as herdress.“It’s a solid wall of flame up there!”“A building this old is going to go up in a hurry,” he told her. “Help geteveryone out. There’s not much time. I’m going to warn the floors below.”She nodded. “All right.”Alex pointed toward the front counter. “Nine one one is on the cell phone. Tellthem your name and that you work here. Confirm what I told them about the firebeing out of control. Keep the phone with you, keep them on the line, but helpeveryone get out the fire escape and then follow them out and help the peoplefrom the ninth floor already down there.”The woman scooped up the phone and with barely contained panic in her voicestarted telling the operator about the fire and how many hundreds of people werein danger. She told the operator to send ambulances as there were bound to becasualties. Alex didn’t wait to hear the rest of it. He raced for the stairs,pulling Jax along behind.As they burst through the stairway door, a red-faced orderly, nearly out ofbreath, was just arriving at the top step. Alex skidded to a halt and drew backas the man slashed wildly with a knife.Alex seized the knife hand and twisted the man’s arm at the same time as he spunhim around, then shoved him face-first down the stairs. The tumbling man stoppedat the middle landing between floors, smacking into the far wall. Jax boundeddown the steps after him and rammed her knife into his back half a dozen timesbefore he had a chance to get up. As soon as she had dispatched the orderly, thetwo of them raced down the last half of the stairs to the next floor.On the seventh floor the nurses were equally surprised, but perhaps becausepeople in their ward weren’t locked down, they were more easily convinced. Atseeing that the alarm, phones, and extinguisher didn’t work, they wasted no timespringing into action. One of the nurses started calling 911 on her cell phoneas the others enlisted a staff of orderlies and aides to help them clear thewards.Unlike the top two floors, the doors weren’t locked. The wards on the seventhfloor were also much larger, extending out past the footprint of the eighth andninth floors into the rest of the old hospital complex. The staff was alsolarger.“The fire department is on its way,” the nurse on the phone reported.“Do you know people in other parts of the hospital?” Alex asked. She nodded thatshe did. “Call them. Get anyone with a cell phone to call people as well. Withthe alarm not working people in the rest of the hospital need to be alerted.Call everyone you can and tell them to get the patients out.”Before she had a chance to ask any questions, Alex headed back to the stairs. Heand Jax slid to a halt at the top step. He could hear, just out of sight aroundthe turn of the landing, what sounded like a lot of men racing up the stairs. Bythe things they were saying Alex instantly recognized that the men were lookingfor him and Jax. One of the men called them “Vendis’s prisoners.”Without pause Alex spun Jax around and pushed her out ahead of him, back the waythey had come. Once out of the nurses’ station, he took her hand and ran withher down the dimly lit corridor. She was having trouble keeping up. Her legsweren’t working in a coordinated manner. He knew that her muscles were so spentthat they were failing.“Hold on, not much longer,” he said, trying to encourage her and keep hermoving.As they raced down the corridor, he glanced back over his shoulder and saw menspilling out into the hallway, but they were too far away and it was too dark tomake out their faces. Alex knew by their numbers, though, that they had to beorderlies he hadn’t met before. That confirmed his suspicion that there weremore people involved than just those he had seen working on the ninth floor.Alex slowed a little to try to make it look like they were urgently helpingpeople and less like they were running. He was counting on the white coats theywere wearing to help throw the people hunting them off track.He and Jax helped the nurses by rushing into rooms and pulling people out oftheir beds, then guiding them to the fire escape. Jax was swift and decisive ingetting people moving, while managing to also be compassionate and supportive.It was all the more impressive to him because he could see by the look in hereyes that she was fighting the effect of the drugs in her system. He knew alltoo well what that was like; he was having to work past them as well.The people followed directions as Alex calmly but forcefully urged them tohurry. These patients were far more alert and coherent than the people up on theninth floor had been. He guided the growing throng to the fire escape, lettinghimself and Jax become lost in the mass of frightened people. He saw the mencoming down the hall, searching in each room along the way.Out on the fire escape they were greeted by cool night air. Fresh air had neverfelt so good. Alex was a little surprised to find himself giddy with relief tobe out of the place. For a long time he had feared that he would never again befree. He wished that his mother could have tasted freedom with him.Jax leaned closer to him so she could whisper as they made their way down themetal steps along with what seemed like hundreds of other people. “When we getto the ground we need to run before those men can find us. I don’t think that Ihave enough strength left to fight them.”They slowed at a landing, inching ahead, waiting for the congested line ofpeople to start moving more quickly again. “I need the keys to the truck,” hereminded her.“But the keys are inside.” She knew what he was thinking and clearly didn’t likethe idea. “We’d have to go back in. Now that we’re out, when we get to theground, let’s just run.”“You can hardly stand anymore. How far do you think you can run? Where will wego on foot? How can we get away? We can’t hide—they’ll be looking everywhere forus. We need the truck to get away—as far away as possible.”As the line started shuffling ahead a little faster, Alex heard glass breaking.He glanced up and saw flames roar out of the windows on the top floor. Thicksmoke swirled out into the darkness.He also saw two men dressed in white pushing past people to get down the stairsfaster.“We need to get down, now,” he whispered to Jax.She glanced up and, seeing the men coming for them, stayed close behind him ashe started gently nudging people aside so that the two of them could get by. Heneeded to keep distance between them and the men coming after them, but at thesame time he didn’t want to make it too obvious lest the men spot him and Jaxrunning.Alex excused himself to the people on the stairs, repeating along the way thathe needed to help patients on the ground.The descent of the seven flights of metal stairs, even pushing past people,seemed like it was taking forever. Alex kept track of the distance back to themen hunting them. The men were getting closer all the time, because they werefar rougher about pushing people out of the way. At least most people, when theysaw the white coats he and Jax were wearing and heard his repeated explanation,did their best to let them by.A lot of the patients were petrified to be up on the rickety metal fire-escapestairs at night. They held on to the railing for dear life, inching along at asnail’s pace. They bottlenecked the people above them trying to get down. Jaxgently but firmly lifted the hands of more than one person from the railing andwith encouragement and reassurance got them moving.From his vantage point up on the stairs among the confused people making whatthey considered to be a terrifying descent, he gazed out over throngs of peoplescreaming, crying, running, wandering aimlessly, even sitting down, in themiddle of a near-stampede. The thought occurred to him that he couldn’t imaginea scene any more chaotic than mental patients trying to escape a fire.Irrational people in the hundreds were unable to cope with the necessary butsimple task of getting away from a burning building. Half of them, it seemed,were crying for help and waiting for it to show up rather than escape the area.Pushing past the frightened people on the stairs, Alex and Jax finally made itto the ground. They found themselves in the rear of the hospital among hundredsof people all rushing about in confusion. In the distance people were alsopouring down emergency stairs from other areas of the institution.There were a few orderlies and nurses trying to organize the patients and tellthem where they needed to go. There were patients who were staying at thehospital for less serious conditions and some of them, too, were trying to helptheir fellow patients away from the burning building. There were a few people,driven by insanity, who, like salmon trying to swim upstream, were trying topush their way up the stairs against the flow of people coming down.The lights suddenly went out as the electricity failed. The emergency generatorsshould have kicked in. They didn’t. Two battery-backup security lights did comeon, but they were far from adequate to light the whole back area of thehospital.In the near darkness the fire looming above them seemed all the morefrightening. The eighth floor was now also fully involved. Alex could see flamesmaking their way across the roof from there to the main part of the hospital. Healso saw fire on the fifth floor. He suspected that it had been set, just likethe fire on the top floor had been.Panicked people cried out and rushed faster to get away from the building asglass blown out of windows by the fire rained down on them. People on the groundwere speared by shards of falling glass. Bloody people cried out for help. Somepeople stumbled and fell in the darkness. Alex and Jax helped a number of themto their feet so that they could get away.All the while, they steadily and silently made their way across the flowingcurrent of people coming off the fire escapes and running away from thebuilding. Alex had walked over the uneven ground that rose and fell over theroots of the big old trees often enough that he could probably have done it withhis eyes closed, so the near darkness wasn’t a hindrance.Over the bobbing heads of people, he spotted a couple of the orderlies comingthrough the back parking lot. They pawed through the escaping people, searching,looking at everyone.Alex rose up on his tiptoes and waved an arm to get their attention. He figuredthat they wouldn’t be able to recognize him in the flickering light of theflames, and they would only key in on his white coat. When they saw him, hepointed urgently away from the hospital.“They’re over there!” he yelled. “They went that way!”The bluff worked. The two men turned away and took off in the direction he hadpointed to.Jax arched an eyebrow at him. “That was risky.”“Not as risky as them catching up to us.”At the metal entrance door, he gently pulled, testing it. It was locked. Hesearched through the keys, trying each in turn, not knowing if Henry would havehad a key to unlock an exterior door. The fourth key worked.Alex paused to glance back over his shoulder at Jax.She gave him a look. “I’m not waiting here,” she said before he could suggestit. “Hurry up. Let’s get what you need and get out of here before those men findus.”Alex opened the door just enough for them both to slip inside. There was oneemergency, battery-powered light some distance down a hall to the side. The exitsign above them over the door was lit up, casting the room in an eerie red glowthat gave them at least a little light to see by. The sudden silence inside theplace was unnerving.Alex smelled gas.He looked down the dark corridor toward where he knew the kitchens were, but hecouldn’t see anything.“They must have opened a gas line,” he whispered to Jax.“What does that do?”He looked at her, realizing then that she wouldn’t know, and realizing, too, howmuch the drugs were affecting him. He explained as he made his way through thedimly lit room toward the metal detector. “Natural gas is used in the kitchens,in the ovens and stoves, to make fire. It’s highly flammable. If it isn’tcontrolled, and enough of it escapes out into the air, it can easily explode.”“Then we should get out of here, now.”“You’re right. I just need to get the keys first.”Jax skirted the metal detector and stood at the desk where Doreen usually sat,waiting as Alex groped around in the dark and finally located the table againstthe wall. He felt along the back of the tabletop and found a lone tub. Hereached inside and to his relief his keys were still there along with hispocketknife.“Got it.”“Alex!”He spun around to see Dwayne silhouetted against the red exit light. He came outof the dark swinging a nightstick. As Alex ducked, Jax snatched the blue penattached to the clipboard and yanked it off, breaking the string.Before Alex had finished ducking the swing of the nightstick, she used the pento stab the side of the guard’s neck three times in rapid succession. He criedout. His hands flew to the puncture wounds in his throat. At the same time heturned to attack her. That was a mistake. As he lifted his nightstick Jaxstabbed his eyes out with two lightning-quick jabs.Before he could let out much of a scream, Alex had him from behind. He grippedthe man’s jaw and twisted with all his might until he heard a sickening crunchof sinew and bone. He let the limp Dwayne slip to the floor.“Why didn’t you use the knife?” he asked as she dropped the bloody pen.She looked on the verge of frustrated tears. “My fingers are numb. They’re notworking very well.” She gestured vaguely. “I must have dropped the knife outthere somewhere.”Alex put an arm around her waist when he saw her start to sink. “It’s all right.You’ll be able to rest as soon as we get to the truck. You’ll be all right afterthe drugs wear off and you get some sleep.”“I’m not sure I can make it, Alex.”“Sure you can. I’ll help you.” He tried to sound more confident than he was.She glanced back toward the door. “I remember them saying that Dwayne waswaiting to let Yuri in when he came back.”Alex nodded. “I remember. I’ve got my keys. Let’s get out of here before Yurigets here or the place blows up. We’ve done everything we can.”"},{"pageContent":"41.SIRENS WAILED IN THE NIGHT as Alex hurried Jax along the sidewalk. It seemedlike dozens of emergency vehicles were converging on Mother of Roses. Reddishorange light from the blaze reflected off the low overcast. Through the treesAlex could see crackling streamers of hot yellow sparks ascending throughbillowing black smoke. From time to time great gouts of flame lashed up towardthe clouds.The noise of all the sirens had sleepy people emerging from their houses to seewhat was going on. Leaves were lit by red, blue, and yellow strobes of emergencyvehicles racing toward Mother of Roses. People stood in their nightclothes onfront porches watching in shock.Many more people, patients in pajamas and nightgowns, ran down the street pastAlex and Jax. Police cars rushing in toward the hospital had to slow in placesfor the throngs to part. He didn’t know where all the people were running. Theyprobably didn’t, either. They were simply filled with fear and wanted to getaway. Their terror over being awakened by fire and the uncertainty of what wouldhappen to them now had many sobbing as they wandered aimlessly.Alex kept a constant lookout over his shoulder to see if anyone followed them.So far he hadn’t seen anyone who looked overtly suspicious. It was dark, though,and there were a lot of people flooding through the streets. He hoped that inthe throng of people escaping the hospital they had lost the men chasing them,but he had no way to tell if any of the people in the darkness were from anotherworld.Alex turned down a smaller side street as he made his way toward where his truckwas parked. He didn’t know if they would be safer out on the streets with allthe people, or if it would be better to cut through alleys and backyards.Once they were off the streets, they wouldn’t know their way. That would slowthem down. Worse, they might find themselves trapped in a box canyon of fenceswhen the men chasing them caught up. And cutting through yards would drawattention.In the end, he decided to stay on the streets.As they made their way along the broken sidewalk, Jax was becoming dead weight.Her legs kept giving out. Fortunately, they weren’t far from his Cherokee.Alex was having difficulties of his own. It took a great effort to focus enoughto work past the drugs the nurse had gotten into him. His vision was blurred. Hehoped he could see well enough to drive. He didn’t know if his racing heartwould ever calm down.With everything that had happened he didn’t think that he would have to worryabout falling asleep—at least for the time being. But he did need to find them asafe place where they could both get much-needed rest.If he felt dulled by the drugs, Jax was laboring under an even heavier dose. Shehadn’t been able to stop taking the Thorazine and pills the way he had; they hadonly reduced her dose enough so that she could feel pain and terror, yet notfight back. After her ordeal of hanging in the shower for over twenty-fourhours, he was amazed that she could move at all.“It’s just down the block. We’re almost there. Hold on.”She nodded. “I’m fine.”“Yeah, right.”She smiled a little. Her right foot was dragging. He wasn’t sure she was evenaware of it. He was holding most of her weight so she could keep going.Alex kept thinking about his mother being burned up in the fire. Ben had burnedup in a fire, and now his mother had as well. He couldn’t stop wondering whatwould have happened if he’d gotten her out. He wondered if when the drugs woreoff she’d have been able to communicate with him, talk about everything that hadhappened in her life, in his, or if her mind was long gone. Now he would neverknow.At least she’d had the presence of mind to stop the nurse. In the end, she hadfought back against her captors. In the end she’d won a battle against them.That was something.“Here,” Alex said. “We’re here. Hold on. I’ll have you inside in a minute andyou can relax.”Jax forced herself to stand straighter as he unlocked the passenger door. “Don’tlet yourself get complacent, Alexander,” she reminded him. “Carelessness withthese people will get you killed.”That was why she refused to give up, why she forced herself to stay as alert asshe possibly could. To relax was to die.Alex helped her step up into the passenger seat. He folded her right leg up intothe truck.“Once we’re away from the hospital, you could get some sleep.”“My knives. Please, I want my knives.”As Alex reached under the seat and pulled the bundle out, a horrific explosionshook the night. The sky lit with the orange and yellow fireball.As Alex turned to the explosion, he saw an orderly dressed in white barreling athim out of the darkness. The man was huge, and he had a knife.Without even thinking, Alex grabbed a handle of one of the knives in the bundleand pulled it out. Despite the adrenaline rush of his sudden alarm, the balanceof the knife, the feel, made an impression somewhere in the recesses of hismind.As the man charged toward him, with no time to do anything more than simplyreact, Alex thrust the knife straight into the man’s center mass.It didn’t stop him. The big man crashed into him at full speed, knocking Alexback.As Alex rebounded off the side of the truck, the man swung his own knife. Alexducked, seized the arm, and took it with him as he circled around the orderly.Once behind him he rammed his blade into the man’s lower back several times inrapid succession. He didn’t hit anything immediately vital, and his stabbingonly made the man angrier.The man twisted around, driving Alex back with his feet as well as his fists.More than one connected, staggering Alex back. The man was a fury of nonstoplunges and slashes. With the drugs, Alex had difficulty focusing.The man was a good head taller than Alex and must have been sixty or seventypounds heavier. Despite his size, he was quick. Not only was he hard to handle,but his size seemed to help keep the knife wounds from slowing him.Alex made another attack. The man threw him back. As he rebounded, Alex duckedunder a swing, threw a shoulder block into the man, and at the same time grabbeda leg. He pulled with all his strength, upending the orderly. The man landedflat on his back, but bounded back up as if on springs.His arms seemed to be everywhere at once. Alex was having trouble keeping trackof the furious attacks. He picked his openings and cut whenever he had thechance. One slashing cut across the man’s thigh halved the muscle, making himstumble.Alex used the opening to dive in to try to finish the fight. He seized the man’sknife-wielding arm and stabbed again, but the man was strong enough to push himback. Alex felt like a child trying to fight a grown man.When the man spun around, pulling out of Alex’s grip, his arms were spread in anangry fighting stance. He looked like a bear on its hind legs about to charge.Seeing the opening, Alex used all his strength to drive his knife like a punchstraight into the middle of the orderly’s throat.He felt the blade sink in and hit bone.The furious fight seemed to freeze in place.Then the man started to corkscrew toward the ground. As he collapsed, his weightpulled him off the blade.Panting, catching his breath, his exhausted arms hanging, Alex tried to gatherhis wits. He was so drained, so bone-tired from the fight, that he was ready todrop.Jax was suddenly there beside him, putting her arm around him, holding him up.“Almost there,” she reminded him. “Hold on.”He smiled at her words, words he had used to encourage her not to give up.Alex felt like he was watching himself in a dream. He realized then, by the wayJax was bent over, that he was on his knees. He didn’t remember going to hisknees.“Stay still,” she said.Jax turned away to the open door of the truck for a moment. She was franticallydoing something. He couldn’t figure it out. It finally dawned on him that shewas ripping cloth. It was the rag the knives had been in. She was tearing off along strip.She put the strip around his upper left arm, wrapping it tightly around severaltimes. She used her teeth to split the end and then tied a knot. She madeanother knot and drew it tight.“What are you doing?”“He cut you. I’m tying a bandage around your arm to keep the wound closed. Ineed to stop the bleeding.”Alex only then realized that blood was dripping off his fingers. He wondered howbad it was. He didn’t really feel any pain, but at feeling a warm, wet sheath ofblood running down his arm he suddenly began feeling sick.“It’s all right,” she assured him. “You’ll be fine.”By the way her voice sounded, though, he didn’t know if he believed her.“How bad is it?”“It’s dark. I can’t tell,” she admitted. “But I don’t think it’s too bad. Canyou move your fingers?”Alex tried. “Yes.”“Then you’re fine. As long as your arm still works, it can’t be too bad.”“Thank you,” he said in a numb voice. “I don’t understand why he was trying tokill me. If I’m dead they can’t get the information they need.”“He wasn’t trying to kill you. He was trying to capture you. If he had wanted tokill you I think he could have.”“Well, from my side of it it sure felt like he was trying to kill me.”She only smiled as she adjusted the bandage on his arm. Alex liked the feelingof her taking care of him. It made him feel calm, feel like everything would beall right.She gently took the knife out of his hand. “I don’t ever let anyone use myknife. Not this one.”Alex saw in the dim illumination of the dome light in the Jeep that it was theknife with all the elaborate engraving on the silver handle. Now it was coveredin blood as well.“It seemed rather important at the time,” Alex said. “Do you think you couldmake an exception to your rule this one time?”“Well,” she said, glancing down at the dead man, “I guess that, in this case, Icould.”With a concerned, gentle look, she smoothed the hair back off his forehead. Herface warmed with the special smile she gave only him. Her hand cupping the sideof his face made everything better.“Considering who used that knife,” she said in an intimate voice, “I guess it’sall right. You’re welcome to use it anytime you’d like.”Alex swayed on his knees. “I think I’m going to throw up.”“Do it in that direction, will you? I need to send him back to my world.”Alex was going to tell her not to bother, that they could just drive away andleave him. But as his mind started working again he realized what a bad idea itwould be to leave a body lying in the street. With so many people around, theman would be discovered in short order. Alex could see people off in thedarkness. Fortunately they didn’t see what was going on.The dead people they had left in Mother of Roses would be burned up. There wouldbe little evidence of what had really happened. But if they left this man’s bodyout on the street it would look like murder and raise a lot of questions.By the time he had come to the conclusion that Jax was right, the man hadalready vanished. Her knife was shiny and clean.Jax put a hand under his good arm to help him up. “Come on. Let’s get away fromhere before any of his friends show up.”Alex was regaining his senses. He helped boost Jax up into the truck. Theadrenaline of the situation seemed to have given them both a shot of strength.He didn’t know how long it would last. He ran around to the other side andhopped in.When he turned the key in the ignition and the truck didn’t start, he wasn’t theleast bit surprised. Trying the key had been nothing more than a token gesture.He had expected it not to start. That was just the way the world worked. Forsome reason it seemed that things tended not to work when you needed them themost.Fortunately, he had planned for the eventuality. He’d parked on a hill, and he’dparked at the end of the block so that no one could park in front of him andblock him in.He turned the wheels away from the curb as he put in the clutch. The Cherokeestarted rolling, gathering speed. When it was going downhill at a good clip helet the clutch out. The engine turned over and caught. With a minimum of fuss,he had the truck running, but he was more determined than ever to get it fixedas soon as they got the chance.Alex drove slowly down the hill through the residential neighborhood. There wereno cars, but there were people wandering all over the place. Here and there aperson in pajamas or a robe would walk out into the street without looking. Inthe darkness it was difficult to see them all. Alex kept a sharp lookout for anyof the staff who might be hunting them.When he turned right onto Sixteenth Street, traffic was moving slowly, pullingover at intervals for emergency vehicles. Fire trucks, ambulances, and policecars raced through the night toward the hospital.Alex stayed in the right lane, pulling to the curb and stopping for every one ofthem. He didn’t want to be stopped by police and have to answer any questions.At that moment, he couldn’t imagine what he would tell them about what he wasdoing there at that time of night. He couldn’t say he was visiting his mother,not at night.He was too tired to think. Best to avoid the problem altogether.When the traffic cleared, he stayed close to the speed limit of forty-five as heheaded toward the interstate. The interstate would be the fastest way to putsome distance between them and anyone who might be looking for them. The olderpart of town was quiet that late at night. He kept an eye on the rearviewmirror, checking to make sure that they weren’t being followed. The road behindwas empty. Most of the people out that late were interested in seeing the fire.Alex was sure that the fire department had shut off the gas to the hospital andthat had minimized the explosion. It had been bad enough, but not anything likeit could have been. He hoped everyone had gotten out safely. He guessed he knewthat not everyone had.Jax was slumped in her seat, leaning against the door, her hand resting on herleg. He reached over and squeezed the hand.“We’re safe now. If you want you can crawl in the back seat to lie down and goto sleep.”She pulled her hair back off her face and hooked it behind an ear. “Where are wegoing?”“I want to find us a motel or something, some place we can rent a room for thenight. We’re near the interstate highway. It shouldn’t take long to get safelyaway from here before we stop. We both need rest and time to let these drugswear off.”“I’ll wait, then,” she said. “Before we sleep, though, I’m going to need aneedle and thread.”“What for?”“To stitch up that gash on your arm. It needs to be closed up.”Alex nodded, but he didn’t like the thought of having her sew on his arm, atleast not without some kind of local anesthesia. He didn’t want to stop in at anemergency room, though. They would have questions. He wasn’t in the mood tothink up answers to questions.He tested his injured left arm a little. It was beginning to ache in earnest.The pain throbbed with each beat of his heart. He couldn’t hold the wheel withhis left hand alone. The pressure needed to turn the wheel hurt.He glanced in the rearview mirror to look back at the fire.Just as he did, there was a soft thud to the air that Alex felt as a thump deepin his chest. He’d felt that thump before.In the mirror he saw a dark smudge swirl in the air behind them in the backseat. As soon as he saw it, the indistinct, dark swirl of night changed into avortex of vapor.The vapor condensed into a shape.A man in a dark leather vest and no shirt lunged at them from out of the backseat, from out of another world."},{"pageContent":"42.THE MAN IN THE BACK SEAT threw an arm around both Jax’s and Alex’s necks at thesame time, pulling them back against the seat, choking them both. His bare armswere massively muscled. Alex’s vision dimmed down to a narrow, dark tunnel. Thepowerful arm was cutting off his blood supply as well as his air. Out of thecorner of his eye he could see Jax’s arms and legs flailing and he knew the manwas hurting her even more.Alex tried to reach the steering wheel. The way the man’s arm had him around thethroat, pinning him back to the seat, Alex couldn’t pull away. Try as he might,he couldn’t reach the brake, either.He was only able to sporadically get his fingertips on the steering wheel. Thetruck slowly started taking an arcing course across the road, toward oncomingtraffic. As Alex brushed the wheel with his fingertips, it started back theother way, toward the right side of the road. He struggled to correct with thewheel to keep them from crashing into a light pole.He couldn’t get a breath. He tried to twist enough to steer with his left handand pull at the arm with his right, but the fingertips of one hand weren’tenough to steer. Alex used his knees to steady the wheel and switched to usingboth hands to try to pry the arm away. He reached back, trying to get ahold offingers, but couldn’t reach them.His lungs burned for air. He was starting to have difficulty focusing hisvision. He knew that if he didn’t do something, and soon, he would loseconsciousness. If that happened, it was all over—they would have him.He could hear strangled sounds coming from Jax as she desperately struggled tobreathe. Out of the corner of his eye Alex could see her face turning red. Hecould also see that her arms were hardly moving anymore.The powerfully built man growled with the effort of keeping his arms clampedaround them both. In the position he was in, Alex had no chance to gain theadvantage.He tried again but couldn’t reach the brake. He couldn’t reach the gas pedal,either, but since they were going down a slight grade the truck wasn’t slowing.In his rush to get away from the hospital, he hadn’t retrieved his gun. He hadfigured that once they were safely away he would then get it out from under theseat. He had thought that if any of Vendis’s men tried to stop them he wouldhave enough time to get the gun out. He hadn’t figured on a man materializing inhis back seat.He could think of nothing else but to try to reach under the seat for his gun.Try as he might, though, he couldn’t get to it. It might as well have been amile away.He abandoned his attempt to get the arm off his throat. He pushed back againstthe man behind them to force him to change his hold a little. Just as the manloosened and moved his arm a bit to improve his hold, Alex lunged forward withall his strength.Alex managed to grab the steering wheel with both hands.He immediately cranked the wheel to the right. They were going slow enough thatthe front tires stuck and the truck cut violently to the right, hitting the curband going up over it.Between the sudden right turn and bouncing up over the curb, the man was thrownhard to the left. He probably didn’t know anything about riding in a truck; itdidn’t appear that he was prepared for such a maneuver. He had such a hold onJax that as he was thrown to the left he took her with him, pulling her by theneck, half between and half over the seats.As he slid across the back seat, his head slammed into the metal of the dooralong the bottom of the window. The blow caused his stranglehold around both ofthem to loosen a little. He didn’t let go, but it was enough that they bothcould at last get desperately needed air. He could hear Jax gasp several times.Being pulled up out of her seat as she was, and with enough air to regain herwits, Jax was at last able to reach around and pull a knife from the small ofher back. When the man had fallen over to the left, he not only pulled her back,but turned her a little, facing more toward Alex. She brought the knife aroundand sliced cleanly through the upper ligament of the biceps of the arm holdingAlex. Their attacker cried out in pain and rage as his slack arm slipped offAlex.Alex immediately slammed on the brakes. The man, already off balance, slid offthe seat, down onto the narrow floor area. He lay sideways, stuffed into a spacethat was too small for him, but despite everything, his beefy arm remainedlocked around Jax’s neck.Pulled over as she was on her back, between the seats, and held by the throat,she was unable to maneuver. He had pressure on her throat again, cutting off herair. Her movements slowed as she started to lose consciousness. The man wasobviously intent on breaking her neck, but being on the floor with her partly ontop and somewhat behind him, he was having trouble accomplishing that task. Heappeared perfectly willing to simply strangle her.As the man fought to gain his balance and get up, Alex yanked the syringe fromhis pocket and popped the cap off with his thumb. In one swift movement heturned and thrust the needle down into the side of the man’s bull neck. Hepushed the plunger home.The man kicked and bellowed in rage, struggling to get up. Alex stabbed the gasand slammed on the brakes, jerking the truck to keep him off balance. With hisinjured arm, he still managed to grab Alex’s hair in his fist. Alex could tellthat he was slowing from the drugs, his movements becoming less coordinated.Still, Jax was in desperate trouble. She, too, was hardly moving as she lostconsciousness.Alex stripped the silver knife out of her hand. He pulled away from the fistholding his hair, turned, and leaned over the back of his seat to stab down atthe man. As the man came up from the floor he met Alex’s blade on its way down.Alex added all his strength to thrusting the knife through the side of the man’sthroat.By the sudden spurts of blood, Alex knew that he’d hit an artery—the same onehe’d managed to hit with the syringe. By the sounds of the man’s breathing, heknew that he’d also hit the windpipe. The heavy volume of blood pumping from thesevered artery flowed down into the deep gash and into his lungs as he gaspedfor air. The man started drowning in his own blood.In the grip of the drugs and the throes of death, he finally let go of Jax. Shegulped in air. Even as she was gasping and regaining consciousness, she took theknife back from Alex. As the man’s arm flailed weakly about, his hand trying tograb her, she stabbed it. He reflexively, slowly, pulled the hand back andpressed it against the gaping wound in the side of his neck and throat. Itappeared he was trying to stop the bleeding.Alex was sickened by the messy act of killing a human being. It was a difficult,gruesome task.As the man’s struggles slowed, Jax began cutting symbols in his forehead. Shewasn’t waiting until he was dead. He managed to get out a gurgling curse as shegouged the lines of the design into his flesh.Alex turned his attention to getting the car off the grass and back on the roadbefore anyone came to see what was happening. With all the police cars in thearea that was all too real a risk.He didn’t see what Jax did, but the burbling curses died out in muffled grunts.In mid-grunt, it suddenly went silent inside the Jeep. A glance back between theseats confirmed what he thought: The man was gone, along with all the blood.Jax let out a huge sigh as she flopped back into her seat. She held her throatas she coughed.“Dear spirits, that hurt,” she said in a hoarse whisper.Alex had the Jeep back up to speed.“Stop!” she suddenly cried out. “Stop the truck right now!”Alex, surprised by her screamed command, slammed on the brakes. The Cherokeeslid to a stop. He pulled off the road onto a thinly graveled parking area onthe shoulder.“What? What’s the matter?”“I’m an idiot!” Jax growled.“What are you talking about?”Jax reached up, grabbed the rearview mirror, and twisted it until it ripped offthe windshield.“What the hell are you doing?”She threw open the door and heaved the mirror into the bushes. “Saving ourlives.”She retrieved her silver knife from the floor and used the pommel to smash theglass in the side mirror on the truck door. The glass broke into a spiderweb ofcracks. She bashed at it over and over with the butt of the knife handle untilall the pieces of glass were knocked out. A black socket with an adjustmentcable was all that remained.She ran around the front of the truck and did the same thing to thedriver’s-side mirror. When she had finished she rushed back around and got in.“Let’s go,” she said as she slammed the door shut. “Get us away from this lastspot they saw us! Go, go, go!”Alex checked over his shoulder and then dumped the clutch, spinning the wheelsin the gravel as he pulled the Cherokee back out onto the street.“You think they found us by the rearview mirrors?”She slumped back in her seat, comforting her neck. “How else?”He turned to look out the back window to make sure they weren’t being followed.He saw a big man in a leather vest running after them from the graveled parkingarea.With a cold wave of shock, Alex realized that the man must have arrived in thisworld right where the Jeep had been only a moment before. She had told him once,in the driveway of his house, that they usually arrived in pairs. That was thepartner of the man they had just killed and sent back.Alex stepped on the gas. The next time he looked back, they were too far awayfor him to see the man. He would never be able to follow or find them on foot.Alex let out a sigh of relief. He gripped the steering wheel tighter to try tostop his hands from shaking.Jax, also watching the man vanish in the distance behind, looked over at Alexout of the corner of her eye, as if to ask if he understood, now.“That was close,” he admitted. “But how am I going to drive without mirrors?”“Would you rather drive with new passengers arriving from my world every fewminutes?”“I guess not,” he admitted. He glanced over at her. “Are you all right, Jax?”Her brow wrinkled as she fought back tears while rubbing the muscles in herneck. “I think I will be after I get some sleep.”“Close your eyes,” he said in a gentle voice. “I’ll wake you when I get us aroom. Sleep until then.”She didn’t answer. He didn’t know if she’d fallen asleep or if she had passedout.Alex looked back over his shoulder. The road behind was empty. He wasn’t muchcomforted."},{"pageContent":"43.ALEX LEANED TO THE SIDE A LITTLE, trying to balance Jax’s weight with his rightarm and hip as he used his aching left arm to try to unlock the door. In hersemiconscious state, Jax did her best to stand, but her legs kept giving out,making his hand pull away from the keyhole. He at last managed to turn the keyin the lock. The door swung open.He used his foot to shut the door, then swept Jax up in his arms and carried herinto the room, following the well-worn track across the beige carpeting. It hurthis injured arm to hold her like that, but he figured it would be easier thantrying to get her up off the floor if she passed out completely.In her groggy state, she let out a soft moan as she put her arms around hisneck. She laid her head against his shoulder as he carried her into the darkroom. It made him imagine the innocent, feminine little girl she once had tohave been.A long rectangle of light from signs for the truck stops shining in through thewindow beside the door fell across the double beds. An older TV sat on the longcounter where it could be watched from bed. A tiny table with two wooden chairssat under the front window beside the door. It smelled a little musty, but hewasn’t about to complain. At that moment the small room looked like apresidential suite to him.Outside, semitrailer trucks constantly rumbled past on the interstate. He couldhear a TV on in the room beside theirs. Still, it was a relief to have whatappeared to be a safe place to stop, a place hidden away from all the peoplehunting them.Alex gently laid Jax on one of the two beds.“The mirrors, Alex,” she mumbled.“I know, I know.”He went into the bathroom, flicked on a buzzing fluorescent light, and drapedthe white bath mat over the mirror. He brought a towel out and hung it over themirror on the wall beside the TV. He adjusted the towel to make sure that notthe tiniest part of the mirror could peek through. He felt like his mother,draping things over mirrors.Alex pulled the cord, closing the heavy, ugly blue drapes, shutting out thegarish light of the truck-stop signs. Once the drapes were closed, he turned onthe lamp on the taller section of the long counter. The dark fake-wood veneerwas chipped along the edge of the counter from people hitting into it as theylifted their suitcases up to lay them open. The bedspreads were the same blue asthe curtains, with bands of burgundy designs that matched the valence above thewindow. It was tacky and cheap-looking, but it was a place to stop, to rest, tohide from the people hunting them, and for that reason Alex was delighted withthe room, already thinking of it fondly as home, at least home for the night.Jax sat up, blinking slowly at him, as if the single lamp he had turned on wastoo bright.“Lie down,” he told her.“I can’t. My bladder is going to burst.”“Oh. The bathroom is right there,” he said, pointing.He put a hand under her arm and helped her up. Using her legs after the stressof stretching up on her toes all night to breathe followed by the heart-poundingescape left standing almost more than she could manage. Without the spur ofterror, her muscles were giving out and her legs wobbled unsteadily.As he was helping her to the bathroom, she said, “I need a needle and thread. Ineed to sew up your arm.”He left her at the doorway into the bathroom. “We’ll worry about that tomorrow.”She gripped his shirt for support. “Now, Alex. We need to wash it and do ittonight or it will become infected.”Alex sighed. He had an idea.“All right. You go use the bathroom. Wash up for bed if you want. I’ll go getwhat we need and be right back. I’ll leave you the gun.”“No. I’m hidden inside. You will be out there where people can see you. You haveno way of knowing who might be looking. You take the gun. I have my knives.”He couldn’t imagine that she could fight very effectively in her condition, buthe didn’t want to argue and she did make sense. “I’ll be right back. I’ll knocktwice, pause, and knock twice again before I open the door so that you know it’sme coming back.”Alex locked the door and checked it before jogging across the parking lot. Itwas starting to drizzle. The inky blacktop reflected the bright light of signsoff its slick surface. The spotlights pointed up at signs for interstatetravelers illuminated the otherwise invisible mist drifting past.The cross street was busy, even late at night. People were coming off theinterstate for gas, to get something to eat, or to stop for the night. Truckswere pulling in and out of a nearby truck plaza.The convenience store had half a dozen truckers and other travelers inside. Alexcarefully checked each one for potential threat as he picked up a basket andwent to the coolers. A memory of the first time he’d met Jax flashed through hismind. She had looked at everyone that same way, checking for threat. Now heunderstood it so much better.He pulled a handful of packaged turkey slices off a peg in the cooler and threwthem in the basket. He grabbed some ham as well, along with a variety pack ofsliced cheese. He picked up a couple of six-packs of bottled water and a varietyof other small items he thought they might need.As he kept an eye on a big guy with long, greasy black hair and a beard, hestopped at the section with first-aid supplies and picked up the things heneeded. As far as Alex was concerned, the man looked a little too much like apirate. But in the end it seemed he was buying far too much beer to be a trackerfrom some distant world hunting the last Rahl.Nonetheless, it was comforting to have a Glock only a twitch away. After thebrawl in his truck had ended, he had quickly retrieved the gun from under theseat. It was a relief to have it handy. The next time someone from another worldshowed up, he vowed to be ready. They had been fortunate and survived a numberof surprise attacks. He didn’t want to be caught unprepared again.At the checkout counter he asked the clerk for two of the prepaid cell phones onthe rack against the back wall. Alex paid for everything with one of thehundred-dollar bills Sedrick Vendis had used to buy Alex’s six paintings.That seemed not only like a lifetime ago, but like a different life. Maybe itwas.When he got back to the room, Alex knocked with his special signal to let Jaxknow it was him. When he opened the door, he saw her sitting cross-legged on theend of the bed staring at the TV. There was a talk show on.“What are you doing?” he asked as he set the plastic bags on the small table.Jax looked rather alarmed. “I saw one of these things where they held us. I wasdrugged so I couldn’t pay much attention to it. But they have one here as well,just like at the crazy house. I saw a button that said ‘on,’ so I pushed it.”She pointed. “These pictures appeared.”Alex thought that having a TV in a “crazy house” was rather appropriate.The host on the TV was fawning over an actress who thought she was brilliantbecause she happened to have been born beautiful and read lines written by otherpeople. It amazed Alex what qualified a person for being worthy of adulation.“Why are you watching this?”Jax looked up again. He could see that she was so sleepy that she could hardlykeep her eyes open.“This is something like watching this world through mirrors.” She gestured tothe TV. “I wanted you to see this.”“I’ve seen TV before.” Alex switched it off. “You mean to say that this is whatit looks like when you saw me through the mirrors in my studio?”She made a face as she considered. “Not exactly, not this clear, but in someways it looks much the same. I was astounded when I saw this.”Her gaze drifted away. “It . . . reminded me of home.”Alex understood then. “Oh.”He took off his jacket and for the first time, because they were finally in thelight, saw that his shirtsleeve was completely caked with dried blood.Jax patted the bed beside her. “Come sit.”She used her knife to cut the sleeve away from the rest of his shirt. Once hehad his shirt off, she cut the length of the remaining sleeve and helped himpull it away from his skin. On his way to the bathroom to wash the wound, he setthe security latch on the door.As sleepy as she looked, Jax followed him into the bathroom and helped him undothe bandage she had put around the wound. Her concern for him seemed to havegiven her a second wind as she worked. She washed the blood off his arm andthen, being as careful as she could, she cleaned the wound while he held his armover the sink. Washing it made the pain flare up, and made it start bleedingagain. He winced against the pain.When Alex really saw the cut for the first time, he cursed under his breath. Hewondered if maybe he really should go to an emergency room. He quickly decidedagainst it.“Here,” he said, “put this antibiotic in the cut.”“Did you get the needle and thread?” she asked as she drizzled the brown liquidin the wound. It stung like mad.“I got something better,” he said as he opened a package of superglue, gettingit ready.“What could be better?” she asked as she dabbed his arm dry with a towel afterit stopped bleeding.“Just hold it closed and I’ll show you.”She used both hands to do as he asked, carefully aligning the sides of thewound. With two fingers, Alex pressed the top layer of the cut tight together.With his thumb and third finger he squeezed the tube of superglue, spreading itgenerously down the length of the cut. He went back over the places where ithadn’t closed completely and added more glue on top of the cut.“What are you doing?” Jax asked in astonishment.“Superglue.”“Superglue?” It sounded like an exotic foreign word when she said it.“Yes, good old superglue. Bonds skin instantly. They use it in surgery now.”He waited a few minutes just to be sure, then took his fingers away. The deepwound stayed tightly closed.“See? Easier than stitches.”She gently tested it with a finger. “I think you’re a big baby and are afraid tohave me stitch your arm.”“Just wrap it with that gauze, will you, please?”Jax smiled at his annoyance and wound the gauze snugly around the arm, nottrusting the glue to hold. After that, he had her wrap it with the tan stretchbandage. When she had finished, he moved the arm, testing it. The bandagingwasn’t too tight, but it was tight enough to cocoon the wound and protect it. Hethought that it ought to heal fine, wrapped as it was.Seeing her eyes keep closing, he helped her out to the other room. He turneddown the bed for her and got an extra pillow out of the tiny closet to add tothe two thin pillows on the bed.She sat on the end of the bed and pulled off a boot. “Did you see? They have abathing tub in there. A real bathing tub.”Alex smiled at her amazement. “In the morning we’ll flip a coin to see who goesfirst.”She looked at him out of one eye. “Didn’t your mother ever teach you ‘ladiesfirst’?”“I guess that our worlds share some important things.”When she saw his smile fade, she said, “Sorry.”Alex nodded. “I know. Me too. I wish . . . well, I’m just glad that she wasthere to help us when she did. If not for her, I think they might have had us.”Jax nodded as she put her leg up onto her knee to pull off her other boot. “Wakeme at dawn.”“I need you well, Jax. You need rest now or you’re going to end up worse off.We’re safe here for the time being.”She stared into his eyes a moment. “I know, but we need . . . we need . . .” Shesquinted as she tried to think. “Something . . .”“We need your mind working or we’re sunk, that’s what we need. You’re the onewho figured out what they want.”“The gateway,” she mumbled as her eyes started to close. Her hand had stoppedwith the boot only half off. She looked too exhausted to complete the task.Alex pulled her boot the rest of the way off, then helped her lie down. Hepulled the covers up over her. “I paid for two nights so that we wouldn’t haveto worry about checkout time in the morning. I hung the ‘Do not disturb’ sign onthe doorknob. We can get up and leave whenever we want. You need to rest.”“But . . .”He knelt beside the bed, gazing into her half-closed brown eyes. “I need you,Jax. I need you well and alert. You need rest. Do this for me?”She reached out and cupped the side of his face. “Thank you, Alex—foreverything. You need sleep, too.”“I know. I think we’ll be safe here. Sleep and get strong for me.”“I don’t want to stop looking at you,” she whispered. “I’m so relieved thatyou’re safe. I was so afraid for you. . . .”Alex smoothed her hair back as he smiled at her.And then he leaned in and gently kissed her. Her lips felt better than he hadever imagined. Her hand came around to lightly hold the back of his head for amoment as she returned the gentle kiss. It was a simple act of quiet joy, sayingmore than words ever could have how relieved they were to have each other safe.As he got up to get into the other bed, she softly called his name. He turnedback and knelt again beside her bed.“What is it?”“Alex . . . I was so afraid there, at that place.”“I know. I was terrified for you.”“I thought I was going to die alone, like so many others Vendis has gotten hishands on. I thought my life was at its end.” Her eyes welled up with tears. “Iwas so afraid. It hurt so much and I was so afraid. I’m so far from home. Idon’t know if I will ever see home again. I feel so alone.”Alex gently squeezed her hand. “I know.”When he started to get up, she pulled him back down by his hand. “Alex, wouldyou lie close to me so that I don’t feel alone tonight? Just lie by me so thatI’m not alone?”Alex smiled. “Sure.”He kicked off his shoes, turned off the light, and lay down on his back besideher. He pulled the bedspread up over them both. Jax nestled close to him.“Hold me? Please? Just hold me?”Alex didn’t say anything, fearing to test his voice. He would have givenanything, paid any price, just to hold her.As he slipped his arm around her, she laid her head on his shoulder. With hisother hand he gently smoothed her hair.If she noticed how fast his heart was beating, she didn’t say so. Alex kissedthe top of her head. “Sleep well.”Her breathing slowed and evened out almost immediately. She was asleep in meremoments.Alex stared at the ceiling in the near darkness, not wanting to go to sleep lesthe miss a moment of the simple bliss of holding her in his arms.But he didn’t last long before he drifted off, the whole time thinking of theprecious woman so close to him, safe, for the moment."},{"pageContent":"44.WITH A FINGER, ALEX OPENED the curtains just a crack to peek out, looking foranything out of place. It was a heavily overcast, gray day, but it wasn’training. The Cherokee was parked right outside their room. He didn’t see anyoneout in the parking lot who looked suspicious. He reminded himself that Dr.Hoffmann, the nurses, and the orderlies at Mother of Roses had never lookedsuspicious to him.They didn’t all look like pirates.Alex felt wide awake, truly awake, for the first time in what seemed like daysand days. He was foggy on exactly how many days it had been, but he knew thatthe whole ordeal at Mother of Roses hadn’t been more than a few days. Some ofthe things that had happened didn’t seem real. The reality of how many peoplehad died—how many people he had killed—was hard to wrap his mind around. It feltlike he was coming out of a long, dark dream filled with endless terror.He felt a profound empathy for his mother’s years of being lost in that livinglimbo. He was saddened that she had never been able to escape that private,lonely hell, that she never had a chance to live her life. He was heartbrokenand angry that people from another world had come here and done that toher—stolen her life—and in the end had murdered her.The worst part of that entire nightmare, though, had been seeing Jax hanginghelpless in the shower at Mother of Roses, seeing her struggle to breathe,fearing what horrific torture they would subject her to, dreading that she wouldeventually suffocate as she hung there all alone, like so many others thatVendis had had in his clutches.Now, after twelve hours of sleep, the drugs had largely worn off. He had escapedthe nightmare, some of it, anyway. Jax, too, for the most part looked like shewas almost back to normal. He had no words for how relieved he was to see hereyes so bright and alive again. She was sore and bruised, but she was alive.That was what mattered.He heard the tub finish draining, and in a few minutes she came out dressed infresh jeans and a red top. The color looked stunning with her blond hair, evenif her hair wasn’t dry. She rubbed it with a towel, drying it as best she could.He gestured to the little refrigerator under the counter. “You want something toeat?”“No, not now. I’d rather get going and then eat.”She went back to toweling her hair dry.“You could use the hair dryer and have it dry a lot quicker.”She gave him a blank look. “The what?”Alex smiled. “Here, let me show you.”He took her into the bathroom and lifted the hair dryer off its rack. He turnedit on high and played it over her hair a moment before turning it off.“See?”“That’s amazing,” she said, taking it from his hand and looking it over. “I cando a similar thing with magic, but magic doesn’t work here. I didn’t realize youwould have technology to match it.” She handed the hair dryer back. “Do it somemore.”Alex switched it back on and directed the warm air around on her hair. Sheturned her back to him and let him work at blowing her long fall of wavy blondhair dry. When he had finished, she turned back around and looked him over.“How come you look clean?”“I took a shower while you were still asleep.”“Oh,” she said, going back out into the main room. “I thought that we agreedthat ladies go first.”Alex smiled. “I win any way I can, even if I have to break the rules.”She gave him a meaningful smile. “I’m glad you do.”“How do you feel?”“Like a new woman.”“Well, you look as beautiful as ever.”She smiled. “So do you.”“If you’re feeling better, then I’d like some answers,” Alex said, turningserious. “Before we were ambushed and the lights went out, my mother said thatthey asked her all the time about the gateway. When you heard thatword—gateway—you said that you had figured it out, that you knew what theywanted.”She nodded. “They want the gateway.”Alex rolled his eyes. “I got that much of it. But I don’t know what it means.”“Well,” she said as she started folding her dirty clothes and packing them intothe duffel bag they’d bought back at the outlet mall, “do you remember when Itold you about how I tried to take the painting you gave me back to my world toshow to people?”Alex nodded. “You said that on the journey back it simply vanished. You saidthat you didn’t know what happened to it, but that the experience confirmed whatpeople had suspected, that things couldn’t be taken back from this world toyours.”“So, if nothing can be taken back to my world, why would people from my worldcome here? Why would Radell Cain have been sending so many people here for solong? What could they possibly want, if they can’t take anything back?”“Knowledge, maybe?”“Well, I suppose that’s not out of the question, but I think that Cain wantssomething more basic. They’re after something specific and they’ve spent a longtime and a lot of effort trying to get it. Why do you suppose they kept yourmother prisoner all that time? Why do they want you?”“Obviously, I guess, they want the gateway. But I don’t know what that means.”Alex opened his hands in a gesture of frustration. “What the hell is a gateway?Why would they want it?”She tucked her folded jeans into the duffel bag and then straightened. “It haslong been speculated in some quarters that ever since our worlds were separated,some form of connection remained between them. It’s always been an obscuretheory, though.”Alex eyed her suspiciously. “So what does this obscure theory say?”“Well, do you remember me telling you how the Lord Rahl banished all thosepeople to this world to end the war?”“Yes. You said that they didn’t come here the way you did, that it was thoughtthat the worlds were for an instant joined at the same place and time and whenthey separated the people who wanted to live without magic were left in thisworld and your people in that one.”“That’s right. That’s why it’s called the separation event. Not a lot is knownabout what happened back then, but it’s thought that Lord Rahl somehow bridgedthe void between our worlds, brought them together for a spark in time in orderto send the people who didn’t want to live with magic here.”“You mean he sent them through a gateway?”“No, but according to this theory, there had to be an actual place ofconnection, a small breach in the void of nothingness between the worlds, anopening through time and space, that allowed everything to remain in balancewhile the worlds were brought together and then the separation was taking place.The fact that we can come here and return is claimed to be proof that theconnection still exists; otherwise, they say, we couldn’t cross the void betweenour worlds.“The gateway, some theorized, was a side effect of the separation event, ananomaly, an artifact, that remains to this day.“Other believers in this gateway say that it had to be created by Lord Rahl tobalance what he was doing, or the separation event could not have taken place.”“Seems to me to be a pretty important event. Why is this all just speculation?Why isn’t more known?”“At one time there were records, but the long period of the Golden Age ended inwars that resulted in the destruction of many of our most treasured records. Itwas a dark time. After it ended, we were left without much of our history.”Alex sighed. “So you think this separation event left a conduit between the twoworlds? A wormhole of some kind?”Jax shrugged. “I don’t know what a wormhole is. A conduit is a littlesimplistic, but I guess you could look at it that way. A better way to think ofit is as a kind of vent, a balance needed between the profound forces on eachside.”“Do you think this connection, this gateway, is a fact, or is this simply peoplemaking wild guesses about things that may or may not have once happened?”“It’s been inferred by some from what little is known about the separationevent. At least, it’s inferred by the few people who actually subscribe to this‘Gateway Theory.’ ”“Why didn’t you ever bring this up before? Why is it such a surprise? This wholegateway thing sounds pretty important.”“It may seem so now, but it’s actually an obscure, fringe theory. To be quitefrank, Gateway Theory has always been considered a crackpot notion. It neverentered my mind that this whole thing with Radell Cain could have anything to dowith such a crazy idea until I heard your mother say the word ‘gateway.’“That they would use that specific word to your mother suddenly made everythingthat’s been happening all come together for me. It suddenly all made sense.”“But even if this gateway once existed, in the beginning, do you think it stillexists?”“I don’t know. But Radell Cain apparently thinks so. His people kept questioningyour mother about it, didn’t they? They asked me about it. I’m sure they musthave asked you, too.”“They did,” Alex admitted. “In fact it was the only thing they wanted me to talkabout.”“Your mother gave me the answer I’ve been looking for, the answer to why they’recoming here and what they want. Radell Cain wants the gateway.”Realization dawned on him. “The land I’m inheriting. The gateway must besomewhere on the land that was left to me.”Jax was nodding. “You were right from the beginning. All along it’s been aboutthe land.”“But why would they need my mother? Or me? If they suspect the gateway islocated there on that land, then why not simply go there? The place is primitiveand remote. They could have the gateway to themselves and no one would likelyeven know that they were there or what they were up to.”“Maybe they already went there and found it, but they couldn’t use it for somereason. Maybe that was when they became interested in the Rahl line here in thisworld.”Alex hadn’t thought of that. He paced to the window and back as he thought aboutit. He wondered what part the Daggett Trust played in the whole thing.“If they did go there and couldn’t make the gateway work, what makes them thinkthat I could?”“A Rahl separated the worlds. If in so doing he also created this gatewaybetween worlds, and it still exists, then maybe it has fail-safes and it takes aRahl to open it again.”“But that was him, not me. Even if I am a descendant of this Rahl line from yourworld, I don’t have those kinds of abilities. How the hell am I supposed to opena gateway between worlds? I never even knew another world existed. I’m the lastperson on earth to go to for answers about a gateway.”“Not really,” Jax said as she shrugged. “The Law of Nines names you as centralto it all. You would be the very person to go to.”“The Law of Nines? How can that have anything to do with a gateway?”“I don’t know, but Radell Cain wants the gateway, and the Law of Nines leads himdirectly to you as being central to the whole thing. He sent Sedrick Vendishere, his most trusted man, to secure both the gateway and you.”Alex paced as he thought. “But like you just said, they’re coming to this world.They can already come here and go back. What more is the gateway going to do forthem that they can’t already do?”Alex paused in midstride as the answer to his own question suddenly becameclear. “Except that when they come here they can’t take anything back withthem.” He met her gaze. “Could they take things back through a gateway?”She was smiling in an unsettling way. “According to the theory, a lifeline isn’tneeded in the gateway, so objects could be taken back through it.”“What would they want to take back through the gateway?”“What’s the weapon they’re using to conquer and control people in my world?”“The ability your world has but this one doesn’t, weapons of magic.”“Right. And what is it Cain wants to eliminate from our world?”“Magic.”“So, what happens if they succeed?”Alex felt the hair on his arms stand on end. “Dictators always seek to takeweapons away from people so that there can be no effective opposition to theirrule. If they eliminate magic, they will eliminate the weapon that people coulduse to resist tyranny.“But in taking it away from the people who might oppose them, they will also beeliminating it for their own use. So, if they eliminate the weapon everyone onboth sides is using now, they will need some other kind of weapon to replaceit.”“That’s right,” she said. “There is a kind of balance of power now. Both sideshave access to the same kinds of weapons. If they eliminate magic, that wouldleave the balance of power static—neither side would have it. So, if they wantto seize rule they will need to replace their lost weapons with some other kindof weapon. That would tip the balance their way.”“Technology,” Alex whispered. “They could use radios to communicate, drugs tocontrol people, and guns to kill anyone who tries to resist them.”Jax was nodding again. “And who knows what else. For all practical purposes,technology is interchangeable with what we can do with our abilities—they do thesame kinds of things. When the tools created with the use of magic are suddenlygone, people will be helpless.”“Those with technology to replace those lost tools will be able to rule theworld.”“Exactly.” Jax swept an arm out. “There is a whole world of technology here forthe taking. Last night you went out and bought that magic glue—”“Superglue.”“Right, superglue. We use magic to heal in a similar way, knitting wounds closedmuch like you did. But if our ability to do that is gone, we will have no way toheal the wounded. Imagine the advantage Cain’s side would have with somethingthat simple. How many people would give in to his side just to be healed withthe technology only Cain could provide?“But there is a great deal more. There is a whole world here full of things wewouldn’t have. They could walk into a store and buy things that would beinvaluable in my world, if everyone in my world were stripped of theirabilities. They could take that technology back through a gateway. Cain would bethe sole source of the things that people needed to live, and only he would haveweapons to enforce his rule.”“But do you think this Gateway Theory is really right? That people could takethings back through it to your world?”“I imagine that Radell Cain must have reason to believe so.”Alex sat down on the edge of the bed. “What is it I’ve heard you say . . . ?‘Dear spirits’?”“Yes, if things are bad enough.”Alex rested his elbows on his knees and put his head in his hands. “Dearspirits, they want a gateway to run guns to another world.”“Any ideas?”“Sure, let’s call in ATF.”“Who?”“Nothing,” he said, waving off his flip remark. “That still doesn’t reallyexplain my part in this. I’ve never even heard of a gateway. What would I know?What do they think I can do?”“You’re a Rahl—a Rahl specifically identified by the Law of Nines. It was a Rahlwho created the gateway. I think that if they could simply find the gateway anduse it they would have done so ages ago. Since they haven’t, that means theycan’t. For some reason they need you.”“Do you honestly think that they intend for me to open this gateway for them? Doyou really think they believe I can?”Jax let out a long sigh. “I don’t know, Alex. Do you have any betterexplanation?”“I guess not,” he said.“So what now?”He went to the desk and retrieved one of the phones he’d bought the nightbefore. “I think I had better call Mr. Fenton, the lawyer for the land. I thinkwe need to get ourselves to Boston, take title to the land, and then go up toMaine and have a look for ourselves.”“I agree. It’s our only lead now.”"},{"pageContent":"45.ALEX DIALED THE NUMBER . “I’ll put it on speaker so you can hear,” he told Jax.“Lancaster, Buckman, Fenton. This is Mr. Fenton.”“Mr. Fenton, hi. It’s Alexander Rahl.”“Mr. Rahl, I’m so relieved to hear from you.” The man sounded like he meant it.“I was beginning to worry. Is everything all right? I mean, it’s been over aweek since you had said that you were going to call. I was beginning to getconcerned.”Alex hadn’t realized that he’d lost track of that much time drugged up in Motherof Roses. “I apologize. I was distracted by some things for a few days, but I’mfree now.”“That’s good to hear. Say, I’ve been seeing on the news about the big fire youhad out your way, at Mother of Roses. Do you know anything about it?”Alex wasn’t sure what he should say, so he decided to be vague. “Some. Why?”“Well, the thing is, one of my associates, Mr. Buckman, took ill earlier thisyear. His doctor thought that he was possibly suffering a breakdown of somesort, and as a result had fallen into a rather severe psychosis. They couldn’tseem to get to the bottom of it, so Mr. Buckman was sent out your way to Motherof Roses Psychiatric Hospital for extended care. I guess they specialize in thatsort of thing. It’s a private care facility where he has been receivingspecialized evaluation and treatment.”Alex’s mouth went dry. “Treatment? From who? Do you know his doctor’s name?”“The specialist in charge is Dr. Hoffmann. I was just wondering if you knewanything more about the fire. You know how unreliable the news can be. I haven’tbeen able to find out anything about Mr. Buckman. I don’t know if he’s all rightor not. The news reports said that a number of patients died in the fire, mostof them on the ninth floor. That’s where Mr. Buckman was confined.”Alex shared a look with Jax. “I’m terribly sorry. My mother died in the fire atMother of Roses. She was on the ninth floor.”“Dear God.” He was silent for a moment. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize. Youhave my deepest sympathy, Mr. Rahl.”“Thank you.”“I remember very well your mother not being able to take title to the landbecause she fell ill, but I had no idea that she was at Mother of Roses. What astrange coincidence that Mr. Buckman was at the same institution, and on thesame floor.”“Yes, that is quite the coincidence.”Alex didn’t generally believe in coincidences. His mind raced as he tried to fitthe pieces together.“Have you tried contacting the authorities here in Nebraska to find out if Mr.Buckman might have been one of the people who escaped the blaze? I’ve heard thatit was quite a chaotic scene but most of the patients did manage to escape.”“I heard the same encouraging news. I’ve tried to get more information, butthere seems to be quite a lot of confusion right now. Being a lawyer, I was ableto get ahold of the state hospital authority, but no one can even find a patientregister.”“Are there other records?” Alex asked.“I was told that the records at the hospital were destroyed in the fire. Therewere supposed to be backups of all the patient files kept off-site but there wasapparently some kind of problem with the backup—they said it might have been acomputer virus or something. No one knew about it until they went to retrievethe information and discovered that it was corrupted beyond recovery. So, theauthorities there are in the dark even about how many people might have beenunder care at the facility. That makes it even more difficult to determine howmany may have died.“—Oh, I’m sorry. Here I am going on about Mr. Buckman and side issues when youlost your mother there. You probably need to get back to making arrangements.”“No, it’s all right. There aren’t really any arrangements to be made. I don’thave any living relatives. My grandfather died a short while back. Beingconfined in a mental hospital all these years, my mother didn’t have any friendsor really even know anyone. There’s actually nothing to be done. I will have towait for any remains to be found—if they ever are. The fire was pretty intense.For now, there’s really nothing I can do.”“I see. Are you headed here, then?”Alex thought that he detected an odd tension in the question. “Yes. I will needto look into what flights are available. I’ll try to get the earliest flight wecan going to Boston.”“We? You have someone with you?”“My fiancée.”Another pause. “That’s wonderful. Congratulations.”“Thank you. You’ll get to meet her. She’s a wonderful person. She has beenhelping me get through the loss of my mother. Her name is Jax. She’s here withme now. I have you on speaker if you would like to say hello.”Jax leaned in at Alex’s urging. “Hello, Mr. Fenton.”“How do you do? I’m so sorry to hear of your unexpected trouble.”“Thank you. We’re doing the best we can.”“I look forward to meeting you soon, then.”“We can’t get there fast enough,” Jax said.“I’ll let you know as soon as I have a flight number,” Alex put in.There was a long pause. “Mr. Rahl, I suggest that you not fly.”Alex’s antennae went up. “Why is that?”Again a pause. “Mr. Rahl, may I be honest with you?”“I wish you would.”“I fear that certain people may be watching the airlines, trying to find you.”Alex’s blood went cold. “Certain people?”“It’s possible that you could be in danger from these people. They might beexpecting you to head here. They may be watching airports and bus stations—anykind of place you would go to take public transportation. I don’t mean to alarmyou, Mr. Rahl, but I believe that these people could possibly be dangerous.”“I think I know what you mean.”Another pause, longer this time, as if the man was considering what to say, ormaybe how much to say. “Have you been approached, or . . . threatened byanyone?”“I think we’re talking about the same people. I’ve run into them already.”“Are you all right?” he asked in a rush. There was genuine concern, even alarm,in his voice.“Yes. Right now I think it best if I get there as soon as possible. I have youraddress—”“No.”“No?”“Well, the thing is . . .” There was another pause before the man went on. “Ifear that these same people might be watching my offices. I don’t really haveany way to tell. I’m sorry—I don’t mean to alarm you unduly. It’s possible thatI’m simply being paranoid.”Alex took a deep breath. “Mr. Fenton, this is too important for us to keep upthis pretense. You were honest with me, I’m going to be honest with you. Youneed to listen to me and listen carefully. These people are killers.”Alex didn’t know if the man would scoff, or hang up.“I’m listening, Mr. Rahl.”Alex thought that it was a good sign that the lawyer didn’t try to minimize thedanger. In fact, the man sounded concerned, even frightened.“First of all, I’m Alex.”Alex could imagine the man smiling with relief. “My first name is Myron, but ifyou call me by that name I’ll sue you for pain and suffering. Everyone calls meMike.”Alex smiled. “I have enough on my plate without a lawsuit. Mike it is. I know itmay sound far-fetched, but you need to trust me about all of this. I know whatI’m talking about. I need you to do exactly as I tell you. First thing, doesthis number show up on your phone?”“Yes. I’ll have it in the caller ID memory.”“No, you won’t.”“But my phone—”“I don’t want you using any phone you have now. These people can somehow trackyou with your phone. From now on I don’t want you to touch any phone youpresently have. Don’t use your cell phone. Don’t even take it with you. Do youunderstand?”“Yes.”Alex thought that it was promising that Mr. Fenton wasn’t freaking out orrecommending that he see a shrink, and even more significantly, he wasn’targuing. “Memorize this number. Don’t say it out loud. Don’t write it down.Memorize it.”“Done.”“Good. It’s possible that the phone I’m talking on is now compromised becauseI’ve called your regular phone. I’ll have to throw this phone away after I hangup. I have another. Add one hundred forty-three to this number and you will havethe number of the new phone. After you leave your office, buy a disposable cellphone and call me back on my new number.”“All right.”“Are you married? Do you have family?”“No. Not close family, anyway. I have . . . good friends that I will need totalk to.”“All right, but don’t take any phone that you have now with you. Best to getseveral cell phones. Use one of those others to call your friends. Make up someexcuse—tell them that you will be away on business or something for a while.After you talk to them, throw that phone away; it could become compromised bycalling them and then the people you’re worried about could use that new phoneto track you.”“All right. What else?”“We’ll need a place to meet. Don’t say it now. Wait until we talk later. I knowthat these people have the ability to track people through phones, but I don’tknow if they can listen in on conversations. I don’t want to find out the hardway that they can. I’d rather be too cautious than spend eternity in my gravewishing I’d been more careful.”“I understand. I will pick up some phones and call you then.”“When you leave your office, go home and pack a bag. You need to stay away fromany place you are known to frequent. Don’t go stay with a friend. Don’t stay atyour office or at a club if you’re a member of one. You need to go somewherethat you don’t frequent, a place you’ve never been. Make sure you aren’tfollowed. Once there, don’t go back to a known location or these people could bespooked enough to pick you up right then and there.”“I understand.” There was a pause. “Alex, are you sure that such extrememeasures are necessary? I mean the staying away from any known locations andall?”“The fire at Mother of Roses was set deliberately. They murdered my mother and Iwould bet that they murdered Mr. Buckman as well. They killed a number ofinnocent people just so that they could destroy any records of what they were upto.”“Dear God. You really think so?”“I don’t think so, I know so. I was there. I saw Dr. Hoffmann set the fire tocover their tracks.”Alex waited for a moment, trying to guess at the silence.“I must tell you, Alex, you have just confirmed my worst fears. We’ve beentrying to gauge if the danger is real. You have just answered a lot of ourquestions for us.”“Who is this ‘us’? Who are you talking about?”“I think you’re right,” Mike said. “It would be best if we talk later.”“You’re right. That makes sense.”“I’m going to be leaving my office immediately. I will take all the titledocuments with me. I will have everything we need to transfer the land into yourname. I realize that it may seem like a silly formality in the middle of all ofthis other business, but I assure you, it is vital that it be done.”“I’d like it taken care of myself. I want that land in my name.”“Good. I’m glad. I think it best if I not go home, though. I think the risk hasnow become too great. I’ll buy whatever I need. I will pick up some phones, asyou suggest, and call you.”“Good. Please be careful.”“I will. Thanks, Alex, for leveling with me.”“Jax always says that it’s best to tell the truth.”He chuckled. “I’ll call you later today. I’ll also make arrangements so we canmeet and take care of everything.”“Mirrors,” Jax said.“Oh yes. I know this sounds crazy, but you need to stay away from mirrors. Ifyou stay someplace with a mirror, cover it immediately.”“I haven’t had any mirrors in my office or house for years.”Alex and Jax again shared a look.“In fact, it’s been so long since I’ve been near a mirror that I’m not even surewhat I look like anymore.”“Do you have a rearview mirror in your car?”“Yes, of course.”“That’s a mirror. You need to break the rearview mirror off the windshield andbreak out or remove the outside mirrors. If you break the glass out, makecertain that every speck of mirror is gone.”“Is that really necessary?”“I found out the hard way that it is. You may not be as lucky as we were. Takethe mirrors out of your car.”“I’ve always been so careful with mirrors, and all this time I never thoughtabout the rearview mirrors in my car. This explains some things. I’m glad you’reso thorough. I will remove them before I start the car.”“I think we’re going to have a lot to talk about when we get together.”“More than you know, Mr. Rahl.”“Alex.”“Right. I will call you later, Alex. And I especially look forward to meetingyou, Jax.”“Stay safe,” she said. “And be careful.”“I understand. Good-bye.”“Good-bye,” Alex and Jax said together.He closed the cover and then dropped the phone in a plastic cup full of water.“Well, what do you make of that?” he asked as he slipped the other new phone,the one he hadn’t used yet, into the pocket of his jeans.“It’s obvious he knows something.”“I wonder how,” Alex said. “I guess that the sooner we get there the soonerwe’ll find out. We’d better get going.”“How are we going to get there?”“I don’t see that we have any choice. We’ll have to drive. If we flew we couldbe in Boston in a day. But by the time we can get on a flight it’s liable to betwo days, maybe even longer on such short notice. Driving will take close tothree days, but if we drive, Cain’s people won’t know where we are or when we’llshow up. I want to keep them in the dark as much as possible.”“Me, too.”“Just as well, anyway,” he said as he put his jacket on to cover his gun. “Iwasn’t comfortable with the idea of giving up our weapons in order to fly.Airports have metal detectors, like at Mother of Roses. They won’t let you takea weapon of any kind onto a plane—not even a small pocketknife.“We’d have to pack our weapons in the luggage. If anything happened they wouldbe useless to us locked away in the baggage compartment, the same as they wereuseless to us when they were locked away in the truck. Besides, the luggagecould be lost, or stolen, especially if Cain’s people are watching, trying tocatch us flying. They would probably snatch our bags to make sure we wereunarmed.”Jax pulled the silver-handled knife from behind her back. She twirled the bladethrough her fingers and caught it by the tip. She held it up, the handle beforehim. It was then that he noticed, for the first time, that the ornate scrollworkformed the letter R.“There is no way I’m giving up this knife just so that they will let me go up inthe sky.”Alex’s gaze moved from the knife to her eyes. “Why is there an R on the handle?”“It stands for the House of Rahl. It’s an ancient weapon, an exceedingly rareweapon, a weapon carried by only a very few people now.”“Why do you have it?”“For the same reason I volunteered to come to this world. Because I believe youare the one to stop this madness. Because I believe in you, Alexander Rahl.“This is the knife I was sharpening when I made the test cuts on that tree inthe painting you made. You painted those test cuts in your painting, those testcuts made with this knife as I was sharpening it in preparation for coming here.You are connected to this blade in more ways than one, just as you are connectedto everything else.”“Are you positive, Jax?”She smiled. “I’m as positive of it as you are, and you’re dead certain of it.”Alex smiled back. “It’s scary how well you know me.”He pulled the phone out of the glass of water, then opened it and broke it inhalf. He handed the broken pieces to Jax. “Here. There’s a dumpster across thelot. I’ll put our things in the truck. You throw this away.”“Gladly.”"},{"pageContent":"46.THEY HAD JUST FINISHED filling the Jeep with gas and grabbing a quick bite toeat at the Amana Colonies along Interstate 80 in Iowa when Alex’s phone rang. Hedidn’t have to guess who it could be.“Hi, Mike,” he said, looking back over his left shoulder at the traffic comingup behind him as he merged onto Interstate 80.“You still all right, Alex?”“Fine. We’re on the road, headed your way. I have you on speaker.”“I’ve followed all of your instructions to the letter.”“And you didn’t use the phone you’re on now to call anyone?”“No. This is the only call I’ve made with it since I unwrapped it.”Alex was relieved that the man was taking everything so seriously. He did wonderwhy, though—what kind of encounters he could have had that would make him goalong so willingly.“Good. Thanks.”The other thing that concerned Alex was that it seemed certain that Cain had toknow about the land. Why else would they have taken Walter Buckman to the ninthfloor of Mother of Roses, where he would be under the thumb of Dr. Hoffmann? Oneway or another they would have gotten all the information out of Mike Fenton’spartner—and God only knew who else.If Cain’s people were watching airports and bus stations to see if they couldcatch Alex and Jax, then they surely would also be waiting and watching the landup in Maine. After all, they had to know right where it was. They had to knowthat sooner or later Alex would end up there. Everything was funneling themright to that one place.Of course, if Cain’s men could snatch them in an airport, he and Jax would beunarmed, which would make it a lot easier for them. That was probably what theywere hoping. They wanted to capture Alex, but they surely would kill Jax onsight.At least if they ran into Cain’s people up in Maine, he and Jax would be armedand expecting trouble.“I’m not sure how long it will take us to get there,” Alex said when Mike asked.“I think it must be about thirteen hundred miles to Boston. We got a late starttoday, so I imagine we’ll be there by day after tomorrow—late in the day.”“Since I suspect that my office was being watched, I feel uncomfortable havingyou come to Boston for us to meet. I think it would be best if we met closer towhere the land is located, and to where some of the others are.”“You have a place in mind?”“Yes. I’ve made reservations, if it’s all right with you and Jax. If not, I canchange the location. It’s farther up beyond Boston, but it’s on the way to whereyou’re headed, so it would be convenient and it wouldn’t lose you any time.”“Well, I guess we are most interested in getting to the land.”“That’s what I thought.”“So, where do you want us to meet you?”“In Bangor, Maine. I’m at a motel just outside Boston right now. I’m going to beheading up to Bangor in a day or two, after I finish taking care of some legaldetails. I already made reservations for you as well in the name of Hank Croft.”“How’d you pick the name?”“Stuck my finger in a phone book. It seemed like an easy name to remember. I’llbe staying at the same place.”“Hank Croft. Got it. But when you check into a motel they usually want to see adriver’s license or some kind of ID.”“That’s one of the reasons I’m still in Boston. I’ve been taking care of that.You would be surprised how easy it is to get those kinds of documents. It’seasier than going to the DMV. As long as I was at it, I picked up an ID for Mrs.Jenna Croft—they gave me a quantity discount. It will all be on your bill. I hadthe IDs say you were married. I figured that, just in case, it would make iteasier.”“Jenna Croft. That’s good thinking,” Jax said, leaning toward the phone inAlex’s hand. “You mentioned ‘where some of the others are.’ Who are these otherpeople?”“They’re from the Daggett Trust. They need to sign off on the transfer of titleto the land into Alex’s name.”“And do they know you’re coming?” Jax asked. “Know that we’re coming? And wherewe’re all to meet?”“Yes.”Alex gripped the steering wheel in his fists and gritted his teeth, but tried tokeep his voice calm. “Mike, they could be followed. They could do any one of anumber of things that could compromise us.”“I told them your instructions. They will follow everything you told me, doeverything the same as I’m doing.”“How can you be sure that they will take all of it seriously enough?” Jax asked.Alex could hear a thread of anxiety and anger in her voice.“These are very cautious people. They’re the ones who originally told me aboutmirrors.”Alex shared a look with Jax.“You told them about the rearview mirrors in their cars as well?” Alex asked.“I did. They were quite embarrassed that they hadn’t thought of that long beforenow. They were mortified, in fact. They’re in the process of retracing theirtracks over the last few years to try to identify anything that could have beenput at risk because they hadn’t considered the mirrors in their cars.”“Who the hell are these people?” Alex whispered to Jax.She frowned and shook her head as if to say she couldn’t imagine and shared hisconcern.“I have to tell you, Mike, it worries me that there are other people involved,other people who know our plans. It creates opportunities for trouble to findus.”“Alex, I trust these people with my life.”“Good for you, but I don’t know if I’m willing to trust them with mine, orJax’s.”“I can understand your concern, but I assure you, these people can be trusted.”“Maybe so, but why can’t you take them the papers after I sign them? Why do youhave to bring them in on this meeting?”“Because these people are the board of directors of the Daggett Trust. TheDaggett Trust has a large stake in this. The directors have to be there in orderto make this happen. While the technicality is written in convoluted legalterms, what it boils down to is that they have to, in essence, approve of thetitle to the land going to you.”“What do you mean, they have to approve it? I thought that if I meet theconditions of the inheritance, which I do, then the land goes to me.”“Yes, that’s right. But their approval is one of those conditions, as is paymentof the legal fees. You do recall me telling you about the fees, don’t you?”Alex thought it an odd thing to bring up. “Yes. How much?”“I don’t have the final figures on the expenses, yet, but it will be a littleunder ten thousand dollars.”Alex thought the legal fees were pretty hefty, but he didn’t say so. He didn’tknow how much work was involved or how much lawyers were supposed to cost insuch matters. Throwing in the danger element, he supposed that it didn’t soundso out of line.“What if they don’t approve for some reason?”“Alex, believe me, these people are looking forward to you having the land inyour name.”“Why?”“Because the inheritance of this particular piece of land has cast its shadowover a number of people for centuries before it finally settled on you. Theyknow that the land is meant to go to you.”“How would they know that I’m the one who is supposed to have it?”There was a long pause before the man answered.“Because of the Law of Nines.”Alex almost dropped the phone. Jax’s face lost a little color.The tires droned on against the pavement and made a rhythmic thump at everyexpansion joint in the road. Alex couldn’t figure out how the Daggett Trust fitinto it all, or how these people would know anything about mirrors, much lessthe Law of Nines.“Well?” he whispered to Jax.She shrugged as she shook her head, as if to say that it made no sense to her,either.“Alex, are you there?”Alex cleared his throat. “Where is it you want to meet Hank and Jenna Croft?”“At the Downeaster Motel in Bangor. The fastest route that will take you in thedirection of the land trust is Interstate 95 up through the state. I thought itbest to make the stop along that route, in Bangor. I figured that Bangor is abig enough place that it won’t be easy for them to watch as it would be asmaller town closer to the land.”“That makes sense.”“The Downeaster Motel is just off of Interstate 95 on Hammond Street, rightthere in Bangor. I’ll give you exact directions and the address when you getcloser, but it’s not hard to find, just a right turn off I-95 north and go up ashort distance.”“All right. Don’t use the phone you’re using right now to call anyone else. Useit exclusively to call us. I see the number on the caller ID. I’ll call youalong the way to let you know how we’re doing. If anyone but me calls you onthat phone, destroy it and buy a new one and then call me immediately.”“How long do you think it will take?”“I don’t know. It’s starting to get dark here now. Probably close to anotherthree days. I want to be careful and not draw attention to us. I also don’t wantto show up exhausted and half asleep, either. Not being alert can get you in aworld of hurt with these people. I’ll be able to give you a better arrival timeas we get closer.”“Call anytime, day or night. I will have this phone on me all the time.”“Same here. If anything smells fishy, I want to know about it.”“You’ve got it. I can assure you that we’re all being extremely careful.”“What about the other people in your office? Does anyone else know about theland or me?”“I am the office.”“What do you mean?”“There was only me and Walter Buckman. Mr. Lancaster died a number of years backin a car accident.”That’s what had happened to Alex’s father, but he didn’t say so.“You and Mr. Buckman handled everything with all your clients by yourselves? Nosecretaries? No assistants?”“No, none. We only have one client: the Daggett Trust.”Alex lifted an eyebrow to Jax.“You need to consider everything that Walter Buckman knew and assume that theynow know it all,” Jax said. “These people are perfectly willing to use any meansnecessary to get answers. Assume that if he liked salt on his eggs, they knowhow much.”“We have already made that same assumption. We’ve taken efforts to close off anyavenues his knowledge would have opened for them.”“Let’s just hope that it’s not too late,” she said.“All I can tell you is that we’ve done everything we can think of to minimizethe risk. As you’ve said, these people are dangerous. We can’t entirelyeliminate every single threat, but we’ve done what we can. Unless you have anyother ideas?”“No,” Jax said. “We know quite well how dangerous these people are, but we don’tknow how many people they have, what they’ve been up to, or the specifics ofwhat their plans are.”“Other than knowing that these people are dangerous, we’re largely in the darkas to what’s going on,” Alex added, not completely, one hundred percentconvinced that the man was not somehow connected with Radell Cain and trying tosuck them into a trap. If Mike Fenton was on Cain’s side, Alex didn’t want togive the man the idea that Jax and he could provide answers he didn’t have. “Youprobably know more than we do. We’re hoping that when we meet, you can fill usin on just what this is all about.”“Let’s stay in touch,” Mike said. “Keep me updated as you get closer.”“I will. Good-bye for now,” Alex said.“Good-bye.”Alex flipped the phone closed. He glanced over at Jax. “What do you think?”“I don’t know.” Jax shook her head. “The Law of Nines is something from myworld. It has to do with how things work in my world. I don’t see how anyonehere could know about it.”“It’s involved in my world now, too,” he reminded her. “So you think it’sanother ambush?”Her mouth twisted in thought as she considered for a moment. “I don’t know, butthe man seems to ring true to me.”“He could be conning us. I never suspected Dr. Hoffmann of working for Cain, orthose nurses and orderlies being from your world.”“The only thing I know for sure is that Cain would like nothing more than tocapture you,” she said. “We can’t allow that.”“What do you say we hope Mike Fenton and the others are on our side, but beprepared for them being on Cain’s.”“That’s all we can do.”"},{"pageContent":"47.LOOK, THERE,” JAX SAID, POINTING. “Hammond Street, two miles.” Alex glanced overat the green sign in the mist as they sailed past it on their way north. It waslate in the afternoon. Traffic was getting heavier as rush hour approached.He looked over his shoulder to make sure the road was clear as he pulled intothe right lane. He had just gone by a woman in a small car who looked to beterrified by the weather conditions. It was annoying not having a rearviewmirror, but to get over his annoyance Alex had only to recall the desperatefight when a man from Jax’s world had appeared in the back seat of the Cherokee.Alex saw that the woman he’d just passed had a death grip on the wheel. Her eyesstared unblinking straight ahead as she single-handedly created a traffic snarl,so afraid of danger that she had become danger itself.Jax pointed. “Hammond Street, one mile.”Over the long drive, Jax had developed into a good navigator. It had only takenher a short time to overcome her uneasiness at traveling at highway speeds. Shewas now an old pro.She was good at reading maps and had good eyesight, so she was adept at pickingout signs in the distance for different highways they had needed to take ontheir way east and then north. She also kept a lookout for any cars—or pirateplumbing trucks—that might be following them. Several times they had taken exitsand detours to be certain that cars that stayed on their tail were not reallyfollowing them.Jax had been amazed at the size of some of the cities they had gone through andcouldn’t get enough of the sights and changing scenery as they crossed thecountry. She was a tourist in a strange land. Her childlike wonder never failedto make Alex smile.They had stopped at night only long enough to get the sleep they needed to keepgoing. Alex knew that they both were still working the drugs out of theirsystems. Jax especially still needed rest to recover from her ordeal. Given thenature of the people after them, they knew that they had to stay alert. It wasalso fatiguing to constantly remain on the lookout for anything that might besuspicious.Alex had been able to persuade her to cover herself up with a blanket in theback seat and get some sleep along the way. He could tell how much she stillhurt because he didn’t have too difficult a time convincing her to rest. Shehated missing all the sights, and she didn’t like leaving him to be the lonelookout, but she needed the rest and she knew it.As they drove up through the seemingly endless woods of Maine, she looked tofinally be a lot better. She had stared longingly out the window at the passingforests. He knew that they reminded her of home.Alex turned on the windshield wipers as he took the Hammond Street exit. Fromhis brief look, the city of Bangor seemed old and tired. Some of the houses didlook grand, but in a bygone-era sort of a way. It looked like a peaceful,low-key place to live, a place where people made do with what they had, and nota whole lot ever changed, except with the slow rot of time.He followed Mike Fenton’s directions and in short order they saw the red glow ofthe sign for the Downeaster Motel. There were a lot of cars in the front parkinglot. The portico in front stood at the head of two parallel sections of roomsrunning back from there in a U shape.As he drove slowly through the lot, he scanned the cars for license plates fromMassachusetts. He saw a number of them here and there. Maine being a touristdestination, there were plates from all over. Some of the cars were packed fullwith belongings pressed against rear windows. Some of the trucks had kayaks orbicycles attached to their roofs.Alex drove around to the far wing of the two-story building that extended backto end at a small area of residential woods. A lot of cars were parked for roomsup closer to the office, but farther down the side was mostly deserted exceptway at the end, where there was a cluster of cars. By the room numbers on thedoors he knew that was the place he was looking for.When he reached the end he made a U-turn and parked on the slight slope at theback of the broad lot so that if he had to he could get the Cherokee rollingdownhill to start it. So far, on their trip east, it had behaved itself, failingto start with the key only once. He supposed that if someone had been chasingthem it would have failed to start more often.Parking as he had also put the driver’s side closest to the room.“You ready?” Alex asked as he watched for any activity.Jax carefully scanned the whole area, appearing to take note of every detail.“This makes me nervous.”“I can’t say that I disagree.”Jax took his hand and squeezed it, offering reassurance. They’d made it throughtough situations before.Alex hooked a magazine pouch on his belt on his left hip. It held twoseventeen-round magazines. He double-checked to make sure the magazines wereplaced in the pouch with the bullets facing forward so that if he got in a gunbattle and had to draw them to reload, he could use the index finger of his lefthand to feel the tip of the hollow-point round at the top of the magazine tohelp guide it into the gun in his right hand for fast, blind reloading. Helifted the Glock from its holster and held it in his lap, his index finger lyingalong the slide.Alex opened the phone and hit Redial with his left thumb. Mike Fenton answered.“This is Alex. We’re outside.”Alex watched and saw the drapes open a crack as the man peered out.“I see your truck. We’re so glad you’re here, and that you’re early. Come on in.Everyone is dying to meet you.”“How many of you are there?”“Including me, nine.”“I want all of you to come out of the room. Leave the door wide open. I wanteveryone to move away from the door, toward the woods at the back. Stay in plainsight. Jax is going to go in and check the room.”“Alex, I can understand that you would be a little nervous, but we—”“If any one of you does anything threatening, I won’t hesitate to shoot them.”Mike went silent.“Do you understand?” Alex asked.“I do,” Mike said. “I don’t blame you for being cautious. You’re right. We’rehappy to do as you ask.”“Thank you.”Alex closed the phone.“If you hear any gunshots, hit the ground,” Alex told Jax. “Understand?”“Yes. I think they’re sincere.”“I hope so, but I’m not going to take any chances. You be careful in there, willyou? If you have any problem I’ll be there in a flash.”Jax nodded. “Just don’t miss if this turns out to be an ambush. There’s two ofus and nine of them.”Alex offered her a smile. “It’s their tough luck to be at such a terribledisadvantage.”She squeezed his hand as she returned the smile.Alex watched as the people started filing out of the room. They strolledcasually, talking among themselves so that it wouldn’t look suspicious to seethat many people standing around in the parking lot. There were seven men andtwo women. They were all dressed casually, similar to but perhaps just a littlebetter than most any tourist traveling up to Maine for a vacation.“The trees smell so good,” Jax said to herself.“What?”“Nothing. Just thinking of home. The balsam trees remind me of home.”As Alex watched the group amble off into the lot closer to the trees and out ofthe way of the open door, he squeezed Jax’s hand again. “Be careful.”She winked at him. “You too.”He watched her walking across the lot, mesmerized by the graceful shape of her,by her fall of long blond hair, by how beautiful, how precious she was. Therewas no other woman in the world like her.How he wished she was from his world.He knew that if they ever accomplished what they needed to accomplish,accomplished what she had come to his world to do, and they found the gatewayand somehow were able to make it work, she would have to go back to her ownworld.Along their long trip east, when she had told him what she knew about thegateway and how it could be used to take things back to her world without alifeline, he had asked if it was possible for him to go through the gateway,too.Jax had said that that was one thing she was certain of: no one from his worldcould ever go to hers. Lord Rahl, the man who had separated the worlds, who hadsent people to this world, had made certain that that could never happen.She could come here, but he could never go there.Alex didn’t know how he would be able to endure her leaving. Without her in hisworld—in his life—his world would be dead.The group of people all took in Jax without looking obvious about it as shewalked toward the room. She disappeared inside.None of the people looked concerned. Alex thought that was a good sign. He hatedto be so melodramatic about the whole thing, but he’d been fooled by Cain’speople before. He wasn’t going to take chances if he didn’t have to.After a few minutes, Jax reappeared in the doorway. She gave Alex the all-clear.He holstered his gun and hopped out of the truck, pulling his jacket down overthe weapon. Jax started ushering the people back into the room, then stood justoutside the door, waiting for him while she watched them like a sergeant atarms.As Alex joined her, she put an arm around his waist. “They don’t look like adangerous lot,” she whispered.“That’s what we’re hoping.”“But that doesn’t mean they aren’t.”“I know.”"},{"pageContent":"48.AS ALEX STEPPED INTO THE ROOM behind Jax, all eyes were on them. The two-roomsuite was larger than the typical motel room. The two beige couches forming an Lat the corner of the front showed discoloration from heavy use. A round tablewith half a dozen chairs sat at the back.None of the furniture was especially elegant, but it was comfortable-looking.There was a wet bar beside a TV in a tall cabinet opposite the couches. Throughdouble louvered doors that stood open to the right he could see the edge of abed in the other room.The nine people standing in a cluster in the center of the room were all grins.They looked like devout worshippers about to meet the Pope.“I’m Mike Fenton,” a rather thin man said as he stepped forward, thrusting outhis hand.He was shorter than Jax, balding, and wearing jeans that still had the foldmarks in them from coming right off the rack. His gray-and-blue-striped,long-sleeved shirt likewise looked to have been freshly unwrapped. He wasgrinning from ear to ear.Alex shook the man’s hand. “Alex. It’s nice to meet you face-to-face, at last.”Still gripping Alex’s hand, Mike swept his free arm around, indicating the restof the people in the room. “We’re all so relieved that you arrived safely. Andyou would have to be Jax.”“I am,” she said as she shook his hand. He held her hand respectfully, gazinginto her eyes as if welcoming an alien from another planet to his world. Alexsupposed that he was.Alex was so focused on evaluating everyone as Mike introduced them that he knewhe wouldn’t remember all their names. None of them looked like a pirate. Theywere all wearing new clothes that to a greater or lesser extent still borenew-clothes folds. They had apparently followed Alex’s instructions and had notgone to their homes or any place familiar.Mike gestured to the table in the back, where papers were neatly laid out. “Howabout if we get business out of the way first? Get the title to the land takencare of so that everything is finalized and legal?”“I’d like that,” Alex said.“Do you have the fee?”Alex pulled an envelope from an inside pocket of his jacket. He handed it toMike.“There’s ten thousand even.”“It came to ninety-six hundred and seventy-five dollars.”The man opened the envelope and counted back three one-hundred-dollar bills. Hethen fished around in his pocket and came up with a twenty and a five. He handedthem over as well.“There. Paid in full.”Alex folded the money and slipped it into a pocket. “If you don’t mind myasking, what’s going on with this money issue?”Everyone chuckled self-consciously.“Well, it’s rather hard to explain, and there are much more important things todeal with, but briefly it has to do with traditions involving this land and theway it has been deeded. The simplest way to explain it is ‘value for value.’Stipulations having to do with the title require conventions that can seem alittle odd at a time like this, but they have a serious purpose and must befollowed to the letter. Payment for services is one of those stipulations.”Alex was in a way only too happy to use the money that Sedrick Vendis had paidto buy his paintings just so that he could deface them. It seemed like ironicjustice to use that money to pay for the legal fees to get the land that Vendisand Cain so badly wanted.“But now that the fee is out of the way,” Mike said, “we can get on with it.”At the man’s urging, Alex sat before a stack of papers and folders. Jax stoodbehind him, her back to the wall. Mike sat beside Alex as all the othersgathered round to watch. It had the feeling of a grand ceremony.The lawyer opened the top folder. “All of these need to be signed where I’veindicated with little red stickers.”Alex eyed the inch-thick stack. “Shouldn’t I read all of these?”“You’re welcome to do so, and as a lawyer I must advise that you do, although Ican assure you that I’ve been over everything, personally, and it’s all inorder. I’d be happy to explain any of it you find difficult to understand.”Alex picked up the pen. He scanned the first and second pages that were stapledtogether. They had to do entirely with identifying the parties involved in therest of the paperwork. It took two pages to say that he was Alex Rahl and thatthe Daggett Trust was the Daggett Trust.Alex started signing his name.Mike Fenton lifted away each page after Alex had signed it. He scanned the nextpage, really only looking for anything that stood out as odd. Everything lookedlike what he imagined normal deed transfers would look like. With people wantingto run guns through a gateway to another world, the legal technicalities of theland where the gateway sat didn’t seem overwhelmingly important, but Alexscanned them anyway just in case.But then he started coming to pages having to do with the Daggett Trust. Thosepages had nine signatures on them—the nine trustees. Each page awaited Alex’ssignature.“What’s this?” Alex said, frowning at the trustee agreements.“In essence, it puts you in charge of the Daggett Trust, making you the leadtrustee to the land involved in the Daggett Trust—all of it.”Alex looked up. “What do you mean, all of it?”“Well,” Mike said, “the part you inherit, and all the rest of the landassociated with it—all the land controlled by the Daggett Trust. It all belongstogether. This puts you in charge of all of the land as a single entity.”Alex stared at him. “All of it.”“Yes, that’s right.”“And how much land is that?”“Altogether? Nearly sixty-five thousand acres.”Alex was still staring at the man. “And what do you mean that it puts me incharge of the land?”Mike Fenton folded his fingers together on the table. “Well, for all practicalpurposes, it all becomes yours once you take title to the key piece. You becomethe lead trustee. For all practical purposes, this makes you the Daggett Trust.You have to uphold all of the deed stipulations, of course, but it’s all yours.”“Deed stipulations. You mean like how I can’t build on the land?”“Well, actually, as lead trustee you can build a place for yourself on the land,seeing as how the property is your responsibility and you will be overseeing itall.”“And I can’t sell my portion except to the trust.”“Right.”“But you said that this, in essence, makes me the trust.”“That’s right.”“So, if I wanted to sell—but believe me, I don’t—where would the money comefrom?”“Well, let me show you . . .” Mike said as he started shuffling through the filefolders.One of the women, the older, boxy-shaped one, leaned in to help. When Alexlooked up at her she smiled.“I’m Mildred—the accountant for the Daggett Trust. I’m the one who takes care ofthis aspect of the trust. I’ll be at your disposal, of course, to help witheverything.”“You will find Mildred indispensable,” Mike said.Alex didn’t want to have to find an accountant indispensable. He simply wantedto keep Radell Cain from using the gateway to take technology to Jax’s world.Mildred quickly found the file and pulled it out, opening it before Alex.“Here it is,” he said. “This is the financial area of the trust. Over the entiretime that the trust has existed, its funds have been invested in only the moststable, safe areas. None of the trustees throughout the history of the DaggettTrust has ever taken any risks with it, so it’s grown quite slowly, butsteadily.”“So how much is in there?”She pointed to one of the lines of figures. “A little over sixty-three milliondollars.”Alex blinked. “Sixty-three million?”Mike nodded. “Yes, that sounds about right—not including theaccrued-five-year-interest account. Most of it is in numbered overseas accounts.You aren’t allowed to touch the principal, of course. That’s one of thestipulations. But as the lead trustee you are entitled to use any and all theinterest it earns. After expenses, of course.”Mike scratched his nose as he flipped through the papers. “Let’s see . . . lastyear, for example, after trust expenses, that was about nine hundred thousanddollars—but interest rates last year were at a record low. It’s usually higher.You are also entitled to any unused interest from the last five years—that’s theaccrued-interest account I mentioned—so altogether you actually could draw justa little over five million, if you wanted to.”Alex was still staring at the man. “You mean to say that I could take all thatinterest, nine hundred thousand dollars—and all the rest of five million if Iwanted—and spend it all on lobster dinners?”Everyone chuckled.“Yes, if you want,” Mike said. “Any money you don’t take out simply stays in theaccrued-interest account. Any you don’t draw down from that portion within thefive-year limit is rolled back into the trust account as it reaches thatfive-year maturity. It then becomes part of the principal. Once it flows backinto the main trust account after five years, you then aren’t allowed to touchit for personal use. Of course, it will earn additional interest, along with allthe rest, which you can draw out.”“If there is all this money for trust expenses, then why on earth would you beso concerned with me paying the legal fees?”“It’s more than simply a part of the bylaws of the trust. It’s part of thestipulations of the inheritance. It’s all part of making sure that the personthe lands goes to is the right kind of person, that they are responsible andtake obligations seriously.“You were not yet the owner of the land or the lead trustee. You had no legalright to the trust’s money. You had to pay for the services I provided having todo with the inheritance without resentment of the debt and without trying tododge the obligation. It’s just one little way that the trust verifiesintegrity. Now that you’ve paid the fee, though, you not only own the land butyou become lead trustee and have complete access to the interest from the trustaccounts, so I’m sure you can see why it’s vital to the safety of the trust thatit have someone responsible at the helm. Mildred can help you keep track of itall.”“What expenses? What expenses does the trust have?”Mike gestured around. “Well, besides our fees for the work we do on behalf ofthe trust, the largest expense is security.”One of the men stepped forward, extending his big, weathered hand. “HalHalverson, Mr. Rahl. I’m head of security for the property.”While he wasn’t especially big, he was the kind of man Alex would not want tohave to wrestle. Hal Halverson was perhaps in his late forties, but looked likehe only became stronger and tougher with every year he gained.“How many security people are there?”“We have twenty in all. Me, seventeen men, and two women officers. Because ofthe way the land was set up as a special conservation area, we have legal statusas game wardens and full law-enforcement powers. By law, we’re employed and paidby the trust alone. Our land is technically situated within parts of severalcounties, but the trust is an entity unto itself. The state and counties don’thave jurisdiction over us, so they can’t do things like reassign us to otherlaw-enforcement duties. As head of security I alone recruit and hire oursecurity force.”With a thumb, he lifted out the lapel of his brown sport jacket. “I usually weara uniform. The uniforms help to make people take us seriously so that we cankeep everyone off the land. We generally don’t wear our uniforms off the trustproperty, and, well, your orders meant that I had to pick up this to wear. Andif I may say so, I was especially pleased by your grasp of the importance ofsecurity.”“So you can carry weapons?”The man lifted out his jacket to reveal a large-frame Glock. “Like I said, wehave legal law-enforcement status. Only we in the trust can recruit ourofficers, but they still have to pass state law enforcement tests and extensivebackground checks.”“Which reminds me,” Mike said as he opened another folder. “Here is youridentification in the name of Hank and Jenna Croft, should you need it. Sign ithere, if you would, please. Jax, you too.”She leaned in beside Alex and signed her full name on the incomplete driver’slicense. One of the other men had her stand against a wall so he could take herpicture. He snapped Alex’s photo as well and then took the licenses to the barsink, where he began working with some small equipment. Alex assumed he wasplacing the photos onto the licenses.“Here is a State of Maine permit to carry concealed firearms,” Mike said,sliding it across to Alex. He looked up. “This one is in your real name. Weassumed that you would be armed and need a CCW for Maine. Just in case, we haveone for Jax as well. We’ll put the photo on them, too, after you both sign.”“You people are pretty thorough,” Alex said as he and Jax signed the licenses.When he was finished, Mike handed them to the man working at the bar sink withthe photos.“We’re very careful in how we look out for the trust,” one of the others said.Alex wondered why and where they had developed such care. At Mike Fenton’sdirection, Alex went back to signing papers. At a few places the man stopped andexplained details of the trust.It seemed to Alex that he was taking on a huge responsibility he didn’t reallywant. Originally, he had just wanted to take title to the land in order to havea place to paint in peace.Now, though, he needed to secure the gateway and prevent Radell Cain’s peoplefrom using it. He supposed that this was all necessary in order to do that. And,should he need them, it did give him a lot more authority and resources to helphim accomplish that task.When he finished looking over and signing the stack of papers, Alex leaned backin his chair and let out a sigh.“It’s done,” Mike said. “At long last. We can’t tell you what a relief this is.”“All right, as lead trustee, I’d like to know what this is all about. What’sgoing on? What’s really behind the Daggett Trust and the land? What’s theconnection?”"},{"pageContent":"49.SOME OF THE PEOPLE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY while others cleared their throats. Alexstood and pushed the chair in so that he could stand beside Jax and see all thesmiling faces. He didn’t join in the smiling over the title transfer beingconcluded. A lot of people had already died because of the land, people close tohim. He waited patiently for them to explain about the Daggett Trust.Picking up on Alex’s sobriety, Mike turned serious as he went on to explain.“Those of us here in this room, along with the security staff who are onproperty, are members of an ancient society. It’s a small and very secretorganization. We are the protectors of this land. Now, you are as well. Us bychoice, by passion, by belief, and by dedication. You, Mr. Rahl, by birth aswell as by choice.”Alex looked around at all the suddenly serious faces watching him. “You meanyou’re like high priests, or the last Knights Templar, or something?”“In a way, yes,” one of the other men said.Alex was a little surprised that they didn’t dismiss such a suggestion out ofhand. Since learning about Jax coming from another world and seeing some of thethings he’d seen, he was pretty well past being shocked, though. But he wasconcerned that the inheritance of a piece of land had ended up pulling him intothe middle of some kind of secret organization.Alex glanced around at the faces watching him. “So just what kind of secretancient society is this? What’s it for?”“It’s a long story, with a very long history to it, and at some point we willfill you in on all the details,” Hal Halverson said. “But for now I don’t likeall of us here in one place together. It’s not how we usually do things. Thereis no telling if some of the people who are causing trouble might somehow knowabout us all being here. For all we know, any one of us could have inadvertentlyled that trouble here. To protect the trust, we rarely get this many memberstogether all at once.”“Where are the others?” Alex asked.“The security people are all members,” Hal said, “and there are a few moremembers scattered around Europe. Other than the rest of the security people,though, this is most of us right here in this room.”“Hal is right,” Mike said. “We’ll give you the quick version and leave thedetails for later.”“This ought to be interesting,” Jax said under her breath as she folded herarms.“Ages ago—”“How long ago is that?” Alex interrupted.Mike waved off the question. “We’re not sure, exactly. Well over a thousandyears, we believe. Anyway, back then, ages ago, is when the Daggett Society wasformed. It was, from its inception, a highly secret organization. There’s not alot in the way of written records, other than the accounting and deeds. Most ofour history and such is passed down orally. The people who formed the DaggettSociety were risking their lives. Revealing its existence to anyone likely wouldhave meant death.”“What was so important about founding this secret society that they would risktheir lives?” Alex asked.“It was founded on the belief that at least some people in this world resettledhere from another place.”Alex looked around at all the faces. “You mean some space aliens flew peoplehere in flying saucers?” he asked, still not completely ready to let them knowthat he knew exactly what they were talking about.Alex didn’t like deceiving these people by playing dumb or by making it looklike he was deriding them. He thought they were on his side. They seemedsincerely interested in protecting him, and they seemed devoted to protectingthe land where the gateway was located.But too much was at risk to worry about hurting their feelings. His life, Jax’slife, and the lives of other people from both worlds were at stake. People hadalready lost their lives. People close to him had lost their lives. He wanted toknow exactly what these people knew before he was willing to let them in oneverything he knew.“Not exactly,” Mike said. “The book simply says—”“What book?” Jax asked as she straightened, her arms coming unfolded.One of the other men leaned in toward the two of them. He was the onlyAfrican-American in the group. He appeared to be in his early fifties and inrelatively good shape. He had a shaved head and wore small, thin-rimmed glasses.He had on khaki pants and a red plaid shirt, but he looked like he belonged in aherringbone suit.He extended a hand. “I’m Ralph Overton, I’m the one in charge of the book.”Alex shook his hand. “Like Jax asked, what book?”Ralph adjusted his glasses. “Back at the time the society was formed, a book wascompiled containing a variety of information, some of it sketchy. It isn’t anelaborate book like monks of the time would make. It’s more homemade, more crudethan that. It’s the only written record we have.“It appears to partly be a record of events, and partly an attempt to set downbroader information related to those events. The book has always been anunderlying element of the Daggett Society. According to the book, it seems thatat least some of the people in this world came from another place.”When Alex and Jax didn’t say anything this time, he went on.“The society was formed to be the keepers of this secret knowledge, to preserveit so that it wouldn’t be forever lost, wouldn’t be entirely forgotten, as thepeople who put the book together believed would happen to everyone who hadresettled here. Yet they had sound reason to believe that secrecy was necessaryto protect the safety of the people in that other world, those brothers andsisters who are still there in that home place.”“And how is this secret society supposed to protect the safety of these otherpeople?” Alex asked.“Well, you see,” Ralph went on, leaning in toward them both, “the book containsa prediction that a time will come when someone from this world will have tosave that other world. That is the central founding reason for the book, and thereason the society was formed. The members of the Daggett Society were meant tobe the keepers of this knowledge until that time came.”“The members of the society,” Mike said, “are the keepers of this knowledge andprediction so that when the time comes they can help that person. Those of us inthis room had for years all studied obscure historical clues spread acrosscenturies and different cultures. That passion eventually led us to others likeourselves in the Daggett Society. We are the keepers of this knowledge,believers in the purpose of the book and the founders of the society. We believethat there is this other world somewhere out there.”Alex frowned around at the faces watching him. “So this is like a religion, areligious belief ?”“No,” Ralph said, shaking his head emphatically. “Not a religious belief. We arenot worshippers of this other world. You might say that it is akin to aspiritual belief in this other home world, but it’s not a religion. For us, forall present and past members of this small society, it’s a deeply held interest,a common passion, an absolute conviction, a vital purpose to our lives. It’sbased on this book, the clues culled from history, and the things that have beenpassed down from older members to new members over the centuries.”“Sounds like a religion to me,” Alex said.Ralph shook his head again, along with everyone else. “The society was formed tokeep this knowledge until the day it would be needed. That is our purpose, notadoration or deification. We don’t worship this other world, or its people. It’ssimply an acknowledgment of the fact that we have a common ancestry, that we areboth, us here in this world and those in that place, individuals who are allpart of the greater noble race of mankind. We are one, in that life itself iswhat matters.”Ralph lifted a finger for emphasis as he made his point. “We want to stand readyto make sure that when the time comes, the individuals in that other world donot lose that precious gift of life because we failed to act on knowledge onlywe have. We would hope that those in that other world would have the samereverence for our lives, and not let innocent people here die needlessly.”Alex glanced over at Jax. She also appeared taken by the man’s words. It was howAlex felt about life and how precious it was. He remained silent, though, as HalHalverson put in a word.“Countless people have been born, grown up, become lifelong members of thesociety, and died without ever seeing any of the things we believe in come topass.”“Over the centuries,” Mike said, “the members made every effort to securecertain things having to do with the book. The most important thing, the thingthe Daggett Society searched hundreds of years for, was what they believed wouldbe the place of connection to this other world. In the late seventeen hundredsit was found by an explorer named Léon Deforce, who just happened to be a memberof the society. He carried word of his discovery back to the society in Europe.”He gestured to Ralph. “You know the most about that part. Why don’t you tellthem about it?”Ralph nodded and took up the story. “The members of the Daggett Society, havingfound the connection they had long believed to exist, emigrated from Europe tothe New World. They brought the book with them and settled in New England,mainly in Boston. At first many of them merely lived in the area to protect thewild place they had found, the place that matches the drawing in the book.”“Drawing?” Jax asked. “What drawing?”“The early members didn’t know where the place mentioned in the book waslocated, but there is a rough sketch in the book showing what it should looklike. Léon Deforce, being a member of the society, had carefully studied thedrawing in the book, so when he was on an expedition and saw the place, he knewimmediately what it was. That’s how he originally discovered its location—withthe help of the drawing.”“Over time,” Mike said, “they came to realize that with ever more peoplesettling in New England, more was going to need to be done to protect such asingular place in this world. The society eventually bought up the area theywere able to identify as central to everything, the place drawn in the book.“They eventually also acquired additional surrounding acreage to encircle andbetter buffer the crown jewel at its center—the original, larger part that youinherited, Alex. They set up the trust to further protect it. The inheritancewas established as a way of fulfilling the Law of Nines and telling when thepredictions of the book were coming about.“Over the years since, as members passed away and new members came along, theyworked to ensure the continuation and protection of the society and the land wehold so precious. They invested their own money to create the trust for thebenefit of the land.”“You see,” Ralph said with a smile, “the Law of Nines is from this ancient book,tied to it, tied to the land, and tied to you. From the beginning, the membersof the society have all studied it. Over the intervening centuries, theconditions it sets out never came to pass. The society remained vigilant,though, waiting for that time to come.”“We are the first members of the Daggett Society,” Mike said with great care andemphasis as he gestured around the room at his fellow members, “to actually havethe things in the book come about in our lifetimes. We can’t tell you what thismeans to us, Mr. Rahl.”“That’s quite the story,” Alex said into the sudden silence. “How much of it doyou all think is true?”A few members of the Daggett Society shared troubled looks.“Show them,” Ralph finally said.“Show us what?” Alex asked.Hal Halverson went into the other room while Ralph went on with his explanation.“We didn’t dare to bring the book. Considering all the things that have happenedrecently, we deemed it far too dangerous. The book is kept in a safe-deposit boxin a bank vault in Boston, along with the thing we brought. Besides the dangerof bringing the book here because of the people causing us all trouble, thebook, as you can imagine, is extremely fragile. We rarely dare to handle it.”“I see,” Alex said.“We brought something else, in its place,” Ralph said as he scratched aneyebrow. He readjusted his glasses as he waited. “We are hoping that this willmean something to you, since it’s a little more directly connected with you.”Hal Halverson came out of the other room with a narrow box not quite a foot anda half long. It was made of wood that was so dark with the patina of age it wasalmost black. He set it carefully on the table.Ralph stepped in close. “From the beginning, this has always been kept with thebook. It actually predates the book, and is part of the reason the book waswritten, and the society created.”He gently opened the cover of the box.Inside sat a silver knife that looked to be the twin to the one that Jaxcarried.Ralph reverently, lightly, touched a finger to the silver handle lying in a bedof purple velvet. “From the book, this letter R is said to identify the House ofRahl. The book says that this was brought from that other world, and in thatworld it was once carried by elite protectors of the Lord Rahl.”“Dear spirits,” Jax whispered as she stared at the weapon lying in the box.As the roomful of people watched, she drew her own knife, spun it through herfingers, and then set it on the table beside the one just like it resting invelvet.Everyone stared in shock at the identical weapons bearing the letter R.One of the men in the back fainted."},{"pageContent":"50.THE MEMBER OF THE DAGGETT SOCIETY stood frozen in shocked silence, staring atthe identical knives. Alex, facing all the people, saw the eyes of the man inthe back roll up in his head. Alex sprang forward to try to grab the man as hetoppled back, but he wasn’t close enough.When the man hit the floor they all suddenly came to their senses at the sametime and turned to help. Sounds of concern filled the room as everyone offeredadvice at the same time.“Tyler, just stay there,” one of the men said, kneeling down as the supine manstarted coming around. He gestured into the confusion. “Get a pillow to elevatehis feet.” He started taking the supine man’s pulse in a way that looked to Alexlike he knew what he was doing. “You’ll be fine, Tyler. Just lie there and letthe blood get to your brain.”“No, please, I’m all right now,” Tyler said, looking embarrassed as he liftedhis head.As someone pushed a pillow from the couch under Tyler’s legs, the man over himput a hand on his chest to hold him down.“I was just so shocked, that’s all. I’m fine, Doc.” Tyler started sitting up.“I’m all right,” he insisted, if weakly. When he started to stand, some of theother men reached in to steady him.“Maybe you’d better lie down,” Alex said as he gripped the man’s upper arm incase he keeled over again.“Yes, he should,” the doctor said.“I’m all right now,” Tyler said, his voice still sounding weak. “It’s just thatwhen Hal was opening that box to show you the knife that the society has held insafekeeping for over a thousand years, I was thinking of all the generations ofmembers who have lived for this day without ever seeing any of the things theybelieved in and waited for, and here I stand, seeing a prediction in a book overa thousand years old come to life right before my very eyes. But then when I sawthe other knife . . .”Everyone started talking at once. Jax took the opportunity to retrieve herweapon and return it to its sheath as she came around the table to see about theman.The doctor told Tyler to lie down on the couch and put his feet up. The man,embarrassed by the attention, didn’t want to, even though he still looked wobblyon his feet. People spoke up, telling him that he should follow the doctor’sorders.Out of the corner of his eye, on the other side of the knot of people, Alex sawa hand reach out and snatch the knife from its velvet bed in the open box.In a blur of movement, the middle-aged man with the knife elbowed a woman backout of his way as he dove for Jax.Jax saw him at the last instant and jerked back, but not fast enough. The bladecaught her with a glancing blow as she spun away from the surprise attack.Hal was close. He crashed through the chairs toward the man and deflected hisarm as he again drove the blade in toward Jax. By then, Alex was also flyinginto the melee. The woman who had been knocked out of the way by theknife-wielding man screamed.Other people yelled, “Fred, no!” at the attacker.Ignoring the cries for him to stop, Fred slashed wildly. Jax drew a knife as shedodged the attacks. As he lunged for her again, Hal kicked the arm of theknife-wielding man away from her. The blow whirled him around so that his backwas to Alex.As he raced in, Alex twisted to add momentum and power as he used all hisstrength to smash his elbow in against the back of the man’s neck. The impactwas enough to crush his vertebrae. The man went limp and in a sinuous movementcollapsed, sprawling onto his back as frightened people scrambled out of theway.The doctor went to a knee beside him, putting fingers to the side of his neck.“He’s still alive, someone call—”Using a foot to boost herself, Jax leaped over a toppled chair, knife in hand.She landed beside the downed man and, with both fists around the handle of herknife, drove the blade down through the center of the prostrate man’s face. Itslammed in far enough to hit the back of the skull.“Now he’s not,” Jax growled.Alex saw blood down the front of her white blouse, but other things had suddenlytaken priority. He grabbed Jax by the arm, lifting her. She held on to the knifeas he hauled her up. The bloody blade abruptly came unstuck and drew back out asshe pulled it with her.Alex shoved her back toward the wall behind the table. As she was stillstumbling back and hitting the wall, he rounded the table and drew his gun. Heused the table as a physical barrier to maintain space as he brought the weaponup, pointing it at the people before him.“Everyone on the ground!”They froze in shock.“On your knees! Now! Or I’ll start shooting!”People dropped to their knees in a panic.“Hands behind your heads! Lock your fingers!”“I’m a doctor,” one of the men said. “Jax is hurt. Let me help her.”“On your knees or you’re dead! Understand?”The man nodded reluctantly.“Jax?” Alex asked over his shoulder without taking his eyes off the people linedup on the floor. “How bad is it?”“Not bad enough for you to put down your Glock.”Alex didn’t find her words all that encouraging, since he knew that she believedhe was more important to stopping Cain’s plan than she was. At least she wastalking.Alex gestured with a tilt of his head. “Hal, take a look, will you please?”Hal, to the side on one knee with his hands raised, rushed to do as Alex asked.Alex focused on the task at hand, on watching everyone in case there wereaccomplices to the man who had attacked Jax. He didn’t know if there was anothertraitor among the society. For all he knew this whole thing was an elaboratetrap. He didn’t want to panic into pulling the trigger, but he had to be readyin case it became necessary.As Alex kept the gun leveled on the cluster of people kneeling on the carpet inthe middle of the room, he saw Hal rush over to the wet bar and grab a towel. Heheard the towel being ripped.“Hal—talk to me.”“Dead Fred there caught her arm with the knife. Fortunately it hasn’t beensharpened in a thousand years or it might have done more serious damage. I’m nota doctor, but I’m sure she’s going to need stitches.”Alex let out a sigh of relief.“What’s the plan, Alex?” Hal asked as he walked Jax over to the wet bar,pressing a towel against her forearm the whole way.“The plan is not to have any more surprises.”“That was a pretty big one,” Ralph said from his place on the floor. “I’ve knownFred Logan for years and I never thought him capable of anything like that. Idon’t understand what’s going on.”“That makes two of us,” Mike Fenton said.Alex kept his finger alongside the barrel of the gun as he sighted through theiron sights, fearing to hold his finger against the trigger lest something makehim flinch and cause him to accidentally press it. He knew from countless hoursof practice that from where they were on the floor no one could beat him to hisgun before he could twitch his finger down to the trigger.Hal cursed under his breath. Out of the corner of his eye Alex saw him leading asomewhat wobbly Jax around behind.“That damn bar sink isn’t big enough to wash a grape,” Hal said. “I need to takeher into the bathroom and use the sink in there, or the tub.”“How bad is it?” the doctor asked.“It didn’t seem to cut any veins. She’s lucky.”“Right, lucky,” Jax growled.Underlying the sarcasm, Alex could read the anger in her voice. He was relievedthat she was angry. That meant it wasn’t as bad as he’d feared at first.“I have a kit in my car,” the doctor said.“You just do as Alex asked, Doc, and stay right there for the moment,” Hal said.“Well, wash around it good but don’t get soap in the laceration, then wrap ittight enough to put compression on the wound to stop the bleeding.”“Will do,” Hal said, his voice echoing from the bathroom as he flicked on thelight.“Mr. Rahl?” Mildred said, unable to take her eyes off the bloody corpse sprawledon the floor in front of her. “I think I’m going to be sick.”“Mildred, look at me.” The frightened woman looked up at him. “You’re going tobe fine. Don’t look at him, look at me. You’re not going to be sick. You’re amember of the Daggett Society. You’re going to be strong.”That seemed to buck her up a little. She took a deep breath and kept her eyes onAlex. He hoped she wasn’t in on it.“I don’t understand,” Mike Fenton said. “We’ve all known Fred Logan for years.”“Don’t feel bad,” Alex said. “I’ve been fooled by these people as well. They’regood at what they do. You knew Fred here for years. I’ve only known most of youfor hours. There is a lot at stake. I hope you understand why I can’t take anychances.”Most of the people nodded.Alex was glad to see Jax coming out of the bedroom. Her left forearm had amakeshift bandage made of strips of motel towels.She drew her knife as she knelt down beside Alex. “I’m fine,” she whispered.“I’m just angry with myself that he caught me off guard like that. I feel stupidletting him cut me.”“Now you know how I felt,” Alex said.A number of the people watching from only a few feet away gasped when Jax leanedover and started cutting symbols into the dead man’s forehead. The beige carpetwas soaked with blood all around his head. Yet more trickled down as Jax cut.Finished, Jax sat back on her heels. Alex concentrated on trying to stop hishands from shaking as he sighted down the gun at people he hoped he wouldn’thave to shoot.“Jesus H. Christ,” Hal said under his breath. “He’s vanished.”Alex glanced down and saw that the dead man was indeed gone. The carpet wasclean. Jax’s knife was clean.“He was from my world,” Jax said to the people watching in wide-eyed shock. “Isent him back.”Everyone began asking questions at once.“Quiet!” Alex shouted. The room fell silent.“What now?” Jax whispered to him.“Now,” he said so that everyone could hear, “we’re going to test all of thesepeople to see if any of them vanish and go back like Fred did.”People gasped in fear. Alex gestured with one hand to quiet them down.“Don’t worry, we’re not going to use a knife.”Struck with a sudden worry of his own, he glanced over at Jax and whispered,“You don’t need to cut the skin, do you?”“No. I only use a knife because I want to send their people a message, a messagedelivered in blood. I can use anything that will make marks.”“Hal,” Alex said, gesturing with his gun, “frisk them. I want to know if any ofthem are armed.”Hal apologized as he went from one person to the next, doing a thorough job oflooking for hidden weapons. When finished, he stood.“No hand grenades, no rocket launchers.”“Good. Can you get Jax a pen off the table there, please?”Hal stayed out of the line of fire and walked around behind to hand Jax the pen.Jax crooked a finger at Mike Fenton, then pointed at the carpet a few feet infront of her. “Stay on your knees and come forward.”Mike moved forward, keeping his fingers locked behind his head. He looked up atHal, as if pleading his case.“Just do as they ask, Mike. After what happened with Fred, Alex is making sense.We have to check everyone out.”“Why not you?” Mike asked.Hal heaved a sigh and knelt down in front of Jax. He tapped a finger against hisforehead. “Test me first.”Jax nodded and started drawing the symbols with the stubby motel pen. When shefinished she sat back on her heels and rested her drawing hand in her lap. Halturned and showed off the symbols on his forehead.“See?” she said to the group. “I’m drawing a trigger that will activate alifeline to take anyone from my world back there. If Hal had been from my world,he would have gone back just like that dead man, Fred, did.”Everyone nodded that it made sense. They all looked considerably less worried.They came up one at a time and let Jax draw on their foreheads with the pen. Itlooked bizarre to see a roomful of people on their knees, all getting strangesymbols drawn on their foreheads.Mildred went last. She didn’t vanish. She looked relieved, though, as if she hadfeared she somehow might.“I wish I could somehow preserve it,” she said to the group as she looked at alltheir foreheads. “We’re the first members of the society to see something fromthat other world since the book was first written.”“Now what?” Hal asked, concerned with more important things than preserving adesign.“Now we let the doctor see to Jax’s arm,” Alex said.“About time,” the man grumbled as he stood and came forward.On his way by, Hal grabbed the man’s shirt at his shoulder. “Don’t you be thatway to Alex. Fred’s the one who tried to kill Jax. Alex didn’t have to come. Hedidn’t have to take the land and he doesn’t have to be a part of any of this.Don’t begrudge him being afraid for his life, and the life of this young lady,here. It was one of the people we asked him to trust who attacked her.”The doctor sighed. “You’re right, Hal. Sorry, Alex, Jax. I guess I just feelguilty because we let one of them into our midst. We could have ruinedeverything, and it would have been our fault.”Other people nodded.“Like I said, they fooled me, too,” Alex said. “But just because you all passedthe first test, that doesn’t mean that I’m satisfied yet. Jax and I were almostkilled by a doctor from this world who was working with them.”Hal looked surprised. “Seriously?”“Serious as a heart attack,” Alex said.“This is going to need stitches,” the doctor said as he unwrapped Jax’s arm.“Can’t you use magic glue?” Jax asked.When the doctor frowned up at her, Alex said, “She means superglue.”“Oh. Well, I could.”“I have some in my truck. Hal, you want to get it?”“Wait.” The doctor tossed Hal his keys. “Get my bag out of the back seat of mycar instead, will you? I’ve got superglue but it’s medical grade. It’s moreflexible and works better.”Hal hurried out. He shortly returned with a black bag.The doctor gestured to the table. “Over there. Let’s get her over there so shecan lay her arm on the table.”The two of them guided Jax over to the table. The doctor warned her that theglue would feel hot and sting. If it did, she didn’t voice a reaction. Alexdidn’t hear a peep out of her as he kept his eye on the group on their kneesbefore him. A few of them were getting tired and sat back on their heels.It seemed to take forever, but when the doctor was finished Jax reappeared atAlex’s side sporting a tightly wrapped arm below the rolled-up sleeve of herwhite blouse.“I have blood all over me,” she said. “I need to get some other clothes or Iwill draw attention.”With a quick glance, he saw that she looked like she’d participated in an axmurder. “You’re right. Hal, would you go out to my truck with her? Watch herback?”Hal caught the keys when Alex tossed them. “Sure.”After they had returned, Jax hurried into the other room to change. It wasn’tlong until she came out of the bedroom wearing the red top and different jeans.“What now?” Hal asked.“Now,” Alex said, “we’re leaving.”“What about all of us?” Mike asked. “We have so much more we need to talkabout.”“We’ll have to talk later. I’m going to let Hal do the second half of thetesting first, to see if any of you were in cahoots with your dead DaggettSociety member from another world.”Alex kept the gun pointed in the general direction of the group as he took Jaxby the arm and backed toward the door."},{"pageContent":"51.ANY IDEAS WHAT WE SHOULD DO?” Jax asked on the way across the dark lot towardthe Cherokee. Safely out of the room, Alex scanned the area and at lastholstered his gun. “I don’t see that we have a lot of options. We can go afterthem or we can run.”“If we run they will hunt us down.”“Then I guess that answers your question.”He looked back over his shoulder to see Hal come out of the motel room and turnto tell everyone to wait there and that he would be back shortly and they woulddiscuss it all then. Hal shut the door and started across the lot after them.He was carrying something under an arm.“We came here to get to the land and see what we could figure out,” Alex toldJax in a low voice. “I think it’s about time we do so.”“That makes sense,” she said as she watched the shadows at the edge of the lot.“But I don’t think we’re going to be able to get to it in the middle of thenight.”“And it’s still a long drive to get there. We’ll probably have to get a roomsomewhere along the way, grab a little sleep, and then first thing in themorning collect some supplies and head up toward Castle Mountain.”Hal Halverson caught up with them as Alex was unlocking the Jeep. Hal setsomething dark on the hood of the truck. Even though it was hard to see in thedark, Alex thought that he knew what it was.“So I’ve got to ask, why did you trust me in there and no one else?”“Two reasons,” Alex said. “First, you were the one who kept Fred from doingworse to Jax.”Hal shrugged. “Makes sense, but I could still have been party to it.”“True, but you were the only one in that room who has had a background check.You and your security force have all had extensive law-enforcement backgroundchecks. I’m sure they must be quite thorough.”Hal smiled. “That’s pretty good.”“That’s the second part of the test—run those background checks on everyone inthere.”“You think there was someone working with Fred? Someone from this world in onit?”“I’d bet on it. From what I’ve seen, these people from the other side try tofind people here to help them. I’m not sure what they offer but they canprobably come up with any wish or want.”“Anyone in particular you suspect?”“Tyler.”Hal nodded unhappily. “That’s what I was thinking. He provided the diversion forFred to make the attack.”“That was my thought, too,” Jax said.“It may not be him,” Alex said. “In fact, it may not be any of them.But you need to do the most extensive background check you can and see ifanything troubling turns up. If it does, it could indicate that the person wouldbe susceptible to being turned against us.”Hal nodded. “I was FBI before I came on board with the trust. If any of themdidn’t wash behind their ears in the third grade I’ll find out about it.”“Keep in mind that the people we’re dealing with are killers,” Jax said. “Be asquick about it as you can. If one or more of them are working against us, thenthe rest of those people in there are in great danger. Any traitor among themwould be able to point assassins right toward them.”Hal let out a deep breath. “They’re good people. At least the clean ones are.They’ve given up a great deal for their belief in the purpose of the society.They’ve devoted their lives to protecting the people in your world. They’re inthere now, cleaning up Jax’s blood to avoid any kind of trouble.”Jax nodded. “All the more reason to take measures to protect them. None of uswants good people to get hurt.”“Do you want me to help you two find a place to stay tonight? It was a longdrive from Nebraska. In the morning we could get back together and you could askthem about any other information on the land that might be helpful.”“We’ve done what we needed to do,” Alex said. “The deed to the land istransferred. It’s now legally mine and I’m signed off on the trust as well. Therequirements are fulfilled.”In the faint illumination of a light that lit up the lot closer to the building,Alex could see the man smile a little. “That’s what I would do. Safer to be onyour own, without being around people who know you.”Alex frowned as an idea came to him. “This book that the society keeps, itdoesn’t have any information about something called a gateway, does it?”“Gateway?” Hal shook his head. “No. Never heard of it. There is one place,though, that says that the one identified by the Law of Nines will know thesecret. Maybe they were talking about the gateway.“But listen,” Hal went on, “there is one other thing from the book that weweren’t able to get to because of the attack.”“What would that be?” Alex asked.Hal slid the object sitting on the hood of the truck toward Alex. “The knife weshowed you. We didn’t get the chance to tell you that the book says this must goto you, that you will need it.”“Are you sure?” Jax asked.Hal nodded. “In a way, the whole purpose of the book, the whole part with theLaw of Nines, and all the rest, is just a long involved way of finding theperson this knife needs to go to.”“And what am I supposed to do with it? What purpose does it have?”Hal shrugged. “Sorry, but the book is mute on that topic. It insists that youmust have this, but doesn’t say why. In a way, the whole purpose of the DaggettSociety is to make sure you get this knife.”Alex lifted the lid to look at the silver knife lying in the box. Faint light onthe side of the building reflected off the ornate scrollwork that made up theletter R.Alex sighed. “Then they’ve carried out their part in all of this—for the timebeing, at least. It’s up to me now.“Besides, I don’t want to stick around long enough to give other people a reasonto snatch those people and torture them for information about us. They don’thave the mind-set to deal with the likes of those who are after us.”“They’re good people, but you’re right, they don’t think like we do. Most peoplearen’t good at being properly paranoid. I’m thankful that you seem to have theknack.”Alex smiled. “You’d be paranoid, too, if people were after you.”“Guess so,” Hal said with a laugh. He pulled some papers out of his insidejacket pocket and laid them on the hood of the Jeep. He brought up a smallflashlight.“Here are some maps I thought you could use.” He shined the light on a state mapas he opened it. “I’ve outlined the property, since it isn’t identified on anymap. This highway here is the best way to get up that way. Then take this roadhere, through Westfield.”Hal tapped a thick finger next to the town. “Most people go through Westfield ontheir way to Baxter State Park. It’s a tourist town that has become adestination in and of itself. A lot of art, crafts, antiques, that sort ofthing.“Instead of heading on toward Baxter State Park, though, you take this smallroad that cuts off here, right after Westfield. Then follow it up this way,” hesaid, tracing the road with his finger. “It will eventually take you all the wayto the property, right here.“It’s about a two-, two-and-a-half-hour drive from Westfield to the property. Itonly gets more remote the farther you go. If you want any food, supplies, orgas, you’d best get it in Westfield, because there isn’t anything between thereand the property except woods.”“Are there any roads on the property?” Alex asked.“Yes, if you have four-wheel drive. Your Jeep is ideal.”“Good.”Hal pulled out a paper from under the map. “I drew this out for you. It showsthe state road, here, that’s on the regular maps, and then here I drew in theprivate road that isn’t. This takes you onto the property. Here’s thecombination for the locks. We keep the gate locked at all times to keep peopleout.“These roads, here, on the property, are only accessible by four-wheel drive.You can only drive into the land for a short distance, and then you have to hikethe rest of the way to Castle Mountain. That’s here,” he said as he tapped thehomemade map. “I marked it for you.”“Thanks,” Alex said. “This will be a big help.”The man extended his hand. Alex and Jax shook it in turn.“I’ll call my people and tell them they can expect to see you out there sometimeprobably late tomorrow morning,” Hal said. “I’ll give them a description of yourtruck and the license number so that they won’t get spooked when they see it.”“Good idea,” Alex said.“I’ll tell them to watch your back, and make sure you aren’t followed once onthe property.”“Thanks, but I’m afraid that won’t do a whole lot of good. These people can showup out of thin air.”Hal sighed heavily. “I suspected as much.” He handed Alex another piece ofpaper. “Here’s my number. It’s a new phone, never been used. Call if you needanything. If need be I’ll come with guns blazing.”Alex smiled. “Will do.” As he gathered up the maps he saw a small envelope.“What’s this?”Hal frowned as he took it from Alex’s hand. “I don’t know. I had the mapssitting on the table earlier, before you two arrived. I must have picked it upwith the maps without seeing it.”He turned it over. Both sides were blank. He ran a finger under the flap,tearing it open. He unfolded the piece of paper that was inside and stared at ita moment, reading.“All it says is, ‘Hamburg, Germany, seven-fifteen a.m. local time. London,England, six-thirty a.m. local time.’ ”Alex took the paper and looked it over. The words were handwritten with precisecare. He handed it back.“Any idea what it is?”“Not a clue.”“Well, we have a long drive tonight. We need to be on our way.”As Alex and Jax climbed in the truck, Hal came to the driver’s door. “You becareful, Alex.” He ducked down so that he could look over at Jax in thepassenger seat. “You too, and please take care of him for us?”“That’s why I’m here,” she said with a smile.“We all have been waiting a very long time for you to finally come to theproperty, Alex. We’d all hate it if you got yourself killed on our watch.”Alex didn’t want to tell the man what he thought of his chances of success. “Yoube careful, too, Hal.”Alex turned the key as Hal nodded.Nothing happened. Alex sighed.“Hal, could you give me a little push, please, to get us rolling. The starterhas a dead spot in it.”Hal put a hand against the windshield pillar. “If this happens once you get outon the property you’re going to be in trouble. You can’t roll the truck to getit started on those rutted dirt and rock roads. Listen—I assume you planned ongrabbing some sleep in Westfield tonight?”“That’s the plan,” Alex said. “Unless you have a better place.”“No,” Hal said, shaking his head. “Not a lot of choices going that way, unlessyou’d like to sleep in the truck, but I don’t advise that, not out all alonewhere unfriendly eyes could look in and spot you sleeping. Kind of dangerous.Better to stay in a room.”“I thought the same thing.”“A lot of people up that way drive four-wheelers. Westfield has a small Jeepdealership. You ought to stop in first thing in the morning and let them fix thestarter while you get any supplies you need.”“Thanks for the tip. You wouldn’t believe how long I’ve been putting off gettingthe starter fixed.”“Take care,” Hal said as he leaned his weight in and pushed. “As soon as I runthe background checks I’ll head out to the property to be close if you need me,”he said as he trotted along beside the truck, pushing.As they picked up enough speed, Alex let the clutch out. The engine turned overand started without a fuss. Alex waved good-bye to Hal, then rolled up thewindow as he made his way out of the lot back toward Hammond Street.“You can take a nap if you’d like,” he said to Jax.“I’d rather keep a lookout. Cain’s people are waiting for us somewhere out inthat darkness.”"},{"pageContent":"52.MAY I SEE YOUR DRIVER’S LICENSE, PLEASE?” the young woman behind the counterasked as she entered information into a computer.Alex glanced out the side window, keeping an eye on Jax to make sure she was allright. The blue “Vacancy” sign lit up the side of her face as she sat in theidling Jeep just outside watching him. Tired as he was, he reminded himself thathe had to remain vigilant.Alex tossed the license that said “Hank Croft” across the counter to the woman.Displayed under the glass that covered the counter were brochures forsightseeing tours, kayak rentals, a logging museum, and nearby places to visit.Menus from several local restaurants were also on display.Alex didn’t know if the phony name would do any good in throwing their pursuersoff track. To get to the land he had to drive in from Westfield or come the longway around from the other side of town, or come in from way north. Those werethe only three possible routes to get to the road onto the land, or to even getclose to the remote property. He was sure that there had to be people watchingfor him and Jax on all three of those routes. Those people would have adescription.Unless he dropped in from the sky, Alex had no real hope of sneaking onto theland unseen. Cain’s people had the advantage of knowing right where he and Jaxwere headed, while they, on the other hand, had no way of knowing who was fromanother world and might be watching them, ready to pounce at any moment.For all Alex knew, the Westfield Inn could be run by people from another worldjust like the ninth floor of Mother of Roses had been. He and Jax could beambushed in their sleep. He wondered if he was starting to be too paranoid.Given everything he knew, he wondered if that was even possible.The young woman handed his license back. “Thank you, Mr. Croft. Here’s your keyand your receipt.” She leaned forward to look out the screen door as she pointedto the right in an exaggerated manner. “Down the drive to the end of thebuilding, follow it around to the second entrance. The room is inside to theleft.”“Thanks.” Alex picked up the key and papers. “Can you tell me where the Jeepdealership is?”“Sure.” She pointed in the opposite direction. “Just keep going down the highwayinto town. It’s only a tenth of a mile or so. You can almost see it from here.It will be on your right. You can’t miss it.” She snorted a little laugh toherself. “It’s not like Westfield is very big.”Alex drove through the fairly crowded lot and found their room without anydifficulty. He took the box with the knife in with him. He was afraid to let itout of his sight.Entering the room, he flicked on a small light over the door. He saw by theglowing red numbers on the clock on the nightstand that it was well pastmidnight. He was dead tired and falling asleep on his feet. He kept his hand onhis holstered gun as he checked the small closet and the bathroom.“How’s the arm feel?” he asked, after clearing the room and quickly covering themirrors.Jax looked equally sleepy. “It’s fine.”“Liar,” he said as he closed the drapes over the small window that looked outinto darkness. He imagined eyes out in that darkness watching, waiting.Jax looked around at the small room, then tossed the duffel bag on one of thebeds. The room smelled like pine-scented cleaner. The color scheme of the cheapdecoration was blue and brown. As sleepy as Alex was, the bed looked wonderfullyinviting.He felt discouraged to be this close to their destination without having yetcome up with any solid idea of what they needed to do. It was daunting to be atthe center of so many things all leading to him, all depending on him. He feltlike a fraud, a nobody appointed by fate to do the impossible.He turned to Jax when she put a hand on his shoulder, as if she were reading hismind and offering silent comfort.He brushed a lock of blond hair back off her face. “Any ideas come to you yetabout how to stop Cain?”“Sure, one.”He squinted suspiciously. “What would that be?”“Only you can make the gateway work for him. I could kill you and thentheoretically the gateway would be useless to him.”Alex couldn’t help but smile. “Then why don’t you?”She slipped her arms around him and hugged him close, laying her head againsthis chest. “Because then the world would be a lonely, empty place.”If she ever left it, it certainly would be.Alex was so tired he could hardly stand. After a long day of traveling, theheart-pounding terror of the events with the people back in Bangor and his fearthat she had been hurt or worse had drained him. The long drive through thenight after that had completely sapped any remaining energy he might have had.It seemed that even his spirit had abandoned him, leaving him feeling nothingbut despair at what lay ahead. In the back of his mind, he couldn’t help butthink that the only thing that really lay ahead for them both was death.He sat down on one of the double beds. Jax sat with him, one arm still aroundhis waist. When he lay back on the bed, she went with him. Together they bothmoved up to put their heads on the pillow.In such a remote, lonely place, on such a desperate, lonely mission, their onlycomfort was with each other. In the shelter of each other’s arms they bothsilently shared an understanding of the enormity of the task before them andfelt at least momentary refuge from its unknown terrors.They came together in a soft, gentle kiss. Jax was so warm and alive in his armsthat it made life itself seem to have a point and a purpose. Her kiss felt asperfect, as compassionate, as any kiss he could imagine.Somewhere over the course of events since Jax had first come into his life backin Nebraska, she had come to be at the center of his heart. It seemed a mysteryexactly when that had happened. In a way, it seemed like he had always knownher, always known that he never wanted to be with anyone else but her. Therecould be no one else.By the way she kissed him back, he knew she felt the same.Right then, right there, that feeling seemed complete. There could have been nobetter comfort in the face of all the difficulty they faced. No matter whathappened, they were together. Somehow, that seemed more important, morewonderful, to him than anything else.In a loose embrace, still fully dressed, they fell asleep.Alex woke with a start. Jax, still in his arms, woke up when he did. In themuted, mellow light, it took a moment to remember where he was. Weak daylightleaked in around the curtain. The small light over the door around the corner ofthe bathroom was still on. He looked over at glowing red numbers on the clock onthe nightstand. It was a little past seven.Alex yawned. He wanted to go back to sleep. He wanted to keep holding Jax.But he couldn’t. He needed to get the Cherokee over to the dealer and see if hecould talk them into doing a rush job of replacing the starter. He figured thatif he gave them a big tip up front it might help persuade them to hurry.“Do I have time for a bath?” Jax asked.“Sure, go ahead. I’ll run the truck down the street and leave it to get thestarter fixed. That should give you plenty of time. We’re going to need to goout and pick up some supplies and hopefully by then the starter in the truckshould be fixed.”She rolled over on top of him. “Do we have time for another kiss?”He pulled her into his arms in answer. Her hair slipped forward over hershoulders to fall around his face, as if even her hair wanted to be close tohim. After a long, luxurious kiss she pushed back.With a finger she brushed his hair back off his forehead. “I’ve never cared thismuch for anyone.”“I know. Me neither.”“Not even Bethany?” she said with a mischievous grin.“Especially not Bethany,” he said without smiling before he pulled her back foranother kiss.When it ended she pushed back again. “What are we going to do about us?”“What do you mean?”She shrugged as her eyes turned away. “Well, I’m not from here. If I can find away, I have to go back.”She had just touched the agony that tortured him. Alex knew that he couldn’t askher to turn her back on the people who were depending on her. He didn’t knowwhat or who she was in her world, but he knew that she was someone importantthere, and that people needed her.“What if there was a way for me to go with you?”She sighed. “If only . . . but you can never come to my world. There is no waythat can ever happen. Without the spark of the gift that those of us there allcarry, you can’t make it into my world. You would only die in the attempt. Ifyou can work the gateway, you can’t use it. I can. With the gateway I would havea way to return home. I must . . .”Alex swallowed at the painful thought of her leaving his world, leaving him.“Maybe I won’t be able to figure out the gateway.”“No hope of that,” she said with a sigh. “You’re Alexander Rahl.”“Well, who knows. We may never have to worry about it.”Her brow bunched together. “What do you mean?”“If Cain has his way we’ll both die before then.”Her smile returned. “You have a way of making me smile even when my heart isbreaking.”“Then you should at least give me another kiss.”She did. It was a kiss that made the kisses before seem less than meaningful. Ittook Alex away, made him forget everything but her. It made him feel complete,as if he had never really been alive before that moment. In that moment he felt,for the first time in his life, sheer, perfect bliss.Finally, she pulled breathlessly away. Alex didn’t think he would ever getenough of looking at her. She was the most perfectly feminine creature he hadever known. She was so beautiful it made him ache for her.“So,” she whispered as she looked down into his eyes, “do we have time for morethan a kiss?”"},{"pageContent":"53.ALEX HAD BEEN correct—a hundred-dollar tip to the service writer got him aneager promise of prompt attention. Fearing to give the man the phony licensebecause the registration for the Jeep was under his real name, he handed overhis real driver’s license instead.“All right, Mr. Rahl,” the man behind the small podium in the drive-in entrancesaid, “we’ll have you fixed and back to your vacation in no time. Is there anumber where I can reach you?”“Sorry, I forgot to recharge my cell phone last night. I’ll just check back withyou after a while.”“Give us a few hours and we should have it taken care of.” He pointed with hispen. “You can wait in the lounge, if you like, and I’ll come get you when it’sfinished.”“I have some errands to take care of. I’ll check back.”“We’ll be here. You can get out the same way—through the lounge.”Alex thanked the man and made his way past the line of other trucks waiting tobe taken in for service. Out the open overhead door the leaden sky seemed likeit was descending to smother the town.As Alex went through the lounge the word “Hamburg” coming from the TV stoppedhim cold in his tracks.The morning news anchor on the TV was giving a report about a massive fire at ahotel in Hamburg, Germany. The alarm system in the hotel had reportedlymalfunctioned and the firefighters had problems getting adequate water to thesite. Dozens of deaths were feared.“Fifteen minutes later, in London,” the announcer said, “another tragedy struckwhen a runaway truck crashed into a crowd of people outside a busy trainstation. Sources say that as many as eleven people were killed with a number ofothers seriously injured. The driver fled the scene. Police are searching forhim and hope to have him in custody soon. Authorities say it is the worst suchaccident in recent memory.”Alex stood frozen, his mind racing, as he watched the international news for afew minutes more, waiting to see if they would say anything else, but they wenton with stories about a global summit on world economic growth that leaders fromthe industrialized nations were scheduled to attend in Japan in the coming days.Alex remembered the note that Hal had found with the maps in the room back inBangor. It had listed two cities: Hamburg and London. The times written on thatnote had been for that morning, and they had been fifteen minutes apart. He knewwithout doubt that it was not a coincidence.He hurried up the street, suddenly feeling the urgent need to get back to Jax.He rushed into the room and found her pacing. She had an envelope in her hand.“The phone rang. I answered it. The person said that there was a letter at thefront desk for Hank Croft. So I went to the office. They wanted identification.I showed them the thing that Mike Fenton made for me that shows my image andsays I’m Jenna Croft. They gave me this.”Jax handed him the envelope. On the outside was written “Mr. Hank Croft.”Alex tore it open. Inside was a single folded piece of paper. He recognized theprecise handwriting. It was the same as the handwriting on the paper HalHalverson had found.Jax bit down nervously on her lower lip as she watched him reading. “Well, whatis it?”“It’s a list of cities—Springfield, Scranton, Raleigh, Tampa, Mobile,Indianapolis, Fort Worth, Grand Rapids, Denver, Bismarck, Winnipeg, Provo,Sydney, Boise, Eugene, Mexico City, Bakersfield. It says ‘Now’ at the bottom.”Alex’s hands shook as he lowered the paper.“Do you know what it means?” Jax asked.“I think I do, but I hope to hell I’m wrong.”He switched on the TV. The images of confusion and screaming people hit him likea blow.“Breaking News” ran in a big band across the left corner at the top of thescreen. The second line underneath said “Terror Attacks Rock the Nation.” Thenews crawl rolled slowly across the bottom of the screen, listing cities whereattacks were reported—all cities that were on the list in Alex’s hand.“As these reports are just now coming in, the president has promised a statementsometime within the hour,” the anchorwoman said. “We’re also just getting wordthat mayors and governors across the nation . . .” The woman glanced to the sideto someone or something off camera. She looked rattled.“We’re getting news from Florida.” She cleared her throat.“Sources are reporting that Hamilton High School in Tampa, Florida, is the sceneof a large fire. We have a live report from our local affiliate there in Tampa.”They switched to a man in a gray suit holding a microphone. In the background acolumn of smoke rose into a blue sky.“The county school administrator here in Tampa, Loretta Dean, has just issued abrief statement saying that the fire is confined to the Hamilton High Schoolauditorium. Other, unnamed sources tell us that students were assembled there asthey arrived at school to be counseled in dealing with the frightening news ofthe knife attacks at schools in Raleigh and Indianapolis. It was during thatassembly that fire broke out.“The size of the fire—as you can see in the background—is extensive. Severalstudents we’ve spoken with who managed to escape the blaze tell us that whenthey tried to get out of the auditorium, they found the exit doors were locked.They say that the people inside panicked and students were trampled in anattempt to escape. Unnamed sources are telling us that the doors were allheavily chained and that over three hundred students and teachers were trappedinside until firefighters were able to use the jaws of life to cut the chains.School officials insist that they have never used chains on school doors.Firefighters were not able to determine how many students may have been overcomeby smoke and died before they were able to gain entrance.”The reporter went to news footage that showed mass panic, with parents screamingand crying as they arrived on scene.Alex switched the station. A man was reading from papers in his hands. “Theseknife attacks in Mobile and Springfield were all on schools or preschools, whilethe ones in Scranton and Eugene were at local hospitals. The Winnipeg and Boiseattacks took place at early-morning church services. Authorities confirm thatthe patients and workers who died at the retirement home in Springfield werealso victims of knife attacks, but they declined to give the number of dead.“Unconfirmed reports say that, as in the other attacks, the throats of all thevictims had been cut, linking all the attacks in the methods used.“At the school in Grand Rapids, police cornered the two knife-wieldingassailants in an upstairs library after they had reportedly managed to gainentrance to a classroom and murder an undetermined number of middle-schoolersbefore the police arrived on scene. The SWAT team conducted an assault on thelibrary, where the suspects had barricaded the doors. Unnamed police sources saythat when the SWAT team entered, the assailants had vanished. An extensivehouse-to-house search is under way.”“They will never find them,” Jax whispered to herself as she stared at the TV.Tears ran down her face, dripping off her jaw.“We’re also getting sketchy reports of an attack in Mexico City.Terrorism experts we’ve been able to talk with are shocked by this latestdevelopment in what over just the last few minutes has developed into aninternational crisis, with Mexico only the latest country reporting similarattacks along with Canada, England, and Germany. Unconfirmed reports of attacksare also coming in from Australia.”The camera switched to another reporter at a fiery scene. “There is massconfusion in Denver right now at a plant that produces components for windturbine generators. Plant officials say that there were over a hundredthird-shift workers trapped in the main assembly building when fire broke out.“The surprise attacks and killings of workers leaving their jobs a short timeago at Easton Fabrication on the outskirts of Denver has only added to thestrain on emergency services, as have the fires at two of Denver’s hospitals.Those fires are now said to be contained. While many people are calling this adeliberate act of terror, officials are cautioning people not to jump toconclusions.“Yet across the world this morning, the death toll from all of these incidentsis expected to reach well into the hundreds. In every instance, it seems, theattacks have been carried out in the most gruesome fashion possible, withvictims either being trapped in burning buildings or, in other cases, withvictims reportedly having their throats cut.“So far, no group has claimed responsibility.“Moments ago, the president issued a brief statement calling for calm amidst agrowing cry for retaliation. He also said that his heart goes out to thefamilies of victims.“As of yet no terrorist group has taken responsibility or been linked to theattacks. Officials have insisted that none of the attacks bear resemblance tothe pattern of any known terror group, except in their deadly nature andbrutality, and of course in the way in which they have targeted innocent people.“Military officials we spoke with, who wish to remain anonymous, say that theattacks are at a level of coordination and focus never seen before. In responseto comments made by a number of people, Homeland Security undersecretary RobertFranklin said that it was too early to say that the nature of the attacksappears to be intended as a message of some sort. He went on to promise thatthose responsible would be caught and brought to justice.”Alex switched off the TV.With trembling fingers he folded the paper listing all the cities and put it inhis pocket.“Let’s go.”"},{"pageContent":"54.AS THEY LEFT THE MOTEL and walked quickly down the sidewalk toward the center ofthe small town of Westfield, Jax put her hand on his back in silent compassion.Neither of them spoke. Both of them were in a state of shock at the unexpectedturn of events.Radell Cain had just turned everything upside down. Before, Alex hadn’t knownwhat to do, but the task had at least seemed straightforward. Now he felt a numbsense of paralyzing shock and dismay. It no longer simply seemed a matter ofpreventing Radell Cain from getting access to the gateway. In light of suchchaos everything had just gotten far more complex.The heavy overcast seemed to match their mood. It made the day feel quiet andsomber.“I’m ashamed that people from my world have come here and done this,” Jax saidas they walked past a bakery.Alex shifted the duffel bag to the other side so that he could take her hand asthey hurried along the sidewalk.“Don’t take on guilt for murders just because they came from where you live. Youcame here to stop these people. You’re risking your life to stop them. You haveno reason to feel ashamed.”She squeezed his hand in appreciation of his words. He could see another tear ortwo run down her face.“I’m the one who should have done something,” he finally said into the silence.“From the beginning you’ve been trying to tell me how brutal these people are.You tried to do something; I didn’t listen. If I had believed you in the firstplace, acted sooner, maybe this wouldn’t be happening.”“Don’t you now blame yourself, Alex. Radell Cain is responsible.”“But maybe I could have—”“No, you couldn’t. Don’t let him make you fall into the trap of second-guessingyourself. He’s been watching you and making his moves based on what you do, notwhen you did it. Had you acted sooner it would only have prompted him to makehis move sooner.“He’s sending us a message. There is nothing either of us could have done tostop him. If we had gotten here sooner he would have only carried out theseattacks sooner.“I’ve seen him do this sort of thing before. This is the way he thinks. He willkill as many people as he has to in order to get what he wants. It neveroccurred to me that he would bring his ruthless methods here, to this world. Itwas foolish of me not to realize he would.”Alex raked his fingers back through his hair. “I don’t get it, though. I don’tget the reason for murders all over the world. He’s been trying to get his handson us since the beginning. He left that note for me, so he obviously knew wherewe were. He could have stormed the place and had us last night while we wereasleep. Why do this instead? What does he think this is going to accomplish?”“I’m afraid that he’s changed his tactics.” Jax glanced over at him. “He gaveyou that note to let you know that he knew the fake name the Daggett Society hadmade up to protect you. He wanted you to know that you can’t hide from him, thatthere is nowhere safe where he can’t find you.“He told you the places of the attacks so that you would know that he wasresponsible. He wanted you to know his reach.”Alex scanned the tourist traffic and dump trucks making their way along thecongested, narrow road through town, checking to make sure that none of themlooked imminently threatening.Alex heaved a sigh. “I guess you’re right. It was all an elaborate, bloody showjust for me. We’ve slipped through his fingers in the past, like back at Motherof Roses. This is retribution for being able to avoid him. He’s telling me thatif I don’t do as he wants, he can kill innocent people by the thousands.”“I’m afraid so. Those killers he sends don’t have to worry about being capturedand punished. They can kill innocent, helpless people while they have theadvantage, and then if it looks like someone might stop them, they can activatetheir lifeline and vanish in a heartbeat.”Alex shook his head in disgust. “But how can any human being do such things toinnocent people—to children?”“Their minds are poisoned by years of indoctrination. They believe what they’retold. They see it as doing good. I’m sure that when they get back, Radell Cainwill give them rewards for their bravery and great work in advancing theircause. They will feel only pride, not revulsion, for what they’ve done. Cainlikes giving awards for killing women and children because he knows that thatkind of thing strikes mindless fear into his enemies.”“Well, it’s working,” Alex said under his breath.They fell silent with brooding thoughts as they made their way down the street.The town of Westfield was a typical small New England tourist town. All theclapboard buildings were old, crooked, and crowded together. The two-lanehighway through the three-block-long center of town was slowed and backed up bytourists turning out of side streets and trying to find places to park. Smallbuildings had been converted to restaurants, gift shops, and art galleries. Onepicture window they hurried past had photos of houses and land for sale.Alex and Jax went into one of the wilderness outfitters to pick up what theymight need for hiking into the land and sleeping outside. Together they grimlywent about the business of equipping themselves.Jax knew exactly what was needed. Alex converted her list into what his worldhad to offer. When she said that they would probably need bedrolls, he showedher sleeping bags. They selected a small, compact tent for two that took up verylittle space strapped under a backpack. She was impressed with the quality andinnovation of the backpacks and other equipment and was able to minimize whatthey would need.All Alex could think about as they quickly went about selecting variousequipment was all the people who had died such horrific deaths that morning andall the traumatized survivors and all the lives that would be forever altered.Everyone in the shop was talking about the terror attacks. A number of peoplethought it was the work of Islamic fundamentalists, while two older women arguedthat warring drug cartels had been responsible.Everyone feared what it could mean. The mood was one of dread and expectancythat they were yet to see the true dimension of the coming shadow of acataclysm. Some people seemed to think such violence would soon swoop in tovisit even the little town of Westfield.Everyone feared what would happen next.Alex guessed that what happened next depended on him.After they left with their purchases, they stopped in a small market and boughtfood to pack in, then went to see if the truck was done. The service writer toldAlex that it was almost finished and suggested they wait in the lounge for a fewminutes. The TV was on in the lounge, carrying details of the killings. Alexdidn’t want to watch it. Besides, his mind was racing too fast for him to sitstill. He needed to walk.As they went outside, he spotted something hauntingly familiar in an art gallerydirectly across the street from the Jeep dealer. After two huge log trucksrumbled past, he took Jax by the hand and, in a break in the traffic, ran acrossthe street.On an easel, where it would show prominently through the front window of thegallery, was a large painting dominated by angry slashes of red paint. Itreminded Alex of a frenzied, bloody, murderous temper tantrum.He slowly approached the window, looking in at the painting on display as if itwere something threatening, something deadly. He stood frozen, staring at it. Herecognized the style.The precisely made signature on the painting was R. C. Dillion.“What is it?” Jax asked, frowning over at him.He couldn’t find his voice. It suddenly all made sense.“Alex . . .” Jax called after him, hurrying to catch up as he swept into thegallery. “What’s the matter?”Inside, Alex stopped in front of the painting. The random collection of redslashes dripped red paint down the face of the canvas.“What?” Jax said.Alex pulled out the piece of paper and handed it to her. “Look at thehandwriting on the paper. Don’t read the cities, just look at the handwriting.”She studied the list of cities for a moment, then looked up at him again. “Whatabout it?”“Look at the signature on this painting.”Jax squinted at the muddy-white, precisely done R. C. Dillion.“Dear spirits,” she whispered. “They’re the same hand.”“R. C. Dillion,” Alex said as he finally looked over at her. “R.C.—Radell Cain.He’s been right under my nose the whole time. He’s been there watching me,playing with me.”“Quite a stunning piece of work, isn’t it?” a woman in a tightly buttoned darkgray suit said as she came up to them, smiling, clasping her hands beforeherself.“You can’t imagine,” Alex said.“He’s an up-and-coming midwestern artist who is becoming a national figure atthe forefront of a new reality in art.”Alex recognized the words Mr. Martin, the gallery owner back home in Orden, hadused to describe R. C. Dillion. He wondered if R.C. himself had given them thatdescription.“A new reality,” Alex repeated in a flat tone. “Yes, so I’ve heard. How much?”She was a little taken aback that he so immediately demanded the price. Shefingered the small white collar folded over the suit at her throat as she ranfigures through her head.“It’s well worth—”“How much are you willing to sell it for? Cash. Right now.”The woman smiled. “R. C. Dillion has recently arrived in town for a little restand seclusion, he told me, and only just placed this with us. We’re honored heallowed us to offer one of his pieces. The price is twelve thousand dollars.”Doing his best to contain his rage, Alex pulled one of the fat envelopes stuffedwith cash from his pocket. He started counting out one-hundred-dollar bills asthe woman stood in mute shock to see him paying cash on the spot.It was the money from the settlement for the fire that had destroyed hisgrandfather’s house. Alex thought that Ben would have approved of what he wasdoing.When he had handed over the whole twelve thousand dollars, he asked, “Do youhave a black magic marker? The fat kind, with permanent ink?”A little confused, she half turned and gestured toward an old oak desk sittingbehind a furnace grate, back against the white plastered wall. “Why, yes, Ibelieve I have one like you’re talking about. It’s the kind of marker we use towrite signs for the window. Is that what you mean?”“Yes. May I borrow it, please?”The woman went to the desk and searched through a couple of drawers until shefound the marker. She returned, her heel strikes echoing off the warped, woodenfloor, and handed it over.Alex picked up the painting he now owned and in big letters across it wrote“R.C.—I will be at the gateway. Come and get me.” He signed it “Lord Rahl.”He handed the painting to the stunned woman. “Please give this to good old R.C.when he returns, will you? My treat.”The woman stood slack-jawed and speechless as Jax and Alex walked out."},{"pageContent":"55.AFTER LOCKING THE GATE, Alex walked back to the truck. Beyond all the officialsigns on the other side of the formidable gate warning people not to enter theproperty, it felt as if he were standing in the narthex leading into a grandcathedral. In the uncanny quiet he looked around at the gloomy shadows,searching for any eyes that might be watching back.The highway was too far away for them to hear any traffic, if there was any. Theremote road had been virtually deserted on the way up from Westfield. Once pasta few clusters of camps and some logging roads, they had seen only a few trucks.Standing in the silent, ancient forest, Alex felt as if he were in anotherworld.He could see by what lay ahead that the road into the property was hardly whathe was used to thinking of as a road. It looked like little more than a cutthough primordial woods. Here and there trees crowded in tight right up to theedge of the road. Out ahead lay an open chamber cast in the gloom beneath thebig pines. The thick overcast and mist only added to the sense of foreboding.Immense trunks of monarch trees rose up through the underlying regions of theforest where only muted light penetrated. It was as if there were two worlds:the open, lush vegetation on the forest floor, and the world of the toweringpines overhead. Nurseries of small, waist-high spruce huddled in clusters hereand there in the understory. Swaths of ferns nodded under falling drops of watercombed from the mist by the pine needles above. The ferns creating feathery bedsin places throughout the quiet forest floor lent an exotic, spicy aroma to theplace.Alex climbed back in the Jeep and shut the door. Jax carefully watched out theside windows for any signs of trouble.“Can I ask you a question, Alex?”He turned the key and the Jeep started without him holding his breath, for once.“Sure.”“When you wrote on that painting, why did you sign it ‘Lord Rahl’?”Alex shrugged as he eased the truck ahead into the woods. “I don’t know. Ithought it might rattle Cain, maybe distract him. For some reason it just feltlike the right thing to do. Why?”“I just wondered, that’s all.”“Does it bother you, because of what it meant in the past?”“No. I don’t care so much about what went on in the past. I care about what’shappening now and what’s going to happen.”“I know,” Alex said, thinking about all the helpless, innocent victims who haddied that day because of Radell Cain and his people.As they crawled along, moving ever deeper into the somber woods, Alex wonderedwhat Jax was brooding about. Since it didn’t seem like she was going to sayanything, he finally asked.“What’s going through your head, if you don’t mind my asking?”She stared out the side window for a time. She finally answered without lookingat him.“I was just weighing the worth of worlds.”Alex glanced over at her. “What does that mean?”“I came here for a reason. I came to fulfill prophecy, to save the innocentpeople in my world from the threat looming over them.”Alex shrugged. “Go on.”“I don’t know if I can do that anymore.”“What do you mean?”“A lot of people died today, Alex. What do you think I mean?”“You mean you’re thinking of quitting?”“I know what Radell Cain has planned next. I’ve seen him do things like thisbefore. He’s going to make you responsible for the deaths of innocent people ifyou refuse to help him. He’s going to force you to choose.”Alex stared ahead as he inched along the rocky ruts. He had considered suchquestions in the back of his mind. He hated to bring them to the front, to dwellon them, to contemplate having to make such a choice.As they drove on deeper into the woods, they eventually passed two side roadsthat were on the map that Hal Halverson had drawn for him. Those roadsessentially circled the entire property. The road he was on was the only onethat went deeper in toward what the people of the Daggett Society called thecrown jewel of the property: Castle Mountain.They had long since left the buffer property that he controlled through theDaggett Trust, and were now on the land that he had inherited. It seemed surrealto think that he actually owned everything he could see.Another hour and a half of tough going finally brought them to a circular spotthat had been cleared so that vehicles could turn around. Off to the left sidewas a brook that came from farther into the property. Beside the brook Alex sawa trailhead. He circled the Jeep around and parked.As he got out and shut the door, Alex noted that the brook rushing over rockscreated a lot of noise that would mask the sound of anyone who might be sneakingup. He scanned the woods before he lifted the tailgate so they could get theirgear out. The dark wooden box with the knife was sitting in the back, seeming towait for him.Underneath the velvet he found a black leather sheath trimmed in silver thatlooked just like the one Jax had. He threaded the sheath onto his belt, placingit on the left side behind the pouch holding two spare magazines. He had theother four spare magazines in an easily accessible pocket on the side of thebackpack. He had also packed a number of boxes of ammunition in the backpack.Ammo was heavy, but he wasn’t about to leave it behind.Ben always told him that you could never have enough guns or ammo. He wished nowthat he had taken the time to get another gun. He was thankful to at least haveone and to know that it was as dependable as a rock.Jax lifted the silver-handled knife out of the box. She pulled hers out to lookat them together. The one from the box still had her blood on it.Alex gestured at the weapons lying in her hands. “It’s mind-boggling to thinkthat those two knives haven’t been together for probably a thousand years ormore.”“That’s what I was thinking,” she said.When she handed him the knife, he started to wipe the blood off. Jax stoppedhim. “No, leave it.”Alex frowned at her. “Why?”“These blades were made to draw blood. It should have a taste to wake it fromits long sleep to its purpose.”Alex gazed into her resolute eyes for a moment, then slid the knife, stillstained with blood, into its sheath on his belt.He and Jax silently went about the task of getting their gear together. It wasalready early afternoon. Fixing the truck and the drive up had taken most of themorning. He knew that there was no way they would make it all the way in toCastle Mountain that day. They would have to set up a camp and make it the restof the way to their destination the next day.He supposed that Radell Cain, Sedrick Vendis, and Yuri the pirate could simplypop in at Alex’s destination without having to go through the effort of a longhike. He certainly had no doubt that they would show up.Alex was looking forward to finally meeting the visionary artist who wascreating a new reality. His blood boiled with rage in anticipation of meetinghim.Jax looked like she knew what she was doing with the camping gear. She got herpack together quickly and efficiently, then hoisted it up onto her back andbuckled the waist strap. Alex did the same. Their packs had collapsible watercontainers and they also had water bottles hooked on utility belts.As they left the Jeep and started into the woods the calls of birds echoedthrough the trees. Walking along side by side in the more open areas, theyshared a couple of packages of rolled-up meat and cheese. They had preservedfood, but the meat wouldn’t keep, so they ate it all as they made their waydeeper into the gloom.Farther in, the trail became less defined, but it wasn’t difficult to follow.The security people probably used the trail into the interior of the property,and over the time that the Daggett Trust had protected the land the trail hadbecome a reasonably well-defined route. Besides the roads, Hal had also markedsuch trails on the property. There weren’t a lot of them, but they providedaccess to just about any corner of the land. As he walked along, Alex could seethat there were deer trails that could probably be followed if need be.As the afternoon wore on, the land began rising. At first it was gentle slopes,but it soon began to get rocky and more difficult to climb. They were bothbreathing hard as they ascended a series of ridges, having to go down the backside of each one before going up again to get over the next.After the ridges, the trail took switchbacks up a steep area with a series ofcliffs. Each of the rock faces wasn’t all that high, but negotiating them wasdifficult, especially carrying all the gear they had. In some of the placesJax’s legs weren’t long enough and Alex had to lie on the upper trail and reachdown to help pull her up so that she wouldn’t have to take time to climb around.Other than that, he was having a hard time keeping up with her.As they went higher, the mist thickened. It felt cool on Alex’s sweaty face. Theland finally leveled a little. The trail wound its way up through trees withgnarled roots clinging to seams in areas of exposed granite ledge. Leaving theledges behind, they plunged back into thicker woods. Moss underfoot made it aquiet walk.“It won’t be long until dark,” Jax said back over her shoulder. “With the cloudcover there won’t be any moon or stars. It’s going to be a pitch-black night.Hiking in this kind of terrain after it gets dark is dangerous. You could walkoff a rock face, or break a leg in a hole. We’re going to have to think aboutsetting up camp pretty soon.”Alex sighed. He was weary from their pace, but he hated to have to stop. He hadwanted to get closer to their destination, but he knew that she had a lot moreexperience at this kind of thing and so he took her advice seriously.“How about if we keep pushing for just a little longer. We can always useflashlights to help us set up camp.”She agreed, but told him that it wouldn’t be long until it would be too dark topush on. Everything soon began losing its color, making the trees look gray.Darkness was falling quicker than he would have thought.And then they came out of the closed trail to a small opening in the woods thatfor the first time gave them a view into the distance. They halted together,surprised by the unexpected sight.Silhouetted against the fading gray sky while at the same time lit a little fromthe obscured sun setting to the left stood Castle Mountain, rising up beforethem from the undulating, rolling landscape.It didn’t really look at all like a castle to Alex. It looked more like aplateau rising up out of the surrounding forests. Its top wasn’t flat, though,instead looking somewhat crenellated with irregular rock outcroppings rising andfalling across the surface of the top.“Dear spirits,” Jax whispered.“What? What’s the matter?”“I don’t believe it.”“What don’t you believe?”“It looks very much like a place in my world called the People’s Palace.” Sheshook her head. “I can hardly believe what I’m seeing, but I guess, when I thinkabout it, I’ve somehow expected all along to see it.”“Sure doesn’t look much like a castle to me. What’s so special about thePeople’s Palace?”“It’s the place where our worlds were split apart. Up there, at least up therein my world, is a place called the Garden of Life. From there, at the end of along struggle, people were banished to this world. It only makes sense for thatto be the place of connection, the place where the gateway would be.”The enormity of such a concept gave Alex pause.She pointed. “Can you see that line rising up diagonally from the bottom lefttoward the top right?”Alex squinted into the gathering darkness. “Okay, I see it now.”“It looks like a narrow, angled ridge. In my world that’s a road up the plateauto the palace at the top.” She let out a sigh. “From here it’s probably a hikeof four hours to get there. We’d better look for a place to camp and get somesleep.”"},{"pageContent":"56.THE TRAIL SOON TOOK THEM BACK into the shelter of the woods. They found a placethat Jax liked for a camp because there was a rock overhang to protect them incase it started to rain. In the gloom they quickly set up their tent andunrolled the sleeping bags.“Tonight we should stand watches,” she told him as she used rocks to make a firering around an area she had quickly scraped clear of forest litter. “A firecould possibly be seen, but it’s more important that we can see them—and not dieof exposure.”Gathering wood nearby, he looked back over his shoulder. “You think that watchesare necessary?”“I hope not,” she said. “But being this close I wouldn’t want both of us to beasleep and have Yuri and his friends show up in the dark.”Alex built kindling up in the center of the fire ring and lit it with a match.He had been about to argue the point of a watch, but her words gave him pause.“All right. But only if you will take the gun on your watch.”She said she would. He handed her a foil pouch and a plastic spoon. In the darkhe wasn’t sure if he had pulled out meatloaf or roast pork. His was meatloaf.They ate in silence, listening to the coyotes in the distant mountains. It was aspooky sound to hear all alone so far out in the woods.When they were finished Jax said that if it was all right with him she wasreally tired and would rather sleep first and take her watch the second half ofthe night. Alex agreed. She found a comfortable place on a flat rock just out ofthe ring of light from the fire and told him that it was a good place to keephis eye on things without being blinded by the fire. She told him to make sureto keep wood on the fire.She rested her arms on his shoulders and clasped her fingers together behind hishead. “Come wake me when it’s my turn.”Before he knew it, she was kissing him. It was a lonely, desperate kind of kiss.It was wonderful only in the sense that they at least had each other. Heunderstood her emotion, and how it came out in the embrace. They were bothdispirited by the killing of innocent people earlier that day. The kiss wasn’tpassion so much as it was meant to be comfort.Alex helped her get into her sleeping bag, since she’d never seen one before.When she was settled in, he went to the rock and sat, resting his gun in hislap.The mist came and went, but at least it didn’t rain. He checked his watch everyonce in a while and waited longer than half the night to let her have a littleextra sleep.When he woke her, she put her arms around his neck and hugged him tight. It feltlike a fearful, lonely hug.He put more wood on the fire for her; then, when she sat on the rock, he put thegun in her lap. On the long drive from Nebraska to Maine he had explained how itworked in case she ever needed to use it. At night he had taught her to switchmagazines and clear a jam. She was familiar enough that he didn’t feel he neededto give her another lesson.Jax put her arms around his neck again and pulled him close. “Alex, you do knowhow much you mean to me, don’t you?”Alex smiled in the darkness. He pulled back to gaze at her face. Firelightsparkled in her beautiful brown eyes.He thought about that morning back at the motel in Westfield. He smiled toreassure her. “You made it quite clear.”“I would do anything for you. I hope you know that. You won’t ever doubt me,will you?”He smiled. “Never.”Her eyes brimmed with tears. She put her hands to each side of his face as shegazed into his eyes. “Alex . . . would you do anything for me?”He frowned a little. “What is it you want me to do?”“To say you love me.”Alex had wanted to say it a thousand times. He guessed he had always beenwaiting for the right time. That morning had been the right time. In his wholelife, nothing had made him happier than when he’d heard those same words fromher lips.“I love you, Jax Amnell.”“I love you, Alexander Rahl, defender of man.”She kissed him softly, then pulled back just a little.“Promise me,” she said as she looked at him from inches away, “promise me thatyou will never doubt that I love you, that you will never doubt that I willalways love you as long as I draw breath.”“Jax, are you all right?”“I will be if you promise me.”Alex ran a hand tenderly down her hair. “I promise—as long as you promise thesame.”“I do,” she whispered before kissing him again.She let out a reluctant sigh. “You had better get some sleep. It will be lightsooner than you think.”Alex lifted an eyebrow. “Now you want me to try to sleep? After that, you thinkI will be able to sleep?”She smiled a strangely sad smile and gave him a quick kiss. “Yes. You need tosleep. I want you to be strong tomorrow.”“For you, anything.”Alex crawled into his sleeping bag and tried to go to sleep. His heart seemed tobe beating too fast for him to ever be able to sleep. He could think of littleother than those precious words from her.Yet his mind started drifting to the dangers she faced. What with alternatingbetween fear and rage at those dangers, it was difficult to try to sleep, butsomewhere in that wild swing of emotions, as thoughts of her filled every partof him, he was so overcome with exhaustion that it carried him into a soundsleep.When he woke up, it was just getting light. He yawned, wondering why Jax hadn’twoken him up sooner.As he turned, he saw the gun lying not far from his head.Alex sat up in a rush, staring at the gun, trying to make sense of it.“Jax?” he called out from the tent as he picked up the gun.She didn’t answer. She should have been close enough to hear him.He untangled himself from the sleeping bag and raced out of the small tent.The fire was dead.Jax was gone."},{"pageContent":"57.ALEX FRANTICALLY SEARCHED AROUND THE CAMPSITE, hoping against hope that he waswrong and that Jax was actually close at hand. He screamed her name as helooked. Panting in panic, he realized that he wasn’t mistaken. She was gone.He searched the site, looking for the footprints of intruders. He didn’t seeany. At the trail, he found a partial print left by her boot. It was headed inthe direction of the mountain.With a sinking feeling of icy dread, Alex knew what she had done, and why.He snatched up his pack and threw it on. He left the tent and the gear they hadgotten out. He took time only to grab the water bottles. Her pack was leaned upagainst the rock where she had been sitting. He left it and took off up thetrail.Before he had gone far, a man suddenly appeared directly in front of him in thetrail. He was big, perhaps in his early twenties. He looked like he belonged ina biker gang. His matted brown hair didn’t appear to have ever seen a brush.Alex froze. The man grinned wickedly.“Radell Cain has a message for you,” the man said in a deep, gravelly voice.“I have a message for him,” Alex said as he drew his gun.He put a bullet in the center of the man’s chest.Birds took to wing at the resounding bang.With a look of stunned shock on his face, the man crumpled to the ground,groaning. The sound of the single gunshot echoed through the woods to reflectback from the mountain up ahead.Ben had taught him to quickly fire two or three rounds into the center mass of athreat, and if warranted, more. The man was seriously wounded. There would be nohelp for him out in the middle of such remote woods. The only thing that wouldfind him would be the coyotes. Alex had a limited supply of ammunition; hewasn’t going to waste any on a man who clearly wasn’t going to present furtherthreat or last long.He stepped over the gasping, dying man and hurried up the trail.As the morning wore on, Alex only pressed on harder. Instead of climbing downand then up to cross small gullies, he bounded across. Instead of climbing downshort drops, he jumped down. He knew that he had to be careful or he could breakan ankle and then he would be helpless, but he couldn’t make himself slow down.He knew that he was in a race to stop Jax before it was too late.He kept thinking of her asking him to promise that he would never doubt that aslong as she drew breath she would always love him. He felt a lump rising in histhroat as he ran. The limbs and brush he flew past turned to a watery blur.He was furious at himself for not catching on to the things she’d said. He’dthought that it was because she was upset at hearing about all the deaths thatmorning. He should have known it was more. Having been sleepy was no excuse.Excuses couldn’t undo it if he lost her.A few hours of grueling effort brought him to the base of the plateau that roseup out of the forest. Catching his breath, he looked up the rugged series ofcliffs toward the top. Squinting into the iron gray light, he couldn’t seeanything beyond the edge other than the wispy limbs of trees.Jax had said that the ascending rift in the rock was in her world a road up theside of the cliff to the top. While not a road, the trail led to the craggy edgeof rock that looked like a natural formation, yet went up along the face of thecliff at a steep angle. It looked like it might go all the way to the top. If itdidn’t, if the lip of rock ended, he was going to find himself awfully high upwith nowhere to go.Alex couldn’t see that he had a choice and so he didn’t give it a whole lot ofthought. He simply started climbing.There were places along the way that at first looked impassable. In each case,though, he quickly found a way to pass. In other spots he had to climb over gapsin the narrow outcropping, but along much of the sloping, weathered rock ledgeit widened to several feet, and in spots at least six or seven feet, where itpresented no trouble at all, except that it sapped his strength to climb so fastat such a steep angle. His thigh muscles burned from the effort. He panted forair as he pressed on, refusing to slow for anything.In a little more than an hour, he was getting near the top. As he came around aprotruding rock face, two burly men were waiting. Alex took a hurried step back,at the same time drawing his gun. Without hesitation he fired at the closest mancharging toward him. The bullet must have gone through his heart, because theman faltered and dropped.The second man put a boot on the downed man and leaped over him, diving towardAlex. Alex pressed the trigger twice in rapid succession. He didn’t know if hisbullets found their mark or not, because the man was still crashing in on him.As the man’s arm came out to tackle him, Alex dodged aside, seized the man’shair, and used his forward momentum to help heave him out over the edge. The manstumbled, trying to stop, but he was moving too fast. He screamed all the waydown.Gun held in both hands, Alex pressed his back against the rock wall, catchinghis breath. He looked out over the edge and went weak in the knees at how closehe had been to going over the side with the assailant.The man on the ground wasn’t moving. Alex didn’t like the idea of not having thegun fully loaded as he went into an unknown but definitely hostile situation, sohe quickly pulled a box of ammo out of his backpack. With his thumb he forcedfour more shells into the magazine, filling it to capacity. Seventeen rounds inthe magazine plus one in the chamber gave him eighteen rounds in the gun plusthe rest of the loaded magazines if he needed to reload in a hurry.While eighteen rounds sounded like a lot, he knew that if there were enough mencoming at him even that many shells wouldn’t last long. He didn’t know whatchoice he had.Gathering his wits, he hurried the rest of the way up the trail to the top,where it flattened off considerably. Even so, it wasn’t exactly flat. Beyond anexpanse of forest, jumbles of rock rose up to make the top of the massiveplateau a series of rocky layers.While from a distance it might have looked flat on top, up close the stacks ofledge, the sheer granite faces, and the squared-off breaks in the stone had ahauntingly man-made look to them, even though the plateau was obviously entirelynatural. A person with a good imagination could make more out of it than layersof rock. With some imagination it looked almost like an extensive, complexstructure.Now that he had made the top, Alex wasn’t sure what to do. He searched aroundthe area where the sloping rock ledge had emerged on top, but there was noman-made trail. While the trail below was used by the security force to get tothe mountain, they apparently rarely or never climbed to the top. It didn’t lookto him like anyone had ever walked across the delicate pale lichen and deepgreen mosses.He finally decided to follow the exposed ledge that created a natural trailthrough the woods. In one low, damp place, he spotted Jax’s boot print. Deeperin, he came to a curious depression leading into the rock jumble.Before going into the narrow chasm, he pulled a box of ammo and four magazinesfrom his pack. He put the box of ammo in the front pocket of his jeans and thespare magazines in his back pockets. As he moved into the tight opening in therock, he found that it wound into gorges that eventually rose perhaps a hundredfeet in places.The natural trail through the rock led him into a narrow cleft. High above, hecould see that the smooth sides revealed only a long slash of leaden sky. Alexwent in deeper. The rock overhead that must have once stood taller yet hadtoppled over in the distant past, possibly during earthquakes, so that it nowlay across the cleft and acted as a roof. The deeper Alex went, the gloomier itbecame.The farther in he went, the more the jumbled, weathered rock turned into a darklabyrinth. Alex stuck a hand into his pack, searching blindly for a flashlight.He found it and pulled it out.When he switched on the light and pointed it ahead, a man was standing in thenarrow passageway through the rock. Alex went for his gun.“If you want to see her alive, you need to follow me.”Looking at the man through the iron gunsights, one eye over each of the twoouter dots and the center blade of the front sight rock-steady over the bridgeof the man’s nose, Alex hesitated.But for only an instant.He pressed the trigger. The gunshot inside the confines of the rock passagewaywas deafening.“I don’t negotiate with murderers,” Alex said under his breath as he steppedover the corpse and made his way deeper into the maze of rocky crags.“Seventeen left,” he counted to himself as he hurriedly followed what wasbecoming like a cave running deeper into the mountain. With his flashlight hehad to check that each side branch he came to was clear. He stuck to what seemedthe main crevice running through the mountain. In places the huge slabs ofgranite had shifted over millennia or even tipped and fallen, leaving many spotsa tight squeeze to get through. In other places he had to climb over rubble fromwhen the rock overhead had collapsed.Alex didn’t know how long he had been running when he realized that up ahead hesaw natural light. As he continued on, the light grew steadily brighter.When he rounded a slight bend in the fissure through the mountain, he spottedsomething out ahead in that area of light. He rushed ahead, trying to make itout.His heart came up in his throat.It was Jax."},{"pageContent":"58.ALEX COULD SEE JAX STANDING in the middle of a broad area of white sand. Theplace looked to have once been a cavernous dome but the center of the roofseemed to have eroded away and partially collapsed over time to leave a roomthat was open to the sky. Here and there boulders that looked possibly to haveonce been part of that domed ceiling sat littering the room.Jax, standing in the center of the sand under that opening, watched him come. Hecould tell that her hands were tied behind her back. Tears stained her face. Atrickle of blood ran from the corner of her mouth.With his gun held in both hands and at the ready, Alex inched into the openarea. As he emerged from the passageway through the rock, hundreds of men cameinto view. They stood silently around the outside near the walls or in othercaves and cracks leading into the room. They were all watching him. None made amove.They were dressed in clothes that would be familiar anywhere—mostly jeans andoversized T-shirts with words on them. A number of them wore baggy, knee-lengthshorts and sandals, just like a typical guy at the mall or out getting a pizza.Alex spotted what looked like knives under the shirts of some. He was sure thatall of them had weapons concealed somewhere on them.Despite their ordinary dress, they weren’t especially well groomed, with rattyhair and scraggly beards or stubble. Alex supposed that even that wasn’t too outof place anymore with their everyday outfits. They all had hard eyes and woregrim expressions. They looked like thugs. That, too, was a rather conventionallook that seemed to be cultivated by many men and had become accepted.Walking down the street these men wouldn’t warrant a second look from mostpeople. Any one of them, carrying a knapsack, could walk unnoticed through anyairport. Seeing them gathered all together as they were, though, on a remotewilderness mountaintop, looked bizarre in the extreme, as if they had all beentransported there from the bleachers of a basketball game.Alex knew that they were chameleons, killers intended to fit in and beunseen—until they struck. That, in itself, was what was so frightening aboutthem. They would be invisible out among innocent people.A glance back showed that the way he had come in was now blocked by dozens moremen just like them.“Alex,” Jax said in a shaky voice, “give them your gun.”“No.”“Please . . .”“I’m not—”“You can’t hope to change things,” she said. “Don’t make it any more difficultthan it already is. Please?”The audience of killers all silently watched. Alex knew that even if he hit histarget with every round, and he managed to reload with every one of his sparemagazines, he wouldn’t have enough bullets to take out all the men gathered.When he ran out of ammo, they would have him. But he knew that in reality itwould never come to that. They would all simply rush him at the same time.They’d be on him before he could empty the magazine in his gun.“Talk to me, Jax. What’s going on?”“Give them your gun, or they’ll just hurt me until you do, or take it away fromyou after you run out of bullets.”As if to demonstrate, one of the men heaved a fist-sized rock. It struck Jax inthe back of the shoulder. She cried out as she went to a knee, bent by the painof the blow.Alex put two rounds into the man, dropping him almost instantly. None of theother men so much as flinched at the loud sound or the flash.Dozens of other men all around the cavernous room lifted rocks to show him thathe had no chance to change the outcome. Jax staggered back to her feet. If allof those men threw those rocks she would be stoned to death before he could doanything effective to stop them. Alex’s vision was red with rage. He wanted tostrike out at all of them.But he knew that doing so would only get Jax hurt.Violating a rule that had been drilled into him from the first time he hadlearned to shoot, he squatted down, laid the gun on the ground, and slid itacross the granite toward Jax. It stopped right before the area of sand.Ben had always told him that you never give up your gun. But a gun was merely atool of self-defense. If it couldn’t defend him, or protect Jax, then it ceasedto be a tool and became nothing more than a useless hunk of metal.Alex was enraged that he had no choice but to give up the weapon.He was ashamed of himself for not thinking of something to keep it from comingto that.He reminded himself that it wasn’t over yet. He might have had to give up hisgun, but he wouldn’t quit as long as he had breath in his lungs.Sedrick Vendis stepped out from behind some of the men in a dark cave opening tothe left and walked out to retrieve the weapon. He picked it up and stuck it inhis waistband.“That’s better, Alex,” he said with a smirk. “Sorry I missed the show at thehospital. I hear it was quite the event.”Alex ignored him. “Jax—what’s going on?”“I’m saving your world,” she said in a voice choked with emotion.Alex had thought as much.He strode to the edge of the sand, close to her. Sedrick Vendis casually backedup a few steps to stay out of his immediate reach. Somewhere inside it pleasedAlex that, even alone and without a gun, surrounded by hundreds of men, theyconsidered him dangerous.He intended to prove their fears warranted.To Alex’s left, another man stepped out from the darkness beyond the menwatching. He was tall, with slicked-back blond hair and thick features. He woredark slacks and a simple white pullover shirt with short sleeves and an opencollar. He looked like he might be about to go out for a game of golf. He wasmaybe forty, but looked to be in good shape, as though he could take care ofhimself if he had to.If Alex had his way, he was going to have to.As he approached, the man’s piercing blue eyes never strayed from Alex. Hestopped ten feet away, smiling at Alex in a knowing manner.“How nice to meet you at last, Lord Rahl.”He emphasized the title in a way obviously intended to mock Alex for havingwritten it on the painting.Alex was pleased to know that the title had hit a sore spot. “Get to the point.”“Ah, the direct approach.” He shrugged. “Very well.”Alex was distracted by another man coming out from the shadows to stand not farfrom Jax. It was Yuri. The pirate was still wearing the same dirty clothes and agrin that showed his yellow teeth.“I’m Radell Cain,” the tall man said, drawing Alex’s attention back. He swept anarm out, indicating the area where Jax stood. “This is the gateway, in case youhadn’t guessed.” He crooked his fingers. “Come, have a look if you would be sokind.”As Alex followed the man, Jax’s eyes tracked him the whole way. He stopped whereindicated, at one of the boulders sitting before the area of sand. The flat topof the rock, several feet square, was angled toward him. It was smooth althoughsomewhat weathered-looking, as if it had sat in that spot exposed to theelements for a thousand years.Alex was startled to see that it had what looked to be a petroglyph drawn on theflat area of the light-colored granite. The darkish lines had a reddish cast tothem. It almost looked like it might have been done with blood.Alex was even more shocked to see what that drawing was. It was a simple sceneof a forest, composed of ten trees, much like the scenes Alex liked to paint.Below the drawing was a small slot in the stone.Alex was beginning to understand.“Rather like one of your quaint little paintings,” Cain said, smiling withoutamusement as he gestured dismissively at the drawing on the stone.“What do you mean?”Cain shrugged. “Rather outmoded, passé—as opposed to the new reality my visionis ushering in.”“If you have invited me here to discuss art, I’m afraid that you aren’tqualified to speak on the subject.”“No, I don’t care what you know about art, I only care about what you know aboutthe gateway.”Alex shrugged. “Not much.”Cain’s humorless smile returned. “Well, since you wanted me to get to the point,here it is. I want this gateway functioning, and I want it functioning rightnow. I’ve followed your family long enough, waiting for the right time to come.With you, it finally has. The Law of Nines is now fulfilled. I’m throughwaiting.“Yesterday I gave you a small sampling of what I can do if I need to. If youdon’t cooperate, I’m going to rain death and destruction down on this world thelikes of which you can’t imagine. Yesterday, where I killed one, tomorrow I willkill thousands. I can send men into schools, shopping centers, hotels,restaurants, workplaces, sporting events, and . . . well, I think you get theidea.”He swept his arm around as if introducing the hundreds of men watching. “Theseare but a few of my legions that I will send into the most secure, secludedplaces you can imagine. Do you know that we have the ability to show up in, say,the bedroom of your president? The bedroom of every world leader? We caneviscerate your leaders, your police commanders, your army generals. Why, I havean entire staff of people who have nothing better to do than think up ways inwhich to kill the unsuspecting people of your world.“If I want, I could even set nations against each other and launch your worldinto war. I could have my legions carry out the most brutal attacks to partiallybring down the ruling government of Israel, for example, and goad them intolaunching a nuclear attack against surrounding nations. If I want, I can lightthe fuse that will ignite a holocaust.”“Alex,” Jax said, “listen to him. He’s not bluffing. He will kill innocentpeople in the thousands.”Cain turned to her. “Don’t be insulting. I will kill the people here in the tensof thousands—the hundreds of thousands—if I have to.”Alex felt dizzy. He knew that Jax was right, that Cain wasn’t bluffing.As if to prove his point, Cain looked around at all the men watching. “If LordRahl, here, does not give me what I want, you will all receive my order to carryout the instructions you have already been given.”The men all bowed their heads.“I’m not giving you what you want,” Alex said.Cain turned a cold glare on him. “Then the killing will continue until you do.If I have to reduce this world to a sea of blood, I will.”“Alex,” Jax said, drawing his attention again. “Please, do as he asks. You alonehold sway over all those innocent lives. You alone can prevent this fromhappening to your world.”Alex stepped out onto the sand, closer to her. “Why would you turn yourself overto him? Why are you doing this?”“Because I know that as long as I’m free you would never give up. As long as I’mfree you would fight no matter what. I can’t let you put your love for me aboveall the people who will die if you keep fighting him. I had to remove myselffrom the equation.“To let this happen, to let him unleash his wrath on your world while I stand byand watch, is a violation of all that I value and believe in—of everything I’vebeen fighting to preserve. I couldn’t let your world pay the price for thepeople in my world.“We are lost. Our war is done. Don’t let it come down on your world, too.Please, Alex, do what he says. Don’t let any more people here die needlessly.“There is nothing you can do for me now. I am lost. Let me go. Only you can dosomething to save all the people in your world who will otherwise die. Please,Alex, don’t allow the sacrifice of my life to stand for nothing. Do as he wantsand think of your own people now.”“Yet more outdated moral drivel,” Cain said in a contemptuous tone. “Hardly thekind of strength exhibited by the strong, by true visionary leaders. No wonderyou’re losing.” He turned to Alex. “Still, you should listen to her, if for noother reason than because you are just as weak as she is and you will want tospare the people in your world all the pain and suffering I will unleash onthem.”Alex looked away from the venomous glare of Radell Cain, back into the eyes ofthe woman he loved more than life itself.“These people are from my world,” she said softly. “We must suffer them. Youmust not let this place suffer them as well. That is your highestresponsibility. I gave myself up because if I didn’t my life would be lived atthe cost of the lives of thousands of innocent people. I can’t live with that.”“I don’t negotiate with murderers,” Alex said.“You aren’t negotiating,” she whispered, “you are making a choice. You can’t winby wishing it was other than it is. This is what is before us. We have to chooseor the choice will be made for us and others here will suffer because of it.”“You should listen to her, Alex,” Cain said. “She’s a smart lady. That’s why Ican’t allow her to run free.”Alex swallowed at the lump in his throat. He could think of no argument thatcould change things. He had nothing to fight with. If he held out, then all thesuffering and death that Cain promised would come to pass.“Let her go first.”Cain heaved an irritated sigh. “I grow weary of this.” He turned to the menwatching. “You all have your assignments. Go, now, and await my orders. If youget my command, then you will unleash war on these people tomorrow. If hecooperates by tonight, and you don’t receive orders from me to attack, thenreturn home at once to prepare for the transition to the new reality in our ownworld, where we must be ready to rule.”Men all around clapped fists to hearts in salute. In so doing they also vanishedalmost all at the same time. Where hundreds had stood, there was only darknessand stone. Only a few dozen men remained behind.Radell Cain turned back to Alex. “They will be in place by tonight, out amongthe people of your world—death stalking among the unaware and unprepared. If youdon’t open the gateway for me, then by morning I will give them the order tostart killing on a scale you can’t imagine.“What’s more,” he said with a growing smile, “I will hand Jax over to Yuri to dowith as he will. If you cooperate, I will instead have her beheaded—put to deathquickly. If not . . .” He shrugged.Yuri pulled out a knife, displaying it for Alex. It was Jax’s silver-handledknife. “Don’t you worry, my men and I will keep her alive for a good long time.When we finally tire of her feminine charms, then I’ll start in cutting on her.”Jax closed her eyes at the terror awaiting her.Alex knew that he’d run out of options, and time.He gazed into her beautiful, sad eyes as they opened. In those forlorn eyes hecould see his world ending.“You know, don’t you? I can see it in your eyes,” she whispered to him. “Youfigured it out, didn’t you?”He nodded.“Then don’t let me down, Alexander. The time has come to defend mankind, here,in your world. Open the gateway for him.”“All right,” he whispered back to her, “I’ll do it.”"},{"pageContent":"59.ALEX GESTURED TO JAX to move off the area of sand. Yuri seized her arm androughly pulled her back against the stone wall. Alex went out onto the whitesand and with his arm smoothed the footprints out, leveling the sand. He begandrawing the symbols that he had learned from Jax to activate a lifeline, only ona large scale. He needed to buy a little time to think things through, to puttogether all the things Jax had told him, and the things the Daggett Society hadtold him about what the book said. He made a job of carefully laying out thedesigns as he put all the pieces together in his head.“That’s not going to open the gateway,” Sedrick Vendis snapped.Alex looked up at the man. “Since you seem to know so much, why don’t you tellyour boss how it’s done?”Vendis glowered but finally folded his arms and fell silent.When he finished drawing, Alex stood and faced Cain. “I will have to trust thatyou will keep your word she won’t suffer at the end.”Cain’s smile was bone-chillingly evil. “I’m nothing if not a man of my word.”“Since this is the end for Jax and me, I want to tell her a few private words ofgood-bye before I finish this for you. I want to have a moment alone with her.Then I will open your gateway for you. If you won’t grant me that simple humandecency, then I may not believe that you’re an understanding man who will keephis word about granting her a swift death.”Alex gave the man an iron look. “I may have second thoughts.”Cain glared for a moment. He finally held out his hand. “The knife first.”Alex pulled the silver-handled knife out of the sheath behind the two magazineson the left side of his belt. He held it by the blade still stained with Jax’sblood and placed the handle with the House of Rahl symbol in the man’s hand.Cain looked down at the knife in his hand as Alex stood with his own hands inhis pockets, waiting.Cain finally gestured with the knife. “All right, if it will end this patheticemotional drama, go ahead.”“Alone,” Alex reminded him.“Leave them be, Yuri.”The greasy pirate moved away to stand beside Sedrick Vendis as the three of themwatched Alex go up to where Jax, her hands tied behind her back, stood all byherself against the stone wall. She looked forlorn and resigned.Vendis asked Cain something in a whisper. The men leaned in, discussing it amongthemselves as Alex stepped up close to Jax. Her chin trembled as she finallylooked up at him.“I’m so sorry, Alex.”As he put his arms around her she put her face against his shoulder and startedto cry.“Don’t be sorry, Jax,” he whispered, “be strong.”Alex placed his open pocketknife that he had palmed into her hands behind herback.She went still when she realized what it was.“The blade is razor-sharp,” he whispered into her ear. “Be careful when you cutthe ropes. Keep your hands together as if they’re still tied and wait. You’llknow when.”“Alex—”“Jax, I’d rather die trying than let them have what they want. You can’t bargainwith evil. You can’t appease it. You can’t compromise with it.“Giving in to them will only lead to endless suffering and death in the longrun. How long until they return here deciding they want more from this world andstart to kill again to get it? I have to try to stop it now. You’re the one whocame here to stop this evil. You came here to do a job. It’s not finished. Areyou with me? Are you willing to try?”He knew what he was asking of her. Yuri stood not far away leering hungrily ather. They both knew the consequences if they failed, not merely for her, but foreveryone.She nodded against him, putting on a show for the men watching. “You’re right.If we have any chance, we have to take it. I was so afraid for the people ofyour world, so afraid that I had come for your help only to end up causing harm,that I forgot who I was for a time. Dear spirits, can you ever forgive me forbeing so weak?”He reached up and held her tight, smoothing her hair as he held her head to him.“That’s the Jax I love. You’re anything but weak. You’re the strongest person Iknow. In case this doesn’t work, just know that I love you more than anything.”“You are a devious man, Alexander Rahl.” She kissed his neck. “I love youanyway.”“I learned it from you.”“Enough,” Cain growled.Alex kissed her quickly, then turned to his task."},{"pageContent":"60.ALEX HELD HIS HAND OUT. “I need the knife.”Radell Cain’s eyes narrowed. “Why?”“To open the gateway.”“And how is the knife going to do that?”“Opening the gateway requires the person named by the Law of Nines. Right?”Cain studied his face for a moment. “Go on.”Alex spread his hands. “So how the hell is the gateway supposed to know it’s me,know I’m the one named by the Law of Nines? Do you think that because it’s me Ican simply say ‘Open sesame’ and the gateway will recognize me as the one andopen? There is no magic in this world, so how is the gateway to know that I’mthe one that is able to open it?”“I give up, how?” Cain asked with clear distaste for the game Alex was playing.“Blood.”“Blood?”“Yes. It needs my blood to recognize that I’m the one who is able to open it.”“Well,” Cain said, “now you have my interest.”He handed the silver knife kept by the Daggett Society for a thousand years backto Alex, the one named by the Law of Nines as the only person who could open thegateway.Alex drew the weapon across his forearm. As dull as it was, he was still able tocut himself enough to bleed liberally. In the back of his mind, Alex realizedthat the cut on his left forearm was very much the same place, direction, andlength as the cut on Jax’s forearm from when the man who had infiltrated theDaggett Trust had attacked her.Alex wiped the blade in the blood running down his arm. The cut stung, but hewas already lost in his own world, in what he had to do. He turned the blade andwiped the other side until both sides of the steel were red and blood drippedfrom the tip.Radell Cain seemed to be quite caught up in the ritual to open the gateway.Alex went to the rock that had the flat spot with the petroglyph. He held theknife over the rock, slanting it down just a little. He let a few drops of blooddrip off the tip into the slot.With a thud to the air all around, a faint glow of light ignited over the sand.Men watching oohed at the strange, charged feeling to the air and the light fromnowhere shining before them. It was beautiful, entrancing, inviting.“All right, I need some people to send through the gateway.”“What for?” Cain asked with an angry frown.“It doesn’t just open,” Alex insisted. “You can’t load cargo on the sand in thecenter and transport it. It needs people to work. It’s people that are the coreof its function, so the gateway needs people to open.The more people the better it works—the wider the gateway opens to accommodatethem. In that way, the more things—the more supplies and cargo—the gateway willsupport going through it.”Radell Cain thought it over. He seemed to understand that it made sense.Everyone else stood staring in amazement at the slowly twisting shaft of lighthovering over the sand before them.“Well?” Alex asked. “You wanted the gateway opened. It’s opened. But to make itactually work, we need to send people through it.”Radell Cain, finally grinning in triumph, gestured some of his men forward.“Come on, then. Let’s have some of you go tell them that we’ve succeeded.”Half a dozen men rushed forward. Alex was surprised that they seemed so eager.He guessed that in their world they were used to such things and accepted them.The men gathered out on the area of sand. They held their hands out as ifshowering in the light. By their reaction it appeared to tingle pleasantly. Theyall looked up into the sky as if looking up into the source of the warm light.Like kids about to go on an amusement-park ride, they all wore big grins.Radell Cain stepped forward to the edge of the granite before the sand,fascinated by the light show and the way it began to sparkle with the presenceof the men. Sedrick Vendis as well stepped up to get a closer look.“All right,” Cain said to Alex, gesturing with an arm as if urging him tolevitate the men, “go on, open it fully. Do it.”Alex held the knife in his fist above the slot. “Ready?” he asked the men in thelight.They were all grins and nods.Alex shoved the blade charged with his blood into the slot.In an instant, the men were drawn upward without their feet leaving the sand,elongating them into columns of flesh ripping apart into an explosion of bloodand gore that shot skyward. They never had time to scream, but the sound oftheir bone and muscle coming apart was horrific enough.All the men watching stood frozen in shock.In that instant in time when none of them moved, Alex and Jax did.Jax spun. The pocketknife in her fist scythed diagonally across Yuri’s face,laying it open. As he bent back from the slicing blow, she kicked him in thegroin. As he doubled over forward, she pulled her knife from his belt, reachedunder, and cut his throat open.Alex yanked the knife out of the stone and went for Cain.The men all descended out of the sides where they had been watching to defendagainst the sudden attack. Cain backed a few steps as he pulled out his ownknife.Jax was a whirlwind. Her blade cut into the men as they charged in. Several diedbefore they had even drawn their own knives.Alex dove to the side when he saw Sedrick Vendis draw the gun that he had in hiswaistband. Vendis started shooting. By the way he handled the gun, Alex couldtell that he didn’t have any experience. But if he got hit, Alex knew thatwouldn’t be any consolation. Bullets ricocheted off rock and splattered againstthe far wall. Even Cain had to dodge to keep from being accidentally shot.Vendis turned the gun on Jax, firing wildly in a panic. Jax dodged and duckedpast men, using them as shields. Several of the men were hit, but the bulletsmissed Jax.Alex dove in past Cain’s own knife, coming up and ripping his leg open. Cainfell back with a cry of surprise, pain, and rage. Vendis turned the gun on Alexto protect Cain. He fired wildly, and again Alex had to dive away to keep fromgetting hit.When the gun went empty the slide locked back. When pulling the trigger nolonger did any good, Vendis looked at the gun briefly and then tried pulling thetrigger again. When the empty gun still wouldn’t fire, he growled in anger andthrew it at Alex.Alex caught the weapon as it flew at him. With his thumb he pressed the releasebehind the trigger and dropped the empty magazine. He shoved a loaded magazinehome. When the slide slammed forward it stripped the top round off the magazineand chambered the round, loading the gun.Vendis was coming for him with a knife. Alex fired two rounds into the man’schest and then put one in his head.Alex looked up and saw that Jax had just caught Cain before he could get hisbalance. Men were racing in from every direction to protect Radell Cain. Alexstarted firing, taking them out as fast as he could before they could get toJax.He could see out of the corner of his eye that she wasn’t paying any attentionto the men trying to get to her. She was lost in a rage of her own, hacking awayat Radell Cain. The two of them were covered in blood.One of the men charged at Alex just as his gun ran out of ammo. As the manlifted his knife to stab at Alex, Alex slammed his foot into the center of theman’s chest. The man fell back. Alex pressed the release, dropping the emptymagazine, and rammed a full one home.He fired a round into the man as he was scrambling to his feet, then swiveledand fired once at a man to his left. He immediately turned and fired at two mengoing for Jax. The first one dropped, the second spun around once but keptgoing. Alex, his heart hammering, planted the sights on the man and pressed thetrigger. It ended the charge.He looked around but saw no more men coming for them. He stood panting in astate of wide-eyed shock. It had seemed like it had lasted an hour, but he knewthat it had probably been little more than seconds.Jax was still slamming her knife wildly into Cain’s bloody corpse. Tears randown her face as she furiously stabbed the dead man.“Jax. Jax. It’s over.”She lifted her arm again but stopped with it raised, her silver-handled knifeheld tightly in her fist, her teeth gritted with determination, blood splatteredacross her face and through her hair, tears running down as she gasped in fury.“Jax . . . it’s over.”She stared at him a moment, almost as if she didn’t recognize him; then her facesoftened as she fell sobbing into his arms.“We did it,” she cried. “We killed the bastard. I can’t believe that after allthis time, after everything he’s done, after all the people who have died, afterhow long we have worked, we finally killed the bastard.”“You killed him,” Alex corrected softly.“I killed him,” she wept. “I killed the monster. I did it.”She finally pushed back to look at him as her sobs turned to tears of joy.“You’re a bloody mess,” she said, half laughing.“You should see yourself in a mirror,” he said with a smile.Jax hugged him as if she feared he would float away."},{"pageContent":"61.AFTER RATIME , she finally allowed herself to part from him.“I don’t get it, though,” Alex said. “Why didn’t they activate their lifelinesand escape?”“A few of the men did—the ones back out of the way. Vendis and Cain feared totry.”“Why would they fear to try to vanish and escape?”“It’s not as simple as you make it sound. It takes a moment of concentration todo it. It’s not long, but for an instant when they would be doing it they wouldbe totally defenseless and vulnerable. They obviously feared to stand therenaked to our blades and bullets for that instant for fear we would have hadthem. They’re also used to being in control and killing others at will. They hadconfidence that with their numbers they could get control of the situation.”Alex sighed. “They were wrong. They underestimated you.” “They underestimatedboth of us,” she said, “but they especially underestimated a person from thisworld without their abilities.” She laid a hand on his chest. “I made the samemistake.”“You did what you had to do. You were fighting for life.” Alex smiled as hetouched her face. “I love you and you’re safe. That’s all that matters to me.”Jax looked around at the carnage. “We need to send them back. We need to leteveryone know that Cain and Vendis are dead.”“If you activate their lifeline won’t their bodies go back to their people, totheir side?”She nodded as she wiped her nose on her sleeve.“What about the Garden of Life in your world?” Alex asked. “Who controls thatplace at the other side of the gateway?”She looked up at him suddenly. “We do.”“So if we send them through the gateway, they will go to your side instead. Theneveryone on your side will know of the victory won here today.”She blinked. “Well, that would be wonderful, but . . . you mean you can reallymake the gateway work? For real?”Alex smiled. “Of course. Isn’t that why you came here? All that Law of Ninesbusiness?”“Yes, but . . . I don’t understand.”“I did what was needed to open the gateway, but I only did part of what isnecessary to make it work properly. I think it has a fail-safe.”“How would you know about that?”“About what?”“A fail-safe. Things of magic, things that are dangerous, usually have afail-safe. Radell Cain thought that the fail-safe was your blood, the blood ofthe one named by the Law of Nines. But sometimes a more subtle fail-safe isintegrated into dangerous things so that only the right person can use it.”“Well, this fail-safe is pretty simple, but I guess that sometimes simple thingsare the best.”Alex took her hand and led her to the stone where he had put the knife toactivate the gateway. She slipped her arm around his waist.“Look here,” he said.She frowned as she looked down at it. “It’s a drawing of trees. It’s kind oflike the picture you gave me. It’s something like the Shineestay place youpainted.” She trailed her fingers across the drawing. “Except that this one hasall the trees.”“And how many trees does it have?”Jax touched the trees as she counted. “Ten.”“And if I’m the one named by the Law of Nines, how many do you suppose it oughtto have?”She puzzled up at him. “It should have nine. It has one too many.”Alex nodded. “For the gateway to work, for the one named by the Law of Nines toactivate it, for his blood to work, for it all to ring true to the fail-safe,one of the trees has to be removed, just like I removed one in that painting Igave you.”Jax was frowning in earnest. “How are you supposed to know which one to remove?”“Easy. You take out the one that doesn’t fit the composition.” Alex laid afinger on one of the trees. “This one spoils the composition of the drawing. Itdoesn’t belong. An artist would know that. I knew it the instant I first saw it.Radell Cain didn’t see it because he wasn’t really an artist. The Lord Rahl whoput this there was.”“You mean to say that if that tree is erased, the gateway will function?”“I’d bet my life on it.”Jax looked around. “Then let’s send them back. Let’s try it.”Together the two of them gathered up the bodies and piled them in the center ofthe sand. The white sand turned red as it soaked up all the blood still runningfrom the corpses. They laid the bodies of Radell Cain and Sedrick Vendis side byside on top for all to see when they arrived.Alex used his thumb, wetted with his own blood from the cut on his arm, to erasethe tree that didn’t belong. When it was gone, he slid the knife into the slot.With a thud to the air, the light instantly ignited above the sand, sparklingaround the pile of corpses. The bodies vanished in a blink. No fading away,sparkling swirls, no nothing, just gone. The sand was again white.Alex and Jax looked at each other. All of the blood from the men was gone offthem as well. All that remained was their own.Suddenly alone, they looked into each other’s eyes for a moment before comingtogether in an embrace and then a kiss that was filled with joy and relief.As they sat together close under the soft light coming in from above through theopen roof in the center of the room, she said, “You really are Alexander,defender of man. You were true to your name.”They sat in silence for a time, just letting the peace and quiet settle in asthey held each other close.“I know what you’re thinking,” he finally said.Jax, her head against his shoulder, glanced up at him. “You do?”Alex nodded sadly. “You’re thinking that your part isn’t finished yet. You’rethinking that you are the defender of your people.”A tear trailed down her face. She swallowed as she looked away from his eyes.“I wouldn’t love you, Jax, if you were willing to abandon them without at leastpreparing them for you to leave them on their own.”Her smile returned. “You wouldn’t?”“No,” he whispered.“You understand?”He nodded, having difficulty finding his voice. “Even though it will break myheart to have you gone from my world, I understand that I have to let you dothis.”She laid her hand on the side of his face as she rested her head against him.“Only for now. I promise it will only be for a while.” Her lips trembled as sheheld back tears. “But I have to go back while we have the chance you have justgiven us. You’ve saved our world, if we act quickly. I need to see to it that weuse what you have just done to make sure we strike while we have this chance toend it.”“I know,” he said as he looked away, unable to bear it.She reached up and turned his face down to look at her. “I swear, Alex, I’ll beback as soon as I can. My life is yours now. Even if I’m not here, I’m yours.Now and always.”Tears ran down his face as he kissed her, never wanting it to end."},{"pageContent":"62.ALEX MADE HIS WAY ALONE through the forests that were now his. He was in a daze.Tears running down his face mixed with the gentle rain that felt as if the skywere reaching out to gently touch him in sympathy.It all seemed surreal.He was in love with a woman from another world. He had just fought a battlebetween worlds. He had just saved his world from killers who would have murderedpeople in the thousands.He wondered if he really was nuts.He wiped his nose on the back of his hand as he looked up at a patch of sky hecould see through an opening in the trees. He imagined Jax’s world out theresomewhere.She was out there, somewhere.He didn’t even know where “somewhere” was.He walked on without seeing anything. His mind saw only her. He thought only ofher. He wanted only her.His world was empty without her.Alex sighed. Life would have been so much simpler had he fallen in love with anEarth girl.He smiled, then, thinking that she must be thinking something rather similar.After she had gone, he’d spent the night alone in the place of the gateway. Hehated to leave the last spot he had seen her. They both wished she could havestayed for a while, stayed longer, stayed the night, stayed the week, the month,the year.Forever.But she couldn’t. She had to strike while they had the chance to end it. She hadto press that advantage now if her people were to live, to have the chance to befree of the sorrow Radell Cain had set loose on them and her world.Alex was proud of her. She was strong. It would have been easy to stay. But shewas strong. Her people needed her.At least for a while.Along the way back, Alex had come across the bodies of the men he had killed onthe way to get to Jax and the gateway. He didn’t want their bodies lying aboutin his woods. He activated their lifelines and sent them back.Near the end of the day Alex finally reached his Cherokee, parked beside thestream. He was tired from the long hike back from Castle Mountain.There was a white pickup parked there as well. On the door it said “DaggettTrust.”He was somehow not surprised that Hal Halverson would be there waiting for him.The man was sitting on a rock nearby. He rose up when he saw Alex coming,stretching to look back up the trail. His face was a picture of ferocity coloredwith alarm.“Where’s Jax? Is she all right?”“She’s fine.”Hal let out a sigh. “You had me worried for a second.” He looked back up thetrail. “So where is she?”Alex swallowed, steeling himself. “She had to go back.”Hal’s face turned distraught. “She’s gone?”Alex nodded. “For now. For a while.”“But why?”“What she came here to do isn’t finished. She has to tie up the loose ends.”“Oh.” Hal scratched his chin as he squinted suspiciously at Alex. “But she’scoming back.”Alex smiled. “Yes.”Hal smiled at last as he let out another sigh. “Good.”“What did you find out with the background checks?”Hal tossed a small stone into the woods. “Tyler was dirty. Before I got to himhe killed himself.”Alex took pause at that news. “I’m sorry to hear that.”“I know. We all were. The good news is that everyone else checks out.” Hegestured vaguely. “So what happened? How did things go up there?”“Well,” Alex said, “it’s a long story.”Hal shrugged. “I’ve got the time if you do. I’d like to hear all about it—if youdon’t mind telling it.”“No, I’d like to tell you about it, as a matter of fact.” They both sat down onthe broad, smooth boulder. “It would be good to get it all out, share it withsomeone.”Hal squinted skeptically. “But she’s coming back, right?”Alex smiled. “She is. She said yes when I asked her to marry me.”Hal blinked in surprise. “Marry you?”Alex nodded. “I can’t go to that world. She’s going to give up her world to comehere and be with me, so I had to let her go back and settle things there. Shehas to know that it’s going to be all right for her people, that they will besafe. For now she had to return, but she’s coming back.”Hal considered it a moment. “That makes sense. But it will be a relief to haveher back.” He cast Alex a sidelong glance. “Married, eh?”“We want to have a ceremony with just the members of the Daggett Society,” Alexsaid. “Get married with the people who have done so much for both our worlds andnot even known it.”Hal smiled. “We’d all like that, Alex.” He put an arm around Alex’s shoulders.“We’d all like that a lot. We’re going to be here for you. I know you’ve losteveryone you had, but know that you have us now. And we’ll be here for Jax aswell when she comes back. She won’t be lonely here with just you to be herfriend, I promise.”Alex grinned at the generosity of the man. “Thanks, Hal. That means a lot to meright now.”Hal let out a satisfied sigh. “So what about this story you were going to tellme?”Alex let out a long sigh of his own. “Well, I guess it all started when thisbeautiful woman popped into my world.”Hal chuckled. “Isn’t that how it always starts?”"}]
