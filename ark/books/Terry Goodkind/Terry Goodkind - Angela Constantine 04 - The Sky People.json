Morning Flower screamed. She was yanked fromher feet so hard she lost a buckskin shoe. Before River could try to grab holdof her, Flower had been lifted, kicking and shrieking, and pulled back out ofreach by a man with a frightening mask. At the same time, more than a dozenpainted men from a war party rose up from the tall grass all around.They were surrounded by Wolf People warriors.As she was turning back, River shrugged the strap of the game bag off hershoulder, letting it drop to the ground. Hot anger took the place of icy fear.Fast as she could, River pulled her bow off her other shoulder and nocked anarrow, even though she knew that what she was about to do was wrong.These men were all big and powerful. All were painted in the same way, withstripes around the bulging muscles of their arms. Their jaws were painted black.They all glared out from angled white lines. Blood-red war paint covered theircheeks. Grass tied to their arms and at the backs of their heads had helpedconceal them in the tall grass for an ambush.Only the man who had grabbed Flower wore a mask. That terrifying carved mask hada hooked, black beak. It marked him as Great Hawk, the son of their chief. Beingthe son of a chief, he had the privilege of being the one to take a captive.As one of the men rushed forward and lunged for her, his arm extended, Riverfired the arrow.Because of his experience in battle, he twisted at the last instant so that,while the arrow pierced his chest, it hit above his left lung, missing a vitalspot. He recoiled in surprise at being shot with an arrow as she whipped anotherfrom the buckskin quiver over the back of her right shoulder. She nocked thesecond arrow.“No!” Flower screamed as she was being carried away in the arms of Great Hawk.“River, no!”As terrified as she was of being taken, Flower was more afraid of Riverviolating one of the most sacred laws of their people, a law that had beendrilled into them since birth. That law was central to everything in herpeople’s lives.At that moment, those laws meant nothing to River. She wanted only to protecther little sister.“Run!” Flower screamed.River understood. Her sister, as young as she was, didn’t want River to let themen capture her too. She knew River had a chance to help her only if she gotaway and went for help.River’s aim tracked the man who had her sister.String to her cheek, heart filled with rage, River paused her breath. Her mindwent still and silent. Nothing around her mattered anymore. Like the breath of awhisper, she released the taut bowstring. The arrow flew past Flower’s head asthe powerful Great Hawk held her tight against his chest.The razor-sharp arrowhead pierced the side of his throat, ripping flesh and thebig artery as it flew clear through. He staggered back three steps as gouts ofblood sprayed from the wound. River’s aim had been true.As he collapsed, he lost his grip on Flower. The man beside him hooked her withan arm as she tried to escape. After a brief look at the son of their chief andseeing that nothing could be done for him, the man dragged Flower away.Before River could get another arrow, a big warrior, the grass tied to his armsand head waving like a monster’s hair, rushed her. River ducked aside just intime as he leaped to catch her in his arms. He missed, landing face first with agrunt at her feet. Rather than go for another arrow, River pulled a knife fromthe sheath at her waist, intending in her rage to stab him before he could getup, but Flower screamed again.“Run, River! Tell Father! Run!”If River didn’t escape, her family would never know what had happened to them.They would never know that it had been a war party of Wolf People.Hating the thought of leaving her defenseless little sister, River knew in thatinstant that Flower was right.Dodging first to one side, then to the other to avoid arms reaching for her,River bolted away. As her long legs carried her past the chief’s son lying deadin the grass, she reached down and stripped the mask from his face.Most of the dozen men followed. She knew what they wanted. The Wolf People stolewomen from other tribes as slave wives. Morning Flower, named because she hadbeen born at dawn, was too young and innocent to truly grasp the intent of thesemen.River knew in her heart that if she wanted to have any hope of rescuing Flower,fighting these strong warriors was not the way. Alone, she had no chance againstall of them. As difficult as it was to leave Flower, the way to help her was toescape and get back to her own people and try to get help. She had to tell herfather. She had to tell their shaman, White Crow. She had to let them know thatthe Wolf People had taken Morning Flower. She had to convince them, this time,to act.Raging River, the mask tucked in her belt and her bow back over her shoulder,ran with all her strength. Her powerful legs gradually took her out of reach ofthe men. Even though she was out of reach, they were close behind and theyweren’t going to stop. Wolf People warriors were said to be able to run all daywithout slowing. River didn’t know if that was true, but the men, having lostprecious little ground, were still coming.She could hear them close behind her, whooping battle cries. She knew that ifthey caught her there would be no hope for her or Flower. No one would ever knowwhat had happened to them. No one would ever try to rescue them.River had never heard of anyone escaping the Wolf People. She had heard that menwho were captured were tortured for days and then staked to the ground stillalive to let wild animals feed on them. The women were usually not killed, butRiver had heard tales that they all wished to trade places with the men stakedto the ground. Whether man or woman, to be captured by the Wolf People was aterrifying fate.River could hear the men’s feet thumping the soft ground as they ran. It was afrightening sound, knowing they were that close. Her breaths came fast andragged. They all still had enough breath for bloodcurdling howls. Even thoughher legs were beginning to ache, she knew that there could be no stopping if shehad any hope to escape. Better to have her heart give out at a dead run than tofall into their hands.Running with at least a dozen men in close pursuit, she finally left the flatgrassland and entered the hill country. As she ran up slopes, her lungs burning,the hills became more tightly dotted with scrub trees, and then with biggertrees. As she ran, getting ever closer to her own people, to her home, she beganto worry that this war party would follow her right into her village. If theydid, her people might overpower them, but not before they slaughtered many.She dismissed that much of her worry. She had heard stories of the Wolf Peopleattacking other tribes, but when they did they always used many warriors, enoughwarriors to overpower any resistance. Though these warriors looked fierce, andthey could certainly kill many people, they were smart enough to know they couldnot take the entire village. They would be overwhelmed by masses of people andwhipped with willow switches until driven away, suffering the indignity and painof countless slashes.As the trees grew taller and in greater numbers, she suddenly came upon a deepravine on a forested hillside that she and Flower had crossed on their way tohunt for game. She was relieved to spot the log across the deep cut through thehillside. The dirt sides of the small gorge were steep. If she fell over theedge, she knew it would be a painful but not a fatal fall to the bottom. Itwould probably be a tumbling slide down to the fast-moving stream. The climb upthe other side, up the crumbling dirt while snatching at roots, would not bequick.If she took that safer but slower route of a controlled slide down the sharpbank and wading across the stream, the men would catch her as she struggled toclimb up the opposite bank. It was a fool’s choice to cross that way.River instead danced out across the log, knowing it was her only hope. She knew,too, that if she fell, the men would have her. Not being very thick, the logflexed up and down with her weight, making balance difficult, but she racedonward and in a flash she was safely across.She stopped and turned, then, catching her breath, as she saw the men rushing upto the bank on the far side. Even if they didn’t use the log, they could stillslide down the steep bank, cross the stream, and then climb up on her side.Crossing that way, they would lose some ground to her, but soon enough theywould again be in hot pursuit.They were predators running down their prey. They were not going to stop."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2 [index_split_002.html#filepos3481]River knew she had only one chance.Glaring at the men gathered on the opposite bank, she swiftly nocked an arrow.“You killed Great Hawk, the son of our chief!” Unlike the others, the man whospoke for them had hawk feathers sticking up from the sides of his headband,marking him as second-in-command to Great Hawk and now their leader. “For this,you will die!”“I killed a coward who steals children,” she called back across.He shook a war hammer. “You will die for what you have done!”“Come on, then,” she called to him. “Do you have courage enough to come across?You say I must die. So come across and get me.”She drew the string back to her cheek, causing them to hesitate at the logcrossing.“The Sun People are sworn never to kill! It is your law! You will run insteadlike the cowards your people are.”“So, you are brave Wolf People?” she taunted. “Come across, then. You have seenwith Great Hawk that my aim is true, and I am not afraid to kill. Though I amone of the Sun People, I will not run. Go ahead, come across, and I will pickyou off one at a time. Come across and your bodies will rot in the stream belowwithout a proper warrior burial.”The leader pointed his war hammer down into the ravine. “We can get acrosswithout having to walk the log as you did.”“Fine with me,” she yelled back at them. “I can shoot you as you wade the streamor claw your way up the bank. It will be like shooting fish in a pool. Come on,then, if you are brave enough.”Angry at being held at bay by a mere woman, they withdrew a short distance tocluster in a tight group and argue about what to do.“You will run out of arrows,” the leader called across once the bunch of thembroke up from their strategizing. “Once you run out, the rest of us will be ableto cross and then we will have you!”Still holding the string to her cheek, aiming at the man who was talking, sheshrugged. “Maybe. We will see. So then, while I still have arrows, which of youwants to be the one to come forward first and die?”The leader shook a fist. “We can split up, some crossing to the north, some tothe south.”“Then go.” Again, she shrugged. “By the time you get back together I will begone. If you are to catch me, this crossing is your only way. You must hope,though, that I don’t have an arrow for each of you.”They weren’t sure she was right, but they were clearly worried that she mightbe. She knew that time was against her. If some stayed as a threat while somewent another way, they could catch her. She needed to keep them from realizingthat.“Choose then. Who among you will be the first to try to cross? Who among youchooses to be the one to die? Is it you, Ass Feathers? You have a brave tongue.You speak for the others, so you should show them you are the bravest among themby being first to come across. But are you brave enough to be the first to dieat the hands of a woman? Come across, then, brave Wolf warrior wearing assfeathers.” She showed them a taunting grin. “Come across.”The leader with the tall feathers in his headband shook his war hammer in anger.“You wish to act like a man? We will have you, and when we do you will betreated as we would treat any man we capture. You will wish we had caught you inthe beginning along with the other girl. Now, since you pretend to be a bravewarrior, that fate is too good for you.”Raging River felt tears welling up in her eyes at the thought of those menhaving her little sister. Flower was not yet of an age to know what men would doto her. Before long she would come to know.“Real Wolf People warriors do not waste time with empty words,” she yelled, heranger rising, “Act like real men and decide which of you will be first to die.Come across so I, a mere Sun People woman, may take your lives as easily as Itook the life of your chief’s son.”The leader threw his war hammer at her in a fit of fury. River ducked to theside as it whistled past her ear. As she swiftly came back up, she loosed herarrow. It caught his arm above his elbow. It was a bird arrow with a sharpenedtip rather than an arrowhead like the one that had killed the chief’s son, so itpierced all the way through beside the bone. It stopped with half sticking outon the far side. He cursed her at the top of his lungs.River knew that despite her bluster she was in a weak position. While she washolding them off for the moment, she couldn’t turn and run for home. If she did,they would be able to cross on the log and come after her. More determined thanever, they would run her down. She needed to keep them too busy to realize it.River would eventually lose the standoff. She needed to think of something fastor she was going to die. She knew that she had only three more arrows left inher quiver.One of the men broke off the fletched end of the arrow sticking out the front ofhis leader’s arm and then gave the part jutting out the back a quick yank topull what was left the rest of the way through.The man with the feathered headband acted as if it didn’t hurt. He gave her amocking look, letting her know that he was a Wolf warrior and her arrow wasnothing to a man like him. She wanted to wipe the smirk from his painted face.“You should know,” she yelled across the ravine, “that my arrows have poison onthe tips. You will soon lose your ability to walk, then to stand, and finallyyou will drop to the ground and die painfully. But know that, althoughagonizing, your end will at least come quickly.”It was a lie, but River needed to break the deadlock. She had to give them causeto worry.“You lie!” the wounded leader called out. “Your arrows are for hunting game. Youare not a warrior. That was a bird arrow. Your arrows have no poison.”“My people are hungry. I do not want to risk losing valuable meat. My turkeyarrows are poisoned so that even if it is not a quick kill, when the woundedturkey takes flight I can follow until it falls dead.” She knew they would besweating from running so hard. “Feel your flesh. By now the poison has reachedyour heart. You will already have a fever. You will fall dead before you can getback to your people.”One of the men inspected the wound in his leader’s arm. Another sniffed thebloody arrowhead and carefully touched the tip with the end of his tongue.Another man leaned in and sucked blood from the arrow wound, as if sucking thepoison from a snakebite. He spat out what he tasted, did it several more times,and then waved his arms as he gestured hastily to the wounded man.They argued among themselves in voices too low for her to hear. But she couldhear the anger in their words. She could also hear the worry.Finally, they all took off at a trot, back the way they had come.River stood her ground, bowstring drawn, until they vanished into the distance.Even though she had won a small battle, they still had her little sister.River wiped tears from her cheeks as she turned and started running for home."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3 [index_split_002.html#filepos3597]River trotted into her village, exhausted and out of breath. She could hardlyput one foot in front of another. Her legs burned. Her lungs burned. Her heartburned for Flower.As she passed through long shadows in the narrow passages among the mud brickbuildings and entered the larger square in the center of her village, chickensscattered out of her way, flapping their wings and squawking in alarm. Thevillage dogs ran up to greet her wagging their skinny tails as they surroundedher, hoping she had some bit of food for them. She patted a few on the shoulderas she pushed through them. Big Dog charged his way through to her side.River had raised Big Dog since she had found him as a small pup abandoned in thegrasslands. He considered River to be his one and only master. He ate with herand slept with her.All of the other village dogs were midsize with short tan fur. Besides being alot bigger, Big Dog looked entirely different from all the others. By hislonger, dark fur and thick ruff as well as the long shape of his muzzle, it wasclear he was part wolf. She drew Big Dog’s ear through her hand, something healways enjoyed. He heaved a sigh of relief to have her home. Since he loved tochase birds from cover before she could get close enough to take them, he wasnot a helpful hunting companion. Now, she wished she had let him come on thehunt anyway.Lookouts would have already announced her return. They would also have announcedthat Morning Flower was not with her.Her father, his leathery face grim, waited on the far side of the gatheringsquare, flanked by his advisors and other important people. Everyone stood insilence, backs straight, apprehensive about what she would report.“Chief Standing Bear,” she said to her father with a bow of her head out ofrespect. “I have terrible news.”“Where is your sister?” he asked in concern as he glanced behind her before shecould tell him.“Morning Flower and I were attacked by Wolf People warriors.”The gathered crowd gasped.His frown deepened the heavy creases of his leathery face. “Are you sure it wasWolf People?”“They were painted in the traditional designs of a Wolf People war party. Weknow all too well those painted men.” She lifted the war hammer one of the menhad thrown at her, showing the people. They all recognized the pattern of thewoven leather on the handle as a Wolf People design. “They captured MorningFlower and took her away with them.”River’s mother, Lone Willow, rushed forward. “They took my little MorningFlower?”River, too choked with tears to speak, could only nod.“How is it, then, that you were not taken?” Walking Stag, one of the moreaggressive young men, asked.He sounded suspicious rather than angry that the Wolf People had her littlesister. Like many strong and brave young men, Walking Stag thought that one dayhe should be chief of the Sun People.Rather than answer him, River turned back to her father. “I fought them off andran back here to get help for Morning Flower. We must gather a rescue party atonce. Maybe we can catch—”“You know our laws,” Standing Bear said, cutting her off. He gave his head oneshake of regret. “We cannot fight the Wolf People or any other. It isforbidden.”River didn’t back down. “I know why those men took little Flower. We all knowwhy. We must fight to get her back.”“Those who gave us our laws forbid killing.”River could feel her face going red with rage. “They kill. They come to kill SunPeople, and we run and hide or at most beat them off with willow switches. Theytake our young women and we do nothing. They kill our young men and we donothing.”Standing Bear shook his head more firmly. “We all know the sorrow of losingthose we love, but what you wish to do is against our most sacred law. You knowthat.”“I know that I wish I would have killed more of them!”She realized it was out of her mouth before she had intended to reveal it.Eyes widened among the gathered people. Some gasped. Silence gradually descendedover the group.“What do you mean, you wish you would have killed more of them?” Walking Stagasked in a measured voice as he stepped forward.Standing Bear, the lines in face deepening with worry, leaned toward her. “Whathave you done, daughter?”“I protected myself and tried to protect Flower. She is my little sister. I wassupposed to protect her. I failed her because I let them surprise us. I shouldhave been more alert. But that does not mean that they can take a child fromus.”Her father lifted a hand out to the side to prevent Walking Stag from coming anycloser. The arm was also a warning to keep quiet. It was not his place toquestion her. That was for the chief to do. Her father’s dark eyes turned backto her.“This is great trouble, Raging River. You have violated—”“What about Flower!” River’s hands fisted at her sides. “Don’t you care aboutFlower? Don’t you care about your own daughter? Aren’t you willing to dosomething to get her back? Will you stand by and allow our people to be indanger?”“The danger is past.” His voice took on the firm tone of finality. “The WolfPeople will now be satisfied that they have a captive. They will leave us be fornow.”River gritted her teeth. “That is the talk of a coward.”The crowd gasped. Her mother stepped forward and slapped her. “You will notspeak with such irreverence to our chief and your father.”Standing Bear lifted a hand, not unlike the way he had lifted a hand to WalkingStag, as if to calm his wife and say that he would handle it.“River,” he said in a more fatherly tone, “you can have a child and replaceFlower for our people. That is how you may right this loss. It is long past timethat you should be a wife and a mother. Instead, you violate our laws.” Heturned and indicated the tall young man to the side. “I think it is time youwere the wife of Walking Stag.”When he turned back, the look she gave him told him that he had just made amistake.“It is forbidden for anyone,” she said in a low, measured tone, “even our chief,to tell a priestess that she must take a husband, and more so that anyone, evena chief, should name that man.”Raging River had been named priestess of the Sun People before she had even beenborn. That mantle had passed on to her only when the last priestess had died andwould only pass on to the next when she died. For now, she was priestess of theSun People.The mood suddenly turned. Standing Bear, though he was chief and angry that shehad violated their law, had just tried to violate one of their most deeply heldcustoms.Realizing he had overstepped his authority, he bowed his head to her.“I apologize, Priestess.”Raging River gave him a look that only a priestess could give and then stormedoff, giving Walking Stag the same look on the way by. The gazes of both men wentto the ground as she went past."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4 [index_split_002.html#filepos3713]River flopped down on the floor in the small single room of her home, heremotions flying in every direction all at once. She was panic-stricken forMorning Flower. Tears sprang forth at the thought of her sister’s lonely terror,at the thought of being helpless to do anything to save her.River was furious that Flower had been taken. She was ashamed that she had notprotected her little sister. She was embarrassed that her father would not actlike a man and do something to rescue his daughter. She was shamed that the SunPeople would not protect one so innocent. She was angry at their cowardly law.Raging River sat, feeling helpless, feeling humiliated at having killed a man,but at the same time wishing she had killed them all. She was their priestessand yet she had violated their most important law. She, above all others, wasexpected to respect their laws. Yet she would do it again if given the chance tosave Flower. For that matter, she would do it again to save any of her people,even though they wouldn’t do the same for her.Unlike many of the better dwellings in the village, hers was not made of bakedmud brick, but like a few others was instead made of small logs. They werespaced apart and stood upright in holes, and then green branches were wovenbetween them. The woven branches were chinked with a mixture of straw, sand, andmud. Once the walls were woven and thoroughly chinked, then plastered over, theywere strong and weathertight. Her roof was made from the abundant grasses thatgrew to the east of their village. The small logs came from the abundant treesgrowing in the forested mountains to the other side.The logs were no bigger around than her wrist. She had cut and gathered themherself, then dragged them home. She had collected the green branches, woventhem, and chinked them by herself. She had gathered the grasses for the roof byherself, but some of the young men of the village had helped with making theroof over her small home.One wall was shared with the house of her parents. Against that wall she hadbuilt her small fireplace with rocks she had carried back from creeks andstreams. Morning Flower lived with her parents beyond that shared wall. Atleast, that was where Morning Flower used to live. Now she was a captive of theWolf People.Nose first, Big Dog pushed his way in past the hide hanging over her doorway.His tongue lolled out to one side, he loped over to where she sat cross-leggedbefore the fireplace. He lay down beside her and rested his head on her leg asif to console her. Big Dog recognized her moods, and he knew she was heartsick,even if he didn’t know why. He simply wanted to be by her. She ran her hand overhis head in appreciation of his unqualified loyalty.The fire had for the most part gone cold, but there were a few glowing coals shehad banked off to the side before leaving that morning on a hunt with her littlesister. She pushed the hot coals together, then broke twigs, piling them on theglowing coals to bring the fire back to life.As she watched the flames grow and the smoke curl up, she fed in some sticks ofwood. She stared into the dance of small flames, and considered something shehad never considered before.No one ever acted. They always accepted what happened, even this, as the waythings were. Their laws forbade them from doing otherwise. For the Sun People,breaking those laws meant their spirit would be forever cast into the darkwilderness after death, never to settle.River knew that she had to act. What happened after death was a mystery to her,but what was happening in life she knew all too well and it was not acceptable.No one would dare to violate their laws. She already had. She knew something hadto be done, and she was the only one among the Sun People who had the ability toact. She was their priestess. As their priestess, she was the only one who coulddo anything.She was also the only one among them who had ever killed anyone.As their priestess, she was the only person allowed to do what she now knew shemust.River scooped up some of the darkest ashes from the side of the fireplace andput them in a grinding bowl. She lifted the lid off a bowl of lard beside hercooking pot and took a generous swipe of it with a finger. After wiping it offher finger onto the inside of the grinding bowl, she let Big Dog lick her fingerclean. She drew her knife and used it to puncture the heel of her hand in orderto add blood to the mixture.As Big Dog watched, she used a stone to grind the mixture together to make blackpaint. After she had worked it into a smooth consistency, she set the stoneaside. Looking down into the black paint, she wondered momentarily if she wasdoing the right thing. She knew, though, that she had no choice.Gathering her courage, she started using the black mixture she had made to painta mask across her face. She made the mask tall enough to go from above hereyebrows to down across the top half of her nose. She checked her reflection ina dark bowl of water to make sure it looked right. It looked frightening.Once she had completed the mask across her eyes, she made up another paint outof white ash. She used the white to cover the rest of her face so that nonewould mistake its meaning or intent.As the village priestess, she intended to make the journey to Spirit Mountain tocall upon their ancestor spirits, and more.She went to the door of her small home and pulled the hide hanging over her dooraside. Across the way, a gaggle of young boys were playing a game with smallstones. The boys looked up when she stepped into the doorway. They oftenfollowed her around, because it was well known among them that trouble tended tofollow River and they liked to witness what trouble she would bring.When they saw her painted face, they froze. None had ever seen such a thingbefore. Most of the village hadn’t. If they had, it would only have been beforeshe was born.“I want you boys to do something for me,” she called to them.They all rushed to their feet, eager for the chance to be a rare part ofwhatever trouble she would bring about this time. By her painted face, theyrecognized that, this time, it would be big trouble.“What is it?” one of the boys asked.“Call Chief Standing Bear and his advisors to the square. Tell the shaman thatthe priestess wants him there, too.”The boys stared in astonishment. “White Crow?” one of them asked. “Are you sureyou want us to summon White Crow as well?”“That’s right. Hurry now. Tell them the priestess has called for them to comeimmediately. I will be there in a twinkling.”The boys ran off, excited to be part of the new trouble she was stirring up."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5 [index_split_002.html#filepos3829]The thick cloud cover made a dark roof over the world. At the horizon the darkground rose up to meet a burning band of sky. The dark ground and dark sky wouldsoon meet and shroud the world in darkness until the sun returned at dawn. Toher people, the sun was the sacred giver of life.As River walked resolutely into the square, people moved back out of her way.Standing Bear was speaking to his advisors. When he heard the people fallingsilent, he turned to see what was happening.White Crow sat on a low wall to the side. He had his ceremonial blanket aroundhis shoulders and a wife to each side. His long, braided hair had been white assnow as far back as River could remember. He wore his necklaces of brightlycolored amulets, each having meaning or purpose. Tied at the ends of his braidswere crow feathers that he regularly dipped in white ash.When White Crow saw her painted face, he stood and came forward, not looking atall happy. In fact, he looked decidedly unhappy, as did her father, StandingBear, and his advisors. Both the chief and the shaman waited for her to explainherself.“I must go to Spirit Mountain,” she announced without delay.Her father looked to be taken by surprise. “Why?”“Because as priestess I am the guardian of our ancestors. White Crow, would youplease tell us all the story of the creation of our people?”He frowned as he glanced to people to the sides, unsure of her intent.“Everyone knows of our beginning. Why are you painted to meet with the dead?What is it you intend to do?”“I did not ask if everyone knows our beginning. I asked you to tell us all thestory of the creation of our people. It is important that everyone knows thestory so that they may understand what it is I intend to do and why I must doit.”He sighed as he hiked the blanket up higher around his shoulders. “In thebeginning,” he said, looking out over the silent gathering of the Sun People,“there was only the sky and the ground. The sun, up in the sky, was lonely inthe empty world, so he sent a raven down to the ground. The raven carried seedsfrom Father Sun and planted them in the barren ground.“Once the seeds were in the ground, Father Sun kissed the ground to warm thoseseeds. Life-giving rain was sent. From those seeds, watered by the rain andwarmed by the sun, our people grew. We came into the world and made the sunfather happy because he was no longer alone. We worshiped our father’s returneach day at dawn. This pleased the sun, and he named us the Sun People.“Then, one day when the sun saw his children fighting and killing one another,he sent the Sky People down to give us our laws.”As silence rang out over the gathering, River nodded.“And what else have the Sky People brought us?” she asked.White Crow’s brow drew tight. “What do you mean? The Sky People brought lawsdown to us from the sun up in the sky.”River regarded the old shaman with a bitter expression. “The sun may have givenus life, but the Sky People brought us death and suffering. One brought life,the other brought death.”“But that is not true,” White Crow whispered in alarm. “The laws given to us bythe Sky People are sacred. We live by those laws.”“No,” she said, looking out at the people watching her. “We do not live by thoselaws. We die by those laws.”Worry swept through the crowd.“What are you talking about?” Standing Bear demanded.“How many of our men have been captured and staked to the ground to die? Howmany of our young women have been taken from us? On the last new moon, a raidingparty of Wolf People warriors came into our village and stole the grinding stonewe use to grind our grains so that our people may be fed.”“We can make another grinding stone,” he said. “In the meantime, we make do andgrind our grain as best we can.”“As best we can,” she said as she nodded, “as our people go hungry. As childrencry in hunger as they go to bed. As parents go without to try to feed theiryoung ones.”“It will take time,” Standing Bear said with strained patience, “but we willeventually make another grinding stone.”“And when we do, the Wolf People, or another people, will come and take it fromus while we stand by, helpless.” River showed no emotion as she went on. “Howmany of our people were killed by the Wolf People warriors as we tried to keepthem from stealing the most precious and important thing the Sun Peoplepossess?”No one said a word, so River answered her own question. “Twenty-three young menwho tried to drive them off with willow switches were killed. Six young womenwere taken along with our grinding stone. You can eventually replace ourpeople’s grinding stone. How will you replace the lives sacrificed to our law?”“But our law—”“Our law killed those twenty-three young men,” she said, cutting the chief off.The crowd was silent at her irreverence.“The Wolf People warriors can only kill our people because of our law. Whilethey are the worst, it is not only the Wolf People. The Yellow Fish came andstole from our stores of food. The Snow Tribe raids our village as they wish,and last spring stole most of our goats. The Boar Tribe has killed our huntingparties and stolen their game. The Lake Tribe has raided our village, stealingfrom us, the last time crippling a man and hurting others who tried to stopthem.”White Crow smirked. “You have forgotten to rage against sickness and fever thathas also befallen our people.”“For those things we have a medicine man and we have you. I presume you do notalso wish to shrink from fighting those as well.”The smirk turned to a scowl.“Through it all,” she said, “as others steal from us, kill Sun People, and takeour women, the most we can do is run and hide and hope they don’t find us. Wenever fight back to protect ourselves.”“You can’t go against our sacred laws. Our Father Sun sent the Sky People togive us those laws,” Standing Bear insisted, his anger finally unleashed. “Youcannot go against the laws the Sky People have laid down for us! It isforbidden!”She didn’t react to his anger. “While you all do nothing, let me tell you what Iam going to do,” she said. “I am going to Spirit Mountain, the land where ourancestors are laid to rest and where their spirits dwell… where one of the SkyPeople is said to have been laid to rest among us after giving us our laws.”“What good will that do?” the shaman demanded.“I intend to call the Sky People.”Everyone stared in speechless shock.Dumbfounded, Standing Bear spoke softly. “No one can call the Sky People,” hesaid, his voice filled with a lifetime of passionate faith. “The Sky People weresent by our Father Sun. They cannot be called forth by us.”“We will see,” River said.The old shaman, seeing the stunned looks of the people, finally waved a hand.“For what purpose?”“I must ask for their help,” she told him.Standing Bear cocked his head. “Why do you need their help?”“Because the Wolf People will be coming here to kill us all.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6 [index_split_002.html#filepos3945]Standing Bear frowned. “Why would you say that? Yes, the Wolf People kill someof our people, and take some of our women, and they sometimes raid our villageand steal from us, and while that is terrible, it is the price we pay to keepthe peace with them.“Because of that peace the Sun People continue to exist. By enduring some loss,we remain at peace with them and we survive. Because of that peace they do notkill us all. Our laws have made that peace possible.”Lightning flickered in the distance where the dark sky had finally met thehorizon. Torches held by some of the chief’s council lit the assembled peoplewith flickering light.River’s gaze briefly swept the tightly packed crowd, riveted in silence.“There will be no more of what you call peace with the Wolf People,” River said.Chief Standing Bear and Shaman White Crow shared a worried look. It was ChiefStanding Bear who finally spoke.“Why do you say such a thing?”Raging River reached into the small woven satchel hanging at her belt. Shepulled out the mask with the hooked black beak and tossed it to their feet.“The man I killed was Great Hawk, the son of their chief. After I killed him, Itook his sacred mask. I am proud to say that he did not die an easy death. Forthat, the Wolf People will come here to kill us all.”“Their chief’s son!” the shaman cried. “Great Hawk! You killed Great Hawk? Whathave you done to us! By killing Great Hawk, you have broken the peace andmurdered us all!”“I did not go to their village and kill Great Hawk. They hid in ambush and stoleMorning Flower. They would have taken me as well had I not fought them off. I’msure the Sun People’s priestess would have been a great prize for them. I didnot choose to be their prize. I have done nothing but fight for the life of mysister and myself. The same as all of you should do for all of our people.”“This cannot stand.” White Crow shook his head. “No. This cannot stand.”“It is already done,” she said.“It is not done,” the shaman said as he lifted his chin in defiance. “You willgo to them and offer yourself in sacrifice to atone for killing the son of theirchief. This is your fault. You must make it right by giving yourself to them forhaving killed Great Hawk.”“Are you really foolish enough to think that would stop them?” she asked.White Crow was red-faced and sputtering in anger. “This cannot—”Ignoring the old shaman, she pointed at Walking Stag. “Gather other strong men.You must all prepare to fight to save our people.”“What!” He glanced briefly at Standing Bear before looking back at her. “You arenot the chief of our people!”“No, I am the priestess of our people. The ultimate duty of the priestess is theprotection of her people. Until I can go to Spirit Mountain and call the SkyPeople for help, you and the strongest of the Sun People will stand and fight.”“And if we refuse?” he asked.River shrugged. “Then you will die. They will be coming. It is only a matter ofwhen. Make your choice. If I could fight for the life of one I love, so too canyou. If you love our people, you will fight to protect them. I go to SpiritMountain to do what only what a priestess can do. I will call the Sky People.While I am gone, you must do what you can do and prepare to protect our people.”“How?” White Crow interrupted. “How can you call the Sky People?”River hadn’t the slightest idea how. She only knew that she must.Since she had no answer, she ignored White Crow’s question, which only angeredhim all the more. Standing Bear looked angry as well, but he had the good senseto remain silent. While the priestess was not chief, in certain matters her wordwas absolute. She only hoped that this was one of those matters.When White Crow opened his mouth to speak, Raging River shot him a hot glare andheld up a finger in warning. His mouth slowly closed and stayed closed.“You all need to prepare,” River said as her gaze glided out over the gatheredpeople, the people she loved and wanted to protect. Her voice lowered with quietpower. “The Wolf People will be coming. I have always known that one day theywould.“You can either fight them off, or you can let them kill you. If you do notintend to fight them off…” She pulled her finger across her throat. “…Then youmight as well slit your throats now, for it will be an easier death than theWolf People will grant you. First, though, you should slit the throats of yourchildren to spare them what is to come.”Some people in the crowd gasped; others began to weep. Yet others looked toohorrified to weep.“This is all your fault,” White Crow said as he shook a finger at her. “You arebanished from among the Sun People! Banished! Banished now and forever!”“You do not have the authority to banish a priestess,” she said in a calm,dismissive tone. As he shouted and waved his arms in anger, she turned away fromhim as if he were no more than a cranky child throwing a tantrum.“Walking Stag,” River announced, “you must now prepare to protect our people. Aspriestess, I give this responsibility to you. Gather young men who along withyou will be Sun People warriors. Look to Standing Bear for counsel.”He looked between her and his chief. “But—”“If you want someday to become chief, then this is how you prove yourself. Youprotect your people to prove that you are worthy of ruling them.”River didn’t wait for an answer. She turned and left."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7 [index_split_002.html#filepos4061]“May I enter?” River called from outside the woven cloth covering the doorway.Symbols worked into the coarse material were meant to ward off evil spirits. Orfrighten people away. River wasn’t entirely sure which.“Yes, child, enter,” came the gentle, familiar voice.It was darker than dark outside and smelled like rain was not far off. By theflickers of lightning drawing ever closer, the storm looked sure to make for afrightening night. She needed to be on her way to Spirit Mountain, storm or nostorm. Every moment she delayed only made the situation more desperate, butfirst she needed to visit She Who Knows the Moon.When River stepped quietly into the home, the old woman had lit a splinter inthe low fire and was using it to light several candles on benches built into thebottom of the mud brick walls. She smiled warmly as she turned and held out ahand, indicating the woven rug on the dirt floor in front of the small hearth.“Sit, child. I have been expecting you.”River had only just decided to visit the woman before leaving. But having knownShe Who Knows the Moon as far back as she could remember, and having oftensought out her advice, River wasn’t all that surprised at being expected.“It is good to see you again, Wise One.”She Who Knows the Moon smiled. She had an easy smile. The lines and creases ofher weatherworn features seemed to have been shaped by that enduring smile. OnlyRiver called her Wise One. She was bent with great age, but she moved easilyenough. As River sat on the carpet, the old woman came over and sat close,across from River. She wrapped her shoulders with a light blanket as she waitedto hear what River would say.“Wise One, I have come to ask your help.”Still smiling, she poured something from a jug into a cup. She handed it toRiver.“Yes, I know. As I told you, I have been expecting you.”River leaned in, only a bit surprised. This kind of thing wasn’t unheard of withher old friend.“You have powers to see into events?”She Who Knows the Moon let out a soft laugh. “No, I heard you speaking to thepeople in the square.” She pointed with a crooked finger. “My door faces apassageway that leads directly to the square. With the way the walls funnelsound, I can often hear what is said there. It saves me the walk.”“Oh.” River was a little disappointed that it wasn’t something more mysterious.Because she knew so much, and more so because she was so reclusive, people weresometimes a little afraid of her. River, knowing the old woman as well as shedid, assumed those fears were merely the ill-informed product of rumor andgossip. Even if some were cautious around her, She Who Knows the Moon wasrevered in their village, because she knew a great deal about a great manythings. She was the one who remembered all the stories of their people, even thestories few had heard, and fewer still remembered. She was a store of knowledgefor their people who passed down those stories that she kept alive.“You have come to see me because you intend to travel to Spirit Mountain.”“That’s right,” River said. “I’ve never been there before.” She didn’t want toadmit that she was afraid.“That is not quite true,” She Who Knows the Moon said.“What do you mean it’s not quite true?”“You were there once before.”River leaned in. “What are you talking about? I would know if I had been there.”The old woman nodded toward the cup in River’s hands. “Drink.”River quickly downed the slightly sweet drink so as to get on with the reasonshe was there.“I hate to disagree with one so wise, but I’m afraid you are mistaken. I havenever been to Spirit Mountain.”“No?” The woman smiled to herself. “How did you come to be the priestess? Tellme.”River cleared her throat. “Well…” She frowned. “I guess I’m not sure, but Ialways believed I was named priestess when the last one died, when I was little,when I was too young to remember it.”The old woman’s smile widened. “Your mother never told you the story of how youwere named, then?”“There’s a story? No, she never mentioned it.” She thought for a moment. “Totell you the truth, whenever I asked she always avoided the subject of how Icame to be named priestess. I didn’t want to disrespect her by continuing toask, so I stopped asking.”The old woman nodded with a knowing smile.“Your mother was very close to Bright Star,” She Who Knows the Moon said.“Who is Bright Star?”“Bright Star was the priestess before you.”“Really? I never knew that. I’m sorry, but I just don’t remember her.”“I wouldn’t expect you to. You were not yet born.”River frowned, trying to understand the whole thing. “How could I be namedbefore I was even born?”She Who Knows the Moon let out a long sigh. “Well, before you were born, BrightStar was the priestess. She was quiet and spent much of her time alone.”“Why?”“Because people were uneasy around her, fearing her because of her position, andalso because she was a person who knew what was right and spoke her mind. Muchlike you. While that fear was only the unfounded fears of people, it made BrightStar sad to have people avoid her. But she did have one friend who was like asister to her, a woman she loved dearly.”“Who was that?” River asked.“Your mother.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8 [index_split_002.html#filepos4177]River blinked. “My mother? She never spoke of Bright Star. I’ve never even heardthe name mentioned before you just spoke it now. I don’t understand. If theywere such dear friends, why would my mother never mention it or speak of her?”“Your mother had her reasons.”“What reasons?”The old woman smiled at River’s unquenchable curiosity. “Sometimes you are likea small child, River, always asking ‘why’.”River leaned back away a little, trying to look less insistent. “Well, don’t youthink that, considering that Bright Star was my mother’s dear friend, that shewas also the last priestess, and that I am now the priestess, it is only rightthat I would want to know the answers?”She Who Knows the Moon laughed softly, then, and put a gnarled hand over River’sknee. “Of course, child. Of course. The story is, after all, why you came, evenif you don’t realize it.”River felt a little more at ease. She put her hand over the old woman’s. Despitebeing so wrinkled, the hand was soft and warm.“Please, will you tell me the story of what happened, then?”The other sighed as she looked into River’s eyes. “That is why I have beenwaiting for you.”“Really? Well, I’m listening.”“The priestess Bright Star was like a sister to your mother. They found much joyin each other’s company. But then Bright Star was taken with a terrible illness.Despite everything that was done, it could not be cured. Day by day she grewworse as the sickness ate away at her insides. She suffered many different andmysterious afflictions as the sickness progressed and stole away her health.“Knowing that her end was near, she confided in your mother that she wished tobe laid to rest on Spirit Mountain. The request to be laid to rest withancestors is the right of those like her, or a chief, or a shaman.“Because Bright Star feared that she would not be able to make it there byherself and wanted to go there while she was still alive, she appealed to yourmother to make the journey with her and stay with her until the end so as to seeto it that she was laid to rest properly.”River swallowed back a lump in her throat. Her mother had never told her thetragic story. She was beginning to understand why Lone Willow would avoidspeaking of her friend and such a painful memory.“But your mother,” She Who Knows the Moon said, “was heavily pregnant withchild. With you. Still, Lone Willow would not be stopped from honoring therequest of her dear friend, even though Standing Bear forbade it.”River knew her mother’s strength. “She would have gone anyway.”“Yes,” the old woman said with a nod. “Standing Bear was in fear for his wifebecause she was so heavily pregnant, but your mother, like many women, would notbe stopped from anything that needed to be done right up until the baby came. Soit was that, together, Lone Willow and Bright Star set out on the journey toSprit Mountain. Your father and some of the other men accompanied them as far asthey were allowed. It was forbidden for them to cross the Bitterroot River.“The crossing of the Bitterroot to get to Spirit Mountain was difficult on yourmother and took nearly all of Bright Star’s remaining strength. Once theycrossed, Bright Star was in such pain from the sickness that was killing herthat she wept with every step until they were on the slopes of Spirit Mountain.She had brought with her a potion that the shaman, White Crow, had given her.She had but to take that potion and her suffering would be over. But she wantedto live long enough to see her friend give birth.“She did not have to wait long. As a great storm swept across the land, togetherthey found shelter in the cave Bright Star chose as her resting place for alltime. In the protection of that quiet cave, while the thunder and lightningshook the land all around and the rain poured from the dark sky, your mothergave birth to a girl child. She gave birth to you, there on Spirit Mountain. Itbrought great joy to Bright Star to see the new daughter of her friend.”River sat in astonishment. “I was born on Spirit Mountain?”She Who Knows the Moon nodded that it was so. “Because the storm was so violent,the Bitterroot River rose up with tall waves and pounding water. The storm hadmade the Bitterroot a dangerous torrent that carried uprooted trees and logs.There was no way your mother would risk crossing such treacherous currents in acanoe with her newborn child.“Bright Star, now that she had been able to hold her friend’s newborn in herarms and look into her bright eyes, wished to at last take the potion and endher terrible pain. Lone Willow was in great sorrow at the thought of Bright Stardying but wanted her friend’s agony to be over. She asked the spirits to helpBright Star make an easy journey into death.“But before she drank the potion, Bright Star had two requests of your mother.The first request of her dear friend was the honor of naming her newborn girlchild. She knew that because of the storm it would be some time before theraging river quieted enough for your mother to be able to leave Spirit Mountainand cross back to her people. As in all things, Bright Star, being a priestess,saw the storm as having come for a purpose and having meaning, and so she namedyou Raging River.”River wiped back her tears. “What was the second request?”“Bright Star drank down the potion that would release her from the fangs ofterrible pain, and then, before that potion let her slip into death, she kissedyour cheek and named you priestess to take her place.”It felt to River like the sky had fallen in on her. The enormity of it all wascrushing. It felt as if she didn’t know herself, as if she had never knownherself.River also sensed the room slowly spinning around her, and it wasn’t from thestory. It occurred to her that she should have asked what was in the drink shehad been given before so thoughtlessly downing it all.“Can you tell me what it is a priestess is supposed to do?” Raging River asked.“I know my place of authority with our people—and I very rarely use thatauthority—but I don’t know what it is, actually, that a priestess is supposed todo. What is it I’m meant to do?”She Who Knows the Moon considered for a time. “It is said that the duty of apriestess is to speak with our ancestors.”“They’re dead. You mean I’m supposed to speak with their spirits?”“Spirit Mountain has none but the dead. It is the duty of the priestess to go toSpirit Mountain, so that can only mean it must be her duty to speak with theirspirits.”“When is the priestess supposed to go there?”“When she is needed.”“How do I know when I’m needed?”“Only the priestess can decide that.”“How am I supposed to know what to do once I get there?”“Only the priestess can know that.”River sighed in frustration. “Well, I’ve already decided I must go there. It’sthe only way I can think of to call the Sky People. Is that my purpose? To callthe Sky People?”She Who Knows the Moon stared deeply into River’s eyes. “Only you can decidethat, child.”“Well, I guess I’ve already decided I must call the Sky People if I am to have achance to save our people. But how can I call the Sky People? You are named SheWho Knows the Moon, so you, of all people, should be able to tell me how I cando that.”The old woman offered a sad smile. “I’m afraid that time steals away knowledge.If there was once a way, the knowledge was lost long ago, long before I was everborn.”“Can you at least tell me if the Sky People are real?”“Child, I cannot tell you if the Sky People are real or if they are only a storyinvented to make people follow a law created by mere men.”“If it was a law created by men, they were very foolish men.”“Is it so foolish to say we must not kill?”“It is if it means we have to forfeit our precious lives.”Raging River could hear the full force of the storm sweeping into their village.Thunder crashed down and shook the ground. She needed to hurry on her way.But as she started to get up, River felt that her limbs were so weak that shecouldn’t make them move. The woven rug under her seemed to be spinning, and thenit seemed to come up to meet her.River realized she was lying on the floor.“What was in that drink you gave me?” she asked with slurred words.“Something to make you sleep and not go out into the fangs of a storm. Stormshave meaning, and you must not test this one. You will wake at dawn and then,when it is safe to go, you will be wide awake and able to leave.”As her eyes were closing, River wondered if evil spirits had called the storm toprevent her from calling the Sky People. And then the sweet darkness caressedher away."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9 [index_split_002.html#filepos4293]Standing outside the woven cloth over the doorway to the home of She Who Knowsthe Moon, River looked out at the first hint of pale violet at the horizon. Sheadjusted the war hammer she had stuck through her leather belt as she watchedthe early light of a new dawn gradually brighten. It wouldn’t be long before shecould greet the new sun.She adjusted the pack the old woman had made up for her and filled withprovisions she would need for her journey. She felt sad to be leaving her friendas well as leaving her village, but she was also filled with a sense of urgency.The Wolf People would be coming. If she delayed, they would kill every one ofher people before she could even try to get the help of the Sky People and hopeto return in time.The other thing that was always in the back of River’s mind was Morning Flower.She had to get her little sister back from her captors. She didn’t know how shewas to do that, she only knew that she had to find a way.With no time to waste, River slipped the bow over her shoulder, checked that herquiver was full of arrows, and then started making her way through the narrowpassageways of her village. Despite her fears and the reason for going, it feltgood to at least be on her way. She had talked enough about what needed to bedone. She had argued enough with her father and everyone else who thought shewas wrong.She was priestess. It was time to prove to herself that she was worthy of thetitle.Instead of sitting around like everyone else, waiting for killers to come killthem, at least she was doing something. She didn’t have any idea how she couldcall the Sky People, but if her people were to survive, she knew that somehow,she must.She hadn’t gone far through their village when Big Dog trotted up, tongue lolledoff to one side. His tail started wagging and his head dipped with his ears laidback with joy at the sight of her. When he reached her, he rubbed playfullyagainst the side of her leg. She gave his shoulder a pat to let him know she wasglad to see him as well.“Go home,” she told him, pointing. He sat down and looked up at her. When shestarted out again, he got up and trotted along beside her. She pointed back.“Big Dog, go home. You can’t come where I’m going.”Big Dog clearly didn’t care what she said. He was going, whether she permittedit or not. He was stubborn, and she knew that if she tried to make him stayhome, he would wait awhile and then follow her at a distance. River sighed asshe walked with Big Dog at her side. She thought that maybe, after a time, hewould let her go and turn back for home. If he didn’t, she supposed it couldn’thurt to have the company.No one met her to wish her well on her journey. It felt like the whole villagewas against her. When she saw people in the passageways between homes, theylooked away and turned their backs before disappearing. Everyone was angry withher. It was a lonely feeling.She understood how Bright Star, the woman who had given Raging River her nameand then named her the priestess, felt apart from her own people. Riverunderstood why she lived such a lonely life. Being the priestess was a greathonor, but it also carried a price of loneliness. At least River’s mother hadbeen her friend.And at least River had Big Dog for a friend. It felt good to have such loyalcompanion with her. It was hard to remember back to when he was a pup so smallthat she could hold him in her hands. Now fully grown, Big Dog was fiercelyprotective of her, so besides being good company, he was the only one willing tofight to protect her. She decided that his insistence on coming along wasprobably wiser than her thinking he should stay behind.As the bright rim of the sun broke above the horizon out beyond the grasslands,the buildings of the Sun People glowed a reddish violet color. It was afamiliar, beautiful sight, but she didn’t take the time to admire it. Instead,after greeting the new dawn as she worked her way out of the village, she wasfinally able to turn her back to her home place and the new sun and head outtoward the mountains.Those mountains, looking so distant out ahead of her, reached up into the sky tobe brightly lit from halfway up by the first rays of the new dawn. At night,when the sun went behind those mountains, they became a dark, jagged mass.At first, after leaving the village behind, she walked beside the meanderingstream in the valley between the sparsely wooded hillsides. The stream was fullfrom the rain and rushing swiftly. She loved the sound of the rushing water, butshe knew it could hide the sounds of danger, so she continually scanned thehillsides for any sign of the Wolf People warriors.River had to be careful in selecting spots when she needed to cross in order toavoid difficult terrain that would slow her down. The ice-cold water coming downfrom the mountains was up to her knees when she had to wade across gravellyspots. The current was strong, making it difficult to keep her balance. Big Dogsimply jumped in and bounded across or swam to the opposite bank. He loved thecold water. When he shook it off on the opposite side, River tried to stay clearlest he soak her.Broad sandy areas beside the stream in many places made for easy traveling. BigDog made frequent side excursions to smell the bushes and rocks and mark them ashis. He thought this adventure out into the countryside was great fun. Riverwished she could enjoy it as much as he did, but with the worries on her mind,she couldn’t.Farther upstream, the water had cut steep walls through the hills. Ordinarilythere was room to walk between the stream and the walls, but with the height ofthe water from the storm, the water ran from wall to wall on either side, so shewas forced to start her climb up the hillsides.Finally reaching the top of a high hill, she was rewarded with a good view backout over the grasslands. Down below, far away, just before the sea of grasslandsstretched to the horizon, she could see her village. People moved throughpassageways, going about their business. She wondered if those people wouldstill be alive when she returned.When River turned around, a man was standing not far away, watching her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10 [index_split_002.html#filepos4409]When she first saw the man out of the corner of her eye, it nearly scared Riverout of her skin. Her first thought was that it had to be one of the Wolf Peoplecome to kill her. He looked to be a warrior. She feared they might havesurrounded her.River had an arrow nocked and aimed at him before he took the first step in herdirection. Big Dog was watching him but wasn’t growling. She had always beentaught to trust her dog. She held her aim as she gathered her wits.As he came closer, she saw at last that it was the tall, strong figure ofWalking Stag, but he looked different. He had red cloth tied around each upperarm. He wore a sleeveless buckskin vest. His long hair was pulled back and woundinto a braid with the same red cloth. He carried a spear, also with a piece ofred cloth, tied around the shaft behind the balance point. Black lines had beenpainted up across his cheeks.She had never seen him with the red cloth and black paint before. She thought itsuited him well. It made him look formidable.“What are you doing here?” she demanded as she lowered her bow and replaced thearrow in the quiver.Big Dog sat protectively beside her. Even though he knew the man well and wasn’tgrowling, she supposed he had never seen him looking the way he did now and thatmade him suspicious.“I have come to watch over you until you reach sacred ground.”She frowned at him. “Protect me from what?”“You say the Wolf People are coming. I thought I would help protect you fromthem until you can go to call the Sky People.”Raging River was at once angry and grateful. She was angry that he would followher, but she was grateful that he had. She was even happier that he believed shewould call the Sky People.“And what if the Wolf People come to capture me? You fear breaking our law, sothey will take you and torture you and stake you to the ground for animals toeat.”He firmly set the butt end of his spear on the ground. He stared off to the darkmountains where she was headed.“I thought about the things you said. You charged me with protecting our people.You are one of our people.”“I charged you with gathering together other strong men and preparing them todefend the village.”He studied her eyes before answering. “Why would you choose me? Is it becauseyou favor me? Or is it because Chief Standing Bear said that you are to be mywife?”Even though she was in a hurry, River wanted to disabuse him of any such idea.“My father said what he did because you were the only young man in his line ofsight at the moment, not because he meant anything by it.”“Maybe he did mean it. He is your father and our chief. He would want you tohave a strong husband.”“Even if he did mean it, it is not for him to choose the husband of the villagepriestess.”He sheepishly looked away. River hadn’t meant to shame him, but she didn’t havetime for this. She started walking west.Walking Stag, looking to put his feelings aside, jumped to catch up and walkbeside her.“Then why did you choose me?” he pressed.“I chose you because you frequently stand close to Chief Standing Bear.”“What does that mean?”“It means you seek to be a leader. Since you long to be a leader, I gave you thetask a leader should have. That task is to prepare other men and protect ourpeople. It is a task of responsibility, a task for a leader.”“I see. Well… thank you.”“I gave you that task to protect the village. I did not tell you to follow afterme.”He lifted his chin as he looked ahead. “You are the priestess and have animportant job to do to protect our people. If you are killed, you can’t do thatjob and you won’t be able to save our people. I know what you said I must do,but I decided I should come and make sure you didn’t have any trouble, at leastuntil you get to sacred land. Once I make sure you are safely to BitterrootRiver, then I will go back to do as you asked of me.”River nodded as she kept walking. “Have you collected men?”“Yes. Many trust in me and want to follow what I say. But I am not sure what totell them. We are not killers.”“You are sons and brothers and fathers, are you not? And you love the people ofour village, do you not?”“Yes, of course.”“Picture in your mind their terror as they are being killed by the Wolf Peoplefor no reason. Imagine the blood, the pain, of those you love. Does that notmake you angry?”Instead of answering, he asked a question. “Is that how you were able to killGreat Hawk?”River thought how to answer. Finally, she tapped the center of her chest as shelooked over at him.“In here, my heart burned with fear for my little sister. In here, I also burnedwith hatred for men who would harm her. That is what you must do.” She reachedover and tapped the center of his chest. “You must have righteous hate here, inyour heart.”He nodded but didn’t say anything for a time.“I just don’t know if we can do that,” he finally said.River shrugged. “Then everyone you love will be slaughtered or taken captive tobe tortured and then killed. You will see it happening before your eyes beforeone of them rushes up to you, screaming a battle cry, and cuts your belly opento make you die slowly so that you will see it all happen to your people.”Walking Stag let out a long breath. “You are making me angry to hear suchthings.”“Good. You keep thinking about that as you go back. Work the injustice of it inyour mind like you would finger a worry stone. You keep getting angrier untilyou no longer care about the law as much as you care about those you love. Youtell the others you gather what I told you will happen and that you will notallow it, and that they must not allow it, or you all will be a willing party tothe killing of our people. You make sure they are so angry they will want tokill men who would do such things.”He nodded. “Will you be back by then?”She looked over. “I hope so.”He nodded again. “I hope so, too. Somehow, you give me fire in my heart.”River smiled. “This is not pleasant business, Walking Stag, but when I saw allthe blood shooting out of Great Hawk’s neck as he was taking Flower away fromus, it felt good. I wanted to kill them all and save Morning Flower. But tothink back on it, it was not pleasant business, killing a man.“Remember, these Wolf People who come will come for one purpose only. They willbe coming to kill us all. You and your men keep that in your mind, and keep rageburning in your hearts.”“Raging River in our hearts?”She smiled a little. “If it helps you, then yes, keep Priestess Raging River inyour hearts as you defend our people. You all have the skills necessary, just asI did. We all hunt and take large animals. We all use arrows, spears, andknives. Our skill with them is what feeds our people. Use the skills you alreadyhave to protect them.”By the time they reached Bitterroot River, it was late in the day. Beyond abroad river valley ahead, she could see the dark shape of Spirit Mountain risingup before her. The sun was already behind the mountain, leaving the light togrow dim.“It will be dark soon,” Walking Stag said. “We should make camp here for thenight.”“No,” River told him. “I must get to Spirit Mountain and call the Sky People.There is no time to spare. I will cross the river now and keep going until it istoo dark to travel any farther. That way I will be closer when there is light inthe morning.”He sighed, not liking the idea, but he nodded his understanding of her purpose.He pointed with his spear toward the tall marsh grass.“I see the crossing canoe.”After they untied the canoe that was always left there for just this purpose andrighted it, they dragged it to a bank where she could get in. He helped get BigDog in it with her.“Thank you, Walking Stag, for seeing me safely to the sacred land. Go back, now,and help get our people ready.”“I will. Return safely to us, Raging River.”She had to make Big Dog lie down lest he tip the canoe over as the strong youngman, the first strong warrior of the Sun People, shoved the canoe out into themoving water. River started paddling for the opposite bank, worried about whatshe might find ahead."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11 [index_split_002.html#filepos4526]By the time River made it across the marshland on the opposite side of theBitterroot and then across the broad river valley to where the forest thickenedinto a confusing tangle of trees, limbs, and brush, it was too dark to find away to go any farther. From what she could see of Spirit Mountain while therehad still been light, it was going to be a difficult climb in places.As much as she hated stopping, the moon, which would have helped light her wayfor a while longer, was completely hidden by heavy clouds. With the cloud cover,there were not even stars to help. It would simply be too dangerous to continueon in the dark. She couldn’t help anyone if she stepped in a hole and broke herleg or slipped and fell from a ledge because she couldn’t see the edge.Resigned to making camp for the night, River cut some pine boughs for beddingand spread them out under the sheltering limbs of a big spruce tree. She laidher blanket over the pine boughs to have a bed up off the cold ground. It was achilly night, but she didn’t want to spend the time collecting wood and making afire.Once she lay down and called him, Big Dog came close and curled up beside her,as he had done since he was a frightened pup in need of comfort. With Big Dogbeside her, she was warm enough to try to get some needed sleep. With his furcoat, Big Dog was enjoying the cooler nights.As she lay close to her warm dog in the darkness, animals in the strange woodsmade frightening whoops, clicks, and howls. Whenever there was a worrisome callfrom the woods, Big Dog lifted his head to growl. But they were both tired andbefore long they were asleep. She trusted that if anything happened, he would beup in an instant to protect her.Noisy crows up in nearby pines woke her at first light. River yawned andstretched. Big Dog was eager to get up. He always woke excited that it was a newday. It always took River a little longer.She ate a quick breakfast of dried fish, which she shared with Big Dog, and someroots She Who Knows the Moon had packed for her. Big Dog stood beside her as sheate, his eyebrows bunched in concentration as he stared at the fish in herhands, waiting for her to share some with him. She had trained him never to takefood from her unless offered. It wasn’t a big meal, but it was enough. Aftereating, she quickly gathered up everything and set out.Even though it was still cloudy, by the time she was ready to start out it waslight enough for them to easily make their way through the woods. Before theygot too far into heavy woods, River spent a bit of time studying the lay of theland, looking for terrain that would make for natural trails. Once she founddeer trails through the brush in the direction she wanted to go, they led her tothe easiest way to start up the mountain.Following the animal trails and the natural lay of the land, she began to makeout signs that people had come this same way before. It was reassuring to knowthat she was on the right trail as it wound its way through dense spruce anddeeply shaded woods. Big Dog explored the fern beds as she kept to the trail,occasionally pouncing to flush out a small animal. He was a born hunter. As thetrail began to climb, there were natural switchbacks that helped her and Big Dogstart the ascent.For the most part, Big Dog stayed close by, but now and then he was sidetrackedsmelling things only he could smell. River was in too urgent a hurry to wait forhim. Sometimes he would track those smells into the underbrush and vanish. Shekept on going at a quick pace. He always eventually emerged and caught up withher again.After a time, as she was breathing hard with the effort, she came across thefirst of the caves she had been told about. It was more like a recess in therock of the mountain created by a jut of rock overhead. From what She Who Knowsthe Moon had told her, important people in the past were laid to rest in suchplaces.Inside the wide maw, River encountered a terrible smell. She tried to ignore itand found a natural shelf of sorts along the back of the shallow opening. Theremains of three bodies lay on the shelf. They were tightly wrapped with stripsof cloth and leather. One was decorated with beads sewn along a broad leatherstrip laid down the length of the body.There were no names on any of the remains. Since no one visited the burialground, names would be pointless. From what the old woman had told her, theheight up on the mountain held no significance or importance. The only thingthat mattered was that the remains were laid to rest on the sacred ground ofSpirit Mountain. For all River knew, these remains on the bottom might have beenthe most important ancestors laid to rest first in the more easily accessedspots.Inspecting the remains, she was able to tell that they were of great age. Shedidn’t recognize the designs of the beads. Fearing to be disrespectful, andfearing that their spirits might be watching her, she lifted the feet of onejust a little to test the weight. They were feather-light, which meant it hadbeen laid to rest long, long ago and the bodies were now mostly dust.Even as ancient as these remains were, they still had a strong, unpleasant odorabout them. All three had that same smell that caused River’s nose to wrinkle.Big Dog didn’t like the smell at all and stayed back outside the opening of thecave.It wasn’t the smell of death, but rather something that had probably been pouredon the bodies to keep animals from disturbing them. It had obviously worked,since the cave was large, with a wide opening, and not at all deep, yet none ofthe wrapping appeared to be disturbed in any way. Big Dog, as curious as he wasabout dead things, didn’t want anything to do with them.River was happy to leave the cave and the repugnant smell and start back up themountain. It wasn’t long before she realized that the trail wound up themountain the way it did in order to go past natural openings and caves. Shecould see a few openings to caves that looked inaccessible without somedifficult rock climbing. Since there were so many caves to explore on the trail,she decided to leave those alone for the time being.Many of the burial places were simply low recesses under rock shelves. Some werevertical splits in the rock face. She could see wrapped remains placed deepwithin the narrow cracks in the mountain. Other burial spots were natural cavesthat had been worked as necessary to open them up, or to get into larger cavernsbeyond.What they all had in common was that they had bodies placed in them, and all thebodies had that same repulsive smell to keep animals away. Many of the cavesstill had a lot of room left for a great many more burials. A few had no roomleft.At midday, after a strenuous climb, River stopped to have something to eat. Shesat on a ledge of rock that jutted out enough to give her a grand view of thevalley below and the mountains beyond. She and Big Dog shared some more driedfish, along with strips of venison jerky, and then they were quickly on theirway again.In late afternoon, nearing what looked to be the top of the mountain as far asshe could tell by brief glimpses through openings in the trees, the trailabruptly came to an end. River sat on a rock off to the side to catch herbreath. She was sweating and tired from the daylong climb.She was disappointed that she had not found any evidence of the Sky People. Shedidn’t have any idea what she had hoped to find, but whatever it was, she hadn’tfound it.As she sat resting, trying to decide what to do next, she noticed that the waythe trail ended seemed odd. It simply stopped at the face of a large boulder.Curious, she got up and inspected the abrupt ending of the trail.There was a lot of rock piled up, as if there had been a rockslide, but therewas one big boulder sitting in such a way that it was the primary block in thepath. The boulder sat against a rock face to the left side of the trail that wastoo steep to climb. To the right was a drop-off down the mountain. When sheleaned out and looked down, she could see the tops of tall spruce trees farbelow. Climbing down and around looked just as impossible as climbing up andaround. The smaller rocks piled in around the boulder could be removed with somework, but the big boulder was far too big to move.That struck her as deliberate.When she turned back to the face of the rock blocking the trail, River pausedand frowned. Under roots and debris, she could just see a faint image on therock. Her people often painted things on rock walls—animals, people, stories.This was much like those, and yet it looked to be very different.“What do you think this is, Big Dog?” she murmured half to herself.She used her hand to brush away the lichen, moss, webs of hairlike roots, andaccumulated dirt to get a better look at what had been painted there. Once shehad cleared it off, she blinked at what she was seeing painted on the rock.The painted images were clearly people made with black lines. They looked likeregular people, with legs with feet and arms with hands, but the crazy thing wasthat their heads were all big and round with no features. All of the figures hadthe same big, round heads. None had eyes, noses, or mouths. Those big emptyheads were somehow frightening.They looked otherworldly.River had seen lots of rock paintings before, done both by her people andothers. Yet in all her life she had never seen images like these. They gave hergoose bumps up her arms.She knew, she just knew in her heart and soul, that these had to be drawings ofthe Sky People. What she didn’t know was why they were painted there on thatrock blocking the trail.Once she cleared away more of the dirt and roots, she saw what was even moreworrisome. Under the drawings of Sky People there was a drawing of two largecrossed bones. Crossed bones were a sign of extreme danger.The big rock had been placed there to block the trail and keep anyone from goingany farther. The crossed bones painted on that rock were a warning that if youwent any farther, you would die."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12 [index_split_002.html#filepos4643]River used the war hammer she was carrying to pound the broad side of her knifeblade into a young, slender maple tree, first angling into one spot, thenangling the blade in the opposite direction a short distance away in order topop out large chunks of wood. In that way, she was quickly able to cut down thetree. Once she had felled it across the trail, she cut off the top with all thebranches so that she ended up with a good length of tree trunk a little fatteraround than her arm.She muscled the tree trunk up and jammed the end into a small opening betweenthe boulder that was blocking the trail and the sheer wall to the left side ofit. She forced a big rock between the wall and the tree trunk to give hersomething to lever against.Ordinarily the warning of crossed bones drawn on the boulder would have stoppedher. Such warnings always had frightening consequences for people who ignoredthem. She couldn’t imagine anything more frightening than everyone she knewbeing slaughtered.Making sure Big Dog was clear, Raging River grunted with the effort of pushingthe long log lever. The tree trunk bent a little. When it sprang back she usedthe momentum of it springing back and forth to increase the power of each push.When the boulder made a grating sound as it started to move, she repositionedthe rock braced between the tree trunk and the cliff wall to get more leverage.River grunted with the effort of a big push. The rocks packed in around theboulder fell free as the boulder began to tip outward. When it did, she rammedhalf the length of the tree trunk into the gap and gave the tree trunk a mightypull against the boulder.The boulder rolled over just enough to take it to the lip of the trail. With herback against the rock wall, she put both feet on the boulder and then pushedwith all her strength. The boulder tipped and began to crumble the ground at theside of the trail. As more and more of the dirt and rock at the side of thetrail fell away, all of a sudden the boulder toppled out over the edge.Panting to catch her breath, River stood at the side of the trail and watchedthe massive rock crash down through the forest. Treetops whipped back and forthas the boulder struck the trunks. It was some time before it finally came torest and silence once again settled over the mountain.“Come on, Big Dog. Let’s go.”He jumped up to follow her as she hurried on up the now open trail. She didn’tencounter any more caves as the trail switched back and forth, going higher onthe remainder of the mountain. The higher up she climbed, the more cracks shesaw in the massive rock formations. She knew that each winter the water settingin cracks could begin to break rock apart. In several places she had to stepcarefully over wide splits in the rock that could have trapped her leg had shestepped in them.As late in the day as it was, and as gloomy as the light was getting under thelow, dark clouds, she knew she wasn’t going to be able to keep going muchlonger. She knew she was going to have to spend the night on Spirit Mountain.More troubling, though, was that she hadn’t found anything yet that could be ofany help.As she went up the switchbacks, she began to ascend into the lower reaches ofthe clouds. Cold mist prickled against her face. The fog reduced visibility thefarther she went. The higher she went, the denser the fog became. Everythingtook on a ghostly gray cast.River decided that if those dark clouds began to release rain, she would have togo back down and stay in one of the caves, smell or no smell. While she knew itwould be necessary, it was an unsettling thought. This was a place of ancestorspirits. She didn’t know if they would like to be disturbed.After climbing up several more steep switchbacks, River came upon another cave.It was similar to the others, though a little deeper. Gnarly tree roots fromscraggly, windblown trees above the opening seemed to be holding the crumblingrock around the cave in place. Some of the roots hung down as if to veil theopening.The rock near the mountaintop was more cracked and crumbling apart than it hadbeen down lower. Much of the higher trail had already fallen away, so she fearedthat with her weight part of it might even give way if she didn’t stepcarefully. At least the fog hid the dizzying sight of the drop should the trailcollapse underfoot. She was relieved to find that the area around the caveopening was wide enough to be stable. The trail had dwindled down and ended atthe cave, so there was nothing beyond. All around, sections of stone slabs thathad cracked away from the face of the mountain stood upright, like sentinels inthe mist.River ducked inside. The remains of only one body lay in the cave. The smell wasjust as repugnant as in the other caves. Big Dog had no desire to be anywherenear the smell. He took off to find aromas more interesting to him.Even though it was darker yet in the cave, there was no doubt in River’s mindthat she had found the body of one of the Sky People.She stood in shock in the center of the chamber, staring at the figure lying ona flat stone table just big enough to support it. There were stone chipslittering the floor of the cave, telling her that this boulder had been chippedaway to prepare a flat place for the body to be laid to rest.The body had a big round head just like the drawings on the boulder. She staredin astonishment.Rather than being wrapped in cloth and strips of leather like all the others shehad found, this body was clothed in the strangest substance she had ever seen.It looked something like cloth, but the fabric was smooth and shiny. Even thoughit was shiny like metal, it wrinkled the same as any cloth. There was a beltaround the waist with strange objects attached to it. Metallic rings circled theankles and wrists. Boots similar to the material on the body covered the feet.Gloves with finger pads covered the hands.But it was the head that was most startling. It was relatively round, withsymmetrical indentations and ridges up along each side. After cleaning away thelayer of dust, she saw that there was some kind of writing on the sides, but ithad long ago eroded away. Here and there on the head there were small raisedareas that were different on each side. The most prominent aspect of the wholething, though, was the glossy black front of the head.She realized that what she was looking at couldn’t actually be the head of theSky person. She thought it must be a covering of some sort.River remembered well the mask with the hooked beak she had taken from GreatHawk. She had seen many other people with masks, most notably other Wolf People.No one, not even the Sky People, could have such a perfectly smooth, hard,shiny, black face with no features.What she was looking at could only be a mask."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13 [index_split_002.html#filepos4760]River worked at the edges, or what she assumed were edges, of the black portionof the mask. It fit so perfectly with the white portion of the rest of the mask,even though it was slightly recessed, that she couldn’t even get a fingernail inbetween the black and the white. She wasn’t even sure they were separate pieces.For all she knew, it could all be one piece that had been painted. Even thatthought didn’t seem right, because she had never seen any paint so smooth or soshiny or with edges so sharp.She kept working around the mask, trying to find a way to get it off. There werethe same metallic rings around the neck, below the mask, as there were aroundthe wrists and ankles. She could find no opening in any of those rings that shecould work to get apart. She stood at the head of the Sky person and tried topull the whole round, masklike covering off the head, but with the way it was sosolidly attached to the rest of the clothes, it would not budge. She feared shewould pull the body from its resting place if she pulled any harder, so shestopped.The body was heavier than the others she had found. When she pressed against theshiny fabric she could feel arms and legs underneath. Pressing with her fingerleft squishy indentations. It didn’t seem to have turned to dust like theothers. She thought that was strange, considering that it had to have beenplaced there back in the time of the earliest stories of the Sun People, backwhen they were given their laws.As a last resort, even though she thought it might be disrespectful, Riverpulled the war hammer from where it hung at her waist. She tapped on the shinyblack mask with the stone face of the war hammer, but it did nothing. She hit itharder with the same lack of result.She finally lifted the war hammer back over her head and brought it down withall the force she could, trying to break the mask apart.To her surprise, the hammer simply bounced off. It didn’t even leave a mark onthe shiny black mask covering the face of the mysterious Sky person.She wondered if the face was so hideous and frightening that maybe she didn’treally want to see it.But she did. She really did. So, she repeatedly struck the mask with the warhammer, thinking that she could weaken it and eventually it would crack andbreak open. Even that didn’t work. She put all of her muscle into each swing.Nothing.Panting from the effort, she finally gave up. While she wanted to look at theface of one of the Sky People, what she really needed was living Sky People.Looking at the face of a dead one wasn’t really going to accomplish anythingother than to satisfy her curiosity.River wondered, then, how in the world she was supposed to accomplish what shehad set out to do. How could she call them? How was she ever going to be able toget their help?Unable to have any success with the mask, she moved down the body to inspect thethings attached to the belt. None were like anything she had ever seen before.They had been made with a kind of precision none of her people could attain.While she had always considered some of her arrowheads a marvel of precision,these things were on a whole different level.Whatever the objects were and whatever they were made of, they were the productof a people far more advanced than anything she had ever seen before.River explored every little detail of all the things attached to the belt. Therewere round, colored knobs that gave when she pressed them. Others that stuck upturned freely. Some turned with a clicking sound. All of them had mysterioussymbols and lines beside them.She moved over to the strange armband on the left arm of the Sky person. It hada flat area with different-colored round buttons to each side. River found thatby pressing small little levers on the underside of the band holding it on thearm, she was able to detach it.Once she had it off, River started testing different places on the face. Beingan odd shape, it was difficult to hold and kept slipping from her grip, so shewrapped it around her own arm the way it had been wrapped around the arm of thedead Sky person and clicked the ends back together. That made it easier to pressthe colored buttons. Some clicked when she turned them. Others that didn’t turnmade a clicking sound when she pressed on them.Getting tired of the smell inside the cave, she went outside and sat backagainst the rock wall. As she sat there, she played with the thing wrappedaround her forearm. She pushed at the round, colored studs and turned knobs.And then, when she pressed a round red button, the thing on her arm made a briefnoise. River froze. When it went quiet, she pressed the red bump again, but heldit down longer. This time the armband let out crackling sounds.A flat shiny area on the face of the armband suddenly lit up. Astonished, Rivertried pushing her finger around on the shiny surface that had lit up. Light fromunderneath seemed to follow her finger. She slid her finger around in a circle.Light chased the movement of her finger. She pushed her finger in the center ofthe circle she had made. The whole flat shiny surface lit up red and the armbandcrackled with sound. The circle she had made pulsed with light. She pressed thecenter again and it lit up with a brighter red light.Words crackled from the device, but they made no sense to her. They were unlikeany spoken words she had ever heard before. She wasn’t even really sure theywere words. It was more like muffled, garbled sounds along with cracklingnoises.As she continued to play with the armband, that was the most she was able tomake it do. As it grew dark, she grew weary and frustrated. Nothing was working,nothing was helping.For all of her brave talk of calling the Sky People, River realized she didn’thave any idea what she was doing. She didn’t have a clue as to how to call theSky People. She had only been fooling herself into thinking that as priestessshe knew more than everyone else and that she would be able to bring help.River wiped tears back off her cheeks. She did know one thing. Her people weregoing to be murdered. She knew she was never going to see Morning Flower again.The life she knew and loved with her people would soon end. Suffering and deathwere all that lay ahead.Alone, cold, and deeply depressed, River pulled the blanket from her pack. Shedidn’t like the smell in the cave, but she was getting numb to it. With rainjust starting to come down, she knew she couldn’t stay out in it. She picked upher pack and withdrew into the cave.When she called Big Dog, he came to be by her, even though he didn’t like thesmell in the cave.Feeling more miserable than she had ever felt in her life, River curled up inher blanket. Big Dog rested his head on her hip.She had no rage left.She cried herself to sleep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14 [index_split_002.html#filepos4877]River woke with a start. She had heard a sound, a distant rumble of some sort,something like thunder, but different. She didn’t know if she had heard it, orif she had dreamt it. Big Dog was gone, probably off exploring.She sat up when she thought she sensed the ground beginning to tremble. As thesensation increased, she saw small stones dancing around on the floor of thecave. Small bits of rock fell from the ceiling, followed down by trails of dustand dirt.Running out of the cave, she looked around but didn’t see anything. Theearly-morning sky was much brighter than it had been the day before. There werestill clouds, but not like the ones that had brought rain the night before.These were a thin and wispy white.She called Big Dog, but he didn’t respond. Having that wild streak in him, hesometimes went off on his own for a time, so she wasn’t alarmed.When she heard another sound, she looked up just in time to see a sharp point oflight glimmer high up in the sky, like a bright star in the day.Suddenly, a long streak shot down out of the sky. It looked like a shooting staror a streak of cloud as thin as sinew thread coming straight down out of thesky. High up, what looked like a perfectly cone-shaped cloud puffed out aroundthe tip of the streak.Then the ground shook with a resounding boom.The streak of cloud flashed down out of the sky to hit the ground right in frontof her. Dust blew up into the air. Trees all around bent back, their branchesthrashing.River fell back both with the suddenness of it all and in fright. The airshimmered the way it did above a fire. A piercing shriek hurt her ears as abright light streaked down through the thread of cloud. River covered her facewith her forearm with the armband as she cowered back against the cliff wall.When the world again went silent, she carefully took her arm away from her eyes.River was astonished to see a tall figure standing before her. It looked in away similar to the remains of the Sky person in the cave, but the clothes onthis figure were a dull black with varied designs on it. They fit better, too,revealing the shape of a muscular man. There was a similar big round mask overthe head, but it was not quite as large and the shape was different, too. Therewere rows of indentations along the sides. Like the rest of the clothes, thehead mask was also a dull black color, with glossy black over the front of theface, similar to the one in the cave.There could be no doubt. Even though the clothes and mask were somewhatdifferent, this was one of the Sky People standing before her.River could have jumped with joy, except that she was too scared to stand.The figure reached up and touched the side of the mask. The shiny black part ofthe mask in front made a sound as it instantly vanished up into the top part.Inside the mask, a man, possibly the most beautiful man she had ever seen,smiled out at her.River shot to her feet. She couldn’t hold back her own grin with the relief andexcitement of seeing that it was a man and not some terrifying beast.The Sky man pointed at his mouth. He rolled his hand in a motion like he wantedsomething. River frowned. He nodded encouragement as he rolled his hand again.“I don’t know what you want,” she said.He nodded as if excited and then rolled his hand again.“I’m sorry. I don’t know what you mean. Are you saying that you want something?Can you tell me? Can you speak?”He nodded then and held up a finger, as if he wanted her to wait a moment.“Ah,” he said at last, fussing with the adjustments on his own armband. Hisarmband was not separate, like the one she had, but instead it seemed molded into be part of his outfit. “There we go. I have your language zeroed in, now.”“You speak my language?”He smiled again. “I can now. I just needed a sample to fix in on. I have itlocked in now.”River was trembling. “Thank the spirits. Thank you for coming. I didn’t know ifyou would.”“I was on patrol in the area when I got the distress call. It’s very strangebecause it’s a form of signal that I don’t recognize. It’s possible it’s one nolonger used. That would mean it would have to be quite ancient. I was lucky topick it up at all. Where is the one who sent the distress call? Can you showme?”“Yes,” she said, “we are in distress. My people are all in distress. We are ingreat need of the help of the Sky People. I came to try to call you. The lawsyou have given us are about to cost the lives of my people.”“The laws we gave you?”“Yes. Those laws from the Sky People have already killed a great many people.More are about to be killed, all killed because of the laws you gave us. I mustsave my sister. She was captured—”“Slow down.” He frowned. “The Sky People?” Then his head lifted back as heunderstood. He pointed a finger up at the sky. “The Sky People. All right, Isee. You mean those like me?”“Yes,” she said as she nodded furiously. “Sky People.”“First, what is your name?”“I am Raging River—”“Raging River,” he repeated, as if testing the sound of her name. “I’m Tom. JustTom.”“Thank you for coming, Tom-just-Tom. We must—”“No, no,” he said, smiling as she waved a hand. “My name is Tom. People who knowme call me Tom.”“People call me River.”“All right, River, nice to meet you.”“There is little time—”“Where did you get that?” he asked, pointing at the armband she was wearing.“That has to be what generated the distress call. Did you find it?”River gestured back into the cave. He immediately went in to have a look forhimself. He seemed astonished by what he saw. He walked all around the remainson the stone, looking with great care.Once he had looked them over carefully, he pressed a thumb against the side ofhis hand. “Control, this is Commander Tom. I’ve located the source of thedistress call.”From inside his mask River could hear the crackle of a female voice say, “Whatis the source?”He bent over the remains on the stone slab, looking, then wiped dust and dirtoff of a raised area near the shoulder.“This is old. Beyond old, actually. The name looks like… R. Collins.”“Hold a moment, Commander, while I check,” came the female voice from inside hismask.River pointed. “How is there a voice in your mask?”“My—? Oh, you mean my helmet. It’s a way I communicate with my people.” Hesmiled. “With the other Sky People.”She decided that in his language, “helmet” must be the word for “mask.” He had afriendly voice that put her at ease. Even though she liked his voice, Riverdidn’t really understand much of what he was saying.“When your people came here before”—she swept a hand toward the dead Sky personon the slab—“they gave us our laws. Because of those laws, my people have beenmurdered and our women taken as slave wives.” She could feel tears of ragespringing up at the corners of her eyes. “Now, because of the laws you gave us,all my people are about to be murdered. All because of you Sky People! You musthelp me. There is no time—”“Got it,” the voice in his mask crackled. He held his hand up to River,signaling her to wait while he listened. “You aren’t going to believe this,Commander. The remains you found are one Rebecca Collins.”“Doesn’t sound familiar,” he said.“It wouldn’t,” the female voice said. “She was a crew member on a primitiveexploration vessel. It was designated Twelve Twenty-three David.”He put the tips of his fingers to his forehead for a moment, thinking. “You’vegot to be kidding,” he said at last, his head coming back up. “A TwelveTwenty-three would have to have been, I don’t know, back before the Jardincolonies were established, right?”“That’s right. A portion of the records sent back from Twelve Twenty-three Davidsurvives in the archives, but they were badly fragmented. The communicationsystems back then were not designed for such distances, and on top of that theship was breaking up.”“What were they even doing out here?” Commander Tom asked the female voice inhis mask. He sounded deeply concerned.“The record indicates Twelve Twenty-three David had a nav or auto guidancefailure of some kind that sent them out there. They were desperately trying torepair unspecified, serious hardware failures in a drive unit they couldn’t shutdown. They lost directional control and the core flared, sending them beyond therange of ships at that time and into what was then uncharted territory.”“Does it say what happened to them?”“Let’s see… It looks like they had critical damage and were looking for asurvivable planet that could sustain them in the hopes of eventually beingrescued. The record shows that they sent emergency teams to several planets ontheir way past. None were survivable, so the crews returned.“Rebecca Collins was in command of the last team sent out. She reported thatthey found a Langstrom-class planet. The record shows that the team returned toTwelve Twenty-three David to help with an emergency evacuation of the crew alongwith the supplies they would need to survive.”“Then why is she the only one down here?”“Data is incomplete, but it looks like their ship disintegrated and all crewmembers were lost immediately after the team returned and before they couldevacuate. Protocol would have dictated that she would go up last. The recordassumed Rebecca Collins had returned to her ship just before the entire crew waslost when the ship broke up.”“She didn’t make it back to her ship,” Commander Tom said. He took a deepbreath. “She is buried down here.”“If she didn’t make it back to her doomed ship then she was the only survivor,even though the record indicates all souls were lost. The type of personalrescue beacon of that era didn’t have a far enough range to reach help. Since itwas assumed she died with her crew no rescue was attempted. For that reason,nothing is known of what she did down on that planet.”“It appears she lived out the rest of her life here with the indigenous people,”Commander Tom said.He pressed some colored knobs on one of the boxes on the dead Sky woman’s belt.River was surprised when lights flashed on the armband she was wearing.Commander Tom took River’s wrist and turned her arm so he could see the symbolsthat lit up on the shiny surface.“The biodata show she had to have survived here for quite a while,” he reportedto the female voice in his mask. “She was quite an advanced age when she died.The scan shows a variety of health problems, but a blockage in the main arteryof her heart was what eventually ended her life. Her suit helped with lifesupport as long as it could. When she died, her helmet and suit closedautomatically to preserve her remains. Didn’t do any good. There was no onewithin range to receive the End of Life notice.”“Any idea what she did there for all that time?”Commander Tom looked at River while he spoke to the voice in his mask.“Apparently, she played God.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15 [index_split_002.html#filepos4994]River followed Tom out of the cave. She didn’t understand a lot of what he hadtalked about to the voice in his mask, but she had much to tell him, and theyhad no time to waste. She needed him to lift the laws given to them so long ago.River was about to again try to explain things to him when a sound she knew alltoo well made her turn just in time to see a Wolf People warrior, painted infull war paint, coming out of nowhere to lunge in at her with a knife. Shedeliberately fell back away from him, barely in time. He missed with his slashand stumbled. She was puzzled to see that his arms were bloody. He caughthimself and turned to dive for her with his knife held high to stab into her ashe came down.At the same time, she saw another man—the leader she’d seen before with thefeathers in his headband, the one she had shot through the arm with anarrow—driving a spear toward Tom’s face as he turned to the sound of the warcry.It seemed like she could see it all happening at once.Just as the first man was coming down and about to stab River, Commander Tomreached around the leader coming at him with the spear. A kind of blue light shehad never seen before lit from something in Tom’s hand.The Wolf warrior coming down on her suddenly exploded in a cloud of black ash.All of him, even his knife, were turned to a whirlwind of ash. In that instanthe was gone.River scrambled to her feet as she saw the man with the spear lunging for Tom,but Tom fell back just in time and landed hard on his back. The thing that madethe blue light fell from his hand.In a heartbeat, Raging River pulled her knife from the sheath at her waist andslammed the sharp blade into the warrior’s lower back, where she knew it wouldhurt him the most. She saw that he, too, already had bloody wounds on his arms.Before he was able to stab his spear into Tom’s face, he arched back toward thepain of her knife in his kidney. As he tried to counterattack, she had alreadystabbed him half a dozen more times. Her knife slammed into his lower back, intohis ribs, into his side, and as he turned toward her it cut open his belly.His eyes opened wide, wild with the shock of the damage done by her blade. Hisright hand reached out for her throat. As he did, she plunged her knife into theleft side of his neck twice, fast and hard. With blood flowing from the woundson his neck, he staggered back a step. When he did, she slammed her knife intothe center of his chest.With that, he finally went down.She had to put a foot on his chest to help pull her knife free. When she did,River saw only then that his arms had been ripped up. There were great openwounds where teeth had torn down through muscle. She knew it had to have beenfrom Big Dog. What he had done to this man had slowed him enough that it hadenabled River to take him down. Had he not been so severely injured, he mighthave been fast enough to kill Tom and her both.She looked around quickly, worried that there were other Wolf People warriors,but she didn’t see any. Tom was already back to his feet.River, still filled with the rage of the fight, jammed a finger into his chest.“This is the fault of your people! This is what the Sky People have brought us!They bring us those who would kill us! All because the Sky People poisoned theminds of my people with their laws! The laws the Sky People put on us havecaused nothing but suffering and death! You must—”He grabbed her wrist to stop her jabbing him with a finger. “Thank you forprotecting me,” he said in a calming voice. “I think he might have killed me hadyou not acted so fast. Thank you.”She cooled under his warm smile. She took her hand back as she regained controlof herself. She suddenly felt foolish for blaming him. It had obviously happenedlong before his time, just as it had happened long before her time.“You saved me first,” she said, much calmer. “I was returning the favor.”“Only one problem.” He let out a frustrated sigh. “After I took out the onetrying to kill you, I fell back and landed on my back. When I did, I lost myweapon.”She realized, then, that he had protected her life before his own. He could havedied while protecting her. He could have protected himself and let her bekilled, but he hadn’t.If the Wolf People warriors came into her village to capture her, or kill her,no one would ever lift a finger to protect her. Something about the Sky Peoplelaw didn’t make sense. This man had just killed to protect her.The same as she had done trying to protect Morning Flower.River looked around. “I will help you find it.”Tom pointed. “It went down that fissure in the rock behind me where I fellback.”Together they got down on their hands and knees to look down into the darkcrack. Tom pulled something from his belt and made light go far down into thecrack. She was amazed at how he made light without fire, but she was moreinterested in finding the weapon he had lost—a weapon that could turn people toash. With the way the split in the rock twisted down deep, they couldn’t see hishand weapon. It was somewhere far down in the ground, far, far out of sight.“I don’t think there is any way to get it back,” she said.Tom gritted his teeth silently for a moment.“I’m afraid you’re right,” he finally said.“Commander,” the voice in the mask crackled, “are you still there? I have moreinformation.”“Yes. Sorry. I had a situation. What did you find out?”“I confirmed that sector was long ago designated as restricted because it wasdetermined by remote sensors that it was populated. If Rebecca Collins livedamong those people and played God, as you say, it was long before therestriction was put in place. That complicates things. You need to investigateand straighten out any issues she might have caused, either deliberately orinadvertently. You need to confirm that nothing even remotely serious resultedfrom her interactions with the indigenous people.”“I’m afraid the issue appears to be serious.” Commander Tom looked at River.“Quite serious.”“Understood, Commander. I’ve plugged it into the system. Pursuant to thereformation directive, until resolution you have level Q-seventeenauthorization.”His glanced over at River. “Q-seventeen. Roger that.”Tom was starting to say something to River when the voice came back again.“Commander, it looks like we have another problem. Word is just coming in nowthat Over Command is on this Rebecca Collins discovery and they are not at allhappy. The planet was classified as restricted and you’ve confirmed that therewas a breach, but since the breach predates the restriction, they ordered animmediate quarantine of the planet.”“Do they really think that’s necessary?”“Apparently so. Deconfliction alerts were just sent out. We’re showing thatyou’re the only one in that sector, or even close. I’m sorry, but there is notime to send you any help to correct the damage. You’re on your own in fixingthe situation.”“Understood.”“Oh, here we go… looks like this has them upset; they’ve put the quarantine on ashort fuse. Sorry to put you in this spot, Commander, but you know theregulations.”Tom’s mouth twisted as he nodded. “I do indeed.”“I can only buy you a little time until quarantine is initiated. You know betterthan anyone what you need to do.”Commander Tom’s expression was grim as he nodded. “Understood. Analyze andcorrect any inadvertent damage to the indigenous population before thequarantine sterilizes the planet. Give me a mark on how much time I have.”“Done. Keep an eye on that countdown, Commander.” The female voice paused for amoment before going on. “It’s a hard deadline, Tom. I can’t buy you anothersecond beyond that mark. You know that. You need to fix things and be out ofthere by quarantine initiation.”“Roger,” he said as he nodded. “Commander Tom out.”He sighed as he looked at River.Tom spoke her language, but she still didn’t understand much of what he and thevoice in his helmet said.“What does that mean? ‘Before the quarantine sterilizes the planet’?”“It means that in your world any non-indigenous life-form, like me, isclassified as an infection. Those in charge have mandated that any lifeencountered must be left alone. That is to make sure that no one interferes withyour people”—he gestured into the cave—“the way she apparently did.“To do that, they quarantine the entire sector. The means they block it off. Anyforeign entity inside that blockade—that means me and Rebecca Collins inthere—will be burned out of the sector.” He gestured to the bits of ash thatwere all that was left of the Wolf warrior. “Like that.”River looked over at the black ashes. They were all that remained of the WolfPeople warrior.“You mean if you stay too long, that is what will happen to you?”“Yes.”“That seems cruel,” she said.“It’s meant to protect people like you and prevent what seems to have happenedto your people from happening again.”“You mean you could die helping us?”He gazed into her eyes for a long moment.“I signed up for this job. It’s my life. I knew it was dangerous, but I wantedto do it because I think it’s important and because I get to see the mostremarkable things in the universe, things no one else ever has the chance tosee.” He smiled. “Like you.”“Then we should hurry, both for my people, and for you.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16 [index_split_002.html#filepos5111]Not far down the mountain they found Big Dog lying beside a small stream. Rivercried out in anguish when she saw the blood on him. No wonder he hadn’t comewhen she had called him.“Your dog, I presume?” Tom asked as she ran to Big Dog and squatted down besidehim, holding his head in her hands. He didn’t respond to her touch.“Big Dog, I’m so sorry,” she wept. “I told you to stay home. I didn’t want youto be hurt.”“Here,” Tom said as he knelt down beside her. “Let me see if I can help.”“It’s too late to help him,” she said, seeing the seeping blood, his shallowbreathing, and his glassy eyes.“Maybe not,” he said as he quickly took a complex-looking container from hisbelt.He held his arm with his own armband over Big Dog. Although it was part of hisdark outfit, it was something like the armband she still had on, but morecomplex. He pushed at rows of projections on the armband and turned small whiteknobs. Lights lit and danced around on the shiny surface. She saw lines light upand move in waves. He opened the box from his belt, then pressed something frominside against Big Dog’s neck.Big Dog’s eyes closed, and River could see him slump even more.“Did you put him out of his misery?” she asked, afraid of the answer.“No. I just put him into a deeper sleep so that I can try to help him. He washit in the head with something hard. It cracked his skull.”“A war hammer.” She tapped the one in her belt. “Like this one.”He nodded as he glanced over at the weapon while holding something against theside of Big Dog; then he went back to what he was doing.“Fortunately,” he said, “it looks like it was a glancing blow. Still, it diddamage. It put him down, which is what those men were after. They came to killus and only wanted the dog out of the way.”“But he’s hurt bad?”“It cracked his skull, causing an intracranial hemorrhage.” He looked at theglowing symbols on his armband again. “Looks like it’s a subarachnoid hemorrhageinvolving a subdural hematoma.”Her head spun in confusion trying to understand him. “What does that mean? Is hedying?”“It means he is bleeding inside his skull from the damage of the blow. Thatbleeding puts pressure inside the braincase. That pressure will kill him ifsomething isn’t done right away.”It sounded hopeless to River. “What can be done?”“Hush,” he said in a distracted voice as he used a small rod that made anintense line of light. She could smell burning fur. He had shaved away some ofthe fur in a round spot. Somehow, as he used it, the light made a little cut. Heworked with strange objects from inside the box he’d taken from his belt, firstone and then another. Some he put in through the cut he had made while hepressed others to different places on Big Dog’s head behind his ear.Pulling another device from the same box, he placed the long point into thewound. It made a hissing sound. White foam frothed up around the wound and thenslowly began to melt away.“Now we have to wait just a little bit,” he told her.“What did you do?”“Stopped the bleeding, relieved the intracranial pressure by vaporizing theblood trapped inside, regenerated the damaged tissue, then sealed the crack inthe bone and closed the incision.”River didn’t understand most of what he said, but she understood the generalidea. “How long? How long do we need to wait?”Just then, Big Dog’s eyes opened. They looked clear. He blinked and lifted hishead, then looked around as if waking from sleep. After a few more moments hegot up on his feet.“About that long,” Tom said with a smile.Tail wagging, Big Dog started licking Tom’s face through the opening in hismask. Tom laughed and patted him on the shoulder as he tried to hold him backaway.“I’ve never seen him react that way to a stranger,” River said.Tom laughed while trying to stop Big Dog from licking him. “We’re not strangersanymore.”“How did you know what to do?”“I’ve done it many times in training. It helps to have the correct instrumentsand of course that no disease was involved.”River had never thought anyone could do such a thing. Finally, Big Dog shookhimself and then leaned up against her. She hugged him, which he generallydidn’t like, but he tolerated it now. She thought he understood that he had beenin trouble and Tom had saved him. He was a little wobbly on his feet at first,but he quickly seemed back to his old self.She cupped his head in her hands. “Thank you, my friend, for what you did tostop those bad men. It saved my life.”Once Tom had replaced all of his gear on his belt, Big Dog started out down thetrail. River and Tom followed him and together they made their way down offSpirit Mountain. It was a lot faster going down than it had been going up. And,of course, she didn’t stop to inspect the caves and the remains of ancestors.Once they finally reached the bottom of the mountain, River led Tom through thethick brush and gloomy forest on the same game trails she had used on her wayin. All the time she kept a wary eye for more of the Wolf People warriors. Shedidn’t know if those two had been alone, or if they had brought many otherwarriors with them. It could be they left some behind. She knew that the warriorwith the feathers in his headband had wanted revenge for her arrow through hisarm. It had cost him his life.Big Dog didn’t wander off. He seemed to know that his job was to smell the wayahead as well as listen for any signs of trouble that only he could smell orhear. If there were other warriors, River felt sure that Big Dog would warnthem.“There,” River said as she pointed. “That’s the Bitterroot River. We have tocross back over.”They found the canoe and quickly shoved off out into the swiftly moving water.She smiled then, as she looked back past Big Dog at Tom paddling with long,strong strokes. “I was named after this river. When I was born, this river wasraging, and my mother couldn’t get back across to return to her people.”“You mean to say you were born back there? On that mountain?”“Yes. Because of the storm keeping my mother from crossing the river and takingme home right away, the priestess named me Raging River. While there, before shedied, she also named me priestess of our people.”“What’s a priestess? What does a priestess do?”River’s smile widened. “A priestess is supposed to call the Sky People if theyare needed.” River lifted her head with pride as she looked out at the oppositebank. “But I am the first to succeed.”His muscles paddling against the water carried them across easier than her owncrossing. As soon as they reached the opposite bank, Big Dog jumped out into theshallow water and started barking. River finally saw, then, what he was barkingat. Nearly hidden off in the marsh grass were two war ponies left by the WolfPeople warriors before they swam across.She could tell that they belonged to the Wolf People because there were threefingers painted on their flanks. That stood for Chief Three Fingers, the chiefof the Wolf People.“We can take those horses and make much better time,” Tom said.“They are Wolf People war ponies. They won’t let us ride them.”“Is that so?” Tom said as he started through the marsh grass toward them.River hurried to catch up with him. When he reached the war ponies, they wereskittish and danced around. One reared up on its hind legs. They wanted nothingto do with him because he was a stranger. More than being a stranger, he was astranger in strange dress. The thing that really seemed to scare them, though,was the big round mask.Tom untied the rope of one and gently pulled it, then released the pressure. Hepulled again while whispering to the horse, and again released the pressure.Finally, after he’d encouraged the animal a few times, when he released thepressure again the horse took a couple of steps toward him. He kept doing it,getting the horse to come to him, until he was walking backward, leading thehorse along.“River, take the rope on the other horse and do the same as I’m doing. Tuggently and release. Tug and release. Talk gently to him to calm him.”She followed his example, gently tugging and then releasing. After a short time,the first horse had taken steps all the way to Tom. Once it was up close hecooed softly to it as he rubbed its nose and forehead. When it finally nuzzledits head against him, he stroked behind the horse’s ears. River followed hisexample and was shocked to see her horse do the same with her. It felt goodstroking the strong neck of the animal. The horse seemed to like it just as muchas she did.“How do you know to make a war pony respond to you?” she asked in astonishment.Tom smiled at her. “My job is to interact with people and creatures I meet. It’smy calling in life. People tell me that I’m a species whisperer.”He grabbed hold of the mane and jumped up, throwing a leg over the horse. Itwalked about in surprise a little but then settled down under his reassuringtouch. When River mounted the other horse, it, too, responded well.“We had better get going,” Tom said. “These will save precious time.”River nodded her agreement and with her heels urged the horse quickly ahead. BigDog ran with them, barking his enjoyment of this new kind of fun.Rather than head to her village, River headed straight for the place where theWolf People lived."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17 [index_split_002.html#filepos5228]River stroked the side of her horse’s neck as they slowed to a halt. The horsehad proven a willing mount once shown a gentle hand the way Tom had taught her.The Sun People had horses, too, and she liked to ride them, but the men rodethem most of the time on hunts, so it was rare for her to be given theprivilege. Tom’s horse, even carrying a man in a frightening black outfit with abig round mask around his head, had been eager to please him.It amazed her the way the horse saw the man, not the mask. She, too, wasbeginning to see beyond the mask.Off in the distance she could see the pointed tents of the Wolf People village.Those tents filled the valley between green hills. Smoke rose from a great manycook fires. All the tents gathered together reminded her of nothing so much as afield of white mushrooms sprouted up out of the ground beside the meanderingstream.The Wolf People moved their tent village to other locations from time to time totake advantage of different seasons. If they stayed in one place too long, thegame would all be gone, so they moved on. Sometimes they moved into theterritory of other peoples, which caused conflict. Sometimes they moved closerto or farther away from the Sun People village. The houses in River’s villagewere made of mud brick, so they couldn’t move. They were at the mercy of theWolf People.“This is your village?” Commander Tom asked.“No. This is the home of the Wolf People.”“The Wolf People?” He frowned over at her. “We need to get to your village so Ican straighten out the problem caused by Rebecca Collins. That’s the reason youwanted my help, remember?” He looked down at his armband. “I’m running out oftime.”“I’m not going back to my village until I rescue my little sister. I told youhow they took her. I failed her. I need to get her back.”“We don’t have time for this,” he insisted.“The sooner I rescue her, the sooner we can get to my village.”Commander Tom sighed as he rested a hand over the one holding his horse’s maneas he gazed out at the field of off-white tents. He did not look pleased aboutwhat she was doing.“If I don’t take care of the problem caused by Rebecca Collins before I have toleave, no one will ever come again to help straighten things out. You, yourself,said that a great many people died because of those laws and that many morewill. I am your last hope, River, and I don’t have much time left.”River moved her horse sideways a couple of steps to reach out and touch Tom’sarm. “This is my little sister. I have to save her. Hasn’t anyone ever meant theworld to you?”His expression finally relaxed a little as he looked out at her from inside hisround mask. “What do you have in mind?”“What is level Q-seventeen authorization?” she asked. “I heard the voice in yourmask say that you have level Q-seventeen authorization. What does that mean?”He stared at her for a long moment.“There are very few people like me—commanders who patrol remote areas on theirown. There is often no one close enough to help us should we encounter problems,such as this problem here. Because of that, we must be able to operate alone.“We are highly trained in everything we might need to do in our mission. Ioperate with a whole book of regulations of what I can and can’t do. Level Q isthe section involving the use of force. It runs on an escalating scale. When mycommand authorizes Q-seventeen, that is the highest level. It means I have theauthority to kill anyone or anything, entirely at my discretion alone.”River nodded. “That’s what I thought.”“Why do you ask?”“Because my little sister is in there and I may need to Q-seventeen people toget her out. You lost your weapon back on Spirit Mountain.” She pulled the warhammer from her belt and handed it to him. “Here. You may need to Q-seventeensomeone, too.”He couldn’t help smiling. “Do you have some plan to get your sister out?”“There is a sacred place, the walls of Rock Canyon, where all peoples go to drawthe stories of their people. It is for all to see and the one place where thereis no fighting or killing. I don’t know why, but since the time of our ancestorsit has always been this way. It is a place respected by all. Because of thestory pictures drawn there, all peoples know of the Sky People. The Sky Peopleare feared by many.“If you put the black part of your mask back down over your face so that theysee only your round mask, I think that seeing one of the Sky People before them,they will be frightened enough that with the surprise of the moment, we can getin there, get my sister, and get away.“I know that when I first saw you I was too frightened to move.” She smiled.“That was before I knew you, of course. I think we can use that fear to ouradvantage.”He thought about it a moment. “That’s actually not a bad idea. Keep in mind,though, that surprise only works for so long and then it turns to anger.”“Then we should get this done as quickly as possible,” she said as she urged herhorse ahead.Tom hurried to ride beside her. Big Dog galloped along right next to them. Itwas a brief ride that took them to the first encounter with guards at the outerfringes of the tents. Those men lifted their spears, holding them up above theirheads to signal that the riders must stop.When they saw Tom coming, the men’s eyes grew wide. They stepped back, afraid ofwhat they were seeing.“Where is the girl that was captured a few days ago?” River asked.They stared at her as if she, too, were one of the Sky People. They looked toofearful to speak.River pointed over at Tom sitting tall on his war pony. “This is one of the SkyPeople. He has come to see the girl that was captured. Tell me where she is, orhe will burn your entire village to the ground. I won’t ask again.”Several of the men fell to the ground, bowing forward dreading they would bestruck down. One of the others, not knowing if he believed her, but fearing thatshe might be telling the truth, stepped back and pointed with his spear.“There, over that way. The tent with the small red cloth tied to the top. Thatis the tent where she is being held.”“Held for what purpose?”He hesitated a moment. “She is being held until a man wishing for a wife can paythe proper price for her.”He then fell to his knees with the others. “We bear no ill will to the SkyPeople and beg that they not harm us.”Now that River knew where her sister was being held, she didn’t waste anotherinstant. She charged past the men, causing them all to scatter."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18 [index_split_002.html#filepos5345]Tom rode to her right flank as she raced into the village in the direction theguard had pointed. As she wove her way in among the tents, she pulled her bowoff her shoulder and drew an arrow from her quiver. She nocked the arrow andthen held it in place with the fingers of the hand holding the bow. Holding onto her horse’s mane with her other hand, River leaned forward over the withersas her horse raced ahead, leaping over cook fires.A number of people stared as she rode past, not knowing what to make of a womanon a war pony. While they had no idea of who she might be, they recognized thethree fingers painted on the horses’ flanks, marking them as belonging to theWolf People. These onlookers would never suspect someone, especially a woman,from the Sun People to ever dare to ride in among them on one of their own warponies.Mostly, though, people stared at the dark figure of Tom in his big round mask upon another one of their war ponies. It made no sense to them, but it frightenedthem. While a few people stood staring in shock and others ran screaming, mostwere so terrified of Tom that they fell to their knees to bow forward as ifbegging for their lives to be spared.Big Dog, aroused by the prospect of getting to take down anyone who might try tohurt River, ran out in front of her, barking the whole time. He veered towardpeople to one side, snarling at them as they ran away, and then he charged tothe other side. The wolf in him was readily apparent. He was a frightening sightwith his fangs bared. Afraid of being bitten, many people fled before they evenhad a chance to see Tom. Big Dog provided an unexpected benefit of clearing manypeople out of their way before River and Tom even got there, making theirprogress that much quicker.River at last spotted the pointed tent with the red cloth on top. She cut herhorse to the right, in the direction of the tent. Her heart pounded with thefear of being in among so many Wolf People. If their panic and surprise gave wayto anger, she would be in a great deal of trouble.An angry-faced man jumped out to block her way. He waved his arms and then racedforward to try to grab her leg and drag her off her horse. River put an arrowthrough his chest and charged her horse right over him.At the tent with the red cloth, River and Tom rode around the outside to drivepeople away. Once they had scattered, Tom grabbed a flap of the tent materialand pulled it away as they continued on around. It ripped the places where itwas joined and then tore the whole covering away from the tent poles. He draggedit out of the way and dropped it.Flower was cowered in the center, not knowing what was happening. She screamedin recognition when she saw River up on the horse. She was tied hands and feet,with the rope connected to a stake so that she couldn’t escape.River leaped from the horse, pulling her knife at the same time. Fast as shecould, she raced in to Flower and cut the ropes around the girl’s hands andfeet. Overwhelmed to be free, Flower tried to throw her arms around River.“Hurry!” River yelled, not wanting to take the time to hug her little sister. Asoverjoyed as River was to have found Flower, they still had to escape. There wasno time for a joyful reunion.River leaped up on her horse, then stretched down and grabbed Flower’s hand. Apowerful-looking man without a shirt raced up behind Flower with an axe, clearlyintending to split her head. Flower squealed in fright as she shuffled sideways,trying to avoid the man’s axe even as River held a tight grip on her hand.Tom swooped in. He swung the war hammer as if he had used one from atop a horsehis whole life. The stone hammer made a terrible sound as it crushed in theman’s head. The man toppled back. His misshapen head smacked the ground with awet thud.River gave a mighty pull on Flower’s arm, yanking her off her feet and swingingher up and around to land behind her on the horse. Flower threw her arms aroundRiver’s waist.“Let’s go!” Tom yelled, as people were converging on them from every direction.His voice was louder than his normal voice and reverberated like a spiritcalling out from the afterlife.Without delay he led them charging through the crowd. Big Dog helped scarepeople out of the way.As they raced away, River took the lead so that Tom could handle any troublethat might come up from behind. From the corner of her eye, she saw men in adistant corral mounting horses.She raced through the confusion of tents, heading in the direction of her ownvillage. Finally they broke out of the cluster of tents, but suddenly came upona wall of men with spears. Their chief stood at the center of his line ofwarriors. When he held up a hand for them to halt, she saw why he was calledChief Three Fingers.He had on a vest made of wolf fur with hawk feathers at each shoulder. His warchiefs to each side likewise wore wolf fur to denote their rank. His face was asweatherworn as her father’s and just as creased and brown.It looked to River like he wanted to say something. Of course, what he mightwant to say was that they were to be put to death.River and Tom pulled their horses to a stop before the wall of warriors. Shedidn’t want those men to use their spears on Big Dog, so she leaned down andtold him to sit.“You are brave to come into our village,” Chief Three Fingers said to her. Helooked to Tom. “I see you have one of the Sky People with you. This is badbusiness. What do you think to accomplish?”She kept her eyes on the chief, but she could sense people gathering to thesides and behind them.River reached around and put a comforting hand on Flower’s back. “Your peoplestole my sister. I am the priestess of the Sun People. I vowed to get her back.”He wore as grim an expression as she had ever seen. Wolf People had always beenthe stuff of her nightmares. The look of these men only reinforced her fear ofthem. Chief Three Fingers looked as if he had never smiled in his life.While these men might have been afraid of Tom, they also found bravery in theirnumbers. They looked like they had no intention of fleeing as others had. Thesewere fearless warriors who were always eager for a fight.River didn’t know what to do, so she decided to do the worst thing she couldthink of.“I am the one who killed your son, Great Hawk.”He looked genuinely surprised. “That was you?”“Yes. Did not your warriors tell you that it was a woman who killed your son? Iwould do it again to protect my sister from cowards who hide in the grass tosteal women.”The warriors to each side of the chief murmured in anger. They looked eager todrag her off her horse and rip her apart.“What do you think you can do now, Priestess, with all of us here to stop you?”“You want your revenge on the Sun People for the death of your son, am I right?”He gave her a single nod. “We are going to kill all of your people for what youhave done.”“I’ll tell you what. I will give you your chance to kill us all. I will go backto my village and tell them that you will come tomorrow to kill everyone. Butknow that the Sky People”—she gestured to Tom—“have released us from our law.Now that the Sun People are released from their law, we will prepare to fightyou when you come.“Tomorrow, when you come, we will have a war. A real war.“How would you like that? You can see then, if your brave warriors really canfight, or if they can only kill women and children. Do you think they are strongenough to fight, instead of murdering innocent, helpless people?”He held up his hand with three fingers to silence the men to either side. “Mybrave young warriors are strong enough to fight anyone. Law or no law, the SunPeople will not fight. They will cower as they always do when they see us, andthen they will die.”“If you are so sure of that, and if you really believe that your young warriorsare strong enough, then you will let me go so I can tell my people that you willcome tomorrow. We will see, then, if the Sun People will fight you or not.Unless you fear that they will?”Chief Three Fingers leaned to one side, then the other, discussing it first withhis war chiefs wearing wolf furs to one side, and then the war chiefs to theother.He finally turned his attention back to River. “Because you have shown bravery,more than I have ever seen from any of the Sun People, or even many others, wewill let you pass. But because you have killed my son, tomorrow we will come,and we will kill you and then all the rest of the Sun People.”River didn’t know if Chief Three Fingers was letting her go because he meantwhat he said about her being brave, or if it was because he was worried what theSky man on the horse beside her might do. Whatever the reason, River was onlytoo eager to leave.With a signal from Chief Three Fingers, the men to each side all pulled back outof the way. Once there was a wide opening, River urged her horse ahead at awalk. Tom walked his horse beside her. Flower squeezed her eyes closed andpressed her head against River’s back. Her arms tightly hugged River’s middle.They rode for a time before she had the courage to look back. When she did, theWolf People village was far behind and no one followed them.Tom pressed the side of his round mask and the black portion vanished up intothe top of the mask. River could feel Morning Flower trembling to be so close toone of the Sky People.“It’s all right,” she whispered to Flower. “He is a friend.”Her stomach felt like it was twisted in knots from the encounter with all thosewarriors. When Tom smiled at her, it melted away what was left of her fear andmade her feel like all of the Sky People were smiling down on her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19 [index_split_002.html#filepos5462]By the time they reached the Sun People’s village, the sun had set, but therewas still a blush of deep color in the sky behind Spirit Mountain.Sentries would have alerted everyone that she was coming with a stranger on warponies, so River was not at all surprised to see that all of the Sun People, itseemed, had come out in the darkness to line the broad, main passageway into thevillage. As they rode through torchlight, people were treated to a sight theywould never have expected to see: River riding home on a Wolf war pony, bringingMorning Flower—a captured girl—back from captivity with the Wolf People,something that had never been done before.But if that was startling, the unnerving sight of one of the Sky People as hercompanion was astonishing and terrifying.People fell to their knees in waves, bowing down before the dark figure with thebig round head. Many of those on their knees trembled in terror of what mightbefall them at the hands of a mysterious Sky person. While they all knew thatRiver had vowed to call the Sky People, she doubted that there had been oneamong them who had believed she could actually do it.In the main square, on the far side of a fire burning in the fire pit at thecenter, her father, Chief Standing Bear, had come to wait with other revered oldmen who were his advisors. She was pleased to see that Walking Stag was there tothe side, now covered in war paint unlike any she had ever seen before.Charged by River with the task of assembling strong men who could defend the SunPeople, he had created a war paint design for him and all the young menassembled. She had to admit, he had done an admirable job. They all lookedfrightening. Walking Stag had never looked more handsome.Despite the war paint and the weapons, River didn’t know if they were yetcommitted to actually fighting for their lives. They had been raised since birthto never kill, no matter what, or they would be cast into darkness in theafterlife, never to see the sun again. Painting their bodies was one thing,fighting and killing was quite another.River slipped down off her horse and then helped Flower down. Once down, MorningFlower raced into her mother’s welcoming arms. Her father smiled down at hisyoungest daughter, tearful to be reunited with her people, then dropped to aknee and bowed his head as Tom dismounted.River walked with Tom to stand before Chief Standing Bear as he returned to hisfeet.“Chief Standing Bear,” River said, “I hope you will be pleased that as priestessI have called the Sky People to help us and I have freed your daughter from theWolf People.”When her father looked from her to the open mask of the tall, dark figure besideher, River held a hand out to the stranger.“Chief Standing Bear, this is Tom-just-Tom.”Her father again bowed his head. “Welcome, Tom-just-Tom.”He waved a hand. “No, no, it’s just… Never mind.” He took a breath. “As I toldRaging River when she told me that her friends call her River, those who are myfriends call me Tom. I am a friend to the Sun People, as are all Sky People. Iwould be honored if you call me Tom.”“Welcome, Tom,” her father said, starting anew. “It has been since the time ofour ancestors since the Sky People came to give us our laws. I hope my daughterhas not angered you with her foolishness. I hope you will be pleased to findthat our people have always followed the laws the Sky People have given us, evenif River has failed in that duty.”Tom smiled. “No, I’m not at all angered that Priestess Raging River called me toreturn. The opportunity to once again visit the Sun People is a rare one.”River held out her arm to show them the armband she was wearing. She tapped itwith a finger.“I called the Sky People with this. It is from Spirit Mountain.”Her father squinted down at it. All the advisors to each side leaned in tosquint at it with him. They murmured their wonder to each other.Her father turned his attention to River once more. “How is it that you came torescue Morning Flower?”“When I called the Sky People so that they may tell us about our laws, we wereattacked by two Wolf People warriors. We had to kill them to defend ourselves.”Worried whispering spread out through the crowd at hearing this. Everyonewatching feared that Tom might bring the wrath of the Sky People down on them.“You have killed yet again?” Her father moaned.River nodded. “We had to. We took their war ponies in order to make better time.By my decision, I rode into the Wolf People village and together with Tom’shelp, we rescued Morning Flower.”Her father was shaking his head with incredulity. “And the Wolf People simplylet you ride out with Flower? Their warriors did not try to stop you?”“Well, yes, they stopped us. I spoke with Chief Three Fingers—”Her father’s eyebrows went up at the very idea. “And he let you leave?”“Well, yes.”“They are Wolf People. Why would they let you leave with their captive?”“Because I invited Chief Three Fingers and his warriors to come here to the SunPeople village tomorrow to have a great war with our brave warriors. He saidthat if we do not fight, then they will slaughter every last one of the SunPeople. He let me go so I could tell you.”Her father was stricken speechless with alarm.“We cannot fight them!” one of his advisors cried out. “The Sky People who gaveus our laws say that we must not kill!”“That’s right,” Chief Standing Bear said. “It is against our laws to kill. Byinviting the Wolf People here to wage a war on us, you have condemned us all todeath!”Tom finally lifted a hand to get everyone’s attention. He waited for silence tosettle over the square.“It is not our way to give laws to others,” he said. “We believe that otherpeople should live as they choose, even if the way they choose to live is notwhat we would wish. It is our law to leave others be.“The Sky People who came here in the past violated our laws by trying to give alaw to your people. We believe that what your people were told so very long agowas wrong. I came to set it right.”“How could they be wrong? They were Sky People.”Tom clasped his hands a moment as he considered how to make them understand.“Were you afraid when you saw me?” he finally asked the chief.Standing Bear looked around self-consciously. “Yes. I admit that I was and stillam fearful of what you will do to us.”“When people are afraid, they often misunderstand things. It is likely that yourancestors were afraid, too, and because they were so afraid, they misunderstoodwhat they were told. Yes, it is wrong to kill people, to murder them, that isall those who came before meant.”“So, then our laws are right. We must not kill.”“You see, that’s where the misunderstanding comes in. Yes, killing is wrong,”Tom said, leaning in, “if it is murder. But it is not wrong to kill ifabsolutely necessary to defend yourself or your loved ones from being murdered.Killing in self-defense is not murder. Murder is wrong, not self-defense.”Her father looked bewildered. “The Sky People gave us the law—that if wekill—Father Sun would never return, and our people would die in the foreverdarkness.”Tom considered for a moment. “Do you say things to your daughter—tell her whatto do—because you don’t believe in her and think she is too foolish tounderstand anything?”“No. I say things hoping to keep her safe, to keep her from making mistakes, orto teach her so as to make her a better person.”“And sometimes does she misunderstand your meaning, and take it for somethingelse?”“Oh yes,” he said, nodding that it was one of the great miseries of his life.“Sometimes she takes what I say all wrong. This is very frustrating for afather.”Tom’s smile widened. “It is the same way in this. The intention was good—to saythat people must not murder one another because their life is sacred.“But by that same truth, your life is sacred as well and others may not takeyour lives.”“But if we kill in self-defense, then we have taken a sacred life.”“If they murder or attempt to murder, they have violated the highest law of lifeitself and then they have forfeited their right to their own life. You have theright to defend yourself and if necessary kill them to preserve your own life orthe innocent life of those you love and protect.”“That’s called Q-seventeen authority,” River said.Her father frowned in confusion. “Q-seventeen?”“Yes,” she said. “It is often difficult to understand the things Tom says.Believe me, I have had a difficult time of it. His language is sometimes strangeto my ears. But I learned that to kill because it is justified to protectyourself or other innocent people, it is called Q-seventeen authority.”The frowning chief looked from her up to Tom. “Is what my daughter says true?”Tom made a face. “Well… yes. Our people—the Sky People—call this Q-seventeenauthority, but that is only our way of speaking, our language. You simply callit self-defense.“The point is,” Tom went on, “the Wolf People do not have the right to take yourlives, just as you have no right to go out and kill them. That’s murder.“When they come to make war and kill you, your duty is to protect your own liveseven if it means you must kill them. Sometimes the threat of force—making othersbelieve they will die if they try to harm you—is the best way to discourage themfrom killing. Then no one fights, and no one dies.”Walking Stag took a step closer. “Does this mean that when the Wolf People cometomorrow, and they try to kill us, it is our right to fight back and kill themif we must to make them stop?”“That’s right,” Tom said.“It’s more than right,” River told Walking Stag. “They have no right to ourlives. We must fight back, or we are betraying the true meaning of the law theSky People gave us.”The frowning chief looked to Tom. “Is this true, then, as my daughter says?”“It is,” Tom said with a nod.He looked like he still feared to accept the simple truth of it, so River urgedBig Dog forward and had him sit before the chief.“When I found Big Dog as a pup and raised him by my side, what is it you alwaystold me?”Her father smiled slightly at the memory. “I told you to always trust your dog.”“And what did you mean by that?”“I meant that your dog will know if someone is a bad person and means you harm.”“When those Wolf People warriors up on Spirit Mountain followed me and tried tokill me, Big Dog attacked them to protect me. When we went into the Wolf Peoplevillage to rescue Flower, Big Dog scared people who tried to harm me away fromus and he would have killed anyone who tried to kill me.“Big Dog just naturally follows the law as the Sky People intended it, as oursun father meant when he created us. Big Dog is a friend to good people andwould never harm them, but he will fight anyone who intends me harm. He willkill to protect me. It is his nature, as nature intends. Good should alwaysfight against evil when it tries to harm you.”“Raging River has it right,” Tom said.Her father was nodding. “I think we understand now. We have been as foolish aschildren, and in that foolishness, have let others kill our people.”Tears welled up in his eyes as he gazed out over all the people watching. “Nomore,” he said in a strong, clear voice of the chief that rang out over allthose gathered. “We do not murder, but from now on we will fight to protectourselves and the lives of those who are innocent. To the death if we must.”Tom grinned. “Chief Standing Bear, you are a good and wise chief. You understandwhat I have come all this way to tell you. You understand what your ancestorsmisunderstood. You are a wise chief to correct the mistakes of the past.”The chief frowned. “I have always wondered something. Where do the Sky Peoplecome from? Where is it that you live?”Tom pointed up at the sky. Everyone looked up with him.“I come from out there, among the stars.”“Then you look down on our people, the way our Sun Father intended.”Tom nodded as he smiled. “That’s right. And just as Father Sun does not tell youhow to live your lives, neither do we.“But my time here grows short. Now that I have set things right again, I willsoon have to leave.”“But the Wolf People are coming tomorrow for a war,” River said. “You can’tleave us before then. I started this war when I killed trying to save my sisterand then when we rode in to their village and we stole her back. You must behere tomorrow. I need your help. Please. It’s important.”He rested a hand on her shoulder. “I can stay at least that long.”“But they are coming for war,” her father said in a worried voice.Raging River showed him a cunning smile.“I have a plan.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20 [index_split_002.html#filepos5579]It was a clear, bright day for war. River had let Tom sleep in her small homewhile she spent the night with She Who Knows the Moon. The old woman was eagerto hear all that had happened.River had been up for hours, painting black bands across the eyes of all thewarriors. She told them that it was the mask of the priestess and would givethem power. Men often believed what a woman told them. She hoped they believedit when they went into the battle. She hoped it would help them.They had all been in the square and had heard what Tom had told them. They hadheard what their chief had told them, that they would protect themselves.She called to Tom from outside her small home. He pulled back the covering ofthe doorway and smiled to her.“Oh good,” he said. “I was just getting up.”He was pulling together parts of his dull black outfit. It made a strange soundas the open pieces joined together and became one. It seemed like magic, but hehad assured her that he had no magic.River was taken by surprise to see him without his big round mask. She was usedto him in it all the time. Without the big round mask, she could see that he hadthe head of a normal man. She supposed she shouldn’t be surprised by that, butshe was, just a little. She was also surprised to see that his hair was alighter color than that of her people. She had never seen hair like his before,and like everything else about him, she found it captivating.“I’m sorry if I called you too soon,” she told him. She hadn’t wanted to disturbhim, but she was worried without him nearby.He was holding the round mask under an arm. “No, no. I was talking with Control.My time is running out.”Big Dog went right up to him, tail wagging, looking for attention. Tom smiledbroadly and scratched Big Dog under the chin. Big Dog barked once. It was his“Let’s play” bark.“Not now, Big Dog. Maybe later.”River didn’t know that the Sky People understood dog barks, but clearly Tom did,because that was exactly what Big Dog wanted. Tom took a deep breath, as if theair was the best he had ever breathed.“Boy, something smells good. I’m starving.”“You will have to wait until later,” she told him.“It’s been a long time since I had such a good night’s sleep in such a wonderfulplace. I wish I could stay here forever.”“I wish so as well, but it may not be wonderful for long. The Wolf People willlikely start out at dawn, so they will be here soon.”“Right. Time for a war.”“Do you think my plan will work?”He gripped her shoulders and faced her squarely. “You are the only one who canmake it work. This is your time. I will be there beside you. I believe in you.”River couldn’t help smiling. Then, she couldn’t resist hugging him. It was moreof a brotherly hug, she told herself. He hugged her back and it was wonderful.Then they separated.“Walking Stag is a lucky man.”River frowned. “Why would you say that?”Tom laughed. “Because he is, that’s all.”He slipped his big round mask down over his head a little crooked, then turnedit straight. The ring on the top of his dark outfit and the one on the mask slidtogether until she heard a click. He finally looked normal again.Together River and Tom went to the edge of the village and watched as WalkingStag put all his young warriors in a line, preparing to fight. Tom walked up tohim and put a hand on his shoulder.“Good job, Walking Stag. Good job. They look very fine.”Walking Stag beamed. “Thank you.”“But do you mind if I make a few suggestions?”“I’m sure you know more about fighting war than I do. It would be an honor tohave any suggestion from a Sky man.”“All right, then, here’s what we want to do. The object is to gain an advantagebefore any fighting starts. What you want to do is look formidable so that theyhave second thoughts about attacking.“Right now, your men are all lined up right here in front of the broadpassageway into your village. That’s fine, and I see why you did it—to protectthe village and your people—but let’s move them to positions where they will bemore effective at fighting if your priestess can’t stop the war, what do yousay?”Walking Stag was eager for the help. River suspected the young warrior wasnervous because he was in charge and had no experience. She was glad to see thathe had no jealousy and instead listened carefully, taking Tom’s suggestionsseriously. Listening and learning was the mark of a wise man. She had chosenWalking Stag for the task because she had believed he was the right man, and nowhe was showing that he was.As River watched, her father joined her.“What is he doing?”“He is making it to give the Wolf People fear of attacking, and if they do andthere is a war, we will have a better chance. I think he is positioning the menin a way that they can trap and overpower the Wolf People warriors if they comein to attack.”Her father nodded. Then he pointed off toward the horizon.“They come.”“How do you know? I can’t see them.”“I can see the hint of dust they raise.”“When they come,” River said, “I would like to be the one to speak to them.Chief Three Fingers knows me. He said I was brave. I think that it would gobetter if a woman talked to him.”“You want to speak for us? Why is a woman better?”“Because what a woman says is less of a challenge than the same words comingfrom a man, and more believable as truth.”“Do you really think it makes that much difference? When they have their mindset on war, what difference could it make? I am the chief of the Sun People.Chief Three Fingers will expect to talk to our chief, man-to-man.”River smiled as she patted the flat of her hand on her father’s chest.“Yes, there is no question that you are brave, but please, Father, I am thepriestess. Besides, all of this is my doing. I am the one who killed Chief ThreeFingers’s son and angered them to war. If I am the one facing him, maybe insteadof war he will kill me and be satisfied.”“You do not think we can win a war with them?”“It doesn’t matter if I believe it. Chief Three Fingers must believe it. If Ican make him have reason to fear war, then maybe there will be no war. Ifkilling me will be enough to satisfy his bloodlust, then so be it. I would makethe sacrifice of my life if it will prevent a war in which many people die.”He looked down at her for a long time, the creases in his face looking moretight than usual.“Chief Three Fingers is right. You are brave. Foolish at times, but brave. Iwill let you speak for us, but I will be right beside you. If it goes badly,then maybe our priestess and our chief will be all the blood he needs today.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21 [index_split_002.html#filepos5696]River stood tall as she waited for Chief Three Fingers and his war party toapproach. On her left arm she wore the Sky People armband she had gotten up onSpirit Mountain. Tom had told her that she should keep it. He had even shown herhow to make it light up with lines and symbols—he said just for the fun of it.To River, it was as close to a spiritual object as she could imagine. In hermost desperate hour, it had called the Sky People. It had brought Tom, the mostamazing, kind, beautiful man she had ever met. It felt good on her arm.To her left, but back half a step, her father stood tall and proud in his finestdeerskin vest, which her mother had decorated in designs made with beads. Half adozen steps behind him were his advisors, close enough to hear, but not closeenough to interrupt. River hadn’t wanted to present the impression that sheneeded to have a strong force standing with her.She wanted to be the strong force.To her right stood the tall figure of Tom, the Sky man, in his dull black outfitwith the smooth designs on it. His mask was open so that the Wolf People couldsee his face and not think he was some kind of evil monster, but know that hewas a man, like them. Well, not like them, but a man nonetheless.All of Walking Stag’s men were positioned as Tom had suggested. There werediscrete units of men, each with spears and shields. Each line of men waspositioned at an angle, with spaces separating each block of men. Each unit wasstepped back as they were positioned farther out from the village. In thecenter, closest to the village, were the archers as the last wall of defense.All of the men in each rank had spears leveled in the exact same position. Itlooked seriously menacing seeing all those men in precise formations, shieldsoverlapping, with their spears sticking out, ready to kill.Tom said that the angled formations created a funnel that was designed to forcethe enemy together into what he called the kill zone. Once they charged in, theformations would close around them, driving them together for the archers. Itwas clear that Tom knew what he was talking about and it had given Walking Staga great deal of confidence.In addition to the painted lines and symbols Walking Stag had designed, all ofthe men had the black masks River had painted across their eyes, the sign oftheir priestess. For the first time, she thought that the warriors of the SunPeople looked intimidating.Chief Three Fingers, along with his war chiefs, all of them in wolf furs anddifferent feathers denoting their rank, along with several dozen of thestrongest warriors painted in frightening war paint, came to a halt as a large,aggressive group in front of River, her father, and Tom. In order to keepherself from trembling, she reminded herself that her name was Raging River. Sheheld that rage in her heart.Back a short distance was a great mass of Wolf People warriors standing at rest,all with spears and axes and other weapons. Behind all those warriors, therewere old people, young people, and even a great many women, all come to watchthe war. Come to watch the great victory of their warriors. To these people itwould be a game, a slaughter, with no risk to themselves.River bowed her head out of respect as the enemy came to a halt before her.“Chief Three Fingers, I am honored to face you again.”That puzzled him. “You find it an honor to die at our hands?”River considered her words carefully, words she had lain awake all night goingover in her head.“Yes, an honor because I respect your strength.”Everyone waited in rapt silence until she went on.“I do not deny that I killed your son. Great Hawk has been here before and takenthe lives of my people. Great Hawk then hid in the tall grass like a coward inorder to take my sister. It is easy to look like a big strong warrior when yourquarry is a little girl.”There were grumbles from the warriors behind the chief.“Like the lives of our people that Great Hawk has taken in the past, her lifebelongs to her, not to him or anyone else. It was my duty to protect mydefenseless little sister. So, I killed him. For that matter, it is my duty toprotect all of my people. So, I killed him. Given the chance, I would do itagain.“I know that it hurts your heart and angers you that your son was killed, andeven more that he was killed by a mere woman. But he was a warrior against achild, so being killed by a woman was no less than he deserved.“It is only natural that you would be angered by the loss of your son as well asthe other warrior with the tall feathers I killed yesterday. I am angered by theloss of so many of my people.“You can take my life for revenge if that is your wish. I am not strong enoughto stop you. Just as my little sister was not strong enough to fight off GreatHawk.“I ask of you only to hear me out, first.”Chief Three Fingers, even though he looked angry, gave her a nod to grant thatlast request.River gestured to Tom standing beside her. “I called the Sky People and theyhave come to lift the law that has resulted in the death of so many of ourpeople. We no longer live by that law.“We will no longer be victims.“Know that if you choose to take my life, then that will be the beginning of awar, and all of those Sun warriors behind me will fight.“Do not mistake as weakness our past adherence to a misunderstood law that costso many of our lives. It takes great strength to face death to uphold a belief,even if that belief was a false one.“You have not yet faced our strength.“If you choose revenge, it will be the beginning of a war, a war the likes ofwhich you cannot begin to imagine. It will not end today. Instead, the battlethat begins today will be but the beginning of war as you have never seen it.“We will show no mercy.“Your people will never sleep safely again, for in the night we will come withknives to slice your throats. You will never again drink water to quench yourthirst without wondering if this time it is yet again poisoned. You will neveragain be able to hunt without our warriors lying in wait to cut down any huntingparty. You will never again sleep in the warmth of your tents without wonderingif this cold night will be the night we send burning arrows out of the darknessinto your warm tents to light them all afire. You will never again be able towatch your children at play without an arrow coming out of nowhere to take theirlife. You will never again be able to eat in peace without wondering if we haveslipped into your stores and poisoned them. You will never again be able to liewith your wives without the fear that while you are preoccupied we will drive aspear through the both of you at once as you lie together.“Right now, you see us as weak. If this war starts, you will see us in yournightmares. The Sun People will haunt your every thought, your every wakingmoment, your every action, your sleep. You will never again have a moment atpeace.“It will not stop until there is not a single one of your people to ever againwake to see the sun. This is the way of war, and what the law given to ourpeople was meant to prevent, but it did not work. So, if you decide to take mylife, it will be the beginning of a war to the death of the last one of you. Andlike all war, it will be a tragic loss of lives.“Sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers will all die tono end. We will be ruthless and savage. Like the sun we were named for, we willcome for you every day. My people will have their revenge and kill your people.Your people will in turn want yet more revenge.“If you want to kill me and lust for that terrible war to begin, then it will.It is your choice.“But be warned. Once started, this war will be to the death. We fully intendthat if this war starts, we will not stop until we wipe every last one of theWolf People from existence.”River let that all sink in a moment before going on.“But if you want instead to live in peace, without your people and my peoplehaving to live in constant fear of dying for nothing, then we must set asiderevenge and blame because revenge and blame has no end until one side is killedto the last person.“That is the way life has been. We understand that life was difficult and so itwas the strongest who survived. That was the way to be the ones who lived. Butthat time must come to an end. We must grow beyond that way of the past. We mustrise above our past. There must be a new way.“For peace, we must all instead decide that we are brave enough to say enough,and we will have peace. We both have bloodlust and revenge in our hearts. Wemust be brave enough to set that lust aside so that it will one day die out,even if only in those new born in a world without war. We must be brave enoughto let all our people live their lives in peace. We must be brave enough to letothers live their lives in peace.“We must value life above all else.“If you want to live your lives in peace with love of life, then the only way isfor the killing to stop. Here. Now. There is no other way.”River looked out at all the grim faces watching her, waiting to see what shewould say next. She went on and said the last thing that any of them would haveexpected.“We have prepared a great feast today, with roasted boar, venison, turkey,smoked fish, baked bread, along with many other delicious foods. If you wish tolive in peace from now on, then we invite you to come into our village as ourfriends and have a great celebration feast with us as the end of war andkilling.“It will be only the first of many celebrations of our people trading with eachother, and having gatherings and feasts together, even finding wives andhusbands in the village of the other. It will be the beginning of a common goalof the joy of life. Such a peace will make the Wolf People and the Sun Peoplestronger together than we have ever been apart.“Any hotheaded young warrior can say ‘There will be war.’ Only the strongestchief can say ‘There will be peace.’“So, choose, great chief. War and endless killing, or a great feast to celebratethe first day of a lasting peace between our people. A joyous day when we canshed tears of joy instead of tears of sorrow and pain.“Yesterday you said I was brave. I believe you are brave and a great enoughchief of your people that you could be the first chief to make peace.”After the silence seemed to stretch on forever, Chief Three Fingers finallylooked from her to her father, Standing Bear.“Your daughter is strongheaded.”“You are not telling me anything I do not know.”“Daughters are difficult,” Chief Three Fingers said. “I had three sons and onedaughter. The sons together were not as much trouble as the one daughter.”“I have no sons, but I have two daughters.”Chief Three Fingers grunted. “Then you must be a strong man who can raise twodaughters.”“My youngest, Morning Flower, is still too small to cause me much burning in mystomach, but I can tell you, this daughter here has been a constant test of mygood humor. Worse, she was named priestess without my knowledge or permission.”Chief Three Fingers grunted again as he nodded. “That must have caused you manysleepless nights.”Standing Bear nodded in agreement. “To this day.”Chief Three Fingers thought in silence for a time, then nodded to himself.“Though raising this one must have been a trial for you, I think you should beproud of her. She is a worthy priestess. I wish we had one so wise and sobrave.”Standing Bear only smiled as he waited. It seemed that everyone was holdingtheir breath.“The Wolf People choose to end the killing here, today,” Chief Three Fingersannounced in a loud voice as he turned from side to side so all could hear him.“The Wolf People choose to be brave enough to let go of revenge and war. A wisechief knows that it must stop somewhere.“It stops here, today.“The Wolf People choose to feast with our new friends, the Sun People, tocelebrate the peace of our lives together into the future.”Silence rang across the countryside for a long moment, and then the warriors onboth sides erupted in cheers and shouts of joy, throwing their spears, warhammers, and bows into the air.Both chiefs embraced.River thought she saw tears in their eyes.Tom gripped River’s hand and gave it a squeeze."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22 [index_split_002.html#filepos5813]The celebration feast was more than River could have hoped it would be. She hadexpected everyone to be reserved and hesitant. They were not.One of the Wolf war chiefs jumped on his horse and raced back to their villageto tell everyone the news. By late afternoon, the whole Wolf People village, itseemed, had rushed to come to the celebration. There were so many people thevillage of the Sun People couldn’t hold them all, so the feast spilled out tothe surrounding countryside. Some of the Wolf People brought tents and game andmany of their specialties and started cooking to help supply all the people withfood.Other Wolf war chiefs brought back the grinding stone and placed it in the largesquare to cheers from everyone.It was a joyous feast beyond what anyone could have expected, even River.Warriors from each side embraced and compared their war paint designs andwrestled with their arms in contests of strength, laughing with each other overwho won each match. Women from both peoples hugged and chatted. Children joinedtogether in games, laughing and cavorting.River found Chief Three Fingers and Chief Standing Bear sitting side by side ona wall in the center of the village, watching the roasting of a wild boar,waiting to be the first to have their choice of meat. They invited River to comesit with them. Chief Three Fingers moved over and patted the wall, invitingRiver to sit between them.“It is only fitting,” the chief of the Wolf People said, “that you sit in thefirst council of the two great chiefs.”“I would be honored,” River said.As she sat down, she called Big Dog. He came eagerly, tail wagging, happy ascould be with all the people. Everyone was giving him tasty morsels, so he was ahappy dog.Big Dog put his nose up to Chief Three Fingers, smelling this new person. Thechief held out a hand. River held her breath, hoping the chief didn’t loseanother finger.Instead, Big Dog licked his hand.Chief Three Fingers chuckled and then scratched behind Big Dog’s ears, somethinghe loved.“He is different than all the other dogs of your village,” Chief Three Fingerssaid. “All the others are smaller, with short, brown hair and skinny tails. Thisone is a wolf dog, you know. He has a lot of wolf in him.”“So I have been told,” River said.“You know, I had a big strong dog that was mated by a wild wolf one time. Shewent off to give birth, as dogs like to do. When she came back, nearly a fullmoon later, she carried her pups back, first moving one, then the other, thenanother, bringing them back home.”“And Big Dog looks just like the pups you raised from your dog,” River said.Chief Three Fingers laughed a deep jolly laugh. “You jumped ahead. I was goingto surprise you by telling you that!”Chief Standing Bear leaned around her to speak with the other chief. “It is hardto surprise this one. I can never tell a joke without her telling me the endbefore I get there.”Walking Stag came up then and held out his hand to River. “We are having adancing ring with some of the warriors from the Wolf People, and some of ourwomen and some of theirs. Will you come and be part of it?”“Oh, I don’t know—”Chief Three Fingers elbowed her. “Go. Dance. My daughter is there. Her name isLaughing Fox. As much sleep as I lose because she thinks she knows more than me,she makes my heart happy when I look upon her. She would love to meet the womanwho brought peace and this great feast. She badgers me all the time, telling methat we should make peace. She talks to me as if she knows more than her chiefand father.”River’s father leaned in again. “You too? I thought I was the only chief who hadto bear the burden of a daughter who thought she knew more than the chief.”Chief Three Fingers let out a long-suffering sigh. “We are both troubled men.But we are lucky men, I would say.” He looked back up at River. “Now LaughingFox is joyous that we are at peace… because of you. Go, dance, talk to her. Youtwo can plot against your fathers together.”River had to laugh. She touched the arm of each chief, then went and met hisdaughter. Walking Stag was all grins that River was joining him.Talking as best they could while dancing, River and Laughing Fox found that theyhad a lot in common. They made plans for something River had wanted very much todo for a long time. Laughing Fox liked the idea.Once the plans were made, they went back to dancing with the boys. They laughedwith a joy none of them had ever before known in their lives.And then River saw Tom signal to her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23 [index_split_002.html#filepos5930]As he put his big round mask on over his head, River’s heart sank. She knew whatit meant.She ran to him. “Is it time?”He gave her a brave smile. “I’m afraid so. The initiation of the quarantine isgoing to begin shortly. My command tried, wasn’t able to delay it. I can’t behere any longer or I will be… well, let’s just say I would like to have a longlife, as I still have a great deal more I would like to see.“In a short time, as you celebrate, I will be up on my ship among the stars.Once that happens, your people will never again have to fear that you will bevisited by anyone who might cause them trouble.”River’s hand clutched his arm. “I would never fear you coming down from thestars.”He smiled as he touched her cheek. “You did good, River. No, you did better thangood. I would never have expected all that I would see and experience when youcalled me down from the sky.“You are a worthy priestess. Your people are lucky to have you. Everyone islucky to have you. From now on, your laws and your ways are your own. Life iswhat you make of it. I have great confidence after seeing how you handledeverything, and how everyone reacted to reason. That is the mark of anintelligent species. I can’t tell you, River, how proud I am of you.”River swallowed back the lump in her throat. “Is it lonely, up among the stars?”He looked into her eyes for a long moment. She saw a deep sadness there.“It never was before. It will be now.”She put her hand over her mouth for a moment to stop her jaw from trembling.“I can’t stand to see you go.”“I’ll tell you what. You wear that armband. As long as it is on you during thequarantine operation, it won’t be destroyed. In a few days, when the quarantineprocedure is complete, it will be safe to take off as you like.“Whenever I pass this sector, I will send you a signal.” He pointed. “When yousee it light up here, you will know it’s me.”River wiped a tear back from her cheek. “I will send a kiss into the sky when Isee it.”“I will catch it.”Tom kissed a finger and then touched it to her cheek as he smiled at her in away that meant the world. She returned a smile that meant the world.The two chiefs stood when Tom went to meet them. He locked arms with both men inturn.“We will miss you,” River’s father said.“We will miss you, and we will always remember what you have done for us,” ChiefThree Fingers said.Chief Standing Bear lifted his chin. “We will remember you longer.”Everyone in earshot laughed. Both chiefs laughed.“Commander,” the female voice River remembered all too well crackled from insideTom’s mask. “You’re coming up on the quarantine window. Have you straightenedout the situation down there?”“Yes,” he said, confidently. “Everything has been set right. But a remarkablewoman named Raging River did most of the work. When I get back up to my ship,I’ll upload the event recorder and let you see it all for yourself.”“All right, Commander. Commit to the lift on my mark.”“Roger, Control.”“What is that word? ‘Commander’?” Chief Three Fingers asked River.“I think it means the same as chief,” River told him.He nodded solemnly. “We are honored to have been visited by the Sky Peoplechief,” he told Tom.Tom clapped him on a shoulder and then turned to sweep an arm out. “Please,everyone, I need a little space.”River helped urge people back out of the way, then turned and stood alone towatch.Commander Tom stepped to the center of the cleared area as he took a last lookaround. Then he pressed the side of his mask and in an instant the black facecovering came down.As he stood, arms at his side, everyone waiting in rapt silence, the muffledfemale voice came from inside his mask.“Lift locked in, Commander. Ready… mark.”A bright star appeared high up in the daytime sky, bright enough to makeeveryone look up. People oohed and aahed.Then the whole world seemed to shudder. Dust blew outward in an expanding ring.A thin thread that looked like a cloud shot up into the sky. When River lookedback, Tom was gone. She heard a boom shake the buildings.And then the star winked out and was gone."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24 [index_split_002.html#filepos6047]River took Morning Flower’s little hand in hers. “Careful. This part is steepand there are a lot of loose rocks. I don’t want you to fall.”Her little sister held tight to River’s hand. “I won’t,” she protested. “I’m notas little as you think. I know what I’m doing.”River had to laugh to herself, wondering if that was the way she appeared to herparents.Flower was excited to be on an outing with her big sister that took them daysaway from their village and adult supervision. Big Dog watched her every step,looking ready to grab her clothes in his teeth and help hold her up if need be.It was the least tense River had ever felt away from home. Until the peace, shewould have had to think hard about making such a journey. Hunts were always anerve-racking affair. For once she didn’t have to constantly look over hershoulder.After the Wolf People and the Sun People made peace, other people soon found outand wanted to join in and reap the benefits. Everyone was only too happy to havepeace treaties. They were always marked with a great feast.Still, Walking Stag worried for them on their journey. He said that anythingcould happen. They could fall, they could be attacked by a boar or a bear. So,he had come with them to watch over everyone. He mostly watched over River. Shecouldn’t say she didn’t like him watching over her.“Hurry,” Laughing Fox called down to them as she motioned with her hand. “Theview from up here is unbelievable!”Chief Three Fingers’s daughter and River were quickly becoming steadfastfriends. Both being the daughters of chiefs, they had a lot of similarities.Especially the common complaints about their fathers and how overly protectivethey were, but at the same time, how much they both respected the wisdom oftheir chiefs.River and Flower finally reached the broad ledge where Laughing Fox waited.Together they gazed out across the world under a bright, baking sun. It seemedthey could look forever. It was a beautiful sight, but what interested River themost, and the reason for their journey, was the smooth wall of reddish rockbehind them under a protective overhang.This was the place where people came to tell the story of their people withpictures drawn on the stone. River had quite the story to draw on the wall.Flower, too, was eager to tell a story.It was considered a mark of importance to have drawn something on the wall.Everyone approached the honor with great respect and reverence. This day, theycame to the task with the blessing of their chiefs. They had been charged withleaving a record of the most important event in their lives.Laughing Fox was excited to tell of the peace between peoples. All the picturesalready drawn on the wall were done with great restraint, saving the mostimportant events in the lives of their people to be presented for all time. Theywould do the same.As they began to carve their drawings into the soft stone, Big Dog curled up ina sunny spot for a nap. Walking Stag stood leaning with both hands on his spearas he looked out over the world while the three of them went about marking outtheir drawings in a nice clear spot.River was particularly pleased to see Flower’s drawing, down low to the side.There was a stick figure to one side, and a smaller stick figure to the other.“This one is you, River,” she said. “This one is me.”“I can see that,” River said.Flower put her finger on the figure in the middle with the big round head,holding both their hands.“This is Tom,” Flower said.River smiled. She couldn’t help but look up into the sky.And then she began to carve out her own drawing of the Sky People, and herdrawing of Tom in his big mask that looked like a big round head in thedrawings.Together, they spent the afternoon drawing their stories. Later in theafternoon, Walking Stag came back to tell them that he had caught some fish theycould have for their evening meal. He had even made a fire and started the fish.As he walked past the drawings, he studied them carefully.“Your picture of Tom is very good, River.”“Thank you. He was an amazing Sky man.”“He taught me how to fight a war and kill people if I had to. You made it sothat I didn’t have to. I am thankful that you are our priestess.”“Me too,” Laughing Fox said. “She made peace between our people and now none ofus has to worry about fighting and killing.”“I will miss Tom,” Flower said.River’s fingertips touched her own picture of him that she had carved into thewall. He looked so handsome in his dark clothes and big round head mask.She had only known him for two days. He would be in her heart as long as shelived.For all time, now, the drawing of Commander Tom would be protected there for allpeople to see, both her picture, and Flower’s of Tom holding hands with each ofthem.Laughing Fox drew a picture of the two chiefs at peace, hunting together,chasing a buck with bows and arrows.It was good to have such a record for people who would come after them.River checked the armband, as she had so often since Tom had left.There was no signal.Tom belonged to the sky, now.
