Riled up by the rebel leader Mirrormask, the city’s downtrodden hadtorn apart the prosperous neighborhoods. Arena warriors, tradesmen, and giftednobles battled one another with every weapon and resource at their disposal.As Nicci worked alongside Nathan Rahl to quell the worst of the destruction, sheknew the unrest was far from over, but Ildakar’s woes were no longer her problemto solve. Nicci had helped bring freedom to the oppressed city, and now thesepeople would have to rebuild their own society—nobles and slaves, gifted wizardsand everyday laborers. In order for a city to function, all the parts need towork together.Back in the D’Haran Empire, Richard was likely facing the same turmoil, but on agrander scale. It was Nicci’s job to spread Lord Rahl’s message of freedom tothe entire Old World, not just one city, and she and her companions were anxiousto move on to other destinations.In the last hours of the exhausting night, though, Ildakar remained herpriority. She shouted orders, calling the people together to fight a fire thatroared out of control in a silk merchant’s warehouse. Flames licked up thewooden walls and shattered the window glass, then spilled out of the upperwindows. Ildakar was famed for fine silks, created by gifted craftsmen in thespinners’ guild. Now hundreds of bolts of valuable cloth went up in flames,sending a sour smell of smoke into the air.“We have to get this fire under control before it spreads to other buildings.”Nicci swept her piercing blue gaze across the bedraggled crowd, assessing themas fighters, as helpers. Many of them wore clothes spattered with blood andgrimy with soot, while others looked battered and disheveled from fighting oneanother or trying to put out the scattered fires. “This is not a time to choosewho benefits most.”Rendell, one of the older house slaves who had joined Mirrormask’s revolt,rallied several of his comrades. “We destroyed the water basins so Sovrena Thoracouldn’t spy on us, but we can still use the water from the aqueducts.” He ranto a nearby wall where a public fountain had been smashed. Together, he andseveral companions used metal bars to break the cap that blocked the fountainpipe, and a silvery ribbon of liquid sluiced out. “Buckets! We need buckets!”From nearby shops and homes, people emerged with pails and tubs. Together theycollected the spraying water and rushed to throw it on the fire in the silkwarehouse.The cavernous building had become a blazing furnace. Flames erupted through ahole in the tile roof, and sparks shot through the air like night wisps. Dawnwould arrive in an hour or two, but for now, the orange glow of burning lit thesky.Flaming tatters of silk wafted through the air toward the nearby rooftops. Niccisummoned her gift and created a river of wind that drove the sparks away fromnearby roofs before they could catch fire. The embers swept higher, twirlinglike orange stars against the deep darkness, until they extinguished themselves.The wizard Nathan stood beside her, his long white hair tangled from the night’sstruggles. He showed no lack of confidence, and he smiled as he took a stepforward. “Now that I have my gift back, Sorceress, it’s time to get a littlemore practice with magic.”So long stripped of his gift, Nathan reveled in having his abilities back. Thatwas one reward he had received from the wizards of Ildakar, though thefleshmancer had been forced to rip out Nathan’s heart and give him a new onefrom the dying Chief Handler Ivan. A horrific process, but that had cured hisproblem at last.As Rendell and his companions continued their bucket brigade, pouring water onthe flames at the street level, Nathan blasted open a second fountain at anearby intersection so that more water gushed into the streets. He called uponthe flow, tugging the stream like a liquid whip, looping it in the air. Themanipulated water rose above the warehouse roof, then struck down like a viper.The column of water poured through the open roof and onto the roaring flames.Nathan pulled more water from the aqueducts to continue the deluge. With awhistling hiss, a mist of steam sprayed out, overwhelming the black smoke. Theflames began to sputter and withdraw from the warehouse windows.Nicci formed a wall of air to surround the broken walls where the flames triedto escape.Nathan flexed his fingers, as if feeling the tingle of magic through them. “It’squite exhilarating to be able to do that again!”The warehouse owner watched the destruction of his goods, his face sagging withdismay. The man had a lush brown beard and overly curled locks of long hair. Hewore layers of colorful silk robes that were now rumpled from the night’sordeal. “All of my silk, all of my wealth. The slaves destroyed it!”“The fire destroyed it,” Nicci said. “The nobles and merchants are as much toblame for the uprising as the slaves.”Rendell handed the distraught merchant a wooden bucket full of water. “If youwant to save part of what you have, then pitch in and help with the rest of us.”The merchant held the bucket and looked helplessly at the team of people pouringload after load of water on the now-dying fires.“This isn’t our warehouse,” Rendell scolded him in a stern voice. “We’re doingthis to save Ildakar.” He nudged the reluctant man into motion.The dazed merchant squared his shoulders and got in line with the workers,filling the bucket at the nearest gushing pipe. “For Ildakar,” he muttered, asif to convince himself.The legendary city had hidden beneath the shroud of eternity for fifteencenturies. During that time, Sovrena Thora had tried to build her perfectsociety, which had become more grim and stagnant over the years. Thora and theother gifted nobles had been oblivious to the explosive situation they werecreating. Thora’s own husband, Wizard Commander Maxim, had exploited thatsituation, fashioning himself into a rebel leader and trying to destroy the cityjust because he was tired of it. But his guise of Mirrormask had been exposed,and Maxim had fled the city at the height of the revolt. Thora was alsooverthrown, turned to stone by members of her own duma—just like the hundreds ofthousands of stone soldiers that had laid siege to Ildakar fifteen centuriesearlier.“Nicci!” called a familiar voice. Bannon Farmer, who had journeyed with themacross the Old World, ran to them with his long ginger hair flying wild. Theyoung man had gained some muscle during his travels, but Nicci noticed how fitBannon’s physique had become from his training as an arena fighter. He was stillshirtless from escaping the combat pits, and he carried his unremarkable sword,Sturdy.He stopped in front of them, breathing hard with alarm. “Three spiny wolves areloose in Potter’s Alley, and they’ve killed nine people already. Some citizenshave blocked them, but they can’t kill those beasts.” He held up his sword. “AndI can’t do it by myself.”“You are not by yourself, boy,” said a wiry young woman who trotted up besidehim. She wore a black leather wrap around her waist, and another enfolded herbreasts. Her short light brown hair stuck out in spiky strands. Her body wasmarked with protective runes that had been branded into her skin during hertraining to become a morazeth, a ruthless female warrior. Lila had put Bannonthrough harsh training to become an arena warrior, but after the revolt, she nowoffered her grudging cooperation to help.“Spiny wolves were bred to slaughter humans,” Nathan said. The fleshmancers ofIldakar had altered fearsome wild wolves, added muscles, arched their backs,extended their teeth.Bannon said, “They were turned loose by escaping slaves, but now we have to takecare of them before they hurt anyone else.”“Tonight, we take care of everything,” Nicci said. “Lead on, Bannon Farmer.”The tall young man trotted off, while Lila darted after him. The group ran pastshuttered shops, overturned cobbler’s benches, a ransacked grocer’s stall, andfinally into the alley where several potters had set up their wheels along withshelves to display their wares. At the end of the street, near a shared,smoke-stained kiln, anxious people armed with sticks stood together, barelymanaging to hold three spiny wolves at bay. Several men already lay dead on theground, their chests torn open, their throats mangled.Behind the cornered wolves, Nicci heard the wails of two young children andtheir mother trapped in a small potter’s shop. The door of old planks was tooflimsy to offer much protection. One of the spiny wolves growled at thewhimpering children and smashed at the door with a large paw, splintering thesupports, but the jabbing spears and shovels kept the animals preoccupied.Rushing toward the end of the street, Nicci snatched up a glazed pot from anearby shelf and hurled it with perfect aim, shattering it against the skull ofa wolf. The three beasts snarled, and the reluctant defenders backed away infear. Nicci strode forward, palms on the daggers at her waist, while Nathan,Bannon, and Lila joined her.She saw a flash of tawny fur, heard a familiar growl, and Mrra bounded up besideher. Nicci’s sister panther had prowled the streets of Ildakar after beingreleased from the combat pits. Now Mrra was free, and because of her bond withNicci, she didn’t attack the humans in the city.Unlike the sand panther, these three wolves could never be captured and tamed,and Nicci had no intention of letting them terrorize or kill more people. Sheglanced at Bannon and Nathan. “We need to make this quick. Don’t let themsuffer. They are monsters through no fault of their own.”Lila nodded. “Yes, we have other work to do this night.”Using her gift, Nicci would have reached out and simply stopped their hearts asthe swiftest and most merciful way to end the threat, but the spiny wolves werebranded with protective runes that rendered them invulnerable to direct magicalattacks. She would have to kill them in a more straightforward way. Nicci drewher two daggers, Nathan held out his ornate sword, Bannon raised Sturdy, andLila grasped a short sword.The growling beasts knew their true enemies. They moved together as a pack andlunged. Nicci wielded a knife in each hand, slashing and stabbing. The wolves’fangs glistened with ribbons of silver drool as they tried to tear into her, butshe drove her left dagger up, plunging it into one creature’s throat, and thenstabbed the other blade into its heart. Mrra dove on top of the beast, drivingit to the ground.The spiny wolf weighed twice as much as Nicci did, and its sheer momentum forcedher to the street, still thrashing. Its paw tore a long wound in her bare arm,but she pushed the knives deeper. The wolf jerked and twitched. Suddenly, itshead rolled free as Bannon decapitated it with a stroke of his sword.Nicci shoved the rank-smelling wolf carcass off of her and found herself soakedwith the creature’s blood. She yanked her knives loose, and blood ran down herwrists. She pulled herself up to see if Nathan needed help, but the wizard stoodvictorious over another beast, his ornate sword wet and red. He wiped the bladeon its matted fur. Bannon and Lila had killed the third wolf.Nicci gathered her composure. Dust and gravel clung to her bloodstained blackdress, and sticky blood coated her fingers. She wiped her daggers clean on thewolf fur and sheathed them. Mrra came to stand beside her, twitching her longtail.In the huddled shack next to the potter’s shop, two little girls and theirmother yanked the flimsy door open and rushed out, sobbing, into the arms of abroad-chested man. The crowd cheered, calling out her name: “Nicci! Nicci!”At the beginning of this violent night, these same people had shouted forMirrormask, yet Nicci had been a more dedicated leader of their uprising.“Nicci, we continue the fight!” cried a voice. “You helped show us.”“We’ve got to free ourselves from the nobles of Ildakar!” called another.She turned to see two burly slaves wearing the drab garments of workers from theyaxen slaughter yards. Proudly, the men carried blood-soaked sacks, as if theyheld trophies. One man with a burn scar on his forehead strutted forward. Heglanced down at the dead spiny wolves. “You killed those arena animals and youhelped make the city safe. Meanwhile, we continue to fight our true enemies.”The bloody sacks made Nicci uneasy. “And do you know your true enemies?”The two defiant slaves walked up to her, ignoring Bannon and Nathan, while theother people in Potter’s Alley backed toward their shops. Opening their stainedsacks, the men dumped the heads of four nobles onto the street. The dead faceswore frozen grimaces, their eyes still open. The neck stumps were ragged andstill bloody. “These were cruel masters,” said the gruff man with the burn scar.“They beat their slaves, treated them badly.”“They might have been gifted, but they were still vulnerable.” The second manchuckled. A few others in Potter’s Alley cheered, though most seemed shaken andnauseated by their own ordeal.The scarred man said, “Even though Mirrormask deceived us, his words were valid.We will have our revenge, and we have you to help us, Nicci. We demand justicebefore we rebuild Ildakar. The slaves must be the ones who rule the city now.”Before Nicci could speak, Nathan expressed his own troubled thoughts. “Dearspirits, you will all have to rule together to build something stronger forIldakar. If you kill all the nobles and make yourselves the new ruling class,you’ll be as cruel and corrupt as they were.”“Never!” sneered the scarred man, insulted by Nathan’s suggestion. He kicked onesevered head with his foot, and it bounced down the street like a ball in a gameof Ja’La.“The wizard is right,” Nicci said. “I make no excuse for the corrupt nobles—Iknow what Thora and Maxim did. But Ildakar is your city, so don’t waste theopportunity. You have work to do, hard work, while I have my own mission, givento me by Lord Rahl himself.” She shook her head. “My companions and I have spentfar too much time in Ildakar already.”Even though the two burly, blood-flecked slaves looked cowed by her rebuke, theyremained unrepentant as they stared at the four severed heads. Nicci was surethere would be much more killing before this unrest settled.She couldn’t save the whole city; she knew that. Nicci would not become theirnew sovrena and impose her own rule. “You’re free now. Understand what thatmeans. The people of Ildakar will have to make their rules and live with theconsequences of their behavior.”“I’m afraid that’s the cost of true freedom,” Nathan agreed. “There might belean and painful times ahead, but it’s the only way you can truly value what youbuild.”After the long and violent night, the sun began to rise on a new Ildakar. Thesacrificial pyramid had been destroyed, along with all the bloodworkingapparatus that Thora would have used to create a new shroud of eternity. Thelegendary city was now permanently a part of the real world.Lila stood silent, looking at the dead wolves. Bannon said with his usualoptimism, “This turmoil will settle down soon enough. People will see reason.They want to make a nice life for themselves.”“They simply need to remember how, dear boy,” Nathan said, sounding reassuring.An alarm went up as the dawn brightened. Sentries on the high walls that blockedoff the city shouted, first one outcry and then dozens. Loud warning bells beganto clang.Lila looked up, frowning. “Those are invasion bells. They haven’t been rung incenturies.”“What threat could be coming from out there?” Nicci asked, remembering thebroad, empty valley bounded by a line of dry hills on either side.As the alarms grew louder and more urgent, the group hurried toward the outerwall. Mrra loped along behind them. High Captain Stuart of the Ildakaran cityguard met them at the base of the wall, his face ashen. “They’re moving. Afterall this time … they’re moving!”“Who?” Bannon asked. “What?”Nicci pushed past Stuart and bounded up the stone stairs to the top of the highwall. The others followed her up to the battlements and stared westward towardthe foothills and distant mountains. When she and her companions had crossed thewide valley, they encountered a huge army of statue warriors once led by GeneralUtros, a besieging army that had nearly brought down Ildakar before the city’swizards worked a petrification spell that turned them all to stone.Now, by the smoky light of dawn, Nicci saw that the huge stone army wasstirring. The long-petrified soldiers began to move with a purpose, formingranks against Ildakar."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 2 [contents.xhtml#c_ch2]From the top of the defensive wall, Nathan gazed at the enormous petrified army.“Dear spirits, that is not a sight I expected.”Bannon paled and struggled to contain his gasp. Lila stood at his side, sternand defiant.When they had first encountered the statue figures, Nathan studied them with theinterest of an avid historian, examining their armor, their weapons, theirancient expressions frozen in a moment of assumed victory over the great city ofIldakar. From his centuries of reading and learning, Nathan knew the history ofGeneral Utros and how the immense army had attempted to conquer the Old World inthe name of his emperor, Kurgan. But after Nathan, Nicci, and Bannon entered thelegendary city and found themselves caught up in the turmoil, he had barelygiven the petrified army another thought.Flushed, High Captain Stuart stared at the siege force approaching the walls.“Our city has enough problems after last night’s uprising. My guards are stillputting out fires, capturing combat animals, and stopping looters. But this…”Nicci’s expression was shrewd and analytical. “What made the ancient soldierscome alive again, and why now? This is not an accident.”Bannon leaned over the wall to get a better view. “Remember, the one namedUlrich woke up when I was out there with Amos, Jed, and Brock. The spell woreoff, and he was just one confused warrior among so many thousands.” The youngman’s voice became sadder. “Ulrich asked us for help, but they threw him intothe combat arena. Chief Handler Ivan killed him.”“He was a hard target to kill because his body was still partly stone, his skinmuch tougher than normal,” Nicci reminded them, focusing on the threat ratherthan the sad story. “And Ulrich was only one man, just a foot soldier. This isan army of many thousands.”Nathan’s throat went dry as the realization sank in, and he glanced over atStuart. “I would suggest, High Captain, that you close and barricade the gatesand have the gifted add reinforcement spells. Mount Ildakar’s outer defenses.”Stuart ran off, shouting for wizards and gatekeepers.During Nathan’s time here, Elsa, a charming member of the duma, had helped himunderstand just how impregnable Ildakar was—or should have been. After fifteenhundred years behind the shroud of eternity, though, he wasn’t convinced thecity had maintained those defenses. The duma members were overconfident,complacent in their isolation. The shroud had taken Ildakar outside the normalflow of time to where no army or magic could touch them.Now, though, the shroud was destroyed and Ildakar could not hide. The city wasstuck in the real world, and the petrification spell that neutralized the enemyarmy had failed. He knew that Wizard Commander Maxim had cast the spell in thefirst place, and the man had fled the city in disgrace. Had Maxim somehowdissolved his own spell, released the statue army as some kind of lasttreachery?Nathan tossed his shoulder-length white hair and tried to sound confident forthe benefit of the others crowded at the top of the wall. “We’ll have to rely onour own defenses.” After the events of the previous night and the destruction ofthe sacrificial pyramid, no amount of blood magic would bring the shroud back.Bannon stared at the swarm of distant moving figures. “So many of them! SweetSea Mother, it’s like a hundred anthills, all ready to go to war.”“If they were ants, we would stomp them,” Lila said. She seemed to like theidea.Resigned, Nathan turned to Nicci. “Well, Sorceress, it doesn’t appear that we’llbe leaving immediately.”Bustling in her purple robes, Elsa climbed the stairs to the top of the wall.“Ah, there you are, Nathan! I wanted to be sure you didn’t save the city withoutme, now that you have your gift back.” Her eyes twinkled with admiration. “Afterseeing what you did to the giant Ixax warrior, I have no doubt you could wipeout that entire army single-handedly.”“Thanks for your faith in me, my dear, but it will take a little more thanthat.” Nathan felt a warmth in his chest that had nothing to do with the newheart of Ivan beating inside him.Ildakar’s defenses consisted of more than just these immense walls blocking thecity from the plain. Millennia ago, the wizards of Ildakar had altered thelandscape, raising a huge swath of land along the Killraven River. From theriver side, Ildakar ended abruptly on a bluff that loomed high above the water.The magical upheaval also spread out the river channel, creating labyrinthinelowlands for countless miles downstream. The surrounding swamps were anintimidating defense, with their tangle of shallow waterways and monstrous swampcreatures created by Ildakaran fleshmancers.The most direct access to the city came from across the plain. Centuries ago,General Utros had led his overwhelming army from that direction and filled thevalley with his soldiers as he laid siege to the city.Worried, Bannon narrowed his hazel eyes. “We’re trapped in here.”“We are safe in Ildakar, boy,” Lila corrected him. “This city has never fallen.”He shook his head. “What about all the escaped slaves who already fled out intothe hills? And there were hunters, yaxen herders, and other travelers out there,without protection.”“They can run and hide, if they know what’s good for them,” Nathan said. “I’llsave my worries for us.”From the top of the wall, they watched in concerned silence as the ancientsoldiers formed lines like game pieces arranged on a broad strategy board. Witha muffled, distant clatter of weapons, shields, and heavy boots, the enemyvanguard began marching forward.“According to history, General Utros trained his people well,” Nathan said. “Hewas an efficient, powerful commander, and it was through his military geniusthat Emperor Kurgan conquered much of the Old World. Although Kurgan wasn’t agreat leader himself, he was feared because of Utros.”The front ranks trudged forward, only a few hundred at first, determined toreach the walls, but Nathan doubted they could do anything against the defenses.He tapped his chin as he scrutinized the countless ancient warriors on the openplain. “Look at them. They seem disoriented.”Nicci gave her assessment. “I think this is an initial sortie to investigate.They may not understand what happened to them any more than we do. We can takeadvantage of their confusion.”“I wish we could see what they’re doing,” Elsa said, shading her eyes. Theshadows of sunrise still sprawled across the open plain, blurring the details.Still feeling twinges of pain from the scar in his chest, Nathan called upon hisgift. The heart of a wizard—Ivan’s heart—continued to beat, circulating hisblood, strengthening his Han. He spread his fingers, holding his hands straightin front of him as if pushing against an invisible wall. “This may help us seethem better.” He pinched the air and swirled his hands, as if rolling out doughon a table, stretching it. “Air is transparent, but if I fold it and curve it, Ican make a kind of lens.”An imaginary window rippled in front of him as he distorted the air. Hesharpened the view, focused the image. Images hovered in the air before them asthe ethereal lens magnified their oncoming foe.Seen up close, the ancient soldiers wore flat expressions, and their skin waspale and chalky. Curved helmets covered the sides of their faces, and they woreleather shirts with many small metal plates sewn in place. Carrying thickswords, spiked maces, and long spears, rank after rank passed through the focalpoint of Nathan’s magical lens. Emperor Kurgan’s flame symbol stood outprominently on shirts and shields.A chill went down Nathan’s back, coupled with a hint of awe. For so long he hadstudied records in the Palace of the Prophets, reading half of the library justso he could understand history, but these once-petrified warriors were no longerhistory. These men were alive, and they meant to attack Ildakar.A full five centuries before Nathan himself was born, one of the most powerfulleaders in the Old World had been Emperor Kurgan, called Iron Fang because ofthe artificial tooth that was his fearsome affectation. Iron Fang owed hissuccess to the military genius of General Utros, who served his emperor withutter loyalty—except that Utros had secretly fallen in love with Kurgan’s wife,Empress Majel. Utros had gone off to conquer the legendary city of Ildakar, buthe never returned, and now Nathan knew it was because the wizards of Ildakar hadturned his army to stone.Meanwhile, Emperor Kurgan was a bitter, capricious leader, not capable of rulingthe lands Utros had conquered for him. In the general’s absence, when thevolatile leader discovered evidence of his wife’s affair, Kurgan had skinnedMajel alive in public and fed her still-living body to ravenous beetles, eventhough she wailed and repented, claiming she was still loyal to her husband andemperor.When Iron Fang’s restless people saw the horrors he inflicted upon their belovedempress, they rose up and overthrew him, then dragged the man’s body through thestreets, and the great but fragile empire broke apart into squabbling kingdoms.…Now, as Nathan watched through his shimmering air lens, he marveled at thecountless soldiers, all of whom still thought they were marching for EmperorKurgan. They couldn’t possibly know how much time had passed.But he wasn’t worried about the long-dead emperor. He muttered, “General Utroswas always the greatest threat. He’s right here, and he is the one we shouldfear.”The first ranks of enemy soldiers marched forward, their lines disorganized, andthen they began to yell, a horrifying, hollow sound that boomed louder andlouder. The thunder of their footfalls crashed across the grassy plain as theyclosed in on Ildakar.Long ago, deep trenches had been dug around the outer walls, moats filled withspikes and sharp rocks, but over the centuries those trenches had becomeweathered and overgrown, as the people of Ildakar grew lax. Now hundreds ofsoldiers made their way up to the thick stone walls that loomed over theirheads.“What are they going to do?” Bannon asked, peering down at the hordes pressingagainst the wall.“We’ll see soon enough,” Nathan said.The enemy soldiers formed lines along the stone barrier, two or three deep. Whenthey pressed close, they raised their gauntleted hands and pounded against theblocks, shouting with their cave-wind voices, hammering and hammering on thewalls.Before long, the first line stepped back, letting the second ranks replace themand continue the pounding. Several minutes later, they backed off to allow thethird line forward. The monotonous pounding echoed throughout Ildakar, a nonstoprumble.Elsa stood next to Nathan, nervous. “Our walls will hold,” she said. It soundedlike a prayer.For now, Nathan thought, but did not say it aloud."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 3 [contents.xhtml#c_ch3]When he awoke, the world had changed.General Utros, commanding the grand army of Emperor Kurgan, had reached the cityof Ildakar, his target. The army should have been an unstoppable force. Hundredsof thousands of conscripted warriors from across Iron Fang’s empire had laidsiege to the legendary city, the true prize of these southern lands, and hemeant to crack it open like the rind of a ripe pomegranate so they could feaston the sweet treasure within.On that cold, clear day, with his ranks of soldiers filling the plain, Utros hadfaced the high walls of the city. He noted the beautiful towers, thestair-stepped districts, the crowded buildings and enameled tile rooftops thatshone like the scales on a dragon’s back. He would conquer it in the name of hissworn emperor.His innumerable soldiers were restless, but Utros would try to prevent the menfrom ruining too much, knowing the city’s value. He wanted to keep hisreputation as well as this prize. A peaceful conquest benefited Utros as much asthe people of Ildakar. Once the army breached the walls, though, even thestrictest discipline could never stop the ransacking.The conquest would not be simple or straightforward. This was Ildakar.Facing his goal, he had stood bare-armed in the cold afternoon sunlight, feelingthe chill of oncoming winter. He stared, always calculating, searching for anychink of weakness. His thoughts were one continuous war-council meeting in hishead. Utros had advisors, particularly the beautiful twin sorceresses, Ava andRuva, but he always made up his own mind. He had already developed severalschemes to bring down Ildakar.Then wizards had appeared on the high walls, a large group of them in colorfulsilken robes, working some kind of magic. He had heard of the powerfully giftedhere in Ildakar, but Utros was not afraid of them.Unexpectedly, he had felt his body stiffen with a sudden weight around andinside him. He could barely think as some horrific power washed over his form,seized him, hardened around him like drying clay. The sounds grew muffled in hisears, and the last thing he heard were outcries of dismay from thousands ofthroats, his soldiers shouting in confusion as they froze in place.Outside his imposing command tent, Ava and Ruva turned white, as if they hadbecome statues. His vision dimmed, focusing down into a pinpoint, like thebull’s-eye on an archer’s target, and the last thing he saw was the city ofIldakar, taunting him.Utros knew nothing for an unknown period, nor did he experience the passage oftime.An instant or an eternity later, the bright afternoon suddenly switched topredawn darkness. For a moment, he thought he had gone blind. A crackling sound,like ice breaking on a pond, rattled all around him. A buzzing rang in his ears,as if the thoughts had been dammed up inside his brain and now were unleashedall at once.Utros found himself still looking at Ildakar, but the details had changed. Thelights of the city glowed into the night, washing out stars overhead, but a hazeof dawn rose straight ahead of him to the east.Before he even moved, his thoughts searched for possibilities and explanations.General Utros did not take brash, uncalculated action. He had the largest andbest-equipped military force in the world, and he’d already conquered most ofthe continent for Iron Fang, but the army’s greatest asset was his mind.The air around him felt much warmer than the cold afternoon he remembered only amoment ago. Instead of a crisp winter, this was early autumn at best, whichmeant the better part of a year had passed. How could that be? The grasses werebrown and dry, but wildly overgrown around him, and that simply couldn’t betrue. In their relentless siege, his huge army had trampled the entire plaininto barren dirt.Utros took a step forward and instantly felt an unnatural stiffness in his skin,the tightness in his arms, his neck, his face. His body, which had always beenso limber and strong, felt like a grinding wheel that had sat for too longwithout grease.He looked at his bare arms and the oddly tarnished copper wrist guards markedwith Kurgan’s flame. His flesh tone had a chalky cast. He poked his biceps withan exploratory fingertip and found that the skin itself was tougher than normal,as if infused with half-hardened clay. He felt the pressure of his fingertip,but the delicate sensitivity of his skin was gone. Utros flexed his arm, felthis elbow grudgingly bend. His muscles bulged like boulders.He touched his face, felt the full beard there, the square jaw, the prominentcleft in his chin that even the beard could not cover. He felt the smoothwaxiness of the burn scar across the left half of his face, but it no longerached. He remembered when his captive silver dragon had escaped, destroyed partof the camp, and burned him with the searing acid of dragon fire. Now the scarfelt smooth, with even less sensitivity than before.Around him, Utros heard gasps of astonishment, murmured questions that rose toshouts. He turned to look at his entire camp, only to find that it was gone!Countless thousands of warriors milled about. The soldiers had been in position,some posted as sentries, most gathered in clusters according to their assignedcompanies. Hundreds upon hundreds of tents had covered the plain, along withwagons, horses, pickets, big bonfires.And now … nothing.He remembered his large command tent, the bright and defiant banners of IronFang, the grain stockpiles, the armorers’ tents, the sword-sharpening stations,the fletchers’ camp. All had vanished. Nothing remained but the peoplethemselves, pale and stiff, still wearing their armor, carrying their swords andshields. Some horses wandered around loose, their corrals and paddocks gone.“Keeper and spirits,” he said under his breath. “What has happened to us?”The confused army was like a cloud of swirling gnats, but the generalconcentrated hard, as if in a trance. With total focus, he could dampen thesounds across the camp. He doubted anyone in his army knew more about thesituation than he did, but he had to learn their circumstances.Utros took a few steps. His body felt as if it was still partially stone, notentirely thawed back into soft flesh. He still wore his leather vest, studdedwith rectangular metal plates for extra protection, and his fearsome helmetadorned with the horns cut off a monster bull that Ildakar had unleashed onthem. He remembered the day that beast had charged through the camp, wreakinghavoc. Utros had killed the monster himself and taken the horns as trophies.He turned to his two willowy sorceresses, who were just as confused as he. Avaand Ruva were shapely and slender, clad in blue gowns that fit tight aroundtheir narrow waists, emphasizing their ample breasts. The twins lookedidentical, but Utros knew them as well as he knew his own hands, and he had usedhis hands to study every inch of their bodies. They gave him strength, but notsex.Now, he needed that strength.Ava and Ruva were pale, their skin showing less warmth than a corpse’s. The twowere completely hairless, through their own fastidious efforts, usingrazor-sharp knives to scrape smooth their scalps, their eyebrows, even thethatch between their legs. Ava and Ruva took care of each other. In normaltimes, they painted their creamy exposed skin with swirls and designs thathelped channel the gift they possessed.In the brightening dawn, the women stared at each other and turned to Utros,their expressions full of questions. Without speaking, he joined them, and bothfolded around him, touching their bodies to his. He felt the shared strengthgrow.As the confusion increased across the camp, Utros said to his sorceresses, “Wehave to learn what happened.” The grumbling outcries began to shift, uncertainand fearful. “I need to tell the soldiers something.”“Then we will have to lie, because we know nothing,” said Ruva. “Yet.”Ava disagreed. “We know it was a spell, a powerful one. And we can be sure thewizards of Ildakar wielded it against us.”Ruva touched the general’s face, ran her palm along his beard, his scarredcheek. It seemed a loving caress, but she was investigating. Ava reached out todo the same thing to her sister. “Stone. We’ve been turned to stone.”“And back,” said Ruva.“Not all the way back. We are still flesh and blood, but there’s a hardnessthroughout.” Utros glared at the walled city backlit by the rising sun. Now thathis shock was dissipating into a sea of questions, he noticed subtle changes inIldakar. Some of the buildings inside were burned, and tendrils of greasy smokesmeared the sky.He said, “Their wizards petrified us with some kind of spell, but the magic theywould need to immobilize so many thousands of warriors is beyond mycomprehension.” He gestured toward the raised city above the river. “Look atIldakar now. Something’s happened there. Those fires … maybe there has been acivil war.”“Could that be what awakened us?” Ruva asked.Ava said, “Maybe the wizard who cast the stone spell is dead, so the magicfaded.”Thousands of his front ranks, responding to their desperate confusion, marchedforward to throw themselves against the wall and the gates in what seemed to bea futile gesture.“They are angry,” Ruva said.“Let them be angry,” Utros said.His men had been trained so well they could mount an assault in their sleep. Asthey crashed toward the walls now in an instinctive reaction, Utros knew therewas no purpose to the charge, but he wouldn’t call them back. He did not likeunplanned operations, but the sortie would occupy them for a time and give him achance to decide what to do. If his entire army had been petrified for months oreven years, he needed to know more.His thoughts spun along different paths, suggesting answers and tracingconsequences. He couldn’t explain why all the tents, campfires, and supplies hadvanished. He remembered vividly how the entire plain had been trampled by somany soldiers, all the machinery and materials that accompanied such a hugemilitary operation.In the previous week, his army had endured three days of cold rain and even anearly-season snow. The ground had been a nightmare of muck that should havefrozen each night, but all the campfires and troops kept it churned into a mess.Smoke from tens of thousands of fires made the air heavy and bitter. Simply toprovide firewood, crews had stripped the hills of trees for miles around, butthe distant forest looked thick and healthy now. The landscape had recoveredcompletely.He began to suspect that more than a few seasons had passed. How was thatpossible?“General Utros,” said a familiar gruff voice, his battle-scarred firstcommander, Enoch. Enoch had been with Utros since early in the general’s career.Though ten years older and bearing the scars of many more engagements, Enoch wasentirely faithful to Utros. He was a man who understood tactics and quicklygrasped the plans his leader gave him, but not so ambitious that he had anythingto prove. Enoch did not seek glory for himself, because serving General Utroswas entirely sufficient for him. His loyalty to Emperor Kurgan was secondary.The first commander also looked pale and chalky, still partially stone.“What happened, General? Something changed, something terrible.”Utros stood straight. “You know as much as I do, for the moment, FirstCommander. Ildakar attacked us with some kind of spell.”Enoch frowned, thinking of his specific duty. “Until we learn what’s happened,sir, confusion among the ranks will grow, and that will destroy our militarydiscipline.”The general knew the complexities of managing such a huge force, even under thebest of conditions. “Do you think the men will be frightened enough to abandonthe siege? Is their confusion such that they’ll panic and scatter?”Shocked by the suggestion, Enoch gave him a disappointed grimace. “Of coursenot, General. They will never desert. Each man is yours, heart and soul. Butthey’ll look to you for explanations. You have to give them something before toolong.”Utros’s smile was muted by his skin’s stiffness. “Send messengers among thetroops and tell them to wait for word from me.” As he scanned the crowded ranks,he noted the few loose horses. “Send riders throughout the valley, have theminform each company that General Utros still leads them and that we will bevictorious. I will avenge whatever needs to be avenged.”Enoch nodded. “They already know that, sir.”“Tell them anyway. First I need to assess our situation.” Before Enoch coulddepart, Utros snapped more instructions. “It appears we’ve lost everything, sowe have to act swiftly. Don’t show panic, don’t even let the men consider theimplications, but we have no camp, no firewood, no shelter. If storms shouldcome, we need to have tents. Send crews into the hills to cut down trees, bringsupplies back, hunt food. Have them use their swords and battle-axes ifnecessary.” He knew that the streams across the valley would provide plentifulwater, but his soldiers needed a great deal more.He looked behind him, dismayed again to see the empty space that had held hislarge tent. “I need a new command headquarters erected immediately. If theycan’t find any fabric for a tent, then have them use wood to build a structure.”He placed his hands on his hips, and the orders continued to flow. Enochreceived them all in silence. “Also, launch raiding parties, a hundred of themwith twenty men each. Have them ride in all directions and scout what liesaround us. Find cities and towns, where they can commandeer the supplies andtools we no longer have.”Enoch made a mental note of every instruction. “Yes, General.”After Utros dismissed him, Ava and Ruva stood close, silent and calculating. Thesoldiers milled about, but none dared to approach, not yet. They were awed byGeneral Utros, even though he wasn’t a cruel or ruthless commander, as Iron Fangwas a ruthless emperor.No wonder sweet Majel had needed a soft touch, love and compassion, even if itmeant the two of them were betraying Kurgan in their hearts.Utros longed to see her again. It had been half a year since he’d been home toOrogang, the capital of the empire. It seemed like ages since he’d touchedMajel’s soft skin, run his fingers through her lush hair, kissed her sweet lips.He locked those thoughts in a separate mental compartment. Often as he driftedoff to sleep at night, Utros would open that cabinet in his mind to review andrejoice in his times with her. Now, though, he couldn’t afford the distraction.He felt a genuine urgency, which he hoped his soldiers didn’t realize yet. Theydidn’t have much time.With so many thousands of fighters filling the plain outside of Ildakar,entirely without supplies, they would all understand the urgency as soon as theybegan to starve."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 4 [contents.xhtml#c_ch4]As the awakened soldiers continued to pound on the walls of Ildakar, Niccijudged that the city had time, but perhaps not much. Such constant batteringmight damage the defenses, though the gifted wizards could summon strengtheningspells to keep the stone solid.The watchers on the high wall didn’t need Nathan’s air lens to see the immensityof the enemy out there. When she served Jagang, Nicci had traveled with the hugearmies of the Imperial Order, which had spent decades conquering the Old World,eventually moving north and crossing into the New World. But she had never seenan army such as this.She turned to the kind sorceress Elsa, who stood nearby, deeply worried. Otherduma members had not yet arrived at the wall, but Nicci knew they had to begintheir work soon. “After the revolt last night, the people of Ildakar must workout their political differences, rebuild the city, and strengthen itsleadership.” She nodded toward the immense siege force moving toward the city.“Even with their simmering resentments, the factions of Ildakar have a commonenemy. Now is the time you can forge a permanent internal peace, make your citystrong enough to defeat General Utros. I’d suggest you use this opportunity tosolve your problems.”Elsa remained troubled. “If that’s what the people really want.”Barking orders to the city guard, High Captain Stuart ordered standard siegedefenses, using boulders, sharp projectiles, boiling oil, and flaming arrowsagainst the soldiers below. From their high strategic position, they couldbombard the attackers with no risk to themselves.Nicci knew the defenses were in good hands, for now. “Call an emergency meetingin the ruling tower. The duma has been torn apart, but you have to establish anew one. It’s a time of crisis, Elsa. You, Quentin, and Damon still sit on thecouncil, but we have to rally all of Ildakar’s gifted.”Elsa said, “We should have added more wizards to the duma a long time ago, eversince the sorceress Lani was turned to stone. We need them more than ever withWizard Commander Maxim gone, Andre and Ivan both dead, Thora defeated, and Rennoff on that fool’s quest to find the Cliffwall archive.”Nathan rubbed the center of his chest. “Chief Handler Ivan’s heart still liveswithin me. I am as gifted and powerful as I ever was, so let’s count ourblessings. We’ll work together to defend Ildakar.”Bannon frowned, considering. His skin looked paler than usual, which emphasizedhis freckles. “The revolt still isn’t over in the city. If you have a warcouncil, you can’t call only the gifted nobles. They were part of the problem.You need to listen to the rebels and the freed slaves, as well as the arenawarriors. If it comes to a real fight, those are the best soldiers Ildakar has.”Lila shot him a glance. “And the morazeth, boy. We are the best fighters.”Nathan raised a hand to stall further debate. “It is not a competition. Everyonewill defend Ildakar in their own way. I agree with you, dear Elsa. The dumaneeds to appoint replacement members as soon as possible, and someone has tolead the city, now that we’re at war.”Gliding past Nicci, Mrra placed her feline head between the crenellations andpeered out at the awakening army in the morning light. The panther growled atthe booming of the hardened fists.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When Nicci and her companions entered the main chamber of the ruling tower, thetwo stone sorceresses had awakened and were locked in battle.Sovrena Thora, whom Nicci despised, had been punished for her abuse of thepeople of Ildakar. Rather than being executed, Thora had suffered the same fateas Utros’s army, cursed by the stone spell. After pronouncing her sentence,Elsa, Quentin, and Damon had petrified her, leaving Thora a defiant statue inthe ruling chamber.The only other sorceress who had suffered that fate was Lani, after her failedchallenge to Thora’s rule, centuries ago. Nicci had never seen Lani as anythingother than a stone figure.Now both women were reanimated and attacking each other on the open floor in theruling tower. Nicci recognized Lani’s broad shoulders, the squarish yet prettyface, and the long locks of hair that had been marble before, but were now thecolor of smoked honey. The revived sorceress threw herself upon Thora, wholooked just as furious. The dissolution of the stone spell that had thawedGeneral Utros’s army must have also released these two from their fates.Hearing the clash of the physical battle, Nicci rushed into the ruling chamberwith Nathan and Elsa close behind, calling for the two sorceresses to stopfighting. The wizards Damon and Quentin came in, accompanied by other powerfulwizards, who had answered the call for the war council.The floor of the ruling chamber was made of blue marble, a lake of polishedstone in front of the raised platform that had held thrones for the sovrena andthe wizard commander. In a long gown of green silk, Thora grappled with Lani.The women, whose skin remained pale and grayish, battled with spells andphysical blows, as well. Thora and Lani used fists and claws, but their toughskin deflected the damage.As Nicci strode forward, commanding the women to stop, Lila dashed past her andleaped into the fray. Together, Nicci and the morazeth physically separated thetwo sorceresses. Lani and Thora both seemed confused, furious, and unsure ofwhat had happened, but knowing their hatred for each other.Nicci’s implacable glare made Thora hesitate, while the young morazeth held Laniback. With a sneer, Lani turned from Thora and softened in surrender as sherecognized the familiar faces of Elsa, Damon, Quentin. “I know you are on myside. Where is the wizard commander?” She looked more intently. “And where’sRenn? Has something happened to my dear Renn?”“We all have a great many questions,” Nathan said in an erudite voice, “and notenough answers.”“Not enough time either,” Nicci said. “The petrification spell has dissipated,not just here but also with the hundreds of thousands of warriors outside thewall. The army of General Utros has awakened.”The words were like a blow to the two women, and they fell awkwardly silent.Nathan stepped in, looking at Quentin and Damon. “We’ve called the duma so wecan decide how best to fight.”Lani stared daggers at her rival. “I cannot serve on the duma if Thora is also amember. The sovrena has corrupted and destroyed Ildakar.”Nicci broke in, “Thora is no longer sovrena, nor is she a member of the council.She betrayed Ildakar and will continue to pay the price.”“Ildakar is my city!” Thora said. “Maxim is the one who destroyed it by incitingrebellion before he fled the city. I wouldn’t be surprised if he unraveled thestone spell himself, just so Ildakar could suffer.” She spun on Nicci. “And you,too—you are to blame for the uprising and all the destruction it caused.”“Now, the revolt was a long time coming,” Nathan explained. “You planted theseeds, and your oppression nurtured all that violence. Don’t complain about thebitter harvest.”“Enough about the revolt and the unruly slaves,” said a man with long,grayish-yellow hair braided down the left side of his face. “Our city is undersiege. After fifteen centuries, Emperor Kurgan’s army is now pounding at ourwalls again. If we bicker about petty things, we may as well throw open thegates to the enemy.”Nicci looked over at the stranger, deciding that she liked the man’s hard-lineattitude. Elsa leaned close and whispered to her, “That is Oron, a powerfulwizard. He leads the skinners’ guild. He has been suggested as a duma member,but the sovrena never allowed any replacement, fearing that new members mightoverthrow her.”Bannon added, “I think Lord Oron is Brock’s father. I saw him once when Amos,Jed, and Brock took me around the city.”“I hope he’s more worthy than his son,” Nicci muttered. Brock and his twocompanions had been a bad influence on Bannon, taking advantage of him andsetting him up to be captured for the combat pits.Though she knew that Ildakar was not her responsibility, Nicci stepped to themiddle of the blue marble tiles. Someone had to set this meeting on track. “Wemust convene the duma and get to work.” She gestured for the gifted members,even Lani, to take their places at the curved side tables.Also in the crowded audience, the military commanders and other high-levelspectators found places, along with angry slaves and workers. High CaptainStuart and two city guards took Sovrena Thora into custody and pulled her aside.She remained defiant, though she was still convicted and a prisoner. As thepeople muttered and listened, Nicci, Nathan, and Elsa told everyone about themovement of the enormous enemy army.Concerned merchants and gifted nobles argued, expressing their dissatisfaction.They seemed far more concerned about the unrest in the city. “What about therebels and the damage they caused?” demanded a member of the silk spinners’guild. “Are we supposed to just forget about that? Some of those unruly bastardshave murdered nobles, chopping off their heads!”Members of the lower classes also spoke up. Rendell, still soot-stained fromfighting the fire at the silk warehouse, raised his voice over the chatter. “Howcan we overlook all the damage the nobles have caused? For generations they’veharmed us. What about our blood that’s been spilled?”“Does cutting off a few heads make up for all that?” Nathan asked. “I sincerelydoubt it.”“Only fools would keep arguing while an enemy army pounds on their walls,” Niccisaid, impatient. “Concentrate on the real problem. Everyone in the city needs toknow how to fight General Utros. That is the most important thing.”Quentin cleared his throat and spoke up. He was a dark-skinned wizard withsmoky-gray hair. Deep lines on his face emphasized his habitual frown. “Longago, Ildakar had more powerful wizards than we do today. Fleshmancer Andrecreated the three giant Ixax warriors, which were never unleashed. WizardCommander Maxim developed and cast the stone spell that petrified the entiresiege army. It took all of our population, at the cost of a great many lives, towork the blood magic that protected us all behind the shroud of eternity.”Damon stood beside his friend, adding his voice to Quentin’s. Damon was athin-faced, olive-skinned man with drooping mustaches that dangled on eitherside of his mouth. “If we couldn’t defeat General Utros before, what chance dowe have now?”As grumbling ricocheted around the chamber, Nicci raised her voice. “Ildakar’ssituation has changed dramatically, but that doesn’t mean the city is weaker.”She swept her intense blue gaze across the audience. “I am here now, as isNathan Rahl. We bring new ideas, new magic, and new ways of fighting.”“And I am back, too,” Lani said.“But the enemy army is different, as well,” Bannon interjected. “Those aren’tnormal soldiers. Remember when Ulrich woke up, he was still partly stone andvery hard to kill. Now there are many thousands more just like him out beyondthe wall.” He held his sword, turning the discolored blade from side to side. “Idon’t think our weapons will be enough against them.”“We’ll fight with our magic, and for that we need to rebuild the duma,” saidOron. “We’ve lost too many of our wizards already.”“And Thora,” said Elsa in a stern tone. “She’s been banished from the duma andwill not be allowed to serve.”“No matter how much you need me?” Thora sneered in a voice like frozen vinegar.“No matter how much you think we need you,” Lani said. “If the stone spell nolonger works, then I propose the guards place you in a dungeon cell with wardingrunes around the door so you can’t use your magic to break loose.”Quentin nodded, anxious to move on to other business. “That should work for now.We can decide what to do with the sovrena after this crisis.”Damon said, “I propose we add Oron to the duma. His name has come up before, andhe has demonstrated his worth and ability many times.” He stroked his mustaches.“We don’t have time for a drawn-out process.”“I agree,” Quentin said. “We need wizards and we need a full council. Oron canbe a provisional member.”“Agreed,” Lani said.Beaming, Oron tossed the thick blond braid over his shoulder. “I will be proudto serve.”“That’s not enough,” Elsa called out. “We need a new sovrena, and no one is morepowerful than Nicci. Let us acclaim her as the new sovrena of Ildakar.”Even as the voices built, Nicci shouted over them. “No! My companions and I willhelp you, because we’re trapped here as well, but you have to help yourselves.This isn’t my city. It’s yours.”“It’s my city,” Thora said. “No matter what you do to me, I built Ildakar. Noone cares more about the city than I do, and I will not see it fall.”“You won’t see anything at all.” Lani gestured for High Captain Stuart and hisguards to remove her from the ruling chamber and take her to the dungeonsbeneath the tower. Disgraced and defeated, the former sovrena walked stifflyaway.Nicci was glad that Wizard Commander Maxim had fled the city. He was gone now,perhaps even captured by the awakened stone army. Regardless, he was no longerher concern."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 5 [contents.xhtml#c_ch5]When Adessa thought about Wizard Commander Maxim, she longed to hold his head inher hands.The morazeth leader possessed the singular focus that only the very patient, orthe very obsessed, could have. Maxim’s face was at the center of her thoughts:the narrow nose, the dark goatee, the thick brown hair. She longed to slide herfingers through that hair, grasp it tightly while ignoring the clumps of blood.She wanted to stare into Maxim’s brown eyes as they turned glassy with death,then lift the head from his bloody shoulders as his body collapsed to theground. She would hold her trophy high with blood still dripping from his neck,and she would smile as his face went slack, forever erasing his pompous sneer.Adessa was determined to hunt down and kill the wizard commander for what he haddone to Ildakar. That was her mission, and as leader of the morazeth, sherefused to fail.She had sprinted from her beloved city during the night of the revolt, clad onlyin high-laced fighting sandals, a black leather wrap around her waist and acrossher breasts. Her bare skin was toughened from a life of combat and branded withprotective spell runes. She knew each symbol intimately, remembered the trainerpressing a red-hot iron onto her arm, her inner thigh, her back. Each rune was agift bought with pain, unparalleled protection against magic. She recalled theheat that sizzled and smoked as the trainer held the branding iron in placelonger than was necessary, because he relished the wince on her face, the hissof burning flesh. After earning the first few symbols, Adessa had learned not togive him that reaction, to ignore the pain. So long ago …Each such branding mark made her stronger, if she was strong enough to receiveit. Unworthy morazeth candidates who whimpered or flinched were rejected, someof them executed outright, others allowed to die in the combat arena or, worstof all, sent down to the ranks of slaves to live out their days in publichumiliation. Most of those failed women took their own lives within weeks.When Sovrena Thora had personally dispatched her to kill Maxim, Adessa hadwasted no time gathering supplies or preparing a pack. Instead, she had justleft the chaos in the streets—the wild slaves giddy with their undeservedliberation, the burning buildings, the prowling arena animals—and had run beyondthe city walls to find Mirrormask before he escaped.If Sovrena Thora had asked her, Adessa would have stayed behind to fight therebels all night and not count the cost in blood, because a traitor’s blood wassmall coin indeed. But her mission was to bring back Maxim’s head and throw itlike a melon on the floor before the sovrena. If necessary, Adessa would spendthe rest of her life achieving that aim.Fleet of foot, Adessa had run beyond the walls into the dark night. After alifetime of hard training and brutal combat, she was strong. She had a sharpenedshort sword, a dagger in a sheath at her right hip, a spiked gauntlet on herleft hand, and her bonded agile knife, whose pinprick could unleash a world ofpain in a victim.Those were only the obvious weapons. Adessa herself was the real weapon, and shealso had the added power of life magic within her, the strength of the growingbaby she had absorbed from her own womb, reclaiming the life she had created.Adessa would be more than a match for the wizard commander, as soon as shecaught him.In the darkness outside the city, Adessa had discovered his tracks, and once sheknew the general direction Maxim had taken, she loped across the open grasses,heading to the hills in the south, following him.Maxim had always been an aloof, lazy man, pampered because of his powerfulposition in Ildakar. With her senses heightened because of the life magic, shecould easily spot the broken grass blades, the stir of weeds, the stink of hispassage. Maxim didn’t realize how many oils and perfumes he wore. Whensurrounded by the city’s smells, he never gave a thought to it, but now histrail left a lingering aroma, which Adessa could easily track.Just before dawn in the hills to the south of the city, she came upon an obviousmark on the slope, a place where Maxim had cleared away grass to expose rawdirt. Using a dagger, the wizard commander had gouged a complex spell-form inthe soil. She stared at the design, but couldn’t recognize the magic he hadworked. From the residual tingle, though, she sensed it was powerful.Kneeling, she touched the moistened clumps of dirt that ran along the main linesand studied the red-black smear on her fingertips. This was not just mud, butdirt mixed with blood. Seeing no human or animal carcass nearby, she realizedthat Maxim must have shed his own blood to work the spell. A wizard’s blood,which was potent indeed. She wondered what magic he had unleashed.Wary, she looked around, listening to the predawn noises, the restless stir ofwind and grasses, creatures prowling in the last hour of night. Did Maxim knowshe was hunting him? Had he cast some sort of camouflage spell that woulddeflect her pursuit? No, this spell-form was something else.Maxim’s magic didn’t concern her. Anything other than finding and killing himhad no bearing on her life. She saw the tracks where he had left his bloodyspell-form and headed south into the hills along the uplift above the KillravenRiver. She realized he was heading toward the swamps that stretched for milesdownstream.Adessa set her face with grim determination. Maybe he thought he could hidethere. She wouldn’t let him.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In ancient times, the Killraven River was one of the main waterways in the OldWorld. Ildakar had originally been a river port, a bustling trade center thatreceived barge traffic from the many communities in the mountains upriver andfrom the estuary that spilled into the sea to the south.In the wizard wars three thousand years ago and the Midwar fifteen centurieslater, the wizards of Ildakar had defended their city by reshaping thelandscape. They had lifted the land into impregnable cliffs that rose high abovethe river, while unleashing the Killraven from its banks to flood the lowlands,creating treacherous defensive swamps. Long ago, those duma members had notgiven a thought to the consequences of their actions. Many thriving villages hadbeen ruined and displaced in the floods, but Ildakar was safe from attack.She continued to hunt for two days, following the line of hills as the upliftgradually sank back to river level. She left Ildakar far behind, pursuing herquarry. The pampered wizard commander kept up a surprisingly swift pace.Adessa made her way into the flooded lowlands full of gnarled, knobby treesbalanced in the muck, where she found it more difficult to follow his trail. Shepicked her way across hummocks of grass, spotty islands of solid ground amidsoggy puddles. At first, the stable path was obvious, and she could tell whereMaxim had gone, but soon she faced thousands of options, a step left or right,over this puddle or that. She experienced a thrill upon finding a deep footprintin the mud where the wizard commander had stumbled.The swamp simmered, grew more sinister. Silvery webs strung between the brancheswere large enough to catch the buzzing dragonflies, leather-winged moths, oreven small birds. Hanging in wait, round spiders with bodies the size of anapple hung like black fruit. One of the spiders dropped onto Adessa’s bareshoulder, and she crushed it with her palm, splattering ichor and smearing awayits sharp, twitching legs. She wondered how the wizard commander would surviveout here. If one of the swamp monsters killed Maxim before she got her chance,Adessa would be very angry.She worked her way along, always pursuing, searching for any mark of his passagebefore the swamp erased it. She lost the trail for more than a day, which forcedher to backtrack and retrace her own faded footprints, looking for any sign.Adessa scoured the hummocks, looked through the knobby tree roots, fought herway among vines, splashed through the muck, thrashed the high razor-edgedgrasses, searching for any hint of where he had gone. The wizard commander hadvanished.At first she was confident, but after circling the obvious routes for hourswithout any sign, she began to feel desperation. She could not fail! She darednot return to Sovrena Thora without the man’s severed head. She ranged wider,stopping to meditate, extending all her senses, looking for any hint of hispassage. Maxim was a weak and inexperienced man, and she could not let him besther. She couldn’t.Adessa’s face was splattered with mud, her short dark hair clumped withperspiration. She pushed her way across a thicket, slashing spiderwebs with herdagger. When she crashed out into an open grassy area, she came upon the swampdragon.The fierce armored reptile was low to the ground. It had spiny ridges along itsback, an elongated snout filled with fangs that could snap down on prey andcrush bones, rip flesh. The swamp dragon’s head was raised, its jaws open, itsslitted eyes dull and turned to stone.The monster had been petrified. The creature must have tried to attack WizardCommander Maxim, and he had unleashed his stone spell. The swamp dragon stood asa fierce-looking statue in the grass and muck.Adessa smiled. She was on the right track again. This was a reminder of thecreatures she might face in the swamps, but she was not afraid. As a morazeth,she was the most dangerous thing out here.Adessa extended her senses and picked up the path again. Now she knew where shewas going. She continued to hunt."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 6 [contents.xhtml#c_ch6]General Utros had lost all but the most rudimentary tools, but he did haveinexhaustible manpower, and his soldiers had complete devotion to serve theneeds of their commander. He did not waste any time.Within a day of their awakening, though the displaced army still reeled inconfusion, First Commander Enoch sent teams into the hills to cut trees withsharpened battle-axes, to strip and haul the logs down onto the plain, wherethey chopped them into structural beams. With furious effort, the men erected adozen command structures, with the largest headquarters for General Utros andthe twin sorceresses. The workers created wooden buildings with sturdy walls,logs cemented with mud, thatched roofs of thin branches lashed with longgrasses.Though the awakened soldiers were oddly numb and impervious to the chill thathad set in the night before, Utros insisted on building up the camp, pullingtogether as many normal trappings as possible. Though it was mainly symbolic,his fighters had nothing else to cling to.Situated in the center of the plain, his headquarters structure was arectangular building with a high roof, lit by daylight through open windows, aswell as two braziers inside that held low fires. The rudimentary building wasnot as comfortable as his old lavishly appointed command tent, but aftercampaigning for Iron Fang across the wilderness, Utros was no stranger toausterity. This would do.He sat inside the structure now, inhaling the wafting smoke from the braziers,basking in the orange-red glow of embers mixed with pungent herbs. With hewnlogs, the soldiers had constructed benches and a long, rough table where Utroscould conduct his war councils, but as of yet he had no maps, no paper or inkfor messages, not even any fresh clothes. He hoped his scouting teams would soonfind outlying towns where they could procure basic supplies.For now, Utros sat on a sturdy bench at the head of the long table. Withregimented thoughts, he contemplated Ildakar, his army, and his war. Ava andRuva were with him, close and alluring, their skin as smooth as marble. Manytimes, he had watched the two stand naked inside the dim shelter, usingrazor-sharp knives to scrape every inch of their skin. The only mark that marredtheir perfect bodies was the ugly mirror-image scar on the outside of theirlegs, where their bodies had once been fused together from birth.The paint that now swirled and colored their skin was faded and flaking, butneither of the two women looked weak. They were patient. They were strong. Theycounted on Utros to get them what they needed as soon as he could.And he intended to do so.The foremost ranks of his soldiers continued to pound on the impregnable wallsof Ildakar, showing their might. Given enough time and men, and their hardenedfists, they might actually batter their way through the thick stone. A tinyacorn growing in a crack could split apart a boulder.From atop the walls, the defenders of Ildakar pelted the soldiers, droppingmissiles on them: rocks, bricks, chamber pots. They poured down burning oil,which covered the fighters and sent them away screaming. But the projectilescaused little damage to the hardened warriors, and the actual casualties wereremarkably few. The flaming oil seared them and their armor, but Utros had seenburn victims before. The fire didn’t have nearly the same effect on the partlysolidified flesh. Maybe his vast army was no longer entirely human, but theirstiff skin made them more invincible. As a commander, he could make use of thatfact.Hour after hour, lieutenants appeared at his headquarters, delivering reports inan efficient military fashion, as they had been trained to do. The officersdescribed the disposition of the troops, the status of the awakening camp. Utrosabsorbed the information, memorizing the words because he had no paper on whichto write notes. The twin sorceresses also listened intently.When the vast army had marched across the Old World, crossing over the sheermountains and covering miles each day at a forced pace, they knew how to set uphuge camps along the way.Now, one of his senior lieutenants stood before him at the far end of the table.Ava and Ruva stared with intense eyes, like two vultures waiting for a dyinghorse to perish so they could feed. The well-trained lieutenant ignored them andfixed his gaze on the general.“We spread out the camp, sir. The valley itself shows none of the damage thatour army caused on our march to Ildakar and the siege, before we turned tostone. I’ve dispatched a hundred squads for the usual labors, clearing spots forcampsites even though we have no blankets or tents, excavating midden trenches.They’re digging enough latrines to serve so many men, thousands of pits.” Helooked away, a frown on his pale, hard face.Utros rested his elbows on the rough surface of his table. “What is the problem,Lieutenant? Report.” Dealing with the bodily functions of hundreds of thousandsof soldiers was no laughing matter. Without efficient sanitation, the giant campwould become a cesspit, and diseases such as dysentery and the plague wouldspread. Utros knew that such debilitating sicknesses killed more soldiers thanany enemy’s sword. “You still have spades. You have plenty of space to dig thepits?”“The latrines are complete, General, but…”Ava and Ruva stared at him. Utros grew impatient. “Speak! I’ve faced countlessenemies and huge opposing armies. What could possibly be problematic about wastepits?”“They haven’t been used, sir,” the lieutenant admitted.Utros drew his broad brows together. “What do you mean, they haven’t been used?”“No one has so far … needed them, sir. They haven’t…”“Are they using the bushes?” Utros demanded.“I’ve asked, sir, but no one claims to have felt the need. I confess, I haven’tmyself, not even to … not even, you know, to piss.”Of all the grand questions Utros had faced, this had never entered his mind. Ashe was about to growl another question, he realized that he himself had felt noneed in the past day and a half.And that led to another realization. His teams had made makeshift basins,delivered water from the streams across the valley. Utros had plenty of waterhere in his command structure, but he couldn’t recall whether he had needed todrink. “We’ve been petrified for an unknown time, and we’ve neither eaten nordrunk anything. Our bodies haven’t felt any such call.”A knock came at the door as someone else arrived. Utros turned to the latrinecommander, who backed toward the door. “It was merely an observation, sir. Ifelt you should know.”“So noted. Thank you.”The next visitors sickened Utros. He’d seen bloody violence in his many battles,had witnessed the most appalling injuries and torments, but this was beyondanything he had seen before.Ava and Ruva lurched to their feet from the side bench. Even the subcommanderlooked sickened as he led four soldiers into the command structure.The glow from the braziers and the slanted daylight through the windows lit thehorrifically mangled faces of two blind, staggering soldiers. They still woretheir armor, but their faces looked like chewed raw meat. Their noses were gone,their eyes gouged out. One man’s ear had been smashed off. Their teeth had beenbattered, and only jagged stubs protruded from their gums like shards ofpottery. Their breath came in wet, sucking sounds through ragged mouth holes.The third man had an arm shattered off at the elbow, and his ragged, bloodystump dripped onto the ground, though a leather belt had been cinched around itin a makeshift tourniquet. The fourth victim had a mangled crotch, as if someonehad used a dull axe to chop away at his groin, striking off his privates andleaving torn flesh on his thighs. The victims moaned with the abject misery oftheir inexplicable wounds.“We found dozens like this, General,” said the subcommander. “They’re alive andawake, and yet they’ve been mutilated. I can’t understand how it happened. It ismalicious, senseless damage.”Utros tried not to show his revulsion. His thoughts spun in differentpossibilities, looping around until he finally understood. “They were attackedwhile they were petrified and helpless. Some cruel person smashed off theirfeatures and left them horribly damaged.”The general remembered when his army had swept through conquered cities,ransacking them. They would tear down the capital buildings, burn the temples,and destroy the statues, because General Utros would allow no god other thanEmperor Kurgan. Yes, the Keeper dominated the underworld behind the veil, buthere in this world, Iron Fang must be the one they feared and worshiped. If theconquering soldiers found revered statues of their leaders, they would batterthe faces until they were nothing more than chipped stone.Seeing the mangled wreckage of these soldiers, the broken arms, the maliciouslydestroyed groin, he knew someone had done the same thing, vandalizing the stonefigures in his petrified army. But these weren’t just statues. These had beenreal men, loyal men, and Utros felt enraged.“It is one more thing we will avenge when we invade Ildakar,” he said. “Tendthese poor men, care for them however you can.” He wasn’t sure if the moaning,agonized victims could hear him. “You have already paid a tremendous price, andfor that I am eternally grateful. I vow that Ildakar will pay a greater pricethan you’ve suffered.”After they departed, Utros needed a moment to compose himself. He looked up withrelief when First Commander Enoch entered, his rugged face showing a hint ofsatisfaction. Utros gave a lopsided smile with his scarred face. “Enoch, I hopeyou have a good report. I’ve heard enough details about latrines and campsitesand mutilated soldiers.”Enoch seemed pleased. “Yes, General. We finally have some answers.”Three armored soldiers wrestled a pair of captives through the open door, a manand a woman. They were middle-aged, but bent with the years added by a lifetimeof hard labor. They wore patchwork leather, wool, and fur garments. The couplehuddled close to each other, but the soldiers pushed them into the dim room. Thewoman stumbled, and the man caught her arm, holding her upright. They trembledas they stood in front of the table.The first commander stepped off to the left. “Our scouts found these two campedin a high meadow. They are animal herders tending fifty creatures called yaxen.”“Yes, sir,” said the captive man, trying to sound helpful and cooperative.“We’re yaxen herders, just simple people. We pasture the animals and bring themin to sell at Ildakar or to other towns in the mountains.”Utros was glad to have real witnesses, a man and woman who had not beenpetrified for years. “Then you have vital information for us. You know what’sbeen happening in the world.”Ava and Ruva glided forward to regard the captives in predatory silence, theireyes boring into the shivering man and woman.Enoch said, “We captured their animals as well, sir. Scouts are herding themback to camp right now, so we’ll have some food supply. Enough for our officers,maybe.”“Good thinking, First Commander.” Utros steepled his fingers as he leaned overthe table. He spoke in a calm voice, hoping the captives would not need to becoerced. “Tell us about the lands around us. Apart from Ildakar, where are thenearest towns and cities? Who are the leaders?”“My lord, we are simply yaxen herders! We don’t know anything,” said the man.Utros added an edge to his voice. “You may address me as ‘sir,’ not ‘my lord.’ Iserve Emperor Kurgan, and I will be the judge of how much you know.”The woman sputtered. “Emperor Kurgan? But, my lord … but, sir, he’s been deadfor ages. He—”Utros pounded his fist on the table, not sure he wanted to hear what she had tosay. “What are your names? Let’s start with simple information first.”The man reached out to touch the woman’s arm. “My name is Boyle. This is Irma,my wife. We’ve herded yaxen all our lives. Our two children are grown up and nowthey live in a mountain town to the north.”“What is it called?” Utros asked.“The town? Why, it’s … Stravera, my lo—… sir,” said Boyle. “Stravera. It’s thenearest large town.”Irma cleared her throat. “Many of the other villages grew over the centuriesafter Ildakar disappeared, but now that the city has come back, we have a newmarket for our yaxen.”Utros frowned. “What do you mean, now that Ildakar has come back?”“Why, the whole city vanished for centuries, sir, disappeared behind the shroudof eternity. And your army … sir, it was turned to stone, too. Thousands andthousands of statues. They were there all my life, many lifetimes. There arelegends about where you came from, but we were never sure,” Irma said.Boyle broke in, “We’d take our yaxen to the high pastures in the summer and thendown to the plain as the weather grew colder. We’d camp among the stone soldiersyear after year. I think I may even have seen one that looked like you, sir,and … and the ladies.” He glanced at Ava and Ruva.“Explain these legends. How were we turned into statues?”“Why, everyone knows that, sir,” said Boyle, indignant.The twin sorceresses quivered like serpents preparing to strike. Utros said, “Ifwe knew the answer, we wouldn’t need to question you. Speak!”“Why, sir, when the army of General Utros came to lay siege to the city, thewizards of Ildakar worked a powerful spell to turn them all to stone,” saidIrma.“After that,” Boyle continued, “the wizards knew that Ildakar would keep being atarget for outsiders, so they worked more magic and swept away the entire cityfor more than a thousand years. Only in the past couple of decades did the magicfade. The city reappeared after all that time, so we started selling them ourmeat and pelts again.”“Then why did my army awaken just yesterday?” Utros asked.Boyle and Irma were confused. Their mouths opened and closed, but no answerscame forth. They looked at each other, and Utros saw an undercurrent of caringand mutual protection flash between them. That was a weapon he could use.“We’ve been up in the hills. We didn’t even know you were awake, until yoursoldiers captured us. Always before, we just saw the statues,” Boyle said.“That’s all.”The general did not expect subtle explanations of magic from these two. “Tell uswhere to find Stravera and also describe the other cities in the area. Asherders, you must know where they are.”“We know of a few,” Irma said, “but I’ve never been farther than Stravera ordown here to Ildakar, not in all my life.”“Our two sons live in Stravera,” Boyle said. “Why would we need to go farther?The yaxen have all the pasturage they need.”Utros didn’t think they were lying, but, to be sure, he asked the questionsagain, pressing for more details.Because he sensed their vulnerability, he had Enoch snap Irma’s two littlefingers, a brittle hollow-branch sound that was much more delicate than hershrill wail of pain. Boyle babbled and repeated his information, and the threatof breaking more of his wife’s fingers finally elicited the names of four moremountain and river towns that Boyle had heard of, but never visited.“Thank you,” the general finally said, looking at the sobbing old woman, theashen and wrung-out man. “You have been most helpful.” He turned to the twosorceresses. “Do you think they’ve divulged everything they know?”Irma cried, “We have, my lord!”“I assure you, General! I swear!” Boyle insisted.“Very well. I believe you.” He nodded, and Ava and Ruva glided close to the twoterrified yaxen herders.“Can we … can we go now?” Boyle stammered. “We’re worth nothing to you asprisoners. No one will ransom us.”“We’re nobodies,” Irma insisted, holding up her mangled hands. Her brokenfingers drooped.The sorceresses caressed the air around them in strange gestures, circling thetwo whimpering captives like hungry wolves. “You’ve given all you can,” Ava saidin a soothing voice. “You no longer need to take up space in this world.”Ruva leaned closer, drawing upon her gift. The twins were linked, their gesturesin a perfectly symmetrical synchronicity. “Fold yourself up now, so we can putyou away.”Boyle and Irma twisted and jerked, not comprehending what was happening. Againsttheir volition, their arms bent upward, pressing flat against their chests. Theyleaned over at the waist, bending at an impossible angle until their vertebraecracked like brittle branches.Boyle screamed as he bent his legs at the knees and then bent again in themiddle of his femurs, breaking himself, folding down. His shoulders cracked andcrunched, collapsing in like a wilting flower. Beside him, Irma continued tofold herself again and again. Like old blankets, the two human forms werecreased and then folded, then folded repeatedly into a smaller and smallerpackage. Finally, their necks snapped and the screaming stopped. But the pop andcrack of breaking bones continued as the two layered themselves into compactpackages of dense, dripping flesh on the floor of the headquarters. The entireprocess took several noisy minutes.“You may remove them,” General Utros said to Enoch. “Call me when the herd ofyaxen is brought in. Tonight, we’ll have our first feast since awakening.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All fifty of the shaggy animals were slaughtered at the edge of the camp.Because supplies would be lean for some time, the butchers were careful to saveall the blood, to strip off the hides, to keep the offal, the bones, anythingthat might be useful. The pelts could be used for blankets or tent walls, thesinews dried as lines, the guts made into bowstrings, everything else boiledinto large vats of soup.The meat was roasted on huge bonfires, and although there wasn’t nearly enoughto feed thousands of troops, Utros divided the feast among his top-levelcommanders and their lieutenants. The fifty yaxen provided enough meat to feedmore than a thousand when judiciously rationed. Utros had made up his mind totake no more than the others.He stood before the bonfire, inhaling the savory smells of haunches and jointssearing over the flames. Meat juices dripped into the embers. The commanderspressed forward to be served.Because of the tension and confusion, as well as the rigorous work he had to do,Utros had driven away all thoughts of food for more than a day, but he knew hehad to have nourishment. He accepted a small serving of the fresh meat and madesure Ava and Ruva were also fed.Feeling the heat of the large fire, even with dulled senses, he stood next tothe twins and First Commander Enoch. They all took bites of the steaming meat,but the food felt oddly leaden in Utros’s mouth. He had often relished rare,dripping meat fresh from the hunt. He’d eaten countless meals of game cookedover a fire.Now, though, he felt queasy. When he tried to swallow, his body rebelled. Hedidn’t want to eat. He couldn’t taste the meat. He felt sickened, and saw thathis other commanders had the same reaction. One man even spat out his firstmouthful, looking confused and embarrassed.Enoch said, “Maybe you should give my serving to some of the men, General. I …I’m not hungry.”Utros realized that neither was he. Genuinely perplexed, he looked around, sawthat no one was eating the meat. All the slaughtered carcasses would go towaste. More details circulated in his head as he tried to understand, piecesfitting into place, even though they made no sense. He remembered no onedrinking the water, no one using the latrines. Many supplies had gone untouched,though they were available to the soldiers.His body craved no nourishment. The stone spell had preserved him for centuries,and it had not entirely let go. He stared toward Ildakar as the realizationdawned on him. He dumped his meat on the ground and felt nothing. The othersgrew alarmed as they came to the same conclusion.Utros smiled, understanding what an enormous blessing he had just discovered.Maybe he wouldn’t need to feed his giant army after all."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 7 [contents.xhtml#c_ch7]Bannon felt uneasy when he and Lila returned to the fighting pits near thecombat arena. The place held only terrible memories for him, but that was wherethe hundreds of seasoned warriors wanted to gather. That was where they felt athome, where they had learned to fight for the entertainment of the people ofIldakar. Now they had to defend the city that had enslaved them. Everyone couldsee the enormous military force outside.Bannon had rested after the night of the uprising, but he couldn’t relax. Thecity was under siege and he, too, might have to fight for Ildakar, a place hehad never dreamed of calling his own. The awakened stone army filled the plain,and for three days now they had battered the walls, with little effect. GeneralUtros had sent no ultimatum, no emissary, but Ildakar needed to be ready.Lila remained by his side, though he didn’t understand why she stayed so closeto him. He couldn’t forget how many times she had browbeaten him, challengedhim, ground him under her heel as she imposed exhausting, painful training so hecould fight against some desperate warrior or hungry beast in the arena. NowLila seemed to consider him her friend, or at least her special project, thoughhe had not asked for her company.For these training exercises, Lila had called more than two dozen survivingmorazeth to help prepare the warriors for what might be a far more terriblefight. The hard-bitten women seemed to be composed of tightly wound springs,hard leather, and sharp edges. The morazeth served their city without question,without deviation, and did not accept that their roles had changed despite theuprising. Ildakar was still Ildakar. Though the arena warriors outnumbered themorazeth by nearly ten to one in the training areas, they showed clear deferenceto the women.The fighters had returned to the combat pits to rearm themselves. Many of them,including Bannon, had helped Mirrormask’s cause during the bloody revolt, butnow, faced with the ancient army trapping them inside, the various parties hadcome to an uneasy, though unresolved, truce. The downtrodden slaves still feltgenerations-long enmity for their former masters, but most of these warriorsrecognized the common enemy. Once they defeated General Utros, they wouldcontinue their philosophical argument and reshape the government, if anyoneremained alive. Bannon hoped to be gone by then.In the tunnels near the arena, many hollowed-out grottoes had been painstakinglyconverted into combat rings, training floors, and sunken pits where warriorscould face off against each other. Bannon had sparred with Lila many times here,once even with the captive sand panther Mrra.With Ildakar under siege, the fighters gathered as if for a daily trainingsession, but they realized how much more was at stake. They were muscular,scarred, flinty-eyed—survivors all. Many wore only loincloths, though some haddonned leather chest armor. They chose sharpened staves, square knouts, curvedhooks, short swords, whatever weapons made them most comfortable.Lila stood in the torch-lit grotto holding a whip in one hand, a short sword inthe other. At her hip, she also had her agile knife, its small handle engravedwith spell runes, the tiny pointed blade capable of delivering a burst ofenormous pain. Bannon had felt its sting himself when Lila had used it tocontrol him, to punish him, to drive him to fight harder. Now she disregardedhow she had treated him, seemed to think he didn’t even remember.Lila raked her hard gaze over the gathered warriors. The rest of the morazethstood in their places looking just as beautiful, just as deadly. Bannon hadwatched them train other warriors, and he knew some of their names—Kedra,Lyesse, Marla, Thorn, Genda, Ricia—but none of them had given him “special”attention, like Lila.“While we wait for General Utros to make his next move, we will train you intothe best fighters possible. We may have to prepare you for war,” Lila said,stepping into the role of leader. “Adessa is gone. Some saw her leave Ildakar onthe night of the uprising, perhaps on a mission of her own. If she’s not here,she’s no longer our concern. My sisters and I will continue to harden you. ForIldakar.”Bannon spoke up. “We’re not training to fight for the entertainment of thegifted nobles. None of us are. I want that understood.” He looked around at theother warriors. “But we have to be ready to fight against the army outside.That’s our real enemy.”“Of course, boy,” Lila said with a mocking smile. “Do you believe battling thoseancient soldiers will be less demanding than arena combat? Don’t be ridiculous.A fight to the death is a fight to the death, whether it’s on the arena sands orout on the battlefield. I want you to have the skills to survive either.”The other morazeth squared their shoulders, lifted their weapons, and faced thecountless opponents. Lila continued, “Today my sisters and I will fight ourutmost to help you survive in a real war. The few of you who die immediately ina battle will be of no benefit to our city.” She looked at Bannon as the otherfighters shifted restlessly. “And I intend for you to survive, boy. I’d begreatly disappointed if you got yourself killed too soon on the battlefield.”“So would I,” Bannon said, without any trace of humor. He raised Sturdy, swungthe sword to loosen his arms. As a farm boy, he had worked in the cabbagefields, the son of an embittered man who drank too much and couldn’t control hisviolent tendencies. The man had beaten Bannon, but unleashed the worst of histemper on his battered wife; he’d finally clubbed her to death, because Bannonhadn’t been there to stop the vile man. His father had been hanged for hiscrimes, but Bannon took no satisfaction from it.Feeling the darkness in him, he bunched his muscles, squeezed his grip on thehilt. He didn’t care about the cold morazeth or the warriors who fought in thearena because it was their job. Rather, his anger flared when he thought of howhe wanted to kill his father, how he had failed to save his mother. Crouching,he swept the blade through the air, letting the violence simmer inside him, butnot letting it boil into uncontrollable rage. Sometimes in the heat of battle,Bannon had a tendency to fly into a blood fury and forget where he was, simplyfighting and killing, without returning to himself for a long time. Now, he keptthe anger under control as he imagined facing the giant ancient army outside thewalls.Even adding these hundreds of warriors to the ranks of the city guard, he didn’tknow how they could make a dent in the vast siege.A blade clanged against his own, startling him from his thoughts, and hewhirled, instinctively bringing up Sturdy in defense. Lila smashed hard with hershort sword, intentionally catching the guard at the end of his blade so as notto hurt him. Bannon backed away, crouching into a defensive stance. “I wasn’tready.”She laughed. “So you think General Utros will send a polite notice when heintends to attack you?” She struck again, swinging her sword while cracking thewhip with her other hand.Bannon couldn’t afford to be distracted now. He parried her attack, blocked hersword, and ducked beneath her snaking whip. The torch-lit training grotto waslarge, with plenty of places for combat. Lila and Bannon sparred near one of theshallower pits. Five feet down, the bottom was raked sand mixed with ashes toabsorb spilled blood.“We need to give these others room to fight, boy,” she said, then raised hervoice. “All of you, battle my sisters! Fight against one another, and fight foryour lives, because your survival may well depend on what you learn from us andfrom each other. Kedra! Thorn! Lyesse! Assign opponents.”As the other morazeth separated training candidates, Bannon looked at the smoothside of the pit. “I don’t think—”Lila slammed her shoulder into him, shoving him backward. He stumbled, tried toregain his balance, but she dove at him and knocked him over the edge. They bothlanded hard on the soft sand below, the young woman on top of his chest, pinninghim down.He thrust her to the side as he got into a fighting stance. As Lila rolled, shelaughed, “You have to do better than that, boy, if you want to earn your rewardfrom me tonight.”“It’s not a reward.” He thought of the times she’d claimed his body, plying himwith just a hint of softness along with a hungry lust that his body couldn’thelp but respond to. “I’m free now. I’m not your pet. I’m not your captive.”“Freedom just makes you stubborn,” she retorted, “and disappointing. I don’tlike to be disappointed.” She attacked him with a flurry of sword maneuvers,lashing her whip. Bannon concentrated on meeting her blows.Above, in the main training chambers, Genda, Ricia, Marla, and the othermorazeth plunged into a melee with their selected opponents. Shouts and outcriesechoed along the rough stone walls, ringing down the tunnels. To Bannon, itsounded like all-out war, but he knew it was merely practice combat. Althoughthe morazeth imposed ruthless violence upon their trainees, he understood thatthey all shared the single-minded goal of protecting Ildakar.“Sweet Sea Mother,” he panted as Lila threw herself upon him again. He foughtfaster, pushed her back, struck a ringing blow that made her short swordshudder, and she lashed out with her whip, trying to catch him, but closequarters rendered the long whip ineffective. He reached out, grabbed the braidedleather, and yanked hard, making her stumble toward him. He let go and in aswift blinding motion, seized her wrist instead, pulling her even closer to him.She pressed her face close to his, smiling. “So, you want me now? Are you tryingto take me right here on the sands? That would be exhilarating! Maybe I’d evenlet you. You’ve done well today.”He shoved her away. “You tormented me. You battered me. How can you think we’lljust be lovers?”She looked confused. “I trained you as I was commanded to do. I taught you theskills you needed, and I made you a much better fighter than ever before. Isaved your life, or at least extended it. How can you resent that?”He felt exasperated. “I resent being imprisoned, being forced to fight. I wasnever part of Ildakar. I just wanted to save Ian. He was my friend, and you allcorrupted him, made him forget about his life.”“He was the champion.” Lila was just as baffled. “We revered him. Adessa eventook him as her lover. She might have let herself conceive a child by him. Whatmore could a man want?”“What more?” Bannon spat on the sand. He backed away, keeping his sword raisedin a defensive position. “I wanted to make my own choices. I didn’t want to bein the combat arena. I didn’t want to be trained by you.”She looked down at his sword, his well-muscled arms, his lean and wiry form.“But you still have me to thank for it. How do you resent me?”They were panting, drenched in sweat. He knew he had fought well. Lila hadparried his blows, pressed forward, and he had pushed back. He was almost,almost good enough to fight her to a stalemate. But now she backed away,troubled by his reaction. “I find you strange, boy. This is what I am. I did asI was instructed. What more could you want of me? Someday you will appreciatewhat I gave you.”He was grateful for the swordplay that Nathan Rahl had taught him. He hadlearned the basics of fighting on the deck of the Wavewalker. Before then, hehad simply swung the blade from side to side, trying to get close enough to hitsome reckless enemy, but Nathan showed him skill and finesse.It was true, though, that Lila had honed him into a real fighter. He had beenforced into one-on-one combat with Ian, his former best friend, who had become abloodthirsty killer with cold and leaden eyes. The champion fought not one whitbelow his ability, even against Bannon, who had been forced to use every flickerof skill to save his own life, and just barely. Ian had struck him in the headwith the side of a knout, rendering him unconscious rather than killing him.Bannon was sure his friend had done it on purpose, but if Bannon had let hisguard falter for even a heartbeat during combat, he would be dead now. He wassure of it.“I can’t forget what you did to me,” he said. “I’m sorry, Lila. I know who youare. I can’t blame a viper for biting me, but the venom can still make me sick.”She chuckled. “You compare me to a viper now? I was hoping for something moreromantic.” She narrowed her eyes and hardened her voice. “Boy—”“My name is Bannon. Until you think of me as a person, I can’t think of you asanything but a snake.”She laughed again. “As you wish, Bannon—I’ll remember that from time to time,when you earn it. But understand that my morazeth sisters and I have alwaysfought for the good of Ildakar, and that hasn’t changed. Everyone in the cityhas the same enemy, and only a fool would hold a grudge in a situation likethis. Fight the army of Utros, not me.” She lowered her voice. “Then you’ll findthat we both deserve our rewards.”Bannon pondered that, worried that she might use his moment of distraction toattack him. He knew that what she said was correct. “All right, I’ll put asidemy grudge against you and the morazeth. For the time being.”She smiled, a genuine smile, and when she did she was quite beautiful.The morazeth and the combat arenas had been an integral part of Ildakaransociety during their many centuries hidden beneath the shroud. Lila had not beenmalicious, though it had felt so at the time. She had no emotional attachment,was simply doing her job. When she presented him with a “reward” of her body andexpected him to take as much pleasure as she did, she meant it. On thoseevenings, Lila had wrapped herself around him with wild abandon, not as a powerplay, but as a woman with a man. Considering how much battering she hadinflicted on him, the reward had not been entirely unpleasant.“Everyone here has to put aside their grudges, as you say. And we have to trainto be deadly fighters.” He thrust Sturdy into the sand, indicating he was donewith their sparring for now. Around them in the other combat pits, the battlescontinued.Lila rubbed her arms, touched a sore spot from where he had dealt her a blowwith the flat of his blade. He studied her slender form, the lean muscles, thespell markings on her skin. She was beautiful like a wild thing.No grudges …He thought again of Ian on Chiriya Island, an innocent lad who had been capturedby Norukai slavers. Ian had sacrificed himself so Bannon could get away.… Bannonhad watched the hideous raiders club his dear friend into unconsciousness. Theyhad tied Ian up and sailed away, eventually selling him in the slave market ofIldakar.Of all the things he hated, Bannon loathed the Norukai raiders the most. Perhapshe could find a way to forgive, or at least ignore, what the morazeth had done,and perhaps those women could make up for their past by saving the city from thenew siege.But Bannon could never forget nor forgive the Norukai. That was a grudge hewould hold until the end of time."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 8 [contents.xhtml#c_ch8]Waves crashed like war hammers against the black cliffs, as if the serpent godwere angry or restless, but the Norukai were accustomed to storms and high seas.The harsh waters and treacherous channels between the islands heated the bloodof the Norukai, strengthened them.The air was damp and cold inside King Grieve’s enormous Bastion, which toweredover the main Norukai island. Built from perfectly fitted black stones, itsimpregnable square walls were even more intimidating than the sharp reef spiresthat protruded from the foaming surf below.A fire roared in the cavernous hearth of his throne room, fed with logsdelivered by lumber ships that razed the coast. The Norukai were feared asraiders, destroyers, slavers, but on their rocky islands, wood was a commodityas valuable as gold and less unruly than defiant captives. The large fire in thethrone room burned constantly against the persistent damp chill.King Grieve wore a sleeveless scaled vest made from the skin of a wolf sharkthat he had wrestled into submission, hauling it up onto the rocks and guttingit while it was still alive. His arm muscles were enormous from hard work andfrom killing. The Norukai king needed to be stronger than all of his people, andGrieve often demonstrated the fact, although it was difficult to coerce anyoneto fight him, because any challenger knew he or she would die.He clenched his fists as he sat on his blocky throne, staring at the hot, brightfire. Grieve’s knuckles had been inset with curved iron plates. One blow fromhis fist would crush an opponent’s skull and drop him like a clubbed spearfish.Grieve liked to do that, although it ended the fun of a duel all too soon.Outside the Bastion, the howling wind tried to force its way inside. Breezesclawed at reinforced glass, rattled the panes. Even with the windows closed andbarred, he could hear the crashing surf. Stone buildings covered any flat spaceon the island, huddling against the persistent wind.Even as rain streaked through the air, people continued their daily business.Women were still out planting herbs and succulents in cracks in the cliffs,using every small patch of fertile land. Goat herders grazed their animals amongthe mosses and lichens. Fishermen came in with their catch, braving the waves.Grieve would feast on fresh fish, as he did each night, while most of the catchwas salted and preserved, or pressed into tanks with cabbage and vinegar thatcould ferment during the worst of the stormy season.Out in the narrow harbor sheltered by high cliffs, wood-and-iron docks held thelarger serpent ships that came in to deliver the plunder from Norukai raids. Hispeople were not so weak as to worry about the weather, and this was just a smallstorm.As he listened to the wind and thought about war, Grieve heard the clang of ironbells from the harbor cliffs. Sentries hammered the long hollow cylinders toannounce the approach of a ship. It was not an alarm, because no one would dareattack the Norukai archipelago, a hundred islands on the charts and others toosmall to be worth recording. Each one was a fortress. The iron bells rang tospread word that some raiding party or explorer had returned to the harbor.Grieve scratched his cheek, felt the long gash scar that ran from the corner ofhis lips to the back of his jaw—an intentional cut that had widened his mouth,the skin sewn up to leave his face looking serpentlike. Tattooed scales on hisskin did even more to honor the serpent god. The king had other enhancements tohis body, bone spines implanted in his shoulders, a sharpened hook through hisleft nostril. Rather than a belt, he wrapped an iron chain around his waist, andover the course of his life, Grieve had added one link for each man he hadkilled in personal combat. Now the chain belt circled his waist more than threetimes.Grieve frowned at the white sticklike figure that pranced in front of thefireplace. The great hearth looked like the mouth of a dragon ready to breathefire at the shaman who hovered there absorbing the warmth. He leaned so close tothe flames that his albino skin reddened.Hearing the bells, the pale figure cocked his head and jittered his arms. “It’sCaptain Kor! Captain Kor has returned.”“How do you know that, Chalk? It could be anyone.”“I know. The bells ring in my head. The voices tell me what I can’t see with myown eyes, and my eyes see what I can’t imagine.” Squirming with energy, theshaman left the roaring fire and danced across the cold stone floor. “It’sCaptain Kor, I know it.”Those who saw Chalk for the first time often cringed, but Grieve saw only hisfriend. Chalk was naked except for a loincloth of stitched-together fish hides.His own skin was ghostly pale, as it had been since birth. His family had calledhim an abomination, shunned him.His body was covered with countless small scars, where his skin had been ravagedwith innumerable fish bites. When Grieve was a teen, his father King Sternordered young Chalk to be thrown into a pool infested with man-eating razorfish.Their fangs tore his tender skin, drawing blood, tasting his flesh. But for someunknown reason, except that it was a blessing from the serpent god, therazorfish did not devour him. Young Grieve had dragged Chalk out of the pool andsuffered savage bites while saving him.The fish had eaten any soft and tender flesh: Chalk’s ears, part of his lips,his eyelids, his privates. The young albino recovered, thanks to Grieve’stending—but he was never the same.As a young man, Grieve had sensed Chalk’s power. King Stern was disgusted withthe outcast, but Grieve befriended the scarred and half-mad youth, listened tohis babblings. The horrific ordeal had awakened some strange manifestation ofthe gift in him, some kind of premonition.Chalk had foreseen many things and even told Grieve when to challenge and killhis father. Since then, the albino had been at his side as his shaman andadvisor. Even though Grieve often questioned his bizarre pronouncements andtried to clarify what Chalk saw in order to make the predictions useful, henever actually doubted the veracity of what the shaman knew.“Are you certain it’s Captain Kor?” he repeated, knowing Chalk would not changehis answer.“It is Kor. Three ships. He’s back. I know it, my Grieve! King Grieve! They’llall grieve!” He chattered the refrain like a mantra. He hopped from one foot tothe other. “You’ll see. Listen to the bells. The ships will dock soon. Kor willcome up, and he’ll tell you about your new war.”“What war? I haven’t decided on a war.”“You will, and you will know.”Grieve crossed his arms over his sharkskin vest and leaned back in the throne.The storm continued to whistle and howl, and cold rain slashed against the glasswindows. “If you’re correct, I’ll give you a treat.”“More fish? Can I have more fish for my tank? I like the pretty fish.”“We’ll see,” Grieve said. “But if you’re wrong, I’ll find a suitablepunishment.”Chalk skittered away, holding up his hands, touching his rough skin. “Don’t feedme to the fishes. Not the fishes. Not again. I am your Chalk. You are my Grieve.King Grieve. They’ll all grieve!”The look of abject terror on the shaman’s face gave the king pause, and he spokein a softer voice. “You know better. I would never feed you to the fishes.”“Not to the serpent god either. Don’t chain me to the cliffs.”“Not that either. You’re too valuable, and you’re my friend.”“Grieve’s friend,” Chalk said in a quiet whimper. “They’ll all grieve.”Trusting Chalk’s prediction, he knew that Captain Kor would come bearing areport of what he had seen at the city of Ildakar. Grieve looked forward to thenews. Maybe Chalk would be right about the war, too.In a bellowing voice, Grieve called for five slaves, who rushed into his throneroom. With jerky movements they shuffled reverently toward the throne, two womenand three men. During their training, many of the slaves serving in the Bastionhad bones broken and then set improperly as a reminder. Grieve kept the slaveshe needed here, while some were pressed into service throughout the Norukaiislands, and the more valuable ones were sold. Anyone here in the Bastion wasreplaceable and worthless.Grieve growled at them. “Prepare a meal to welcome our brave Captain Kor back sohe can report on his expedition. Do we have enough fresh fish in the kitchens,or must I slaughter one of you so we feast on human flesh again?”“A celebration!” Chalk cried, excited by the possibility.Moaning, the slaves skittered backward. “We have fish, King Grieve,” said theoldest male slave, a man who had survived for nearly ten years in service.“Smoked fish and fresh fish. You need never resort to human flesh again.”“What if I enjoy it?” Grieve asked, partly meaning it, but mostly to intimidatethem. “One gets tired of fish. I like other kinds of meat.”“I’ll have the kitchen prepare fish,” said the older slave. Emmett, yes, thatwas his name. The man always seemed to be here, though Grieve paid littleattention to him. He wondered how adept the slave must be. Emmett was asurvivor. Grieve didn’t normally like survivors, since that type often causedtrouble. Maybe he would execute the man and roast him after all, though seeingEmmett’s gnarled hands and wrinkled face, the king suspected his flesh would bestringy and bitter. No, it was not worth the effort. He’d let the old mancontinue in service.Chalk scuttled back to the hearth to warm himself. He jabbered about differentkinds of fish, the small ones he kept in his tank as well as some of the largeones, poisonous creatures with spines, even one that could release a jolt likelightning. The tank was an indulgence Grieve allowed his shaman and friend.By the time food was prepared and brought in on stone trays, three burly Norukaimen marched through the smoke-stained wooden doors and into the throne room.Grieve recognized Captain Kor by the pointed shark’s tooth implanted in hisshaved scalp. Each of the Norukai had their mouths slashed, their lips and facesaltered to honor the serpent god.Grieve leaned forward on his blocky throne, his chest broad, his arms bunched,the bone spines poking several inches above his shoulders. King Grieve neverrequired simpering bows of obeisance from his bravest warriors or raidingcaptains. He preferred to earn their honor, loyalty, and respect throughactions, not empty gestures. The remaining Norukai were Yorik and Lars, captainsof the other two ships on the slave-trading mission.“I told you it was Kor,” Chalk said. “He came back from his expedition. Kor,Kor, there will be war!”The three new arrivals kept their attention on the intimidating king on his highthrone. The scarred shaman made them nervous.“Tell me what you found, Captain Kor,” Grieve said. “Your report may make uslaunch our newest conquest. It’s about time.”Kor looked determined. “With three serpent ships we sailed far south to wherethe river spills into the sea, then we made our way up the estuary as before,like trading ships, carrying a load of nearly two hundred slaves. We picked upmore along the way.”“Good,” Grieve said. “I thought the coastal towns down south were picked clean,just like their forests. Our raids will concentrate on the northern coast fromnow on.”Kor bowed. “Or maybe we have a better target for conquest. We’ve traded withIldakar over the years, although the city appears and disappears. The wizardshide behind some magical shroud, but they are growing lax and I know there isunrest in their streets. Somehow, one of our own went missing the last night,and we never found his body.”“Dar,” Lars and Yorik both grumbled.Grieve stiffened. “Those perfumed fops killed one of our Norukai?”Yorik spoke up. “We can’t be sure, my king. Dar frequented the whorehouses inIldakar, and then one day he was gone. He could have been drunk and gottenhimself robbed and killed in an alley.”“We could use it as an excuse for Norukai retaliation on the city, if that iswhat you wish,” Kor said. “We could avenge Dar.”“I don’t want excuses. I loathe excuses.” Grieve clacked his iron-studdedknuckles together. “If we mean to declare war, then we’ll simply attack.”“Ildakar is our destiny,” Chalk said. “My Grieve. King Grieve. They’ll allgrieve!”The king shushed the shaman. Chalk continued his antics, but placed a hand overhis own mouth as if to hold the words in.“Captain Kor, what do you think about conquering Ildakar?”“It is a wise idea,” the Norukai captain said. “Our ship is filled with kegs oftheir bloodwine and crates of preserved meat from a creature called a yaxen. TheIldakarans produce fine silks and lavish furs extracted from laboratories andbusinesses right inside the city. The city welcomed us. They are open to moretrade.” Kor smiled with his gashed mouth. “We just need to get inside when theirshroud is down, and we can surprise them. From what I have seen, they requiredays of preparation and the shedding of much blood before they can makethemselves disappear again. We would have plenty of opportunity to attack andplunder. The city is a treasure chest of jewels and potential slaves.”“And wine,” Lars interjected.Kor continued, “The people are weak, although many of their wizards are greatlygifted.”“Wizards?” Chalk cried. “Magic can be defeated. The serpent god knows how. Chalkknows how.”Grieve turned to him. “How can magic be defeated?”“I don’t know yet. But I will.” Chalk retreated to the warmth of the fire wherehe hunched, rubbing his hands in front of the flames, staring into the embers asif looking for the answer. “I will know when it’s time to know.”When the platters of food arrived, Kor, Yorik, and Lars took seats at the longtable and King Grieve sat before the largest platter at the head of the table.He tore into the roasted fish with his bare fingers, peeling the flaky meat fromthe curved bones.“First, send that yaxen meat to the Bastion. I’m weary of fish, and I don’t likegoat. Meanwhile, I will plan for war. I have a hundred new serpent ships beingbuilt across our islands, and I won’t depart until at least fifty of them arefinished. Ildakar has been there for thousands of years. It’ll wait another fewmonths. They will fall to us, regardless.”Kor sucked on fish bones, tossed a roasted head aside. “I don’t want to wait formonths, my king. That trade mission taxed my patience, and I ache for the feelof fresh spilled blood. Give me something else to do.”Since Kor had just finished a calm journey, perhaps a good battle would satisfyhim. “I’ve been considering a raid anyway. I’ll dispatch you north. Take yourships and attack the town called Renda Bay. They somehow defeated our ships thelast time we raided, and they must learn their lesson.”“A lesson!” Chalk said. “Gut them, burn them.”Grieve said, “Leave the town empty, with nothing but ghosts.”“Ghosts!” the shaman said, touching his pockmarked skin. “Like me.” Alone amongNorukai adults, Chalk did not have a slashed mouth. His lips extended only tothe normal reaches of his cheeks, except for where the fish had torn shredsaway.Kor nodded so deeply it was almost a bow. “I accept this raid with gratitude,King Grieve.”The king had punished the previous captain who was defeated by the small fishingtown. That man had been chained to the cliffs and fed to the serpent god, so hisblood could strengthen the sea serpent, and the serpent in turn would protectand strengthen the Norukai race.“Don’t fail,” Grieve warned.“Don’t doubt me,” Kor replied.The king found the answer satisfying, and he finished his platter of fish,already imagining the taste of the promised yaxen meat."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 9 [contents.xhtml#c_ch9]“I am a wizard of Ildakar,” Renn said, puffing himself up as he faced PrelateVerna in the grand foyer of the Cliffwall archive. The stranger’s face wasflorid, his cheeks a little jowly, but sagging from weeks of hard travel. Heswirled maroon robes around him.Verna remained unruffled as she crossed her arms over her chest and steppedforward to meet the stranger. Despite his bluster, the self-proclaimed wizardflicked his eyes nervously from her to General Zimmer, intimidated by thegrandeur of the portico, the columns, the marble floors inside the enormouscliff overhang. She could sense the gift in him, but she also thought that ifshe challenged him, his bravado would deflate like a wineskin that had sprung aleak.“And I am the prelate of the Sisters of the Light,” Verna said. “This Cliffwallarchive is a priceless library of profound magical lore, available to giftedscholars who come seeking knowledge, with certain restrictions.”“It is not available to those who demand,” General Zimmer growled. The burlymilitary man had dark hair and a square jaw that showed a shadow of whiskerseven though he had scraped his cheeks smooth only a few hours ago.Renn sputtered, fidgeted, and sniffed. “You must not be aware of the archive’sorigin. The lore in Cliffwall belongs to Ildakar.” He struggled not to soundcondescending. “We are grateful that you people have been stewards of theknowledge in the interim, but my city was instrumental in creating the archivelong ago, before Emperor Sulachan purged all magical records.”Ten soldiers wearing unfamiliar Ildakaran military uniforms stood behind Renn,glancing uncertainly at the wizard. Their captain said, “Renn, sir, maybe weshould not be so—”The portly wizard waved him to silence.Hearing the rising voices, Cliffwall scholars ventured into the grand foyer.They wore comfortable wool and linen garments and soft sandals, showing littledifference between the diligent archivists and the recall-enhanced memmers.Verna calmed herself with a common exercise, inhaling and exhaling slowly. “I amaware of Cliffwall’s history, though Ildakar’s name isn’t as prominent in thearchives as you might think. My Sisters of the Light are visitors here, too.We’ve come to study the library and to guard the dangerous knowledge from thosewho might abuse it.”Other curious Sisters came into the large chamber, including Sisters Eldine andRhoda and the fresh-faced novice Amber. Verna saw owlish Scholar-ArchivistFranklin enter the foyer alongside the lead memmer, Gloria, a plump anddetermined-looking woman. Franklin wore an uncertain, welcoming smile.“Cliffwall has been hidden for thousands of years, and the camouflage shroud wasonly recently dispelled. Our knowledge is meant for all who deserve it.”Verna remained cautious. “The unwise and unschooled use of this powerful lorehas already caused several disasters, and so we must be cautious. General Zimmerand his D’Haran soldiers have sworn to protect the archive.” She narrowed hereyes. “If such powerful magic were to fall into the wrong hands, or evenuntrained hands, another catastrophe might occur.”Renn huffed. “As a wizard of Ildakar, my rank and abilities exceed those ofanyone at Cliffwall. I’ll take over here.”“No, you will not,” said Franklin. “I am responsible for the material inCliffwall.” He was normally a quiet, soft-spoken man more comfortable with booksthan with people, but his ire had been sparked by the wizard’s pompous attitude.With a huff, Gloria stepped next to the scholar-archivist. “And I represent thememmers, who have imprinted thousands of volumes in our minds. We’ve maintainedthe information in Cliffwall for millennia, and we will not surrender it.”Verna restored the edge to her voice as more scholars stood up to the party fromIldakar. “The Sisters of the Light are also gifted. You’ll find us to bepowerful enemies, all of us … if you choose to make enemies.” She gesturedtoward the increasing numbers of scholars gathering there. “Many of us have beenstudying ancient spells. If it came down to a battle, I’m sure they would loveto practice what they’ve learned.”Renn was flustered, and his florid face turned a brighter red. “But … but, I’m awizard of Ildakar!” He paused, as if those words should make them tremble.“Sovrena Thora sent me on a mission to find this archive.” He glanced at thegroup of soldiers who had accompanied him. “And I have to…”“You have found it.” Verna stood her ground, but didn’t try to provoke himfurther. “But the books stay where they can be protected.”Nine more armed D’Haran guards entered the foyer, climbing up from the cliffsideafter the intruders. Though these were only a fraction of General Zimmer’sforce, they already exceeded the Ildakaran guard. Zimmer put his hand to thehilt of his sword, and the other D’Haran soldiers did the same, threatening. Thetension in the room escalated.The leader of the Ildakaran guard escort interrupted calmly as a flustered Rennwrestled for words. “We’ve had a long and arduous journey over the mountains. Iam Captain Trevor, leader of the wizard’s escort. Maybe we should learn moreabout each other before we argue?”Quiet and introspective Franklin spoke up. “We haven’t even finished catalogingthe material yet. We don’t know the books that exist here in the archive, andour entire library of prophecy was destroyed in a, uh, magical mishap, when astudent named Elbert activated a Weeping Stone spell he could not control. Allthose prophecy books…”Verna muttered with a sigh, “Prophecy books were no longer relevant anyway, justwasted paper.”Renn looked from side to side, his thoughts spinning. Obviously, his arrival hadnot turned out the way he had imagined it after his long journey. “I want to seethe archive.”“The books will remain here,” General Zimmer said firmly.Renn’s shoulders slumped in defeat. “I don’t think Thora would even appreciateall this knowledge. She always mocked me and dear Lani for how we spent our timereading and learning.” The flustered wizard lowered his voice so that Vernabarely heard his last words. “Maybe she doesn’t deserve it.” His entire attitudeseemed to change. He deflated, as she thought he might.Verna took a step forward and spoke in a calm voice. “You’ve had a long journey,and tempers and patience are frayed. Let us get to know one another, as CaptainTrevor says. We’re just as anxious to learn about Ildakar as you are to knowmore about Cliffwall.”Gloria spoke up. “The kitchens are making cauldrons of lentil and sausage soupand fresh baked bread. Perhaps we can continue to talk over lunch?”Renn’s eyes widened at the mention of food, and Verna could almost see himdrool. The escort soldiers also perked up, looking eager.Zimmer spoke to Captain Trevor and the nine bedraggled Ildakaran soldiers. “Wehave a military camp in the valley, with provisions and a place for your men tostay. Soldiers always have stories to exchange, so long as they’re not enemies.”Trevor responded with a smile. “Yes, so long as they’re not enemies, General.For now, let’s proceed on that assumption.” He addressed his men. “We’ll go makecamp and relax. The meadows by the stream looked better than any camp we’ve hadsince leaving Ildakar.”Renn seemed reluctant to be left alone in Cliffwall, but he forced himself torelax. “The lentil soup does sound very good indeed.” The pretentious wizard hadbegun the conversation with escalating demands, but he seemed out of his depth.Verna could tell from the lines in Renn’s face and the barely concealed rips inhis maroon robes that he must have had a difficult trek overland.As General Zimmer led Trevor and the soldiers back down the steep cliffside pathto the military camp, the prelate asked the visiting wizard, “How did you evenknow to look for Cliffwall? We didn’t realize word had spread to the far pointsof the Old World.”Renn said, “We had recent visitors, strangers from far away, and a youngswordsman named Bannon blurted out the location of Cliffwall. He was travelingwith a powerless wizard named Nathan Rahl and a blond sorceress named Nicci.”Verna caught her breath. “You’ve seen Nathan and Nicci?”“Yes, do you know them? They are in Ildakar, working with the wizards’ duma.”Curious, Verna led him deeper into the archive. “In that case, we have much totalk about.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As large bowls of steaming lentil soup were ladled out and shared around thetable, intent scholars clustered around Wizard Renn, full of questions. Vernalooked at Rhoda, Eldine, Amber, and her companion Sisters, all of whom listenedeagerly.She had known that Nicci and Nathan were traveling the Old World, since they hadsent back records of their adventures by courier. In one such message, deliveredby a pair of young scholars from Cliffwall, Nicci had called for soldiers andgifted scholars to help defend the ancient archive of dangerous knowledge. Thepeople at Cliffwall had countless volumes of powerful magic but almost noinstruction in how to use it.After reading Nicci’s request, Verna had joined General Zimmer and more than ahundred D’Haran soldiers on a journey south. Much of the Old World was anunmarked map, a landscape of mysteries, undiscovered cities, and peoples. Eventhough the ancient wizard wars were over, the Imperial Order defeated, andSulachan and his undead army crushed by Lord Rahl, there were still many risksin the unruly continent.On their search for Cliffwall, Verna and her companions had come upon thecoastal town of Renda Bay, which had been plagued by ferocious raiders thatransacked and burned villages. General Zimmer had left part of his expeditionaryforce there with instructions for Amber’s brother Captain Norcross to help RendaBay drive off the Norukai slavers if they should return.It was just one step in building the defenses of the Old World as part of theexpanding D’Haran Empire. Complete security would take a long time, Verna knew,but as the Cliffwall scholars often quoted, “A book is read one page at a time,a shelf is read one book at a time, a library is read one shelf at a time.”Verna hoped Norcross and the people of Renda Bay would be safe and secure, butshe did know that three large sailing ships had remained anchored there as adefense.Cliffwall had suffered terrible tragedies when their naive scholars dabbled withmagical lore, accidentally unleashing destruction when they didn’t know whatthey were doing. Verna could only imagine how much worse it would be if a tyrantlike Emperor Jagang were to get his hands on such lore and actively use it as aweapon.As soon as they had arrived at the Cliffwall canyon, the D’Haran soldiersstudied its defenses. The archive had been built inside an alcove high up on asheer cliff, which made the place relatively secure, but Zimmer planned evenmore rigorous defenses, barricades and battlements. Even though the entrance tothe enclosed canyon was difficult to find, Zimmer wanted to increase guards.Such prominent defenses had caused consternation among the scholars, but theyhad already seen the devastation of the Lifedrinker and the monstrousuncontrolled sorceress Victoria.Now Renn scooped soup into his mouth, ravenous. “I’m used to feasts in Ildakar.Roast yaxen, fine desserts, candied fruits.” He slurped another mouthful andwiped his lips with soft, warm bread. “This would be considered food for thelower classes, even for slaves. I never knew it could be so delicious!”“We eat what the valley provides,” Gloria said. “We’ve had to be self-sufficientfor a long time. Cliffwall has little contact with the outside world.”Franklin added, “Here in the canyon we have orchards, crops, flocks of sheep.Notice the minced lamb in your soup?”“Delicious,” Renn repeated. He seemed satisfied now, and his arrogance was gone.With a sigh, he looked around the table. “I’d like to stay here for a while—onbehalf of Ildakar, of course.”“Why exactly does Ildakar need all this magical knowledge?” Verna asked. “Inancient times, wizards hid the books here so Sulachan couldn’t destroy them. Wedon’t want to create another ruthless tyrant.”“Oh, the wizards of Ildakar would never become tyrants! They would nevermisuse…” He paused. “Well, Sovrena Thora did send me here because she wanted tocontrol the power. And Wizard Commander Maxim has already unleashed somedramatic spells to protect our city.” He scratched his cheek. “By the Keeper’sbeard, I’m actually not certain why they’d want all this knowledge.” He loweredhis voice. “I’m not convinced they should have it.”He chewed on a roll, silent for a moment, then continued, “Maybe they didn’tcare. It is possible they never believed I would find Cliffwall at all. I hadonly sketchy directions, very few supplies. Captain Trevor and his men had neverled a long expedition, nor were they trained in wilderness survival. They werejust city guards.… We had a difficult time and lost three of our men on the way.It was only through luck that we even found Cliffwall, and just in time.”His expression darkened, and he seemed preoccupied. “Sovrena Thora sent me intothat mess. I wonder if she was trying to get rid of me. Thora never forgave meafter Lani challenged her rule.” He scratched his neck, patted his potbelly. “Iwas younger then. Some might even have called me handsome, but after Thoraturned Lani to stone, I just didn’t…”Renn shook his head. “I am still a loyal citizen of Ildakar, but the city is notthe sovrena. After all those centuries under the shroud of eternity, Thoraherself might have become stunted, like a tree trying to grow inside a glassbottle.” He reached across the table to grab the large serving bowl and ladledmore lentil soup for himself. “Yes, I’ve decided to stay here and learn more.Maybe the Cliffwall archives should remain exactly where they are.”Verna nodded, somewhat relieved. Beside her, always attentive, Amber listened toeverything but held her questions back. The prelate said, “Cliffwall has a lotof information, and so do you, Wizard Renn. We want to hear all about Ildakar,and any news you can tell us of Nicci and Nathan.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 10 [contents.xhtml#c_ch10]Trapped inside the walls of the city, Mrra was restless. The sand pantherprowled among the buildings, the streets, wanting to hunt, wanting to run. Shecontrolled herself, even though she longed to kill something.Through her spell bond with the animal, Nicci had felt just as caged while sheworked with the rebels in the catacombs beneath the city. Now, with the ancientarmy of General Utros besieging Ildakar, the trapped feeling increased.The people were reinforcing their defenses to stand against a long siege, andNicci wondered how long Utros and his troops could last. What did he want? Ithad been three full days since the army awakened, and the ancient soldiers werestill rebuilding their camp, preparing to press against the impregnable city.Night had fallen, and the monotonous pounding on the stone walls continued.Years ago, when the Imperial Order had begun its northern march to conquer theNew World, Emperor Jagang required that drums be beaten relentlessly, all dayand all night, whenever he intended to visit a city. It made the populationtremble in anticipation, even if Jagang took months to arrive. This hammeringsounded similar, and since Utros had many thousands of soldiers, he couldmaintain the barrage for a very long time.At night, Nicci remained in her spacious guest quarters in the grand villa. Withboth Maxim and Thora gone, Nicci kept her rooms, as did Nathan and Bannon.Restless, Mrra wanted to prowl through the dark streets to hunt rats, to jumpfrom rooftop to rooftop for the joy of stretching her muscles. Nicci refused toleash the panther or lock her inside a cage. Mrra understood that she couldn’tattack people the way the spiny wolves had done, but Nicci never forgot that thesand panther was a wild animal. If the big cat felt cornered or provoked, shewould lash out. She needed to roam free through the grassy hills, needed to huntin the forests. But how could Nicci let her out there with the enormous armylying in wait?She sat in on the edge of the broad bed, the silken curtains wafting in thebreeze. In addition to the distant pounding, she could hear the quiet sounds ofthe city, the nobles in their mansions, the cacophony of taverns and streetvendors, the silk yaxen whorehouses, people playing music as Ildakar tried tomaintain its normal life, even with the ancient army pressing on the gates.Mrra paced inside the bedchamber, brushing her tawny fur against Nicci’s knees.Nicci reached down to scratch behind the sand panther’s ears. Purringcontentedly, Mrra circled the room and stood on the open balcony, where shepricked her ears to listen to the sounds outside. She sniffed, twitched herwhiskers, then returned for more scratching. Nicci could feel her longing to befree, no matter how many enemy soldiers were out there.“You wouldn’t be safe,” Nicci said. What were General Utros and his army doing?What were they planning? Why hadn’t he sent a representative to discuss terms?Mrra growled as if to insist that life wasn’t safe in Ildakar either. Nicci feltthe animal’s sharp claws and tightly wound reflexes, and knew full well that shecould take care of herself. Though their spell bond was sharpest in dreams,Nicci could communicate with Mrra clearly. They understood each other.Then Nicci straightened with the realization that having the big cat outside andrunning free could be useful to Ildakar. Mrra could be her secret eyes where shecouldn’t see. What would serve as a better spy than a predator who could glidethrough the night unseen?Nicci leaned forward and put her hands on either side of the large feline head.The golden eyes looked up, meeting hers. “The enemy army is out there. We cansee their camp, but that’s not enough for me to make plans. Will you show mewhat you see? If I let you loose, will you be careful? Will you watch out foryourself?”The sand panther’s tail thrashed. Nicci made up her mind.“Stay to the hills, take shelter in the trees, but you can also prowl. I wantyou to see them, so I can see through your eyes.” Nicci gave a thin smile. “Bemy spy against General Utros.”Lashing her tail, Mrra padded to the door of the chamber and out into the hallsof the villa. Nicci felt her pulse racing and knew the panther was excited.“Let’s go. I’ll find one of the smaller gates to let you out, away from wherethe soldiers are hammering the wall.” Her brow furrowed. “You might actually besafer out there than we are in here.”Even though the ancient soldiers concentrated their attack near the toweringmain gate, Ildakar had smaller access points near the cliff drop-off to theriver, traveler’s entrances and secret gates for merchants farther down thewall. Nicci and Mrra wound their way through the streets, listening to nightbirds and prowling house cats that stalked along the gutters. Mrra padded aheadas they worked their way to the northern end of the wall, where it curved aroundand abruptly met the edge of the sheer bluff.Nicci found a low door cleverly hidden, covered with stone, exactly where shehad been told to expect it. She released her gift and worked the magic to undothe latch. No scout from Utros’s army could ever find these concealed entries.When the spell lock released, she swung the person-sized gate inward. A flood ofmoist air swept in, wafting up from the Killraven River below and the grassyhills stretching around the plain.Mrra’s tan body tensed with anticipation. Nicci placed a hand on the panther’sbroad shoulders, also feeling the cat’s exhilaration. “I wish I could go withyou, but my place is here in Ildakar—for now.” She bent down and wrapped herarms around the big panther’s body. Mrra rumbled with a purr, then lickedNicci’s cheek with a raspy tongue.“Go,” Nicci said. “I’ll be with you. I’m your sister panther.”Mrra bounded through the gate and loped out into the hills, vanishing into thenight shadows. Nicci felt an ache in her heart, hoping it wouldn’t be the lasttime she saw the sand panther. She knew how dangerous it would be out there, butMrra was dangerous, too.Nicci stared across the valley at the countless campfires of the siege army,blazing bonfires that would have required an entire hillside of trees just tosupply the wood. The fires looked like red, winking eyes of hungry spirits, apack of heart hounds unleashed from the underworld.Each campfire represented enough enemy warriors to overwhelm a village. If allof these ancient fighters were turned loose to pillage the Old World, they mightwell conquer the entire continent. Nicci had to contain them here, somehow. Shestared for a long moment at the fires, hearing the distant noises of theimmeasurably large enemy force.Mrra roamed free out there now, but as Nicci stood at the gate, she was the onewho felt trapped.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Long after midnight, back in her own quarters, Nicci tried to catch a few hoursof sleep, knowing she needed the energy. She didn’t want to dream, didn’t wantto think, but as she drifted off, her consciousness flew free and she foundherself inside her sand panther’s mind.Mrra was overjoyed to run wild. She had felt so crushed inside the city, and nowshe bounded along for the sheer joy of it, feeling her forepaws on the crispgrasses, her hind legs pushing her forward. The big cat was meant to be loose inthe wilderness, even though she’d been raised by handlers in Ildakar, bred andtrained to be a vicious fighter, to kill enemies in the combat arena. Mrra’sskin had been branded with countless runes to protect against a magical attack.What free panther needed to fear magic?Mrra and the two sister panthers in her first troka had broken loose from thechief handler’s cages. They had escaped Ildakar and fled across the countryside,roaming aimlessly until they encountered Nicci and her companions nearCliffwall. The three big cats had fought the humans, as they had been trained todo, but Nicci and the others killed her two sister panthers and nearly killedMrra. The sharing of blood during Nicci’s healing had forged the spell bond,making her a new sister panther. Now, Mrra would have it no other way.Unleashed, she ran into the hills, stalked among the trees, stirred up nightbirds, smelled animals in the underbrush. She also sensed other arena beaststhat had escaped during the revolt in Ildakar, but Mrra didn’t attack them. Shedidn’t even hunt for fresh meat, not yet. She was hungry, but more hungry forher freedom.In spite of her joy, Mrra also understood what Nicci needed. Her sister pantherhad asked her to prowl around the outskirts of the camp, to observe the hugearmy so that her sister could see through sharp feline eyes.In the villa, as Nicci tossed and turned on silken sheets, her blue eyes closedbut flickering back and forth, she looked in all directions in her dreams. Mrraand Nicci both saw the magnitude of the threat that Ildakar faced."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 11 [contents.xhtml#c_ch11]In his command headquarters late at night, General Utros lay awake with twonaked women pressed against him. Ava and Ruva were motionless, but he knew theyweren’t asleep. He could feel their skin against his, smooth but cold, harderthan the soft feminine curves he was used to touching. His own skin was just astough, the nerve endings muffled like a voice shouting from a great distance.Ruva stirred and, through the intangible connection with her twin sister, Avaalso shifted. Lying still, with the sorceresses on either side of him, Utrosstared up at the crosshatched roof and thought of the one woman he truly wanted,the passions that still stirred in his stony heart. He didn’t love thesefaithful twins, but they gave him what he needed.Majel had given him so much more.In his mind, she was far away in the capital city of Orogang with EmperorKurgan, the man to whom Utros had sworn his loyalty. And though he still feltbound by that oath, Utros was torn by his passions and his dogged insistence onserving both, even if it ripped him apart and destroyed everything.If the two yaxen herders could be believed, Majel was now separated from him bymuch more than distance. He had seen the lovely empress only a few months ago,according to his memories. Was it possible that he and his army had beenpetrified for centuries? That the beautiful and passionate woman was long dead?He couldn’t bear such news, if it was true. He had to know, but here on thisbroad plain, far from Orogang and the rest of Iron Fang’s empire, how could helearn the truth?If Majel was dead and Emperor Kurgan was no more than the dust of history’sbones, what was he fighting for?Utros locked away those worries in a separate section of his mind, like damminga stream. The trapped thoughts and concerns would flood him unless he found realanswers.Outside the headquarters, he heard the camp stirring. The wooden structure hadbeen raised quickly, using rough-hewn logs and branches. His soldiers had donetheir tasks well, given their minimal resources. They always served him withoutquestion, and Utros never disappointed them either. He was their commander.On his years-long military march, he’d become accustomed to traveling with afine tent, a place with furs and hangings, council tables spread with maps andbattle plans. He wanted to keep Ava and Ruva content, and now he held the twowomen in his bed, one beefy arm around each as if to crush them against his bodyand squeeze their energy into him. They lay together beneath a freshly curedyaxen pelt. It wasn’t the same as fine woven blankets or slick sheets from thepalace in Orogang, but it was a first step.The thin mattress was stuffed with dried grasses. Under other circumstances itwould have felt prickly and uncomfortable, but his hardened skin didn’t noticesuch minor things. The smoke from the braziers curled upward, escaping throughthe gaps in the crisscrossed roof. The dull red glow of burning charcoal andincense bathed the structure in comforting light. The smoke was thick, but Utroscould barely smell it. The two sorceresses had added special herbs to thebraziers, which sometimes gave him visions and revelations. Now, his dusty lungsseemed dulled to the effects.But he didn’t need visions. Utros had his mind, and he could make plans.Scouting parties had returned to the great camp with supplies, having ransackedthe homes of a few settlers in the hills, woodcutters, a lone prospector, twomen with mules bringing a load of goods to Stravera, all of whom had confirmedthe information provided by the yaxen herders Boyle and Irma.Before long, a raiding party would find the large town itself and bring backmore vital tools and materials.His invincible army would make the world tremble. Utros had swept across theland and seized an entire continent in the name of Iron Fang because he hadsworn to do so, and the general always kept his promises.Now he felt like a beggar. His vast army, though still powerful, was little morethan a collection of refugees. The soldiers had no tents and nothing to eat,even if they no longer had an appetite. The glorious city of Ildakar stoodbefore them, huge and impregnable, mocking the army with its wealth and its wayof life.Utros had to know the truth of what had happened to his army. He needed to knowwhat he was required to do next, and he had to understand the answers before hiscountless soldiers began to realize that their commander might be facing doubts.“I know you’re awake,” he said aloud. “Both of you.”Ava pulled away from him, propping herself up on an elbow. Ruva held herselfagainst his broad chest, as if trying to reassure him with the pliability of herbreasts, nipples that were hard from the lingering effects of the stone spell,not from arousal. She, too, pulled away.Lying on his back, he continued to speak. “We have to find out what has happenedto Ildakar, what’s happened to the empire. Whom do we serve now?”“We serve Iron Fang,” said Ruva, “as always.”“But what if Iron Fang is nothing more than a skeleton in a crypt, or a memoryin a history book?”The women remained quiet for a moment before Ava said, “Then you serve yourself,as we have always served you.”“I don’t serve myself,” Utros snapped. “I am not a petty tyrant. I don’t do thisfor my own aggrandizement.”“You may not, beloved Utros,” said Ruva, “but we serve you. We only supportedKurgan because he is the leader you chose to serve. All your soldiers fight foryou, not for Iron Fang. You earned their loyalty. You led them to glory. IronFang is merely a tick on the ear of a dog, drinking blood and growing bloated.”Utros sat up, tossing the heavy yaxen hide aside. “Kurgan is my emperor. If youspoke such words in Orogang, your tongues would be ripped out and burned onskewers before you.”“We are not in Orogang,” said Ava. “You know that this empire was built becauseof you, not Kurgan.”Ruva said, “The emperor doesn’t deserve you, beloved Utros, but my sister and Irespect you, so we serve your wishes.”“Cast some spell or show me visions so I can understand my place in the world.I’ll fight ruthlessly to defend what I must, but not if I don’t know!”“You already know.” Ava slid out of the bed and walked over to the brazier,tossing more dried leaves into the coals so that the smoke thickened. She wavedher hands, making the fumes drift toward Utros and her sister. The generalcaught the sweet tang of the herbs. “The yaxen herders already told you theanswers. Don’t you believe them?”Utros sighed. “I don’t want to believe them. You say that I’m the heart of thisarmy, but I draw my strength only because I serve my emperor.”And I have betrayed him with his wife … the woman I love.“I may be strong, and I may have led these soldiers to many victories,” he said,“but without my emperor, I am like a door without a hinge. He is my commander.”Ava returned to the bed and sat next to him. She began to caress his chest,while Ruva stroked his back. They touched his cheeks, the smooth skin and thedragon-burn scar.All he could think of was beautiful Majel with her long black hair, streakedwith reddish highlights when the sunshine struck her. Her almond-shaped browneyes, her tanned skin that was more beautiful than gold, her kisses, her sighs,her moans as he held her, taking her with ferocity in his tent like an animal inheat. And then after that passion was sated, a longer, slower lovemaking as theysang a song with their bodies, a secret song that Emperor Kurgan could neverhear.…“Our magic is given to you,” said Ava, lying down and draping her leg over his,while Ruva touched his thigh, then wrapped herself around him as well. They weretrying to tangle themselves in a knot of bodies and cold flesh. They had paintedtheir smooth, hairless skin with fresh, bright colors again, but he could notsee the details in the dimness of the smoky fires.“We will give you everything, beloved Utros, if we can.”“As you always have,” the general said in a soft voice, and then he responded totheir touch.The sisters had given him their devotion, their love, their energy, their faith,since they were teenage girls. They’d been considered oddities, revered in asmall mountain town, which was one of the first conquests General Utros had madein expanding Iron Fang’s empire. Ava and Ruva had been born even closer thannormal twins. Their bodies were fused, their legs melded like two soft candlespressed together.The babies might have died or been cast out by superstitious villagers, buttheir father took a terrible chance while they were still infants. As theirmother wept in despair, the father had taken his sharpest skinning knife andplaced the two connected infant girls on a table. He had cut them apart, hackingthrough the skin and fused bone that was like an intertwined tree. He had brokenthem apart, splitting their fused legs; then he wrapped the wounds that bled andbled. Their wounds became severely infected. The shrieking babies had faltered,becoming sicker and sicker.Then they had died. The spirits of the two innocent infants went to theunderworld and actually faced the Keeper. Their hearts stopped, but for only afew minutes. Somehow the village healer managed to revive them. The father stoodthere, his face sagging, horrified at what he had done. But the girls lived.They had been snatched away from the Keeper.But He had touched them.Though each had a horrific matching scar on her leg, the girls were strong, andthey healed. They tested each other. They grew up and learned how to walk andrun so that they barely showed even a limp. But they did not hide their scars;they flaunted them, wearing short shifts, growing up aloof and beautiful.When they were ten, the Keeper claimed the debt they had taken from him bykilling both their mother and father in a terrible coughing plague, leaving theodd twins to raise themselves. The village feared Ava and Ruva, but their realmagic hadn’t manifested until their blood courses came, at the age of thirteen.The young sorceresses lived in the cottage their father had built, and theyterrified the villagers. They did no work, but simply claimed whatever food theywished, the clothing they needed, by walking into other houses and riflingthrough wardrobes and shelves, walking off with what was their due. Thetownspeople were too frightened to argue with them.When Utros’s armies marched into their village, the soldiers pillaging andransacking, the town leader begged the twin sorceresses to help. Ava and Ruvamerely scoffed at him, then walked through the startled ranks of soldiers andpresented themselves before General Utros.“You need us with you,” Ruva had said.“Why?” Utros had demanded, not understanding who the twins were, although he hadseen the odd sparkle and offset gaze in their faces.“You’ll know, sooner or later.”Utros had indeed taken the twins as his own, though not as lovers. They were tooyoung, and even though they grew to be quite beautiful, he never changed hismind. When he asked Ava and Ruva what he should do with their village, if heshould subdue it in the name of Emperor Kurgan, they advised him to make agesture that could not be misread by other villages in line to be conquered. Sohe killed all the townspeople and burned the buildings, then spread the word.He’d been a brash young commander then, and the sacrifice of that one towncaused fifteen others within a day’s ride to surrender immediately to the bannerof Iron Fang.Utros never took credit for his victory, always insisted that Kurgan deservedthe power and the glory, which meant that the emperor also received the blameand the fear. Utros moved on, conquering land after land.…“We will help you fight,” said Ruva now, whispering close to his face in the dimcommand structure. “My sister and I know many spells, but for simpleinformation, there is a more straightforward way.”“I know,” he said. It had been several days since his army had awakened, andtheir siege was firmly in place. He remembered when this military force hadfirst arrived at Ildakar. They had just recovered from the disastrous attack ofthe wild silver dragon they intended to unleash against the city.Even without the dragon, Utros had brought his ranks to fill the plain and letIldakar tremble before the unspoken threat for two days before he had marched upto the city gates to demand their surrender. He’d known they wouldn’t concedeimmediately, but he could starve and strangle them over time.He hadn’t expected the wizards of Ildakar to turn his army to stone forcenturies.Those events seemed like only a week ago in his own mind.“I’ve made my decision,” he said. “We’ll demand to speak with theirrepresentatives. Our next step depends on how Ildakar responds.” He smiled, thenreached up to stroke his stiff beard and the patchy scar on his left cheek.“After we talk with them, I will plan how to tear down the city.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 12 [contents.xhtml#c_ch12]The next morning, Nicci awoke refreshed from dreams of running free and wildwhile also assessing the siege army. Now her thoughts assembled the details ofthe huge encampment she had seen through Mrra’s eyes.She joined Nathan as he emerged from his own quarters dressed in trim whitewizard’s robes enhanced with gold stitching on the cuffs and collar. After hehad freed himself from his long confinement in the Palace of the Prophets,Nathan Rahl had preferred fine ruffled shirts and tight pants, high boots, widebelts, but on their journey he’d been stripped of his magic for so long, and nowthat he could use his gift again, he had decided to look like a wizard.“Shall we solve this problem today, Sorceress?” he said with a quirk of hislips. “Save Ildakar and dispel the enemy army so we can be on our way again?”Nicci set her jaw as they emerged from under the trellises of sweet-smellingvine flowers. “Yes, that would be a good idea.”She had never shied away from difficult tasks. Even without the threat of theancient army, Ildakaran society had many raw wounds that needed to heal. Many inIldakar were selfish and aloof, takers who thought only of their own needs andnothing of the hard work, the blood and sweat of those who supplied them. Butshe had also met many strong and worthy citizens, including the followers ofMirrormask. Though the rebel leader himself had been a sham, the freed slaveRendell had shown particular wisdom and bravery, and Nicci was also sure thatnumerous merchants and lesser nobles would be worth preserving. Yes, parts ofIldakar had to be saved.When she’d led conquests for the Imperial Order, Nicci had viewed Jagang’sentire army, from the commanders to the foot soldiers, as tools, nothing more.She herself had been raised under the poison philosophy of the Order, blind tothe good in people. During her lifetime, Nicci’s tragedies and pain had turnedher heart to black ice, and when her love for Richard Rahl thawed that ice andhelped her see the truth, she herself had become the tool, the weapon thatRichard required.Nicci had felt only satisfaction when she killed Jagang, but that colddetermination was tested to its limits when she was forced to murder theinnocent girl Thistle so she could obtain the poison she needed to save theworld.That had been a prediction written by the witch woman Red in Nathan’s life book.And the Sorceress must save the world. The witch woman’s other premonition hadguided a powerless Nathan over the high mountain pass of Kol Adair to Ildakar,where he had found the heart of a wizard to restore his lost gift.Nicci had always made her own choices, pursued her own goals, rather thanfollowing the capricious winds of prophecy, but she took the life-bookpronouncement seriously. And the Sorceress must save the world.In order to win here in Ildakar, she needed to find her heart of black iceagain. She would use her skills to save the city and defeat General Utros. Thefight would require the resources, the weapons, the magic, and the manpower ofthe entire city, from powerful wizards down to the common people. She hoped theywere willing to pay the cost for their freedom.Outside the grand villa, the sound of the army hammering on the walls was amonotonous background noise that thrummed through the streets, but Nicci barelynoticed it after several days.When the pounding abruptly stopped, the unexpected silence was as loud as ascream.Nathan nearly stumbled on the fine gravel path as he walked alongside her. “Dearspirits!” He scanned the skies, gazing past the city to the tiny dots ofsoldiers on the plain.Nicci narrowed her eyes, listening to the sudden quiet. “I don’t like this.”Nathan forced an unconvincing smile. “Maybe it means Utros has decided tosurrender.”“Neither of us is that much of a fool,” Nicci said, hurrying toward the wall.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When they reached the towering main gates, High Captain Stuart was barkingorders for his sentry soldiers to be ready for an attack, but the ancientsoldiers had withdrawn beyond the fallen moats. Stuart rushed over to Nicci andNathan. “Some sort of signal came from the center of the army. The soldiersstopped their pounding and marched back.”From the high battlements, Nicci peered over the wall, noticing the chippedouter surface of the huge blocks at the base. The endless pounding had marredthe stone, gouged divots and small cracks, but the gifted wizards had reinforcedthe blocks with strengthening spells. At the base of the barrier, she saw smokestains, pools of oil, scattered boulders, and other missiles that had killedhundreds of the enemy, whose bodies had been hauled away.Out on the plain, General Utros’s army spread apart with eerie coordination, theranks forming an open path for a single man to ride forward. He sat astride achalky war mount that plodded forward like a plow horse instead of a charger.The rider wore leather armor with broad shoulder plates, a blocky helmet, and awide curved sword at his side, but he did not draw it. He rode at a methodicalpace up to the enormous gates, where he stopped.From the high parapet, Nicci looked down. The man was a craggy-faced veteran, anolder warrior who exuded power and efficiency. He stared up at them for a longmoment while High Captain Stuart and the wall guards muttered, waiting for therepresentative to say something.Finally, the scarred veteran raised a gauntleted fist and shouted, “In the nameof General Utros and on behalf of the almighty Iron Fang, Emperor Kurgan, wedemand to speak with a representative of Ildakar. We will negotiate how muchdamage your city must suffer before you surrender.” He waited.The wall guards whispered to one another, glancing at Stuart, who in turn waitedfor Nicci and Nathan. None of the other duma members had yet arrived at thewall.Nathan furrowed his brow and called down at the man on the horse, “So, you’renot General Utros, then? You are just a lackey.”The armored man’s expression twisted, then returned to stony frankness. “I amFirst Commander Enoch. I speak for Utros, and Utros speaks for Emperor Kurgan.We will withdraw our forces so you can send us your negotiator. We guarantee thesafety of your representative. The general wishes to be sensible, until you givehim reason not to be.”Enoch wheeled his horse around and rode back out to where he disappeared amongthe countless enemy soldiers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Without the firm hand of the sovrena or wizard commander, the duma members weredisorganized. For centuries under the shroud, their city business had beenaimless, but now that they faced a terrible crisis, the council members weren’tsure who would make such an important decision, or even who would speak forIldakar. No one seemed eager to volunteer.Nicci and Nathan sat among them, impatient. The duma members Elsa, Damon,Quentin, and the half-petrified Lani discussed Utros’s ultimatum amongthemselves. Oron, the newest member of the duma, had the most to say. “We haveno choice but to speak with Utros. It’s the only way we can get information.”“It’s the only way to resolve this,” Damon agreed. “What if he offers tolerableterms?”“But we can’t send our most powerful people out there,” Quentin said. “What ifit’s a trick? If General Utros holds us hostage, our city will be that muchweaker.”“He gave us his word, promised the safety of our representative,” Elsa said.“That army has pounded on our walls for days, but this is the first we’ve heardfrom the general. Aren’t we obligated to find out what he wants?”Oron agreed, resting his chin on a bunched fist. “It’ll buy us time until wefigure out how to drive them off, or how we can all escape.”“Escape?” Nathan said with a snort. “Dear spirits, there must be half a millionpeople in this city. You mean to send them all out, down the bluffs with ropesand ladders, to sail away down the river? That would be impossible.”“Not evacuation,” Quentin said. “We were thinking of other alternatives.”Nicci said, “General Utros may know nothing about what happened to him. Theyjust awakened after being turned to stone for centuries. He might not realizehow much time has passed.”Lani nodded. “I myself didn’t notice any passage of time when I was petrified.Maybe he doesn’t know that his emperor is long dead.”“His entire siege is pointless,” Elsa said. “Maybe we can make him see that.Will he see reason?”“He’ll be the desperate one. This city has been self-sufficient for a long time,and we can withstand a siege indefinitely, but all those soldiers need to befed,” Quentin pointed out. “Hundreds of thousands of soldiers without supplies.We can just wait until they all starve. We have the advantage here.”Oron laughed, a cold twisted sound. “We should send our best orator. If Utroshas no emperor to serve, we can recruit his army for Ildakar.”“Then we would have to feed them,” Elsa said. “Even if they agreed to ceasehostilities, how could the city support countless thousands more people?”“It was not a serious suggestion,” Damon said.Nathan wore a puzzled look. “No, that’s an important point. It’s been daysalready. Surely, they haven’t eaten since they awakened. There should be panic,mass desertions, yet they seem well disciplined. How can there be hundreds ofthousands of soldiers without food or shelter?”Lani had a confused expression of her own. “I haven’t felt the need to eat ordrink since I awakened.” She touched her chalky skin. “Part of the spell stilllingers. Maybe they don’t need food.”“If that’s true, they can maintain the siege forever,” Nicci said.Damon groaned. “I wish we could simply raise the shroud again and go about ourbusiness as before, when Ildakar was at peace.”“Ildakar was never at peace,” Nathan muttered. “You just didn’t see it.”Nicci pulled the conversation back to the point. “Once Utros knows that IronFang is long dead, that the empire itself has crumbled, he should realize hissiege serves no purpose. Someone should be able to convince him of this.”“Who would go out there and tell him?” Quentin asked. “I certainly won’tvolunteer. I don’t trust those bloodthirsty soldiers not to kill ourrepresentative and launch the severed head over our walls.”“Why not send Thora to do it?” Damon asked. “Let her take the risk. She insistsshe only wants the best for Ildakar, and she’s expendable.”This provoked loud, angry muttering. “We cannot trust her,” Lani said, withsurprising venom. “Not at all.”Nicci hardened her voice, disappointed in them. “You are the members of theduma. Will none of you go and face General Utros for the sake of your city? Youwill not walk out there and parley with your greatest enemy?”Elsa sighed and seemed to be deep in thought. Damon and Quentin looked to Oron,as if expecting the new duma member to accept the challenge, but he merelypicked at his fingernails with a small dagger.“Enough of this foolishness,” Nicci said. She had walked among enemy armiesbefore, had seen the worst the Imperial Order could do. “It must be done.” Sheglanced at Nathan. “Will you accompany me, Wizard? You and I can speak for LordRahl as well.”“Of course,” he said with a wistful smile. “I spent centuries studying history.If nothing else, I’d be delighted to meet the legendary General Utros himself.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 13 [contents.xhtml#c_ch13]The gates of Ildakar opened with a slow, grinding groan. All the locking spellsand protective wards had been removed by the wizards working together to releasetheir defenses. The towering slabs of reinforced wood began to creak apart onmammoth hinges.Nicci’s blond hair flowed loose in the breeze that stole through the wideninggap. Her clean black dress fit her form perfectly. Nathan was beside her, anequally striking figure, with his pale hair brushed to a silky luster and hisgold-trimmed white wizard’s robes that made him look powerful and imposing.The thirty-foot-tall gates of Ildakar weighed innumerable tons. They wereprimarily an architectural flourish, kept open only during times of completepeace and security. “We could have left through the merchants’ door,” Niccisaid, glancing at the much smaller entrance at the bottom of the great gates.“But far less impressive,” Nathan said, “and this is a time when we need toimpress them. We are not skulking about like mice, ready to scurry back into ahole. This is Ildakar, and I want to show General Utros that we are worthy ofits reputation. We’re not afraid.”When the doors swung wide with ponderous majesty, Nicci gazed across theexpansive plain. Countless enemy soldiers waited for them at a safe distancefrom the wall, having retreated to give the emissaries freedom to leave the citywithout fear of a surprise ambush.Nathan stroked his cleanly shaven chin. “I’ve studied General Utros a greatdeal, and he is an honorable, respected man. He’ll abide by the terms heoffered.” His lips quirked in a smile. “I’m anxious to meet a man who steppedright out of the history scrolls. I have many questions about the Midwar, aboutIron Fang, about his unique battle tactics that brought him victory aftervictory.” Before stepping forward, he looked through the gate at the giant armywaiting for them. “But I suppose that discussion will have to wait until suchtime as his troops aren’t trying to tear down the city and destroy us all.”“We’ll inform the general how the world has changed since he and all his peoplewere turned to stone.” Nicci lifted her chin. “Once he knows the full story, andhis changed situation, if he’s such a great commander he may embrace the newD’Haran Empire. If he devotes his military genius to the service of Lord Rahl,then Utros will have a true purpose to serve, and we will have an incomparableally.”Nathan chuckled. “Or they could be too angry to listen to reason, knowingthey’ve been stone for centuries and have lost everything from their past.”“That’s also a possibility,” Nicci said.Nathan’s expression darkened. “I have no doubt Utros will be greatly disturbedto learn what happened to the Empress Majel. She was his lover and … it didn’tend well for her.”Bannon hurried up behind them, anxious, his long ginger hair bound with a stripof leather. He wore a loose brown Ildakaran shirt, dark trousers, fresh boots.“I’m coming with you, too. I’ll protect you if the general’s soldiers try anytreachery.”At another time, Nicci would have scoffed at the young man’s offer, but Bannonhad proven his bravery before, although his exuberance and naïveté couldsometimes be problematic. Still, his presence would not gain them any additionalsafety.As gently as he could, Nathan replied, “The two of us will be sufficient, myboy. We’re counting on you to protect the city of Ildakar if we should fail.”Though Bannon obviously didn’t believe him, he stepped back with a solemn nod.The duma members and curious citizens of Ildakar gathered around watching,hopeful, but letting Nicci and Nathan take the risks.When the doors had opened to their full extent, she and Nathan set off beyondthe city walls and headed toward the battlefield. Nicci looked ahead at theswarms of soldiers separated into ordered regiments. Tens of thousands ofsoldiers lined themselves up like an honor guard, creating a clear path to thegeneral’s command headquarters.The two of them walked side by side at a confident pace. Lining the path, theancient warriors stood shoulder-to-shoulder. Some held new makeshift bannersthat fluttered in the breezes, displaying Kurgan’s flame symbol. The enemysoldiers stared straight ahead with implacable expressions, as if they hadbecome statues again. Nicci assessed their helmets, their leather vests coveredwith metal plates, round bosses, flared shoulder plates. Each face had a dustygray complexion, indicating that not all of the stone spell had faded away. Sheknew these men would be tough to kill.When the first one, Ulrich, had accidentally awakened, she wished the duma hadspent more time studying his hardened skin to discover weaknesses, but thenobles had been eager to throw him into the combat arena. It was just anotherone of the duma’s demonstrably bad decisions.Nathan muttered, “These look like very worthy fighters.”“Our only concern is General Utros. If we can change his mind, then we won’tneed to worry about the rest of his army.”The two reluctant emissaries walked along the clear path, not hurrying. Niccifound the eerie silence of the gigantic army noteworthy. The army camps of theImperial Order had been a ruckus of constant activity—chopping wood and grindingsteel, clanging practice swords, the screams of captives, the coarse laughter ofgambling men, shouted orders from lieutenants and captains. The army of Utrosseemed ominously subdued.They approached a wooden building constructed of rough-hewn logs decorated withpaints, makeshift fabric banners, scavenged materials, since the army’spossessions and equipment had deteriorated over the centuries.Four guards stood outside the door of the headquarters, and a tall, weatheredman whom Nicci recognized as First Commander Enoch emerged from the structure.“The general is ready to see you,” Enoch said.Nicci replied, “We’re eager to resolve this matter, so he can take his army andbe on his way.”The battle-scarred veteran looked from Nathan to Nicci. “You are the leaders ofIldakar? The wizard commander and the sovrena?”Nathan chuckled. “No, not at all. The city’s leadership has changed since yourlast encounter.”“We are visitors to Ildakar, but your siege has trapped us here,” Nicci said ina crisp voice. “We’ve come to speak for the city, as neutral representatives.”She looked past Enoch into the headquarters. “Are we supposed to discuss termswith you, or with General Utros himself?”Enoch gestured them inside. With the wind blowing their hair around them, Nicciand Nathan entered the crude but sturdy structure, which was lit by openwindows. Pungent smoke wafted from braziers on either side of the main room.General Utros sat stiff-backed in a sturdy wooden chair at a table. He was asubstantial man with broad shoulders and a powerful chest. He had a neatlytrimmed gray-brown beard, except for a waxy patch on his left cheek, where asmooth scar showed the remnants of a serious burn.On a rough bench beside him sat two striking women in gossamer gowns that clungto their curves. They were obviously twins, their heads entirely shaved, theirskin painted. Nicci could sense the gift emanating from them and realized thetwins were sorceresses.She and Nathan stopped before the table and pointedly waited for the general tospeak first. Utros remained in his chair, but gave them his full attention. “Icommand the army that will conquer Ildakar. Your fate depends on how reasonablethe city can be.”Nicci ignored the twin women and spoke only to the general. “We’ve heard thatyou are a wise man, General Utros. Let us see you prove your wisdom. Do you evenknow what’s happened to you and your army? How much time has passed? What wasthe fate of Emperor Kurgan and Empress Majel?”The general seemed angry, leaning forward slightly. “I have heard wildlyimpossible stories.”Nathan intervened, speaking in a conciliatory voice. “Now, we haven’t evenfinished introductions yet! This is the sorceress Nicci, and I am the wizardNathan Rahl. I was once a powerful prophet, too, but prophecy is entirely gonenow.” He sighed and brushed down the front of his white robes. “I’m not sure youknew that. So much has changed in the world.…” He gestured, acknowledging thetwo sorceresses. “As you will come to see, the underpinnings of magic arefundamentally altered. Before we begin, let me tell you about the state of theworld. There’s much you need to know before you can make a wise decision on whatto do with your army.”Utros frowned with a mixture of skepticism and anger.Nathan placed his hands together and spoke as if he were lecturing to gatheredstudents. “Over the centuries I’ve fancied myself something of a historian, so Ican fill in the gaps for you. And yes, I know much about you, General Utros.Your exploits are legendary. As you’ve probably guessed, your entire army waspetrified by a spell from Ildakar. Your ranks stood as stone figures exposed tothe elements for fifteen hundred years.” He paused to let the number sink in.“I’m afraid everything you knew is gone, General. Kurgan’s empire is dust.”The two smooth-skinned sorceresses muttered to each other. Utros grew stern andtroubled, leaning forward in his sturdy chair. “So we have heard, but the ideais preposterous. We’ve seen no proof.”“What more proof do you need?” Nicci interrupted in a firm voice. “Where areyour tents? Your camp? Your supplies? Everything disintegrated with the passageof time. Centuries have gone by, and history has left you behind. All that youknew has changed.” She hardened her expression. “Surely you realize your bodieshave a lingering infusion of stone, because the spell hasn’t entirely worn off.Accept what you know is true.”As Utros growled, Nathan intervened again, folding his hands together with asmall, polite bow. “If I may, Sorceress? Your own conquests are legendary,General. Speaking as a scholar, I’m impressed to talk with such an imposingpersonage. You are seen as a seminal figure in military history, until you andyour army disappeared. Now we know what happened to you. Nevertheless, yourbattlefield tactics and your conquests have been studied for more than athousand years.”Utros remained determined. “I’m not interested in your flattery, Wizard. Iconquered those lands for my emperor. I serve Iron Fang, and he ordered me toseize Ildakar. I intend to do so. I would never betray him.”Nicci scoffed. “Oh? Now that’s an interesting comment, considering you took hiswife as your lover. Wasn’t that a betrayal?”Utros shot to his feet, looming before them in his half-stone body. “That wasdifferent! Majel loved me.” His eyes flicked back and forth, a gray gaze thatstruck Nicci, then went back to Nathan. “How can you even know this? It isimpossible.”Nathan explained, “We know because history knows, dear general, just as historyknows everything. All was revealed as Kurgan’s empire crumbled. You and EmpressMajel weren’t as discreet as you thought with your affair, and this is aterrible story that was told to students for centuries. After conquering much ofthe Old World, your army marched away from Orogang, ordered by Iron Fang tocapture Ildakar. But then you and your armies vanished, as did Ildakar itself.The complete disappearance of such a vast army was a mystery that historianshave debated for centuries.”Utros knotted his hands as he gripped the edge of the rough-hewn table. On onecorner rested his imposing helmet, adorned with curved bull horns. “But whatabout my emperor? And … Majel? What do you think you know? What happened to her?And to the empire?”Nathan sniffed. “Alas, I’m afraid that without your military to hold ittogether, Kurgan’s empire crumbled. It didn’t last a decade after you were gone.The man you served, and betrayed, is long dead.”Nicci spoke into the silence. “There is a new emperor now, a worthy master foryou to serve. His name is Richard Rahl, and we are working to consolidate theselands under the rules of fairness and freedom. That’s why Nathan and I came toIldakar, only to find ourselves caught in this unnecessary conflict. Lord Rahlis a new, worthy master for a great and honorable military leader like yourself.We hope you and your army will agree to serve him.”“I serve Emperor Kurgan,” Utros insisted.“And we serve you, General Utros,” said the two sorceresses in strange harmony,shifting on their bench.He glanced at them. “These are Ava and Ruva, my advisors and powerfulsorceresses. We don’t fear any magic Ildakar brings against us.”“What you seem to fear is the truth,” Nicci said. “Emperor Kurgan is gone,nearly forgotten. Join the D’Haran Empire as one of Lord Rahl’s greatestgenerals. You no longer need to conquer Ildakar.”“I need to conquer Ildakar, because I swore to do so,” Utros said stubbornly.“Kurgan is my emperor, not this upstart Lord Rahl, who is nothing more than aname to me.”“I assure you, Lord Rahl is much more than a name,” Nicci said with a hint ofthreat in her tone. “And he is alive and powerful, unlike Iron Fang and yourmurdered lover.”Incensed, Utros said, “Murdered? How did she … they die? What happened to them?”“It didn’t end well, I’m afraid.” Nathan continued telling his story. “IronFang’s own people rose up and overthrew him. The mobs killed him because of whathe did to…” He hesitated. “It’s rather unpleasant, General. Are you sure youwant to hear the full details?”“What did Kurgan do?” Utros demanded. Then the lines on his face softened. “Whatof Majel?”“The emperor executed her,” Nicci said, using the words like a barbed lash.“When Kurgan discovered Majel’s love for you, he skinned her alive in public.Then while she slowly died, dripping blood in the city square of Orogang, heplaced flesh beetles on her body, and they burrowed inside her. I understand shescreamed for days.”“No!” Utros cried. “Emperor Kurgan wouldn’t…” His words trailed off as herealized that the story sounded all too probable.“That is the man to whom you swear your loyalty,” Nicci reminded him.“The story is true, I’m afraid,” Nathan said. “If you knew Emperor Kurgan as yousay you do, then you’ll believe me. Was he not violent and mercurial? What doyou think he would have done once he found out about Majel’s betrayal? With hisbravest general?”“It wasn’t a betrayal!” Utros cried in a hoarse voice. “She still loved him, butshe also loved me. I gave her what her husband could not, and I also gave theemperor what he could not achieve on his own. I loved her, but remained loyal tohim.”“History has already been written, General,” Nathan said. “Both Majel and Kurganare spirits now, and the veil has been permanently sealed. No spirits can everreturn from the underworld.” He explained Richard’s star shift and how he hadended prophecy and healed the breach forever.Utros bunched his fists into boulders, but he somehow contained his rage. “Idon’t believe you.”“You know in your heart that we’re not lying to you,” Nathan said. “How else doyou explain what you see and feel?”The sorceresses rose from their bench. One of the women said, “Perhaps we’llhold these two, beloved Utros, and peel the truth from them, just to be sure.”“You could try.” Nicci returned their glare. “But I wouldn’t recommend it.”Nathan said, “You promised us safe passage, General. Are the legends not trueabout your honor?”“Go from here!” Utros shouted. “Return to your city walls, while I consider howbest to tear them down. I will conquer Ildakar, as I swore to do. It doesn’tmatter if Emperor Kurgan is gone. I have my mission, and I must succeed. That’sall I need to know.” He pounded a fist on his table hard enough that the freshwood splintered. His horned helmet slid to the ground. “Go!”Nicci and Nathan withdrew as First Commander Enoch pushed them out into the openair again. The sudden gust of wind caught Nicci’s long blond hair. Thousands ofsoldiers framed the way for them to return to the gates of Ildakar."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 14 [contents.xhtml#c_ch14]Grieve observed from the high wall of the Bastion, pleased by the progress.Captain Kor’s raiding vessels took only four days to reprovision for the raidagainst Renda Bay, and soon they were ready to launch from the main island,joined by three more serpent ships. Kor’s previous expedition to Ildakar wassecretly to identify the vulnerabilities of the great city for possibleinvasion.This time, Kor had a more standard Norukai mission, and King Grieve haddifferent expectations. The raiders would sweep into the defiant fishingvillage, capture as many slaves as they could, and fill their ships with walkingmeat to be sold at various markets. Captains Kor, Lars, and Yorik would kill anycaptives that wouldn’t fit on the boats, and then the rest of Renda Bay wouldburn. It would be a profound lesson to the rest of the world.For the raid, Kor took several hundred seasoned Norukai warriors, scarredmuscular men and brutish dangerous women, but they needed the rest of the roomon the ships for the captives they would take.After the misty storm passed, Grieve drew a deep breath on the high openbattlements, studying the fanged mouth of the harbor. The six serpent ships werea swirl of activity as the raiders piled aboard. The broad-beamed ships withlong oars and distinctive midnight-blue sails would strike fear along the coast.Each ship’s prow bore a ferocious carving of the serpent god, guiding theraiders to victory.Watching the expedition prepare to depart, Grieve longed to go on a raid againhimself. He remembered the ecstatic younger days when King Stern had sent himout to toughen him, to temper him with blood, or let him die on the battlefieldif he wasn’t good enough. That was the fate of failures.Salty wind whipped around the Bastion’s rooftop, but the sky was a bright blue,the waters relatively calm. Though Chalk liked to remain inside by the fire,today’s sunlight was bright enough that the pale-skinned shaman joined him,hopping about and burning energy to keep himself warm.“Renda Bay, Renda Bay!” he said. “Don’t think about Renda Bay.”“Why shouldn’t I? Kor will destroy the town, then we never need worry about themagain.”Grieve reached into his yawning mouth, scratched out a morsel of the yaxen meathe’d eaten for his midday meal. Grieve liked the taste much more than tiresomefish or gristly goat. Yet another reason that he needed to conquer Ildakar.“Renda Bay, Renda Bay!” Chalk rubbed his hands together as he looked over thebattlement, gaping down at the six serpent ships tied up to the docks far below.The shaman was so awkward and reckless that he nearly fell over the edge, but hekept himself in place with a scrawny arm. “The war is with Ildakar, my Grieve,King Grieve! They’ll all grieve! Ildakar, not Renda Bay.”“Kor will destroy Renda Bay and come back in time for the war. We are stillbuilding our ships.”“Renda Bay!” Sounding like a crow, Chalk shook his scarred head and scuttledbackward without speaking further. The skin of his shoulders, his arms, his backwas pockmarked from the bites of hungry razorfish.The Norukai king heeded Chalk’s visions, but the shaman was also eccentric,damaged. Patchy hair grew in bristly clumps around his head, wherever thefollicles could poke through the scar tissue. Chalk swiped his knuckles acrossdrool that leaked from his damaged lip. He stood in the sunlight and turned hisface to the sky, bathing his bare skin in the warmth.Even though the terrifying past ordeal had given Chalk his ability to seevisions, Grieve still resented his father for allowing it. Grieve had been tooyoung then to defy King Stern, and he had barely known Chalk, certainly not wellenough to give his life to save the strange creature. After pulling the albinofrom the pool filled with razorfish, young Grieve had wrapped the torn andmutilated boy in sailcloth and tended him.The other Norukai had assumed the freak was dead, but young Grieve rowed himacross the inlet to a small neighboring island, little more than a hummock ofrocks and grasses that poked like a stump above the waves. That was where theblind old fish woman kept her cottage, a woman whom many Norukai used as ahealer, especially when their slashed mouths grew infected after the ritualcutting. The old woman was an expert in scars.Grieve took Chalk to her and, using all the power of command he had learned fromhis father, told the old woman to save the boy. Without arguing, she coatedChalk’s torn skin with greasy, foul-smelling ointments made from guano and fishliver, and she wrapped the albino with strips of cloth, encasing the entire bodylike a cocoon.Grieve couldn’t let King Stern or any other Norukai know that he tried to savethe misfit they had meant to sacrifice. He secretly rowed over to the fishwoman’s island every day and watched Chalk recover. Finally, when the scarredpale boy was conscious enough to speak, he gazed at Grieve with his oddlyshifted eyes. “Don’t kill your father yet,” Chalk said, out of context, speakingfrom nowhere. “Let me tell you when it’s time. I will know.”Grieve responded with only silence, staring at the blind fish woman, whopretended not to have heard. Until then, Grieve had never even consideredkilling his father. The idea of ruling the Norukai islands had felt so far inthe future, but Chalk seemed absolutely certain. Grieve had felt goosefleshcrawl up his back and arms. He believed that Chalk would know and would tellhim.And he had.Over the years he had visited the hundred main islands that formed the Norukaiarchipelago, as well as the coastline that the raiders pillaged and stripped ofits resources. They forced slaves to cut down the forests, leaving the hillsidesbare after seizing the wood, and they used slaves to mine in the mountains foriron, gold, and silver. But Grieve had always wanted more. Now, he intended toget it.He agreed with the shaman’s prediction and Captain Kor’s assessment of Ildakar.If they took over the legendary city, that would plunge a knife through theheart of the Old World. From there, the Norukai could spread in all directions,up and down the Killraven River, blockade the estuary, swarm up the coast allthe way to Tanimura and beyond.Thousands of years ago, the Norukai tribes had been wild and fierce. They foughtin countless tribal wars, leaving wreckage and sorrow in their wake. But whilethey ravaged the land, the Norukai were not organized enough to be invincible.When Sulachan’s powerful empire rose, the tribes were hunted down because theyproved to be uncontrollable. When they refused to swear loyalty to Sulachan, theemperor ordered the extinction of the entire people. His armies drove theNorukai to the sea, and they retreated to countless defensible islands. Thedeath toll on both sides was immense.In the millennia since, the Norukai grew powerful again and took their slowrevenge. But it was too slow.Such impatience was one of the reasons that convinced Grieve to overthrow KingStern. And now his father’s skull, picked clean by the fishes, rested as acenterpiece in Chalk’s glass-walled tank in the throne room where he kept hisfavorite specimens.Grieve and Chalk had become friends, and the albino shaman was devoted to hissavior. Grieve had slain nine rude Norukai warriors who made the mistake oflaughing at the strange young man, and after that, the other Norukai left Chalkalone, showing a grudging respect for Grieve, if not the odd shaman.The king insisted on leaving Chalk behind when he went out on raids, even thoughhe valued the shaman’s visions. Chalk was not a fighter, and Grieve knew thatsometimes the walking meat could become violent. Whenever Grieve came homescarred with battle wounds, his friend was overjoyed to see him safe.Once, before a typical raid, the shaman was inexplicably terrified. Grieveintended to accompany four ships south to raid a mining village they had notpreyed upon for fifteen years. The children they’d left alive would be grown upnow, the population fat and lazy. It should have been a simple raid, but Chalkbegged Grieve to stay home. He wouldn’t explain why, but he grew more frantic,his jagged voice shrill. “Don’t go, don’t go!”Grieve would never admit he was afraid, but Chalk’s insistence chilled him. Theother Norukai were puzzled as to why he would back out of the raid, but he owedthem no explanation. When one brutish female warrior, Atta, laughed too loud andpressed too hard, Grieve broke her nose and shattered her cheekbone, injuringher so severely that she had to stay home from the raid as well.Grieve learned later of a tremendous storm that had swamped the raidingexpedition. Three of the ships were sunk outright, and the last one attempted tolimp home, only to be set upon by vicious selka. The undersea creatures tore thevessel apart, and only three survivors were found in the wreckage. If Grieve hadgone along on the raid, he would have died.From that point on, he always listened to Chalk, even if he didn’t understandhis mysterious predictions.Now, in the harbor below, iron bells rang out, the clangor ricocheting along thecliffs louder than the roar of the ocean and the whistle of the wind. The sixserpent ships set their dark sails and engaged their weather spells to catch thewind. Muscular Norukai manned the oars to drive the vessels like knives out ofthe narrow, protected harbor. The iron bells continued to ring.“Renda Bay, Renda Bay!” Chalk scuttled up to him again. “Plan for Ildakar, andthe whole world, my Grieve, King Grieve! They’ll all grieve.”“I’m building my fleet,” he said. “We won’t invade until our fighters are ready.Our navy will be like a school of sharks.”As Kor’s raiding vessels sailed away from the main island, Grieve shaded hiseyes and gazed across the water to the misty hummocks of other islands dottingthe sea, with barely navigable passageways through the reefs. On the leewardside of the islands, long docks had been built where more ships were beingconstructed, in addition to all the serpent ships that already existed. Grievehad ordered the nearest mainland stripped of lumber, the tallest trees seizedfor masts, with other logs to be sawn into hull planks. Ribs curved along thekeels, growing into fearsome serpent ships, dozens and dozens of them.Each island had its own master wood carver, and skilled artisans used knives andchisels to fashion a distinctive figurehead, a unique representation of theserpent god for the bow of each ship, one great vessel for every main island.Thirty new warships had already been completed in the past two weeks, with fiftymore under construction and dozens more planned. From the top of the Bastion,Grieve heard the distant hum of activity as Norukai shipbuilders took advantageof the good weather to make swift progress.King Stern had taken far too long to launch his war against the mainland, andyoung Grieve had lost patience. When Chalk told him it was time, Grieve hadn’thesitated. He had challenged and killed his father. Stern hadn’t led the Norukaito the glory they deserved, but Grieve would.Now, as he surveyed his extensive, growing navy across the water, he knew it wasonly a matter of time.“They’ll all grieve,” he muttered to himself, and Chalk grinned."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 15 [contents.xhtml#c_ch15]Inside his headquarters structure, General Utros brooded in darkness, wrestlingwith disbelief and dread certainty. The sun fell behind the western hills in thedirection of Kol Adair, but even before darkness gathered, Utros pulled theshutters closed. Inside the dim, stuffy building, Ava and Ruva built up the hotcoals in the braziers, filling the shadows with orange fire, and then acridherbs. The smoke that swirled around the enclosed room had a bitter smell, butnot as bitter as what Utros had learned.With so many small kingdoms and principalities in turmoil after his armiessmashed them, news would have taken a long time to travel across the Old World.Could it be that Utros had conquered the continent, crossed over the mountainpasses and placed Ildakar under siege, in the name of an empire that had alreadycrumbled? How could history be so cruel? How could time have abandoned him afterso many unparalleled triumphs?And yet, in his heart, he believed what Nathan and Nicci had told him. He couldnot deny the evidence.For now, with the door and windows closed, with guards stationed outside so thatno subcommander would enter with a report, Utros kept only the sorceresses withhim, but even their powerful magic could not drive away his doubts.Iron Fang was truly gone, his empire crumbled into dust by the march of time.Empress Majel, beautiful Majel, was also dead in the most horrible wayimaginable. Utros would have mourned his beloved in any case, but to know thather own husband had flayed the skin from her creamy shoulders, her roundedbreasts, her flat stomach, her smooth thighs …Utros squeezed his eyes shut, picturing Majel’s classically beautiful face, andthose shimmering dark eyes that had gazed on him with so much love and forbiddenpassion. When they were together, she had felt such joy to be held in the armsof someone who wanted to love her, rather than possess her.And then she’d been killed by the man she married, killed by the man to whomUtros had sworn his loyalty.He was also the man Utros and Majel had both betrayed.“Can it be true?” he asked aloud, looking at Ava and Ruva. He seemed to bepleading with the sorceresses to tell him otherwise.The sisters had freshly painted faces, their cheeks swirled with scarlet andyellow, their necks adorned with a smear of indigo, outlined in crimson. “Howcan it be false?” Ava said. “You feel it, beloved Utros. You know you do.”Ruva added, “I could not cast a spell to verify the truth when the emissarieswere here, but I saw no doubt or deceit in their eyes.”Ava took a step closer. “Emperor Kurgan is certainly gone, but our loyalty isnot. You are, and have always been, our leader. Those hundreds of thousands ofsoldiers follow your commands, no matter who is emperor.”“As I follow my emperor’s commands,” Utros said, struggling with his ownloyalty. “When we departed from Orogang, I swore to complete my mission, and Idid not need to receive any further instructions from Iron Fang. Even with thisdamnable stone spell, how is anything changed, just because more time haspassed? I still have to conquer Ildakar.”“The city must fall, if that is what you need,” Ava added. “Your soldiers willdo what they swore to do. For you.”Ruva’s voice picked up so swiftly that the twins seemed to speak the samethoughts. “And after Ildakar falls, you can set yourself up as its militaryleader, a new ruler for a modern empire.”Utros was troubled by the thought. “No, that would make me feel an even greatertraitor.” The image of Majel flashed before his eyes, and he set it gently asidein a different part of his mind. “I am a military man, not a power-hungrydespot. I don’t do this for me.”“But your army needs a leader,” Ruva said. “Command them. Do what you know youmust.”“Perhaps you’re right.” He wrestled with his fists, knotted his fingers, twistedhis arms, trying to limber up his stiffened skin. “I am a hunter, and I have myeyes on the game I intend to kill. Before I worry about how I’ll preserve themeat for winter and distribute it among the storehouses, first I must kill theprey.”“Ildakar,” said the women in unison.Utros closed his eyes, blocking them out, setting aside all distractions. Avaand Ruva likely thought he was making military plans in his well-ordered mind,mentally positioning groups of soldiers, dispatching huge companies in differentdirections to overwhelm the surrounding lands. His forces could bottle upIldakar and press upon the walls, which would perpetuate the terror inside thecity, even if Ildakar’s magic-enhanced barriers held against the attack.But Utros couldn’t stop thinking about Majel. His stony expression masked hisdisgust at how she had died, so much blood and pain. He should have been therewith her. He should have saved her, but he couldn’t imagine how their love hadbeen exposed. What had he and Majel done wrong? They had been so careful! Whatwas their mistake?Though he longed to write his thoughts every day, he had sent Majel only a veryfew letters, which he asked her to burn as soon as she read them. Even if shedid keep them, who would dare rummage through the private possessions of anempress? And no courier would break the seal to read the letters.But what if Iron Fang had questioned why a military courier would bear a secretsealed message from his general to his wife? Had Kurgan intercepted and read oneof his letters? The courier was sworn to deliver it only to its intendedrecipient, but would a courier defy a direct order from his emperor? No.Utros knew his ruler all too well. Kurgan was the man who sat upon the throne inOrogang, but he was capricious and reckless. What Nicci and Nathan had saidabout how history viewed Iron Fang was correct. Emperor Kurgan had achievedgreatness only because of the victories and wise leadership of his greatestmilitary leader. Utros had conquered the Old World, and Iron Fang had been leftto rule it, despite his inability to administer such a vast realm.Perhaps Kurgan had understood that himself. Maybe he’d felt inadequate, jealousof his talented general. He would have realized in his heart that the victoriesbelonged to Utros, and his army and his citizens knew that also. When thevolatile ruler discovered he was an inadequate lover as well as leader, Kurganwould not have been able to endure it. It was another victory General Utros hadwon over him. Iron Fang would have exacted his revenge on someone weaker thanhe, a person whom Utros loved. Majel.Yes, he could very well believe Kurgan had skinned his own wife alive, then fedher still-living body to flesh beetles.Utros winced, struggling to bear the vivid portrait his fears painted for him.Had Majel cried out his name, holding on to her love for him even as her bodywas torn apart? Or had she begged her vile husband for forgiveness, denouncingher betrayal and swearing her loyalty to him again? It would have done her nogood.Utros knew the clash of honor and need in her soul. He himself could barelystand the constant tug of war between his loyalties. He had made a sacred vow toserve Emperor Kurgan, and that was the core of his being, and yet his heart hadgone over to Majel. How could he reconcile that? Loyalty or love? So long asKurgan hadn’t learned of their passion for each other, Utros was able tocompartmentalize his duty to Iron Fang as separate from his love for Majel.But now, if his beloved was murdered and their affair revealed, and if the veryempire had fallen, how could Utros balance anything? What was his reason toexist? What about his orders, his mission to bring down Ildakar?He squeezed his eyes closed and felt the tears burn there. He remained deep inthought until he purged the emotions, turned them into stone so that theycrumbled into dust within his heart.Finally, he opened his eyes to find Ava and Ruva waiting intensely, their eyeslocked on his face. He couldn’t even hear them breathe.Utros said, “We still have to bring down Ildakar. I must complete my orders.” Hethought about how he had challenged the legendary city fifteen centuries ago.“The wizards of Ildakar were very powerful once, but if the stone spell hasfaded, then we know their magic is weaker than it was before.” He narrowed hiseyes at them. “And yours is still strong, I hope.”Ava and Ruva nodded. “We have the gift as before, and now we are enhanced withthe strength of stone, as well as flesh and blood. That makes us more powerful.”Ruva added, “We know secrets that others don’t.” Outside the headquarters,twilight thickened, but the brazier light remained a dull, throbbing orange.“Nicci and Nathan may have inadvertently left something behind, something we canuse against them,” Ava said.Her twin smiled. “Yes, they were not careful. They don’t suspect the power thatresides in every scrap of themselves. But we do.”Before the two representatives had arrived for the parley, the sorceresses hadtended to each other, using a knife to scrape their eyebrows, scalps, arms andlegs, every patch of skin, removing the tiniest bit of hair, which they burnedin the braziers. Then they clipped their nails, also feeding each bit to thefire. They had made sure that not the slightest speck of their bodies could befound by an enemy.But Nicci and Nathan were careless.Ava and Ruva intensely scoured every place where the sorceress and the wizardhad stood. The women crawled about, scanning the rugs on the floor, the edge ofthe door, any place the two visitors had touched. Utros didn’t ask why. Theywere searching for something.Ava combed her fingers over the rough wood of the doorframe, squinting in thelight of the braziers. Then, with a cry of triumph, she produced a single goldenhair caught on a splinter in the wood and snapped off. Their faces filled withdelight and anticipation, the two sorceresses inspected the fine yellow strand,which obviously belonged to Nicci.“Now we have what we need.” Ruva’s eyes shone.“Nicci may be a powerful opponent with great magic of her own,” Ava said. “Butshe is a fool to leave us a weapon such as this. My sister and I would nevermake such a terrible mistake.”Holding the strand, Ruva carried it close to the brazier so the ruddy lightsparkled along its delicate length. The hair looked as fine and ephemeral as aspiderweb. She dangled it over the glowing coals, and her sister bent close,both of them looking hungrily at the single hair.Utros could sense the magic building between them. Though he didn’t have thegift himself, he had watched the twins perform for him before. They would notlet him down.Ava lifted the strand high. “We have a day or two of preparations to make, butwith this single golden hair, we can work great magic. And we can target Nicci.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 16 [contents.xhtml#c_ch16]Now that Nathan had looked General Utros in the eye, he realized the ancientcommander would never withdraw his siege. He had seen the determination in thelegendary leader’s eyes and his refusal to give up. With everything else lost tohim, the siege was all Utros had left.After Ildakar closed the gates and sealed itself tight again, the duma wouldspend days debating the reports he and Nicci had brought. Nathan knew in hisheart that the city needed some other means to fight back. No straightforwardclash was going to defeat the gigantic army.“We have to find another way out of this siege, my dear,” he said to Elsa asthey walked together the following day. “And considering the legendary glory ofIldakar, I’m sure its gifted citizens can come up with unexpected magic. Itmight not be another petrification spell, but surely they can offer something.”“Oh, we will.” Elsa was a handsome woman with a smooth face, a little too broadto be delicate. Her warm brown eyes were filled with intelligence and humor aswell as patience, and she had certainly been patient with Nathan, especiallywhen he couldn’t use his gift. She had helped nurse him back to health afterFleshmancer Andre replaced his flawed heart with that of the dying Chief HandlerIvan. Nathan felt a twinge in his chest, a flare of pain along the scar. Thump,thump. Thump, thump. But the new heart was strong, his gift was restored, andNathan was a wizard again.“When Utros first came against us with his army, the wizards experimented withmany types of magic,” Elsa said. “They didn’t fear the effects of their powerand paid little heed to the consequences. They wanted to protect Ildakar, nomatter the cost.”The two of them walked along the edge of the bluff that dropped in a sheer cliffto the river below. The uneven rock face was dotted with a succession ofplatforms and walkways that led into tunnels for supplies brought up from theriver. She gestured farther downstream, toward the tangled swamps that infestedthe land to the south. “Look there, the ancient wizards flooded the river valleyand turned it into a deadly swamp.”Elsa wore a purple silk robe, which was comfortable rather than extravagant.Even as a duma member, she wasn’t concerned with the pomp and finery of herposition. She had always been considerate, trying to strengthen the society ofIldakar, keeping others content. She had owned household slaves, but treatedthem well. She even purchased extra servants she didn’t really need, just tokeep them from the combat pits or other reprehensible jobs.After Mirrormask’s uprising, Elsa had spoken to her restless household slaves,riled up by the mob mentality sweeping through Ildakar. That night, Elsa herselfhad been covered with dust, ash, and blood from fighting alongside Nathan andNicci to defeat the cruel sovrena. She had told her own servants they could gowhere they wished, but she hoped they would stay here in their home. Most ofthem had remained.Knowing Elsa’s gift, Nathan asked, “Is there any way we can use yourtransference magic to defend ourselves? Or to attack General Utros?”“It’s always possible.” She stroked her chin in an unconscious imitation of hismannerism. He found it endearing. “I could put an anchor rune here in Ildakar,but in order to work the transference magic, the complementary symbol has to beat the target. For example, I could draw a rune next to a roaring fire inside myvilla and then transfer that heat and make General Utros burst into flame.” Shepaused. “But someone would have to draw the corresponding rune on his chest. Idon’t think he’d stand still for that.”“I doubt it. Still, let’s use our imaginations. Think beyond the usualpossibilities. Maybe there’s something else.”They watched a barge arrive from upriver filled with crates, casks, and sacks,food supplies that Ildakar would need, because of the renewed siege. Ildakaranworkers climbed down the walkways and staggered platforms to meet the barge atthe docks. The river workers appeared tiny at the base of the bluff as theyunloaded the cargo. Straining laborers pulled on ropes, turned cranks, andlifted the heavy containers up the cliff to platforms and receiving tunnels.“We’ll send word up and down the river,” Elsa said. “Ildakar needs all thesupplies other villages can provide, and we’ll pay dearly for it.”“The city can last quite some time against a siege,” Nathan said. “You wereself-sufficient under the shroud for all those centuries.”Elsa nodded. “But as you said, the underpinnings of magic have changed. Thepetrification spell faded away. The changes from Richard Rahl’s star shift areonly beginning to show their repercussions throughout the world.”Nathan’s new heart twitched, as if reacting to the suggestion. “At least thebreach in the veil to the underworld is sealed, and we no longer need to worryabout the Keeper or an undead army.”Elsa said, “We have enough enemies in the real world.”As they walked, she told him about her life in Ildakar. She had been happilymarried to a wizard named Derek, a kind man with a strong gift and an interestin crafts and music. Derek had demonstrated genuine magic when he played hislute, which could produce music more moving than any spell.After years of marriage, Elsa had teased him about his growing potbelly, andDerek had responded by telling her it was to make sure her love for him wasgenuine. Then one night Derek had choked to death on a fish bone after dininglate in his quarters. No one had been there to help him, and Elsa found him thenext morning. She had mourned his loss for the better part of a century, but nowshe was able to tell stories of her lost husband with a wistful smile and asparkle in her eyes.Having listened to her tragic tale, Nathan asked, “And you took no otherhusband, not with all the other nobles and wizards in the city?”She glanced shyly at him. “I never found a man who could match Derek’s kindnessor his charming interests.” She made a dismissive gesture with her hands. “I’mno longer a flighty young woman looking for the excitement of romance. I have agood life as it is.”Nathan self-consciously stroked his white hair behind his shoulder. “Ah, mydear, I’m sure you still have that flighty young woman in you somewhere. I cansee it behind your eyes and in your shy smile.”She turned away, but not before he saw the flush on her cheeks.Elsa mentioned ancient vaults in the lower levels of Ildakar, which had beenused as chambers and laboratories by the earliest wizards. “The gifted were morepowerful in those days. They developed magic so terrible that they were afraidto use it. At the time, there was no need for it.”Nathan thought briefly of the powerful magical lore in the Cliffwall archive,but Cliffwall was far out of their reach now. “It appears we do have the need atpresent. If you have any suggestions…”“There are places here in Ildakar that no one has thought about in more than athousand years,” Elsa said. “Behind the shroud of eternity, we didn’t face anyoutside dangers, and we never dreamed the stone army would reawaken.”“Do you remember where some of these places are?” Nathan asked.She led him down one sloping street to the next, emerging into broader openareas, marketplaces, stockyards, warehouses, the sprawling districts of noisy,smelly crafts, such as blacksmiths and tanners. Elsa and Nathan greetedcarpenters who were sawing logs, furniture makers busy at their craft, despitethe siege outside. Weavers stood outdoors by their huge looms, making fabricwith intricate patterns that might have been magical, or just decorative.Some workers looked at the two strangers with suspicion, but Nathan gave them awarm wave. Elsa led him past roughhousing children, a barking dog, a smithsnipping thin strips of iron and pounding them into nails, which he tossed intoa wooden bucket.Where the city met the plain, large sandstone hummocks like weathered tanbunkers were all that remained of crumbling old structures that had once beenthe towers of weathermancers and astronomers. After the gifted had moved up tothe higher levels of the city, these ancient buildings had become storage silos,communal dwellings where workers lived, or simply piles of scrap material to bereused. Some of the sandstone hummocks had stone doors leading to innerchambers, still sealed.“This one here.” Elsa took him to a sandstone island that had been thefoundation of a grand building weathered away long ago. She found the doorbricked shut. “It was a vault of some kind. Only the most important wizards weregranted access, but I could never find any record as to what it was exactly.”“Then shall we find out?” Nathan paused in front of the bricked-up barricade,touching the solid blocks with his slender fingers. They seemed as impregnableas the base rock itself. “I see one problem, however.”Elsa touched the thick stone next to Nathan, letting her fingers brush againsthis. “That’s easily enough solved.”Nathan stepped back. “I can unleash my gift and blast this open.”“Yes you could, but let’s not resort to that. I’ll use my transference magicinstead.” She went to the nailsmith, who ceased his loud hammering when Elsaasked if she could borrow a bucket of water.Handing her an empty wooden pail, he pointed to a trough. “Anything to helpIldakar,” he said, with no apparent irony.Nathan filled the bucket for her and carried it to the bricked-up barricade. “Doyou mean to splash water on the blocks and make them dissolve?”“Of course not.” She dipped her finger into the water and drew a symbol on theside of the bucket. Before the pattern could run or evaporate, Elsa dipped herfinger again and drew a larger version of the symbol on the solid barricade.“There, anchor rune and corresponding rune. Watch.”When she completed the design, the bucket trembled. The surface of the waterrippled with concentric rings that shuddered inward, then reflected outward. Thestone barricade also shifted.The water in the bucket grew murky, muddy, silty. The stone blocks in thebarricade softened and slumped. The mortar holding them together ran likeliquid, while the water in the pail solidified into cement. The bricks loosened,several of them dropping to the ground.When her magic was complete, Elsa said, “Now, just knock them aside.”“Remarkable.” Nathan pressed his palm against the stones and shoved. Withalarming ease, the blocks tumbled inward to expose the large inner vault. “Thatwas far simpler than I expected. It seems transference magic is quite effective,if one knows how and when to use it.”With the barricade gone, Nathan and Elsa entered, each calling up a globe oflight in the palm of a hand to illuminate the chamber. They found themselves ina cool shadowy place that smelled damp, with a tang of metal, not just rust butthe indefinable undertone of silver and brass. Instead of a store of magicaldevices or a great library of secret spells, though, the chamber held only a lowcircular wall in the center of the room, like a well. That was the source of theodd smell.Elsa frowned. “I was hoping for more. Is it another water source? Why would theykeep it enclosed and hidden?”Nathan felt a chill, and with it a sense of exhilaration. “I’ve seen somethinglike this before. That’s not just a well. It’s a sliph.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nathan gave only hints of what he and Elsa had found as he persuaded Nicci toaccompany them with all due haste. “Even with my gift restored, this discoverydoes me no good, Sorceress, because it requires both Additive and SubtractiveMagic. You will be the one who has to use it.”Entering the newly unsealed chamber, Nicci stepped forward and ignited her ownlight as she studied the low circular wall. Damon, Quentin, and the palesorceress Lani had also joined them, curious about the find that had sparkedsuch enthusiasm from Nathan.“What is it?” Damon asked, glancing at Elsa. He seemed skeptical. “What couldpossibly be so exciting about finding a hole?”“It is more than a hole,” Nicci said, stepping forward. She could feel thepossibilities rise within her. “It’s a sliph well, a kind of transportationnetwork.”Lani frowned. “What is a sliph? I’ve never heard of it.”“The sliph is—was—a woman transformed into a creature of great power. Anyone whohas both Additive and Subtractive Magic can travel great distances in the sliph,in almost no time. I have used it before.”“Do you think this sliph is still alive?” Nathan asked. “Can you travel throughit?”Nicci placed her hands on the stone rim and peered down into the moist,metallic-scented depths. The well seemed to have no bottom, no standing water,just an emptiness that went on forever. She sensed no stirring, heard no noise.“I have experienced two different sliphs before, and this could be one of those,or another one entirely. Ildakar is far from any other destination I know of.This could be part of a separate sliph network with destinations throughout theOld World.”Thoughts circled in her mind. Could she perhaps travel back to the People’sPalace to tell Richard and the entire D’Haran Empire about the ancient army? Fornow, Ildakar was isolated, under siege, and far from any help.“Maybe once I see what Utros intends to do to Ildakar, I will travel and spreada warning to other cities.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 17 [contents.xhtml#c_ch17]Much as he’d come to despise the city of Ildakar, Wizard Commander Maxim beganto reconsider leaving civilization behind. On his fifth day out in thetreacherous swamps, he was bedraggled, wet, muddy, and hungry. Clouds ofbloodthirsty insects were constantly on the attack.As he crashed through thornbushes and razor-edged sawgrass, Maxim used his giftto disentangle himself from a ropy spiderweb. He reached a mound of mossy dirt,rotten branches, and clumps of reeds. With resignation, he realized this waslikely the best spot he would find to camp.His black pantaloons were rumpled and muddy, but at least the tough Ildakaransilk had not torn. His yaxen leather boots kept his feet dry, except when heplunged up to his knees in the muck, and then water ran inside.He paced around the disappointingly small island and listened to the burble andsplash of creatures moving through the sluggish waters. He dragged togetherslimy fallen branches covered with moss, making a pile of sodden wood for hisfire. It would take great mastery of the gift to keep himself dry and warmthroughout the night, but he was one of the most powerful wizards in Ildakar. Hecould certainly manage a campfire.He arranged the rotting wood in a haphazard stack, giving up on finesse. With awave of his hand, he released his gift into the branches and logs, and flashedthe moisture into steam, which hissed out and dried the wood. He sent a sparkinto the middle, careful not to explode the whole pile into a conflagration.Soon enough he had a crackling, popping fire as the darkness deepened.Claiming another log for a makeshift seat, he brushed away the rough bark beforesettling down. It would be another uncomfortable night. He thought longingly ofthe spacious beds in his grand villa in Ildakar. He could have slept on silkysheets, feeling cool breezes wafting through the windows, no doubt sated fromsex with one of his many partners in the pleasure parties.Or, he might have lain beside the cold and venomous Thora, whose icy demeanorextended beyond her flesh and deep into her spirit. Maxim shuddered now andleaned closer to his fire. No, even this was better than being with her.Nearly two thousand years ago, his love for Thora had been genuine. Thoughts ofher consumed his emotions, his actions. They’d been inseparable, loving eachother with a passion that even minstrels could not adequately chronicle.Together, the sovrena and wizard commander had built great magic to rule thecity they had claimed, like guardians. Thora had dreamed of shaping the perfectsociety, every slave, every worker, every merchant serving Ildakar in their ownway.That had been Thora’s dream, and because Maxim’s mind was dulled by love, he hadlet his wife have her way. The thought sickened him now as the night swampbuzzed around him. He couldn’t believe how gullible he had been. Maxim was sucha powerful wizard himself, why had his heart been so weak? He could have stoodup for himself and shaped Ildakar according to his wishes, rather than hers. Atthe time, he’d been a fool to think that was what he really wanted. And maybe ithad been, but desires changed, needs changed, and Maxim’s interests had waned.Ildakar had been his greatest triumph, but over centuries of stagnation, he’dgrown bored with it.When fighting the siege of General Utros, Maxim and Thora had been united withthe other wizards of Ildakar. Such triumphant days, days with purpose! Even apassion that burns so bright, however, will eventually run out of fuel. Thegreatest love could not last forever; that was simply human nature.Thora had a perfect body, a face whose beauty went beyond the ability ofsculptors to capture, but her once-sweet kisses had grown tasteless, the softcurves of her body and her warm flesh felt like an old worn garment. Hisadoration for her turned to scorn.The city of Ildakar, built upon the map of dreams that Thora had drawn, becamebitter and stale. Most citizens didn’t even notice the changes. Ildakar was likea beautiful porcelain vase, shot throughout with countless hairline cracks.Maxim wanted to smash it.He had become Mirrormask, toying with unrest among the slaves and lower classes,feeding their doubts and anger. It had been a delightful exercise, which amusedhim for some time. The downtrodden people had been so hungry for a savior, ahero, and by playing a mysterious gray-robed figure who hid behind a reflectivemask, Maxim had given them what they longed for.At first it was a game, and Maxim enjoyed duping the needy people. But as hisplan grew more complex, he realized he had stumbled on a way to undermine thefoundations of the nobles, the duma members, the arrogant wizards—and especiallyThora. The entire city was dry tinder, and he supplied the spark.The revolt had been his finest hour. He watched the slaves unleash the combatanimals, rile up the arena warriors, and run wild through the streets. Maxim hadfelt an erotic thrill to see his plans come to fruition, aided by thecharismatic sorceress Nicci, who truly believed in the goal.Maxim had succeeded, and Thora had been deposed, but he fled Ildakar, notwanting to become a victim of its internal collapse. Adding more fire so hecould be sure the great city would crumble, he undid the unique petrificationspell he had developed, so that the countless soldiers in the ancient siegecould awaken. How he wished he could simply sit back to watch events unfold!Instead, he was alone and miserable in these swamps, though the misery was ofhis own making. Sitting on his moss-covered log in front of the snappingcampfire, Maxim used his gift to dispel the water from his clothes and cleansehimself so that he felt more comfortable. Yes, he had the power to control hisenvironment. He didn’t have a lavish, silk-covered bed in the grand villa, buthe would survive. In fact, he thought of himself as the king of this entireswamp, a domain of mud and bugs and scaly creatures.At least he was a king, and this was a new beginning.Uprooting a green willow stick from the edge of the hummock, Maxim probed in thesluggish water and found a large bottom-feeding fish. With a release of hisgift, he stopped its minuscule heart. Seconds later, the dead fish floated bellyup, within reach. Maxim pulled it out of the water, gutted it, and threaded thewillow twig down its mouth so he could roast it over the fire for his dinner.He sat in silence listening to the ominous, yet comforting, hum of nightcreatures. He heard a heavy splash and cracking branches, but knew the largepredators wouldn’t bother him—or if they did, they would regret it.He watched the fish skin blacken, curl, and slough off, leaving pale meat thatclung to the bones. The buzzing whine of bloodsucking insects swept around hishead, drawn not to the scent of the roasting fish, but to him. When one of thelarge gnats bit his neck, he flinched. With an annoyed thought, he conjured hispetrification spell and cast it out in waves so that all the flying, bitinginsects turned to tiny grains of stone and dropped out of the air. Now he wouldhave peace long enough to eat his meal, but more of the pests would soon come toplague him.Maxim’s thoughts drifted as he chewed the tender fish. He reminded himself,again, that living with Thora had been worse than this.Suddenly, out of the shadowy night thickets, a demon appeared—a woman. Adessa,the morazeth leader. He saw murder in her eyes.She had a lithe body, a hard-bitten expression, and a weapon in each hand, ashort sword and a dagger. Her exposed skin glistened in the orange light of thecampfire, covered not only with branded runes, but with scratches, welts, andswollen insect bites.The sight of her was so incongruous, Maxim could only gasp.“I’ve been sent to kill you.” Adessa slashed with her short sword, cuttingbranches and shrubs out of the way so she could lunge toward him.Maxim scrambled back from his campfire, blurting out, “What are you doing? Iforbid this! I am your wizard commander.”She charged toward him without speaking another word. A different warrior mighthave let out a bloodcurdling yell, but Adessa was a silent killing machine.Maxim reacted instinctively, releasing his gift to hurl a ball of fire at her,but the protective morazeth runes made the flames ripple harmlessly aside. Sheswung her sword at him as he jumped over the log, and the blade struck the mossywood with a loud thunk.She stumbled on a soft divot in the muck, and Maxim sent his magic into thecampfire, blowing it up in a surge of flame. The fire didn’t burn the protectedwarrior woman, but the sheer flash of light and heat made her reel backward,giving him a chance to dart away.Maxim plunged across the hummock and sloshed into the muddy water. Adessa leapedright through the surging flames, and her hard and merciless eyes glittered inthe sparks of the blaze. “Sovrena Thora has ordered me to kill you and bringback your head. I will not fail.”He had seen Adessa fight many times, had watched her defeat Nicci in the rulingchamber after the sorceress challenged Thora, and he had seen Adessa fight herwarrior trainees or slay powerful monsters in exhibition bouts in the arena. Sheseemed to enjoy it. Maxim could never fight her in that way. He wouldn’tsurvive.He lashed out with a fist of wind, tried to knock her backward, but the runes onher skin protected her. Instead, he used the wind to rip branches loose and hurlthem at her like clubs. She battered them away, striding toward him as if hewere a yaxen caught in a slaughterhouse pen.Maxim ran through the watery channel, struggling in the soft mud, sinking up tohis knees. Adessa had little difficulty running after him.With a burst of magic, he made the water boil behind him. Steam curled up,blinding Adessa. He couldn’t concentrate on manipulating his gift while he fledfor his life. He was the wizard commander! He could resist, he could delay her,but he knew that Adessa was relentless, and she was a morazeth. He didn’t knowwhat he could do, where he could hide.In the end, the swamp saved him. As Maxim churned through the muddy water,splashing steam and tearing up bushes and vines to throw at her, Adessa keptcoming, paying no attention to the other dangers in her environment.But two large swamp dragons lay in wait among the reeds, ready to lunge out atunsuspecting marsh deer or wild boars. The armored lizards scuttled toward themorazeth with jaws that could snap a tree in half.Maxim sprang onto another hummock and swung himself over a fallen tree whileAdessa turned to face the unexpected swamp dragons. She hacked with her sword,and the blade struck sparks off their gray-green hides. The first swamp dragonsnapped at her, driving her backward. The second dragon closed in, lunging forher leg, but Adessa jumped up with an angry snarl of her own. She concentratedon fighting the pair of giant lizards.Maxim spared only a glance for her as he ran off into the night. He didn’texpect the swamp dragons to kill her—Adessa was too skilled a fighter forthat—but the monsters would keep her busy long enough to give him a chance toescape.Now that he knew the morazeth was hunting him, he would never let down his guardagain."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 18 [contents.xhtml#c_ch18]Though the city and the people had betrayed her, Thora still believed thatIldakar was hers. Its wealth, its legend, its very soul and society enduredbecause of her, no one else. She had stood in the ruling tower and surveyed thesweeping buildings, the levels of society from the outer walls to the pinnacleof the plateau. She had ruled it all, protected it all.And Ildakar had turned on her. They didn’t appreciate what she had done for themas sovrena, how much they owed her for their very existence. If Utros and hisinvaders now ransacked Ildakar because the people had no powerful leader, thenmaybe they would understand. She hoped they would realize their mistake beforeit was too late.The stone walls of the cell surrounded Thora like a throttling grip. Sheclenched her fist, felt her stiff knuckles and fingers bend according to hercommand, but the lingering taint of stone was still inside her because of thedamnable spell that Elsa, Damon, and Quentin had hurled upon her.This small, unlit dungeon deep in the bowels of the bluff left her alone indarkness with her dark thoughts. The door was sturdy wood half a foot thick,mounted to the jamb by three iron hinges riveted with long metal pins that hadrusted in place. A heavy deadbolt and an imposing wooden crossbar held the doorshut.Sovrena Thora knew these dungeons, because over the centuries she had dispatchedcomplaining nobles and restless citizens down here. The incarceration had beenfor their punishment, sometimes for their own good, always for the good ofIldakar. And now she was trapped inside, just like one of them.Thora was the most powerful sorceress the city had ever produced. Her rule hadendured for more than fifteen centuries. With her gift, she should have beenable to blast away the door or shatter the stone walls, but wizards had wardedthese cells long ago. The wooden door and the surrounding stones were chiseledwith protective runes that nullified any magical attacks she might unleash, justlike the symbols branded onto the combat animals or the morazeth.She thought briefly of faithful Adessa and knew the morazeth leader would findand kill the despised Maxim, as ordered. Thora wished she could witness theexecution herself, because her hatred for her husband went beyond even her angerat falling from grace and becoming a prisoner now. Thora resolved to be returnedto her rightful place in Ildakar by the time Adessa brought back Maxim’s head.Alone in the dark cell, she hardened her fist, felt her way across the blacknessuntil she reached the wall where only the vaguest gray blur penetrated thesmall, barred window in the door. Even the tunnels were unlit, since no onewould waste wood or transference magic on burning torches down here. Thedarkness and gloom were part of Thora’s punishment, but she refused to considerit a punishment. The darkness was her friend now, a place where she couldcontemplate her situation and make the necessary plans.She pressed her palm against the cold, smooth stone. She felt the slime of algaethriving in the shadows, but the sensations were muted, her nerves dulled by theheaviness in her flesh. Her once-sensitive fingers were clumsy as she traced thesurface, so she squeezed her hands into hard fists and pounded on the stoneblock just like the half-petrified soldiers of General Utros continuallyhammered the city’s outer walls.With the muffled thud of the impact, she felt only a distant echo of pain.Curious, she struck with her other hand, harder, but despite her pounding, thesolid blocks held fast, her dungeon secure. With one last slam of her knuckles,she stepped back. If she’d been entirely human, she would have battered herhands bloody, but she just felt a dull throbbing, with no real damage done toher hands or to the wall.She needed to get out of here. Ildakar would fall without her.Maxim was responsible for this current turmoil, but she blamed the treacherousduma members who had overthrown her, convicted her, cast the stone spell,especially the meddling sorceress Nicci, who had been the catalyst for so muchdisruption. Nicci and her impotent wizard companion had come to Ildakar seekinghelp, claiming to be nothing more than travelers with a message from the D’HaranEmpire, but Thora had suspected them from the beginning. Nicci really wanted tobecome the next sovrena, to take Ildakar for her own.Now the outside sorceress had the city, and Thora was locked in a dungeon whileNicci and the others faced an invincible army from the past. Thora knew thatparts of Ildakar remained loyal to her. In the darkness, she envisioned theglorious buildings, terraced gardens, orchards and olive groves that she herselfhad built. Such a marvelous, perfect city.A flash of anger heated her face. By the Keeper, how she wanted Nicci and theother traitors to fail and die horribly! Thora pounded uselessly on the stonewall again.She worked her way around the cell and encountered a low stone bench whose frontcorner had broken away. The jagged edges had been smoothed by the worrying,sweaty, even bloody fingers of other desperate prisoners over the centuries.The sovrena had a narrow waist, delicate features, and thin, graceful arms. Shenever considered herself weak, but she did not rely on physical combat when shefought an enemy. Even though her body felt heavy and dull with lingering stone,she did feel the gift still burning in her heart. She held out her hand andsummoned magic, lighting a small flame, which winked into existence like abobbing candle in her open palm.The cheery flame was a bright glimmer of hope, casting a yellow glow around thewalls. Now that she could see the details of her confined prison, she noted thespell runes around the doorway. Even though she knew it was useless, shesummoned a larger blast of fire and hurled it against the wall, but the flamesmerely splattered and scorched the slime into a foul-smelling stain. Her firecurled around and ricocheted from one protected wall to another. Thora flinchedas the flames lashed back and struck her, too, but her hardened skin protectedher before the fire flickered away into a dull glow.In wonder, Thora rubbed her arms where the flames had touched her. She felt atingle, saw a scorch mark on her gray-white skin, but she rubbed it away. Therewas no damage to herself, nor to the cell. It was no use. She couldn’t get out,no matter how badly the people of Ildakar needed her to save them.She spent the next hour hating Maxim for what he had done, for his plan to turnthe slaves against the very city that nurtured them and asked only theirdevotion in return. How those weak people had whined at the injustice, at thehard work they had to perform, without seeing that she herself suffered more forIldakar than any of them did! No one was more aware of the painful cost of theirprosperity than Thora was. The slaves had sore muscles, perhaps, and some evenlost their lives, but what was the cost of a few lives to build a civilizationthat endured for millennia? She despised those who refused to make the sacrificefor the greater good of Ildakar. She had certainly given everything.Then Maxim had uprooted the underpinnings of her beautiful society. She’d lovedhim long ago, and now she couldn’t understand how she had been such a fool. Wasshe just young and naive, driven by the heat of romance and lust? Over centuriesof sharing his bed, then sharing the beds of many others, Thora had learned thatlust could be easily satisfied without surrendering her heart, or even commonsense. She had wasted the best years of her youth on Maxim, letting him cheat onher, learning of it, forgiving him. She had turned her heart to stone longbefore any petrification spell, realizing how worthless he was. But the wizardcommander was too powerful to be discarded, and she had kept him as her husband,in name only, a figurehead.Now, Thora realized she might have overestimated his power. She had been in aweof his great petrification spell, just as she had been instrumental in the greatbloodworking that formed the shroud of eternity. She could do it all herself,though. She didn’t need him.It was clear that Maxim’s magic must be waning if the stone army had awakened.No wonder he had fled. But perhaps Thora’s gift was also fading. The shroud ofeternity had dissipated over the years before they had brought it down entirely.She had been willing to work the final blood magic to restore the shroudpermanently, but would it truly have endured?The underpinnings of magic had changed, the fundamental rules of the worldaltered in ways she didn’t understand. Nicci had offered an explanation,although Thora didn’t entirely believe her about what Richard Rahl had done.But, Utros and his army had indeed awakened, and Thora herself had revived fromthe petrification spell. Yes, much was changing, and she had to use that to heradvantage.Maxim hadn’t needed magic to create his revolution among the gullible lowerclasses, to turn those mindless animals, human animals, loose to destroy hercity. The rebels followed him, all the while cheering for a foolish dream theyhad not earned.As anger and frustration welled within her, Thora lashed out again, opened herfingers to slam a trembling quake of magic against the wall like a mastiffbattering the sides of a cage, but the spell runes deflected her onslaught, andthe magic dissipated without any effect.Thora sank back and let the flicker of fire die in her hands. She gripped thechipped stone bench and listened to the resounding silence again.Darkness made the time pass interminably, and she didn’t know how long shewaited before she saw the light brighten in the corridor outside. She heardheavy footsteps, hard boots, the jangle of keys. She heard gruff voices, sawshadows outside the barred window.With a scraping sound, the crossbar slid aside as it was removed from its metalrests, followed by a squeak and clank as the deadbolt shot back. The hingesprotested as two burly guards pushed the door open. Light poured into the cell,making silhouettes of the two men from their torches, but Thora’s eyes adjusted.One man, with black stubble on his chin and a helmet askew on his wide head,wore an ill-fitting armored vest taken from the city guard. He obviously wasn’taccustomed to such a uniform. With a pang, she remembered how dashing HighCaptain Avery had looked when he guarded Thora and also served as her lover. ButAvery had been slaughtered in the streets by Mirrormask’s rebels, and Thora knewit was no accident. Maxim—Mirrormask—had done it just to spite her, out of anacid twinge of jealousy.These two guards were obviously rebel slaves who now felt important, havingtaken unearned uniforms. The first man looked at Thora with a hungry sneer andspoke in a blunt voice that made her doubt the extent of his vocabulary. “We’vecome to you again, Sovrena. Are you lonely yet? You might be partly stone, butyour skin looks smooth enough. If we spread your legs, would you be soft and wetwhere it counts?”“I doubt you would be hard enough to find out,” she retorted.The second guard snickered at the insult.Thora continued, “Or maybe I would crush your soft little member, like betweentwo stones.”Struggling for words, the gruff guard proved that he did not, indeed, have muchvocabulary.The second guard carried a tray with hard bread, a cup of water, and a smallbowl of gruel. “We brought your food, but if the siege lasts longer, we mighthave to cut off prisoner rations.”Thora wasn’t hungry. Even though this was the third time guards had broughtfood, she’d never felt the need to eat or drink. The water did nothing for herand the food just felt leaden in her stomach. When the guard approached, shesmashed the meal out of his hands, and her hardened fist split the tray down themiddle. The guards scampered backward as the broken dishes clattered to the cellfloor, uncertain of what she could do.“I don’t want any rations,” she said. “I want my freedom.”“That’s beyond our ability to give, Sovrena,” said the second guard.Still stinging from her insult, the first guard said, “We’ll leave you with yourown company. And the dark. And the rats.” He huffed. “You can think about me inyour dreams.”The second guard looked at her with scorn. “I liked it better when you were astatue in the ruling tower. It’s what you deserved.” He looked down at thebroken tray and crockery. “No more rations for you. We’ll save the food for thegood people of Ildakar.”With a grunt of effort, the guards pulled the door shut. Keys turned in thelock, and the deadbolt slid into place again. They rammed the crossbar onto itsrests.The men departed, extinguishing the torches behind them. She sat on the stonebench in darkness again, extended her hand, and called forth the magical fire,playing with the flame as it bobbed and danced in her palm."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 19 [contents.xhtml#c_ch19]From behind the safety of the high walls, Bannon watched. He wanted to fight,wanted to do something, but how could even the entire city stand against such anenormous enemy?His greatest hurt, though, came from the night of the revolt and the terriblecircumstances that had built up to so much violence. His thoughts turned to thetreacherous young men who had claimed to be his friends. False friends. Hisheart was torn by what had been done to him. Amos, Jed, and Brock had set him upand done nothing to save him, hadn’t even bothered to tell Nicci or Nathan whathappened when he was captured and dragged down into the training pits. Yes, hehad survived the ordeal—scarred, and maybe even stronger for it—but how couldfriends do that to him?The answer was obvious: they had never been friends at all.When Lila recently sparred with him, she had urged him to put aside his grudges.In order for Ildakar to endure this crisis, the city could not tear itselfapart. The besieging army was dangerous enough to force them to set aside theirdifferences.Jed and Brock, though … their actions were malicious. Led by Amos, they hadtaken the young and naive outsider under their wing to show him their city, butthey had done it only to trick him, to mock him. But Bannon was not just somegullible fool.Now he strapped on his sword and shored up his courage, knowing he couldn’tavoid this any longer. It was time he confronted the two surviving young men andmade them understand what they had done.His fingers clenched around Sturdy’s leather-wrapped grip, his forearm bunched,and he could feel the ripple of hard muscles—muscles that had grown strong fromhand-to-hand fighting and wrestling, from swinging weapons. Bannon was strong inhis heart and mind, too.He left the grand villa and made his way to the headquarters of the skinners’guild and Lord Oron, the newest member of the duma, who was Brock’s father. Theyoung man paid no attention to the tightly packed grapevines on narrow terracesalong the steep hillsides or the clustered orchards of dwarf fruit trees. A fewworkers were out picking grapes, harvesting apples, plucking green olives fromthe trees. Much of the work had simply been abandoned after the uprising. Thefreed slaves were indignant and many refused their responsibilities. “Let thenobles get blisters picking crops for a change.”Others, though, understood that if the city were to survive this siege, theywould need all the food Ildakar could produce. Former slaves would starve justas quickly as nobles did. Those who went back to work did so by their ownchoice, out of responsibility rather than oppression. Their families, at least,would have something to eat.Bannon wore simple clothes, feeling uncomfortable in a fur-lined cape orbillowing pantaloons, which were the height of Ildakaran fashion. Despite hismany adventures, in his heart he still thought of himself as a farm boy fromChiriya Island. He would never lose that core.Amos, Jed, and Brock had considered him to be beneath them, but theynevertheless dragged him to the silk yaxen dachas, trying to get him to partakeof the pleasure women along with them. At first he was sure they were teasinghim, or maybe the three really wanted to make Bannon just like them. Silk yaxenwere women created and trained to be nothing more than beautiful bodies to servethe pleasure of their customers. They supposedly couldn’t think, couldn’t feel,but Bannon had always felt sorry for them.Amos had treated the silk yaxen Melody the worst. On the night of the revolt, hehad raped her, slapped her, bruised her, and she finally responded, using ashard of broken glass to slash his throat. That same night, seven other silkyaxen had killed their abusive customers. Afterward, they reverted to their meekand pliable state, not denying their crimes, but passively accepting them. Withall the other turmoil going on in Ildakar, Bannon wasn’t sure the women wouldever be called to account for their crimes. Justice had indeed been served inits own way. He couldn’t help but think of how his own mother had been beatenand murdered by his father.But Jed and Brock had never faced what they had done to him, never admittedtheir own responsibility. Did they feel sorry at all?He approached Oron’s mansion, which was connected to a long outbuilding wherethe skinners’ guild conducted their operations. He drew on all the strength hehad developed since leaving Chiriya, since joining Nicci and Nathan on theirlong journey. Though Bannon didn’t know what he expected from Jed and Brock, heneeded to do this for himself.No one answered when he rang the small brass gong outside the mansion’s entry.Hearing activity inside, he tentatively pushed open the door and was surprisedto see several servants lounging in comfortable chairs and sprawled on a divan.“Excuse me. Didn’t you hear me knock?”The servants sneered at Bannon. A middle-aged man propped himself up on an elbowon the divan. He wore a slave shirt of drab rough-spun cloth, but he had piledsilken sheets, fur-lined cloaks, and scavenged jewels around himself. “Keeper’scrotch! Lord Oron can answer his own damned door. Why should we do anything tohelp you?”Bannon was unsettled by their attitude. “Because I fought beside you during therevolt. I escaped from the combat pits and helped stop the great bloodletting atthe pyramid.”“Then, what do you need with Oron?” one man grumbled.“Are you here to kill him?” said another slave, sounding hopeful. “If so, maybewe will help.”“No, I’m not here to kill him. He is a powerful wizard,” Bannon said indisbelief. “Ildakar will need his gift to fight General Utros.” He frowned atthem. “And we’ll need your help, too. Every fighter, to defend the city.”“We’ve given enough to Ildakar,” said the man on the divan, resting his feet onthe fine fabric. “Now, it’s time the city gave back to us.”Exasperated, Bannon didn’t want to continue the argument. “I’m just here tospeak to Oron’s son, Brock.”The slave on the divan gestured toward the rear of the mansion. “Out back.They’re in the animal buildings. Since many of the slaves refuse to do skinninganymore, Oron has to do it himself.”The slave in the chair chuckled. “It’s about time he got his hands bloody in areal way. He’s making Brock and that other boy Jed pitch in. Beware if you gothere, since he might press you into service, too. Those pelts won’t take careof themselves, and a lot of skinning needs to be done or else the animals willcollapse under their own fur.”“I … I’ll keep that in mind.” He swallowed hard. Sweet Sea Mother!As he headed toward the kitchens in the rear of the mansion, one of the slavescalled, “If you’re hungry, there’s plenty of food in the pantries. Eat it beforesome gifted noble does.”“I’m not hungry,” He hurried through the kitchens, where the ovens were cold andthe cabinets were open, ransacked for food. Spilled flour and half-eaten fruitlay discarded on the floor and the counters. One matronly woman had curled up ina corner, snoring loudly in the company of two empty bottles of bloodwine.Bannon passed through a breezeway outside, following a path of crushed sparklingstone that led to a large low structure with shallowly sloped roofs andpropped-open windows. Sounds wafted out, stirring, rattling, grunting, alongwith bone-chilling wails of animal pain. He paused, having second thoughts; thenhe remembered how Amos and his friends had laughed at him when the Norukaicaptains beat him senseless at the yaxen slaughterhouse. Bruised and broken, hehad barely survived that attack, and then he’d been given over to Adessa so shecould train him to die in the arena. His supposed friends had promised theywould help him. They never did, and he would have died.Pushing open the door, Bannon entered a giant outbuilding crowded with pennedanimals, the source of all the fine furs worn by the gifted nobles. The stenchhit him first, coppery blood, pungent feces, the foul musk of terror exuded bydying animals. Two aisles of cages ran the length of the building, with morecages along the outer walls. Long, flat worktables had shallow gutters that ledto drains in the floor. Eight harried, blood-spattered workers toiled at theskinning tables.Oron was there, his face and his chest flecked with red. He wore a blood-smearedapron over a silken shirt that was now ruined. His long faded-yellow hair wasmatted, tied back and smeared with gore. He barked orders at the workers, whomBannon realized were minor nobles. “If we don’t skin these animals now, the furwill stop growing. Our guild depends on this! If the lazy slaves won’t do theirduty, we nobles have to pick up the slack … as always.” He sounded weary anddisgusted.Oron walked down the line of tables and cages. “Now that I am a duma member, myobligations have increased tenfold. I need to count on other guild members.” Heturned to a queasy-looking young man. “And you too, son. Your life has been fartoo easy. It’s time to get your hands bloody.”Bannon hadn’t at first recognized Brock, because the young man’s face wassmeared with blood, his short, dark hair crusty, his hands covered with red upto his elbows. “I always did what I could,” Brock said in a whining tone.Bannon finally saw what they were actually doing and stumbled backward in shock.The skinners would open one of the cages, reach in, and grasp the ruff of asquealing animal. The unnatural creatures had broad, squat bodies with stubbyheads and stumplike, useless legs that flailed as the workers dragged them out.The animals looked like swollen, living pillows made of fur. Their heads weresmall, like a turtle’s, and the entire body was covered with a rich, thick pelt,some spotted, others streaked with ash gray. These were not normal animals,Bannon realized, but creatures shaped by fleshmancers, made for a terriblepainful purpose.No one noticed Bannon as he stood speechless inside the door. He watched asanother reticent young man—Jed, he realized—grabbed an animal with rusty fur. Hedropped the flailing, squeaking creature on the skinning table in front of him.He had a short, razor-sharp knife.“We’re doing what we can, sir,” Jed said defensively. He pushed the strugglingcreature down and held it by the back of the neck as he jabbed with the point ofthe knife, slicing its shoulder. He cut across its short forelegs and all theway around its body. The creature mewled and screeched in pain. Jed dug with theknife, grabbed the edge of the pelt, and ripped it up. He pulled off a wideswatch of fur and set it aside for scraping while the whimpering creaturetwitched and bled. Though skinned alive, it was not dead, but naked, its pelttorn off.“How long until this grows back?” Jed asked as he tossed the skinned animal backinto the cage.Oron said, “The ones that survive will have a fresh new pelt in three weeks,ready for harvesting again.”The skinners worked one cage at a time, grabbing the animals, stripping them oftheir pelts, and returning them to their cages.Bannon’s stomach clenched with nausea. There were hundreds of trapped animals.“This is horrible. You’re all horrible!” The others looked up, startled by hisarrival. The young man shook his head, trembling. “This whole city is horrible.”Oron barked at him, “Good, we could use more help. There’s a lot of work to doand too many lazy people refusing to do it.”“You’re torturing those poor things,” Bannon groaned. He had always lovedanimals.Oron let out an impatient snort. “Where do you think fur comes from? There’salways a dark underside to what society needs. Do you eat meat? You can’t have ayaxen steak without killing the yaxen. Or maybe you’d rather live naked and eatplants.”Fighting back the urge to vomit, he gathered his courage and strode to where Jedand Brock were working shoulder-to-shoulder, covered in blood. Seeing him, Jedquirked his lips in a sarcastic smile. “We wondered what had happened to you.Did you enjoy playing with Adessa in the training pits?”“I survived. I learned a lot about myself and I learned the truth about you.”Brock grabbed another animal out of a cage, a gray-speckled one this time, andslammed it on the table in the smear of blood left behind from the previouscreature he had skinned. “If you’re our friend, help out with some of the workhere.”“You weren’t my friends,” Bannon said. “You only wanted to laugh at me. But I’mstronger now. I know who you are.”“It wasn’t us,” Jed said. “It was Amos. We just followed him.”“That still makes you participants. You could have told Nicci or Nathan whathappened to me after I was captured, but you wanted me down there in the pits.”His hand drifted toward his sword, though he had no intention of killing them.Still, Jed and Brock flinched as if afraid of what the young man would do. Itwas a strange sensation to see them fear him, but Bannon didn’t back down. “Amosbeat and abused poor Melody, and she killed him. You two were lucky on the nightof the revolt.”“We hid for our own protection,” Brock said. “It was the right thing to do.”Jed somehow managed to sound indignant. “Amos is dead. He was the son of thewizard commander and the sovrena.”“And they’ll be the only two who mourn him,” Bannon retorted. “But the sovrenais locked in a dungeon, and the wizard commander fled the city.” Anger anddisgust welled up within him. It wasn’t the same thing as the blood rage heoften encountered. He felt strong. He needed to say these things aloud.Still working, Brock sliced into the fur animal, peeled up the pelt. Bannonnearly retched.Oron interrupted, looking at his son with scorn rather than pride. “Brock haslived with his pampered delusions for centuries. That’s my own fault as hisfather. He needs to live up to his name as the son of a duma member. He needs towork and make himself worthy.”Insulted, Brock continued his bloody task. The mewling animal lay raw andskinned on the table, twitching but unable to escape. Brock growled, “We foughtfor the city. How many times did we go outside and smash the stone warriors? Noone else in Ildakar did so. If the rest of the people in this city had done asmuch to damage the stone army, we wouldn’t be under siege right now. They wouldall be destroyed already.”“Yes, you were very brave, vandalizing statues,” Bannon said. “You said youwanted to fight against General Utros for what he had done in the past. Well,now you can truly fight. The city is under real siege, and the army is aliveagain. If we have to go to battle for Ildakar, will you be on the front lines?”He lifted his chin in challenge, though he nearly gagged from the stench insidethe outbuilding.Jed and Brock muttered, looking away. “We’ve already done our part.”Oron spoke in a firm tone. “You need to make something of yourself, son. Iworked for centuries to build my power and influence, and now I’m finally amember of the duma. You need to prove yourself worthy, too. Jed’s mother feelsthe same. Lady Olgya said as much to me.” He looked up, hardening his gaze.“I’ll expect you to meet your obligations when the time comes. General Utrosisn’t bound to agree to peace anytime soon.”“We … we won’t need to go to battle,” Brock insisted. “The wizards’ duma willfind a way to end the siege.”Oron opened a cage and brought out a black-furred animal, which squirmed andtwisted in the air. “We’ll try, but if it comes to a real fight, you will needto help save Ildakar, too.” He pressed the creature down on the stained table infront of him. He glanced at Bannon and snapped an order. “You, boy, put on asmock. Take up a knife. We could use your help.”Instead, Bannon walked away. “No. I’ll leave you to the work you were born todo.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 20 [contents.xhtml#c_ch20]As darkness settled again over Ildakar, Nicci pondered the unsatisfying meetingwith General Utros as well as how she might use the sliph whose well Nathan andElsa had discovered in the ruins. One way or another, she was determined to saveIldakar.The ancient army had made no move in two days, but their mere presence wasintimidating. Utros had too much to digest, too much to accept about what hadhappened, but she hoped he would understand the truth of the situation, realizethat his effort was not only unnecessary but pointless. Ildakar had theresources to withstand a siege for years, decades, centuries.Nicci thought it would be most beneficial to wait, for now, but she doubted thelegendary general would abandon the goal of overthrowing Ildakar. His dutyremained as unyielding as stone. Nicci understood his obsession, because shefelt the same way about her own promise to Richard. If some courier had told herthat Lord Rahl was gone, or if she awoke from a spell sleep to find thatcenturies had passed, would she abandon her duty to the D’Haran Empire?Never.She and Nathan had certainly planted questions and doubts in the general’s mind,but he was a man who followed orders, and his loyalty was legendary. He hadconquered the continent on the basis of Iron Fang’s command, but he would not bereckless either. She hoped he would ask for another parley with them, soon.From the high vantage near the ruling tower, Nicci looked out at thenight-shadowed streets of Ildakar after dark, the tense people in their homeswaiting for resolution. At least the pounding on the walls had stopped, but thesilence did not give the city any peace.When they had walked into the middle of the huge enemy camp, Nicci and Nathantrusted in the general’s legendary honor. But what was he planning now? How didhe think he could breach the city’s defenses or fight the many gifted who woulddefend the city?As she watched the blackness and the vault of stars overhead, Nathan emergedfrom the grand villa to join her, dressed in his ruffled shirt, black trousers,and boots instead of his white wizard’s robes. He even carried his ornate sword,as if to remind himself how much he enjoyed being an adventurer as well as awizard. He looked up at the unrecognizable constellations, a vault of night likeanother kind of shroud. “Out to gaze at the stars, Sorceress? They’ve changed,but someday they will become familiar to us.”After the star shift, Nicci had paid little attention to the patterns in thesky. “If General Utros is as honorable a man as your history claims he is, Ihope we can find a way to save Ildakar and also let him save face. We canresolve this, if he wants to.”The sparkle in Nathan’s expression was unsettling to her. “You wear youroptimism as easily as you wear that black dress, and it fits you just as well.Next thing, you may be creating rainbows out of the ruling tower.”He was teasing her, but she was not amused. “I was a Sister of the Dark and Igave myself over to the Keeper, then I served the dream walker Jagang. I broughtenough despair to the world before Richard showed me a different way to succeedthrough cooperation, friendship, and faith. He opened my eyes to the stain ofthe Imperial Order and made me realize how I myself had been spreading thatpoison.” Her voice grew softer. “Richard taught me hope, and that’s a lesson Idon’t ever intend to forget.”She walked along the path that led past other lighted villas toward the immensesacrificial pyramid, Ildakar’s center of power. That structure was where thebloodworking apparatus had been set up, where hundreds of slaves would have beenmassacred to raise the shroud of eternity, but Nicci, Nathan, and other rebelshad defeated Sovrena Thora and ruined the structure.Nicci felt drawn to the place now. If the pyramid was the heart of Ildakar’smagic, she wondered if she could use that magic against the siege.The wizard realized where she was going. “Elsa and I have climbed through therubble already looking for any viable remnants. Alas, we found nothing thatwould be of use to us.”Nicci didn’t slow her pace. “We have to keep searching. You found the well ofthe sliph. Who knows what else Ildakar holds?”“Elsa and I completed our search of the other sealed ruins, but I’m afraid allwe found was a lot more dust.” The wizard frowned. “A barrel of forgotten applesthat must have been there for centuries, tools and bits of iron-hard leather inwhat was once a cobbler’s shop. Nothing, alas, that would make Utros tremble inhis sleep.”Jogging footsteps crunched on the path behind them, and she turned to seeBannon, his long red hair loose, his shirt untucked as he ran with his sword inhand. Grinning, the young man called, “Where are you going? Let me join you, incase it’s dangerous.”Nathan gave him a paternal smile. “We will risk it ourselves, my boy.”Bannon was out of breath but excited. “Today I went to see Jed and Brock.Believe me, I had words with them.” He huffed.Nicci frowned as they reached the largest stone blocks at the base of thepyramid. She had never liked the two young men or their ringleader Amos, knowinghow badly they had treated Bannon, who was desperate for friendship. Since thefirst time she had rescued him from robbers in a Tanimura alley, she had feltresponsible for him. She had held little hope that the eager young man wouldamount to anything or survive this long, but he’d surprised her after all. Sheadmitted that he had proven himself useful in some of their adventures.“I would probably have killed them both for what they did,” she said. “But youhave your own way of fighting your battles.”“Let me come with you now,” Bannon suggested, sounding altogether too excited.“Maybe I’ll offer some ideas. A different perspective.”Nicci kept walking into the wreckage of the pyramid, letting him tag along.“You’ve earned it. You fought well many times, and you helped us free theslaves.”Bannon blushed. “You aren’t often generous with your compliments, Sorceress.Thank you.”“It was a fact,” Nicci said, “not meant as a compliment.”Nathan patted him on the shoulder. “Now we have to save the city from the siege.Any ideas are welcome.”They worked their way up the broken stairsteps, layer upon layer. The apex hadbeen blasted away in the battle, leaving huge chunks of rubble all around.Nathan mused aloud, “I wonder how many people were sacrificed here over thecenturies when Ildakar was trapped beneath the shroud. How much blood did theyspill just to keep the shroud intact?”Nicci spread her fingers and concentrated. “I feel nothing. The magic here isdead.” She closed her eyes and continued searching for any hint of the gift, butshook her head. “Nothing.”Nathan concurred.Then she felt a strange tingle emanating from herself, like a probing unwelcomefinger inside her, a touch that stretched to her spine, then climbed to the backof her neck. Her head began to throb, her scalp crawled.“Wait, there’s something else, something powerful.” Feeling the energy increase,she looked around in growing alarm. Her blond hair crackled with staticelectricity, wafting gently around her. She took a step higher on the pyramidsteps. Overhead, the stars were diamond bright, and the lights of the city shoneout like thousands of eyes.Something wasn’t right.Nathan frowned as he sensed the change in the air, too. “My dear sorceress, areyou certain you’re not summoning it?”“Not intentionally, but it’s coming to me.” Her long hair crackled and thrashedabout as if in a brewing storm. She clutched a handful, wrapping her fingersaround the golden strands. It seemed like something alive.To her astonishment, she watched her hair grow between her fingertips. The blondlocks lengthened like mad weeds. All around her head, the hair writhed out likeliving threads in a voluminous mane. She grabbed at it, but the strands whippedlike probing tentacles. Her hair kept growing, out of control. She clawed at it,tugged, but the hair fought back.Stepping forward with his sword, Bannon cried desperately, “What can we do?”Nicci tugged hard on her own hair as it tried to wrap around her like astrangler’s garrote. The golden strands thrashed at her, already longer than herwaist, some strands down to her knees, wrapping around her like ropes, twistingand clumping together. The hair wound around her arm like thin chains as shereached up to tug at it. Another clump circled her neck, wrapping tight andcutting off her flow of air.Nicci struggled, choking. With one hand, she snatched the dagger at her righthip and hacked at the hair around her neck, severing a long clump, which shethrew to the ground. More hair tightened around her wrist until she thought herbones would break.Diving in to help her, Nathan swung his ornate sword, cutting at the thrashingstrands. “Your hair is quite beautiful, but I’m afraid it has to go.” He hackedhard, lopping off a long hank of strands that continued writhing like worms,even when they were severed from her head.Bannon sliced with his sharpened sword, careful not to hurt her, and then thehair lashed out at him, too.When she shouted, another tentacle of strands dove into her mouth, thrustingdown her throat. Gagging, she bit down with her teeth, grinding until she cut itoff. She slashed with her knife, cutting her other wrist free, but more hairlooped around her waist and lashed her legs together, drawing tight until shecollapsed to the stone step of the pyramid. She sawed with her dagger, hackingoff another hank of hair.Still, it continued to grow like an infestation. Her hair struck out to snareBannon’s sword arm. He yelped and fought back but couldn’t free his wrist. Hetugged against her violent hair, while more locks lashed out to catch his leg,winding around his left boot, and dragging him closer to the main mass. Hecouldn’t even swing his sword. “Help! Sweet Sea Mother.”Nathan chopped more strands of hair, then sliced the locks that had capturedBannon. The young man staggered away, stumbling on the steps.Nicci kept cutting, throwing severed handfuls of hair to the ground. Even so,the cut strands flopped and squirmed in search of more targets. They slitheredforward to wrap around Nathan’s boots.No matter how much they cut, Nicci’s hair kept growing, long past her feet,wrapping around and around her like a cocoon. Already exhausted, she realizedshe couldn’t succeed by hacking more away. She had to find a different answer, asmarter solution. She needed to turn her magic against the attacker, somehow.Though she could barely breathe, her entire body caught in a strangling vise,she called upon her gift, unleashed fire that threw lightning around her skin.The blast singed and curled her hair, burning it away, but it grew back inseconds and wrapped around her again.Nicci could barely move her arms. Concentrating hard, she could feel the powerof the magic attacking her, and the lightning strike left a tracery in her ownaura, like an intrusive vine growing throughout her Han. The magic was centeredon her hair, attacking her hair. She could feel it.There must be some vulnerability, a window through her defenses that she had notdetected. But, no … it wasn’t all her hair, it was just one strand of hair! Yes,that was the focal point, the link that her attacker was using, one hair, out ofcountless strands.The locks wound tighter, crushing her ribs, squeezing her waist, cutting off allcirculation in her legs. She collapsed to the ground, like a fly wrapped up in aspider’s web. She had stopped struggling, stopped cutting, in order toconcentrate. It was her only chance.Dimly, she heard Nathan yelling at her, demanding that she not give up, butNicci would never give up.She sent her thoughts out, tracing her Han just as the Sisters had taught her.At last she found the single connection that tied the evil magic to her like afisherman’s hook and line. That was what connected the spell to her!She had to find it, break it. She followed her thoughts, closed her eyes, payingno attention to the fact that she couldn’t breathe, that her bones creaked,about to crush inward. Fighting to move her trapped fingers, she stirred throughthe wild, combative strands, working upward, trying to reach her scalp. Shefollowed the bright line inside her mind, the key single strand, a broken hair.The other half of that blond strand was somewhere else, in the hands of herenemy, an evil wizard or sorceress.Twin sorceresses!Nicci found the hair, just a short strand that had not grown fantastically likeall the others. This was the strand that bound the spell to her, half stillconnected to her head, the other half in the hands of her enemies. She couldn’tseparate that single hair from the thicker strands all around it, but shetwisted the clump of hair with her fingers and gave a sharp yank, ripping out abloody swatch—which included the single broken strand.Once she pulled that strand out by the root, the spell connection was broken.The evil magic recoiled like a taut rope suddenly cut. Her ravening hair curled,then fell limp. The bindings sagged around her body, giving her a chance toheave a huge breath, filling her lungs. Her ribs ached and several were likelycracked. Her throat was bruised from the strangling locks.Yelling her name, Nathan and Bannon cut at her hair, tearing the severed strandsaway from her face and her mouth, freeing her.She breathed heavily and blinked her blue eyes up at her two companions. “Thankyou.”Bannon clawed the dead ropes of hair from himself, untangled his legs, kickedthe mass away. He looked around warily and tugged his hair back, as if afraidhis own ginger locks might also spring into deadly life. “What caused that,Sorceress? Was it some wild magic still left in the pyramid?”“No.” Nicci turned her cold gaze toward Nathan.The wizard looked exhausted and battered, confused. “Dear spirits, then what—”“You know what it was. General Utros doesn’t want to negotiate. His two petsorceresses attacked me, tried to murder me. There will be no honorablesolution.” She brushed strands from her black dress as she stood in a pile ofcurled, blond hair. “And now, I am angry.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 21 [contents.xhtml#c_ch21]After being attacked by the sorceresses’ twisted spell, Nicci spent thefollowing day with Nathan and the duma members, deep in angry discussions abouthow to respond to the threat of General Utros.Bannon was not part of that debate, and instead he went into the city the nextmorning, accompanied by Lila. Even with an ancient army camped outside thewalls, he knew that Ildakar had more than one enemy, and the city’s populacewould have to fight together. The revolt was over, but not settled, and when theduma called upon them to make extreme sacrifices, the lower classes would notforget their generations of oppression under the gifted nobles. He himself hadbeen held prisoner in the combat pits, and his friend Ian had been transformedfrom an idealistic boy into a killing machine.As he headed down into the lower levels of the city, he didn’t invite Lilaalong, but she accompanied him nevertheless. Her skin was marked with countlessprotective runes, but she had an animal sensuality that was as terrifying as itwas attractive.She fell into place beside him. “Where are we going today, boy?” She sized uphis loose shirt, the sword he carried at his side. “Are we going out to fight?”“My name is Bannon,” he reminded her. “I’m going to the old slave market.” Heglanced over at her, narrowing his hazel eyes. “You’re a morazeth. The formerslaves there won’t look kindly upon you.”Her step didn’t falter. “I’m not expecting hugs or smiles, but you’ve provedthat you need protection. I go with you.”Bannon sniffed and kept walking. “I can take care of myself.”“I can take care of you, too. It’s the best way to be sure. I would consider itmy own failing if I let you get killed by some thug in an alley.”Knowing he couldn’t convince her otherwise, Bannon headed to the open market. Hethought back to the day the three Norukai serpent ships had arrived on theKillraven River, carrying more than a hundred and fifty captives for the slavemarket. Walking meat, the Norukai called them. Bannon had watched the sickeningspectacle as the nobles bid on slaves like silk merchants haggling over bolts ofcloth, and then the sovrena and the wizard commander had preempted the bids tobuy the entire lot for their grand bloodworking.Even though the slaves had freed themselves, they were not in a forgiving mood.They were bottled up inside the walls of Ildakar, forced to defend their cityalongside the nobles who had oppressed them.Bannon and Lila passed under an arched gate into the open square with steppedstone seats on the outer perimeter, where noble bidders had once sat to inspectthe captives for sale. He had expected the slave market to be mostly empty afterthe uprising, but instead the place was a bustling bazaar, with tents andawnings, colorful Ildakaran silk stretched across wooden frames. Intricatetapestries were spread on the flagstones like rugs, likely torn from the wallsof noble villas. Bannon saw chattering families around cook fires, grim-lookingpeople in ragged tunics or drab brown robes, while others flaunted expensivefinery looted from their masters’ dwellings.After Mirrormask’s revolt, many of the freed lower classes abandoned theirformer domiciles and formed a community of their own, scorning the old order andold duties. But everyone needed to work in some capacity to keep the cityfunctioning, to harvest the food they required in order to withstand the siege.Some citizens understood their duty, while others seemed reluctant to help anyof the upper classes they still resented. Several more nobles had beensurreptitiously murdered in the past few days.As Bannon entered the square, hundreds of eyes turned toward him. He felt like atrespasser, but many of the slaves knew him on sight. He had fought at theirside during the uprising, and he had been with them on the top of the plateau,freeing the sacrificial victims.But mixed in with the general hubbub of conversation, he heard a grumbledirected at Lila, though she seemed deaf to it. She walked ahead of Bannon as ifclearing the way for him. She looked around and frowned. “Is this what youwanted to see, boy?” She raised her voice, scolding the former slaves who hadoccupied the slave market. “This is not your home. This is a public square. Youshouldn’t be living here.”“We don’t listen to any morazeth,” grumbled one man, his hand clenching a sturdywooden pole that supported a stolen tapestry. “This is our home now. We nolonger serve the nobles in their villas.”“This is our city, too,” said an older woman who washed clothes in a fountain,and then spread them on the sunlit flagstones to dry.Two laughing boys ran past, chasing each other, but they stopped to stare atLila. When she stared back at them, they fled in terror.“Yes, this is your city,” Lila repeated, “and you have responsibilities, too.You must help defend Ildakar against enemies.”“Against all enemies,” said the man gripping the wooden pole.Bannon came forward, trying to make peace. “We know that your society has tochange. Nicci and Nathan will help when they talk to the duma members.”“We have no one to speak for us,” grumbled the woman as she slopped a wet, soapyrag onto the flagstones.Bannon searched for words. He was just a former cabbage farmer, not apolitician, and he didn’t know how to fix social injustices. More people beganto gather around them like a mob closing in. There were enough potentialopponents here to tear Lila apart, but the morazeth would probably kill half ofthem before they took her down. She stood as still as a stone warrior.Bannon raised a hand, realizing that now he was protecting her. “It’ll taketime. You’ve already made your point. Your grievances are still valid.”Lila seemed oblivious to her danger. A couple of people took flaming brands fromthe cook fires, and another man found a makeshift wooden club. She didn’t flinchas they approached.Bannon’s voice grew more urgent. “Look at how much has changed in such a shorttime. The wizard commander is gone, the sovrena is in a dungeon. You’ve madeprogress. Don’t destroy it by some foolish action. We all have to fight againstGeneral Utros.”“The morazeth bitches should be in dungeons, too,” said a young man with acrippled arm. “Think of what they did to those arena fighters, what they did toyou, Bannon! I was at your side when we freed the victims up at the pyramid.”“How can you stand with her?” sneered the woman washing clothes, shooting aglare at Lila. “Didn’t she beat you? Break you?”“It’s not as simple as that,” Bannon said, his voice uncertain.Lila turned her glare on the people who had made their makeshift settlement inthe slave market. “You live in Ildakar and you’ve seen the thousands of enemysoldiers outside the walls. Our true battle is against General Utros, our commonenemy. Once he is defeated and the city is safe, then we can discuss theniceties of equality and representative rule. But right now we’re at war, and weneed all fighters.”Her tone of voice did not appease them. One man was braiding long leather thongsinto what would become a bullwhip. He spoke up. “Over the last few years, lotsof escaped slaves slipped out the city and made new lives for themselves inStravera and other mountain towns. I stayed, but what if that was a mistake? Thesooner Ildakar falls, maybe the better it is for us.”Someone else said, “We should just leave the city and join General Utros.”Now Lila was incensed. “Then you are truly the enemies of Ildakar and should bekilled here and now.”“Lila!” Bannon cried out, afraid the mob would swarm forward. “Sweet Sea Mother,don’t you see where you are?”“Yes, I am among potential traitors.”Then a young man’s voice broke in, surprising them. “I don’t care what’s beendone to us by some arrogant nobles. Ildakar is still our city. Do we want toearn our new place in it, or not? What would Mirrormask say?”“Mirrormask betrayed us, too,” grunted the man with the bullwhip.Bannon turned to see a ragamuffin figure with unruly hair, a boy no older thanfourteen in a rough-spun tunic and flimsy sandals. Oddly, the boy’s skin, hisface, his hair all had a pale powdery appearance, a hint of gray on his flesh.Bannon suddenly recognized him. “I know you—you’re the yaxen herder, the boycaught working for Mirrormask.”“I planted mirror shards, as a symbol, and then I was caught by the morazeth.”The boy snorted at Lila. “I think she was one of them, but they all look aliketo me.”“As you look alike to us,” Lila said.Bannon remembered the day Adessa and other morazeth had dragged this captiveyoung man into the ruling tower. The boy had confessed his involvement with therebels, and Wizard Commander Maxim had worked the stone spell on him before theboy could confess any details. Since Maxim himself was Mirrormask, Bannonunderstood now why the wizard commander had needed to silence the captive boy.He said, “You do know that Mirrormask was lying to you? Using the unrest of thelower classes for his own purposes, not for your good.”The boy looked downcast. “That doesn’t mean his words weren’t true. We stagedthe revolt for our own reasons, not for his.”Clearly angry, Lila placed her hands on the black wrap around her waist,touching the agile knife that could inflict incredible pain on others. “Ildakaris your city, no matter what. Will you fight for it, or will you shirk yourduties and complain?”Bannon stepped closer to the half-stone yaxen herder. “They placed you as astatue in the slave market to warn others against resisting the nobles.”“And how did that work?” the young boy snorted. “I’m Timothy. Everyone hereknows me.” He gave a stiff grin. “In some ways, becoming a statue was thegreatest thing that ever happened to me.” He turned around, and Bannon realizedthat the freed slaves camped in the broad market did indeed defer to him.Timothy raised his voice to all of them. “I agree with the morazeth in this.Ildakar is our city. We fought too hard to be free, and now that we have much ofwhat we wanted, would you just give it up?”Bannon stood closer to the boy. “We’re all fighting for the same thing, really,and judging by the size of the army out there, we’ll need all the help we canget.”Timothy stared uncertainly at Bannon for a long time. “I’ve heard of you. I knowwhat you did breaking the warriors free, fighting alongside Nicci.” But he shookhis head at Lila. “Since I worked for Mirrormask, I accepted that I’d probablybe caught someday, but that didn’t stop me from spreading messages, helpingrecruit others to fight for the cause.”“And we found you,” Lila said, “and so many others.”“Still, we won,” Timothy said with a shrug. He seemed young, happy-go-lucky, anddetermined, as if he had iron inside of him as well as stone. “I’ll agree tofight for Ildakar, and so will all these people—but only if we have part of thecity once we win.”Remembering the vast army outside, the pounding stone fists that made the thickwalls echo and tremble, Bannon wasn’t sure anything would remain unless theywon, and soon.“We need an army,” Lila said in a haughty voice, “not muttering slaves who hideunder tents in the city square.”Timothy crossed his arms over his hardened chest. “I’ll fight, but only if I canbe part of a real army. It’s better than herding yaxen.”Lila stepped very close to him, intimidating, but the boy didn’t back down.“You’re just a scrawny wisp of a child. What would you do for our army? Tripsome of Utros’s soldiers?”He gazed right back at her, mirroring her defiance. “I’ll fight.”“You could never be a real fighter. How could you inflict any damage?” In alightning strike, Lila backhanded him hard across his chest.Surprisingly, her knuckles cracked against his tough skin. The blow would haveknocked anyone else backward, but Timothy remained sturdy, as if anchored to theflagstones.Shocked, the morazeth looked at her stinging hand. Her knuckles were bloody.Timothy chuckled and offhandedly struck her in return. Lila wasn’t expecting theblow, and she staggered from the impact. She blinked in amazement, then turnedto the street scamp with greater respect. “Maybe we can make fighters out of youafter all.”“Teach me how to fight, and I’ll show you what I can do,” said Timothy.The freed slaves in their camp looked up from cook fires, while others emergedfrom silken tents.Lila gave a small smile, glancing at Bannon. “I could train him into an adequatefighter. Let me teach you, Timothy. I’ll take you under my wing.”“Teach all of us how to fight,” the young man said, “or it’s no bargain at all.”The morazeth considered, while the freed slaves muttered. They respected Timothyfor the ordeal he had gone through, and now he was forcing them to put theirunrest, their dissatisfaction, and their complaints into real action.Bannon felt strangely relieved. “We’ll be happy to have you as part of Ildakar’sdefenses. We need every fighter right now.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 22 [contents.xhtml#c_ch22]The high windows in the ruling chamber were open to let the breezes and citynoises waft in, along with the renewed drumbeat of fists pounding against thewall. Nicci sat by herself, her blond hair ragged and uneven, roughly shornafter the spell attack.Quentin looked down at a long strip of paper spread out on his table, where hehad written lists. He raised his voice to get the attention of the duma members.“What is our next order of business?”Damon sat beside Quentin, peering down at ledgers as if searching for somenumber in a long-forgotten accounting. Oron sat in another seat wearing afur-lined cape and a fur-collared shirt. He used a stubby knife to scrapebeneath his fingernails, removing the residue of blood. Beside him on the stonebench perched a short-statured woman, Olgya, who ran the silk spinners’ guild,another new duma member. Her round eyes were highlighted with crow’s-feet. Herlong, straight brown hair was shot with lines of pale gray, as if infused withstrands of raw silk and gathered in clumps tied with bright silk ribbons. Shewas also Jed’s mother.The meeting had droned on with very little progress, and Nicci was growingimpatient. High Captain Stuart presented a long list of new defenders who hadbeen recruited from the arena fighters, along with hundreds of volunteer militiamembers, citizens of Ildakar willing to fight. “With such a large population, wewill have a formidable army if we choose to attack the general’s forces,” hesaid. “Given the right circumstances, our numbers might even match theirs.”“A full-fledged military offensive on our part could certainly cause a greatdeal of damage,” Damon said. “And think of Ildakar’s gifted! Utros has only twosorceresses, while we have many powerful wizards.”“Who would lead such a strike?” Oron asked.Glancing at the unoccupied thrones of the wizard commander and sovrena, Oronspoke up. “Sooner or later we have to choose new leaders. We dare not let theseduma meetings become tedious arguments, as they were for centuries. We are undersiege—we need more than a committee!”Nicci rose to her feet and self-consciously ran her hand through her raggedhair. “Before choosing leaders, we must finish—no, you must finish—filling thevacancies in the duma, and your ruling council cannot be composed only ofIldakaran nobles, as it was before.” She nodded a signal to High Captain Stuart,who ran into the hall to fetch the person waiting outside the ruling chamber.“We already invited you and the wizard Nathan to formally join us,” said thestony sorceress Lani. “You two are the best candidates, and we need your gift tohelp us fight. Why not agree to become members of the council?”“We will not join your duma,” Nicci insisted. “We are not part of your city. Youhave to make your own decisions—fair decisions, for all the people.” Shesoftened her voice, showing a small amount of conciliation. “But we will help.”Damon sighed. “Then whom do you suggest? We have other gifted people in Ildakar,but nobody who has our standing.”“Did you learn nothing from the recent uprising?” Nicci snapped. “Freedom and astable society must be built from all sides. You require a duma representing thecitizens of Ildakar—all people. Your city is home to more than just wizards,more than nobles, and you can’t restrict the duma to nobles. You needrepresentatives from the merchants, the lower classes, even the slaves.”They all turned as Rendell entered, a reliable and determined older man who hadhelped nurse Nicci back to health after her battle with Thora. All the formerfollowers of Mirrormask respected him. “Welcome, Rendell. I would like everyonehere to consider you as the next member of the duma. Every group in the citymust have a voice.”Elsa looked puzzled, while the expression on Lani’s stony face was unreadable,but Quentin, Damon, and Olgya frowned. Oron snorted. “He’s a slave! We’re tryingto save Ildakar.”“There are other ways to save the city,” Nicci said, “and Ildakar will be betterable to save itself if you give all your people the same goal. If Rendell has aseat on the council, he can speak on behalf of the lower classes. As you saw onthe night of the revolt, they can be ruthless fighters. Imagine what they coulddo against enemy soldiers.”Quentin blew a loud breath out through his nostrils. “A slave does not belong inthe duma. Haven’t those animals already killed enough nobles? I heard anotherone was beheaded yesterday. How can you think of rewarding them?”Rendell stepped forward, indignant and speaking loudly for himself. “I’m not aslave. I am free now, and I am a citizen. I represent many thousands of peoplewho could just as easily become your worst nightmare.”“He threatens another revolt!” Olgya cried. “While the city is under siege!”“Several nobles have been murdered by the rabble in recent days,” Oron said.“How can we trust someone like him?”Rendell looked deeply saddened. “I’ll speak with them, demand that they stoptheir unrest for now. I can redirect their anger, if you will listen to ourgrievances and let us be a part of this city in a meaningful way.”Quentin scowled. “Why would we need them?”Nicci spun to face the dark-skinned wizard. “Are you all deaf? He offered you alarge fighting force, and all you have to do is treat them fairly. Did you notjust suggest launching an attack on the siege army?”“We can’t turn down their help,” Elsa said. “For many centuries we’ve asked theslaves to maintain Ildakar. This city is their home, too. Give those people avoice, and they may fight passionately to protect Ildakar. We should let Rendellbe a provisional member of the new duma, just to control the unrest.”“If General Utros breaks down the walls and tears apart the city, we’ll all bedead,” Oron said with a continued scowl. “I’d rather Rendell’s people diedfighting enemy soldiers instead of murdering us in our beds.” He shrugged.“Throw the slaves this little bone so we no longer need to worry about them.”An insulted expression crossed Rendell’s face, but before he could speak, Niccistepped out onto the blue marble floor. “That is a start, but not good enough.The duma must also include merchants, tradesmen. All of Ildakar needs to feelthey are heard. If you do this, then after the siege is broken you will have asolid foundation for your city. You may even make Ildakar into the perfectsociety that Sovrena Thora imagined she was creating.”“I still think it’s risky,” Quentin grumbled.“And foolish,” Damon added.“It’s not foolish.” Lani rose from the stone bench near Nathan and Elsa. “Manythings will have to change now that Sovrena Thora has been overthrown.” Sheturned to face the former slave. “I, too, welcome Rendell to the duma.”“I cast my vote in favor,” Nathan added, “if my vote counts.”“Good enough,” said Oron.Olgya fiddled with one of her braids, then tossed it over her shoulder. “Isuppose it doesn’t make much difference. Now can we move on to more importantbusiness?”Outvoted, Damon and Quentin sat down and shrugged. “It’s done for now,” Quentinsaid, “and I hope we haven’t made a mistake.”“The duma has made mistakes before,” Lani pointed out. “That’s why we’re introuble now. If Thora hadn’t sent my dear Renn away on a fool’s mission, we’dhave another strong wizard in the fight against Utros.” Her long sigh soundedhollow through her partially petrified lips. “I hope he’s all right out there.…”Nicci spoke again, addressing the duma. “This isn’t just an administrativemeeting, but a war council. We have to make decisions. What are we going to do,now that the general’s sorceresses have attacked here?” She swept her blue gazeacross the members, touched her ragged hair. “How will you respond?”“What options do we have?” Damon asked.Elsa leaned forward, placed her elbows on the stone table. “All options? Well,we can annihilate Utros and his army … which doesn’t seem likely. Or we candrive them away, scatter them to other lands.”“Even if we could break the siege and drive them away, it would only turn themloose on the rest of the Old World,” Nicci said. “And my responsibility isgreater than just this one city.”Elsa raised a third finger. “I’m just listing all options, however unpalatablethey may be. Another possibility is that Ildakar can simply surrender, open itsgates and let the city be overrun.”Amid the shocked whispers around the tables, Lani said, “I’d rather not makethat choice.”Elsa smiled. “So, I think our best option is the fourth one.” She glanced atNathan. “We find some way to negotiate a peace. That is the general’s bestoption, too. What is he still fighting for? What purpose does this siege serve?He no longer even has an emperor.”Nicci said, “He does not seem to be in a mind-set for negotiating. Hissorceresses attacked me.”“If we prove our strength, then he’ll listen,” said Oron. “I say we make afocused attack, target one section of his army, and give him a black eye. Showhim what we can do and threaten much worse if he isn’t reasonable.” He sniffed.“We are not to be trifled with.”“Those are all the choices I can think of,” Elsa said.The duma members talked among themselves, considering, but Quentin interjected,“You are forgetting one other option.” He glanced at Damon, who nodded.Obviously they had discussed this before.The dark-haired wizard stroked his drooping mustaches and said, “We know how towork the blood magic. It’s been done before. We could rebuild the apparatus,make the spell-forms, and find enough volunteers for sacrifice.” He paused tolet everyone realize what he was saying. “If we raised the shroud of eternityagain and took Ildakar out of time, we would all be safe and protected forever.”He smiled. “We’d never need to worry about General Utros again.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When the duma meeting broke for an uncomfortable recess, Nicci went to the topof the high ruling tower, where she had a view of the huge army on the expansiveplain. She watched the enemy ranks drilling, like game pieces on a vast board.When Emperor Jagang had practiced his strategy, the big tyrant found ways toamuse himself and to hone his skills. As the Imperial Order consolidated the OldWorld and moved north to conquer D’Hara, he would play his game of har’kur,forcing Nicci to serve as his opponent, as Death’s Mistress. Back then, thoughhe abused her, she had tried to please him, believing in the cause of the Order.In a large clearing in camp, Jagang’s soldiers would scribe lines in the turfwith their spears, and then assemble the playing pieces—slaves who representedthe parts of various armies. As Nicci and Emperor Jagang sat together on awooden observation tower, they would command the game pieces to move across thefield. The slaves had no choice but to go where they were told. If Nicci lost amove, Jagang’s soldiers would stride forward with their halberds and hack offthe head of the losing piece.Once, one of Jagang’s game pieces, doomed after Nicci made a bold move, hadtried to run from the playing field, only to be skewered with spears. By therules laid down by Jagang himself, the fleeing piece meant that his sideforfeited the game. In a rage, Jagang had ordered all of Nicci’s piecesslaughtered as well as his own. The evil dream walker had not known how to lose.Afterward, he looked at the slaughtered slaves and huffed. “Let that be alesson. In war sometimes unpredictable disasters happen.”Now, as Nicci watched the ancient army, she wished one of those unpredictabledisasters would befall General Utros.Nathan emerged into the tower’s rooftop gardens. Under the open sky, there werehedges in planters, jasmine shrubs, and dwarf citrus trees. Songbirds flittedaround without fear now that the hair-fine nets Sovrena Thora had strung aroundthe roof were gone.Nathan smiled. “I don’t mean to disturb your thoughts, Sorceress. Have you founda brilliant solution to overthrow the enemy army?”“I am still thinking.” It was in these peaceful high gardens that WizardCommander Maxim had secretly encouraged her to challenge the sovrena’s corruptrule. “The duma has to make their own decisions. I am not their leader, andneither are you.”Nathan stroked his chin. “Agreed, but I am not convinced a surprise militaryoffensive against an army of that size will be as effective as the wizards thinkit will be.” He mused, “We could send another negotiating party to Utros. Do wehave any reason to believe the general might be willing to listen, now that he’shad time to consider the reality of his situation? Maybe his bluster was just atactic. We did defeat his sorceresses and prove our strength.”“And now we know we cannot trust him.” Nicci breathed cold air through hernostrils and peered into the distance. “He attacked me, Nathan. I can’t let thatgo unchallenged. I want to find a way to make him hurt, and if the duma intendsto launch a strike with all of their gifted and a great many soldiers, maybe wecould succeed, if we targeted a specific part of his army and hit him withoutany forewarning.”Humming, the wizard extended his arms in front of his chest, palms outward.Spreading his fingers, he sketched a rectangle in the air, pinched hisfingertips, and used his gift to create a distance-viewing lens. The army ofGeneral Utros sprang into sharp clarity in front of them, and as Nathan shiftedhis hands, so did the view, to show thousands of soldiers like individual armiesdrilling. Smaller parties rode out into the hills on scouting or raidingexpeditions.Nicci raised a hand. “Go back. What was that?”They watched a group of more than a thousand soldiers marching westward into thehills, a powerful invading force toward the mountains. Another large armymarched north into the thick forests and the mining areas in the hills, while athird expeditionary force moved south toward the Killraven River and thelowlands.Nathan frowned. “He is shrinking his siege force.”Nicci was deeply concerned. “Very few cities could withstand even one of thosesplinter armies. Imagine all those enemy soldiers arriving at Cliffwall, orRenda Bay, or one of the larger cities along the coast like Larrikan Shores orSerrimundi. General Utros could threaten the entire Old World.” She squeezed herfists, feeling the chill in her heart, the black ice forming there. She couldn’tstop thinking of what Richard had commanded her and Nathan to do. “We can’t letthat happen. We have to work with the wizards here, keep Utros occupied.”Nathan waved his hands, and the shimmering view dissolved. He spoke in a softervoice. “I have the utmost confidence in your ability to save us. After all, youmust save the entire world. It was foretold in my life book.”“I don’t trust the word of a witch woman, and prophecy is gone. You know thatbetter than anyone. Why should we believe it?”Rather than arguing, Nathan brought out the book, as if to offer proof of whatRed had written. He opened the leather-bound volume and flipped forward fromwhere he had added journal entries of their adventures, from the Dark Lands tothe Old World, down beyond the Phantom Coast and now over the mountains toIldakar. He stopped at the first page to read the lines that both he and Nicciknew well.> Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard will> behold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must save> the world.Shortly after Richard dispatched them as his roving ambassadors, they hadencountered Red in her wilderness of skulls, deep in the Dark Lands. Nathanasked her to create a life book for him, wanting his own story preserved, andthe strange witch woman had complied, but not in the way he expected.Nathan held out the book now, touching it with his long finger. “We can’tdismiss the words entirely, Sorceress. Even though we didn’t know what thismeant at the time, Red was absolutely correct. I have the heart of a wizard now,I have my gift back, but you, my dear Nicci, still need to save the world.” Hetapped the page. “It’s written.”Nicci took the book from him, closed it. “Prophecy is gone, as I said.”“It need not be a prophecy,” Nathan replied, taking the book back. “Maybe it’sjust good advice. ‘And the Sorceress must save the world.’”They continued to watch separate contingents marching from the plain towardunknown destinations. Nicci didn’t disagree with the words Red had written,whether or not she believed the premonition. “I’ll save the world, for my ownreasons.”“That is always best. And I’ll help you in any way I can.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 23 [contents.xhtml#c_ch23]In the Cliffwall archive, Verna spent the morning inside a library chamber,drinking hot tea and studying the books that the scholars had delivered to her.Two other Sisters of the Light, Rhoda and Eldine, scrutinized volumes,whispering as they compared notes. Novice Amber cheerfully carried in a stack ofledgers, blowing dust off the embossed leather cover of the top volume.“Here’s another catalog, Prelate.” She deposited the armful on the table,rattling Verna’s cup of tea. “These refer mainly to maps and descriptions. Thescholar archivist is still trying to pull the right listings because many bookscontain more than one subject.”Verna looked at the open volume in front of her and traced her fingertip downthe lines of titles. Many were written in the expansive hand ofScholar-Archivist Simon, who had spent a decade compiling the catalogs, but thenew entries were written by Franklin, whose penmanship was much tighter, moreefficient.The prelate looked up at Amber. “The titles listed here contain legends ofmagical creatures, abominations that were developed as weapons in the ancientwizard wars. The sliphs, for instance.” Verna shook her head at the long list.“And here, two entire volumes on the dangers of succubi! Those creatures wereturned loose in the Old World to seduce and destroy men and thereby weakenarmies that stood against the enemy wizards.” She pursed her lips in a frown. “Iexpect it’s quite salacious reading.”Amber blushed, and Verna wondered how experienced the pretty young girl might bein romance or sex. Turning the page in the dusty old book, Verna recalled beingso youthful, but that was more than a century and a half ago, when she andWarren were the same age, trying to keep a professional boundary around theirgrowing affection for each other. When Verna left the Palace of the Prophets insearch of Richard Rahl, she had aged during those decades, while Warren remainedas young as ever. Dear Warren … she missed him so much.She flipped a page back, looked at more listings. “Here, they have three booksabout the selka, one of them a log from an ancient warship captain.”Amber leaned close. “The selka?”“Humans transformed into water-breathing creatures that dwell in the oceans.They could battle an enemy navy from beneath the hulls.”The young girl gave a visible shudder. “We are far from the ocean, here,Prelate. I don’t think I’d like to see them.” She frowned with worry. “I hope mybrother’s all right. He’s still at Renda Bay. Do you think the selka mightattack the village?”“Captain Norcross is building defenses for a much more likely enemy, child,”Verna said. “Lose sleep over Norukai raiders rather than the selka.” Sherealized her words offered the girl little reassurance.The young scholars Oliver and Peretta entered the study room. Although they hadlived all their lives in the Cliffwall canyons, these two had volunteered atNicci’s request to embark on a long journey to deliver a report for Lord Rahl.They had found Verna and General Zimmer in Tanimura and led them back here. Thetwo shy, diligent scholars were glad to be back home in their sanctuary, butthat journey had changed them. Verna could see a restless glint in their eyes,an appreciation of the adventure they’d experienced. The prelate supposed itwouldn’t be long before the two wanted to explore the world again.“We brought books on healing lore,” said Peretta. She was a thin, large-eyedgirl with a mop of dark curly hair. “I’ve memorized them all, but I thought youmight like to have a look.”“Healing spells are always appreciated,” Verna said, “and always useful.”“It’s just a list of the books, not the actual spells,” Oliver corrected,squinting at the volumes he carried. Though he was young, he had spent so manyyears poring over illegible writing, faded ink, and crumbling pages that hisvision was already waning. “A complete catalog is the first part ofunderstanding the knowledge available to us.” He let out a tired sigh. “We’reworking as hard as we can, but Franklin estimates we still have a decade or morebefore we even complete our list of the titles in Cliffwall.”“The Sisters will help however we can,” Verna said, accepting the books fromeach of them. “When I first set foot in here, I looked forward to studying theamazing knowledge.” She paused, then smiled. “Now it seems we may spend yearsreading mere lists of books and none of the content.”Oliver said, “Knowledge is one thing, Prelate, but knowing what you know is anoverlooked skill.”“I know what I know,” Peretta said with a sniff. “All memmers do.” She flushedin embarrassment. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to sound arrogant. My gift ofremembering is a virtue, but you all have skills as well.” She flashed a quickapologetic glance at her friend. “Oliver is very smart.”He responded with a shy laugh. “To me, these books are a great adventure ofdiscovery. Once you learn something, it’s even more important to share yourknowledge.” He looked warmly at her. The two of them had spent so much timetogether in the wilderness that they’d formed a close bond, maybe even aromantic one.“Unless we know what we know, we’ll never be able to find what we need.” Vernareached into the pocket of her robe and withdrew a small glazed figurine of atoad. It was just a memento, a cute decoration that she had found when searchingthe ruins of the Palace of the Prophets. The toad figurine had no significance,as far as she could tell, although she thought it might have belonged to SisterArmina back in the palace. Now the toad was just a reminder of better days.Verna liked to have it there, silently watching their busy work.Amber picked it up, and smiled at the figurine with delight before placing itback on the study table. “I remember when we found this.”Renn bustled in, looking fresh now that he had rested comfortably for severaldays. He was dressed in clean gray scholar’s robes instead of his maroon silkgarments, which badly needed mending after his long journey.He strolled up to the study tables piled with books. “I must admit, Prelate, Iam impressed with this archive. I’ve always loved books and the knowledge theycontain. For centuries I devoted myself to reading the libraries in Ildakar,then reading them again so I could understand the nuances. Beneath the shroud ofeternity I had plenty of time! But all these books in Cliffwall”—he clucked histongue against his teeth—“it is like a river of knowledge. How could I possiblyhave time to read them all?”Verna realized that good meals and a polite welcome had softened the blustery,arrogant wizard. “Now that you’ve seen the vast number of books here, Renn, Ihope you no longer consider packing them on a mule and carrying them back toIldakar.”Renn scoffed. “By the Keeper’s beard, that was never a realistic goal. My cityis so far away, I don’t relish making that journey again. I don’t see the point!The cooks and bakers you have here in Cliffwall are quite talented. I don’tthink I’ll ever get tired of that mutton and currant pie they made last night.”He patted his rounded stomach.Verna raised her eyebrows. “So, Captain Trevor and his nine men are not plottingto overthrow the archive, conquer General Zimmer and his D’Haran soldiers, andsteal all the tomes?”Renn blew air through his lips. “Oh, I think that would be far too much trouble,however much Sovrena Thora might like to get her hands on these records.” Hesank heavily onto the bench beside Verna, looking curiously at the odd toadfigurine. He picked up one of the books and scanned the titles about legendarysuccubi. “Hmm, interesting. I don’t think we’ve ever had a succubus in Ildakar.”He read for a few moments, then glanced up at Verna, more serious now. “Ildakaris truly a beautiful city, Prelate, as glorious as the legends would have youbelieve, but Cliffwall is a fine place, too. I admire what the people have done,and I’ve never seen anything like those memmers.”Standing beside the table, young Peretta smiled proudly. “There has never beenanything like the memmers.”Distractedly, Renn picked up another volume. “Rather than hauling so manyfragile and ancient books on a rigorous cross-country journey, it would make farmore sense if I just brought a few scholars and memmers back to Ildakar with me,so they could at least convey the extent of the knowledge here.”Brightening, Oliver glanced at Peretta. “That could be arranged. And I’d like togo along.”“I would definitely like to see Ildakar,” Peretta added.Surprised at their eager reaction to his offhand suggestion, Renn raised a pudgyhand. “Oh, I’m not suggesting that yet! I will need much more time to recoverfrom our arduous trek.” He looked away. “And I’d want to be careful, since I amnot entirely certain what Sovrena Thora might intend with this powerfulknowledge. I’m a duma member, and therefore loyal to Ildakar, but the sovrenadid many objectionable things. She turned my beloved Lani to stone.” He pausedfor a moment. “And all her bloodworkings, how she treated the ungifted, herscorn for those weaker than her. I was ashamed of what Thora did.”Verna closed the volume in front of her and sipped her tea, which had growncold. “Good thing Nicci and Nathan are there to keep her under control. I don’tbelieve either of them would suffer a tyrant.”Renn chuckled at the thought. “Yes, I’ve seen the lovely Nicci, the flash ofanger in her eyes, so blue! The wizards of Ildakar did grow complacent over amillennium and a half, but Nicci challenged their daily assumptions. I don’texpect Thora likes it.” He sighed. “Ah, I wish Nicci had been there when Lanibattled the sovrena centuries ago. If they worked together, those two couldcertainly have overthrown Thora.”Amber looked confused. “And you want to give the sovrena all the magic in thisarchive? Why would you do that?”“Now, now, it was what she ordered me to do, but maybe it’s high time I stoplistening to everything Thora says.” He sniffed, looked at the toad figurineagain, and slid it aside. “Ildakar was a beautiful city. Lani and I had a goodlife together. You should have seen her call the songbirds. They would flockaround her, chirping, singing.” He sighed. “But eventually, when Thora executeda slave for stealing some jewels she knew her own son Amos had taken, Lanicouldn’t tolerate the injustice. She challenged the sovrena.”His eyes filled with tears and he turned away. “Lani was powerful and dear, butcompassionate, while Thora was ruthless. She defeated my poor Lani, petrifiedher, and then kept her statue in the ruling chamber for all to see the price ofdefiance.” He wiped a hand across his eyes and distracted himself by openinganother book, squinting down at the words. “What is this? An entire list ofcures for flatulence? Is that vital magical lore?”Verna said, “If one suffers from the affliction, the cure would seem veryimportant indeed.”“And the person’s family and neighbors would appreciate it as well,” Rhodacommented from the adjacent table, eliciting chuckles among the scholars.Renn returned to his ponderings, ignoring the studies of intestinal maladies.“The sovrena always doubted me because I cared so much for Lani. Yes, I was theweakest gifted duma member, and she always held a threat over me. I knew she’dpetrify me too if I didn’t support her cruel rulings. I should not have agreed,but I didn’t have any choice.” He tapped his fingers on the table. “I nowsuppose she sent me on this wild and pointless quest just to get rid of me. Shenever expected me to find Cliffwall, maybe never believed it even existed. Shegave me only a dozen escort soldiers to fight all the dangers we might encounteron a long and arduous journey across unknown lands.” He shook his head. “Isuppose Captain Trevor and I could find our way back to Ildakar, but why wouldwe want to?”“I would like to know what Nicci and Nathan are doing,” Verna suggested.“You have a point, but let’s wait a little while longer, shall we? I’d like afew more nights in a dry bed with a warm blanket.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------General Zimmer and his fifty men camped in dozens of neat tents erected in thepastures alongside the stream. The Cliffwall farmers tended fields of grain,families weeded their vegetable gardens, shepherds watched their flocks nearorchards of nut and fruit trees. Though far from home, the D’Haran soldiers wererelaxed, feeling safe after their long journey from Tanimura.Despite the protection of the high rock walls, the narrow canyon entrance, andthe isolation of the plateau, Zimmer didn’t let himself relax. He had exploredup and down the main canyon, studied the tributaries of streams and side canyonsthrough the high desert. He insisted that his fifty D’Haran soldiers keep theirswords sharpened, their armor clean, their eyes alert. He did not intend to becaught unawares.General Zimmer was young to hold such a high rank, but harsh experiences hadaged him well beyond his years. He’d been promoted only because so many superiorofficers had been slain in the brutal battles against the ravenous undead armiesthat surged across the Dark Lands, driven by the resurrected Emperor Sulachan.Zimmer had faced death himself, been splashed with the blood of countlessenemies, and he had also led vicious commando strikes down in the Old Worldagainst the army of the Imperial Order. He recalled his previous commanders, hisbrave mentors who had fallen under the gnashing teeth of a horrific enemy no oneshould have had to face.Now, in the bucolic setting of the Cliffwall canyon, birds chirped in theorchards, and the sun shone in a blue sky. It was easy to be lulled intoforgetting the true dangers of the world, but Zimmer never let down his guard.Trevor, the captain of the Ildakaran escort, stepped up to him, still wearinghis chest armor, short sword, and high boots. “My men are rested, General—andrestless. Although this is a peaceful place, as we hoped, I don’t want my guardsto get fat. They were unprepared for the journey from Ildakar. That’s why I lostthree of my men.” He cleared his throat, ashamed. “I’d like to keep the othernine men sharp. Would you allow them to train with your troops? Spar with them?Maybe we could learn from your men, and vice versa.”Zimmer looked skeptically at him. “It seems to me, Captain Trevor, that only aweek ago, your handful of men were intent on conquering Cliffwall.”The other commander looked away, embarrassed. Trevor appeared much younger nowthat the mud and dust of travel had been washed away, the stubble shaved fromhis cheeks. “There’s not much chance of that, General, as you know full well.”He lowered his voice in a conspiratorial tone. “Renn is a wizard of Ildakar, andthey tend to begin a conversation with bluster, but that’s all it is.”Zimmer remained wary. “And by training with your men, you want us to teach youour D’Haran fighting techniques? What if you turn them against us?”Trevor shrugged. “I could say the same. My men would also teach you our methodsof fighting. Surely there’s something we could learn from one another?” Hefrowned as a thought occurred to him. “Are my nine men prisoners? Are we beingheld here?”Instead of answering immediately, Zimmer considered his words. “If you leftCliffwall, I suppose I could let you aimlessly wander the wilderness again.” Heraised his eyebrows. “If that’s what you’d really like?”Trevor coughed and fidgeted. “No, I don’t think that would be necessary. I’drather make friends than enemies. Ildakar has faced enough enemies in the past.”Zimmer kept his voice stern. “Then maybe your wizards should learn aboutdiplomacy. It would be remarkably beneficial for both sides.” He looked at theyoung captain’s face, saw true earnestness there. The other nine Ildakaranguards were relieved to have been welcomed in Cliffwall. He relented and said,“I, too, would rather have Ildakar as an ally than as an enemy. Even I haveheard legends of the city, and I’d like to see it someday. Lord Rahl wants toconsolidate the Old World.” He clapped a hand on Trevor’s shoulder. “Your citycan have its independence, so long as you don’t become aggressive invaders.”“That doesn’t seem too much to ask for a strong empire and a life of peace,”said Trevor.Zimmer walked alongside the captain as they went to the line of D’Haransoldiers. “In that case, let’s include your men in today’s drills. Show us yourtechniques, and we’ll forge a bond that will make us all stronger.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 24 [contents.xhtml#c_ch24]Captain Norcross was pleased with how rapidly the defenses of Renda Bay wereimproving. The people in the seaside town were fishermen, boatbuilders, weavers,farmers, and tradesmen, and they had been preyed upon by the Norukai for far toolong.Thanks to the fortifications the D’Haran soldiers were installing, Renda Bay wasnow less vulnerable, but the village was not a garrison. These people wouldfight to defend their homes, but they were not a hardened army. They bore plentyof scars, however, and after Nicci and Nathan had fought with them to drive offthe hideous slavers during the last raid, the town’s heart had changed. Thepeople decided to stop letting themselves be victims. Renda Bay had increasedlookouts, sent out coastal patrols, rebuilt their town, and added defenses.Then the D’Haran expeditionary force arrived, and Norcross had stricter ordersfrom General Zimmer. The young captain and his soldiers stayed behind while theothers went to Cliffwall. They swore to protect the fishing village againstthreats, but Norcross knew that even fifty brave soldiers wouldn’t be enough tofight against the violent Norukai.He stood at the harbor’s edge in midmorning, after the day’s mist had burned offand the fishing boats had gone out for their catch. The seasonal redfin run wasnearly over, and the people were busy salting and smoking their catch for thecold months. The flocks of sheep and goats that grazed in the hills were growingfat for the winter slaughter, while others provided wool, milk, and cheese.The people of Renda Bay worked day and night with Norcross’s men, buildingtowers and defensive walls so the town would be ready whenever the raidersreturned. From his training, Norcross understood siege defenses, battle tactics,offensive weapons. Though he was not an engineer himself, three of his officersknew how to construct catapults and spiked archery towers, along with somesurprises that could be used against raiders from the sea.The young captain would not let his people rest until the town was safe. Eventhough the morning was peaceful and sunny, with a salty chill in the air, everyperson in Renda Bay knew that any day, rain or shine, could bring an attack fromthe ominous serpent ships.Thaddeus, the town leader since his predecessor had been slain in the lastNorukai raid, joined Captain Norcross to inspect the construction of the newtowers that rose high above the harbor, one on each side of the river mouth.Built out of stone blocks brought from quarries down the coast, the massiveguard towers weren’t pretty, but they were nearly finished, with woodenplatforms behind defensive crenellations, so that the guardians of Renda Baycould fire upon invading ships that attempted to enter the harbor. Three largecargo ships remained just outside the bay, like large guard dogs.“How soon will we be ready?” Thaddeus asked, wiping his brow. “I’ll lose sleepevery night until our defenses are finished.”“We will be ready the moment we have to be,” Norcross said. “We’re ready now,and we will fight back if we are attacked. Each day’s efforts simply make usmore prepared.”Thaddeus nodded slowly. He was a broad-faced man with a reddish-brown beard andfacial worry lines that hadn’t been there a month ago. “We can’t stop until theNorukai learn to leave us alone.”The young captain continued to reassure him. “My men belong to the D’Haran army,and that means something, but if it comes to a battle, we’ll need everyone fromRenda Bay to do their part, from a teenage farm boy swinging a rake to agrandmother striking with a cast-iron pan. Don’t underestimate anyone fightingfor their home and for freedom.”Thaddeus turned to look across the mouth of the river to a nearby hillside, andhis expression grew sad. “If we had learned how to fight earlier, there wouldn’tbe so many wooden markers in our graveyard.”On the day after General Zimmer, Prelate Verna, and the other half of theexpeditionary force departed for Cliffwall, young Norcross had accompanied thetown leader to Renda Bay’s cemetery. Permanent stone markers memorialized thefallen over the years, but an even greater number of wooden posts, each carvedwith a name, signified a loved one who was not dead but captured by the Norukaislavers, clubbed senseless and dragged aboard the serpent ships.Norcross had said, “Your cemetery should be a place for old, contentedgrandparents who died fat in their beds, surrounded by family. Not this.”Thaddeus let out a wistful sigh. “Yes, that would be best.”Amid the construction noises of bricklayers and carpenters in the lookouttowers, blacksmiths continued their work, producing loud clangs as theyfashioned sword blades, spearheads, and metal spikes. Norcross perked up as heheard a different sort of clang in the distance. He shaded his eyes to lookbeyond the shore wall and out toward the open sea. One of the stonemasons on topof the southern tower began waving, shouting down to those below. “There’s aboat coming back. Seems to be in a hurry.”Norcross and Thaddeus hurried up the tower steps to the top platform. Eventhough the construction wasn’t yet finished, the defenders had stocked thetowers with baskets of pitch-tipped arrows, piles of large round stones, rows ofunstrung bows. On each side of the river, a large siege engine stood in place,giant catapults made with beams from whole tree trunks, strung with thick ropes,fastened with heavy iron springs. Baskets at the end of the throwing arms couldhold boulders covered in pitch and set aflame.From the tower platform, Norcross spotted a lone fishing boat tacking back andforth at full sail as it raced into Renda Bay. A distant tinny sound rangthrough the air, the fisherman aboard the boat banging on a metal pot to soundan alarm.Norcross frowned, wishing the boat could sail more swiftly. “Alert thetownspeople. We should get ready. There’s something not right about this.”Thaddeus gave the orders, and runners raced down the tower steps and sent out acall through the streets of Renda Bay. The D’Haran soldiers pulled back from thework sites and gathered their armor and weapons, pulling on thick leather shirtsand donning swords. More townspeople came running in from the hills and outlyinghomes.Though the fishing boat raced toward the harbor as swiftly as the errant windscould bring it, Thaddeus identified the broad-beamed and sturdy fishing vessellong before it came to shore. “That’s the Daisy. Kenneth looks like he’s runningfrom a storm.”Norcross kept staring. “There’s no storm. It’s something else.”Kenneth sailed swiftly toward the harbor. The bearded, shaggy-haired fishermanstood at the Daisy’s bow, trying to raise an alarm with his banging. Norcrossremembered when Kenneth had intercepted the three sailing ships that carriedGeneral Zimmer’s expeditionary force down from Serrimundi.The D’Haran ships were commandeered merchant vessels that had sailed throughuncharted waters along the coastline, guided by Oliver and Peretta, the twoyoung scholars from Cliffwall. The ships were led by Captains Mills, Straker,and Donell. At the moment, the three D’Haran vessels were anchored just outsidethe mouth of Renda Bay, too large for the shallow harbor to accommodate. Rightnow, with their sails furled, the ships were manned only by a skeleton crew whopreferred to sleep on deck rather than in shared rooms in town. The threecaptains insisted on remaining aboard, unless they were called to importantduties on shore.By the time the Daisy reached the mouth of the harbor, with Kenneth shouting atthe top of his lungs, Norcross had spotted the terrifying forms coming over thehorizon, sleek attack ships with midnight-blue sails.Beside him, Thaddeus swallowed audibly. “Those are serpent ships. The Norukai.”Captain Norcross watched the sails appear, one serpent ship after another, sixin all.Thaddeus said in a low, shaken voice, “That’s twice as many as the last raid,and even with the help of the sorceress Nicci, we barely drove them away. Howcan we fight six serpent ships?”“We’ll show you how,” Norcross said, his voice hard as iron. “We made plans dayafter day. We prepared the people, trained them. Your defenses are strongernow.”“But, we’re not ready,” Thaddeus said.“You are ready. Dear spirits, you have no other choice.”Thaddeus turned and ran down the stairs of the lookout tower.Norcross shouted for his D’Haran soldiers to gather in front of the piers andprepare to defend the town. He had only fifty soldiers. “Each one of you willhave to be a commander,” he called out. “Take some villagers under your wing.You know that we have surprises for the Norukai this time. Let’s drive them awayand convince them never to attack Renda Bay again.”His men cheered, understanding the dire threat they faced. They didn’t doubt hisconfidence.For his own part, Norcross felt very young and inexperienced. He was barelytwenty-five years old and wasn’t ready for such a responsibility. He’d foughtonly twice in great battles. Now, he had a mere handful of men, each of themjust as inexperienced and probably just as frightened as he was, and a largepopulation of villagers who had been bruised and terrified many times before.But none of them had another option. They had to be ready.Norcross remembered that General Zimmer had also been young, promoted far beyondhis ability or expectation, but Zimmer had shouldered his responsibility andbecome a genuinely inspiring leader. Now, Norcross understood that concept morethan he’d ever wanted to. He wouldn’t let his general down, or Lord Rahl.The Daisy docked in the first open slip on the pier. Kenneth threw down thehawser to one of the stanchions, quickly tied off the boat, and leaped onto thedock. His footfalls thundered as he ran to meet the soldiers. “Did you see them?Six serpent ships! They’re close behind me.”“This town is ready to face them,” Norcross said. “We’re pulling together ourdefenses. Thanks to you, Kenneth. Your warning gave us an extra hour toprepare.”Town leader Thaddeus stood beside Norcross, trying to match the D’Harancaptain’s confidence. “Renda Bay will not be a victim again, not under my watch.The Norukai might expect us to be plump little lambs, but we know how to fightnow.”Soldiers rushed to prepare the siege engines. Workers filled carts with rocksand barrels of oil, then ran down the streets of Renda Bay and out onto thepiers. More rowboats pulled out to the three anchored sailing ships led byCaptains Mills, Straker, and Donell, which were now preparing for war. Villagedefenders stormed up to the high towers on either side of the river mouth.Loud bells rang throughout Renda Bay in case anyone had remained unaware of theimpending attack. Norcross stared out past the end of the piers, watching theominous ships approach.“We’re ready for you,” he muttered under his breath. “Come and learn yourlesson.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The nautical magic invoked from the serpent god pushed against the midnightsails, stretching the fabric and driving the Norukai vessels toward Renda Bay.The lookout on Kor’s ship had spotted the fishing vessel and snarled achallenge. Kor had shifted course to race after the fishing boat in hot pursuit,but somehow the man from Renda Bay either had magic of his own, the specialfavor of the Sea Mother, or just unexpected skills. His boat caught the rightbreezes, tacked from north to south, covering distance across the waves evenfaster than the raiding ships could. As the fishing boat dwindled toward theshore, the serpent ships could see Renda Bay not far ahead.His first mate, a burly man with tattoos on his arms and neck, gripped therailing. “He will warn them, Kor. We shouldn’t have let him escape.”“I didn’t let him escape,” Kor retorted. “Perhaps you’d like to swim after him,chase the sea serpents, then wreck the boat before he can deliver his warning?”The first mate backed away. “No, Captain.” On normal voyages, such a challengewas an insult. Kor could have punched him, broken his jaw, and thrown the manoverboard, but right now he needed every fighter. He would let the man die inthe raid if he was meant to die.In the two serpent ships immediately behind him, Lars and Yorik sent up signalflags, preparing for the wild raid. There was no military strategy. The raidingvessels would simply crash into Renda Bay, and the Norukai would attack withlanding boats. Some would wade to shore, run along the piers, and set fire toany intact structures. They would kill or capture every person they could.Anyone too worthless to be a slave would be slain outright.This was a raid to acquire more walking meat to be sold elsewhere down thecoast, but it was also meant to send a message. Kor had his orders from KingGrieve. Renda Bay was to be left a lifeless ruin, with black smoke rising highinto the sky for all other coastal towns to see.Kor leaned forward at the prow, admiring the carved serpent head enhanced withiron spikes for ramming ships. Kor had seen the real serpent god himself, threetimes, and knew that no carving could match the majesty or the terror of theimmense creature, but Kor and his fighters would inspire their own terror. RendaBay didn’t need to fear the serpent god. They needed to fear the Norukai.On the shore, villagers scurried about like terrified ants. Kor’s lips twitchedin an imitation of a smile on his slashed cheeks. Salt spray crashed from theprow of the raiding ship. He narrowed his eyes as he looked at the helplesstown. He felt hungry."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 25 [contents.xhtml#c_ch25]After sunset the following day, General Utros surveyed his vast camp and hiscountless soldiers. The warriors lit campfires, not because they needed thewarmth or to cook meals that they wouldn’t eat, but because it was part of theirroutine, as it had been since ancient times. Such a colossal army neededcampfires as a symbol of camaraderie. In addition to the other effects of thepetrification spell, Utros had noticed that his night vision and that of hissoldiers was severely diminished, just like the sensitivity of his skin. Hecould see the fires blazing bright and defiant, but the shadows seemed to bedeeper than before.Over the days since awakening, as the news spread about how much time had passedand that Iron Fang’s empire had fallen long ago, a ripple of despair wentthrough the countless soldiers. Utros spent the day walking among the troops,telling them that even though everything they knew was gone, they were still hisarmy. “As my soldiers, you are always with your true family, and I will leadyou.”He wore his helmet with the horns of the monstrous bull, looking powerful, buthe could feel the shock of his men, their sadness. He understood theirdisbelief, but he could do nothing to help them. He, too, had lost everything.Majel …Utros spoke to the squads, stepping up to just a few sullen, dutiful warriors,but others gathered closer to hear.“I can’t bring them back, not any of them,” he said. “Time has stolen ourfamilies, our friends, our loves and our lives from us.” He paused. “No, nottime—the wizards of Ildakar stole them from us. They placed this spell on us.”He clenched his partially hardened arm. “They are to blame.”Utros saw the grief and loss in their expressive eyes, the inability to shedtears the way they normally had. The reality sank in, and these soldiers, somany thousands of them, had only their duty and their loyalty—to him. “I can’tbring you the past. I can’t bring any of them back. But I can bring you hope andduty. Our reality is now centered on capturing Ildakar, as we swore to do whenwe left Orogang so many centuries ago.” He drew a deep breath, felt his lungsexpand. “And that is what we will accomplish.”At first the dutiful cheers were halfhearted, but slowly the soldiers pulledthemselves up with the new realization and their new purpose. Later that night,under a common banner, soldiers gathered around the big fires and told storiesabout their families, now long lost to the ravages of time. His troops wouldreminisce about their loves, their children, the homes they would never seeagain. But they would complete their mission. For him. Utros knew it.His warriors came to accept their fate. What choice did they have? They hadalways followed Utros, and he had never let them down. So long as he convincedthem of his vision, they would continue to serve him. But even he didn’t have acomplete plan.First Commander Enoch reported after sending scouts along the wall of the city,then up into the hills and along the cliff that plunged down to the river. Hedid not seem optimistic. “It is possible, by traveling far from these plains, tofind a way down to the river, but it widens into swamps, which seem impassable.If we did send troops along the water to the base of the bluffs below Ildakar,we would still have to scale the cliffs to get into the city.” Enoch frowned.“It does not seem a good strategy, General. The Ildakarans have defenses there,too, and we have no boats, no means to attack from the water. I think our siegeat the walls may be the best option. Ildakar can’t withstand us forever.”Utros listened, absorbing the information. “I’ll continue to work on a plan,First Commander. Bring me any other intelligence you gather. There must be away.” Enoch gave a formal bow, then departed.Despite his reassurances, Utros had only a limited amount of time to find hisclarity of purpose, because the army’s questions would become too loud for anyanswers he might offer. His orders from Emperor Kurgan were fifteen centuriesold, and the mercurial ruler himself had been overthrown by his own peoplebecause of his cruelty.Long ago, Utros had taken a vow of loyalty to Iron Fang, yet there was alsoMajel, and his love for her had been as strong as a boulder diverting afast-flowing stream. Somehow, in the compartments of his mind, Utros managed toseparate those conflicting loyalties. He held them like the opposite poles oftwo lodestones, both attracting and repelling, and it was only through rigiddetermination that he could hold both in his mind at the same time.As he studied the campfires dotting the valley, he felt a chill rather thanwarmth. Kurgan was gone—and Majel was gone. Iron Fang could no longer advise himor give him new orders, and he couldn’t hear the beautiful voice of his beloved.Both were in the underworld now, their spirits with the Keeper. Utros couldnever speak with either of them again.In ancient times, there had been rumors of a fraying of the veil, occasionalways for spirits to return to the world of the living, if only briefly, butRichard Rahl’s star shift had sealed the breach forever, if Nicci and Nathancould be believed. Never again would spirits be able to pass from theunderworld.His leader and his lover were both lost to him forever, and Utros was on hisown. Even surrounded by hundreds of thousands of loyal soldiers, and thesorceresses who served him with their bodies and their magic, Utros feltentirely alone.…From the doorway, he turned to the inside of the headquarters, where the twobraziers glowed red. Ava and Ruva stood waiting for him in gauzy gowns thatclung to their curves. Freshly shaved and painted, the twins watched him insilence, letting him have his thoughts, but they seemed to read his mind.“We remember the magic we have been taught, beloved Utros,” said Ava.“All the stolen books we studied in the cities we conquered,” Ruva said.Utros closed the wooden doorway behind him. “I have never doubted it.” He couldsmell the dizzying smoke from the braziers. “But if what the representatives ofIldakar claim is true, the underpinnings of magic have changed. Your mostpowerful spells may not work anymore.”Ava held up a finger, studied it, then stroked her sister’s cheek. “Or at leastnot in the same way.”Ruva closed her eyes and let out a sigh of pleasure from the touch. “That alsomeans we may have different opportunities. Magic might function in ways we neverconsidered before.”Utros ran his palm over his scarred cheek. “Maybe you can find a spell that willturn Ildakar’s stone walls to dust, and then we can simply march through thecity streets.”“An interesting possibility.” Ruva reached across to stroke her sister’s face ina reciprocal gesture. “But that’s not what you want most, beloved Utros.” Thetwins stared intently at him.Ava said, “We know what you want, and it will strengthen your heart.”“Strengthening your heart will strengthen your army,” Ruva added.Utros frowned. “What do you mean?”“You know exactly what happened to your dear Majel, the woman to whom you gaveyour heart and your soul,” Ava said, “while your mind and your skills were swornto Emperor Kurgan. Absolute loyalty and absolute love, tugging against eachother.”Ruva nodded. “Before you can accept your place in this time, you need to speakto Iron Fang. And to Majel.”The general’s heart ached. “That is true, but they’re long dead. The only way Ican speak to them is if I go to the underworld, and I am not ready to die yet.”“Maybe there’s another way,” the twins said in eerie unison.Ruva took a half step closer, and the ruddy light from the braziers painted itsown patterns on her skin. “We’ve studied what the sorceress Nicci said. We castwebs, made probes with our magic. We sacrificed small creatures, and that bloodallowed us to tease out answers.”Ava said, “The underworld is indeed sealed, and there’s no way we can exploit abreach or a weak point. You cannot travel beyond the veil, nor can we bring backthe spirit of Majel or Iron Fang.”Ruva and Ava crept closer until they were nearly touching him, but they stopped,letting him sense their presence. “It might be possible that you can stillobserve through the veil, however. You can look in on the underworld and findthose spirits.”Utros blinked. “You mean just to communicate, not to bring them back? I hadn’tconsidered the idea. That would be excellent.”“My sister and I have discovered a way to make a window, a lens to let you lookthrough the veil. You could see the spirits of Majel and Kurgan. You could talkwith them.”“I could speak with her,” Utros said, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. “Icould say…” He drew a breath and straightened, restoring his professionaldemeanor. “I could brief Emperor Kurgan and receive further orders from him,learn what he really wants me to do, so many centuries after I laid siege toIldakar.” Utros felt his heart grow lighter for the first time since awakening.“Yes, do it. That is my command.”“There are complex preparations to make,” said Ava. “In order to create such alens, we need a special kind of glass.”Ruva added, “And that will require special ingredients, difficult ingredients.”“Whatever you need, I’ll see that you have it,” Utros said.The sorceresses had no doubt. “The molten glass needs to be mixed with the bloodof innocent children. Those pure sacrifices will delight the Keeper, and thenwith our magic we’ll be able to see through the veil.”Utros spoke quickly. “I’ll instruct First Commander Enoch to find innocentchildren and take their blood. Of the many scouting parties I sent into thehills, surely they’ve located some villages that can be harvested.”Ava and Ruva pressed themselves against him, wrapping their arms around hissolid body. He felt their curves, the solidity of their skin and bodies, theirfirm breasts. “Let’s sleep now and share our power,” they said.Utros felt a clarity and an optimism that had been long gone. Ava and Ruvapeeled off their garments and then removed the general’s armored vest, hissword, his dagger, his greaves, his belt. While her sister completed the work ofundressing Utros, Ruva added more pungent herbs to the braziers, filling thechamber with thin, aromatic smoke.Together, they all lay naked and entwined on the low, makeshift bed. It was notto share bodily warmth, for their toughened flesh had little of that, and it wasnot to share passion, though Utros knew the twin sorceresses held a fire of lovefor him in their hearts. This was to share strength, as they had done many timesduring his conquests across the Old World.Utros held the beautiful twins, stroked their smooth cold skin, following thecurves of their backs, their buttocks, while their fingertips traced imaginaryspell designs across his chest and down his legs. As he lay there, all he couldthink about was the chance to see and speak with Majel again, even from beyondthe wall of death."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 26 [contents.xhtml#c_ch26]The stair-stepped spectator benches of Ildakar’s combat arena rose on all sidesof Nicci as she walked out onto the raked sands along with Nathan, Elsa, and allthe powerful gifted members of the duma. The council had at last made adecision, and they planned to go on the offensive.The seats were filled with thousands of people, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder.Nicci saw a blur of faces, lower classes in drab clothes in the bottom tiers,merchants in the better seats, nobles in the prominent observation towers safestfrom the violence and bloodshed. Though the huge arena was filled to capacity,Nicci knew this was only a fraction of Ildakar’s population. Yes, the city didindeed have the potential to create a formidable army.Though she had her doubts about the duma’s plan, Nicci would help them achievevictory. She just needed them to define their goal properly. Nathan was alsocommitted.The duma members walked forward, leaving footprints on the same ground wherecountless warriors and combat animals had died. The loud background murmur fellto a hush as the ruling council stood to address the large audience. EvenRendell, the newest official duma member, stood among them. The lower classes,the workers, and the freed slaves would see him there and understand thatsomething had fundamentally changed in the city’s power structure. If theysucceeded, the duma would convince the people of Ildakar to direct theirviolence outward, against the army of General Utros.Nicci spotted Bannon in the lower tiers, giving his silent encouragement. Theyoung man wore a common shirt and had tied his hair back. Lila sat beside him,as if she were his personal guard, reminding Nicci of how the Mord-Sith alwaysstationed themselves close to Richard.Quentin, Damon, and Elsa stood silent beside the reawakened Lani, and the newgifted duma members Oron and Olgya. Nicci and Nathan remained with the council,and although many Ildakarans looked to the two of them as outside heroes, Nicciinsisted on letting the city’s own representatives speak. Without the wizardcommander or the sovrena, though, the duma had no clear spokesperson.After building the crowd’s anticipation, Elsa finally stepped forward. Sheenhanced her voice so that all could hear. “People of Ildakar, all citizens ofIldakar, we face the enemy you have feared for fifteen centuries. That ancientarmy is now awake again and outside your walls.”Oron spoke up. “And we are like yaxen in a pen awaiting the slaughter, unless wedo something.” He stepped forward, made his voice even louder. “I for one do notintend to wait for that. We must prove our might, show that we can be aformidable foe and push back against the enemy. Ildakar has many powerfulgifted, and our magic is stronger than anything General Utros can command.”“We also have countless fighters,” Lani said. “Look at all of you! We call onanyone who can take up arms, train for battle, and help us deal a resoundingblow to our ancient enemy.” She looked around the tiers at the pale faces, thebright Ildakaran silks, the earthy garments of workers and former slaves. “Wehave our city guard, our morazeth, our arena warriors. Together, we have anarmy, the army of Ildakar.”The people began to mutter and cheer, and Nicci saw Bannon applauding. She felther own resolve hardening. She had traveled too far and fought too hard in thename of Lord Rahl. She could not let an enemy from the dusts of time win againstan equally legendary city. Rather, she wanted Ildakar to become one of thecapitals of the new D’Haran Empire. But in order for that to happen, Nicci hadto save them first.She thought of the blood that had been spilled on these arena sands, unwillingwarriors cut to pieces by opponents or torn by combat beasts. There was much todislike about this twisted city, but there was also much worth salvaging. Ifthese people could be convinced to follow the sensible rules of Lord Rahl,Ildakar would be a powerful ally.She made up her mind and raised her voice. The enthused crowd fell silent,wanting to hear what Nicci had to say. “The enemy believes we’re cowering behindour walls, just waiting. They think we have no way to fight them. They think ourmagic is weak because the stone spell faded.” She waited a beat. “We’ll showthem that is not true.”Nicci knew how to rally these diverse people, the many factions that dislikedone another, the angry rebels who still held their grudges. “We must havewarriors, but we know you aren’t all soldiers. Ildakar also needs materialsupport, whatever the city can give. Swordsmiths must create weapons, blades,spears. Fletchers must make many arrows. We need armor and shields.” She swepther gaze across the former slaves in their tiers, the tradesmen, the merchants,even the gifted nobles in the high levels. “The recent uprising nearly toreIldakar apart, but this is a chance for you to heal those wounds. I urge you tofight for your city instead of against one another.”Oron gave her a respectful nod and added, “Our best hope is in a surpriseattack. Let us train our fighters, gather our gifted. When we are ready, we’llmass our army just behind the walls where the enemy can’t see us, then we willattack late at night, a strike as swift and deadly as a lightning bolt, and thenreturn to safety behind our walls.” He extended a hand, pointing to thespectators in the stands. “We have to do a great deal of damage in order to makeour point.”Nicci focused on the sea of faces in the tiered seats. The buzz of conversationgrew louder in the arena, accompanied by the percussive beat of clapping handsand stomping feet."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 27 [contents.xhtml#c_ch27]The six Norukai vessels arrowed toward the harbor, their rows of oars like thelegs of a centipede on the water.Running along the docks, Captain Norcross shouted orders. He had spent manynights alone at a candlelit desk drawing up scenarios, imagining defensesagainst the hideous raiders. He had consulted with his fellow D’Haran soldiers,and together they had come up with many ideas, some of them ingenious, someimpractical. Norcross had decided to implement everything he could. He didn’thave magic, but he did have tactics.Now he raced to the end of the southern pier, watching his three large cargoships move into position, ready to close like pincers around the oncomingNorukai. On the largest ship, helmed by Captain Mills, Norcross could see armedsailors crowding the rail on the starboard side. Bright pinpoints of lightsparkled as a dozen archers lit pitch-covered arrows and loosed a volley thatrained down on the first oncoming raider.The Norukai scurried to extinguish the fire on the deck, but several arrowsstruck the dark sail, which went up in flames. Three of the raiders were killedby the burning arrows, and their crewmates quickly dumped them over the side.The other five serpent ships pressed forward like hungry predators. Loud, bassdrumbeats echoed from the raiding vessels, and Norukai warriors crowded thesides, eager to fight with swords, spears, and battle-axes. They chanted aninhuman-sounding howl.Out on the water, bright wooden buoys marked positions. The Norukai paid them noheed, but the D’Haran engineers had practiced, setting their aim and theirrange, and the buoys marked the specific strike points. When the serpent shipsapproached the line, Norcross fought back a smile. “Catapults!” he shouted, andother soldiers picked up the order. “Catapults!” They knew exactly how and whento fire the giant boulders resting in the cradles.Soldiers turned the heavy cranks on the siege machines, winding the cables andratcheting the gears. Ropes groaned and long wooden beams creaked as they cockedback the catapult’s arm. Muscular fishermen loaded a boulder into the cradle,doused it with pitch, then ignited the missile. When a Norukai serpent shippassed the first marker buoy, Captain Norcross gave a signal, and the catapultloosed its stone. With a liberating snap and crash, the arm heaved upward andlaunched its burden. The giant flaming stone tumbled like a comet through theair.Aboard the serpent ship, the Norukai shouted in sudden terror as the burningboulder smashed the hull. The people of Renda Bay cheered, seeing the tremendousdamage. The crippled enemy ship veered to the south as the raiders struggled toregain control and put out the fires.Meanwhile, the first vessel that had been peppered by flaming arrows alsoburned. The sail was nearly consumed, and now the fire spread to the decks andclimbed the masts.As raiders approached the watchtowers at the mouth of the harbor, the Norukairesponded with their own fire arrows like a rain of shooting stars. Somedefenders raised shields to cover their heads, but others had no such armor.Dozens of people fell, skewered as they fled for shelter.Norcross felt isolated at the end of the pier with arrows pattering around him,thunking into the wooden boards.The four intact serpent ships pressed in, relentless. The first raiding vesselground up against the base of one of the lookout towers at the mouth of theharbor. Its carved figurehead smashed the head of the piers. Norukai boiled offthe decks, some leaping into the water, others dropping onto the piers andsurging forward.Seeing them for the first time, Norcross was appalled. The raiders were ashideous as he had been led to believe, their mouths slashed and tattooed to looklike serpent jaws, their bodies studded with spikes and horns implanted in theirskin. They were monsters as terrifying as Emperor Sulachan’s undead armies,which Norcross had seen only once.Another serpent ship crashed against the opposite pier and disgorged its army ofinvaders.At the top of the twin watchtowers, the defenders shot arrows and hurled rocksdown upon the raiders. From their high vantage, they should be able to massacrethese invaders. Even so, Norcross felt sick as he drew his sword and ran tofight hand-to-hand. The scarred slavers didn’t seem to care how many they wouldlose.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Usually during raids, Kor’s warriors were like wolves chasing fat and stupidsheep, but now he saw that Renda Bay would be more of a challenge. The peoplewere putting up a real fight and they had built unexpected defenses.Kor let out a rumbling hiss deep in his throat. The villagers would still lose,but it would be a test for his raiders, and the Norukai liked to be tested.Harsh challenges made them stronger, just as their bleak windswept islands madethem hungrier for conquest. Renda Bay’s resistance would only bring aboutgreater retribution, and that was fine with Kor.A flaming boulder from the second catapult hurtled through the air after thecrack-smash of its released arm. The giant stone whistled overhead, and theNorukai crew on the target ship—Yorik’s vessel—used their oars in a furious butfutile attempt to shift course. The projectile clipped the top of the mast,shattered the yardarm, and made the sail collapse.Kor’s ship cruised into the small harbor, passing one of the new stonewatchtowers. His vessel ground up against the nearest pier, and his fightersthrew ropes to lash the vessel into place. Norukai warriors leaped from thedecks and ran wildly down the docks with weapons raised.Within minutes, they encountered a force of trained soldiers that stood againstthem—real soldiers, not simpering villagers, with armor and good swords. Korresolved to claim those swords, even if he had to pry them from the bloody handsof fallen warriors.Howling raiders slammed into the soldiers in a spray of blood and a crash ofsteel. These outside soldiers, strangers to Renda Bay, were well trained and noteasily frightened. With some surprise, Kor watched several of his own warriorsfall, cut down by the combat skills of their unexpected opponents. Dead Norukaibodies were roughly kicked into the water to get them out of the way.For his own weapon, Kor preferred a long-handled axe with a rounded stone clubon the opposite end. He swung it one-handed as he bounded onto the pier,striking viciously, left and right. He hit the first soldier who faced him,smashing his axe brutally against the steel sword. The soldier’s wrist snapped,and the man reeled away as he gaped at the strange angle of his arm, theprotruding bone. Kor swung the weapon again, bashing him in the face with therounded end. For good measure, he turned the weapon around and sank the axeblade with a wet, meaty impact into the defender’s chest. With his boot, Korstomped on the fallen man’s ribs to yank his weapon free.Screams of pain, howls of anger, and the clash of weapons made a deafeningclamor all around him. To Kor it sounded like music.From the watchtowers above, defenders hurled rocks and sharp javelins whilearchers fired a rain of arrows. Kor saw seven of his fellows drop in an instant,arrows protruding like spikes from their bodies, and he spun just in time sothat an arrow merely struck his shoulder instead of his heart. When he reachedback and ripped it free, the barbed arrowhead tore a wide gash in his flesh, butKor didn’t feel pain. He was in a battle mind-set now.The first wave of Norukai stormed down the length of the pier and into the town.Many of the homes, freshly rebuilt after the last fiery raid, were burningagain, ignited by fire arrows. The defenders formed a cordon to stop the raidersfrom entering the town. They held swords, spears, even rakes and shovels, andtheir expressions were grim, determined. This was no scattered, panicked flockof cowards. The people of Renda Bay had been trained, and this surprised him.But they would all still die.The Norukai smashed into the defenders, wielding their axes and spears. Thetownspeople tried to stand their ground, but they fell like harvested grain. Andyet the rest of them kept fighting.One of the officers on the opposite side of the water, a captain of some sort,shouted orders as the fifth and sixth serpent ships pushed into the mouth of theharbor, their impatient crews eager to attack. But on either side of the bay,the villagers worked huge cranks and chains, raising some unexpected weaponsubmerged beneath the water. Kor swung his sword instinctively to deflect theblow of a bearded fisherman who attacked him with a boat hook, but he waspreoccupied with what was happening in the water. He punched the fisherman inthe face, kicked him off the dock, and turned his attention back to watch.A deadly rake of sharp metal shafts, spears lined up on a rotating hinge thathad been sunk beneath the shallow harbor, began to turn, rising to the surface.Kor had never seen such a thing before. The long, deadly spikes lifted out ofthe water, angled directly toward the oncoming serpent ship.Kor saw what was going to happen, but could do nothing about it. “No!” heroared. “Change course!”The serpent ship pushed forward at full speed, driven by the coordinated sweepof the oars. On deck, several Norukai screamed a warning, and the men at theoars flailed, disorganized, but they couldn’t react quickly enough. Momentumdrove the vessel ahead, and the hull rammed itself upon the parallel spikes.Even from where he stood, Kor heard grinding and splintering as the metal pointsgutted the serpent ship like a fish. Nearly a hundred Norukai warriors leapedoverboard, and several of them were impaled on the spikes as well. The ship wasdestroyed, its keel shattered, and within minutes its hold flooded, although thesharp spikes held the wreck up like a slaughtered goat hung on a meat hook.Other raiders charged down the docks into the town, while longboats scraped upon the stony shore. Even before they landed, the Norukai men and women tossedtorches onto docked fishing boats. Abandoning their vessels and splashingashore, the burly raiders raced up the shingle to keep attacking.Kor led his own party, killing townspeople and armored soldiers as he swept hisbattle-axe from side to side. He pushed deeper into the streets.Hundreds more villagers emerged from their hiding places, bursting out ofbuildings where they had lain in wait. In moments, the defenders doubled innumber, making the invaders’ charge falter.Astonished, Kor howled in wordless rage. This was supposed to be a slave raid, apunitive attack to avenge the previous failure of weaker Norukai. His missionwas to leave no one alive, no structure standing, but now three of his shipswere already destroyed, two of them still in flames. The people of Renda Baywere not fleeing in terror. Instead, they surrounded the raiders and blocked offtheir escape.He saw one of his best fighters, his own first mate, jabbing and stabbing withhis spear. He killed three Renda Bay villagers, but six more closed in on him.They caught the first mate’s spear with a boat hook, drove it to the ground, andbroke the shaft. The first mate fought back with both fists, his scarred jawflapping open and closed as he snarled, as if he meant to snatch them with histeeth.The Renda Bay townspeople knocked him to his knees, then stabbed and clubbed himto death. In that moment, as he watched the man fall, Kor began to feel fear.For the first time in his life, he sensed that he was going to lose.Outside the harbor, Yorik’s ship was listing to the side, trying to limp away asits hull filled with water after being damaged by the catapult missile. Fivelanding boats full of scarred raiders ready to die fighting had already launchedfrom the sinking ship.The three large sailing ships outside the harbor, vessels of a type he had notseen before, closed in with inexorable momentum. Fully under sail, thethree-masted ships came after the Norukai landing boats, and from their highdecks, the sailors shot countless arrows and killed all the warriors who hadbeen trying to escape. The nearest cargo ship scraped against the damagedserpent vessel, their hulls colliding. The sailors aboard leaped over the rail,swarming the deck of the damaged Norukai ship.Kor spun about to look at the larger disaster, not just the bodies of those hehad killed lying around him. Twenty more Renda Bay defenders charged down thestreet toward him. They didn’t look terrified at all. Rather, their eyes showeda bloodlust that Kor had previously seen only on the Norukai.Backing away, looking for a defensible position, he glanced to the other side ofthe harbor, saw the professional soldiers forming a blockade, marching forwardwith their swords and spears to trap twenty Norukai who had no place to run. Theraiders fought viciously, but failed, and their bodies dropped into the water.Sweeping his eyes across the battlefield, Kor made a quick count. He had lostthree of his six serpent ships, and two-thirds of his warriors were likely dead.It was simply not possible! If other towns learned to stand up like this, theNorukai could face defeat after defeat.This was something entirely unexpected. Kor could not accept the idea that theNorukai were being defeated by a fishing village!He saw Lars and Yorik, still alive, struggling to pull their crews together onthe three remaining ships, and Kor knew he had to withdraw with what remainingfighters he had, with the ships that could still sail. King Grieve needed toknow what had happened here. In a hoarse voice, he bellowed the signal that allNorukai dreaded to hear, a signal that had rarely been used in many centuries.A retreat.Kor shouted for any Norukai fighters who could break away to rush back to theirships. He would lead them from Renda Bay and back out into open water so theycould limp back to the main Norukai islands.His raiders were burned and bruised, and the fire in their hearts had beensnuffed out. It might be better if he just stayed and died here, because once hereported his failure to the king, Kor would surely be sacrificed to the serpentgod. But he couldn’t think of that. He had to save his warriors so they couldreturn and fight again with greater frenzy. For vengeance.King Grieve had to know of this terrible and disturbing new threat, even if itcost Kor his life.He decapitated a burly villager who swung a sharpened spade at him. Kor didn’teven watch his victim fall as he sprinted back, hoping he could survive longenough to reach his own ship."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 28 [contents.xhtml#c_ch28]Behind the walls of Ildakar, Nicci worked day and night to rally the city’sdefenders, to arm them and train them for the surprise strike, now that the dumahad set their plans in motion. Since the insidious attack from his twinsorceresses, the city had received no word from General Utros, no ultimatums, norequests. Nicci was sure the ancient general was building some strategy of hisown, but she hoped Ildakar would strike first, taking him unawares.Even while she slept, Nicci gathered information through Mrra, roaming in herdreams with the spell-bonded sand panther. She glided through the shadows andstudied the enemy troops. When she felt bold enough, the big cat even prowledamong the troops, nothing more than a tawny blur. Mrra didn’t understand thehuman details of what she saw, but through her eyes Nicci could assess theircamp, their numbers, supplies, and weapons, and she could see where theirweaknesses were.Using feline senses, she could tell that these ancient warriors were notentirely human. They didn’t smell right, and their warm blood and flesh wascooler than a normal person’s.The following morning, Nicci delivered a report to the duma of what she and Mrrahad seen. Nathan wasn’t there, claiming that he wanted to investigate anotheridea.In the meeting, Lady Olgya said, “My guild has crafted enough special silk tomake protective cloaks for twenty gifted nobles, who will lead the charge in afew nights. Our worms are spinning themselves into exhaustion. The fleshmancersadapted and strengthened them, but they cannot go faster.”Nicci knew the preparations couldn’t simply continue forever. “General Utros issure to move soon, and we have to strike first, or we will lose our element ofsurprise.”“Preparations continue throughout the city, and this will be a significantoffensive,” said Damon. “Our fighters are gathering, training. Arms are beingdistributed. It will take at least three more days before we can hope to beready to move.”“I’ve ordered guards posted at every gate, even the low shepherds’ doors,”Quentin said. “And they’ve been reinforced with spells. The walls are secure.”Oron frowned. “I’m more concerned about our former slaves who were willing tomurder innocent nobles and burn down the city. Even with Rendell now elected tothe duma, are all the slaves as committed as we are? What is to stop one ofthose traitors from slipping outside and selling information to the enemy?”Upset, Rendell rose from his stone bench. “We are sworn to protect Ildakar asmuch as you are. The slaves fought for justice, but they can see a better futurehere. I think I’ve gotten through to them. Once we rebuild the city, it will bepartly theirs. Why would they betray us now?”Nicci narrowed her blue eyes. “I understand your passion, Rendell, but I don’tbelieve everyone is so altruistic. We don’t dare let a whisper get out toGeneral Utros.”“Our greatest weapon is surprise, and we must not give it up,” Lani said. “We’vemade our plan, and we need to launch everything in this attack, cause as muchdamage as possible. We have to convince Utros that we are strong enough todefeat him.”The duma members responded with confidence and enthusiasm. Nicci hoped they wereright.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Inside the fleshmancer’s silent, empty villa, Nathan stepped forward, feelingthe weight of dangerous magic in the air.The two Ixax warriors towered above the rubble. Stone support columns had brokenlike giant tree trunks, toppling amid fragments of the shattered ceiling andcollapsed walls. The weight of the entire building had fallen on top of themotionless behemoths, leaving smears of dust and splinters of stone on theirarmor, but causing no real damage to the titans. The remaining pair stood ready,as they had done for more than fifteen centuries, trapped and unable to move.But aware.Approaching the two giant figures alone, Nathan stared at them with awe and athrill of fear, but even though he knew what horrific damage their unleashedcomrade had caused, he allowed himself a small glimmer of hope. The wizard’shigh leather boots crunched on the broken stone strewn across the cracked tiles.Somewhere, buried under the fresh dust and debris was a large red stain, nowdried—all that remained of Andre, splattered blood, pummeled flesh, andsplintered bone, after the lone awakened Ixax had released his fury. No one hadbothered to clean the mess, since all of the fleshmancer’s servants andapprentices had abandoned him during the uprising.With the tip of his boot, Nathan kicked over a stone, exposing a wiryblood-encrusted hank of hair, next to a curved yellowish fragment, part of thefleshmancer’s skull. “Dear spirits,” he muttered. He couldn’t deny that Andrehad gotten what he deserved after tormenting the three Ixax for centuries.…The single released Ixax warrior had broken through the fleshmancer’s magicaldefenses. Andre had created the titans to defend Ildakar, but they had neverbeen put to use. Out of boredom, he had spent centuries pestering them,tormenting them. No wonder the released giant had created havoc in Ildakarbefore Nathan managed to destroy it. The whole situation was regrettable.Now all of Ildakar was preparing to launch a surprise attack on the ancientarmy. The council had given the people a goal, a hope for real success, althoughNathan thought their hope was based more on enthusiasm than on true militarystrategy. Maybe General Utros would be fooled, and maybe the Ildakaran defenderswould cause some real damage. Or, the military genius might surprise them inturn. After reading so much history, Nathan would not underestimate Utros.He hoped to increase the city’s chances by finding a weapon unlike any theancient army had ever seen. Could the Ixax warriors serve that purpose? Couldthey be controlled?He stepped over a toppled column and stood before the two armored titans, eachfifteen feet tall. They couldn’t speak, but they would listen.Gathering his courage, remembering how he had faced the one enraged Ixax thathad nearly destroyed him, he studied the giants. With his fresh wizard’s robesand his white hair, he did look impressive, like someone in command. The silencewas tense and ominous, but Nathan confidently stared at the two mammoth figures.When he cleared his throat, the sound seemed excessively loud. “Hello!” As soonas the word left his lips, he realized how foolish it sounded. “My name isNathan Rahl. I’m a wizard, but not from Ildakar. I have traveled here fromfar-off lands.”The two Ixax didn’t tremble, didn’t move. The binding spell prevented them.Thick iron helmets encased their heads, leaving only an eye slit. Thick metalarmor wrapped their bodies, thickened at the shoulders, while chest plates werestudded with rounded bosses, engraved with the sun-and-lightning symbol ofIldakar. Their massive arms were bare, with pebbled skin like concrete studdedwith gravel. Their hands were covered with huge gauntlets reinforced with ironknobs and sharp spikes.Each Ixax wore a terrible sword as tall as a man. Their legs were like oaktrunks, rippled with sculpted muscles. Their boots could crush boulders. Throughthe slit in their helmets, round staring eyes the size of pomegranates peeredout, crackling with magic. Andre’s corrupt fleshmancy had taken three mere footsoldiers who had volunteered to defend their beloved city and transformed theminto … this.“I’m sorry for what was done to you,” Nathan said. He hoped they could hear him,hoped they would listen. “I know you didn’t expect this when you offeredyourselves, but Ildakar truly needs you now.”The silence continued to hang over them like a cloak. He couldn’t even hear theIxax warriors breathing. Did they need to breathe?But he sensed a subtle change. Inside their massive helmets, the blazing yellowgaze shifted slightly, their focus changing from an endless stare. A chill wentdown Nathan’s back, and he felt certain that their attention had turned to him.“Fleshmancer Andre did this to you, and he’s paid for the torment he inflicted.You might have seen that with your own eyes.”On the night of Mirrormask’s uprising, one—and only one—of the Ixax had beenawakened, and that juggernaut smashed the entire villa, killed Andre, andrampaged through Ildakar. Only Nathan had been able to stop it.Two of the Ixax remained.“You were created to defend Ildakar,” he said. “I know what was originally inyour hearts. You were brave soldiers, but Ildakar is still under threat. GeneralUtros holds the city under siege. Ildakar still needs you.” He drew a deepbreath. “Even though the city—no, not the city, just some bad people—did youwrong.”He tried to see through the helmet slits, thought he saw the bright eyes tingedwith fury and madness. Nathan pressed on, wondering how many centuries it hadbeen since anyone had spoken to the giant warriors with kindness and compassion.“I understand just a little of how you must feel. I was held prisoner, too, fora thousand years. The Sisters of the Light locked me in the Palace of theProphets because they were afraid of me, just like many Ildakarans are afraid ofyou. I was a prophet, you see, and prophecy can be very dangerous.” He began topace, relaxing a little. He rubbed the scar on his chest, feeling his heartbeat, feeling the restored gift inside him.He remembered when he was just a young boy as the beginnings of his giftmanifested in vivid nightmares, the confusion as his prophecy began to showitself. He was descended from the line of Rahl, so his gift was no surprise, buthe hadn’t known what to do.He could not forget the day when the Sisters had sought him out, as they did allgifted young men. Young Nathan had grown desperate as his headaches grew worse,along with confusion and fear about the incomprehensible prophecies hauntinghim. The Sisters had made promises, which were mostly lies, and he had gone withthem, submitting to the Rada’Han, the iron collar around his neck that allowedthem to control him. That iron collar was different from the immense confinementthat held the Ixax warriors. Even so, he understood …“I will come and speak to you again,” Nathan said in a soothing voice. “Yoursacrifice is not wasted, and we may well need you. Ildakar hasn’t forgotten you,believe me.” He ran his fingers in a nervous gesture down his long hair and felta prickle of sweat on his face. “We still need you, both of you. Truly we do.”He paused for an awkward moment, hoping he could get through to them eventually,before it was too late.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The look on Rendell’s face told Nicci how disturbed and angry he was as he mether outside the grand villa. “Come with me.” He swallowed hard as he led heralong the streets down from the top of the plateau. “The duma members will knowsoon enough, but maybe you and I can avert a bloodbath. This should not havehappened.” He sounded sickened.Nicci followed the former slave to a secluded area down tangled alleys andshaded with tall trees. These were lavish whorehouses that served the wealthy,though the dachas had been frequented less since the night of the uprising, whenthe beautiful silk yaxen had killed some of their abusive customers.Nicci saw frightened faces in doorways as they passed, many of them wearing thedrab clothes of the lower classes, slaves who refused to go back to work. Manyof them had commandeered lavish vacation homes and expensive villas, driving outthe nobles who no longer had as much power as before.Rendell still hadn’t explained the reason for his anger and alarm, but Nicci’suneasiness grew. “Why do you think I can help in this?”The former slave turned to her with a worn expression. “Because you fought forus, Nicci. You led us on the night of the revolt, helped us gain our freedom,when Mirrormask betrayed us.” His eyes looked mournful. “Maybe they will listento you—and me—and make this bloodshed stop.”He led her around a corner to a marble-pillared villa, one of the most expensivesilk yaxen dachas. Ten people had gathered around garbed in grays and browns,muttering to one another. At the front of the dacha, a man’s head rested on apost. His eyes were open and glazed, his mouth slack, his beard curled in fancyringlets, his wavy hair meticulously coiffed, but caked with blood. From anearby pillar, his headless body was suspended upside down by a rope tied aroundhis ankles. Written in the noble’s own blood were the words OUR TURN, splashedacross the white marble.Nicci’s stomach tightened, and her jaws clenched with anger.Rendell said in a hoarse voice, “We must make it stop! All of Ildakar will turnagainst us if we don’t.”Nicci demanded, “Who is the dead man? Do you know his name?”“Lord Aubur. I received a message this morning that said justice had been servedand a monster had been taken care of.” Rendell shook his head, dismayed. “Ididn’t ask for this. It can only make things worse!”Among those standing outside the dacha were five beautiful women dressed infilmy gowns. The silk yaxen stared blank-faced, unaffected by the grisly sight.“Lord Aubur owned three silk yaxen dachas,” Rendell continued. “I heard that hetreated the women poorly, but no worse than most.”Nicci studied their impassive expressions, but saw no blood spatter on theircreamy skin. “Did these women kill their own master?”Rendell pressed his lips together. “I don’t think so, but they will be blamed. Iknow that no silk yaxen could have written me the note I received. Most of themcannot read or write.”Nicci felt the turmoil build within her. She knew nothing about this Lord Aubur,nor did she care about any whoremaster, but she did know that the already tensesociety was only being made worse by continued internal violence. “Ildakar hasmuch healing to do, but you’ll never build a better society if your peoplecontinue to murder the very ones you need to make peace with.”Rendell groaned. “I know! And the fact that I now have a seat on the duma meansthat we have taken a step forward. This is the tenth beheading of a noble sincethe night of the uprising. There are those among the lower classes who want tokill them all and purge the city.”The five silk yaxen continued to stare at the headless body, but the otherspectators drifted away.Nicci fumed. “If you kill all the gifted in the city, then who will help defendyou against General Utros? Have your people not looked outside the walls? Theduma is planning to launch a major attack as soon as we’ve armed and trainedourselves. If the former slaves are so thirsty for blood, then tell them tofight the enemy that threatens all of us!”“You have to help me make them see, Nicci,” Rendell pleaded. “They called outyour name on the night of the revolt. They know you didn’t abandon them likeMirrormask did. They will listen to you.”“I have said it again and again. This is not my city! Saving and rebuildingIldakar has to come from within.”Rendell looked away from the bloody body and the severed head. “Sometimes theyneed a little help. I know how we can spread the word.”Leaving the site of the murder, they moved along the familiar streets to whathad previously been the slave market. Nicci despised the place after the onetime she had watched cheering Ildakaran nobles bidding over the “walking meat.”The market was now occupied by hundreds of liberated slaves who no longer wantedto live in hovels in the lower levels of the city. Reunited family units and newfriends congregated here.When they saw Rendell and recognized Nicci, they cheered, but Rendell raised hishands to demand their attention. The murmurs died down from hundreds of peoplewho gathered around cook fires and under makeshift awnings.“You think you have your freedom,” Rendell said, his voice rough and angry. “Youthink you won, but some among you are trying to destroy our only chance. You arepointing a knife straight at our own hearts!” He paused. “Another noble has beenkilled.”“We are free,” called out one gruff man. He had a scar on his face and wasdressed in the clothes of a worker in the yaxen slaughter yards. Niccirecognized the man from the night of the fires after she had fought the spinywolves. He and his partner had proudly presented her with the severed heads offour nobles they had killed.“You haven’t earned your freedom,” Nicci said in a low, dangerous voice. “Thereis a cost for freedom, and it often comes in blood. But not just any blood. Youcannot keep spilling it indiscriminately.”The people muttered. They had expected congratulations, not scolding from thesetwo people they considered heroes.Rendell looked beseechingly at the crowd. “You all know I have a place on theduma council. Before long we’ll include others from the lower classes, not justgifted nobles but tradesmen, workers, even more slaves like myself. We have towork for equal representation.”“We have to finish purging the disease that makes Ildakar sick,” said thescarred man in a challenging tone. He turned his head so that his voice boomedout to the crowd. “You all know what they did to us. Justice must be served.”“And peace has to be arranged!” Rendell said. “Many nobles have been murdered.”“Not murdered—executed!” said the gruff man. “For crimes committed against us.”“By what trial and what authority?” Nicci demanded. “You hated how the powerfulnobles abused you. Now you want to do the same? Ildakar is still under siege,and we have to fight the ancient army, together. We need every person, everynoble, every slave, every tradesman. The city has to be strong, not tearingitself apart from within.”“Lord Aubur deserved what happened to him,” insisted the gruff man. “We all knowwhat he did to the silk yaxen.”Since neither Nicci nor Rendell had mentioned the victim’s name, it was plainthat this man had been involved. She stepped closer to him. “This new murderwill touch a spark to the tinderbox of the duma members. Do you know how muchwork it was to get them to accept Rendell on the council? You will erase all theprogress we’ve made. Are you fools?”The people muttered, looking embarrassed. Timothy, the young half-stone yaxenherder, came forward. “We are a long way from evening the score. We thought youwould fight on our side for justice, Nicci.”Nicci turned to the young man who had once been a statue. “Every victim seesjustice in a different way. Your actions make the nobles feel like victims, andso they will retaliate.” She gestured to the crowds around the slave market, themakeshift tents, the piles of plundered supplies from noble villas. “It willtake the best of my ability to convince the hard-line duma members not to simplycome here and burn you out. The city guard could surround this square withtorches and swords and slaughter all of you in revenge for what one man did toLord Aubur.” She glared at the gruff man who seemed to take such pride in hisexecutions. “All because some of you couldn’t wait for revenge.”“We all want revenge,” said the gruff man with a twisted smile. “One piece at atime.”“I thought you wanted justice, not revenge,” Nicci said. “And justice requiresan accounting. You declared Aubur guilty and beheaded him because you thoughtyou were his judge, and now the nobles will want your blood in repayment forhis. You’ve kept the wheel turning, round and round.”“It’s a step in the right direction.” The scarred man crossed his beefy armsover his chest, refusing to back down. “I thought you’d be pleased after allthose words you said when you led us against Sovrena Thora. I thought you wereon our side. I thought you stood against evil.”“Evil takes many forms, including self-justification. Hard justice is how westop this cycle. You are the one who killed Lord Aubur. You know it. We all knowit.” She took a step closer to the man. The other people in the square shifteduneasily.The murderer squared his shoulders and faced Nicci. Though she was smaller instature, she was far more powerful.“This is how I make the accounting,” she said. “Afterward, I’ll convince theduma that the guilty man has paid for his crimes, and no further retaliation isnecessary.” Her voice boomed out to all those gathered in the market. “But itmust end here. No more nobles can be attacked if you ever hope to find equalfooting in Ildakar. Do you understand?”The scarred man snorted. “I’ll go and talk to them myself, give them a piece ofmy mind.” He still did not comprehend his danger. “I’ll make them see. I’ll—”Nicci reached out with her gift and, with barely a thought, stopped the man’sheart. His eyes bulged. He twitched, then toppled like a felled yaxen on thetiles of the slave market, stone dead.As the people gasped, Nicci looked to Rendell, who swallowed hard, then nodded.Rendell said to the crowd, “I speak to you as a member of the duma. We can’tplay favorites. If we want equality, then we have to be equal, with equal rules.If we want freedom, we have to pay the price of our freedom. If we want our partof Ildakar, we have to be a part of Ildakar.”Nicci spoke into the stunned silence. “That means you have to fight for Ildakar,too. When we attack the general’s army, we will need as many fighters as we canpossibly have. We’ll give you training, weapons, and armor if you help in theassault. If you are going to shed blood for your freedom, then make sure it’sthe right blood.”The frightened people were cowed into nervous shifting.“When the duma members find out about the murder of Lord Aubur, Rendell and Iwill inform them the matter is over.” Nicci paused long enough to sweep herintense gaze across them all, saw that her words had made an impact. The deadman lay sprawled on the flagstones, and no one came closer to him.Nicci gave a quick nod. “Good. Then, as I said, the matter is over.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 29 [contents.xhtml#c_ch29]Bannon had fought battles before, but he had never gone to full-scale war. Now,he stepped out onto the combat arena sands at night, gripping Sturdy in hissweaty palm. Lila and the other morazeth had trained him with clubs, knives, andfists, but he preferred his sword. With its discolored steel, unadorned pommel,and flat blade guard, the sword didn’t look like much, but neither did Bannon.Appearances could be deceiving.When a weapon cleaved an enemy in two, what difference did it make if the steelwas bright or tarnished?In the cool evening air he wore nothing but a fighting girdle around his waistand the kind of combat sandals preferred by Ildakaran warriors. Soon enough, therigors of fighting would warm him. Even though he was confident in his skills,the thought of rushing out with only his sword against thousands ofhalf-petrified warriors sent a chill down his spine.As the duma’s plans proceeded, the fighters would keep practicing, honing theirskills for the massive surprise attack. Around the top ring of the arena,blazing crystalline torches glowed like blue-white suns against the darkness,illuminating the arena. Sixty of the best warriors, along with officers of thecity guard, emerged from the arched gates to the open sands, carrying theirpractice swords, staves, and spears. The Ildakar arena sometimes presentednighttime exhibitions, melees with dozens of fighters that resulted in anexciting slaughter. Tonight, the patchwork army of defenders would practice deepinto the darkness.Bannon had tied his long hair back so it wouldn’t get in his way while fighting.Lila had suggested he chop off his locks, as Nicci had. “An enemy can grab yourhair, boy, yank it, throw you off balance, even snap your neck.”Thinking of Nicci’s spell-possessed hair made him shiver, but he shook his head.“I haven’t cut my hair since I left Chiriya Island. I won’t lose that part ofwho I am.”“Then you might lose your head.”“I’ll try not to.”Lila’s expression was hard, but he could see the softness behind her eyes. “Seethat you don’t, for my sake if nothing else.”Facing the warriors on the field, Lila and six other morazeth held their weaponsof choice. The branded runes that covered their skin protected them againstmagic but not traditional weapons, and Utros and the ancient soldiers wouldfight with real weapons instead of spells. The women remained fixated ondefending Ildakar. To them, their purpose had not changed. An opponent was anopponent.Bannon had talked to many of the arena warriors, asking if they resented themorazeth for the abuses done to them, but most seasoned warriors already hadtheir independence beaten out of them over the years. He remembered howwholeheartedly loyal Ian, Ildakar’s champion, had been to Adessa, but she hadkilled him on the night of the revolt. For that, Bannon could never forgive themorazeth leader, any more than he could forgive the Norukai slavers.But Lila … He slowly, reluctantly, began to understand the young woman’smind-set. Her harsh and painful tutelage had made him a far better fighter, andthose skills might save him when he fought against a real enemy.Now, the morazeth women drew their weapons. Lila held a short sword in one hand,a whip in the other, while others held wooden fighting staves, long hooks, tallpikes. Genda, a squarish, stocky fighter, wore metal-studded gloves on each handand prepared to fight with her fists alone.Lila called, “There is no excuse for failure. When we attack General Utros andhis army, don’t embarrass me by getting killed.” She meant no humor in herstatement, though some of the city guard chuckled nervously. The arena warriorsdid not. “You will fight and you will learn. And if you do well enough in realbattle, you may not need to fight Utros again.”“We’ll make them sting, ha ha!” called a bright young voice.Bannon turned to see Timothy, whose rough-spun slave clothes had been replacedwith a fighter’s girded waistcloth. The scamp wore no shirt and gripped a shortsword that looked too big for him. His skin was gray-white from the lingeringstone effect, and when he swung his sword, his movements were slow and hisjoints stiff, but the grin on his face was real.Lila seemed impressed. “I expect every one of you to be at least as brave andstrong as a lowly yaxen herder.”Some of the fighters affirmed that they were, while others, particularly thehaughty city guard members, grumbled at the boy’s arrogance.“We’ll fight beside you, Timothy,” Bannon said.The seven morazeth trainers divided the fighters into squads, so that thesmaller teams could spar against one another.“Out in the combat field,” Lila said, “you won’t have a well-mannered arenafight. If you don’t watch your back while battling one enemy, another mightthrust a spear through your heart. Don’t expect rules, don’t expect honor.” Shestrode among them, glaring at those who didn’t show sufficient confidence. “AndI don’t expect you to fight with neat rules either. A real battle is not a game,and the winners don’t receive ribbons or trophies, though some of you mightreceive a pleasurable reward from one of our beautiful morazeth.” She waited,sure she had their attention. “You are responsible for protecting our city andpreserving our freedom.”“And do we have freedom now?” asked one of the household slaves, a muscular manwho had volunteered for training.“You have more freedom than you had before,” Lila answered. “And if GeneralUtros is defeated, you will be in a position to demand more.”The former slave rested the point of his sword in the sand and stood with hislegs spread, facing Lila, who came forward to meet his challenge. He said, “Icould have had complete freedom if I’d slipped away one night. Many others ranfrom Ildakar, and now they have full lives far from here. Some mountain villageslike Stravera accept runaway slaves. When my friend Garth ran off, he begged meto go with him, but I listened to Mirrormask instead. I stayed behind tooverthrow Ildakar for the freedom of all.” He grimaced. “Now look at us! Theentire city is imprisoned. I should have left when I had the chance.”Lila stepped so close to him that her flesh nearly touched his. “Do you thinkyou could escape now? Why not slip out at night, tiptoe through the thousands ofenemy soldiers? Be my guest.”“I’ll stay,” the man grumbled. “And I’ll fight. I already made up my mind. Thesorceress convinced me.”Lila stepped back. “Good, then you’ll be my first opponent tonight.” She glancedto the side. “Bannon, you train Timothy. Break the yaxen herder if you can.”Genda let out a loud shrill whistle, and all the fighters stood at attention.Kedra, Lyesse, Marla, Thorn, and Ricia took up their positions, facing groups ofopponents. When Genda whistled a second time, the battle was unleashed.The arena rang with wooden staves striking armor, hardened gloves smackingagainst flesh, steel crashing against steel. Big Genda struck her opponent inthe chest with a steel-mesh fist and knocked him back onto the soft sand.Without hesitation, Timothy swung his short sword at Bannon, laughing as heattacked. Bannon lifted Sturdy to deflect the blow, and he smiled as well,seeing the scamp’s eager fury. Timothy flailed his sword from side to side withno finesse, and Bannon easily countered each thrust, each parry. He couldn’thelp but think of his own clumsy abilities when he had first bought Sturdy froma Tanimura swordsmith. Vowing never to be defenseless again, he’d used his lastcoins to buy the weapon, but he hadn’t really known how to fight.Timothy drove at him with such energy that Bannon took a step back. He met everyblow, countering the boy’s energy, but all too often the yaxen herder lefthimself wide open. As soon as Bannon saw a chance, he struck hard, crashing theflat of the blade on the boy’s shoulder. He checked his blow at the lastinstant, not wanting to injure Timothy, but to his amazement his steel merelyglanced off the bare shoulder, as if it had struck a hard surface. Bannonhesitated in surprise, and his young opponent charged forward, smashing Sturdyso hard that Bannon nearly dropped the weapon.Timothy let out a cry of joy. “I could have killed you, Bannon Farmer! Beware ofa worthy opponent like myself.”Bannon slipped under the boy’s short sword and again struck his scrawny arm withthe flat of his blade. “And I could have cut off your arm.”“Could you? My skin is better protection than any armor you’ve ever worn.Besides, I have two arms, and by the Keeper’s beard, I could keep fighting evenif I lost one.”Around them, the loud combat continued, punctuated with yelps of pain asfighters suffered blunted blows from the morazeth. One arena veteran, a man withscars on his skin and face, seemed uninspired in his fighting. His morazethopponent, Ricia, knocked him to the ground and placed her sword against hischest. “Aren’t you interested? When you fail, you will die. Remember that whenyou fight the enemy soldiers.”The veteran’s face turned ruddy. He picked himself up from the combat sands,brushing himself off where dust clung to his sweat and blood. “I make noexcuses, Ricia.” Letting out a growl, he fought with renewed energy.Bannon kept sparring with Timothy, although perspiration dripped down his faceand his muscles ached. The scamp was reckless and full of energy, and afterBannon suffered several bruises, he decided to stop going easy on the young man.“You’re careless,” he warned, and slapped the flat of his sword against theboy’s hardened thigh.“We need to take risks!” Timothy said. “How else are a thousand of us going tofight tens of thousands of enemies? Or more?”Bannon didn’t have an answer for that, so instead, he just fought harder.A man’s voice spoke out from the arched entry at the edge of the arena. “Ibrought two more for you to train.”Genda whistled again, and the fighting stuttered to a halt. The grunts, clangs,and clatters faded into heaving breaths, coughs, and groans of pain.Lord Oron nudged two young men ahead of him. “My son Brock and his friend Jedwill do their duty to fight for Ildakar. Lady Olgya and I have encouraged themto volunteer for the upcoming offensive.”Bannon wiped sweat from his face as he stared at the once-haughty young men. Hewondered if his harsh words in the skinning house had had any effect on them.They wore colorful silk jerkins sashed at the waist, Brock dressed in crimson,Jed in forest green. Both wore black pantaloons and polished boots, and eachcarried a gleaming sword, fresh from the city armory. Clearly, the weapons hadnever been used in battle or even practice.As the trainees looked at them, a few snickered or muttered. Jed and Brockstumbled forward, uncertain. Brock turned back to his father. “But we’re gifted.We should be testing our skills in magic. Train us!”“You could have been doing that all these years,” Oron said, “but it’s also goodto learn how to fight for yourselves.” With a brusque gesture, he forced them tojoin the other sweaty trainees.Lila came forward. “Those two should strip down if they intend to fight. Thisisn’t a pleasure party or a banquet, and we wouldn’t want to stain those finesilks.”Oron made no move to join the two newcomers on the training field. “These newsilks might protect them. Jed’s mother says the fabric may be impervious toblows.” He frowned at the boys, showing his impatience. “Jed and Brock arepleased to test the garments against your weapons.”The two young men fidgeted nervously.Bannon nudged Timothy, and he and the young yaxen herder went to meet the pair.“We’ll train with Jed and Brock, and we’ll go easy on them for now.”The two young nobles responded with arrogance, as if Bannon and the young scampwere far beneath them.“Oh, show them no mercy,” Oron said with an iron smile. “General Utros certainlywon’t.” The lord tossed his yellow braid behind him as he stalked out of thearena.Bannon and Timothy faced the newcomers, who drew their pristine swords. Gendalet out her shrill whistle again, and the fighting commenced.When Bannon met the nervous gaze of Jed and Brock, he remembered how he’dberated them for what they had done to him, but he doubted his words had changedtheir attitude. Brock and Jed certainly hadn’t apologized to him.“We’re all on the same side now, Bannon Farmer,” Jed said grudgingly, “forIldakar.”Brock added, “If we defeat General Utros, then you and your friends can leave.It can’t be too soon for me.”“I would like nothing more than that,” Bannon said. He was genuinely tired ofthis legendary city.“Enough talk!” Timothy ran forward, swinging his sword and startling Brock, whoreeled back. He tried to bring up his own blade in defense, but the scamp wastoo wild. Timothy’s sword struck Brock on the left biceps, and Bannon feared hewould cleave the young noble’s arm right off with the first blow, but the silkfabric held like tough, fine chain mail. Even so, the hard blow elicited ascream from Brock, who staggered away clutching his bruised arm. Timothy drovein for the kill, looking as if he meant it.Jed ran to defend his friend, intercepting the yaxen herder. Bannon and thescamp fought together, testing the two nobles as they regained their footing andhelped each other.“This isn’t how I wanted to fight,” Jed whined.“I’ve seen you fight,” Bannon said bitterly. “You went out to smash the faces ofstatue soldiers who couldn’t even move.”Still wincing, barely able to bend his bruised arm, Brock said, “We damagedhundreds of them, and that’s hundreds more enemy soldiers than you fought,Bannon Farmer.”“We should have destroyed thousands more,” Jed said.“I’ll grant you that, but now you have to stand against soldiers who canactually fight back.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 30 [contents.xhtml#c_ch30]Slogging through the muck, her skin covered with insect bites and slime, Adessaused her dagger to hack at a thorn vine that hung in her path. The plant’stendrils recoiled when her blade severed them, leaking greenish sap, like blood.These mindless hazards kept her from her real prey, Wizard Commander Maxim.One of the thorn vines actively slashed at her like a whip. The sharp spinesglistened with diamondlike drops of venom. One of the thorns caught Adessa onthe arm, slicing across her skin, and she whirled and slashed once, twice,severing the tentacle from its base and letting the twitching tendril fall intothe muddy swamp beside her.She looked at the scratch and saw that her skin was already inflamed. Withouthesitation, she used the dagger to slice her own arm, turning the scratch into aprofusely bleeding cut. She squeezed and milked it to make the flowing bloodflush out the poison. She sheathed the dagger and now used her sword to chopaway the rest of the attacking vines, then pressed forward, following Maxim’sfaint trail.She had confronted him only once, that night at his camp when he’d distractedher with magic and left her to fight a pair of swamp dragons. While Maximvanished into the wilderness, she battled the large lizards for half an hourbefore finally dispatching them. She hadn’t found him again since.Now Adessa’s work would be more difficult, because he knew that Thora had senther on this mission to kill him, and he knew how deadly the morazeth were,especially her.As she searched for his trail, she pondered what her sisters were doing back inIldakar. She assumed they had quelled the unrest and saved the sovrena. Adessahad faith in them, and she would worry about her own task. When she brought backthe wizard commander’s head, she would once again concern herself with Ildakar.Alert for more attacking vines, she picked her way through the swamp, studyingbroken twigs, crushed grasses, old footprints in the soft muck. She knew Maximwas a day or more ahead of her. Fortunately for Adessa, even though he was apowerful wizard, the man was not particularly good at covering his tracks.She continued, cautious in the hazy light that penetrated the leaves overhead.She didn’t want her scorn for Maxim to let her make mistakes. Yesterday, she hadgotten off on a wrong trail and followed what turned out to be a young blackbear, which had bolted into the underbrush. She realized that Maxim had gone adifferent direction entirely. Several wasted hours later, she finally foundwhere she’d gone astray. Now she was after him again. She moved along, eyes tothe ground, scanning around her for spiderwebs, attacking vines, or swampdragons lying in wait.Back in the city, Maxim had been an aloof man. Despite his rank, he treatedIldakar with disrespect, and now Adessa knew that Maxim was Mirrormask, atraitor who had fomented the rebellion among the slaves, causing untold harm tothe city. Even without the sovrena’s orders, Adessa was convinced that thewizard commander had to die for his crimes.She was devoted to Ildakar and always had been. Adessa had been born centuriesafter the shroud of eternity was put in place, and she had grown up hearinglegends of outside enemies, but never seeing any threat beyond the unrest withinIldakar itself.As a girl, Adessa had shown great physical prowess in rough-and-tumble gamesthat nobles watched for amusement. She had been recruited by three morazeth whocame to her parents’ home one day and paid them gold from the Ildakarantreasury. More importantly, they convinced Adessa’s mother and father, and thegirl herself, that joining them was the greatest honor their beloved city couldbestow. Agreeing wholeheartedly, Adessa promised to become the best morazethIldakar had known, but her father had chastised her for bragging. “You don’thave to be the best. Being a morazeth is enough.”She had joined other girls her age, begun combat sparring. From the very firstday, it was more exhausting and painful than anything she’d ever experienced. Atfirst, the recruits treated one another as friends, but when the girls didn’tfight hard enough, or strive with all their might to hurt their opponents—theircomrades—other morazeth would come in with clubs, gang up on the entire team,and beat them senseless until the girls understood. Or at least most of themdid.Two of the new trainees died in the first week. By the second month, Adessakilled one of them herself, a young girl who had tried to make friends, butshowed a core of weakness. After Adessa did that, she’d been rewarded with thefirst protective rune branded on her upper arm.She remembered the expressionless morazeth standing close, noddingencouragement, whispering, watching as the training leader removed a white-hotbranding iron from an intense brazier fire. Adessa braced herself, knowing thatif she cried out, she would be punished for her weakness. She thought she wasprepared, but nothing had readied her for the searing bolt of heat that screamedthrough her skin, into her nerves, until it exploded in her mind. Adessa grittedher teeth and made no sound, listened to the sickening sizzle, smelled theburning meat of her own arm. The pain lasted forever, but it was done as swiftlyas the morazeth could manage. Someone splashed a bucket of cold water on her armand another doused her eyes to wash away any hint of tears that might haveleaked out of her squeezed lids.“It’s all right,” said the training leader, replacing the still-smoking brand inthe brazier. “You can faint now.”With her trainer’s permission, Adessa collapsed.Over the years, each branded mark had been just as painful, but Adessa neverscreamed, never flinched, never cried. And now, her skin was a completeleatherwork of art. No part of her was vulnerable to a magical attack.Adessa was proud of the ancient tradition, a carefully bonded society of womenwarriors, guardians. According to very old legends, some morazeth had gone northas mercenaries, but they were long departed, and if any of their teachingssurvived, the women must have changed dramatically in the intervening millennia.Adessa and the morazeth of Ildakar remained unwavering.Now when darkness fell in the swamps and Adessa could no longer be sure of herpath, she found a place to camp, resting on the ground against a wide tree trunkbeneath dangling beards of moss. She let herself doze, her senses alert for anycreature that might consider her an easy meal. As she sat motionless, she hearda rustle in the grasses. She peered out from behind the mossy veil to see aserpent as thick around as her thigh gliding through the underbrush.When the snake broke through the reeds, sensing Adessa, it rose up to reveal notone serpent head, but three of them branched like a trident from its neck,tasting the air with black tongues. Each had only a single eye, and when theystruck forward, the three mouths yawned open to reveal curved fangs.Adessa prepared to fight. Even with three heads, a snake was just a snake. Shefelt no fear.The central head plunged down to strike her, but she ducked to the side, lettingthe fangs sink into the moss-covered tree trunk. In the instant it was trapped,Adessa struck off its head with her sword, and dark blood spurted out of thestump.The other two serpent heads attacked. The thick main body rolled forward, risingup as the remaining pair of heads lashed out. She lifted her sword overhead andbrought it down with a single stroke, splitting the snake at the juncture of thelast two heads. The sharp blade cut down along its spine, and the snake floppedin two halves like a split ribbon. The separated heads, not knowing they weredead, kept trying to bite her. She continued sawing downward and finally cutthrough the snake’s heart, or one of its hearts, and its entire body collapsed.Adessa grimaced in disgust as she found herself covered with serpent blood aswell as insect bites, mud, and sweat. Standing over the dead hulk of the snake,she used her dagger to skin off the scaly hide. Snake meat, even raw, wasnourishment.As she chewed on the moist reptilian flesh, Adessa withdrew into her makeshiftshelter again, resting, pondering. She still felt the blood magic from theunborn infant within her, enhancing her senses and powers, and she knew thatboost would last until she tracked down and killed Maxim.But she had to sustain herself. She made sure she drank enough water, ate enoughfood, to keep her body strong. Over the years, she had given the sameadmonishment to all trainees in the combat arena. Adessa had never thought ofthe fighters as slaves, but as her pets, and pets needed to be disciplined.Now, in the dark buzzing swamp, she recalled the champions she had made and thelovers she had rewarded over the years. When she was finished with them, thosemen were completely loyal to her, wrapped around her finger even when she sentthem into the combat arena to die. Many had been kidnapped from outsidevillages, taken when they were young and broken, sold by Norukai raiders, orborn of other slaves inside the city.Ian, her last champion, her last lover, had been a devoted young man who neverdisappointed her, always defended her, until the end, when that outsider Bannonhad made him remember his past. Though Bannon seemed a weak and naive young man,he created hair-fine cracks in Ian’s armor of duty and eventually turned herchampion against her.Adessa still didn’t understand what she had done wrong. She had taken Ian intoher bed and had shown him true passion, primal lovemaking like the rutting ofwild animals. His pleasure had been so great he nearly fell unconscious aftersatisfying himself. Adessa had even let herself grow fond of him, sometimesholding his sweaty body against hers after he was sated and after she, too, hadlet herself release that inner thunder of pleasure. She’d let him plant hischild in her, and Adessa had felt it growing, the energy of the unborn part ofher.If not for the uprising, she would have given birth to Ian’s baby, but Ian hadbetrayed her, and so she killed him. Instead, that child growing within her hadproven to be a powerful resource, an innocent life. In addition to theprotective runes that covered her skin, Adessa now had that blood magic, thelife magic of the unborn child, a sacrifice as potent as any slave on the greatpyramid. As a woman she had given life, and as a morazeth she took it back.Now, as the hours of the night crawled along, she sat against the mossy bark ofthe tree, sensed the emptiness in her womb and compared it to the fresh strengththroughout her muscles.She waited several hours for the moon to rise, and under the silvery light, sheemerged and sprinted off again in pursuit of her quarry."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 31 [contents.xhtml#c_ch31]Sitting inside her dark dungeon cell, Sovrena Thora wished she could become astatue again and let time slide past until this nonsense was over. Since herhardened body had no need to eat or drink, the guards had stopped bothering todeliver her meals.The dank cell remained silent, a stillness so deep that when she concentratedThora could hear the delicate movement of spider legs. She once heard a ratskitter across the floor until it found a hole somewhere and escaped. No verminhad any interest in her partially petrified body.After hearing the rat, she ignited a small flame in her hand and spent hoursinspecting her chamber, touching each stone block from floor to ceiling.Eventually she discovered a small chink in the stone that made a crack just wideenough for a skinny rat. It wouldn’t help her escape at all.It maddened her most that she had no idea what was happening in Ildakar. Whatfoolishness were the dithering duma members undertaking, what irreparabledamage? By now Nicci and Nathan had likely taken over the duma, named themselvessovrena and wizard commander, even though they didn’t belong in Ildakar. Thorahad spent centuries building her perfect city and the interloper Nicci had beenhere for what? A month?The city Thora loved so much was disintegrating while she was trapped in here.She didn’t know whether it was day or night outside.After an interminable time, she heard movement in the corridor, saw bright lightseeping through the small barred opening. The diversion piqued her interest, andshe crept to the door, listening to footsteps. She assumed it was the rudeguards again, street rabble who had no business wearing the city uniform.The footsteps sounded slower than a normal gait, like a warrior weighed downwith armor. Since she was the only prisoner in these dungeons, and since theprotective runes around the door kept her from attacking with magic, Thorawondered why anyone would need such protection against her.A person approached the door, and she heard the rattle of a heavy key in thelock. The crossbar slid aside and the hinges creaked. The door opened, allowingmore light to stream in from the corridor. Facing her visitor, Thora wasastonished to see the sorceress Lani, the woman who had challenged her and lost,who had spent centuries as a statue to serve as a warning for other would-bechallengers.Now, the two rivals stared at each other. Thora could feel hatred emanating fromher. “I came to speak with you, Thora,” Lani finally said, refusing to use herlost title. “Much needs to be said.”Thora wasn’t impressed. “You came to gloat.”“Not everyone is like you.” Lani remained at the door, and Thora made no movetoward her. Although Thora was a greater sorceress than the other woman wouldever be, Lani was not weak. Nevertheless, the spell runes would stifle anyattack Thora might release.Lani continued, “I remember Ildakar from before, and I see the city now. Backthen, I challenged you because I saw the damage you were doing. I’m appalled athow much worse you’ve made it. Thank the spirits we can begin rebuilding now,with you and Maxim out of the way.”“I preserved Ildakar! I love Ildakar,” Thora sneered. “You were always weak,just a follower, calling your birds, playing with water and scrying magic.” Shesniffed. “I learned from you. I kept cages of larks as my own pretty pets, andwith your scrying spells I was able to spy on the unrest in my city.”“It’s no longer your city,” Lani said.“That may be true now, but the people know what I did for them. Soon enoughthey’ll realize that Ildakar will fall without me.”The other woman suddenly changed the subject. “What did you do to Renn?” Quiet,intelligent Lani had contented herself with the weak wizard, not the best choicefor a partner, although Renn had indeed been more handsome back then.Now Thora realized what had really brought the woman here. “He’s gone on afool’s errand, and I doubt we’ll ever see him again. I wouldn’t expect him tosucceed.”“I know you sent him to find Cliffwall,” Lani replied, “but what did you do tohim in the intervening centuries? You hurt him, didn’t you? He was such a wiseman, full of ideas, a scholar, a historian. He and I would spend hours togetherstudying ancient spell books to hone our gifts.”“Yes, I remember how sweet it was,” Thora scoffed. “When you two went to bedtogether, did you tuck ancient books under your pillows for added romance?”Lani looked annoyed. “Just because we refused to take part in your pleasureparties doesn’t mean we didn’t experience our own love. You dispatched my poorRenn into the wild without preparation. How could he survive such a journey?”“That depends entirely on his own abilities,” Thora said.“In that case, I have confidence in him. And when Renn does come back and rejoinus, the duma will be even stronger. We’ll rebuild Ildakar together and make thiscity into a perfect society for all, not just for your selfish pleasure.”Thora found herself offended by the lies. “There was nothing selfish about myrule of Ildakar. Everything I did as sovrena was to make the city great. Thepeople will realize that in time. I’ll wait.” The flickering flame in her palmsuddenly flared brighter. “The only reason you’re outside that door instead ofme is because of an accident. Three other duma members betrayed me, and myhusband betrayed all of us. You had no hand in this victory.”Lani responded with a small smile. “A victory by accident is still a victory,and you’re still in the dungeon where you can do no further harm.”Her smug words enraged Thora. She bunched her stony muscles, gritted her teeth,and felt power building within her, but she knew she couldn’t release her gift.“I want to save my city, and you’ll soon see that you need my help. The peoplewill appreciate me.”“They appreciate their freedom more,” said Lani. “We voted in new duma members,not just Oron and Olgya, but also a representative of the freed slaves who canspeak for the lower classes. There will be merchant duma members to helpdetermine Ildakar’s future. Together, we are one united population with a commonenemy, General Utros. Someday all those people you hurt might be willing toforgive you, but not now.”Thora remained silent, and her stiff skin helped to mask her angry expression.She used words she knew would cut Lani deeply. “After I defeated you and turnedyou to stone, Renn was a broken man. He still served on the duma, but he wasweak, listless. He would look at your statue and sometimes weep. A patheticlittle man, but I kept him because he did as he was told. I could have taken himas my lover anytime. Renn was entirely mine. He barely cared for himself. Hegained weight, his clothes were shabby and ill fitting. Even you wouldn’t wanthim now.”“I’ll decide that when I see him again.” Lani stepped away from the door,finished with her confrontation. “I don’t think I’ll ever see you again, though.If we leave you here in the cell forever, maybe Ildakar will heal.”She pushed the heavy door shut and slammed the crossbar into place. Keys rattledin the lock, and Lani extinguished the bright torches even before she left thecorridors.In darkness and silence again, Thora felt helpless, furious. She had given herentire life to creating the legend of Ildakar, and now it was all being stolenfrom her. She could do nothing about it.Thora stood in front of the barricaded door. She called up the magic within her,flared the flame so she could study her stone block walls yet again. She knewthe protective runes were powerful. She had crafted many of them herself longago. No spell of hers could ever break them.Though she knew no one could hear her, Thora let out a loud scream offrustration. The sound echoed throughout the corridors, bouncing back on thestone walls of her cell. Unleashing all the power in her half-petrified body,she swung her fist and pounded the stone blocks that held the door in place. Herskin was hard and could feel no pain, and this time she didn’t care. She couldmangle her hand if she wanted, because it would heal.Fury turned her fist into a battering ram. When she smashed the offendingblocks, she felt the thunderous impact and heard a crack. Thora stepped away insurprise, holding up her hand to illuminate the chamber. Her stone fists werebarely damaged, but when she looked at the blocks around the door, she saw afracture in one stone. She had done that?This wasn’t magic. It was sheer, brute force. Her anger and her hardened bodywere powerful enough to break stone! She wondered how much damage she could do.With a growing sense of wonder, she ran her hardened fingers along the crack,noting how her blow had damaged the spell rune. Even if direct magic could notbreak her free, maybe her body could produce enough force to do it. She lookedat her barely damaged knuckles and considered.This was very interesting indeed, and Thora had all the time in the world."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 32 [contents.xhtml#c_ch32]After Renn settled in at Cliffwall, he would sit for hours with scholars whogathered around him as he held court. Verna listened to the stories, though shedoubted some of his descriptions.Renn waxed poetic about Ildakar, wistfully talking about the things he missed.“The city has fountains on every level, and so many statues! The sculptors ofIldakar are master artisans, shaping solid marble as if it were soft clay.” Heheaved a sigh. “And our terraced orchards produce the most delicious littleapples you’ve ever tasted, lovely for making apple wine.”He had trimmed his beard, combed and oiled his brown hair after the hard days oftraveling. In the intervening weeks Renn had indulged in Cliffwall’shospitality, and now his cheeks were round again, the shadows gone from underhis eyes. He was relaxed and loquacious.As Verna listened to him talk, she hoped to learn more about Nicci and Nathan,and how they were promoting Lord Rahl’s expectations for peace, freedom, andprosperity. Beside her, Amber listened intently, as if she were in a class aboutsecure binding webs taught by the Sisters of the Light. When Renn waxed poeticabout Ildakar, his most attentive listeners were Oliver and Peretta. The twoyoung scholars had explored enough of the world to know that there was much moreto see.“And how far away is Ildakar? Exactly?” Oliver inquired. “How long would it takeus to go there? If we wanted to travel, I mean.”Renn nibbled on a crumbly biscuit from a plate beside his chair, then brushedcrumbs from his restored maroon robes. “Oh, it is very far, a terrible journey.We took weeks of hard marching to find Cliffwall.”Peretta’s face pinched with concentration. “But you didn’t know where you weregoing. Surely it wouldn’t be so hard to find the route back? Oliver and Icrossed half the Old World in that amount of time.”“Well, uh,” Renn fumbled, then wiped his mouth, “the landscape is rugged,trackless for the most part. We had great tribulations and difficulties.”“We had a few of those ourselves,” Oliver admitted. “Still, I’d like to seeIldakar with my own eyes.”Verna was surprised that the wizard looked downcast, not at all excited by theprospect of going home. “Yes, very understandable. Captain Trevor and I did seesome spectacular terrain, but…” He dropped his voice, uncertain. “There’s achance we will never find Ildakar because it is no longer there. The sovrena andthe wizard commander were planning to raise the shroud of eternity again, and ifthey did, I will be forever outside.” He sounded professorial again. “It isn’tdissimilar to the camouflage shroud that hid this archive for all thosecenturies.”Verna spoke up. “Cliffwall’s camouflage shroud is down permanently. In fact, ifwe could find a way to put it back in place, then the archives would never fallinto the wrong hands.” The gathered scholars muttered at her suggestion, butVerna casually brushed her curly gray-brown hair away from her ears. “It may bethe only way to keep it entirely safe.”Amber looked to her in alarm. “But if we did that, none of us could study thearchives. There’s so much here to learn, Prelate.” Her face grew flushed.“I meant only as a last desperate measure to protect the archive.” Verna triedto calm them. “General Zimmer always likes to be prepared.”In the confined canyon, Zimmer drilled his soldiers every day, keeping them ingood fighting shape. Trevor and his Ildakaran guards joined in the efforts. Sofar, they had heard no rumors of any great army like Jagang’s sweeping acrossthe Old World, but Zimmer would never let down his guard.Gloria and Franklin walked into the chamber, overhearing the last part of theconversation. Gloria said, “I would object to that strenuously, Prelate. Ourknowledge belongs to all people. We can’t seal the archive again.”Franklin said, “In ancient times we had to protect this lore from EmperorSulachan, but now it should be available to all gifted students, for the benefitof humanity.”“And not just to Ildakar.” Gloria narrowed her eyes as she looked at Renn.The wizard had finished the last biscuit on his plate. “I agree. The knowledgeshould be shared with all, under certain restrictions. Sovrena Thora might haveselfish uses, but there are many gifted among the duma members and the nobleclasses of Ildakar. I can just imagine how my Lani and I would have adored theopportunity to study here!” He flashed a wistful smile. “Opening the Cliffwallarchive could be the start of a new golden age. We could bring back a time ofwizards, like in the ancient history books.”“We’re just starting to learn here,” said Franklin. “Many of our scholars knowsome basic spells, but it’ll take centuries before we have a firm grasp on whatthe archive even holds. We don’t want to be rash.” He lowered his voice. “Welearned that lesson already.”Verna spoke up. “Nicci made her concerns clear when she asked forrepresentatives to come and help protect the archive. The knowledge in Cliffwallis dangerous, and it should be guarded against abuse.” She looked at thegathered listeners. “But there is more to our mission. We serve Lord Rahl inD’Hara, and his rule will bring strength and happiness to the Old World. We alsoneed to build alliances. With Nicci and Nathan already there in Ildakar, maybethat city can become one of our strongest allies.”Renn nodded sagely. “I hope someday you can visit my city for yourselves, andthen you’ll see that my stories don’t do it justice.”Verna made up her mind. “Yes, we should see it. What is wrong with now?” Oliverand Peretta lit up at the suggestion, and young Amber smiled with excitement.Verna continued, “Everything Renn says should inspire us. As Sisters of theLight we seek knowledge. We have to go to Ildakar.”Sisters Rhoda and Eldine looked just as interested in the prospect. The group ofSisters had departed from Tanimura seeking a new purpose for their order nowthat prophecy was gone and the Palace of the Prophets destroyed, and they allhoped to find their calling here in Cliffwall. Long ago, the Sisters had vowedto train and protect young men with the gift, and now all these apprenticesneeded to learn their true potential.Verna nodded firmly to herself. “Yes, we should go to Ildakar and see if we canhelp. Nathan Rahl is a powerful wizard and a former prophet, and Nicci is …Nicci. She was Death’s Mistress.”Renn’s eyebrows shot up; he looked uncomfortable. “I found both of them mostimpressive, but…” He hesitated, scratched his cheek again.“We’re going,” Oliver insisted, touching his young companion’s arm, “bothPeretta and I. Nicci and Nathan might need us.”The memmer girl didn’t even glance at him. “Of course we are. We can help findthe path, even though we’ve never gone there before. We’re good at it.”Renn was startled, thinking hard. “It will be a difficult trek back over themountains. We aren’t prepared—”“We’ll be better supplied this time,” Verna said. “General Zimmer can accompanyus with a contingent of his troops, and of course Captain Trevor knows the waynow. It will be a much easier expedition.”Seeing the eager audience in the room, Renn let his shoulders sag. “I supposeI’m ready to go back, too, so long as we have a well-equipped expedition.Couldn’t we rest and recover for just a few more days?”“A few more days,” Verna agreed. “We have plans to make and supplies to pack.We’ll gather whatever maps remain in Cliffwall, so we can find the best route.”She looked forward to seeing the legendary city and to reuniting with Nicci andNathan. In times past, she had chased Nathan all over the land after he escapedfrom the Palace of the Prophets. Before that she had spent years searching forRichard Rahl, knowing that a new war wizard had been born in the world. A tripfrom Cliffwall to Ildakar didn’t seem like such an arduous journey. In fact,Verna felt confident.She looked around the room, sensing the excitement among the scholars. Shenodded at Renn. “We will all go see this city of wizards.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 33 [contents.xhtml#c_ch33]As he led his hundred handpicked soldiers into the hills beyond Ildakar, FirstCommander Enoch thought of the early days when he had marched with GeneralUtros. They had carried Iron Fang’s banner, but every soldier knew they werereally fighting for Utros. The imperial palace in Orogang was far away, andEmperor Kurgan had little bearing on their lives. Utros, though, was always withthem.Enoch had met the emperor only once, at a military gala with bright pennants andbold fanfares. General Utros had vowed to make the unruly lands bow to IronFang, and Enoch had promised to help his commander succeed. He and his loyal menwould give their sweat, their strength, their skill, and even their lives tomake that happen.During that brief celebration, Enoch had not been impressed with Kurgan as aperson. The emperor valued affectations—gaudy clothes, jewels, andmonuments—more than leading his people. Enoch had wondered how such a man couldrule the lands Utros intended to conquer for him, but the first commander wouldfollow the orders of his general, one mission at a time.Such as this one.Utros told him the vital resource his sorceresses required to create a lens thatcould see through the veil to the underworld. The very thought sent a chill downEnoch’s spine. He had listened and nodded, but offered no opinion. His teamwould obtain what Ava and Ruva needed, as his general ordered.Now Enoch and a hundred soldiers moved at a steady pace through the forestedhills to the north. Because the half-petrified warriors needed neither food,water, nor rest, they could march at a constant pace. They searched theuntracked woods for paths that would lead them to the mountain town of Stravera.Scouting parties had already combed the vicinity and ransacked a few isolatedhomes they found, but now Enoch and his company needed to find a large town thatwould have enough children to fulfill the general’s demand.His troops wound through the forest of oak and pine, picking their way among thedeadfall. The company came upon a swath of downed trees on a hillside, deadpines toppled by a windstorm. Such an obstacle would have been an impenetrablebarrier for a normal army, the protruding branches like spears to gut orcastrate an unwary man. But Enoch’s hardened troops simply marched through thedebris, crushing the dry wood into splinters, grinding the deadfall underfoot.The marching soldiers passed into a sparser forest, then climbed a ridge fromwhich they could look back at the hills that enclosed the broad valley. Enoch’sscouts found a clear footpath, and he ordered the soldiers to follow the trailsingle file into the mountains. Soon, the path widened and became a discernibleroad that surely led to a large settlement.As they continued along the road, they spotted a man far ahead, leading an oldnag by a halter rope. The man shaded his eyes to stare at them and seemed unableto understand the presence of so many armed men marching down the road. Pressinghis straw hat to his head, the man ran, yanking on the halter and forcing thestubborn old nag to trot after him.First Commander Enoch nodded to his troops. “That’s the direction we go. Followthat man.”The soldiers marched forward at a brisker pace. Their footfalls becamesynchronized even without a drummer to call them into a formal rhythm. As theycontinued, roads converged in the forested hills, leading to the town.Stravera had several hundred homes, shops, and a smithy near a stream that ranout of the hills. A sawmill had been built on the creek, powered by awaterwheel. The blacksmith’s forge sent smoke into the air. In the center oftown, an open market had tables and stalls displaying fabrics, fruits,vegetables, meats, a wicker basket filled with eggs. Many had abandoned theirhomes and run from the approach of the company, but more than a hundredvillagers stood in the marketplace with makeshift weapons, already alerted bythe man with the old nag. Enoch saw, though, that they posed no threat.He strode up to the nervous but defiant villagers. Behind him, the columnmarched in perfect formation and stopped in place when the first commanderraised his hand. Without speaking, he looked at the people of Stravera, noticingthe hodgepodge of clothing styles, hair colors, pale freckled skin or dark skin.The town was a mix of peoples from many lands.One man with olive skin and blue-black twists of hair seemed to be their leader.He was broad-shouldered and well muscled from a life of hard work. To give hisarms freedom of movement, he had cut the sleeves from his brown shirt. From thesmear of soot on his face and arms, his blunt fingers and dark-stained nails,Enoch suspected he was the town’s blacksmith.“Is this Stravera?” he asked.The villagers held their breath as the blacksmith took a step forward. “Yes,this is the free town we built with our own hands. My name is Garth, and I willspeak for these people today.” His brow was hooded. “Most of our people areslaves who escaped from Ildakar. But you aren’t from Ildakar. Your uniforms, thewhole look of you … you’re from somewhere else.”“I am First Commander Enoch of the army of General Utros. We laid siege to thecity in the name of Emperor Kurgan, to make Ildakar swear allegiance to him.Surely you’ve heard of us?”The people muttered in astonishment.“That was centuries ago. The stone army awakened?” Garth seemed excited. “Irecognize your armor now. Then you’re also enemies of Ildakar, as we are? Thatcity needed to be humbled.” Garth looked to his fellow villagers. “We are nofriends of those people. The nobles enslaved us, tortured us, killed ourfamilies.” He walked forward to greet Enoch, who hadn’t moved. “You awakenedfrom the stone spell, yet you still look pale. How can you move?”“The spell faded enough, and our entire army is ready to bring down the walls ofIldakar.”Garth looked insistent, fighting hard not to show his fear. “We are not yourenemy, none of us. After the shroud dissipated, we built our own sanctuary herein Stravera. We should be allies. I would like nothing more than to see thewizards’ duma and those gifted nobles fall. Perhaps we can help you in thefight?”“We came to Stravera because we needed assistance,” Enoch said. “Over the courseof time, most of our supplies and equipment crumbled into dust, and when weawakened we had nothing left.” He turned slowly, narrowing his eyes as hestudied the stalls, the smithy, the merchant shops. “Stravera has certain thingsthat we require.”Garth gave a nervous nod. “We will help as we can, but we don’t have much.” Heregretted his words the moment he spoke them. “I saw the size of your stone armywhen I ran away from Ildakar. We can’t possibly feed such a force. All thosethousands! We have barely enough—”Enoch raised his hand. “We don’t require your food. What I need—what GeneralUtros needs—are some basic supplies. To start, we could use several wagons,perhaps four.”“That can be done,” Garth said, relieved as he barked orders to the villagers.He was trying hard to be cooperative, anxious about the armed force that couldeasily take whatever they wanted anyway.“And barrels,” Enoch said. “Empty barrels. Six will do.”“We … we have barrels of wine, if you need that. And kegs of beer, brewed righthere in the town.”“No wine or beer. Just the empty barrels. We need them to contain somethingelse.”“Of course, of course.” Garth wiped sweat from his brow. His long blue-blacklocks hung down over his face. “In the name of the spirits, we’ll help you bringfreedom to Ildakar.”Townspeople brought four empty wagons from the stables, and Enoch approved oftheir sturdy wheels. A mule had been hitched to the front of each one. Othervillagers rolled large barrels out into the town square to be loaded into thewagon beds.All this time Enoch’s soldiers hadn’t so much as stirred, as if they had turnedto stone again. They just waited, intimidating by their very presence.Garth couldn’t stop talking. “There may be other ways we can help. We want tosee the walls of Ildakar broken down and the people set free. The slaves areforced to follow the whims of the nobles, but there is great unrest. When Iescaped, a man named Mirrormask was rallying the lower classes. He would be apowerful ally to your cause. I could send word into the city, perhaps trigger anuprising?” He smiled. “Ildakar will fall from within, even as your army breaksdown the walls. It would be an easy victory.”“I shall consider the idea,” Enoch said. “Though that is not the way our generaldefeats an enemy.”By the time the wagons and the empty barrels were ready, Enoch had enough timeto think. The gigantic camp was so squalid because their tents, tools, andsupplies had decayed into nothing. He nodded toward the stream. “I see you havea sawmill. We will need much lumber so we can rebuild our command structures.And fabrics—we’ll take your cloth for tents and banners.” He nodded to himself,remembering that all of their colorful battle flags had long vanished.The townspeople seemed more nervous now, but they couldn’t deny the request. Ina thinner voice, Garth called for the supplies to be brought and loaded in thewagons.“And tools,” Enoch continued. “We have almost nothing. We’ll need mallets, saws,hammers, nails, prybars.”Finally the town leader balked. “Please, First Commander. That would devastateStravera.”“Serving the army of General Utros is not always easy.” He put an edge in hisvoice. These people would be broken one way or another, whether willingly or byforce.“But our future…” Garth pleaded. “I am merely saying it will be hard, by thespirits.” He scratched his thick hair, sweating profusely.“Do you have any children?” Enoch asked.“Children?” Garth seemed surprised by the question. “Why yes, I have two youngsons and a daughter, just a baby.”“Good. Are there many other children in Stravera?”“Any town has children,” the blacksmith replied, growing more suspicious. “Twoinfants born just last week. In our school, twenty children are learning theirnumbers and letters. As slaves, few of us had any education, and we want to makeup for that lack.”“Twenty, that’s good,” Enoch said. “I am especially interested in the babies youmentioned.” Although he didn’t know anything about magic, he suspected thatinfants might have the most potent blood. “We will need all of them. Bring themforth.”The people of Stravera gasped, either not understanding, or not believing.“Your children! Now!” Enoch roared. “Bring all of them. I expect to see twentyand at least three babes.”Now his hundred soldiers marched forward, closing ranks on either side of theirfirst commander. The townspeople began to wail, some tried to slip away. Two ofEnoch’s soldiers grabbed a young woman who attempted to flee. With heavy swords,they cut her down right there, and her bleeding body sprawled in the villagesquare. The townspeople moaned, but when they didn’t move fast enough, Enochbarked, “Kill another one.”Two soldiers grabbed a skinny, long-haired man who struggled and squirmed. Theydidn’t bother to use their weapons this time, but simply broke the man, smashinghim against their hardened knees and snapping his spine, neck, and arms with asuccession of loud cracking noises.The villagers did as they were commanded, and soon a group of confused childrenwere dragged out of homes amid much weeping and begging. The children variedfrom toddlers to young teenagers, many of them shivering. Some wore rags, whileothers dressed in fine clothes likely stolen in their flight from Ildakar.While he waited, Enoch spotted a paddock used for goats. He had his men turn thegoats loose so they could herd the children into the small corral instead. Thethree babies were placed into the arms of young girls, who also huddled insidethe pen.Garth grew more and more upset when he saw the boys and girls locked inside thefence. “Enough! You can’t take everything.”“We won’t take everything,” Enoch said, looking at the adults gathered there indismay. “We don’t need you at all.”The people of Stravera tried to re-form their desperate defensive line, butEnoch gave orders to his soldiers, and the slaughter began. No matter howdetermined the townspeople were, they were no match for one hundred well-trainedwarriors with swords.After more than twenty villagers had been slain, Garth dropped to his knees,raising his hands and demanding to know why. Enoch left him alive until theother villagers were all dead, and then the first commander beheaded him.Inside the corral, the children screamed and wept. Some just stood in shock. Tenguards surrounded the paddock to ensure that none of the boys or girls tried toflee.“Do we need to tie them?” asked one soldier. “They will slow our march if wedrag them through the forest back to camp.”“We don’t need to bring them with us,” Enoch said. He commanded that the sixempty barrels be brought into the corral with the trapped children. “We onlyneed their blood. Six barrels should be enough to hold it all.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The return trip took two days. His men had ransacked Stravera for all thesupplies and equipment they could use. They found many valuable and usefulitems—rope, utensils, nails, knives, nets, leather, and furs. The soldiersemptied Stravera, taking another two wagons to hold it all. They toiled out ofthe mountains, and when the road dwindled to nothing, they cut away fallen treesto clear a more permanent path back to the valley.The caravan finally returned to camp at dusk, crossing the tinder-dry hills. Therustling grasses were crushed under the wagon wheels as the beasts of burdenplodded along. When First Commander Enoch reported to his general, he stoodproud.Utros and the two painted sorceresses stepped outside to meet him. Ava and Ruvasmiled at the sight of the wagon full of stained barrels. The twins touched thewooden staves, looking at the sticky red on their fingertips.“Now we have exactly what we need,” Ruva said."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 34 [contents.xhtml#c_ch34]In the hours before the surprise attack, the Ildakaran fighters gathered in thelower levels near the supply buildings, storehouses, granaries, and the yaxenslaughter yards. High Captain Stuart brought five hundred of his city guard, allwearing chest armor and carrying short swords. Stuart wore a red pauldron on hisshoulder to show his rank, just as his predecessor had done. Hundreds of theearnest arena fighters had no interest in ranks, and there were also countlessvolunteers from the lower classes who had scrounged up weapons and were ready tojoin the unexpected strike against the siege army.From across Ildakar, families pulled swords out of storage, heirlooms that hadnever seen battle, while others carried new-forged weapons produced by theoverworked smithies. Blacksmiths turned out hundreds of iron-headed clubs, hardwooden handles topped with metal spheres and spikes, and the ragtag fightersadopted them quickly. Such blunt, deadly weapons might do better than sharpblades against an enemy with hardened skin, and they required far less training,needing only anger, energy, and an arm to wield them.Nathan joined Nicci near the gates as night began to fall. The dashing wizardwore black travel pants and boots beneath his white robes, as if he couldn’tdecide which identity he preferred, adventurer or wizard. They watched the newIldakaran army congregate.“Dear spirits, it is going to be a fight.” Nathan cocked his eyebrows. “I hopethe duma’s confidence is warranted. It will be a surprise all right, but I’m notcertain about this idea of attacking such a huge army.”“We are only attacking a defined portion of the camp, the large companiesclosest to the walls and against the hills,” Nicci said. “As long as we keep toour goal with a focused strike, cause as much damage as possible, and returnbehind the walls before the rest of the ancient army can rally, we mightsucceed.” She hardened her voice. “I plan to cause plenty of damage of my own.”As they stood together, Nathan responded with a skeptical smile, noting herraggedly shorn hair. “Are you not just doing this out of anger because thesorceresses attacked you?”“I never do anything merely out of anger,” she said. “But anger is a usefulmotivator. I have an enemy. All of Ildakar has an enemy. If General Utrosdefeats this city, then I’m convinced he will move on and threaten the rest ofthe Old World and then D’Hara. Therefore, we have to stop them here. Our goalsalign with the duma’s.”“Indeed they do.” Nathan chuckled. “When dear Richard turned us loose in the OldWorld, I’m not sure this is what he expected.”“The rest is going to depend on General Utros,” Nicci said.Elsa worked her way through the crowd to join them. She wore a distracted,worried look. “I set up several transference runes here in the city, anchorspell-forms that I can use once we get out on the battlefield.” She smiled. “Itshould be quite a surprise.”Hundreds of arena warriors joined the congregating army, well muscled andscantily armored because they liked the freedom of movement. They carriedwhatever weapons they had preferred during their exhibition battles. A group offierce-looking morazeth walked among them, and Nicci was glad they fought on thesame side now. The branded runes would protect the women against magicalattacks, but their main fight would be against Utros’s thousands of hardenedwarriors.Lila followed as Bannon came toward them. He carried one of the iron-tippedcudgels, but his sword also hung at his side. “We’re ready to fight.” He lookedat the ever-growing crowd of armed defenders. “We all are.”Nathan clucked his tongue. “Dear boy, this is not a game. It’s going to be hard,very hard.”“But, we will do it,” Bannon said.“Yes, we will. Let’s go out and fight!” said Timothy, who held a short sword inone hand and an iron-tipped cudgel in the other. “Nobody beat me duringtraining, and no one will beat me during the attack.”A far less enthusiastic Jed and Brock also joined the group, each wearing one ofthe colorful new silk cloaks provided by Lady Olgya. Neither of the brash youngmen seemed like much of a warrior to Nicci.As the darkness deepened, the thousands of troops gathered, restless. Fromoutside the walls, the enemy army could not see any of the preparations. Afterdays of tense silence, Nicci doubted Utros would suspect this surprise move lateat night. They would march out at midnight.As the fighters organized into ranks, they received water and food. They talkedamong themselves, bragging about their prowess, shoring up their own bravery,while some were justifiably nervous. Most had never faced a real battle before.Nicci watched their excitement build as the duma members made their ownpreparations, spoke with High Captain Stuart, surveyed the large numbers ofangry troops. The wizards and sorceresses of Ildakar would unleash the greatestdestructive powers as part of this sortie.She remembered other nights before Jagang’s army would launch full attacks. Hewould let his soldiers get drunk, gamble, go into the pleasure tents and abusethe slave women. Jagang didn’t care what his soldiers did, so long as they wonthe following day.Nicci preferred more discipline. These people were fighting for Ildakar, and shehad advised the duma to carefully time the charge for when their enthusiasm wasat its peak but before impatience and doubts could set in.At midnight, without pounding drums or sounding horns, the wizards removed thelocking spells from the towering main gate. It took four men working together toroll back the enormous crossbar. The duma members gathered, swollen with theirown magic, anger, and maybe too much confidence.Nicci mounted the bay charger that had been provided for her, and she turned inthe saddle, holding the reins. She looked impressive in front of the troops. Theother powerful duma members also rode sturdy horses from Ildakar’s stables, butthe long-isolated city did not have enough mounts for an entire cavalry, onlyfor the commanders of the city guard and wealthy, gifted nobles.The duma members were focused on one another, staring toward the enormous gate,but the aloof council was not good at rallying its people. Nicci knew how vitalthat was, and after a restless moment, she raised her voice. A hush fell overthe thousands of fighters. “We will charge out and attack our enemies. We muststrike hard, cause as much damage as possible, and ransack their camp. This blowwill send them reeling.”Although she didn’t want to alert the enemy army, she couldn’t stop the troopsfrom responding with a resounding cheer. Quentin, Damon, and Oron turned towardher, giving an appreciative nod. Lani and Olgya were also mounted, ready tofight. Only Elsa remained on foot, near Nathan.She drew a deep breath and continued, “Tonight Ildakar fights together, slaves,arena warriors, city guards, gifted nobles. Everyone has a stake in this.” Niccididn’t explain her own reasons or Nathan’s, but she would do her best to lead byexample. The Ildakaran defenders could rebuild their city once they were free.First, General Utros had to be defeated.“Follow us,” Quentin shouted to all of them. “We’ve waited fifteen hundred yearsto fight this enemy.”The soldiers roared their readiness to do battle, “For Ildakar!”The huge gates swung open on titanic hinges, and the army surged like a stormout onto the moonlit battlefield."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 35 [contents.xhtml#c_ch35]The defenders of Ildakar were filled with energy, anger, and a sense ofinvincibility. Finally unleashed, they yelled and ran forward, holding cudgels,swords, spears. They intended to leave General Utros reeling. Riding at theforefront, ready to lash out with their gift, the duma members were confident,full of energy.As planned, the army rushed headlong to the targeted enemy ranks near theboundary hills. The front lines of eager arena warriors and city guards ran out,holding their weapons high and howling at the unsuspecting army camped beyondthe walls. At the forefront, Nicci rode on her bay horse, one slender armupraised. With her uneven blond hair, she looked like a vengeful spirit in thestarlight.Since Elsa had never ridden a horse, much less into battle, she had stubbornlyinsisted her horse be given to a more appropriate fighter. Seeing herreluctance, Nathan also decided to fight on foot. “I’ll stand with you, my dear.We’ll be powerful enough together. Now that I have my gift back, I can defendyou against the rigors of the battlefield.”She looked at him skeptically. “I don’t need your protection, Nathan. Why don’twe fight together, so we can cause twice as much harm to the enemy?”“That sounds like a fine idea.”They were swept along with the tide of fighters.Nathan felt grand, as if marching with Richard Rahl’s army again. In that momenthe had no doubt the united defenders would deal a painful blow to the ancientarmy, yet he was pragmatic enough to know that the feeling would be short-livedas soon as the two forces actually collided.Elsa did not look particularly athletic, but she was resilient and had greatstamina. She kept pace with Nathan as they ran along with the foot soldiers. Hisornate sword was in its scabbard at his side, because he intended to fight as awizard for now. He held his left hand open, fingers cupped, as his magic brewedto a boiling point.Utros’s army had scattered countless campfires up to the dry grassy hills, whichlooked like a swarm of red demonic eyes, each representing hundreds of enemysoldiers. Nathan caught his breath as the sheer numbers began to sink in. “Ihave fought desperate battles before, but never against quite such anoverwhelming force.”“You’ve never fought with me before, Nathan.” Elsa raised her voice against theracket of the charging army. “We will show them how it’s done.”After studying the arrangement of the enemy warriors from the city walls, theduma members had all agreed on targeting their strike against only the companiesencamped on the northern side of the valley. They would hit there.As the Ildakaran defenders rushed into the first clash, the ancient army stirredwith a clatter of weapons and shouted orders. The response of the huge militaryforce was not quite the panic and clamor Nathan had hoped for. Thewell-disciplined enemy soldiers formed ranks, lining up alongside theirsubcommanders to defend their entrenched positions. The alarm spread as criersraced from company to company, informing them of the surprise sortie. Moretorches were lit, and the outcry grew louder.In the distance, Nathan could make out the wooden headquarters where he andNicci had met with Utros, but this unexpected strike would be much closer thanthat, limited to the troops camped nearest the walls.He could see Nicci riding at the lead, summoning a storm. She called downsearing bolts of lightning that exploded among the foremost ranks of the enemy.A second bolt skittered sideways to rip through a line of makeshift tents andhurl ten warriors into the air like chaff caught in a crosswind. Her lightningwas mixed with blue-black spikes as Nicci called upon her Subtractive Magic aswell as more conventional Additive Magic.Alongside her, Oron, Damon, and Quentin also used their gift, summoningcatapults of condensed wind, lashing storm gales so powerful they bowled overlines of Utros’s soldiers in formation.Wild with exuberance, the defenders ran forward. “For Ildakar!”The first lines of the ancient army crowded shoulder-to-shoulder as they made astand, holding their shields, raising antique swords to block the charge.Ildakaran fighters crashed into them, running at full speed and unable to stop.Nathan saw members of the city guard, arena fighters, even Bannon and themorazeth Lila throw themselves into the clash. Sluggish ancient soldiersdefended themselves against the flurry of iron-tipped cudgels. The din eruptedlike an avalanche.“We dare not let ourselves fall behind, my dear,” Nathan called to Elsa,summoning a globe of wizard’s fire in his hand. He held his fire, waiting forNicci and the other duma members to ride ahead so he had a clearer shot. Elsacreated a ball of conventional fire, unable to match a wizard’s power, but herflames would burn just as well.Nathan lobbed his first fireball far over the front ranks of enemy soldiers,careful not to let any of the incinerating fire splash back on Ildakaran forces.The intense magical blaze erupted behind them, engulfing nearly a hundredancient warriors. They screamed and staggered, collapsing into greasy ash.Elsa hurled her own fireball, which exploded behind Nathan’s strike. Her flamescaused less damage than wizard’s fire, but the blast scattered the confusedenemy. Overall, the effect was quite impressive.As he built his attack, Nathan called upon his gift, feeling the Han in his newheart strong within him with remnants of Chief Handler Ivan’s anger. He dislikedfeeling the insidious touch of that other wizard inside him, but he used theanger and darkness to create an even larger ball of wizard’s fire that explodedand drove back hundreds of the ancient warriors.Ildakaran soldiers, furious but undisciplined, spread out as they struck theenemy ranks, like water splashing around rocks in a stream. They fought hundredsof individual opponents and began to crack through the swiftly organized enemyranks.Nicci’s lightning danced across Utros’s defenses, while the other wizardscontinued their magical attacks. Elsa set countless tents alight with her fire,burning lines of enemy soldiers who tried to flee. Nathan found reserves ofenergy inside him, called another ball of wizard’s fire, and blasted dozensmore. Even though each strike drove back entire lines of General Utros’s troops,he knew the Ildakaran sortie couldn’t hope to make more than a dent in theoverall ancient force.Nathan realized he had to think bigger, find a way to cause more substantialdamage, not just a hundred enemies at a time. As the remnants of his wizard’sfire continued to rush through the targeted part of the camp, starting secondaryfires, he realized something that he and Elsa could easily do, and it mightaffect a much larger part of the besieging army. “The hills! The dry hills.” Hegestured toward the brown slopes at the edge of the valley. “It’s a tinderbox!We can start a blaze that will sweep across the army.”She immediately understood. “They’ll never be able to fight it.” Reaching outboth hands, she used her gift to ignite fire there and build it. But while shewas concentrating, a burly enemy soldier lunged forward with a curved sword tocleave her in two.“No!” Nathan shoved with his other hand, making a shield of air that smashed theenemy off his feet and knocked his curved sword away. The warrior crashed to theground, but Nathan was so incensed at the threat to Elsa that he slammed downhard with a fist of air and crushed the enemy’s chest and face.Elsa gasped, thanking Nathan before she threw the next sphere of fire that hadmaterialized in her hand, tossing it as far as she could toward the dry hills.Nathan summoned more wizard’s fire, one ball in each hand, and launched themboth. Blazing, alive with destruction, they arced like comets high into thenight, so bright they illuminated the battlefield below. Elsa’s fireball struckfirst, erupting into a spray of sparks and igniting another swatch of grasses,while Nathan’s more powerful fire impacted higher on the hillside.At first, the enemy soldiers paid little attention to the spreading grass fire,but Nathan was pleased to see the flames catch and build into a conflagration.Blazing curtains raced up the hillside and burned down toward the encamped army.He grinned at her. “Yes, indeed, that was a good idea.”“Follow me, Nathan. I may need your help for something else.” Elsa ran deeperinto the camp, away from the primary fighting. “I have more magic we can use.”He saw where she was going. The ancient army was rapidly growing stronger asmore soldiers from deeper in the camp gathered their weapons and ran toward thefight. Nathan had hoped to hit these separated ranks hard before too manyreinforcements arrived. “Not there. We can’t—”“We will,” she said. “It’s transference magic. Remember, I prepared for this.”Elsa ran with surprising speed, and Nathan couldn’t leave her to fight all byherself. “Whatever you say. We did promise to protect each other.”Elsa reached a large trampled area that had been a section of campsites. Shestudied the ground, as if hunting for something buried there. She extended anindex finger, pointed at the turf, and began to run in a strange, drunkard’scircle.Nathan caught up with her, panting. “What are you doing? How can I help?”“Keep me safe. Don’t let those soldiers attack me until I finish drawing mypattern on the ground.”“What pattern?”“This transference rune.”As she bustled along, Elsa’s extended finger released a thin trail of power likean invisible knife that cut a line on the ground, scribing a complex design. Sheran to and fro, swirling her finger, adding a flourish to the lines in the dirt.“It’s a spell-form,” Nathan cried.“A transference rune,” Elsa said. “I showed you before.”A force of more than two hundred ancient warriors charged toward him and Elsa.He realized that the partially stone warriors seemed not to see well in thedarkness away from the main campfires, but they could surround their targets.Many carried torches, bright firebrands snatched from their own blazes.“Here they come,” Nathan said. “I hope you’ve thought this through.”“Yes, in great detail. I etched the corresponding rune on a cistern in Ildakarthat holds nearly a thousand barrels of water.”Not trying to guess what she meant to do, he summoned more wizard’s fire andbowled over the front ranks of charging soldiers. The fiery explosion wiped outthe first fifteen, but hundreds more came. Needing to give Elsa time, he calledwind and a blast of lightning to delay their attack.“Almost finished, Nathan.” Elsa pointed to her intricate design that covered alarge area on the ground. As the ancient warriors charged forward, Nathan saw heand Elsa would be engulfed at any moment. “Ah, there!” she said.As the soldiers ran into the open area that Elsa had inscribed, she jabbed downat the ground, made a final connecting line that completed the transferencerune, and linked the spell.In that instant, all the water from the distant cistern suddenly occupied whathad been solid ground, and hundreds of charging enemy soldiers found themselvesin a slurry of thin mud and clinging quicksand. Rank after rank tumbled andplunged in up to their waists and shoulders, mired and helpless as if the groundhad swallowed them up.Nathan let out a heavy sigh. “I should never have doubted you, my dear.”Elsa looked at her handiwork, all the enemy soldiers rendered helpless in aninstant, and then glanced back at the hills where the grass fire continued tosurge. “No, Nathan, you shouldn’t have doubted me.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 36 [contents.xhtml#c_ch36]During his training on the Wavewalker, as a naive young man, Bannon had learnedto fight with his sword, prancing across the ship’s deck as Nathan showed himtrue skills. He had never imagined facing such impossible numbers of enemies.Now he did.He ran forward along with hundreds of fighters into the enemy ranks, remindinghimself that they were only targeting a small portion of the huge camp. Itshould be something they could accomplish. These ancient warriors would havebeen extraordinary foes under normal circumstances, but now, to make mattersworse, they were also partially stone.Beside him, Lila didn’t seem intimidated at all. She threw herself into thefight.Utros’s army formed orderly ranks for defense, while the Ildakaran warriors wereindependent and wild, turning any military response into a melee. Through sheermomentum and energy, their first charge crashed into the enemy’s hastily erecteddefenses, shuddering the line. Once the city’s surge broke the front ranks, eachclash came down to single combat.Bannon steeled himself and rushed into the fray, holding his iron-tipped club inone hand and Sturdy in the other. His discolored blade met the downsweep of acurved scimitar, and the ringing impact sent a shock wave down his arm. Hegrunted, but held firm as he swung the iron club in his opposite hand, bashinghis opponent’s chest. The blow did little apparent damage, but it forced thesoldier back two steps. Bannon pressed forward and swung with Sturdy, choppingthe base of his opponent’s neck. The impact felt like an axe hitting solid wood,but the blade cut through even the hardened skin. The enemy toppled to theground.“That was good, boy,” Lila called to him, her lips pulled back in a hard grin.“Now do it a dozen more times, and we’ll make some progress.” With a feral hiss,she leaped forward, wielding an iron club in each hand. The muscles on her barethighs rippled as she sprang, battering and clubbing. She moved from oneopponent to the next, smashing hard. The ancient soldiers reeled, but they keptcoming back.Thorn, Genda, Ricia, and the other morazeth women fought in a cluster, selectingtargets to strike and destroy. The ancient warriors were powerful, but theirstony bodies made them sluggish, while the more nimble morazeth struck,retreated, and struck again, like angry vipers. The women ranged ahead, settingan example for all the arena warriors they had trained.The morazeth were whirlwinds, and Lila glanced over her shoulder as she sprintedahead. “Follow closely, boy! I’ll damage them, and you finish them off.”“I’m trying.” Bannon swung the heavy club in his left hand, breaking the face ofan ancient warrior. His sword arm already ached from hammering enemy soldiers,smashing their armor, damaging their skin.Jed and Brock fought clumsily nearby, shoulder-to-shoulder. Their silk cloaksoffered some protection as enemy soldiers pummeled them, but the bright colorsmade them targets. The two men battled defensively, not seeking targets, justtrying to survive.On the other hand, Timothy was exhilarated. The young yaxen herder had trainedwith a sword in practice sessions, but now seemed much happier with his club,which he swung with reckless glee. The enemy soldiers were startled to encountersuch a wild fighter who also had a chalky, hard complexion like theirs.Leading the more organized city guard, High Captain Stuart bellowed orders. Oneof his guards blew a golden horn, rallying the uniformed soldiers into asingular attack against the forward contingent of the enemy. The crash of theIldakaran guard against ancient soldiers resounded like a thunderclap.In the loud, violent frenzy, Bannon couldn’t keep up with Lila and the morazeth.He spent all his time defending himself against oncoming warriors, thousands ofthem. His sword cut into the breastplate of a bearded soldier, but that did notdeflect the enemy’s charge. As the bearded opponent swung his scimitar for akilling blow, young Timothy sprang in and hammered the man on the back of thehelmet. The enemy soldier grunted and crashed to his knees. Timothy made a “bemy guest” gesture to Bannon, who swung his sword to chop the soldier’s neck.The fighting grew more frenetic on the battlefield, the sounds deafening. Ridingahead on horseback, Nicci and the wizards of Ildakar unleashed magic in volleysof rock-hard wind and slashes of lightning. In a different part of the battle,Nathan and Elsa hurled fireballs, intentionally setting the dry, grassy hillsablaze with strategic fires.Then Bannon saw a tan blur out of the corner of his eye as Mrra darted in. Thepowerful sand panther crashed into an ancient warrior, mauled his hardened skin,then sprang away to attack another, dodging blows from enemy swords. Mrra rakedthe prey with her claws, tearing their armor and doing some damage to theirhardened skin. Her golden feline eyes met Bannon’s for an instant, and then shestreaked off.Jed and Brock fought back-to-back, their faces tense and terrified.Timothy ran in, challenging two large warriors. Foolishly thinking himselfinvincible, he struck right and left with his iron clubs until the two hardenedsoldiers turned on him. They swung their heavy swords and sent Timothy reeling.The cocky grin on his face faltered.“Watch out!” Bannon yelled. “Get away from them.”Instead, Timothy swung his clubs even harder. “For Ildakar!” He smashed the armof one of his opponents. The other soldier struck the yaxen herder from theside, spinning him around. Because his half-petrified skin made him resistant tothe damage, Timothy recovered, but his enemies had the same protection. Frombehind him, a third warrior struck the boy hard with the flat of his blade,stunning him.Bannon fought an enemy of his own. Slashing and pounding, he tried to dispatchthe man quickly so he could help the young scamp, but his opponent was moreskilled than he expected. Bannon needed all of his concentration just to stayalive.Timothy flailed his clubs and kept the three enemies at bay for a moment, untila fourth soldier joined them. They all pressed around the boy, raising swordsand clubs. One carried a massive mace. In a concerted, horrifying effort theypummeled Timothy, and his defenses faltered. A heavy blow from the maceshattered his arm. Even though it was half stone, the bone broke, as did theskin.The ancient soldiers took turns: one hammered Timothy, then stepped back while asecond dealt another blow, and a third drove him to the ground. The yaxen herderwas broken, his shoulder smashed, red and white, like a bleeding statue. Hesobbed, “For Ildakar!”Bannon finally killed his enemy. His lungs burned and his arms trembled from theeffort, but he lurched after the trapped boy. “Timothy!”On his knees, the young yaxen herder could no longer hold his clubs. The fourenemies kept hammering their victim into the bloody mud of the battleground.Bannon arrived too late. More burly soldiers trapped him. In desperation, helooked ahead and saw that Lila and the other morazeth had pulled out of reach,fighting wildly and slaying countless opponents. He shouted for Lila, but theclamor drowned out his words.Jed and Brock were also surrounded, fighting for their lives. As clashescontinued around them, hundreds of one-on-one duels, he saw that many enemywarriors had fallen, but it seemed that half of the Ildakarans lay dead as well.General Utros had roused his army, responding with a vicious counteroffensive.Thousands of reinforcements came from the other side of the valley. TheIldakaran attackers were driven back as the enemy numbers flooded in.Bannon backed closer to Jed and Brock, forced to fight alongside them. He fearedthey didn’t stand a chance. He pushed away the ache and exhaustion andunderstood that this would be his last fight.Remembering Timothy’s defiance in the face of despair, Bannon yelled, “ForIldakar!” He looked at Jed and Brock. They were sweating, terrified, flailingtheir iron-tipped clubs—the same weapons they had used to bash motionlessstatues as a prank. The two young men didn’t echo his battle cry.Feeling his blood boil with the battle rage that sometimes came upon him, Bannonprepared to fight to the last. He yelled again, this time without words as theenemy warriors closed in, and he lost himself in the combat."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 37 [contents.xhtml#c_ch37]The grass fires set by Nathan and Elsa burned out of control. As Nicci attackedwith her own lightning and aggressive storm winds, she watched the flames leapfrom the tall grasses to gnarled live oaks in the hills. The burn line hookeddown toward the rear of General Utros’s camp, spreading faster than any mancould run. The reawakened army had a few hundred tents scattered among thedispersed companies of soldiers. Nicci watched the brush fire catch on thetents, setting them ablaze.The legendary general emerged from his headquarters, bellowing orders as thegrass fires spread and became a greater threat than the Ildakaran attack. Hecommanded thousands of his soldiers to fight the blaze, which threatened toengulf the entire valley. The ancient army had plenty of men to spare, though,so the firefighting efforts didn’t ease the pressure on the Ildakaran defenders.Nicci, feeling drained after drawing on so much of her magic, neverthelesssummoned another wall of lightning. The jagged bolts blasted the ground, hurlingseveral hundred enemy warriors away, trapping them between the fire line and thelightning. Most of the hardened soldiers chose to face the blazing grass,staggering about with their armor and bodies smoking.Nicci unleashed more lightning. She could see that the Ildakaran army was indeedhaving a destructive effect on the segment of the camp they had targeted. Theduma members reveled in the mayhem, but for her it was a bittersweet victory.She knew Utros could recover from whatever damage the Ildakarans did heretonight.The city guard and arena warriors, who fought with conventional weapons, werebeing slaughtered by the hundreds. Utros’s army could lose fighters all day andsuffer no great harm, but these initial Ildakar forces had only a few thousandin the first place.Nicci’s bay charger whinnied, unnerved by the carnage and noise, but she grippedthe reins to steady her mount. Riding next to her, Oron lifted his chin in ahaughty gesture. “How much longer can we sustain this attack? Our people aredying everywhere.”Nicci conjured a whirlwind that spun like a rampaging monster, ripping up ranksof enemy soldiers before she grew too exhausted to sustain it. “I think we’vemade our point.”Following her example, Oron called a storm, icy wind and rain that tumbledacross the vast camp. Nearby, Quentin and Damon conjured similar storms,disrupting the forward charge of five hundred enemy warriors. Olgya sparked fireand drew strands of lightning through the air.The sortie had gone on for nearly two hours, and General Utros and his soldiershad begun to form a full-fledged defense. Massive reinforcements were coming infrom outside the targeted ranks. The duma’s surprise attack had concentrated onthe northern end of the valley, but after the calls to arms, the bulk of GeneralUtros’s army was converging on the main fight. Ildakar’s defenders would have towithdraw soon, or they would be overwhelmed.Also hardened with lingering stone, the sorceress Lani strode into the fray. Shewore no armor, just her pale blue robes. The enemy soldiers recognized her as apowerful, gifted opponent, and four of them ran toward her, shouting, theircurved swords raised. Lani paid them no heed as she prepared her own attack.Nicci destroyed a group of the oncoming warriors with a blast of lightning togive Lani more time, and the other sorceress didn’t even flinch. Instead, sheknelt on the ground, alone, and raised both pale, hard fists. Chantingunintelligible words, she brought her fists down like a blacksmith hammering ananvil.Bright light splashed around her hands, dazzling Nicci, and the resoundingimpact sent a shock wave through the ground. The battlefield lurched like abucking horse. Lani remained on her knees at the center point of her quake,while charging troops were flung to the ground all around her. A jagged fissuresplit the earth, tearing the ground apart.As the shock wave died away, Nicci held on to her horse, impressed by what Lanihad just unleashed, though it had only pushed the hordes back temporarily.Still, a delay was all they needed right now, to give the Ildakaran army achance to return to safety behind the walls. Though she longed to keep fighting,Nicci recognized the great losses they were suffering.“Wizards, duma members!” She amplified her voice with the gift. “We’ve done allwe can. Back to the city walls!” Fanfares sounded from the remnants of the cityguard, and High Captain Stuart shouted to his troops. The morazeth continued tofight as they withdrew, while blood-spattered arena warriors dispatched a fewmore opponents as they fell back.Nicci watched Mrra leap in among the enemy soldiers, wreaking havoc. The bigpanther was still full of energy, but Nicci saw several wounds in herrune-marked pelt. She sent a thought to her sister panther, not sure she wouldget through in the heat of a killing frenzy, but she urged Mrra to retreat, toflee from the spreading grass fires and find a place in the forest where the catcould be safe.Fearing the Ildakarans might slip through their fingers, Utros’s army shouted aneerie battle cry. More soldiers arrived just in time to reinforce the damagedfront ranks. Nicci saw the enemy ranks grow stronger by the minute and knew theIldakarans had little time to get away. She wheeled her horse about and shoutedto Oron, Damon, Olgya, and Quentin. “All of you, use your gift to push themback. We need to buy time for the retreating army.”Not far away, the city of Ildakar was bright in the moonlight. Torches andbraziers burned on the top of the high wall from which a crew of sentrieswatched the battle below. The gifted duma members called their magic again. Oronsummoned a hailstorm that pelted the hardened warriors. Nathan and Elsa hurledfireballs against the swelling hordes of enemy fighters.General Utros was too far away to join the actual fight himself, but Nicci sawhim ordering his soldiers to form a tight line to protect his headquarters and alarge supply wagon from the encroaching grass fires. His twin sorceresses, paleand beautiful in the firelight, conjured their own magic, manipulating winds todivert the fire. Ancient soldiers lined up to form a human barricade, physicallyblocking the flames from reaching the headquarters, the wagon, and a set oflarge barrels. The warriors screamed as the flames rushed upon them, but theystood firm and endured, deflecting the blaze.“Once more, Lani! Shake the ground!” Nicci cried.The half-stone sorceress dropped to her knees again, focused her gift, andproduced an impact that knocked back the enemy army.Taking advantage of any respite, the Ildakaran army retreated toward the city.They had decimated the enemy ranks they had targeted, and they had to escapebefore they, too, were killed. Nathan and Elsa joined them, flinging more firefor good measure. Nicci still found the energy to summon her own wizard’s fire,which she exploded into the nearest line of relentless soldiers.Utros’s army continued to close in.Nathan and Elsa were running, but couldn’t keep up. Nicci rode close on hercharger. “Wizard, take my hand! Join me on horseback.”“Not without Elsa!”“I can’t carry both of you,” Nicci said.Then Damon rode up. “Ride with me, Elsa. You did well tonight. All the dumamembers did.”“Well, then I accept your offer,” Nathan said, swinging up onto the bay chargerbehind Nicci.She yelled a retreat again, but the Ildakaran fighters needed no furtherencouragement. “We’ve made our mark on them tonight, and Utros will know that wecan hurt him.” She allowed herself a hard, personal smile. “We’ll make an evengrander plan for our next attack.”With Nathan situating himself in the saddle behind her, pressing against herback, Nicci drove her horse at a gallop. Elsa mounted behind Damon, and theyrode after. The weary and battered soldiers raced toward the giant open gates.With some relief, Nicci sensed that Mrra had loped away into the wilderness,fleeing the fire and escaping safely.But even with the apparent success of their mission, there were far too few ofthe original fighters returning to Ildakar. Far too few.The enemy army pursued them, giving the survivors a surge of energy. Crowdsflooded through the high gates, and Nicci glanced behind her, wondering how manyIldakaran soldiers would be trapped outside. She didn’t like to abandon thefighters who had followed the duma’s plan and offered to fight for their city,but very few were still out there battling the ancient army. Most of those leftbehind had already fallen in combat. These hundreds rushing through the gateswere all that remained.Nathan leaned close as they galloped through the high gates. When most of thesoldiers had stumbled through, the sentries inside worked the huge wheels,cranking the thick ropes to pull the enormous gates shut. As the gap closed, afew stragglers scrambled in, tripping and sprawling to the cobbled streets. Oneyoung man, bleeding profusely from an arm wound, picked up a woman who hadstumbled, and they limped off to the side and collapsed together. The last ofthe party careered through the closing gap.The immense gate ground shut with a thunderous boom. Shouting workers shiftedcrossbars the size of trees into place just in time as the ponderous Utros armyslammed into the walls. The half-petrified soldiers began their implacablepounding again, like constant thunder.From her mount, Nicci surveyed the exhausted and chattering fighters. Some werejubilant, others moaning in pain, still others shuddering with long-delayedterror. Behind her, Nathan said, “Dear spirits, what a battle that was!”Nicci let out a long breath. “Yes, but we tested them, and we tested ourselves.Ildakar proved its mettle, and we damaged Utros.”She was surprised to see Lila alone. The morazeth looked bedraggled, coveredwith soot and blood, her spiky hair damp with perspiration.Nathan’s breathing hitched. “They hurt us as well, Sorceress. We’ll be a longtime counting our losses.” He paused to look around, and his eyes fixed on Lila,who seemed forlorn. His voice cracked as he pointed out what Nicci should haverealized immediately. “And Bannon is gone.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 38 [contents.xhtml#c_ch38]When he saw only three ships from Captain Kor’s raiding party return to theNorukai islands, King Grieve saw no cause for rejoicing. He’d intended to host acelebratory feast, possibly even serving some of the delicious yaxen meat to thevictorious captains.Instead, he felt anger rise within him. Something had gone terribly wrong.In the previous raid of Renda Bay, the villagers had found new ways to fight,even using a powerful sorceress. The previous captain had been foolish andoverconfident. Chalk had never liked the man, which meant that King Grieve neverliked him, and he returned from Renda Bay with excuses for his failure. AnyNorukai should know not to come back alive from such defeat. Without remorse,Grieve had fed the captain to the serpent god.Kor’s raid, though, with twice as many ships and fighters, should have avengedthat ignominious loss.Now, the cylindrical iron bells tolled a mournful clamor, which the king couldhear even up in the Bastion. Grieve snapped his extended jaws open, feeling thescar tissue along his cut lips. He gnashed his teeth, as if he meant to tear outKor’s throat and grind his spine into dust. Bunching his fists, he clacked theiron plates in his knuckles together.Chalk squatted in front of the fireplace to warm himself by the flames, hunchingforward on the hearth. When the bells rang out, the shaman sprang to his feet.“A sad mission, a terrible mission, my king. Renda Bay!”With growing anger, Grieve left his throne room and climbed the steps to theBastion’s high rooftop so he could watch. Chalk scampered after him.At the second landing above, a door opened and a slave emerged carrying a stackof folded blankets. She took one look at King Grieve’s expression and fled backinto the corridors. Grieve would remember her. He had seen her face, and hewould punish her later. For now, though, Captain Kor would be the one to receivethe brunt of his anger.Out on the windswept rooftop, Grieve strode to the battlements, placed hismassive hands on the pocked stone and gazed down the sheer wall to the narrowprotected harbor, watching the three battered serpent ships pull in from thesea. The vessels looked damaged. One of the midnight-blue sails hung in tatters.The other two sails were also damaged, but had been crudely repaired with widecrisscrossed rope stitches. The extended oars guided the ships past thedangerous rocks, toward the docks.Grieve grumbled something incomprehensible, just a noise to express hisdispleasure. Chalk leaned close, his naked, scarred skin brushing Grieve’smuscled arm. “Renda Bay, Renda Bay!”“Don’t worry about Renda Bay. After this, I will destroy Renda Bay,” saidGrieve, “just as I will destroy those weaklings who failed their mission.”“Maybe,” Chalk said. “Maybe.”Grieve sent a summons for the leaders of the three ships to be brought to him assoon as they docked. It remained to be seen whether Kor had been foolish enoughto come back alive.While the ships were gone, Chalk had experienced exciting, violent dreams. Hehad foreseen Norukai conquests, which he described to his king, though the murkyforetellings were often difficult to comprehend. That was the problem with theshaman’s babbling. Nevertheless, Grieve had come to expect victory for hispeople.Kor’s obvious defeat made the bile rise in his throat. He gripped the roughblock where salt air and harsh weather had scrubbed the stone. Chalk scuttledfrom one overlook to the next, peering down the cliffs to the waves crashingagainst the rocks.Grieve could see the hulking shadows of dozens of other islands in the distance,some of them shrouded in mist. His empire held more than a hundred islands,maybe a thousand—no Norukai king had ever counted—but even those numerousislands weren’t enough. His father, King Stern, had strengthened the Norukai,but his vision for their future had been dim and shortsighted. Grieve had nochoice but to kill him, at Chalk’s insistence.The coastal raids had increased as their fleet of serpent ships grew larger,with many Norukai warriors called upon to prove themselves to their new king.But that was only the beginning. Chalk had premonitions, and Grieve had granddreams. Together, they knew how to implement the future.In some of the raided towns, the Norukai had seen statues of local heroes,revered leaders, military geniuses. The raiders tore them all down, taking joyin destroying them. Someday, though, King Grieve wanted statues built of him,gigantic stone figures so that people would never forget him. He sacrificedregularly to the serpent god, and now the blood of the Norukai race was strong,just as the great sea serpents were strong.Fifteen more warships had been completed in the ten days since Captain Korsailed off on his raid. Other missions had returned to the islands bearingtreasure, slaves, and supplies, along with information about the rest of the OldWorld. Grieve kept careful charts, mapping out the lands yet to conquer.Sometimes he would sit alone and relish the territories, like a starving manconsidering what he would eat first at a banquet.If he was going to conquer the world, he could not allow defeats to shame him.He watched in grim silence as the three battered ships tied up to the piers.Chalk hung over the edge of the Bastion, stretching out his long, skinny arm tograsp at gulls that circled halfway down the wall. Grieve grabbed his friend’sshoulder, steadied him. “Come Chalk, back to the throne room. I have work to doas king.”“Yes, my Grieve. King Grieve! They’ll all grieve.”“Kor will certainly grieve.” He turned away from the fresh, cold air and stalkedinto the shelter of the Bastion again.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Waiting, the king sat on his imposing throne. More logs had been thrown onto thefire to make it an inferno hot enough to incinerate living victims. Grieve wasconsidering that as punishment. It depended on the excuses Kor made.The glass-walled tank that held Chalk’s pet fish as well as the picked-cleanskull of his father rested on a stone shelf behind the throne. Grieve could turnand look at it if he chose, but now he stared forward as Kor entered the largechamber. Preoccupied with the fish tank, Chalk paid little attention to thetension in the room. He tapped the glass with his finger and watched the littleforms dart away, only to return seconds later.Kor, along with equally sullen-looking Lars and Yorik, plodded into the throneroom. They wore sharkskin vests, and their knives were thrust into the belts attheir waists. They also wore iron manacles, even though the king had notcommanded it. The three men entered alone, without a guard escort.Grieve leaned forward on his blocky throne, feeling the bone spines implanted inhis shoulders. He rested a hand on the iron chain wrapped around his waist. “Ididn’t think you would be foolish enough to return defeated. You would have beenbetter off to cut your own throats.”“Maybe, but we are Norukai, and we are not afraid,” Kor said. “We could havekilled ourselves rather than face your wrath, but that would be stealing fromour king. Only King Grieve has the right to our lives.” He raised his hands,holding up the heavy manacles. “We placed ourselves in chains to surrender toyou. I would rather have you kill me than take the coward’s way out.”He dropped to his knees, as did the other two captains. Tattoos on Kor’s facemimicked the scales of the serpent god, and a sharp implanted tooth poked out ofhis shaved scalp like a tusk. Lars and Yorik also bowed their heads, letting theiron chains rattle on the floor.King Grieve rose from his throne and stepped forward, his boots making loudsounds down the stone steps to the polished floor. He loomed over the kneelingmen.Chalk skidded over, abandoning his fish tank. He pranced a weaving path,circling Kor, then Lars and Yorik. “Grieve! You’ll all grieve!”The three defeated captains remained submissive, their heads bowed. “You maykill us now,” Kor said. His shoulder muscles bunched, and the tendons in hisneck stood out.“I decide how and when to take your lives!” Grieve bellowed. “First, make meunderstand how a small village like Renda Bay could defeat the Norukai not once,but twice! Did they have another sorceress?”“They had defenses and an army, King Grieve. Since the previous raid, they havebuilt up fortifications in preparation for our return.”Grieve snorted. “No one can prepare for the fury of the Norukai.”“They were … good warriors,” Lars said, sounding ashamed.“And you were not? The Norukai weren’t sufficient?”“They had warships of their own,” Kor said. “Siege defenses at the mouth of theharbor, and a great many armed soldiers. They weren’t just fishermen.”Grieve flashed a glare at Chalk. “You said we would take over the world! And onefishing village manages to stand against us?”Chalk was oblivious to the king’s rage. “Don’t worry about one fishing village,my Grieve. It’s insignificant. Just a village.”“If they defeated us, they are not insignificant.”“They are, they are!” Chalk said, standing behind Kor. “Not important!”Grieve glowered at the still-hunched captains. “We’ll launch a dozen serpentships … no, twenty. We’ll send our might north and crush Renda Bay, punish themfor the shame they brought upon the Norukai.”“No, no!” Chalk shouted. “I dreamed it. Not Renda Bay.”King Grieve quelled his anger, surprised at his shaman’s outburst. Kor, Lars,and Yorik continued to stare at the floor, exposing their necks and waiting forGrieve’s heavy blade to strike the heads from their shoulders.The king glowered at Chalk. “Are you saying I’ll never take Renda Bay? That Ishould ignore them and let them have their victory?”“It’s not a victory. It doesn’t matter.” The pale man rushed up to the king andstared at him. His lips sagged, lumpy with scars, but his eyes were earnest. “Weneed the cities. Big cities! That’s where your victories must be. Listen to me,my Grieve, King Grieve. We’ll all grieve!” He ran over to the fireplace andstared into the flames.Grieve waited in awkward silence, and the humiliated captains didn’t move.The shaman reached his hands into the fireplace until his fingers nearly graspedthe fire. “I see it. The cities, the Old World, the whole continent!” He turnedback toward the throne and shook his head. Drool came from the mangled corner ofhis mouth. “Not a little fishing village, my Grieve. You must go to Ildakar.Send all your ships. Conquer that city. Ildakar should be your capital.”Grieve considered. “Ildakar would make a fitting capital.”Captain Kor finally raised his head. “Yes, it would, my king. I offer noexcuses. I meant to capture the people and burn Renda Bay to the ground, but itwas only a gesture. They have just a handful of people in fishing boats, butIldakar is one of the grandest cities on the continent. It is a fitting placefrom which to rule a vast Norukai empire.”Grieve sneered at him. “You couldn’t even take a fishing village, and you meanto conquer Ildakar?”“Not just Ildakar,” Chalk said, frenetic with energy. “All cities, many cities!Big cities, old cities. I know their names. I’ve seen them in my dreams.Serrimundi, Larrikan Shores, Tanimura, Skald’s Keep, Effren … so many more, mythoughts are dizzy. You must conquer them all, King Grieve.”The king wrestled with his need to punish these weaklings. Kor continued to lookup at him, not pleading. His expression was strong and fierce, enhanced by thehideous scarification. “Listen to your shaman, my king. Ildakar is a worthycenter of your empire. I’ve given you all the information I can report. Use itwisely.” He bowed his head again. “Our lives are yours to take.”Grieve stewed, wanting to lash out to demonstrate his power over these captains.He was tempted to seize all their crew and feed them one at a time to pools ofrazorfish. He gnashed his teeth again, knowing that now was not the time tosacrifice so many warriors. But he could not doubt his shaman.The Norukai were restless, and with their many wives, they had given birth tonumerous children, a whole new generation of warriors that needed a continent toconquer. And King Grieve would deliver it.He stepped over to the glass-walled tank, from which his father’s eyeless skullstared out of the murky water where the fish swam. He could be vengeful, or hecould be strategic. From his maps, he envisioned the path of his conquest, howonce he took Ildakar, the Norukai could spread up the Killraven River, theninland over the mountains, while more naval attacks struck the major cities onthe coast. They could conquer the entire continent, and then the Norukai wouldno longer need to raid and pillage. No matter how glorious they were, raiderswere nothing more than violent scavengers. King Grieve wanted an empire of hisown.He turned back to the three captains. “Your lives are mine, and I command yourexecution.”The Norukai men sagged, but braced themselves.Grieve continued, “But I will be the one to decide the time of yourexecution—especially you, Captain Kor. You are the greatest failure.” He crossedhis meaty arms over his chest. “Look at me!” All three captains turned theirfaces up. “Kor, I command your execution on the battlefield. I want you to leadstrikes up the coast, ignore Renda Bay for now, as my shaman insists.” Hegrunted with displeasure, but he would listen to Chalk. Chalk had never let himdown.“Take ten ships and the maps I will give you. Attack and plunder LarrikanShores, Skald’s Keep, anywhere you encounter, and if you do not fall in battlein those places, then I command you to attack Serrimundi. If you conquer thatcity without being killed, then move on to another city and another.” Grieveleaned forward, lowering his voice. “You can delay your execution as long as youlike, if you continue to be victorious.”Kor seemed stunned, as if he couldn’t believe his fortune. “I will die as youcommand, my king. I’ll do my best to die on the last day of the last battle,after the final city in the Old World has fallen to you.”Grieve stepped to the other two captains, who continued to avert their gaze.“Lars, you will do the same. Take ten ships of your own. You bear the same deathsentence for the disgrace you have brought upon the Norukai. I command you todie fighting in my war of conquest for the Old World.”Finally, he stepped over to Yorik, lifted his foot, planted it on the man’schest, and shoved hard, knocking him backward so that he sprawled to the floor.Chalk danced about with glee. “Yes, yes, it was in my dream! You knew, KingGrieve, my Grieve! You knew.”“The serpent god must be appeased,” Grieve said. “There are other prices we needto pay for the strength of our race. Yorik, the serpent god will drink yourblood, even though it is contaminated by failure and cowardice. You’ll be thesacrifice for us.”Yorik closed his eyes, and lifted his arms, lying on his back on the floor. “Iwill gladly embrace the serpent god.”King Grieve bellowed for warriors to rush into the Bastion’s throne room, wherethey seized the unresisting Yorik, keeping him in his manacles while a smith wascalled to strike the chains from Kor and Lars, so they could prepare to die inbattle."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 39 [contents.xhtml#c_ch39]After miserable days of fighting through awful swamps and monstrous creatures,Maxim finally saw the thornbushes and razor grasses open into a normal marsh. Itwas still an unpleasant wilderness, but he was relieved to face a natural hazardrather than a predatory and malicious obstacle. Small wonder that no enemy hadever attempted to strike Ildakar from the direction of the swamps, although hehad never envisioned that those defenses might hinder his own escape.At least he had left the persistent Adessa far behind.He was sore and hungry, and perspiration clung like grease to his skin. His finegarments, the stylish pantaloons and silk shirt open at the chest, had beenthrough rough conditions. He had used his gift repeatedly to dispel the grimeand freshen his clothes, but the rigors of the swamp now resisted even hispowers of magic. How he longed for a pleasure party again in the grand villa!So many centuries ago, he had given everything for the glory of his city, toprotect it. He and Sovrena Thora were the heart and soul of Ildakar, but he hadcome to despise the wealth and obliviousness of the nobles. Endless ennui woulddo that to people. While sealed beneath the shroud of eternity, the society hadrotted. Maxim recognized that, while Thora had merely grown blind to what wasgoing on. It was only one of the reasons he had come to hate her.Originally, Thora had been fresh and desirable, like his beautiful city, butlike a fish left too long out in the sun, both had grown foul. Maxim had devotedmuch of the last century to planning how to tear down Ildakar. The people woulddestroy their own lives and their homes. It was so delicious!He merely dabbled to amuse himself in the endless days, and he hadn’t knownexactly how to bring his plans to fruition, until the great shroud faltered, asmagic itself weakened and then abruptly changed. Ildakar had been thrust backinto the normal world, stripped of its protective barrier. The wizards had beenable to erect the shroud again and again, through extensive bloodworkings, butit wouldn’t last.That taste of freedom and the outside world after fifteen long centuries hadconvinced Maxim to finally set the wheels in motion. Ildakar was doomed, and therevolt was inevitable. The downtrodden people needed to cling to hope and wereso easily manipulated, like a cart loaded with boulders tilted downhill. Maximsimply provided the nudge, and let the slope and the weight of their oppressiondrive the city to its inevitable crash.Maxim relished the thought of starting anew, creating another legendary city, aperfect society under his own terms. Once he found a new home, Maxim would bewizard commander again, without the shrewish Thora, but he hadn’t really thoughtit through.As he splashed along through the mud and grasses, he plucked at his garments,releasing more of the gift to freshen the color and dispel his unwashed bodyodor. His once neatly trimmed goatee had grown out and the stubble on his cheekswas long and scratchy. Bugs hummed around him, thirsty for his blood, and heused more of his gift to dispel them. It was exhausting and annoying.With no trail to follow, he kept to hummocks of grass, working his way throughreeds taller than his head. He easily vanished among them. He was surprised tofind a path of trampled grasses on solid ground, a trail perhaps made by swampboars or deer, but the path widened as he walked along. The reeds were too highfor him to see far ahead, but the narrow streams led to larger pools of waterwhere fish jumped—and he found baskets tied with cords and weighted down in thewater. Animal traps of some kind? He saw footprints in the mud on the path.He paused, wondering if these were Adessa’s footprints, but he hadn’t seen themorazeth leader in days, and he was sure he had lost her. No, this was somethingelse, maybe a real settlement with dry homes and good food.Maxim followed the trail through the reeds until it became an actual footpath,joining other paths leading from the scattered fishing ponds. Abruptly, thereeds opened up, giving him a view of the Killraven River, a calm oxbow on whichstood a village of more than fifty reed huts, some structures extending out onstilts, with smaller huts built in the marshes. He saw racks of gutted fishangled over smoky fires, and his stomach grumbled with hunger. Villagers wentabout their daily business. Some took canoes through the waterways, while largerboats ventured out of the calm oxbow into the river’s main current.Seeing the settlement, Maxim felt true joy, not just at the thought of warmfood, clean clothes, and a dry place to sleep. This was a real town with a fairnumber of people, and he needed people if he was ever going to build a new cityfor himself.Maxim counted more than a hundred men, women, and even rambunctious children.Fishermen in canoes dumped their catch on wooden docks, while half-nakedvillagers sat on reed mats at the shore to gut the fish and cut the heads off,separating the meat and the offal into different buckets. Old women tended smokyfires to preserve the fish. Teenagers clustered together weaving reeds and marshgrasses into baskets, while groups of women pounded the reed fiber and twistedit into twine, with which they wove and strung nets. Women and men came in fromforaging in the marshlands, carrying sacks of spiny seedpods or muddy tubersthey’d pulled up from the soft ground. Small children lay on paddleboards in themud near the shore, using little nets to scoop up crayfish, which they dumpedinto pots.Maxim was pleased to see his new village thriving. Cleaning any last smears ofmud off his face, grooming his dark hair, which had grown longer than hepreferred, he walked out of the marsh. With the power of his gift, he could makethese villagers think positively of him, see him as their new leader, believeevery statement he made.He’d used that power long ago to enchant Thora into becoming his lover. He’dbeen ready to give anything for her! He had wanted her so badly. By the Keeper’scrotch, if only he could go back and tell himself not to waste the effort. Therehad indeed been some good times in their relationship, maybe a hundred years outof fifteen long centuries, but the best part was that he never needed to seeThora again.He came into view with his arms raised, and as the villagers noticed him, theircasual singsong chatter dropped into silence. They stared at the stranger inwonder and fear.Seeing that he had their attention, Maxim released his gift with a flourish andmade a boom of thunder echo through the cloudless sky. Then he put on abenevolent expression as he stepped forward. “I greet you with kindness. I amMaxim, the wizard commander of Ildakar.” He waited for the name to sink in, andsmiled more broadly as he released his gift, let a tingle of glamour flickerthrough the air, like a blanket smothering their uncertainty. “And I have evenbetter news, because I am now your wizard commander, too! What is the name ofthis village?”“Tarada,” said an old woman at her fishing nets, plucking at the twine andtightening a knot. “We are a simple folk, and we have little. If you’ve come tosteal, you’ll be disappointed.”“I’ve not come to steal,” Maxim said. “You have great potential, and that iswhat matters. Who is your village leader, so I can meet my second-in-command?”A broad-shouldered man in his midforties came forward, not looking happy. He hadshort gray-brown hair and was missing two fingers on his left hand. “I amDanner. I resolve disputes here, but Tarada doesn’t need much more leadershipthan that.”“You have more leadership now. You have a wizard commander.” Maxim released moreglamour, and the people muttered, nodding, displaying uncertain smiles.“We’ve never had a wizard commander before,” Danner said.“Then this is a great day for your village. I’ll help you make changes. You areall my subjects, and we’ll build Tarada into something much greater than it is.You’ve never before dreamed what was within your reach, but I’ll help you makeit happen.” Maxim smiled at all of them, glad that he no longer needed to hidehis face with a mirror mask. These people were already in the palm of his hand.“First I’ll need food, clothing, and a home appropriate to my station.” Hegestured to the town leader, who didn’t yet understand that he no longer had anypower here. “Danner, find me what I need. I’m sure the people will be happy tosort through their possessions and provide the necessary items for their wizardcommander.”He scanned the women in the town, wistful for the beautiful noble ladies at hispleasure parties. When he had left Ildakar in turmoil and fled into thewilderness, he hadn’t considered how long it would be before he had a woman inhis bed again, to lay her down and stroke her, to hear her moan as sheexperienced the pleasure of being the wizard commander’s lover.The women in Tarada seemed plain and washed-out, looking older than their yearsfrom eking out a life with no luxuries. He did see some young ladies stillbarely in their teens. Maybe if they were cleaned up, he might find themattractive, and if Tarada was going to be the start of a new rule for him, hewould have to grant these people at least some small reward. If the womenpleased him, he would return the favor.Men paddled in with their canoes, curious about the stranger that the rest ofthe villagers gathered around. Larger boats returned from the wide river, andMaxim greeted them all. He maintained the calming veil of his gift like a mistthroughout the air. The village was already his, and he merely had to finisharranging the details.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Within several days, thanks to Maxim’s efforts, Tarada entirely changed. Five ofthe smaller huts had been torn down, and the reeds, structural poles, andthatched roofing were used for a much larger building. It certainly wasn’t apalace—anyone in Ildakar would have laughed at the very suggestion—but it didhave a certain amount of grandeur in relation to the rest of the village.Until now, life in Tarada had mostly concentrated on gathering food, and thepeople had succeeded well enough, but Maxim had far greater ambition, and he hadto start his new empire somewhere. Even Ildakar had humble beginnings on theshores of the Killraven River in ages past. Once he established himself inTarada, Maxim might move on to a grander place, maybe one of the bustling townsdownriver. Tarada was a fine start, though, and he was pleased with hisprogress.Danner proved to be quite skilled as his second-in-command. The man knew all thevillagers and resources in Tarada. Under Maxim’s glamour, he threw himselfwholeheartedly into serving the new wizard commander.Maxim chose two young women who were comely enough—one of them Danner’s owndaughter—and took them as his lovers, granting them that extra glow ofimportance. The village girls were inexperienced and unimaginative, butpleasurable, and Maxim could train them, or even try others who might catch hisattention. He didn’t want anyone in Tarada to feel left out. For the first timesince he had abandoned Ildakar, Maxim saw a bright future.Then Adessa arrived.Over the last week, Maxim had prepared for the possibility of her coming andgiven the villagers instructions to sound a warning upon the approach of anystrangers, but Adessa was fast.A fisherwoman came running through the reeds, yelling at the top of her voice,“The morazeth is here! To arms!”Moments later, Maxim emerged from his palatial reed structure to see a haughtyAdessa stride into the village with her weapons drawn and a deadly gleam in hereyes. Under Maxim’s spell, an older fisherman threw himself upon her, attackingwith a boat hook, but Adessa chopped the wooden staff in half, then sliced herknife across his stomach. Not even slowing her pace, she kicked the man aside ashe fell clutching at the ropy entrails spilling out of his stomach. “Maxim, I amhere for your head! On orders from Sovrena Thora.”Knowing she was protected from his magic, Maxim cried out to the people,“Protect me! Stop her!” He used his glamour spell to nudge the villagers whowere already wrapped around his finger.Danner charged forward, lips drawn back in a grimace of anger and disgust. “Wewon’t let you harm our wizard commander!” Two more fishermen joined him.Adessa looked at them as if they were bothersome flies. The villagers clumsilyswung makeshift weapons, as Maxim had known they would. He needed them only fora diversion. They slowed Adessa for a moment, but she cut the legs out fromunder Danner, stabbed the two fishermen, and kept moving forward at herinexorable pace.With a wild shriek, Danner’s young daughter bounded forward and threw a tornfishing net at Adessa, surprising her. The morazeth thrashed, tangling her shortsword in the net, while other howling villagers rushed into the brief opening.The mob struck the morazeth leader with sticks. A young child darted in withgutting knife to stab her rune-marked legs. Adessa kicked him aside and into thewater. More villagers crowded forward with murderous intent, but Adessa slashedherself free from the net.Now the morazeth took the attack seriously. Whirling as if she were in anexhibition for the Ildakaran combat arena, she slew the Taradan villagers asfast as they came within reach of her sword. A few of them managed to landblows, though Adessa ignored the pain. She killed them all, leaving the marshpath and the village littered with severed limbs and decapitated heads.Maxim dispatched more villagers to come running to his defense, well aware thatthe morazeth would surely defeat them all, and as the villagers died, one afteranother, his own tenuous glamour frayed. Terror loosened his hold on thepopulation, and they pulled away.Maxim knew it was time for another tactic. This small fishing village wouldnever have served as the capital of his new empire, he realized. It was just anexperiment, a way-stop on his journey, and it was time for him to use thesupreme power of his gift so he could escape unscathed.His magic would not harm Adessa, but he was clever enough to put it to otheruse. He used his gift on the sluggish waters of the oxbow bend, pulling upon thecurrent.As Adessa hacked her way through the last villagers, Maxim hurled the riverwater in a wide smothering flood over Tarada. The sudden wave washed away hisreed palace and the numerous huts. Adessa braced herself for the crash of thewave.At the same time, Maxim unleashed more magic, triggering a surge of heat thatexploded the curtain of water into hot steam. Searing vapor roared and whistled,scouring the village. Boiling water drenched the people and structures, andswept Adessa away in the hot rush. As more of the river exploded, the entireoxbow was engulfed in impenetrable fog.It gave Maxim the perfect cover to escape. He had already found a boat, which hewould take to the main river. From there, he could get far away."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 40 [contents.xhtml#c_ch40]Left inside her lifeless cell, Thora was tired of waiting. She refused to lether captors determine her fate anymore, and she would not be blocked from thegreat city, her city. Ildakar had discarded her, shoved her into this darkcorner where no one bothered to think about her anymore. Thora had reached herbreaking point.Her own husband had spread his poison, brought the city down upon itself, andthen dashed off, laughing at what he had done. For a long time, Thora had felt asneering indifference toward him, and now when she thought of how he had kissedher and stroked her skin, she felt nauseated.High Captain Avery had been a far superior lover, so attentive, appreciating herfor her beauty, not just her power. In the cell now, thinking of the handsomecaptain, Thora touched her arms, her breasts, let her fingers explore her thighsand between her legs, but what should have been a tingling erotic sensation waslittle more than a numb touch. Her body was more stone than flesh and could nolonger experience pleasure.How she hated Maxim, hated the duma members who had cast this petrificationspell on her, the conspirators who had pronounced her guilty because they didn’tunderstand what she had done for Ildakar. Everything for Ildakar!She felt like the unloved stepchild of her mother city. The leaders dismissedher vision and ignored her powerful magic that had protected them for so manycenturies. Her heart was broken for how her dreams had crumbled.She returned to the doorway of her cell, where the rune-engraved stone blocksprevented her from using magic to escape. Thora ignited a light in her hand andset it afloat. The glowing ball hovered in the air, illuminating the stonewalls. She studied the spiderwebbed fracture pattern where, in her fury atLani’s taunting, she had lashed out and damaged the block with her bare fist.It was just a start. She knew she could do more.Thora had to get out of this cell, had to see her city. No, she needed to escapethis place. Much to her dismay and disgust, Ildakar was no longer her home. Sheunderstood that full well. Nicci and Nathan, the duma, the ungrateful lowerclasses who had revolted against Ildakar and killed her son Amos—they were nolonger her people. No, Ildakar was not her city anymore, no matter how much shehad given to it.She bunched her fist, drew it back, and slammed against the stone above thecracked block. Her knuckles hit so hard that the blow resonated up her arm,sending a shiver of pain up to her shoulder. In a way, she was reassured thatshe could feel it.But she hadn’t managed to crack the next stone. She needed more.Something about Lani’s provocation had triggered the extra power in her. Now,when she thought about her dulled sensations, how she longed to feel the thrillof pleasure in that most intimate of places which was now dead to her, she feltanger again. It grew brighter than the flame that hovered nearby.Ildakar had taken so much from her! Lashing out, Thora struck another resoundingblow against the stone, and this time she felt the block fracture. Before shelet her anger fade, Thora smashed again and again, building it into a wildfrenzy. She recalled how much she had enjoyed pleasure parties, thought of herlover Avery who had been murdered by Mirrormask’s rebels … murdered by her ownhusband!After many repeated blows, Thora felt the damage to her hand, saw blood oozingfrom her chalky skin. If she’d been a normal human, Thora’s fists would havebeen smashed to a bloody pulp. She didn’t relent, but merely ignored the damageso she could keep going.She continued battering the stone until the runes were finally destroyed. Theblocks crumbled, the door sagged on its hinges, and Thora kicked hard againstthe heavy wooden barrier. Iron pins snapped from the hinges, and the crossbarclattered into the corridor. With a groan, the door broke free and crashed tothe floor, leaving the way open for her.Laughing, Thora stepped out of her cell. Once past the protective runes, shefelt her gift swell within her. With an offhand gesture, she flicked a bleedinghand down the hall, igniting all of the torches with magic. Glancing down at hermangled fists, which had begun to scream with pain, she restored herself, sealedthe worst of the injuries. She was the sovrena, intact once more, although shewas unable to drive away the slow permanence of stone that still infused herbody.She was free, and now at last she could do what needed to be done. Ildakar hadforsaken her, but General Utros and his vast army might appreciate Thora’s work,her magic. If she joined forces with him, she could help him overthrow thisbroken Ildakar and destroy the treacherous duma; then she could install herselfas sovrena again and begin to fix things. Yes, that was how she could have hercity back. That was how she could restore her dream, even if it meant she had toforge a terrible alliance with an ancient enemy.She drove away the thought of what Utros and his armies would do to Ildakar oncethey surged through the gates, at least at first. It was for the best in thelong run. She owed nothing to the city anymore, and she would rebuild it fromscratch.Thora knew her way around the dungeon levels. In her years as sovrena, she hadsentenced many traitors to be killed in the combat arena, or she had simply usedthe petrification spell to turn them to stone. But some were sent to thedungeons, where she expected them to learn their lesson. Sometimes, she forgotabout the captives long past the point where they had become contrite, thendesperate, and then insane. After that, they rotted in the cells, leaving onlymoldering piles of bones for the rats to eat. Thora felt no sympathy for thosevictims, nor for her current jailers. She had her own priorities.Freed, she strode along the passageways, searching for a way out into the openair. In a lit antechamber she startled two guards as they played a game withgambling sticks, bidding with stolen gold coins and jewelry. She recognized thetwo men who had treated her with such disrespect. As she strode into theantechamber, they lurched to their feet, astonished. “The sovrena’s escaped!”She called a fist of air that slammed one of the guards against the far wall,and when he was pinned there, she pushed, harder, feeling the delicious thrillas his ribs cracked, and blood poured out of his mouth and nose. She keptpressing, crushing his heart flat, pushing the breastbone all the way againstthe spine.Yelling, the second guard tried to run, and Thora smacked him with her magicjust as he passed through the door, knocking his skull like a melon against thewall. She slowly pressed harder, flattening his skull until his brain oozed outlike pinkish-gray slime down the walls.Moving onward, Thora crashed through doorways, scattering more guards. Someturned to fight, but she dispensed with them quickly. Others fled. She had fullcommand of her gift now, unhindered by protective runes. No one would stop her.When she reached the barred doorway of the dungeon tunnels beneath the bluff,she bent and twisted the metal barricade, then hurled it at two guards who racedforward to stop her.When she finally broke out to the landscaped streets and orchards, Thora pausedto inhale, smelling freedom, smelling Ildakar. It was very late at night, thestreets nearly deserted just before dawn. All the noble mansions were well lit,but she saw no one moving about. Above her, the shattered ruins of thesacrificial pyramid stood like an insult, where Nicci had thwarted the sovrena’splans to raise the shroud of eternity. So much had collapsed on that night.…Thora needed to make changes, but she couldn’t do it while Ildakar stood againsther. No, the city had to be purged. She had to reshape Ildakar so that it couldachieve the glory it deserved. She would use General Utros, the mortal enemy ofIldakar, but Ildakar had become its own enemy. She had to save her city fromitself, and to do that, in order to surrender to Utros, she needed to get pastthe wall. She was sure the enemy camp would accept her.She paused, feeling a chill of second thoughts, dreading how the victoriousenemy soldiers would pillage Ildakar, punish the people for resisting the siege,for turning them to stone. They would destroy much of the splendor— No, shebanished those ideas. In the long term, if it was the only way Thora couldbecome sovrena again, the results would be worth the terrible price.Now that she had escaped, she needed to be careful. Before she could get pastthe main gates, Nicci, Nathan, and the duma members would stand against her, soshe moved quickly, before news of her escape spread.Down in the lower levels of the city, she heard a loud commotion and she sawmany torches and gathering crowds. Something was happening at the main wall, andbeyond the city she could see large fires spreading from the grassy hills downinto the siege encampment.In the chaos, maybe she would have her chance. Thora made her way swiftlythrough the city streets, keeping hidden. She came upon a late-working gardenerwho pushed a small cart filled with night soil, tending the grapevine trellisesfor the vineyards long after dark. With a shovel he scooped his fertilizer intothe plants, then looked up at her. “Good evening, my lady.” Then he recognizedher, reacted with surprise. “Sovrena Thora! I thought you were—”She snapped his neck with a gesture, and he collapsed into the steaming brownload in his cart. She should have felt a flicker of guilt, since he was one ofher subjects, but she didn’t consider any of them her people anymore. They werejust obstacles hindering her escape.As she approached the towering wall, she heard shouts and a clamor of marchingfeet, whinnying horses, the jingle of armor. When she finally came within sightof the tall gates, she watched a battered and disorganized army returning frombattle in the darkest hour before dawn, hundreds of fighters in mismatcheduniforms, armor, and weapons. What had happened? Members of the city guardmarched alongside arena slaves. She even saw several morazeth among them, whichproved to her how much Ildakar had been corrupted. The fabric of her city wasruined!She tried to put the pieces together from what she saw. Had Ildakar launchedsome kind of attack? Had this mismatched group of defenders attempted tochallenge General Utros and his myriad soldiers? The returning fighters lookedbattered, sullen, and they didn’t cheer or whistle as they might with awell-earned victory. Rather, they seemed badly bruised.Then she saw the hated Nicci riding a bay charger with Nathan in the saddlebehind her, trotting alongside Damon, with Elsa behind him. Even Oron, head ofthe skinners’ guild, and Lady Olgya rode with the duma members, as if theybelonged there. Lani strutted about, drunk with her own power. Returningfighters poured through the gate even as it crashed shut behind them.Damon and Quentin extended their hands and worked a barrier spell, the lockingmagic that secured the towering doors. Thora realized she would never escapethat way. All the gates would be likewise sealed. She would have to make it overthe wall somehow and leave these people to their well-deserved fates.Soon after the great gate sealed, she heard the monotonous pounding of Utros’shardened soldiers against the immense walls. Thora herself, just one person, hadsmashed her way out of her cell, and with countless thousands of hard fistsbattering the wall, she knew it had to crumble before long, no matter how manyreinforcement spells the wizards used.But she intended to be on the other side with the victors when the city fell.As the returning Ildakaran army milled around the gate, Nicci was still shoutingcommands from her horse, while other duma members called upon subcommanders forreports. Suddenly, a group of shouting guards ran through the main streets,heading toward the duma members. With a cold trickle of fear, Thora realizedwhat they were saying. “The sovrena has escaped! She smashed her way out of thedungeon.”Thora began to run, darting through back streets and dirty shadows, thenbecoming even bolder as she reached the steps leading to the watchtowers on thewall. After the nighttime attack the sentries would be on high alert, making iteven more difficult to sneak past them. If she used her gift to unleash stormblows or a flare of fire, she could clear a way to the wall. If she climbed tothe top, she could probably even jump and survive the landing with herstone-hardened body. That was her desperate chance. It would not be subtle, andher surprise would last for only a few moments, but it would be enough for herto get away.Throwing aside all caution, Thora ran forward, gambling everything. As she burstinto the well-lit open areas, several nearby soldiers saw her. “Here she is.Sovrena Thora is here!”She knocked them aside with a blast of magic, but didn’t waste time killingthem. Right now, she just needed them out of her way. Clearing a path with bruteforce and magic, she ran to the stone steps that climbed the wall. The resonantbooms of relentless pounding outside echoed through the faint dawn.On the wall above, sentries shouted as they saw her ascending toward them.Several shot arrows at her. Most missed, but two shafts struck her arm,scratched a gouge, then clattered off. A thin line of blood welled up on herskin, but she would heal it later, after she escaped.The uproar increased as more soldiers rushed to capture her. Thora keptclimbing, dismayed again that her own people had turned against her. Below, shesaw powerful duma members ride to the base of the wall, including Nicci andNathan. The sentries above were shouting and the soldiers below rallied, rushingup the stone stairs after her. Thora kept climbing.Nicci dismounted at the base of the wall, her black dress flowing around her.She came after her, like a vengeful storm. “We will stop you, Thora.”Thora put on a burst of speed. Almost there.Reaching the top walkway, she blasted aside the sentries who confronted her,sending three of them over the wall to their deaths. Far below, lined up againstthe thick stones were hundreds of the enemy soldiers. If Thora could drop downthere, she would present herself to them and demand to be taken to GeneralUtros. She could help him bring down Ildakar and restore herself to power. Sheknew the city’s weaknesses.But it was a long way down, and she quailed. Even with her stone skin, shewondered if she would survive the fall. And when she landed, would those angrysoldiers listen to her, or would they just kill her outright because she wasfrom Ildakar? She hesitated as she looked over the edge.Nicci strode toward her across the top of the wall. Her once-long blond hair wasragged and short. Thora lashed out with a blow of wind, much like the one shehad used to hurl Nicci out the high windows of the ruling tower during theirprevious duel.But Nicci was obviously stronger now, and Adessa wasn’t here to help the sovrenafight. Nicci blocked the blast and launched rippling wizard’s fire—which no meresorceress should have been able to use! Thora barely dodged in time, but theedge of the searing flames burned her skin, blackened her garments, remindingher that she could indeed be wounded. She peered over the sheer drop again, notsure she could survive the fall.“You intend to kill yourself, Thora?” Nicci mocked, stepping closer. “If that’syour wish, we can make it happen.”“I mean to save Ildakar!” Thora said. “You’ve all turned against me, and theonly way to save my city is for Utros to win. When you are overthrown, we canrebuild Ildakar the way it should be!”Nicci said, “So you mean to betray your city, just as Maxim did.”“Never! I love Ildakar.” Appalled, she lashed out with a lightning bolt, andNicci blocked it with lightning of her own.Lani climbed up beside Nicci, followed by Nathan, Elsa, and Oron. “So you saidin your cell, but now look at you, Thora. You try to justify your actions, butthey aren’t for the good of Ildakar. You’re only saving yourself.”“I am the sovrena! I am Ildakar. Whatever I do—”Nicci interrupted. “Whatever you do is not for these people. More than athousand of them went out tonight, and hundreds gave their lives to test GeneralUtros. Would they have done that for you?” She lowered her voice, soundingharder and more threatening. “Would you yourself have made that sacrifice forIldakar?”“I would never do anything to harm my city,” Thora said.Damon and Quentin reached the top of the wall, adding their powerful gift to theair as if the magic itself were alive and threatening.“You truly meant to betray us to General Utros?” Elsa asked, shocked andsaddened.Thora’s thoughts spun as she fought to deny it. She looked at Elsa, then Lani.She hated her rival sorceresses, but was it really for the “good of Ildakar” ifshe sold herself to the enemy army? If she allied herself with the very forcethat wanted only to conquer the city?Thora glanced beyond the walls at the hundreds of thousands of fighters gatheredacross the plain, who had once been petrified by the wizards of Ildakar. Theyhad been turned to stone for centuries, taken away from their own time. If shewere to help them break through Ildakar’s defenses, she knew they would exacttheir revenge. There would be fires, destruction, rape, and pillage, asconquering armies always did. How could she let that happen to her city? Howcould she? What was she doing?Thora looked at all the besieging soldiers far below. She didn’t dare aid theenemy. As Nicci and the other duma members closed in, preparing to fight herwith powerful combined magic, she realized it was her last chance to throwherself over the wall. But she couldn’t do it.Instead, she turned to Nicci and the others facing her. “I would never doanything to harm Ildakar,” she insisted, then lowered her voice. “I won’t belike my husband.”She let her hands fall to her sides and bowed in surrender. The wizards cameforward, and she didn’t resist as they bound her."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 41 [contents.xhtml#c_ch41]Bannon couldn’t remember what had happened to him, but the ache of his musclesand his bruised and battered skin gave him a dull awareness. Memories began toreturn, though they remained a blur. Previously, whenever he went into hisblood-maddened state, he didn’t remember what he had done.Nevertheless, against all odds, he was still alive.As he blinked his way back to consciousness, Bannon discovered that he wasconfined inside a wooden shack. Dim morning light filtered through gaps in themismatched boards. When he drew a deep breath, he hissed in involuntary pain. Hehurt everywhere, inside and out. He gingerly touched an egg-sized lump on theback of his head where someone had struck him a hard blow.“He’s finally awake,” said a ragged voice.A second, closer voice sounded forlorn. “Maybe they’ll kill him first, but Iknow they’ll kill us all.”Bannon turned toward the voices and winced. The aching throb turned into louddrumbeats in his skull. He saw Jed and Brock huddled against the wooden wall ofthe shack. They sat on the ground, knees drawn up to their chests. Their brightsilken robes were stained and bloody, their eyes swollen, their faces coveredwith scabs.“You survived, too!” Bannon said. “Where are we?”“In the enemy camp, of course,” Brock said. “Prisoners.”“Keeper’s crotch!” Jed hung his head. “I suppose we should thank you for gettingus captured instead of killed outright.”“He only delayed what’s going to happen,” Brock groaned. “It might have beencleaner to let them kill us out there. At least it would be over with.”Bannon pressed the swelling on the back of his head, felt dried blood in hishair. “I got us captured? How did I do that?” He touched his bruised eye, lookedat the cuts on his arm, and decided not to take a complete inventory of hisinjuries. “I don’t remember anything except fighting the soldiers.”“We knew we were going to die, but you battled like a madman,” Jed said. “I’venever seen anything like it. When you threw yourself on them, something changed.You went berserk.”“I…” Bannon shook his head, which made him grit his teeth from the pain.“Sometimes that happens. I lose myself in a fighting frenzy.”“You saved us, whatever it was,” Jed said. “Brock and I tried to defendourselves, but you—I think you killed a dozen of them before they finally tookyou down. The soldiers said you fought so well, they wanted to show you toGeneral Utros. We surrendered, too. We had no other choice.”Brock added, “These silk robes showed that we are important people. That isprobably why they saved us.”Trying to look outside, Bannon pressed his good eye against a gap in the wallboards. He smelled thick, pungent smoke. In the daylight he saw blackenedhillsides and hundreds of warriors scurrying across the scorched area, puttingout smoldering patches. As his thoughts came back to him, he recalled Lila andthe morazeth fighting and Mrra tearing apart enemy soldiers. He remembered Nicciand the other gifted using wizard’s fire and lightning, while he and thecountless Ildakaran defenders fought with more conventional weapons.“Did we win?” Bannon asked. “Is the rest of the army safe inside the city?”Brock made a rude noise. “We didn’t win. It was never possible we would win. Wekilled plenty of them, and they killed a lot of our army.”“We caused some damage, though,” Jed admitted. “More than Utros expected, Ithink.”The shack’s door flung open and one of the pale soldiers stood there. “I amcommanded to bring you to General Utros. You will come.”Bannon lifted himself to his feet. “Good. I was going to demand to see him.”“He’ll kill us now,” Brock groaned.“The general will question you first,” said the soldier. “Maybe he will kill youafterward. It depends on your answers.”The three captives were marched out into the open, and Bannon shrank from thebright morning light after the rank-smelling shadows of the shack. He saw theenemy soldiers working in the encampment, repairing damage. The hills stillsmoldered, but the conflagration had been stopped. Some of the swift flames hadencroached on the great camp, burning tents and structures. The blaze had evenapproached the general’s headquarters, but a valiant effort had stopped thefire’s progress in time. Ancient soldiers, some singed, glowered at the threeyoung prisoners walking under guard toward the command structure.Though his head throbbed, Bannon dredged up bravery from within. Jed wasphysically shaking, and Brock sniveled. The two noble boys had been so haughtywhen they were with Amos, but now they seemed broken and terrified.Bannon had wanted so badly for them to be his friends, but Nicci often told himhe was naive. He realized that he no longer had Sturdy, which was no surprise,though he didn’t remember being disarmed. The loss of the weapon saddened him,but Bannon feared he was about to lose much more.As the captives approached the rough headquarters, he recognized the legendaryfigure of General Utros. He was a big man, well muscled, wearing a leather vestthat sported a stylized-flame symbol. Utros had a full beard, neatly trimmed,but the left side of his face was scarred from an ancient burn. His skin andhair were grayish white from the stone spell.Two strange, beautiful women emerged from the dark interior of the commandstructure and took places on either side of Utros. They stared at him withpredatory eyes. He realized they must be the sorceresses who had attacked Nicciwith her own hair.Jed and Brock fell behind Bannon as if hiding in his shadow, but he had learneda great deal about bravery. He moved closer to the general without beingencouraged. “My name is Bannon Farmer. I’m a swordsman and a traveler. I came toIldakar with my friends Nicci and Nathan.”Utros remained silent, then gave a respectful nod. “You are an exceptionalfighter. You managed to impress even my invincible army.” He took a step closer.“You are not of Ildakar, then? And you know the sorceress Nicci and the wizardNathan, who came to parley with me?”“Yes, I’m friends with Nicci and Nathan.” He turned to his companions. “Andthese are Jed and Brock, from Ildakar.”The two young men scowled, as if they preferred to remain invisible andunidentified.“I know they are nobles, possibly worth a ransom,” Utros said. “They did nothelp you much during the fight, however.”Jed and Brock looked offended, and Bannon said, “They aren’t fighters.”“Ildakar’s defenders did surprisingly well,” Utros said, in grudgingacknowledgment, “but you cannot win. I have orders from Emperor Kurgan.” Hegazed over Bannon’s shoulder, as if seeing something that wasn’t there; then hisfocus snapped back to Bannon, like a raptor sighting prey. “Those two areuseless, but you fight well, Bannon Farmer. Why not join my army? Be part of thevictory.”Bannon was horrified. “I would never do that. I couldn’t betray my friends.”“We’re not useless,” Brock said. “Even before your stone army woke up, wedestroyed hundreds of your soldiers. That’s more than anyone else in the cityaccomplished.”Utros flipped his attention to the young man behind Bannon, and his stifffeatures twisted in an expression of disgust. “You smashed statues? When we werehelpless?”Jed said defiantly, “We didn’t know you’d ever wake up, but we damagedhundreds.”Brock said, “I wish we had destroyed all of you.”The twin sorceresses whispered in voices that hissed like serpents. Utros said,“Then I change my opinion. You weak nobles caused inexcusable damage.”Bannon squared his shoulders, facing the enemy general. “The people of Ildakarare not helpless. They have many powerful wizards, and Nicci and Nathan are thestrongest of them all. Your siege doesn’t have a chance of succeeding.”One of the painted sorceresses said, “How did Nicci survive our spell thatpossessed her hair?”Bannon flared his nostrils. “We all fought together. I was there. Nathan and Ihelped cut her hair, and she used her own magic to break the bond. They’restronger than you think.”“So are we,” Utros said.Another ancient soldier rushed up to report to the general, interrupting theirconversation. Utros listened to the whispered report, then called two guards.“Take them back into confinement. I will interrogate them further after I finishmy work here.” He turned a steely glare at Jed and Brock. “These two noble boysdeserve painful questioning to reveal everything they know about the innerworkings of Ildakar.”Chalky guards manhandled the three prisoners back toward their shack. As he washerded along, Bannon studied every detail of the camp, hoping to see some chanceof escape."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 42 [contents.xhtml#c_ch42]Nicci had seen the morazeth in action, knew the steel of their bodies, the angerthat pulsed through their veins, but when a battered Lila came to her themorning after the sortie, Nicci saw something she had never expected. Lilalooked defeated.“I failed him,” she said. “I let Bannon down. He is dead because of me.”The hazy sunshine of midday warmed the top of the plateau. Nicci stood outsidethe ruling tower with the shadow of the high structure stretching away from theriver and the sheer bluffs. Drained from the battle the night before, Nicci hadnot allowed herself to consider all the emotional consequences yet. Sheintentionally blocked those feelings and tried to remain analytical. Her heartwas hard, cold … black ice, and she clung to that.“Hundreds of people died last night, not just Bannon,” Nicci said. The more shetried not to think of the young man’s face, his eager smile, his good nature,the more clearly she saw him in her mind.Lila remained unconvinced. “True, many died, but I didn’t fail the rest of them.I did fail Bannon. His training must have been inadequate, and my protectionfaltered. I lost track of him when I fought beside my morazeth sisters, and theenemy soldiers swept in, cutting me off. I didn’t even see him go down, so Idon’t know what happened to him.”Nicci had not seen it either. During the frenzied battle, the arena fighters,city guards, volunteers, and duma members had been on their own. “Bannon was agood fighter,” Nicci said, and then her voice dropped and the words came outbefore she could even think about it. “He was my friend.” Nicci found it strangeto admit the fact, but there was no other word. Bannon Farmer had become morethan just a temporary companion on their journey. “If you failed him, then sodid I. There is nothing we can do to help him now.”The dead were still being counted. Oron had lost his son Brock during thebattle, and Lady Olgya reported with more anger than grief that her boy Jedhadn’t returned either. Nicci could not fully comprehend what a parent felt overthe loss of a child, even worthless and disappointing sons such as Jed andBrock, but then she thought of the girl Thistle, and the heavy ache made herunderstand.“Unless Bannon’s not dead,” Lila said, startling Nicci. “I will not give up hopeuntil I know for certain.”Nicci hardened her heart, not wanting to waste time on unrealistic imaginings.“There is very little chance. You know that.”Lila crossed her arms over the black leather wrap. “Unless you want to surrenderright now, we must cling to hope wherever we find it. All of Ildakar has verylittle chance, but we won’t give up.”Nicci realized the young morazeth was right, and she knew that Richard Rahlwould never simply give up, otherwise he would have surrendered to the ImperialOrder before the first battles. “Hope may be our greatest weapon. Don’t forgetyour hope.” She looked into Lila’s determined eyes. “Thank you for remindingme.”As the morazeth sprinted away, Nicci didn’t ask what the young woman intended todo. Instead, she had her own decisions to make. General Utros and his army wouldbe in turmoil after the attack, but Ildakar itself also rang with speculation,questions, and uncertainties. The defenders had struck a powerful blow, and theduma would revel in what they had accomplished, for a few hours at least.Neither side would be in any shape for a major operation, but only a fool wouldassume the siege would be over soon.Thora was confined again, but in a different dungeon cell. She seemed changednow, as if something fundamental had broken inside her. Nicci still didn’t trusther.The duma members had gone back to their homes to recuperate before they met todiscuss what to do next. When Nicci entered the quiet ruling tower, she foundthe main chamber silent, the thrones vacant and the stone benches unoccupied.The chamber echoed with her footsteps.“Ah, I thought I might find you here, Sorceress,” Nathan said, startling her.She turned to see the wizard in his scuffed robes, his white hair tangled. Shewas surprised he hadn’t cleaned himself and changed his garments since the nightbefore. Nathan had always been vain about his appearance and his comforts, butthe previous night’s battle had shaken him.“I wanted a place where I could contemplate,” she explained.Nathan came closer, his expression drawn. “I know. I grieve for the dear boy,too. It’s a terrible loss.”Nicci didn’t want to admit her own feelings. “There is no time for grieving orfoolish hope. We need to consider our next actions while we have a briefrespite. It might last only a few days.” She glanced at the stairs behind thethrone dais. “Come with me to the top of the tower, where we can get a broaderperspective.”They ascended the spiraling stone steps and emerged onto the open rooftop, wherethe sunshine was bright and carefree larks flitted about. Even from up here, shecould feel and hear the monotonous pounding against the walls.Nicci lowered her voice, though there was no one but Nathan to hear. “It wasn’tenough, and Bannon died to defend a city that wasn’t even his own, on a foolishand arrogant strike that served little purpose. How long can Ildakar withstandthis siege?”Nathan raked his fingers through his long hair in a gesture that reminded her ofRichard. “For as long as we must. I don’t believe any army is invincible.Emperor Jagang and the Imperial Order fell. Sulachan and his undead army weredefeated. General Utros will fall, too.”Nicci listened to the drumbeat of coordinated blows outside the wall. “A drip ofwater will eventually carve a bowl in solid rock. I don’t think we have thatmuch time, and Ildakar is only one target for General Utros.” Together, theylooked across the great valley. The rolling hills on the northern boundary werea blackened scar from the grass fires, and a low pall of smoke hung in the air,but even after the losses they had suffered, the enemy seemed infinite. “Hisarmy could threaten the whole world.”Nathan stretched out his hands, sketched a rectangle in the air, and pulled theair taut to create a new magnifying window. Many of the general’s soldiers wereworking hard to rebuild the camp, but they also saw columns of soldiers,thousands at a time, splitting off in different directions, marching away fromthe valley like separate invasion forces, any one of which could conquer a wholecity.Nicci felt cold inside. Looming grief over Bannon wrapped her like a blanketthat could not warm the black ice of her heart, but Utros posed a far greaterthreat. “If those expeditionary forces are meant to conquer more territory, thenthat ancient general can take over the land that Richard told us to save.” Shelooked at him. “The danger goes well beyond Ildakar. Utros could conquer theentire Old World. And from there, what is to stop him from surging upward intoD’Hara, just like Jagang and the Imperial Order? We have to stop him here.”Nathan stroked his chin where pale stubble had sprouted after the long night.She had never seen him so disheveled. “Now that we’ve shown him our fightingspirit, should we demand to speak with him again? Suggest that it is in his bestinterest not to pursue this war further?”Nicci shook her head. “How could we convince him of that? He has already sentout many armies.”Through Nathan’s magnifying window, they watched a group of the general’sengineers working with tall trees, cutting the wooden trunks into componentsthat included a long throwing arm. Working like bees, they assembled a singlecatapult, which they wheeled close to the towering gates.“Even if they hurl boulders, the reinforcement spells will protect our walls andgates,” Nathan said. “What is he up to?”The sentries on the outer walls sounded an alarm, and the guards bracedthemselves as the catapult moved into position. Nicci narrowed her blue eyes. “Ithink he has something else in mind.”The two watched uneasily as the ancient soldiers cranked their ropes andratcheted back the throwing arm. The catapult hurtled forward until it smackedthe halting block and flung the cargo from its basket. A dozen corpses sailedthrough the air over the high wall and pelted the streets of Ildakar, landing ontiled rooftops and falling into water cisterns. The Ildakaran soldiers who haddied during the nighttime raid. All of the heads had been chopped off, thebodies mutilated.Even as the first rain of corpses fell across the lower levels of the city, theancient warriors wound back the catapult again. Carts came forward, loaded witheven more bodies.Nicci set her jaw. “General Utros is not in a mood to negotiate.”She felt the coldness in her heart, the tingle of both Additive and SubtractiveMagic. This fight was about more than just Ildakar. She knew what she had to do.“All of the Old World and the entire D’Haran Empire must know about this threat.I will make my preparations.” The breezes on top of the tower fluttered herclose-cropped blond hair. “Tomorrow, I intend to use the sliph.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That night, trying to rest before she departed on her swift journey, Nicci againtraveled with Mrra on the outside of the giant camp. The darkness lookeddifferent through the eyes of the sand panther, but she could see thedevastation, smell the acrid char of the burned hills as well as blood from thegreat battle. Mrra had emerged from hiding among the trees in a distant hollow,but now she approached the army of General Utros. The big cat knew the ancientsoldiers had weak night vision, even worse than most humans’, and now sheventured even closer to the camp.Nicci’s thoughts guided the panther as she herself lay restless and half asleepin the grand villa. She was still disturbed by so many losses from the nightbefore.As they recovered throughout the day, the people of Ildakar tried to assess howmuch damage their attack had really inflicted on the enemy, but the mutilatedbodies hurled by the catapults had caused great shock and dismay. The peoplestruggled to find a sense of victory, but they couldn’t help but count their ownfallen, even though they couldn’t identify the mangled corpses. Nicci didn’teven know if Bannon’s body was among them.Through the sand panther, though, Nicci could now see the true damage GeneralUtros had suffered. Many of the blazing fires were not bright campfires, as theIldakarans assumed. Mrra smelled burning flesh, saw the piles of bodies, thecharred skin and blackened bones falling into greasy embers. These were funeralpyres. Though the ancient warriors were hardened from the remnants of the stonespell, they still bled and they still died. Now the corpses burned, although ittook a great deal of firewood.In her partial dream state, Nicci guessed that the number of enemy dead was atleast three to five times as many as Ildakar had lost, but even so it was not acause for celebration.Mrra moved like a shadow in the faint moonlight, circling the troops and funeralpyres, seeing the blasted trenches and the damage done. As she crept close tothe general’s headquarters, Nicci felt her senses heightened, all sounds andsmells intensified tenfold. Mrra sniffed and discovered several large barrelsthat reeked of blood. Nicci didn’t know why General Utros would store casks ofblood, and Mrra didn’t care. Blood did not frighten her.Nicci memorized all the details as Mrra continued to move around the camp,observing even though the big cat didn’t comprehend human warfare. But she hadgleaned enough understanding through her association with her sister pantherthat she noticed something odd, familiar smells that didn’t belong among theancient army.Though unable to approach closer due to the movement of ancient soldiers, Mrraspotted one wooden shack with no windows and a barred door. She heard stirring,low voices, smelled a different scent. Other humans were inside, not thesedusty-smelling ones, but warm-blooded men. Captives, perhaps? Hostages thatUtros would use as bargaining chips?There was certainly no way to rescue them in the midst of the gigantic enemycamp.Before she departed through the sliph the next morning, Nicci would report thenews to the duma. Thanks to her feline spy, she had a great deal of newinformation to share."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 43 [contents.xhtml#c_ch43]Many cities in the Old World had suffered under the Imperial Order, but thethreat of General Utros’s army was something entirely different from what theyhad experienced previously. Now that parts of his army were clearly on the move,Nicci had to spread the warning far and wide. She would travel to Tanimura,Serrimundi, Larrikan Shores, maybe all the way up to Aydindril or the People’sPalace, if the sliph could take her that far. She would tell her story, soundthe alarm, rally them in any way possible.But she needed to have proof. They would not just accept her wild story.The following morning, after Nicci had delivered her report to the duma of whatMrra had seen, and told them her plan to spread the alarm to other cities, Elsajoined her and Nathan outside the ruling tower. She wore clean purple robes, andshe had pinned back her gray-shot hair.The older woman smiled and nodded slowly. “I think I have just the proof youneed, a way you can take the ancient army with you. You can show everyone howgreat a threat Utros is, and they won’t be able to deny it.” She held up a smallpane of glass she had brought with her. “We can use transference magic.”With the sharp point of a dagger, Elsa scratched runes in each corner of theglass rectangle, then inspected her work. “I can transfer the image of what wesee and capture it within the pane. The picture will live inside the glass.”While Nicci and Nathan watched, she lifted the rectangular glass and slowlyturned it, holding it at arm’s length and gazing through it to see the countlesssoldiers, the burned hills, the numerous tents, the immensity of the siege army.Then she touched the scratched rune in the lower left corner and handed thesmall pane to Nicci. “That should convince anyone who looks.”Nicci held the glass, amazed that it had captured the precise image of what theysaw from the tower, an undeniable and frightening record of the great armygathered outside of Ildakar. “Yes, this will help a great deal.” She wrapped theglass pane in a cloth. “Now I have to go to the sliph.”“And we are going along with you,” Nathan said. “In case you need help.”Nicci flashed him a quick, skeptical glance but withheld her comment. As shewalked purposefully down the steep streets with Nathan and Elsa following, shethought of the sliph. “Though I can travel great distances swiftly, I will notbe able to bring any help back with me. Ildakar is still on its own.”Elsa took Nathan’s arm. “We have been on our own for a very long time.” Shelooked confident, even majestic as she walked along. “During so many centuriesbeneath the shroud, I did dream of the outside world. I read the histories ofother cities, mining towns in the mountains, trade centers by the ocean. Theyseemed like magical places, and very few people in Ildakar remembered everseeing them. If I’d known about the sliph and how easy it is to travel, maybe Iwould have explored.” They descended through the merchants’ district and intocrowded residential levels where the lower classes lived. “But I suppose eventhe sliph couldn’t pass through a bubble in time. Our shroud would have beenimpenetrable.”Nicci kept walking at a brisk pace. “That would not have been your primaryproblem. The sliph can only be used by someone with both sides of the gift,Additive and Subtractive Magic. Millennia ago, many wizards could access thatmagic, but now very few can use the Subtractive side.”“Then how are you going to use the sliph now?” Elsa asked.“I was a Sister of the Dark, and I served the Keeper. I can use SubtractiveMagic because of the terrible price I paid.” She thought of the destruction shehad caused, the people she had hurt, how she had tried to destroy Richard.Though she had forsaken that darkness, the scars were still within her, as wasthat poisonous strength. “I will be able to travel.”They reached the lowest levels of Ildakar, and Nicci went directly to the lowstone building that held the hidden sliph well. The door was open and unguarded,but people avoided the place. Though some had peered inside, the eerie darknessand the chill kept them away.Nicci ducked and entered the enclosure, igniting a ball of light to drive awaythe shadows. Elsa and Nathan followed close behind. The air inside smelled likestagnant water and mold, with an undertone of rot. Green moss grew on the stonefloor, but otherwise the chamber was empty, no furniture, no ornaments, nosymbols.Nicci knew how to summon the sliph. She had used the strange method oftransportation before, sometimes uneventfully, while other journeys had turnedinto ordeals. Now she saw no other way to spread her warning so widely and soquickly.Her feet whispered along the smooth floor as she walked to the low circularwell. With all the places the sliph could travel, she considered where to go,how she might best sound the alarm to other cities, whom she could rally. Thepeople across the Old World would have to prepare their defenses, gather forwar. As proof, she had Elsa’s cloth-wrapped rectangle of glass, which shesecured next to one of the daggers at her hip. But she didn’t know if it wouldbe enough.Nicci looked into the bottomless well in front of her, a hollow blackness thatexuded cold and utter silence. “Sliph! Sliph, I summon you. I wish to travel.”When she sensed no response, she shouted louder. “Sliph, I command you toawaken! I wish to travel.” She looked back over her shoulder at Nathan and Elsa.“I will need your help.”“Are you sure the creature is still alive?” Elsa asked.“Oh, I’m certain she lives, although she may have gone dormant after so muchtime,” Nathan said. “They are not natural beings. We must call her again.”“I traveled within the sliph not long ago,” Nicci said. “It’s how we got back tothe People’s Palace in time to fight Sulachan’s hordes.” Determined, she reachedout with her gift, called with her mind and heart as well as with her voice.“Sliph, you know me. I need your services.”The sliph was a woman who had been altered by ancient wizards in preparation fortheir war. She remembered the original sliph, a former whore transformed into amagical creature who existed to carry travelers from destination to destination,deriving great pleasure from doing so.But the other sliph that had rescued Nicci and her companions when they weretrapped within the cliff city of Stroyza was an entirely different creature, onewho remembered her name as Lucy. That sliph had been less passionate, lessdesperate to serve, and far less cooperative, but Richard had convinced her towhisk them all away.Nicci didn’t know which one dwelled here.Nathan and Elsa stood beside her at the cold stones surrounding the well. “Reachout with your gift,” Nicci urged. “Call to her. Ildakar is far from any othersliph well we know, and we need to make her remember this one.”She focused her thoughts, extending lines of magic like a fisherman trolling inthe water. She sent her thoughts into the infinite black well, while Nathan andElsa concentrated hard, straining with everything they had. Nicci shouted in hermind at the same time she shouted aloud. “Sliph!”Finally, a faint, gurgling echo came from far below, like water dripping down avery long pipe. Nicci sensed a churning sound that grew louder and closer, awaterfall charging straight toward them from the depths of the world.Nathan and Elsa recoiled in alarm, and Nicci stepped back from the edge of thelow wall, but stood straight as a turbulent froth of silver roiled up like ageyser about to explode. She didn’t flinch as the quicksilver liquid boiled justto the edge of the well and stopped, perfectly smooth like a razor edge of ice.A shape formed in the mirrorlike surface, rising up until its features sharpenedinto the hard and beautiful form of a woman.This sliph looked different from the original, eager one and the less compliantLucy. This sliph had long locks of hair like molten metal, blank mirror eyes,thin lips that showed no hint of a smile. Her cheekbones were high and her facewas wide. She would have been a beauty in life.“You wish to travel,” the sliph said, a statement rather than a question. Hervoice sounded cold, impatient, certainly not solicitous. “It has been a longtime, but I know no time.”“Yes, I wish to travel,” Nicci said. “I have urgent business. I must go to someof the cities in the Old World to spread news of a war.”The sliph’s expression grew more animated. “I exist to serve the cause. I wascreated to help deliver our faithful spies and saboteurs to fight the wizards ofthe New World. I am disappointed that the war isn’t already won.” She looked atNathan and Elsa. “You all wish to travel? You all serve Sulachan?”“Dear spirits,” Nathan said. “I don’t think—”Nicci quickly held up her hand to silence him. “Is a war ever over? We mustcontinue to fight. If you serve the cause, then you will help me travel.” Sheshot a quick glance at the wizard, who understood the danger of revealing toomuch.“I serve the cause. Once, Emperor Sulachan even traveled within me. I still havehis taste as part of me.” She turned those eerie silver eyes to Nicci. “How willyou taste? You must be within me and I within you, then we will travel.”Troubled, Nathan lowered his voice. “Sorceress, maybe we should reconsider.”“I need to present our report, and quickly.” She faced the sliph. “It is vitalthat I deliver my intelligence. Others are waiting. The cause may depend upon myreport.”“I sacrificed everything for the cause,” the sliph said. “We will travel. Wheredo you wish to go?”Now Nicci was at a loss, because sliphs could go only where they had beenbefore, where a counterpart well existed. After so many centuries, she suspectedthe names of many cities had changed, so how would the sliph know? Getting herwarning to Richard was Nicci’s priority, though. “Do you know the People’sPalace near the Azrith Plain? Or perhaps Aydindril?”“I do not know the People’s Palace, but Aydindril?” the sliph asked. “TheWizard’s Keep? You wish to go into enemy territory? It is too dangerous. I wasnever allowed to go anywhere in the New World. I was only required to go whereour spies and operatives have business.”“Where is the last place you went?” Nathan asked. “Perhaps we know that.”“Tanimura was the farthest boundary, although I delivered many faithful fightersto Serrimundi, Larrikan Shores, Orogang.”Nicci quickly formed her plans. “Tanimura is acceptable.” She knew that cityfrom her time at the Palace of the Prophets, and she would find a way todispatch a message from there to Richard’s capital.“Then come, I will deliver you,” said the sliph. “The mission must not wait. Youwill help us achieve victory against the enemy wizards of the New World.”Nicci didn’t respond, deciding not to tell this sliph that millennia had passed,that the ancient wizard wars were long over, and that Sulachan had beendefeated, not once, but twice.“Be careful, Sorceress,” Nathan warned.She turned to him and Elsa. “I won’t be gone long. Meanwhile, keep looking forways to defend the city.” She flashed a hard smile. “I’d be very displeased if Ireturned from Tanimura only to find Ildakar destroyed.” Nathan chuckled weakly.Nicci faced the sliph. “I’m ready. We must travel.”“You will breathe.” The sliph loomed higher, rising up like a molten sculpture.“Breathe in me and come with me.”The silvery figure enfolded Nicci in a wave of cold liquid metal. The frothboiled all around her, engulfing her, and Nicci fell forward into the well. Thesliph embraced her, pressed harder. In her mind, Nicci heard the command.“Breathe!”She inhaled the silvery essence of the strange being, felt the sliph fill hermouth, her throat, her nose, her lungs. Her heart kept beating, but she wasdrowning.The sliph carried her down and down and far away."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 44 [contents.xhtml#c_ch44]After Nicci was swallowed by the silvery sliph and pulled down into the well,Nathan stared uneasily into the darkness, smelling the metallic dampness in theair. He glanced at Elsa, who was amazed at what had happened.“Perhaps it’s a good thing I am unable to travel in that manner,” she said.Nathan turned back toward the daylight outside, confident in Nicci’s abilities.“I’m sure she will be safe, my dear. But while Nicci is off to save the rest ofthe world, we have the far simpler task of protecting only one city.”Elsa’s full lips turned down in a frown. “I never know when you’re joking,Nathan.”“I insist on looking at difficult challenges from a certain perspective. Ithelps me consider extraordinary solutions, and it’s preferable to wallowing indespair, don’t you agree?”Elsa gave him a wan smile as she followed him out of the enclosure. “My Derekwas always a cheerful person, too. It was infectious.”“Then let me infect you.” He extended his elbow, and Elsa slid her arm throughhis. He could see how beautiful she must have been as a young woman. Hecorrected himself: she was still beautiful now, as well as admirable andintelligent. “Now let us find a weapon powerful enough to destroy the army ofGeneral Utros.”Elsa brushed against him. “That sounds awfully ambitious.”“Since you helped me restore my gift, how can I be anything but ambitious?”Nathan suddenly winced with a flicker of unexpected pain as his thumping hearttripped over a beat. He rubbed his breastbone, feeling the long thin scar there.Elsa looked at him with concern. “Is something wrong?”“Just a bit of indigestion.” He wondered if a faint remnant of Chief HandlerIvan remained within the muscle of his new heart. Before she could pressfurther, he said, “Come along. I have an idea I’d like to show you.”Elsa would undoubtedly be alarmed by what he intended, and his suggestion wasextremely dangerous, but he thought his idea was their best chance to hitGeneral Utros hard.They passed the huge combat arena and the larger noble homes, heading towardFleshmancer Andre’s mansion. Giant sandstone blocks lay strewn about the streetswhere city buildings had been brought down. Workers had cleared some of therubble since the night of the rampant destruction, but debris still clogged afew streets. Stonemasons loaded the broken rock in carts and wheeled them downto the outer wall, where the sentries used them as missiles to pelt the enemywarriors below.Elsa paled as she realized where he was taking her. “This is a terrible reminderof what happened that night. And how you saved me.”Nathan patted her arm. “Saving you from that gigantic Ixax was exactly the rightincentive for me to find my gift again.” He led her up the street. “Just keep anopen mind.”She held his arm more tightly. “For you, I will.”He took her through the piles of rubble, collapsed columns, and fallen walls ofthe fleshmancer’s studio. She looked around in concern. “Do you expect to findsome of Andre’s chemicals or writings still intact? How can they possibly behelpful to us now?”“Not his writings or chemicals.” Smashed stones rattled underfoot as they workedtheir way through the collapsed entryway toward the rear wing. “I believe thesetwo may save Ildakar after all.”He stopped in front of the Ixax warriors.Elsa’s eyes went wide, and she withdrew her arm from his. “You saw what one ofthem did to our city! That thing almost killed both of us.”“Almost, Elsa. Remember that word—‘almost.’” He looked up at the towering brutesthat had once been human. From what Andre had told him, those starry-eyed youngmen hadn’t been coerced to become the Ixax warriors. They had volunteeredthemselves, offering everything to save Ildakar.Elsa appeared nervous as she stared at the colossal warriors. “But the fury theycontain,” she whispered, gesturing toward the rubble all around. “WhenMirrormask awakened only one of them, it killed our most powerful fleshmancerand brought down this entire villa, wrought havoc in the streets of Ildakar,tried to kill both of us.”Nathan turned to look at the pair of motionless warriors. “Remember what Andredid to those poor creatures. He held them frozen here in maddening boredom forcenturies upon centuries. He taunted them, drove them to murderous rage. Butthey still know why they were created. I believe they still have Ildakar intheir hearts.” He lowered his voice. “We just need to help them remember.”With her expression of consternation, Elsa reminded him of Prelate Ann, withwhom he had spent so much time after the two of them had escaped from the Palaceof the Prophets. He had at first resented Ann because she was responsible forholding him prisoner all those centuries. She had been his nemesis, but he’dgradually come to respect her, even love her.He knew that Elsa was special from the start, though. Among all the gifted dumamembers, she had been the most compassionate, the most understanding of hisplight, and she had helped him get his gift back.Elsa made him remember how he had fallen in love with Ann, who was killed bySisters of the Dark in service of Jagang. Before that, he’d been smitten withyoung Clarissa, another romance that ended tragically. Love had left Nathan withmany scars, and by now he should have been embittered by the capriciousness andpain associated with it. But that was the thing about love. It was alwaysaccompanied by hope and the confidence that next time would turn out right.“I have been coming here for days, just talking to them, reading to them,keeping them company. They are quite an attentive audience.”Nathan took a few steps closer to the titans. He raised his voice and spokedirectly to them. “I’ve come to tell you more stories from history, and some ofmy own exploits. I’m sure you are not familiar with the Imperial Order and theEmperor Jagang. Let me tell you what the world has been doing since Ildakarvanished beneath the shroud.”Speaking in a raised voice, he explained about the evil dream walker whotormented and controlled people through their nightmares. “Jagang was a brutishman who enslaved the Sisters of the Dark, including Nicci herself.” He smiled.“Ah, let me tell you about Nicci. So many stories, we could talk for hours.”Nathan stroked his chin and glanced at Elsa. “In fact, I think I will. You’llfind it a welcome diversion.”He sat on a toppled column. “Afterward, I’ll need to tell you about RichardRahl, his D’Haran Empire, and how he defeated not only Darken Rahl, but Jagangas well. He even sealed the veil to the underworld and ended prophecy for alltime.” He chuckled. “I wish dear Richard were here now. He would certainly helpsave Ildakar.”Nathan studied the glowing yellow eyes of the armored warriors. “You both werecreated to do just that, to save Ildakar.” Had the hatred begun to dull? Heseemed to have their attention. “I know how terrible it has been for you to betrapped like this, unable to serve your purpose, but the time may soon come, Ipromise.”Elsa blurted out, joining the conversation as she primly took a seat besideNathan, “I am Elsa, one of the duma members. I just…” She shook her head. “Iwant to say I am sorry for what Andre did to you.” She gestured with her openhand toward their towering forms. “I honor your sacrifice. I am proud of you,and I deeply apologize in the name of Ildakar. Andre is dead now. Please don’thold it against all of us.”The colossal figures remained unable to move, unable to speak. Nathan continuedin a congenial voice. “There’s so much more to tell, and I can keep coming backto entertain and enlighten you. Just before I traveled to the Old World, ourmost recent war was against the resurrected Emperor Sulachan. You might haveheard of him, because he used Ildakar as one of his bases during the wizard warsthree thousand years ago. He led a huge army of half people from the Dark Lands.They surged out of the Third Kingdom to destroy D’Hara.”He mused, his eyes twinkling. “I wish we could have turned you two loose tofight on that battlefield. You’d have smashed thousands of the undead. Just lookat you!” Nathan was sure the blazing light in their eyes was softening. Soon, hemight consider them ready to be unleashed."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 45 [contents.xhtml#c_ch45]From inside the dusty shack where he, Jed, and Brock were held, Bannon listenedto the distant pounding on the walls of Ildakar. He didn’t know how much damagethe ancient warriors were causing, but the monotonous drumbeat would set thecity on edge. Imprisoned here, Bannon had more important things to worry about.“How soon do you think they’ll kill us?” Jed asked. “I expected they wouldtorture us by now.”“Are you in a hurry? Keeper’s crotch!” Brock huddled against the rickety woodenwall.“I don’t think it will be quick,” Jed groaned. “They want to make a spectacle ofus. They’ll probably cut us to pieces in front of the city gates where everyonecan watch.”Brock knotted his fingers together. “My father had no business forcing me tofight like a common foot soldier. I’m a noble!”“You are a captive,” Bannon corrected him, “and your time would be better servedif you considered ways to escape instead of how painful it’ll be when you die.”“Escape?” Brock squawked.Bannon shushed him for his outburst. “Be quiet! The soldiers out there will hearyou.”The young man didn’t lower his voice at all. “Yes, thousands of soldiers! Whocares if they hear us? How are we supposed to fight our way through them?”“Think of some way to break free that does not involve fighting.” Pressing hisface against the wall, Bannon peered through the crack in the boards. It waslate afternoon and the sun had already set behind the mountains. Long shadowscrept across the plain. “Wouldn’t you rather die trying to escape than bemurdered as a showpiece? Remember how you wanted me to die in front of anaudience, for your entertainment?” Bitterness edged his voice. “I’m done withthat.”He turned away from the wall and looked at the other two young men. “I was neveryour slave, yet you and Amos arranged for me to be sent to the combat pits. I amfree now.” He pounded on the wooden wall, and the boards rattled. “Even here,I’m free. And if you want to be free, you’d better start thinking about how wecan get out of here.”He knew that Jed and Brock would be useless. It was going to be up to him.He expected Utros to use them as hostages, hauling the three in front of thegates and threatening to execute them unless the city surrendered. Even thoughJed and Brock were the sons of powerful nobles, he knew they weren’t thatimportant. And Bannon didn’t believe for a minute that Nicci, or even Nathan,would sacrifice Ildakar to save him.“We’ve got to get out of here,” he muttered to himself. Jed and Brock stillweren’t his friends, and he knew who they really were in their hearts, butBannon was better than that. The two young men were human beings and fellowcaptives, and they were all in the same dire situation. He would at least try tohelp.He pressed his eye against the crack, trying to see details in the shadows astwilight fell over the camp. Fires were lit, comrades gathered together. Likesoldiers in every army far from home, they talked and boasted with one another.Some sang, while others gambled. Because of their invincible numbers, thewarriors wouldn’t be overly worried about their prisoners. Only a fool wouldattempt to escape.Bannon had no choice but to do the foolish thing, though. What other option didhe have? He stared through the crack in the shack’s wall and pondered,struggling to find ideas. His heart leaped as he saw a flash of tawny fur justbarely flickering into his view, far from the fires. He spotted the movementagain. Yes, it was Mrra!Two of the ancient warriors walked past, blocking Bannon’s view. The sandpanther ducked into the darkness, and when the chalky-gray soldiers were gone,Bannon couldn’t see her anymore. He whispered through the crack. “Mrra! I’mhere! It’s me.”He didn’t know what the big cat could do to help, but knowing she was out theregave him hope. He rattled the wall boards, testing them. This confinementstructure had been built quickly with makeshift tools and rough-sawn lumber. Theboards had been sunk into the ground, but they were loose. Bannon pushed on themand managed to get his fingers through the crack. Splinters dug into hisknuckles when he pulled.Neither Jed nor Brock bothered to help him. “They’ll probably interrogate usbefore they kill us,” Jed said. “General Utros will want to know all detailsabout Ildakar.”“I’m not going to tell him anything,” Brock said.Bannon kept working at the boards, wiggling the gap wider.“Yes, you will, and you know it,” Jed said. “Once they shatter your knees andpeel off your nails with tongs, you’ll talk. You saw those two sorceresses. Whatif they ignite your fingers like candles, one at a time, until your flesh dripslike wax off your finger bones, down to the knuckle?”Brock began to whimper.Gritting his teeth, Bannon wobbled the board back and forth. He would havedemanded their help, but there wasn’t room for more than one set of handsanyway. He had to do this himself. When the wood creaked, grinding against theadjacent board, Bannon froze at the noise. The gap was wider now, and he couldsee better out into the camp.None of the soldiers paid attention to them. The nearest campfire was at leastsixty feet away, and Bannon saw shadows beyond. That was where Mrra hadvanished. Maybe if he and the other two captives could get out of the shackunseen, they could slip away into the darkness. He had noticed that the ancientsoldiers had difficulty seeing in the darkness, so maybe they had a betterchance than he had at first thought. How he wished he had his sword!Even the slimmest chance was better than no chance at all. As he wiggled theboard, it squeaked again, much looser now. The camp was settling down for thenight, and the moon rose over the hills. He saw the silvery light as adisadvantage, washing away some of their cover.The squeaky board moved more freely now. With a hard shove he could knock itloose and probably fit his body through the gap, when the time was right. Bannonnodded to himself. “We’ll wait until midnight, and then we run.”“We’ll be caught,” Jed said. “And killed.”“Or you can stay here and be killed. I’m trying to help you! Sweet Sea Mother,have you never had to do anything for yourselves in your entire lives?”The two indignant young men didn’t answer.The hours crawled by as he listened to the movement in the camp, the activityslowing. The soldiers did not bed down, because unlike normal men, they didn’tneed to sleep or eat. He wondered if they ever let down their guard. He had tohope so.Gradually, much later, the night grew quieter. He kept staring into thedarkness, searching for Mrra, just to build his confidence. He got ready to makehis move one way or another.He was surprised to see a flicker of gray and black, a shadow that moved andrippled. He realized it was a human figure, a woman covered in a mottled silkcloak the color of shifting shadows. As the figure trotted on light footstepstoward the shack, Bannon pressed the loose board sideways, widening the gap. Sheapproached, using the painted shadows of her silk cloak for cover. Reaching thewall, the cloaked figure pulled back the camouflage.“Lila!” he gasped in a whisper.She held a short sword in her left hand and a full-length sword in her right. Itwas Sturdy! She had retrieved it somehow. “Come, boy. I’ll get you out of here.”He wiggled the board and uprooted it like a rotten tooth. He called over hisshoulder to the other two, “Come on, we’ve got to go now.”“You are insane, farm boy,” said Jed.Brock lunged to his feet. “I’m going to run.”Lila helped pull the board away and set it aside. Bannon thrust his shoulderinto the opening, scraping his chest as he wriggled through the narrow gap. Shegrabbed his arm, and as he emerged, she handed him the sword. “I found this inthe debris outside the camp. I thought you might want it back.”He gripped the leather-wrapped hilt with a shiver of excitement. “Thank you.”Brock worked his way through the gap, making the boards groan with his stockierchest. At his side, Jed pulled on the board, and with a loud snap the woodsplit, creating a greater opening. The sound, though, attracted attention.“Now!” Lila whispered, tugging Bannon’s arm. “We have to go.”Jed stumbled after Brock, and they were all outside the shack. The morazeth wasalready sprinting away, and Bannon followed her, calling to his companions,“Faster!” He could barely see the flickers of Lila beneath her special shadowycloak. The other two ran after, heaving great breaths.Then shouts resounded through the ancient army. “Prisoners escaping!” Soldiersran to the fires, grabbed their weapons and firebrands. Their heavy footfallsthundered louder than their shouts. Three enemy warriors came in from differentdirections to cut off the escape.Lila sprang forward with a hard kick, planting her foot in the center of onesoldier’s chest, knocking him back. More shouts erupted in the night. Torchescame closer as warriors hurried to intercept the captives.Jed and Brock saw the oncoming soldiers and panicked. “They’ll catch us again,”Brock said. “Split up! We’ve got to get away.”“No, we can all fight together,” Bannon shouted. “Follow Lila.”The other two tore off in different directions, dodging the soldiers. Bannonkept up with the morazeth, ready with Sturdy to do as much damage as possible.The sword’s edge was dulled and notched from his fighting during the nighttimebattle. He couldn’t remember his blood frenzy, but knew he must have killeddozens of Utros’s soldiers. He would have to do that again tonight.Hardened warriors closed in from opposite directions, and Bannon’s heart sank.Lila threw off her cloak for greater freedom of movement. “At my side, Bannon.Show me how I taught you to fight.”“But Jed and Brock…” he said.“They’re lost. For now this is my fight and yours.”Two soldiers blocked Lila, and more came from other directions. He and themorazeth would have to battle their way through, but Bannon feared he would becaptured again, and this time they’d have Lila, too.A feline blur crashed into the soldiers from the side, knocking two of themflat. Mrra raked her claws across the face of an ancient warrior, tearing theman’s jaw loose, then sprang away from him to attack another soldier.Lila took advantage of the surprise and pounced on the next fighter, stabbingand hacking with such force that she killed him. Bannon saw his chance, too, andchopped down on the hard armor and stony skin of a fourth opponent. Theirunexpected fury cleared a gap.“Run, boy!” Lila sprang between the fallen soldiers as Mrra continued to attack.The morazeth raced into the shadows toward the charred hills, and Bannon fledafter her, burning all the energy he had left, running for his very life. Mrraknocked down another pursuing soldier and crushed his throat in her jaws. Bannonand Lila ran without looking back, although the young man could think only ofJed and Brock still trapped. Maybe they had gotten away. Maybe …Lila’s voice was rough and raw. “To the wall. There’s a low side door we can useto get back in.”Bannon didn’t waste breath answering her, just kept up.Because they were fleet and the half-petrified army was sluggish, they putdistance between themselves and the rallying enemy forces. When they were safe,Mrra bounded off on her own, heading into the hills, where she could hide. WhenLila slowed her frantic pace to a trot, she flashed Bannon a smile. “I ampleased to see that you survived, boy. It would have been a disappointment to meif you had been killed.”“To me as well.” Bannon felt a rush of relief as they ran toward the high wallsunder the moonlight. He didn’t even criticize her for not using his name.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the clamor died down, General Utros learned that one of the threeprisoners had escaped, although the other two—the weak ones—were recaptured. Hewas disappointed to lose the young swordsman who had so impressed him with hisfighting abilities.First Commander Enoch reported, “They had assistance, General. Someone slippedin and helped them break free.”“And there was a sand panther,” reported another soldier. His armor had beenmangled, and one gray-white arm showed raked furrows from where the claws hadinjured him. “One of the combat animals from the Ildakar arenas.”Utros was not impressed. “And we had hundreds of thousands of soldiers, whosomehow couldn’t stop them.”He ordered the two prisoners to be brought forward among the ranks. The youngmen, both bloodied, were dragged closer, weeping. Their wrists had been broken,intentionally, and they moaned in pain. Their bloodstained silken robes weretattered, and both reeked of urine from soaked patches on their pantaloons.Helpless, they looked at their broken wrists, lifting up their arms in disbeliefto see their hands flop uselessly.“We surrendered,” said Brock. “We won’t try to get away again.”“The problem is, you are worthless to me,” Utros said, “and we have no food forcaptives.”The two young men stood shivering as Utros paced before them. “But you can serveanother purpose. You can pay for the damage you did, the malicious harm youinflicted upon my army when we were helpless.”The captives looked up in pain-fogged confusion.Utros said, “You were so brave when we could not move to defend ourselves or seewho was attacking us. Do you even think about the horrors you have done? Do youunderstand the conditions in which you left some of my loyal soldiers? What youdid was … evil.”Utros issued a command, and shuffling figures were led forward, some of themguided by soldiers, others carried on blankets. The two captives, swimming in asea of their own pain, looked up in horror as the mutilated ones came to facethem. One man’s face was a slab of pounded meat, without a nose or eyes, justripped skin and a smashed mouth. Others had limbs broken off completely, earstorn away, fingers snapped off to leave only chalky, meaty stumps. Several hadno faces at all, and they made wet sucking sounds when they inhaled throughholes in the battered ruins of their heads.“No!” cried Jed.“Behold what you did. These are the mangled ones, but they are my soldiers. Theystill want to fight the enemy.” He glanced from one whimpering captive to theother. The second boy pissed himself again. “You are both helpless now, just asthey were helpless. You mutilated them when they could not fight back. Now, Iwill give them the same opportunity.” Utros turned to the mangled soldiers. “Youcan have them.”The intact warriors stood in a great circle, crowding closer to watch while thetwo young men wept and wailed for mercy.The mangled ones closed in on them and practiced mutilation of their own."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 46 [contents.xhtml#c_ch46]Though the siege of Ildakar would continue for some time, Utros could think onlyabout his beloved Majel, who was separated from him by time and death itself. Healso needed guidance from his emperor, for whom he had sworn to conquer theknown world. Did his orders even still exist?The two sorceresses had given him a new chance, and they were ready.Utros clung with childlike hope to the possibility that he might speak with bothKurgan and Majel again. His loyalty and passion were at odds as much as twowarring armies, but in his rational mind, he compartmentalized those conflictingdesires before they could drive him insane.After the damage from Ildakar’s unexpected attack had been mitigated, hecommanded Ava and Ruva to begin. The twins admired the barrels filled with theblood of innocent children from Stravera. They caressed the staves, pressed downon the intact lids, sensed the red liquid inside and the power it represented.“We have enough, beloved Utros,” Ruva said.Ava added, “But we need the other raw materials to forge the lens, ash and sandto make the glass.”“You shall have everything.” Utros summoned First Commander Enoch. Manpower wasthe one thing he did not lack.In the initial part of the siege, his soldiers had dug great trenches, divertedand dammed the wide streams that rolled across the open plain to feed theaqueducts of Ildakar, although the city could still draw water from the riverbelow. Now, what he needed was not water, but sand from the stream banks. Hismen brought wagonload after wagonload of sand, while the sorceresses cleared aworking area near the headquarters structure.They collected iron taken from Stravera, as well as rusted scraps of armor andthick old chains recovered from the ancient battlefield. Ava and Ruva used theirmagic to heat and shape the metal, forging an enormous basin seven feet across,which they lined with insulating clay, thus creating a huge glassmakingcrucible. They filled the crucible with clean sand from the streambeds, whileanother contingent of soldiers filled a cart with bitter-smelling ash from theburned grasses, as well as coals from the countless campfires.Once the ash was mixed with the sand, Ava and Ruva joined hands and used theirgift to create a constant flow of heat until the material softened, flowed, andmelted. The women took turns stirring their molten mixture for hours.Utros watched impatiently, smelling the acrid tang, studying the silver-whitepool of hot glass. “I can sense the power there,” he said.Ava flashed him a thin smile. The paint covering her cheeks and shoulders hadbegun to flake with the sweat of her effort. “This is merely glass. We haven’tyet made it special.”For half a day, the glass mixture heated, became smoother, purer, until it wasready. Ruva glanced at the barrels filled with innocent blood and responded witha broad smile.Utros watched but offered no advice, asked no questions. His sorceresses knewwhat they were doing. Soldiers carried the stained barrels to the crucible,where heat waves shimmered in the air. Their half-petrified skin was able towithstand the searing temperature.The sisters went to the barrels, caressed the lids. “We’ll need it all, just tobe sure.” When they cracked open the barrels, Utros smelled the change in theair, a sour and portentous coppery tang.Ava and Ruva watched with delight as burly soldiers lifted the barrels to theedge of the crucible with its roiling molten glass. The sorceresses mutteredspells, called upon their gift, shifted the material structure of the mixture.At a signal, the soldiers tilted the kegs and poured the dark red liquid intothe lake of glass. The screech of evaporating burned blood sounded like thewails of countless slain children. The red stain swirled in the molten slurry asAva and Ruva used their gift to churn it like a thick stew of dark magic.When it was done, both women let out a long sigh of relief. “The mixture iscomplete,” Ruva said. “The glass and blood can now become the lens. The innocentspirits have left their mark, and when the lens is finished, the invisibletraces of their former lives will let you see through the veil.”In the back of his mind Utros heard a hint of Majel’s voice, her laughter,whispered endearments she spoke to him after they had enjoyed each other. “Howsoon will it be ready?”“Several steps remain,” Ava said. “We still have to pour and set the glass.”In the dirt outside the command structure, they had fashioned a shallow cratersix feet across. Releasing a trickle of power through the palms of their hands,they had fused the dirt and clay into a hard impenetrable mold. Now, the sistersbroke open the drain in the giant crucible and guided the viscous blood-tintedfluid out, letting it pour into the hardened crater until it became a pool ofsolidifying glass.Utros stood beside the two sorceresses, admiring the molten glass. The substanceshimmered as it wrestled with its heat and its new shape.“Even with our magic, it will take a day to cool, beloved Utros. Then we canperfect its surface, raise up the lens, and activate the final spell.”Utros sighed and pushed back his anticipation. “I’ve waited fifteen centuriesalready, but one more day will seem like an eternity.”The sorceresses stroked the general’s arms, pressing their cold, hard fleshagainst his. “We will help you through it,” Ruva said.“Soon,” Ava whispered. “Soon, you will see through the veil.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next sunset, the clouds over the mountains grew crimson, as if the blood ofchildren had been added to the sky, too. Utros watched, restless, his hearttorn. He was ready to face the spirit of his emperor, ready to see his belovedMajel again.A normal lens of such size would have taken weeks to cool gradually, insulatedand controlled so as to leave no flaws in the glass, but Ava and Ruva guided theprocess themselves, using their gift to stroke the internal crystallinestructure, to calm it as it hardened and stabilized. When they declared theblank lens ready, they knelt over the solidified pond of glass and used theirhands to smooth and shape the outer surface. They fashioned the precise curvethey had seen in their minds when they designed it.When the process was complete, thirty of the general’s strongest soldiersattached ropes, used cloth-wrapped bars, and levered the hardened glass out ofthe crater mold, pulling it upright while the sorceresses formed a frame to holdthe lens like a mirror, six feet high. The women went to opposite sides of theglass blank and worked with their hands, scrubbing, shaping, smoothing, makingthe lens transparent.Utros was fascinated by every detail, but his thoughts were preoccupied withwhat he would say. As part of his long-standing orders from Iron Fang, he hadcontinued the siege on Ildakar, and he had no doubt the city would falleventually, but his mission for his emperor extended beyond Ildakar. He hadpromised to conquer the entire world, and he wouldn’t need all his thousands ofwarriors to maintain the siege here. He had already sent many armies out onimportant expeditions.From his main palace in Orogang, Emperor Kurgan had wanted to rule the OldWorld. It was a fractured continent for the taking, and Utros had taken it. Hehad been shocked, but not surprised, when the emissary Nathan Rahl explainedthat the empire had swiftly fallen apart after Kurgan’s death. The conqueredterritories required firm military control, but Utros did not dream ofadministering an entire continent. His orders were to conquer, not rule.While his awakened army continued the siege, he made plans to recapture thelands that had once fallen under his military fist. Some of his dispatchedarmies would make their way to the coast, some would travel south, others wouldhead into the hills and mountains to the north, or along the Killraven River.They would head as far as they could march, seizing territory in thenear-forgotten name of Emperor Kurgan.As soon as he spoke to his emperor’s spirit, he would report great progress,even after fifteen centuries. If Kurgan could issue orders through the lens andcontinue to rule from the underworld, his empire could endure for eternity, andUtros could feel great satisfaction for having done his duty more thoroughlythan any man in history.But he felt a chill in his heart. Majel’s spirit was also there beyond the veil.Nathan and Nicci had told him that Iron Fang was aware of his wife’s betrayalwith his own general. Did revenge survive fifteen centuries in the underworld?For a spirit, did time pass at all?Utros stood before the blood-tinted lens. He was a brave and determined man, ashistory had shown countless times, but this might be his most unnervingencounter.“Activate it now!” he demanded of Ava and Ruva. “I must see them.”“We need to stay so we can use our gift and make the connection through theveil,” said Ruva, glancing at the uneasy spectators. “But these others…”Ava looked at the nearby soldiers, who were troubled and frightened by theblood-tinted lens. “Yes, Utros. Perhaps privacy is best.”He turned to First Commander Enoch. “Send all troops away, clear the area. Iwill have a private conversation with my emperor.”“Understood, General.” Enoch barked orders, drove off the soldiers, and thenretreated as well, while Utros stepped up to the looming glass disk. He couldshow no fear or hesitation, not to his emperor, not to his soldiers. At leastnow, no one could overhear his words.As the sunset sank into deep twilight, the sorceresses went to opposite sides ofthe lens. The glass gleamed like a moonstone, translucent, showing only shadowsin its interior. Whispering to each other now that they stood alone with thelens, Ava and Ruva reached up to touch the round rim. They sketched designs withtheir fingertips, dipping into the softened crystal and drawing spell-forms thatglowed with orange heat. The designs continued to shimmer as the twins madesuccessive marks, indicating anchor points around the rim.Ava reached upward and clockwise, while Ruva drew downward and in the oppositedirection. They completed ten runes, and each woman finished her last mark atthe same time. The runes continued to blaze as the sorceresses stepped back.Warmth and energy rippled through the glass, making the lens transparent, andthen intensely clear, to show images not of the opposite side, but magnifiedthrough the veil, swirled with hints of a greenish mist.Utros stepped even closer until his face was only inches from the curvedsurface. He peered into the blood-soaked glass and saw shapes there, spirits,shadows, the echoes of countless people, millions of slain, millions who haddied of old age, countless men and women who had lived since the dawn of time.The Keeper had so many in his possession, so many.…Utros longed to find the ones he needed. Moisture formed in his eyes, but hedidn’t want to admit they were tears. “Majel,” he called, glad that no one elsecould hear him. “Where are you? I didn’t leave you. I still want you. We need tospeak.” He would find Majel first, and afterward he could make his formal reportto Iron Fang. His heart demanded satisfaction before his mind did. “Majel, whereare you?”The spirits seemed to hear him through the lens. Shapes were distant andinfinite, but they responded and found the one he sought.Ava and Ruva stood back, barely breathing, but Utros could pay attention only tothe curved glass in front of him. As a figure came forward, he recognized theway she moved. He knew her instantly, because he had given her his heart.“Majel…” He remembered her beauty, her shining eyes, the softness of her skin.As she approached the lens, the greenish mists cleared. “Utros, is it you?” Heknew the voice.But when her image sharpened, Utros could only stare, feeling his heart break.Majel’s face had been stripped away. Moving the raw red muscles of her jaw andher exposed, smashed teeth, she said, “I am here, my love.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 47 [contents.xhtml#c_ch47]After an endless but brief journey immersed in the silvery froth of the sliph,Nicci emerged from a well nearly identical to the one in Ildakar. She couldn’tsee through the quicksilver behind her eyes, inside her mouth and lungs.“Breathe!” the sliph commanded. “Breathe now!”Nicci choked, coughed. She had been engulfed in that otherworldly presence,soaring along, but now that they had arrived at their destination, the sliphejected her. Nicci tumbled over the low wall around the well.She dropped to her knees and sucked in lungfuls of air, tried to assembledetails, remembering where she expected to be. Tanimura! Dry branches, weeds,and twigs snapped under her knees and palms as she moved forward, then climbedback to her feet.She saw an overcast night sky above, crisscrossed with forest branches. Sheheard the whispering sounds of night insects, the cry of a hunting bird, but shesaw no sign of any city. “Where?” she coughed out, and turned to see the form ofthe hard-featured silver woman rising above the mirrored pool.“Tanimura. As you commanded.”Nicci looked around. “This is a forest.”“The forest is outside of Tanimura. Because of our hidden plans in the war, wecould not put the sliph well in the middle of the city where others might findit.” The sliph looked at Nicci as if she were slow-witted. “You can walk to yourrendezvous from here.”Nicci slowly recognized the Hagen Woods, a wilderness on the outskirts ofTanimura. “At least the well wasn’t inside the Palace of the Prophets,” shesaid. “It has been destroyed.”“Destroyed?” said the sliph, sounding surprised. “As part of a battle? Is it agreat victory for our cause?”“The palace was destroyed in a battle,” Nicci answered cautiously, not wantingto give information that the sliph didn’t need to know. “I have my mission. Iwill call you when I am ready to return.”The sliph’s features showed nothing but determination. “I will be here. We mustachieve victory against the evil wizards of the New World.”The strange creature settled back into her metallic pool like a candle meltingin a puddle of wax. Nicci heard a rushing sound as the silver froth retreatedinto the depths.The Hagen Woods … it made sense to her now. For centuries this dark forest hadbeen a sinister place, supposedly haunted and dangerous. The gifted young mentrained by the Sisters were warned never to go there, but Nicci and the Sistersof the Dark had performed numerous rituals in the woods. With a chill, Nicciremembered when she herself had been brought into the forest as a young convert,surrounded by grim Sisters who indoctrinated her into the service of the Keeper.The initiation had been horrific and painful. The other Sisters had watched withacid enjoyment as they tied Nicci down and summoned the Keeper’s monstrousservant. She’d been forced to submit to the brutal caresses of the warty-skinnedbeing who took her and took her again, as she writhed in pain, unable to fight.Nicci had wept but clenched her teeth, trying not to scream. It hadn’t been rapebecause she had requested it. She surrendered her body and soul, and it hadchanged her forever.Now she shuddered. No wonder the sliph well had remained hidden in the HagenWoods for all this time. Few people explored here, and those who did seldomreturned. Nicci wondered how long the rumors and warnings had existed about thedark forest. Maybe this had been part of Sulachan’s insidious cause, too, abastion of rumors spread to keep the woods empty so the sliph could transportspies whenever she wished.After marking the location of the well so she could find it again, Nicci workedher way through the shadowy forest, finally coming upon a clearing from whichshe could see the delta of the Kern River and the lights of Tanimura. She knewwhere to go.With the cloth-wrapped glass secured against her side, Nicci walked in her blackdress through the underbrush. She made her way down to the city’s outerdistricts by dawn. She had walked these streets for many years on business forthe Palace of the Prophets.In the port where sailing ships docked and unloaded their exotic cargo, she hadserved the Sisters for decades, arranging for supplies, negotiating withcraftsmen, buying fabrics, commissioning garments to be made by seamstresses.Nicci remembered that Sister Hilda had been fond of preserved kraken meat, andshe had often been dispatched to buy a crate of the fresh catch when thestinking, oily ships came in. No one but Sister Hilda could tolerate the rubberymeat that befouled the air of the palace kitchens whenever the chefs attemptedto cook it. Hilda offered to share her delicacy, but none of the Sistersaccepted her offer.Nicci had also gone on dark missions for the Keeper, helping recruit for theSisters of the Dark, assassinating victims identified by the Keeper, althoughshe was never allowed to know why such people needed to die. Nicci didn’t ask,suspecting it might just be a test to prove her unquestioning loyalty.She walked into the streets of Tanimura as the sun rose and craftsmen emergedsleepy-eyed, building fires in their forges, filling cooling buckets from publicwells. Tanners began scraping skins stretched on racks, potters added water tosoft clay or brushed glaze on unfired pots they had fashioned the previous dayand let dry overnight.Barking dogs chased chickens into alleys. Children walked with their mothers,carrying dough for community ovens where the women would bake the day’s breadand carry it home in baskets. Nicci walked among them, calling no attention toherself. She remembered Tanimura as a thriving place with markets, crowdeddwellings, inns and brothels, glassblowers and leatherworkers. She wasn’t acustomer, though. She needed to find the D’Haran garrison.Richard had begun to consolidate the new reaches of his empire. The firstsoldiers had come down to Tanimura by the time she and Nathan arrived here ontheir travels. Now she hoped the military had a significant presence in Tanimuraso she could deliver her report about Utros’s huge army.Pausing at the stall of a man who made jaunty hats, she asked, “Where can I findthe garrison? Surely there is a commander here.”“Of course!” the hatmaker said. “My, but they are excellent customers. Soldiersoff duty love a fine hat for when they flirt with the ladies. My partner in thenext block makes felt jackets and fur-lined cloaks. He and I are the ones whomake the D’Haran army look so dashing.”“I don’t care whether they are dashing,” Nicci said. “They need to be warned.Where can I find them?”The man straightened his hats on display, running his fingers along a dyedfeather. “General Linden is in charge of the garrison, since General Zimmer andPrelate Verna took a large expeditionary force to the south.”“Verna?” Nicci asked, remembering Verna from the Palace of the Prophets. She wasthe one who had finally brought Richard in so he could begin his training. “Withthe Palace of the Prophets ruined and prophecy itself eliminated, I’m surprisedthere are any Sisters who need a prelate at all.”“Oh, there are still Sisters, my lady. I don’t know what the world would come toif there were no Sisters of the Light! Who would hold the Keeper at bay, I askyou?” He chuckled nervously.“Who indeed?” Nicci asked, then added in a firm voice, “Tell me how to find thegarrison.”It was midmorning by the time she worked her way around the bustling harbor,through market squares, to the district where the D’Haran garrison was. Becauseshe had spent so much time in the city, some of the townspeople actually knewNicci. Her dress was distinctive because she had always worn black, even amongthe Sisters who more often chose bright colors.The D’Haran army had coopted several multistoried inns and warehouses. Thebuildings had been gutted and remodeled, and lumber from numerous sawmillsbrought in to erect barracks inside the compound. Soldiers wearing the armor ofD’Hara marched on patrol. Tanimura would be a good beachhead for Richard’sexpanding empire. Even though the city might have seemed the southern limit ofcivilized lands, Nicci now knew there was far more to the Old World, includingGeneral Utros and his vast army.As two soldiers walked toward her, side by side, nodding politely to passersby,Nicci was glad to see that the Tanimurans were not frightened by the soldiers,unlike the reaction when Jagang’s army occupied a town. Nicci stepped in frontof the pair, blocking their way. “Gentlemen, I need you to take me to yourcommander.”The two young soldiers blinked in surprise. “That’s most irregular. I—”“I am the sorceress Nicci. I fought with Lord Rahl.”“Nicci?” cried the other guard. His eyes ran up and down her form. “I know yourblack dress, but your hair—what happened?”“Are you soldiers or hairdressers? I need to speak with General Linden. I havenews that Lord Rahl must learn immediately.”“Yes, Sorceress, of course!” The two men turned about and walked at a pace briskenough to satisfy even Nicci.They led her through the gates of the garrison, where soldiers were practicingswordplay in the yard. They all stopped and looked at her. Someone whisperedloudly, “That’s Death’s Mistress.” Nicci ignored the comment.The headquarters building was a two-story wooden structure with open doubledoors. The three hurried up a staircase of fresh pine boards to the secondlevel, where General Linden sat in his main office. He was busy at his desk,writing reports, folding them, dribbling red wax to seal them, and pressing thewax with the stylized “R” of Lord Rahl.“Excuse me one moment,” he said without looking at them. He folded anotherdocument, scribbled with a quill pen, then sealed it with more wax, which he setaside to dry. Then he glanced up.The two soldiers stepped forward to report, but Linden turned his full attentionto Nicci. He was obviously surprised by the intensity he saw in her. The thinofficer was no older than his midthirties, with a port-wine splotch high on hisleft cheek. The crookedness of his nose implied that it had been broken at leastonce, but he seemed a calm man, not an embittered veteran.“General Linden, this woman is…” The soldier’s voice faltered.Nicci stepped between them and approached the desk. She removed the rectangle ofglass from her side, but kept the wrappings in place. “I am Nicci, companion toLord Richard Rahl. On his orders, the wizard Nathan and I are exploring the OldWorld as his ambassadors.”Linden sat back in his desk chair and smiled. “Yes, of course. I am honored tosee you, and more than a little surprised. We received messages up from RendaBay and a report from Cliffwall. Thanks to your message, General Zimmer andPrelate Verna took a hundred soldiers as well as the Sisters of the Light toprotect the great archive there.”Nicci was pleasantly surprised. “I am glad to hear that. The knowledge inCliffwall would be very dangerous if it fell into enemy hands. Now, it is moreimportant than ever to keep the archive protected.” She leaned across the deskand impatiently moved aside the document he had just signed. “General Linden, wemust send word north to the People’s Palace as well as make preparationsthroughout the cities of the Old World. A vast army from ancient times hasreawakened, and they are on the move.”“Ancient soldiers?” Linden asked. “That sounds like a story told in the tavern.”“It’s true, and they have laid siege to the city of Ildakar. So far, the wizardsthere have held them off, but now General Utros is dividing his forces, sendingthousands of troops on exploratory missions. Sooner or later that great forcewill move north.”Linden looked at the papers on his desk as if one of them might containinstructions for a situation such as this. Behind Nicci, the two escort soldiersmuttered in surprise.“I can’t emphasize the danger enough. Lord Rahl needs to know, and you mustprepare. We have to fortify not only Tanimura, but all the cities up and downthe coast. We need the D’Haran army.” She unwrapped the cloth from the glassrectangle Elsa had created. “Here is the proof you need.”Nicci turned the magical window with its implanted images so Linden could seeUtros’s ancient army covering the plain.“They have already begun to move, General, but you have the advantage of timeand distance, so long as you begin your preparations now.”Linden stared at the images in the glass. “Dear spirits…”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 48 [contents.xhtml#c_ch48]As the expedition departed from Cliffwall, Verna felt optimistic. The companyincluded General Zimmer and half of his D’Haran soldiers along with the guardescort that had accompanied Renn on the journey from Ildakar. Captain Trevor andhis men were pleased to be going home, although none of them relished thethought of another hard trek.“A journey doesn’t need to be difficult if you know your way,” Verna said to theuneasy Renn, who was torn between his desire to go home and his wish to stay atthe comfortable archive. He expressed his worries about getting lost, runningout of supplies, fending off wild beasts, and countless other wildernesshazards. This time, though, they all rode horses from the D’Haran expeditionaryforce, and General Zimmer’s men knew how to make efficient field camps along theway.Riding along, the wizard looked over at Verna. “I much prefer this to walking onsore feet, although I may change my mind after several days in the saddle.” Heshifted his position, holding on to the reins of his ash-gray mare, and rubbedhis already sore buttocks. “In Ildakar we have few horses. The city was bottledup for so many years, where would we ride? How would we feed them?”“Didn’t your nobles use carriages to travel about the town?”“Oh, sometimes, but they live in the higher levels and rarely need to go down tothe lower districts, since they have household servants to run errands forthem.” He rocked back and forth as the horses continued at a fast walk.Verna stared ahead at the severe line of mountains that rose out of the greatgreen bowl that had once been the Lifedrinker’s Scar. The wizard seemedintimidated by the range ahead of them, remembering the hardships of their firstcrossing. The people of Cliffwall had spoken of the legendary beauty of KolAdair, although Renn had an entirely different experience of the windy mountainpass. He had complained about the thin air, stumbling over loose rocks, fightingthrough willows in the tundra. He hadn’t seen much beauty.As they rode toward the rugged mountains, Verna tried to sound reassuring.“We’ll guide you better this time, Renn. I am certain of it.”“I trust your word, Prelate, and when we reach Ildakar, I will return the favorand show you our hospitality.” He lowered his voice. “After we give a cautiousreport to Sovrena Thora.”Verna said, “Nicci and Nathan will help, I’m sure.”Six of her fellow Sisters of the Light accompanied her and Amber, while fourremained at Cliffwall to continue their studies with the other scholars. Anadditional dozen gifted scholars and students rode with the party, intent menand women who had studied the preserved records and learned much magic. They hadbeen wisely afraid to exercise their abilities, having seen the previous mishapscaused by naive and uncontrolled amateurs, but Verna thought these earnesttrainees could learn more by doing than by merely reading. This expedition mightgive them a chance to stretch their abilities.Oliver and Peretta shared a horse. Looking ahead, they pointed out interestinglandmarks to each other and also Amber, who seemed just as starry-eyed about heradventures since leaving Tanimura. The three young people had become fastfriends, and Amber talked about her brother who had stayed behind to defendRenda Bay.Verna listened to their conversation, but kept her thoughts to herself. She hadtraveled for much of her life, wandering with Sisters Grace and Elizabeth insearch of Richard Rahl. Verna hadn’t known at the time that her two companionswere secretly Sisters of the Dark working for the Keeper. So many things hadslipped beneath Verna’s notice that she felt embarrassed and ashamed. She hopedthat would never happen again.By the good spirits, she was still here in another land and another situation.The Sisters of the Dark were gone, the veil to the underworld forever sealed,and the Keeper locked away. Magic had changed. Prophecy was gone. The Palace ofthe Prophets had been erased, but Verna was still prelate, even though theirorder had little meaning anymore.For days they traveled into the hills, following Trevor’s best guess of theroute, though General Zimmer expressed gruff skepticism about trying to retracethe path of a party that had been lost and miserable in the first place. Theycould see the high mountain pass ahead, and Peretta had memorized descriptionsof Kol Adair from the ancient records. The party camped at night with cookfires, tents, and warm blankets.Renn sat at the main campfire next to Zimmer, Verna, and Sisters Rhoda andEldine. The wizard helped himself to a second plate of mashed beans. “Ah, Iremember when Lani and I would have the servants prepare feasts for only the twoof us, and we would enjoy calm conversation long into the night. She was such awonderful woman.” He smiled. “Did I mention that Lani could call songbirds? Theywould flutter and sing around us. We’d sit outside and the larks would providebetter music than any minstrel.”“She sounds very nice,” Verna said. “Was she a sorceress? What happened to her?”“Thora turned her to stone.” Renn’s expression darkened. “Once a person has beenfrozen with the petrification spell, nothing can revive them. Even the wizardcommander said he couldn’t reverse the magic.” He glanced away.The group climbed higher into the mountains, and the days and nights grewintensely cold. General Zimmer looked at the rugged ridgelines ahead, where arelatively clear path for the horses switchbacked up the slopes. “We should pushourselves hard so we can be over the pass before sunset. If we can get back downto the tree line, we will have a much warmer camp tonight.”“And plenty of firewood,” Trevor added.The soldiers hunched down on their saddles, wrapped in cloaks as they rode intothe cold wind. Oliver and Peretta huddled closer to each other in the saddle,warm and content as they wrapped one blanket around the two of them.The horses plodded along, climbing to the summit of the pass, where the vistasuddenly unfolded before them, a world full of black, glacier-hung mountains.The group paused to marvel at the peaks, the frozen waves of ice that slid downthe crags, the waterfalls of snowmelt running down sheer gorges, the jewel-likelakes, the lush hanging valleys.As the sun dipped lower in late afternoon, shadows spread out in the bowl beyondKol Adair. Renn gestured toward the vista. “You see what I told you? Imaginepicking your way over those mountains, down into the valley, then back up overthis pass. What a nightmare!”Peretta drank in the view, filing every detail in her memmer’s mind. Olivermarveled at what he saw, though his eyesight was poor.Zimmer spotted the path that zigzagged down the slope on the opposite side ofthe pass, but the shelter of the tree line seemed a long way below. “I’ll sendscouts to reconnoiter the best way. With the steep rocky trail, I don’t want thehorses to break a leg, and we certainly don’t want to pick our way down in thedark.”Amber stared across the valley toward the glaciers clinging to the black rockyslopes. “What is that over there? It looks like people—lots of people.”Oliver shaded his eyes, squinting, but his expression remained blank. He shookhis head. “I can’t tell.”Verna and Zimmer tried to discern what the young novice’s sharp eyes hadspotted. “I see it now. It looks like a significant force of troops at the baseof the cliffs on the next ridge. It’s a huge camp, but where are their tents?Their campfires?”Beside her, Peretta squinted. “It’s thousands of people, maybe as many as tenthousand, like a whole moving city.”“Not a city,” Zimmer said. “An army.”After dismounting, Renn stood in his maroon wizard’s robes, hands on his hips.The wind blew his hair. “But where would such a military force come from? EvenIldakar doesn’t have an army that size.”Captain Trevor looked pale and uneasy. “That is the direction we have to go. Howwill we get past them?”“Maybe they’re friendly,” Amber said.“An army of many thousands is not likely to be friendly,” Zimmer said.“The only giant army near Ildakar was turned to stone,” said Renn. “And theycouldn’t possibly…” His voice trailed off.Trevor also looked concerned. “Where else would they come from?”“We have to know.” Zimmer blew cold air through his lips. “Right now, we’d bestremain hidden. Our force isn’t large, but we are exposed up here on the pass. Weneed to get into the trees. Alas, we can’t build campfires tonight, because theymight be spotted.”Verna continued to stare, disturbed. “Whoever it is, they’re marching in thegeneral direction of Cliffwall.”Shaken by what they’d seen, the expedition hurried down off the exposed pass,painstakingly picking their way down the stony slope. Riders in the lead hadidentified the best way to get into the shelter of the trees below. When theyreached the forest cover in the last glow of twilight, the soldiers spread outto set up a rudimentary camp. Renn looked forlornly at the plentiful fallenwood, but no one built a warm, cheery fire. Verna, however, assigned severalCliffwall scholars the task of using magic to boil water so they could at leastmake hot soup or tea. The Sisters also generated heat to warm rocks, which madethe camp much more comfortable.General Zimmer met with several of his best D’Haran scouts. “We need to knowwhat that army is. Their camp is large, but not permanent, so they haven’t beenthere long. I want some answers before they begin to move again. A force thatsize will take some time to pack up and set off.”Trevor seemed anxious. “Let one of my people accompany your scouts. If theytravel under cover of darkness, they could get close enough for a good view. Mymen might recognize those soldiers, if they did come from Ildakar.”Zimmer agreed and dispatched three men into the deepening dusk to investigatethe unexpected army.Verna sat next to the general on a fallen log. “It will take hours for them tobring back a report. We should get some rest in the meantime. It’s going to be along night.”Shortly before dawn, the three scouts returned, their faces scratched frombranches. They had made their way around the curve of the hanging valley to theedge of the encamped army, where they had indeed gotten a good view.“We saw thousands of armed warriors, General,” the first man reported. “I don’tknow how to explain it. They have no campfires, blankets, tents, or food that wecould see. They are simply on the move, thousands of them, but they stopped forthe night. The terrain is too rugged to cross in the darkness.”The second scout said, “And their armor looks ancient. Some of them bearstandards with a flame symbol on it.”“It is the mark of Emperor Kurgan,” said the Ildakaran guard who had accompaniedthem. He sounded certain. “I have seen it before on the petrified army outsideof our city.”“We saw two of their sentries as they passed close to us on patrol,” said thefirst scout. “They moved sluggishly, and they were not very alert.” He glancedat Verna, then back to his commander. “General, sir, their skin was grayish,like stone.”Renn and Captain Trevor looked appalled. “I was afraid of this,” the wizardgroaned. “By the Keeper’s beard, it’s the ancient army, the soldiers of GeneralUtros. They are somehow awake and on the move.”Verna heard the news with a chill. “And they are marching toward Cliffwall.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 49 [contents.xhtml#c_ch49]The Norukai serpent ships were at last ready, and King Grieve felt the hot bloodsinging in his veins. Each day his people moved with energy and determination asthey made preparations for war. Their voices grew louder as they shouted boastsand pounded drums. Grieve had seen it before. The Norukai called it raidingfever, but this would be more than just a raid.Accompanied by his pale and shivering shaman, the king went down to the harborand watched all the serpent ships sail in from outlying islands. He had gathereda navy of truly breathtaking scope. In addition to the forty ships they alreadyused in their depredations, another fifty new war vessels had been completed bythe island shipwrights, and dozens more were under construction. When his fleetset off to conquer Ildakar, it would be remembered as the greatest raid inNorukai history, one that would give his people a whole continent to squeeze.The disgraced captains Kor and Lars would each have ten ships of their own tocrush and conquer the large coastal cities. The world was about to feel thestrong Norukai fist.Out in the open water beyond the main island, his warships waited. Long oarsprotruded from the hulls, and the muscular crew pulled, guiding the serpentships through the dangerous labyrinth of reefs. The vessels were well suppliedalready, and they would find towns to raid and provisions to seize along theway, until his fleet reached the estuary and sailed up the Killraven River toseize Ildakar.Ready to embark on their suicidal missions, Kor and Lars had gathered thesurviving members of their defeated crews and encouraged volunteers to jointhem. Their raiders were an unruly lot, mostly Norukai who had committed crimesand wanted to purge their sentences; others had huge gambling debts. When Korand Lars put out the call for fighters, Grieve announced that anyone who joinedthe expeditions could erase everything with their own blood. The crimes wouldnot be forgotten, but the Norukai would regain their honor. They would kill,pillage, and destroy until such time as they themselves fell in battle. If theydid conquer the world for King Grieve, then all would be forgiven.From the harbor, he looked back up the slick, sheer cliffs dotted with moss tothe walls of the looming Bastion. That was his ancestral home, where he hadruled for years, where his father had lived and died, and where so many otherNorukai kings had ruled. Grieve realized he might never return here if Ildakarwas all Kor said it was, but he also knew that the king of the world could notbe isolated on an island.Before the separate fleets could launch, however, important sacrifices needed tobe made. The Norukai knew how to guarantee victory.Squat Norukai women stood together at the rim of a drum five feet across,pounding with clubs on the stretched skin of a scaly serpent. The drums boomedout, echoing along the cliffs and shuddering in the water, louder even than thewaves crashing against the black rocks. Around the corner of the harbor cliffs,a second group of summoners clanged on the cylindrical iron bells that dangledon chains from the rock walls.Beside him, Chalk bounced from one foot to the other, energized by the drums,though his movements didn’t follow the rhythm. When the shaman grinned, hisscarred lips twisted and his pockmarked face wrinkled. “My Grieve! And theserpent god! Serpent, serpent, serpent! And blood for our war.”“We will feed the serpent god,” Grieve said, “and he will feed our bravery andour strength.”Captain Kor waited at the end of the dock. Ten serpent ships were tied up in theharbor, making final preparations for his own raid, and Lars had a similar groupof vessels, while the rest of the Norukai navy was anchored well beyond thereefs, ready to sail for Ildakar.Kor presented himself before Grieve, stiff and formal. “I am honored to watchthe sacrifice at your side, my king. The serpent god will empower my raidingparty as well as your fleet.”Grieve opened his mouth wide, exposing his teeth all the way back to the molars,and he let out a loud hiss, imitating the serpent god. Chalk laughed, delightedat the exhibition.Grieve said, “The serpent god will empower me and my warriors, but he mustforgive you and your weakness. Do you think Yorik has enough blood to buy bothof those things for us?”“Yorik is a powerful man. The serpent god will be pleased.”Crowds gathered down at the harbor to watch from a safe distance. Norukai womenbrought their wide-eyed children out for the ceremony. Grieve saw that some ofthe boys were old enough to undergo the scarification. A few young men had theircheeks slit all the way back to the hinge of the jaw, but their scars were stillred and angry. Others still had bandages wrapped around their faces. The youngmen watched the war preparations with shining eyes. Some of their mothers, alsowell armed, would go along for the battle, leaving the children in the care oftrusted slaves.Grieve looked at his people, and they stared back at him in admiration. They allfeared him, but it was a healthy fear. He had led them to great glory andwealth, but he himself had remained in the Bastion for far too long. He wasready to feel hard bone and vulnerable flesh against the blade of his axe, thehot spray of blood across his face. Yes, it had been too long.But before they could go, he had to receive the strength and blessing of theserpent god.Leaving the crowds in the safety of the harbor, Grieve strode alongside Chalkand Kor on the narrow rock path above the tide line. This way led around theprotective point to a deep, rough cove open to the sea, where the great serpentscould come.They followed the edge of the cliffs to where they could look across at pillarsof stone erected on the reef rock, from which manacles dangled. This was theplace of sacrifice, safely far from the ships anchored out beyond the reefs.Eager Norukai from the fleet set out in small coracles, paddling around theharbor and keeping close to the jagged shore, where they didn’t need to fear thegreat serpent when it came. Some of the large raiding ships also rowed closer sotheir crews could watch the spectacle.The iron bells and loud drums thundered around the cliffs, sending a relentlesscall through the water. The serpent god would hear and respond to the summons.Kor’s voice was hoarse. “We must prepare.” He stared at the stone posts and theempty chains hanging from them. “Quickly.”“Prepare!” Chalk shouted. “My Grieve, King Grieve!”A large coracle came into the cove and approached the stone pillars from thedeep water. Two burly Norukai warriors rowed the coracle, while Yorik rode inthe front, hunched down. He did not look panicked. Instead, he stared at thetwin pillars and the chains waiting for him; then he gazed out to sea, knowingthat was where the monster would come.Kor watched him, his face expressionless.Chalk cried out, “Serpent, serpent, serpent! I’ve seen it! Blood, and war, andvictory.” Then he lowered his voice, tilted his head, and snickered. “But whowill win? Who will die? The serpent god will feast.”“Quiet, Chalk,” Grieve chided. “This is a solemn occasion. It is important forour future.”“Our future! Ildakar! Ildakar will be gone after we arrive.”“Ildakar will be ours,” Grieve said, and turned to Kor. “And if your raiders dotheir jobs, so will the cities along the coast.”“Lars and I will attack them all, King Grieve,” Kor said. “Those cities havenever seen anything like the Norukai.”The guards rowed the coracle up to the stone posts and threw a grappling hook toanchor the small boat against the rocks. They prodded Yorik, but he needed noencouragement. Naked, he stood up from the boat and stepped onto the shore,willingly taking his place between the posts with the chains. His body wasmuscular and scarred, covered with tattooed curves and stripes along his ribs,shoulders, buttocks, and the backs of his legs. Watching him, Grieve thoughtYorik was a proud man despite his unforgivable failure.Kor said, “The serpent god will devour him and consume his weakness, leaving therest of us stronger.”“You have to consume your own weakness, Kor,” Grieve grumbled.“I know. My shame will sharpen my sword and strengthen my battle-axe. I can onlypray that enough blood will wash it away. Lars and his fleet will do the same.”The guards raised Yorik’s arms and fastened the manacles around his wrists. Armsoutstretched, Yorik hung between the two stone posts. His feet barely touchedthe slick rock where waves crashed against the base of the posts.From where they stood on the opposite side of the cove, Chalk hungrily watchedthe sacrificial victim. Dangling there, Yorik stared out to sea. He didn’tstruggle. The drumbeats and the iron bells made a louder and louder clamor.After placing the victim in chains, the guards climbed back into the coracle androwed swiftly away, knowing the serpent god would come soon.At the end of the path opposite from the sacrificial post hung a wide brass gongon a trunk of driftwood. King Grieve picked up the baton and shouted, “Serpentgod, we have a sacrifice for you. We need your strength, and we give you ours.Help us share in the blood of conquest.”Like a warrior swinging a battle mace into an enemy’s skull, Grieve smashed thegong, eliciting a thunderous crash, surely loud enough to be heard even in thegreatest depths of the ocean. The sound of the gong reverberated around theisland. Thousands of Norukai aboard the serpent ships let out loud cheers, asdid the crowds in the sheltered harbor. Aboard the serpent ships, the raidersbegan stomping on the decks, rattling on the rails. The pounding on the ironbells and drums grew louder, more insistent.Chalk snatched the baton from Grieve’s large hands and swung it against thegong, clanging and clanging.Isolated on the spit of rock, Yorik hung on his chains, watching the open wateruntil a ripple formed on the choppy waves, a jagged, razor-edged fin that slicedthe surface. Around the island and out in the ships, spectators cried out forthe serpent god. Grieve wondered why their noise didn’t distract the enormouscreature, but the serpent god knew its intended sacrifice.The snakelike form glided through the deep channel, approaching the island.Waves crashed against the reefs, boomed on the rocks and cliffs, echoed in thecove. From his chains, Yorik shouted, “Serpent god, I am yours!” The man let outa loud snarling growl which sounded of both challenge and surrender.The shape grew larger, the shadow darker in the water, and finally the serpentgod rose from the waves. The creature’s head was long and angular, like a spearpoint. Frills of fins spread out like bloodred fans behind its head and underits jaw. Its scales were magnificent, blue and green. Each of its eyes waslarger than a human head. As the great serpent sinuously lifted itself higher,rivulets poured from its jaws. It was far more fearsome and magnificent than thecarving at the prow of any serpent ship.The creature fixed its gaze on Yorik and opened its huge mouth, flicking out along, forked tongue and releasing a deafening hiss.King Grieve opened his own mouth as wide as he could and belched out his ownhiss, trying to sound like the serpent god. Dangling from his chains, Yoriklaughed and screamed and called out, struggling—not to break free, but tostretch himself toward the serpent god.King Grieve shivered with awe and amazement. Seeing the great monster, he feltsmall, weak, insignificant. Kor fell to his knees, gibbering with amazement andterror.From the boats anchored beyond the island, the Norukai crews yelled. The drumsand iron bells continued, but Grieve saw only the serpent god as it glided intothe cove toward the man who had been offered to it.For a frozen moment the serpent towered above, regarding Yorik, who keptlaughing insanely, squirming, flailing, challenging.Grieve was suddenly terrified, wondering what would happen if the serpent godrefused the sacrifice. If Yorik’s flaws made him unacceptable, would the Norukaithen be cursed? Would his war of conquest be doomed from the beginning?The serpent flashed forward and engulfed Yorik, biting down hard and ripping itsmorsel away. One of Yorik’s severed arms swung from the manacle, floppingagainst the stone post and splashing a mark of red there. With two snaps of itsjaws, the serpent god consumed the sacrifice and turned about in a gracefulrippling arc.From the other side of the cove, the giant reptilian eyes regarded King Grieve,who managed to stare back. Chalk whimpered and hid behind his king, clutchingthe big man’s waist. Grieve barely felt him. He stared at the serpent god andshared thoughts. The fires in his blood burned even hotter, and he swelled hischest and pounded a fist against his heart.Satisfied, the serpent god submerged again. Long rippled fins cut the water asthe monstrous form glided back out to sea.After witnessing the sign, King Grieve knew that his Norukai were destined forgreatness."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 50 [contents.xhtml#c_ch50]Even after they got safely back inside the walls of Ildakar, Lila kept runningas if they were still being pursued. Bannon panted hard, and his muscles ached.His shirt was torn, his trousers caked with mud and blood, but he was free!When they reached a yaxen trough in the lower levels of the city, he dropped tohis knees and wheezed, “Stop, I need to rest.” He plunged his hands into thewater and splashed his face. The cool liquid felt glorious, washing away sweat,grime, and blood. He let out a long sigh and kept his eyes closed as watertrickled from his long tangled hair. He scooped up a handful and drank deeply.Sweat shone on Lila’s skin as she stood next to him, proud. He remembered whenshe had looked so imperious in the training pits, provoking him to fight harder.Now her gaze was strangely soft. Still unable to believe what had happened, hesaid, “You came back for me.”“I did.” She put her hands on her narrow hips, touching the small cylinder ofthe agile knife that could inflict so much pain. She nudged him with her knee.“Come, we need to let the others know. After Nicci’s sand panther spotted whatmight have been a rude prison for captives, they didn’t believe I had any chanceof finding you.”Bannon levered himself to his feet. Without looking back, she set off at a briskpace to the upper levels, expecting him to follow. Her hips swayed beneath herblack waist wrap, and Bannon saw the rune-marked skin on her back over thelandscape of taut muscles. He increased his pace to walk next to the morazeth,rather than behind her like a pet on a leash. “How many others were killedduring our sortie? Was the surprise attack a success?”Lila turned to him with her shadowed eyes. “We killed many of the enemy. Twomorazeth died, but we made a good accounting of ourselves.”“Two morazeth? Which ones?” He had resented the women for how they treated thetrainees, but now he felt a strange heaviness to learn that some were gone.“Ricia and Marla. Genda was wounded, but she will recover.” Lila showed noemotion when she recited the names. “When I lost you on the battlefield, I…” Shehad to struggle to get out the word. “I apologize. I will attend to you moreclosely from now on, if we ever find ourselves in a similar situation.”Bannon drew a shuddering breath, not wanting to think about what must havehappened to Brock and Jed. “Let’s hope it never happens again.”She paused. “General Utros and his army are still undefeated, and Ildakar isstill under siege. Surely, there will be more battles.”Bannon gripped Sturdy’s hilt. “I know. I just wasn’t looking forward to it.”Dawn wouldn’t come for another hour yet, and the streetlights still blazed, litby transference magic. Lila led him directly to the ruling tower, though hecouldn’t imagine the duma members were meeting at such a late hour. He wonderedhow Nicci had reacted to the news that he’d been lost on the battlefield.…As they reached the top of the plateau, he glanced longingly at the grand villa.Right now he wanted to sleep in his guest bed for days, but he had to report tothe duma first. He followed Lila into the tower and up the waterfall of stonesteps to the ruling chamber, which was lit by a warm fire and burning candles.Elsa, Oron, Damon, and the chalky-white Lani were huddled over unfurled scrolls,studying a map of Ildakar, the winding streets and aqueducts that riddled thebluff. The duma members looked up at the disturbance, and Lila spoke beforeanyone could react. “I have rescued Bannon Farmer. He was exactly where Nicci’spanther suspected prisoners might be held.”Nathan emerged from a side alcove carrying a thick book, which he dropped on themarble floor. “Dear boy, you’re alive! So many died that we couldn’t even tallytheir names, but you’re alive!” Grinning, he bounded over, and Bannon couldbarely breathe as the wizard embraced him. “Dear spirits, you’re alive!”Bannon didn’t know what to say.Nathan released him and stepped back, just staring at him with sparkling eyes asif to convince himself the sight was true.Regaining his balance, Bannon looked around the chamber. Duma members stared athim, their faces full of questions, but he didn’t see Nicci. He wanted to tellher that Mrra was still prowling out in the hills.“We fought hard. I…” He tried to organize his rattling thoughts. “I couldn’thave done it without Lila. She came for me. For me, Jed, and Brock. I—”Oron came forward, his long yellow braid hanging on the left side of his head.His face was stony, without sympathy, exactly the expression he’d worn whenskinning the poor fur animals. “You were with Jed and my son? We thought theydied on the battlefield.”“Yes, we were all prisoners, and General Utros was going to interrogate us. WhenLila and Mrra came, though, we broke free. We all ran…” Each word felt heavieras he spoke it.Oron stood waiting for a full report. “And?”Lady Olgya came up to stand beside him, also concerned. “What about Jed?”Bannon glanced at Nathan for support, but knew he would have to say what heneeded to say. “Before we got far, the alarm was sounded. W-We ran as fast as wecould, but the enemy soldiers closed in. I called for Jed and Brock, but they …they thought they’d have a better chance if we split up. While Lila and I foughtour way through, those two ran in different directions. I never saw them again.I don’t know if they were captured or killed.”Oron considered this for a long moment as the other duma members remained silentand sullen. Finally, he frowned and turned back to the stone tables. “My son wasworthless anyway. What is worse, to be killed in battle, or to be captured?” Hemade a disgusted sound. “Twice?”Olgya shivered, closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her expressionwas like iron. “I already accepted that my son was dead several nights ago.Come, we have business to do and an entire city to save.”Nathan gave Bannon another paternal hug. “You look quite a mess. Go cleanyourself up, eat, rest. When you have recovered, the duma will want a fullreport of what you saw inside the enemy’s camp.”Bannon nodded sheepishly. “Where is Nicci? I should let her know that I’malive.”Nathan paused. “She has gone away.”For an instant, Bannon’s heart failed, fearing that the beautiful sorceress hadbeen killed on the battlefield.“By now, she is in Tanimura, I hope,” Nathan continued. “She traveled in thesliph to spread a warning about General Utros and his army.”Still protective, Lila placed a firm hand on Bannon’s shoulder, guiding him fromthe duma chamber. “We can discuss this later. Bannon Farmer is weary and hungry.I will see to his needs.”The young man was relieved, not sure he could think straight after all he’d beenthrough. He swayed on his feet as he followed the morazeth.They headed toward the grand villa that had, until recently, been the lavishhome of Maxim and Thora. Many of the rooms had been taken over by householdservants who had worked there. Leading Bannon, Lila called out to two women whostood in the corridors under the open trellises. “Bring food. This man needsnourishment. He is a brave fighter for Ildakar.”The women recognized Bannon and hurried off. When he reached his chambers, helooked at the broad bed with its silken sheets, the small table, a wardrobe forhis garments, a pitcher filled with fresh water, a bowl with overripe and moldyfruit that had been there for days. Two tangerines were still intact, despitetheir hard, dry rinds. Bannon grabbed one and worked at the peel, but Lila tookit from him and sliced it in quarters with her dagger. He slurped the sweetcitrus fruit and felt a rush of energy. He let his eyes flutter closed as he letout a long sigh.Lila moved about the room, businesslike. She found a soft cloth, moistened itwith water from the pitcher, and began to scrub the dried blood from his face,rubbing hard as if she could wipe away the freckles as well. She dabbed at ascab on his mouth, then washed his neck. Her intent eyes seemed to be studying aspecimen or preparing him for sale to some discriminating merchant.“I just want to lie down and rest,” he said, feeling uneasy.“Not yet. You have been through a difficult challenge, as hard as combat in thearena. You’re sweaty, your muscles are hard and knotted. You are not ready forsleep yet.”The two servant women appeared, carrying platters with grapes, cheeses, a coupleof hard rolls, and sliced yaxen meat. Bannon’s mouth watered. The tangerinehadn’t been enough. “Maybe I’m not ready for sleep just yet.” The women hovered,asking if he needed anything else, but Lila shooed them away.Bannon ravenously tore into one of the rolls, then ate cheese and a handful ofjuicy grapes that he barely chewed before swallowing.As he ate, Lila tugged at his shirt, but the fabric stuck to scabs on his back,and crusted dirt and blood made the cloth stiff. With a grunt of frustration,she used her dagger to slice the shirt down the back. He yelped in surprise, butshe tugged the cloth away. “It was ruined anyway.” She tossed it into a pile onthe floor.Bannon chewed a slice of meat, tasting the savory juices. It was all he couldconcentrate on.With the shirt gone, Lila used the wet cloth to rinse his back, then his chest,and Bannon relaxed. Only hours ago, he had been sure of being executed. He slidaway from the tray of food and sat on the edge of the bed. After she finishedwashing his chest, she went behind him and kneaded his shoulders, then workedher way down his back. Morazeth trainers usually inflicted extravagant pain, butthis was exactly the opposite.“You have skills beyond combat, Lila. I’m glad.”“I have many skills.” She placed her hand on his chest and pressed him abruptlybackward onto the bed so she could remove his boots. “As you well know.”“What are you doing? I’m tired and sore.”“You had a great battle,” she said. “I … worried about you, and I am pleased youwere not killed. I want to show my gratitude.”“Thank you, but it’s not necessary.”Lila had never accepted no for an answer. “Honor demands it.” After his harddays of training in the combat pits, she had claimed him as her lover, grantinghim a “reward” of physical pleasure, whether or not he wanted it. She haddemanded it for herself and gave him no choice. “Do you have the strength toresist me?”“I am not your prisoner anymore,” he said.“You are still a man.” Her voice was gruff. With a gesture so swift he barelysaw her move her fingers, she unfastened the wrap around her breasts and let theleather strip drop to the floor. “I no longer need to force you.”Bannon felt the cool sheets under his bruised back, looked up at the naked Lilaas she leaned forward, climbing on top of him. He remembered the three beautifulacolytes from Cliffwall, Audrey, Laurel, and Sage. They had been his firstlovers, and they had given him amazing nights of pleasure, one after another,but the twisted magic of Life’s Mistress had turned those three beautiful womeninto monsters.Could the opposite happen? A hardened morazeth turned into a soft and sensuouswoman? As Lila bent closer to him and he felt her warm skin, smelled her muskyfeminine scent, he remembered how ruthless she had been, a steely trainer whoforced him to do what she demanded. She had terrified him. When he looked at hernow, she seemed warmer. Something had changed. She touched him with a hint oftenderness.Tentatively, he reached up and brushed the bare skin of her back, feeling themysterious symbols marked on her skin. As he ran his palms down her spine, hefelt as if he might be reading an arcane book by touch alone.“I did save your life, boy,” Lila said. “You owe me a reward.”Bannon couldn’t argue with that."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 51 [contents.xhtml#c_ch51]As Utros stared through the blood-tinted lens, he couldn’t tear his eyes fromhis beloved Majel, the woman he had longed for since leaving Orogang. He hadvowed to conquer the world for her husband, but his heart belonged to her. Heremembered her pointed chin and delicate nose, the full lips he had kissed somany times.Now, she was a horror, her entire face peeled off, her eyes intact, but with thelids flayed away so she could watch what her husband did to her body. Her jawmuscles were leathery red strips. As she spoke, her teeth clacked together,exposing her meaty tongue. “Utros, my love! You called for me.”He stared through the lens, stricken. Even Majel’s spirit was mutilated, aneternal reminder that Kurgan had personally imposed this punishment upon her.“Utros, why don’t you speak to me?” she pleaded, coming closer to the other sideof the glass. “You called me through the veil.”Despite the shocking wounds, he could see Majel in her eyes, the woman he hadcaressed and loved, and it was still her voice calling to him. “Oh, Majel…” hesaid. “Keeper and spirits, what has he done to you?”“The form of a spirit doesn’t matter,” she said. “What counts is the heart andsoul.”Ava and Ruva stood back watching this conversation, fascinated by the shadowedsouls lurking in the greenish mists behind the lens.The general’s focus remained on his beloved, and he heard the wisdom in herwords. “It’s been so long, Majel,” he said, in a quiet voice. “I left Orogangand conquered many lands, as I swore to do. We swept across the Old World andsent reports back to the capital. I did what Iron Fang commanded … but I missedyou so much.”“By then I was already dead,” she said. “And so was my husband. Your battleswere for nothing.”“No battle is for nothing. Because of … us, I had to prove that I was also loyalto my emperor.” The words pained him as he spoke, and he forced himself not toturn away from her horrific visage. “I didn’t mean to be gone so long, my love.The centuries must have been agony for you in the underworld, but I was stone. Icould not help. I could not join you.”Majel looked at him with her raw, naked eyes. “Time has no meaning here beyondthe veil. My death was like yesterday, or maybe it was forever ago. I havemissed you, Utros, and that makes even an instant seem like an eternity.”He extended his arms, but didn’t touch the glass. He wanted to embrace her,wanted to remember her. Perhaps the only way to join Majel was with his owndeath, if the Keeper would allow them to be together.She looked alarmed as she saw him more clearly. “Your face, Utros! Whathappened?” The question seemed a great irony to him, considering what she hadendured.He reached up to touch his cheek, felt the long-healed scar there that ran fromhis temple, around his eye, and down his cheek to vanish into the patchy area ofhis beard. “It is a burn from dragon fire,” he said, lowering his head. “Wecaptured a silver dragon and meant to unleash it on Ildakar, but the dragonturned on us instead. I was burned badly, but my sorceresses healed me. Othersdid not recover, and the dragon escaped.”Utros didn’t want to talk about past history or tactical mistakes. He longed totell Majel how he wanted to bring her back through the veil, but that wasimpossible. Ava and Ruva reaffirmed what Nicci and Nathan had said. The veil wasforever sealed, and he would have to content himself with seeing her, hearingher. They were separated by an impenetrable wall between life and death.“I love you,” he said.The flayed spirit answered, “I love you too. I long for you. I did everythingfor you, Utros, and I lost everything for you. But I…”Another voice, grating, deep, and shudderingly familiar, emanated through thelens. “But she is mine.”A second form appeared out of the greenish mist, a bulky copper-skinned man withoiled black hair tied in dozens of thin braids. He had a heavy brow, a hookednose, a strong jaw. Emperor Kurgan, his emperor, was an imposing man who hadgone to fat after years of hedonistic life. When he spoke, he exposed his teeth,showing one hooked iron fang on the left side of his mouth. “Just as you aremine, General Utros. You swore your loyalty to me, as did Majel. That vow cannotbe broken. Loyalty is stronger than love. I command that you remember it now!”The response was automatic. Utros placed a fist against his heart and bowed. “Myliege.”Kurgan pressed closer to the lens, standing next to Majel. From his actions hestill considered her his wife, his possession, his symbol. “You betrayed me. Youboth betrayed me.” His eyes blazed with more than just anger. “You swore. Youcut your hand and poured blood into a goblet, which I drank. Majel also gave meher blood. We were bound forever. You think the Keeper ignores such vows? Idemand your loyalty, both of you!”Utros dropped to his knee in front of the lens. “I betrayed you, my liege. Ihave no excuse, other than that I loved her. You have already inflicted yourpunishment on Majel.” His voice was raw with horror. He was glad his army couldnot see or hear this.“I need no apologies, no groveling, no explanations,” Iron Fang said.Inside, Utros felt as if wild horses were ripping apart his heart. “I remainloyal to you, my emperor. I conquered many lands in your name. My military forcestill numbers in the hundreds of thousands. I have laid siege to Ildakar as youcommanded and dispatched other armies to reconquer the cities and lands thathave been lost over the centuries.”“What is taking so long?” Kurgan demanded. “If you had been swifter in yourconquest, I would have had wealth and power, and my people would never haveturned on me. I would have been the greatest emperor in history, yet you left mein Orogang with this treacherous woman who pretended to love me. But now I knowthat when she gave me her body, she was imagining your kisses, your caresses.”He turned his glare upon the mutilated woman who stood beside him in the spiritworld.“Loyalty is stronger than love,” Majel said, as if he had drummed it into herfor fifteen centuries. “I am loyal to you, my husband.” Her voice cracked. “AndI’m sorry for you, Utros.”The words resonated in the general’s mind. He muttered, repeating them. Loyaltyis stronger than love. That was how he had been raised and trained. That waswhat he had held dear, until Majel changed his heart.“You say that?” Utros asked her. “Even after what he did to you?”“I remain loyal to my husband,” Majel said meekly, “to Emperor Kurgan.”“And I still command you, General Utros,” Iron Fang said. “Your original ordersstand, now that I can communicate with you from the underworld. You must payyour price. You must do as you promised and hope for forgiveness.”“I will, my emperor,” Utros said, still kneeling. “A great deal has changed overthe centuries, but I will regain the lands I once conquered for you.”Kurgan sounded annoyed, impatient. “Why don’t you have Ildakar yet? With an armyof hundreds of thousands, surely you are strong enough to defeat one city.”He knew Emperor Kurgan was capricious, volatile. He issued orders that thousandsof followers worked to implement, only to change his mind before the task wascompleted, while General Utros was a steady and rational commander. His soldiersfollowed his orders, but Utros had always done his best to do as Iron Fanginstructed. Now, even though death separated them, the general vowed he would dono less.“My armies continue to press our siege, but the wizards of Ildakar are powerful.I don’t know if I have the weapons necessary to tear down the city just yet.” Heclimbed to his feet and stood as a military commander should. “But I will find away to conquer Ildakar.”Kurgan spoke in a harsh voice. “If your army is too weak and you don’t have theproper weapons, then get more powerful weapons.” He snorted. “I know of thesilver dragon you captured. Another failure of yours! You should have used thedragon to destroy the city, to grind those people under fire and terror. Don’tfail me again. If you are as great a general as you claim, why not captureanother dragon? That shouldn’t be impossible.”Majel turned away. “Loyalty is stronger than love.”Utros swallowed and forced himself to repeat her words, for Kurgan’s benefit:“Loyalty is stronger than love.” His thoughts began turning as other parts ofhis mind pondered tactics, possibilities. “I will discuss the matter with mysorceresses. I had not considered calling another dragon, but that might bepossible.”He had to try. Maybe at long last he would achieve his victory over Ildakar."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 52 [contents.xhtml#c_ch52]“We cannot defeat them,” said Damon, sounding so reasonable. He seemed morerelaxed with Nicci gone. “We have known this for fifteen centuries.”The wizard stood before the duma members, pacing restlessly back and forth onthe blue marble tiles. The long mustaches on either side of his mouth droopedwith a stylish affectation, each one tipped with a ruby bead knotted through thethin hairs. “When we sent out our best strike force against General Utros, wemassacred many of the enemy, but we also lost nearly a third of our fighters.”He gestured generally toward the high windows that looked out upon the distantbattlefield. “And untold numbers of the enemy remain.”Still seated, Nathan frowned in consternation, disappointed. He knew that Nicciwould have scolded the wizard for his defeatist attitude. He cleared his throatand spoke up. “What you say can’t be denied, Damon, and I understand theuneasiness in your hearts.” Subconsciously, he rubbed the scar on hisbreastbone. “But the same could have been said about the Imperial Order, orSulachan’s undead army, and yet they were both defeated. You can’t give up.”On the seat beside him, Elsa gave him an appreciative smile and patted his arm.“Ildakar does not give up. We can be stronger than ever.”The duma members were exhausted, having slept little in recent days, and despitetheir endless discussions, they had found no ingenious solution. Nathanconsidered the Ixax warriors again, but he didn’t think the titans were readyyet.Quentin left the stone table to join his fellow wizard in the speaking area,showing solidarity with Damon. “We have to face facts, even if we don’t likewhat they reveal. The soldiers are constantly pounding on our walls, andalthough our reinforcement spells continue to hold, they cannot last forever.Our defenses may have seemed invincible when we built them thousands of yearsago, but even the stone must eventually crumble. We can’t hide here forever.”“We defeated General Utros before,” Oron pointed out. “Is our city weaker now?”In annoyed distraction, he picked at a plate of sweetened pastries, selectedone, and took a small bite.“Of course we are weaker!” Damon snapped. “During our greatest days, imaginewhat the wizards of Ildakar did. They raised this city high above the river,created the cliffs, flooded the swamps and filled them with monsters. Wepetrified the entire army. Could any of us do that now? Our gifted nobles arenot what they once were.”“But Ildakar is free,” interjected Rendell, who usually didn’t speak during themeetings. The other wizards scorned him and ignored his comment.“We no longer have the wizard commander,” Quentin said. “Maxim was one of themost powerful wizards in our history, and he is gone. He developed thepetrification spell that saved us before. Andre is dead. Ivan is dead. Renn isgone. Even Nicci has left us!”“Well, my friends, you do have me,” Nathan said with a wry smile. “My gift isstrong. Let us not give up hope.”“And Renn might come home soon,” Lani said. She now wore a blue silk robe overher pale, hard skin. “If he found Cliffwall, maybe the archive there will offersomething even more powerful than a petrification spell. We can use it againstGeneral Utros.”“I like the man well enough,” Olgya said with a frown, “but Renn always struckme as somewhat, ah, lackluster. I’m not convinced he managed to find Cliffwallat all.”Lani looked ready to defend the wizard she loved, but Elsa broke in. “Renn leftIldakar before the stone army awakened, so he has no idea about our crisis. Hewouldn’t know what to look for.”Rendell spoke up again. “Ildakar will fight together in ways it never didbefore, but we need to know how. We have a large population, and many arewilling to join our defenders if we give them armor and weapons. But we can’tsimply throw fighters against the siege force. No matter how brave we are, wewould lose!”“We would die,” Oron corrected.“That is a valid definition of losing,” Nathan said in an acerbic tone.An unexpected female voice came from the doorway. “You have me.”With a rustle of armor and heavy boots, two Ildakaran guards led a slender womanin a dress of flowing green silk. Her stiff hair was done up in an elaboratesculpture of braids and ringlets. Her skin was as pale as Lani’s.Nathan and Elsa lurched to their feet, but Damon turned to greet Thora,extending his arm in a welcoming gesture. “Quentin and I asked for the sovrenato be brought here.”“She is no longer the sovrena,” Lani said.“She is still a very powerful sorceress, regardless,” Quentin said. “We shouldnot underestimate her powers. We need all the help we can get.”Thora walked two paces ahead of the guards, as if leading them. Her hands werebound with thick ropes and chains, but the restraints were merely for show.Thora had proven that she could easily break free with magic if she so chose.“When I let myself be captured at the wall, I vowed that I would fight forIldakar. This is my city. My heart is the heart of Ildakar.” She entered theopen speaking floor without a glance at her now-empty throne. “When I escaped,my anger caused a kind of madness in me. I did consider joining General Utros tobetray Ildakar, and I am ashamed. That will never happen.” She looked at themwith her green eyes, strong and confident. “But my gift is powerful, and I canhelp.”“Help with what?” Nathan tried to control his uneasiness. “Please explain.”Elsa’s face was flushed with anger. “You think you can return to our goodgraces? Damon, Quentin, and I sentenced you because of your crimes againstIldakar.”“Ildakar is in a different situation now,” Quentin said, embarrassed. “Adesperate one.”Damon cleared his throat and said to the duma, “We have an idea to propose,something we have to consider as our circumstances grow worse.”Quentin continued in what was obviously a rehearsed presentation with hisfriend. “We attacked General Utros and stung him like a wasp, but that wasp willbe swatted. He is bound to attack us. We bother him so little that he hasdispatched a quarter of his army on other conquests. He knows he will crush us,given time. Will we just wait for it to happen?”Olgya snorted. “And how exactly do you suggest we use Thora to defeat him?”The former sovrena turned her gaze to all the duma members. “That is a mistakenassumption. We don’t have to defeat Utros to keep Ildakar safe. The solution hasbeen right in front of us all along.” She raised her voice. “How did we staysafe for fifteen hundred years?”“The enemy army was turned to stone,” Lani said. “But we cannot restore thatspell on such a scale.”“No, not that.” Quentin sniffed impatiently. “Ildakar would be saved if we justraised the shroud of eternity again. The city could retreat safely into time aswe did so many centuries ago. Then it wouldn’t matter what General Utros did.”The proposal left the ruling chamber in sudden silence. “But the pyramid isdestroyed,” Elsa said. “All the apparatus is gone.”Damon said, “I’m a shaper, and I could re-create the equipment. We know how todo the blood magic.”Oron pondered. “That might work. We could hide for a few centuries, and by thenthe general’s army would be long gone. None of our concern.”Rendell was aghast at the suggestion. “But … all that bloodshed!”“We just returned to the world,” Elsa said. “We would be trapped again.”“We would be safe,” Damon insisted.“Dear spirits, that would not be a good idea at all,” Nathan said. “You have toconsider more than just this city. If Ildakar vanished, that huge army wouldrange across the entire continent and wreak havoc on city after city.”“But Ildakar would be safe and intact,” Quentin said with a satisfied smile.“The rest of the world has to defend itself.”Nathan was appalled. “But all the blood sacrifices! That might be a massacregreater than any attack we could expect from Utros.”“Yes, it would take a tremendous bloodworking, just as it did before,” Thorasaid. “Thousands of volunteers. Think of how many people will die if the wallsfall and Utros ransacks the city! We cannot let that happen. Better to spend theblood of the people to save the people. I know that enough devoted citizenswould make the right choice. Let them decide.”“And you will need my help to accomplish it.” Thora lifted her delicate wriststo show the heavy bindings there. “I swore I would do what was necessary to helpmy city. I meant it.”Nathan heard muttering around the chamber. He looked in alarm at Elsa, who hadgone pale. Lani said, “But we have to wait for my Renn to come back.”“We will wait until it is truly the last resort,” Quentin replied, soundingreasonable, just like Damon. “But for the good of Ildakar, we have to considerour options. Rather than let this city fall into enemy hands, we know what wehave to do. Unless someone can think of another way to defeat General Utros?”“I don’t like this,” Nathan muttered. “Dear spirits, I don’t like this at all.”Maybe when Nicci returned from Tanimura through the sliph, she would bringhopeful news, and they could have a different discussion.“There is no reason we can’t prepare,” Damon suggested in a smooth voice. “Wewill spread the word throughout the city, start the people thinking about who iswilling to become heroes to save our city by shedding their blood.”Oron stood. “That is enough discussion for now. We all need food and rest. Weare not thinking straight anymore.”Lani said in a hard voice, “Thora can’t be allowed to remain free, no matterwhat she promises. Take her back to her cell.”“At least for now,” Olgya said.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Uneasy about the duma’s considerations, Nathan went back to visit the Ixaxwarriors. This time, he carried a disturbing book he had discovered in Andre’slibrary, an old diary. In the destruction of the villa, the shelves hadcollapsed and the volumes were scattered, but Nathan had read the journal withwidening eyes.He understood far more about these towering invincible warriors and everythingthey had sacrificed to become the Ixax.As he walked into the chamber where the colossal figures stood, Nathan placed acalm smile on his face. He knew the two giants were watching him, and he wantedto keep them at ease. They focused on him each time he came to converse withthem. For many days he had told the silent figures stories, regaling them withlegends, even exaggerating some of his own exploits. The armored warriors knewNathan Rahl as a person now, and he hoped the Ixax also remembered who they hadbeen as humans.Andre’s diary emphasized the fact with even more poignancy than anything Nathanhad told them before. He held up the old journal with its brittle, brown pages.“I know who you are now. This is a diary written centuries ago in the hand ofFleshmancer Andre himself. It is from when the army of General Utros first laidsiege to Ildakar, when the wizards were desperate for any means to save thecity. Do you remember?”He sat on a broken pillar of marble and flipped the discolored pages, skimmingthe scrawled handwriting. “Let me read you some of what he wrote. ‘I fear ourcity will fall. All of Ildakar is in panic. The wizards seek a way to fight backagainst this enormous horde. Our walls are strong, and our magic is strong, butthe army of General Utros is like a swarm of locusts. Even if all our people goout and fight to the death, it will not be enough. We need stronger warriors,and I can create them.’”Nathan smiled up at the armored giants. He tapped the words with his fingertip.“You were afraid too, weren’t you? You knew you had to protect your families,and when the desperate call went out, three of you agreed to give up your livesand your loved ones for the sake of Ildakar.” Though neither of the Ixax movedat all, he imagined that they nodded.Nathan turned the pages, summarizing the words. “Andre says he chose you frommore than a dozen volunteers to become the mighty Ixax. Do you remember yournames? Do they sound familiar?” He looked up. “Jonathan, Rald, and Denn. Youwere young men, talented fighters. Andre says that you were the pick of yourcommanders, that you all excelled in personal combat.”Nathan didn’t know which one of the three he had killed, which two remained, buthe was sure all three volunteers had known each other well. “Jonathan had a wifenamed Maria and a daughter who was sick. As part of the agreement, the wizardsagreed to heal the little girl once he volunteered to become an Ixax.” He lookeddown at the pages, at the descriptions. “Rald had a sweetheart, but he broke offhis relationship because he believed this was a greater duty.” Nathan felt alump in his throat. “And Denn came from a large family with four brothers andthree sisters. He was the youngest, a recruit for the army of Ildakar. Hisfamily was so proud of him.”He looked down again at the pages of Andre’s diary. The fleshmancer had viewedRald, Jonathan, and Denn as mere specimens, test subjects, not as tragic humanbeings. He had ignored their bravery and everything they were giving up. Nathandecided not to read that part of the diary aloud to them.The fleshmancer described the transformative magic he had used, how he unleashedenergy to make the young men’s bones grow like trees, their muscles swell andexpand, their bodies becoming giants through a combination of fleshmancy andmetallurgy. Andre had reinforced their bones with bronze, added armor to theirflesh in order to turn the warriors into something more than human. But Nathanknew they were still human inside.“You agreed to fight for Ildakar,” he said. “But you never got your chance.Andre was an unkind, heartless man. I know that, as do you. He tormented youneedlessly.” He brushed his pale hair away from his cheek and closed the book.He knew what was written there, but he didn’t want to read any more of thefleshmancer’s petulant complaints against the old duma for not letting himunleash his monstrous warriors.“Your reasons were pure,” Nathan reminded the giants. “I know that your heartsremember. Even though your families, your sweethearts, your children are longgone, Ildakar still needs you. If the time comes, I hope you remember the realreason that you gave up so much. There are good people here, just as you weregood people.”Nathan waited in silence for a long moment, then stood. “I will come back, Ipromise. I’ll tell you more stories.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 53 [contents.xhtml#c_ch53]As the cold dawn washed over the mountains, Verna shaded her eyes. Because ofthe ancient army camped beneath the glaciers, she no longer saw the beauty ofKol Adair. She now knew that the enemy soldiers weren’t quite human, and theywere on the move from Ildakar, thousands of them. The army had no visible tents,fires, or supplies, just a powerful force moving through the mountains. Theprelate could only imagine how much destruction they would cause as they crossedthe Old World.“It is not natural,” General Zimmer said. His face was ruddy, and beads ofperspiration stood out on his brow. “The D’Haran army is sworn to fight theenemies of Lord Rahl, and there’s no doubt it is an invasion force.”“But where are they going?” Verna asked. “Who is their commander?”“They have gone away from Ildakar,” Renn said. “Maybe that is a good thing, froma certain point of view?”“There is nothing good about this.” Captain Trevor shook his head. “What can wedo to stop them? We are only a handful against thousands.”Amber continued to stare, her face flushed. “What if they find Cliffwall?”As the early-morning light spilled over the crags, the enemy army began to stir.Verna said quietly, “We need to hurry, General, whatever we do. Right now, theyare vulnerable. They don’t suspect we have seen them.”“Why should they care about a few dozen people anyway?” Renn asked. “We areinsignificant.”“We’re not insignificant,” Verna said, “and neither are you, Renn. You are awizard of Ildakar. I am a Sister of the Light. Even young Amber knows some basicmagic, as do these Cliffwall scholars.” She gestured to the wide-eyed scholarsand memmers who had accompanied them from the canyon archive. “They wanted tolearn how to use magic. Now the time has come, and we can’t wait.”“You want to attack thousands of ancient soldiers with magic?” Renn soundedskeptical. “What would you suggest? Do you have spells that can wipe out an armyof half-petrified warriors? I would love to learn them!”“It would be folly to attack an enemy army of that size with a handful ofspells,” Verna said. “We must try something else.”“What did you have in mind, Prelate?” Zimmer asked. “Give me a viable battleplan.”Sheltered by the sparse trees, she looked to the cliffs above the largeencampment, where morning sunlight dazzled on the snow hanging on the steepslope. “We don’t fight the army directly.” She narrowed her eyes as she pointedup. “We use the glaciers as our weapon.”Renn chuckled. “That might indeed have sufficient force. Good idea, Prelate. Isee that Nicci is not the only woman with a ruthless imagination when faced witha powerful enemy.”Verna sent word among the rest of the Sisters of the Light, Oliver and Peretta,and the gifted and studious scholars from Cliffwall. They all hurriedly gatheredaround, knowing they would miss their chance once the army moved.Renn rubbed his chubby hands together in the brisk morning chill, his eyesbright. “Fifteen centuries ago, General Utros laid siege to Ildakar, and this ismy chance to strike a real blow. At last I can be a true hero to my city.”General Zimmer was all business. “What do you need from my soldiers, Prelate?”Verna considered the high wall of packed snow and ice that had collected abovewhere the thousands of enemy soldiers had gathered. As the army madepreparations to pack up camp, she knew all those fighting men would cross KolAdair and march down to the high desert plains. With their sheer numbers, somescouting expedition would surely discover the hidden canyon, where they wouldfind and overwhelm the Cliffwall archive.“They are in a perfect position now. We have to stop them before they move out,”she said. The rising sun sparkled on the glacial ice fields. “General, havescouts take all our gifted up near the glaciers without being seen.” She glancedat Renn’s rich maroon robes. “Is there a way you can be less obvious?”He frowned at the lush fabric he wore. “If you insist.” He released his gift,and the deep maroon shifted into a mottled gray and white that would beinvisible up in the tundra. “Not my preference, but it will do.”The soldiers were ready to help in any way possible. Captain Trevor stepped upto Zimmer. “My men and I wish to fight for Ildakar.”“You’ll have your chance, Captain,” Renn said, with a glance at Verna, “butright now it is time for a wizard. Leave it to the prelate and me.”At a fast pace, D’Haran scouts led the way around the bowl and up the slopes tothe ice fields. Verna and Renn, the Sisters and the gifted scholars picked theirway among the forest deadfall, climbing through sparse trees and over boulders,higher into the rocky cliffs. Below, as the day warmed and illuminated therugged valley, the ancient army began to form ranks for the next march. AlthoughVerna was out of breath, she urged the climbers to greater speed. “If we don’tget to the glacier soon, we will miss our chance.”Scouts raced ahead, finding the easiest routes. “That way ends in a blindcliff,” one man said, gesturing them back. “We have to go down to that spine ofrock and then up into those adjacent bands. See where it picks up?” Some of theCliffwall scholars muttered in dismay, but Verna pressed on.Renn was breathing hard in the thin air. “I hope I have the strength to use mymagic once we get there.”“You will,” Verna replied, “you have to.”Finally, the scouts guided them through huge talus boulders covered with patchesof old snow. Ahead, they looked at the broken hummocks of the glacier field.Each winter the snowfall in the mountains covered the peaks, and even highsummer didn’t melt it completely, leaving layers that built year after year.Now, heavy glaciers hung poised above the bowl where the army was breaking camp.Verna’s heart skipped a beat. “Hurry! We need to use our magic.”Sister Rhoda’s brow was furrowed with concern. “Now that we’re here, Prelate,how do we shove this mountainside of ice and snow down on them?”“Consider the problem in smaller pieces,” Verna said. “We can’t move all of thesnow, but we can release heat. We melt pockets at the bottom, flash the snowinto steam, release loose sections. The water itself will lubricate the higherlayers of the glacier.” She gestured to large fissures. “It’s already justwaiting to slide down in an avalanche.”She fell silent and closed her eyes. “You can sense the power here. We just needto nudge it. Once it starts, the steam will widen the fissures, and the restwill take care of itself.” She smiled, showing grim confidence. “Nature wants tomove this glacier down the steep slope. We merely have to encourage it.”Renn smiled. “By the Keeper’s beard, I see what you’re saying. We can do it.”Oliver nodded. “We learned how to boil water for tea, so we will do the samething but on a larger scale.”Amber stared across the ice field and pointed upward. “Start with that sectionup there, near the edge. When the cornice comes down, the rest of the glacierwall should fall behind it.”“Then let’s not waste time,” Renn said. He gestured with his hands, closed hiseyes, and released his powerful gift with a sizzle in the air.Below in the hanging valley, Verna could hear the loud voices of enemy soldiersas they prepared to move out. She extended her gift into the piles of packedsnow and ice and let her magic go into the widening cracks in the blue ice. Shereleased her heat, felt the water melt.The Cliffwall scholars did the same. The Sisters of the Light pushed, releasingwaves of warmth that crisscrossed the glacier field like hot knives. Pockets ofsteam boiled up, expanding weak voids. Puffs of white vapor coughed out ofsofter pockets in the snow.Like a shattering tree creaking and cracking, the glacier wall spread apart.Beneath it, warm water mixed with boulders and glacial debris to form a soup ofmud and melted snow.Verna felt a thrill of excitement. Nearby, Renn clenched his left hand into afist and gestured in the air, as if the motion helped him hurl his magic withgreater force. With a booming crack, the piled cornice of snow on the high cliffshuddered free and slid down the rock face.That was just the beginning.Mists of steam curled from the sliding glacier. Sheets of ice shifted and slidforward to crash into the next section of ice, knocking it loose. The Sistersand their trainees concentrated on the front wall, heating the dark boulderstrapped inside the ice so that they, too, created pockets of steam, melting moreice.In the bowl beneath the glacier, thousands of enemy soldiers saw the frozenmountainside shifting and sliding toward them like a living thing. Their outcryechoed into the air as loud as the avalanche.Verna continued to release her gift, melting more sections of the iceunderneath, and soon the entire glacier shoved itself forward, picking upmomentum as it rumbled down the mountain with a catastrophic roar.Beside her, Amber squeezed her eyes shut, clenched her hands, and rhythmicallypounded the ground, trying to melt more and more of the snow. Verna touched herwrist, stopped her. “That’s enough, child. We’ve done it.”Amber opened her eyes and turned to watch as the nightmare of snow blocks andice slabs brought half the mountain down with it. The roar was deafening. Steamand snow spray poured up like a thunderstorm into the air.The stone army was trapped in the hanging valley, and the glacier buried them inan avalanche that was centuries in the making.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Long after the expeditionary army had been inundated, Verna sat back, shaking,not from exertion, but from the realization of what she had done.Renn seemed delighted. “Oh, that was magnificent! Exactly what a wizard ofIldakar should do.”Verna watched as the snow and ice continued to settle, as rocks pattered downfrom the now-naked patch of cliff. The invasion force was entirely buried. “Itwas what we needed to do,” she said."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 54 [contents.xhtml#c_ch54]As the most powerful sorceress in Lord Rahl’s army, Nicci was feared andrespected. She had once murdered a wizard and stolen his abilities, had learnedthe Subtractive side of magic through her dark service to the Keeper, and shehad become known as Death’s Mistress.Thus, when she presented her warning about Utros and his vast army, the D’Harangarrison believed her. General Linden brought in military scribes to take downher report in detail, and within hours copies were dispatched by two separateriders racing north to the People’s Palace. Nicci could crush petty dictatorsand slave masters, but defeating hundreds of thousands of warriors went beyondwhat she could deal with alone.But she didn’t have to do everything alone. It had taken her a long time torealize that.General Linden gathered a succession of his line officers, foot soldiers,cavalry riders, and scouts, so she could show them the terrifying imagespreserved in Elsa’s glass. “I want them all to know,” Linden said. “The more ourarmy understands the scope of this threat, the better prepared they’ll be toface it.”Nicci walked slowly along the lines of soldiers gathered inside the garrisonwalls, showing them the images, and she saw that she had struck fear—notgibbering terror, but a genuine respect. By nightfall she had accomplished whatshe needed to do and decided it was time to return to Ildakar.She had to make sure the walled city was still safe against the siege. If so,Nicci would travel through the sliph to other large cities along the coast andcontinue spreading her warning.Because it was already after dark, Nicci would not enter the dense and tracklessHagen Woods in the hope of finding the isolated sliph well. Instead, sheinformed Linden, “I will sleep in the barracks and leave at dawn.”“It must be a long journey to Ildakar,” Linden said. “Do you need supplies? Amilitary escort?”“I have other means of travel.”He found her a private room in the officers’ quarters, which were redolent offresh sawdust and green pine. The sweet wood fragrance contrasted with thefishy-smelling kraken-oil lantern that burned on the writing desk. Nicci openedthe window shutters to let the cool night breeze drift in. With a flick of herfingers, she snuffed out the lantern from the other side of the room and settledback on the straw mattress. She needed no further comforts. As Nicci driftedoff, she cleared her thoughts of strategy, concerns about Ildakar’s defensesagainst General Utros, and the loss of Bannon Farmer. She would sleep.When she descended into resistant dreams, she felt an animal presence waitingthere, a feline awareness that was bound to her. Mrra. Though Tanimura was faron the other side of the Old World, the sand panther remembered Nicci in herdreams.They ran together. Her wiry muscles pulled her along as she bounded with herhind legs to land on her wide front paws, feeling the curved claws dig into theturf. Nicci felt the joy of being part of the big cat’s fine, muscular body. Shewas exerting herself to her wild limits, fiercely running.She quickly realized that Mrra was not hunting, and the cat’s pounding heart wasmore than just the joy of racing free. She was terrified.Monstrous predators were pursuing the sand panther. Mrra ran along the hills,each leap a desperate attempt to escape. Her long tail thrashed, her claws toreup the dirt. She leaped over a fallen tree as she raced along the black fringeof the burned grass. Her sharp ears heard panting and slavering behind her, likethe bellows in a blacksmith shop.Two huge creatures ran after her, each as large as a small horse, drippingsaliva from yellow fangs. They were ferocious and intent on tearing her apart.Mrra ran with all her might. Behind her, the creatures thundered along, theirjaws and fangs ready to rip her flank, tear out her throat.Mrra glanced back, and her golden eyes saw the pursuers, huge wolflike beastswith rounded ears, long heads, and tan fur that made them hard to see among thedry grasses. They snarled, springing forward. Mrra put on another burst ofspeed, and Nicci offered her own energy, driving the panther faster. But Mrrawas exhausted, nearly ready to collapse.Nicci could only guess what those beasts might be. She’d heard Richard describeheart hounds, vicious creatures that guarded the misty boundaries and the veilto the underworld. The more Nicci recalled his stories, the more convinced shebecame that these were heart hounds. Had they somehow slipped through the veil?But Richard had sealed it! The walls of the underworld should never have allowedsuch monsters to return.Mrra dashed into a thicket of scrub oak. She clattered through fallen branchesand leaped over a lichen-mottled boulder. The heart hounds rushed into thethicket after her and kept drawing closer.Nicci knew Mrra couldn’t elude them, whether in the forests or in the grassyhills. Heart hounds had senses so acute they could hear a victim’s heartbeateven from a distance. Richard had also said the monsters would tear out theheart of their prey and devour it first as a bloody prize.Nicci rode inside Mrra, pushed her, helped her, but she was in far-off Tanimura,and she couldn’t extend her gift through the big cat. She could only use the bigpanther’s body.Running would not be enough.There was no place to hide in the grassy hills, even in the darkness.The heart hounds kept coming.Nicci stirred in her sleep in the barracks room, but her thoughts stayed withthe panther. The big cat’s instincts told her to do what any fleeing animalwould do, but if she did that, Nicci knew, she would lose.Listen to me, sister panther, Nicci thought. The heart hounds will run you down.You can’t fight both of them. They will wait until you are exhausted and weak.She felt Mrra growl as she ran. The grassy slope opened up, and Mrra boundedalong unhindered, but the heart hounds picked up speed, too.You’ve got to do the unexpected, Nicci told her. You have to fight them anyway,so fight on your terms. Our terms. Now! Turn and fight!The panther spun and, instead of leaping away, used all the power of her hindlegs to launch herself into the oncoming beast like a battering ram of claws andfur. Mrra struck just beneath the jaw of the slavering monster, slammed into itsbarrel chest. Her claws raked along the curved lines of its ribs. Using theheart hound’s own momentum, she ripped open the tan fur, gouged into bone, andsplit the creature’s chest. As it crashed down upon her, she clamped her longfangs around its throat, bit down hard, and pulled back. Blood sprayed.The heart hound collapsed, gurgling, unable to make much sound now that itsthroat was destroyed. Mrra’s instinct was to stay with her victim, rip open thebelly and dig out the entrails, but the monster was already as good as dead.Nicci knew that.Instead, Mrra yanked herself free as the heart hound twitched and bled,impotently snapping its long yellow teeth.The second beast skidded past, taken by surprise, and overshot its quarry evenas Mrra brought down the first victim. As the other monster scrambled to turn,Mrra abandoned the bleeding carcass and, using all her remaining energy, spranginto the air to land on the second beast’s back. The heart hound was already offbalance from turning so abruptly in its full-hearted charge. Mrra’s weightknocked it down on the grassy ground, and the beast struck out with its paws,trying to throw her off.But Nicci and Mrra bit down hard, using the big cat’s powerful jaws to crunchthe back of the heart hound’s neck, biting hard enough to sever its spinal cord.With one blow, one deep bite, the second heart hound was paralyzed. When itcollapsed, the lower half of its body couldn’t even twitch. A steaming puddle ofurine pooled out from between its hind legs. In an instant, both enemies weredead.Mrra stepped back, covered in blood. She padded away from the two dying beasts,her senses still alert. She pricked her ears and listened to the night, makingsure there were no other heart hounds howling in the hills.Even from her bed in the Tanimura barracks, Nicci tasted the hot iron blood inher mouth, felt her pulse pounding from the chase. She and her sister pantherhad defeated these two creatures that shouldn’t have been here at all. Hadsomeone meddled with the veil after Richard’s star shift? How could thesemonsters have escaped from the outskirts of the underworld?Nicci broke the spell bond, letting Mrra return to satisfy herself with rippingthe heart hounds to shreds. Nicci drifted back into her own sleep, but it wasfar more troubled than before."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 55 [contents.xhtml#c_ch55]The lens to the underworld had faded to misty green opacity, but rumors spreadthroughout the camp. General Utros withdrew into his headquarters, lost inthoughts and questions. He felt the weight of history, responsibility, and hisiron-hard betrayal.The ancient army continued its daily routine, maintaining the siege. Scoutsworked their way through the hills and forests, mapping the landscape andmarking towns to be raided or conquered. They delivered summaries to FirstCommander Enoch, who kept the information to himself until such time as thegeneral requested it.Even the sorceresses left Utros to his intense concentration. Ava and Ruva hadalways given him advice, offered ideas, but now he brooded in his headquarters,so deep in thought he seemed to have become a statue again. He sat withshoulders hunched on the sturdy wooden bench, leaning close to the smolderingbrazier. Smoke curled around his scarred face, fumes burned his eyes and nose.Without interrupting his thoughts, the twins added various substances, blackmineral powders that stung when he inhaled, but made him light-headed. Utros satin silence, feeling his heart torn, his mind separated into opposing vows,obligations, and desires.Loyalty is stronger than love.But, he loved Majel! He still heard her voice, remembered her touch, though hehad seen her face and knew what Iron Fang had done to her, and that was theemperor Utros had sworn to obey! Yet, Majel had broken her sacred vow, too, justas he had. Not only had the general torn his loyalty to shreds, he had alsostolen the love of his leader’s wife. What punishment was too great for that?Utros hunched over the brazier smoke, closed his eyes, and pressed sharpfingernails against his face, feeling the scar from the dragon burn. Maybe hedeserved to be flayed alive, too. What if Emperor Kurgan demanded that of him?Loyalty is stronger than love.He sat up, reaching a firm decision, a tactical decision. He was General Utros.That was why Iron Fang considered him so important, and that was why he neededto succeed here at Ildakar. It was the only way he could atone for his greatbetrayal.The two sorceresses sat in silence on the other side of the room, so close toeach other that their pale bodies touched, the matching scars on their thighsclose, as when they had been fused as children. Though the twins had been cutapart, their hearts, their thoughts, and their magic still connected them.When he looked up at the sisters with a decision clear on his face, Ava and Ruvacould see that their beloved general had come back to them. His cool andrational military mind had returned.“Our emperor made his wishes clear,” he said. “You heard him speak from beyondthe veil. My charge, our charge, is still to bring down Ildakar. Our entire armyis duty-bound to make that happen.” The two women sat motionless, meeting hisflinty glare. “Iron Fang commanded me to find a way to summon a dragon. Forthat, I will need your help.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------General Utros respected magic, treated it as one would handle a poisonous viper,and he let Ava and Ruva do their work. The twins spoke in whispers, sharingideas, finishing each other’s sentences. Moving in eerie synchronicity, theytalked about how to find a dragon.Even fifteen centuries ago, the majestic and terrifying beasts had beenextremely rare. On the march toward Ildakar, he had sought out a silver dragon,because such dragons were the most warlike, the most destructive in battle.Silver dragons were also the most difficult to control. Finally, they hadsucceeded in capturing one of the creatures, a small one, but still a nightmareof metallic scales and fangs, belching fire and acid. Its huge wings could knockdown tents and create a wind strong enough to sweep aside a cavalry charge.After they had chained the monster, Utros realized he could never tame it, notwith time, nor magic.The silver dragon had chewed through its chains and burst out of itsconfinement. In a vengeful fury, the creature had burned hundreds of hissoldiers, scorching them to ash, before ripping up the camp. Utros had tried tochallenge the dragon himself and force it back into captivity, and as a resultthe beast had burned the side of his face with a splash of its acid fire.Now he reached up and ran his fingers across the healed scar that covered hischeek. Emperor Kurgan had commanded him to capture a dragon again.Ava and Ruva came to him as he stood outside, contemplating the large milky lensto the underworld and dreading his next conversation with Majel or Kurgan. Heturned to acknowledge them. “We found a way, beloved Utros,” Ava said, her voicefaltering. “We can summon a dragon.”Ruva smiled shyly. “It will be painful and dangerous.”His heart felt blank and empty. “As I expected, but pain and danger are ourcharge.”The two women stepped close like lovers awaiting an embrace. Ava reached up tostroke his scarred cheek. “In order to find a dragon, we need a connection todragons. They are distant and rare. The nearest one may be far, far away.”Ruva said, “But you are already connected with dragons, beloved Utros. When thedragon fire burned you and left the scar, it also left part of its essence inyou. Dragons are bound to the heart of the world itself, intertwined withmagic.” She also touched the scar, next to her sister’s fingers. “Part of thatlingers here on your face. Your skin bears the faint residue of dragon fire, anddragon fire is connected to dragons themselves.”Ava added, “We can use that residue to send a summons that no dragon couldresist, if any dragons remain in this land.”Ruva’s eyes sparkled with tears. “We have everything we need, General, if youare willing to endure the sacrifice.”“Emperor Kurgan commanded me. I will sacrifice whatever is needed.”The sorceresses placed their delicate fingertips on his waxy flesh. “All we needis your skin, beloved Utros.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Inside the dark wooden structure, the two women built the brazier fires high.They had sealed the doors and windows so that not even First Commander Enochcould see what was happening, nor would any of the soldiers hear his screams.With the lingering effects of the stone spell, the sensitive nerves on his facewere dulled, but not numb enough. He felt the searing pain when the twosorceresses used a razor-edged knife to slice away the scarred half of his face.He braced himself, sitting in the sturdy chair built out of logs lashedtogether, but as he clenched the arms, the thick logs creaked. His wrists hadbeen tied to the chair, his chest also strapped to the back, rendering himimmobile. He felt as if he might explode from the bonds.“Just a few moments more,” Ava said, being as gentle as she could.“We are so sorry,” Ruva whispered as the sharp dagger tip traced a deep cutunder his eye, around his cheekbone, then over to his ear. She peeled down everso delicately, while Ava tugged on the flap of waxy skin with another knife,pulling his cheek and half of his face away.Utros groaned deep in his chest and realized that this was what Majel hadendured, only her punishment had been far worse. Iron Fang had not only strippedone cheek, but all of her face, then her neck, breasts, back, and thighs, allthe skin on her body. Majel had endured that, and she had still been alive whenhe fed her body to flesh beetles. Utros knew he could tolerate this smallersacrifice.Loyalty is stronger than love.The sorceresses had a shallow basin filled with water next to the brazier. Whenthey finally succeeded in cutting off all the skin that had been marked bydragon fire, they took the uneven scrap of flesh, held it up like part of amask, and dropped it into the basin, gently washing it, letting the blood infusethe water.“That is the first step, beloved Utros,” Ava said.When the skin was clean and the water tinted red, Ruva removed the thin scrap ofhis cheek and tossed it into the brazier, where it burned. Ava added crystallinepowders that made the fires blaze brighter, consuming the scrap of skin. Itshriveled and blackened like leather.Using her gift, Ruva damped the flames so she could remove the charred skin.“Now it is ready,” she said, dropping the remnants back into the basin with theblood water.The burned skin crumbled, the ashes dissolving, and the two women peered downinto the basin, swirling the water with their fingertips. They began to chant.The small chamber was filled with magic, pulsing and sparkling, as they sent outtheir implacable call to summon a dragon."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 56 [contents.xhtml#c_ch56]In the duma chamber, while Quentin reviewed lists of names that hisrepresentatives had gathered from among the population, Nathan and Elsa workedside by side, sharing ideas in low voices. They had not yet openly raised thesuggestion of the Ixax warriors to the duma.Though the hour was late, Lani also joined them, her skin pale and hard. Nathanknew little about her, but she had challenged Thora for her rule, and that madeLani a decent person, as far as he was concerned.Without explaining her actions, Lani walked up to the stone table and picked upthe pitcher of water left for the duma members. Nathan looked up, curious. “Ithought you didn’t need to drink or eat?”Lani looked down into the water in the pitcher. “This is a weapon. It’s my ownmagic.”“I remember your scrying magic.” Elsa smiled and turned to Nathan. “It issimilar to my transference magic, but Lani has an affinity for water. She cancall on it, use it as a conduit, like the aqueducts beneath Ildakar.”“That gift comes from within me. My blood is infused with it.” Lani caressed thecurve of the pitcher. “Renn and I would share the things we read in obscuretexts, and we discovered many forgotten legends and spells. Thora didn’t muchcare about our studies. She considered herself at the pinnacle of her strengthand did not need to learn anything else.”“One should always keep learning,” Nathan said. “Even when I was stuck in thePalace of the Prophets for a thousand years, I continued to read and study.” Hestroked his chin. “Actually, my reasons weren’t entirely altruistic. I washoping to discover a way to escape my prison, so I could live my own life.”“I am glad you finally succeeded, Nathan,” Elsa said. “I rather like having youhere.”“I can help Ildakar, now that I have the heart of a wizard again.”“But is your gift powerful enough to stop General Utros?” Lani asked.“Not alone, of course.” He self-consciously brushed the front of his wizard’srobes. “But surely with everyone joining their magic, we can defeat an oldgeneral and a half-petrified army.”“Only if we are aware of what the enemy is doing.” Lani turned with the pitcherand surprised them by pouring the water in a spreading pool onto the bluemarble.Nathan yanked his feet up so the water wouldn’t splash on his boots. At theopposite table, Quentin looked up from his list of names. He grumbledimpatiently, then went back to his work.Lani knelt next to the spreading pool on the polished floor. “I can use scryingmagic to spy on our enemy. I can see what Utros is doing, if he has open waternearby.” She sighed. “I wish Renn were here. He always gave me strength, but Iwill do it without him.” She looked up and met Elsa’s eyes. “I’ll do it forhim.”“He will return someday,” Elsa said.Lani held her hands over the water and called upon her gift, making imagesappear. Thora had used the same magic, scrying through the water basins inIldakar as an illicit way to spy on her own people. “General Utros will notsuspect. I just need to find water, close to him.…”Lani closed her eyes, holding her chalk-white hands above the surface of thepool. She pulled on her gift and pressed her hands lower, until with thefaintest of touches, her fingers met the still surface. The images sharpened,and she opened her eyes again.Curious, Nathan could see shadows forming, and he recognized the place where heand Nicci had spoken to the general in their parley session. “That is hisheadquarters.”Lani narrowed her eyes. “This is what Utros is doing right now, what he issaying, what he is seeing. I am looking through a water basin in his quarters.”Her voice dropped to a whisper, and her expression grew more intent.The rippling images stilled, and the pool looked like a mirror on the floor.Through the water, Nathan saw Ava and Ruva, their heads shaved, their white skinpainted with cryptic swirls and designs. The vision was tinged red, as if seenthrough stained glass.General Utros loomed closer as the two sorceresses chanted, pulled with theirown magic. Sitting close to the water on the floor, Lani gasped. She seemedfrozen, but could not break the vision. She struggled, and the images grew morepotent, more startling.Utros had lost half of his face. Someone had cut the entire burn scar from hischeek, his mouth, beneath his eye. The wound was fresh and raw, dripping blood.The sorceresses continued their chant, calling in an ancient tongue, then spoketo the general. “We are summoning the dragon. He must come.”Nathan and Elsa both recoiled in astonishment. “Dear spirits, how can they calla dragon?”When Lani gasped again, the two sorceresses suddenly looked at the water, likeeagles spotting a rabbit on the ground. Lani yanked her hands back from thepool, trying to break the scrying spell, but Ava and Ruva leaned closer on theirside, throwing harsh magic into the water and following Lani’s connection backto her.“No!” The water on the blue marble floor roiled like soup in a cauldron. Thescrying images shattered, but the water continued to writhe, pulling itselftogether. The liquid rose up in a translucent frothing column and flung itselfat Lani’s face. She lifted her hands, clawing at the water, which covered herlike a smothering sheet.Nathan and Elsa leaped over the stone table, running to help her. Quentin stoodup from his books, staring in disbelief.Lani thrashed, but could not tear away the water that covered her face, pushinginto her mouth, her nose. She couldn’t breathe, and the water forced itselfinside her.“She’s drowning!” Nathan said. “We have to help her!”Elsa scribbled a transference rune, tried to move the water. It pulled andsquirmed like a jellyfish on Lani’s face, pressing into her nose, her eyes. Lanicouldn’t breathe, but she fought back.Nathan manipulated the air, creating a vacuum to suck the water away, but Avaand Ruva combined their gift and counterattacked. He couldn’t react swiftlyenough.The water pressed into Lani’s sinuses, into her throat. Its force broke her jaw,ruptured her windpipe, shattered her cheekbones from the inside, and thesmothering water filled her, flooding her head, her lungs.Even as Nathan and Elsa frantically tried to help, Lani collapsed to the marbletiles. The floor was now dry, because all the water was within her. The visionswere gone.The sorceress lay dead, her face misshapen and flaccid now that all the bonesthat held her features had been pulverized. Her stiff skin folded in on itself,and in an evil irony, all the water flowed back out of her nose and mouth,running across the floor.“Oh, Lani!” Elsa wrapped her arms around the dead woman’s shoulders. “Oh, Lani.”Quentin stood behind them, appalled.Nathan felt stricken and helpless. “I didn’t know how to stop it. I could notsave her. Dear spirits…”“Dear spirits, indeed,” Quentin said. He turned to Elsa and Nathan. “And now weshould be even more afraid. We know that General Utros is calling a dragon.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 57 [contents.xhtml#c_ch57]Lila never let herself relax, and Bannon suspected that she didn’t know how. Theyoung morazeth remained vigilant, muscles taut, reflexes alert. Even when sheshared his bed and showed some small amount of tenderness, she remained a coiledspring ready to react.Now, when she led him down steep streets to an arched gateway into the roughsandstone bluff, he knew she didn’t just want to go for a walk with him.“We should always be on our guard,” she said. Since his escape from the enemycamp, she had occasionally stopped calling him “boy.” Perhaps it was anindication of respect, or maybe Lila just forgot herself. “Ildakar’s walls haveprotected our city for thousands of years, but our river defenses keep us safeas well.”In the merchants’ district she stopped at an entrance to the supply tunnelswithin the sandstone bluff, and he followed her into the cool, torch-litpassages. Muscular workers rolled barrels or loaded carts with piled sacks ofgrain. Some carts were drawn by plodding yaxen, others pulled bybroad-shouldered men. Lila walked along at a brisk pace, following the widetunnel.“Where did all these supplies come from?” Bannon asked. He had known of previoustrade with villages in the hills, but the giant siege army had cut off thoseroutes.“When we were under the shroud, Ildakar had to be self-sufficient,” Lila said.“Our stockpiles can supply us for many years, and that is why the general’ssiege will never succeed, no matter how long he waits.”Bannon paused at wooden tubs full of fish with drooping whiskers. Their suckermouths gaped, and their eyes were glassy. “Those are fresh fish, not preserved,”he said. “From the river?”“Once the shroud came down, many villages upriver came to trade with us,” Lilasaid. “We still receive plenty of supplies even with the army encamped on theplain.”As she led him along the tunnel, he spotted daylight ahead, which outshone thetorches. Lila brought him to a wide opening that looked out upon the sheer cliffand the river below. She paused at the edge of the opening and peered down thebluffside.Bannon joined her and saw that while the sheer cliff seemed as unassailable asthe high city walls, a network of steps, ladders, platforms, and ramps letpeople enter and exit through numerous openings on the cliffside to receivedeliveries from dock platforms on the riverbank. In the air in front of them,several crows chased each other high above the water.Lila explained, “We take goods from the trading boats and bring them up here fordelivery throughout the markets in the city.”Bannon remembered the three Norukai slaving ships that had come to the city. Korand his companions must have led their numerous beaten captives up to the slavemarket by this route.“We are secure,” Lila said. “If anyone tried to attack us from the river, wecould drop the platforms, disengage the docks, and isolate ourselves.” Shestepped right up to the edge and looked down, her feet less than an inch fromthe drop-off. Bannon felt dizzy just looking at her. “We have never needed totake such extreme measures.”She stepped out onto the cliff face, finding cleverly hidden stairs in thesandstone. Without a rail or a rope, she began to descend toward a woodenplatform twenty feet below them. When he hesitated, she called, “Come with me.”She darted down the path carved into the rugged bluff.Bannon refused to show fear and stepped after her, seeing wider walkways, woodensteps anchored into the rock so that haulers could carry crates, sacks, andbarrels into other openings and holding areas. Lila waited for him on theplatform below, and he realized she had been testing him. He joined her withoutcomment or complaint. She hurried along steps to another platform, and theyworked their way down the cliff.When he reached a wide spot to spread his feet, he turned to look up. The bluffface was smooth and sheer, showing little natural weathering of the soft rock.Other pockmarks and cave openings led into a warren of tunnels within theuplift. More than a hundred feet below, the river looked blue-green and placid,and the top of the cliff was just as far overhead.Two small flatboats had tied up against the receiving docks, where Ildakaranworkers helped unload sealed barrels from one boat and quarried stone blocks andslabs of rock from the other. Workers used ropes and pulleys to lift the heavycrates along tracks in the cliff to a receiving cave. Other platforms levitatedon their own, and Bannon realized that some gifted merchants were using magic toassist in the efforts.Two levels below, as they climbed down a ladder, Bannon saw a smaller platformno more than four feet wide, which held two basins of fresh-caught river fish,still flopping. Workers high above pulled ropes to raise the tubs of fish to adifferent receiving cave. Even though their city was under siege, with thousandsof enemy soldiers just outside the thick walls, the workers at the river calledout in casual conversation, joking and laughing as if this were any normalworkday.Zigzagging along the sheer rock, he and Lila made their way down the sheerbluff. He held on to the sandstone, keeping his balance, and fixed his gaze onher bare back, not looking down. She went to the southern edge of the mainbluff, where the stairs switched direction again, and showed him a stream ofriver water tumbling and gurgling along a wooden chute. Bannon was startled torealize the water was flowing backward, running uphill from the river into theaqueduct passages. It splashed and sprayed with the speed of its passage, untilit plunged like a reverse waterfall inside the cliff. He saw spell runes carvedinto the rock.Lila said, “General Utros blocked off the streams that normally provide waterfrom the valley, but we have all we need from the river. We just bring it upinto Ildakar. If necessary, we can also release the water. If invaders try toscale the cliffs, we can open the locks and let our cisterns and storage tanksflood the cliffside.”Bannon followed her to the river’s edge, and they had to step aside as workerstrudged up the stairs carrying sacks of grain on their shoulders. Finally, atthe waterline, they walked out onto the wooden docks, where the two flatboatswere being unloaded. Each had a captain and a handful of crew members.Ildakaran merchants stood beside the flatboats, tallying up supplies andreceipts, paying the captains with bags of gold coins and jewels. One citymerchant puffed out his cheeks. “The grain doesn’t cost any more to produce, andthe fish are still fish. Why so expensive?”The riverboat captain frowned. “Sorry for the increased prices, sir, but withyour city under siege, our danger has increased. I have to pay my crew more toconvince them to come here.”“War demands higher prices,” said the second captain. “Your need is moredesperate now, and if you’re desperate, then prices go up. Simple commerce.”“We will pay the asking price,” the merchant grumbled. “Ildakar has no use forall this gold anyway. I’d rather have food to eat.” He looked down at the lastbarrels, where the slippery forms still twitched. “And those are eels, myfavorite! I’ll eat half the cargo myself.”Bannon remained puzzled as he and Lila came forward. “But the siege is on theplains, and the soldiers can’t make their way down to the river. Your work is nomore dangerous now.”“Oh, there are dangers, young man,” said the captain, and the man on theadjacent flatboat nodded as well. “Hanson there comes from downriver, whichmeans he has to skirt the swamps, and if you want the stone he brings from thequarries, he has to take his boat past all those swamp dragons and killersnakes.”Hanson gritted his teeth and nodded again.The captain continued, “One of the villages down there was destroyed, thanks tosome wizard from Ildakar and a morazeth. There’s almost nothing left of Taradanow.”Lila frowned at the information. “A morazeth and a wizard?”The captain nodded. “Tarada was a fine town in a peaceful oxbow. They caused noone any trouble, but then a wizard made himself their new leader, and a morazethattacked him—a woman just like you. All the villagers suffered, many weremurdered, and most of their huts were ruined.”Hanson crossed his arms over his chest and grunted. “So if you want our goodsand you ask us to face dangers like that, you can pay a little extra.”“We will pay, as I said,” the merchant repeated, eager to be done with thetransaction. He had his workers unload the containers of eels onto one of thelifting platforms.Bannon was confused, looking at Lila. “How can there be a morazeth out in theswamps? Do you think the wizard was Maxim?”“I have no doubt of that.” Lila stared down the wide river toward the swamps,which looked like a festering scar of vegetation. “And I would wager themorazeth was Adessa.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 58 [contents.xhtml#c_ch58]Far downriver from Ildakar, the swamps finally gave way to normal terrain.Adessa had to worry about normal, natural hazards. And Maxim himself.She continued her hunt for days after leaving devastated Tarada. She was stillscratched and bruised, but she healed quickly, and the extra life energy fromher absorbed baby continued to give her unparalleled strength, though she hatedto squander the rare blood magic. When she finally cornered the wizardcommander, she would need that strength to defeat him.First, though, she had to find him.Adessa kept tracking Maxim through the swamps, fighting low-hanging branches,splashing across shallow channels, trying to sense which direction he would havegone. After the explosion of steam and the wash of water that had obliteratedTarada, he had stolen a boat and gone miles downstream before working his wayinto the wilderness again. He couldn’t hide forever, but he had a significanthead start on her.She narrowed her eyes in the waning light. The sun had already set, and orangelight filtered through the forest. Frogs and night insects began their musiceven before darkness fell. Adessa pushed through the tall grass, but when sheheard rustling in the underbrush and the splash of a large animal, she decidedto find a protected place to wait out the darkness. She wasn’t tired. Her bodyhad enough energy to go all day and night, but it would be a foolish risk toblunder ahead without being able to see. There were too many potentialpredators, and she could easily lose Maxim’s trail in the dark.Resigned, she found an ancient tree, a swamp oak that might have been growingsince the early days of Ildakar. Its trunk was covered with moss and shelfmushrooms. Overhead, among dangling vines and the patchy beards of swamp moss,she saw a wide horizontal branch and decided that would be a good place to spendthe night, high enough above the ground. Finding handholds in the cracked bark,she scampered up the trunk. When she reached the wide branch, she swung her legsover either side of it, feeling the rough bark on her bare thighs.Darkness fell like a blanket tossed over the trees. Adessa didn’t need a fire,since the air was warm and humid, and she had no food to cook anyway. Instead,she settled herself in a comfortable position, her back against the trunk, herlegs drawn up on the thick branch. She tugged some of the nearby loose vines,snapped the twigs and air roots that held them in place, and lashed herself tothe branch to keep her from falling while she slept.For many nights she had lain awake, alert, resting her muscles but not her mind.Now, she felt secure enough that she could give her body what it needed. Shechanneled her breathing, felt her heartbeat, concentrated on her singular goal.She repeated the words of Sovrena Thora in her mind. “Kill him. Leave the city,now, and hunt him down.” The command was burned into her memory, and Adessa hadaccepted it. “Bring his head back to Ildakar. The people of this city must seethat the wizard commander has met justice.”She imagined the moment when she would defeat the wizard commander and use herlong combat knife to cut off his head.Adessa’s thoughts stopped there. She didn’t let herself think of what she woulddo after she completed her mission. For now, there was no “after.” Killing Maximwas the only thing in her life.As she pressed against the trunk, she felt only a slight easing of tension inher muscles. Not quite relaxation, but it was enough. A morazeth didn’t needmuch.She thought about the women she had trained to fight at her side to serve theneeds of Ildakar. No arena warriors were as great as the morazeth, and Adessawas the greatest of them all, but she had left her sisters, and she was herenow, out in the swamps alone, tied to a tree above the ground in a dangerousnight.Adessa closed her eyes, touched her flat abdomen, and traced the fine runebrandings on the taut skin, but she thought of the unborn child that was nolonger inside her womb. If she had let Ian’s baby come to term, it wouldn’t havebeen her first child. She’d let herself be impregnated by four other champions.Three daughters were now being raised by gifted nobles, and if they provedworthy, Adessa would take them as morazeth trainees. None of them knew theirmother’s identity, and she would not treat them differently. Her last child, aboy, was of no use to her. Apparently, he was a rambunctious young man who haddifficulty learning his sums, and therefore posed problems for the merchantfamily that had adopted him.Adessa inhaled the air redolent of rot and swamp flowers, closed her eyes.Ian’s unborn child was different. Ian had been a brave and strong young man,devoted to Adessa, until Bannon and the sorceress Nicci helped turn the entirecity against the long-established order.Ian …She remembered how she had taught him to please her. When she took his body intohers, it was like a form of physical combat, and Ian had excelled at it. He was,after all, the champion.She shut off those thoughts. Ian was dead because she had killed him. The childgrowing within her womb had served a different purpose, providing the magicalstrength she would need to defeat Wizard Commander Maxim. Nothing else mattered.Adessa heard a rustling below and looked down from her high branch to see largecreatures prowling along the ground on stumpy legs, gliding through the muddywater in search of prey, a pair of swamp dragons with jaws that could snapthrough the thickest thighbone. Adessa was high above, though, and the swampdragons didn’t even look up. She made no sound.As an exercise, she considered dropping from the branch, thrusting her daggerinto the backs of their skulls, and killing both of them. It would have beenenjoyable and would have provided fresh meat, but Adessa remained where she was.She needed to rest. She needed to find Maxim.She could slay all the swamp dragons she liked, once she had the wizardcommander’s head in a sack. That was the joy she anticipated most. Other formsof entertainment would wait.She rested her head against the trunk, checked the vines holding her in place,and closed her eyes. Tomorrow she would continue the hunt.The wizard commander would not elude her forever."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 59 [contents.xhtml#c_ch59]As she left Tanimura, Nicci felt satisfied with the response from the D’Harangarrison, confident that General Linden would build up the defenses and alertthe rest of Lord Rahl’s army. She was already making plans for similar missionsto major Old World cities, but after she had dream-witnessed Mrra’s battle withthe heart hounds, Nicci worried about Ildakar. She had to get back.“Breathe!”Returning via the sliph, Nicci rolled over the low wall inside the chamber inthe lower levels of the city. She dropped to her knees on the hard floor,coughed up the silvery presence that filled her lungs, her heart and soul. Thesliph was in her, but she forced it out.In the shadows of the unlit chamber, Nicci summoned a light in her hand as shegot to her feet. The glow filled her surroundings, and she smelled the damp rockand moss. She turned to find the sliph waiting in her well, gleaming, metallic,and beautiful.“Tell me what you achieved for the cause,” the sliph said. “Tell me aboutSulachan and how our war fares.” She was eager and intense. “I sacrificedeverything long ago to achieve victory against the wizards of the New World. Iexpect the same sacrifice from all our allies.”“What I accomplished is not your concern,” Nicci said. She thought the sliphmight be able to detect a lie, and she didn’t want to answer at all.The creature was incensed. “I need to know. I can travel from city to city, butI see only my well. It has been so long since I carried anyone else. Tell menews.”Nicci would need to use the sliph again to travel, but she was uneasy that thestrange woman was so curious, so demanding. Placing her hands on her hips, Niccifaced the sliph. “Talking about secret missions is a sure way for the cause tofail. You took me to Tanimura, and I did what I had to do. You don’t need toknow what it was. Soon, I will require you to take me elsewhere for anothermission. I expect you to cooperate.”“I will cooperate,” the sliph said, sulking.“Be satisfied to know that you are helping me.”“So long as you and I fight for the same cause,” she warned.Nicci felt a hint of suspicion in the creature’s voice. Without answering, shewent to the door of the low chamber and emerged into the daylight of Ildakar.Behind her the sliph remained, watching her for a long moment before she meltedback into her placid pool.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Utros’s half-petrified soldiers continued to pound on the walls. Ildakaranengineers had discovered alarming, hair-thin cracks within the ancient blocks,and gifted nobles used magic to reshape and solidify the stone before the crackscould widen.With a gathering crowd of curiosity seekers around her, Nicci went to the rulingtower to report about her trip to Tanimura. When she walked into the chamber,Rendell was talking about all the work ungifted people did throughout the city,sharpening swords, fashioning armor, creating weapons, and generally keepingIldakar functioning. The former slave’s words faltered as soon as Nicci entered.Nathan jumped to his feet. “Dear sorceress! I am glad to see you.”Her gaze swept around the room. “I informed the D’Haran garrison about Utros andhis army, and Lord Rahl will soon be aware of the threat. We cannot expectreinforcements any time soon, though. Ildakar must defend itself. Have you madeany progress? Found any new weapons?”Olgya explained that the Ildakaran silk houses were working to create enhancedworms that spun even tougher silken armor. Before the woman could finish herreport, Bannon dashed in, grinning, accompanied by a businesslike Lila. “Nicci!You’re back.”Though overwhelmed with surprise to see the young man still alive, Niccicontrolled her reaction. “I’m pleased to see that you survived. You are a goodfighter, and I would not have wanted to lose you.” He seemed overly exuberant asusual, and hurried forward, but reconsidered a welcoming embrace at the lastmoment.Elsa added in a heavy voice, “We also have bad news. Lani is dead.”The conversation in the chamber became low and muted. Nicci asked, “Whathappened to her?”Nathan stroked his long white hair. “She used her water-scrying magic to spy onGeneral Utros, but his two sorceresses caught her and struck back.”“Lani was no match for them,” Elsa said. “They killed her, right here. And wecould not save her.”“That is a blow,” Nicci said. “We need every gifted fighter, and Lani wasstrong.”Nathan said, “It gets worse, I’m afraid … dear spirits, it gets worse. Beforeshe was killed, Lani learned that Utros and those two women were working asummoning spell. Something so powerful that it terrifies me.”“It terrifies all of us,” said Quentin. “We should seriously consider our lastresort of raising the shroud before the general can succeed. Sovrena Thoraoffered us her cooperation.”Nicci didn’t want to hear about Thora. “What did Lani discover? What summoningspell?”Nathan said, “Utros intends to summon a dragon. He has a connection, and thesorceresses drew upon it.”Damon’s voice cracked, showing his fear and stress. “If a dragon joins thatancient army, our walls won’t be able to protect us. The monster will wreakhavoc on Ildakar. Countless thousands of lives will be lost, our homesdestroyed.”Nicci understood the threat. “If General Utros can command a dragon, then wehave to prepare.”Quentin said, “If a dragon comes, what can we do? We haven’t found a sufficientweapon.”Nathan looked down at the stone table in front of him, then squared hisshoulders. “I have been waiting for Nicci before even suggesting this.” Helooked at them all with his alert azure eyes. “Ildakar does have such a weapon,and now we truly have to consider it.” Intrigued, Nicci waited for him to saymore. Nathan rose to his feet. “Sorceress, come with me. You can tell me whetheror not I’m mad even to suggest the idea.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In broken patches of sunlight in Andre’s ruined studio, Nicci stared at thetowering Ixax warriors. “You destroyed one of these yourself when you regainedyour gift,” she said.Nathan and Elsa were beside her, both uneasy. Nathan said, “Mirrormask unleashedit to cause chaos, and the Ixax was maddened by centuries of mindlessinactivity.” He lowered his voice, stroking his chin. “The fault lies squarelyon Andre’s shoulders.”Nicci looked at the two remaining titans. Behind the slits in their cumbersomehelmets, she saw their yellow eyes staring straight ahead.Nathan moved closer to them, as if to demonstrate his confidence. “These twohave suffered the same endless waiting, but the souls of the original young menare still inside them—I know it. When Ildakar was first threatened, long ago,they volunteered to become these monstrous warriors. But they remember, and theyknow the city’s need.”Nicci thought about the sliph, who had similarly volunteered to become somethinginhuman because of her fierce devotion to a cause. “Are you sure they remembertheir loyalty? Have you spoken with them? Can you speak to them?”“I have been talking to them regularly, reading them stories, legends, andhistory,” Nathan said. “I’ve explained what is happening now outside the walls,with the reawakened army. I am convinced they understand.”Elsa touched his arm. “We reminded them of their duty. The Ixax may not be ableto defeat a dragon, but they are the most powerful weapon Ildakar has rightnow.”Nicci nodded slowly. “They were designed to slay tens of thousands of enemysoldiers. They would certainly cause much greater harm than our surprise attackthe other night.” She studied the giant warriors for a long moment. They wouldbe devastating in their own way. “Yes, I think we should take the chance.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 60 [contents.xhtml#c_ch60]Fighting stormy seas, the Norukai fleet sailed south from the jagged islands,heading to the wide mouth of the estuary where the Killraven River spilled intothe ocean.Fifty sturdy serpent ships, blessed by the blood of Yorik and the grace of theserpent god, pushed across the open water, their dark blue sails stretched tightby guiding winds. Whenever the breezes faltered, King Grieve would sound thedrums, and his warriors extended the lines of oars to row the ships onward.Grieve had always been a restless man. Sitting on his blocky throne left himimpatient, so he tended to leave the Bastion walls and roam the island, huntingby himself or taking a small boat to one of the nearby islands. His peopleneeded to see him, and they needed to fear him.Wanting to fight, he would provoke clan leaders, yell at them, open his scarredmouth wide as if to bite their faces off. He insulted them, shamed them untilthey retaliated. Occasionally, some hotheaded fool got angry enough to challengehim for the rule of the Norukai, and those reluctant challengers always died.Grieve selected them carefully.Now, the Norukai islands were half empty, since the bravest were with him aboardthe serpent ships in his giant navy, while others had gone off in separatefleets with the disgraced Kor or Lars. Those others were misfits and lacklusterwarriors, mostly drunkards, those with exorbitant gambling debts, or cuckoldswho couldn’t face their fellow warriors without shame. King Grieve knew theywould fight with wild abandon, but he was interested in blood and glory forhimself. Ildakar was a legendary city with countless wizards and ancientdefenses that had held for centuries, but no mere city could stand against aNorukai invasion.He stood behind the serpent carving that roared from the prow of his ship. Whenhe grew bored of staring at the waves and the spray, he stalked back along thedeck. His shaman pranced alongside him, unable to contain his energy. “Sailing,sailing, sailing!” Chalk said. “We are sailing, and soon we will kill. I’ve seenit. We will kill! Ildakar will be gone! My Grieve, King Grieve! They’ll allgrieve.”“Yes, I’m your Grieve, and our enemies will grieve.”“We’ll kill soon, I’ve seen it.” The albino grinned with glee.Grieve knew they were still far from the estuary. “What will we kill?” On theopen sea they wouldn’t find any ships, nor would they bother to attack smallcoastal towns, like Renda Bay. Not this time.“Don’t know, my Grieve.” Chalk looked away as if he had failed his king. Hestared into the sun without blinking, gazing for so long that Grieve thought hemight go blind. He knocked the gangly shaman aside. Chalk rubbed his eyes. Backat the Bastion, he would stare at the flames in the large hearth and sort outhis visions. Now without a convenient fire, he seemed to seek premonitions inthe sun itself.With a brisk wind, the water was rough and choppy. Even though Chalk had sailedwith him from island to island, this was the longest ocean voyage the pale manhad endured. For the first three days, Chalk was abominably sick, clutching hisstomach with one hand and holding on to the rail with the other as he retchedover the side, convinced that the serpent god had cursed him, that somehowYorik’s sacrifice hadn’t been sufficient. In his misery, he threatened to throwhimself overboard, but Grieve held him back.“It is not the serpent god. It’s just sickness from the sea. You know thatothers get it.” Even brave Norukai with painfully scarred faces, warriors eagerto bloody their hands and weapons on raids, could be struck with seasickness,for which they were mocked by the other Norukai.Two raiders had snickered and insulted Chalk on this voyage, and King Grieveclubbed one of the men to death while he was guffawing. With the man’s headleaking brains like a broken cliff gourd, Grieve heaved him over the side of theship.The second mocking man fell to his knees and bowed. “Forgiveness, King Grieve!Let me die in battle.”Grieve turned to Chalk. “It is your decision. Should he die?”Utterly miserable, the shaman had shaken his head and staggered to the side ofthe boat, where he vomited again. Grieve made sure he drank enough water to keephimself alive. Finally, after three choppy days, the seas calmed and Chalk’squeasiness retreated. Now that he was over the worst of it, the shaman was againfull of energy, eager to see the coast, the river, and Ildakar.As they sailed, the serpent ships dragged nets to catch fresh fish to eat. Thefood was considered an offering from the serpent god and far better than thepreserved and salted stores. For himself, King Grieve had brought along the lastof the yaxen meat from Ildakar, which he refused to share.The raiding fleet sailed through gray waters. Chalk darted to the side of theship, tugging on Grieve’s muscular arm. “I’ve seen it. You’ll see it, too!Look.” He pointed, but Grieve couldn’t see anything on the waves. “Killing!”Hearing the excited jabber, other Norukai strode to the side of the vessel. Ashout came from one of the adjacent serpent ships, and Grieve shaded his eyes.“There!” Chalk said. “I told you we will kill soon. Look!”“Selka.” The Norukai warrior beside him growled in his throat. “Look on thewaves, my king.”Now Grieve did see bobbing figures, slick gray shapes swimming there, but theywere not human. Grieve ground his molars together, felt his jaw muscles strain.“Selka…” He said the word as if spitting poison. “Why doesn’t the serpent godjust devour them all and rid the seas of their stain?”He felt a blood fire in his gut. The selka were an undersea race of viciousmonsters that might once have been human long ago. They swam together and servedtheir cruel selka queen. The creatures attacked ships they consideredtrespassers. They would swarm up the hulls or tear holes below the waterline.The selka had iron-hard claws and rows of daggerlike teeth.Despite their fearsome appearance, though, they could be killed. Grieve knewthat for a fact, because he had killed many himself. Often the selka wouldoverwhelm a Norukai ship with their numbers, and then leave the vessels adriftafter murdering everyone aboard. Sometimes the wrecks were found on the opensea, the dark blue sails shredded, the masts broken, claw marks, slime, andblood all over the decks. Grieve hated the selka.A succession of shouts rang out from the serpent ships. The Norukai gatheredspears, axes, and harpoons, preparing for an attack from the water. They calledout to the selka, taunting them, daring the creatures to come closer.“Too many,” Chalk said, shaking his head. “Too many.”“We will fight them,” Grieve said. “I don’t care how many there are.”“No, no, my Grieve. Too many of us. The selka are afraid. Too many! The Norukaiwould kill them all. They won’t attack.”“Then they are wise,” Grieve said, disappointed. He saw at least a hundredselka, but he had thousands of Norukai warriors. The creatures kept theirdistance, and Grieve glowered, challenging them.One figure bobbed in front of the rest, brightly colored and vicious. He thoughtit was the selka queen. If so, he wanted to jam his fist in her mouth and breakthrough her skull. He grinned at the thought.From the stern of the ship, when the Norukai pulled the knotted ropes and raisedthe trolling nets to see what fish they had caught, the men shouted in surpriseand triumph.Chalk bounced up and down. “Told you, told you! Now we kill.”A selka was caught in the net. It had tried to slip in among the serpent shipsfor a treacherous attack, looking for a way to damage their hulls. How manyothers might be unseen below the surface? The entangled selka writhed and clawedat the net, almost breaking free, but the Norukai pummeled it with their clubsand axes.“Don’t kill it!” Grieve yelled. “Not yet.”The battered creature had large slitted eyes and a wide fishlike mouth thatseemed a mockery of how Norukai scarred their mouths to look more like theserpent god, but Grieve knew these selka were no children of the serpent god.Even cut, bruised, and bleeding, the selka snapped its jaws and slashed at themwith its claws. Grieve strode forward, not fearing the thing. He balled his fistand punched the selka full in the face. The impact of his iron-reinforcedknuckles made a squelching sound accompanied by a crunch of facial bones. Theselka spewed blood from its flattened nostrils, leaking slime and saliva fromits slack mouth.Grieve said, “Tie a rope around its ankles and take it to the mainmast.” Hesecured the thick chain-link belt around his own waist.The Norukai dragged the stunned creature across the deck, leaving a trail ofslime and blood as if a slug had curled its way across the boards. Grieve stoodbeside the tall mast. Gazing out at the water, he saw that more selka hadgathered just beyond the reach of the serpent ships. Grieve could sense theiranger, but the selka spy and saboteur was a prisoner of war. They had sent ithere to attack, and he would treat it accordingly.One of the Norukai climbed the mast with the other end of the rope, which hethrew over the yardarm. Grieve seized the dangling end and pulled hand overhand, hoisting the captive selka up off the deck so that it swung head down. Therope remained tight around the creature’s ankles, lashing its webbed feettogether. As it hung high above the deck, the captive selka hissed and stirred,swaying like bait on a fisherman’s hook.Grieve tied off the rope on a deck stanchion. The inverted selka struggled butcould find no purchase in the air. It bent its back, trying to reach the rope atits ankles, but to no avail.Grieve bellowed out to the open water. “Selka queen! We have one of yours. Watchwhat we will do to all of you!” The big king climbed the mast, hand over hand,holding on to a rigging rope until he reached the yardarm from which the selkahung. The captive swung and clawed at the air, unable to reach Grieve.From his high position, the king bellowed, “Watch, selka queen!” He pulled outhis knife, whose hilt was carved from a sea-serpent skeleton that had washedashore on one of the Norukai islands. With one hand, Grieve pulled the flailingcreature close. With his other hand, as he balanced precariously on the yardarm,Grieve drew the razor edge across the selka’s throat. The creature gaped andsnapped with its jaws, but now its neck yawned open like a wide red gill slit.The selka shuddered as its blood sprayed out.Below, Chalk bounded along on the deck, raising his pale hands to receive thespattering of red rain. Other Norukai joined the shaman, turning their scarredfaces upward and letting selka blood fall on them.From up on the mast, the king could see the gathered selka on the water, angryand vengeful, but wise enough not to attack the Norukai raiding force.When the body was drained, Grieve cut the rope and let the selka fall to thedeck, where it lay cracked and broken. He worked his way down and jumped thelast five feet to the boards. He bent over the selka body and used his big knifeto hack off the creature’s hideous head. It was slimy, covered with blood, itsslitted eyes dull, but still open. Grieve decided to mount it on a spike behindthe carved serpent head on the prow.“I will keep this for my collection, but take the body. Keep the rope tiedaround its feet and drop it over the side. Drag it behind our ship so the selkacan smell the blood in the water.” He chuckled. “Maybe they will learn theirlesson.” He doubted it, though.The Norukai cast the headless selka body overboard, and it drifted in theirwake.Less than an hour later, the rope tugged hard, and King Grieve wasn’t surprisedwhen his crew pulled the rope back in to find the body gone, the rope gnawedthrough by sharp teeth."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 61 [contents.xhtml#c_ch61]With the dire possibility of General Utros summoning a dragon, the duma memberswere forced to make a swift decision, rather than indulge their penchant forendless debate. Once Nicci added her voice to Nathan’s and Elsa’s, the councilvoted unanimously. Ildakar would unleash the two Ixax warriors as a powerfulweapon against the enemy.Late at night, workers lashed together large wooden platforms mounted on heavyiron-shod wheels, creating a pair of carts sturdy enough to carry the Ixaxwarriors. Using ropes for balance, work teams pulled the armored titans,supporting them as they tilted the massive figures, while Nathan and Nicci usedtheir gift to cushion the fall with air as the giants landed on the wagon beds.With the Ixax warriors prone on the large carts, teams hauled them through therubble of Andre’s villa and out into the open. They led a nighttime processionthrough the streets of Ildakar, slowly guiding the Ixax wagons toward the wallsand the main gate. Many people came out to watch under the glowing streetlights.Some cheered in foolish defiance of General Utros, while the wiser citizens weresomber and frightened.The city had fallen ominously silent hours before, when the ancienthalf-petrified soldiers outside the walls ceased pounding and withdrew to themain army, without explanation. Nathan knew that was not a good sign. Utros mustbe planning something terrible. What if he had found a dragon? That alone wasenough to spur them to greater speed. Now, the procession replaced the ominoussilence with defiant noise as they approached the giant gate.As Nathan and Elsa walked alongside the slow-moving carts with Nicci leading theway, the wizard looked at the enormous warriors lying back and staring upward atthe starry sky through the slits in their helmets. Nathan realized this was thefirst time these titans had seen the stars in more than fifteen centuries. Hethought again about what those innocent young men had sacrificed. Jonathan,Rald, and Denn.The procession passed gathered crowds. Children looked wide-eyed at the colossalwarriors rolling past, while parents, old men, merchants, and freed slaveswatched uneasily. With forced good cheer, Nathan ignited a bright fire in hispalm. “Why so sullen? Dear spirits, we must cheer for these heroes, our Ixaxwarriors! They will save Ildakar. Show how much you appreciate them. They havegiven everything for your city.” He flared his hand torch brighter.Elsa smiled, realizing what he meant. “Yes, everyone—cheer!” She let out awhistle and lit her own magical fire. “For the Ixax warriors, for the defendersof Ildakar!”With a slowly building ripple, shouts rang out along the streets, and thecongratulatory applause grew louder. Walking beside the armored head of oneIxax, Nathan bent close to whisper, “Listen to them, my friend. They know youand they appreciate you. Soon, you will finally get to do what you’ve waited todo for centuries.”Elsa’s bright glow lit the other side of the groaning cart. After Nicci heardNathan urge greater and greater cheers, she responded by sending up a column offierce wizard’s fire in a dazzling beacon that awed the crowd.The heavy carts rolled down the streets, passing the now empty and shadow-filledcombat arena, the merchants’ district, warehouses, and workers’ homes, tofinally arrive on the broad lower levels in front of the high walls. Dawn wasjust breaking, a glow rising to the east behind the city. The towering gateswere closed and barricaded, and the carts bearing the two Ixax warriors stoppedjust behind them.“These Ixax warriors remember their hearts, their families, and their city,”Nathan announced. “They will defend us, as they swore to do so long ago.”High Captain Stuart commanded his sentries to release the locking spells, rollback the gears, and ratchet the crossbars out of their sockets. With a mightyheave, dozens of workers hauled on ropes, slowly creaking open the giganticgates of Ildakar.Impatient with the ponderous barrier, Nathan waved his hand and added a push ofmagic. By now, the sky was brightening, and the sun was over the river behindthe bluff. When the gates were open far enough, teams guided the two cartscarrying the colossal warriors through the gap.The general’s army had withdrawn far from the walls, and the ancient soldiersstirred in their camp.Concerned, Nicci said to Nathan, “Look at the army. Something is happening.General Utros is making his move.”“Then we must make ours,” Nathan said. “Quickly now.” He turned to Elsa and theduma members who had accompanied them. “No time for a work crew. Use your gift.Let us stand our defenders on their feet and prepare to set them free at last.”The newly constructed carts tilted down, placing the giant boots of the Ixax onthe ground. Nathan released his gift. Nicci added her push. Oron, Damon,Quentin, and Elsa all used their magic, helping to raise the first warriorupright. He stood on his massive legs like a sentinel statue, half as tall asthe huge city gates.Working together, they raised the second Ixax warrior, so that the pair stoodimmobile but ready. Nathan could sense a difference in the giants, a tinglinganticipation behind their armor, as if their blood was beginning to boil,trapped inside their encased forms.“Soon,” Nathan said to them, gesturing. “Soon! You can see your enemy now, thatgiant army out there.” Though he wasn’t sure the Ixax could shift their gaze,thousands and thousands of troops filled the plain before Ildakar. The sheernumber of foes was breathtaking, but the Ixax seemed ready. Anxious.“Those soldiers are a threat to Ildakar. They want to shatter the walls andransack the city,” Nathan said. The sky continued to brighten. “They plan toconquer Ildakar in the name of Emperor Kurgan, who has been dead for centuries.You can save us.” He looked up at the giant warriors. “The two of you can saveus.”Shouts came from the sentries on the walls above. General Utros was clearing agreat area in his camp for some unknown purpose, and Nathan felt a growingdread. The other wizards looked around, also expecting something.Nathan swallowed hard, and turned to Elsa. “Very well, my dear, let us proveourselves right.” He looked at the towering inhuman soldiers. “Remember who youare. Remember why you were created.”Elsa added, “Remember us. You have to remember us.” Then she activated theembedded rune on the plates of the Ixax armor, illuminating the mark with a glowof magic, setting them free.The symbol flared, brightened, and Nathan heard a cracking sound as the jointsbecame unfrozen, long-hardened muscles thawing. The eyes in the helmets blazedbrighter, bonfires of anger and frustration. In a flash, Nathan remembered thenight he had almost died when he’d faced a single Ixax. He, better than anyoneelse, knew the danger and power these things represented.Now he was unleashing them, on purpose.Moving now, coming alive again, they swiveled their huge helmeted heads down togive a knowing look to Nathan. Then, with a groan of ancient, unparalleledpower, the Ixax warriors began to move."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 62 [contents.xhtml#c_ch62]It was a bright morning, a fateful morning, and the sun rose above Ildakar’sbluffs, silhouetting the city. General Utros studied the haze in the air, theorange colors of brightening dawn, and he felt the magic around himstrengthening—the magic that Ava and Ruva had released.Because the spell was tied to the skin they had peeled from his face, Utros waspart of the magic as well. When his sorceresses had burned the dragon-fire scarand mixed the ash with his blood in the water basin, a magical bond had beenforged like a gossamer net cast throughout the gift. They knew it would taketime. Finally, days later, in the darkness of the headquarters structure, allthree of them had sensed … a dragon. Yes, their spell had found one of themagnificent ancient beasts, and caught it.Even during Kurgan’s original reign of conquest, dragons had been imposing,unpredictable beasts, and rare. Now, with the powerful spell Ava and Ruva cast,they had found one dragon. Only one.“He is distant,” Ava said in a hushed whisper. Ruva leaned closer, strokingUtros’s cold, hard skin. They shared their body warmth, their magic, theirpresence with him. “But we will make him come to us, through you.”At midnight, Utros had withdrawn his lines of troops from the wall, where theirunceasing pounding had begun to shiver Ildakar’s defenses. He knew theunexpected silence would unnerve the enemy, make them cower because of the quietas much as they feared the hammering.Sooner or later the walls would come down. The wizards inside had reinforced theblocks with their spells, but it was only a matter of time, and after fifteencenturies as a statue himself, Utros wasn’t worried about time. His emperor andhis beloved Majel were already with the Keeper in the underworld. Utros wantedto succeed, needed to succeed to atone for his broken loyalty. Having seen IronFang’s absolute fury and vengeance, Utros knew he would not be forgiven easily.Maybe if he conquered the entire world …Ildakar was the first step.Once the pounding soldiers retreated, the night had been left with resoundingsilence while Utros made final preparations.After painstakingly removing any hint of hair from their bodies, the women hadused fingertips and bright pigments to daub designs over each other’s arms,necks, faces, breasts, each making her sister an exotic sensual masterpiece.With their bodies so colorfully painted, neither of the sorceresses neededclothes.Utros knew they wouldn’t fail him. During the initial workings of the spell,after they dissolved his scar and sent out their call, they had discovered thewater-scrying sorceress from Ildakar, but Ava and Ruva had dealt with the spy.Now his enemies inside the city were likely aware of his plan, even though theycould do nothing to stop it. How could even Ildakar prepare against a dragon inthrall to Utros?After tense days of waiting, the time had come, and there was no sense in hidingtheir plan. Ildakar would burn, its walls would fall, its people would screamand try to surrender, though it would be far too late. Now, at the break ofdawn, Utros walked with the twin sorceresses to the center of the plain. He hadordered his soldiers to clear a great open area in full view of Ildakar. It wastime for Ava and Ruva to pull on the unbreakable spell chains and drag the giantdragon here to do the general’s bidding.The women walked naked alongside General Utros out to the summoning point. Ruvaspoke in a husky whisper. “Daybreak is the cusp between darkness and light, atime when magic is at balance, when certain spells are easier.”Ava added, “It is not easy, beloved Utros, but my sister and I will give all wehave. We will bring you the dragon.”Now that the sun was up, the twins were ready. Utros stood in his ancientuniform, leather armor with polished metal strips, the helmet with the imposingbull’s horns. Around him, his army had erected banners to bring Iron Fang’sflame emblem to the battlefield again. Utros touched the large sword at hisside, squeezed the leather of his gauntlets, felt the tight bracer on his rightarm.Sunlight reflected off the beaten-gold mask that covered the left side of hisface, where his skin had been cut away. Ava and Ruva had used magic to fashion ahalf mask out of raw gold, shaping rings, bracelets, and necklaces into acovering that fit precisely against his exposed flesh. It seemed more gloriousthan his old dragon scar. It made him feel legendary.“From which direction will the dragon come?” Utros asked.Ava and Ruva turned slowly. “He will come from the sky, but we can’t know morethan that. We have yet to call him.”Two soldiers had brought large drums to the center of the wide clear space,according to the sorceresses’ commands. The women knelt, each facing a drum.With open palms and half-petrified hands, they began pounding a loud beat thatresonated across the hushed army. The drumming was only part of the summons,though. They released their gift, and Utros could feel it tingling through hisown body. Because of the scar and skin he had sacrificed to the spell, he andall dragons were joined by an invisible bond. Ava and Ruva sent the thrummingcall through that bond, like a plucked string on a musical instrument.Utros felt a lurch inside himself, like a trout struggling against a fishline,and then a surge of exhilaration. He knew the dragon was there, knew it wascoming. He could feel the sheer power, the ancient reptilian strength, acreature whose very existence was tied to the bones of the world.Ava and Ruva continued pounding the drums. The magic sparked like lightningthrough the air, cowing his thousands of soldiers. He no longer thought of thefires that had scorched the grass hills, or the separate armies he haddispatched on their own missions of conquest. All that mattered was this moment,this place, and the dragon that answered his summons.With a thrill of never-forgotten fear, Utros recalled the wild silver dragonthat he had captured long ago. That debacle should have made him terrified ofdragons, but the general did not accept terror. He did know respect, however.With the bond through his skin, through the scar, Utros would command such abeast.He heard a mutter of anticipation. He could feel the approaching dragon beforeany of his sentries caught sight of it. Ava and Ruva hammered the drums, sendingloud reverberant thumps into the air and across the valley, like the franticheartbeat of a doomed man.The women stopped abruptly, sitting back on their heels and looking at the sky.Utros spotted a winged shape flying impossibly high, no more than a gray fleckagainst the blue. He felt it tugging against the bond, and then he saw the hugewings, the long sinuous neck, the lashing barbed tail.Hushed gasps and outcries of amazement rippled across his countless soldiers.Once he sent the dragon against Ildakar, Utros wanted his entire army to attackas well, but even with his regimented tactical mind, Utros couldn’t worry aboutdetails of the military operation. Not now. His awe was too great.The dragon swooped in, indomitable and unbelievable. It was far more ancient andmuch larger than the wild silver dragon he remembered from long ago. This onewas a gray dragon that radiated unbelievable age, immeasurable wisdom, and thebile of anger that twisted back through the magical bond, lashing at thegeneral’s heart.With a bellows whoosh of hot air and a pounding of great weight, the dragonlanded heavily before General Utros. Ava and Ruva stepped back from their drumsas the general faced the creature. “You are mine,” he said.The dragon’s head was as large as a horse cart, its jaws so wide and powerfulthey could snap a bull in two and swallow it in a single gulp. The yellow eyesburned with an inner fire, and smoke curled from its nostrils. Remembering theburn of the acid flames the silver dragon had spat at him, Utros knew thismassive creature could incinerate him with a single breath.The dragon’s deep voice rumbled like a storm. “Why did you summon me from KulothVale?” The black forked tongue lashed out like a weapon.“I am your master,” Utros said. “I command you to fight for me and my army.”The gray dragon curled its wide serpentine neck. “I am Brom, and I have nomaster.”In response, the general tugged on the magical bond, watched the dragon twitchin surprise. Ava and Ruva worked a spell, muttered incomprehensible words, andjabbed in perfectly synchronized motions. Brom flinched as if they had piercedhim with hot slivers of metal.“I am not yours to command!” Brom retorted. “I guard the bones of my ancestors.”Smoke boiled out of his mouth and flickers of flame curled in the back of histhroat as he spoke. “To my knowledge, I am the last of my kind.”Utros pressed his hand against the golden half mask. “You have a new loyaltynow, a new mission. I call upon our bond. Fight for me. Attack and destroyIldakar.”Brom thrust his great wings into the air, flapping twice with a burst of windthat forced Utros to anchor himself to keep from being blown flat. “I will not.”Utros stood firm. “You must! I command your service.”Ava and Ruva worked their magic, unleashing what they had planned so carefully.Utros had not expected the gray dragon to resist so fiercely, but the twinsorceresses were surprisingly strong. They struck hard with the magic thatconnected them.Brom roared, thrashed his head from side to side, and belched a long ribbon offlame into the air. Ava and Ruva wore malicious, defiant expressions as theyjabbed magic daggers of pain into Brom’s brain.“You will obey me!” Utros said again. “I command you to attack Ildakar.”The sorceresses continued to inflict agony, and the huge gray dragon shudderedas if struck repeatedly by lightning. Though Brom struggled and his yellow eyesflared with hatred and resistance, he finally lowered his immense head towardthe ground in submission before the general.Utros smiled with half a face."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 63 [contents.xhtml#c_ch63]The avalanche that had thundered beneath Kol Adair had erased the ancient roads,so the expedition from Cliffwall took several days to pick their way around thedebris and search through the rubble. Scouts climbed up mountainous slopes,worked their way through the tumbled ice chunks and boulders. They had to find aroute suitable for the horses, and the path was so narrow the mounts had to gosingle file, plodding over the rocks.They also searched for survivors from the annihilated army, to interrogate ifnothing else.In the avalanche path, they climbed over mounds of ice and rubble, discoveringcountless broken bodies. The deadly snow had buried the army, crushed theirbodies, smashed and suffocated them. At the edge of the ice field, Zimmer’sscouts dug out one of the bodies that had been partially exposed in the shiftingsnow. “Look, General!”The ancient soldier had been crushed in the falling glacier. His neck was brokenand his face was slack, his eyes open. Verna stared curiously at the deadwarrior. “He looks so pale.” She had seen corpses many times before, and theyalways had a grayish pallor, but this one’s skin seemed unnaturally white.Bending down, Renn poked at the dead soldier’s cheek. “It’s hard and stiff.”“Probably frozen,” Oliver suggested.“I don’t think so. It is skin, but tougher, as if partly stone.”Zimmer looked down. “They still bleed, and they still die, but they might bemore difficult to kill. But we have fought difficult enemies before.”Renn brushed more snow away to expose the dead man’s chest armor. He sat back,disturbed. “That flame symbol. This man definitely belonged to the army of IronFang, just as the scouts thought.”“Emperor Kurgan,” Verna said. “I have read the histories.”“The histories don’t tell the entire story, because the great General Utrosbrought an army of hundreds of thousands of soldiers to lay siege to Ildakar.”Renn poked the leather armor. “As I’ve told you, our great wizards turned themall to stone with a petrification spell, but something must have awakened them.”He ran his fingers along his patchy beard. He had not shaved since they departedfrom Cliffwall, claiming that the whiskers would keep his face warmer. “Maybeonly this part of the army came back to life and marched away from Ildakar toseek some other home in the mountains.”“And we killed them all,” Amber said, sounding shaken. “We don’t even know ifthey were an enemy.”“They were,” General Zimmer said, looking down at the fallen soldier. “Tenthousand soldiers could not have been on a peaceful mission.” He shook his headagain, looking at the jumbled field in the aftermath of the avalanche.Working her way up among the blocks of ice, wading through the loose snow, Vernacame upon another half-buried figure, and she was startled when he stirred,groaned. “This one is alive! Dear spirits.”She brushed snow from the warrior’s face, saw his expression wrenched with pain,his grayish skin smashed and leaking blood. He coughed. Verna knelt, helping topull the body out of the snow as Renn and General Zimmer hurried closer. Theancient soldier’s eyes were glazed.“Should we help him?” Peretta asked. “Your gift can heal him, Prelate.”“He could tell us information,” Zimmer said.Verna could sense the man’s terrible injuries, his smashed bones and crushedinternal organs. The soldier groaned, and she was astonished he remained aliveat all.She looked at his square features, his eyes squeezed shut, the grimace on hisface. She released enough energy to revive him. “He is … strange inside.” Sheshook her head slightly. “He does not have long.”General Zimmer leaned close. “Who is your commander? What is your mission?”The soldier coughed, and looked around, saw the prelate and the others bendingover him, the unfamiliar uniforms of the D’Haran army.“General Utros,” the soldier said. “We serve Utros, in the name of EmperorKurgan. We will conquer all the lands of the Old World.”Renn looked at the others nearby as his face went as pale as the dyingsoldier’s. His voice grew urgent. “You were at Ildakar. Your army was stone. Isaw it myself! How did the spell fade? What happened? Why were you marching?”“We awakened. Utros will bring down Ildakar and we will also overwhelm the restof the world. It is … our mission.”“Where is the rest of the army?” Renn demanded, sounding more distraught. “Thisis just a small fraction of the general’s forces at Ildakar.”“We were marching…” The soldier stirred, but could not free himself from thesnow packed around his lower body. “Other armies are marching, like this one. Wewill conquer whatever we find.” His stiff face twisted into a pain-racked smile.“But the bulk of our army is still at Ildakar, to bring down the city.”Renn’s face reddened. “Ildakar will never fall!”The soldier choked out a laugh, which made blood spill from the side of hismouth. Verna felt her ability to keep the man alive dwindling away into thechill of the snowfield, but an angry Renn gestured, releasing his own gift, anda crack pushed down on the warrior’s ribs and breastbone, snapping the fragilebody. The soldier shuddered, then lay still.Renn looked ill.General Utros looked at Verna with a stormy expression. “As I thought, this wasan invasion force, and if there are many more just like it marching across theOld World, we already have a war on our hands.”Amber stared down at the dead soldier. “But why? We don’t even know them. Why dothey want to conquer the world?”Verna felt sorry for the innocent girl. After her centuries among the Sisters ofthe Light, the prelate was accustomed to misery. She had taught young wizards tocontrol their gift, lessons that often required a great deal of pain and effort.She had seen incredible death and destruction when Emperor Jagang and hisImperial Order came through Tanimura. She had faced many terrible battlesherself, including the heartbreaking fight that cost the life of her belovedWarren. Yes, she had seen death aplenty.The fresh-faced young novice, though, was new to the violence the world coulddeliver. Her brother, Norcross, had seen bloodshed in the last war, but he wasalso very young. Verna knew, sadly, that violence and killing would age even aninnocent young person far too soon.Zimmer called his soldiers together, designating two of his best scouts. “I amdispatching you back to Cliffwall immediately. Tell them what we just learnedand make sure they are prepared. Our soldiers are facing a much greater threatthan we thought.”“It is not just Cliffwall, but the whole Old World,” Verna said.Renn’s face was florid. “But the biggest threat stands against Ildakar, and thatmakes our mission more important than ever.” He brushed snow from his soggyrobes and glanced urgently over at Captain Trevor. “There’s nothing more to seehere. We know what we did. Now, we should go back to our city as quickly aspossible.”Verna saw the strain on his face. “Renn is correct, General. Have your scoutsfind the best way out of these mountains and on our way to Ildakar. Once we joinforces with Nicci and Nathan, that should give the ancient army something toworry about.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 64 [contents.xhtml#c_ch64]Out on the battlefield, the great gray dragon bowed, snared by the magic of Avaand Ruva, but he did not look defeated.Utros felt more awe than fear. Brom’s enormous eyes flared, his wings archedupward in defiance. His growling exhale sent scorching wafts of brimstone andsmoke toward the general, but Utros held the bond within him. He touched theburnished gold half mask to remind himself of the price he had already paid. “Ineed you to fight for me. My emperor commands it.”The dragon’s voice was blunted by pain, but still exuded a clear threat. “You donot command me, human.”Ava and Ruva interlocked their fingers and joined their magic. Brom curled hishead back as agony exploded inside his skull. He let out another roar.“I do command you,” Utros said calmly. “I need a weapon to defeat that city.Nothing is more powerful than a dragon.”Brom lurched back on his haunches. “I do not care about your petty wars. I amthe guardian of Kuloth Vale, and I must return to my sacred duty.” He flappedhis wings, two huge strokes that lifted his reptilian body partly off theground.Utros called on the bond again. “No, you will destroy the city, defeat myenemies, and break this siege. I don’t care where you go after that, but firstyou must obey me. Grant me my victory.”Brom loomed over the ancient general. “I am a scholar dragon. I know lore fromthousands of years. I know the bones of my ancestors, and I guard their restingplace. I am no one’s weapon.”“You’re a dragon!” Utros said. “Fly to Ildakar, unleash your fire. Terrify thepeople, knock down the towers and walls. Do that, and then you can go free.”Without waiting for the gray dragon to reply, the sorceresses worked their magiconce more and hurled spears of pain into his chest.Brom spewed fire into the sky. Snarling with frustration and anger, the dragonlaunched himself into the air and flew toward Ildakar.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------With a deep groan, the colossal Ixax warriors began to move.Watching them, Nathan felt a rush of fear and excitement. The iron armorscreeched reluctantly as the Ixax lumbered forward, moving on their own for thefirst time in centuries. The turretlike giant waists turned with a creak. TheIxax swiveled their helmets, tilting down to look at Nathan. Though he was agreat wizard, he felt insignificant when these warriors looked at him.He remembered how the first one had pounded Andre into a smear of skin andcrushed bone. If they became treacherous, these Ixax warriors could turn on him,rip down the gates of Ildakar, and wreak havoc throughout the city.“Please…” Nathan whispered, not sure that they could hear him.The Ixax straightened themselves to stare ahead at the countless thousands ofenemy troops and the dragon that had just landed in the general’s camp. Thetitans plodded forward onto the battlefield.“Back inside,” Nicci shouted to the people around him. “Close the gates!”Leaving the large empty carts outside the wall, the duma members, gifted nobles,and workers retreated into the city, and the enormous gates swung closed.Nathan, Nicci, and Elsa hurried to get a view of what the warriors would do.They raced to the top of the wall, where they joined the sentry guards andcountless spectators.Nathan watched the Ixax stride toward the huge army. “This is why they werecreated.”The Ixax warriors strode forward like battering rams on two legs. The ancientsoldiers that filled the valley had focused on the arrival of the dragon, butnow the front ranks turned to face the new threat as the Ixax warriors picked upspeed.The enemy soldiers formed a line, locking their shields in a barricade againstthe oncoming juggernauts. The giant warriors towered over them, and each Ixaxheld a sword in one gauntleted hand, its blade as tall as a man. They wadedamong the enemy ranks like wolves in a chicken coop.Utros’s soldiers were cleaved into pieces, dozens dying in a single stroke of anIxax sword. Hundreds of the ancient soldiers converged around them, heedless oftheir own lives, rushing forward to thwart the giants. In response, the twocolossal warriors slaughtered hundreds and moved deeper into the army camp.From the high wall of Ildakar, the spectators cheered the unleashed Ixax. Niccigrabbed Nathan’s arm and pointed toward the sky. “Look, the dragon! It’s flyingtoward Ildakar!” Utros had apparently won his struggle to command the graymonster. She set her jaw. “I will go to the city’s high point, where I can fightthe dragon if I have to.” She darted off without waiting for him to reply.Nathan watched the titans release their fury. For countless centuries the Ixaxhad been unable to twitch, unable to react, and now all that pent-up anger wasdirected against a real enemy. The two giants swept their huge swords down linesof the half-stone warriors. They smashed with their massive gauntlets. Hundredsmore enemies died, and the Ixax crashed deeper into the army, bashing heads,crushing dozens at a time.Nathan had never felt sympathy for General Utros and his half-petrified army. Hewould have preferred that they saw reason and founded some new land of their ownin the untamed vastness of the Old World, but now he knew they had to bedefeated. Utros would never surrender. He had catapulted the mutilated bodies offallen Ildakaran soldiers over the walls. His two sorceresses had attacked Nicciwith her own hair and they had killed poor Lani.This was a deadly game, and now the Ixax would knock all the game pieces off theboard.Their widening swath of destruction ripped through the enemy army. Thousands laybroken and dead as the titans crashed forward without slowing. Nathan felt greatsatisfaction at what he saw. The Ixax were as powerful as he’d hoped. And theywere following their mission to protect the city. But they still had manythousands more to defeat, and Nathan feared that even those gigantic fightersdidn’t stand a chance.Meanwhile, the gray dragon flapped its enormous wings, flying fast towardIldakar.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As the dragon soared away from Utros, First Commander Enoch galloped up on hiswarhorse, shouting, “Thousands down already, General! We have to fight thosegiants.”Utros had seen the behemoths emerge from the gates of Ildakar, but forcing hiswill on Brom had demanded all his attention. At another time, he would havefound the two huge warriors terrifying and impressive.But he had a dragon.The old veteran’s craggy face was drawn, his gestures frenetic when he heard noresponse. “We need to fight them, General! We need all the magic we can summon.Your sorceresses must blast them.”Utros turned to Ava and Ruva, who looked diminished after their recent effort.“I require all their strength to maintain control on the dragon. We don’t darelet it turn on us, and they have expended so much magic already.”“But look at those giant warriors, sir! We’ll lose much of our army.”Utros watched the towering inhuman giants careering through the ranks of hissoldiers. They seemed unstoppable. He regarded Enoch through his golden halfmask. “Then turn all of our army against them, overwhelm them with sheernumbers. We have more thousands than they can imagine.”With cold detachment, he admired the sheer power unleashed by the armoredmonstrosities. His own soldiers flew in all directions like scattered coins, andfell broken. Utros drew a deep breath, adjusted the horned helmet on his head.“Yes, that is what we must do. Gather our fighters. Those giants may seeminvincible, but we have only two targets, two enemies, and countless ranks tothrow against them.” He smiled with his hardened face. “I am confident we willbe victorious.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As the battle raged outside the walls, Nicci raced to the top of the plateau,where the ruling tower rose high and the broken pyramid marked the night whenthe old order of Ildakar had begun to fall.Beyond the wall, the Ixax warriors continued to mow down countless enemysoldiers, but Nicci turned her attention on the dragon flying high above. Shecould see few details, except for how huge it was. With a beat of powerfulwings, it swooped down, spewing an orange trail of flame in the air. The beasttorched long patches of vineyards, ignited olive groves, burned the roofs ofwarehouses. In the city below, people rushed to find shelter wherever theycould, but neither inner rooms nor root cellars would protect them from abarrage of dragon fire.When Nicci reached the top of the plateau, she raised her hands to the sky andlet out a resounding shout. “Dragon! Come face me.” Using her gift, sheunleashed black and white lightning that skittered across the sky, demanding thecreature’s attention.She began to run up the steps of the broken pyramid, choosing that structureintentionally, since the stone blocks would not catch fire, and there were noother people or homes around. Nicci alone would face the beast.The dragon circled toward her and bellowed from the sting of her lightningbolts. Seeing her scramble up the broken steps of the pyramid, it swoopedcloser.The beast seemed familiar to her, and as it filled its chest to exhale deadlyflames, Nicci called out its name: “Brom!”The dragon faltered, flapping his enormous wings and circling again.“Brom, guardian of Kuloth Vale. Why did you abandon the bones of dragons? Youshould be protecting them, not fighting us.”The gray beast snorted, but seemed curious. Nicci remembered the ancient anddecrepit dragon, his wings tattered, his ribs showing. Even in his aged, weakcondition, Brom had fought to defend the graveyard of dragons. Nicci, Nathan,Bannon, and the girl Thistle had gone to Kuloth Vale because they needed adragon’s rib bone to defeat Life’s Mistress. When they had battled the ancientgray dragon, Nicci’s magic had inadvertently rejuvenated him, giving strengthand energy to the feeble creature.Now Brom was enormous and frightful, a true monster. Backflapping his wings, helanded on the uneven rubble of the pyramid, where Nicci stood before him.With her uneven blond hair still growing out, she didn’t know if Brom recognizedher. Maybe the dragon considered all humans identical. She felt her gift boilwithin her, ready to be unleashed. She shouted bravely, “I fought you beforewhen you were much weaker, Brom. I will fight you again, if you force me.”The gray dragon poised on the broken pyramid, crackling with intelligence andenergy. He sniffed, drawing in a loud hollow snort. Smoke curled around hisscaled face. “You are the sorceress. I remember.”“We met at Kuloth Vale,” Nicci said. “You granted us one rib bone for our needs,and my magic reignited the fires in your heart. I gave you strength and burnedaway some of your age.”“Yes, you did. And I gave you the bone you needed. I no longer have any debt toyou.”“I am not calling in a debt,” Nicci said. “I am only appealing to your commonsense. You are a wise dragon, an ancient scholar. Is a wise dragon drawn into awar that means nothing to him? Why do you fight for General Utros? Why would youcare?”“I do not care. And I do not care about you.”“Then why do it?” she asked.Brom snorted. “He has bound me with magic from a dragon-fire scar on his face.We are joined, and his sorceresses forced me to do his bidding. This once, andthen he says I will be free of him.”“How can anyone force such a powerful creature as yourself?” she asked. “I knowwhere his scar came from. You are not the silver dragon who fought him a longtime ago.”“The connection is weak,” Brom agreed, “but I cannot break it. His sorceressesinflict pain. Utros told me I must destroy Ildakar and burn you all before I canreturn to guard my ancestors. That is all I care about.”Nicci put her hands on her hips. “Then you will force me to fight you, and youalready know that I, too, can inflict pain.”Brom opened and closed his immense jaws. “I do not want this fight.”“I am the one who helped you in Kuloth Vale, gave you back your strength, whileGeneral Utros binds you, forces you, hurts you. He is your true enemy.”Brom thrashed. “I must burn Ildakar, or I will never be free.”Nicci extended her gift, felt the powerful presence of the gray dragon. With herown Han as well as the aura of magic that throbbed through the city ofIldakar—especially here, at the pyramid itself—she could see the faint gossamerthread that strung out from Brom. “His sorceresses bound you, but only with aweak chain. They used a piece of his dragon-burned flesh to call on any dragon.You just happened to be closest.”Brom snorted fire, blasting at the air to release his fury. “I know! I am a wisedragon. Do not think you can fool me.”“I’m not trying to fool you. I am stating the obvious, and my magic is greaterthan the magic those sorceresses wield. I killed a wizard once, and I have hispower as well as my own.” She studied the tenuous line between Brom and Utros.Reaching out, she seized it, and used her gift to sever the link, just as shehad cut the single key strand from her hair when Ava and Ruva attacked her.When the invisible bond broke, Brom reeled. He flared the scaly plates at theback of his head, drew himself up tall, and spread his wings wide. Huge andterrifying, he loomed above the damaged pyramid.“Choose whom you wish to fight,” Nicci said. “I set you free. You may go back toKuloth Vale if you like.” She smiled. “But I have placed a new debt upon you. Ifyou attack General Utros and his army, however, we will be even again.”Brom thrashed his barb-tipped tail. “With pleasure.” He launched himself intothe air again.Energized and angry, the dragon flew above Ildakar and plunged back toward theenemy army."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 65 [contents.xhtml#c_ch65]The screams of slaughtered soldiers, the crunch of bones, the splash of bloodfilled the battlefield, but the Ixax warriors uttered no sound. The titanscovered a dozen paces with every stride. Their iron-shod boots crushed multipleopponents at a time, grinding enemy soldiers underfoot. Their swords decapitatedten at a time. A single blow from a gauntleted fist knocked down steadfastdefensive lines.The Ixax destroyed hundreds, then thousands, and set their gaze on thousandsmore. They moved in tandem as countless enemy soldiers rallied against them,attacking with spears and swords, battering their impenetrable armor. The Ixaxdestroyed anyone who engaged them.First Commander Enoch rode up on his chalky-gray warhorse, raising his sword andyelling to the troops. “Rally! All soldiers of General Utros, rally! We havestrength in numbers. Make your stand!”Messengers raced among the farthest ranks, and the invincible army pulledtogether like a living creature, tens of thousands falling into ranks andrunning in lockstep, perfectly trained.The Ixax warriors smashed forward, as if wading through waves of flesh and bone.Many opponents fell with each blow, but the ancient army did not scatter. Enochknew they wouldn’t. He had spent his life with these men, and he’d trained themfor decades. Now they were all joined by a brotherhood of blood, their familiesdead, lost from time. The only thing remaining to them was the victory thatUtros promised, and they had faith in him.Battle horns sounded, and desperate orders spread like wildfire. “For thegeneral, whatever it takes!” Enoch shouted, and thousands of voices echoed theresounding response. “For the general!”Two companies locked their shields together, pointed their spears, and formed apair of phalanxes. They marched forward with precision in the face of the chaoscaused by the colossal Ixax. More hardened soldiers threw themselves upon thegiants, and they were summarily slain, but more came in their wake to continuethe attack. And then more.Enoch was horrified by the casualties he saw. In the past half hour, more of hiscomrades had been killed than General Utros had lost in all of his militarycampaigns combined. But the general’s army would not retreat, nor would theysurrender. Judging by the uncontrolled destruction caused by the two giants,Enoch knew the Ixax would never give up, either. He couldn’t tell whether thesetitans were intelligent and aware, or just mindless fighters with one purpose.The massive armored warriors would continue to fight until they had killed everyenemy soldier.The only choice was to destroy them, no matter how much blood it cost. GeneralUtros felt the same.Another fanfare sounded, and half-stone soldiers closed in from all directions,tightening the net. The two phalanxes struck the giant warriors, and when theIxax shattered the point of the formation, the soldiers closed up and pushedahead, jabbing with spears. The enraged giants flattened the formation, but thenumbers that flooded in were becoming overwhelming. Around them, bloody, brokenbodies of slain soldiers piled up like mountains.Astride his warhorse, Enoch bellowed orders, but the mayhem of the battlefieldwas simply too loud for anyone to hear him. Even so, the soldiers knew what todo. “For the general!” they cried, their voices scattered and overlapping, andas they repeated it, their shouts fell into a pattern, a rhythmic chant. “ForUtros, for Utros!”The Ixax warriors took down more and more of the ancient soldiers, but GeneralUtros had hundreds of thousands of fighters, all well trained and well armed,each man ready to give his life to cause even a flicker of damage against thetitans. Even Enoch, who had relayed the order, stared in breathless disbelief.The soldiers reminded him of a swarm of ants trying to take down a much largerinsect. They came forward by the thousands, throwing themselves upon the Ixaxwarriors. Their bodies piled up in barricades of bloody flesh, broken bones, andsevered limbs, but they pressed closer to overwhelm the Ixax.Then more came.And then more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Groans of dismay rippled among the spectators on the high walls as they watchedthe Ixax falter against the overwhelming resistance. Nathan unconsciouslywrapped an arm around Elsa’s shoulder, folding her closer to him. Even as thegray dragon circled over Ildakar under some kind of command from General Utros,Nathan watched the vast army switch tactics and close in on the two juggernauts,oblivious to their own casualties. “Dear spirits, they are like locusts.”“More like wasps,” Elsa said, “swarming to sting their enemy.”At the city’s high point, the gray dragon circled, blasting fire in the air, andNathan suddenly recognized Brom from the ancient graveyard of dragons. Niccistood in her black dress, challenging him from the ruins of the pyramid.Out on the battlefield, the Ixax warriors kept slaughtering company aftercompany of the half-stone warriors, but as the numbers turned against the twotitans, Nathan’s hope began to dwindle. Enemy soldiers threw themselves upon thegiants in an endless wave. They piled more and more upon the bodies of their owncomrades and then began to overwhelm the two Ixax, covering them with sheernumbers.Fleshmancer Andre had claimed that his Ixax could each single-handedly slay athousand or more of the enemy, and these two had done far better than that. Tenthousand, possibly even twenty thousand lay massacred. But it wasn’t enough.Utros’s army hacked at them with their weapons, swarming, climbing, fighting,dragging. Finally, they brought down the inhuman fighters like great lumberingbeasts. The two crashed, still struggling, unable to move. The maddened ancientwarriors swarmed over them, eventually pulled them to the ground, and choppedthem to pieces, a thousand cuts at a time.Trembling on the battlements as he watched in horror, Nathan whispered, “I am sosorry for what was done to you.” His azure eyes filled with tears as he watchedtheir end. “I hope you can find peace now. You did better than anyone could haveasked.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------His army did exactly what the general expected them to do. The soldierssurrendered their lives without question for the cause of Emperor Kurgan and forUtros himself. First Commander Enoch unleashed their combined strength, whichproved invincible, as always.Utros turned now to face the impregnable city walls, wanting to see Ildakar burnunder the attack from the dragon. Brom had unleashed fire as he flew above thebuildings, and seeing smoke in the air, Utros knew that some parts of Ildakarwere ablaze.But not enough. The city should be an inferno by now.Next to him, Ava and Ruva both collapsed backward as if stabbed with invisibleknives. They clutched their chests, their hearts, and Utros felt the thread ofmagic that bound Brom to him suddenly severed. Shortly after the army toppledboth Ixax warriors, the dragon came surging back to the battlefield.The enormous gray beast soared toward their army. Utros braced himself, feelingdisbelief build within him. “The dragon is free now. How did he break free?” Hewhirled to his sorceresses. “Get him back! I need that dragon.”Ava and Ruva frantically tried to restore their magic, but they could not. Avasaid, “Your scar was only enough to create the one bond, and because Brom wasnot the dragon who injured you, the hold was tenuous from the start.”Ruva said, “Someone broke the bond.” They looked at each other, and saidsimultaneously, “Nicci. The sorceress Nicci must have done it.”The angry dragon thundered toward the huge besieging army. With beating wingsthat looked like axe blades in the air, Brom swooped away from Ildakar andcruised low on an attack flight. He unleashed a river of fire upon thescattering ranks of the general’s army. Columns of half-petrified soldiersturned into smoking debris. Entire companies were flattened as if by a giant hotcudgel.Utros had already withdrawn toward his headquarters, planning to activate theblood lens so he could announce his victory to Iron Fang in the underworld. Butnow the gray dragon came for them.Brom flew over the giant knot of soldiers who had converged to bring down theIxax warriors. With blasts of acid flame, the monster ignited countlessscreaming men, demonstrating his might and punishing Utros and the sorceressesfor what they had done.The dragon angled up into the air again, filling his lungs so he could dive downand unleash another incinerating assault. He was searching for Utros inparticular, but because the bond was now broken, all the human forms down belowlooked the same. The dragon blasted rows of tents, exploding shacks andstorehouses, searing the blood-soaked ground.The general stood near the tall oval lens crafted with the blood of innocentchildren. “We can’t let him damage this!” Utros yelled. “Ava, Ruva, protect it!”Brom swept closer, opening his jaws wide. Spotting Utros and the blood lens, hedove and unleashed a powerful gout of flame directly at the general. With ashriek, Ava and Ruva clasped each other’s hands and raised a protective wall,shaping the air into an impenetrable shield around the three of them as well asthe lens. Flames washed over them, and Utros felt the searing heat in spite ofhis mostly numb skin.The invisible shield diverted the fire to either side. Behind them, the commandstructure erupted in flames, the wooden walls crumbling to ash within seconds.The magical shield held, though, and they were spared. The lens to theunderworld remained intact.The dragon flew past, gushing out more fire before Brom exhausted his anger andvengeance. The ancient gray dragon had made his point.Utros collapsed backward to the ground. The smell of burning wood, grass, andflesh rose all around him. He stared into the sky as Brom bellowed his defianceone last time, flew high into the air, and turned north toward the mountains andKuloth Vale."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 66 [contents.xhtml#c_ch66]Beyond the walls of Ildakar, the siege forces reeled from the devastation. Niccicould see that the Ixax warriors and the gray dragon had struck a ringing blowto the confident enemy army, and for the first time, General Utros tasted thebitter and very real possibility of defeat.Returning to the ramparts near the towering main gate, Nicci looked out at thescorched enemy camp. She saw rivers of blackened soil where soldiers had beenobliterated by Brom’s fire, the mounds of bodies slain by the Ixax warriors. Shedoubted Utros could recover from this.“Now is the time to press our case and demand that the general end this siege,”she said.Nathan stroked his chin. “I agree, although with such a defeat, he may not be ina mood for a gentlemanly discussion.”High Captain Stuart, standing with them on the top of the wall, was glad to seethe vast army in turmoil. “As captain of the city guard, I will ride out anddeliver a message to General Utros. I will insist that he negotiate an end tothese useless hostilities.”Damon and Quentin were pleased with the suggestion, though Oron seemedskeptical. “I’d rather just kill the general once and for all. Will we be ableto trust him, whatever he negotiates?”“We have to try, at least,” Elsa said. Olgya agreed.Stuart’s eyes were flintier after the surprise nighttime attack in which so manyof his city guard had been killed, but now he had hope again. He took a horse,and the duma members wished him good luck as they opened one of the small gates.Sitting tall in the saddle, the high captain rode out to the enemy army, andNicci watched as several of the half-stone soldiers met him and escorted himdeeper into the damaged camp.Quentin said, “While we wait, let us discuss what terms we might suggest. Wehave to be prepared when General Utros responds.”Rather than convening inside the ruling tower, Nicci suggested that they gatherat the pyramid, where they could watch the gates and see when Stuart returned.At the top of the plateau, the duma members worked their way up the damagedsteps to the third tier. Nicci brushed dust off her black dress and staredacross the burned grasslands. So many soldiers remained out there, Utros stillposed an enormous threat, and he had already dispatched tens of thousands inseparate exploratory armies across the Old World.Damon sat on the stone blocks, looking pleased. He released his gift to shiftsome of the rubble back into place. “We will restore Ildakar to its glory, nowthat we have the chance.”Quentin assisted, and soon the gifted duma members had cleared the rubble fromwhere the sacrifices had been held.Elsa slipped her arm through Nathan’s as they climbed higher to where they couldlook out over the city. “We are all exhausted,” she said. “We have used so muchmagic to defend ourselves, but it was worth the effort. Now General Utros has todiscuss terms with us. He knows how powerful we are.”Quentin clapped his hands as if expecting slaves to rush in at his summons. “Weshould have a feast! Call a day of remembrance here in Ildakar.”Nicci looked at the duma member with sharp annoyance. “This is not the time forcelebration. Look out there!”Nathan sketched a rectangle in the air and created his magnifying window so theycould have a better look at the row after row of powerful ancient warriors,still ready to fight, no matter how many had just been slain.“Look at them,” Nicci said. “We unleashed the two Ixax, the most powerfulfighters the wizards of Ildakar ever created. They killed tens of thousands ofthe enemy, but they are gone now. The dragon fought on our behalf, and his fireincinerated thousands more, but he is also gone.” She narrowed her blue eyes.“Yes, we should be proud of the damage we just caused, but we have used ourgreatest weapons, and Ildakar is still under siege. By my guess, two-thirds ofthe enemy army still remains.” She jabbed at Nathan’s expanded view, feeling heranger. “No, it is not a time for celebrations, until the general capitulates.”The duma members were cowed into silence as she continued, “We will maintain ourdefenses and stand against the siege, but Ildakar isn’t just one city holdingfirm against an army. The whole continent is at stake.”“This is the greatest city in history,” Oron said with a snort. “No one isstronger than the wizards of Ildakar. If we can’t stop Utros, what chance doesthe rest of the world have?”Nicci regarded him coolly. “My point exactly. Ildakar has greater defenses thanany other city, yet General Utros has us at a stalemate. That army is still morepowerful than we can defeat.” She felt hardness in her heart and determinationin her mind. “Ildakar cannot do this alone.”“I doubt even the D’Haran army could stand against a regimented force like thegeneral’s,” Nathan muttered.Quentin said with a sigh, “I had hope after seeing so much destruction, but nowI realize we are in just as much danger as before.”“High Captain Stuart will convince the general to talk,” Elsa said. “We need tomake him see that there is no reason for his war anymore. There must be a way tobring peace, and then we can all thrive.”Nathan shifted his magnifying window toward a commotion near the center of thecamp. Stiff soldiers were leading the high captain’s horse back toward the citywalls. Perched on the saddle like a shocking trophy, Stuart’s head staredforward with glassy, open eyes. His mouth was slack, as if he’d been decapitatedin the middle of issuing his invitation to General Utros. The enemy soldiers ledthe horse and its gruesome reply toward the gates of Ildakar.Elsa began to weep as Nathan dissolved the aperture of air.Nicci stared with her hard, blue eyes. “Now I am even more determined thatIldakar must not stand alone. Utros will not give up.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------With a pack of possessions, clean traveling boots, black dress, and the wrappedpane of glass with the preserved image of the siege army, Nicci stood in frontof the damp-smelling well. “Sliph, I summon you!” She had lit two glowing ballsof light, which hovered in the air, creating sharp shadows inside the enclosure.After her voice died away, she called again. “Sliph, I wish to travel.”The murder of High Captain Stuart had galvanized the duma members to find someother means to attack the wounded enemy army, and Elsa had raised thepossibility of grand-scale transference magic that could impact the entire army.She had an idea that might cause as much destruction as the dragon.Quentin and Damon fell into frenetic preparations, their eyes showing the raggededge of panic. In an uncertain voice, Damon said, “Maybe we should considerreleasing Thora again. She is a powerful sorceress.”“She’s also not to be trusted,” Nathan said.No one could argue with that, and yet the suggestion hung in the air like therumbling echoes of thunder.More than ever, Nicci knew she had to rally the rest of the Old World, and shedecided she would swiftly travel to other cities with her warning. Simplyrallying Tanimura wouldn’t be enough. She had to form an alliance with the otherlands that would be threatened by General Utros. She had turned her back on theduma, no longer interested in their endless deliberations. “I have my ownmission.”She had gone to the isolated well hidden in the low building, and now sheshouted again, impatient. “Sliph! I wish to travel.”Finally, the sound of bubbling silver roiled upward until the mirrorlike surfacefilled the well. The feminine shape emerged. “You have another mission for thecause? I demand to know whether your other work succeeded. Are we winning therevolt?”Nicci didn’t lie outright. “We continue to face many challenges.”“Where is Emperor Sulachan? Why have I not seen Lothain? I do not know you.”“You know me. I have traveled in you, and I must travel again. Take me toSerrimundi. I need to find our allies there and prepare them for war.”She knew the sliph would hear what she wanted to hear, but the silvery womanstill seemed doubtful. “And they will fight for Emperor Sulachan?”“That is not your concern. Do you know Serrimundi? I need to travel there.”“I know many places, but I exist only to serve our cause. Tell Emperor Sulachanthat he should travel in me. I will take him where he needs to go. I will carryhim to victory.”“Emperor Sulachan does not take orders,” Nicci said.The sour-faced sliph’s form shifted and reshaped, reflecting the magical lightin the air.“Take me to Serrimundi,” Nicci said again.Clearly angry, the sliph lurched up to engulf her. “Breathe!” she commanded,then dragged Nicci under."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 67 [contents.xhtml#c_ch67]The camp was devastated, as was the general’s heart. As a military commander hefelt the pain and anger as he considered how many soldiers he had lost in oneday. Killing the smug emissary from Ildakar had done almost nothing to assuagethe pain. Nevertheless, Utros had made his answer clear.Ildakar would fall, under his terms.All these men had sworn their loyalty to him centuries ago. Without a qualm theyhad offered their lives in service, but none of them knew when they marched awayfrom Orogang that they were giving up their homes, their sweethearts, theirchildren—forever. Now their comrades were all they had.Utros stood outside his makeshift new command tent, a large structure stretchedacross support beams. The fabric was stained with soot, salvaged from a scorchedwagon that soldiers had dragged away from the flames. A gray drizzle hadextinguished any fires that still smoldered, but the smell of bitter ashlingered in the air.Though the recent attack was incredibly devastating, he suspected that it wasthe worst that Ildakar could produce. Perhaps the great city was now mostlydefenseless. The giant warriors had been destroyed, and Ildakar surely had nomore of them, or they would have turned them loose during the battle.The dragon had also wrought a terrible amount of damage—damage that should havebeen inflicted on Ildakar. Iron Fang had commanded him to summon the monster,but Utros had experience with the capricious and vicious nature of dragons. Inhindsight, he wasn’t surprised at what Brom had done.In the aftermath he had to report his failure to Emperor Kurgan. He had losttens of thousands of men to the Ixax warriors and the dragon, without a singlestone being knocked from the city’s walls. Sadly, Utros would also have toconfess his failure to Majel, which made his heart and mind heavy.In the smoky daylight he stepped up to the blood lens, staring at its curvedsurface like a man gazing into a mountain tarn. The murky glass did not reflectback at him, nor could he see through the greenish mists, but Ava and Ruvatouched the markings around the lens and called upon their gift to illuminatethe runes. Energy sparkled through the glass, then clarified until the veil tothe underworld became transparent.Iron Fang and the raw, red form of Majel were there waiting for him on the otherside of the lens. “I am ready for your report, General,” Kurgan said, showingoff his sharp metal tooth. “Did you follow my commands?”“Yes, my emperor. My sorceresses worked their spell. We summoned a dragon as youcommanded.” Utros felt the words like hot lead in his mouth. He chose hisrevelations carefully, but he was only delaying his shame.Kurgan was delighted by the news, but Majel’s skinned face bore no readableexpression. Iron Fang roughly grabbed his wife’s peeled shoulder and squeezedthe exposed meat. “You see, your lover hasn’t failed me. Tell us, General Utros!Have you finally broken Ildakar? Is the city now conquered in my name?”Utros lowered his gaze. “I am afraid not, my liege.” The two sorceresses steppedback, their faces drawn with concern. This was his battle to face. “The dragoncame and was bound to me. I forced it to attack the city.”“Then Ildakar should be a smoking ruin by now!”Majel breathed out a long, low sigh. “Oh Utros, what happened?”“The dragon broke its bond and turned on us instead. Someone in Ildakar waspowerful enough to disrupt the magic, and the monster killed thousands of mysoldiers.” Utros squared his shoulders. “The wizards of Ildakar also created twogiant warriors, which they unleashed against my army. More than thirty thousandof my fighters were killed before we destroyed them.”Kurgan was furious. “And you allowed this? You call yourself a great commander!”Utros had never boasted about being a great commander, although he did his bestto be one. From the emissary Nathan, he knew that history had painted him as ahero, as a genius. In the past, his victories might have warranted such acharacterization, but after the recent losses and tremendous setbacks,historians might describe him differently.“I will continue to do my best, Emperor Kurgan. Our siege will break the city,but it may take time.”“Time,” Kurgan said with a rude snort. “You have already had fifteen centuries.Should I wait another hundred years? A thousand? You are a failure and adisappointment, General Utros. You marched off with my invincible army toconquer the world, but you took too long. Because you were gone from Orogang, mypeople turned against me. If you had been there, my reign would not have ended.My empire would have endured.”His words came out fast and angry, dripping with venom. Kurgan pressed closer tothe lens so that his image filled a large portion of the glass. He sneered.“Then again, if you had been there, then you would have betrayed me with mywife, again and again in your tent or in my own imperial bed.” He glowered atMajel, who stood woodenly, her torn face quivering.Kurgan reached out and stroked her slick cheek, where he had carved the skin offher face with a filleting knife. Utros clenched his fists, wanting to reachthrough the lens to grasp Kurgan around the throat.“But she loves me now,” Iron Fang said. “Here in the underworld, poor Majelunderstands her error. The Keeper has left her physical form like this, so shecan always remember what she did to me.”Majel also caressed Iron Fang. Her voice wavered. “Yes, my husband.” Utros hadheard that voice so many times whispering in his own ear. “Loyalty is strongerthan love.”“I am so sorry, Majel,” Utros said, a groan deep in his throat.“My wife is none of your concern,” Kurgan snapped. “You are my general. Youcould have had any whore in your camps, yet you chose the one woman sworn toyour emperor.”“I am yours now, my love,” Majel said to Kurgan, not looking at Utros, whoseheart felt stony, his emotions broken. Iron Fang kept staring through the lensat him, impatient and annoyed, and he slapped away the fawning caresses of themangled woman. “Swear your loyalty to me again, Utros. Promise that you willdefeat Ildakar and then finish conquering the Old World. For me.”“I swore it to you a long time ago,” Utros said. “That hasn’t changed.”He knew that Majel was just speaking the words, forced to stay with the emperorin the underworld. Could a spirit feel pain? Physical pain? Certainly emotionalpain—he could read it in her face. But something had changed deep within her.She had not forgotten him, but maybe her love had died when her physical bodydid.“Majel…” he whispered.Kurgan shoved her away, and Majel’s bloody form fell out of view. Iron Fang’simage filled the entire glass oval. “You are my general. You are my servant. Youare my slave. Even from the underworld, I am still your emperor. Swear to methat you will conquer the continent, as you were meant to do.”Utros clenched and unclenched his stony fists. “Yes, I swear it.” He could nolonger see Majel’s mutilated form, but Kurgan was even more hideous in his ownway.Utros did not make empty vows. He had spoken the words many times. He knew thatloyalty was stronger than love, and his hundreds of thousands of soldiers wereentirely loyal to him. His soldiers had often told him so, but he was blinded byhis own loyalty to a petulant leader who did not deserve it. His every victorywas for the glory of Iron Fang, while the soldiers in his army did it for him.If Utros did tear down Ildakar and conquer the Old World, maybe he should do itfor his own purposes, rather than for the unworthy emperor. Such a man did notdeserve to rule. Such a man was dead because his own people had torn him apart.Such a man should no longer be issuing orders to General Utros.Perhaps it had been a mistake to create this lens. Emperor Kurgan no longer hadanything to say that Utros needed to hear. The general didn’t bow, didn’t speakanother word to his emperor, whose face still filled the lens.Instead, with a sweep of his hand, he smothered the magic in one of the glowingrunes, and the images faded back into impenetrable green mists."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 68 [contents.xhtml#c_ch68]Inside her villa, Elsa sat in the courtyard next to her peaceful fountain. Thesound of the running water helped inspire her, and Nathan felt the same. She hadsheets of paper and a stylus on which she drew experimental designs,spell-forms, and connecting runes that she could activate using transferencemagic.Nathan had taken several old volumes from Renn’s cluttered library, tomes ofmagical lore that the wizard had shared with Lani. Nathan felt a pang for whathad happened to the sorceress. He rubbed the scar on his chest, feelingoccasional slivers of phantom pain in his heart.General Utros had no idea how weakened the wizards of Ildakar had become, somany powerful duma members gone. Nathan was determined to find some otherunexpected defense before the ancient general recovered enough to make a newmove. “Dear spirits, how do we do this ourselves?” he muttered, but Elsa was toodeep in concentration to hear him.She bit her lower lip as she scribbled small designs and added connecting lines.“Transference magic is usually a stage-to-stage spell, one spell-form connectedto a counterpart, using the magic in an even exchange, but in order to increasethe power, maybe we can segregate, then amplify it.” She tapped her stylus onthe paper where she had drawn eight smaller runes in a circle and connected themlike the spokes of a wheel. “Through a central point, we can widen the flow,like a pipe delivering water.” She glanced over at her fountain. “If the pipe isonly as wide as your finger, that limits the amount of water you can transport.But if we widen the conduit to a foot in diameter, imagine the water we coulddeliver.” She scribbled on her paper, then glanced up at Nathan, who was lookingat her with admiration.“I see what you mean, my dear,” he said. “Are you suggesting it might bepossible to flood the entire plain and wash away the siege?”“That might do, but it’s not necessarily destructive enough,” Elsa said. “I wasthinking of a flood of magic. Let me keep developing this.”Glad to be in the other woman’s company, Nathan paged through the books. He sawnotations Renn had made in the margins, but the portly wizard had not been inthe mind-set for war when he did his research. He’d been looking for ways tocombine wind chimes and fountains for his own villa.After several hours of his fruitless searching, while Elsa expanded hertransference runes, they both needed to rise and stretch. “Let’s go see whatOlgya is doing in the silk spinners’ guild,” Elsa suggested. “We shouldn’tdismiss any possible advantage. Maybe she has come up with something.”“I am curious about the weaving operations myself,” Nathan said. He had cleanedhis white robes and admired the cool and comfortable silk. “Her new enhancedfabrics are nearly as good as armor. If you will lead the way?”They walked through the nobles’ district, passing citrus orchards and lushflower beds. The trees along the next boulevard had darker leaves and weremanicured into rounded shapes, but some were entirely stripped of leaves.Workers stood under the trees with baskets, plucking leaves in a swiftmethodical motion. “What are they doing?” Nathan asked. “Are the leaves used forfood? Medicine? Spices, maybe?”“They are mulberry leaves.” When she realized he didn’t understand thesignificance, Elsa added, “Silkworms prefer to eat mulberry leaves.”Ahead, Nathan saw a large open structure with tall support beams and crossbraces over the roof. Smaller open storehouses were stacked with bolts ofcolorful cloth, one on top of the other, like rolled rainbows.Dozens of people moved in and out, including workers with baskets full of darkleaves. Doorway curtains breathed in and out as a pair of men hurried along witha bolt of bright red silk. Nathan heard the voices of workers inside thebuilding, along with another sound … rustling, rattling, whispering. Elsa pushedaside the gray doorway curtain and led him into the cavernous warehouse.Nathan felt as if he had fallen into the web of a tunnel spider. The walls andrafters were covered with meshed webs, sheets of silken strands that extendedfor twenty or thirty feet. Drooping banners hung down like the sides of asagging tent. He smelled a sweet resinous scent that clung to the fibers.Workers dumped baskets of leaves into wide troughs, and Nathan saw green wormsas long as his forearm, chewing and squirming. With their blind, flat heads,they gorged themselves like maggots on rotted flesh. Men and women bustledabout, stepping around Nathan and Elsa.Olgya stood near several rattling and clacking looms where workers fed in theraw silk threads and created sheets of the marvelous fabric. She quicklyfinished her instructions to the weavers, then turned to Nathan and Elsa with afrown. “Is this duma business? We are working as swiftly as we can.”“We just wanted to have a better understanding of your efforts,” Nathan said. “Ihave never seen silk weaving before.”“The worms make the silk strands,” Olgya said. “We make the fabric.” Tense withher desperate work, she was a wiry mass of energy. Her silk robes were patternedwith beautiful designs, primarily green and blue with a flash of red and orange.Her many ribboned clumps of hair looked somewhat disheveled. “The worms eat andeat, and they mature in only a few days, thanks to fleshmancy, and they nolonger go into a pupa. They used to mature over time and then spin theircocoons, which we unraveled for the silk, one cocoon per worm. These alteredworms are different, larger, and they produce large, furry cocoons that provideall the silk we need, and they remain worms for at least ten cycles. They spin acocoon and then go back to eating until they’re fattened up, and soon spinanother cocoon.”Green, quivering worms crawled out of the troughs, finding a perch in a networkof dowels and false branches, where they extruded glistening strands fromspinnerets. Even as the cocoons hardened, workers detached an anchor line of thethreads and then rolled the fibers onto wooden batons, which they took over tothe looms.“And this silk will help in the war effort?” Nathan asked.Olgya showed them the magical loom, a clattering wooden machine with metalhinges, wires, and cross wires that held the emerging fabric. Runes carved inthe wood glowed a pale blue, and the silk fibers absorbed some of that glow asthe cloth grew inch by inch. Weavers used their gift to guide the process.“The new silk is highly protective.” Olgya took them to the far end of the loom,where the fabric emerged. “Special pigments further enhance its strength, butthis is already ten times stronger than normal silk and it can protect ourpeople against the blows of enemy soldiers, like fine mesh armor.” She gaveNathan a challenging glance, noting the ornate sword he wore at his side. “Tryto cut this silk with your blade. Thrust the point right through.”Nathan withdrew his sword. It felt good to hold the weapon, and he poked thesword into the silk, but the sharp point didn’t cut through.“Harder!” Olgya commanded.He stabbed downward so that the fabric belled out, showing the pointed shape ofthe tip, but he couldn’t pierce the cloth.“Harder!”Nathan pulled back and thrust with all his strength, jabbing and jabbing as ifthe cloth represented his most hated enemy, but he still couldn’t pierce it. Thecloth remained rigid enough to stop most of the damage to the skin of itswearer. “I must say I am impressed.”“Enemy arrows or blades cannot penetrate it. Our soldiers will be safe, althoughit was not enough to protect my Jed.” Her firm voice suddenly cracked. “That boydid not want to fight, and he paid the ultimate price. I never thought to raisehim as a soldier, since he was the son of a gifted noble. Why should he everhave to worry about being killed in battle?” She shuddered, and then herexpression became stony again. “We all have to fight. We all do our part, eventhe silkworms.” She looked at the thick cobwebs of fresh silk fiber. “We aredriving them to burn their energy, and some of them don’t survive.”Three silkworms drooped over the edge of a trough and fell, flaccid and limp.Workers plucked the soft bodies and cast them into a basket full of dead worms,while others dumped in more mulberry leaves for the thriving worms to devour.Nathan listened to the chitter and rustle of the voracious creatures as they ateleaves and spun their cocoons, as the loom rattled and clacked, as the workersrolled the fresh silk fabric and carried it to the storehouse.“We each do our part,” Elsa repeated. “Because if we fail, Ildakar fails, andthen we all die.” She turned to Nathan with an incongruous grin on her face.“But I have just realized exactly what to do with my transference magic, and howI can smash a good portion of the siege army. I think this will work!”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 69 [contents.xhtml#c_ch69]Thora remained locked in the dungeon cell, bored and frustrated, but this timethe prison was of her own making. Although protective runes were again chiseledin the stone blocks around the door, she knew how to break free. She could smashher way out of the cell any time she chose, and her captors knew that. But sherefused.How odd, Thora thought, that the people who had betrayed her, the people whoconsidered their own sovrena to be a danger to them, would grant her such ameasure of trust. Yet, she had surrendered, and she did indeed want to save hercity. She remained in the cell, bound by chains of her own guilt. For Ildakar.Though she sat quietly, her thoughts never rested. For hours at a time, shewould ignite a bright glow that illuminated the bare stone walls. Other times,swallowed by black thoughts, Thora preferred darkness and she would sitsurrounded by possibilities.Previously, when she escaped, a kind of blindness had convinced her to abandonIldakar. She had actually made up her mind to aid General Utros, the true enemy.Thora realized now that she had been mad. Despair and frustration had twistedher thoughts, tangled them like a mass of tentacles, and she almost made aterrible mistake, worse than any mistake she’d ever made.Something had broken inside her, though, when she stood on that wall, ready tothrow herself to the ancient army. Her heart had undergone a metamorphosis, likeone of Olgya’s enhanced silkworms that was finally allowed to enter a cocoonafter a lifetime of exhausting service. Thora knew that Ildakar would endure. Itwas still her perfect city, and she had to help preserve it, if the duma membersever allowed her to do so.She was different from Maxim. Her treacherous husband had done everythingpossible to destroy Ildakar, not for any grand purpose, but simply because hewas bored. She would not be like him. Yet she remained isolated here, as ifsealed in a tomb.When she heard whispering voices in the corridor, the rattle of the lock, shedrew herself up, straight-backed and proud. She faced the door and shielded hereyes against the sudden flood of light as two men in wizard’s robes greeted her.“Sovrena, we need to speak with you.” The gruff voice belonged to Quentin.Though she had been contemplating possibilities in the dark, she summoned thebright glow again to light her chamber. Damon stood next to Quentin, lookinguncertain, even frightened.She narrowed her eyes. “You have come alone. No one else knows you’re here?” Thetwo men looked skittish, like the larks Thora had kept in cages. “Where isLani?” she demanded when they didn’t answer. “Why isn’t she here to taunt me?”“Lani is dead,” Damon said, his frown enhanced by the long mustaches. “Thegeneral’s sorceresses killed her when she used a scrying spell to spy on them.She drowned in her own scrying water.”Thora fought to hide her satisfaction. “And now you need me. How can I help? Iwant to fight.”“Ildakar needs you.” Quentin scratched his round cheek as he and Damon explainedthe recent battle, how they had unleashed the two remaining Ixax warriors, howthe dragon had come.“But we have no more significant defenses, and the ancient army is stillimpossibly powerful,” Damon said. The bangs on his forehead nearly reached hiseyes and he subconsciously brushed them out of the way. “We have to use everypossible means to save the city.”Thora was surprised. “And what of Nicci? I thought she was so powerful she couldsingle-handedly save the world. Isn’t that what Nathan Rahl’s life bookpredicted? That she would save the world!” She snorted, but controlled heranger. She had been isolated so long she needed to hear whatever these twowizards could tell her.“Nicci abandoned us again to go rally other cities, and she may never comeback,” Quentin said.“Why should she?” Damon asked. “It is only a matter of time before Ildakarfalls. The other duma members are digging through magical lore and testingobscure spells. Elsa believes she has an innovative transference rune to presentto the duma, but that plan is not certain and seems desperate.”“It will never be enough,” Quentin interjected with a groan. “That is why wehave to be realistic. That is why we came to you.”Damon swallowed audibly. “Quentin and I have concluded there is only one sureway to protect Ildakar for all time, a way that we never need to worry aboutGeneral Utros or any enemy again.”Quentin nodded. “We have to raise the shroud of eternity again. And we will needyour help, Sovrena, if you are willing.”Thora had already guessed where the conversation would lead. “When I surrenderedat the wall, I vowed to you that Ildakar was sacred to me, that I would doanything to save my city, if only you would let me. I meant that.”Damon and Quentin looked at each other, relieved. “We can do much of thepreparation work ourselves. In fact, we’ve already begun. While Nicci is goneand Nathan and Elsa are making plans for her transference-rune scheme, we havespread the word secretly among the citizens. We are collecting names. Some arevolunteers, some are … suggestions.”Thora touched her hard, cold cheek, feeling the infusion of stone there. “Youunderstand how terrible the cost will be? How much blood will be required? Youwill need a great many people, and gifted blood is the strongest.”“We know,” Quentin said. “So does everyone, but they can also see the enemy armyoutside. They think of their families. They think of the future. They know thatif the general breaks down our gates, the city will be laid waste. Nothing willremain but rubble. All their families will be slaughtered. Even some rebels haveoffered to be sacrificed.”“Rebels?” Thora scowled. “They broke down our traditions and the boundaries ofthe classes. Why would they help?”Damon shrugged. “They wanted to be free. Now they need to understand the cost offreedom. If everyone wants to be equal in their new Ildakar, then they mustaccept equal responsibility.”Damon’s voice cracked. “And they are agreeing! They understand. Some even quotethe words of Mirrormask, vowing to fight and die for the future of theirfamilies and friends.”Thora was surprised. “My husband was never sincere in his words. He made themup.”“They were good words, no matter his motivations,” Quentin said. “What isimportant is how his followers heard them, not what was in the wizardcommander’s heart.”Thora wondered if he was still alive, since Adessa had been hunting him for sometime now. She pointed out, “The pyramid is destroyed, the blood channels andspell-forms gone, the apparatus ruined. How will you work so much blood magic?”“I can remake the equipment,” Damon said, “and we don’t require the pyramid. Wejust need a place for the sacrificial victims to gather.”Quentin added, “And we need executioners to shed all that blood to work themagic and raise the shroud.”Thora remained dubious. “Even with the best of intentions, I’m not certain youwill find enough volunteers.”“As I said, we have a large list of names,” Quentin said. “And we’ve compiled asecond book of people we can take by force, if we need more blood. We canmandate one sacrifice from each family.”Thora felt warm inside, a glimmer of pride for her city. “Then maybe Ildakar canbe saved after all. I will help in any way I can. Come to me when your plans areready.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 70 [contents.xhtml#c_ch70]Maxim found just the place to rest and hide while he gathered his strength, acozy cottage in the forested hills above the Killraven River. He had traveled agreat distance, covering his tracks all along the way. He’d abandoned his smallstolen boat from Tarada at another river town and then moved on.He had encountered many settlements on the banks, since the widening riverprovided food and work for so many people, but Maxim didn’t want to live in atown again, not yet. He did intend to build a new empire greater than Ildakar,but that would come in time, and Maxim had plenty of time.His mistake at Tarada was that he’d been in too much of a hurry. He had waitednearly a thousand years for the downfall of stagnant Ildakar, and by now thecity was surely destroyed by the stone army he had awakened. He couldn’t expectto create a comparable city in only a year or two.Here, up in the hills above a small river town called Gant’s Ford, Maxim settledin to a time of impatient peace, maybe for months. The isolated cottage wasspacious, with a main area and hearth. A large bed for the mother and father wasblocked off by a hanging leather curtain, while a smaller room off to the sidehad three narrow beds for the children. In the fireplace, an iron hook held acauldron for a pot of soup, as well as iron skewers for roasting fish brought upfrom the town market, or squirrels or hares caught in the forest.In the larder behind the cottage, the father had hung strings of venisonsausages. Chickens ran about in the yard, pecking at beetles and worms, takingcare of themselves. Maxim, the former wizard commander of Ildakar, was not a manto tend barnyard fowl.Someday when he built a grand city again, he would have uniformed guards,servants to attend to his every need, practitioners talented in the art ofmassage after he luxuriated in a perfumed bath, young women for his bed. Hewould have clothiers create magnificent garments for him out of the finestfabrics, the softest weaves, the warmest furs. His jewelry would be crafted bythe most skilled smiths in his domain.He sighed, missing Ildakar more than he’d thought he would.For now, this cottage was an acceptable home. The forest silence was comforting,enhanced by the sound of rushing spruce boughs in the breezes. The man and hiswife had cut down the tallest trees, leaving stumps in the front yard. Blocks offirewood were stacked against the cottage, and an axe rested next to one of thestumps that served as a chopping block. When he ran out of split firewood forthe hearth, though, Maxim didn’t deign to swing the ax, but used his gift toexpand cracks in the logs, shattering them into pieces the fireplace couldaccommodate. He was resourceful, even self-sufficient.After fleeing through the swamps for days, avoiding predators as well as themaddeningly determined Adessa, he was glad to have a safe and quiet place toreside. He knew she wouldn’t give up, although if Adessa had any sense at all,she would realize she could never defeat a wizard commander! The protectivebranded runes would save her from an overt attack of magic, but she had nopowers remotely comparable to his own. He’d been shocked at how strong themorazeth was when she tried to kill him, and he wondered where that enhancedstrength came from. Had Thora found a way to trigger some manifestation of thegift in Adessa? It was annoying.As he moved through the silent home, he plucked at the clean linen shirt thathad been the husband’s. The trousers were too large, and he needed a rope beltaround the waist to hold them up, but that was part of his disguise. HisIldakaran garments had been beyond repair, and he’d discarded the gray robes hehad worn as Mirrormask. At Tarada, he’d been forced to flee so swiftly he hadbeen unable to bring extra clothes. At least he no longer looked like a beggar.After he used a small glamour spell, people in Gant’s Ford gave him what heneeded. He just had to lie low for now, like a bear hibernating for the winter,and eventually he would emerge with detailed plans to conquer the world. Thesolitude was the hardest part. After living for so many centuries in Ildakar,Maxim was not accustomed to being alone.Once every two or three days he would make the hour walk down the forest path tothe river town. He called no attention to himself in his rough-spun clothes, andpeople assumed he was one of the many woodcutters, farmers, and hunters wholived in the wild. Maxim ate food from the inns, and he especially liked thecatfish pie. Sometimes he spent coins he’d found in a jar inside the cottage,while other times he just worked a forgetting spell and left without paying. Hedrank the town’s sour ale and grimaced, even tried some wine that came frombarges upriver. Once, he asked if the tavernkeeper possessed any bloodwine fromIldakar, and the portly man had just laughed at him, explaining that bloodwinewas an extravagance no one in town could afford.Maxim convinced himself that he was getting to know the poor people, thehardworking ungifted types. When he played his role as Mirrormask, he hadpretended to understand the plight of the lower classes. He had learned theright words to say and watched how easily people reacted to his promises. Hecould incite them with honeyed words about freedom, although the people inGant’s Ford were already free, and they knew their lot in life would neverchange for the better.Later, after he had his fill of people, Maxim would walk back up the path to hiscottage in the hills, where he continued to dream of greater conquests.One afternoon, the silence and boredom weighed heavily on him, and he left thecottage. Out in the yard the wild chickens clucked and fled, though he had nointention of killing them. That would be too messy, too much work.The family kept a garden plot with onions, beans, and a squash plant whose vinessprawled across the ground. Behind the cottage, a line of brambles held sweetberries. He had enough food to last a while, but he was growing impatient withall this waiting.He strolled past the garden patch and saw the five stone figures, exactly wherethey had been since he first arrived here. The broad-chested husband, and hiswife who was not old, but not pretty either. Her petrified hair was tied back,covered with a scarf. A drab skirt hung from hips widened by childbirth. Themother held the hand of one of her children, a boy of about eight. The fathergrabbed the smallest one, a girl no more than five. An older boy of eleven ranbetween them. Their expressions had turned to panic when they realized how muchdanger Maxim posed. They had tried to sneak away into the night, but hadn’tgotten far. Maxim had emerged from the door and saw them running. Withoutbothering to call out, he released his petrification spell. They froze inmidstep, their skin and bones hardening into stone. They would always keep thatexpression of fear, their eyes wide, but they would never take another step. Heregretted his impetuous move, because now they couldn’t help him, couldn’t servehim, and Maxim needed someone to do the work around the cottage.When he first arrived, the family had welcomed him as a traveler, fed him, lethim spend the night, but they became frightened when he forced them to dothings, and he’d been too tired to use much finesse.Now he walked past the statue family, looked at the mother and father, whoseblind, staring eyes didn’t move, didn’t see him. Sarcastically, he wished them agood day, since he had no one else to talk to.He walked along the hilltop, listening to the whisper of tall spruces, until hereached an overlook from which he could see the Killraven River far below. Hestood on a rock promontory, drinking in the view, seeing the noon sun sparkle onthe current. Gant’s Ford filled the bank, the tiny people going about theirdaily business.Then he spotted the ships on the river, a large and imposing fleet of at leastfifty sturdy vessels with lines of long oars, midnight-blue sails, and afearsome carved serpent at each prow. Maxim stared. The Norukai!This was no simple trading fleet, not a ship or two delivering slaves inexchange for bloodwine and yaxen meat. This was a full Norukai invasion. In thepast, the raiders had come to Ildakar pretending to be simple merchants, but nowthat he saw the dangerous fleet pressing upriver, he understood their goal. Thiswasn’t just a raid or two on vulnerable river villages. He smiled as he began toimagine how much havoc those fierce warriors would unleash upon Ildakar.When the Norukai attackers arrived, Maxim had no doubt that the city would fall,if Ildakar wasn’t already destroyed in the aftermath of what he himself haddone. He drove away a twinge of remorse and just watched for the next hour asdozens of serpent warships sailed upriver toward his former home."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 71 [contents.xhtml#c_ch71]Even though Bannon didn’t have the gift, he wanted to help protect Ildakar.After being captured, he was less than enthusiastic about running out to facehordes of enemy soldiers with his sword, but when he learned that Elsa neededphysical labor for her giant plan to unleash transference magic on thebattlefield, he volunteered.Crews gathered at the top of the sheer bluff above the river. The sky held asmear of dull clouds that hung like leftover dragon smoke, carrying a persistentdrizzle. The air was cold, wet, and miserable, which made the cliffstreacherous. When Bannon looked uneasily down at the dangling ropes, the narrowwooden platforms and scaffolding, the workers climbing down with buckets offresh paint, he almost lost his nerve. “Sweet Sea Mother.” But he sucked in adeep breath and nodded to Elsa. “If I can fight a thousand warriors, I am braveenough to paint a cliff.”The older sorceress nodded. “If we succeed here, young man, this gianttransference rune will defeat more enemy soldiers than a thousand Ildakaranswords.”“Then it is worth a bit of vertigo,” he said. Lila had taken him down the narrowstairs, the wooden ledges, and the hanging platforms to the river below. He knewhe could do it. Elsa’s giant rune needed to cover the entire cliff face, anintricate design painted across the open sandstone, with no gaps, no errors.The sorceress peered over the edge, studying the rock surface. “See that sectionover there, near the water sluice? No one is working that part of the cliff. Itwould be a good assignment for you.”It seemed a very long way from any of the stable platforms or stairs. “I willhave to anchor a rope from the top of the cliff here.”“Either that, or you need to fly.” Elsa gave him a quirk of a smile. “Ropes areprobably more reliable.”“Need more paint down here!” called a deep male voice.Below, Bannon saw a potbellied man standing alone on a rickety platform. Hewaved a thick brush so that droplets of red paint spattered his bare shoulders.Two workers from a nearby access tunnel tied a rope to the handle of a fullbucket of paint and lowered it swiftly, hand over hand. The bucket swayed,spilling a little, but the potbellied man reached up and caught it. He set thebucket on the boards at his feet and began painting again.On top, at the cliff’s edge, Bannon tied a harness around himself, assisted byother workers, who secured the knots and double-checked them. Elsa paced theedge of the bluff, watching the crews below.She had crafted her intricate spell-form with numerous curling loops andconnecting cross lines. She had tested the rune until she was sure she hadperfected the design. While the duma members planned the desperate charge outonto the battlefield to complete the other half of her transference spell,according to her plan, Elsa had rallied more than forty volunteers who werewilling to paint the anchor design across the sheer cliff face. IncludingBannon.Most of the painters were cargo loaders and river workers accustomed to movingalong the steep stairs, platforms, and ladders. Standing at the top of thebluff, Elsa had used a different sort of transference magic. In the misty rain,she held the sheet of paper on which she had drawn her intricate rune and usedher gift to magnify and project the image onto the rock, where it remainedclearly visible. Up and down the cliff face, the precariously suspended workerscould see the exact lines to paint.As Bannon roped up, Elsa showed him the spell-form drawn on the damp sheet ofpaper. “If other wizards can lay down smaller boundary runes around the enemyarmy, as well as a central anchor rune, I can link all of them to this muchlarger design painted on the cliffs. Then I can transfer from the bluffs and theKillraven River right out to the middle of the general’s forces.”“Transfer what?” Bannon asked. “Water?”“The river and the stone have something far more destructive than just water.”Her eyes twinkled. “Heat, a great reservoir of heat. I could drain all the heatfrom the river for as much as a mile in either direction, and I can suck theheat from these rocks and dump it all into the middle of the battlefield fromthe anchor point of the connected runes. But first we need to have the primaryspell-form painted large and bold. That’s the important part for now. We need tobe ready in a day or two for the main assault.”Bannon had never understood or attempted magic, but always fought with hissword. Right now, though, he would continue the battle with a paintbrush.“Over the edge with you, young man,” Elsa said once he had all the ropes tiedaround him. “As soon as this is completed, we will hit General Utros again.Their army is in shambles, and after the terrible thing they did to High CaptainStuart…” A stormy expression crossed her face. “We are not inclined to show themmuch mercy.”Bannon checked the rope again. In the drizzle, the thick cord was wet in hishands, but the knots were tight. He backed toward the edge of the sheer drop-offholding a bucket of paint in his right hand. “I will do my part.”“Just paint the lines you see. So long as the projection magic keeps the designin place, the rune is clearly marked. You won’t have any trouble.”The cold mist clung to him like a sheen of sweat. Determined, he lowered himselfover the edge, taking care not to spill the paint. He found small handholds andfootholds in the sandstone, then a narrow carved walkway.After a quick glance at the dizzying drop, he focused on the rock in front ofhim. The rain picked up, but he kept descending toward the obvious mark ofElsa’s giant rune. He was glad Lila wasn’t watching him today. Instead, she wascontinuing to train prospective swordfighters for the charge of separate strikeforces that Elsa’s plan would require.Dangling on the rope, he reached the proper position near the sluice chute whereriver water flowed upward into the aqueducts. The shimmering design hovered onthe rock. Bannon dipped the brush into the bucket and smeared a wide line of redpaint on the sandstone. The paint was thick enough to stick to even the rain-wetrock, and Bannon covered the appropriate spot. He swung like a pendulum, backand forth, to reach more of the design. He dipped the brush into the bucket andslapped red along the projected line.Across the cliff face, he watched his fellow volunteers hanging in theircradles, standing on narrow platforms, gripping rickety rails so they could leanout and paint farther along the lines. Many parts of the grand design werealready coming together.One of the workers leaned too far and slipped on the rain-slick wood. He yelped,and his bucket tumbled over the edge, splashing red paint like blood as it felltoward the river. The man managed to hook his arm around the scaffolding, whilethe rest of his body dangled free. He kicked his legs and flailed his other arm,but no one was close enough to help him. After a few tense seconds, the manlevered himself back onto the scaffold, where he hunched on his hands and knees,panting to recover.From above, Elsa looked down, her face filled with concern. When it was clearthe man was safe, she yelled, “None of the paint got on the cliff. Thespell-form is intact!” She called into the loading tunnels. “Bring that mananother bucket. We need to finish.”Bannon checked the knots on his harness and anchored his foot on a hard lump ofrock for greater stability. He held the wet rope with one hand and brushed morepaint with the other.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That night, knowing that the giant rune would be completely painted within thenext day, Elsa met with Nathan and the leaders of six separate groups ofvolunteers who believed in her plan. She joined them in the torch-lit rulingchamber, making them gather around the stone tables where she drew on a largeunrolled sheet of paper. “Here is how we will use transference magic to hurtGeneral Utros.”Nathan smiled at her in encouragement, admiring the scope of her plan. Withprecise instinctive motions, she described the complex spell-form on the cliffand the unique design of the boundary runes she had developed for this exactpurpose. “This,” she said, tapping the paper. “Burn it into your minds.” It wasa circle with internal loops bounded by a triangle. “With transference magic,each rune, each spell-form, has a certain grammar, a kind of punctuation thatmust be exact. I won’t explain what every curve and line means. Just know thatyou cannot make a mistake.”Oron, Olgya, and three other gifted nobles would lead the satellite teams.Julian was one of Olgya’s primary silk merchants. The second gifted volunteer,Leo, was a short, effeminate man who managed two yaxen slaughterhouses and whohad a remarkable control over his own magic. The third, Perri, was ameek-looking, middle-aged woman. She was a shaper, like Damon, and shemanipulated the vines in the bloodwine vineyards to produce a larger harvest.These five team leaders had all sworn to use their skills to help Elsa’s plan.“You will each be responsible for drawing one of these satellite runes—fiveboundary spell-forms—and they must be exact.” Elsa looked at each gifted leaderto make sure they understood. “Your boundary runes will encircle the zone ofdestruction. Each of your teams will have a fighter escort to lead you to yourrespective positions around the valley. Nathan will accompany me, because wewill face the hardest fighting to place the anchor rune in the center of thecamp.” Her voice cracked. “We will mark the center point to connect the boundaryrunes. This complex of symbols will magnify and draw from the single huge designpainted on the cliffs above the river.”Nathan said to her softly, “I have no doubt you will save us all.”Knowing the risks, the duma had decided not to send out all of their wizards,however. If Elsa’s attempt met with disaster, then no one would remain to defendthe city. Damon and Quentin had offered to stay behind. Nathan also knew that hewould find a way to keep Bannon safe behind the walls. The young man would wantto volunteer to become part of a strike force, and he had certainly proven hismettle on the battlefield, but he had already been captured and nearly killed bythe ancient army. Nicci wasn’t here, and Nathan would see to it that the youngman remained inside the walls. Elsa’s plan had more than enough volunteers, andhe knew he could convince Lila to keep Bannon safe. The morazeth wouldn’t riskhim either.As he thought of the upcoming mission, Nathan forced good cheer, more for Elsa’sbenefit than for anyone else. He looked at the gathered volunteers, the powerfulwizards who believed in her proposal. He brushed his hands together. “When Niccireturns, I will be quite pleased to tell her that we managed to defeat GeneralUtros while she was gone.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 72 [contents.xhtml#c_ch72]Serrimundi sprawled across low hills surrounding a harbor that was crowded withtall sailing ships and fishing boats. Closely built homes lined the slopes thathad been forested at one time. Serrimundi was an ancient city, and all thatremained of the untamed woods were spacious parks. Wide canals guided waterbetween the hills and into the bay. Boatmen poled shallow vessels along thecanals, delivering supplies or ferrying people.From a high point in the hills as Nicci stared across the rolling streets, thedark tile roofs, the whitewashed buildings, she acknowledged that Serrimundi wasindeed a beautiful city. And entirely vulnerable.When she emerged from the sliph, Nicci coughed and sucked in a deep breath. Sherealized that the sliph had not admonished her to “Breathe!” As she regained herbalance, she turned to see the silvery figure staring at her with a hardexpression. Without even acknowledging that she had delivered her passenger, themoody creature dropped back into her well and retreated into the unfathomabledepths.Nicci found herself in the open sunlight on a hill above the harbor. The sliphwell was part of an unoccupied open-air temple with fluted support pillars. Tallurns filled with fresh-cut flowers were arranged across the tiled floor. Aplatter of overripe fruit sat on an altar, an offering to some god or goddessthat had apparently gone unheeded for days. Dry leaves skittered across thefloor, and birds chirped in the vines overhead.Nicci turned to see a statue of a revered woman with long, flowing locks ofhair, like the waves on the sea. Her hands extended as if calling supplicants.Nicci had seen a similar statue before, a giant carving on a cliff at the mouthof Serrimundi Harbor. The Sea Mother.On Chiriya Island, Bannon had been brought up to worship the Sea Mother, and thereligion was common along the coast of the Old World. It was generallycompatible with the prevalent belief in spirits and the underworld, which Nicciknew to be true because of her direct experience with the Keeper. She decidedthis must be an isolated temple to the Sea Mother.Strangely, the goddess bore a striking similarity to the sliph. Nicci wonderedif some gullible observer, thousands of years ago, had seen the quicksilverwoman emerge from the well, delivering travelers who secretly served EmperorSulachan. Could that have been the inspiration for the Sea Mother’s appearanceand the huge statue on the cliff?Though empty, the temple was obviously still used. Supplicants to the Sea Mothergenerally made their sacrifices in the open ocean, but if the original sliphwell was up here, someone would have built a temple to mark that spot. Gardensspread out beyond the temple, and stone footpaths wound in haphazard directions,as if supplicants were expected to walk a contemplative path before they arrivedat the altar.Nicci heard voices and saw figures passing among tall hedges, approaching theopen temple. Since she didn’t want to explain where she had come from, shedeparted down a different path, making her way toward the residential buildingscloser to the harbor.She reached the crowded streets where women sat outside sewing garments and mentoiled at craft benches. Some of the people acknowledged her as she walked past.The inhabitants of Serrimundi were not suspicious, not even curious about thestranger. Nicci’s black dress was different from the style of their own clothes,but she realized that the bustling harbor city must see many foreigners.She had been here once before, when she and Nathan sailed south from Tanimuraaboard the Wavewalker. Back then, they were simply traveling the Old World asemissaries for the D’Haran Empire. Nicci had briefly met the harborlord, a mannamed Otto, when Captain Eli Corwin took on more supplies. She decided to startwith the harborlord and deliver her warning.She walked along one of the canals until a boatman drifted by and offered her aride. Nicci didn’t mind walking, but she was in a hurry, and so she accepted. Asshe balanced on the boat while the man poled them along, she scanned the hills,buildings, commercial districts, orchards. Serrimundi was open, thriving. Theywould be entirely unprepared if General Utros’s invading army crashed into thecity.Serrimundi had been mostly unscathed by the Imperial Order, and now she couldsee they were too complacent. She would have to change their mind-set.Eventually, she reached the offices of the harborlord, near the water’s edge.Clerks inside the harborlord’s office kept detailed ledgers of all ships thatentered Serrimundi Harbor, along with notations of their captains, their primarycargo, and their ports of origin. Three older men with nearly identical fringesof short white hair around their bald skulls sat squinting over their books.One of the men glanced up at Nicci, squinted as if she were more difficult tosee than the notations in his leather-bound ledger. “Harborlord Otto isn’t here,miss. He went down to meet a ship. His daughter’s just been betrothed to CaptainGanley.”“Which ship?” Nicci asked. “I will find him on the docks.”“The Mist Maiden,” said one of the other men. “He should be there.”Nicci set off along the harbor’s edge, carrying the cloth-wrapped rectangle ofglass that showed the vast ancient army. She passed a foul-smelling krakener,whose hull was permeated with the slime of the tentacled sea creatures theyhunted. One ship had just pushed off from its dock and drifted away from thecrowded piers, heading toward the mouth of the harbor, where waves crashedagainst a rock outcropping that stood like a sentinel. A towering female figurehad been carved there, a woman bursting from the raw rock, the Sea Mother.Again, Nicci recognized the familiar features of the sliph.The Mist Maiden was a three-masted cargo ship, even larger than the Wavewalker.Its sails were tied up, and thick hawsers lashed the hull against the largestpier in the harbor. The ship’s crew had already disembarked except for a handfulof men still lounging aboard on the open deck. Large crates of cargo had beenstacked while workers and carters hauled the goods away. Merchants squabbledover the division of the shipment.Nicci recognized Harborlord Otto as he strolled down the gangplank of the MistMaiden. He walked with a spring in his step, adjusting his floppy leather hatthat she remembered from before. On the deck of the Mist Maiden, she saw a youngwoman talking to the bearded captain and guessed it might be Otto’s daughter,Shira. The young woman had lost her husband, Captain Corwin, when the Wavewalkerwas wrecked by the selka. Soon, Shira would be marrying a new husband, CaptainGanley.The harborlord was hearty, good-humored, and well respected in Serrimundi. IfNicci could enlist Otto as an ally, he would help spread the warning and preparethe city’s defenses.She called out in a brisk, businesslike voice. “Harborlord, I need to speak withyou.”He turned his caramel-colored eyes to her. “How may I help you?”“You can help me spread a warning throughout Serrimundi.”He frowned. “A warning about what?”“An enemy army, a huge force of ancient soldiers that may eventually moveagainst the Old World. They are far away, laying siege to Ildakar, butSerrimundi must be prepared. Luckily, there is time, if you act.”Harborlord Otto seemed more puzzled than alarmed by the suggestion. “An enemyarmy? Do you mean the Imperial Order? We heard that Emperor Jagang is dead andhis entire force defeated. What is there to worry about?”“Yes, Jagang is dead.” Nicci didn’t point out that she herself had killed him.“This is another army, one that served Iron Fang fifteen centuries ago. Theywere under a spell, but now they are reawakened.”Otto chuckled. “I’ve heard sailors tell many stories about sea monsters, selka,and krakens. You are having a joke on me.”Nicci unwrapped the glass and showed him the image of Utros’s army. “It is true.The legendary city of Ildakar is besieged, and regardless of whether theysurvive or fall, General Utros is likely to continue his conquest. He willeventually come to the coast and Serrimundi. You need to build up yourdefenses.”Otto chuckled again. “But Ildakar is on the other side of the world, if it evenexists! No one has heard of it in centuries.”“Ildakar exists, and is not as far away as you might think. The D’Haran Empirehas been alerted, and Lord Rahl’s soldiers will be moving south from theTanimura garrison. Serrimundi needs to help as well.”The harborlord scoffed. “We don’t fear any invasion. We survived the ImperialOrder, miss.” He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the glass. “How did you getthis image?” He tapped the pane with his fingernail as if expecting the figuresto dissolve. “Did you come by ship? Which vessel were you aboard?”“I am a sorceress, and I came by other means,” she said. “You and I met brieflysome months ago, when I arrived aboard the Wavewalker. Afterward I sent amessage by courier that the ship had been sunk by selka.”He hung his head, suddenly serious now. “Yes, we received that news. It wastragic.” Otto struggled to recall a name. “You are … Nicci?”“Yes.” She held up the glass again. “And you need to listen to me about thisarmy. General Utros has a force as great as the Imperial Order. Sooner or lateryou will be under attack.”He frowned as he struggled to recall a conversation. “Now that you mention it, Iheard secondhand from a fishing boat that came in this morning, something aboutone or two coastal villages being destroyed, Effren and one other. But I have nofurther proof, and I don’t think we should overreact until the news has beenverified. Is that what you mean? Is this enemy army attacking the coast?” Hepointed toward her pane of glass.“No. General Utros is far inland, but he will be moving. I promise you, this isa threat. You must prepare.” She could see that her words were not gettingthrough to him.He nodded distractedly. “Thank you, I will make note of it, but Serrimundi hasno standing army. Our harbor is busy, as you can see. Our population is healthyand prosperous. Everyone trades with us. We are not on a war footing.”“That’s why I came to warn you.” Even though Elsa’s preserved images proved whatNicci said, the sheer distance from Ildakar to Serrimundi made the threat seem asmall one, but Utros had already dispatched large portions of his army. If thoseforces continued marching, needing no supplies of food or water, they couldcross the continent more swiftly than anyone expected. “You don’t comprehend thedanger, Harborlord. This is not an army to be ignored.”Otto paused to consider the glass again. “The Sea Mother will protect Serrimundias she always has. We need not fear an attack.”Growing frustrated, Nicci wrapped the cloth over the glass, covering the image.“Remember that I warned you.”As if he didn’t give her a second thought, Otto adjusted his leather hat andstrolled down the dock, still smiling. From the deck of the Mist Maiden, hisdaughter waved and wrapped her arm around the other captain, her fiancé.Hoping she would have better luck if she spread the word around the harbor,Nicci made her way along the piers where sailors lounged about, waiting neartheir ships. Some whittled scraps of wood or kraken-horn ivory. Three deeplytanned and unshaven sailors passed around a bottle of wine. She showed manyothers her pane of glass, talking to merchant captains, kraken hunters,fishermen. To little use.She came upon four shirtless, arrogant young men who lounged on a pile ofsailcloth as if someone had placed it there for their bed. By the strings oftattoos across their chests, she recognized them to be wishpearl divers. Thesimilar divers she had met aboard the Wavewalker were unpleasant, self-importantmen who refused to do work aboard the ship. They had poisoned her, diminishedher powers, tried to rape her. They hadn’t succeeded. When the selka killed allof them, Nicci had not grieved.She regarded the divers with a scowl as they roused themselves, curious abouther attention. She asked, “If Serrimundi were under attack from an enemy force,would you lift a hand to defend it? Or are you as worthless as the otherwishpearl divers I’ve met?”Angrily, the four shirtless men climbed to their feet and sneered at her. Oneman said, “I might lift a finger if you came to my bed.”“Then I might lift a finger to crush all of your bones into little pieces,” shesaid. “Mark my words, the threat is coming, an army that could destroy thiscity.”“What army?” asked one of the other divers. “We’ve heard of no army.”“I am telling you so you can prepare, if you know how to fight.”“We know how to swim,” said one of the divers, chuckling.None of them took her seriously. She showed them Elsa’s image on the glass,which they found interesting, but unconvincing. “That is an army in themountains. We have no mountains here.”“Armies can cross mountains,” Nicci said. “They are on the move.”“If they are far away, then I’m not worried yet,” said one diver.“I don’t even believe there is an army,” said another, squinting closer at thepreserved pane. “It’s just a trick. There is magic in that glass. She could beshowing us anything.”“Heh, I know something I’d like her to show me,” said the lecherous diver.Nicci was of a mind to burst his testicles right there, which would certainlygain his attention, but she hadn’t expected to earn any support from wishpearldivers in the first place, and they didn’t disappoint her. After a long day shehad hoped to rouse the people of Serrimundi, though she knew it would be a moredifficult task than convincing General Linden and the D’Haran garrison. Thesepeople did not know her. Not yet.As the wishpearl divers laughed, mocking her story about the great army, sheheard shouts raised across the harbor. A lookout on the Mist Maiden’s tall mastwas casting dried bread to screaming gulls, but he suddenly dropped his basketand began hollering at the top of his lungs. Around the harbor, other shipspicked up the alarm. Loud ship’s bells rang.Beyond the rocky promontory at the mouth of the harbor, Nicci saw smoke in thesky. A ship was sailing into the harbor, engulfed in flames. It bobbed and yawedwithout guidance, its sails ablaze, a krakener riding low in the water. She sawseveral sailors dive overboard. Two of them were caught in the current and sweptup against the outcropping beneath the carving of the Sea Mother. The burningship continued to drift into the crowded harbor.“Ship on fire, ship on fire!” The outcries spread among the vessels. Thekrakener listed to one side as the flames grew more intense. Harbor workersscrambled about, afraid that the fire would spread to other vessels. Severalfishing boats rapidly set sail away from the docks to get clear. The krakenertook on water as it began to sink near the mouth of the harbor.Nicci shaded her eyes, wondering what could have set the ship ablaze. It waslike a warning torch thrown at the city of Serrimundi. Soon enough, she had heranswer. They all did.With midnight-blue sails fully stretched and line after line of oars extended, aNorukai serpent ship cruised around the promontory, coming in from the sea andentering Serrimundi Harbor, following the krakener they had set ablaze.Behind the first Norukai serpent ship came another, and another, a line of tenraiders. Frantic shouts roared among the dockworkers, and the harbor bellsclanged. Nicci had never seen so many Norukai ships, and they were coming toinvade Serrimundi.This was not the army she had warned them about, but it was a threat just asdeadly."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 73 [contents.xhtml#c_ch73]The mists on the wide river did not obscure the cold, miserable morning. Rainfell gently on the decks of the Norukai ships, and King Grieve stood in the openin his sharkskin vest, his massive bare arms slick from the rain. He staredahead as if he could penetrate the fog with the power of his gaze, but he sawonly the gray shadows of tangled trees on the nearer shore.The treacherous swamps had gone on for miles as the Norukai fleet sailedupriver. The opposite shore was lost in the gloom and rain. In places, theKillraven River was so wide it seemed like the sea. Grieve didn’t like closebanks and narrow shores, which made him feel confined.Water lapped against the hull of his serpent ship, and the dark sails stretched,pushed along by the directed breeze. Grieve wanted to increase their pace, soNorukai crewmen extended their oars and drove the fleet onward, like a slowsword thrust against the current.The fog muffled all sound. Drummers on each foredeck pounded out a steady rowingbeat as the ominous vessels moved along. The rhythmic pounding would strike fearinto any weak villagers huddled on the banks watching the ships pass.A large trout leaped up, startled by the passage of such immense vessels. Chalkpranced over, gripping the rail and lurching himself up on spindly arms. Hepeered over the edge, squirming, watching the ripples in the brown current.Grieve grabbed his bony shoulder and pulled him back so he wouldn’t falloverboard.“A fish, my Grieve, King Grieve! A king fish!” He grinned with lopsided lips onhis pocked face. “Ildakar is a fish. We will catch it and gut it, and roast itover a fire.”“Yes, we will catch it and gut it,” Grieve said, “but we can’t destroy it,because it is mine. It will be the capital of my new empire.”“They’ll all grieve!” Chalk looked over the railing again, searching for morefish.Another trout leaped, and the pale shaman grinned, but a different form cruisedthrough the water, unseen. A swamp dragon lunged, and its jaws snatched thetrout. Holding the fish in its teeth, the reptile submerged and swam away withbarely a ripple.The drumbeats continued, the long oars stroked, and the Norukai ships moved upthe river.Mounted on a spike at the prow was the hideous head of the selka. The slimycreature had sagged, the rubbery skin falling slack along its cheekbones andjaws. The yellow eyes had turned to jelly, and the crew had repeatedly chasedaway ravens that tried to peck at the delicacy. The sea creatures would notbother them now that the Norukai ships were far up the Killraven River.Out in the ocean, the angry selka had followed the fleet, threatening, butunable to attack. The Norukai raiders had jeered and taunted them, throwingharpoons on ropes, trying to stab the outlying creatures, but missed. The selkafollowed them all the way to the estuary, raising their ugly heads above thewater, hissing unintelligible curses. The Norukai responded by emptying thefoul-smelling bilges into the water behind the ships.The rain had started on their third day moving upriver. The Norukai ships sailedpast villages on the banks, small fishing and trading towns. Previously, Norukaislavers might stop and raid the weaker villages just to replace any walking meatthat died during the voyage.This time, the fifty serpent ships were on a military conquest, not a mere raid,but Grieve’s fighters were restless. He allowed a few vessels to pull ashore andlet the fighters slosh to the banks, where they could kill townspeople, sethomes on fire, rape women, and leave a mark of terror. If King Grieve was goingto wrap the entire continent in his iron fist, he needed the people to fear him.But he wanted to get to Ildakar.Shivering, Chalk wrapped his scrawny arms around his bony chest. “Fire. I wishwe had fire. So cold.”“I gave you a blanket,” Grieve said. “Wrap yourself in it.”“Fire. I want a fire. Like the big hearth in the Bastion.”“We can’t have a big fire on a ship. Use the blanket.”Chalk hunched down, and his teeth chattered loudly enough to be heard over thedrumbeat the rowers used to keep time with their oars. “Cold. Ice. Snow.”Grieve felt sorry for his eccentric and stubborn friend. Chalk always seemed tobe chilled, even on the main island. The shaman spent half his days near theroaring fire, but he chose to wear no more than a loincloth. He didn’t want tohide the countless bite marks that covered his skin, but he looked so miserablenow.“You will have your fire in Ildakar,” Grieve said. “We can burn part of the cityand that will keep you warm enough.” When Chalk didn’t answer, he nudged theshaman. “At least get out of the rain. Take shelter in the back cabin orbelowdecks.”“Snow and ice,” Chalk moaned. “Everything so cold. The river frozen!”“It’s just rain. Soon the sun will come out.”Forgetting his physical discomfort, Chalk sprang to his feet again. “The sunwill come out, my Grieve! Yes, late in the morning, and we will see Ildakar! Ourfish, King Grieve. They’ll all grieve.”“They’ll all grieve.” He recognized the cockeyed intensity in Chalk’sexpression. “Is that a dream?”“Yes, Ildakar. We are almost there, but the cold and ice…” Chalk shook his headand huddled around himself again, shivering. “And snow!”“You don’t even know snow,” Grieve said. “You have never seen it.”“Cold!” Chalk insisted.The drums pounded, and the oars sloshed in perfect coordination. The serpentships glided past the swamps. Grieve had listened to Captain Kor’s report of theprevious expedition to Ildakar, and he knew they were nearly at theirdestination.An hour later, the rain slackened and the mists grew more diffuse as weak yellowlight burned through the river fog. Grieve hunched over the prow, sick ofwaiting, and stared into the brightening light. Chalk relished the faintsunshine.Finally, around midmorning, exactly as the shaman had predicted, the sun brokethrough, so the Norukai king could look ahead. He saw the sandstone cliffs, theuplift the ancient wizards had created. At last he saw with his own eyes theancient city of Ildakar towering above the river, its white buildings and talltowers shining in the distance. The city alone was larger than the main Norukaiisland. Grieve’s fifty ships would be enough to conquer it, though. Of that hehad no doubt.Chalk jabbed a bony finger at the sight. “They’ll all grieve. Our fish! They’llall grieve.”The Norukai king touched the soft smelly head of the decomposing selka. Hesqueezed the oozing flesh of its cheeks and turned the creature so its runny eyesockets pointed toward the vulnerable city. “There,” he said, in a low voice, “Iwant you to see our next victory.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 74 [contents.xhtml#c_ch74]The expedition from Cliffwall pushed through the mountains, where the air wasthinner and the cold air blew harder. Verna looked behind them, imagining thedesert canyons they had left far behind, then turned in the direction ofIldakar. That was their destination, and she couldn’t wait to see all thewonders Renn had promised. By now, the road was more apparent, recently trampledby the large, half-stone expeditionary force that had marched away from thelegendary city.On his warhorse, General Zimmer led the group. Oliver and Peretta made notes oftheir travels and exchanged stories with young Amber. The other scholars lookedsore and dirty, tired of the long journey. None of them had ever left theirisolated canyon before.Within days, the terrain transitioned to forested foothills, winding down to awatershed where streams provided all the drinking and bathing water they needed.They toiled up the next ridge, reaching the rounded top only to see anotherridge ahead of them.Verna began to lose hope that they would ever find their destination, but Renngrew excited as they climbed the next line of hills. “This is it, I think. Theplains of Ildakar are just ahead.” He inhaled deeply, as if the air smelleddifferent to him. “It will be so good to be home.”Verna would be glad to see Nicci and Nathan again, to talk with them, and shewould trust their assessment about Ildakar.“I smell smoke,” Oliver said as they worked their way through the trees. Adrizzle had continued throughout the morning, and Verna was wet. Her gray-brownhair hung limply against her skull, and she tried not to look as miserable asshe felt.“How can you smell anything in this?” Peretta asked.“I have always had a keen sense of smell.”General Zimmer and the scouts crested the ridge and rode out of the sparserpines. Ahead, they saw grass-covered hills and a broad open valley. Renn pushedforward to get a better view. “It’s Ildakar. That is the plain. That’s—”Zimmer raised a hand, commanding them to stay within the shelter of the trees.“We don’t want to be seen.”Verna, Amber, Peretta, and Oliver crowded forward. Renn stood with his arms athis side, his mouth open. “By the Keeper’s beard!”The grassy hills to the north of the great valley were scorched black. Out onthe plain Verna saw a huge army, thousands upon thousands camped in rows with afew tents dispersed among the troops. The soldiers were moving, marching,forming precise groups, a military force vastly greater than the invasion armythey had buried under the avalanche.“That looks as big as the entire population of Tanimura,” Amber said in atrembling voice.Verna looked beyond the countless warriors. Ildakar rose up like a beautifulisland covered with tiers of buildings, layers of neighborhoods piled up to thesummit of the plateau. It was indeed a magnificent city, and it was under siege.Tears leaked down Renn’s cheeks. “General Utros is awake. Look what they havedone to Ildakar!” He shaded his eyes, scanning the high, protected upwelling ofthe city. “I can barely make out the top of the plateau in this drizzle. I seethe ruling tower, but I can’t find the pyramid. It seems to be gone.”Peretta narrowed her dark eyes. “I see a pyramid, but it is broken. What did itlook like before?”“Something happened in my city,” Renn said. “Something terrible. We’ve got tohelp. We need to fight for Ildakar.”The seven other Sisters of the Light gathered, waiting for the prelate to issueorders, but Verna wasn’t sure she had anything to offer. “We have several giftedwith us. My Sisters and I can use some magic. You, Renn, are also a wizard, butthis won’t be like creating the avalanche. Look at the size of that army.”“I have only a handful of soldiers,” said Zimmer. “What can we possibly doagainst an enemy force like that?”Renn groaned. “Ildakar is full of gifted men and women at least as powerful as Iam. We have to figure out how to sneak through the walls, so I can rejoin theduma. They will need my help.”As Verna looked at the entrenched army that stood between them and the city, shehad no answer for him."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 75 [contents.xhtml#c_ch75]Elsa’s transference magic was ready, after several days of work. The hugepainted rune covered the sheer side of the bluff above the river, and they wereready for their risky foray out to the encamped enemy army. “I cannot imagine orplan a greater release of energy,” she said. “After the dragon and the Ixaxwarriors, this might be the final blow that breaks them.”“If we all do our parts,” Nathan said.He saw tension on her face. Drawn lines chiseled her fine features, and thecrow’s-feet had deepened around her eyes. He’d always admired her as a brave,determined, and talented woman. The transference magic she had developed duringcenturies of isolation in Ildakar was impressive, and he had helped her createthis marvelous and risky counterstrike. Elsa didn’t seem anxious or doubtful,but dread wrapped around her like a burial shroud.“It will succeed, my dear, and I will do everything I can to help you. Over thepast two days we gathered a powerful force and they are well trained and wellmotivated to protect the six strike forces. We have to be swift and focused.They all know what to do to help you, and they all know what is at stake.” Hesmiled. “We’re ready to move.”Elsa reached out to squeeze his hand. “Truly, it would not have been the samewithout you, Nathan. I’m glad you will be by my side for this.”“Be brave. Dear spirits, we will do what we need to do.” He stroked his chin andfrowned. “Are you certain you don’t want to wait for Nicci to return? Thesorceress is more powerful than any of us.”“No,” Elsa said abruptly. “We don’t know when she might come back, and we areready. The rune is painted. The six teams are armed and trained.” Shestraightened, but still seemed edgy. “It has to be now. I’ve made up my mind.”Nathan squeezed her hand in response. “I understand. We can be just asimpressive without Nicci.”Today, Bannon and Lila were preoccupied on the bluff, adding finishing touchesto the enormous transference rune, though the giant design had been completedthe night before. Nathan had sent Bannon, tasking him with guaranteeing thatevery detail was correct. That would keep the young man away from theirdesperate charge, though he would not like it. It was very possible the fightersand protectors would not survive the desperate ride, and Nathan knew this lastbattle against Utros would be decided by magic. More than enough fighters wouldguard the separate gifted parties assigned to scribe the proper boundary runes.Under gray skies, he and Elsa hurried along the wet streets toward the long wallwhere the separate strike forces were gathering. The horses were saddled, thefighters wearing their armor and holding swords and iron-tipped clubs. It wouldbe another surprise operation, but unlike the first testing foray, this one hada clear goal. Elsa’s transference magic would do the bulk of the work, providedthat the gifted designates completed their runes on the battlefield.Nathan whispered close to Elsa’s face. “I trust your abilities implicitly.”The largest concentration of fighters had gathered here at the main gates toaccompany Nathan and Elsa on their charge to the heart of the camp to lay downthe central rune, but five other teams, led by Oron, Olgya, Justin, Perri, andLeo, had been dispatched to secondary gates up and down the wall. They would allrush out at the same time, each with a very specific destination and assignment.Olgya had presented each of them with a new cloak made of the impenetrable armorsilk to serve as both protection and camouflage. The worms in her warehouse hadspun themselves into exhaustion, but they had produced countless bolts of thespecial cloth. All of the escort fighters were likewise protected.Nathan and Elsa wrapped their silk cloaks around themselves, sashed tightly attheir waists. Nathan had his ornate sword at his side, with his black pants andtraveling boots. He felt like an adventurer and a wizard, as well as Elsa’sprotector.The ranks of the city guard, infuriated by the brutal execution of High CaptainStuart, had supplied many of the volunteers for the escorts. “For Stuart!” theguards called, raising their swords.Each of the teams also had two morazeth warriors. The women had sworn theirlives to protect the gifted team leaders while they marked the spell-forms.“We have to be fast,” Nathan called out. “Our purpose is not to engage the enemyand fight. Each team must get to its position and lay down the boundary runes.”He smiled. “Then Elsa will do the rest.”The older sorceress sat silent and preoccupied on her chestnut gelding, whichshe had agreed to ride because they required speed. Nathan sat astride a sturdygray horse close to her. The escort fighters gathered around their respectiveteams at the different gates, hard-bitten arena veterans as well as uniformedcity guard. Not long ago, these groups had been bitter enemies. Now they wouldall go out to fight together.“So much has changed,” Nathan muttered to Elsa. “Amazing how facing a commonenemy can form fast friendships.”She looked over at him, her face filled with emotion. Tears sparkled in hereyes. “Thank you for being my friend, Nathan. I am glad you came to Ildakar, andI am glad I got to know you. You’re the first man since Derek who has trulywarmed my heart.”“I hope I continue to do so, my dear. But now it is time. We should be off!”Elsa nodded, biting her lower lip.Nathan saw the freed slave Rendell among the fighters, a man who had servedMirrormask and then become the first member of the lower classes to have a seaton the duma. Rendell raised an iron club in salute to Nathan. “I am fighting aswell, Wizard. I may not have magic, but I have a sword arm and my anger is asgreat as anyone else’s.”“We will celebrate together afterward,” Nathan said.They had decided not to blow defiant war horns, but would simply ride outunexpectedly into the morning rain under the gray skies. Even a few minutes ofsurprise might make a great difference.The main gates began to open, and the tense guardian soldiers pressed closeraround Nathan and Elsa. They all held their swords ready to charge.Elsa carried a large bladder of bright red paint, identical to the pigment usedto mark the giant rune on the cliff wall. When it came time, she would snip thecorner and draw a spattering line across the ground to outline her anchor rune.Oron, Olgya, and the other three gifted nobles had similar sacks of paint todraw boundary runes in the proper places. After they all sent up a signal toindicate they had completed their work, Elsa would connect the boundary runeswith the anchor rune, and transfer all the heat stored in the cliffs and theriver right into the midst of the ancient army.Nathan gave Elsa a confident smile as gates opened up and down the main wall ofIldakar. “We are off, my dear! Let us go see what victory feels like.”He kicked his gray horse, which galloped ahead with Elsa racing beside him. Therest of the escort fighters charged, ready to battle to the death for thisdesperate plan. Nathan was already calling lightning with one hand, whilesummoning wizard’s fire in the other. He planned to make quite an impact.“For Ildakar!” he cried. The words echoed from countless other throats."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 76 [contents.xhtml#c_ch76]All the flatboat pilots, fishermen, and river traders had been warned away fromIldakar as soon as the giant transference rune was painted on the bluffside.When Elsa activated the towering spell-form, the backlash would be dangerous foranyone in the vicinity.Lila stood with Bannon at the edge of one of the tunnel openings, peering downthe network of ramps, stairs, and cargo platforms to the river below.Considering the huge painted design, the morazeth frowned. “I should not haveallowed you to hang from a rope while you painted. It was a risk, and I promisedto keep you safe.”“There are different ways of fighting the enemy.” Bannon gestured with pride atthe prominent design, which stood out bright and red on the cliffs. “And Ineeded to help.”She scoffed. “You could have fallen.”“I’m not clumsy.” He was exasperated with her attitude. “Neither of us needsprotection here. The battle is on the opposite side of the city, and I amworried about the strike teams, and Nathan. By now they should be ready to rideout to place the boundary runes on the battlefield, and that is far moredangerous than anything I’ve done here.” He looked behind him into the tunnelsand the city beyond. “Nathan tricked me. I wish he had let me go along withhim.”“Your wizard friend wanted to protect you, and he gave me instructions to do thesame. I intend to obey them,” Lila said. “My morazeth sisters are out there withthe teams. Therefore, the mission will succeed.”Bannon touched Sturdy, which he kept comfortably at his side. “What if they failbecause one more fighter would have saved a wizard or a sorceress at a criticaltime? What if Nathan needs me?”“I don’t dispute your concerns,” Lila finally said, sounding wistful. “I wouldhave liked to go along as well.”Doing a final check, four painters on separate scaffoldings touched up sectionsof the design that had washed thin in the rain overnight. “Hurry!” Bannon calledto them. “The attack will launch any minute now. When Elsa triggers hertransference magic, you don’t want to be out here.”The cocky young painters swung on the ropes, with no fear of heights. Theycompleted their work, called to one another, then lowered themselves to thewooden platforms. After securing their half-empty buckets of paint, they duckedinto the entry tunnels. Rainwater trickled out of small drain outlets fromgutters in the streets, streaming down the cliff to the river.Bannon felt a strange premonition when he saw the water running out of the drainholes. It looked as if Ildakar were weeping rivulets of water, like tearspouring through the painted spell-form and down the cliff.He thought of the enormous statue of the Sea Mother that towered over SerrimundiHarbor and remembered that he’d felt a similar strange dread when the Wavewalkersailed past. Bannon wondered if that had been an early warning about the selkaattack that had destroyed the ship not long afterward. Nathan and Nicci had toldhim time and again that prophecy was gone, that Lord Rahl had changed theunderpinnings of magic. The young man didn’t think he possessed some previouslyundiscovered gift that let him glimpse the future. He decided the shiver musthave been caused by the damp chill in the air.Lila stood practically naked with only the thin leather wrap around her waistand chest, sandals laced all the way up her calves. Moisture glistened on herskin, highlighting the rune markings. “Aren’t you cold?” he asked.“No. Never.”From the tunnel overhang, Bannon and Lila watched the fog lifting off the riveras the day brightened. He heard the whisper of the sluggish current, the stir ofturgid swamps; then in the distance he heard an eerie, muffled thumping, like asteady heartbeat.Alert, Lila leaned out over the edge. “Those are drums. Many drums.” The sunbroke through, warming the air, dissipating the mists as the approaching drumsgrew louder. “Something is coming.”Straining to see through the thinning fog, Bannon felt an ominous change in theair. Unconsciously, he moved closer to Lila.Together, they watched in horror as a shape appeared on the wide river below,dark sails, a frightening sea serpent head carved at the prow. The ship glidedforward as the drums continued their steady threatening beat, oars raised andlowered, pushing the vessel against the current.Bannon remembered the Norukai slave traders who had come to Ildakar to selltheir cargo of walking meat, and he felt angry.Behind the lead ship came another, then another—dozens of vessels, with evenmore trailing off in the remaining fog. Ice spiked through his veins as herealized this was no small merchant expedition. “Sweet Sea Mother, those aren’tNorukai traders. This is an invasion!”Bannon’s hatred for the Norukai remained unbounded. He had slain many in a bloodrage at Renda Bay, and he had loathed them when they came to trade in Ildakar.When he’d foolishly challenged three Norukai near the yaxen pens, he wasbattered and thrown into the training pits.The drums pounded louder, and the serpent ships drifted close to the docks atthe base of the cliff. Bannon could hear the shouts of challenge from hundreds,thousands, of Norukai as they closed in on the city.He grabbed Lila’s arm. “We have to raise the alarm, jettison the docks below,and guard these tunnels. Ildakar is under attack!”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After Elsa and the five other strike teams rode out on their mission into thehuge army camp, Damon and Quentin remained in the ruling tower. The two wizardsmade plans, afraid they might have to launch their final solution after all.They had to be ready. Although Nicci had traveled through the sliph to spreadher dire warning across the Old World, Damon knew she would never bringreinforcements here. Ildakar had to save itself.After discussing with Sovrena Thora the possibility of restoring the shroud, thetwo wizards had proceeded to lay the groundwork without consulting the rest ofthe duma. As a shaper, Damon had worked with metals, fusing and forming a newcrucible, mirrors, and guidance channels exactly like the ones used on thestair-stepped pyramid. While the other wizards of Ildakar were preoccupied withtheir own desperate plans, he and Quentin were pragmatic about what would trulysave Ildakar. They knew their scheme would work, even if everything else failed.Elsa’s dramatic plan with transference magic would cause tremendous harm, if itsucceeded, but the risk was high. And even if it worked, the destruction mightnot be sufficient. Again.He and Quentin were realists.Suddenly, Bannon burst into the ruling tower, flushed and breathless. “It’s theNorukai! Dozens of serpent ships, thousands of warriors. We have to mount adefense on the cliff.”Lila ran beside him. “The boy is correct. The Norukai are not here to trade.They’ve come to conquer. We are under attack.”Turning pale, Damon looked at his companion. Both wizards knew that this was whythey had remained behind, while Elsa and the others rode out to place theboundary runes.Quentin pressed a hand to his chest as if in a sudden bout of indigestion. “Ialways found the Norukai disgusting.”“You should never have traded with them in the first place,” Bannon growled.“They are monsters, and they mean to kill us all. Their warriors will storm usfrom the river. We’ve got to stop them. We need you and your wizard’s fire. Weneed to activate the traps that were built into the cliffs—and we need themnow.” As thoughts circled and tangled in Damon’s mind, Bannon snapped at hishesitation, “Sweet Sea Mother, can’t you hear me? There are thousands of them!They will attack the city.”“Sound the alarms,” Quentin ordered.Damon wiped perspiration from his brow. “Call the city. We need every remainingfighter to drive back the Norukai.”But he had another thought. Was this not proof that they needed to raise theshroud and isolate the city? It was the only way to be certain. When the alarmbells rang through the streets, he thought they sounded like the call to the oldbloodworkings at the pyramid.Lila took Bannon’s arm, and they sprinted back to the bluff so they could fight.Remaining behind, Damon looked at Quentin and saw the same realization in hisfriend’s wide brown eyes. “Even if Elsa’s plan works, General Utros willretaliate. He will stop at nothing to break down our walls.” He shook his head.“And now the Norukai are swarming to our cliffs. If they get inside, the citywill fall—unless we do what we must. You know we have no choice, Quentin.”His companion nodded. “We will send out the call and summon the volunteers tothe arena, and the city guard can round up as many more as we need. Gifted bloodis strongest, so if they can find a few useless nobles, that would be evenbetter. This is no time for delicacy. We have to start immediately. Shedding somuch blood might take more time than we have left.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 77 [contents.xhtml#c_ch77]Prelate Verna and her companions stared in disbelief at the vast army encampedin front of Ildakar. Renn groaned, “A handful of us can’t do anything againstthat.” He hid behind a tree and seemed to be holding himself back. “I looked outupon that stone army for so many centuries, but I never expected them to be athreat again.”“Our avalanche took care of thousands of them,” Zimmer said. “But from what Isee down there, I doubt General Utros would even notice the loss of thatexpeditionary force.”Scanning the ancient army, the burn scars on the hills, the damage done to theplain, Verna tried to imagine what had happened here. “The city fought hardagainst them, that’s for certain. And it looks like they have had some success.”Captain Trevor looked pale and distraught. “We need to get inside Ildakar andfind out what’s happened.”General Zimmer heaved a great breath. “I know you want to make your way back tothe city, but unless you can find a way for us to fly, wizard, we will not getthrough that army. Is your gift that strong?”Renn scratched the beard stubble on his cheeks. “No.”The gray drizzle and the clouds overhead muted the details, though the sunstruggled to come out. As they watched, Verna saw the distant gates of Ildakaropen, and six separate groups of fighters, like individual strike forces, rodeoutward in a brash and foolish sortie. “Look, they’re launching an attack.”“Such small strike forces! Are those all the defenses Ildakar has left?” Rennsaid in disbelief. “They will be like tiny darts against a bull yaxen.”They all watched the small parties race recklessly away from the walls. The sixparties galloped in separate directions, heading toward different points.Reacting to this unexpected and unimpressive incursion, the large ancient armybegan to stir. At the lead of each Ildakaran strike force rode a gifted fighterwho called up roaring winds and flashes of lightning, using magic to sweep asidethe defensive lines. The six parties rode at full speed, intent on some cleargoal.“That cannot be a full-scale attack,” Zimmer said, crossing his arms over hischest. “Most of the groups are skirting the edge of the big camp, riding theperimeter. Are they trying to get away? It makes no sense.”“Yes, it does,” Verna said, pointing. “Each of those groups has a specifictarget. They know where they’re going.”The six teams galloped at breakneck speed, flailing with swords and magic,clearing away the half-petrified soldiers who closed in to stop them. Vernacould tell they were avoiding direct engagement for the sake of speed. Two ofthe groups rode to the boundary hills along the southern edge of the valley, andtwo other teams went north, riding along the edge of the blackened grass.Another strike force circled around and cut through the sparsest part of thecamp toward the far end of the valley, where Verna and the others lay hidden.The gifted leader of that group formed a wedge of air, like a plow through thedefending soldiers.The last of the six teams headed straight into the heart of Utros’s army,cutting their way into the thick of the soldiers.Fierce lightning lanced out from all the groups, striking clustered enemysoldiers, blasting divots in the ground. Verna struggled to understand what theyhoped to accomplish.Oliver and Peretta stood together, staring, and Novice Amber said, “Can’t we dosomething to help? They don’t even know we’re here.”Oliver gave a determined nod. “When we called down the avalanche, we all workedtogether, and look what we achieved.” He looked behind him at the giftedscholars in their party, along with the D’Haran soldiers, the handful of guardsfrom Ildakar, and Verna’s Sisters of the Light. “We can do something. We knowsome spells.”“But we don’t know what their plan is,” Sister Rhoda pointed out, “or how we canassist them.”“We know that we should help Ildakar, no matter what,” Peretta said. “We knowwhat side to choose.”Renn’s voice cracked with dismay. “That’s Ildakar. If we can take action, thenwe must.”The strike forces galloping along the northern and southern hills were headingswiftly to some predetermined position. One group on each side of the valleystopped halfway along the boundary hills. The defenders formed a circle around agifted leader in the center, who began some sort of activity. Other strikeforces continued riding even faster along the hills, farther from Ildakar.The strike force closest to Verna and her hidden companions faced fierceopposition, though. The enemy ranks closed up as they charged forward, blockingthe team and curtailing their progress, though they all kept fighting.“Look, there is our chance! We have to help.” Renn pointed. “We can surprise theenemy from behind. Nobody knows we’re here!”“Dear spirits, yes.” Verna looked back at Amber, Rhoda, Eldine, and the otherSisters who had followed her from Cliffwall. “We will use our magic now, all ofus.”Their expedition got ready to move, even though the odds were against them. “Ifwe are going to make a difference, we’d better head out.” General Zimmer mountedhis warhorse. “Come on!”Drawing upon his glory as a wizard of Ildakar, Renn swirled his hand in the air,and the thick clouds overhead pooled like an eddy in a gray river. At hissummons, rain began to pour heavily out on the battlefield.As she mounted her horse, Verna directed her comments to the eager apprenticesfrom Cliffwall. “Remember what you learned. We taught you many spells already,and we will need every trick you can think of.”As they spurred their mounts into motion, Renn shouted in a hoarse voice, “ForIldakar!”Ahead, the nearby strike force had stalled, surrounded by half-petrifiedfighters who battered them. The Ildakarans fought furiously, seemingly protectedby unusual silken cloaks. The wizard who led the group summoned lightning toblast the enemy ranks, clearing an area and knocking the ancient soldiers back,but it bought him only a small amount of time. He got immediately to work.The enemy fighters regained strength and pressed forward again toward thetrapped strike force, while the defenders made a last stand, encircling thecentral wizard to give him room to complete his task. He lifted a sack anddribbled a red liquid on the ground, drawing some kind of large pattern.Utros’s fighters pummeled the defenders, trying to reach the wizard before hecompleted his work.“Faster!” Verna said, as they raced forward.In the downpour, Renn surprised the enemy attackers by blasting lightning frombehind them, incinerating twenty of the hardened soldiers. A roar ofastonishment swept through the ranks as they turned to face the unexpectedattack from the rear.Verna leaned forward, grasping the horse’s mane with one hand while clenchingher other into a fist and pounding the air in front of her. Her magic sent arumble of wind that slammed into the enemy line surrounding the trapped strikeforce. Amber and the other six Sisters used the same magic, blowing the stiffwarriors out of their way.The wizard at the center of the strike force did not fight back with his ownmagic, did not break his concentration as he painted an intricate design on theground. He had long grayish-yellow hair that hung in a thick braid at the sideof his head, and he worked swiftly, ignoring the bedlam all around him. Vernarealized that he must be making some kind of spell-form with the red paint.Renn called as he rode forward, “That man looks like Oron, using magic to shieldit from the rain, a wizard from the skinners’ guild!”All eight Sisters of the Light blasted with more wind. Verna released a jaggedbolt of lightning that vaporized a tall warrior in leather armor. General Zimmerrode hard with his sword raised, as did the D’Haran soldiers behind him. CaptainTrevor and the city guards kept up, flushed and determined to fight as well.They crashed through the besiegers around the strike team.“We will help you, Oron!” Renn yelled.Despite the mayhem all around her, Verna saw that the other strike forces hadformed pitched battles at generally equidistant points around the hills, like aloop that enclosed nearly a quarter of the ancient army. Verna still didn’t knowwhat they were doing, but the groups anchored themselves and fought hard toallow their gifted commander to create a spell-form on the ground, similar towhat Oron was doing.The protectors around Oron fell back in a last desperate defense, but theCliffwall expedition crashed into the enemy soldiers, scattering them and givingthe wizard all the room he needed. Verna and Renn rushed up to him. The runedrawn on the ground was unlike anything Verna had ever seen.“That looks like transference magic,” Renn said.Oron squeezed the last droplets of red on the trampled dirt and finished hispattern. He looked up, his face serious, showing no surprise or welcome. “Renn,it is about time you came back. We need more wizards to help in the fight.”“I brought these others with me. They can help, too.”Exhausted, Oron looked at the design on the ground and spread his palms aboveit, as if warming his hands over a fire. He pressed down, meeting some invisibleresistance, and a shimmering transparent glow covered the paint. “There, therune is preserved and intact, and Utros will not be able to damage it until Elsacan finish her work.” He swiped perspiration from his forehead. “If her plansucceeds, we might not need another army of our own.”He glanced around the valley and saw the other strike forces also completingtheir work. He quickly explained about the five squads, each led by a giftednoble, like himself. “The teams are each laying down a boundary rune, while Elsaand the wizard Nathan are pushing into the heart of the camp, where Elsa herselfwill anchor the transference magic and then trigger it. We might destroy asignificant portion of the enemy army.”“All the more reason for us to help,” Renn said.Oron jabbed his hand toward the sky and released a bright fireball that rocketedhigher and higher, like a flare. “Now they know my rune is in place.” Thousandsmore enemy soldiers began to close in, rebounding from the unexpected attack.Oron tossed his thick yellow braid over his shoulder. “I would like to live longenough to see the effect.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------By the time Bannon and Lila rushed back to the bluff’s edge, the first fiveNorukai ships had slammed against the docks below. Bannon ground his teethtogether. “I can smell them from here. They stink of blood, pain, and ugliness.”Lila flashed him a grin. “I would have enjoyed killing them regardless, but ifyou tell me there is even more reason to hate them, I will enjoy the fight allthe more.”The raiders threw ropes, tied their serpent ships to the pier at the base of thebluff, and swarmed off the decks. The river behind the hideous fighters wascrowded with serpent ships, all converging on Ildakar.On the cliff face, more than a hundred city fighters appeared at the openings ofvarious access tunnels, holding weapons ready to defend against the assault fromthe river. As he stood at the opening, Bannon glanced at the intricatetransference rune he had helped paint on the sheer stone. Above, on top of thebluff, though, he didn’t see the duma members he expected. “Where are Damon andQuentin? They should be here fighting! We need their magic.”The Norukai began swarming up the platforms and carved stone steps like a lineof army ants. Beside him, Lila had a short sword and a dagger, but she slid bothweapons back into their sheaths at her side. “I will fight with those later.”Instead, she picked up a barrel of flour from among the supplies stored in thetunnel and hurled it straight down. The cask crashed into two of the Norukaiclimbing the lower steps, knocking them both loose. Blood sprayed from theirbroken heads mixed with the cloud of white flour, and they tumbled down thebluff, knocking down other raiders who climbed behind them. Bannon liked theidea and did the same, tossing a small cask down to smash more Norukai.In the other tunnels the Ildakaran fighters did likewise, grabbing sacks, rocks,even a crate of old fish that they dumped down the bluff face, pelting theoncoming Norukai. But raiders continued to swarm up from their ships, ignoringtheir losses as they climbed the cliff.At last, waves of magic from above whooshed down the sandstone wall with a snapand a shudder. Bannon craned his neck and saw several figures in silken robesunleashing their gift from the top of the bluff.“Now we have some help,” Lila said.The docks anchored at the river’s edge disengaged from the rock, making thelashed serpent ships grind together, their hulls creaking. With an outcry ofdismay, the Norukai still on the decks clambered over one another, some divinginto the river as their ships shifted.But the Norukai kept coming. More raiding vessels crashed together, clogging theriver, piling up until the raiders tied their hulls together to form a boardingramp and they ran from ship to ship to reach the cliff face.The wizards on top of the bluff released more magic, and spouts of waterthundered out of the cliff face. Drainage from the streets and sewers gushed outupon the swarming Norukai. Although the cliff was already wet from the morning’srain, the effluent drenched the attackers.Bannon lugged a heavy barrel over to the opening. “Sweet Sea Mother, is thisthing full of rocks?” He only cared that it was heavy. With a lurch, he tossedthe barrel out the opening and watched it tumble and smash into one of theplatforms far below just as the Norukai tried to climb up.Lila seemed to be enjoying herself. “Let us each do that a hundred more times.Even so, we may still have to face the rest of the Norukai with our swords.” Shegrinned at him. “Then the real fun will start.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thora rose to her feet inside her dungeon cell as the heavy door crashed open.Quentin and Damon stood there, sweating and terrified. “It is time, Sovrena! Ifwe don’t work the blood magic now, Ildakar will surely fall.”“Has General Utros breached the wall?”“The other duma members are out battling his forces now, trying to implementElsa’s transference magic,” Quentin said.Damon interrupted, “And a Norukai attack fleet just arrived on the river! Fiftyserpent ships and thousands of raiders are attempting to breach the city throughthe bluffs. We cannot survive both attacks.”Thora raised her eyebrows. “So, you have decided to raise the shroud once andfor all?”Quentin nodded quickly. “It has to be now. Any duma members who would speak outagainst the action are on the battlefield, and Nicci is still gone. That meanswe can make this happen, if we move quickly. We have to do something beforeIldakar falls.”Damon clasped his hands together. “Please, Sovrena, we need your help. You arethe most skilled at bloodworking. You’ve raised the shroud before.”“I promised I would help,” she said, moving toward the doorway.Quentin hurried her along. “We have already dispatched guard teams throughoutthe city. They have the names of volunteers and will round them up.”Damon added, “Along with the provisional lists.”Galvanized, Thora followed them at a brisk pace through the stone-walledcorridors, following the bright torches that lit the way. “It is a sacrifice wemust make to save Ildakar. Those brave volunteers will rescue us.”“Eight hundred are being brought now,” Damon said as they ran along thecorridors.“We will need at least a thousand for a bloodworking of this magnitude,” Thorasaid. “And nobles, if you can find them. Gifted blood is powerful. That woulddecrease the number necessary.”“But the ungifted are easier to catch and kill,” Quentin said. “The guards aregathering great numbers of candidates. Since the murder of High Captain Stuart,they have grown much more bloodthirsty.”They passed under the stone archway and emerged into the open outside air. Thoralooked up into the gray sky and scanned across the top of the plateau. “Thepyramid is destroyed. Where will we perform the magic?”“We don’t need the pyramid,” Damon said. “We just need the spell-forms and theapparatus.”“And the blood,” Quentin said. “We had to find a place that could hold so manypeople.”The city was in a panic as word of the Norukai invasion spread. Citizens ranthrough the streets, some rushing for shelter, others grabbing weapons andracing toward the bluffs to help fight the raiders. Soldiers ran to defend themain gates and the outer walls in case General Utros should retaliate inresponse to the strike teams outside.When Thora saw where the two wizards were leading her, she was pleased. Quentinand Damon took her through the high entrance to the huge combat arena. A buzz offrightened conversation echoed among the large crowds that had already beenherded here. City guards roughly rushed people through the entrances, deaf totheir pleading. Many of the men and women were weeping, while others walked in adaze. One older couple stared ahead and held hands, walking with grace as theywillingly entered the sacrificial arena.Inside on the combat field, Thora saw that Damon had re-created the silvercrucible, the metal channels and troughs to hold the blood, the great mirrorsthat reflected the wan sunlight and directed it toward rotating prisms ofquartz. Across the raked fighting field, Quentin had drawn the completespell-form.“It is just waiting for all the blood it needs,” Damon said.As more and more people were herded into the arena waiting to die, Thora nodded.“We should start immediately.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 78 [contents.xhtml#c_ch78]Ten Norukai ships smashed into Serrimundi Harbor, skirting the wreck of thekraken hunter, like wolves ignoring prey they had already killed.From the docks, Nicci shouted, using her gift to manipulate the air so that hervoice boomed out. “The Norukai will destroy the harbor. Prepare to fight.”The wishpearl divers forgot about their lewd laziness. “The woman isn’t lying.”A second diver looked appalled at what he witnessed. “We have seen Norukaibefore. They are animals. They don’t care about money or wishpearls, justflesh.”“I heard just this morning that Effren was burned to the ground, everyoneslaughtered by Norukai raiders. I didn’t believe it.”Nicci narrowed her eyes. “Believe it. Are you going to help fight now?” She wassurprised the men actually lurched to their feet.The burning krakener sank slowly at the mouth of the harbor. Sailors raced backto their ships from the city streets and dockside taverns. Once aboard, crewmembers climbed the rigging, unfurled sails. Several ships anchored in the openwater prepared to set sail, though Nicci doubted they could get past the Norukaivessels blocking the exit to the sea.Farther down the wharf, Captain Ganley of the Mist Maiden yelled for his sailorsto return. “We need to get to open water, where we can defend ourselves!” Halfof his sailors obeyed, crowding the deck to fight for their ship, while the lessbrave ones bolted into side streets to hide in the fish markets and warehouses.Other Serrimundi residents fled into the hills.The ten serpent ships pressed into the harbor in search of easy targets. Avolley of flaming arrows set a cargo ship alight, and as its sails caught fire,many of the crew dove overboard to escape. A Norukai vessel careened against itshull with a crash and crack of splintering wood. Scarred raiders leaped over therails wielding axes, swords, and clubs to slaughter the remaining sailors on thecargo ship.Harborlord Otto ran down the dock with his daughter in tow. Seeing Nicci, hecried out. “Sorceress, you warned us! I’m sorry. Now we have to fight. Whatshould we do?”“You should have maintained defenses all along,” Nicci said in a harsh voice.“Did the Imperial Order teach you nothing?”Otto was flushed. “Emperor Jagang spared us because we had no navy. We paid himheavy taxes, and his armies moved up the coast without wasting blood or efforton conquering us. We thought Serrimundi was safe.”“The Norukai are not interested in a tithe or your surrender. They are here todestroy. I watched them burn Renda Bay. Serrimundi is just a bigger target tothem.” She wondered how many other coastal towns the raiders had already struck.Nicci stared at the oncoming serpent ships and the coordinated rows of oars thatpropelled them forward. Two of the ominous vessels closed on either side of acargo ship that lumbered toward the mouth of the harbor. They crashed into thehelpless ship, boarded it, and methodically killed every sailor aboard in a veryshort time.Otto squeezed his daughter’s shoulder and gave her a push toward the city andthe hills. “Go to the old house, Shira. Find your children and hide. Barricadethe doors in case the Norukai make it into the city.”The young woman’s eyes filled with tears. “I can’t leave you, Father. I can’tleave my fiancé.” She gestured back to the Mist Maiden.“You must not leave your children,” he said. “Now, go!”Nicci added, “If the Norukai get into the streets and ransack the city, thenthat means your father and husband are already lost.” She turned her hard gazeto the harborlord. “We can’t let that happen.” She regarded all the vessels tiedup to the docks, including the Mist Maiden. “We need to make use of these ships.They cannot just wait here to be burned and they cannot try to flee. Look—youhave a navy here, and it is ready to launch, if the captains and crew arewilling to fight.”“They are—or they will be.”With booming drums, the serpent ships pressed into the harbor, attacking anyvessel that attempted to get away. The Norukai launched volleys of fire arrows.Most of them fell short, but some struck the extended piers of Serrimundi, whileothers hit smaller fishing vessels. The flames started to spread.Nicci held out her hands, called upon her gift, and pushed, sending a focusedwhirlwind to scour and whip past the ships. The wind snuffed out the small firesbefore they could catch hold, and she hammered again with an even stronger wind,raising whitecaps that rocked the foremost Norukai vessel.After Shira ran off, Otto turned to Nicci. “Now that I know she is safe, what dowe do?”Nicci saw that the Mist Maiden was almost ready to depart, with Captain Ganleyshouting orders. His sailors untied the hawsers from the docks. “That will beour flagship. You know the captain. Will he follow orders?”“He will know he has to save sweet Shira and her children.”As Nicci turned to run with the harborlord toward the three-masted ship, shecalled to the four wishpearl divers, “You want to fight? I have a job for you.Are you brave enough?”With a haughty retort, the man who had made the lewd comments said, “Don’tinsult us.”“Then don’t give me reason to. Come!”The shirtless men sprinted after her to the Mist Maiden, running up thegangplank. Captain Ganley bellowed to the crew members who had stayed with himto defend the ship. His well-practiced sailors moved the webs of lines,stretching the sails, and Nicci used her gift to nudge the sailing ship intomotion. Other vessels nearby were also setting their sails. The crews armedthemselves with boat hooks and staves.Harborlord Otto ran to the Mist Maiden’s bow and shouted to the other ships. “Wehave to drive off the invaders or they will burn Serrimundi. Fight for our city,fight for our families!”Captain Ganley said, “Many of those ships don’t even hail from Serrimundi,Otto.”“Then they will fight for their own lives,” Nicci said. “That should be enoughreason for anybody.”She pushed with the wind, assisting the sails, and the Mist Maiden pulled awayfrom the docks, accompanied by three nearby ships. At the edge of the harbor,near the stone figure of the Sea Mother, the krakener had dwindled to a merecurl of smoke, its blackened hulk submerged.The attacking Norukai rowed swiftly, and the first serpent ship careened intothe outlying piers. Raiders swarmed off the decks, and the townspeople rushed todefend the city, but Nicci couldn’t help them, not yet. Right now, she guidedthe naval attack against the other serpent ships.“I will try to destroy five of them,” she said to Captain Ganley and HarborlordOtto. “For a start.”“What are we supposed to do? How do we help?” demanded one of the wishpearldivers. “We didn’t come aboard just to watch.” His companions grumbled as well.Instead of answering, Nicci turned to Ganley. “I need glass bottles withstoppers, one for each of these men. They will be carrying deadly weapons.”Frowning, the captain turned to Otto. “What does she—?”“Do as the sorceress asks. She warned us we might be attacked, and I refused tolisten. I will heed whatever she has to say now.”That was enough for Captain Ganley. He barked orders, and soon his first matereturned with four brown glass bottles from the galley. He uncorked the stoppersand poured the contents over the side, then handed the empty bottles to Nicci.She smelled the pungent tang of spiced liquids, pepper oils, and vanillatinctures. “These will do.”Ganley stood on the foredeck and shouted orders as the Mist Maiden movedforward, driven by Nicci’s magic. The serpent ships closed the distance,propelled by pounding drums and lines of razor-edged oars.Nicci reaffirmed in her own mind how she would destroy five of them. She turnedto the surly wishpearl divers. “You have strong lungs. Can you truly hold yourbreath for a long time?”“That’s why we bear these marks!” The men indicated the tattoos on their chests.“Then I need you to swim—deep,” she said.Carefully, using great dexterity with the gift, Nicci conjured a small ball ofwizard’s fire no larger than a grape and dropped it into the first brown glassbottle, suspending it with another spell to keep the destructive force bottledand ready. She pushed the cork into place, and the brown glass container blazedlike a lantern. “This is what you need.” She handed it to the first diver, andcreated another ball of wizard’s fire to put into the second bottle, and thenmade two more, so that all four wishpearl divers had one.“The raiders are closing in!” Ganley yelled.With booming drums, the serpent ships approached the Mist Maiden. The crew criedout in defiance, building their anger in a desperate attempt to overcome theirfear.Otto turned to Nicci. “We are ready to fight, Sorceress. I hope your planworks.”“Fight them and kill them,” Nicci said. “That is the plan.”The Norukai aboard the approaching ships rallied an even louder cheer. Withtheir mouths slashed and cheeks tattooed like serpents, the raiders looked likean inhuman army, but Nicci wasn’t so easily terrified.“Overboard, now!” she told the wishpearl divers, after explaining what theyneeded to do. “You can win half the battle for us, if you succeed.”Clutching their blazing glass bottles, the divers agreed upon their targets andplunged overboard, swimming deep.Nicci looked over the rail and saw the bright lights submerging like glowingnight wisps, which then began to move toward the serpent ships.At the rim of the harbor, Nicci watched two more serpent ships crash among thedocked vessels that had not yet managed to set sail. The Norukai threw torchesto light the ships and piers on fire, and the blaze would surely spread to thewarehouses. Serrimundi could become an inferno.But before Nicci could fight that battle, she had to destroy these otherattacking ships.The crew of the Mist Maiden waved staves, swords, boat hooks, harpoons. Niccitargeted the carved serpent at the prow of the foremost ship and released ablast of wizard’s fire. The searing flames turned the serpent figurehead to ash.The Norukai roared their outrage, and Nicci used wind to deflect the oncominglead ship, shoving it aside so that instead of ramming them, it barely grazedthe Mist Maiden. Even so, the ships were close enough that the Norukai men andwomen leaped across the gap, swinging axes, spears, and swords in mad bloodlust.Nicci recognized their leader in his sharkskin vest and the implanted fang thatprotruded from his bald scalp. It was Captain Kor, one of the traders who hadcome to Ildakar to sell slaves. As his crew swarmed aboard the Mist Maiden, Korsprang onto the deck. His hard boots landed with a thud. Screaming loudly, moreraiders came across, ready to slaughter Captain Ganley’s crew.The Mist Maiden’s sailors rushed to meet the enemy. Nicci strode forward, herragged blond hair drifting in the wind, her black dress rippling as she built upher magic. She faced the Norukai captain, ready for blood."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 79 [contents.xhtml#c_ch79]Along with the clash of blades, the thudding of hooves, and the shouts of painand fury, the Ildakaran strike team fought their way deeper into General Utros’scamp. Nathan hurled more wizard’s fire ahead of them, clearing the way so he andElsa could keep moving toward their destination. The blazing ball engulfed fiftyenemies, but within seconds more ancient soldiers filled the gap, closing in.“We will not make it much farther,” Nathan said, breathing hard as he and Elsarode deeper into the camp. “This may be the best we can do. Is it good enough?”Somewhere, she needed to draw her large anchor rune in order for thetransference magic to work.As a half-petrified soldier ran toward the sorceress, Nathan swept out with arumble of air, throwing the man aside. Under his breath, he said, “I reallyshould have had Nicci show me how to stop a human heart. I never wanted thattype of power because it seemed unfair against an enemy.” His long white hairhung in sweaty clumps, dusty and spattered with blood from the warriors he hadalready killed. “I forgot that in war, everything is fair.”After Elsa pulled her horse to a halt in a clear area with churned-up mud, sheslid out of the saddle. “This place will have to do. I had hoped to set theanchor deeper into the camp so the circle would engulf more of the army.” Hervoice was ragged, filled with heartache.Many of their guardians had already fallen in their push to get this far, butthe two morazeth and Rendell were still with them, along with about a dozenothers. They didn’t look as if they expected to survive.“I hope this is worth the price. Oh, Nathan, I hope it’s worth it.” Elsa heldher red paint and moved about frenetically, spilling bright lines, creating anintricate design across the cleared space. Her frightened horse galloped off,but she didn’t seem to care.The morazeth, Thorn and Lyesse, battled furiously to give Elsa room to work, asdid many surviving Ildakaran fighters. The toughened silk robes offered someprotection against the wild enemy blows. Together, the defenders kept fighting,keeping Nathan and Elsa safe. She just needed time to finish.As the older sorceress continued drawing her powerful rune on the ground, Nathansent out a furious shock wave that spread in concentric circles, knocking theenemy soldiers back and keeping them away from Elsa. She moved with swift stepsalong the perimeter, drawing her lines, while the remaining Ildakarans used alltheir energy to keep the attackers away.Nathan dismounted to protect Elsa, and within moments he had lost his horse aswell. Elsa was gambling everything on this attempt, and Nathan could tell thather thoughts had narrowed down to the singular pinpoint of her task. He had togive her the chance.But their success depended on the other five teams as well. Without the boundaryrunes in place, the transference magic would fail. Nathan looked up with athrill of excitement to see a bright fireball shoot straight into the sky fromthe farthest of the two southern teams. “Another one, Elsa! Four of themfinished!”His distraction lasted only a moment before a burly warrior riding a half-stonehorse thundered toward him, charging into the circle where Elsa was marking herrune. Nathan pulled up a wall of dirt like a rope from beneath the ground. Thedirt slammed into the horse and sent the beast sprawling. The warrior tumbledout of the saddle, and Nathan leaped upon him with his ornate sword. He plungedthe blade down, breaking through the soldier’s hard skin into his chest. Heturned with the sword in one hand and wizard’s fire in the other. He threwanother flaming ball to knock back twenty more enemy soldiers, but he felt hisgift waning. He didn’t have much strength left.He watched the signal flame flicker out in the sky. Against all odds, four ofthe boundary runes were drawn and preserved. He turned to scan the burned hills.“Still one more.”He saw flurries of the ancient soldiers closing in where the last group neededto mark their design. Gray clouds and then lashing snow and ice came down in apillar, harsh weather blasting the enemies away. The gifted leader of the laststrike force was using magic to complete his task, while the other foursuccessful groups were now fighting to survive as they retreated to safety.Elsa worked, breathing hard and sweating as she finished her large design. Onfoot, the two morazeth battled like wild animals, and Rendell fought clumsilybut vehemently with his iron-tipped club.Elsa had a fierceness Nathan had never seen before. As more enemy soldiers brokethrough and tried to attack, closing in around them, Nathan remained close toher, fighting to keep her safe, and he saw that she was crying as she drew herlines.When she activated the transference rune and drew all the heat from theKillraven River and the sandstone bluffs, the effect would kill countless enemysoldiers. Nathan tried to reassure her. “They are enemies, and sometimes enemiesdeserve to die.”“But not friends,” she said. “Not dear friends.”Nathan didn’t know what she meant. When several more soldiers charged forward,spears extended, he unleashed another hammer of air. A spear point caught in hisenhanced silk covering, but couldn’t pierce the fabric. Nathan struck hard withhis sword.A hundred yards away, he saw General Utros himself wearing a mask of beaten goldacross half his face and thick leather armor that bore the flame symbol of IronFang. His two painted sorceresses stalked along with him, pushing forward toface Nathan and Elsa.“Dear spirits, I don’t know how long we can last against two sorceresses and allthese soldiers. Please hurry, Elsa!”Then he saw a flaming arrow climb into the air from where the fifth strike forcehad been marking their rune. The bright light soared high, then arced down,sputtering out and leaving a trail of smoke. It wasn’t magical fire, but he knewwhat it meant. “The last signal! The final boundary rune is done, but they didnot use a fireball.” He knew that no gifted person would simply send an arrow.“That means…”Elsa squared her shoulders. “That means whoever made the boundary rune is nowdead, but the pattern is finished.” She braced herself. “We are ready. I havejust one more connecting line here.” She held up her sack of red paint. “Andthen I can activate the transference. It will be glorious, Nathan. I hope itsaves Ildakar.” Her tears flowed more freely now. “I am so glad to have knownyou. You are such a dear, dear friend.”His heart felt a chill. “What do you mean? Prepare your rune, so we can escapeand celebrate together.”“This is the anchor rune, the center of the spell,” she said. “It needs to beactivated here. It will draw the transference magic from the five boundaryrunes, pull it all together, and connect the lines. Anything enclosed will be inthe target zone.” She drew a deep breath. “And I have to be at the center.”Nathan recoiled. “No, I won’t let you. Come!” He extended his hand to grab her,but Elsa surprised him. She called up a surge of air. He hadn’t even known shecould be so strong in that type of magic. Billowing waves of wind yanked him offhis feet, bore him up into the sky like a piece of chaff. The two morazeth,Rendell, and all the rest of the escort fighters flew up with him.“Stop!” Nathan cried. “Come with me.”He flailed, putting up a shield to block her magic, but Elsa flung him on arushing river of air with the speed of a quarrel shot out of a crossbow. Helurched out, tried to find something to hold on to, but he was a projectile,catapulted over the enemy soldiers, along with the rest of his party.All by herself in the large cleared circle where she had drawn her rune, Elsasqueezed the last droplets of red that connected the remaining line in herpattern. Hundreds of ancient soldiers pushed closer, now that the defenders weregone. They would engulf Elsa, who looked so small and all alone.She completed her spell-form and triggered the transference magic.The heat arrived all at once, and the plain blazed with the heat of the sun.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spouts of water gushed through drainage holes in the bluff, streaming down uponthe Norukai on the ramps and ladders. Bannon had run out of barrels and cratesto throw, but other volunteer fighters continued pelting the invaders withrocks, bricks, large pieces of pottery.The snarling Norukai tried to dodge the barrage. Many died, falling down thecliff into the masses of raiders, but their numbers seemed inexhaustible. Bannonfelt a familiar fire burning through his veins. Unable to control his rage, heleaned out of the overhang, waving Sturdy as he shouted, “We will cut you topieces.”Lila gave a confident nod. “When they come, you and I will keep score. I mightsoon consider you an equal, instead of an apprentice.” Even with her terrifyingsmile, he found her beautiful and alluring. “If you do well enough, boy, I mightreward you again.”He let out a brief laugh. “I thought you said I was rewarding you.”“Do they have to be separate things?”From the top of the cliff above, gifted nobles hurled conventional fire, rollingflames that struck the misty rocks. Some burned the hideous raiders, but theNorukai kept climbing even when their skin was smoking.Though caught up in the battle, Bannon saw the giant painted rune on thecliffside begin to glow, throbbing and pulsing. The scarred raiders cried out,startled. The Ildakaran defenders halted their barrage and retreated into thetunnels, suddenly fearful.“It’s the transference magic!” Bannon said.Lila swept an arm across his chest and knocked him back into the shelter of theoverhang. The giant rune brightened, and Bannon felt the breath rush out of hislungs. The drizzle in the air turned into tiny frozen diamonds, like grains ofsand. With a sound like a thousand bones breaking at once, the sheets of wateron the cliff froze into a glass of ice. The flow thundering out of the sluicessolidified as all the heat was sucked out of the cliff stone.With a shattering roar, the Killraven River itself froze solid, heaving up insudden slabs. Like deadly cold fists, the river ice crushed the Norukai ships,splintering the hulls as if they were no more than toys.With angry curses, the raiders began to fall, slipping from where theirhandholds had turned to ice. Some Norukai warriors had frozen solid, covered bysheets of ice, but others broke away from the cliff and toppled to splatter onthe rock-hard river. The platforms and ladders shattered in seconds.Astonished, the Ildakaran defenders poked their heads out from their tunnels andcheered. Bannon’s breath steamed out of his mouth and nose, and he laughed intriumph, turning with delight toward Lila.But even the sudden storm of cold did not deter the Norukai raiders for morethan a few moments. Many had tumbled from the bluff and lay dead or broken onthe river ice, but some still clung to the frozen cliffs, used their daggers tochip away at the ice, and began to haul themselves up again.There were fifty serpent ships, and countless more Norukai, who hadn’t evenbegun to fight.Bannon leaned over to look down the glazed wall. Long icicles hung like fangs,but the hideous raiders showed no fear. By the hundreds, they swarmed up, andBannon prepared to fight for his life."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 80 [contents.xhtml#c_ch80]Two more reckless Norukai ships plowed into Serrimundi Harbor. The raiderstossed torches onto the wooden docks and into the rigging of commercial shipstied up to the piers. The burly attackers abandoned their oars, leaped ontoshore, and ran forward, striking down terrified dockworkers who tried to defendtheir city.The Norukai men and women were unstoppable, letting out wordless screams toterrify their victims. They lunged forward, hacking with axes, twirling andsmashing with heavy battle hammers, thrusting with bone-tipped spears. Theyraced along dock boards slippery with blood, leaving mangled bodies strewnabout.The dockside fires began to spread into the warehouses and marketplaces.Families evacuated, taking small boats up the canals or running into the hills.Serrimundi had been sure of its peace and prosperity for far too long.Slowly, though, the frightened people began to turn like a wave that breaks onthe shore. After sending their families off to hide, brave citizens returned tothe harborside, carrying household weapons. Some old veterans managed to findarmored chest plates, heirloom swords, shields that had been used fordecoration, and dented helmets from near-forgotten conflicts in the past.Even with three serpent ships piled against the damaged docks, the landedNorukai numbered less than two hundred, and Serrimundi could call many moredefenders. The tide turned as the city awakened.From the deck of the Mist Maiden, Nicci saw the clash on the docks, but shefocused on the five nearest ships. Her own makeshift navy was crowded withdetermined but frightened sailors to stand against them, and they also hadNicci.As the lead serpent ship caromed off the Mist Maiden’s hull, its charredsnakelike figurehead still smoked. The barbaric Norukai leaped onto the deckwith bare arms, wearing engraved metal bracers, spiked collars on their necks,rings and chains that made both the male and female warriors look more likedemons than humans. When they let out ululating war screams, their jaws gapedwide from sliced-open cheeks.The Mist Maiden’s first mate gripped his sword with both hands. He held theblade up to defend himself, but a Norukai bone-tipped spear plunged into hischest. Choking blood, he dropped his sword and fell to his knees. The armed crewof the Mist Maiden moaned at seeing the first casualty, but they had no time towait. Dozens more raiders landed on their deck, charging forward with a forestof sharp weapons.Nicci couldn’t help the first mate, but she reached out with her gift andfocused on the Norukai who had thrown the spear. The broad-shouldered womanstood crowing in triumph, but Nicci concentrated, found the woman’s heart, andused her gift to crush it. The Norukai woman fell with a thud in front of one ofher running comrades, who tripped and sprawled over the body. Nicci shifted herfocus to the man, and as he lurched to his feet, Nicci found his heart andstopped it as well.The ship’s deck became a flurry of screams and deadly weapons. Three more MistMaiden sailors fell. Harborlord Otto used a large staff to smash skulls andbreak arms.Captain Ganley had a ceremonial sword, but it was dull, and he was unpracticed.As two Norukai closed in on him, he swung the sword, then dropped it and grabbeda boat hook instead, with which he seemed more familiar. He swung with all hisstrength, raking one Norukai’s face with the curved hook. The second Norukaithrust in viciously, but Ganley caught him with the point of the boat hook andshoved it into his abdomen. The raider grabbed the slick shaft of the weapon andstared at it, apparently offended to be killed so early in the battle. Theship’s captain, ashen but determined, shoved hard again, pushing the dyingNorukai backward until he fell off the end of the boat hook.After landing on the deck, Captain Kor roared, urging the raiders on. “Norukai!King Grieve ordered you to die, but you are not allowed to die until we secureour victory for the serpent god.” He held a long-handled axe in one hand, asword in the other. “We ransacked five villages so far, but now we take on anentire city!”After Renda Bay, all Norukai were her enemies, but Nicci would take greatpleasure in killing this particular one. She already loathed the man from havingseen Kor beat slaves in Ildakar and laugh at the pain he inflicted. She held upher hand, felt the gift building, eager to be released. She could stop Kor’sheart. She could throw wizard’s fire at him. She could knock him overboard witha blast of wind.But when he saw her and recognized her, his words made Nicci pause. “Thesorceress from Ildakar! I thought King Grieve would kill you there in hisinvasion, but now the pleasure falls to me.”Nicci had no time to parse his words as she faced him. “I don’t know your KingGrieve, but I will be happy to kill you first.” She had to dispatch the Norukaicaptain swiftly, so she could defend the other sailors. She raised her hand,felt the magic surge in her grasp to annihilate him— Just then, the adjacentserpent ship exploded. An intense flash of light speared upward through the hullbelow the waterline, shattering the deck and erupting in a spray of fire.Wizard’s fire. Wherever the spattering flames caught the Norukai, the deadlyfire burned through their flesh and bones and kept burning. The serpent shipgroaned and listed to one side, taking on great amounts of water from below,filling the hold. The raiders who had boarded the Mist Maiden spun and howled inoutrage, astonished by what had happened.A second Norukai ship burst into flame, more wizard’s fire spewing upward frombelow, cracking hull planks, shattering the keel, turning the vessel into aburning wreck. The Norukai wildly searched for this unexpected enemy.Nicci saw the remaining pair of glowing spheres below the waterline, where thelast two wishpearl divers were delivering glass bottles filled with magicalfire. Two more Norukai ships suffered the same fate, wizard’s fire shatteringout of the glass bottles and ripping upward.Within minutes, the four wishpearl divers broke the surface, treading water andsucking in gulps of air.As the battle continued aboard the Mist Maiden, Nicci called more wizard’s firewith her hand, but she wouldn’t risk unleashing it here. Kor’s raiding vesselwas smashed up against the ship, and the fire would surely spread.Realizing that Nicci was somehow responsible for the explosions, Kor sprangforward, swinging his heavy axe. She ducked, felt the blade swoop just above herhead, and he followed through with a swift jab of the sword in his other hand.Nicci spun away, but the sharp blade sliced her black dress and laid open a gashacross her ribs. She slammed him backward with her gift, but Kor planted hisfeet and shoved forward, swinging both weapons. Nicci reached out to stop hisheart, but he moved too quickly, spitting, attacking, and she couldn’t spare aninstant to find the right point.The Norukai attackers were more frenzied after seeing four of their shipswrecked. They became suicidal, attacking without any thought of surviving thebattle. It reminded Nicci of when she saw Bannon consumed with hisuncontrollable blood rage.“You will all die!” Kor said. “And you’ll all grieve, just like everyone inIldakar right now.” He swung his battle-axe and struck the deck boards, gougingout large chunks. “The whole world will know King Grieve, but Serrimundi willnever forget Captain Kor.”Nicci was about to crush his spine, but she needed to know. “What do you meanIldakar is under attack? How?” She had traveled through the sliph, left the cityto face the siege of General Utros, but she had not considered a Norukaiinvasion.“Fifty ships, Sorceress. King Grieve has thousands of Norukai warriors.” Korchuckled. “I have told our king everything he needs to know to take the city.Ildakar will be his capital when he conquers the Old World.”Nicci imagined a force of ships five times greater than what was now attackingSerrimundi. Could Nathan and the gifted duma members handle such attacks fromtwo sides, the Norukai and Utros?“I will go back and help them defeat King Grieve as soon as I have eliminatedyou,” Nicci said. “I will tell your king how you died.”Kor sneered at her. “I’m already dead. Grieve ordered me to fight until I diedin battle, and I intend to do so. But I will see you dead before I fall.” Hecharged toward her, his eyes blazing.Since he wanted to die here, she granted Kor his wish. She summoned her focus,shaped the air, and slammed it together, crushing his skull from all sides. Shecaved in the bone and turned his brain into a pulp.Even as the Norukai captain collapsed, Nicci turned to the remaining raiders,anxious to defeat them and save Serrimundi. She saw the ships in the harbor andthe warehouses in flames. Hundreds more Norukai fought their last battles, butthe people had rallied and were driving the scarred warriors back.Nicci drew one of her daggers in her right hand, and called up magic in herleft. For now, she devoted herself to this battle. She had killed hundredsbefore, and she would do it again today. She got to work."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 81 [contents.xhtml#c_ch81]After the transference magic activated, Bannon hoped Nathan and Elsa hadsurvived out on the plain, which must now be an inferno. The magic left onlybitter cold on the cliffs and the frozen Killraven River.Wearing nothing but her scant leather wrap, Lila showed no reaction to the cold,although the breath steamed out of her mouth when she spoke. “They are coming.Be ready, boy.”Despite the suddenly frigid temperature, Bannon felt sweat running down hisskin. He steeled himself. “My name is Bannon.”Even though all the Norukai vessels had been locked in fists of river ice, theraiders were not deterred. Ignoring their dead who had toppled from the bluff,they brought out their own siege ladders from the decks and braced the longnarrow constructions against the glazed sandstone.The unstable ice continued to crack and pop as shards broke loose and fell downthe cliff like frozen spears, but the Norukai kept climbing toward the cargoplatforms and tunnel openings.Ready to fight, Bannon and Lila watched the raiders ascend, level by level,using axes and daggers to chop handholds in icy rock. “Sweet Sea Mother,” hesaid, clutching his frigid sword, “we can’t just wait for them to overwhelm us.”“Agreed,” Lila said. “Let’s go down and stop them from climbing higher.” Sheswung out of the overhang to the narrow ledge that led down to the next loadingplatform. The footing was precarious in the best of conditions.Bannon gasped, “The ice—”“The ice is in patches. Hold on to the solid rock and follow me down to thisscaffold.” She glanced up at him. “Unless you want to stay up there and watch mefight alone?”“I’ll fight at your side.” He sheathed his sword in order to use both hands ashe made his way after her.Ildakarans poked out of sheltered tunnels, breathing steam in the bitter-coldair. They redoubled their efforts to throw any remaining debris they could find.At the top of the plateau, the three gifted nobles had come back after theabrupt wave of transference magic. Now they used the gift to dislodge ice chunksand send them tumbling down the frozen rock. Bannon couldn’t understand whyDamon and Quentin hadn’t responded to the urgent alarm, since they were far morepowerful wizards. Ildakar needed them!Now that Elsa’s transference spell was done, the sandstone began to warm rapidlyunder the bright sunlight, and veils of mist whispered all around, like a smokescreen. Bannon saw at least ten Norukai warriors slip and fall, screaming, butmore kept climbing. The largest Norukai led the charge, a big man with bonespikes implanted in his shoulders and iron plates grafted onto his fists. He wasaccompanied by a spiderlike albino creature whose skin was pocked by what lookedto be countless bite marks.“My Grieve, King Grieve!” the creature cried as he scuttled upward, finding tinyhandholds. “Cold, snow, ice! I told you, I dreamed it. Cold, cold!”The Norukai king glared down at him. “You were right, Chalk, but you alsodreamed a victory. I don’t care about ice. I care about Ildakar.”Bannon dropped down to an icy wooden platform that was used to raise and lowercrates. Anchored to the cliff, the platform had frozen in place, the supportingropes iron hard, but it was wide enough for Bannon to make a stand. Lila sprangbeside him onto the wood, and the two of them watched the first Norukai climbingcloser to them.Bannon braced himself, feeling the anger heat his blood. He pulled Sturdy out ofits scabbard and held it ready. Beside him, Lila grinned, holding her shortsword and dagger. She spat down at the enemy. “These Norukai may be uglier thanUtros’s soldiers, but I think they should be easier to kill.”The sounds of battle grew louder as more invaders climbed the rocks and reachedloading platforms and ledges scattered across the sandstone bluff. On one of thenarrow wooden shelves, three defenders—Bannon recognized the young painters whohad put the finishing touches on Elsa’s giant rune—fought with sticks andknives. Their platform blocked one of the main entrances into the bluff. Theywhacked at the clutching hands of the Norukai, but they were overwhelmed.One of the young fighters was stabbed through the side, and a female Norukaitossed his body from the platform. She and two other raiders climbed up,gripping the edge of the scaffolding. The remaining two young men fought withknives, hacking off Norukai fingers, and three of the raiders fell to theirdeaths, but it wasn’t enough. Six more Norukai gained the platform, and theyoung men were doomed. They looked at each other, and Bannon saw a silent,fatalistic understanding pass between them. With the last of their strength, thetwo bloodied Ildakaran defenders used their knives to slash the ropes holdingthe platform. The ice-slick scaffolding broke free, dumping the two young men aswell as the climbing Norukai down the cliff to the frozen river below.Seeing this, Bannon let out a moan. “I am not waiting anymore!” He left the safeplatform and scrambled down a slippery ladder, not even thinking about the sheerfall. Instead, he dropped to the next shelf and reached another scaffoldingplatform that dangled against the bluff. Lila scrambled after him.Nearby, King Grieve and his freakish white companion climbed up, batting awaydefenders. Bannon saw him and knew his enemy, the leader of the loathsomeslavers. “I will kill you, King Grieve,” he shouted.The Norukai ruler looked at Bannon as if he were an insect, and grinned with hishideously scarred mouth. He shifted his ascent, climbing to the platform wherethe young swordsman stood ready. Bannon’s body was covered with sweat. He feltthe fire inside of him, and he wasn’t afraid of the battle at all.The wood on the platform was still slick. Ignoring the cold and the treacherousice in crannies, Grieve clung like a beetle to the rocks. Intent on Bannon, hemoved along the narrow incised path, climbing stone stairs that were smallerthan his boots.Bannon recalled how the Norukai had tried to capture him when he was a boy,dragging him to their long boats, and poor Ian … a life lost, tormented. He alsothought about how many raiders he had killed at Renda Bay, and he looked forwardto killing more, here and now.“Look out, boy!” Lila landed on the platform next to him.He heard a grunt just beneath him, and he spun to see a hefty Norukai lurchingto the other side of the platform, reaching up to grab him from below. TheNorukai opened his sliced mouth wide, and Bannon’s boot heel caught him full inthe lower jaw with a vicious kick. Flesh tore, facial muscles snapped, and theNorukai’s entire lower jaw ripped off, leaving the man gurgling, his tonguedangling like a flap of raw meat from his open throat. Flailing, the raidergrabbed at Bannon’s foot, but the young man kicked again, caught his enemy fullin the forehead, and sent him flying out into open air.Two more raiders crawled up the side of the bluff, and Lila thrust at them withher short sword.King Grieve had not forgotten Bannon’s challenge, though. He worked his way overwith his pale shaman scampering after him. He seized the edge of the platform,hauling himself closer. Bannon swung Sturdy, and Grieve blocked it with amuscular arm, catching the sword blade against one of his metal bracers. Sparksflew. Grieve grunted from the blow and let out a serpentlike hiss of challenge.He swung himself off the icy stone path and landed heavily on the woodenplatform.Grieve had a thick, cruel blade that Bannon wasn’t sure he could have liftedwith two hands, but the Norukai king held it in a single palm. He reached out tograb the young man, who swung a wide stroke with Sturdy. The king threw himselfbackward and the blade missed his broad chest.As his emotions built up for this vital battle, Bannon began to see red at theedges of his vision. He smashed with the sword and sliced a crimson line acrossGrieve’s chest, but the Norukai king didn’t twitch. He hammered back with hishuge curved sword, catching Bannon unawares. The young man barely managed todeflect the blow.Lila decapitated a Norukai who had climbed up the other side of the platform.The ice-encrusted ropes groaned with the extra weight.As the sun continued to warm the bluffs and the fog faded, more chunks of iceshattered and slid like broken glass down the cliff face. The Norukai had thrownup additional siege ladders, building makeshift platforms so they could climbhigher. Some raiders had already reached the lower tunnels. Below, the river wasbeginning to creak and crack as the current backed up, flooding the banks. Thethick surface ice broke apart.All Bannon could see was Grieve, king of the Norukai, the leader responsible forso many brutal raids, for causing such incredible pain and misery. Had this manbeen king when Ian was captured as a boy a dozen years ago? Even if not,Grieve’s predecessor would have been just like him. All Norukai men and womenwere just like him. Bannon felt a black heat growing hotter and darker withinhim.If Nicci or Nathan were here, they could have used wizard’s fire to annihilateall of the attackers at once, but Bannon was just as happy to do this with hisown blade. He would draw the blood of the vile raider king.“You’re the one who will grieve,” Bannon said. In a blinding, surprising rushwith Sturdy, he pummeled Grieve, driving the big king to the edge of theplatform.The gangly shaman jumped onto the platform next to him. “My Grieve!”Barely able to see through his red haze, Bannon swung his sword, intending tochop off the Norukai king’s head, but Grieve ducked. Instead, Sturdy’s sharpenededge sliced through the thick rope that held up one corner of the platform.Suddenly, the wooden base lurched and dropped. Grieve stumbled, let out a roughcry, and slipped. He barely managed to grab the edge as he fell. His nails bitinto the wood, holding on to the icy surface. His jaw muscles clenched with thestrain, widening the flap of scarred skin on his cheeks.Bannon slipped, scrambling for purchase as his feet slid out from under him.Grieve grabbed his boot, clutching his ankle with a grip like the jaws of awolf. The young man kicked and kicked again, catching King Grieve full in theface. The platform swayed.Lila cried out and slashed with her sword, cutting the throat of yet anotherNorukai who climbed onto the now-unbalanced platform.More icicles pattered down the cliff, booming into other chunks and starting anicefall. Water from the frozen sluice began to spray out again as the backed-upcurrent pushed through the blockage.Bannon smashed his foot into Grieve’s face again. “Die!” The king’s crushed nosespurted blood, but his eyes blazed like firebrands.“My Grieve!” Chalk screamed, and clawed his way forward, barely able to hold onto the sliding, tilted platform. He grabbed for Grieve, but Bannon swept one legout to dislodge him, and the scarred shaman tripped and fell over the edge. Heshrieked as he dropped toward the lower platforms.In that instant, Grieve let out a shocked, anguished scream: “Chalk!”Bannon struck him again, kicking so hard that Grieve’s head snapped back. Hisgrip on Bannon’s boot loosened, and he, too, fell, roaring in anger.Bannon scrabbled on the icy wood of the tilted platform, trying to hold on. Notfar below, he heard a crash as Grieve and the pale shaman slammed into one ofthe other platforms and the swarms of climbing Norukai. Bannon clawed at thewood, dropping his sword, which slid and clanged off the platform and plungeddown the bluff. His hands squeaked on the ice, and wood splinters tore open hisfingers, but he couldn’t hold on.Lila lunged down for him. She seized his wrist, and he grasped her, holding onwith all his might, but his hand was covered in blood and water. His skin wasslick. She anchored herself by holding one of the ropes, trying to maintain hergrip. “Hold me!”Bannon squeezed, but his fingers slipped. His bloody palm slid through hers, andgravity pulled at him. He couldn’t hold on. He snatched at the edge of theplatform as he slid the last few inches.Lila’s eyes were wide, her face filled with shock and horror and a long,whispered “Nooooo!”Bannon fell, his fingertips just touching hers for a last instant. He tumbledfrom the platform, falling past the rough sandstone cliff, seeing the ice, theopenings. He tried to grab for something, anything. For a second, he caught theedge of another walkway, but his fingers slipped again and he tumbled throughthe air.Unexpectedly he crashed on his back among dozens of bodies—murdered Ildakarandefenders, as well as dead Norukai piled on one of the wide lower platforms. Butsome of them were still alive, their fall cushioned by the soft flesh. KingGrieve was there, as was the white shaman, both of them climbing to their feet.Bannon flailed about, looking for his sword.Grieve bellowed, “Take him.”The Norukai closed around him and swallowed him up in a mob of hideous faces."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 82 [contents.xhtml#c_ch82]The arena at the heart of Ildakar had become a slaughterhouse, but this was theonly chance for the city to survive. Sovrena Thora knew it.As the battle against the Norukai invaders continued and the fires of Elsa’stransference spell raged across the ancient army in the valley, Quentin andDamon pressed forward with their massive bloodworking. They didn’t have muchtime, and Thora urged them on.Determined, the city guard marched lines of volunteers onto the open sands, manyof them weeping. These brave people had come forward in a time of Ildakar’sgreat need, had offered their blood, their lives, convinced they must dosomething for their beloved city. But now the time had come, and the realsacrifice required more bravery than just writing down their names in a book.Thora watched hundreds and hundreds of people with their throats slit, spillingtheir blood into the spell-form troughs fused into the arena sands. It was whatIldakar required, and these people had to meet their obligations.Damon had shaped the troughs with his gift and added gathering magic, so thatthe blood pooled where it was necessary, not a drop wasted. The spell-form wasbroad enough and deep enough to hold the quantity of blood necessary to raisethe shroud again.It was what Ildakar needed. It was what Thora needed. She knew more than everthat she was the heart of her city. In her own veins flowed the true blood ofIldakar. She still felt a lingering heaviness of stone throughout her body,where the petrification spell hadn’t entirely worn off. Because Maxim hadcreated the spell, and presumably canceled it to awaken the stone army, sheguessed that meant he was still alive, which angered her. Otherwise that lastmagical thread would have been severed and she would have been restored to fleshagain.Adessa had failed, but Thora had to think of Ildakar now. Nothing was moreimportant than Ildakar.Damon and Quentin were sweaty and covered with blood, like butchers in a yaxenslaughter yard. The pair of wizards grabbed one victim after another, wrapped anarm around the chest and made a quick cut with their sacrificial blades beforetossing the dying body to the edge of the trough, and reaching for the nextdazed volunteer. They had killed hundreds already, and the two men wereshuddering with the endless effort. But they moved mechanically, killing onemore, then one more, then one more.Thora knew it needed to be faster.She extended a finger toward the shivering sacrifices lined up in front of theblood troughs. She used her gift to create a razor edge of air and slashed herfingernail in a line. Her invisible knife sliced deep, cutting through thethroats of the victims, ten at a time. They were astonished as their necksunexpectedly yawned open and blood gushed out. They toppled forward, pouringtheir lifeblood into the channels, paying the necessary price. Everyone had topay the price.Watching the vicious but extremely effective slice of the sovrena’s magic knife,Damon and Quentin looked startled and disturbed, but they nodded. More victimsgroaned and shuddered as they were dragged forward. Suddenly, ten of thecaptives lost their nerve and broke free. The city guards gave chase and stabbedthe victims in the back, driving them down to the sand like fighters in an arenaexhibition.Alarmed, Thora shouted after them, “Cut their throats before it’s too late!Don’t waste the blood.”The guards lifted the heads of the dying cowards and bled them into the channelsof the spell-form.Now that they had begun the bloodworking, Thora felt fully alive again. Her truedream had returned, and she was saving Ildakar as she had always promised to do.History would remember Thora, Sovrena Thora, and she would no longer bedisgraced. Her name would not be spoken with shame. She was the personfundamental to this final bloodworking to save the city.Best of all, Nathan and Elsa were outside the city walls, and even treacherousNicci was gone. They would not be saved. After the city was safely hiddenbeneath the shroud, Ildakar would have a real chance to become the perfectsociety she had always envisioned. Despite her normally implacable attitude,Thora felt a warm joy as she watched more victims fall and more blood flow.Using her invisible knife again, she caught others unawares, cutting theirthroats and using a shove of magic to knock their dying forms toward thetroughs. The blood flowed together in streams, but Thora knew the spell neededthe lives of at least a thousand. The tedious, gory task would take hours more,unless they could find powerful, gifted nobles to give their lives.“It’s not fast enough,” she groaned, looking up at the gray skies.Seeing the sovrena coldly kill dozens at a time, some of the volunteers in thearena quailed, grabbed their families, and pushed their way toward the upperarched entrances, trying to escape.Thora glared as she saw citizens shirking their responsibilities. “Stop them!”The panic was spreading. Many weren’t actually volunteers, merely people theguards had rounded up against their will. Thora had suspected the lists ofvolunteers would not be enough, and many who were brave on paper would renege ontheir commitment when the time came to actually pay the price. So they had to beforced. Those reluctant sacrifices sat bound and struggling at the base of thekilling sands, but they fought against the guards.In the struggle many unarmed sacrificial candidates were struck down away fromthe spell-form, where their deaths served no purpose, their blood spilleduselessly onto the sands. The cowards outnumbered the guards, who were mobbed,relieved of their swords, and killed. Swiftly, the volunteers began a massexodus.“But this is for Ildakar!” Thora cried. “If you don’t die here, then the wholecity will fall.” She wondered if the Norukai had breached the tunnels yet, or ifGeneral Utros had returned to smash the gates after Elsa’s transference magic.The people weren’t listening, though. They simply ran for their lives, takingtheir spouses, joining their friends. It had been a brave thing to do when theysigned the ledger Damon and Quentin offered, but most hadn’t believed the timewould actually come. The guards barricaded the arena entrances, fighting thosewho tried to push free. Outside in the streets, guards were indiscriminatelyrounding up anyone they could find.Such cowards didn’t deserve Ildakar. Their blood would be too weak to serve themagic. She used her knife of air again, swinging it hard, expending a great dealof magic. The blow was so sharp that she completely severed the heads ofthirteen sacrifices. They toppled, spouting jets of crimson from the stumps astheir heads rolled.Damon and Quentin kept cutting, but now their victims fought back. Hundreds wereleaving like panicked sheep. Thora knew they had killed only about half as manyas were needed to raise the shroud.“No!” She felt like weeping.Another contingent of guards raced into the arena, and Thora was relieved tohave reinforcements, but they had not come to help fight. Instead, they lookedstricken, terrified. “The Norukai are climbing the cliffs! Many have alreadypenetrated the tunnels. Soon there will be thousands within our walls.”Thora wanted to scream. “There’s not enough time!”If the shroud wasn’t raised within the next few minutes, if the protectiveinvisible walls didn’t whisk her beautiful city out of the flow of time, thenall would be lost. Her hopes were dashed.“More, kill more of them!” She struck again with her magical knife, butcheringothers who tried to flee. She had nearly exhausted herself.Damon and Quentin were frantic. They slashed throats and then simply beganstabbing victims nearby. The towering quartz prisms slowly rotated, spatteredwith blood, and hazy sunlight shone down on the curved mirrors, drawing magicand energy into the curved silver crucible from which the lines of blood magicextended.Thora howled at the evacuating crowds. “Why won’t you save Ildakar? Why won’tyou do what your city needs?” These cowards didn’t deserve her beautiful,perfect city. She hated them.All around, the air smelled of fear and the sour iron of blood mixed with thestink of death. Bodies were piled high, like a siege wall of human corpses.Thora felt despair. “Why won’t they pay the cost? There must be some way.”Damon and Quentin turned to her, exhausted, soaked with blood. She was sofurious she failed to notice the desperate gleam in their eyes. With hardenedexpressions, the two wizards approached her, holding knives in their slick redhands. “There is a way, Sovrena, and you know it yourself,” Damon said.“Everyone must pay the price,” Quentin said.“We can complete the bloodworking,” Damon added with a glance at his partner,who nodded. Both of them closed in on Thora. “And you know the magic itrequires. We have already sacrificed hundreds, and the magic is building. Itonly needs the nudge to push the bloodworking over the limit.”“It’s not enough,” Thora said, shuddering with anger and frustration. “You knowit’s not enough.”“But you can do the rest,” Quentin said. “You said it yourself. Gifted blood isso much more powerful. You are the sovrena, the most powerful sorceress inIldakar, and the blood magic is stronger in you than in hundreds of ungiftedvictims.”Damon added, coming even closer with his knife, “You can finish this. Onesacrifice. You said we must each be willing to pay the price.”Thora felt cold inside. “You are fools if you think you can do this without me.”“Not without you. We need you. We need your blood,” Damon said. His mustacheswere caked with gore that had splattered his face.Quentin tried to sound reasonable as he also closed in with his knife. “You werefound guilty and disgraced. You said you wanted to buy your way back intohistory. In this way, you can atone for everything.”Thora lashed out, calling upon her gift. She sliced through the air with anotherinvisible razor, but both Damon and Quentin raised shields and blocked her. “Youare powerful, Sovrena, but we are both wizards, and you aren’t strong enough tofight two of us.” Damon lunged with the sacrificial knife, and she drew upon allher strength to blast him backward, a fist of air mingled with threads oflightning.The blow knocked Quentin reeling, but Damon, the shaper, summoned the soft arenasand at her feet, which writhed up around her legs and waist like a smotheringblanket, trapping her. Thora flailed, glared poison at him. “Stay back!”Quentin pushed toward her. “Your blood can save the city. You know it. Don’tfight us—we have no more time.”“No!” she shouted as both wizards rushed her with upraised knives. With hergift, Thora shattered the sand that cemented her legs, but a blast from Damonknocked her backward. She collapsed into the blood-soaked sands, paralyzed asshe tried to get up.Quentin and Damon fell on her, using their gift to hold her down despite herstruggles. She was almost powerful enough to hurl them away—almost—but Damonstabbed the point of his knife into her throat, pushing hard, breaking throughher tough skin.She clawed at his hand, tried to drive the dagger away; then Quentin’s bladealso cut into her neck, sawing. Her scream was muffled, then drowned out in agush of blood—the potent, gifted blood they needed.As her vision faded, she saw the red river flowing toward the center of thesymbol. Though her rage built hotter even as her life faded away, she knew withsmug satisfaction that her powerful blood would indeed be enough. The warm sprayspilled into the channel, completing the spell-form.With her last thought, Thora felt the bright and triumphant magic surge in theair.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Damon stood exhausted. He had already seen so much blood and death today, butthis was the last. This was the most important.“Hurry!” Quentin said. He grabbed Thora by the shoulders, tilting her head,bending her limp body forward so the last of the crimson liquid gushed into thetrough. It flowed together, filling the giant pattern, and pooled like oilcrawling toward the central point.Normally, all the members of the wizards’ duma would be here. Damon had hopedthat Thora herself would guide the magic, but he and Quentin knew what wasrequired. When the blood of the powerful sorceress mingled with the othersacrifices, they called upon the magic scattered in the air, through the linesthat ran throughout the city of Ildakar.Still fleeing, many of the volunteers paused, staring up into the sky as the airshimmered. The wave of magic flowed out of the arena, rocketing upward from thecrucible and the rotating prisms. The expansive and complex spell-form glowedacross the blood-soaked sands.“The shroud!” Damon said, his voice an awed whisper.“The shroud…” Quentin repeated.The air around them changed as the entire city folded out of the flow of timeinto a protected bubble of its own, away from everyone and everything."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 83 [contents.xhtml#c_ch83]With the release of transference magic, the inferno swept toward them across thebattlefield. The thunderous explosion of heat appeared out of nowhere, andGeneral Utros threw his arm in front of his gold half mask, but the concentratedblaze was more intense even than dragon fire. Utros sucked in a breath to shouthis defiance, refusing to believe that he would lose so completely, so abruptly.Ava and Ruva flung themselves on him, wrapping around him, each holding out ahand. Their scream was a raw sound of desperation in unison. The sound rippledthe air, and their magic formed a shell of emptiness like molten glass, a curvedshield that covered them at the last instant. The bubble clamped down and sealedwith a suddenness that made the general’s ears pop, but even so, a tendril ofsuperheated air was trapped inside with them. A single gasp of breath scorchedhis mouth and lungs.Utros crouched beneath the fire that rolled as if someone had poured a crucibleof molten iron over the top of them. He fell to his knees, squeezed his eyesshut, and clenched his fists. As the heat thundered on and on, Ava and Ruvastrained next to him, weeping, their lips drawn back to expose their teeth. Theyclutched at each other as if each twin had to steal energy from her sister justto survive.He didn’t understand what had happened. When he had seen the six small groupsthat rode out from the gates, each led by a gifted wizard or sorceress, he knewthe Ildakarans had some desperate plan. Utros had stayed by his command tent,assuming this was another foolish sortie that could be easily defeated.When they saw what the Ildakaran groups were doing, though, Ava and Ruva hadgrown frightened. Ruva said, “They are laying down runes! This is part of alarger spell. Look at the positioning!”Ava pointed out the knots of fighting, then the flare signals sent into the skyfrom where the gifted raiders made their mark. “It is a spell-form of some sort!They could encircle and cut off a large part of our forces.”After the destruction caused by the Ixax warriors and the gray dragon, Utrosknew he had to stop the Ildakarans. “Keeper and spirits, come with me. We willblock that foremost group.” After he armed himself and wore his horned helmet,Utros had marched brusquely through his troops to meet the nearest strike force.He saw the wizard Nathan among them, as well as an older sorceress wearingpurple robes.Nathan and numerous fighters defended the sorceress while she marked a prominentrune on the ground. Utros had rushed toward them, but before he could get there,the older woman used her gift to blast Nathan and all the other defenders intothe air, flinging them far away and leaving her to stand alone.“What is—” Utros began to say as the sorceress completed her magic, triggeringthe spell. Transference magic.Ava and Ruva screamed and held up their hands. So much fire came out ofnowhere.…--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When the inferno finally died down, Utros pushed himself to his feet again andstared through the rippling haze of the protective shield. The air was hot andscorched inside the bubble. He desperately needed to see what remained of hiscamp, his army. “Set us free. Let me out there!”“We are not safe, beloved Utros,” Ava said. “I don’t know if anyone is leftalive in our army.”“I need to see!” he demanded. “Now.” He pressed the gold half mask against hisface.Exhausted, Ava and Ruva sagged. When they allowed their magic to dissipate, thetransparent shell flickered away, and Utros stared out upon a nightmarishlandscape so hot that the ground had turned into glass. Lumps of rock smoldered,still glowing dull orange. Smoke fouled the air like black bloodstains. Nearby,the landscape was a forest of blackened bones, curved ribs, charred skullsexploded as the brains boiled in the flash of heat.He and the twin sorceresses were the only ones alive nearby. The entire frontranks of his gigantic army had been wiped out.Utros had always segregated his thoughts, walling off emotions from logic,tactical plans from historical knowledge, but now those compartments in his mindbegan to crumble with the horror of what he saw. Staring at the vacant blackscar that had recently been crowded with loyal troops, he guessed that at leastthirty thousand men had been caught in that instantaneous funeral pyre.As he stared at the roasted world and thought of all those soldiers who hadunquestioningly followed his command, he let out a bellowing roar towardIldakar, demanding revenge.And as he watched, the city itself shimmered and disappeared before his eyes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nathan tumbled through the air, heartsick as he watched the inferno rush acrossthe battlefield, enclosed by the boundary runes the other teams had inscribed.Safe beyond the flames, he crashed onto the grass and rolled.Other Ildakaran defenders tumbled beside him: Rendell, the two morazeth, thesoldiers and arena fighters who had kept Elsa safe while she completed hermagic. Elsa had used her last energy to hurl them all to safety. Lyesse andThorn sprang to their feet and prepared to fight without even bothering to brushthemselves off. Nathan, Rendell, and the others gained their feet and preparedto face the ancient soldiers.But the outburst of fire from the transference magic was overwhelming. Nathansaw that this one blow, this one spell, had killed tens of thousands of theenemy.And one dear Elsa.In his anger at seeing the half-stone soldiers on the perimeter still movingtoward them, Nathan flung out more wizard’s fire, destroying any enemies whodared to come close. The blast gave him and his companions a moment to catchtheir breath. “We have to get back into the city,” he called in a hoarse voice.“Fall back to the gates.”They turned toward the towering city of Ildakar, their only safe haven now. Theyhad all sacrificed so much to defend it. But before they could move to rush backhome, the entire city flickered, then vanished entirely.“Dear spirits!” Nathan cried. He knew what had happened.Rendell’s jaw dropped open in disbelief. “Our city! Ildakar is gone.”The other survivors stared in dismay. “Our homes!” cried one of the city guard,who bled from a long gash down his left arm.The two morazeth were still ready to kill, but their faces were stricken. “OurIldakar…”With the shroud restored, the city and much of the uplift were simply erased.The beautiful buildings, the orchards, the layered gardens, the merchants’district, the craftsmen’s district, the warehouses … everything was gone, as ifit had simply been shaved off the plain, leaving a drop-off to the river, but nocity.Ildakar had vanished again, sealed away in time.Nathan groaned. He remembered the first time he had seen Ildakar from the highmountain pass of Kol Adair. His life book had guided him here, and he had indeedfound what he needed, the heart of a wizard—Chief Handler Ivan’s. He felt painin his chest now and knew it was in response to the shock of seeing that thecity was gone.But the same prediction in his life book had declared that the sorceress wouldsave the world. He didn’t even know where Nicci was.The “sorceress” … Had the foretelling meant Elsa?“The shroud may be permanent, or it may be temporary,” Nathan said to hisshocked companions as they picked themselves up. Standing just outside theblackened devastation, he suddenly felt vulnerable. “Either way, Ildakar willgive us no protection now. We have to get away from the battlefield, andswiftly, before Utros issues commands—if he survived. Either way, I imagine theywill want revenge.”Though his soul ached from the loss of Elsa, he knew she would have beensatisfied with what she accomplished. Her transference magic had dealt aterrible blow to the enemy army. Even now, General Utros’s forces were barelyrecovering.Nathan knew it was time to move. Now.He looked in the blackened grasses, saw the other surviving strike teams, andrealized they would be rushing for shelter, too. He drew his ornate sword andtossed his soot-smeared white hair behind him. “There may not be many of us, butwe have to find a way to fight what remains of the army.”“We cannot fight them all,” said the morazeth Thorn. “We are the only onesleft.”“Not the only ones,” Nathan said. “It is not over yet.”Still, there was no city left to fight for.Their group raced around the well-defined edge of the burn and reunited withOlgya and her surviving fighters. Their larger group kept moving westward to therugged foothills, in the direction of the mountains and Kol Adair. They alsoreunited with Perri’s contingent, as well as Leo’s, farther down the valley.When they encountered the bedraggled remnants of the group that had shot thefire arrow, Nathan learned that Julian had been killed, but not before finishingthe boundary rune.Together they continued to withdraw from the unsettled and stunned enemy army.Nathan thought the wilderness in the direction of the mountains would offer themthe best chance. Nicci was gone through the sliph, presumably far away inSerrimundi. How could she ever come back now? He doubted he would ever see heragain.And poor, dear Bannon. He had hoped to keep the young man safe in the city,which was now whisked away. Nathan gritted his teeth. In a thousand years, hehad made many bad choices, and he had to live with them all. He would find a wayto live with this one.“Come, we have to survive,” he said. The remnants of all six strike forcegroups, the outcasts of Ildakar, also raced to the hills. The reeling enemy armywas unable to count their dead, struggling to recover from what had happened.Was Utros even still alive? Nathan had seen the general and his two sorceresseswell within the boundary of the inferno, but he couldn’t be sure. If Utros wasdead, then who would lead what remained of this gigantic force? He could alwayshope the ancient army would break apart and disperse.In the foothills, the Ildakaran defenders converged, tired, frightened, andconfused. They had all seen their city vanish, and they knew they were cut offfrom their homes and families forever, stranded in the wilderness. As therefugees gathered in the hills, they came upon the fifth group of fighters, whohad drawn the last boundary rune.Nathan was surprised to see a familiar face—one he had never expected to seeagain. “Prelate Verna! Dear spirits, I cross half the world and the Sisters ofthe Light are still following me.” He had broken her jaw the last time she hadcaught up with him.Verna looked wrung out. Her face was smeared with dust and dirt, her gray-shotbrown hair a tangled mess. She had seven other Sisters with her, along withGeneral Zimmer and a small group of D’Haran soldiers. He saw the wizard Renn,who had been sent away from Ildakar, and the two young scholars, Oliver andPeretta, whom Nathan and Nicci had dispatched as messengers from Cliffwall.“What are you all doing here?”“We’re exploring the world,” Peretta said, “and committing all the details tomemory. That is our mission as scholars.”Verna said, “You and Nicci sent these two from Cliffwall and they made it toTanimura, where they told us of the great archive. General Zimmer sent anexpeditionary force to help protect that magical lore, and we met Renn. He wasleading us to Ildakar with news of Cliffwall.”“What … what happened here?” Renn combined a thousand questions into that onestatement. He nodded toward the devastated plain where smoke wafted into theair, toward the emptiness where Ildakar had been.“We will have a long time to tell stories,” Oron said in an impatient voice.“First we have to get to safety and survive.”Olgya sounded lost. “Are we all that remain of the wizards of Ildakar?”“We may still be wizards,” Renn said, “but Ildakar is gone.”From the shelter of the trees in the hills, Nathan looked back at the army farbelow and the emptiness where Ildakar had been.As he stood wiping sweat from his brow and feeling the misery in his heart, heheard a stirring in the underbrush. Beside him, Verna, Renn, and the otherrefugees turned. When a rune-branded sand panther crept out from among the scruboak and tall grasses, the Cliffwall scholars backed away in fear. General Zimmerand his soldiers warily raised their swords, preparing to fight off thepredator.Nathan felt a rush of relief, though. “It’s Mrra.” He turned to the others. “Noneed to worry. That is Nicci’s sand panther.”“Where is Nicci?” asked Rendell, sounding miserable. “She left us when we neededher most.”The big cat twitched, and her lips curled back to show curved fangs. She sniffedthe air, obviously upset with all the fire, blood, and smoke in the air, toomuch death. Nathan held up a hand, trying to calm the big cat. “Mrra, you knowme. You know our friends.”Everyone in the party remained hushed, feeling the tension. Mrra’s long tailtwitched, rustling the underbrush. Her golden eyes flashed and she turned herhead as if hearing a distant sound.“You are with us now, Mrra. Ildakar’s gone,” Nathan said, trying to soundsoothing. “I don’t know where Nicci is.”The sand panther made a low growl, then suddenly pricked up her ears. She lookedup at the sky and curled about, as if she had sensed something, a connection.With a brief roar, Mrra bounded away, running into the hills to vanish in thedeepening twilight. Nathan wondered what calling the panther had felt, but hehad no answer. He couldn’t begin to guess where Nicci might be.Nor did he know what he and his small band of surviving fighters could doagainst the gigantic ancient army."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 84 [contents.xhtml#c_ch84]After weeks of searching, Adessa finally found the wizard commander. Maxim hadbeen quiet, hiding, keeping a low profile, but the morazeth doubted he wouldgrow complacent. Neither had she.Maxim surely must know that she would continue to follow him to the end of theworld and the end of time. He was smart and powerful, but sometimes he was alsoa fool, and Adessa was no fool.Over the long and hard pursuit, she realized that what had started out as asimple hunt was much more than that. This was an actual war between her and thewizard commander, with battles, tactics, and an ultimate goal.She had lost his track for twenty days, but she kept moving down the river, surethat was where Maxim would go. In certain ways, he had little imagination, andhe had no more knowledge of the river’s geography than she had. They both knewthe Killraven eventually widened into the estuary, then spilled into the greatsea. She simply needed to find him.With such mastery of the gift, Maxim could have claimed a place to hide, evencreated a small protective shroud to hide himself from time, and if he justwaited long enough, Adessa would never track him down.But the wizard commander was arrogant and lazy. Although he had grown impatientwith Ildakar’s hedonistic extravagances, he was not a rugged man, and hepreferred his comforts. That was why Adessa knew he would find some other town,a cozy shelter where he could force someone to take care of him, as he had doneat Tarada.As she approached a river town named Gant’s Ford, she decided to inquire abouthim there. In her distinctive black leather wrap and with countless protectiverunes branded on her bare skin, Adessa would be too memorable, and she didn’twant to be recognized, didn’t want word to reach Maxim, if he was indeed here.She watched and waited, keeping to the reeds at the riverside as she observedthe traffic coming into Gant’s Ford. As dusk turned to deep purple, a lone manwearing a patched hooded cloak paddled past her in a canoe. A wicker basketfilled with crawfish was balanced in the back of the canoe.Adessa was already standing in the water, knee deep. As he approached, notseeing her in the twilight shadows, she waded out into the current and pouncedon him as he paddled by. The man yelped as if afraid she were a swamp dragonattacking him, but she was worse than a swamp dragon.Adessa dragged the man out of the canoe and into the water, wrestling him. Shepunched the nerve cluster on the back of his neck, rendering him helpless.Immobile, he looked terrified as she dragged him into the mud and reeds. There,she stripped off his hooded cloak, knowing it would be a good disguise she coulduse. She hung it on some tall reeds, then bent over him.He shivered. “Who are you? I have nothing for you to steal.”“I am not a bandit,” she said. “But I am the one who’s asking questions.”He squirmed and choked, and she was losing patience. Holding him down in thesoft mud, she removed the black handle of her agile knife and poked the sharp,stubby point into his thigh. It was a minor wound, but when she released themagic, agony careened through his body.He arched his back and cried out, but his scream was swallowed up in the palm ofher hand clamped over his mouth.She let the surge of pain continue for a moment, then yanked the agile knifeout. “I can do more of that, and I can do it all night, unless you tell me whatI need to know.”His body shuddered with sobs. Tears ran down his face. “Y-You haven’t even askedanything yet!”She described Maxim, explained that he would have been a stranger only recentlyarrived in the vicinity. The canoe man was so desperate he would have told heranything she wanted to hear, though Adessa also knew how to identify lies.Fortunately, he had indeed seen someone who might have been Maxim.“He comes into town every two days or so. He lives up in the hills. I think … Ithink the Farrier family took him in. Farrier is a woodcutter, and they have acottage, but I haven’t seen them in weeks.”She leaned closer. “What does this man do when he comes into town?”“He … he eats. He drinks ale at the tavern. He listens. He is a friendly sort,but strange, won’t tell anyone where he’s from.”Adessa imagined that Maxim was simply biding his time, building alliances andmaking plans. “This has been most helpful, but I can’t allow any word of mypresence to whisper out.”His eyes widened, and she killed him as quickly and painlessly as she could,then rolled his body into the reeds, where a swamp dragon would find him soonenough and dispose of the evidence. She made a small cook fire and ate a meal ofthe crawfish in his basket. Then she developed her plan.Disguising herself in the cloak, Adessa glided into town, listening, watchingfor Maxim to appear. While she waited in Gant’s Ford, she learned as much as shecould about his habits, the frequency of his visits. She learned the location ofthe Farriers’ stone cottage in the hills above the river, a small homesurrounded by tall spruce. She stole a long, sturdy rope that she calculated shewould need.Yes, she could have challenged the wizard commander right there in the open, butshe’d done that before and he had escaped from her each time. No, she would haveto trap him, ambush him, and kill him.As a morazeth, she preferred a straight-up, face-to-face fight against an enemy.Maxim was a powerful foe, and Adessa didn’t want to squander the powerful bloodmagic that still burned within her. She would have a final confrontation withhim, and she would use up all of that power to defeat him.But she had to be smart. Adessa did not dismiss the threat posed by the wizardcommander. Maybe she couldn’t outmatch him in a direct battle with magic, butshe could be more clever than he was.Although Maxim was in hiding, he was neither a loner nor self-sufficient, and heoften liked to sit in a tavern, complain about the local ale and the food, andplay dicing games. She learned that he was likely to come into town that eveningbecause the river inn was serving their catfish pie, one of his favorite meals.Adessa didn’t ask too many questions. She already had the answers she needed,and she already had her rope.She waited discreetly until dusk, when she saw a man come into town and headdirectly for the inn. With just a glance she knew it was Maxim, and he walkedwithout a care in the world. He worked his charm, grinning, adding a glamourspell so that people welcomed him, while she remained in the shadows.Though she wanted to lunge out and kill him there, Adessa controlled herself,knowing that would likely fail. Instead, she knew Maxim would be in town forseveral hours drinking his fill of ale, and she would use that to her advantage.She had just enough time to make her preparations.In the gathering dark, Adessa slipped away from Gant’s Ford and into the hills,following the dirt path. Knowing where Maxim lived, she approached the dark andempty cottage that a woodcutter had built for his wife and three children. Shefound the whole family as statues in the yard, petrified in the act of fleeing.Adessa stared at them, reaffirmed in her determination to complete her mission.Thora had ordered her to kill the wizard commander, and she would take his headbefore the night was over.She might have waited until Maxim was asleep, then broken into his home andfought him with all her strength, but that would have been messy and uncertain.She didn’t doubt he would have left wards all around the cottage. He would knowif she was coming. No, she had to be more devious than that.Moving swiftly, Adessa carried her rope and circled the cottage, through thespruce forest, searching for what she needed. To one side, she found a largeheavy log that had toppled to the ground, which the woodcutter hadn’t yetchopped into firewood. Augmented by her blood magic and the rope, Adessa hadenough strength to lift it into place, planning ahead.When she had completed her preparations, Adessa discarded the stolen cloak shehad used as her disguise and stood to fight in only her morazeth leather. Whenshe faced Maxim, she wanted him to recognize her before she killed him. Shetucked her dagger and short sword into her waistband. She would not need them,or the agile knife. In the darkness, the wind continued to stir the spruces,some of which creaked more loudly than others, as if groaning in pain.She waited in the forest shadows for hours, until Maxim at last strolled back upthe path, well satiated from his catfish pie and a tankard or two of ale. Hewhistled to himself, oblivious to any danger. Using his gift from a distance, heignited the lamps inside the cottage, and light shone through the windows. Hestrolled up to the cottage.Adessa stepped out of the shadows, placing herself in exactly the rightposition. The dark spruces were dense and close, swaying back and forth. Maximstumbled to a halt, staring at her. “You are damned persistent.”“I made a promise to kill you.”She felt a rippling defensive shield he manifested in front of him, but themarkings on her skin protected her against any magic he tried to use againsther.“This is Thora’s doing, isn’t it? Do you know if she is even still the sovrena?”He sniffed. “By now, I suspect that Ildakar has fallen, one way or another.” Hequirked a smile. “I ended the petrification spell and freed the army of GeneralUtros. And I saw an entire Norukai invasion fleet sailing up the river. Maybeyou should have stayed to fight for the city instead of chasing me through theswamps?” He raised his eyebrows.“I keep my promises.” She braced herself. The wind grew louder, the trees rushedand creaked.“This is tedious,” Maxim said. “I do not fault your determination, but yourpower is no match for mine.”“I trust in what I can do,” Adessa said. Leaving the short sword in its sheathat her side, she drew her dagger. “This knife is all I need to kill you.”He had a maddening smile. “And how do you expect to accomplish that?”Although wizards had powerful magic and numerous defenses, they could be killedin a normal manner, so long as they were taken by surprise. Adessa had the mosttremendous surprise.Raising the dagger, she kept her gaze locked on Maxim’s, and flung the blade tothe side with perfect aim. The sharp knife sliced through the rope she had usedto tie down one of the tall, supple spruce trees. Using her strength and theblood magic within her, she had bent and anchored the trees, and then fastenedthe heavy log, which hung on a cradle of the rope, dangling like a batteringram. The trees trembled like a strung bow, straining to be loosed, and Adessa’sthrown knife cut the rope.The coiled energy within the bent spruces suddenly released, and the suppletrees surged upward and released the suspended dead log. Maxim had just enoughtime to turn and see the log hurtling toward him like a ram powerful enough tosmash the gates of Ildakar. He heard the thrash of pine boughs, the creak ofropes, the groan of wood. He had only an instant to raise a shield before thelog slammed into his chest with such force it shattered his torso.As the log swung back into its relaxed position on the ropes, Maxim lay sprawledon the ground in a pool of blood, his face filled with astonishment. His chestwas crushed, his ribs were splintered like a thistle, but he was still alive,spasming, choking. Even with his great magic, though, the wizard commandercouldn’t heal himself from this.Adessa loomed over him and slid her short sword out of its scabbard. “SovrenaThora commanded me to bring back your head, and it gives me great pleasure to doso.”She touched her flat stomach, thought of the child that was no longer there,felt the shadow of Ian’s presence in her, and she convinced herself that thesacrifice had been acceptable. She’d had enough power to kill the wizardcommander. Only that mattered.Maxim lay gurgling, coughing blood. “I am a wizard … cannot kill me so …easily.”“It was not easy, but I will kill you,” Adessa said.His fingers curled, and light flickered in his hand as he tried to summon scrapsof magic, but his chest was shattered, his life fading away. She had to hurry.“Oh no, Maxim, I am not going to let you simply die. I have to be the one tokill you.”He groaned, tried to form words: “I will still … be…”She hacked down on his neck, cutting through the muscles and neck bone, untilshe lifted his dripping head by the beautiful dark hair. When she killed Maxim,a rushing glow flowed out of his body and whipped through the now-still spruces.She felt a shudder in the magic as if some last threads of an ancient spell werefinally severed, although nothing touched her rune-protected body.Maxim was hers. She stared at his slack face, his dull and open eyes. She woulddeliver the trophy back to Ildakar, back to Thora. It would be a long, hardjourney home, but with the wizard commander’s head, Adessa would have all thecompanionship she needed."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 85 [contents.xhtml#c_ch85]Even after the conflagration burned the front ranks of his army, General Utroswas not willing to admit defeat. But with Ildakar entirely gone, he no longerhad a city to conquer. Despite his losses, he still had more than a hundredthousand brave fighters. They stood on an empty, burned plain without an enemyto face.He stared at the remnants of his stunned army and knew that he needed to givethem a new goal, another reason to exist. His separate expeditionary armies werealready on the march to find other lands to conquer. Utros had hoped to usethose victories to get back into Kurgan’s good graces, yet he had less and lessrespect for the man to whom he had sworn his loyalty and his life.Loyalty is greater than love. Was that even true anymore? Majel, his love, hadbeen destroyed, and his loyalty toward her murderer was frayed and full ofquestions.Utros returned to his makeshift command tent beyond the fringe of the greatfire, where the tall oval lens to the underworld stood out in the open. Ava andRuva were with him, determined to support him, whatever he should decide to do.First Commander Enoch had also miraculously survived, much to Utros’s relief,but he would never know the names of all the dead. A good commander owed thatmuch to his fallen soldiers, but there were too many. Far too many.The first commander sat on his warhorse, bowing to Utros. “The soldiers awaityour orders, General. They will follow you wherever you may lead.”Utros stared across the empty plain, still unable to believe that the city hadsimply vanished. Without Ildakar, the orders Iron Fang had given him were nolonger valid, though in truth the emperor had never understood the situation onthe ground, had never grasped his own empire. Iron Fang knew how to make peoplefear him, but he didn’t know how to rule. He was a pompous, self-absorbed manwho achieved power only through others, like Utros.The general didn’t know how he had been so blind before. No wonder Majel hadsought love in someone else’s arms. If it hadn’t been Utros, would it have beenanother man? She had been so beautiful, so perfect, yet even after Kurgan hadinflicted his horrific punishment upon her, she had gone back to him. Utroscouldn’t understand it, nor did he need to. His duty was to his hundreds ofthousands of soldiers. He was their leader, their general, not some spirit thatspoke only through a bloodstained lens.Utros stopped in front of the scorched but still functional lens to theunderworld. At his command, the sorceresses activated the glowing runes, and thegreenish mists cleared, letting him see through to the realm of the spirits.Utros stood bravely before the glass, staring at the ravaged landscape of thedead, which looked all too similar to the blasted landscape of his own camp.Emperor Kurgan appeared before him again, grinning to show his hooked irontooth. Majel was beside him, her face a raw mask. Her brown, lidless eyes staredat Utros, but now he saw her more clearly. No love remained there for him.“You summoned me again, Utros,” Kurgan said. “If you have finally conqueredIldakar, then I am ready to issue my first orders. Execute all those who defiedme, and when they come here to the underworld, we will punish them further.” Heseemed to relish the idea.“Ildakar is gone,” Utros said. “Vanished.”“Gone?” Kurgan was taken aback. “How do you lose a city?”“How do you lose an empire?” Utros retorted, allowing the harsh tone to eraseall the awe and respect he had once held for this man. “How do you lose yourwife, the most beautiful woman in the world? How do you squander all the lands Iconquered for you, while I continue to fight for your foolishness?”Kurgan was outraged. “I forbid you to speak to me like that. I am your emperor.”“You are dead. You are no longer my emperor, and I no longer follow your orders.Neither loyalty nor love is strong enough. I am strong. I have my army, and Iwill conquer the Old World for myself. My soldiers are loyal to me, and we willcreate a new empire, a worthy empire. You corrupted everything you touched.” Helowered his voice as the emperor snarled, unable to form words. Utros shiftedhis gaze and spoke to the other image inside the lens. “Majel, I did love you,but our love was doomed from the start. I should have been wise enough to knowthat. Maybe I could have saved you, but I will not mourn for what happenedfifteen centuries in the past. Instead, I will make my own future without you.”He turned back to Kurgan. “And without you, Iron Fang.”Leaving the emperor fuming behind the veil to the underworld, General Utrosstepped back from the lens. He picked up a heavy war hammer he had taken fromone of his soldiers, a weapon that felt solid in his hand, real and heavy anddeadly. With a cry that encompassed all his rage and despair, Utros swung theweapon and smashed the center of the blood lens.Golden magic crackled and flared around the fissures that shot through theglass. The central impact left a white crater, and the cracks spread, branchingout toward the edge. He heard a final echoing howl of Iron Fang’s rage beforethe blood lens shattered, crumbling into chunks of glass that fell in a pile onthe scorched ground.Ava and Ruva smiled at him with satisfaction and relief. First Commander Enochpressed a fist to his heart in a salute and then shouted, “For General Utros!”The twin sorceresses took up the cheer, as did thousands of voices from hisarmy.Suddenly, unrelated to the shattering of the lens, Utros felt a strange forcevibrate through the air like a magical lightning storm, a distant shock wavethat rang through the fabric of the world. He instinctively clutched his chest,and his half-stone skin crawled.Ava and Ruva stared at each other, then spun to him for answers. First CommanderEnoch grasped his arm, touched his face, grimaced. The soldiers began to mutter.Some cried out, staring at their hands, bending their waists, flexing theirarms.Utros felt a shudder, and his skin tingled, warmed. The feeling was similar towhat he remembered when he had reawakened from the nothingness of stone. But nowhe felt restored, even more human. The stiff petrification faded away.His skin softened. His muscles loosened. With a sigh, he felt the dust go out ofhis lungs. He reached up to touch the gold half mask on his face, then ran hisfingers over his other cheek. His beard was softer than before, silky. He lookedat Ava and Ruva and saw that their pale, chalky skin had become warm flesh oncemore.“The stone is gone from us!” Ruva said, holding up her delicate hand.The twins touched each other, stroked their skin, caressed their faces. Avasaid, “The spell is broken. Completely.”Utros listened to the rising murmur of wonderment throughout the camp. Onesoldier leaped into the air and kicked his legs in joy. “We are human again!”Whatever wizard had created the ancient petrification spell centuries ago wasgone now, likely dead. There were no lingering remnants of the spell. They werefree again, completely free.Utros raised his hand, clenched his fingers into a fist. “We’re alive!” Aresounding roar rippled across the hundreds of thousands of armed men camped onthe burned plain.The general allowed himself a moment of satisfaction and tried not to let themsee the deep concern on his face. They would realize it themselves soon enough,and come to the same conclusion.More than a hundred thousand warriors were camped in the middle of a vast,burned plain, far from the nearest city. They had no supplies at all, no Ildakarto defeat, and all those mouths to feed.With gnawing dread, General Utros realized that he was hungry."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 86 [contents.xhtml#c_ch86]The Norukai raiders caused tremendous damage to Serrimundi. Even though thepeople had succeeded in defeating the serpent ships, Nicci wished she could haveprepared them better. But there had been no time.Peace and prosperity left entire cities vulnerable because they let down theirguard, but Nicci never underestimated the potential for hatred and evil in theworld, since she herself had caused so much harm.When she had left the People’s Palace on her mission with Nathan, Nicci had beenconvinced that Richard’s heartfelt code of freedom and independence throughoutthe D’Haran Empire would bring a true change for the world. But in her travelsit had not taken long for her to see that the world was still a dangerous place.She and Nathan had encountered many worthy men and women who would fight forwhat was right, hardworking farmers and craftsmen, even warriors who wanted agood life and a better world. But there were also many enemies, and it wasNicci’s job to fight them, to make a safe haven for those good people, andsmother the ambitions of would-be conquerors, like the Norukai.King Grieve’s large invasion fleet was out there, supposedly attacking Ildakar.Captain Kor had revealed the grandiose plans of the Norukai, and now Nicci knewshe had another great enemy in addition to the threat of General Utros and hishalf-stone army.Harborlord Otto and Captain Ganley had brought the damaged Mist Maiden back tothe wharf, where final mopping-up operations were under way. Thousands ofevacuated Serrimundi citizens returned from the hills and helped extinguish thedockside fires. The emboldened citizens also stood against the last of theraiders. The stranded Norukai showed little concern for their own lives andsimply kept fighting until they were brought down by archers launching volleyafter volley of arrows.Aboard the bloodstained decks of the Mist Maiden, angry and shaken crew membersheaved Norukai corpses overboard into the harbor for the fish to feast on. Thebodies of their own dead crew members, though, were lined up with greatreverence, their arms and legs straightened, their faces smoothed, as theharborlord intoned the blessings of the Sea Mother upon them.Nicci stood at the prow of the ship, covered with blood, her blond hair cakedwith red. She faced Harborlord Otto as the Mist Maiden tied up to the damageddocks and shouting people raced along the harbor’s edge. Captain Ganley waved ashe saw his betrothed running toward him, laughing with relief. The harborlordlooked as if he might burst into tears at seeing his daughter.When they disembarked to a triumphant crowd of merchants and dockworkers, Nicciraised her voice. “I came here to warn you of an enemy threat, but the threat iseven greater than I imagined. I hope you believe my warning now.” She gesturedout to the harbor to indicate the burning ships, the bodies of the Norukai, andthe Serrimundi dead that crew members solemnly carried off the decks of thereturning ships. “Prepare yourselves for worse. It is not over.”“Didn’t we defeat them?” asked a gruff and lanky man in stained captain’sclothes. His face looked similar to Harborlord Otto’s.“This was just a raiding expedition, ten serpent ships,” Nicci said. “TheNorukai have an empire, which has decided to go to war.”Otto said, “This is my brother, Jared. He captains a kraken-hunting ship, likethe one that burned at the mouth of the harbor.”Jared scratched the back of his head. “We know how to kill tentacled monsters inthe open sea, but we don’t usually worry about pirates. No one comes close to akrakener.”“Maybe it’s the smell…” Otto joked.“The Norukai will burn any ship they find,” Nicci said.Jared shook his head. “They are not going to burn mine. From now on, all of mycrew will be armed. The Norukai are just a different sort of monster to kill.”“Every ship must be prepared to fight,” Nicci told the harborlord. “Spread thenews throughout the harbor and to all the outbound ships so they can carry theword as well. Other towns have been preyed upon by the Norukai. Open trade willno longer keep you safe. Even if you have a strong city, someone will want totake it.“I have already delivered a warning to Tanimura and asked Lord Rahl for hishelp. An entire D’Haran expeditionary force will be ready to march, butSerrimundi and all the cities along the coast will have to help themselves. TheNorukai may have already struck several targets. Send messengers far and wide,even to the cities inland, because the armies of General Utros might be comingas well. Be watchful and ready. Build up your defenses.”The people made promises. She could tell they wanted to be reassured that allwould be well. Nicci couldn’t afford to let them grow complacent again. Sheunwrapped the pane of glass she had carried with her. “This is another enemythat awaits you, a vast army awakened from fifteen centuries ago. They have laidsiege to Ildakar and already sent out satellite armies to ravage and pillage.They will conquer the lands in the mountains, then make their way to the coast.”She needed to return to Ildakar if the Norukai were attacking, as Kor hadboasted. She had to let the people of Serrimundi build up their own defenseswithout her. “I might not come back here for some time, so I leave the task toyou. Rally the Old World.”She turned slowly, showing them Elsa’s pane of glass, in which the image ofUtros’s army had been imprinted. “This is proof of the enemy that is coming foryou. Show everyone.” She intentionally dropped the pane onto the hard boards ofthe pier, and when it struck, the glass broke into eight uneven pieces. Each ofthe shards contained an identical image. She picked up one of the fragments andhanded it to Harborlord Otto, handed a second one to the kraken hunter Jared,then distributed the remaining pieces among those who might spread the word.“It is up to you now,” Nicci said. “I have to go back to Ildakar. You must allunite as part of the D’Haran Empire. Fight for your lives and your freedom.”Seeing the look in their eyes, she knew she had gotten through to them. Theywould do as she asked. Nicci felt confident as she left the harbor and made herway back into the hills, where she would find the ancient temple of the SeaMother and the sliph well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------At twilight, the temple was silent and peaceful, abandoned. After the Norukaiattack on the harbor, the people of Serrimundi were picking up the pieces andputting out the last fires. There were hundreds of wounded to be tended. Niccicould have used healing magic to help them, but Serrimundi had many doctors andgifted healers. She was no longer needed here.If the Norukai were attacking Ildakar, she was certainly needed there.“Sliph, I want to travel. Now.” Nicci was sore, weary, and worried for herfriends. She stood at the edge of the well and waited.The shrubs and vines rustled in the evening breezes, and she smelled the gentlescent of blooming nightshade, but she heard nothing from the bottomless well.“Sliph, come!” She pushed out with her gift, felt along the threads of magic,the throbbing power deep within the well.Somewhere infinitely far away, the intractable quicksilver began to move,roiling up the passage. Nicci was impatient, concerned about what might behappening in Ildakar right now. She had left Nathan and the duma memberssearching for a way to fight General Utros. How could they possibly battle KingGrieve as well as a full Norukai invasion at the same time?She shouted into the well. “Sliph, I require your services. I need to travel!”Finally, the quicksilver surged to the top, like metallic acid boiling in acauldron. The sliph’s face looked angry. “I serve the cause. I do not serveyou.”Nicci retorted, “You were created to transport travelers, and I need to travel.”She had no time to cajole the sliph. Lucy, the sliph that Richard commanded inStroyza, had also been moody and petulant, but in the end Lucy had done as shewas told. Nicci put one foot on the edge of the well. “Carry me back toIldakar.”“How will that serve Sulachan?” the sliph demanded.“Sulachan is gone,” Nicci snapped. “We fight a different battle now. The causehas changed.”The sliph recoiled at the revelation, and Nicci reached out with her gift, usingSubtractive as well as Additive Magic. The sliph required both, and now Nicciproved that she was strong, her new master. “Take me to Ildakar.”The sliph looked devastated. Her face distorted as the quicksilver re-formeditself. “Sulachan…”Nicci released more of her gift, hammering hard to assert her dominance over thesliph. “Take me to Ildakar. I command it.”“Ildakar!” The sliph lunged forward like an attacking wave of molten silver.“Breathe!” she commanded, then engulfed Nicci and pulled her down into abottomless cold pit.…"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 87 [contents.xhtml#c_ch87]As the river thawed again and great chunks of ice drifted apart, the numerousserpent ships broke free, caught in the current, their hulls cracked. Driftingin the slush-choked water were hundreds of dead Norukai men and women who hadtumbled from the bluffs or been killed by the defenders of Ildakar.Bound and bloody, his body bruised from the fall and his head still ringing froma cracked skull, Bannon couldn’t break free from the hideous raiders. Stunned,he couldn’t think straight, but he knew where he was.The young man had fought with every ounce of energy, fully expecting to die, andwhen he had tumbled from the platform to crash among the bodies below, he hadnever expected to awaken. Though he could feel several cracked ribs and bloodrunning down the side of his face, Bannon was worse than dead. He was a prisonerof the hated Norukai! His captors dragged him along with dozens of otherIldakaran prisoners toward the crowded serpent ships in the river. Some of thecaptives were unconscious, some sobbing, and only a few made halfhearted effortsto escape, which were severely beaten back.Bannon couldn’t make sense of what he was seeing. From the river, he looked upthe bluff where he should have seen the towering city above.Ildakar was gone. Gone!The entire city had simply been erased, as if the top of the plateau had beenshaved off, leaving the lower portion of the bluff intact but the upper levelssheared away.Though Bannon’s thoughts were scrambled, he recalled the first time he, Nathan,and Nicci had approached Ildakar. They had seen only an empty plain, because thecity was hidden beneath the shroud of eternity, a bubble that erased it fromtime. Had the wizards done the same thing again, whisking Ildakar away andleaving anyone outside to fend for themselves?What about Nathan and Elsa and the raiding party out in the plain? What aboutthe rest of the people of Ildakar? And where was Lila?The defenders in the tunnels beneath the bluff had been abandoned, left behindto face the Norukai, who were even now ransacking the tunnels, dragging outprisoners and slaying any who resisted.Ildakar was gone. Bannon was on his own.As his captors shoved him across a wooden plank and onto the deck of a serpentship, Bannon relived a horrifying nightmare from his childhood, when the scarredraiders had come to Chiriya Island, clubbed him and captured him in an isolatedcove. Now, all these years later, Bannon was in the clutches of the samemonsters again.King Grieve and Chalk had also survived the fall, and that only increasedBannon’s despair. Now, as they stood among the surviving raiders, Grievebellowed to his countless fighters, “Search every tunnel. Find what is up there.Climb the cliff and reach the top of the plain.”The albino shaman laced his knobby fingers together. “Yes, the plain and thewhole world! Out there is our destiny, my Grieve, King Grieve. They’ll allgrieve!”The Norukai king snorted. “I don’t know how much to believe you anymore, Chalk.Your visions are flawed.”“No, my Grieve! I saw the battle. I saw cold, snow, and ice. Remember? Remember,my Grieve? Cold, ice, cold!” He gestured to the thawing river, the ice chunkssliding down the bluff wall. “Ildakar did not win, and you have what is left.It’s yours, my king, my Grieve. Ildakar is gone! I said so!”“That is not what I expected.”“Never what you expect,” the shaman said. “But I know it’s true in the end. Goto the plain, and you will see how to take over the whole world.”Bannon struggled against his bonds. “You’ll fail.” His voice was a harsh croak.“The Old World will rally against you, and Lord Rahl has the entire D’Haran armyto defeat you.”Grieve smashed the side of Bannon’s head with his iron-plated knuckles. Theyoung man collapsed, barely keeping a thread of consciousness. He fell backwardonto the icy, blood-slick deck. He blinked, trying to look up and down theriver, disoriented.He could make out the Norukai ships and the countless raiders swarming into thetunnels, to climb up where the city had vanished. He saw the crumbling rocks,the river, and thick brush along the banks. At the edge of his vision, hethought he caught a glimpse of a slender woman wearing only black leatherwrappings. Lila? Before he could focus, she darted into the shadows, hidingamong the low trees.Grieve said, “If we are going to take over the world, we will need many morecaptives, slaves, workers.” With his broad chin he gestured toward the boats ashe shouted orders to the other Norukai. “For now, kill as few as you have to. Weneed to launch a hundred more raids to fill our ranks and take captives, thoughI expect we’ll have to kill quite a few just to make our message clear.”Bannon struggled as they dragged him among the shuddering captives. Ignoring himfor now, the Norukai king gestured toward the bluff. “Let us make our way upthrough the tunnels, Chalk. I want to see what awaits us on the plain.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When she emerged after the timeless journey, Nicci spilled out of the well as ifthrown in disgust. She crashed to the ground and rolled, gasping in air andtrying to expel the intangible essence of the sliph. Something was wrong. Shefelt weakened and strange, and her ears rang.Rather than finding herself in a dank, stone-walled enclosure in Ildakar, Nicciwas in the open, late at night, sprawled on broken flagstones. Around her, shesaw fallen stone pillars the size of massive oak trees. Great slabs of marblelay tilted at various angles, as if the ancient city had been shaken apart. Onthe far side of the plaza, a statue of a man as large as a dragon lay toppled,the colossus shattered into pieces.From behind high patchy clouds, the moon shone down to illuminate the ruins of avast city where grand towers had crumbled into rubble and majestic archways wereovergrown with vines and moss. The jagged silhouettes of nearby mountain peakshovered behind the haunted, silent buildings. Other than the stars, the onlylights she saw were tiny fireflies swirling about like intermittent meteors.She saw no campfires, no lamps in windows of the dwellings, no sign of lifewhatsoever in the extensive ruins. She turned back to the sliph, who hovered inthe round enclosure. “Where am I? This isn’t Ildakar.” She felt suddenly dizzy,nauseated. “What have you done to me?”Like an angry spirit, the sliph loomed out of her well. Her quicksilver formshifted and melted, as if she had trouble maintaining her shape. “Ildakar nolonger exists. I cannot take you there. I tried, but I … ricocheted. The city isgone.”“What do you mean it’s gone?” Nicci stepped back toward the well. “We came fromthere. I need to travel. Take me to Ildakar.”“I refuse. Ildakar is gone.” Her expression roiled with anger. “And I am notyour slave. If Sulachan is dead, then the cause is lost. I have no purpose. Youhave deceived me, and I will not help you.”Nicci realized how lost she was. She could be stranded, and this creature washer only connection, her only way of getting back. “No, sliph! If you can’t takeme to Ildakar, then return me to Serrimundi.” She looked around at the abandonedmetropolis. “Do not leave me here.”“You will never travel in me again.” The sliph’s voice held a dangerousfinality. “I must recover.”Nicci rushed to the edge of the well, but it was too late. The sliph vanished,plunging back down into the bottomless well with a rushing, fading sound.Nicci stood silent, all alone in the empty wreck of an ancient city, completelycut off from her friends and everything she knew.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Utros’s returning scouts rode back at a fast gallop from the empty site ofIldakar, where the bluffs dropped off to the river. The first man had anunexpectedly alarmed expression on his face. “General! Warriors are climbing upfrom the Killraven and emerging onto the plain. Thousands of them!”“They are armed and furious,” said a second man, his skin warm and flushed.“Uglier than any humans I have ever seen.”First Commander Enoch stepped forward. “Another army? Where did they come from?Do they mean to fight us?”Utros stared toward the river, where he saw the unruly lines of figures movingtoward them. Even though his army was shocked and damaged after the inferno,they clearly outnumbered any possible enemy force. And yet the other warriorskept coming over the top of the cliff. Utros gritted his teeth and nodded toEnoch. “First Commander, go meet them with a party of armed soldiers. Find outwho they are. I will want to speak with their leader.”With a brisk nod, the hardened veteran gathered fifty men and rode off to theraiders coming up from the river.Utros ignored the unfamiliar pangs of hunger in his stomach. He remembered whenhe had tried to eat the roasted yaxen shortly after awakening, and he hadvomited up the meat. Now, his stomach wanted food. All of his soldiers wouldfeel the same way.Before long, the first commander returned leading ten hideous warriors withscarred faces. One man, larger and more powerful than the rest of them, had bonyspikes implanted in his shoulders and iron plates on his knuckles. He wasaccompanied by a pale man whose skin was covered with a forest of scars.“We are the Norukai, and I am King Grieve,” said the large man, striding forwardto face Utros. “What have you done to Ildakar?”Utros gestured to his surviving soldiers that spilled across the plain, restlessin their makeshift camp. “We laid siege to the city. My army has been waitinghere for fifteen centuries to bring it down.”Grieve interrupted with a loud laugh. “The statue army! Yes, my spies told meabout the stone warriors. But you are awake now.”The general didn’t flinch, showed no weakness. “We have been fighting to breakdown the city walls, but Ildakar just vanished before our eyes. I do not knowwhat happened.”Grieve grumbled. “Yes, the city has done that before. Maybe Ildakar will return,maybe it won’t. But I have all my Norukai navy, and my warriors need to fight.”He leaned closer. “Maybe we should attack your army.”“Only if you wish to die,” Utros said. “Do you not see the numbers of my troops?What would be the point? Do you think war is nothing more than a sport?”Grieve shrugged. “Sometimes.”Ava and Ruva came close, their eyes bright, and he knew they were ready toattack with magic. The twins stared curiously at the scarred albino shaman.The two men were both massive, and if Utros had still been hardened from thelingering effects of the stone spell, he could have crushed the king. But now hewas flesh and blood again, with all the inherent weaknesses of a mere human. Ashe faced the Norukai king, Utros was both offended and fascinated by thescarification, the slashed mouth, the implanted bone spines, the tattoos on hisskin. Even more hideous was the shaman whose skin was covered with bite marks.“Destiny,” said the albino. “Destiny, my Grieve, King Grieve! There will be war,a big war.” He jabbed a finger at Utros. “But not with him.”The Norukai leader’s expression showed a reckless challenge, but Utros remainedcalm. They had both attacked Ildakar, but from different sides.“We have the same enemy,” Utros said. “I assume you had your reasons to attackthe city.”Grieve said, “To conquer it.”Utros saw thousands more Norukai ascending from the river below, and his scoutshad reported numerous warships on the water. “Ildakar is no longer there. Areyou going to make yourself my enemy? You and all your fighters?” He kept hisvoice calm and gestured to the countless ranks across the scorched and damagedfield. “My army can easily defeat yours. It makes no sense for you to fight us.”“The Norukai always fight,” Grieve said. “We raid, we pillage, we conquer.”“Admirable goals,” Utros said, “so long as you choose the right target. And theright ally.”The shaman came close, curious to look at the twin sorceresses. He sniffed andshifted his gaze back and forth from Ava to Ruva. “Magic,” he said. “Powerfulmagic! But they don’t see what I see, my Grieve. I see a huge army! I seeNorukai ships. I see Utros and his soldiers.” He grinned. “I see a powerfulforce to sweep across the whole land.”General Utros was curious. “I once served Emperor Kurgan. Now I serve my owngoals. I have no emperor.”“I am king,” Grieve said. “King of the Norukai.”“You may be king of the Norukai, but I am general of my troops. The Old World isvast. How can you help me conquer it?”Offended, Grieve puffed himself up as if ready to attack Utros. Ava and Ruvacoiled, prepared to unleash their magic. With a single bolt of lightning, theycould turn King Grieve into a smear of ash.But the albino shaman jumped between them, frantically waving his hands. “Thisis what I saw, my Grieve, King Grieve! Allies. You and General Utros, a giantarmy! A great war.”“I have hundreds of ships,” Grieve boasted. “Many down on the river, othersraiding the coast, and more being built among our islands. It is a navy unlikeany that history has ever seen.”“They’ll all grieve!” the shaman cried.Utros pondered how many soldiers he had just lost, and his new determinationafter forsaking his loyalty to Emperor Kurgan. He said in a calculating voice,“I have my army, but to overwhelm the entire land, a navy would be useful aswell, and many more fighters. If your Norukai can fight.”Grieve spat on the ground, as if the answer were disgustingly obvious. The kingdescribed his great war fleet and his countless raiders, ruthless Norukai menand women, and powerful serpent ships. He told of the numerous Norukai islandsfilled with warriors who had not yet set off in battle, but were restless andeager to launch their own attacks. A war, a full war, to conquer the entire OldWorld.Utros decided that, given time, he could wipe out these Norukai, if necessary,but for now he did not need another war for his displaced troops. Perhaps thesewarriors would be useful.“Together, our armies can conquer the world,” Grieve said. “If we fighttogether.”“They’ll all grieve!” the shaman repeated.Ava and Ruva leaned closer, whispering in eerie unison, “With a whole continentto conquer, beloved Utros, surely there is enough to carve out two empires.”He considered, then spoke to the Norukai leader. “With your ships and yourraiders, and all my soldiers, we could overwhelm the land. King Grieve andGeneral Utros.”The Norukai king opened his exaggerated mouth and clacked his teeth together. “Iagree.”Smiling with satisfaction, Utros reached out to clasp Grieve’s massive hand."},{"pageContent":" ALSO BY TERRY GOODKIND[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Wizard’s First Rule[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312857059?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Stone of Tears[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812548099?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Blood of the Fold[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551471?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Temple of the Winds[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551488?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Soul of the Fire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551495?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Faith of the Fallen[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984485?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]The Pillars of Creation[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429934893?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Naked Empire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984577?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Debt of Bones[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765351548?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Chainfire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984409?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Phantom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429985093?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429924719?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]The Law of NinesThe Omen Machine[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429965019?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]The First Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890817?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]The Third Kingdom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466826274?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Severed Souls[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429948449?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Warheart[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890404?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]NestGirl in the MoonDeath’s Mistress[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765388223?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]Shroud of Eternity[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765388261?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]"},{"pageContent":" ABOUT THE AUTHOR [contents.xhtml#c_ata][../images/author-photo.jpg]Terry Goodkind[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9781250194787]is a #1 New York Times bestselling author.
