The woman’s intent expression drew heavycreases across her broad, flat brow.“What are you talking about, Tilly?”The woman’s faded blue eyes turned to check the shadowed corners of the gloomyroom. “Down in the lower reaches of the Keep, where those with exceptionaltalents go about their dark work, it is said that there be gifted among them whocan speak with souls beyond the veil of life, those souls now in the world ofthe dead.”Magda placed her trembling fingers on the creases in her own brow. “Tilly, youshould know better than to believe such gossip.”Tilly’s gaze again lifted to search the somber room lit only by thin streamersof light coming in the slits between the ill-fitting, warped shutters. Thenarrow slices of light revealed specks of dust floating almost motionless abovethe heavy wooden worktable set hard up against the stone wall.The table bore the age-softened evidence of dark stains, cuts, and scarscollected over centuries of varied use. The edges of the thick top had beenirregularly rounded over and worn smooth by the touch of countless hands thathad over the passage of time given the wood a polished, chestnut-colored patina.Sitting at the table, facing the shuttered windows, Magda stared down intomemories held in a small silver box sitting alone before her as she thought ofall that was lost to her.Everything was lost to her.“Not mere gossip,” Tilly said softly, compassionately. “A friend I trust worksin the nether reaches of the Keep. She knows things, sees things. She says thatsome of those whose work it is to know about the world of the dead have notmerely spoken to those passed on, but have done more.”“More?” Magda couldn’t bring herself to look up from the memories in the box.“What are you saying?”“My friend says that the gifted down there may even have ways to bring peopleback from the world of the dead. What I’m saying is that maybe you could havehim brought back.”Elbows on the table, Magda pressed her fingertips to her temples as shestruggled to keep the tears from springing anew. She stared down at a driedflower he had once given her, a rare white flower he had climbed all day toretrieve. He had called her his young, fierce flower and said that only such arare and beautiful thing befit her.So why would he choose to abandon her in this way?“Brought back? From the dead?” Magda slowly shook her head as she sighed. “Dearspirits, Tilly, what has gotten into you?”The woman set down her wooden pail and let the washrag she was holding slip intothe soapy water. She leaned down a bit more, as if to make sure that no onecould hear, even though there was no one else in the cluttered, rarely usedstorage room.“You have been kind to me, Mistress,” Tilly said as she laid a gentle,wash-wrinkled hand on Magda’s shoulder. “More kind than most folk, even when youhad no need to be. Most ignore me as I go about my work. Even though I’ve workedhere most of my life, many don’t even know my name. Only you have ever askedafter me, or offered me a smile, or a bite to eat on occasion when I was lookinghaggard. You, of all people.”Magda patted the warm, comforting hand on her shoulder. “You’re a good woman,Tilly. Most people don’t see the simple truth in front of them. I have offeredyou nothing more than common decency.”Tilly nodded. “Common decency is what most of your standing would offer only awoman born noble.”Magda smiled distantly. “We are all noble, Tilly. Every life is . . .”Magda had to swallow, fearing that another word would put her over the edge.“Precious,” Tilly finished for her.Magda managed a smile for the woman. “Precious,” she agreed at last. “Maybe Isee things differently because I wasn’t born noble.” She cleared her throat.“But when a life is over, it is over. That is the way of life. We all are born,we live, we die. There is no coming back from beyond the veil.”Magda considered her own words and realized that they weren’t entirely accurate.It occurred to her for the first time that it might have been that he hadbrought death back with him, that even though he had succeeded in returning fromhis perilous journey to the world of the dead, perhaps he had never reallyescaped its grasp. Perhaps he couldn’t.Tilly fussed with the end of her apron strings as she mulled something over fora moment.“I don’t wish to upset you, Mistress,” she said at last. “It is only because youhave been kind to me and always treated me with respect, that I would tell youthat which I would dare not speak of to another. But only if you wish to hearit. If you don’t, you have but to say the word and I will never again speak ofthe matter.”Magda let out a deep breath. “Tell me then.”Tilly ran the side of a finger along her lower lip as she took a final glancearound the somber room before speaking.“Down in the burial vaults, Mistress, down in the tunnels running farunderground near where some of the departed are placed and most visitors aren’tallowed, my friend says that the wizards working for the war effort have found away to bring the dead back to life. Though I admit that I have not seen suchthings with my own eyes, she swears on her soul that it be true.“If it be true, then perhaps . . . perhaps there be a way to have MasterBaraccus brought back.” Tilly arched an eyebrow. “You are one with the standingto ask for such indulgences.”“Do you forget so soon exactly who my husband was, Tilly? Take it from me,wizards are masters of deception. They can conjure all sorts of illusions andmake them seem real.”“No, Mistress, I have not forgotten who your husband was. He was loved by manypeople, me included.” Tilly picked up her bucket. She paused to consider Magda’swords. “It must be as you say. You would know of such illusions far better thanI.” She dipped her head respectfully. “I must be on to my work, Mistress.”Magda watched the old woman make her way toward the door. She moved with an everso slight, rocking, hitched stride, the result of a fall the past winter.Apparently, the broken hip had never healed properly.Tilly turned back before reaching the door. “I didn’t mean to upset you,Mistress, with talk of returning a loved one from the dead. I know how you aresuffering. I only thought to help.”The woman probably couldn’t begin to imagine that Magda’s husband, a man ofgreat power and ability, had already returned once from the world of the dead.After others had been lost in the attempt to answer the warning of each night’sred moon, a desperate call for help from the Temple of the Winds beyond theveil, her husband had undertaken the unprecedented journey himself.He had traveled to the world of the dead, and returned.Magda knew that, this time, he would not be returning.With nothing left for her in the world of life, Magda wanted only to join him.She managed another small smile for the woman. “I know, Tilly. It’s all right.Thank you for thinking to help.”Tilly pursed her lips, then thought to add something. “Mistress, perhaps youcould at least visit a spiritist. Such a woman might be able to contact yourhusband for you. There be a woman of such ability down there. I believe thosewizards consult her in their work.”“And what good could it really do to visit such a woman?”“Perhaps you could at least speak with her and ask her to help provide theanswers that would let you be at peace with what First Wizard Baraccus did. Shemay be able to bring you his words from beyond the veil, and put your heart atpeace.”Magda didn’t see how her heart could ever again be at peace.“You may need help, Mistress,” Tilly added. “Maybe First Wizard Baraccus couldstill somehow help to protect you.”Magda frowned at the woman across the small room. “Help to protect me? What doyou mean?”Tilly took a moment in answering. “People are cruel, Mistress. Especially to onenot born noble. As the beautiful wife of the First Wizard, you are widelyrespected, despite being so much younger than him.” Tilly touched her own shorthair, then gestured at Magda. “Your long hair is a mark of your standing. Youhave used your position of power to speak before the council for those in theMidlands who have no voice. You alone give them voice. You are widely known andrespected for that, not just because you were the wife of the First Wizard.“But with Master Baraccus gone you have no one to protect you, to give youstanding before the council or anywhere else for that matter. You may find thatthe world is an unfriendly place to a widow of a powerful man who herself is notgifted and was not born noble.”Magda had already considered all of that, but it was not going to be a problemshe would live to face.“Perhaps the spiritist could bring you valuable advice from beyond the grave.Perhaps your departed husband could at least explain his reasons and ease yourpain as well.”Magda nodded. “Thank you, Tilly. I will think on it.”Her gaze again sank to the silver box of memories. She couldn’t imagine whyBaraccus had done what he had done, or that he would be able to explain it frombeyond the grave. If he had wanted to explain his reasons, he’d had ampleopportunities to do so. He would have at least left a letter waiting for herupon her return.She knew, too, that there was nothing Baraccus could do from beyond the grave toprotect her standing. But that didn’t really matter.A faint glow of candlelight fell across the floor as Tilly opened the door onthe far side of the room.“Mistress.”Magda looked back over her shoulder to see Tilly standing at the open door,lever in hand.Men, their faces in shadow, their hands clasped, stood out in the hallway.“There are . . . visitors come to see you, Mistress.”Magda turned back to the table and carefully closed the silver box of treasuredmemories. “Please let them in, Tilly.”Magda had known that sooner or later they would come. It appeared that it was tobe sooner rather than later. She had planned to be finished with it all beforethey had a chance to show up. That, too, it seemed, was not to be.Her spirits would have sunk lower, but they could go no lower. What did itmatter anymore? What did any of it matter? It would soon enough be ended.“Would you like me to stay, Mistress?”Magda touched her fingers to the long, thick, freshly brushed hair lying overthe front of her shoulder.She had to be strong. Baraccus would want her to be strong.“No, Tilly,” she said after getting a firm command of her voice, “it’s allright. Please let them in and then you may go on to your work.”Tilly bowed deeply from the waist and backed away a little as she held the dooropen wider for the men to enter. As soon as all seven of them had glided intothe room, Tilly hurried away, closing the door behind her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 Magda slid the ornately engraved silver box to the side of the table, placing itbeside a well-used collection of exquisite metalsmithing tools, semipreciousstones in divided trays, and small books filled with notes that had belonged toher husband. She let her hand rest for a moment on the table where his hands hadbeen when he had sometimes worked at the table, late into the quiet of thenight, crafting items like the extraordinary amulet he’d made when the war hadbegun.When she had asked its purpose, he had said that it was an ever-present reminderof his calling come to pass, his talent, his duty, and his reason for being. Hesaid that it represented a war wizard’s prime directive: to cut the attackerdown, to cut them down to their very soul. The ruby red stone in the center ofthe intricate lines represented the blood of the enemy.He said that the amulet represented the dance with death.He had worn it every day since he’d made it, but left it in the First Wizard’senclave, along with his singular black and gold outfit, a war wizard’s outfit, awar wizard’s battle armor, before he had stepped off the side of the Wizard’sKeep and dropped several thousand feet to his death.Magda lifted her long brown hair back over her shoulder as she turned to theseven men crossing the room. She recognized the familiar faces of six members ofthe council. Each face was fixed with a stony expression. She suspected that theexpressions were a mask for a bit of shame they likely felt at what they hadcome to see done.She had known they would come, of course, but not this soon. She had thoughtthat they would have paid her the grace of a bit more time.There was another man with them, his face shadowed by the hood of his loosebrown habit. As they came closer, into the weak light leaking in around theclosed shutters, the seventh man pushed the cowl back to rest on his roundedshoulders.The man’s black eyes were fixed on her, the way a vulture’s steady gaze fixed ona suffering animal. Men often stared at her, but not in this way.He had a short, wide, bull neck. The top of his head was covered in closelycropped, wiry black hair. Stubble darkened the lower half of his face. A highhairline made his forehead and the top of his skull look even larger. The linesand folds of his face for the most part tended to all draw in toward the center,giving his expression a pinched, pushed-in look. All his coarse features lookedfirm and densely packed, as if every part of the man was as hard as hisreputation.He wasn’t ugly, really, merely unusual-looking. In a way, his striking visagegave him an intense, commanding air of authority.There was no mistaking that it was the head prosecutor himself, Lothain, a manof far-reaching authority and the renown to match it. His singular features,punctuated by those black eyes, made him impossible to forget. Magda didn’t knowwhat such a man was doing with the council, carrying out the formality of amiserable little task. It seemed beneath his time.Lothain’s grim expression, fixed with weathered creases lining his leatheryface, did not look as if it might be covering the slightest bit of pity, as didthe expressions of the others. Magda didn’t think the man was capable ofuneasiness, much less shame, and certainly not pity. The hard lines of his facebore testimony to the fact that this was a man who went about his work withrelentless, iron determination.Not a full moon before, everyone had been stunned when Lothain had broughtcharges of treason against the entire Temple team, the men who had, at thedirection of the Central Council, gathered dangerous items of magic togetherinto the Temple of the Winds and then sent it all into the underworld forsafekeeping until after the war. The trial had been a sensation. In it, Lothainhad revealed that the men had gone far beyond their mission and not only lockedaway more than they were supposed to, but made it all but impossible to recover.In their defense, some of them said that they believed in the Old World’sefforts to save mankind from the tyranny of magic.The convictions had ensured that Lothain’s reputation had an edge to it that wasas razor-sharp as the axes that had beheaded the hundred convicted wizards ofthe Temple team.In a bold effort to try to undo the damage done by the traitors, Lothain himselfhad on his own authority then gone beyond the veil, into the underworld itself,to the Temple of the Winds. Everyone feared for him on such a journey. Everyonefeared to lose a man of such ability and powers.To everyone’s relief, Lothain had returned alive, if shaken by the journey.Unfortunately, the damage done by the Temple team had proven to be greater thaneven he had suspected, and he had not found a way in, so he had returned withoutbeing able to repair the damage done by the Temple team he had convicted.Lothain strolled in closer to Magda and gestured, indicating the formality ofhis preamble.“Lady Searus, may I offer my condolences on the unfortunate and untimely deathof your husband.”One of the council members leaned in. “He was a great man.”Lothain’s sidelong glance moved the man back in line with the others.“Thank you, Prosecutor Lothain.” She glanced at the councilman who had spoken.“My husband was indeed a great man.”Lothain lifted a dark eyebrow. “And why do you suppose that such a great man, aman beloved by his people as well as his alluring young wife, would throwhimself over the Keep wall to drop several thousand feet down the side of themountain to meet his death on the rocks below?”Magda kept her voice steady and spoke the simple truth. “I wouldn’t know,Prosecutor. He sent me away for the day on an errand. When I returned, he wasdead.”“Really,” Lothain said in a drawl as he touched his chin and gazed off inthought. “Are you saying that you suspect that he didn’t wish you to be here, tosee the terrible damage a fall from that height to the rocks below would do tohim?”Magda swallowed. She had been unable to prevent herself from imagining it athousand times in her mind’s eye. By the time she had returned, people hadalready seen to having him sealed in a stately coffin.That morning, scant hours after she had learned of his death, the ornatelycarved maple coffin with her husband’s remains had been placed on a funeral pyreon the rampart outside the First Wizard’s enclave. Because his body had beensealed in the coffin, she wasn’t able to look upon his face one last time. Shedidn’t ask to have it opened. She knew why the coffin was sealed.The pyre burned for most of the day as hundreds of solemn people stood silentlywatching the flames consume their beloved leader, and for many, their last hope.Instead of answering such a tasteless question, Magda changed the subject. “MayI inquire as to your business here, Prosecutor Lothain?”“If you don’t mind, Lady Searus, I will be the one to ask the questions.”His tone had an edge to it that took her by surprise.Seeing the shocked expression on her face, he offered a brief, insincere smile.“I didn’t mean to interrupt your grieving, but you see, with the war threateningour very existence, there are matters of pressing concern to all of us that I’mafraid I must ask about. That’s all I meant.”Magda was not in the mood to answer questions. She had her own pressing concern.But she knew this man well enough to know that he wouldn’t leave her to her ownbusiness until he saw to his.She saw no choice but to answer his questions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 Magda smoothed the front of her dress as she gathered her composure. “And whatpressing concerns would you need to ask me about?”He flicked a finger out toward the shutters. “Well, there is the matter of themoon turning red.” Lothain strolled off a few paces and then turned back. “AfterI failed to gain access to the Temple of the Winds, others, presumably withabilities more effective for such a specialized undertaking than I, also madethe journey. None of them returned.”Magda was baffled as to what he was getting at. “They were good men, talentedmen, valuable men. It was a great loss.”Lothain strolled back close to her. His black-eyed gaze glided over items on thetable, like the eyes of a vulture looking among bones for scraps. He turned anotebook with a finger to see what was written on the spine before addressingher again.“Your husband selected those men.”“They were volunteers.”He smiled politely. “Yes of course. I meant to say that your husband selectedthe men who were to go to the Temple and ultimately their death from among agroup of volunteers.”“My husband was First Wizard.” Her brow tightened. “Who would you expect toselect men for such a dangerous mission? The council? You?”“No, no, of course not.” He gestured offhandedly. “It was clearly First WizardBaraccus’s responsibility to select the men who would go.”“Then what is your point?”He smiled down at her. That smile might have been on his lips, but it was not inhis eyes.“My point,” Lothain finally said, “is that he selected men who failed.”Hard as she could, Magda slapped the man across his face. The six councilmembers gasped as they drew back. Her hand probably stung more than Lothain’ssolid face, but she didn’t care. The sound of the slap seemed to hang in the airfor a moment before fading.Lothain dismissed the slap with a polite bow of his head. “Please accept myapology if it sounded like I was making an accusation.”“If it was not an accusation, then what was it?”“I am simply trying to get to the truth.”“The truth? The truth is,” she growled, “that while you were in the underworld,attempting to gain entrance into the Temple, the moon each night and each nightsince turned red in a warning, the most serious warning possible from theTemple, that there is some sort of grave trouble—”He cut her off, dismissing the issue with a flick of his hand. “The appearanceof repeated red moons was probably because of the damage done by the Templeteam.”“And when you returned, after failing in your attempt to undo that damage, theFirst Wizard had the terrible duty to select a volunteer to answer the Temple’snightly call of a red moon. And when the first man failed to return, the FirstWizard had to send another, more experienced wizard, and when that one failed toreturn, he had the grim duty to select yet another, even more skilled man, allof them friends and close associates.“I stood beside him at the rampart each night as he stared off at the red moon,inconsolable, as one friend after another failed to return from the underworld.Inconsolable that he had sent valuable men, his friends, men who were husbandsand fathers, to their death.“Finally, when no one else had succeeded, my husband undertook the journeyhimself, and in the end paid for it with his life.”Lothain let the ringing silence go on for a moment before speaking softly.“Actually, he did not pay for it with his life. He took his own life afterreturning.”Magda glared at him. “What is your point?”Lothain tapped his fingertips together for a moment as he studied her wet eyes.“My point, Lady Searus, is that he took his own life before we learned what hadhappened on his journey to the Temple of the Winds. Perhaps you can tell us?” Hecocked his head. “Did he make it in?”“I don’t know,” Magda said. But she did know. Baraccus had told her that he had,and told her a lot more. “I was his wife, not a member of the council or—”“Ah,” Lothain said as he tipped his head back. “His young, exquisitelybeautiful, but so very ungifted wife. Of course. So obviously a wizard of suchgreat ability would not discuss matters of profound power with someone who hadnone.”Magda swallowed. “That’s right.”“You know, I’ve always been curious. Why would . . .” His frown returned as hisblack eyes again fixed on her. “Well, why would a man of such extraordinaryability, a gifted war wizard, a man whose talents included everything fromcombat to prophecy, why would a man like that marry a woman who had no abilityat all? I mean, other than . . .” He let his gaze wander down her body.He was fishing, accusing her of being nothing but a pretty bauble, the shallowpossession of a powerful man. Prosecutor Lothain was making the bold charge thatshe was simply sexual entertainment and nothing more—repeating what contemptiblegossip took for granted—in at attempt to get her to admit that she was indeedmore, and that she knew more, than would the mere attractive status symbol of anolder man.Magda didn’t take the bait. She didn’t want to trust this man with anything sheknew. Her instincts told her not to tell him what she knew about Baraccus’sjourney to the Temple of the Winds.She felt tears begin to run down her cheek and drip off her chin.“Because he loved me,” she whispered.“Ah, yes, of course. Love.”Magda was not about to explain her relationship with Baraccus to this man.Prosecutor Lothain was too cynical to begin to understand what she and Baraccushad meant to each other. Lothain saw her the way so many men saw her, as anobject of desire, not as a person, the way Baraccus had seen her.One of the council members, a man named Sadler, stepped forward, a scowl growingacross his sagging, aged features.“If you have an important question, then please ask it. Otherwise I think youought to leave the widow Searus to her grief.”“Very well.” Lothain clasped his hands behind his back. “What I would like toknow, is if you are aware of any clandestine meetings that First Wizard Baraccusmight have had?”Magda frowned at the prosecutor. “Clandestine meetings? What do you mean? Whatclandestine meetings? With whom?”“That’s what I’m asking you. Are you aware of any secret meetings he had withthe enemy?”Magda could feel her face go red with rage. “Get out.”Her own voice surprised her with its calm power. He studied her eyes a moment,then turned to leave.“I do hope that First Wizard Baraccus was the hero so many think he was,” hesaid back over his shoulder, “and not involved in a conspiracy.”Taking long strides, Magda closed the distance to the man. “Are you accusing myhusband of conspiring with the enemy?”He turned back at the door and smiled. “Of course not. I merely think it strangethat the men Baraccus sent to the Temple of the Winds failed, and that he wouldthen go himself on such a mission when the war burns hot and he is desperatelyneeded here. After all, approaching enemy troops threaten our very existence. Itseems a strange priority for him to take, don’t you think?“And even more curious, when he returned, he rushed to kill himself beforeanyone could so much as ask him if he made it into the Temple to repair thedamage.”He held up a finger. “Oh, but wait. It just occurs to me that with the moonstill red, he must not have gotten in or it would have returned to normal whilehe was still there.” His frown returned. “Or at least, if he did get in, he mustnot have repaired the damage. After all, had he done so, the red moons wouldhave ceased. Now, as the red moon slowly wanes, apparently even the Temple hasgiven up hope.”He was still fishing. Magda said nothing.His antagonistic smile returned. “You do see my point, I trust. Treason is anoffense that can taint even the dead. And, of course, knowingly aiding a personcommitting treason is treason as well, and would cost such a person their lovelyhead.”He started away again, but then again turned back.“One last thing, Widow Searus. You will make yourself available to answerquestions should I deem a formal investigation to be necessary.”Magda trembled with rage as she glared at the man’s smile. She didn’t give himthe satisfaction of an answer before he finally turned and left."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 After watching the door close, Councilman Sadler turned back to Magda. “I mustapologize, Lady Searus.”“No need for you to apologize.” Magda arched an eyebrow. “Unless you supportLothain’s accusations against my husband?”Sadness softened his expression. “Baraccus was a good man. We all miss him. Ifear that bitter sorrow over recent events may have clouded Lothain’s betterjudgment.”She glanced at the other five. Hambrook and Clay nodded their agreement. ElderCadell made no show of his feelings. The gazes of the last two men, Weston andGuymer, dropped away.“He did not seem to me to be a man possessed by sorrow,” she said.The hunched elder, Cadell, gently touched the back of her shoulder. “There isgrave concern in the air, Magda.” His hand left her shoulder to gesture past herand the other councilmen toward the shuttered window overlooking the city ofAydindril. “All of us stand at the brink of annihilation. People areunderstandably afraid.”Councilman Sadler let out a troubled sigh. “Added to that, there is greatconfusion as to what happened with First Wizard Baraccus. It doesn’t make senseto us, so imagine the rumors and gossip spreading through the Keep, much lessdown in the city. Everyone expected First Wizard Baraccus to always stand withhis people, to defend them, to protect them. Many feel that he instead desertedthem. They don’t understand why. Prosecutor Lothain is merely giving voice tosuspicion and unease, merely speaking aloud what whispers are saying.”Magda lifted her chin. “So you believe that it is proper for Prosecutor Lothainto give voice to gossip? Do you also believe that such talk from anonymouspeople who know nothing of the true reasons behind events calls for fabricatedaccusations from the head prosecutor himself and quick beheadings in order toquell gossip and discontent? Is that your position?”Councilman Sadler smiled somewhat self-consciously at the way she had framed it.“Not at all, Lady Searus. I am merely suggesting that these are stressful timesand perhaps Prosecutor Lothain is feeling those stresses.”Magda didn’t relent or shy from his gaze. “Since when do we allow fears andmisgivings to guide us? I thought we stood for more. I would think that a headprosecutor, of all people, would only be interested in his duty of seeing thetruth brought out.”“And maybe that is exactly his purpose,” Elder Cadell said, speaking softly inan attempt to make what was a sharp point sound less harsh and at the same timebring the disagreement and criticism to an end. “It is the rightful duty of thehead prosecutor to question. That is how we discover where the truth lies.Beyond that, the man is not here to speak to his reasons for asking thequestions he asked, so it is only right that in his absence we in turn notspeculate or fabricate accusations of our own.”Magda had dealt with Elder Cadell for several years. He was open-minded andfair, but she knew that when he made it clear that he was finished hearing apoint of view, he expected it to end there. She turned away to rest a hand onthe smooth, rounded edge of the worktable and changed the subject.“So what would be the purpose of this visit from the council? Have you all cometo discuss some of the matters I have pending before you?”There was a long silence. She knew, of course, that that wasn’t the reason theywere there. She turned back around to face all the men watching her.“Those are matters for another time,” Sadler said.“And will I be heard when I return to the council chambers at another time? Willthe concerns of those I speak for be heard by the council, then, when I am nolonger the wife of our First Wizard?”Sadler’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. “It’s complicated.”She leveled a cutting look at the man. “Maybe to you, but not to me.”“We have a great many matters before us,” Councilman Weston put in, trying toturn the issue aside.“Our immediate concern is the need for a man to replace First Wizard Baraccus,”Elder Cadell said. “The war rages on. Aydindril and the Keep itself could soonbe under threat of siege. Those matters require our full attention.”“Alric Rahl has also just arrived from the D’Haran Lands,” Sadler said. “Thatman has turned the Keep upside down with his own urgent demands. He had beenhoping to meet with First Wizard Baraccus. Something to do with some ratherstartling claims and even more startling remedies. With your husband dead, thereare an endless variety of urgent problems that must be attended to.”“As you can no doubt appreciate,” Councilman Guymer, down at the end of theline, added, “we have any number of pressing issues of rule which require ourfull attention for now.”“Ah.” Magda smiled without humor as she looked at each man in turn. “Pressingissues. Matters of state. Great questions of warfare and rule. You must all beterribly busy with such work. I understand.“So you are here, then, about one of these momentous issues? That is what bringsyou out of council chambers to see me? Vital business of state? Matters of warand peace?”To a man, their faces turned red.Magda strolled past the line of six. “So how may I help with such importantissues that require the council’s full attention? Please tell me what urgentmatter of state brings you to me this particular day, the same day we all stoodby and prayed that the good spirits would take my departed husband, our leader,our First Wizard, into their gentle arms? Speak up, then. What urgent mattertakes you away from your vital work and brings you all up here today?”Their expressions turned dark. They didn’t like being mocked. At that moment,Magda didn’t much care.“You know why we’re here,” Cadell said in an even tone. “It is a small duty, butan important one that demonstrates our respect for our heritage. It shows peoplethat even in such times, tradition still has meaning to every one of our people,even those in high places. Sometimes, ceremony is essential for the continuedcohesion of society.”Councilman Sadler’s bony fingers fidgeted with the sky blue band of rank sewn onthe sleeves of his black robes. “It demonstrates to people that there iscontinuity of the ways that have been handed down to us, that the customs of ourpeople, that the practices that govern civilization itself, still matter andwill not be abandoned.”Magda glared at the man a moment before turning her back on them and sitting onthe chair before the table.“Do it, then,” she said in a voice finally gone lifeless and empty. “Carry outyour critical custom. And then leave me be.”What did it matter anymore?Without another word one of the men pulled out a bloodred ribbon and handed itto her over her shoulder. Magda held it a moment, feeling the silken material inher fingers.“This is not something we take pleasure in doing,” Cadell said quietly frombehind her. “I hope you can understand that.”“You are a good woman, and have always been a proper wife to the First Wizard,”Sadler said, his words rambling on, apparently in an attempt to cover hisobvious discomfort. “This is merely an upholding of custom that gives people asense of order. Because of your high standing as the wife of the First Wizard,they expect us in this case, as the Central Council, to see this done. It’s morefor them, really, that they might see that our ways endure, and thus, despitethe perils of the times, we will endure as well. Think of it as a formality inwhich you play an important role.”Magda hardly heard him. It didn’t really matter. None of it did. An inner voicewhispered promises of the loving embrace of the good spirits awaiting her beyondthe veil of life. Her husband, too, would be there waiting for her. Thosewhispers were reassuring, seductive.She was only distantly aware of her hands gathering her long hair together inthe back and tying it tightly with the ribbon near the base of her skull.“Not that short,” Cadell said as his fingers gently took hers away and slippedthe ribbon down until it was just below the tops of her shoulders. “Though youmay not have been born noble, you have proven yourself in your own right to be awoman of some standing, and besides, you are, after all, still the widow of theFirst Wizard.”Magda sat stiff and still with her hands nested in her lap as another man used arazor-sharp knife to slice through the thick rope of her hair just above theribbon.When it was done, Cadell placed the long hank of hair, tied just beneath thefresh cut with the red ribbon, in her lap.“I’m sorry, Magda,” he said, “I truly am. Please believe that this does notchange the way we feel about you.”Magda lifted the length of brown hair and stared at it. The hair didn’t reallymatter to her. What mattered was being judged by it, or by the lack of it,rather than by what she had made of herself. She knew that without the long hairshe would likely no longer have standing to be heard before the council.That was just the way it was.What mattered most to her was that those whose causes she brought before thecouncil would no longer have her voice to speak for them. That meant that therewere creatures without an advocate who very well might die out and cease toexist.That was what having her hair cut short meant to her, that she no longer had thestanding needed to help those she had come not merely to respect, but to love.Magda handed the severed hair back over her shoulder to Elder Cadell. “Have itplaced where people will see it so they might know that order has been restored,that tradition and customs endure.”“As you wish, Lady Searus.”With her place in the world now corrected, the six councilmen finally left heralone to the gloomy room and her bleak thoughts."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 Warm summer air rising up the towering outer Keep wall and spilling over ontothe rampart ruffled Magda’s shortened hair, pulling strands around in front ofher face. As she made her way along the deserted rampart, she reached up anddrew her hair back. It felt strange, foreign, to her touch now that it only justbrushed her shoulders rather than going down to the small of her back.A lot of people, women mostly, paid very close attention to the length of awoman’s hair because, while not always absolute, length was a fairly accurateindication of their relative social standing and thus their importance.Ingratiating oneself to the right person could bring benefits. Crossing thewrong person could bring trouble. Hair length was a valuable marker.Being the wife of the First Wizard meant wearing her hair longer than mostwomen. It also meant that many women with shorter hair often fawned over her.Magda never took such flattery seriously, but she tried to always be graciousabout it. She knew it was not her, but her position, that drew the interest ofmost of them.To Magda, having not been born noble, her long hair had merely been a way toopen doors, to get an audience and be heard on matters important to her. She hadcared about Baraccus, not how long she was allowed to grow her hair simplybecause she was married to him. While she had come to like the look of it onher, she didn’t attach worth to that which she had not earned.Since her long hair had begun to be a part of her life for the year Baraccus hadcourted her and the two years since she had been married to him, she had thoughtthat she might miss it.She didn’t, really. She only missed him.Her grand wedding to Baraccus seemed forever ago. She had been so young. Shestill was, she supposed.With the long hair gone, in a way it felt as if a weight had been lifted fromher shoulders in more ways than one. She no longer had a responsibility to liveup to what others expected of her. She was herself again, her real self, not aperson defined by an artificial mark of worth.To an extent, she also felt a sense of liberation from her standing, from theneed to act in a manner befitting her place as others saw it. Now, she had noplace, no standing. She was in a way free of the prison of standing. But none ofthat mattered now, for far more important reasons than the length of her hair.Baraccus had given her a new life because of what they meant to each other.Without him she had no life. Her standing didn’t really matter in that equation.Reaching the right spot, the spot forever burned into her memory, Magda steppedup into the opening in the massive, crenellated outer Keep wall. She inched outtoward the edge. Beyond the toes of her boots peeking out from under her skirts,the dark stone of the wall dropped away for thousands of feet. Below thefoundation of the Keep, the cliff dropped even farther to the ledges andboulders below. Feathery tufts of clouds drifted along the cliff walls beneathher. It was a frightening, dizzying place to stand.Magda felt small and insignificant up on the top edge of the towering wall. Thewind at times was strong enough to threaten to lift her from her perch. Sheimagined that it might even carry her away like a leaf in the wind.The beautiful city of Aydindril lay spread out below, flowing across rollinghills that spilled from the foot of the mountain. Green fields surrounded thecity, and out beyond them lay dense forests. From its place high on themountain, the monolithic Wizard’s Keep stood watch over the mother citysparkling like a jewel set in that verdant carpet.Magda could see men leading horses and wagons as they returned from their workin the fields. Smoke rose from chimneys all across the valley as women preparedthe evening meal for their families. Slow-moving crowds, visiting markets,shops, or going about their work, made their way through the tangled net ofstreets.While she could see the activity, she heard none of the hooves of the horses,the rumble of wagons, the cry of street vendors. From this distance the loftyworld up at the Keep was silent but for the calls of birds wheeling overhead andthe sound of the wind over ramparts and around the towers.Magda had always thought of the Keep, more than anything, as mute. Thoughhundreds of people lived and worked in the enormous stone fortress, went abouttheir lives, raised families, were born, lived, and died there, the Keep itselfwitnessed it all in brooding silence. The dark presence of the place stoicallywatched centuries and lives come and go.These massive battlements where she stood had watched her husband’s life end.This was the very spot where he had stood in the last precious moments of hislife.She thought, fleetingly, that she didn’t want to follow him, but the whispersfrom the back of her mind overwhelmed those doubts. What else was there for her?Magda looked out at the world spread out far below, knowing that this was whathe would have seen as he stood in this very place. She tried to imagine thethoughts he must have wrestled with in his last moments of life.She wondered if he thought of her in those last moments, or if some terrible,weighty matter had taken even that from him.She was sure that he must have been sad, heartbroken even, that he was about toleave her, that his life was about to be finished. It must have been agony.Baraccus had loved life. She could not imagine him taking his life without apowerful reason.Still, he had. That was all that mattered now. Everything had changed and therewas no calling it back.Her world had changed.Her world had ended.At the same time she felt shame for focusing so narrowly on her own world, herown life, her own loss. With the war raging, the world had ended for a greatmany people. The wives of the men Baraccus had sent to the Temple of the Windsstill waited in silent misery, hoping their loved ones might return. Magda knewthat they never would. Baraccus had told her so. Yet they still clung to thehope that those men could yet come home. Other women, the wives of men gone offto war, wailed in anguish when they received the terrible news that their menwould not be returning. The corridors of the Keep often echoed with the forlorncries of the women and children left behind.Like Baraccus, Magda hated the war and the terrible toll it took on everyone. Somany had already lost their lives. So many yet would. And still there was no endin sight. Why couldn’t they be left in peace? Why must there always be thoseseeking conquest or domination?There were so many other women who had lost their husbands, fathers, brothers,sons. She was not alone in such suffering. She felt the heavy weight of shamefor feeling so sorry for herself when others, too, were going through the sameagony.Yet she could not help being smothered beneath the whispers of her own grief.She also felt a deep sense of guilt over those she was abandoning. She had givenvoice before the council to those who had no voice. Over the last couple ofyears she had gradually become the conscience of the council, reminding them oftheir duty to protect those who could not protect themselves. The night wisps,for example, that she had seen only days before, depended on others to speak forthem and their need to be left in peace lest their fragile lives be silenced forgood.Because of her standing, she had often been able to go before the council andremind them of their duty to all those who lived in the Midlands. Sometimes,when she explained the situation to them, they did the right thing. Sometimesshe shamed them into doing the right thing. Sometimes they looked forward to herrecommendations.But without standing she could no longer be that voice before the council. Itwas wrong that being married to a man of standing in turn gave her standing, butthat’s the way the world worked.She was proud that she had made friends of those rare and secretive beings thatfew had ever seen, or ever would see. She was grateful for all the friends shehad made of far-flung peoples of the Midlands. She had made the effort to learnmany of their languages, and because of that they had come to trust her whenthey would trust no other. She was proud of what she had been able to do toprotect their peaceful, isolated lives.She thought that maybe she had also been able to bring some understandingbetween different peoples, different tribes and communities, and in so doinghelped in some small way to make them all feel a part of the larger Midlands.But when her husband had ended his life, he had also inadvertently taken awayher voice before the council.Her life no longer had a noble purpose, except to herself.And at that moment, her own life meant nothing to her but insufferable anguishwith no end in sight. She felt as if she was caught up in a raging torrent ofsorrow.She just wanted the hopeless agony to end.Inner whispers urged her to end the suffering."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 Looking down at the frightening drop over the edge of the wall, a drop ofthousands of feet, Magda saw that the towering wall in this section of the Keepwasn’t perfectly vertical but actually flared out as it descended toward thefoundation within the rock face of the mountain. She realized that when shejumped she would need to get herself some distance out away from the wall toensure that she cleared the steeply angled stone skirt of the Keep or it wouldbe a long, gruesome fall.Her muscles tensed at the thought of a drawn-out, tumbling descent, repeatedlysmacking the steeply angled wall and breaking bones all along the way down. Shedidn’t like the thought of that. She wanted a quick end.She placed her hands on the stone battlements flanking the notched opening asshe leaned out farther for a better view. She also checked back and to each sideto make sure that no one was around. Like her husband, she didn’t need to worrymuch about anyone trying to stop her. Because it led to the First Wizard’senclave, this particular rampart was restricted, leaving it a lonely,out-of-the-way area of the Keep. The guards back at the access stairs thatspiraled up from below knew Magda and had offered their sincere condolences.Since they knew her so well, they hadn’t tried to prevent her from going up top.Peering down the mountain, Magda tried to judge how far out she would need tojump in order not to hit the wall on the way down. She wanted it to be overbefore she had time to feel the pain of it. The whispers promised her that ifshe got out far enough, she would fall free until she finally reached the rocksat the bottom, where it would all be over in a single instant.She hoped that Baraccus had been able to do the same and that he had notsuffered.But he must have felt a different sort of suffering all the way down: thesuffering of knowing that he was leaving life and leaving her. She knew thatshe, too, would have to endure that final terror of leaving life behind.But it would end quickly enough and then she hoped to be in the protective armsof the good spirits. Maybe then she would again see Baraccus smile at her. Shehoped he wouldn’t be angry.She wasn’t angry at him giving up his life because she knew him well enough toknow that he had to have had a compelling reason for what he had done. She knewthat a great many people had sacrificed their lives in the war so that othersmight live. Those sacrifices were made out of love for others. She knew thatBaraccus would only have given his own life for just such a powerful reason. Howcould she be angry at him for making that sacrifice? No, she couldn’t feel angertoward him.She felt only crushing sadness.Magda gripped the top corners of the rough stone to each side. Even though thesun was setting, the stone was still warm. While the battlements were spacedquite a ways apart for her size, they would still be useful to help push herselfoff.Not far away, out in front of her in midair, a raven rode an updraft, itsglistening black feathers ruffling in the wind as its black eyes watched herprepare to leap.Magda bent at the knees, readying herself for a maximum effort to jump clear ofthe wall. In a daze, she felt as if she were only watching herself. The whispersurged her on.Her heart hammering, Magda took a deep breath, crouched down even more, andstarted rocking back and forth, swinging farther out each time, standing,crouching, standing, crouching, back and forth, farther out over the edge of thewall, farther out toward the drop that would take her pain away, building upspeed for the final, big push.In a swelling moment of doubt, she heard a voice within whisper for her not tothink, but to simply do it.As she swung herself out past the wall on the last rocking arc before the greatleap, she realized in a single, crystal-clear instant the true enormity of whatshe was doing.She was ending her life, ending it forever, ending it for all time. Everythingthat she was would be no more.The voice became more insistent, telling her not to think, telling her to endher misery once and for all.She was struck by how odd that seemed. How could she not think? Thinking wascritical to any important decision.In that icy flash of comprehension, in spite of the whispers, she realized justhow terrible a mistake she was making.It was as if, since learning of her husband’s death, she had been carried alongin a raging river of emotions, urged onward by an inner voice pressing hertoward the only thing that seemed like it could make the agony stop. Sherealized only now that she hadn’t thought it through, she had simply allowedherself to be swept along toward the spot where she now stood.She was making no loving sacrifice. She was not trading her life for somethingshe believed in, offering it for something of value as she knew Baraccus had.She was instead throwing it away for nothing. She was giving in to weakness,nothing more.She was thoughtlessly rejecting all she believed in, all she had fought for. Howmany times had she gone before the council to speak for the lives of those whocouldn’t speak for themselves? How many times had she argued for the importanceof their lives, for the value of all life?Was hers not just as important? Was her own life to be so carelessly, sofoolishly, thrown away? Was she not going to fight for the right to her own lifeas she had fought for others?She remembered telling Tilly that every life was precious. This was her onlylife and, despite her crushing agony, her life was precious to her. In hergrief, she had allowed herself to be blind to that.As if coming out of a fog, she realized, too, that there were things going onthat didn’t make sense. There had to be more to everything that had happenedthan she was seeing. Why had Baraccus killed himself? What had been his purpose?Who was he protecting? For what had he traded his life?She suddenly regretted thinking that she wanted to die, regretted being up onthat wall. In fact, it now seemed to her as if she had somehow arrived at thatspot in a dream.As much as she hurt, she wanted to live.But she was already moving too fast to stop, already flying out toward emptyspace."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 Magda’s fingers clawed frantically at the stone to each side, but it wasn’tenough to halt her momentum. She swept out through the opening in the battlementtoward the terrifying drop, with a scream caught in her throat.Just as she lost her footing going over the brink of the stone wall, a powerfulgust of wind rising up the side of the mountain caught her body, lifting some ofher weight as she snatched at the wall to each side and helping her get herselfback to solid footing. The push from the wind coming up the mountain had beenjust the help she needed to stop herself from going over the edge.As she started to fall back toward the Keep, her left hand came up off the walland she wheeled that arm in the air, trying to maintain her balance. As shetoppled back, she grabbed at the wall to the right side and caught a joint ofstone blocks. With the help of her grip on that joint, she was able to hold ontight enough to get her balance and keep herself from falling back off the wall.Finally solidly back on her feet, she let out a deep, frightened sigh. She knewthat it would be a while before her galloping heart would slow.Her head was suddenly more clear than it had been all day.She was alive. She wanted to stay alive. She suddenly had a thousand questionsand wanted the answers. She clutched at the stone block for support so that shewouldn’t accidentally fall, now that she knew she didn’t want to go over theside.That was when her fingers felt something odd in the joint between the blocks.It wasn’t rough like the stone. Rather, it had a smooth edge.In the fading light, Magda frowned as she looked over at the joint in themassive granite blocks. There, wedged between the dark, mottled stones, was afolded piece of paper.She couldn’t imagine what a folded piece of paper was doing, stuck there. Itmade no sense. Who would put a piece of paper there in the joint at the edge ofthe wall? And why?She leaned close, narrowing her eyes, trying to see better. The paper looked tobe wedged tightly in place. She could only get ahold of the very edge of it witha finger and thumb. Being careful not to tear it, she gently wiggled the foldedpaper from side to side to loosen it from its hiding place.At last she was able to work it free.Careful not to let a gust of wind catch it and pull it from her fingers, shestepped down off the wall onto the deserted rampart as she unfolded the paper.There was something written on the paper. She immediately recognized herhusband’s handwriting. With trembling fingers, she held the paper close in orderto read it in the last light of the dying day.My time has passed, Magda. Yours has not. Your destiny is not here. Your destinyis to find truth. It will be difficult, but have the courage to take up thatcalling.Look out to the rise on the valley floor below, just outside the city to theleft. There, on that rise, a palace will one day be built. There is yourdestiny, not here.Know that I believe in you. Know, too, that I will always love you. You are arare, fierce flower, Magda. Be strong now, guard your mind, and live the lifethat only you can live.Magda blinked the tears away and again silently read it to herself. In her mind,she could hear her husband’s voice speaking the words to her.Magda brought the paper to her lips and kissed the words written there.She looked up from the paper, out through the opening in the stone wall, andbelow saw a beautiful green rise that overlooked the city of Aydindril. For thelife of her, she could not fathom what Baraccus meant about a palace, or abouther destiny there.Baraccus was a wizard. Part of his talent was prophecy. She swallowed past thelump in her throat, wondering for a moment if what he meant was that he wantedher to go on with her life and marry another.She didn’t want another man. She didn’t want to marry anyone else. She hadmarried the man she had loved.And now he was gone.She read the words yet again. There was something more to them, she knew therewas. There was something more important than a simple prophecy, or even thesimple message asking her to embrace life.Wizards existed in a complex world all their own. They rarely if ever madeanything simple to understand. Baraccus was no different.There was a purpose to these carefully chosen words, a hidden message, she knewthere was. He meant for her to know something more.Your destiny is to find truth. It will be difficult, but have the courage totake up that calling.What could he possibly mean by that? What truth? What truth was he expecting herto find? What calling did he expect her to take up?Her head spun with thoughts scattering in every direction. She began to imagineall sorts of things he could have meant. Maybe he meant the truth of what he haddone at the Temple of the Winds. Maybe the truth of why the moon had stayed redeven though he had told her that he had gotten inside.Maybe the truth of why he had returned from the world of the dead only to endhis life.It seemed to her, though, that there was more to the message than any of that.There was meaning hidden with the words. There was a reason he had not made themessage clear.Baraccus had told her in the past that foreknowledge could taint prophecy andcause dire, unintended consequences. Knowing a prophecy could alter how onebehaved, so it was sometimes necessary to withhold information in order for freewill to be able to let life play itself out.Even without understanding the meaning of the note, she knew that Baraccus wastelling her as much as he could without tainting it with what more he knew.Magda knew that Baraccus had given her a message that involved life and death.She grasped just how important the message had been to him. From that, she knewthat it was perhaps even more important to her.Magda gazed out again over a landscape growing more dark by the moment.She had to know what Baraccus had been trying to tell her with his last words.She couldn’t let his effort, his sacrifice, be in vain. She had to find out whathe had really wanted her to know.Her life suddenly had a purpose.Your destiny is to find truth.She had to find out what he had meant by that.Baraccus had reached out from the world of the dead and given her a reason tolive.He believed in her.She kissed his words again as she slumped to the ground and wept at all that waslost to her, at all that she had just gained. She wept with grief for her loss,and with the relief of being alive."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 Near her rooms, in a quiet corridor softly lit by reflector lamps hung atregular intervals on the dark wood panels to each side, men-at-arms blocked herway. A lot of men. They weren’t regular soldiers, nor were they the elite HomeGuard. At first, from a distance, Magda had found herself worrying that theymight be troops from the prosecutor’s office.As head prosecutor, Lothain had his own private army, men who took orders fromand were loyal to him and him alone. It was a privilege of his high office thatno other in the Keep enjoyed. It was argued that to be independent and remainabove outside influence, the prosecutor’s office had to have its own guard toprotect the office from coercion and threats, and to enforce decrees againstthose who would otherwise resist.These men, though, were not dressed in the dark green tunics of the prosecutor’soffice. These were hulking men, towering men, with bull necks, powerfulshoulders, beefy arms, and massive chests. Under their leather armor they worechain mail that was well used, scuffed, and discolored by tarnish. She couldsmell the oil they used to help keep rust from their mail and weapons. The whiffof slightly rancid oil mixed disagreeably with the smell of stale sweat.There was no mistaking that the armor these men wore was not meant for show. Theweapons they carried—swords, knives, maces, and scarred battle-axes—likewise hadthe single-minded purpose of life and death.These grim-faced men were not the kind who marched on a field of review or apolished patrol.These were men who had looked death in the eye and grinned.Magda stood frozen, unable to reach the door to her rooms, not knowing quitewhat to do. They in turn stood silently watching her like a curiosity come intotheir midst, but made no attempt to advance on her.Before she could ask the men what they were doing there or tell them to move outof the way, another man, long locks of blond hair to his shoulders and dressedin layers of dark traveling clothes and leather, stepped out from behind thewall of men. He was just as big as the men all around him and likewise heavilyarmed, but he was a bit older, perhaps just entering his forties. Charactercreases had begun to take a permanent set.As he moved forward through the armored soldiers he pulled off long gauntletsand tucked them behind a broad leather weapons belt. Two men, larger even thanhim or the soldiers, stayed close behind him but a little off to each side. Likeall the others, they, too, had blond hair. Magda saw that above their elbows thetwo men wore metal bands with wicked blades jutting out, weapons for brutal,close-quarters combat. Instead of mail, the two wore elaborately fitted leatherarmor sculpted to the contours of their prodigious muscles. On the center oftheir powerful chests a stylized letter “R” was engraved into the leatherbreastplates.The man with the long hair and the cutting, raptor gaze dipped his head in aquick bow.“Lady Searus?”Magda glanced to the blue eyes of the guards behind his shoulders, then back tothe man who had spoken.“That’s right.”“I am Alric Rahl,” he said before she had a chance to ask.“From D’Hara?”He confirmed it with a quick nod.“My husband has spoken highly of you.”His cutting gaze remained fixed on her eyes. “Baraccus was more than merely agood man. He is the one man here at the Keep that I trusted. I am deeply grievedto hear that we’ve lost him.”“Not as grieved as I am.”His lips pressed tightly together with what looked to be heartfelt sorrow as henodded again and then gestured to her door, off behind him.“Would it be possible to speak with you privately?”Magda glanced toward her door as the wall of men parted to provide a corridorlined with muscle and chain mail.Magda dipped her head. “Of course, Lord Rahl.”While she had never met the man before, Baraccus had spoken of him from time totime. From what she had gathered from the things Baraccus had told others, thiswas not a man to be trifled with. He looked the part of the stories she’d heardof him. She knew from comments made by members of the council that many didn’tthink much of Alric Rahl, but Baraccus had. He had told her that, despite hisaudacity, he was a man to be trusted.As Magda made her way toward the doors to her room, the grim soldiers spread outto take up stations up and down the hall.She glanced back over her shoulder. “Are you expecting trouble, here, in theKeep, Lord Rahl?”“From what I’ve seen,” he said cryptically, “the Keep is no safer than anywhereelse these days.”Magda frowned. “And what have you seen, if I may ask?”“Three of my men have died since we recently arrived.”Magda halted and turned back to take in his grim expression. “Died? Here in theKeep? How?”He hooked a thumb behind his weapons belt. “One was found in a corridor, deadfrom over a hundred stab wounds. Another died in his sleep for no reason wecould find. The third suffered a mysterious fall from a high wall.”Magda had almost had such a fall. She still felt strangely disoriented, as ifshe were only now escaping the grip of a terrifying, otherworldly nightmare,rather than simply a grief-stricken moment of weakness.“Perhaps the man who was stabbed had gotten into a fight with the wrong peopleover something?” she suggested.“All three can be explained away if you try hard enough,” he said, making itobvious that he didn’t buy the easy explanations.Magda worked to gather her composure as she started out once more, making herway past the looming, silent soldiers watching her. She didn’t like to think ofthe Keep as a place where danger lurked. Yet Baraccus, too, had been troubled bywhat he had thought to be suspicious deaths at the Keep.Besides that, the Keep was, after all, the place where her husband had died aswell. The silent Keep had almost watched her follow him to a grisly death on therocks below.She was beginning to grasp that there was more to her husband’s death than ithad at first appeared. It no longer seemed a simple suicide. The note in herpocket, his last message to her, certainly made it clear enough that there wassomething more going on beneath the surface.With all the people living and working at the Keep, and with the war going on,to say nothing of the gifted working with profoundly dangerous magic in aneffort to create weapons they could use to turn back the horde from the OldWorld, it wasn’t exactly surprising that people at the Keep would die. LordRahl’s three men were not the only unexplained deaths she’d heard about. Butstill, even healthy infants died unexpectedly from time to time.Such deaths didn’t prove that something evil was going on within the walls ofthe Keep, though she knew that there were those who believed as much. Death,though, was a part of life. There could not be life without death alwaysshadowing it.Magda unlocked the heavy doors and spread them wide in invitation as sheentered. The two big guards followed Lord Rahl into the room, then closed thedoors and took up stations to either side, feet spread, hands clasped behindtheir backs.Magda gestured toward the two men. “I thought you said that you wanted to speakprivately.”Alric Rahl glanced back at the men and caught her meaning. “We are speakingprivately. These are my personal bodyguards.”“A wizard who needs muscle?”“Magic does not ensure safety, Lady Searus. Surely your husband must have toldyou as much.”“What do you mean?”“In a land of blind men, sight is an advantage. But when everyone can see, youreyesight offers no special benefit. Among the gifted, the ability to bend magicto your will is not a weapon that makes you exceptional, much less invincible.Magic can be countered by the magic others possess, so having the gift does notin itself make one all-powerful, or necessarily safe.”Alric Rahl turned and cast a hand out, bringing flame to the wicks of severallamps on nearby tables and half a dozen candles in an iron stand. “Not to saythat it doesn’t have its uses.”With the added light to aid him, he strolled deeper into the quiet room,scanning the collection of books in carved walnut bookcases standing against thewall to the right. He rested his palm on the silver handle of a knife at hisbelt as he moved down the line of shelves, pausing to gaze in at volumes behindglass doors. He squinted a bit as he read the titles.“What’s more,” he added as he finally straightened his broad shoulders, “we areall flesh and blood, and a simple knife will cut my throat the same as it wouldcut yours, and it takes no magic at all to do that.”“I see your point. Baraccus never put it in exactly those terms, but I haveheard him say similar things. He once told me that the gift was coveted by thosewho didn’t have it because they wrongly believed that it would protect them, orthat with it they could win in battle, but what they didn’t realize was that itoffered only a fluid, ever-escalating form of checkmate. I guess I neverrealized his full meaning until I heard you explain it.”Alric Rahl nodded, still looking at the books. “That is the whole issue in anutshell: the balance of power. Even as we speak, wizards of great skill hereand in the Old World work to come up with new forms of magic that will offer anadvantage in the war. Both sides seek ever more deadly weapons crafted by thegift, hoping to find one that will have no counter from the other side.“If we succeed, we will turn the tide of war and survive. If they succeed, wewill be enslaved if not annihilated.”A vague sense of apprehension settling into her, Magda gazed off at her emptyquarters. “Being the wife of the First Wizard, I have often heard such worries.”Finished perusing the books, Lord Rahl returned to stand before her.“That’s why I’m here. That balance of power has shifted. We now stand at thebrink of annihilation.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 “That is frightening news.” Disheartened, Magda slowly shook her head. “But I’mafraid that there’s not much I can do to help you. I’m not gifted.”Alric Rahl paced off a few strides, seeming to consider how to proceed.“Baraccus and I were working on something together,” he finally said. “I’ve beendealing with my part of it while he was working on a separate issue. I need toknow if he was able to accomplish his objective, but I didn’t get here in timeto speak with him.” He turned back. “Absent Baraccus, I’m hoping you can help mewith what needs to be done, now.”Magda reflexively reached to pull her hair back over her shoulder, but her hairbarely brushed her shoulders, now, so there was nothing to pull back. She letthe hand drop.“I’m sorry, Lord Rahl, but with Baraccus lost to us I don’t know what help I canbe.”“You know people in the inner circles of power here at the Keep. You know whowould listen. You can talk to the council. You could help convince them to takeseriously my warnings. That would be a good start.”“Talk to the council? The council won’t listen to me.”“Of course they will. You’re the closest thing they have to the word of Baraccushimself.”“The word of Baraccus?” Magda shook her head. “I am no longer the wife of theFirst Wizard, so I no longer have standing with the council, or anywhere elsefor that matter.” She held out a short strand of hair for him to see. “The menof the council are the ones who cut my hair to make that clearly evident toeveryone.”“Who cares about your hair? Baraccus may be dead, but you’re still the wife tothe First Wizard. His passing does not change the fact that you knew him betterthan anyone, or that you were the one he trusted. He confided in you, I know hedid—he told me so himself. He said that because you weren’t gifted you wereoften the best sounding board he had.”“Baraccus is dead.” Magda looked away from the man’s blue eyes. “The councilwill soon replace him. Without Baraccus alive, I no longer have any status.That’s why they cut my hair.“It’s an age-old custom among the people of the Midlands. The length of awoman’s hair shows the world her standing. It matters for everything here in theMidlands and especially in the Keep. This is the seat of power for the Midlands,so such issues of rank, influence, and power always matter.”He gestured impatiently. “I know about the custom. It’s absurd. I can understandpetty people paying attention to such trivialities when deciding the seatingarrangement at a banquet, but beyond that it ceases to be useful. This is aserious issue. What does the length of your hair have to do with matters of lifeand death?”“It has everything to do with it, here in the Midlands. I’m no longer worthy ofrecognition because I was not born noble and my husband, who when he was alivegave me standing, is dead. That means that I’m back to where I was before I wasmarried to him. This isn’t by my choice, it’s just the way it is.”Lord Rahl closed the distance back to her. “How do you think you came to be thewife of First Wizard Baraccus? Do you think that Baraccus sought out a weak,unimportant wife?”“Well, I—”“You became wife to First Wizard Baraccus because you were the only woman whowas worthy of being his wife. Are you suggesting that Baraccus, the FirstWizard, a war wizard, would want to marry a woman who was weak? He married youbecause you were a woman of strength.”“That’s very flattering, Lord Rahl, but I’m afraid that it’s simply not true. Iwas a nobody when he met me, and with him gone I am once again a nobody.”He looked genuinely disappointed by her words. The fire seemed to go out of hiseyes. His expression sagged.“You were his wife, so I guess you would know him better than anyone.” He shookhis head with great sadness. “I admit to finding myself disillusioned to learnthat Baraccus was not the man I had thought him to be, that he was insteadnothing more than a rather common fool, like so many other ordinary men.”“A common fool? What are you talking about?”He lifted an arm and then let it drop to his side. “He had the wool pulled overmy eyes all along. You’ve made me see the unpleasant truth. I always thought himintelligent and strong, but it turns out that Baraccus was simply an ordinary,weak-minded man who like so many would marry even a lowly woman of no standingand no worth simply because she batted her eyes at him.“You apparently came along in one of his weak moments, stroked his male pridewith a bit of feminine flattery, and just that easy, you had yourself a man ofstanding. It’s clear now that he must have been too insecure to think that awoman of standing would be interested in him, so he was willing to trade thestanding you lacked in return for your affections. I guess he wasn’t the man ofcharacter I thought he was.“I can see now that by marrying you he was hiding his lack of confidence withwomen. It’s clear now that he was ready to settle on the first shapely woman, nomatter her standing, who swayed her becoming ass before his weak-minded gaze.”In a blink, Magda had the point of her knife poised motionless a hairsbreadthfrom his throat.“I will not stand here and listen to you insult a righteous man who is not hereto defend himself,” she growled.“Apparently, my old friend Baraccus taught his nobody wife a thing or two aboutusing a weapon.”“A thing or two,” she confirmed. “Tell those two that if they take another stepyou will be breathing through something other than that foul mouth of yours.”She in fact knew far more than a thing or two about using weapons. Baraccus hadactually used his gift to aid in teaching her a great deal about weapons. Hesaid that as wife to the First Wizard, she would always be a target. He wantedher to be able to protect herself when he wasn’t around.“I can’t believe that he ever considered you a friend. I think it’s high timethat you were on your way back to your D’Haran Lands. I want you and your littlearmy gone first thing in the morning. Do you understand me?”A sly smile overcame the man at the point of her knife as he signaled the twomen near the doors to stand down. Magda was surprised by his smile, but heranger kept her focused, and kept her knife where it was.“What’s this? A nobody, a woman not born noble, a woman with short hair, a womanof no standing, who has the nerve to tell me, the Lord Rahl, what I will andwill not do? What gives you the right to speak this way to the leader of D’Hara,a man who commands the army outside your room, and guards inside it? How dareyou think that you can speak to me in such a manner? Where do you, a woman of nostatus, a nobody, get the gall to think you have such a right?”“Such a right?” Magda raged in fury.But then she saw the twinkle in his eye and realized what he was doing. Her furyfaltered. She suddenly felt foolish. She couldn’t keep a shamed smile fromovercoming her.Magda bowed her head in a gesture of exaggerated respect.“It would seem that the Lord Rahl is not so stupid as some on the council say.”His grin widened. “Magda, I knew Baraccus long before you met him. I’ve foughtbeside the man. I knew his character. He would never be attracted to a weakwoman. He never cared about the length of your hair or standing when he met you,did he?”Magda shook her head, remembering the first time she met him. He didn’t evenlook at her hair. He looked into her eyes and asked her name.“He cared about your character. He cared who you were. Baraccus was a man ofpower. He was only attracted to strength and temperament that could complementhis. He could have had any woman he wanted—I know because many sought him outand he always turned them away. Yet he chose you. He chose you not because youwere weak and common, but because you were rare, and his equal in every way thatmattered.”She smiled again, but this time in appreciation. “Thank you for the kindestwords about my husband—and me—that I have ever heard.”“They are true words, Magda. He chose you because you were worthy of him. He waslucky to have you. I’ll not have you selling my friend’s wife short.”Her smile turned downhearted. “I don’t think I could begin to tell you how muchI miss him, how lost I am without him.”“I understand. Now, let’s put this nonsense aside; we have urgent matters thatmust be addressed. With Baraccus gone, you are the only one I can turn to foranswers. This is a time for courage and honesty if we are to have a chance.”Magda finally lifted her chin. “What can I do to help you, Lord Rahl?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 “You must speak to the council and let them know of the threat, make themunderstand how serious it is,” Alric Rahl told her. “With Baraccus dead, it’s upto us, and we’re running out of time.”“What threat?”A bit surprised, he cast her a suspicious look from under a lowered brow.“Surely, Baraccus must have told you about the dream walkers.”Magda stilled. She wanted to help the man, but she didn’t like the idea oftalking about anything Baraccus had told her in confidence. The two of them hadalways had an understanding that, because of his position, the things hediscussed with her were meant to remain strictly confidential. She never spokeabout such matters without her husband explicitly telling her that it was allright.She remembered, then, the note in her pocket, the note Baraccus had left for herup on the battlement. Those were his last words to her.Your destiny is to find truth. It will be difficult, but have the courage totake up that calling.It seemed clear that Baraccus meant for her to act. His note didn’t ask her tokeep silent, or to stay out of things. He said that she must have the courage toact.Magda realized that with Baraccus gone she needed to trust someone. While sheknew a number of the people her husband had worked with and trusted, she neverheard him speak about his trust in anyone the way he spoke of his trust of AlricRahl.“He did,” she said at last.“Good. Tell me what you know about them, anything Baraccus said.”Magda took a deep breath to gather her thoughts. “Well, when enemy gifted in theOld World not long ago created dream walkers, Baraccus told me that suchweapons, made out of people, could mean the end of us all. He said that therewas only a small window of opportunity to act. In secret, he worked tirelesslyon the problem. In the course of that work he discovered that the dream walkerswere created through the use of a constructed spell.”Lord Rahl nodded. “He told me that much of it when he traveled through the sliphto warn me about the dream walkers.”Magda bristled at the mention of the sliph. She hated that creature made from awoman. The sliph took Baraccus away from her to travel great distances in ashort time. Yet one more of the abominations created by wizards out of humanbeings.Magda reminded herself not to be so harsh. Had not wizards created some of thethings they did, all of them would be dead by now, or worse. There were wizardswho created weapons, such as the dream walkers, to cause harm, but there weremany wizards who used their ability to create things that saved a great manylives. The sliph, as much as Magda didn’t like her, was one of those things.“Baraccus and I discussed the situation and made plans as to how we could dealwith the dream walkers,” Lord Rahl said, “but I’ve not heard what happenedsince. I don’t know what Baraccus was able to accomplish, if anything. That’sone of the reasons why I’m here.”“Well, because Baraccus understood what the spell did, he was able to work inreverse from there to create a close replica, even though it was not entirelyfunctional, of what he believed the constructed spell would have had to be like.From that approximation, he was able to ignite an artificial verification web.Once he had a functioning verification web, he back-traced the spell’s uniquenodes and core elements to the men who would have created the real one.”His brow had lifted in surprise as he listened. “That’s quite remarkable. Ididn’t know that such a thing was possible.”She confirmed that it was with a nod. “I saw it one night. It was a frighteningthing made of glowing lines tracing their way through midair. Baraccus ignitedthe web around himself in order to trace the nodes. I was terrified for himwhile he floated motionless inside it.”He eyed her as if seeing her in a new light. “For one not born with the gift,you certainly have a remarkable grasp of it. I doubt that one gifted person in ahundred would even understand what you have just told me.” Lord Rahl rolled hishand impatiently. “So what did Baraccus do then?”“He had contacts with a shadowy group. I never saw them and I don’t know whothey were, but I suspected that they might have been resistance fighters fromthe Old World. He met with them in secret and sent them on a covert mission tothe Old World.”Lord Rahl arched an eyebrow. “Did the council know about this?”“No one knew. The replica spell, the artificial verification web, its ignitionand node traces, the meetings in the dead of the night with those men, no oneknew any of it. Baraccus said that with dream walkers now a reality, it wouldjeopardize everything if anyone knew about any aspect of it.“Not long ago, he came home a few hours before dawn and told me that the menhe’d sent had gotten in and killed the team of gifted in the Old World who hadconstructed the dream-walker spell. He could share his excitement with no onebut me. He was nearly in tears with relief and said that it meant that in alllikelihood such a constructed magic could never again be brought to reality.”Lord Rahl let out a great sigh of relief. “That was the confirmation I’ve beenhoping to hear. I can’t imagine how he managed to pull off such a feat, but allof mankind owes Baraccus an enormous debt of gratitude.” His frown returned.“What about the constructed spell itself?”Magda leaned in close and lowered her voice. “When he came home that night,Baraccus told me that the men had not only succeeded in killing the team thathad created the dream walkers, but they had also stolen the constructed spelland brought it back with them. They gave it to Baraccus.”Lord Rahl looked truly shocked. “No.”“Yes,” she said with a firm nod. “Baraccus showed me the small box made of bone,its sides and lid stitched together with cords made from strips of dried humanflesh. Inside was something wrapped in buckskin. He held it out and laid backthe folds of buckskin to show me that it held a round thing about the size of ahen’s egg. It was as black as a moonless night, like something forged in thedarkest depths of the underworld, with shadowy shapes moving across its surface.It looked liked death itself brought into the world of life.” Magda pressed theflats of her hands to the tense knot in her stomach. “It seemed as if that evilthing might suck the very light from the room.”Pulling herself away from the memory, she looked back up. “When Baraccus openedthe spell with his gift, it ignited into a framework, taller than he was. It wasa structure of thousands of glowing, colored lines of light all linked togetherin an intricate, circular gridwork, very similar to the verification web he hadcrafted before. It was both beautiful and terrible all at the same time.Baraccus said that when it was used for its intended purpose, it would have beenopened around the person who was to become a dream walker.”Magda took a few steps away to stare off into the dark end of the room. “I can’timagine being one of the people who stepped inside that thing to becomesomething other than they were born. I can’t imagine allowing yourself to becomea weapon created by magic.”Alric Rahl watched her in silence for a moment more before quietly urging her onto the rest of the story. “So then he was able to deactivate it?”“Deactivate it?” She looked back over her shoulder at his grim gaze.“Unfortunately, no. He said that it was far too complex to safely dismantle sucha thing. He said that he didn’t even know if it was possible to deactivate it.”Lord Rahl rubbed his chin as he considered. “So it’s here, then?”She shook her head. “He took the spell with him to the Temple of the Winds sothat it could be safely locked away.”“The Temple of the Winds!” Lord Rahl let out a deep sigh of relief. “That’s thebest news I could have heard. And even better, with the team who created itdead, those in the Old World will not likely be making another.”“It would appear so. Baraccus eliminated the threat, so maybe we don’t stand onthe brink of annihilation after all.”He rested his palm on the hilt of his sword. “Did he say if he was able toterminate the power that had already been unleashed here, in the world of life?Was he able to eliminate those dream walkers that had already been brought intobeing?”Magda tapped a finger on a small side table inlaid with silver leaves as sherecalled her husband’s exact words.“Baraccus said, ‘We will have to deal with the ones they’ve already created, butat least they will be minting no new dream walkers and no more will be born intothe world. That magic is now safely locked away.’ Then he stared off and underhis breath added, ‘For now.’”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 “‘For now’? What did he mean by that?”Magda shook her head. “I don’t know. That was all he said. He was quiet anddistracted after he returned from the Temple of the Winds. I wasn’t even surethat he had intended for me to hear that last part of it.”What she remembered the most was the way he had held her for a long time, as ifshe were the most important thing in the world to him. She longed for the feelof his sheltering arms around her again. So why then, if he cared that much forher, and there were so many pivotal issues facing them, had he killed himself?Magda swallowed and tried to put the memory from her mind lest she beoverwhelmed by tears.“As I had hoped, Baraccus once again managed to accomplish the seeminglyimpossible and eliminated their ability to create more dream walkers.” Lord Rahlregarded her with a determined look. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t do anythingabout the ones that already exist. They are easily trouble enough to annihilateus. That element of the threat must be countered as well.”Magda knew the truth of that. Baraccus had told her that after a person had beenenclosed by that constructed spell, the power from it was fused into theirbeing, into their very souls. They were in part the same person, but now theywere more. They became beings with powers and abilities that others didn’tpossess and couldn’t defend against.From their name, Magda had at first thought that they were able to steal into aperson’s dreams while they slept, but Baraccus had explained that it was moresinister than that. They actually slipped into the infinitesimal empty spacesbetween thoughts, like water seeping into the voids of a sponge. It wasn’t thatthey used dreams to enter a person’s mind, it was more like they became thevictim’s real-life nightmare.Magda paced a few steps away, thinking, worrying. She hadn’t wanted to press herhusband for details when he had returned. She had been so thankful that he hadcome back safely to her that she had just wanted to hold him.She turned back. “Can a dream walker invade anyone’s mind?”“Technically, yes, however entering a person’s mind is profoundly difficult, so,to help them, dream walkers use the victim’s gift. In essence, they seizecontrol of a person’s own magic and turn it against them. Where dream walkersare concerned, having the gift is a dangerous liability.”“What about the ungifted, like me?”“It’s much more difficult for dream walkers to get into the mind of an ungiftedperson and even more difficult yet to control them. Not that it can’t be done,but it requires great effort. The real question is why would they want to? Afterall, dream walkers were created as weapons, so they would be expected to seekout high-value targets. That implies the gifted.”“That makes sense,” Magda said as she tried to put the pieces of what she knewtogether with what she was learning. “But the person would be aware of it,wouldn’t they? They would know the dream walker had invaded their thoughts.”“No, not necessarily. A dream walker can be in your mind, watching, listening,and unless they want you to know, you would be completely unaware of theirpresence. Once there, without you ever realizing it, the dream walker not onlyhas access to all your thoughts, he can also overhear anything you hear—plans,defenses, names, anything that might be useful to the enemy.“But if he wishes to, a dream walker can make his presence known and force youto do anything, or use you for any purpose he chooses. He can, for instance, useyou to help him identify other important targets. You would be helpless to stopyourself.“A dream walker often uses a seemingly harmless individual as an extension ofhimself, as a tool—in other words, as a surrogate assassin. People who aregentle or even timid offer a perfect cover. If he wants, a dream walker canforce even such a person to assassinate their closest friend or a loved one.“A dream walker’s control is absolute. He can remain hidden and you won’t evenknow he’s there, or be an insidious presence, whispering suggestions that youinterpret as your own thoughts. If he wishes it he can make his presence all tooclear by exerting complete control over your actions, or, as I’ve seen with myown eyes, give pain beyond imagining.”Magda folded her arms as she paced, her alarm growing by the moment. As shewalked past them, she cast a suspicious look at the two towering, silent guardsstanding with their broad backs to the doors. Their eyes rarely left her. Forall she knew, a dream walker could be in their minds.“Then they could be here in the Keep already. They could already know all ourdefenses, all our plans.” She tapped her temple. “For all we know, they could bein our minds right now, listening, watching, waiting to pounce.”Lord Rahl’s brow twisted with doubt. “I don’t think so. Dream walkers are newlycreated weapons. They haven’t had those abilities for very long. Imagine howdifficult it would be for someone newly turned into a dream walker to learn toaccomplish anything useful.”“What do you mean?”“Well, if you right now had the power to enter the mind of the enemy down in theOld World, how would you pick a useful person? Even if you knew the name of atarget, if you weren’t looking right at them how would you find that one personout of all the millions of minds down there? How would you know who to look for,or where they might be? How would you search for the one mind you wanted? If youwere trying to target enemy officials, how would you even know who they were?How would you identify them and then find them? Where would you look?”He shook his head. “It can’t be easy to establish the right links. I have nodoubt that they will soon enough be able to spread like a wildfire through ourranks—and through the Keep—but if we’re lucky we still have a bit of time.”“Time? Time for what? Dear spirits,” Magda said as she lifted her arms infrustration, “we’re helpless against them. What good is a bit of time going todo us? We really do stand at the brink of annihilation.”“Not entirely,” Lord Rahl said. “Baraccus’s task was to eliminate the source ofthe dream walkers. My part in this was to create a counter for the ones whoalready exist.”“But without a dream walker how will you know how their power functions, or besure what they’re capable of? For that matter, how can you know for certain thatany counter you create really works?”At that moment, at seeing the look that came into his eyes, Magda for the firsttime fully understood why this man was so feared. There was terrible resolvethere, and terrible conviction.“Because,” he said, “we captured one.”Magda was stunned into silence for a moment. “You actually captured a dreamwalker?” she finally asked. “Are you sure?”“Absolutely sure.”“How do you know he’s really a dream walker?”“There is no mistaking them. Looking into their eyes is like looking into anightmare. Their eyes are entirely black, black like that evil thing youdescribed that Baraccus showed you and then took with him to lock away in theunderworld. When a dream walker looks at you, clouded shapes shift across theinky black surface of their eyes, eyes so black that they seem as if they mightsuck the sunlight out of the day and turn the world into everlasting night.”“I remember well the black thing Baraccus showed me.” Magda rubbed her arms,unable to turn away from the look of bottled fury in Lord Rahl’s eyes. “Were youable to gain his cooperation, or learn anything useful from him?”The knuckles of his fists were white. “He killed a lot of my people, people Iloved, and he forced me to kill some of those innocent people he possessed lesthe kill me by their hand. He caused us a great deal of trouble, but in the end Iwas able to use him to unlock the secrets of their power.”Magda didn’t ask how he had gained the dream walker’s cooperation. It waswartime. They were in a struggle for their very existence. Every day lives werebeing lost in that struggle. Countless more innocent lives were at stake. Fromwhat she had heard, if there was one thing the D’Harans were good at, it wasknowing how to make people tell what they knew.“I had to devote a great many resources to the task,” he said, “but it wasnecessary and the results were worth it. I finally created a counter to blocktheir ability.”Magda wasn’t sure that she had heard him correctly. She took a step closer. “Youmean you can actually stop them?”Lord Rahl nodded. “I was able to construct a very complex spell that I actuallypropagated within myself. That magic is now part of who I am, a part of everyfiber of my being. In a way, I, too, have become more than I was before, muchlike the weapons we create out of people. That new ability now completelyshields my mind from the dream walkers.”She gripped his forearm. “You’re certain?”“Yes. I tested it on our dream walker.”“But how can you be certain that he wasn’t pretending that he couldn’t enteryour mind?”He arched an eyebrow. “With what was being done to him at the time, and for aslong as it was being done, I promise you, if he could have gotten into my mindto stop me, he would have.”“So the magic you created is our salvation, then.”“Yes and no.”She felt her hopes yet again slipping away. “What do you mean?”“I was able to create a counter to the dream walkers, and it works perfectly.The problem was that it only worked for me. I tried but I can’t re-create asimilar ability in others. It’s a power specific to me, to my inherent nature.”Magda’s heart sank. “So the rest of us are to remain at the mercy of the dreamwalkers.”“Not exactly. I finally succeeded in creating a way to protect other people aswell. Part of the ever-escalating balance of power I spoke of before. Those inthe Old World may have gotten a temporary advantage with the dream walkers, butI created a counter for them—and I now have a way for that counter to protectothers as well. I can check the enemy’s plans.”Magda eyed him suspiciously. “What’s the problem, then?”“The Central Council. Most of the D’Haran Lands have accepted the solution I’vecreated and are now safe from the dream walkers. We need the council to help usimplement the same protection here. That’s why I need you to speak with them.I’ve already tried to convince them of the danger we’re in and the necessity ofmy solution, but without Baraccus to lend his support they won’t listen to me.”Magda pressed her fingers to her forehead, frustrated that he still thought shecould somehow tell the council what to do. “If they won’t listen to the LordRahl, the leader of the D’Haran Lands, they certainly aren’t going to listen tome.”“They’ve listened to your arguments for several years and know that your appealsare always important and well reasoned. They’re used to having you speak beforethem. They’ve often gone along with your proposals. On the other hand, they’vealways been suspicious of me and aren’t inclined to listen with a open mind toanything I say.”“Lord Rahl, I wish it was otherwise, but I don’t think—”“If they won’t listen to you now about something this important, and they don’tdo what is needed, then the people of the Midlands will have no way to guardtheir minds.”Magda paused, struck by those words.They were close to the same words in the note.Be strong now, guard your mind . . .She wondered if that could possibly be what Baraccus had meant. She wondered ifhe had been trying to tell her about the dream walkers. But how could that havebeen what he meant?She felt an icy sense of unease as she remembered, then, the whispers in hermind urging her to jump off the wall.Was it possible?Dread welled up inside her. “What do people have to do to be protected? Whatsolution have you created?”“With the spell I forged, the spell that is now part of my being, I’m immune todream walkers entering my mind. But like I said, I can’t create that samecounter within other people. I tried, but it isn’t possible. So I insteadcreated a way to link others to my protective magic. That link shields them fromdream walkers entering their mind the same as I am protected.”“Are you sure? How is such a thing even possible?”“Everyone, even those like you who are ungifted, has a spark of the gift withinthem. That living spark enables everyone to interact with magic, even if theycan’t create it themselves. Through that flicker of the gift, anyone who acceptsme as their ruler becomes my subject and they are thus linked to me. We becomebonded. Them to me, and me to them. I become their magic against magic”—hegestured toward the two men watching from their position at the door—“and theyin turn protect me.”Magda blinked. “Do you mean to say that to be protected from dream walkers,people must swear loyalty to you?”“Yes and no. Sincere belief in my sovereignty over them is actually the linkthat powers the bond. In reality that’s all that’s needed. Swearing loyalty,though, helps a lot of hesitant minds fully commit.”“How can simply swearing loyalty possibly accomplish such a thing as poweringthis link to your ability?”“It’s not the swearing of loyalty that’s the real secret of it. It’s therealization—the conviction—that they are my subjects and I their sovereign rulerthat actually powers the spark of their gift to link to my magic. It has to besincere in order to connect them with the spell I carry within me. They don’thave to like it, but they have to accept the fact that I am their ruler.”“I just don’t understand—”“That’s always the problem, and we don’t have time to try to make peopleunderstand the nuanced intricacies of conjured links to constructed spells.” Hegestured irritably. “It’s complicated and hard to explain to people, even thegifted, even wizards. Fortunately, I’ve found that an oath serves to bring aboutacceptance, ignites the link, and forges the bond.”“An oath?”“Yes. All that is really necessary for the bond to work is the person’s solemnacceptance of my authority over them. But, like I say, the oath is a great dealsimpler and works in most cases. It’s nearly infallible if fear is acomponent—fear of dream walkers, or even fear of me. Fear triggers need, needpowers sincerity. Sincerity is the required element.“Once established, the bond becomes a kind of conduit, through the spark of thegift, that draws upon the constructed protection I have within me to protectthem as well. I worked long and hard to create an oath that fires the forge ofthat living link within the supplicant.”Magda stared up at the man. “And what is this oath?”“To be protected, people must swear as follows. Master Rahl guide us. MasterRahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In your light we thrive. In your mercy weare sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve. Our livesare yours.”Magda was stunned. “And you expect people to swear this oath to you?”“I’m trying to save their lives, Magda.” He gestured dismissively. “But callingit an oath does motivate some people to refuse, so I instead call it a devotion.Softens it a bit. I find that it works with near certitude if it is deliveredfrom a kneeling position, bent forward at the waist, forehead to the floor.Something about kneeling and swearing loyalty helps build fear and makes it realto the supplicant.”No wonder the council had rejected Lord Rahl’s plan.He was asking them to help him rule the entire New World."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 From the things her husband had told her in the past and from what she hadlearned from Alric Rahl, Magda was coming to fully grasp the mortal danger theywere in. It was only a matter of time until the dream walkers learned to usetheir abilities to find their way into the minds of those in the Wizard’s Keep.If something wasn’t done to protect people, such an event would be the beginningof the end.Not only was the Keep the seat of power in the Midlands, it was in many waysalso its heart and soul. The council lived and worked there, but so didrepresentatives from various lands along with military officers, administrators,and officials of every sort. Perhaps even more important, while vast armiesalong with gifted support clashed in the field, some of their most brilliantwizards lived at the Keep, working on everything from counters to the weaponsbeing created in the Old World to new weapons of their own.Those gifted down in the lower reaches of the Keep worked day and night, many insecret, on things that Baraccus rarely talked about. Magda remembered Tilly’schilling gossip about some of the projects. While Magda didn’t necessarilybelieve everything Tilly said, she knew that it likely wasn’t far off the mark.If the council didn’t go along with Alric Rahl’s plan, and the gifted didn’tcome up with a counter of their own, the New World would be lost.But on the other hand, it meant making Alric Rahl more than a mere king. Itmeant making him the ruler of the entire New World. It meant allowing him tocreate an empire and make himself its ruler.Even if Magda could influence the council, would she want to be a part of such athing? Would Baraccus have wanted her to?She remembered, then, being up on the wall earlier that same day, seemingly in afog, preparing to throw herself to her death. Even though it had only been hoursago, it was beginning to feel more like a dream in the dim past.Had she really been serious? Had she really, in her heart, wanted to die? Tokill herself? Of course she was still heartbroken and the future still seemedbleak, but not in quite the same way.She remembered the whispers urging her to jump.Was it possible?If it was true . . .Her mouth felt as dry as dust.“I see what you mean, Lord Rahl.” Magda laced her fingers together as she pacedoff a few steps, trying to come to grips with the enormity of everything thathad happened. In the last few days her life had been turned upside down.Everything had changed. Despite the uncertainty of the war, her husband had beenher security. Now, there was no more security. Now, she had only herself to relyon.“Then you must act,” Alric Rahl said. “You must do your best to convince thecouncil to help me protect the Midlands from the dream walkers.”Magda, staring off into the dark end of the room where the glow of thecandlelight hardly penetrated, finally turned back. She looked up at his grimconcern.“You’re right. I don’t know if I can convince them to listen to me, but I haveto try. I must find a way to get the council to go along. We have truth on ourside. Maybe I can make them see that and make them see that they must act forthe good of us all.”He let out a deep sigh as he nodded. “Thank you, Magda. Let us hope that you canconvince the council. It may be our only chance.”But then pain slammed into her so abruptly, so unexpectedly, so violently thatit took her breath.Magda’s muscles locked stiff as the searing pain ignited in her head. It felt asif half a dozen hot needles were all at the same time being thrust into herears, through her temples, and up into the base of her skull.A razor-sharp spike of pain lanced into the nerves just below her ears as if yetmore of the searing-hot needles were being thrust in right behind her jaw oneither side. Her eyes watered and her mouth opened wide, but she couldn’t make ascream. She couldn’t draw a breath. The weight of the terrible agony locked hermuscles rigid.Lord Rahl frowned. “Magda?”She could see the puzzled concern on his face, but she couldn’t speak to tellhim what was happening. She wanted to scream, but she couldn’t do that, either.Mostly, she wanted to somehow make the unexpected, savage pain stop.She couldn’t endure it for another moment. As much as she wanted to live, shewelcomed death if only it would bring her release.In that helpless, desolate instant, she knew.The initial violence of the pain unexpectedly eased up just a bit. She didn’tknow if it was a depraved game, or if the crushing hurt was going to ram back inat her again with even more force. In that brief break, Magda gasped a breath.Before she could cry out, the pain slammed into her again, but with immenselymore force than the first time. She hadn’t thought it possible for it to hurtmore, but it did. The startling power of it left her senseless.Staggered, she began to lose her awareness of where she was. Her skull felt asif it were being slowly crushed.A powerful blow came out of nowhere like a bolt of lightning, striking her inthe middle, doubling her over. Her muscles strained against a force squeezingher chest. She heard snapping and felt her ribs break, sending yet another kindof pain ripping through her.In insufferable torment, her eyes wide, she saw Lord Rahl rushing toward her,yet his movements seemed impossibly slow. He almost looked to be a statue,unable to make any headway. At the slow, dreamlike rate at which he appeared tobe moving, she didn’t think he would reach her before she was dead.She felt something warm and wet running from her ears and down along her jaw.She saw bright blood splattering on the stone floor under her.Magda dropped heavily to her knees.Her vision narrowed to a dark tunnel. Everything seemed far away. She thoughtshe heard voices but she couldn’t make them out over the piercing, painful,high-pitched noise she was hearing.Just at the dark edge of her restricted vision, she saw Lord Rahl’s two bigguards draw their swords as they, too, started toward her. She knew that theynow saw her as a threat.The blood running from her ears and dripping from her chin merged into a wet,red pool on the floor beneath her. She could feel the wet warmth soaking herknees and dress.Through the stunning torment, through the paralyzing pain spiking down throughher head and ripping up through her abdomen, Magda, like the guards, realizedwhat was happening. As disoriented as she was, she was all too aware of thealien presence roaring out from the dark corners of her mind.If the thing within didn’t kill her, the guards surely would. Magda recognizedthat she had only precious moments to live.With that awareness, she realized how desperately she didn’t want to die.Despite how much she wanted the pain to stop, she didn’t want to die. She hadnever felt so strongly about wanting to live. But she could feel herselfslipping ever closer to the dark rim of the underworld.Magda remembered then her husband’s last words on the note in her pocket.Be strong now, guard your mind, and live the life that only you can live.Lord Rahl was right there, right before her, his boots in her blood. He wasleaning down, his hands on her shoulders as he yelled something.She couldn’t hear him. She could hear only the ripping howl of pain in her ears.Magda clutched Lord Rahl’s pant legs in her fists as the pain darkened hervision, threatening to blind her. She knew that in brief moments she would notonly lose her vision, she would lose consciousness. She knew that she had onlythose brief seconds before everything was lost to her.She could hear Alric Rahl above her yelling urgently, but she couldn’t make outthe distant words. She could feel his powerful fingers grasping her shoulders ashe leaned over her.She knew that this was her only chance.But she didn’t know if she could summon the strength.“Master Rahl . . .” she managed in a hoarse voice. Blood dripped from her lips.She could taste it in her mouth.Terror tightened her throat. Her heartbeats came weaker and weaker. She knewthat she was about to die. She could feel the glimmer of life itself slippingaway. It seemed too much effort to hold on to it.It was even too much effort to draw another breath.Some part of her, though, desperately didn’t want to surrender to the lure ofrelease.Magda summoned all her remaining strength and gasped in a last breath.With her lungs filled by that last gasp at life, she forced herself on in adesperate rush, giving herself over to the words, giving herself over to theirmeaning.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.”She put her heart and soul into the words. “We live only to serve. Our lives areyours.”Darkness passed through her, shadowing her soul. She thought that it must be toolate.But then the pain abruptly lost its hold on her.Magda, panting in relief as the full force of crushing torment released her,crumpled to the ground, weeping in lingering agony and sweet gratitude forBaraccus’s words of guard your mind.They had just saved her life.Baraccus had just saved her life.Lord Rahl had just saved her life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 Free of the alien presence, but still in agony, Magda lay in a warm, velvetypool of her own blood. The pain in her head, still radiating into her ears anddown through her jaw, was horrific. As much as she hurt, though, she wasprofoundly thankful that it was at least not the same kind of agony as thecrushing pain the dream walker had been inflicting from within.As much as she didn’t want to suffer the pain of being touched, she didn’t havethe power to offer much resistance as Lord Rahl and his two bodyguards gentlyrolled her over. She cried out at the torture of being moved. She could feelbroken ribs grate together with each shallow breath.“Easy, now,” Lord Rahl said in a surprisingly gentle voice as big hands caughther weakly flailing arms. “It’s going to be all right. You have to be still,though. Don’t try to get up.”In a daze, Magda was only dimly aware of where she was and what was happening.It seemed like it all was happening to someone else and she was only watchingit. Her whole body throbbed in terrible pain. But even that, too, in an odd wayseemed strangely distant.“At least that bastard is gone from her now,” one of the big guards said.Lord Rahl grunted his agreement before looking down at her. “It’s going to beall right, Magda. I’m going to help you.”Magda nodded. She didn’t really know why. She had to swallow back the blood inher mouth.Lord Rahl leaned in closer over her. He had the strangest look in his eyes.Magda realized, then, that it was fear.At seeing that look, at comprehending that it was fear for her, she started topanic. With a firm grip on her shoulders, he forced her back down.“Listen to me, Magda. You need to be still. Don’t fight it. Let me do that.”She tried to ask what he meant, but the words came out in a jumble that even shecouldn’t understand.He smiled just a bit. “No need to talk anymore. You got the right words out whenyou needed them.” He patted her shoulder. “You’re safe from the dream walker,now.”Magda sagged in relief. At least that monster was gone from her mind. She hadfelt that evil presence for only a brief time, but it was something she knew shewould never be able to forget. Tears of gratitude at being free of the dreamwalker ran across her cheeks. Even if she had to endure the lingering effects ofhis attack, even if she was to die, she was at least free of his vile presence.“I need to get into your mind, Magda—”She had just escaped that very thing. She didn’t want anyone in her mind everagain. She didn’t want to have anyone controlling her in that way. In a panic atthe thought of it, she thrashed, trying to escape his grip.“Listen to me,” he said as he held both of her wrists firmly in one of his bighands. “It will only be to heal the damage. You’re still losing a lot of blood.I have to hurry. You have to let me help you. Just lie still and don’t fight me,all right? Can you do that? Can you trust me? It will be easier if you do.”This was a chance at life. This was a chance to be pulled back from thatterrifying dark void. She had fought for her life. She couldn’t let herself slipbeyond the veil. At last, she let the tension go from her muscles and nodded.“Thank you, Master Rahl,” she managed with the greatest of effort.He offered a brief smile before putting his hands to either side of her head.His hands muffled the distant sounds of the world, muffled what she only thenrealized was the sounds of her own sobs.She looked up at him, and his blue eyes reminded her of looking up into a bluesky. As she stared, unable to blink, she was drawn into that calming color. Hiseyes became the sky. She felt herself falling into that azure forever thatbecame sapphire that became cobalt that became midnight blue that became simplymidnight.She felt the weight of his power press in on her mind as the cold flood of hismagic cascaded down through her whole being.She had been healed by Baraccus before, but that had been for relatively minorthings—a deep cut, a twisted ankle, a crippling headache—so she recognized theunique feel of Additive Magic. What in those instances had been a trickle wasnow a massive icy torrent overwhelming her with its power.Even more, though, she felt the red-hot touch of what she knew had to beSubtractive Magic. She imagined that he was removing residual traces of thedamage done by the dream walker’s presence.She gasped at the sudden, sharp, searing heat deep inside her ears. She recoiledat the smell of burning flesh, realizing that he must be cauterizing the woundsto stop the bleeding.Even though she felt lost in a strange, empty place, she knew that she was notalone. He was there with her, working, trying to help her. It was something likewhen the dream walker had made himself known in her mind, but at the same timeit was the opposite side of that alien presence. The dream walker, she knew, shecould feel, had been malicious and had fully intended harm.This, by contrast, was a benevolent presence. Despite the pain pulling her everdownward inside herself, she could feel that his purpose was only to help her,only to eventually be able to lift her pain away.She could feel every thread of Additive Magic stitching through her torn musclesand broken ribs. It didn’t exactly hurt, but the odd sensation made her queasy.She wanted to squirm away, yet she knew that this was her only chance and so shesurrendered to it. The warm power seeping deep into her ears was equallyuncomfortable.At the same time, she was aware of him trying to force her to let him lift theagony away. Magda resisted, holding on tight. She didn’t want anyone else,especially Master Rahl, to have to feel the agony she felt. She clutched ittight, trying to shield him from the full force of the suffering.It did no good. He was stronger than she was. With a fearful sense of concernfor his safety, she felt the pain’s grasp slipping from her. With thatimpediment lifted away, his gift was able to twist down through her inner being,going deeper into her core in order to heal her.As she felt the last of that icy agony stripped away, she reveled in the mercyof being free of it and at last began to feel the warmth of his healing magicwarming her.She hung suspended in that glowing warmth, only distantly aware that anythingelse existed but that comforting support.Magda lost all sense of time. She didn’t know how long she floated in that placeof serenity. It could have been mere moments, or it could have been days. Inthat silent void, time lost all meaning. In that strange inner place, timeceased to exist.Gently, she became aware that it had ended.Her eyes at last opened and the room around her came into focus. She realizedthat she was lying on a couch. Lord Rahl stood over her, his brow beaded withsweat. He looked exhausted.The candles on the iron stand nearby were burned down to nubs. She knew, then,that it had lasted most of the night.Magda reached up and touched her ear, letting her fingers trail down along herjaw. It didn’t hurt anymore.Her chest didn’t ache inside, either. She placed her hand on her ribs, testing.They were sound and no longer hurt.But there was more. While she still missed Baraccus, still hurt that he wasgone, it was different, now. The pain of losing him wasn’t so crushing as it hadbeen. She still grieved, still felt the suffering of the loss, but sherecognized that the sharpest edges of that misery were now softened just a bit.She would always miss her husband, always love him, but she knew, now, that shewas going to be able to go on. She had to go on.“Thank you,” she whispered up at Lord Rahl.He showed her a weary smile. “I would suggest that you rest, but I fear that wecan’t afford the time right now.”Magda sat up, wiping at her eyes, getting her bearings. “Is it still night?”His smile widened. “It’s a new day, Magda. Has been for a while now.”“Then we need to get to the council chambers. They will be in session. I need toconvince them of the imminent danger. They must act.”Lord Rahl glanced down at her clothes. “Maybe you had best get cleaned up,first.”Magda stood, feeling remarkably steady. She had expected to at least still feelwobbly, but she didn’t. She felt alive. Really alive.She looked down at her dress. Large areas of it were soaked with blood. He wasright, she needed to change. She touched her hair and found that it, too, wasmatted with dried blood. She glanced over at her reflection in a small mirror onthe wall. Blood stained the sides of her face and neck.“I guess I do look a shocking mess. I had better clean up, first, before we goto see the council.”Alric Rahl nodded as he gestured at his two big bodyguards. “We’ll wait outsidewhile you change and wash up.”Magda caught his arm as he started to turn toward the door.“No.”He frowned. “No?”“No. I want the council to see me like this. They need to see the reality of theblood that will be shed by our people at the hands of the dream walkers if theyrefuse to listen.”Lord Rahl smiled. “I don’t think that the council has yet ever reallyencountered the true resolve of Magda Searus.”She returned a haunted smile. “They are about to.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 Magda kept her eyes straight ahead as she marched past towering, polished blackmarble columns to each side of the gallery leading toward the council chambers.Rounded moldings covered in gold atop the columns supported a thick architravecarved with robed figures meant to represent the members of the council.A gridwork of golden squares overspread the long, vaulted ceiling. Each squareheld a bronze medallion with a scene of a different place in the Midlands.Supposedly, as council members passed through the gallery they were walkingbeneath a grand display of the diversity of the Midlands so that they would bereminded to be mindful of all the far-flung people they represented as they wentabout their official deliberations. In Magda’s experience, it took more thanbronze medallions to remind the council to be mindful of all the far-flungplaces of the Midlands.Magda passed beneath a line of long red silk banners hanging from the vaultedceiling. They were meant to represent the blood that had been shed in defense ofthe people of the Midlands. The carpet she walked along, with the names ofbattles woven along the edges, was also red and meant to be a reminder of thestruggles fought and the lives laid down so that others might live.Magda usually found passing through the gallery to be a somber experience. Onthis day, it was more somber than usual.The red banners and crimson carpet only served to help draw attention to theblood covering Magda. More than ever before, she felt a connection to those whohad bled in defense of their motherland. If the council refused to listen toher, then a great deal more blood would be shed.As she marched down the long carpet, men to the sides paused in midconversationto stare openly. Women moved back. The drone of talking withered to whispers andthen people fell silent as she passed, leaving a hush in her wake.As she entered the great rotunda not far from the council chambers, Magda sawsmall clusters of people all through the enormous room standing around talking,no doubt discussing matters waiting to be brought before the council. Theconversation echoing around the room tapered off as people watched her advancethrough their midst, trailed by the Lord Rahl of the D’Haran Lands and his twohuge bodyguards.Overhead, the high windows around the lower border of the golden dome let inearly-morning sunlight to bathe the towering reddish marble pillars around theedge of the room in harsh light. Between the columns, against the stone wall,stood imposing statues of past leaders.Magda knew that one day a statue of Baraccus would take up a place of honor inthis room leading to the Central Council.It was a strange thought that touched her with pride, yet at the same timeserved to highlight how Baraccus was slipping inexorably into her past.It wouldn’t be long before Baraccus became a figure left to history. Peoplewould no longer come to know him, they would only know bits and pieces abouthim. She wondered if the stories people in the future learned would bear anyresemblance to the reality she had known with Baraccus. History, like memoriesthemselves, tended to become distorted with the passing of time, or worse,corrupted with the agendas of those writing it.As much as she wished it were otherwise, Magda could do nothing to alter thepast or to bring Baraccus back. He was now in the hands of the good spirits.Meanwhile, life went on. He had wanted her to go on.The great mahogany doors to the council chambers stood open, as they usuallydid. The doors were three times her height and as thick as her thigh, both sidescarved in intricate designs meant to represent spells, although they were notactually spells. As Baraccus had often told her, drawing out real spells wasdangerous. The intention was to remind all that it was the gift that guided themin everything.The open doors were meant to convey a sense of the council’s openness, but Magdaknew that it was an illusion of receptivity. Where the council was concerned,nothing was as simple as it seemed.At the great doors, the guards posted to either side, their pikes standingperfectly upright, saw that she didn’t intend to stop. Their pikes tilted asthey hesitantly stepped away from their positions onto the great seal set intothe stone before the doors.One of the guards lifted a hand out, thinking she needed assistance. “LadySearus, you’re hurt. Let me get someone to help you.”“Thank you, but the members of the council are the only ones who can help any ofus.”“I’m afraid that they’re in session,” he warned.“Good,” she said as she pushed his pike up out of her way.“Lady Searus,” the other guard said, “I’m afraid that the agenda is full fortoday and they are not taking up any new business.”“They are now,” she said on her way past.The guards weren’t sure what they should do. They knew her quite well as thewife of the First Wizard who often spoke to the council. But even though theyknew her, they were not accustomed to women with short hair walking in to speakto the council. More importantly, though, she was covered in blood and theydidn’t know why. If the Keep was under attack, they clearly needed to know aboutit, but then, so did the council.Other guards inside the council chambers started to close in to slow her untilthey could find out what was going on. They took in Lord Rahl and his two menbehind her. Confused by the sight of the First Wizard’s wife covered with blood,to say nothing of the leader of the D’Haran Lands accompanying her, they finallyparted, apparently thinking that stopping her could potentially be more troublethan letting her through. Not only was Lord Rahl a dignitary, but it was thecouncil, after all, that decided who would speak.Magda was glad that she had told Lord Rahl to leave his small army waiting inthe corridors farther back and out of sight. Having a force of armed men try toenter the council chambers would only have complicated matters.Once inside the big doors and past the knot of guards, she turned back to AlricRahl. She put her hand on his chest to urge him to a halt.“Why don’t you wait back here? Your presence beside me will only make them thinkthat I ask this on your behalf.”His brow creased with displeasure as he stared off at the council on the dais inthe distance at the far end of the room. He shifted his weight and hooked histhumbs on his belt.His blue eyes finally turned down to her. “As you wish.”Magda offered him a brief smile before she turned her attention to the room shehad visited many times. A runner of blue and gold carpet leading off toward thecouncil split the grand room. Fluted mahogany columns supported soaring archesto the sides. Leaded windows high up in the arches let in muted streamers ofsunlight. Below the windows, balcony galleries held seating for observers. Theseats were packed, which told her that the council was not dealing in restrictedmilitary matters.The open floor beneath the balconies had no windows, making it a rather dark andgloomy place. The windows up high were meant to represent the light of theCreator, while the darker regions down below were a reminder of the eternaldarkness of the afterlife in the underworld. It was a subtle reminder of theforces of nature, life and death being the most notable, that always had to beheld in balance.Groups of people who had come for an audience with the council crowded the floorfarther off to each side, beneath the shadows of the balconies. As was often thecase, there were military men in dress uniforms with clusters of staff aroundthem, officials in dignified robes with color-coded bands to denote rank andposition, wizards and sorceresses in simple robes, and aides accompanyingwell-dressed, important women. As in most places in the Keep, there were evenchildren here and there with their parents.The sunlight slanting in through the windows high to the right revealed a slighthaze from men smoking pipes as well as the dust that the constant trafficcarried into the vast room. As she marched down the blue and gold carpet andthrough isolated patches of sunlight from windows that had been designed to letthe light penetrate down to the center runner, no one could miss Magda’sblood-soaked dress. She knew from seeing herself in mirrors that her face andhair were quite a sight as well.Despite the relatively hushed quiet of the room, out in the world a war raged.Baraccus had confided that the fighting was horrific. Men died by the thousandsin desperate battles, their bodies torn apart in the mad rush to attack ordefend. The fury, the panic, the blood, the noise, the desperation were said tobe beyond imagining.In contrast, the vast room where the council went about its stately work was anordered and dignified place where business was conducted at a measured pace.Panic, blood, and naked desperation seemed very far away.Magda knew that it was an illusion. While everyone worked very hard to preservethe appearance that this place was the balance to the madness of the war, thatwar was on every mind.As in the outer halls, people quietly discussing business fell silent as theyspotted Magda marching resolutely along the long ribbon of carpeting through thecenter of the chamber. Most of these people knew her. Most of them had seen herstanding before the flames that had consumed her husband and their belovedleader. Many had come to her to offer their condolences.Atop the dais, the council sat at a long, ornate desk that curved around in ahalf circle. Staff and assistants sat at the desk beside them. Even more satbehind. People stood in the center of the dais, with that desk curving halfwayaround them and the audience at their back, to be heard by the council.Magda recognized the woman standing in that spot, speaking passionately to thecouncil. Her words trailed off as she looked over her shoulder to see Magda stepup behind her.The woman first quickly took in the length of Magda’s hair and then scowled downat her bloody clothes. “I don’t appreciate being interrupted when I amaddressing the council.”“I’m talking to them now, Vivian,” Magda said as she showed the woman a verybrief smile. “You can speak to them later.”Vivian pulled a long lock of hair forward over her shoulder. “What makes youthink that you can—”“Leave,” Magda said in a voice so calm, so quiet, so deadly that Vivianflinched.When the woman made no move to leave, Magda leaned even closer and spoke in aconfidential tone that no one else could hear.“Either you walk out now, Vivian, or you will have to be carried out. I thinkyou know that I’m not bluffing.”At seeing the look in Magda’s eyes, Vivian turned and dipped a quick bow to thecouncil before hurrying away.A hush fell over the room.“What is the meaning of this interruption?” a red-faced Councilman Weston asked.“What matter could be important enough for you to dare to think you can intrudein this fashion?”Magda clasped her hands. “A matter of life and death.”Behind her, whispers rippled through the room.“Life and death? What are you talking about?” Weston demanded.Magda met the gaze of each councilman, now that one of them had made the mistakeof inviting her to speak on the subject.“The dream walkers are in the Keep.” "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 The room erupted with noise and confusion as everyone behind Magda startedtalking at once. Some people yelled questions. Others called out theirdisbelief. Yet others shouted denunciations. Many, gripped by fear, remainedsilent.Elder Cadell, ever the arbiter of decorum in the council chambers, held up agnarled, arthritic hand, calling for silence.When the crowd quieted, Councilman Weston went on. “Dream walkers? Here in theKeep?” His eyes narrowed. “That’s absurd.”Elder Cadell ignored Weston’s charge. “Lady Searus,” he said with practicedpatience, “first of all, the council is in session and—”“Good,” Magda said, not at all patient. “That means I don’t have to hunt you alldown. Better that you are all gathered to hear this. Time is short.”Councilman Guymer shot to his feet. “You have no standing to speak before thisbody much less to interrupt us! How dare you dismiss someone who was speaking onimportant matters and—”“Whatever matter Vivian was wound up about this time can wait. I told you, thisis a matter of life and death. I was just invited by Councilman Weston to speak.I intend to do so.” She arched an eyebrow. “Unless you want to have me draggedaway before I can make known the mortal danger to our people as well as how thecouncil can help to protect them?”Assistants shared looks. Some of the councilmen shifted uncomfortably in theirchairs. Not all of them wanted to so publicly silence her before she couldreveal what the council could do to help to protect people. That reluctance gaveher a window of opportunity.Councilman Hambrook leaned back and clasped his hands together over his amplemiddle. “Dream walkers, you say?”Guymer shot to his feet and turned his wrath on his fellow councilman.“Hambrook, we’re not going to be diverted from our agenda to allow thisoutrageous interruption to continue!”Magda closed the distance to the desk in three long strides, placed her hands onthe polished wood, and with a glare, leaned toward Councilman Guymer.“Sit down.”Taken aback by the calm fury in her voice, and somewhat stunned to be spoken toin such a way, he dropped into his chair.Magda straightened. “Dream walkers have made their way into the Keep. We must—”This time it was Weston, to her right, who interrupted her. “Disregarding yourbursting in here in such an insolent fashion, what makes you think we wouldbelieve such a claim?”Magda slammed the flat of her hand on the desk before the man. The shock of theloud smack made all of them jump. She could feel her face going red with rage.“Look at me! This is what a dream walker did to me! What you see—the blood allover me—is what your countrymen and loved ones are going to look like beforethey die in unimaginable agony! This is what is coming for all of us!”“I am not going to sit here and—”“Let her speak,” Elder Cadell said with quiet authority.Magda bowed her head to the elder in appreciation before collecting herself andgoing on. “A dream walker entered my mind without my being aware of it. I don’tknow how long he was hidden there. I fear to think what he overheard while hewas lurking in my mind without my knowledge.”“What could he have overheard?” Councilman Sadler asked in a suspicious tone.“For one thing, the reason I was coming here today: the solution to prevent thedream walkers from having free run of the Keep and destroying us all. Once heheard that solution, and knew that I was going to come here for the council’shelp in implementing it, he acted. His intent was to kill me so that I couldn’tspeak to you. His intent was to keep you in the dark so that we would all bevulnerable.”As Magda looked at each councilman in turn, out of the corner of her eye shecould see the crowd moving in closer so that they wouldn’t miss what she had tosay. She straightened and stepped back to the center of the semicircle ofcouncilmen so that she could make sure that everyone could hear her.“While I don’t have any idea how long the dream walker was hidden there in mymind, watching, listening, his presence became all too obvious once he decidedto rip me apart from the inside.” She slowly shook her head as she turned herback on the council to look out into the frightened eyes of all the silentpeople watching her. “You cannot imagine the pain of it.”The spectators stared in silent anxiety.Weston broke the silence. “Do you expect us to trust—”“No,” she said without looking back at him. “I expect you to look with your owneyes at the result of what was being done to me by the dream walker who hadslipped into my mind, here, in the Keep, where we thought we were safe. We arenot safe.” She held out the skirt of her dress. “As I fell to my knees, dying,blood running from my ears, blood choking me, I could feel the dream walkerbreak each rib, one at a time.” Some in the crowd gasped. “The pain was beyondendurance, yet there is no way to avoid enduring it.”She walked slowly across the dais to be sure that everyone out in the crowd, aswell as all those behind the desk, could get a good look at the blood all overher. The sound of her shoes on the wooden floor of the rostrum echoed throughthe room.“The blood you see all over me,” she said, “is the evidence of the torture hewas inflicting. If it is shocking to see, I promise you, you would not havewanted to hear my screams as I lay in a pool of my own blood and on the brink ofdeath.”“And so I guess that the good spirits swept in and saved you at the lastmoment?” Councilman Guymer asked, bringing a smattering of laughter.“No,” she calmly answered as she gazed out at the crown. “Though I prayed theywould, the good spirits did not come to my rescue. I saved myself.”“And how, may I ask, did you do that,” Sadler asked, fingers skyward, “if thedream walkers are in fact such fearsome beings?”“You’re right. They are fearsome. They are also powerful. But I invoked magiceven more powerful and as a result I was protected from the dream walkers.”“You are not gifted,” Guymer scoffed.“You don’t have to be gifted to be protected,” she said out to the crowdwatching, addressing them rather than the council. “You must choose, though, toaccept the solution. At the last moment before I was about to die, I came tounderstand that, and I chose to do what was needed to save myself.“That’s why I’m here. I want all of our people to know that there is protectionfor them, for all of them. Believe me, the dream walkers can steal into theminds of anyone and they will show no mercy. But none of you need fear them.None of you needs to suffer and die.”“And how do you know that you really are protected?” Guymer asked.“If I wasn’t protected, the dream walkers would have torn me apart where I stoodso they could prevent me from coming here to tell you how to protect yourselvesand our people from their abilities.”Concerned chatter rippled through the room. People among the onlookers shoutedout over the noise, wanting to know what was needed to be protected from thedream walkers.Magda let the worry build for a time before she finally lifted her arm, pointingto the back of the room near the great doors. Everyone turned to look where shepointed.“There stands Lord Rahl, the key to your survival,” she said in a voice loudenough that all could hear her. “He alone created a protection that shields himfrom the dream walkers. That protection constructed of magic is powerful enoughto protect anyone bonded to him.”“Lord Rahl!” Guymer shouted. “Not that nonsense again! Lord Rahl has alreadycome before us with his plans to rule the world.”Magda turned a glare on the man. “And since when is toiling to protect your lifeand the lives of all the other innocent people of the Midlands as well as theD’Haran Lands interpreted as wanting to rule the world?”“This is about the oath he insists we must swear to him, isn’t it?” Elder Cadellasked.Magda spread her hands. “We are all on the same side in this. We of the Midlandsand those of the D’Haran Lands share a common interest as well as a commonthreat. Those in the Old World want to subjugate all of the New World. Theydon’t care about our internal boundaries. They want to rule us all. If they win,there will be no Midlands, no D’Haran Lands. We will all be either dead or theirslaves. This is about our survival, not petty matters of rule.”“Petty?” Sadler asked. “I don’t see bowing to the rule of Lord Rahl as petty.”“You will think it petty enough,” Magda said, “if a dream walker silently slipsinto your mind and becomes your master, if he makes you do his vile bidding.They can make you betray those you care about, even kill people you love. Ifyou’re lucky, that master will choose instead to rip you apart from the inside.”Sadler licked his lips but didn’t speak up to argue.The whispers in the crowd fell silent as a man who had been watching from theshadows at the back of the room behind the councilmen stepped out into thelight.It was Prosecutor Lothain. His menacing gaze was fixed on Magda."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 Lothain’s smile looked every bit as deadly as a skeleton’s grin. “And how do youknow, Lady Searus, that it was not really Alric Rahl’s own magic that was infact tearing you apart from the inside, as you put it?”“Lord Rahl’s magic?” Magda gaped at the man. “Why would he do such a thing?”Lothain arched an eyebrow. The grace of his smile, as mocking as it had been,vanished. “Perhaps for the exact reason that brings you to stand before us—tohave you put on a show to frighten people into going along with his scheme toseize power and become the leader of all of the New World.”He stood as motionless as a rock, challenging her to deny it.“That is not what is happening.” Magda wished her own voice didn’t sound soinadequate and defensive.“Because your husband had convinced you that Alric Rahl was to be trusted?”Magda blinked. She didn’t want to agree with the man, but she had to saysomething. She pulled herself up straighter.“My husband told me of the very real danger from the dream walkers. As a warwizard he knew all too well exactly what they are capable of. Like everyoneelse, I have for years admired Baraccus’s knowledge and wisdom. He was, afterall, named First Wizard because of the respect in which he was held. As FirstWizard, he had a great deal of trust in Alric Rahl. They were both fighting onthe same side in this war. They both have fought from the beginning to keep allour people from being slaughtered.”Lothain smiled just a bit, as if he had caught her in a slip of the tongue. “Itwould appear by your own admission that your husband carefully shaped yourthinking in a great many areas.” He stroked a finger across the stubble on hischin as he took a few slow strides toward her. “Are you saying, then, that yourhusband was all along a secret party to Alric Rahl’s plot to rule the New World?Perhaps that was the reason for your husband’s secret dealings and covertmidnight meetings with strangers?”Magda’s hands fisted at her sides. This time she had no trouble bringing powerto her voice.“My husband has from the beginning fought this long war for no reason other thanto protect us all.”“This long war that we are losing.”“Your accusations are as insulting as they are groundless.”Lothain bowed his head. “Your loyalty to your husband is admirable, Lady Searus.But it is to be expected.”“This is all quite beside the point,” Elder Cadell said. “Motives aside, we havebeen through all of this before quite exhaustively and in the end we made ourdecision to decline Lord Rahl’s offer.”Magda closed the distance to the elder sitting at the imposing center of thecouncil’s desk. “But things have changed. There is no time to waste. The dreamwalkers are here, now, in the Keep.”“No one is doubting that you may in fact believe that,” Prosecutor Lothain saidfrom behind her. “However, even though there may be those who are inclined totrust your sincerity in what you believe, it is the truth of that belief that isin question. Dream walkers will no doubt pose a threat at some point in thefuture but when they do I would expect that they will come after importanttargets.”Magda rounded on the prosecutor and held out her bloodstained arms. “They cameafter me!”Lothain smiled dismissively. “At such a great distance from down in the OldWorld, how would a dream walker know of you, or find you, and more to the point,why would they bother with you? But Alric Rahl was in the Keep, right there inthe room with you, and he had motive enough to want to make you believe it was adream walker who was attacking you.”“That’s absurd,” she said. “The dream walkers are real and a threat.”“Of course they are,” Elder Cadell said. “But in any event, we have decided onour own solution to protect our people.”“Your own solution?” Magda’s brow twitched into a frown as she rounded on theelder. “Surely you don’t mean the towers?”Councilman Weston, to the side of the elder, leaned forward, his hand clenchinginto a fist on the desk. “We don’t need to hear your skepticism of a matter thatis the council’s concern and not a topic meant for public discussion.”Magda knew that, for obvious reasons, they would of course want to keep the truenature of the project a secret. Baraccus had never agreed to the proposal, or tokeeping the plan a secret. He thought that if the situation was grave enough,the idea was something that would reluctantly have to be considered, but hethought it had to be considered publicly. Apparently others thought so as well.As a result, the tower proposal was one of the worst-kept secrets in all ofAydindril.“We have a solution and we are working on it,” Elder Cadell said in histypically calm tone of authority. “That is all that matters here.”Shocked, Magda paused only briefly. “Do you mean to say that you’ve actuallygone ahead with the plan? You began implementing it without Baraccus’sknowledge?”“The First Wizard had his own responsibilities; this was under ourjurisdiction.” Elder Cadell gestured, glossing over the question. “Oncecompleted, the towers will not only protect us from the dream walkers, they willseal away the Old World and protect us from anything that the enemy gifted mightcreate and send to destroy us. The towers are not a partial solution such asLord Rahl proposes. They are a complete solution that will not only protect usfrom all manner of onslaughts, they will seal us off from the Old World and endthe war.”She knew that he was making a statement for public consumption. In so doing, hewas only revealing the virtuous aspects of a monstrous idea.“If it’s even possible to complete them,” she said.“They will be completed,” a glowering Councilman Guymer said, dismissing theconcern.Magda was horrified. She looked back at Elder Cadell. “But the towers would meanthe death of untold numbers of our wizards.”“It is a price that must be paid,” he said. “It will end the war.”Magda was incredulous. “At what cost? How many thousands of our best andbrightest will you condemn to death to create your towers?”Looking down at the desktop, Cadell scratched an eyebrow. “They will bevolunteers.”“Volunteers?”“Yes.” The elder frowned as he looked into her eyes. “Your husband in hiscapacity as First Wizard did much the same thing, did he not? Didn’t he choosevolunteers from among the most talented of the gifted to go to the Temple of theWinds in the underworld? When each failed to return, he sent another, and thenanother. Baraccus knew that he was likely sending those men to their death. Themen knew it as well. It was a risk that was judged to be necessary, and a pricethat was paid willingly. This is no different, here. It is a sacrifice that ourpeople, including those you often advocate for, might survive.”Magda took a step back. “And even if the price is willingly paid by thosethousands, it will take time before the towers can be completed. The dreamwalkers are coming. We can’t afford to wait.”Elder Cadell’s frown began to show anger. “Do you suppose that the towers arethe only solution we pursue? Do you think we are foolish old men, leaving thematter to languish while our people are in jeopardy? We have gifted who as wespeak work feverishly to find a way to shield us from the dream walkers.”“I’m not saying that you are foolish, Elder Cadell,” Magda said with a bow ofher head. “But the dream walkers are here now. What if the gifted can’t create ashield? What if the dream walkers cut through the ranks of those gifted who areworking on the problem in order to prevent them from coming up with a solution?We have a solution through Lord Rahl that works, and it will work immediately.”“You claim,” Lothain said. “The question for us here remains, do you say thisbecause you have been duped into believing it, or because you are a willingparticipant, a traitor plotting against the Midlands?”The prosecutor cocked his head, as if inviting a confession.“Plotting against . . . ?” Magda’s surprise darkened into a murderous glare. “Isay it because it is the truth.”“So you say. It remains to be determined what Baraccus may have been up to. Forall we know, you, too, could be part of a conspiracy. After all, you were thewife to the First Wizard, yet you advocate surrendering our sovereignty to AlricRahl. And no wonder, since you now tell us that Baraccus himself, a man who wassupposedly our noble leader, confided in you his trust in the Lord Rahl of theD’Haran Lands over the council of the Midlands. That does not strike me as thekind of thing that would be said by a woman who has always claimed to be anadvocate for those of the Midlands. It sounds to me like a woman who advocatesfor D’Haran interests over ours.”The crowd broke into a drone of whispering. Magda thrust a finger toward theprosecutor.“Your twisted accusations could very well cost uncounted thousands their lives!”As the echo of her voice still rang around the room, the whispering behind herdied out.“You are avoiding the true issue before us,” Lothain said.“The true issue? The true issue is that you see conspiracies lurking in everyshadow, spies hiding around every corner, traitors behind every door. You careonly about chasing inventions of your imagination in order to advance your ownpersonal fame and power!”The crowd gasped.Magda spread her arms before him. “In your fixation on coming up withconspiracies designed to elevate your own status, you deliberately ignore thebloody truth standing before you.”Apparently so surprised that anyone would dare to speak to him in such a tone,much less publicly accuse him of inventing conspiracy theories for personalgain, Lothain was for the moment struck speechless.Before he could recover and say anything, Magda wheeled around to the crowdwatching in rapt attention.“The dream walkers are among us,” she said loud enough for all to hear. “Thesemen on the council choose to be blind to the bloody truth before their eyeswhile the clever head prosecutor chases phantoms only he sees. If you follow thelead of the council or Lothain’s self-serving gossip about conspiracies, thenyou risk what I suffered. Know that without protection you very well could diein unspeakable agony.“As well-intentioned as the council’s choice may be, you are the ones who willpay the bloody price for their mistake.”The crowd again buzzed with anxious chatter. Some people shouted out over theracket, wanting to know what they could do. Magda held up her hands, calling fororder so she could answer.“Let the council do as they will,” she told them. “But if you wish to live, thento save your own life go to your knees, bow forward, place your forehead to theground, and speak the following devotion to the Lord Rahl:“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.“Repeat the devotion three times to ensure that you invoke the link to LordRahl’s magic so that your mind will be shielded from the dream walkers.“Do it in secret if you don’t want to have to explain to these men your reasonsor if you fear reprisal. Realize that it does not make you a traitor to theMidlands to swear your allegiance to the Lord Rahl; rather it makes you loyal toyour own life.“Lord Rahl is not an enemy of the Midlands, he is a fighter for all of those inthe New World. We are all one. We are all fighting for the right to live, theright to be free from bloody tyranny.“You cannot help the Midlands if you are dead.” Magda thrust an angry fist high.“Choose to live! Swear your loyalty to Lord Rahl and you will be protected fromthe dream walkers!”Magda saw the council frantically signaling for the guards to lead her from thecouncil chambers.Before they could come to escort her out, she lifted her chin and marched towardthe doors. The crowd parted, falling back out of her way as if she were someoneof power and authority.Some whispered their thanks as she passed.Magda kept her eyes straight ahead and her expression blank, not showing heremotions as she made her way toward the great doors."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 Magda spotted the stony Lord Rahl standing just outside the great doors watchingher long march out of the council chambers. His two grim bodyguards waited notfar behind him. Glancing back over her shoulder as she passed the massive,mahogany doors, Magda saw the council guard who had been following after herslow to a halt when they were sure that she was indeed leaving and looked tohave no intention of returning.Far off across the rotunda Magda saw Lord Rahl’s small army standing ready todraw weapons and defend him if there was trouble. She realized that they wouldnot be in a good mood after word of all the angry charges and accusations thathad been leveled against Lord Rahl reached them. As far as the soldiers wereconcerned, they must believe that they were in a potentially hostile place.What’s more, three of them had already died mysterious deaths since arriving atthe Keep. At a signal from Lord Rahl, though, their hands eased off theirweapons.Back inside the council chambers, despite the calls for order, things were notreturning to normal. The crowd didn’t want to go on with the agenda. They wantedanswers to pointed questions about the threat from dream walkers.Magda hoped that the council would think it over and see the wisdom in usingLord Rahl’s solution to shielding people from the threat. In her experience, itwas often the case that upon further reflection the council saw that hersuggestions made sense. She hoped that was the case this time.“I must apologize, Lady Searus,” Alric Rahl said with a deep bow. “I wasterribly wrong.”“Wrong about what?” Magda asked, her own temper still burning hot as she startedout once again.As he fell in beside her, he gestured back through the door to the councilchambers, where a near riot was taking place. People were shouting at thecouncil, demanding to be heard, demanding to know if it was true that danger wasreally that close at hand.“I must beg your forgiveness. I was wrong and you were right.” He leaned downtoward her a little and arched an eyebrow. “I can see now that having shorterhair has indeed lowered your status to that of a nobody and that you are nowcompletely defanged.”Magda’s fury faded in the face of his satire. She couldn’t help but to smile.“Well, the truth is the truth, no matter your status.”He glanced back briefly toward the council chambers. “Unfortunately, I thinkthat speaking the truth has made you some enemies.”Magda’s smile faded. “I almost died twice this day. The second time you broughtme back as I was passing through the veil into the world of the dead. I wasnearly in the embrace of the good spirits. I was dead but for you pulling meback to the world of life.“Every moment I live now is a gift. All anyone can do is return me to that placewhere I should rightfully be. If I am to live, then I will live free ofpretense.”“You’re wrong that you should rightfully be dead, Magda. You chose life and youlived. That is the fact of the matter. We can’t live our lives according to whatmight have been. We have to live by what is. You’re alive and that is what’simportant.”To Magda, though, life without Baraccus seemed dismal and empty. Despite thepain she had been in, she had thought that she was about to be with him again.Despite wanting to live, she was in a way sorry to have been snatched back.“You lived and you have given other people the gift of also being able to chooseto protect themselves so they can also live,” one of Lord Rahl’s big bodyguardssaid.Alric Rahl glanced back at the man and nodded. “The choice is now their own, notthe council’s.”He turned his attention back to Magda. “But by helping people make their ownchoice, you have put yourself in jeopardy. Perhaps you should come with me backto the People’s Palace. You will be safer there.”With the world at war, Magda wondered if there was such a thing as a safe place.If one place fell, then the next would come under siege until it, too, fell.Eventually, there would be no safe place left to run to. Either the New Worldsurvived together, or all of it would fall under the swords of the invaders.Though he didn’t return the stares, people watched Alric Rahl as he passed.Their eyes betrayed their fear of the imposing figure of Lord Rahl, a man thatfew in the Keep had ever seen. But they would have heard the stories of him.As they passed through the great rotunda, she noticed others, back in theshadows, a collection of worried people who glanced her way as they talkedquietly among themselves. She saw the silent dread in the eyes tracking her.In that moment, she realized that while some feared Lord Rahl, most of theothers were not watching him, they were watching her as she passed by. They werelooking to her for something, for answers, or salvation, or maybe simply areason to hold out hope. They weren’t seeing her short hair. They were seeingMagda Searus, a woman covered in blood who had declared that it didn’t have tobe.Magda finally shook her head. “I grew up in Aydindril. Since I married BaraccusI’ve lived in the Keep. This is my home. We are at war and my home is underthreat. I have to stay and fight for it. These are my people. I have to stay andfight for them.“People are accustomed to doing as the council says. I don’t know if any willchoose to become bonded to you and your protection, but at least I’m shieldedfrom the dream walkers. That means I will be better able to fight for thesepeople. Maybe I can convince others to join in accepting the same protection.“Besides, the dream walkers are not the only threat. There are things going onthat don’t make sense to me. I know that Baraccus, too, always thought thatthere was something wrong here at the Keep.”“Lothain’s conspiracies?”Magda pursed her lips as she considered. “Knowing my husband I don’t think it’sthat simple. There is something terribly wrong here, something much deeper.”“What do you mean?”“Well, for one thing, the Temple team was supposed to take the most dangerousthings of magic away into the Temple for safekeeping. They betrayed us,supposedly to help protect mankind from the tyranny of magic.”“But they’ve all been caught and put to death.”Magda was beginning to think that whole story was too simple, too neat and tidy.She was beginning to wonder if they all really were traitors.“But how could such men turn against us? How is mankind suffering under atyranny of magic? Dear spirits, they were wizards, creatures of magic. Theyweren’t tyrants.“For the Temple team itself—a hundred men—to have been working for the enemy washorrifying. No one, not even Baraccus, had suspected such a thing. So if no onesuspected, do you really think that Lothain managed to catch and execute everylast one of the traitors?”“It is hard to imagine such a widespread conspiracy here at the Keep, andespecially among such trusted men. But I’m sure that Lothain torturedconfessions out of those men before they were executed and would have rounded upany others if there were any.”“You told me that three of your men died mysteriously since arriving here,” shereminded him.“There is that,” he said.“Baraccus left me a note. It was his last words to me. He told me that mydestiny is here. He asked me to have the courage to find the truth.”“The truth? The truth about what?”Magda let out a deep sigh. “I don’t know.”“How do you know that the note really meant anything specific? Maybe Baraccus,knowing your nature, simply wanted to let you know that you were in his heart.”“In that note, he told me to guard my mind.”Lord Rahl missed a step. “Guard your mind? You mean from the dream walkers?”She cast him a sidelong glance. “You tell me.”Some of his long blond hair fell forward over a shoulder as he looked over ather. “So you think he also wanted you to stay here?”“Yes. He said that my destiny is here. Baraccus was a war wizard. He had thegift for prophecy. I think that he knows that something dark is going on hereand he wanted me to find it.”Lord Rahl thought it over as they walked past soaring marble columns supportingan arched ceiling with scenes of great events painted between the ribs of thevaulting.“But Baraccus was a war wizard. You’re, well, you’re not. What can you possiblydo that he couldn’t?”“Try and guess how many times I’ve tried to make sense of that very thing.”Lord Rahl grunted his understanding of her point. “You have no idea what it isyou are supposed to look for?” he asked.“I guess that I’m supposed to look for the truth.”“But what truth?”“Maybe the truth of why Baraccus killed himself.”Lord Rahl considered that for a moment. He finally gestured in frustration.“Perhaps after venturing into the world of the dead, he was simply overwhelmedby the experience and lost all hope.”Magda again glanced over at the man. “None of the Temple team killed themselvesafter they returned. None of them seemed overwhelmed. Baraccus was stronger thanthose men.”Lord Rahl clasped his hands behind his back as he walked silently beside her,thinking it over.“Baraccus never did anything without good reason,” he finally said.“Exactly. I think that he had a purpose in killing himself. I think it must havebeen the only way he could accomplish something profoundly important. I thinkthat Baraccus sacrificed his life for a calculated, powerful reason. I need toknow what that reason was. I think he wanted me to look for the answer to thatquestion.“I have to stay and find the truth behind all of the things that have happened.I’m the only one who seems to care why he killed himself. I may be the only onewho can find the answer. In any event, Baraccus seemed to have faith that Icould. In fact, he charged me with that mission as his last request. He said forme to live the life that only I can live.”As they entered the long gallery Lord Rahl glanced up at the red banners hangingabove them. “Where will you start?”“I’m not sure, yet.”For a time he walked in silence along the crimson carpet with the names ofbattles woven into it before finally glancing over and smiling. It was not ahappy smile, but rather a sad, grim smile.“I understand. These people are fortunate to have you fighting for them. Butknow this. You are not the only one here who is safe from the dream walkers.”Magda frowned up at the man as they passed immense black pillars. “What do youmean? The council rejected your help.”He clasped his hands behind his back and waited until they had gone by a knot ofonlookers and were out of earshot before answering.“I expected that they might, so when I first arrived I went to those who do thework of protecting us—the officers and the gifted working here—and laid out thesituation. Military men understand threat all too well and grasp the value of aneffective defense.”“You are a devious man, Lord Rahl.”He grinned, looking happy with himself. “I knew better than to put all our necksin the hands of the council. That’s why I went to a number of important peoplehere at the Keep, first.”“And they’ve sworn loyalty to you?”“Not all. But some comprehended the true dimension of the threat and spoke thedevotion as you have.” He chuckled softly. “Though none of them had to bleedfirst.”She smiled with embarrassment. “Baraccus mentioned a few times that he found mestubborn.”“Officers Rendall and Morgan are with us,” he said. “They command troops in andaround Aydindril. Grundwall too. He leads the Home Guard.”Magda nodded. “I know them. They’re good men. What of the gifted?”“Since it involves magic, they tended to understand the true dimensions of thethreat and therefore the wisdom of the solution. Some didn’t take to my offer,but many did. That means we have a fair number of allies who can go about theirwork without worry of dream walkers subverting what they do.”Magda sighed. “Still, not all have accepted the protection of the bond to you.Maybe I can help convince them.”When they reached his big, brawny soldiers at the far end of the great gallery,Alric Rahl turned to face her.“I have to be on my way. Now that I’ve done what I can here, there are pressingmatters that I must attend to.”Magda looked up into his blue eyes. “Before you go, tell me something.”“If I can.”“Are the council and prosecutor right? Are you after rule? Is power what youreally care about, what drives you? Is that why you created the bond to work inthe way it does, so that people must swear loyalty to you? The truth, now.”He hooked his thumbs in his weapons belt as he gazed down into her eyes for atime. His intent resolve didn’t waver.“Know this, Lady Searus. I have agents in the Old World as we speak. They seekout the dream walkers. They are there to hunt down and kill every last one ofthose bastards. I couldn’t tell you before, before you were sworn to me, becauseI couldn’t risk the dream walkers learning of it. If my purpose was to rule, Iwould let the dream walkers live so that people would have to swear loyalty tome. If the men I sent succeed in the mission I’ve given them, no one will haveany need of swearing loyalty to me.”Magda smiled. “Thank you, Lord Rahl. In your wisdom I am humbled.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 Holding up her small tin lantern, Magda tried to see ahead into the blackness.She thought that she knew where she was, but she wasn’t entirely sure. The dankmaze of stone passageways beneath the more heavily used portions of the Keep wasas black as death, making it all the harder to get her bearings. While up abovemany of the areas were expansive, elaborately decorated, and comfortable, thelittle-used passageways Tilly led her through resembled cramped caves. Magdacould see the vapor from her every breath lifting into the cool, damp air.Water seeping from joints in the rough stone blocks of the walls had in placesover many years built up spongy, slimy mats across the floor. At times Magda hadto hold her breath against the stench of rat carcasses rotting in puddles ofstagnant water. The inky pools reflected flickering yellow lantern light intwisting patterns across the low ceiling.“Tilly, are you sure that you’re not lost?”Walking in front because the passageway was too narrow for them to walk side byside, Tilly looked back over her shoulder and spoke without slowing.“I often go this way, Mistress. Other routes are sometimes crowded and noisy. Ifind that this way is faster, and besides, I would rather be alone with my ownthoughts.”Magda understood that well enough. As much as she didn’t like the confining,dark passageways, they did have the advantage of being virtually unused. In themore direct routes by way of busy corridors she would have encountered a lot ofpeople.“Is it much farther?”“A ways yet, Mistress.”The two of them worked their way around an awkward jog in the passageway thatskirted a protrusion of wet, gray, speckled granite on the right. It was thebedrock of the mountain itself, left in place to serve as a wall, evidence thatthey were at the margin of the Wizard’s Keep, deep in the mountain into whichthe vast structure was built. Much of the lower Keep was pinned directly intothe stone heart of the mountain.At an intersection, they followed the passage that cut off to the left, headingin the direction of the Keep’s interior. The walls were even closer together,the ceiling lower.Not long after they had taken the turn, a deep thump shook the stone floor.Magda could feel the concussion in her breastbone. Grit rained down from jointsin the stone. They both paused. She then heard a distant scream echo though thecramped corridor.“What was that?” Magda asked, her words echoing back to her from the darkness.Tilly glanced back and saw that Magda had stopped. “Not far ahead be where someof the gifted work on creating weapons. Sometimes, people get hurt. It might benothing more than that.”“Are you saying that you think it might be something else?”The old woman leaned closer and lowered her voice. “I know that I be the one whoplanted the seed of this idea in your head, Mistress, but that was before peoplestarted turning up dead down here. Like I told you when you asked me to show youthe way, I didn’t know if this still be such a good idea. As much as I wouldlike to believe your suspicions, I don’t know if I share the explanation.”Not long after Baraccus’s death, people had begun to find mutilated bodies downin the lower Keep. Tilly’s fears were understandable, especially since she hadfound one of the bodies herself. People didn’t know who was to blame, and thatonly heightened everyone’s fears.At least Lord Rahl was long gone so they couldn’t blame him, though a few stilltried. For some people, it was better to blame anyone than to fear the unknown.Magda’s suspicion was that the killings were most likely the work of the dreamwalkers, just as she had warned the council. Since giving the devotion to LordRahl, Magda was protected from the dream walkers by that bond, so she wasn’t tooworried about the danger to herself in the lower Keep. Tilly wasn’t so sure thatit was the dream walkers. She was worried for Magda’s safety down in the areaswhere the victims had been found. Despite suspecting dream walkers, Magdacouldn’t help sharing that nagging worry in the back of her own mind.Magda ruffled her short hair, ridding it of the bits of stone and dust that hadrained down from the joints in the ceiling. “If you don’t think it’s the dreamwalkers, have you heard any suggestion of who else might be responsible?”Tilly checked the darkness ahead and behind. “Not who, Mistress, what.”Magda’s frown deepened. “What does that mean?”“From what I hear, no one knows much about the killings and no evidence has beendiscovered. I have heard it said, though, that such as was done to the poorsouls they found dead does not appear to have been done by people. At least, notpeople who could be in their right mind. Considering what I saw, I am inclinedto agree.”“Dream walkers can rip a person apart, or make them attack someone else assavagely as any animal.”Tilly straightened. “Maybe so. Please promise me that you will be careful whenyou are down here? You are ungifted. Promise me that you will be on guard at alltimes?”Magda nodded. “You’ve no need to worry about that. As soon as I’m done with whatI came to do, I’ll be headed back up. I have no desire to stay down here anylonger than necessary.”She followed after as Tilly started out again, moving quickly enough to revealthe slight hitch in her gait. Magda heard the screams several more times beforethey finally died down to a brief murmur of weeping and then even thatmercifully ended. She hoped it was wizard’s work that had injured someone andnot something else. If wizards were involved, then help would at least be athand for the person in pain.If dream walkers were involved, there would be no help at hand.Magda was well aware that Tilly could go just about anywhere in the Keep and fewpeople ever paid much attention. Most people didn’t even seem to notice her,almost as if she were invisible. She was just a lowly worker, one of many, goingabout her work. People rarely gave her a second look.Magda had been worried that dream walkers might see the significance of that aswell, see an opportunity in such anonymity, and take Tilly in order to use herfor their ends. To protect her, Magda had convinced Tilly to take on theprotection of the bond to Lord Rahl by giving the devotion. Though Tilly was nowprotected from dream walkers, she still feared what else might be on loose inthe Keep. Magda didn’t entirely dismiss those fears.The old woman stopped and moved to the side, pressing her back to thestone-block wall to make room for three men who suddenly appeared, approachingfrom the darkness ahead. The three, dressed in simple robes, were in a hurry.Magda pulled the cowl of her cloak forward to hide her face as she backed upagainst the wall beside Tilly.“Tilly,” the first of the men said in greeting as he dipped his head. While mostpeople didn’t even know Tilly’s name, there were apparently at least a fewpeople, like Magda, who did notice her and know her name.“Do you know who screamed?” Tilly asked.The man had to turn sideways a little in order to shuffle past. “Yes,” he said,anger charging his tone. “Merritt just got another two men killed. A third wasinjured. That’s who you heard screaming.”Magda thought that she recognized the name. Baraccus must have mentioned itbefore. She spoke before she thought.“How did this Merritt get the men killed?”The first man looked up at her, indignation clearly evident in his eyes. Magdaheld her lantern off to the side, making it look as if she were trying to stayout of the way, but in doing so it put her face in shadow and lit his.“Merritt refused to help us any longer in crafting a critical weapon. Five bravewizards went to their death as a result.” The muscles in his jaw flexed when heclenched his teeth. “Now two more have just died trying to accomplish the taskMerritt abandoned instead of leading. The third man, at least, will recover,though he may be blinded. I don’t know how many more we will lose until, theCreator be willing, we are successful.”“I’m sorry,” Magda said in a sympathetic tone.“Merritt should have been there,” the second man in line said.The first man grunted his agreement as he moved on past Magda. She noticed thathe smelled of smoke and burned flesh. As he passed close, she saw specks ofblood splattered across his robes.Magda lowered her head so that the second two men, holding glowing spheres thatcast cold, greenish light up across their heated expressions, wouldn’t recognizeher. All three swiftly disappeared back into the darkness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 Once the men were out of earshot, Tilly leaned closer. “Wizards,” she confidedbefore starting out once again.Magda had suspected that they were wizards by their simple robes. She had knownthey were when she had looked into their eyes.While she had no gift for magic, she did have the rare knack of being able tosee the gift in the eyes of those who possessed it. She’d always thought of itas merely a form of intuition. Baraccus had said that it was more. He had toldher that, while she was ungifted in the overt sense, she had latent abilitiesthat set her apart in at least some small ways from others who were ungifted.He’d said that the spark of life was stronger in her than in most people. That,he said, was what he saw in her eyes, that she was not merely beautiful butintelligent, unusual, rare. He had sometimes looked into her eyes and whisperedto himself how bewitching she was, as if she weren’t there hearing him, as if hewere all alone looking upon some exceptional specimen rather than his wife.Magda never thought of herself as exceptional, but she did feel lucky that hethought so.She recalled quite clearly the first time she had looked into Baraccus’s eyes.She remembered feeling momentarily lost for words as she gazed in those gentle,knowing eyes. Looking into his eyes had made her feel safe. She had known thathe was gifted, of course, but she’d also seen a handsome older man behind thoseabilities that she was inexplicably drawn to. Who knew the ways of love?Besides being aware of the presence of the gift in the eyes of all three men,Magda was pretty sure that she recognized the first two. She didn’t know theirnames, but she thought that she had seen both of them before. Magda hadoccasionally gone with Baraccus on some of his frequent visits down into thelower Keep to see his wizards. She thought that she must have seen the men oneof those times because she didn’t recall them ever coming to see Baraccus intheir apartments.She also thought that she recalled the name Merritt. Baraccus met with a lot ofgifted people and he didn’t always introduce her. She knew when he preferredthat she remain in the background or even out of sight, such as when people cameto discuss confidential matters or to report trouble. There had been times,after such visitors left, that he would stand at a window, stoically staring outat the city of Aydindril below.Sometimes, though, when visitors left he would tell her their names and what ithad been about. On occasion he talked to her about people he’d met with down inthe lower Keep. The name Merritt sounded familiar, though she couldn’t place aface with the name. It could be that she’d never seen him, merely heard Baraccusmention him.Magda would rather not be returning to the lower reaches of the Keep. It was anunnerving place in the best of times, to say nothing of some of the things shehad heard from Baraccus, but it was even more so, now, in light of Tilly’swarnings, yet Magda didn’t know what else to do. She had run out of ideas andneeded to find answers.After Lord Rahl had left, she’d spent weeks making discreet inquiries, all to noavail. She had spoken to every wizard and sorceress she knew, at least the onesshe felt comfortable enough to approach. Most were sympathetic, but no one knewanything that was in the least bit useful to her.Magda knew that Baraccus confided little in others, even the gifted, except forspecific things they needed to know. Her questions had only confirmed it. Othersknew only small bits of the picture. Magda had been a bit surprised to come tothe realization that she knew a great deal more about Baraccus and hisactivities than did anyone else, even the people he regularly worked with.Through Baraccus, Magda had seen more of the larger picture of the war, complexalliances, and covert activities than any of them, even if she didn’t know someof the finer details. Other people saw the details of small segments, while shein many cases glimpsed the overview of all the things with which Baraccus dealt.She had a deeper insight into how all the parts that various people knew aboutwere connected.Even Lord Rahl, one of the men Baraccus trusted most, was not a great dealdifferent. Baraccus might have trusted him with more vital missions than heentrusted to others, but he hadn’t trusted him with everything. Even with asmany details as Alric Rahl knew about the dream walkers, he didn’t know as muchas Magda about the larger picture.Her husband had been a man who closely guarded not only his secrets, but hisactivities and the reasons behind most of the things he did. He’d often saidthat keeping things to himself was a matter of survival.Yet even with as much as she knew, Magda still didn’t know nearly enough aboutthe various matters he had been involved in. She still didn’t know why he hadkilled himself.A number of those she had spoken with had been more interested in talking toher, than about Baraccus. They wanted to know about the dream walkers, and ifwhat they had heard from people who had been at the council meeting the day shehad gone before them, covered in blood, was true. When Magda had confirmed thatit was, they asked about the devotion that was said to be able to protectpeople’s minds. She had given her counsel to anyone who had wanted it. Some ofthose people had listened with open minds and had been grateful. Some weren’tinterested in being allied with Alric Rahl.A few of the gifted, she learned, had already met with Lord Rahl and had alreadytaken up the bond to him.At first, after Lord Rahl had left the Keep, Magda had been worried about thebond working once he was gone. To her surprise, she had discovered that shecould sense him through that bond. It was the strangest feeling, but throughthat link she could feel her connection to him, tell the direction he was in,and sense the distance. It was a reassuring connection that let her know she wassafe from the dream walkers.Now, with the summer wearing on and the secrets behind Baraccus’s death hauntingher at every turn, the only thing left was to try Tilly’s original suggestion.She still didn’t like the idea, especially in light of the new dangers down inthe Keep, but Magda had reached a dead end in her search for answers. In theback of her mind, she also feared to lose the chance should the dream walker getto the woman first.Despite her misgivings, Tilly seemed to understand Magda’s need to find answersas to why Baraccus had killed himself. Tilly thought that if she went to see thewoman, it would at least help bring peace to Magda’s heart. Magda was lookingfor more than peace. She wanted answers.The passageway finally emptied them out into a vast, narrow chamber that rose uplike an enormous split inside the mountain. Fine-grained granite blocks linedthe soaring walls. The chamber was perhaps half a dozen stories high, yet onlyas wide as the public corridors up in the Keep where merchants sometimes soldtheir wares from small carts or stands.The narrow hall was so long that Magda couldn’t make out faces of people at thefar end. In some cases she couldn’t even make out their gender. She was able tomake out the dots of various colors of robes, denoting rank and duties.Magda found herself somewhat relieved to see people again, relieved not to bealone in the dark passageways. The screams she had heard, and learning that menhad just died, made her own loss fresh again.Up near the lofty top of one of the long walls, slits were open to the nightsky. Bats up high darted about, chasing bugs.One of the Keep’s young cats sat on its haunches, peeking around the corner, itsbig green eyes watching the bats. It was obviously hungry. Feeling sorry for thescrawny black cat, Magda pulled a small bundle of chicken strips from her waistpouch. She unwrapped the meal she had brought along and tossed a small piecedown to the hungry cat. As long as she had it out, Magda handed Tilly a stripand took one for herself before replacing the bundle in her waist pouch. The catpounced and devoured the unexpected prize as Magda and Tilly went on their way,each nibbling at her own snack.Magda had been to the enormous room several times, though by a more agreeableroute, so she knew that it was a central hub leading to a number of importantareas of the lower Keep. The first time she had been to the place, Baraccus hadtold her that the slits along the top of one of the walls helped the chamberserve as a ventilation chimney, drawing air through the lower Keep in order toprovide a bit of fresh air.The open slits were also one of the ways that birds sometimes found their wayinto the Keep. It wasn’t uncommon to find a small bird lost in the halls.Sometimes grackles found their way into dining halls, where they hopped aroundon the ground looking for crumbs, or even boldly stole food right off people’splates.Magda could see several sparrows that had obviously found their way in via thehigh slits, roosting on supports near the tops of the wall. She even spotted araven perched on a beam, its feathers fluffed up, its black eyes watching thepeople down below.With it being hotter outside than in, the ventilation openings seemed to beworking in reverse this night, letting muggy air sink into the room and leavingthe place feeling clammy. A haze of smoke coming from work areas had stratifiedthroughout the room.Stone stairs built tight against the wall to the right led to long, narrowbalconies with widely spaced openings. Some had doors, while most werepassageways to different areas.Many of the people in the room seemed in a hurry, but Magda was used to seeingpeople in the Keep in a hurry. As large as the place was, it wasn’t uncommon fora journey between areas to take hours. Delaying for any reason, such as to chat,could in certain cases cause an errand to end up taking the better part of theday. That was probably why Tilly preferred the mostly deserted secondarypassageways.When Tilly saw Magda staring at carts piled high with bloody bandages parkedhaphazardly along one wall, she leaned closer and whispered, “Down here, in thematters these people deal in, errors are costly. Even worse, they are frequentlypunished by death.”Magda didn’t have to ask what Tilly was talking about. She had escorted Baraccusto the place several times when he needed to speak with some of his wizardsworking on weapons for the war effort.They were entering the area of the Keep where some of those weapons were createdout of people.While she understood the need, she was still appalled by the very idea of usingmagic to alter a person’s nature, to change who they were—in some cases tosomething no longer even human. She found the practice of changing people insuch ways to be beyond abhorrent."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 “Over there.” Tilly gestured to an entryway, set back into the shadows, somedistance down on the far side of the vast chamber. “We must go down that way.”Magda nodded. She knew of the place, of course, though she had never had reasonto go down there before. She pressed a hand against the pang of anxietytightening in her stomach.As they made their way along and diagonally across the chamber, she tried asbest she could to keep her face concealed by the cowl of her cloak. She wasn’tgoing to go out of her way to prevent people from recognizing her, but shewasn’t going to deliberately let people know she was there if she didn’t haveto. The echo of her every footstep, though, whispered through the cavernousroom, as if to betray her.Glancing out from the edge of the hood of her cloak, Magda saw gifted people sherecognized. Even though she was doing nothing wrong, she didn’t want to stop totalk with them or have to explain her purpose. It was nobody’s business. Shekept the hood pulled forward.Baraccus had often told her that if she was doing something important, sheshouldn’t tell people anything they didn’t need to know. He lived his life bythat rule. In fact, he often wouldn’t even tell Magda about things he thoughtshe didn’t need to know.Like why he had killed himself.She was certain that what Baraccus had done was not the simple suicide it hadappeared to be to those who didn’t know him as well as she did. Magda knew thatit was more complicated than that. Suicide was simply not consistent with hischaracter, so she knew that there must be more to it, that there must be alarger purpose to it. She also knew that for Baraccus to sacrifice his life,that purpose had to have been vitally important.She also suspected that this time it was different in that he really did wanther to find the reason behind it. His last words, in the note he had left forher, seemed to say as much. His voice still rang in her head with his words fromthe note.Your destiny is to find truth.One way or another, Magda intended to discover the truth behind his death.As they made their way through the immense room, she saw that the series ofarched recessed areas in the wall to the left served as workstations. Peoplestood over the workbenches filing, hammering, cutting, and shaping metal, but insome cases wood. Back beyond some of those arched work areas were large rooms,most with big rolling doors pushed open to each side, probably to provide freshair.Reddish light from the fires of a forge deep in one of the dimly lit roomsrevealed feverish activity that drew Magda and Tilly’s attention. Men yelledinstructions as they urgently worked to contain the damage from what appeared tobe a serious accident.Through the broad opening Magda could see that the room was a shambles. Theforge had been partially torn open. Broken brick and burning embers layscattered across the floor. The metal hood that belonged over the forge, alongwith its chimney, was nowhere in sight. Acrid-smelling smoke and glowing ashstill rising from the remnants of the fire rolled across the ceiling and out theopen doors. Iron bars set into the brick around the forge were twisted and bentoutward, as if there had been a violent explosion.Ominous flashes of lightning still flickered around the damaged forge, sparkedthrough the dimly lit room, and arced off through the smoke hugging the ceiling.The twisting strands of lightning crackling through the room all seemed anchoredat the forge, evidence of the magic that had been involved in the labor, andprobably the source of the catastrophe.The shuddering lightning lit the lines of men in spasms of bluish light as theyrushed in carrying buckets, heaving water on the fire. Hot coals hissed andsteamed. Other men rushed in with glowing spheres to provide more light.Magda spotted the body of a man slumped on the floor against a far wall andanother sprawled nearby. Both men were torn and bloody. It was obvious they weredead. One of the men’s blackened robes still smoldered.A long, gleaming section from a shattered sword was embedded in his chest. Magdacould see that he was missing an arm at his shoulder. She could see by how stillthe piece of blade jutting from his chest was that he wasn’t breathing. Coalsstill glowing red lay strewn among the abandoned bodies, along with polishedfragments of the broken blade. One piece stuck in a far wall shined out from theshadows.A small clutch of people surrounded an injured man on the floor. The circle ofkneeling men, all seeming to be working together, were clustered together, bentover the moaning man, tending to his injuries. One of the man’s legs bent at theknee, then straightened, then the other, back and forth as if he were in greatagony. Some of the men held him down while others appeared to be using theirgift to try to help him.Magda knew that this had to be the source of the screams she had heard. She feltan urge to go help the man, but the gifted were already doing that.From what the three men they had met in the corridors had said, none of it wouldhave happened if the wizard Merritt hadn’t abandoned these men. She couldn’timagine why he would leave people who needed his help. Now men were dead becauseof it.She also couldn’t imagine how a sword could have exploded to do so much damage.Magda and Tilly kept moving through the busy room. There was nothing they coulddo to help.Other rooms, dark but for the intense glow from forges and furnaces, werebeehives of activity. Despite the accident that had happened close by, workcontinued unabated. Furnaces and molten metal could not be left untended. Teamsof men lifted heavy containers and pushed them into furnaces with the aid oflong poles. In other areas, men lugged blazing crucibles from the furnaces topour luminescent, liquid metal into molds.In other rooms, men rushed with glowing steel from the forges to massive anvilswhere other men with hammers waited. As the hot metal was held in place, thehammers worked in unison. The steady beat of cold steel against hot metal atvarious stations rang through the large chamber as the men shaped the malleablemetal. The ringing of hammers mixed with the roar of fires being fed by bellows,shouting, conversation, and the dull background rasp of files.Magda could smell molten metal, smoke from fires, and steam from salt water andoil used to quench the glowing steel. The haze of smoke and steam that hungmotionless the length of the enormous room was in places tinted yellowish orangeby the blush of light from forges and furnaces off under archways and rooms tothe side.Despite the accident, work looked to have hardly paused. The war raged on. Everyday the enemy drew closer. These people knew that they could not slow theirefforts.The threat overhanging them all was almost palpable."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 When they reached the far side of the long chamber, Magda glanced around,checking to make sure that the people were going about their own business andnot paying any attention to her. Satisfied, she and Tilly slipped into asheltering entryway.Though its style mimicked many of the grand places in the Keep, the recessedentry was, in contrast to most other areas, rather small and intimate. Flutedlimestone columns lined either side of the gloomy alcove. The small pillars, notmuch taller than Magda, were topped with long entablatures that provided supportfor arches elaborately decorated with complex, carved stone moldings framingtiles laid out in dark, geometric patterns. Benches to each side had beenintricately embellished to match the forbidding architectural details of therest of the entry.The benches seemed to suggest that visitors sit and reconsider before going anyfarther. Or maybe that they pause in their weary grief and rest to steadythemselves before continuing on.Surrounding the pitch black opening at the rear, larger-than-life stone figuresin grim, contorted, distraught poses clearly conveyed a sense of desolation andtragedy for what lay beyond.For good reason. The brooding figures surrounding the doorway were meant to tellall that this was not a region to be entered lightly.This was the threshold to the place of the dead.Without pausing to reconsider or to rest, Tilly vanished into the dark maw.Magda followed swiftly behind. Their lanterns, along with more hung atintervals, revealed stone steps descending down into blackness. The stairs werewide enough that the two of them could walk side by side.“Do you come down here often?” Magda asked.“No, Mistress. Only when a wizard or sorceress asks that I come down to clean aspecific area for them. Some like their rooms kept tidy. Most don’t like anyonecoming into the places where they do their work. Other members of the staff areassigned to the common areas down here, the same as up above.”Magda glanced at the meticulously maintained and polished stone balustrade. Shesupposed that it was a sign of respect for the dead that the place be keptpresentable for visitors.In contrast to the marble staircase that gave the descent a sense of grandeur,the walls and ceiling were nothing more than a broad shaft hollowed out of rock.Flight after flight of stairs, each ending at a landing from which the next runturned, were all part of a massive staircase that spiraled ever downward. Therewere no rooms or side corridors along the way, nor areas set aside to sit andrest.It surprised Magda how far down they had to go before they finally reached aspacious cavern at the bottom. The chamber had been carved out of the rock, muchas the tunneling descent had, with tool marks and drill holes from theexcavation still in evidence on the rough stone walls. Only the floor wasfinished off, in a circular pattern of light and dark stone tiles. A tableveneered in burl walnut sitting alone in the center of the room held a simplewhite vase filled with white lilies.At intervals around the room, openings cut into the stone led off into darkness.Each looked like a cave. None of the nine passageways were trimmed or decorated,except for a symbol that had been carved into the stone above each opening.Without delay, Tilly entered the ninth opening, a number that she knew fromBaraccus had great meaning in things having to do with magic.The walls of the passageway were the same roughly hewn stone as the chamber hadbeen. Almost immediately, they started down yet more steps, except that these,rather than being built, were carved directly from the stone itself. The treadswere rugged and uneven, so Magda had to be careful lest she fall.It was another long descent down the twisting tunnel before the stone abruptlychanged. As the tunnel leveled out, they found themselves within a vein ofsofter sandstone. Unlit corridors branched off in every direction but Tilly ledthem on through the largest, main hallway. Before long, rooms carved out of thesandstone began to appear on both sides.Almost immediately, Magda began seeing the dead.As they passed by room after room, their lantern light revealed niches carvedright into the stone walls of the rooms. Each cavity looked to hold at least onebody; most held more. Some of the hollowed-out chambers seemed to have entirefamilies laid out beside one another.Magda slowed to take a better look into a larger area off to the right. She sawthat in places the resting chambers were half a dozen high, the uppermost nichesreachable only with a ladder. Most of the bodies laid to rest in the honeycombsof cavities were wrapped in shrouds that were so old and dirty that they lookedto have been carved out of the same tan sandstone as the rooms themselves. Anumber of the recesses held coffins, all of them stone, most with carveddecorations, all of them layered in dust and partially encased within masses ofcobwebs.As they went on, they encountered rooms of niches that held massive numbers ofbones. Each recess was filled to the top with neatly stacked bones, sorted bytype, covered in dust. Several of the chambers held only skulls. Many of theresting places looked untouched for decades, if not centuries. Very few lookedtended.“These are the oldest tombs,” Tilly said. “As more space was needed, the oldestbones were brought together and stacked here to make room. As time went on,catacombs had to be extended deeper and deeper in order to make new places tobury the recently deceased. The excavation goes on to this day. Many of thoseliving up above will one day end up down here.”Above many of the hollowed-out resting places could still be seen a family namein faded paint, or a name and a title of the deceased. Some were decoratedaround the edges with crudely carved decorations, probably done by familymembers.Many people preferred to inter their family members so that they could come tovisit them. Other people, especially the relatives of more famous people,preferred to let fire consume their loved one, rather than allow their bodies tobecome an attraction, or provide rivals a corpse to spit upon.Magda had chosen to have the shell that had contained Baraccus’s spirit to beconsumed by fire as that was also said by some to purify the spirit of itsworldly trappings for its journey to the underworld. Some couldn’t stand thethought of a loved one being reduced to ashes. Magda didn’t see that emptyvessel as her loved one. Her loved one was gone to be among the good spirits.The choice being forced upon her, she chose to have his vessel reduced to ashrather than to rot.The passageway they hurried down widened out, so that the two of them couldagain walk comfortably side by side. As they descended level after level, pastthe dead numbering in the thousands, they eventually came to newer sections ofthe catacombs. The bodies Magda saw wrapped in white shrouds were not yetlayered in centuries of dust.Torches in rusty iron brackets were lit in these newer sections, providingenough light to see without the need of lanterns. Tilly blew out the flame inhers.“Besides the dead,” Tilly said, “here, too, be places where some of the giftedchoose to work.”Although her guide didn’t mention it, Magda recalled Tilly telling her that someof the gifted down here worked with the dead. Magda didn’t like to contemplatesuch a concept, and tried hard not to imagine what such work could entail.Before long, Magda began to hear the whisper of conversation. They soonencountered people coming out of passageways to the sides. Some hurried past inthe opposite direction. Most of them were alone, but she also saw groups of fouror five people talking in low voices among themselves, absorbed in debate onformulas or the order of prophecy.Magda finally saw rooms that were something other than burial chambers. Theylooked like crude work areas cut out of the sandstone. Some were lit by torches,but a number of the rooms were brightly illuminated by glass spheres.Inside a few darker rooms Magda saw glowing verification webs surrounded bypeople studying them, pointing out certain elements to others, or casting inadditional branches. Some of the webs hummed. The colors of the webs reflectedoff faces focused on the work.There were several large libraries, lined with shelves from floor to ceiling,all filled with books. Magda knew from Baraccus that these would be valuable andprofoundly dangerous books that needed to be kept away from more public areas.Some such books had been taken away to the Temple of the Winds.People sat at tables, quietly studying volumes opened before them, while othersstood in the aisles, searching the shelves, apparently looking for particularinformation. Other rooms had heavy doors. At one door, flashes of light crackledand flickered through the gap at the bottom of the door, as if there were athunderstorm inside.Tilly gestured down a passageway to the right. “This way.”The long corridor was noticeably different from any that had come before. It waswider than the others, with carefully carved straight walls and a flat ceiling.It was also completely deserted and silent in a way that was oppressive.As they left the occupied areas far behind and made their way down thepassageway, something about the place made the fine little hairs on the back ofMagda’s neck stiffen.At the far end they reached a single arched opening, its significancehighlighted by the broad corridor that had led up to this lonely archway. Atextile with long-faded colors in vertical geometric designs hung over theentryway.Tilly paused to the side of the covered opening. “Here be where you need to go,Mistress. I can take you no farther.”“Why not?”Tilly glanced at the hanging. “The gifted who I sometimes work for, and who havetold me about the woman, also say that I am not to go beyond these symbols hunghere. They say that it is only for the gifted to go beyond.”Magda frowned. “I’m not gifted.”“But you are Magda Searus. As the wife of the First Wizard you had to live up toresponsibilities others don’t have, but with those responsibilities cameliberties not always enjoyed by those who are not gifted.”Despite Tilly’s confidence, Magda wasn’t so sure that she would be welcomed. Thefact that Tilly wasn’t allowed beyond was a troubling sign that Magda hadn’tanticipated.Tilly pulled a small piece of paper from her pocket and handed it over. “Thismap was given to me by a friend I trust. It will show you which passageways youmust take. Pay close attention so that you don’t become lost in the maze. Whenyou reach an archway covered over with red cloth, that be the place.“Inside there is said to be a blind woman named Isidore who tends the spiritist.I have never met her, but as I hear it told, if the spiritist is willing to seeyou, Isidore will take you to her.“You must understand that the spiritist may not wish to see you. Her purpose isto help the gifted to see into the world of the dead, not to grant audiences topetitioners. She may choose to turn you away.”“But you’re the one who suggested in the first place that I come to see thespiritist. You mean you don’t even know that she will see me?”“You are the wife of the First Wizard now in the world of the dead. Though Ican’t say for certain, I have believed from the first that you are one she wouldagree to see.”Despite looking somewhat apologetic, Tilly tried to allay the concern by goingon with her advice. “If you are allowed to speak with the spiritist, she willneed to reach into the spirit world to find what you seek. My advice would be tothink carefully about what you most need to know.”“I understand.” Magda glanced down at the paper covered with lines andintersections, unsure if it was all worthwhile. “Thank you, Tilly. I appreciateyou showing me the way.”“If she agrees to help you, I have heard that it takes some time. With yourpermission, I would leave you to your search for answers. I should be back to mywork before I am missed.”Magda could tell by the way the woman stole glances back up the strange entrancetunnel that she was afraid of the place. Magda didn’t feel all that comfortablethere, either.“Of course, Tilly. You’ve done enough bringing me down here. Please, go on back.I’ll be fine.”Tilly offered a brief smile. “Can you find your way back from here alone?”Magda nodded. “Yes. I know how to return.”Tilly touched Magda’s arm. “I wish you well, then, Mistress. I hope that you canfind the answers you seek and that your heart can at last be at peace.”Magda didn’t know if her heart would ever be at peace, but she nodded anyway.She was at least determined to find answers.Tilly leaned close and lowered her voice. “Be careful, Mistress.”“What do you mean?”“The spiritist is said to be a dangerous woman.”Magda frowned down at the old woman. “Dangerous in what way?”Tilly arched one brow. “She deals with the dead.”Magda let out a sigh as she again took in the cloth hanging in the dead stillair of the arched opening.“I will be careful.”She watched as Tilly hurried back through the cavernous passageway and vanishedaround a bend.Standing in the silence before the hanging textile covered with a simplegeometric pattern, Magda looked at the map again to get her bearings.For a long time she stood alone, debating the wisdom of going to see such awoman. At last, she let out a deep sigh. She had no other ideas.She had tried everything else she could think of. It would be foolish to turnback when she was this close."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 Magda lifted the rough cloth aside and cautiously entered what the map showed tobe a complex maze. She held the lantern out, trying to see into the darkness,but she could see little of what was ahead. As she moved deeper into thecarefully carved tunnel, she encountered layers of coarsely woven, raw linenhanging motionless across the passageway. It was unnerving to abruptly encounterthe walls of cloth suspended in the darkness. She couldn’t imagine theirpurpose. She speculated that perhaps they were there to make the maze moreconfusing to trespassers. They were certainly confusing her.The hanging cloth also hid many of the side passageways, making it difficult toknow for certain where she was on the map and if it was merely a cloth hangingin the middle of the hall, or a cloth covering the opening to anotherpassageway. Sometimes there were four cloth walls forming a square, several withpassages behind them, some with none. Over and over, she had to check behind thehangings and then consult the paper Tilly had given her. Several times she hadto retrace her steps and start over again, trying to be sure of the proper turnsto take.Even though she carefully studied the map as she slowly made progress deeper anddeeper into the warren of tunnels, it seemed that the complex network didn’tmatch the drawing. It was frighteningly confusing. She was having troublereconciling the map to the tunnels she found herself in and feared becoming lostin the maze.After a time, though, Magda realized that the short marks along the line of theroute she was to follow were not side corridors, as she had thought at first.The short lines were actually intended to designate the locations of the layersof cloth that hung across her way. She confirmed her theory by counting thehangings between side tunnels. Once she was properly oriented to Tilly’sdrawing, she was more confident in selecting the proper turns when she reachedintersections.The place was dead quiet. The only sound was the soft swish of her boots on thesandstone floor. She noticed that the floor was relatively rough, while theothers they had been in had been worn smooth by foot traffic. Apparently, notmany people ever ventured this way.Magda turned when she thought she heard a soft sound from behind. She stoodmotionless for a time, breathing as slowly as she could while she listened. Whenshe didn’t hear it again, she finally moved on, quickening her pace.To the sides, a few of the inky black tunnels didn’t have the hangings coveringthe openings. There were no doors anywhere in the maze, as there had been in theareas where people worked. It was as if doors were not needed because theoppressive darkness itself barred the way into the side passages. That, or theominous, dead-still curtains.The place smelled dusty and dry with little hint of the burning pitch from thetorches back in the occupied areas. Magda cautiously checked each room as bestshe could as she passed by, but she saw no one. Each room was completely bare,without any furniture or indication of purpose. None of them looked to have everbeen inhabited. She heard no voices. It was as if she had entered an empty worldentirely devoid of life.She paused and turned back when she thought she heard a sound from behind. Shestood stone-still for a time, holding her breath, listening, but she didn’t hearit again. Finally, she let her breath out and continued on, but from time totime she checked back over her shoulder.She couldn’t ever recall being anywhere in the Keep that felt so lonely. She hadnever been down into the catacombs so she hadn’t really known for sure what theywere like. Even the resting places of all the dead had seemed less desolate thanthe passageways leading to the spiritist. She hadn’t been aware that suchstrange deserted areas existed down below the Keep.Every tunnel of every corridor looked the same. It would be all too easy tobecome lost in the complex network of tunnels. As she checked her map at everyintersection, she was thankful that Tilly had obtained it for her.Magda abruptly found herself at the end of the corridor. An archway covered overwith a coarse red cloth loomed up before her. This was where the map ended. Itwas the place Tilly had told her about.She stood stock-still for a time, not knowing for certain what to do. There wasno door for her to knock on.“Is anyone there?” she finally called out. Her voice echoed back to her from thecold corridor behind.“We are here,” came a woman’s voice from deep within. “Why are you here?”“I have come to speak with the dead.”The only sound was the hiss of Magda’s lantern as she stood motionless, watchingthe vapor of her breath slowly rise into the still air. She glanced back intothe darkness as she waited, listening for the sound she’d heard before.“Enter, if you have need enough,” the woman finally said.Something about the voice made Magda wonder if she should turn back now, whileshe had the chance."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 Before she lost her courage, Magda pushed the dead still, faded red cloth asideand ducked under it into a narrow hallway. Under a low, arched ceiling the hallled back through darkness toward an area of mellow light. At the end of theentryway she found a roughly round chamber lit by dozens and dozens of fatcandles. The room was hollowed out of the same pale sandstone as the rest of thecatacombs. Ledges carved into the walls all the way around held all the candles.The candles gave the whole room a soft, warm amber glow.To the right Magda saw a dark doorway, presumably leading farther back into thequarters. She suspected that the spiritist would be in that back area.In the middle of the room a thin young woman sat cross-legged on the floor. Shehad very short, fine brown hair and wore a dark, loose-fitting wrap of a dressthat covered her legs entirely but left her shoulders and slender arms bare. Herhands remained nested in the lap of her dress.A strange, thick leather blindfold fastened around her head covered her eyes. Itwas a uniform width except for a notch cut in the middle to fit around herdelicate nose. The blindfold went temple to temple, held in place with a leatherthong tied at the back of her head. Magic symbols and spell-forms had beencarefully tooled into the leather with some of the lines colored in with paint.By the way the leather edges were worn and smooth it looked to have been in usefor quite some time.It was beautifully made, but covering the young woman’s eyes as it did struckMagda as rather foreboding.The woman cocked her head as if to use an ear to better locate her visitor.“Welcome.”“Thank you,” Magda said. She glanced into the dark opening to the side, but sawno one. “Are you Isidore?”The young woman smiled, making her bony cheekbones stand out all the more. Thesmile, while pleasant enough, did not put Magda entirely at ease. The woman’sexpression and the lines around her mouth had an uncompromising toughness tothem that seemed at odds with her young age. It reminded Magda a bit of the lookshe had seen in the eyes of orphan girls who lived by their wits in thealleyways of Aydindril. Those girls were tough beyond their years.“I am Isidore. Strangers are most uncommon down here. Who would you be, then?”“Magda Searus.”“Ah. Wife to Baraccus. I have heard of you.”Magda didn’t know if that was a good thing or not. She glanced again to the darkdoorway, wondering if the spiritist could hear the conversation.While most people had heard of Magda, and a number of people knew her andgenuinely liked her, she knew that there were also those who didn’t like her.Some women had been jealous of her, resentful that she had somehow attracted andmarried the First Wizard. Some men thought marriage in general, and to anattractive younger wife in particular, was a distraction that the First Wizarddidn’t need. A number of people simply resented her for marrying such a greatman when she herself was ungifted. They thought it improper.She also knew that a few people, besides some on the council, had come to loathher after that bloody day in the council chambers. They didn’t like to havetrouble come into their lives at the Keep. It was as if by warning them of thedanger she had personally brought the threat into their midst. As frustrating assuch an attitude was, the truth was the truth.“I’m sorry for your loss,” Isidore said. “The First Wizard was a great man.”“Thank you. I am here about that great man. I would like to speak with thespiritist, if I may.”“I’m afraid not. You see, the sole purpose of the spiritist is to serve thewizards in their work here. I don’t know what you’ve been told, but she does notgive spirit consultations for either the solace or the pleasure of others. Shehas instructed me to tell people that her work is vital and consumes all hereffort and strength, so she can see no one else. I am sorry.”Magda knew what was being implied. “I was told only that it might be possiblefor an ungifted person to see her.”Isidore considered Magda’s words. “Is it important?”“It is to me,” Magda said. “And I can assure you, it would not be for either mysolace or my pleasure. I would just as soon leave the dead to their eternalpeace.”The young woman smiled vacantly for a time. “I meant, is it important to us?”Magda was a bit surprised by the question. “It very well may be essential to allour survival.”“Come back another day.”Magda stood frozen, surprised by the abruptness of the rejection. She hadn’teven been given a chance to plead her case. She decided that she had not comethis far to give up so easily.“This has to do with the continued existence of our people and our way of life.We are at war and we are all in danger. I need the help of the spiritist. I’mafraid that I must insist.”“Insist?” The woman leaned back a little as if to look up from behind theblindfold. “And you think that because you were married to an important man youshould be granted special favors? Do you believe that because you were marriedto the First Wizard himself you can insist and we must obey?”Magda thought that the woman’s words actually sounded more innocently curiousthan bitter, so she decided not to let the questions unnerve her and insteadanswered calmly.“Not at all, Isidore. I admit, my status often gained me access, but I soughtthat access to plead on behalf of others who have no voice, not to obtainspecial favors for myself. It is much the same now. I am not asking for specialfavors because I was married to an important man. I am asking to see thespiritist because I have need of answers so that I might help keep others safe.I admit that my safety is at stake along with theirs. I am trying to find a wayto help us all survive.“That important man, my husband, the First Wizard, in his last words to me toldme to seek truth. He believed that I had a purpose in life. That is why I’mhere, and why I must insist, not because of who I am, but because I have beencharged with finding the truth.”“What truth?”“For starters, the truth behind my husband’s death. Baraccus was not the kind ofman who would kill himself out of despondency. He would have had a crucialreason for what he did. Something happened when he went to the Temple of theWinds. I know that there was a purpose behind him leaping to his death, apurpose meant to help us all. It was not a suicide; it was a compassionatesacrifice of his life to give ours a chance to go on in safety. I need to findout what was behind that act so that his sacrifice will not be in vain.”Isidore smiled to herself. It was a curious smile that softened her angularface.“I am sorry.” The woman lifted her hand toward the entryway where Magda had comein, inviting her to leave. “As I said, the spiritist has her job to do andcannot see others. That job is also to help us all. Admirable as your effort maybe, it is not our problem.”Magda took a deep breath and let it out as she reminded herself to be patient.“It very well might become your problem sooner than you think, and then it willbe too late.”Isidore’s hand lowered and then nested back in her lap. For the first time, thewoman’s brow wrinkled with a hint of worry.“What do you mean?”“All is not right in the Wizard’s Keep. We are at war and the enemy is alreadyhere, among us.”The woman showed no emotion, but she lost a bit of color. “The enemy is insidethe walls of the Keep?”“Yes.”“What are you talking about?”“Have you heard of the dream walkers?”Isidore sat silently for a moment. It was clear by her expression that she had.“I have heard of them. But they are distant, down in the Old World.”“The council thinks so as well. But the council is wrong. The dream walkers areslipping into the minds of people right here, in the Keep. I fear that they mayhave help from spies or traitors inside the Keep. A number of strange murderspoint to the enemy.”“I am all too aware of murders taking place down here in the catacombs. For thatreason, surely you must realize that it could be dangerous for you to be downhere. But dream walkers? Here, in the Keep? Are you really so sure?”“Yes. They attacked me.”Isidore seemed surprised and fell silent. She finally gathered her thoughts.“If that were true, you would be dead, yet you seem unharmed.”“I was very nearly killed. I thought for certain that I was about to die. I wasin fact at the veil, very near to passing forever into the spirit world, but Iwas able to obtain a defense against the dream walker in time to save my life.That same defense can also protect your mind being taken by a dream walker.”The smile returned. “Ah. So, you wish to bargain. You wish to offer me thisprotection if I can get the spiritist to agree to see you.”It was not a question. It was an accusation.“Not at all,” Magda said. “I would offer you the protection without anyprecondition, before we go on with anything of substance, and before you agreeto anything. In fact, I intend to insist, even if you refuse to help me.”The frown returned. “You think that if you are kind by offering this helpfreely, then we will relent and be inclined to indulge you?”“No,” Magda said. “Make no mistake. It is not a kindness at all, but an act ofself-interest on my part. Dream walkers can invade an unprotected mind and thatperson can be completely unaware of it. The spiritist is at great risk of beingtaken because she is valuable. I believe that there are traitors in the Keep. IfI’m right, then they would likely direct the dream walkers to the spiritist.Once so identified, the dream walkers would obviously want to control her so asto spy on important matters, or they might simply choose to eliminate her sothat she could no longer help our cause.“For all I know, a dream walker could already be in your mind, watching,listening, hoping to hear what I would ask, and especially what answer I wouldbe given. I can’t take that chance. Too much is at stake.”The frown deepened. “Do you mean to say that you offer this protection so thatyou will know that you are safe in my presence?”“That’s right. I know all too well what the dream walkers are capable of. Inearly died because of them. I don’t want to risk that I could be given answersfrom a spiritist who is unknowingly being controlled by a dream walker intent onhiding the truth. They could send me off in the wrong direction so that I wouldfail and we all die.“I suspect that there are traitors in the Keep. Among other things, I think theyare guiding the dream walkers. I have to believe that such traitors could beplotting something even worse. Perhaps this is what Baraccus intended me tofind. I know that assassins of some sort are among us. We are running out oftime. I need to trust that the spiritist helping me is guided by the truth, andnot by a dream walker.”Isidore turned her head to the side, as if looking off into her own personaldarkness.“More than that,” Magda said, “I fear that if a dream walker is secretly lurkingin your mind, he might tear you apart from the inside to prevent me from havingthe chance to get the answers I need. So you see, while I would not want to seeyou harmed, I am more concerned for myself and everyone else than I am just foryou.”Isidore had lost even more of her color. She looked ashen. Magda could see goosebumps prickle up on her bare arms. Her head turned up toward Magda.“I value my mind,” Isidore said. She reached a hand out. “Please, sit with me,Magda Searus. I would very much like to be protected—for the reasons you give,and for my own reasons.”Isidore had just confirmed Magda’s suspicion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 Once Isidore had completed the three devotions, she pushed herself up from thefloor and folded her legs under her as she sat back down.“Thank you, Magda Searus, for teaching me how to be bonded to the Lord Rahl inorder to be protected from the dream walkers.”Magda noted what Isidore did not say. She bowed her head, but then rememberedthat the woman couldn’t see. “You are very welcome. And Magda is name enough fora friend.”Isidore smiled. “You have a shadow, Magda.”Magda leaned in. “Excuse me?”Isidore’s smile widened as the pointed back toward the entrance. “Your shadowwalks on nearly silent feet.”Magda turned and saw a pair of big green eyes looking at her. The skinny blackcat arched its back and rubbed bashfully against the side of the hallwayopening. It looked like the cat Magda had seen before, the one she had fed ascrap of food. It must have followed her, hoping for more. It was a relief torealize that the sound she had heard before hadn’t been something more sinister.Magda couldn’t help smiling. “It’s a cat,” she told Isidore.“What color?”“She’s black.”Isidore nodded knowingly. “That’s why she is not afraid to come in here.”Magda frowned. “What do you mean?”“People fear black cats, thinking that they are evil. They are not evil. It’sjust that they have some small ability to see between worlds. Black cats catchglimpses of the spirit world. That’s why people fear them, and why she wasn’tafraid to follow you into this place. This place is not entirely alien to her,as it is to those who only see the world of life.”The catacombs filled with the dead certainly did seem to be nearer the spiritworld than anywhere else Magda had ever visited. The whole subterranean regionof the Keep seemed to be very far removed from the life up above.When the cat again voiced a small cry, Magda asked, “Are you hungry, littleone?”The cat meowed, almost as if she were answering, and rubbed the side of her faceagainst the doorway, fearing to come close, but at the same time aching toapproach.Magda pulled the small bundle from her waist pouch and unwrapped the chickenstrips. She knew that the temptation of a meal would overcome the cat’s caution.She asked Isidore if she was hungry. When Isidore nodded, Magda held the woman’shand out and placed a piece of chicken in it. The cat sidled up to Magda andrubbed against her leg. Magda pulled off a small strip and held it out for thecat.“Here you go, little one, have something to eat.”As Magda ate the rest of the strip, the cat hunched forward and devoured thewelcome tidbit.“She seems to shadow you,” Isidore said. “You should name her Shadow.”“I don’t need a cat,” Magda said as she gave the hungry cat another small pieceof chicken.“For those who understand their talents, a black cat is good to have around.”“Talents?” Magda couldn’t imagine what good the cat could do her. “You meanbeing able to see into the spirit world?”“I mean seeing things from that world that are here in this world.”Magda realized that this was no longer idle chitchat. Isidore meant for her tobe mindful of her words.“You mean you think they can see ghosts?”“Some think that cats, black cats in particular, can see the presence ofspirits, or perhaps the essence of spirits. We don’t always know when such anessence has drifted into this realm and is near, but such a cat would be awareof it. For this reason, black cats have long been linked to death. Ignorantpeople wrongly fear them for this association. But just because they can seeinto the spirit realm, that does not mean that black cats are agents of death,or that they are evil.“Sometimes, we need to heed subtle signs, for such signs may be more than theyseem. Especially down here. I never let any sign down here go unnoticed, orunheeded.”“But what use could having such a creature be?”“While it is rare for spirits to drift through our world, it could possibly beuseful to know when they are near.”Magda didn’t know what good that could be to her, but she didn’t want to dismissIsidore’s words out of hand. “So you think that this cat coming to me is a signthat I should keep her around to know when spirits are near?”“She is shadowing you. Perhaps you should heed such a sign.” Isidore shrugged.“It could even be that a spirit guided the cat your way to be a comfort to youin your loneliness.”“So you really think that she may be a sign from the spirit world?”Isidore smiled. “I couldn’t say. She might have simply been hungry and smelledthe food you had with you.” Isidore’s enigmatic smile ghosted away. “But Iwouldn’t dismiss such a creature coming into the circle of your life energy.”Magda had come to a spiritist seeking answers. It occurred to her that it mightnot be a bad idea to listen to her advice.“Shadow it is then.” She stroked a hand along the sleek fur of the cat’s back.“Do you like that, name? Shadow?”The cat meowed as if to answer. Before long, Shadow was in Magda’s lap, hopingfor more chicken. Magda pulled off pieces, giving her a much-needed meal. Whenthe cat had had her fill, she curled up and started cleaning herself.“How long have you been a spiritist?” Magda asked as she stroked the warm littlecat. Shadow purred in appreciation.Isidore feigned shock. “Me? A spiritist? No, I am only—”“You are the spiritist, Isidore.”Isidore had wanted to be protected herself, but had not asked for protection forthe spiritist. In her alarm at hearing about the threat, and then with thedistraction of the cat showing up, she had forgotten to keep up the pretense.That told Magda what she had suspected all along, that there was no one else.Isidore was the spiritist.Isidore stiffened a little, falling back into her role. “I am flattered that youwould think I am such a woman, Magda, but I am merely her humble servant.”“You play the role of aide to the spiritist so that you will not have toentertain appeals directly. That insulates you and gives you an easy way to turnpeople away, saving time and trouble. You work with the gifted, so you need tobe able to keep others at arm’s length without having to turn down the appealsdirectly. More than that, you are empathetic and don’t like to disappointpeople, but you have more important work and this small deception enables you toremain focused on that work without the streams of supplicants who would beeager to contact deceased loved ones if word got out that you were a spiritistand you would be willing to help them.”Isidore sat quietly, hands nested in her lap, not offering any comment.“I will not betray your secret, Isidore. But there is no one else. You are thespiritist. Your eyes are covered to help hide this world from your vision sothat you may look into another world. That is what you do. You look into thespirit world.“I have helped you to be safe from the dream walkers as you go about yourimportant work. Please, Isidore, my work is important as well. Let’s not playgames.”As Isidore finally released a deep sigh, her posture sagged a bit. She wasapparently relieved to no longer have to lie.“You have it mostly right.”“What do you mean?”“It is more than a blindfold keeping me from seeing this world.”Magda reached out and laid a hand over Isidore’s. “Show me.”As the cat curled up for a warm nap in Magda’s lap, Isidore nodded, then reachedup behind her head to the leather thongs holding on the blindfold. When at lastit was untied, she slipped it away and sat a bit stiffer, nesting her handsagain, letting Magda look at her face.Isidore’s eyelids were closed over sunken sockets where her eyes should havebeen. They were not sewn shut. There were no eyelashes. It looked as if she hadnever had eyes, or as if they had been injured and healed over.Magda knew better. She knew that Isidore had not been born this way, nor had shebeen injured.“How did you lose your eyes?” Magda asked, fearing that she already knew theanswer, fearing that this was wizard’s work.“Is that the question you have come to ask the spiritist?”“No. It is a question I would ask from one woman to another, because the reasonfor it greatly concerns me.”Isidore thought a moment, her head turning blindly as if trying to see Magda.“My eyes were taken from me so that I could see.”“You were altered by wizards.”“Yes.”“I am sorry for your loss,” Magda said in soft sincerity.The woman’s brow bunched with the ache of tears that could not flow.She cleared her throat. “No one has ever been sorry for my loss.”“That makes it even worse, then, doesn’t it?”The young woman nodded. “In a way. But the loss is far greater than you couldsuspect.”“Tell me why you would allow this to be done to you.”“I did not allow it, the way you may think. I sought to have it done, asked tohave it done, so that I could see into the spirit world.”Magda was incredulous. “Why would you do such a thing?”“I had need enough.”“Need enough? Why would you request wizards to alter you in such a way? Whywould you have him take away your eyes?”“It’s not a pretty story. Either to tell, or to hear.”“I imagine not.” Magda steeled herself. “But I would hear it, if you arewilling.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 Isidore nodded, then started to reach up as if to wipe away tears. Her handpaused when she realized that she could no longer make tears any more than shecould see. The hand sank to her lap.“I lived in Grandengart. The name means ‘guardian at the gates.’ It’s an oldname that signifies Grandengart’s place at the southern fringe of the New Worldand long standing as an outpost in the trackless lands of the wilds. The OldWorld lies beyond to the south.“Because of its location it has long been a crossroads of trade routes in theNew World. Rare trade goods also came up from a few distant places down in theOld World. Grandengart had for ages been an outpost as well, the place wherepeople first come over from the Old World. Trade relations with peoples of thewilds and distant places to the south had always been good.“The several thousand people who lived there mostly made their living in one wayor another because of the trade. For many of the peoples who inhabit vaststretches of inhospitable land of the wilds, and the merchants who dealt withthem, we were a trusted place to do business. As a result, with all thedifferent kinds of people and goods passing through, it was an exciting, vibrantplace to live, with different cultures and beliefs, as well as plenty offascinating stories of far-off places from all the travelers.“A while back we began to see the first signs of trouble. Rare spices,foodstuffs, and other commodities from the South began to slow and then haltedaltogether. Everyone considered that a worrisome sign in and of itself. For atime there was no word. Then trickles of people fleeing the new rule down in theOld World began to come through, headed north.“When trade stopped, timber coming down from the North, a scarce commodity downin that part of the world, began piling up, awaiting transport to arrive frombuyers in the South. That transport never arrived. Foods waiting to be movedrotted.“With all that trade halting, people began to worry about how they would make aliving. They worried, too, about what the distant signs of trouble could mean,not just for themselves, but for people they know to the south.“I was the sorceress assigned to serve the people of Grandengart. People fromthe South, down in the Old World, didn’t hold much with magic. They alwaysstayed well away from me as they passed through. But the people of Grandengartrelied on me for my abilities, my skills, but mostly for protection fromshapeless worries.“To most people I possessed inscrutable abilities, so in a way I was not exactlyone of them. As a result I sometimes felt that I was little more than theirtalisman meant to somehow keep shapeless evil from their door. People seemed tothink that merely having a sorceress’s powers nearby was a vaguely beneficialthing, that it would somehow ensure good fortune, much like their prayers to thegood spirits for a safe journey.“Their worries about the increasing signs of trouble to the south, though, werenot so shapeless. They looked to me for help with this troubling development.“I didn’t know exactly what I could do about it. Magic didn’t offer any solutionthat I could see, although it seemed as if it must to those who knew littleabout it. In the end I traveled here, to the Keep, to see the council, hopingthey could help. They told me that they would take the concerns of the people ofGrandengart, as well as the details I had offered, under consideration, alongwith other reports they were receiving. They suggested that the unrest wouldlikely soon calm down and trade would resume. One of them even suggested thatperhaps a bridge had washed out and it was nothing more than that. I told themthat from what I had heard from people fleeing from the South, there was a newruler and his forces were the source of the unrest. They seemed disinclined tosee such a change in rule as necessarily a bad thing, because the old rule wasso fragmented and inefficient.“While I could get no immediate help from the council, they did promise that assoon as troops were available they would send a detachment to investigate thesituation. I decided that until the troops could be sent, it would be best if Ireturned home at once. I knew how nervous people were, and I wanted to be therefor them.“I arrived home the day after General Kuno and his forces from the Old Worldflooded across the border and swept through Grandengart. Even if some of us sawthe storm building, until the day Kuno arrived, the world had been at peace.”Magda stiffened in alarm. “General Kuno? Right hand to the emperor?”Isidore nodded. “Emperor Sulachan himself sent Kuno north and through my homeplace.”Magda took a deep breath and let it out with a sigh. She knew from Baraccus thatGeneral Kuno was ruthless. He struck fear into the hearts of anyone in his path.Emperor Sulachan wanted the world under one rule, the rule of the Old World. Hewanted everyone to bow to him as emperor of it all. She knew, too, that thestart of the war had been both swift and violent. Apparently, it had started inIsidore’s hometown.“General Kuno had everyone brought to the town square,” Isidore said, “where hetold them that this was a new day, that the world order was about to change, andthey had been selected to be given the opportunity to join the cause of the OldWorld, and bow to Emperor Sulachan. He told the men that the choice was theirsto choose for their families to either stay a part of the New World, or join theempire of Sulachan. He asked for a show of hands of those who would side withthe emperor, or those who would decline the offer.“Remember, we were not yet at war, so people mostly didn’t yet realize thedanger of choosing to side against Emperor Sulachan. This was to be the day thatthe world would learn of that danger.“The men with General Kuno kept track of how each person voted, then theydivided up the people of the town. Those choosing to bow to Emperor Sulachanwere put on one side of the town square, those against on the other. It was thenthat people began to panic. Soldiers grabbed anyone who tried to run and keptthe two crowds packed together, surrounded by a ring of steel. A number of thosetrying to flee were brutally cut to pieces before everyone’s eyes to discourageanyone else from attempting to escape.“Soldiers took the people who had voted against bowing to the emperor out to digholes along the side of the road into Grandengart. They then made the peopleerect poles with the timber that the townspeople used for trade.“To the full, screaming panic of the people, most of the men who had votedagainst, along with their family members, were hoisted by their wrists up ontothe poles. A small number of old men were made to watch as General Kuno’ssoldiers walked up both sides of the road, slashing the terrified people hangingby their wrists. The soldiers pulled down strips of their flesh, leaving musclesand ribs exposed. Other people were stabbed in the legs or stomach, but leftalive in their panic to hang there in helpless agony.“The townspeople who were left, those who had chosen to side with EmperorSulachan, after watching what was done to their friends and neighbors, weretaken as slaves and sent south.“The small group of old men who had been made to watch were released. They fledto later recount the terror far and wide so that other places would panic beforethe advancing forces of General Kuno and dare not resist Emperor Sulachan’swill.“When I arrived the next day after Kuno’s forces had left, the road intoGrandengart was lined on each side with poles, each holding a victim. Men,women, children—all were treated the same. There were over fifteen hundredpoles, each holding a person, each person alone in their agony, but close enoughto their neighbors, friends, and family to see them suffering and dying.“Mothers, watching their children screaming in terror and pain, blamed husbandsfor voting against joining the side of the Old World. Husbands had to endure thedying hatred of their wives and unimaginable suffering of their children for thedecision they had made.“Beyond the poles, at the end of the road, smoke from the smoldering ruins ofthe town rose in the still air high into the blue sky. Not one building was leftstanding. Everything had been burned to the ground by Kuno’s men.“Dogs and coyotes hounded the condemned, pulling and tearing at the strips ofskin still attached to them. They set upon the already dead. I threw sparkingflashes of fire to chase them away. Flocks of birds had come to feast as well. Iused booming bolts of air and scattered most of those as well.“In the bright sun, exposed rib bones of the victims stood out white against thered meat still left on them. Many of the bones had been picked clean. Most ofthe people were clearly dead, their middles torn open so that scavengers couldget at their organs. Between the blood, the fluids, and all those who had lostcontrol of their bodily functions, the stench was staggering.“While a number had died over the course of the night, many of the victims,perhaps one in every four people, were still alive. Most of those had long sincelost their voice from screaming. But they moaned, they cried, and they whisperedprayers that went unanswered.”“I walked up that road, between those poles as those still alive watched me,hoping that I, their trusted sorceress, could do something for them. Some criedout with their last breath for help.“Inky black ravens perched on the poles, warily watching me as I came up theroad, waited for me to pass before they resumed the feast. Some cawed loudly,hoping to drive me away from what they had claimed as theirs.”Isidore’s head turned to the side a bit, as if she was staring off into anotherplace in her mind’s eye. Her breathing was ragged and labored.“What did you do about the people on the poles who were still alive?” Magdafinally asked. “Could anything be done to help them? Could you use your gift tosave some of them, at least?”Isidore sat motionless for a time, staring at nothing in her lonely blindness,as if reliving the vision of what she had seen that terrible day.“They were beyond healing,” she whispered at last. “Those still alive used alltheir strength to beg me to deliver them from the unendurable pain. They beggedfor death.”“Could you heal none of them?”“All but one were well beyond healing of any kind, even from wizards far moretalented than me. There was nothing I could do to save their lives. Nothing.”Magda leaned in. “So what did you do, then?”Isidore turned blindly toward Magda. “All I could do was spare them theirremaining suffering so as to ease their souls’ final journey into the spiritworld. As I hurried up the road, I first used a slash of my power to sever theropes holding each of them up on the poles. Hanging there like that had made itdifficult to breathe. Many of the dead had suffocated. Each person in turncollapsed to the ground as I parted the ropes.“Then, I went from one of those still alive to the next and held their hand fora moment as I offered each a few quiet words of comfort, sympathy, and a promiseof a gentle end to their agony.“It felt as if I were outside my own body, watching myself moving from oneperson to the next, holding their hand, offering words of comfort, and thenstopping their heart. I couldn’t believe I was doing such things. I had neverenvisioned my abilities being put to such a use as to have to end the lives ofthose I was supposed to be protecting.“But I knew that I had to do it. I was there to serve these people, people whohad rarely thanked me for my efforts, and this was the only service I could nowoffer them. To think, after living among them, each person thanked me more thanever before for what I was about to do to each of them. They wept with joy andwhispered their deepest appreciation that I was about to end their life.”Isidore’s breathing came with difficulty as she labored to continue the story.“Then I used my gift to stop their hearts, each one in turn, one at a time, overand over. I had to do it more than four hundred times in all.“It took until long after nightfall before I had delivered all but one of thepeople of Grandengart from their agony. I was not quite through with my work. Ihad silenced the moans, and stopped all but one heart.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 “It was long after the moon should have been high in the sky when I finallyreached the last man,” Isidore said. “But there was no moon because a thickovercast had gradually covered the sky, like a shroud of gray darkness pulledover the dead. I knew that it would soon begin to rain.“The last man alive was trembling and having difficulty breathing. His name wasJoel. He was a baker. Every day he had used to bring me a small loaf of bread.He would never accept payment. Joel said that it was his small part to make surethat Grandengart’s sorceress did not want for a meal.“Truth be told, Joel had feelings for me, though he never spoke of thosefeelings or acted on them, except to bring me that loaf of bread. I think it wasan excuse for him to see me.“Joel’s wife had died in childbirth before I came to Grandengart. He was lonelyand terribly sad. There was something about him, something beneath the sadness,that I liked, but knowing about the death of his wife and unborn child I feltuncomfortable saying much to him, other than to ask as the town’s sorceress howhe was and if there was anything I could do for him. He always said that he wasfine and turned down any offer of help.“Over time, my feelings for him grew, but in light of his loss I felt that itwas not my place to speak of such things. I knew that he would be a long time ingetting over such a loss and felt that I had to respect the pace of grieving andfelt that I shouldn’t interfere. So, as much as I longed to tell him of myfeelings, I kept my distance. Yet every day he would bring me a loaf of bread,as if that was the only way he could reach out to me.“I was exhausted by the time I reached Joel lying there on the ground in thedark beside the road. By then I could barely walk. I was in shock and covered inthe blood of the people I had just helped to die.“I fell to my knees beside Joel and took up his hand, knowing that I had to bestrong enough to bring death to one last person. I held his hand to my own heartand put all my strength into sending as much comfort as I could into him.“But in so doing I sensed that, unlike all the others, he was not entirelybeyond healing. I knew that there was a small chance to save his life.“I remember seeing his cracked lips move in the moonlight. He wanted to saysomething. I gave him a sip of water from a waterskin, as I had for so manyothers, and then bent close.“He told me that he was sorry for my ordeal. I told him that I was shamed that Ihad not been there for them, that had I been there I might have done something.He said that he had been there, and he knew for certain that I could have donenothing against such brutal men.“He said that they’d had gifted among them, men with fearsome powers. He saidthat had I been there, I would be hanging on a pole along with the rest of them,and then I would not be there to help end the suffering.“Joel said that he thought it was meant to be this way so that I could help thepeople.“I told Joel that I thought I could save his life, that he could be healed. Itold him to hold on, to be strong. I spent several hours hunched over him in thedark, healing what I could. I knew, though, that he needed more than I couldprovide.“I knew that Whitney, a town to the north, would have the healers needed. Ihelped him onto my horse and we started riding north to Whitney. I rode as hardas I dared push the horse. We rode the rest of the night and the next day. Ioften had to use my gift not only to give the poor animal endurance to continue,but to give Joel the strength to hold on to life.“We almost made it to Whitney. Joel cried out in pain. I tried to hold him up,to keep going, but he couldn’t ride any farther and begged me to help him to theground.“As I knelt beside Joel, I realized then that the one person I thought I mightbe able to save was now beyond help. I knew through my gift that despite howdesperately I had worked to help him, his internal injuries were too severe. Icould sense his life slipping away. It was a cruel blow after such hope I couldsave him. In that moment there wasn’t anything I could do to prevent Joel fromdying.“As I bent close, clutching his hands in mine, tears running down my face, hesaid that he was sorry for what he had done. I asked him what he meant. Joelsaid he had clung to the memory of his dead wife to the exclusion of everythingelse. He said that he had loved her but she had passed. He should have gone onand embraced the life he had left to live. He said that he knew I was remainingsilent out of respect.“He said that if he had told me of his feelings, maybe I would have been open tohim and then we both could have had happiness for that time. Instead, he hadclung to the dead rather than turning to the living. He said he should havelived his life, but now it was over and it was too late.“He wept as he told me that he was sorry that he had never given himself, or me,the chance to seek that happiness, and now it was too late and he was so sorry.His life was over without having lived what was right there all the time.“I sobbed uncontrollably as I confessed that I, too, had lived for the dead,fearing to reach out to him. I told him that I should have known better, that Ishould have sought to comfort him while encouraging him to use the time he hadto live his own life.“He said that he wished he had known that I would not have pushed him away. Hesaid he should have tried to get closer to me than to just bringing me a loaf ofbread every day. I laughed through the tears at that. He said that by respectinghis feelings for his dead wife, I had shown true compassion, and that he wishedhe had returned it.“Joel knew that the others of the town would be with the good spirits. He toldme that he would soon see his wife again in the spirit world, and regretted onlythat he had not lived the last couple years of his own life. He told me that oneday when my time too was done in this life, I would be back with them, with thepeople of Grandengart, where I belonged and would be welcomed. He promised to bewaiting for me where we would all be safe in the light of the Creator among thegood spirits.“Joel’s last words were for me to pray on the behalf of all those who had diedthat terrible night. He asked me to pray that the good spirits welcome them alland give them peace at last.“I promised that I would use my abilities to help guide them all into the spiritworld. He smiled, and as he thanked me and squeezed my hand . . . his lastbreath of life left him and he was gone.“On my knees, as the gentle rain began, I hunched over him and rained my owntears down on this poor man for all that he and the others had suffered, weptfor what might have been had we each had the courage to let the past go andembraced what life still had to offer.”Magda understood all too well that desolate agony of loss.“So, there I was beside the road to Whitney with the dead body of my friend,while back in Grandengart lay the corpses of my charges, my town. The corpses ofthe people I had failed.”Magda laid a hand on Isidore’s arm. “You did not fail them, Isidore. EmperorSulachan’s minions are as powerful as they are ruthless. Joel was right, youcould have done nothing to stop it. Don’t take on the guilt that rightly belongsto the killers.“Not many would have shown the courage you did in such a difficult situation.You did your people the greatest kindness possible. You were there for them toend their suffering when there was nothing else that could have been done.”“I thought so too. But as it turns out, after reaching Whitney and burying Joel,that was only the beginning of the nightmare.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 Magda stroked a hand along the silky back of the sleeping cat curled up in herlap. The cat’s contented purring served to emphasize the stretch of emptysilence.“The beginning of the nightmare?” Magda finally asked. “What do you mean?”Isidore took a deep breath. Her shoulders slumped as she let out a weary sigh.“After Joel died, I managed to lift him up and over the back of the horse.” Sheflicked a hand in an aside. “I used to be stronger than I am as you see me now.I’ve lost weight and muscle since then. I find that I rarely have much of anappetite.“Anyway, I rode most of that night, stopping only for a brief nap when neither Inor the horse could go on. It was the first sleep I’d had since arriving home toGrandengart. It was also the first of the terrible dreams that haunt me to thisday. The short rest was at least enough for me to be able to resume the journey.By late the next afternoon I finally reached the wheat fields and scatteredfarms at the outskirts of Whitney.“A man and his wife working a field saw me and must have realized that I washaving trouble. They both rushed out to the road to help. When they saw the bodyslung over the back of the horse, they said that he needed to be buried at once.They were kind enough to lead me to a small graveyard beside a clutch of oaks,the only trees in sight out on the plains of the southern reaches of the NewWorld. There, they helped me lift Joel down and then bury him.“I was in a numb daze from the whole ordeal, from traveling so long and hardwith the dead body of my friend, with tormented thoughts of what might have beenbetween us, and worse, what I might have done to stop the madness had I returnedhome from seeing the council just a little sooner. I hadn’t eaten in days and Iwas near delirious with exhaustion. Even so, I knelt beside Joel’s fresh graveand prayed earnestly to the good spirits to welcome him and all the others intotheir arms.“Hunched over his grave I again promised Joel that I would keep my word, givenjust before he died, that I would use my abilities to help make sure that theyall made it safely into the embracing shelter of the good spirits.“After that, the man and his wife, feeling sympathy for me, gave me some foodand water and then escorted me the rest of the way into Whitney. I think theythought that I might not make it on my own.“In Whitney I learned that a few of the terrified old men from Grandengart, theones who had been released by General Kuno to carry word of what had happened soas to spread panic, had done just that, coming through and telling everyone ofthe horrifying fate of Grandengart’s people. The whole town of Whitney wasbuzzing with the news, so the town officials were not surprised when I brieflyrecounted my story.“There were gifted there and they listened with even greater interest than theofficials, though they said nothing, when I told them what they had not heardyet, that I had gone from one dying person to the next, ending their suffering.“A number of the town’s people were already packing their belongings and moreyet had already left, all headed north. No one knew where General Kuno and hisarmy would strike next, but they wanted to flee to a more distant place wherethey thought it would be safer. I couldn’t really fault them.“A detachment of troops, sent by the council to look into the reports of troublebrewing to the south, happened to have just arrived in Whitney. I talked withthe commander and reported what had happened. I told him that I couldn’t burywell over a thousand bodies by myself and I needed help. I didn’t want my peopleto lie there and rot in the open or be scavenged by animals. All I could thinkof was that it was my duty to at least see them buried.“Fortunately, the commander was an understanding man. He and his troops took mewith them. We rode hard all the way back to Grandengart to attend to the dead asswiftly as possible.“When we got there, the dead were missing.”Magda blinked, not sure she had heard correctly. “Missing? What do you mean,they were missing?”Isidore lifted a hand in frustration and then let it drop back into her lap.“They were gone. Not a single corpse was there by the road where I’d left them.The town had been burned down. The rain had since doused the smoldering rubble.There were no bodies in the town, nor were there any beside the road where thepoles had been erected, where I had delivered them from their suffering.”“Did the troops believe you? Believe your story?”Isidore grunted bitter confirmation. “The ground was soaked with clotted blood.They believed me. The poles, each with the ropes still attached, were coveredwith blood as well. There were some remains still scattered about—the viscera ofthose that animals had ripped open. After inspecting the remains the commanderconfirmed that they were human.”Isidore again weakly lifted a hand. “But there were no bodies. None.”Magda hooked a lock of her short hair behind her ear, at first having expectedit to be long. She still wasn’t used to it being short.“I don’t understand. How could there be no bodies? What could have become ofthem?”“Well, I saw tracks that hadn’t been there before, so my first thought was thatmaybe General Kuno’s army had decided to turn back to the safety of the OldWorld and they had come back through Grandengart. I thought that maybe on theway back through they had decided to bury the dead rather than let them decayout in the open.”“No,” Magda said. “That doesn’t sound at all like what I know about Kuno.Baraccus told me that Sulachan personally selected Kuno to lead their forcesbecause he was so ruthless. Kuno wouldn’t care about any such decency as buryinghis enemy’s dead. Like Sulachan himself, he’s the kind who would havedeliberately left the bodies there in the open as a ghastly warning to anyonewho had thoughts of resisting. He uses tactics of terror to sap the will ofthose who will eventually have to face him.”Isidore was nodding as she listened. “Though it was the beginning of the war,before we had learned how truly brutal Emperor Sulachan and his forces were, thecommander I was with harbored no delusions. He said that any army that wouldcome in and torture and murder innocent people like that would not care aboutburying them. And then his men, as they searched, found evidence that the bodieshad been taken.”“Taken? What do you mean, taken?” Magda asked. The whole thing was not makingany sense to her.“The soldiers said that there were a lot of tracks showing that an army had comeback through and crossed over the road, headed south. There were drag marks onthe ground where it looked like the bodies had been collected into piles. Theground there was covered with even more of the gore. The drag marks ended atwagon tracks. Lots of wagon tracks.”Magda frowned. “You’re saying that Kuno’s army came back though and . . . tookthem?”“They came back and harvested the dead,” Isidore confirmed in an icy tone.Magda’s hand paused on the cat’s back. “Harvested the dead?” She tilted her headtoward the woman. “For what purpose?”Isidore shrugged one shoulder. “The officer was only able to say that itappeared that they had taken the dead with them, south, back to the Old World.”Magda pressed her fingertips to her forehead as she tried to make sense of it.“But why would they do such a thing? What would they want with the bodies?”Isidore’s hands opened a little in a vague, noncommittal gesture.Magda could only imagine the grisly state the bodies would have been in.Collecting hundreds and hundreds of days-dead corpses and taking them away inwagons would have been a sickening task. No one would have done such a thingwithout a powerful reason.Isidore offered no immediate insight into the mystery of what that reason mightbe. Magda thought that maybe it was simply such an outrage that the woman didn’twant to think about it, much less discuss it. By Isidore’s guarded response,though, Magda suspected that she knew more than she was revealing.Rather than press, Magda thought it best to try to soothe the woman’s terriblememories and let her tell the story at her own pace.“That certainly is gruesome. I can see what you mean about the nightmare justbeginning.”Isidore’s head was hanging. She didn’t lift it.“No. That is not what I meant when I spoke before of the nightmare onlybeginning.”Surprised, Magda stared at the woman for a moment. “Then what exactly did youmean?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 Isidore finally lifted her head. “Well, after that, the troops went south afterKuno’s army to make sure that they weren’t going to turn back and head northagain into the New World by a different route. But also, the commander thoughtthat, burdened as Kuno’s forces were with so many wagons, there was a goodchance that if they rode hard he could catch them. He was confident that he hada large enough force to fully extract vengeance when he did.“I didn’t know what to do at that point. With the commander and his troops gone,I was again alone. Most of my people from Grandengart were dead with theremainder captives, and my friend Joel dead and buried. I had no one.“I decided to go back to Whitney.”Magda thought that made some sense—there was nothing left of Grandengart andWhitney was the closest town. Yet, there seemed better options, such as going toAydindril, where she could have given what information she had to the council atthe Keep, and to the army. After all, this was an enormously significant event.It was the first attack in a war that many had long feared would eventuallyerupt and had now begun.Magda suspected that there was more to Isidore’s decision. “Other than Joelbeing buried there, did you have some reason for choosing to go back toWhitney?”Isidore rubbed a thumb back and forth on the side of her knee for a time beforeanswering. “Yes. I went back because I knew that there was a spiritist there.”“A spiritist?” Magda’s brow tightened. “Why did you want to see a spiritist?”“I was so distraught by everything that had happened, and by the final injusticeof the bodies being taken, that I wanted to consult the woman. I guess I wantedwhat most anyone else who goes to a spiritist wants. I wanted to know that Joelwas safely in the fold of the good spirits. I wanted to keep my promise to him.”Magda at last resumed stroking the cat. “I guess I can understand how you felt.So, did this spiritist help put your mind at ease?”Magda watched as Isidore’s thumb continued to rub back and forth on her knee.She spoke without lifting her head.“Sophia was much older, and quite experienced, although she told me that inrecent years she had not practiced her craft. She said that while she was proudof the work she had done, she had spent a lifetime at it and was finished withthe whole business of dealing with the spirit world. She said that she wantedonly to live the remainder of her life in peace. She refused to help me.“I persisted. I told her that it was important, that I had made promises.Promises not only as a friend, but as a sorceress. She angrily waved away therequest and said that my promises were not hers. I asked if she couldn’t see herway to helping out of compassion for all those innocent people, so that I wouldknow they were now at peace. She said that even if she wanted to, which shedidn’t, she couldn’t help because my loss was too fresh for me and that I wastoo distraught.“I asked if I could return later, after I had gained a bit of perspective. Shetold me that delving into the spirit world wasn’t what most people thought itwas, that her craft wasn’t intended as a means to commune with the dead to findcomfort for the living. She said that there were dangers involved that Icouldn’t begin to understand. Sophia again, and very emphatically, refused tohelp me.”Isidore smiled. “I guess I learned from Sophia much of my reluctance to seepeople who want to consult with the spirits. She advised me, as one sorceress toanother, to forget the whole thing.” The smile ghosted away. “As it turned out,it was very wise advice. Perhaps I should have listened.”Magda didn’t say anything, instead waiting for Isidore to go on at her own pace.The frail young woman brushed the back of a slender hand against the oppositecheek, as if wiping away an invisible tear, before she finally did.“Much like you, though, I had no intentions of taking no for an answer.”Isidore’s head turned up. “As it turns out, that persistence is a requirement.”Magda’s brow lifted in surprise. “A requirement to having a spiritist help you?”Isidore nodded. “I waited a few days, got some rest and spent some timethinking, then I went back. Sophia still refused to consult the spirits on mybehalf. I couldn’t understand why not. I decided to stay in Whitney and tryagain later.“Since I’m a sorceress, I made myself useful by helping some of the people inWhitney with ailments and such. I made a pest of myself with Sophia, asking tohelp around her home, until she started giving me little things to do to helpher. I asked roundabout questions as I cooked her meals, brought her firewood,banked her hearth, fetched her water, always trying to sound innocentlycurious—you know, conversational. I listened carefully to anything she wouldtell me. I was doing my best to get lessons out of her in any way I could.“I figured that if she wouldn’t give me the help I needed, then maybe I couldlearn enough to do it on my own. I’m a sorceress, after all, so I’m not withoutabilities. Although the methods involved were a mystery to me, I thought thatmaybe it wouldn’t be so complicated to learn just enough to check on the soulslost to me and find out if they were at peace. I guess I felt guilty for failingto be there for the people of Grandengart when Kuno had shown up and wanted tomake up for it.“The old woman, of course, knew what I was up to. She finally asked what it wasI hoped to accomplish by contacting the spirit world so directly. I explained mypromise to Joel to help make sure that he and all of the people of Grandengarthad made it safely into the embracing shelter of the good spirits.“She chuckled and asked what I thought one of the living could do to influenceevents in the spirit world. How did I think I could help souls gone to theunderworld? Did I think I could take them by the hand and lead them into theglory of the light of the Creator? Did I really think that the souls in theunderworld would never be able to find peace until I found it for them? Ofcourse I had no answers.“So I told her, then, of how the bodies of those killed in Grandengart had beenharvested and taken away. I told her that I was greatly worried about what thegifted down in the Old World were doing with the dead people of Grandengart. Itold her that I had a terrible feeling that the souls of those people were notat all safe.“That gave her pause.“Sophia became darkly moody and said again that such things were not theresponsibility of the living, and besides, no matter what we might wish we coulddo to help, we had no say in the spirit world. But the worry about why thecorpses had been taken nagged at her. I could see her demeanor change with themystery surrounding the harvesting of the dead.“One evening, she finally said that she would help me see that the people ofGrandengart were at peace, but on a condition.“Because I was a sorceress, and not the typical person who came to her forconsultation, she wanted me, in exchange for her help, to first learn from herto be a spiritist. She explained that it was an old and honorable craft, butwith an unfortunate stigma attached to it. She said that she was nearing the endof her life and wanted to pass her lifetime of knowledge on to someone of a newgeneration. She wanted the skills to live on.“I told her that I had no desire to become a spiritist. Sophia smiled and saidit didn’t matter to her if I wanted to or not, only that I did. She said that itwas a dying art and she had never found anyone willing to learn the old craft.She said that young sorceresses nowadays don’t really want to have anything todo with the world of the dead. They figured that they would have an eternity ofbeing dead and so they would rather spend their time living.“Sophia said that it was understandable for people to feel that way, but shebelieved in the value of what she did and didn’t want to see the old ways dieout. I certainly believed in the value of what she did. In fact, it seemed theonly thing of real importance to me at the time.“Still, as much as I wanted her help, I admit that I was repulsed by the idea oftaking up such a profession myself. She reminded me of how much I’d wanted thehelp of a spiritist, and said that there would be others in the future who wouldalso need such help. Sophia said that without younger people like me learningthe old ways, they would vanish forever and that help would be lost to them.“She told me that it might be my chance to make a difference for the future ofthe living. I told her that I would have to think on it.“Then we got the reports that the soldiers who had gone back with me toGrandengart and then gone south after General Kuno’s forces had beenslaughtered.”Magda gasped at the news. “Slaughtered? All of them?”Isidore nodded. “It had been a trap. Sophia thought that the bodies the enemytook had been the bait for the trap. Two men had escaped to tell what they saw.”“More likely Kuno let them escape to spread fear.”“I think you’re probably right. The men said that they were charging south andthought they were getting close when they were ambushed. All of our men, otherthan the two who had escaped, were killed or gravely injured.“After the battle, Kuno’s men tied all of our fallen soldiers together intobundles of a dozen or so, tied them by their wrists, and then fastened groups ofthem to the wagons of the dead from Grandengart. One of the two men said that itreminded him of stringers of dead fish. Kuno’s army dragged all the dead anddying soldiers away with them, some of them still alive and screaming in pain,or moaning in mortal agony.”Magda was incredulous. “I’ve never heard of an army hauling away the soldiersthey’d killed.”“They harvested the dead,” Isidore confirmed, “as I have since heard they havedone in other places as well. At the time, I thought that maybe it was yet morebait to entice others to chase after them. In a way, I was right.“After hearing about them taking the dead soldiers, I knew that I had to getSophia to help. Something was going on that no one understood but we all feared.I thought that the spiritist might be the way to discover the truth.“Sophia told me then that if I agreed to learn the craft, then I would be ableto draw more from the experience than simply having her report on what she saw.She said I would be able to see the truth I needed to know for myself, the truththat only I could grasp, the truth that only I could understand.“Though the idea frightened me, I could no longer shy away from what I needed todo, so I agreed.“Sophia then told me that the spirits had surely sent me to her for a reason,that there was a purpose, that I was meant for something.“She began teaching me that very night.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 “How long did these lessons take?” Magda asked.“Less time than I had thought they would. Being the daughter of a sorceress anda wizard, I had a good start on what I needed to know. My father, in particular,had a lifelong fascination with the underworld. He had learned a lot in his‘adventuring,’ as he called it, adventures dealing in where we all eventuallyhad to end up, he would say.“My mother would say that adventure was just another name for trouble. Somepeople whispered that my father had a death wish. I knew that wasn’t true, but Iwas fascinated by the fearless way he liked to challenge death. At the sametime, I shared my mother’s worry about it being trouble.“His adventures were mostly experiments with spell-forms, learning how theinterplay with Additive and Subtractive Magic worked. That was how he hadlearned so much. It was how he learned to balance on the cusp between worlds.That, and racing horses on overland courses through dangerous countryside.”“I see what you mean about him liking to challenge death,” Magda said.Isidore confirmed it with a nod and a sigh.“He even taught other wizards about the things he had discovered. From a youngage, much to the discomfort of my mother, he told me stories of his exploitswith experimental magic and the enthralling things he’d uncovered in how theinteraction between worlds worked. I would sit wide-eyed as he spun tales ofriding the rim, as he called it. He said that he believed that life and deathwere connected in much the same way as Additive and Subtractive Magic dependedupon each other to define their nature.“He saw that connection in everything, even in something as elemental as lightand dark. Consequently, he also saw such interdependence in simple things aswell.”“Simple things?” Magda asked. “Like what?”Isidore lifted one shoulder in a matter-of-fact shrug. “Where I saw a shadowcast across the ground, he saw the shadow, but also what he called the negativeshape created by the shadow. He said they were inextricably linked, lockedtogether, the positive shape and the negative shape, each depending on the otherto exist. He said that to truly appreciate one, you had to at least recognizethe contribution of the other.“Thus, he would tell me, you need the dark to show light, so you shouldn’t cursethe darkness. You needed death to define life.“Hence, the delight he found in his ‘adventuring’ into areas others foundterrifying. I guess you could say that his quest for understanding of the worldof the dead contributed to a greater appreciation for life. My mother would rollher eyes when he would tell me about such things, but sometimes, out of thecorner of my eye, I would see her flash him a private smile.“So, perhaps more than most, I already had a pretty good working knowledge ofthe Grace, how it is drawn and how it functions, how magic itself is connectedto Creation and death through Additive and Subtractive Magic, and howspell-forms can draw on these elements for power. My father did not viewdifferent aspects of the world, such as life and the underworld beyond the veilof life, as independent things, but rather as interdependent elements that wereall part of a great, unified whole. In that way, he said, we were all part ofall things.“Sophia said that such an upbringing, learning, and understanding put me yearsahead of most in becoming as a spiritist. She said that I had come to it as ifit were my destiny, although she said that she didn’t believe in fate.“The hardest part of Sophia’s lessons was that from my father’s teachings I wasaccustomed to thinking in terms of the whole, so learning not to see this world,but rather to exclude it from that whole, was difficult for me.”Magda frowned. “What do you mean, learning to exclude this world?”“To see into the spirit world, Sophia told me that I had to be able to lookbeyond what was around us in order to see into that other realm. She said that,while she didn’t herself know if it was true or not, some people believed thatthe underworld was all around us in the same place we existed, but at the sametime it was separate and so we couldn’t see it. I can understand that now that Iam blind; I can hear things I never before knew were there, but always were.“She blindfolded me for all our lessons. She said that it would help me to learnmore quickly. It was a few weeks after starting that she told me that it wastime to venture on my first journey to look into that other place.“By then, of course, after all I had learned—the warnings, the cautions aboutthe smallest mistakes, the grim stories of small things gone horrificallywrong—I was properly terrified.“Sophia believed in safety through preparation. We drank teas in the morning tocleanse our auras lest they snag on the veil and trap us. We took powerful herbsin the afternoon to dull our senses to the world around us so we would not failto see the dangers lurking in the dark world. In the evening we began the softchanting to condition our minds to open. The whole day, of course, in additionto the tea and herbs, we had been laying out spells and conjuring various formsof wards and protections. As the sun went down, we banked the fire. She saidthat flame was an anchor to this world and that if anything went wrong it couldlight our way back through the eternal night.”Isidore lifted an arm, gesturing around the room. “This is the reason, eventhough I am blind, that there are candles lit in here.” She smiled just a bit.“That, and of course so that others don’t stumble and fall on me.”Magda wasn’t able to appreciate the humor. “So once you were ready, then what?”“Sophia had me cut my finger and use blood to draw a Grace around where we wereto sit on the floor before the hearth.”Though Magda was not gifted, she had certainly spent a lot of time around thegifted. She had also been married to the First Wizard. She knew full well thesignificance of drawing a Grace in blood. A Grace connected Creation, the worldof life, and the world of the dead via pathways of magic.“I remember that it was an overcast, windy night, and dark as pitch,” Isidoresaid in a tone half to herself, as if drifting back to that night. “The blackworld outside the two tiny windows of Sophia’s home seemed foreboding andoppressive.”Isidore looked to be trying to return from her haunting memory. She paused towave a dismissive hand. “None of the details would matter to you. Not beinggifted, you likely wouldn’t understand most of it anyway. The important thing isthat we had to invoke the darkest forms of magic to summon up the darkness ofthe underworld. Then we drew spells with Subtractive threads that brought aboutthe parting.”“The parting?”“In the veil to the underworld,” she managed with difficulty.Magda thought that Isidore looked at the edge of composure. She covered hermouth with a hand, as if in her mind’s eye seeing again the horror of what shehad seen that night. Her brow wrinkled into tight furrows. Her chest heaved witheach ragged breath. Magda realized that Isidore was sobbing in the only way shecould even though she had no tears.Feeling a sudden pang of sorrow for the woman, for her terrible loss andcrushing loneliness, Magda lifted the cat and scooted around to sit close besideIsidore. Magda set the cat down to the side, where she stretched from her longnap. Magda put a comforting arm around the frail young woman. Isidore meltedinto the embrace, burying her face against Magda’s shoulder.Magda held Isidore’s head against her shoulder. “I’m sorry for asking you torecount such terrible memories.”Isidore pushed away, swallowing back her emotion. “No, I wanted to tell you.I’ve never had anyone to tell, except, of course, for the one who took my eyesfrom me. I wanted you to know, much like I had to know, what it means to be aspiritist, to practice such a sorrowful skill that puts you there in the midstof death.”“I understand,” Magda said.“I’m afraid that you really don’t.” It wasn’t said in a cruel or condescendingway, merely as Isidore’s expression of the simple reality. “I didn’t understandmyself until we actually pulled the veil of life aside and faced theunimaginable.”Magda listened to the silence for a while, then finally had to ask, “What didyou see beyond that veil?”Isidore stared off blindly into the memory.“I saw a place of darkness beyond dark,” she finally said in a haunted voice.“An endless place of souls that would take forever to see, and yet I glimpsed itall in an instant.“In that instant I saw what I had come to see, learned the truth I had come tolearn . . . and I was horrified.”“Horrified by seeing the world of the dead?”“No,” Isidore said. “Horrified by the truth.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 “I don’t understand,” Magda said. “What truth did you see?”For a time, the only sound was the sputtering of a few of the candles glowingaround the room. The cat sat silently on her haunches, as if waiting to hearwhat Isidore would say.“I saw Joel there,” Isidore finally said. “His spirit, anyway. That much of itwas a comfort—seeing the light of his soul there at peace.”Magda, her arm around the woman, squeezed Isidore’s opposite shoulder. Shedidn’t want to sound suspicious, or disbelieving, but she found it hard toimagine.“How is it possible, Isidore, considering how many millions upon millions uponmillions of souls there are in the underworld—the souls of everyone who has everlived and are all now there in the world of the dead—for you to be able toimmediately see the one you were looking for out of the multitude?”“Well, it’s rather hard to explain.” Isidore considered the question briefly.She frowned as she tilted her head up in thought. “You know the way you couldwalk into a vast gathering in the Keep, and despite how many hundreds andhundreds of people are there, you could always spot Baraccus immediately, pickhim right out of all those people?”Magda smiled sadly at the memory. “Yes, as a matter of fact I do recall suchevents.”“It’s something like that,” Isidore said. “It’s not the same, but that’s theonly example that I can think of that you might be able to grasp. Things don’twork the same way in the underworld as they do here. Time, distance, numbers,things like that are all different there. It’s like the same rules you are usedto don’t work that way there.”“Baraccus traveled the underworld,” Magda said, her mind wandering, “just beforehe killed himself.”She wondered what it had been like for him, what he had seen, and how it musthave affected him.“It’s not the same for a spiritist.” Isidore squeezed Magda’s hand in sympathy.“Baraccus was a profoundly powerful wizard who journeyed through the world ofthe dead. We don’t have that kind of power and are not venturing into theunderworld. A spiritist is only parting the veil just enough to look beyond foran instant.“Rather than going into that place, as Baraccus did, a spiritist is a sorceressinvoking her gift in a unique way. We are calling together a number of forcesthrough spell-forms, along with both Additive and Subtractive Magic conjured toa very specific task.“He was in that place. We are only looking in through a window.”“I see,” Magda said. “So when you looked through that window, what did you see?”“In that cauldron of magic, at the center of a storm of power, it all happens inan instant, yet that instant seems to last an eternity.“In that terrible spark of time, I saw the truth.”“And what was the truth that so horrified you?”Isidore bit her bottom lip as she gathered her courage. “The truth that theothers, the people of Grandengart who had died, were not there.”Magda frowned and leaned in close to the woman. She was unsure exactly whatIsidore had meant.“You mean you couldn’t find them? You couldn’t tell in the vastness of theunderworld that they were safe and at peace like you could with Joel?”Isidore shook her head emphatically. “No. I mean they were not there.”“I still don’t understand. They’re dead. Of course they’re there. Maybe you wereonly able to find Joel there, that way I could spot my husband across a room ofpeople, because you cared deeply about him, but you couldn’t do the same withthe others.”“No,” Isidore said with forceful certainty. “That is the truth that I saw inthat instant. I saw that their souls were not in the eternal world of the dead.Their souls, their spirits, whatever you want to call them, were not in theunderworld.”“Then where are they?”“I don’t know,” Isidore said. “I’ve been looking for them ever since that dayand I have not yet found them. All I know is that the spirits of the people ofGrandengart, the people whose bodies were harvested, are not in the world of thedead. And neither are the souls of the other bodies that have been harvested.”The silence felt suffocating. Magda had to remind herself to take a breath.“How can the dead,” she finally asked, “not be in the world of the dead? How isthat possible?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 “That was the very thing I wanted to know,” Isidore said. “I knew, as soon as Igrasped the truth of it, that I had to find the answer.”“But how?” Magda swiped her hair back off her face. “You said that you only holdthe veil open for an instant.”“Yes, but in that moment where all that magic, all that power, comes together,that spark of time seems to last an eternity. In a way, it isn’t an instant atall. In a way, it is an infinitely large piece of forever.”Magda felt as if she were getting lost. “How can that be?”“The reason, as I had learned from my father, is that there is no time in theeternity of death. Because there is no beginning, no end, there is no way tomeasure how long you’re there.”“But there has to be a way to measure how long an event lasts. Time stillexists. A day is still a day.”“Here, but not in the underworld. Here time is finite. Days start and end. Thereit’s eternal night.”“I still don’t understand,” Magda said.“Imagine encountering a rope stretched across your path. There is no beginningto your left, and no end to your right. The rope is infinitely long. It startedforever ago and runs on forever. How could you take a measured portion of it? Aportion of infinity is a contradiction. How could you, for example, measure outa fourth of forever? If you tried to cut a section out of such an eternal rope,it too would be eternal because the rope has no ends, so you cannot create themin something that does not have them as part of its nature. Just because youwant a beginning and an end for your convenience, that does not mean that theyexist. While they certainly exist here, in the underworld, those beginnings andends do not exist.“In the center of that vortex of power, time itself does not exist. A minute, aday, a year, they are all the same.“So, in that eternity of time, that instant I was there in eternity, I had allthe time I needed to search. In a way, I had forever. I searched forever.“I tried to ask Joel’s spirit where they were, but before I even began to formthe question, he told me that they were not there.“I saw people I knew from Grandengart, people who had died in the past, beforethat terrible day Kuno’s army arrived, people who had been old, or sick, even aboy I had tried to help but who had died of fever. None of them knew where therest of the people were, the people of Grandengart who had died out on the roadthat day.“Everyone I knew could only tell me that the others were not there. They werenot in the underworld.”“How is that possible?” Magda asked. “How can they be dead, but not dead?”Isidore showed the slightest hint of a smile. “That is the question that has ledme to be down here, among the husks of the dead.”The smile melted away, as if she were again lost in the vision of the memory.“I saw tormented spirits, evil itself, lost in the black sorrow of eternaldarkness. I dared not let my attention linger too long on such entities, lestthey pull me into everlasting night with them and tear my soul apart.“I saw the glory of the good spirits. I saw them at peace in gentle light. Ididn’t want to disturb them, but I had to find the people who were missing. Ihad to ask them to help me, to tell me what they knew.“One turned toward me, then, and I saw that it was Sophia’s spirit looking backat me through the soft golden glow. She said that I had already learned thetruth. She said that there was nothing more to learn there.”Magda’s brow drew together. “Sophia’s spirit? How could Sophia’s spirit turn andspeak to you in the world of the dead?”Isidore licked her lips. “Because she was dead.”“What?”Isidore cleared her throat. “It was her final journey to the spirit world. Iknew then that she would not be returning back through the veil with me. She hadgiven me the answer, and it was as simple as could be.”Magda was shaken to realize that Sophia, a woman she didn’t know except throughIsidore’s story, had died on the quest.“What do you mean, the answer was as simple as could be?”Isidore gently laid her hand on Magda’s arm. “It wasn’t complicated at all. Ihad learned it the very first thing. They weren’t there. The spirits of thosepeople weren’t in the underworld. That was the simple truth.”“If the simple truth is that they aren’t there, in the underworld, then thatwould have to mean that their spirits are still here, in this world, that theyhaven’t yet crossed over.”Isidore’s only answer was a hint of a smile."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 Magda couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “Is that what you’re saying? Thatthe spirits of all those people are still here in this world? I mean, if theyreally aren’t there in the world of the dead, then they could only be here,still in this world, still with us.” She caught herself glancing around theroom, half expecting to see spirits hovering around her. “Is that what you’resaying?”Isidore pressed her lips together for a moment, but then finally answered. “I’mafraid so. The truth is, though those people died, their spirits, their souls,have not yet been able to cross over to where they belong.”Magda didn’t know how that was even possible, or if it really was possible. Itoccurred to her that maybe they had crossed over to where they belonged, butthen they had somehow been pulled back.But why?She wiped a weary hand across her face. She feared to imagine the reasons forsuch a thing. She couldn’t begin to imagine the implications, the consequences.Her mind spun with a confusing tangle of thoughts. Isidore went on without Magdaneeding to prompt her.“Sophia’s spirit swept in closer, then. Her arms spread open like a falconswooping in to stop right before me. Even though I knew Sophia, I was terrifiedand felt as if I were frozen in place, unable to move. The spirit’seyes—Sophia’s eyes—blazed with the same light that enveloped her.“She stared out at me from the underworld and said, ‘You have the truth you cameto find.’ I didn’t know what to do. As if to answer, her spirit came closer yet,right up to my face, and said, ‘Find them!’“In that terrible instant, I had the answer I had come to find, the answer toeverything I needed to know. I knew, then, what I had to do.“I returned, having learned the truth I had journeyed to find. I returned aspiritist, but I returned without the spirit of the woman who had taught me. Ireturned in her place, taking her place.“Sophia lay dead beside me in the center of the Grace, her hand clutching theblindfold she had used when she had taught me to be a spiritist.”Magda could tell how much Isidore had come to like Sophia. She could see thegrief etched in Isidore’s sightless face. Magda felt terrible for Isidore thatthe search for answers had cost Sophia’s life.“I’m sorry about your friend.”Isidore smiled distantly. “Yes, she ended up being a good friend in many ways.She helped me learn what it was that I needed to do to help my people.”Magda cocked her head. “Are you saying that in making this discovery, that youthought it had become your duty to, to, what? Somehow escort missing ghosts tothe world beyond?”“I am saying that I knew then that the battle wasn’t over just because I hadgone to the underworld and found part of the truth. The war that had startedwith the murder of the people of my town had only just begun. I realized thenthat I am a warrior in this struggle.”“But you—”“The same as you are here because you, too, have become a warrior.”“Me?”Isidore turned to Magda, almost as if she were able to look right into her eyes,the way Magda imagined that the spirit of Sophia had looked into Isidore’s eyes.“You were wife to Baraccus, but since he died, you, too, have been searching foranswers to troubling questions. You, too, came here, to a spiritist, because youneed to learn the truth. You, too, want answers from beyond the grave, notunlike your husband had done. You do these things because you have the spirit ofa warrior.“Though you are not gifted, you have knowledge, abilities, and heart that makeyou a uniquely capable individual. You may think that anyone would do the thingsyou do, such as confronting the council, but in fact they wouldn’t, theycouldn’t. Only you could do the things that you have done, and you may be theonly one now able to uncover the terrible truth. Make no mistake, Magda Searus,the enemy fears you, and with good reason, even if you don’t know it.”“Fears me?”“Yes. That is the mantle you have taken up. By coming here seeking a way to findthe truth, you too have shown yourself to be a warrior. You have also shownyourself to be dangerous to them.”Magda remembered all too well, then, how the dream walker had been there,lurking in her mind, and then had tried to kill her.“I guess I have. I hadn’t thought of it in that way, but I guess I have. I’m noteven gifted, but they for some reason don’t want me looking for the truth.”“The journey to reveal the truth sometimes takes us to places we never expectedto go,” Isidore said. “But it is vital that the right person walks that pathbecause we are fighting against those who can enter our minds and steal oursouls. Perhaps they see, somehow, that you are the right person, and so theyfear you. Because they fear you, they will come after you.”Magda couldn’t argue. From the day up on the outer Keep wall, when she decidedthat she wanted to live, she knew that she was seeking something essential."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 “So where did your journey to discover the truth take you after you returned andfound Sophia dead?” Magda asked.Isidore gently ran a hand along the silky back of the cat curled up betweenthem. “After I buried Sophia, I stayed at her house for a time, making severalmore journeys to the spirit world. In doing so I came to realize that my battlewas not there in the world of spirits, but here, in the world of the living. Iknew that I had to find help where our fight is centered.”“You came to see the council,” Magda guessed.Isidore confirmed it with a nod. “I came to report what I had learned. Irequested to speak before a session closed to the general public. I felt that myinformation, if spread among people who didn’t understand such things, mightcause a panic. I wanted to speak only to other gifted, only to those who hadsome understanding of the work of a spiritist.“I finally found myself in the council chambers, standing in line in a closedsession waiting my turn to speak. I had thought that such a closed session wouldbe more private than it actually turned out to be. Even a closed session had asizable crowd of important people. All of them, it seemed, were there with news,reports, or concerns about the war.“A number of army officers started out with confidential reports on battlesalong with the details of intelligence that had been gathered. I could hear onlybits and pieces, but I grasped the general nature of their reports. A number ofwizards then brought forth information on what was being discovered about newweapons of magic we are up against. I could only hear bits of that as well, butwhat I could hear was frightening enough. Other gifted had proposals that neededapproval, mostly for weapons of our own.“Some of the officers and wizards, as they reported on enemy activity, leaned inand spoke in low voices as council members gathered in close, listening in stonysilence to what I couldn’t hear at all. I didn’t have to hear what they weresaying, though. I could read the worry on the faces of the council, worry thatthe war was not going well.“After the war reports, an old wizard not far ahead of me in line limped up whenit was his turn and spoke at length on the need to create another sliph so thatwe could quickly get information from place to place out ahead of the enemy.”Magda recoiled at the very idea of them creating another. She was not at allfond of the sliph. As far as she was concerned the one they had was one toomany. She forced her mind back to listening to Isidore’s story.“The council elder was respectful, but told the man that it had been a greatdeal of effort to create the sliph, and it had ended up causing trouble that noone had anticipated. The wizard started to argue his case but the council eldercut him off, saying that when the war started, the enemy had found their wayinto the Keep through the sliph.”Magda clearly recalled the ensuing carnage. Baraccus had ordered that one of thegifted guard the sliph at all times to prevent anyone from again slipping in toattack them.She knew one of the wizards, Quinn, who was assigned the lonely task of standingwatch over the sliph. He had grown up with Magda in Aydindril. It was a grimduty guarding the sliph, but Quinn didn’t seem to mind. He said it gave him timeto write in his journals. He was fond of recording details about events at theKeep, information about people he knew, and his thoughts on the state ofpolitical intrigue. Magda had asked if she could one day read his journals. Hepromised that she could, but said she would likely be bored.“The old wizard hadn’t known about this breach and fell to stunned silence,”Isidore said. “They thanked him but denied the request. They told him to insteadcreate some additional journey books to help with his communications problems.“As the old wizard bowed and departed, the next man in line right ahead of meimpatiently stepped up. He was a tall, broad-shouldered wizard not much olderthan me. He wore a beautiful sword—a rare thing for a wizard to do. That’s why Inoticed it. Nor did he wear the more common robes that most wizards wear.“Since I was next in line behind him, I was able to hear the entireconversation. The faces of the council turned sour at the sight of the youngman. One of the councilmen asked, ‘What is it this time, Merritt?’”Magda remembered the name. The wizards that Tilly and she had encountered in thedark passageways earlier that day had told them that Merritt had just gottensome more men killed. They had been quite angry about Merritt’s refusal to help.“Merritt told the council that he was now confident that his method to create aperson who could elicit truth was achievable.” Isidore tilted her head towardMagda. “That caught my attention.”It did Magda’s as well, but for a different reason. Magda had never liked theidea of altering people with magic.“The council only listened briefly before interrupting him to say that they’dheard his proposal before and in their judgment his idea was beyond the abilityof any wizard. Merritt insisted that since he had last talked with them he hadstudied every aspect of the process and then worked through an extensive seriesof verification webs to satisfy himself that he was right. He said that not onlywas it achievable, he believed he could do it. He told them that the purpose wascritical enough that it needed to be pursued.“They agreed about the theoretical value of the objective, but asked, if hethought it was possible, why hadn’t he done it? Why hadn’t he already succeededin accomplishing such a thing?“Merritt said that he would first need some arcane celestial calculations tocomplete the process, and then a willing subject. They asked what celestialcalculations he needed. I couldn’t hear his answer, but several members of thecouncil laughed. Another smacked a hand on the table in anger and told Merrittthat he was out of his mind.“Merritt was not cowed when they told him that the existence of such templateswere only speculation. In a clear, quiet voice he told them that he knew what hewas doing. He said that he had been able to learn through his research that suchocculted calculations would have to exist. He said that he was sure that theformulas from before the star shift had survived. He said that at the leastthere had to be charts for a seventh-level breach from which he could plot hisown templates.“Merritt assured them that if he could get the rest of what he needed, he couldcreate a weapon, a person, who could infallibly pull truth from any lie.“All the councilmen started talking at once. The elder interrupted them and toldMerritt that, based on what he had heard and what he knew, the attempt to createsuch a weapon would likely result in the death of the subject. He said that theenemy took such risks with lives, but we did not.“Merritt didn’t answer. He stood with his back straight and let the othercouncilmen similarly denounce his ideas. By the things they were saying, I’m notsure that the council even understood Merritt’s concepts. The things he wastalking about were well over my head, yet I was able to grasp sparks of hisbrilliance in the things he said. But I don’t know enough to judge the accuracyof Merritt’s claims. The council certainly didn’t seem to think highly of them.“The elder asked if he was correct about the danger to the subject. Merritt wassilent for a time and then quietly said that while he was confident that hecould do it, he had always been honest about the lethal risks involved. But, heasked them, how many would die without his weapon. They sat back in theirchairs, unable, or unwilling, to say.“The elder finally leaned forward again and said that there was nothing theycould do to help him because they didn’t know if such seventh-level riftcalculations even existed, but if they did, the council didn’t possess them.Merritt then said that since the council wasn’t able to provide him with thezenith formulas he needed, he would have go to the First Wizard himself. Severalcouncilmen laughed and said that he could try.”Magda now knew why she had recalled the name Merritt when she had heard it backin the passages on the way to see the spiritist. She remembered Baraccus cominghome after a private meeting that had unsettled him. Magda had asked whattroubled him. He had stood at the window looking out at the moon for a long timebefore he finally said that a brilliant wizard had come to him seeking somevaluable and rare rift calculations for creating a seventh-level breach. Magdahadn’t known what that meant, but there was no doubt in her mind as to theseriousness of the issue. She asked if Baraccus had given the man what heneeded.Baraccus had said, “I couldn’t give Merritt the formulas he needs. I wish Icould, but all the breach calculations are locked away in the Temple of theWinds, out of reach in the underworld.”Magda knew, in Isidore’s story, that Merritt was not destined to get what heneeded by visiting the First Wizard.“Finally,” Isidore went on, “the elder suggested to Merritt that he go back towork on lesser tasks until he could come up with something worthwhile, somethingnot outside the realm of possibility.“When Merritt passed me on his way out, I could see that his jaw was set and histeeth were clenched. His fist was tightly gripped around the wire-wound hilt ofhis sword. I felt sorry for him because I heard something in his voice that Iliked.”Magda came out of her thoughts and glanced over at the woman. “What do youmean?”Isidore shrugged. “I don’t know. Sincerity. Competence. I could tell that heknew what he was talking about even though the council wasn’t taking himseriously.“And his eyes . . .”“What about his eyes?”Isidore shrugged self-consciously. “I don’t know. They were an unusual color forone thing—on the green side of hazel. But it was what I could see in his eyesthat caught me up.“When he looked at me, I was stopped dead by his gaze. It was like he could lookright into my soul. Even though he was quietly angry at the council’s rejectionof his request, there was still something gentle about his eyes. Through theanger in them, I could also see his compassion.”Even in the soft candlelight, Magda could see that Isidore was blushing. “Hemade you feel safe,” she guessed.Isidore nodded. “And I felt bad for him. I thought they were failing torecognize his true ability, his potential. I guess that because I’m a youngsorceress I know what it feels like to have people not take you seriously whenyou really do know what you’re talking about. Sophia had taken me seriously, butfew others ever did.”“What about your meeting with the council?” Magda asked. “Did they agree to helpyou?”Isidore let out a deep sigh. “When my turn came, the council sympathized with mystory, but said that there was nothing they could do about the tragedy.“I suspected that they didn’t entirely believe me. I can’t say that I blamedthem. Most people, even most wizards, don’t really know much about theunderworld, so the council couldn’t grasp the significance, the danger, of thethings I was telling them any more than they could grasp the insights Merritthad brought them. My father would have, but these men hadn’t spent a lifetimestudying the underworld the way he had.“The council’s view was that as tragic as it was, the people from Grandengartwere dead and therefore beyond help. The elder said that they needed to worryabout the living.“No one on the council could see that my discovery had a direct bearing on theliving, and especially on keeping the living alive.“The elder looked me in the eye and said that they had a great many importantthings to worry about. Though he didn’t say it, I got the distinct impressionthat he meant to scold me for wasting their time.“I said that with the war growing day by day I completely understood, but, as asorceress and a spiritist, I believed that this had something important to dowith that war and that it was somehow tied into it all. I said that I fearedthere was more going on than anyone was aware of and that we were all at fargreater peril than anyone realized.”Magda had been before the council a number of times and knew full well theircapacity for detachment.“What did they say?”“Well, after a moment’s thought, the elder leaned back in his chair andsuggested that perhaps I could find a wizard willing to help me. He said that ifI could find such a wizard, I was welcome to his help.“One of the other councilmen chuckled and suggested that I seek the help ofyoung Wizard Merritt, that maybe I could take his mind off his daydreaming.”Magda was afraid that she knew all too well what had happened next."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 “So,” Isidore said, “considering the possibilities of what the enemy could bedoing with the bodies they had harvested and what they might be doing to preventthe spirits of those poor people from finding their rightful way into the spiritworld, and why they would do such ghastly things, I decided that my best chancewas to look for Wizard Merritt.”Magda was not liking where the story was going, especially since she alreadyknew that a wizard had taken Isidore’s eyes, and it seemed that Merritt was aman already engaged in the secretive business of altering people with magic intosomething other than the way they were born. She knew that some such alterationswere relatively minor, but some, like the sliph, were monstrous transformations.“Inquiring where I could find Merritt, I began to learn that people didn’t laughat him, the way the council had. People were afraid of Merritt.”Magda was surprised by this news, especially in light of the way the council haddismissed him. “Afraid of him? You mean because he alters people into weapons?”“Well, yes, to an extent, but it’s actually more than that. They are afraid ofhim because he’s a maker.”“A maker?” Magda leaned in. “Are you sure?”She knew that the things made by such wizards often frightened people, and withgood reason. She also knew that true makers were exceedingly rare and opinionsof them tended to be contentious. She was beginning to better understand why thecouncil hadn’t wanted to deal with Merritt.Isidore nodded. “That’s one of his gifted talents. He makes all sorts of things,everything from exquisite leather bindings heavily invested with wards for booksof magic, to piles of edged weapons that cut in ways that steel alone can’t, tocomplex metal creations I couldn’t even begin to describe and can only wonderat. He even carves beautiful statues from marble.“His place was littered with an array of metal objects left all over the floor,sitting around the statues, and piled in corners. There were knives stacked onsome tables and swords neatly arranged on others. I’d never seen the likes of itin my life. It reminded me a bit of the blacksmith places I’ve seen, exceptcleaner and, I don’t know, more refined, I guess.”Magda smiled. “I’m familiar with strange objects left in corners. My husband wasa maker, though I rarely heard that name applied to him.”“Really?” Isidore asked. “Baraccus was a maker as well as a war wizard?”Magda nodded. “When I met him he was already First Wizard, so that’s the waypeople referred to him, the way they thought of him.”In fact, people were hesitant about calling him a maker, so they were eager torefer to him as “First Wizard.”“Despite his duties and responsibilities,” Magda said, “Baraccus was alwaysmaking things. He would often sit at a worktable late at night and craft themost intricate things I’ve ever seen, yet I always knew that some of thosethings, despite how beautiful they may have been, were actually quite deadly.“Not long after we were married I asked him why, with so many responsibilitiesand other things to do, he took the time to sit at that table and make things.He smiled and said that he was a maker, and driven to make things.”“That’s a maker,” Isidore said. “That’s the way they are. Creativity in largeand small ways defines their nature in everything they do.”When he had first mentioned that he was a maker, Magda had confessed to Baraccusthat, although she’d heard whispers about “makers,” she didn’t really know muchabout them. At that time, a lot of things having to do with his abilities were amystery to her. He had patiently explained how the gift manifested itself invarious ways in different people. He said that as a war wizard his giftcontained a number of these discrete elements.Magda had been surprised. She’d always thought that being a war wizard was aunique talent in and of itself. She remembered him smiling and saying that a warwizard’s power was not a singular ability, but its strength actually came from acombination of components.He explained that prophecy sometimes guided a war wizard. If combat was calledfor, such a man could envision a battle plan, or wield a blade, or sometimesfocus the force of his rage into destructive power, or do the opposite and callforth his ability to heal the gravely injured. He said that in his case, if astronghold and defenses were needed to protect people he also knew how to buildthem because he was a maker. All of those things and more, added together, hesaid, made up his unique ability as a war wizard.She recalled how his eyes lit up when he explained that makers were more,though. They were actually artists, he said, and true artistic ability was asrare among wizards as it was among those without the gift. And, like trueartistic ability, a lot of people thought they had it, but few actually did.According to Baraccus, this genuine artistic ability enabled exceptional makersto use magic in creative ways that others had never imagined. He said that allnew spells, all new forms of magic, all new uses for spells, were firstenvisioned by these kinds of makers.Baraccus had told her that while a number of wizards could make things, the sameas the ungifted could make things, it was this component of artistic ability increating new things that took it to another level and made true makers more rarethan true prophets.That was also part of the reason that people feared them. They could conceive ofand conjure what had never before been done. New things were frequently treatedwith suspicion, while new things having to do with magic were usually treatedwith great suspicion.Baraccus held that without makers magic would stagnate, its scope left toaccidental discoveries and to those who learned what to do through rules,formulas, and methods. Without that element of imaginative artistic ability, thegifted couldn’t expand on magic or build it into new forms. Without makers toshow them new ways, show them new forms of magic, the gifted were left withdoing only that which been done before.Magda had always heard that there were rules and procedures that had to befollowed in order to make magic work properly. She thought it must be ratherlike baking bread, that it had to be done correctly. She asked Baraccus how amaker could get magic to work properly if they weren’t following rules,formulas, and methods.He laughed and asked how she thought all those things arose in the first place.Where did the rules originate? Where did the formulas come from? How were themethods first discovered?Who created the first shield? Who first used the gift to mend a broken bone? Whofirst cast wizard’s fire?Makers, Baraccus told her, first conceived of all those things and more. Theycreated forms of magic that others then went on to mimic and copy and use. Whatwas at first remarkable in this way became common, eventually acquiring rulesand formulas and methods. But it was the creativity of makers that first showedthe way. Makers created new recipes, as it were. Those who couldn’t wield magiccreatively had to follow the recipe someone gave them.Magda remembered the passion in his voice as he told her about such things.Making things was in his soul. Creating new things seemed to be his spark oflife.“Baraccus told me that without makers there would be no new conjuring and magicwould be forever confined to simple things that were endlessly copied. He saidthat it takes makers to think up and create what never before existed.”Isidore smiled as she nodded. “That’s the secret about magic that most people,even most of the gifted, don’t really understand. The things created by a makerare endlessly imitated and copied to the point where people cease to think aboutwhere such things originated. People who have lived with a particular form ofmagic their entire life tend to assume that it always existed.”“I guess that’s because true makers, such as my husband, are so exceedinglyrare.”“You are a rare person as well, Magda Searus. You seem to know more on thesubject than even most of the gifted I’ve ever encountered.”“I would never have understood about makers, either, had it not been forBaraccus teaching me about them. It was a subject close to his heart.” Magdashook her head as she remembered some of the things Baraccus had done. “He madesuch beautiful things. I still have all his tools. Since he died, I sometimes goto his worktable and pick them up, trying to feel a bit of him.”Isidore was smiling as she listened. “I wish I could have known him.”Magda’s own smile ghosted away. “Some of the things he made, I feared.”Isidore frowned. “Really? Like what?”Magda stared off into her memories. “At the start of the war, Baraccus createdan achingly handsome amulet of precious metals surrounding a bloodred ruby.Despite its mastery, its beauty, its intricacy, that amulet was at the same timeinvested with meaning I couldn’t begin to understand. Yet I knew how importantits meaning had to be to Baraccus because he always wore it.“One night, after a particularly disturbing report from some of his wizards, Ifound him again at the window, staring out at the moon. I knew that he wasthinking, as he often did, about the Temple of the Winds off in the underworld.He was clutching that amulet in his fist. I asked him what the amulet meant tohim, what its meaning was.“At first, I thought he wasn’t going to answer. But then, in a haunting voice,he said that it represented the dance with death. I was rather horrified bythat. He said the dance with death was the way of a war wizard.“I sat on the floor beside him that night, him standing, staring out the window,me with my back leaning against the wall beneath it while I held his hand, as heheld his private thoughts close, and that amulet in his other hand.“He was a remarkable man, a man that in many ways I don’t think I really knew.“And now he’s gone.”Isidore gently touched her arm.Magda came out of her thoughts to look over at the spiritist. “I’m hoping thatyou will soon know his spirit . . . at least enough to bring me the answers Ineed, or at least answers that can guide me in the right direction.”Isidore gave Magda’s arm a sympathetic squeeze. “We will find your answers,Magda. You’ve found your way to the right person, a person with the right kindof vision.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 Magda put thoughts of Baraccus out of her mind as she returned to the matter athand.She couldn’t bring herself to ask Isidore if Merritt had been the one to takeher eyes. She skirted the subject and asked something else instead to steer theconversation back to the subject at hand.“So what about you? What happened with Merritt? Was he able to help you withyour efforts to find the lost souls of Grandengart?”“Well, when I finally found his place”—she pointed a finger toward theceiling—“up under the southern rampart, of all places, Merritt seemed to bedistracted by his own problems, but he was kind enough to allow me in and atleast listen to my story. He listened as you have, and far more seriously thanthe council had. I guess people closer to your own age are more inclined to takeyou seriously.“He didn’t say much as I told him what had happened. He stared down at thatbeautiful sword of his, lying on a table, as he listened. He asked a fewquestions, though, and I got the sense from those questions that, perhaps evenmore than me, he considered the implications of bodies being taken, and worse,their spirits missing from the underworld, to be quite ominous. In a way, hisconcern made me worry even more and served to reinforce my conviction in what Iknew I had to do.“When I finished with my story he asked what it was I thought he could do tohelp. I told him that I believed that there was a threat that everyone wasignoring. He didn’t argue the point. I told him that because of my abilities asa sorceress and a spiritist I thought I had a unique understanding of theproblem, an understanding that the council was not taking seriously. He seemedin harmony with that as well.“I told him that while I believed the enemy was somehow meddling with the worldof the dead, I at first had not been able to come up with any solution tofinding the truth until I finally began to consider how I could use my abilityto do what had never needed doing before. I told him how I had eventually cometo understand that I needed to search the world of life for the dead, and forthat I needed a new way to use my abilities, a way that had never been conceivedof before.“Up until that moment, he had listened with great interest to the things I wastelling him, but now he was even more intently focused.”Magda had no doubt of that.Isidore smiled self-consciously. “I guess that I was trying to appeal to hisnature as a maker, trying to talk to him in a language he would understand andappreciate. It seemed to be working, as he was acutely interested in what I wastelling him.“Finally, I told him that I had come at last to understand what was needed. Itold him that I needed to have a new way to see, a way to see what no othercould, and to do that I needed to have my vision of this world removed. To see,I had to first be blinded. I said that I wanted him to do it.“Merritt was shocked and angered by my unexpected request. He refused to listento anything else I had to say. He ushered me to the door and sent me away.”Magda for the first time thought better of Merritt.“Over the course of time, I had gradually become used to the idea of trading onekind of sight for another and had accepted its necessity. I was used to theidea. But I realized that it was a shocking request to make of Merritt, so for awhile I left him alone to think about the things I had told him. I knew that heneeded time to absorb it all.“After a while, I went back to see him. I would have liked to have given himmore time to consider the situation, but I knew that time was working againstme—against all of us.“Before he could say anything or send me away, I asked him to first tell me onething. He folded his arms and looked down at me, waiting for me to pose thequestion. He’s a tall man—you are more his size than me. For a moment I hadtrouble summoning my voice under the scrutiny of his hazel eyes. I finally did,of course, and asked him to tell me why General Kuno’s forces would take thecorpses of our people. He stared down at me for a long time.“Finally he told me, in a quiet voice, that he feared to imagine. I told himthat I did as well and asked him to allow me to explain.“He at last stepped aside from his doorway and allowed me in. I again told himthat I needed to be blind. Anticipating what he might say and before he had achance, I told him that I needed to be really blind, not blindfolded, in orderto see what I needed to discover. I explained that I was searching for theanswers to real problems, and I couldn’t use pretend methods.“Merritt told me that if I wanted to be blind so bad, all I had to do was stabout my own eyes. I remember him pacing around his room, gesturing with his armsas he told me that he would be cursed with a lifetime of nightmares if he wereto do such a dreadful thing. He said that it was a cruel request for me to makeof someone.“He grew more and more angry as he paced. He finally told me again to leave andsaid that if I decided to stab my eyes out for such a crazy cause I would bedoing him a great favor if I made sure that he never learned of it.“As he held my arm and led me to his door, I told him that if he cared about allthe people who had been slaughtered, and all those I feared would beslaughtered, he needed to listen to me. I insisted that he wasn’t understandingwhat I was saying or what I was asking for.“He finally calmed down and let go of my arm. He leaned back against a tablecovered in swords all neatly laid out on a red velvet cloth. He picked out oneparticularly stunning sword from a raised place at the center and held thewire-wound hilt tightly in both fists as he rested the sword’s point firmly onthe floor. He then looked up at me and said he was listening. It was a warningthat it was my last chance.“I told him that it was not actually blindness that I sought. I was actuallyseeking vision.“When he frowned, I went on and told him that of course I could blind myself,but I could not give myself the sight I needed, so it would be pointless to doso. Even more curious, he leaned toward me a bit and asked what I meant.“I told him that being blind to this world was only half of it—the easy half. Isaid that what I really needed was a wizard with enough of an imagination andability to be able to create a new kind of vision.“I told him that I needed to be invested with a singular ability, the ability tosee what no one else could.”Magda arched an eyebrow. “I would imagine that by then, with him being a maker,you had his full attention.”“I did indeed,” Isidore confirmed. “He began to realize that I was not askinghim to blind me so much as I was asking him to take my vision so that he couldreplace it with a new kind of sight, a better kind of sight. The kind of sightthat no one had ever conceived of before.“I told him that in my mind, my vision had already been taken by the enemy. Theyhad blinded me to spirits so that I could not fight against them.“This was about getting the vision I needed so that I could fight back.“I told Merritt that I needed him to create in me the ability to be able to huntspirits in this world.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 Magda watched Isidore silently rubbing a thumb on the side of her knee for amoment, gathering her thoughts before she went on. Magda could not imagine whatit must have been like for this woman, all alone, haunted by her calling ofworking with the spirit world and by the spirits that were missing from it.Despite how thin and frail she looked, this was a woman of enormousdetermination.“I remember the last day I had normal sight,” Isidore finally said.Seeing the woman’s courage flag as her jaw trembled for just a moment, Magdaplaced a reassuring hand on Isidore’s back, but said nothing.Isidore spoke softly as she picked up the story. “After giving him the detailshe would need, all the things I knew as a spiritist that he would likely beunaware of, I’d let Merritt work on the problem. I had told him that it was inhis hands and asked him to come to me when he was ready.“He worked for weeks. Not once did I go to see him. I let him create what hewould in his own way.“Merritt hated the thought of taking my eyes, he truly did, but he understoodthat I wasn’t really asking to be blind. I was actually asking for something fargreater than the sight we are all born with.“I was asking for wizard-created sight.”Magda stared at the candle flames wavering slowing as they burned, trying toimagine such a thing, trying to imagine what she would feel like, knowing thatshe was about to be changed forever by a wizard’s power. She knew from Baraccusthat when a wizard changed a person in such a way, there could be no going back.Such changes could not be reversed.“One day a messenger delivered a note. It was from Merritt, saying that he wasready and would arrive shortly. It asked that I be ready.” Isidore took a deepbreath, letting it out with a sigh. “I remember how my heart started hammeringwhen he knocked on my door that day. My heart was pounding against my ribs and Icould hear each beat whooshing in my ears. I had to stop for a moment, hold onto the back of a chair, and make myself slow my breathing before I went to thedoor.“I had made preparations for the day when he would finally arrive. I had goneover everything countless times as I waited. The waiting had been agony, but Iknew that the last thing I wanted was to rush him. I needed him to get it right.“I remember frantically looking at everything on my way to the door, trying totake it all in, trying to remember what everything looked like. I tried toremember the shape of the pottery bowl on the table, the simple design of thechair, the grain of the wooden table.“It was a small place, but I had arranged the few pieces of furniture in it sothat once I could no longer see I would be able to get around and find thingsfairly easily. I had tried to anticipate every aspect of being blind, tried toset things out that I would need to find, move things that might trip me, readyeverything I could think of.“Still, despite my preparations, I was terrified.“I had several scarves laid out in a line on my small sleeping mat. I’d selectedthem because they were each a different color. For some reason, color seemedmore important to me, more dear to me, than anything else.“I desperately wanted to remember color.“I had tied knots in the ends of each scarf, a different number of knots foreach different color. One knot meant that it was a red scarf, two knots wasbrown, three green, and so on. I don’t really know why I thought that was soimportant, considering that it could make no difference if I couldn’t actuallysee the color, but I remember being panicked that I might forget what colorlooked like, what flowers looked like, what sunlight looked like, what a child’ssmile looked like.“I guess that those scarves with the knots in the ends were my connection to allthose things. They were my talisman to recall what color looked like . . . andso much more.”Magda felt tears running down her cheeks and dripping off her jaw. She tried toimagine eyes in the sunken hollows Isidore was left with. She must have been abeautiful woman, with big beautiful eyes looking out from a beautiful soul.“I plucked up those scarves on the way to the door. I held them in a death grip,as if I could somehow hold on to color itself.”Isidore cocked her head, as if recalling the scene. “When I opened the door, Iwas surprised to see that Merritt’s eyes were red. To this day, that, and notthe scarf with one knot, is my memory of red.“He told me in a quiet voice that he had figured out how to do what it was Iwanted. He asked if I was sure, if I still wanted to go through with it. Inanswer, I took up his hand, kissed it, and held it to my cheek for a moment as Ithanked him for what he was about to do. He nodded without saying anything.“I was joyous for the lost souls that I hoped to be able to find. Merritt wasmiserable.“He had a roll of papers he’d brought along with him. He unfurled them on thetable and I saw then that each one had some kind of drawings all over it. Hearranged them just so, putting various pieces where they belonged so thattogether they became parts of a larger drawing. When it was all arranged, Icould see that he had drawn what looked to be a complex maze with odd symbols atvarious places.”“A maze?” Magda managed to ask without the tears surfacing in her voice.Isidore nodded. “I asked him what he thought he was doing. I told him thatdrawings for a maze had nothing to do with the new kind of sight that I needed.“He straightened then—he is an imposing man—and asked what I thought I was goingto do. Walk all over the New World looking for ghosts? Look in dark corners andunder beds? He said that it wasn’t enough to be able to see such spirits as Iwas hunting. He said that I needed something more to help me find them.“He said that he had not merely thought of a way to create a new kind of sightso that I could see them, but a way that might attract them, draw them to me.“I was stunned. It was brilliant. I hadn’t thought it through, thought about howI would actually search, but Merritt had. He had considered the entirety of theproblem and he’d come up with a way for me not only to see spirits, but to drawthe dead to me.”Magda glanced around the circular room, imagining what was out beyond,remembering the way she had come in through the maze to find Isidore’s place.“You mean to say that Merritt designed this maze down here? That maze out there,that confusing place with all the dead ends, all the twists and turns, all theconfusing passageways, all the hanging cloth, and the empty rooms?”“That’s right.”“I don’t understand. How can it help you? Why the passageways to nowhere thatdead-end? The hanging panels of cloth? The empty rooms? What’s the purpose?”“To make them feel safe,” Isidore said.Magda blinked in surprise. “To make the . . . spirits feel safe?”“That’s right. The dead ends make them feel a sense of safety, feel that otherscan’t sneak up on them. The cloth gives them the comforting sense of beingshrouded. Did you notice that the cloth panels have protection spells eitherpainted on them or woven into the fabric? Most of it is very faint, but spiritscan see them, or maybe they are aware of the spells in their own way.”“I guess I hadn’t noticed,” Magda said.“Some of those spells on the hanging fabric are my own creation, born of my workas a spiritist. They’re powerful and significant.” Isidore leaned toward Magda abit. “The dead must heed them.”“And the empty rooms?”“The rooms are refuges that give the dead a sense of place. It has to be hardfor them, not knowing where they belong. The rooms are empty so that the spiritsdon’t feel like they are intruding into someone else’s place. You see, the wholemaze is a sanctuary for the spirits who find themselves trapped in this world.“That day in my room, standing over the papers, Merritt said that he knew theright place to build such a sanctuary. He said that it would be down in thelower reaches of the Keep, below the crypts, where there were countless deadlaid to rest. The crypts, he said, were a place of such specific energy thatspirits trapped in this world would already tend to haunt that area. He saidthat the refuge he would build below would then draw them in to me.“He said, then, that he would personally oversee the construction.” Isidoreswallowed. “I knew what he meant. He meant that it was time for him to firsttake my sight.”“I don’t see how you could allow a wizard to alter you in such a way,” Magdasaid, unable to contain her emotion any longer.“Sometimes, it is necessary to step beyond what you have known and to reach forsomething more.”Magda had intended not to bring her own views into the conversation—after all,what was done was done—but she couldn’t help herself. “I’m sorry, Isidore, but Ican’t see how you could allow it. How could you stand to give up so much? Howcould you allow a wizard to alter you from the way you were born?”Isidore smiled then. “It’s not that way at all, Magda. You were born unable tospeak a language. Without people changing you from that natural, unalteredstate, you would to this day not understand the spoken word, or be able tocommunicate.”“That’s different,” Magda said. “A person is born with that potential.”“A person is born with the potential to change, to learn, to grow. It’s notalways an easy step to take. You were changed by being taught to read and write.Reading and writing aren’t natural abilities. They were instilled in you. Aren’tyou happy that people cared enough to change you so that you would be betterthan you were born and thus have a better life? Aren’t you better for it? Didn’tthe struggle make you stronger?”Magda swiped back her short hair. “But Isidore, he took your sight. How couldyou stand to lose—”“No,” Isidore said, holding up a finger to cut Magda off. “It’s not that way atall. Yes, I lost something, but I gained something truly remarkable. I gainedfar more than I lost. Do you know that I’ve never again bothered to hold thosescarves with the knots?”“Why not?”“Because I don’t need them. That memory is the past. I can see so much morenow.”Magda frowned. “What do you mean? See what?”Isidore lifted an arm, slowly sweeping it around the room. “Well, I can see . ..”The cat hissed as she suddenly jumped to her feet and rose up onto her toes.Isidore’s arm halted in place.The cat arched her back high. Her black hair stood on end as her mouth openedwide. Her muzzle drew back, exposing her teeth as she hissed.Magda blinked at the cat. “Shadow . . . what’s the matter with you?”“You should run,” Isidore whispered.Magda looked up. “What?”“Run.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 Magda sprang to her feet, following Isidore up. Shadow’s black fur stood outstraight, making her look bigger than she really was. Her tail puffed out totwice as fat as normal. Hissing with her fangs bared, she looked ferocious.Isidore swept her arm out, pushing Magda behind her. “It’s too late to run. It’sin the hallway.”Magda thought that her own hair might stand on end along with the cat’s.“What’s in the hall?”A gust of wind swept in low along the floor and then up through the room,swirling around the wall, extinguishing all the candles. The air turned icy, asif someone had opened the door into the dead of winter.The cat growled in a way that Magda had never before heard a cat growl. It was aferocious, feral sound.The frigid, whirling breeze died away, leaving the room to settle into murkystillness. Fortunately, the shield door on Magda’s lantern had been closed. Theflame hadn’t been blown out by the strange gust of wind, so it was stillproviding some light. But sitting off to the side as it was, and with the shielddoor closed, it wasn’t much help at lighting the uncomfortably dark room.Magda squinted, trying her best to see in the dim light, looking for any sign ofmovement, something out of place, something that didn’t belong. She didn’t seeanything that would have Isidore and the cat in such a state of alarm, but itwas so difficult to see in the near darkness that she couldn’t be sure therewasn’t something she might be missing.Using an outstretched arm, Isidore began backing Magda through the room,following the curve of the circular wall. The blind woman was obviously able totell quite well where she was in the darkness. Now it was Magda who was at thedisadvantage.Magda pulled her knife. With her other hand she clutched Isidore’s arm so if shehad to she could pull the spiritist back out of harm’s way. Even though Magdaknew how to use the weapon to defend herself, with the unseen nature of thethreat the knife offered less comfort than she would have hoped.Not seeing anything, Magda leaned close and whispered, “Maybe we should go intothe back room.”Isidore had both arms out, crouched a bit, as if she, too, was readying herselfto fight the invisible opponent.“No,” Isidore said. “If we go back there we’ll be even farther from the way out.We would be trapped.”“Trapped by what?” Magda asked, holding her knife out as she scanned the room toboth sides. “I don’t see anything.”Isidore came to a slow, fluid stop as she crossed her lips with a finger, urgingsilence.Slowly, quietly, each step taken with care, Isidore began ushering Magda closerto the side of the room, all the while facing the entrance.For the first time, Magda heard something coming from the entry hall. Thestrange sound sent goose bumps tingling up her arms. It sounded like fingernailsdragging along stone.The cat, facing the black maw of the entrance hall, hissed and growled evenlouder. Magda didn’t know if Shadow intended on making an escape or attackingwhatever it was that she and Isidore had first sensed in the entry.With a sudden roar that made Magda gasp, a dark shape burst out of the blacknessof the hall and into the room. In the dim light, Magda could see that it was aman. As Magda brought her knife up, Isidore ignited a bolt of power between herpalms that lit the room in blinding flash of light.In that flash, Magda saw that the man didn’t look the way she had expected. Thefolds of skin on his face seemed dry and stretched. It was difficult to seeclearly in the crackling flashes of light, so she couldn’t be sure exactly whatshe had seen. His scraps of clothes were dark and clung tightly, as if stuck tohim.Isidore flicked her hands, casting the sizzling point of light toward theintruder. The cat screeched and sprang for his face.A dark arm caught the cat in midair and flung it aside. At the same time thebolt of power that Isidore sent flying at the man seemed to glance uselessly offthe dark figure as he advanced through the room. Stone shattered where theflickering light of Isidore’s power hit the wall, sending shards flying and dustboiling up.Isidore didn’t waste any time. Another bolt of powerful light ignited. Thistime, Magda had to turn her face away from the searing heat that slammed intothe advancing figure. The shimmering heat turned to white vapor as he pushedthrough it without slowing.“Try to get around him and run,” Isidore said.“I’m not leaving without you,” Magda told her as she tried to think of a waythey could get past the hulking man.“Forget about me—I am already lost!” Isidore yelled as she pushed Magda back.“You’re not lost!” Magda regained her footing and seized Isidore’s arm. “We bothhave to get out of here!”“We can’t both get away.”“Yes we can. Hold my arm. When I cut him that will give us an opening. Stay withme.”“You will only have one chance,” Isidore said, ignoring Magda’s command andshaking her arm free. “When that chance comes, take it! Don’t lose your life inhere, Magda. You have to get away! You are more important than I am.”Magda had no intention of leaving a blind woman to her fate with whoever, orwhatever, was in the room with them. She grabbed Isidore’s arm again and yankedher back just in time from what the woman couldn’t see. A powerful arm sweptpast them both.Magda used the opening to duck under Isidore’s outstretched arm and to slam herknife up into the ribs just under the man’s extended arm as it swung past them.It was a solid strike. She pulled back in time to miss the elbow that cockedback, trying to get her. The arm swept around again, inches from her face. Shetried to slash the arm but missed. Magda saw that the fingers were likeshriveled, blackened claws.Isidore pushed both hands out, using all her strength to send a concentrated,focused fist of air at the center of the figure. It bent him only a little. Hestaggered back a half step but then kept coming forward again as Magda andIsidore kept circling away from him.The cat leaped out of nowhere up onto the man’s back. He twisted and threw itoff. The cat hit the wall hard.With an angry roar and sudden, ferocious speed, the man lunged toward them.Magda snatched for the blind woman’s arm to yank her back out of the way, butshe caught only air as Isidore leaned in and again tried to force a focused wallof air at the attacker.Magda felt as if she were moving in a dream. Even with all her strength put intothe effort, her legs wouldn’t move fast enough to get her within range to stabthe man, to stop what she knew he was about to do.Lashing out with lightning speed, his clawed hand raked through Isidore’smiddle. Isidore’s scream turned to a grunt with the impact of the blow.An arc of warm blood and flesh splattered across Magda and then in a diagonalline up across the wall.Isidore’s legs began to buckle.“Run! Now!” she cried out at Magda as she was going down.Magda instead rammed her knife into the side of the man’s neck. She had to stophim before he did any more damage. All she could think was that she had to stophim and then get help for Isidore.Driving the knife in deep didn’t feel like stabbing into muscle and sinew. Itfelt hard and leathery and dead. She tried to yank the knife back so that shecould stab him again, but it was stuck fast.She gripped the handle with both hands, trying to pull the blade back out of hisneck. It was then, when she was close enough, that she saw in the dim light thatthe man, though he moved with impossible speed and power, didn’t look like aman.He looked like a corpse.His face was sunken and partially decayed. His jaw hung crooked to one side; hisdark teeth were exposed behind shrunken, shriveled lips. He looked like arotting cadaver.But even as dead as the rest of him appeared, his eyes were something altogetherdifferent. The look in his eyes sent an icy chill through her.It wasn’t just that they glowed with a kind of inner light. It was that the glowwas fired by the gift, yet unlike any light of the gift she had ever seenbefore. It was at once dead and empty, but alive with menace.Magda was so shocked by what she saw that it stopped her cold for an instant.Then, that frozen instant shattered with a crack that made her ears ring. Theroom suddenly spun in her vision. Her back smacked the wall, driving the airfrom her lungs. Her head hit the stone so hard that it knocked her senseless.Through the pall of pain she only dimly heard the terrible roar of the thing,only dimly saw blurry movement in the swirling room.Magda could taste dry stone dust and blood. She realized then that the man hadstruck her with a blow so powerful it had lifted her from her feet and thrownher back across the room.She was distantly surprised to realize that she still had her knife grippedtightly in her fist. Isidore’s warm blood ran down Magda’s arm and over herhand, making for a slippery hold on her knife.Magda blinked, trying to clear her vision as she struggled to get her breathback. Looking up from the floor, she saw the man in a wild fury ripping intoIsidore. He tore off the side of Isidore’s face and top of her skull with onepowerful blow, the rest of her head with the next.The dark figure roared as he flailed and ripped at Isidore’s body. Blood andgore from the poor woman splattered across the floor and up against the walls ashe swung both arms in mad fury.In a strange pall of quiet shock, Magda told herself that it was too late to doanything but escape. If she didn’t get away, she would be next.As the man bellowed in a wild frenzy of savagery, she told herself that therewas nothing she could do for Isidore. This was her only chance to get away. Sheknew that she had only a few fleeting seconds if she was to live.She told herself to move.Magda scrambled to her feet and staggered toward the black entrance to thehallway out. She snatched up her lantern on the way past.Once into the hall, she looked back over her shoulder as she ran. She was stillstunned from the blow, and her wobbly legs wouldn’t move fast enough. She couldsee the man back through the entrance, finished ripping Isidore apart, turntoward her.A cry of anguish for Isidore caught in Magda’s throat as she struggled to run.The cat appeared out of the dark doorway and raced after her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 In a daze, Magda stumbled as she ran. Tears streamed down her face. Blooddripped from her fist holding the knife. Glancing down at her arms, she thoughtit looked as if she had just butchered someone.As she ran, she struggled to comprehend what she had just seen. She knew thatsomething only remotely human, or maybe only once human, had just slaughteredIsidore. It made no sense.It was such a horrific sight, such a shock, that she was already questioning ifshe had really seen what she knew she had seen when she had looked into theman’s face. She began to wonder if it could have been a trick of the shadows.But she knew it wasn’t.She cried out in fright when she suddenly ran into one of the walls of hangingcloth. It caught her, flapping around her like arms grabbing for her. Sheslashed wildly with her knife, frantically trying to get away from what shethought for a second was the man who had killed Isidore trying to seize her.She shoved the cloth aside and started running. She could only see a shortdistance ahead into the empty maze of halls.She looked down as she ran, fumbling with the lantern door, trying to get itopen so that she could see better. It finally sprang open, casting a bit ofuseful light into the passageway.She realized that, lost in the maze as she was, she would soon be the nextvictim of the thing that had killed Isidore. It was coming for her. If she waswandering around aimlessly it would likely be able to catch her in short order.Magda thrust a hand into her pocket, frantically searching for the map thatTilly had given her. She dug around with trembling fingers but couldn’t find themap. She didn’t know if she’d dropped it as she was running, or if she’d lost itin the fight. All she knew for sure was that the map wasn’t in her pocket.She turned back the way she had come, holding the lantern up, trying to see ifshe had dropped the map when she had fought her way out of the embrace of thehanging cloth. She didn’t see it on the ground anywhere.She heard a sound. She thought she saw a dark shape move back in the directionshe’d come from.Then she saw the glow of his eyes off in the darkness, like some goblin from herchildhood nightmares come to life.Magda abandoned the search for the map and started running. She knew that it wasfoolish to run in a maze without knowing where she was going, but she was toopanicked to stop herself.Besides, what choice did she have?She ran with wild abandon, taking random passageways at intersections. From timeto time she could hear the dead man in the distance behind her. He let out agrowl of rage as he came, his feet sometimes dragging on the floor. Magda ranall the faster, imagining the goblin from her nightmares hot on her heels. Sheknew that she didn’t stand a chance fighting against him. She had to get away.She was suddenly brought up short in a dead end. She spun around and saw the manstep into the passageway from a side hall, blocking her way back. Magda stoodpanting, knife clenched tightly in her fist, trying to decide what to do.His glowing eyes watched her, and then he started toward her. As he got closer,the cat sprang out of the darkness onto the man’s head, clawing at his gleamingeyes with wild fury. He twisted to the side, his arms thrashing, trying to swipethe cat off his head.Magda knew that it was her only chance. She didn’t hesitate. She ran toward theman and the only way out. As she reached him, she bent low and slammed hershoulder into his ribs, knocking him to the side. He lost his balance and fellagainst the wall.Pain shot through her shoulder from the solid impact with his rocklike torso.Magda was already past him and running at full speed as the cat sprang off theman and raced after her.Magda took intersection after intersection, ducking around heavy panels ofhanging cloth whenever they appeared unexpectedly out of the darkness. Shedidn’t know where she was or how to escape the maze. She was simply trying tolose the man close on her heels. The man who had killed Isidore.Charging down a long hallway, she suddenly came upon another hanging cloth thatloomed up out of the darkness. Magda pushed it to the side with an arm as shewent around it. When she did so, she realized that it was different from theothers she had encountered. Unlike the others, this one was light and airy.Almost immediately, before she could wonder at the silken nature of the cloth,she saw in the weak lantern light that it was a dead end. She couldn’t go anyfarther.Magda spun around. The man had already reached the other side of the cloth wallblocking the passageway. It was too late to go back the way she had come.The man slowed. He had her trapped in a dead end.Magda stood frozen in panic, gulping air. She could see the reddish glow of hiseyes through the gauzy cloth.She had nowhere to run."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 Magda could see his boots just on the other side of the hanging cloth. Her backwas to the wall at the dead end of the corridor. The delicate cloth hungperfectly still, not three paces away from her.She tried to think what to do, how she could get away. She thought that maybe,if he came around one side, she could dash out the other side at the same timeand run.But where? She didn’t have the map. She realized, then, that even if she had themap it likely wouldn’t do her much good. There was really no way to run and readthe map at the same time. It had been hard enough to decipher when she had beenable to stand still, study it, and count intersections.The truth was she was lost in the maze. A maze designed to attract the spiritsof the dead. Magda didn’t think that this man, or creature, or whatever it was,had been what Isidore had been trying to attract, but in dealing with darkforces perhaps she had inadvertently gotten the attention of things she hadn’tintended to attract.An arm thrust around the cloth, clawing at the air, as if trying to feel aroundto find her, hoping to snag flesh.Magda pressed her back against the wall behind, trying to stay as far away fromthe sweep of the clawed hand as possible. The cloth was sheer enough that hadthere been light beyond in the tunnel she would probably have been able to seethe man through it. With her lantern, she thought that he could probably seeher. She turned the lantern window aside, hoping not to illuminate herself forhim.She leaned to the side away from the arm reaching blindly for her and carefullypeered through the small gap between the wall and the other end of the cloth.The hall wasn’t as wide as some. She could see that if she went for the gapopposite the man he would likely be able to reach over and grab her.Again he swung the arm, groping into the dead end, trying to catch her up. Shewas far enough away from where he was standing, though, that he couldn’t reachher.But as soon as he came around the flimsy, hanging cloth, he would be able tosnatch her unless she could somehow get past him as he came for her. She wasfast, but from what she had seen back in Isidore’s place, he was faster. Makingit worse, the hall wasn’t very wide. There was no maneuvering room.Magda wondered how long it would be until he came around and had her. She keptimagining being ripped open the way he had ripped open Isidore. She knew thatthe end was going to come at any moment.But instead, he moved to the other side of the cloth, reaching around with hisother hand, clawing the air on that side. He didn’t even lean over and lookaround, probably because his glowing eyes could see her on the other side of thecloth. She could see those eyes clearly enough, and they only added to herterror.Even as she gasped for air, trying to get her breath as she struggled to figureout what to do, Magda frowned. Why didn’t he simply come around the cloth to gether? It was obvious that he knew she was back there.He roared in frustration, slashing wildly, blindly, around the side of thecloth. He raced over to the other side, trying again to reach back and snag her.But he wasn’t leaning in far enough to get to her. She couldn’t imagine why not.It seemed like the silky cloth was somehow keeping him back.Magda wondered . . . could it be?She remembered Isidore saying that some of the spells on the hanging fabric wereher own creation. Isidore knew more about the underworld and the dead than mostpeople.Magda held the lantern up. She could see then, through the diaphanous cloth,besides his glowing eyes, that there were symbols all over the other side. Theywere drawn rather crudely with what looked to be a thin wash of paint thatwrinkled the fabric. Magda could see that they were definitely spell-forms. Shetried to picture in her mind what they would look like if she were on the otherside and wasn’t looking at them backward.She had frequently seen Baraccus draw spells. She tried to think if sherecognized these drawn spells. They were unusual; they didn’t look like anythingshe had ever seen Baraccus draw.The man lunged, reaching around the side, grasping empty air with his clawedfingers. Magda ducked in and jabbed at the filmy cloth, pushing it toward him.He stepped back with a surprised, angry growl, then raced to the other side totry again to reach around and get her while she was close.Magda remembered Isidore saying that the spells she had drawn were born of herwork as a spiritist, and that they were both powerful and significant.Magda remembered Isidore saying The dead must heed them.The man on the other side hadn’t yet tried to come past the cloth but he showedno signs of giving up. She knew that he would not leave until he had her. Ifanything, he was getting ever more frantic to reach her.There was no telling when or if someone, someone like a wizard, would be comingdown to the maze to see Isidore. But even if someone did come to visit thespiritist, it was possible that they wouldn’t come this way. The maze was asprawling complex. For all Magda knew, she could be far off the regular routein. Even if someone did come to see Isidore, they might never come this way andhappen across Magda.Worse, even if someone did come this way they very likely would be killed justas swiftly as Isidore had been murdered. Isidore had used powerful magic and ithadn’t saved her.Magda could be stuck down in the deserted tunnels forever, with the crazedkiller ready to strike at any moment. For all she knew it was possible that hisfear of the symbols on the cloth might only be a stopgap measure that wouldn’thold him back for long. Once he got past that thin piece of cloth, it would be ahorrific, painful death.Magda realized that if she was going to escape certain death, she was going tohave to get away on her own.She had an idea. An idea she didn’t like one bit.With her heart pounding nearly out of control, she clutched the knife tighter inher fist.She didn’t see that she had a choice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 As the man beyond the hanging cloth moved from one side to the other, when hewas about in the middle, Magda shoved the cloth toward him as hard as she could.Through the cloth, she could feel his body on the other side. His middle didn’tfeel at all soft like a living person’s. It felt more like a tree trunk.He roared at the contact with the thin cloth and stepped back. Recoveringquickly, he lunged to one side, his arm coming around, trying to grab her as shewas still pushing at the cloth. His clawed hand caught a few strands of hershort hair. Magda jerked her head away before he could get a better grasp.As he reached, sweeping the air, trying for more of her hair, Magda used all herstrength to stab the blade deep into his hand. The blade pierced through hispalm, coming out the back of his hand. He didn’t cry out in pain, but insteadyanked the hand back, pulling it off the blade to free it. He shoved the handback toward her, sure that she was close and he would get her when she stabbedat him again.Magda used the opening as he was occupied in reaching for her, thinking he hadher, to race to the other side of the fabric panel. Without pause, she shotaround the cloth. His dark shape turned abruptly when he saw her dash past him.Magda sprinted at full speed down the corridor, too frightened to look back. Butshe didn’t need to look back. She could hear him coming. As hard has she ran,she could hear him getting ever closer. He was as tireless as he was powerful.Magda ducked around another hanging and took a turn to the right, then at thenext intersection another right, then a left, in her mind marking the turns shetook. The heavy hangings she encountered along the way didn’t seem to troublehim the way the wispy one at the dead end had. He kept coming.Even holding the lantern out as she ran, she still couldn’t see very far ahead.She feared that she would run into another dead end, but one without theprotective cloth, and then he would have her trapped.As intersections appeared she took them at random and without hesitation, butstill took note of each turn in case she came to a dead end and had to retraceher steps. As fast as she was running, and the way he was getting closer all thetime, she knew that if she came upon another dead end, it would likely be theend of her. Even so, she knew that she couldn’t afford to slow for anything.Despite her fear, despite how hard she ran to escape, she couldn’t keep thehorrific memories of Isidore being slaughtered out of her mind. She knew thatshe had to think, but the thought of such a fate also happening to her wasfilling her mind. She could only imagine the pain and the terror of such adeath. The only mercy was that it had been swift.Magda looked up when she heard the cat yowl. The cat, a bit out ahead, turnedback toward her. When Magda met the cat’s gaze, the cat took a side passagewayand started running.The thought occurred to Magda that the cat had found the way in to Isidore’sroom on its own.Magda wondered if maybe Shadow could find her way out as well.She didn’t know what else to do and she had no better idea, so she startedchasing after Shadow, taking every turn the cat took. With her tail high in theair, the tip hooked forward, Shadow raced through the halls.Magda glanced back over her shoulder and saw the glowing eyes. He had gained onher and was only two or three strides behind. She would have screamed, but sheknew that if she did it would slow her just enough for him to grab her. Insteadof screaming, she focused all her effort on running as hard as she could, tryingto keep up with the dark streak of the cat.The cat cut to the right at an intersection, but then abruptly stopped andlooked off into the dark. It reversed direction and took to the left instead.Magda hesitated for just an instant, not knowing if she should keep up hermomentum to stay out of the reach of the man, or follow Shadow. She chose tofollow the cat rather than risk losing her only guide out and again beingtrapped in a dead end.That instant was all the man needed. His arms circled around her middle.Magda spun around before he completely closed his arms around her. She struckhard, slashing the knife across his throat. She saw bits of dried flesh fly offfrom the deep gash, but no blood. The wound didn’t slow the man.She slammed the knife into his chest, fist deep, over and over, then dipped herhead under his arm when he tried to hook it around her neck.As Magda slipped through his grasp, she spun around to the side of him. Hard asshe could, she kicked the back of his knee. His leg buckled and he started tofall but staggered back and caught his balance before he fell.Even though he stayed on his feet, it was just long enough for Magda to boltaway, out of his reach. Bellowing a deep growl that echoed through the halls, hecharged after her.As she ran after the cat, trying to keep it within the limited range of thelantern light, Magda couldn’t see well enough and took a turn in the corridortoo wide. The man took the inside, shorter line around the corner.In that instant, he darted ahead of her, blocking her route. The cat stopped andlooked back at her. The dark silhouette between them waited to see what shewould do, where she would run.Back beyond the man standing in the center of the corridor blocking her way,back beyond the cat, Magda saw light. She realized that they were at theentrance of the maze.Despite the welcome light beyond the man that offered the way out, Magdacouldn’t get to it. The man started stalking toward her. Magda didn’t want torun back into the dark passageways. She was close to being out of the maze, butwith his feet spread and his arms out to the sides, she knew that there would beno getting by him this time.As she started backing up to keep some space between her and the man, Magdathought she heard people in the distance yelling. She yelled back to them.Hearing her yell for help, the man started to run toward her. Just then,something dark swooped in, hitting the back of his head. Magda could see the catin the distance, waiting for her, so she knew it wasn’t the cat.When she heard the loud cry, she realized that it was a bird. She saw broad,inky wings fluttering and realized that it was a raven.It must have been one of the birds she had seen earlier that had come in one ofthe high windows in the large chamber and gotten itself trapped down inside theKeep’s vast network of halls. She knew that it was a relatively commonoccurrence and that when they became desperate they sometimes panicked.The raven let out a piercing cry as it attacked the man’s head. He swiped at it,trying to fight it off. The raven withdrew every time he swung, avoiding hisarms, only to dive in again and renew the attack.The man stumbled to the side, careening into the wall as he tried to get thebird away from him.When Magda saw her opening she didn’t hesitate. She raced past him, toward thelight. She no longer needed the cat to show her the way. She simply followed thedistant glow of light.Coming around a corner Magda abruptly encountered a small cluster of men. Somehad torches while others had spheres that cast a greenish light. She recognizedthe gift in their eyes.“What is it?” one of the men asked. “What’s happened?”Magda pointed back. “A man—a dead man. He murdered Isidore. He came in andkilled her.”The wizard leaned in and frowned. “A dead man?”Magda swiped sweaty stray strands of hair back out of her eyes. “I don’t know. Idon’t know what he was or who he was. But he looked dead and he wasn’t stoppedby her magic.” She lifted the bloody knife. “And he wasn’t stopped by this. Istabbed him a dozen times at least. It didn’t even slow him down.”The men shared looks before peering off down the dark passageways. She thoughtthey would question her, or argue with her. They didn’t.The raven suddenly burst out of the darkness and flew past them, back toward thelighted corridors.“Those birds are always getting lost down here,” one of the men grumbled.“Come on,” the first man said to the others.As afraid as she was, Magda followed after the men, expecting that at any momentthey would encounter the dead man. Despite the men being wizards, she wasn’tentirely confident that they grasped the true danger of the threat. She wasn’tentirely sure, despite their numbers, that they could handle the man who hadkilled Isidore.Some of men broke away from the main group to take different routes through themaze to search for the intruder. She followed not far behind the man she took tobe the one in charge, the one who had spoken to her at first, until they made itall the way back to the sight of Isidore’s slaughter. In the light of torchesand the light spheres it was, if anything, an even more horrific sight than sheremembered.The men didn’t waste any time once they saw that the spiritist was well beyondany help. In grim silence, they quickly searched her quarters before they beganretracing their steps through the maze. Along the way they looked in every roomand behind every cloth hanging over the entrances to side halls. It was not hardto see how angry the men were as they searched for the one responsible for sucha crime.Eventually they found themselves almost back at the entrance without comingacross any sign of the man who had killed Isidore. Guards at the entrance toldthem that no one had tried to come through. The man in charge told the othersthat they would keep searching until they found the killer.As they again made their way off into the dark maze to continue the search,Magda paused. She stood alone after the men had gone, listening to the hiss ofher lantern as she considered what she should do. Considering what she dared todo.She remembered the route at the end when she was being chased. She had countedthe turns. She knew the way back. At least back far enough.She knew what she had to do.Magda scooped up the cat and started back into the darkness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41 Magda stood when the six men filed into the quiet room. A row of small, highwindows let in glowing streamers of early sunlight that cut diagonally acrossthe gloomy space.Elder Cadell gestured without looking up at her before pulling out his owntall-backed chair. “Please, have a seat.”Magda did as he asked, sitting in the single, simple, and rather uncomfortablewooden chair set before a highly polished mahogany table in the council’sprivate chambers. Though her chair was simple, the six chairs on the other sidewith Elder Cadell and Councilmen Sadler, Clay, Hambrook, Weston, and Guymer werequite elaborate, as were the three walls of floor-to-ceiling bookcases packedtightly with faded leather-bound volumes.The furniture was intended to emphasize to people the difference in statusbetween any of the council and those coming before them. Magda suspected thatthey had sent word that they would like to see her privately, before they beganthe day’s session, so as to avoid a repeat of anything like the last time.A steady stream of people had sought Magda out since that day in the councilsession, asking her to help them with swearing the oath to Lord Rahl in order toprotect themselves against the dream walkers. She had met with hundreds ofpeople who had heard about what she said before the council that day and whowere afraid of the dream walkers. With good reason.While the council had not forbidden such an oath—after all, D’Hara was part ofthe New World and on the same side in the war—they privately chafed at peoplegiving a devotion to Lord Rahl. Their official position was that while dreamwalkers were indeed real and presented a danger, the enemy was not yet advancedenough to put such a weapon into use, so while the threat was genuine, it wasdistant in the future.Other than the attack against herself, Magda could provide no proof otherwise.But many people didn’t want to take the chance and learn too late that thecouncil was wrong.“I had been expecting to see you sooner,” Magda said when they were all seated.“The war grows more desperate by the day,” Elder Cadell said without looking upas he lifted one paper after another from the table before him, glancing overeach briefly before setting it aside and going on to the next. “We have beentrying to keep from losing the effort.”Councilman Sadler only briefly glanced her way between selecting specific papersfrom his own stack and handing them to the elder. Some of the other men were notinterested in the papers. They were glaring at her.“Of course,” Magda said, dipping her head respectfully. With the eldercontinuing to look through papers, and several of the others staring at her, shefelt compelled to say something. “Have you found the . . . person responsiblefor Isidore’s murder?”Elder Cadell looked up from under bushy brows. “Some people seem to think thatyou are responsible.”“Me?” Magda felt her face flush. “And have these people managed to explain how Icould rip a person apart like that with my bare hands?”The elder grunted before returning his attention to a paper that Sadler handedto him.“That’s true,” Councilman Clay said. “She isn’t gifted, after all.”“She had a knife,” Councilman Guymer reminded him. “A bloody knife.”“Isidore’s skull was torn in half,” Magda said. “An axe could do such damage,but not a mere knife, especially not one wielded by me.”“I didn’t say that we believed you are responsible,” Elder Cadell intoned. Helooked up and lifted an eyebrow. “I said some people think you are.”Magda didn’t know what he was getting at.“People often believe a lot of things that aren’t true,” she said. “I wish I hada way to reveal the truth for you, but I don’t.”“The spiritist was doing valuable work for the war effort,” Guymer said. “Andnow, while you were alone with her, we lost her rare talents.”Magda came up out of her chair. “If you are suggesting—”“What were you doing down there?” Councilman Sadler asked in a quiet voice meantto override Guymer’s accusation. “What business did you have with a spiritist?”Magda sank back down into her chair. “What do you think I was doing seeing aspiritist?”Sadler shrugged. “You tell me.”“I had what business anyone going to see a spiritist would have. I wanted tocontact the spirits.”Councilman Weston lifted an eyebrow. “Contact spirits? For what purpose?”“I miss my husband,” Magda said. “What other purpose would there be to see aspiritist? I wanted to know that he is safe in the arms of the good spirits, toknow that he is at peace. Perhaps none of you miss Baraccus, or worry and prayfor his soul, but I do.”Looking rather uncomfortable for the first time, some of the men leaned back.“You are not the only one who misses him,” Sadler said.Magda thought that he sounded sincere.“And was the spiritist able to help you?” Weston asked. “Did you find out whatyou needed in order to put your mind at ease about Baraccus?”“No. She was killed before . . .” Magda turned away and swallowed at theterrible memory. She cleared her throat and looked back to the men watching her.“So, has the murderer been found?” she asked.Elder Cadell swished a hand back and forth just above the table, as if he wishedhe could brush the problem away. “The lower reaches of the Keep have beensearched extensively. Nothing has been found. There is no trace of the killer.”Magda looked from one face to the next. “But how is that possible? How could hehave gotten away?”“This dead man?” Guymer asked in a mocking tone. “The one you say killed ourspiritist?”“I reported what I saw,” Magda said. “Are you suggesting that I lied?”“No,” Guymer said with a smirk, “only that in the heat of panic you may haveimagined him to be more fearsome than he actually was, imagined that a killerwould have had to be a monster. Your description was hardly useful. How wouldanyone searching know what he really looked like so as to know who to look for?”Magda returned the glare in kind. “I told you what I saw.”Councilman Clay leaned forward. “And what you say you saw was not of any help inidentifying the person responsible so that we could find him, now was it? Therehave been several such murders in the lower Keep. You are the only one who hasactually seen the killer. Or, should I say, you are the only one who hassurvived the encounter.”“It was an invaluable opportunity to help us catch the killer,” Guymer said. “Weneed to stop him before he kills again. But because you didn’t keep your headand imagined a monster, we have lost the chance to identify the attacker andcapture him. Because of your emotional reaction, we still have a killer loose inthe Keep and we don’t know his identity, much less what he looks like. He isundoubtedly a traitor or an infiltrator sent to kill important people. We mighthave had him if you could have kept your wits about you so that you could tellus what he looked like. Because you couldn’t do that simple thing, we missed ourchance and as a result we don’t have a clue who it could be.”“We are left to wonder why,” Clay added.“She can’t be faulted for being afraid,” Sadler said.Magda sat quietly, refusing to allow herself to rise to the bait. There weremore important things at stake than proving herself to these men. It was notonly the lives of the people in the Keep that were at stake, but all the peopleof the New World. She didn’t know why the council had summoned her, but itwasn’t to get at the truth. There was no point in defending herself when theyhad already decided that it was more convenient to blame her than listen to her.They didn’t want the truth; she did.Elder Cadell waved his hand again. “That’s not why we called you here, Magda. Wecalled you in because Councilman Weston had a valuable suggestion.”“And what would that be?” she asked without looking over at Weston’s smugexpression.“That we appoint you as a representative of the council for the people inoutlying lands. It’s an important post. We value your experience with suchdistant lands. You would be our contact with these remote peoples of theMidlands, as you often were on an informal basis in the past. As CouncilmanWeston pointed out, there is simply no one better suited to the post.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42 Magda frowned as she looked from one grim face to the next. “You want to appointme to a post to advise you on the peoples of the smaller lands?”“No, not advise us.” Weston leaned an elbow on the polished table. “You wouldtravel to these far-flung lands and represent the views and decrees of thecouncil to the peoples who inhabit those distant places. They are, after all,part of the Midlands. They need to know what is happening here at the Keep, whatis being decided. They need to know about the war and such.”“After all,” Sadler added, “should we lose this war, they, too, would fall underthe merciless rule of Emperor Sulachan. You know as well as we do that if theywin this struggle they will slaughter any who possess magic. The forces of theOld World are ruthless in their objective to wipe magic from the world.“You would be the council’s roving ambassador, filling people in on what we’redoing in our effort to protect them from such a threat. Imparting suchinformation, you would be helping to keep them safe. At the same time, you couldalso solicit their help with anything they might be able to contribute.”Despite Sadler’s enthusiasm for the idea, Magda saw through the proposal. Theywanted to get rid of her, or some of them did, anyway. The widow of the FirstWizard was becoming an ever larger, ever sharper thorn in their side. They weretrying to make the cause sound noble so that she would happily accept, or atleast wouldn’t be able to refuse.“I am honored that you think highly enough of my abilities to suggest such apost,” Magda said without committing to it. “You flatter me with yourconfidence, Councilman Weston.”Though the smile spread on his lips, it didn’t make it to his eyes.“There is also the matter of appointing a new First Wizard,” Elder Cadell said.“We need a First Wizard to lead us in our fight. Our very survival is at stake.Things are not going well. We dare not delay any longer in finding someone toreplace Baraccus as First Wizard. We have large numbers of the gifted coming tothe Keep to help. They need a First Wizard to direct them in how best to work todefend the New World. These new arrivals need quarters, as will the new FirstWizard.“I don’t mean to sound callous, but if you were to become our representative youwould be traveling, and wouldn’t need the space. So, a side benefit of youtaking up such a mission would be that the quarters belonging to the FirstWizard would once again be free. We don’t want to push you from your home, butthe new First Wizard will need a place to work and meet with his wizards, asBaraccus did.”Magda bowed her head. “I understand, Elder. No need to feel you are pushing mefrom my home. My home, the home I have come to love, is the Keep and the city ofAydindril. It is the people here I have come to love, not the walls. I will ofcourse vacate the First Wizard’s quarters. You are right that the new man willneed the apartments.”The elder brightened with a brief, relieved smile. For some reason it appearedthat he thought it would have been more difficult. The council seemed to haveformed an opinion of her that was based to some extent on accusations about her.“Thank you for understanding, Magda. So you will take the appointment, then?”Magda had no intention of taking such an appointment and leaving the Keep. Therewas something going on, something that threatened the Keep, threatened theirvery existence. She seemed to be the only one who understood that the threat wasreal. She was not going to abandon her search for answers just to make lifeconvenient for the council.That search for answers was a mission that Baraccus himself had given her, bothas her husband and as First Wizard.At the same time, she didn’t want to get into a battle with these men. Thatwould only back them into a corner and make her search for answers all the moredifficult.“I appreciate the generous offer, Elder Cadell. I will certainly give it my mostearnest consideration. But in the meantime, I would like to give over the FirstWizard’s apartments. I have modest needs and will have no trouble finding aplace. I know that there is space under the southern ramparts.”The elder blinked. He was left momentarily speechless. The quarters under thesouthern ramparts were the least desirable in the Keep, so there was always roomthere. As much trouble as she was to them, even the council would think thatsuch quarters were beneath the widow of the First Wizard. It reflected poorly onthem that they would force her out of her apartments to live beneath thesouthern ramparts.Magda didn’t really care where she slept. She was only concerned with findinganswers before they were all killed the way she was nearly killed by a dreamwalker, or as Isidore had been killed by that walking nightmare.Before Elder Cadell could say anything, she asked, “Have you selected the man tobecome First Wizard, then?”Sadler leaned back in his chair. Hambrook and Clay shared a look. Weston andGuymer showed no reaction to the question.Elder Cadell cleared his throat. “We have had discussions and have someone inmind.” He smoothed his bushy brow. “We will reveal our choice at the proper timeand in the proper manner.”In other words, he wasn’t about to tell Magda what they had decided. She hopedit was one of the men Baraccus had worked closely with. There were good menamong them.“Of course, Elder Cadell. I am sure that the council will choose wisely. Theycertainly did the last time.”With the war going badly, they needed someone strong. Someone like Baraccus.Once the man was selected, she had important information to convey to him.He would need to know what she knew, what she had dared tell no one.It seemed to her like Baraccus was already just a figure in their history, lostto the advance of time.The world was moving on. It was up to her to convey knowledge from that pasthistory.But only to the right person.Magda dipped a quick bow and departed before they could insist that she acceptthe post they wanted her to take.As she was pushing closed one of the heavy double oak doors to the council’sprivate chambers, she heard footsteps. Turning, she saw Prosecutor Lothain and adozen men of his personal guard. Magda stepped to the side to make way for them.“Lady Searus,” Lothain said with a smile. “I hear that you have been at thecenter of yet more trouble.”“Shouldn’t you be down in the lower portions of the Keep searching for a killerto prosecute?”The menacing smile remained in place. “I don’t believe that the threat to oursecurity is confined to the lower portions of the Keep. I think dangers to ourcause are closer than most people think.”She knew what he was getting at, but she didn’t want to be distracted by Lothainany more than she had wished to be drawn into arguing with certain members ofthe council. She had to get back to her search.“I’m afraid that you would know about such threats better than I would. If youwill excuse me, I have things to do.”His smile returned. “Such as finding new quarters?”“As a matter of fact, yes.”“Rather sad that with a new First Wizard soon to be named you have to give upsuch luxurious apartments.”Magda wondered how he seemed to already know all about it.“It’s not sad at all. It is just a place to sleep. I am joyous that a new FirstWizard will soon be named. The people I care about are what really matter to me,not an apartment.”“And which people are they, Lady Searus, that you really care about?”“The innocent people of the New World who are being slaughtered in the name of acause.”Before he could say anything else, Magda started away. He caught her arm,stopping her. His grip was hurting her arm but she didn’t give him thesatisfaction of showing it.“No need to be in a hurry to move your things, Lady Searus. I may be able tohelp you out with an accommodation so that you can remain where you arecomfortable.”Magda’s only answer was a brief, noncommittal smile before she pulled her armaway and marched off. She kept her eyes straight ahead and didn’t slow for thewall of men in green tunics blocking her way. The prosecutor’s big personalguards stepped back at the last moment and just enough to let her pass.She couldn’t imagine what Lothain was talking about and she wasn’t particularlyinterested in coaxing it out of the man. She was sure that was what he hadwanted her to do. When she glanced back she saw him vanishing into the councilchambers.Magda wondered what business Lothain had with the council that he would beseeing them in a private session."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43 It was apparent to Magda that the city of Aydindril, though as busy and activeas ever, was on edge. Concern weighed on every face. People in small groups eyedpassing strangers as they talked in low, worried tones.Every day brought new stories of enemy advances, of bloody battles, of thenumbers of men lost, of cities that had fallen, of innocent civilians beingslaughtered by the approaching forces of Emperor Sulachan. She knew that some ofthe stories were nothing more than rumors and gossip. She also knew that thetruth was far more gruesome than most people knew.Glancing up between spaces in the tightly packed, two-story buildings as shemade her way down the crowded cobblestone street, Magda could see glimpses ofthe lush forests covering the foothills and lower sweep of the nearest mountain.Higher up, the pines and spruce thinned as they reached granite ledges at thebase of sheer cliffs. Beyond a few passing wisps of clouds and flocks of birdsthat lived in the stone face of the mountain, the massive cliffs supported dark,soaring stone walls of the Keep. Above the walls, even at this distance, shecould see ramparts, bastions, lofty spires, and towers joined by high bridges.For as long back as Magda could remember, the dark shape of the Keep had loomedover the city, at once protector and threat, the magic it embodied both guardianand target.Magda had always had mixed feelings about living in the Keep. She loved thevibrancy of Aydindril, so with a soon-to-be-appointed new First Wizard needingthe apartments, she had given thought to moving back down to the city. But shecouldn’t do that until she found out what was behind Baraccus’s death and theother things that were happening at the Keep.While no one seemed to believe her, Magda was sure that everyone at the Keep wasin danger. She couldn’t leave the Keep until she knew that the people livingthere were safe. While people were focused on the distant war, no one but herseemed aware that the enemy was already closer than anyone thought.Magda knew, the enemy was already slipping in among them.Even as Aydindril sweltered in the summer heat, there was talk that by winterthe enemy troops might be within striking distance of the city. Magda feared toconsider how devastating such a strike would be to the place where she’d grownup. If the city was overrun, that would also mean a siege of the Keep. The Keepcould withstand a siege for a long time, but not forever.Besides, it was impossible to win a war defensively. The forces from the OldWorld had made it clear that there would be no mercy. While some of Sulachan’sforces held the Keep under siege, others would lay waste to the New World. Whenthe Keep finally fell, they would make examples of every last person.That was what they did to every village, town, and city in their path. Eitherpeople surrendered, or they were made to suffer for refusing.Simply hiding behind walls and iron doors would not eliminate the threat. Sooneror later even the Keep walls would fall. Evil had to be defeated or it wouldonly grow stronger.How they were going to destroy this evil, Magda didn’t know. All she knew forsure was that it was not only getting closer every day, it was already amongthem. She had felt the painful presence of the dream walker. She had seen themonster that had come out of the dark and killed Isidore. Those were not randomevents; they were connected. Magda had to find the truth behind thoseconnections.Making her way past crowds on the streets was at times like trying to moveupriver. The peddlers shouting out the many benefits of their goods stood likerocks in that river as streams of people continually flowed around them.Some of the street merchants tended carts with salted meats and fish, freshvegetables, or a variety of ready-made goods. Other vendors carried traysstacked high with long loaves of bread. There were also hawkers draped withjangling strings of amulets prowling the crowds as they shouted out singsongwarnings of curses and plagues. They attracted flocks of bouncing childrenwanting to hear about curses of magic as parents rushed in and pulled them away.Magda sometimes crossed the street to avoid particularly aggressive hawkers shesaw grabbing the arms of passing women, insisting that they listen to why theyneeded the protection of a magic charm. Potential customers were warned thatwhen the enemy got closer, the supply of charms and talismans would all be goneand then it would be too late to get what was needed. Some people gave in to thewarning or bought the least expensive of the amulets simply to free themselvesfrom the hawker.Warm as it was, as she passed throngs of people Magda, like many women, kept thehood of her light cloak pulled up. People down in the city weren’t as likely torecognize her as were people up in the Keep, but she had been the wife of theFirst Wizard and as such it often surprised her how many people she’d never metrecognized her.With time working against her, she couldn’t afford delays. As much as she wouldlike to, she couldn’t stop to give guidance to people on the oath to avoid thedream walkers, or convey news from up in the Keep. There were also those whohated Baraccus and might want to give her a piece of their mind, or worse.Most people understood that surrender was suicide at best, slavery at worst. Butnot everyone could recognize the face of evil when it presented itself in theguise of salvation. She could hardly defend herself if a mob wanted to stone herbecause her husband had decided that they would go to war rather than surrender.Panicked people didn’t listen to reason and didn’t want to hear the truth.Sympathizers frequently stirred up resentment against the authority of militaryofficers, the council, and even the First Wizard for being unwilling to acceptthe peace that the emperor had offered. Peace, these people said, was as simpleas letting Emperor Sulachan rule instead of the council. They wanted to believe,and so they did, that the rule of either was the same difference in their lives.If other people wouldn’t accept the wisdom of their notion of “peace,” theadvocates were all too willing to use violence to make their point. It struckMagda as ironic that those who professed to want peace the most were quickest touse bloodshed to try to get their way.Magda pulled her cowl farther forward as a knot of people moved past her.Unshaven men leered at her shape, even though they could see little of it underthe cloak. They knew only that she was a woman, and therefore must be worthy ofogling. When a passing group of women happened to get a glimpse inside her cowl,Magda’s short hair told them that she was a nobody. They didn’t give her asecond look as they went on about their own business.At a cross street, Magda peered around the corner of a two-story brick buildingthat housed a tailor. On the other side of the street was an inn with a blue pigpainted on the sign hanging over the door. The narrow street around the cornerfollowed rolling, uneven ground. Despite how confining and confusing this partof the city of Aydindril was, she knew that this was the turn she needed totake.Magda had searched under the southern rampart but had learned that he was nolonger living there. As much as she needed to find him, she hadn’t wanted tobring undue attention to herself by asking too many questions. Those kind ofquestions would sooner or later get noticed.Isidore’s murder had made Magda more than a little cautious. She had nearly beena victim, too. A dream walker was no longer in Magda’s mind, but she had no wayof knowing if one might be in the mind of any person she talked to. A dreamwalker could no longer follow her through her own eyes, but she didn’t want themfollowing her through the eyes of others.So, she had gone to Tilly. Tilly had been horror-stricken over the death ofIsidore. At first she blamed herself, believing that if she hadn’t shown Magdathe way, then maybe none of it would have happened.Magda had convinced the woman that she was wrong. They were fighting evil, andthe evil was not Tilly’s doing. Magda had told her that Isidore herself saidthat they were warriors in this war. Evil would not rest. It had to be fought.Tilly had been silent for a moment and then asked if she, too, was a warrior inthis war. Magda told her that indeed she was, and in fact she had been more helpthan any of the council had been. Magda said that since no one else would helpher find Isidore’s killer, she intended to do it herself, and to that end sheagain needed Tilly’s help.It had taken a few days, but Tilly had discovered that the man whose help Magdasought was nowhere in the Keep. After several more days of discreet inquiry shehad finally been able to learn where he lived. Magda was surprised that he wouldhave moved out of the Keep and down into Aydindril, and frustrated that it hadtaken so long to find where he now lived. She knew that time to act was slippingaway.After glancing around to make sure that she wasn’t being followed, Magda turnedup the quiet street. There were no shops, only houses, mostly multi-familystructures. She could see that trees beyond the buildings shaded an alley. Thehouses and two-story dwellings were tightly packed together and in some placesconnected with common walls. Out back people planted gardens and laundry hung onlines. She could hear chickens and a hog or two. A crudely painted sign on onegate said eggs for sale.After following the street over several rises, she came to the place that wasset back beside a two-story stone building. There was a forked plum tree in thefront of the little porch. At the side of the small place she could see down thenarrow passageway between the buildings that the back was heavily shaded byoaks. She also saw the corner of a shed along with wood scraps and odd bits ofmetal neatly laid out beside it.On the porch, in under a low overhang, Magda tucked her small bundle under anarm and knocked firmly on the simple plank door. After a moment, she heardsomeone coming through the house from the back. He stopped on the other side ofthe door.“What is it?” he asked without opening the door.“Are you Wizard Merritt?”“I’m sorry but I can’t see anyone right now,” he said from the other side.“This is important.”“I told you, I can’t see anyone now. I’m busy working. Please be on your way.”She could hear the footsteps heading away from the door toward the back of thehouse."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44 “Please, I need to see you,” Magda called to the door. “I come with news ofIsidore.”She heard his distant footsteps pause.As she waited in silence, Magda wasn’t sure if he would come back and open thedoor or not. She wiped away a bead of sweat trickling down her temple as sheidly watched a lacewing hunting for aphids on the lush green leaves and stems ofa vine climbing one of the posts holding up the overhanging roof of the porch.At last she heard his footsteps returning.The door opened enough that Magda could see that he was as imposing a figure asIsidore had said. After all Magda had heard about him—from Baraccus, from themen down in the Keep, from wizards she knew, and from Isidore—she found it was asomewhat strange feeling to finally see him in the flesh. After all the thingssaid about him, he wasn’t exactly what she had pictured.He was somehow more.He was tall, and without a shirt it was plain to see that he was handsomelybuilt. He was a good deal younger than Baraccus. In fact, he didn’t look mucholder than her—maybe a couple of years at most.Magda had seen hundreds of wizards. The Keep was full of them. Merritt,especially without a shirt, didn’t look at all like her idea of what a wizardlooked like.His skin glistened with sweat and grimy smudges. There were a few streaks ofsoot on his face behind stray, wavy locks of light brown hair that was struckthrough with a lighter, sun-bleached, blondish brown. Disheveled as it was, itadded to his rugged looks.Somehow, impossibly, the sweat and the soot made him look all the better.But it was his hazel eyes cast with a shade of green that caught her breath. Itfelt as if he was looking right into her soul, weighing it for worth. At thesame time, she felt that she could see in his eyes that he was open about who hewas, without pretense or deception.Though they contained the same basic trait, the eyes of the gifted tended toappear quite different to her. In some people, such as warriors, the glimmer ofthe gift that she saw had a menacing aspect to it. In healers it had a softer,more gentle appearance. The aspect of the gift in Baraccus’s eyes had beenpassionately wise, resolute, formidable.Just as Isidore had said, Magda, too, could see both sincerity and competence inMerritt’s eyes.Yet unlike Isidore, Magda could also see the gift.In Merritt’s eyes, the gift was different from anything she had seen in herlife. It was a look that was at once breathtaking and dangerous, but at the sametime softened with an undertone of warmth. Under his intent gaze, she had toremind herself to let her breath out.On second consideration, she decided he did indeed look to her very much like awizard.“What news have you of Isidore?”His voice matched the look of him perfectly. It almost felt as if her wholebeing vibrated in harmony with the deep, clear tone of it. Magda swallowed andforced herself to speak.“Before I can say anything else, I must ask you to swear an oath.”His brow drew down. “An oath?”“That’s right. I need you to first swear an oath of loyalty to Lord Rahl, whichwill protect your mind from dream walkers. Only in that way can I know that weare talking in confidence.”He did the oddest thing, then.He smiled.It was an easy, warm smile that betrayed a shade of private amusement.“A bold, if not highly strange request from such a lovely stranger at my door.We haven’t even been properly introduced.”Magda pushed the cowl back off her head. “I am Magda Searus.”The smile vanished in a heartbeat. “Magda Searus?” His face turned red. “Wife ofFirst Wizard Baraccus? That Magda Searus?”“Yes.”The frown revisited his expression. “I was there, among all the people at theceremony the day your husband’s remains were purified in the funeral pyre. I sawyou there that day, in the distance. You had long hair.”“Well, with Baraccus dead, the council wanted it cut off. They were quiteinsistent about letting the world know that without Baraccus I am a nobody.Elder Cadell, personally, saw to cutting it.”He dipped his head respectfully. “I’m sorry about the loss of your husband, LadySearus. Baraccus was a truly great man.”“Thank you.”He stared into her eyes a long moment, head still bowed, then remembered himselfand straightened. “Please,” he said as his face reddened again, “wait there amoment, will you?”He abruptly shut the door.Magda realized, then, what else was different about him from most men. Theentire time he had been in the doorway, he had looked into her eyes, his gazewandering no farther than to her hair. The gazes of most men invariably wanderedelsewhere. Merritt hadn’t done that, even though the black dress she was wearingunder her light cloak did tend to reveal her shape to advantage.Magda heard him stumble over something inside that then rolled across thefloorboards. There was a thud as something heavy hit the floor. Then, it soundedlike a chair fell over. A few more things clattered when they fell. It wentsilent inside the house for a time.Magda glanced up and down the street to see if anyone else was hearing all thenoise or paying attention to the visitor at his door. She saw a woman across thenarrow street and up a ways come out and shake a rug. She folded it over and armand went back in without noticing Magda in the shadows of the porch. Throughsmall gaps in a screening lilac bush, Magda could see a few people in thedistance talking, but they were too far away to be able to see her standingbehind the greenery.The door finally opened wide. Merritt was still tucking in a dark shirt. Thelong, wavy locks of his light brown hair had been hastily brushed back,revealing that his face had been hurriedly wiped clean.“Sorry to make you stand out there, Lady Searus.” His face flushed again. “I’mafraid that I was out back working on a few things and—” He paused, apparentlyafraid that he was beginning to ramble. He made himself start over as he lifteda hand out in invitation. “Please, won’t you come in?”As Magda stepped through the doorway, she could see an overturned chair and asmall statue lying on its side. The place was small, with the strangest thingsstacked everywhere. Strange metal objects, not unlike the things she had seenBaraccus make, sat all around the room, making it difficult to tell what she hadheard fall to the floor and what had already been there.As odd as everything was, there was a strange kind of order to it all. Booksstood in tall columns in places at the side of the room. A wicker couch alsoheld books, but they were lying open and piled one atop another, as if to keep aplace marked. A variety of small tables held mounds of scrolls between candles,bottles, boxes, and bones.A small, tightly rolled scroll sticking out of a shelf had a variety of smallclay figures collected all around the end of it. As far as she could tell, theywere all floating around the end of the scroll with nothing holding them up. Itwas an inexplicable and disorienting sight.There were also profoundly beautiful statues standing in random places aroundthe room, not as if they had been placed to be admired, but simply, it appeared,put wherever there had been an empty spot at the time. There was a soldier aboutto unsheathe a sword carved from a gray stone, there were several smallerstatues of men in robes carved from pale butternut wood, and, carved from purewhite marble, there were several statues of the most graceful women Magda hadever seen.Draped over the table beyond the overturned chair was a large square of redvelvet. The tabletop was the only place in the entire room that wasn’tcluttered. A single gleaming sword sat in the middle on a raised portion of thered velvet.Magda noticed an ornate gold and silver scabbard attached to a baldric lying onthe floor. The scabbard was so striking that it could only belong with thesword.Merritt righted the chair, then hung the baldric and its scabbard over the backbefore he hurriedly removed books from the wicker couch. “Sorry for the mess. Idon’t ordinarily live in such clutter. It’s just that this place isn’t as roomyas my place at the Keep. Please, Lady Searus, won’t you have a seat?” He lookedaround. “Tea. I should make tea.”“No, none for me, thank you,” she said as she made her way to the wicker couch.He looked relieved. Magda wondered why he no longer lived at the Keep, butdidn’t ask; she had more important matters to get to first. She waited until heturned around to her again.“I need to talk with you, Wizard Merritt.”“So talk.” He gestured to the couch. “What about Isidore?”Magda wasn’t ready to sit. “What about the oath?”He put both hands in his back pocket as his posture relaxed a little. He grinnedboyishly. “You mean the devotion to the Lord Rahl? Master Rahl guide us. MasterRahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. That oath?”“Yes. You’re familiar with its purpose, then?”He was smiling as if it was a private joke. Magda didn’t think it was funny. Shecould feel her own face heating to red.“Actually, you see, Alric is an acquaintance of mine.”“You know, then, that he’s a good man, and that he means the devotion to protectus from dream walkers?”He still had a hint of a crooked smile as he kept her locked in his gaze. “Yes.Their side creates a weapon, we have to work to counter it. That’s why I helpedhim in creating the power contained within its bond.”Magda blinked in surprise. “Are you saying that you helped him create the magicthat protects people from the dream walkers? That power? You helped him withthat?”Merritt nodded. “To a certain small extent. I don’t know exactly how he craftedmagic that could do such a thing, but I do know that he’s as smart as he isdetermined. He was stuck at a point that was keeping the bond from taking holdand igniting in others, at their end. It worked for him, but he wanted it towork to protect other people as well, and it wouldn’t go to root in them, Iguess you could say. He knew that I happen to be familiar with unusualcalculations for spell couplings, so he asked for my help.”Magda tilted her head toward him. “You helped Alric Rahl create the magic of thebond.”He nodded again, looking quite earnest. “I provided the authentication routinesfor the verification web, from inside of it, in order to complete the validationprocess. That was what initiated the unification of the spell components he wastrying to combine so that the bond would activate in the proper sequence.“Once it ignited, locking down the series reductions, I was the first one tospeak the devotion. When I did, I did it from inside the completed web. I wantedto test it first to ensure that it wouldn’t inadvertently harm people when theygave the devotion to invoke the bond.”Magda couldn’t help staring openly at him. She touched her fingers to herforehead, trying to take it all in. “You mean that you were the one who made itwork?”He shrugged one shoulder. “No, not really. Alric did most of the work. He cameto me because he knew that I would be able to understand what he was trying todo. There aren’t many people who understand such complex combination routineswell enough to discuss it with him. He thought I might be able to see why theverification web wasn’t functioning exactly the way he intended and hoped that Iwould know what was needed.”“So it wouldn’t have worked without what you did,” she said.“Alric Rahl created something masterful. I guess you could say that I just addeda little seasoning to his stew.”“Then you are bonded to him?” Magda asked. “You are protected from the dreamwalkers?”His smiled vanished. “Oh yes, I am protected. He tested me with the dream walkerhe held captive. That’s how Alric knew that the bond he created finally workedin others. I was the first one protected by the bond. So, you see, there is nochance that a dream walker is hiding in the shadows of my mind, listening andwatching, if that’s what you’re worried about.“Now, what is it you wanted to tell me about my friend Isidore?”Magda’s heart sank.“I’m afraid that I got Isidore killed.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45 Merritt’s face took on the look of chiseled stone, much like his statues. Theaspect of the gift she saw in his eyes had a decidedly dangerous cast to it.“What do you mean, you got Isidore killed?”In that calm yet emotionally charged question, she could see that this was a manwith more than a simple temper. It was a refined sort of bottled fury that hadthe potential to be devastatingly violent, and yet at the same time he was alsoa man able to control it.That meant that he could focus it.“It takes a bit of explanation.”While at first a bit shy, once the subject became somber he turned all business.“So explain.”Magda rearranged the bundle under her arm as she finally sat on the wickercouch. It gave her the excuse to look away from his intense expression.“I was at first in shock over my husband’s death,” she began. “I couldn’tunderstand why he would take his own life, couldn’t understand why he wouldleave me like that, leave all of us. People said that his journey to the Templeof the Winds in the world of the dead must have crushed his spirit and sappedhis will to live.“Everyone accepted that story. They believed it was a straightforward suicide.And while it may have made grim sense to them, it didn’t make sense to me. As Ithought about it, I kept coming back to the core truth that Baraccus was not thekind of man to be so despondent that he would kill himself.“Besides, I was there when he came back from the Temple of the Winds, and whilethere was no doubt that he was troubled and distracted, I wouldn’t characterizehim as depressed.“He had too much to live for, too many things that mattered to him, too manypeople he cared about, too much important work yet unfinished. He wouldn’t killhimself to end any kind of personal despair. He cared about us all too much todo such a thing. With all of the New World in danger he had every reason to wantto fight for us.”“Then why would he do it?” Merritt asked as he went to the table to gaze down atthe sword.“That’s what I’m trying to find out. Baraccus knew that I wouldn’t believe thathe had simply wanted to end his life. He was counting on me to realize thatsomething about it didn’t make sense.“He knew that I would recognize that he would only have done such a thing if itwas to somehow protect all of us. That’s the way he was. That was his mission inlife. That was why he was First Wizard. He was a war wizard, after all. He tookthat mission very seriously.“War wizards don’t give up. They find a way around any obstacle, even if thatway results in their own death. He called the way of a war wizard the dance withdeath.“Shortly after his death, I found a note he’d left for me, telling me to seektruth. Somehow, for some reason, he couldn’t do that himself. Baraccus, notmerely as my husband, but as First Wizard, charged me with finding truth.“This is about something bigger than Baraccus. It involves all our lives. Evenbefore I found the note, I knew that I had to find answers, not only forBaraccus, not only for myself, but because all our lives are at stake. Forreasons I can’t yet fathom, he left the task to me.“His note said, ‘Your destiny is to find truth.’”Merritt, standing over the table, looking down at the sword as he listened,turned with a frown. “You mean the note said, ‘Your destiny is to find thetruth.’”Magda’s brow furrowed as she tried to recollect the exact words. She didn’t havethe note with her. She had hidden it back at the Keep in a secret compartment inhis workbench.She didn’t know why the exact wording mattered to Merritt. It seemed aninsignificant point. She knew, though, that wizards saw the world differently.Things that might seem insignificant to anyone else were often centrallyimportant to them.“Now that you mention it, I guess I can’t recall, exactly. I suppose that whatyou say makes more sense. Find the truth.”Merritt nodded as he turned his broad back to her once more. “What happenedthen?”“Not long after I found that note, the same day in fact, Lord Rahl was waitingto see me. As I talked to him, a dream walker that had apparently been hiding inmy mind all along nearly killed me before I could start looking for answers. Ina way, that was the beginning of an answer.“I was able to give the devotion to Lord Rahl in time to protect myself. But whywould a dream walker be hiding in my mind in the first place? I’m not evengifted.”“You just said that you believe Baraccus left an important mission to you,”Merritt said, “a mission that is somehow critical to all our survival.”“That’s true,” Magda said, “but the thing is, how would a dream walker haveknown that in the first place? Why would he have been hiding in my mind to beginwith?”“I see your point,” he said as he clasped his hands behind his back while pacingoff a few steps as he thought about it. “Maybe with Baraccus dead, the dreamwalker was simply trying to find out what you may have known about the FirstWizard’s business, his plans for fighting the war, weapons we’re developing,things of that sort.”“I guess it makes sense,” Magda said. “I don’t know how it could be possible forme to be important to the future of our people, but Baraccus believed it. Thedream walkers obviously had to have thought I was important enough to be worthwatching in the first place, and then certainly after I found that note. Once Isaw what it said, they would have seen it, too.“But before that, why would they care about the thoughts of a nobody?”“You aren’t a nobody,” Merritt said in a surprisingly compassionate voice as helooked over at her. “They may have cut your hair after Baraccus’s death, butthat doesn’t change you into a nobody. You are still Magda Searus, the same asbefore, with the same abilities, the same potential, the same mind, the samecapacity to think for yourself.”“I wasn’t born noble or gifted. That makes me a nobody in the minds of mostpeople in the Midlands.”Merritt stopped before the table and again stood gazing down at the gleamingsword lying on red velvet. “As long as their cutting your hair doesn’t make youa nobody in your own mind then it doesn’t make any difference what others think,now does it?”Magda had to smile. “That’s always been my attitude. It frequently gets me intotrouble, though. Before I met Baraccus, people often told me that I didn’t knowmy place. I’ve never much cared what most people thought about me, or what theythought my place should be. I always believed that I should think for myself andact accordingly. My status sometimes hinders me, but I don’t ever let it guideme.”“Good.” He turned away from the sword and folded his arms as he leaned backagainst the table to face her. “So what did you do next?”“I talked to a number of the people who had been closest to Baraccus, trying tofind clues. That got me nowhere.“So I went to the spiritist hoping that her unique abilities could help. Isidoretold me that she was only the spiritist’s assistant and that the spiritistcouldn’t see me.“I was desperate, so I told her that I believed Baraccus had sacrificed his lifein order to protect all of us and I was hoping that the spiritist could reachout to him for answers. I told her that I thought something important hadhappened when Baraccus had gone to the Temple of the Winds in the world of thedead. I needed her to contact him there, in the underworld, since this time hewasn’t coming back.“I told her that all is not right in the Wizard’s Keep, and that I believe theenemy is already here, among us. After all, how would a dream walker know aboutme from all the way down in the Old World? I told her that the council wouldn’tbelieve me. I told her that if I was right, then the enemy would likely directthe dream walkers to the spiritist to prevent her from assisting the wizards indeveloping defenses.“I finally got Isidore to admit that she was the spiritist. I convinced her thatbecause of her importance, she was in great danger that the dream walkers wouldtake her mind. That persuaded her to give the devotion to protect herself.“After she did, she told me the story of the slaughter of the people ofGrandengart and how she had learned that their spirits were not safely in theworld of the dead, where they belonged. She told me, too, the story of how youhad taken her eyes.”Magda gestured uncomfortably. “I couldn’t understand how she could do such aterrible thing. I couldn’t understand how she could . . . well, how she couldlet a wizard so fundamentally alter her, change her into something other thanshe had been born.”“If you think it’s upsetting, imagine how I felt,” Merritt said.Magda looked up into his eyes. She had to look away from the shadow of pain shesaw there.“Through Isidore’s story, I did come to realize how reluctant you were to dosuch a thing, and how determined she was to go through with it. While I ofcourse felt sorry for what she was giving up, I also felt sorry for you, for theawful burden she placed on you.“She was just starting to tell me that it wasn’t so terrible, like I thought,and what a wonderful new vision you had given her. But before she could finishexplaining and then contact the spirit world for me, we were attacked by somekind of monster and—”Merritt lifted a hand to stop her story. “What do you mean, a monster?”Magda shrugged. “It appeared to be a man, close to as big as you. He wasimpossibly strong. At first I thought that he had to be gifted and that he wasusing magic.“When I stabbed him, though, he didn’t bleed. When I got a good look at him, helooked like a dead man. He smelled like something dead, too.”Merritt’s frown deepened the creases on his brow. “A dead man? What do you meanhe looked like a dead man?”“He was blackened, his flesh shriveled, and it even looked decayed and pulledapart in places. He looked like a corpse.”He folded his arms across his chest. “That does indeed sound like a dead man.But was it dark? Are you sure you saw him clearly enough?”“It was pretty dark,” Magda admitted. “But I still had a lantern. I got a goodenough look.“I stabbed him a number of times, hard and deep. The blade, deep as it went,didn’t seem to harm him at all. Isidore used her powers as well, but that didn’tstop him either. We tried. . . . We tried.”Magda swallowed and had to look down at the floor away from Wizard Merritt’sgaze before she could go on. “He . . . he ripped Isidore apart. It all happenedso fast. He killed her before we could stop him, before we had a chance to run.“I realized later that a dream walker had to have been secretly lurking in hermind all along, listening. When I told her that I needed information from thespirit world, I never thought that a dream walker might already be there, in hermind. I had thought that I needed her to give the devotion in case a dreamwalker ever tried to take her. I should have realized that he might already bethere.“The dream walker had invaded my mind and spied on my thoughts without me beingaware of him, but then he had failed to kill me because I was able to give thedevotion and banish him from my mind in time.“He must have then been spying on me and Isidore from the shadows of her mind,but he didn’t want to spoil his second chance by trying what had failed before.He wanted us both. So he didn’t reveal himself, didn’t try to kill her beforeshe could give the devotion, as had happened with me.“He instead let us believe we were safe. He probably slipped away, then, as shestarted to give the devotion. He probably wanted to lull us into feeling securein order to make it easier for him to send the man who attacked us.“I should have realized that he might already be there watching Isidore becauseshe was important. I was just a lucky additional catch who happened along. Ifoolishly revealed too much before having her give the devotion.“If I’d made Isidore give the devotion first, he would not have heard howimportant I thought she was to uncovering the answers Baraccus wanted me tofind. He would not have realized that he needed to kill her before she couldhelp me.”Against her will, the vivid memory of that awful slaughter returned to fill hermind’s eye.“That’s why you asked me to give the oath before you would talk to me,” he said,half to himself.Magda nodded as she watched tears dripping onto the floor at her feet. “If I hadthought it through, first, and had her give the devotion from the beginning, shewould still be alive. She would have freed her mind from the dream walker beforehe overheard what I needed, and how much she mattered in my search for thetruth.”“But a dream walker didn’t kill her,” Merritt said.Magda swiped the tears from her cheeks. She knew how much Merritt meant toIsidore. She knew how reluctant he had been to help the woman. Magda knew, too,that even though Merritt had taken Isidore’s sight and altered her with magic,he had come to consider her a friend.Magda sucked back a sob. She couldn’t bring herself to look up at him.“No, the dream walker didn’t kill her. He must have gone to his contact in theKeep, and they sent that monster to slaughter her before she could have thechance to help me.“It’s my fault. If I hadn’t gone to her she would still be alive. Or if I’d hadthe presence of mind to realize how deeply the Keep has been penetrated by dreamwalkers and traitors, and had her take the protection of the bond right atfirst, she would be alive.“It’s my fault she was murdered.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46 Merritt crossed the room and sat beside her. “I see now why you think you’re toblame, but it wasn’t your fault, Lady Searus. You didn’t know that a dreamwalker was listening to the things you told Isidore.”Still, Magda couldn’t look him in the eye. “No, but I should have realized thatit was a strong likelihood. I should have thought it through. Had I taken theprecaution of having her swear loyalty to Lord Rahl first—”“It wouldn’t have changed anything.”Magda finally looked up at him through her watery vision. “How can you knowthat?”“The dream walkers know that you’re looking for answers, right?”Magda swallowed past the lump in her throat. “That’s right.”“Then if they know that much, they would know that you would sooner or later goto see the spiritist to try to find those answers. After all, with Baraccusdead, the spiritist would be the next logical place for you to go looking foranswers—answers, after all, that they want as well. In fact, they were alreadythere in her mind, secretly listening in on our other activities of the Keep’sbusiness as they waited for you.”“So if I had first had her swear loyalty—”“It would have made no difference. Don’t you see? We have to assume that theyalready learned everything they could by covertly searching through her mind, sothey were probably hiding in the hopes of hearing any new bit of informationthat you or anyone else might happen to divulge to Isidore. They were there tospy, to collect information. Information is the coin of war. When she agreed toswear the oath, they knew that was the end of them being able to learn any morefrom her, so they killed her before she could help you discover anything.”“But had I thought to—”“Had you thought to have her give the oath right at first, they would havekilled her just the same. Talking to her first only delayed her murder for abrief time while they eavesdropped.“They would have wanted Isidore dead for reasons beyond you. She was seekingvital answers in her work, answers about what the emperor’s wizards are up to.She was trying to discover why the enemy is harvesting the dead and what they’redoing with both the bodies and the souls of those dead. The dream walkerswouldn’t want her to help us understand what they’re doing, or why the souls ofthose dead aren’t with the spirits in the underworld, where they belong.”“Then they know everything Isidore knew,” Magda said. Her gaze flicked around asif driven by her racing thoughts. “Everything Isidore knew has been compromised.They know it all.”Merritt nodded. “It would appear so, and because of that we have even biggertrouble than we realized. Because of what Isidore knew, and what she was workingon, she was already marked. By talking to her, you likely actually delayed herdeath. The important thing now is to find out what she knew, and therefore whatthe dream walkers learned by spying on her mind.”Magda wiped a hand back across her face to dry her tears as she considered theimplications. Her search for answers, for the truth, had just become even morecritical.“It sounds like you may be right that my failure to have her give the oath atfirst made no real difference in the outcome.”“You aren’t to blame,” he agreed. “You could just as easily say that it’s myfault she’s dead. After all, I’m the one who gave her abilities that made her athreat to the enemy. Had I refused, she very likely would still be alive, doingnothing more dangerous than helping to advise those in mourning about the soulsof their dead relatives.“But in the end, we can’t live our lives by ‘what if’ and ‘if only.’ We can onlydo the best we can to the best of our ability based on what we know. That’s whythe truth is so important.“Sometimes, as in Isidore’s case, it’s our skills that bring the attention ofevil. Evil abhors those with ability. Emperor Sulachan wants to destroy justabout everyone with the gift in order to make everyone helpless before him. Hehas already made significant strides in purging the Old World of magic. He can’tafford to let it flourish here.“In the process, he is willing to lay waste to the gift itself, strip it frommankind, all to be able to consolidate power for himself and rule through bruteforce. The gift—our abilities—stand in his way and mark us as targets.”“That’s true,” Magda said. “Baraccus told me once that Sulachan would ratherannihilate us than allow us to live in peace, because that would mean the riskthat his people would want the same freedom to live their lives that we have.”Merritt nodded his agreement. “People like Isidore, like you, are not going tostand aside and do nothing as he slaughters people. Isidore was fighting for usall. She was well aware that she might lose her life in this struggle. In fact,I told her as much. That didn’t stop her.“She was a warrior in our cause. So are you, or you wouldn’t be seeking thetruth at the risk to your own life. If you were any less, you would give up yoursearch and move away to somewhere safe. Yet you stay in the Keep, right in themidst of the danger.”“There is no safe place, or at least there soon won’t be,” Magda said. “Safetyis only an illusion when evil is on the hunt. I can’t stand by and watch. I haveto act.”“We all can be only who we are, no more, no less,” Merritt said.“That’s a beautiful sentiment.” Magda smoothed a wrinkle in the skirt of herdress lying across her knee. “Is that why you gave in to her wishes when youcould have said no?”He stared off across the room for a long moment. “It was the path she chose.People have to live their own destiny.”That sounded very much like what Baraccus had said in his note to Magda abouther following her own destiny.Magda wasn’t sure that Merritt was right, but it was an inviting notion tobelieve that she wasn’t responsible for Isidore being murdered.“Thank you, Wizard Merritt, for helping me see it another way. I can see nowthat there is more to finding safety than me simply having Isidore give an oath.I must admit, though, that I do feel a bit ashamed for allowing myself to feelbetter. It isn’t easy to absolve one’s self of guilt.”“Lady Searus, you were not the cause of her death. Evil likes to shift guilt tothe victims. Don’t you let them.”Magda nodded as she hooked some of her hair back behind an ear. “Please, I wouldfeel better if you would call me Magda.”His smile added a warmth that made his face all the more agreeable. “And I amjust Merritt.”Magda returned the smile, but it quickly faded.“I’m afraid that I must ask some questions, Merritt, that you will not like measking, but I need answers if I’m to get at the truth.”He leaned back a little. “Really? And what do you need to know about?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47 “Why have you moved away from the Keep?”He stood and strolled to the table with the sword. “I wanted to be alone to workin peace,” he said with his back to her. “I find the Keep to be . . . adistracting place.”“Really? From the quantity and quality of what I can see in this room alone, tosay nothing of what Isidore told me, I’d say you are a man of great focus andintensity. I think that you must have had more reason than that.”He glanced back over his shoulder. “Well, besides that, it isn’t safe there.”“I see. And why not?”“You said yourself that the dead walk the dark passages of the Keep.”“And you knew that before I told you about Isidore, did you?”Magda wondered why he’d really left the Keep. It didn’t make sense to her that awizard that Baraccus thought so highly of would leave what must have beenimportant work at the Keep, where he would have been surrounded by a wealth ofresources, everything from books, to tools, to an abundance of reference itemsinvested with magic, as well as being able to draw on older, more experiencedwizards for guidance.Besides that, if it was a matter of safety, there were places at the Keepprotected by guards as well as shields. She had seen no indications that hislittle home had any such shields to protect him as he worked.But even so, that was really only a side issue. She was trying to find a way toease into her relevant questions. He seemed to sense as much. He turned around,fixed her with a serious look, and again folded his muscular arms.“Why don’t you tell me what it is that you really want to know, Magda?”She lifted her chin. “All right, then.” She hated repeating hurtful words, butshe didn’t know how else to get at the underlying truth without airing thecharges so that he could at least have the chance to give his side.“I hear it told that you are responsible for getting a number of wizardskilled—good men who were important to our war effort. I’ve also heard it saidthat besides those deaths being on your hands, you have abandoned the men youled and refuse to help with important work for our defense. Some even say thatyou’re a traitor. Is any of that true?”He stared down at her a moment. She had thought that the gift in his eyes mighttake on a dangerous appearance. Oddly enough, it didn’t. His expression was astrangely unreadable mask. In a way, that was worse because it hid his innerfeelings. She felt like a traitor herself for asking him to answer suchinflammatory charges, but too much was at stake and the charges were too seriousfor her to ignore.“As long as we’re airing what ‘people say,’” he finally said in a chillinglycalm voice, “I hear it told that you and Lord Rahl put on quite the show beforethe council to make it appear that dream walkers are in the Keep and invadingpeople’s minds, all so that the two of you could frighten people into swearingloyalty to Lord Rahl.”“But you know Alric Rahl.” Magda could feel her face going red. “You know why hecreated the oath.”“Maybe I don’t know him as well as I thought I did. What with everything elseI’m beginning to hear, what am I to believe? People say that according to noless an authority than Head Prosecutor Lothain, Baraccus had secret meetingswith people who might very well be enemy agents. The prosecutor has saidpublicly that he suspects that Baraccus might have been part of a plot, and thathe may have convinced you to go along with the scheme.”Merritt clasped his hands behind his back as he paced before her, going onwithout pause.“Worse, many people both up in the Keep and down here in the city of Aydindrilwonder openly if Baraccus is responsible for the war going so badly. They wonderif he wrongly took us into war in the first place and lied about the reasons.They say that if he really had our best interest at heart, we wouldn’t be losingthe war. They say that Baraccus must have finally committed suicide because ofhis sense of guilt over dooming his own people.”Magda shot to her feet. “But Baraccus didn’t take us into war. We were invaded!”Merritt shrugged. “People say otherwise. They say we weren’t invaded at all,that our side started it. They say that you, Lord Rahl, and Baraccus plotted allalong to start a war and use it as an excuse so that Lord Rahl could seize ruleof the Midlands and take it over as part of D’Hara.”“But you know that the dream walkers—”“Yes, yes, I know that dream walkers are real, but am I to believe thepreposterous story that they are already here, on the loose in the Keep, justbecause you say they are, when there is no proof except your own self-servingstories of how they attacked you and sent monsters to kill Isidore when you werealone with her? Am I to discount the credible charges against you and Baraccusbrought by no less an authority than our eminent prosecutor and some members ofthe council, all saying that your wild stories of plots against our people andtraitors in our midst are really meant to distract people from your own guilt?How can I be expected to disregard such serious accusations?”He opened his arms before her. “So you tell me. Are you a traitor to theMidlands, as so many people say?”Magda swallowed. She was sure that her face was bright red.“For not living up at the Keep any longer, you certainly seem to have heard someof the ugliest gossip.”He arched an eyebrow in a way that would have made her back up a step if thecouch hadn’t been at her heels.“Gossip? Not merely gossip, but the suspicions of even high officials. Peoplesay that since the charges are so serious there must be something to them. So,you tell me, Magda. Are they true? I need to know if I’m talking to a traitor. Ithink I have a right to know before I answer any of your questions.”Her hands fisted as she glared at him. “None of it is true. It’s all lies.Hateful, despicable lies.” Her gaze fell away. “But I admit that I have no wayof revealing the truth to you. I wish I did, but I don’t.”He did the oddest thing, then. He smiled. “And I would wish for a way to revealthe truth to you as well. But the truth can seem awfully small and insignificantwhen compared to a mountain of lies.”Magda was angry. She hated to hear such terrible things said about Baraccus. Sheknew that some people believed those very lies while the truth was that he hadgiven his life to protect the people of the Midlands. She didn’t know why, yet,but she knew that was why Baraccus had died.Merritt spread his hands. “Do the accusations make Baraccus guilty? Make youguilty?”“No.”“Ah, but you worry that similar accusations make me guilty. You worry that,because the accusations are so serious, they must be true.”“I see your point.” She looked away from his eyes as she wiped a tear from hercheek. “I’m sorry, Merritt, for being so unfair. I’m sorry to come to you out ofthe blue, without invitation, and dare to question you about things I’ve heard.“But this is about our very survival. If I make a mistake, and trust the wrongperson, we could all pay with our lives.”“At least you had the courtesy to come and ask me for the truth instead ofsimply accepting the lies.” Sadness haunted his smile. “It’s ironic that so muchof my life’s work has been devoted to being able to find a way to ensure that weknow the truth when it’s important enough, when lives are at stake, and now liesare used against me and that work.”“I see what you mean,” Magda said, “I really do. I feel like I need to prove myinnocence to you, and at the same time I feel helpless because I can’t.”His smile was reassuring. “Baraccus was quite a remarkable man and no fool. I’vealways thought that there had to be a good reason why he considered you worthyto stand beside him. Baraccus believed in you. That says a great deal to me.”Magda felt conflicted. She didn’t want to ask him about the things she’d heard,didn’t want to give the accusations credibility, but at the same time she neededto put the issues to rest and so far they hadn’t been.“I can tell by the look on your face how troubled you are. You don’t know me, soit’s understandable that you don’t know what to believe. Why don’t you go aheadand ask the things you need to know about.”Magda nodded as she took a seat once more, hoping that by sitting it might takesome of the hostility out of her question.“I’ve heard accusations from wizards who were there that men died because youhad abandoned your duty to them. I need to know why they think you areresponsible for the deaths. I need to know if you are the kind of man who wouldwalk away and let other men die. I realize that it isn’t fair of me to repeatsuch charges from others, or to expect you to answer them. You certainly don’towe me the truth.”She looked up into his eyes. “But please, Merritt, I’m trying to find answers towhat is really going on. I believe that the Keep, all of our lives, are in gravedanger. I need to find out what is really going on before it’s too late. Wouldyou please not take offense at my asking these questions and simply tell me thetruth?”“And how will I prove to you that I’m telling you the truth?”She smiled a bit. “As it so happens, the truth has always mattered a great dealto me. Baraccus often said that I was the bane of liars. I’d like to think thatI’m a person who can recognize the truth when it’s told to me, or detect a lie,and often I can, but I guess that in the end I have no real way of knowing truthfrom lies.“I’d still like to hear your side of it.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48 Merritt nodded as he pulled a footstool closer and sat facing her on the wickercouch.“There are people who want things,” he said, “but they aren’t willing to listento the truth about the things they want.”“That’s true enough in a general sense, but what does it have to do with peoplesaying that men died because of you?”“If you want to know the truth, then it takes some explaining so that you canunderstand. Bear with me?”Magda conceded with a nod for him to go on.“There are those at the Keep who want a specific kind of magic invested in anobject. They want me to do it.”Magda glanced around the room at all the strange objects lying about everywhere.There were things of every size and shape. Some were recognizable, some weren’t.Some of the objects looked innocent enough, while others looked like they wouldsnap shut and take off a finger if she were to touch them.“What kind of object?”He rubbed his palms on his knees as he searched for words. “Well, it’s a kind ofkey to unlocking repositories of great power.”“A key? These people want you to make a key?”Merritt waved a hand as if to minimize the impression. “I use the word ‘key’loosely. It’s only a key in the sense that it works to unlock the power. I’mtrying to make it as simple as possible.”“Sorry I’m so dense.”His face turned red. “I didn’t mean it to sound that way. It came out wrong.It’s just that it can get awfully complicated to explain.”“So help me understand so that I can know the truth.”He took a deep breath before going on. “You see, it’s not the specific key—theobject itself—that really matters. The key, the object portion of it, couldactually be a lot of different things. What matters is the specific magicinvested in that object. The magic is what makes it a key that functions tounlock the power.”She didn’t think that sounded all that complicated.He was choosing his words carefully. It wasn’t uncommon for wizards not to wantto reveal details. Baraccus had sometimes done the same thing, even with her.It could also be that Merritt was being evasive for some reason. After all, shehad asked about men who died because of him. At least, that was what she’dheard. It could be hearsay. On the other hand, he might be trying to shiftblame.Magda decided to let him explain it in his own way and to be open-minded aboutwhat she heard.“I’ve worked on this key, as it were, for years. It’s a project that has longbeen close to my heart. These people, who have only recently come to be aware ofthe existence of this power, believe that it’s very important that I go forwardand complete the key, but for reasons of their own.“The thing is, I can’t complete the key because it’s impossible to complete.More importantly, though, it’s unnecessary.”Magda couldn’t let that go. “If it’s the key to opening great power, why is itunnecessary? Especially now, when we’re at war? Couldn’t this power maybe helpus?”“No, it can’t.”“How can you be certain?”“Because,” he said, “I learned that the chests—”“Chests?”“Yes, the chests are the repositories of this power that these people want to beable to unlock. It’s not actually the chests that the key unlocks, but the powercontained within them. Like I said, I’m trying to make something extremelycomplex understandable.”Magda nodded for him to go on, but her mind was already reeling with worries.She reminded herself not to jump to conclusions.“Anyway,” he said, “I learned that the chests were taken away to the Temple ofthe Winds by the Temple team. I don’t know if they were supposed to be takenthere or not, but the simple fact remains that they were. Some on the team didsay that they wanted to protect mankind from the tyranny of magic. Perhapsthat’s what they meant and why they did it. In any event, they’re safe there,sealed away out of reach in the underworld.”Magda’s heart felt like it skipped a beat. Her skin went icy cold with goosebumps.Merritt frowned. “What’s wrong?”Magda swallowed. “Nothing.”“Your face just turned white.”“It’s nothing. Probably the heat.”But it was something. The whole world felt as if it was crushing in on her. Sheknew that once a new First Wizard was named, she had to tell him what she knew.She reminded herself that she might be jumping to conclusions. She wished shecould slow her racing heart.Merritt sprang up and went to a side table. He hurriedly poured a glass ofwater. He handed her the glass and then sat again on the stool in front of her,watching her with great concern.“Take a drink. It will help.”“Thanks.” Magda took a sip. “I’m fine. Please, go on with what you were tellingme.”Merritt watched to make sure she took a few more sips before continuing thestory. “Well, since the chests are safely locked away in the Temple of theWinds, there is no longer any point in me attempting to complete the investmentof magic in the key to unlock their power. But even more importantly, even if Iwanted to, it can’t be done.”Magda needed time to think. She couldn’t be sure, after all, that he was talkingabout the same thing. There were a great many things, important things, alldangerous, that had been sealed away in the Temple of the Winds.“You mean it can’t be done because of the rare rift calculations for creating aseventh-level breach that Baraccus couldn’t give you?”Merritt leaned back and blinked in surprise. “You know about that?”Magda worked to keep her voice under control. “Baraccus told me about it sometime back when you went to see him. I remember him saying that you had wantedthe rift calculations for such a breach. Apparently, he thought a lot of youbecause he told me that he wished he could have given you what you needed, buthe couldn’t because the formulas were sealed away in the Temple of the Winds andno one could get to them.”Merritt was staring at her, so she knew that she had to say something.“So, is that why you can’t complete the magic for this key?”“Yes, exactly.”Magda was struck by the sincerity of his frustration. She watched his eyes lookaway as he went on, almost as if talking to himself, opening again the wound ofhis disappointment.“I’ve spent years working on the details of the conjured structure. No one elseunderstands it the way I do. They don’t understand its true purpose.” He lookedup. “You see, I don’t believe that it was ever supposed to be just a key.”“What do you mean? Why not?”He leaned in more intently. “I’ve come to believe that what is contained inthese receptacles, these chests, is the only form of power known to exist thatpredates the star shift.”“You really believe that’s what in the chests?”“Yes. That’s why I was so sure in the first place that there have to be formulasfor a seventh-level breach. Baraccus confirmed their existence when he told methat they were locked away in the Temple of the Winds.”Merritt’s gaze was locked on her eyes. “If I’m right, which I am, then thispower is an order of magnitude beyond what anyone understands. If I’m right, itcontains enough power to destroy the world of life.”Magda took a sip of water for the chance to look away from the intensity of hishazel eyes. She couldn’t make her fingers stop trembling.“Dear spirits . . . is that really even possible? Do you actually think such athing could be true, that something could have that much power?”“I do. I think the key was originally intended to contain theseventh-level-breach code in order to harness that power. That’s why the breachcode exists. It has no other purpose. Same with the rift calculations.”“You mean, as in a rift in the world of life? And the breach code cracks theegg?”He betrayed what he thought of her analogy with a small smile before he went on.“After years of tracking down everything I could about the origins of the powerand what it really is, I think I have come to understand it as no one elsedoes.”“And what have you come to understand?”“Well, first and foremost, I know enough not to fool myself into thinking I knoweverything. But from what I do know, I believe that any number of people wouldhave enough knowledge or ability to misuse it and cause great harm. What theylikely don’t understand, though, is that in pursuing their own ends, they couldinadvertently annihilate all life.“But that’s if it’s misused. I’m convinced that this power needs more than asimple key if it is to function properly. I’ve found bits and pieces in ancienttexts that give me cause to believe that the key, in a way, also has to be acaretaker of the power, a kind of protector.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49 “That doesn’t sound like a bad idea,” Magda said, absently, as she tried tocorral her galloping thoughts.She had never felt so lonely. She didn’t know what to do, who she could turn to.Merritt seemed the obvious choice, but there was too much she didn’t know abouthim. If anything she’d heard turned out to be true, telling him could very wellturn out to be the worst decision she could make.Her only hope was if the new First Wizard was named soon. The new First Wizardwould need to know what she knew. He would know what to do.“After a great deal of research and work, I finally have every aspect of mytheory worked out and in place,” Merritt was saying. “I’m convinced that I knowhow to create this unique power for the key if only I could get my hands on therift calculations and breach formulas. If I could, I could then make a key thatwould function as it should.“This magic I would create with the help of the formulas, would at the same timefunction for something else of great importance that I came up with along theway.”That caught her attention.He lifted an arm in a gesture of frustration, then sighed as it dropped back torest on his leg. “But without all the parts, the magic can’t be formatted andthus initiated.”“Are there no substitutes that would work well enough?”“No. It needs the correct parts, and all the parts, simple as that.”Magda steered him back to the thing that had caught her attention. “So is thisunique magic also what would allow you to create in a person the ability to pulltruth from lies? Is that the other thing of great importance you wanted tocreate?”He looked surprised. “Yes, as a matter of fact it is.”“So then the key these people want that you know how to make and the person youdescribed to the council that you wanted to alter to be able to pull truth fromlies, are linked with common elements and share some base form of this magic?”“That’s right—at inception, anyway. They differ as they develop, and in the endof course, but they do need to have certain base elements from the riftcalculations in common.”“You mean they both need yeast to make the dough rise?”Merritt frowned suspiciously. “For someone ungifted, you seem to have a knackfor grasping the inherent logic in the nature of magic. And for someone whodescribed herself as a nobody, you also seem to know a great deal about some ofthe most secret projects in the Keep.”Magda tilted her head, peering at him from under her brow. “You may think thatthey’re secret, but Isidore knew about the person you want to alter with thismagic. If she knew, then the dream walkers know. If the dream walkers know, thatmeans Emperor Sulachan knows. If they know about the person, then they very wellmay know about the key you’re trying to make. If they know about the key, theyknow what it is meant to unlock.”Merritt let out a troubled sigh. “I suppose that’s all possible, but it can’t dothem any good. It would be impossible for them to reconstruct my work, andwithout those occulted calculations that are locked away in the Temple of theWinds, the magic that I was working on can’t be completed.“Besides, the key would do them no good because the power itself is sealed awayand inaccessible.”Magda had to force herself to hold her tongue. She instead asked a question.“Why would these repositories containing this great power not have a key in thefirst place? What would be the purpose of creating something without a way tomake it work?”“Good question. Unfortunately I don’t have a good answer. People take history atface value and assume it’s accurate, but often it really isn’t. Accounts of pastevents differ. You don’t know the honesty or the motives of the person who wrotethe chronicle. Accounts from antiquity may have been lost over time, leavingcritical gaps that would change the picture. Some of what we do have mayactually have been rumor or even false charges that over time were wronglyassumed to be true. Some historical accounts are biased or distorted viewpoints,while others were embellished along the way. It’s a mistake to indiscriminatelyassume historical accounts are true.“All that is meant to say that I don’t know the truth about an original key. Therepositories holding this power were a relatively recent creation intended tosafeguard the power in its resting state. The key doesn’t actually open them,it’s actually meant to unlock the ancient power contained within them. For all Iknow, it may be that when the power was created it had a key. All I know forsure is that the power itself still survives today and there is no known key forit.“That creates a problem because while the key doesn’t exist, the power does andeven without the key this power is still profoundly dangerous.“That’s one reason I’ve been working so hard to complete the key. Everyone elsethinks the key is supposed to simply unlock the power, but from bits ofsurviving books and scrolls from before the star shift, I’ve come to believethat the key was an object intended to protect the power, not merely unlock it.”The word “protect” stuck out to her. He said it with a kind of natural ease. Sheremembered what the men down in the lower reaches of the Keep had been workingon when they were killed.Her gaze went to the object on the table.“Protect. Like a sword,” she said.“Yes,” he finally admitted. “The existing references and formulas we still haveled people to believe that the key must be made in the form of a sword. So,those trying to make the key try to make it in the form of a sword.“They don’t know why, and they don’t really care. They simply try to make thekey in the form of a sword as is implied in the reference material in order thatit might work to unlock the power.”“And you think,” she guessed, “that there is meaning to the prescription thatthe key take the form of a sword.”“I do. That the magic is supposed to be invested in a sword implies its purpose,does it not? Besides working to unlock what it protects, I believe it wasintended to have the power to prevent the wrong person from meddling with thepower.”“So, if there’s no key, and the power is that incredibly dangerous, that’s whythe chests containing the power were shut away in the Temple of the Winds in thefirst place?”“Very likely so,” he said. “The problem is, if anything should go wrong, the keywould be the only chance to bring us all back from the brink of annihilation.”He leaned in and lowered his voice, even though there was no one who couldpossibly overhear him. “You see, the key I would create isn’t simply coded tothe power, it’s coded to work with the person using it. It has to be the rightperson, for the right reasons, or it won’t work. The magic can read not only thekey, but the intentions of the one holding the key.”Magda knew from Baraccus that dangerous magic often had multiple layers ofprotection. Books of magic usually had wards and safeguards to protect them.According to Isidore, Merritt made just such bindings for books of magic. He wasapparently employing that principle in his design for the key to the power.“But all of this is only theoretical, since you can’t make the key and proveyour theories.”“Well, yes, I suppose that’s true. The problem is,” he said, “there are thosehere in the Keep—”“You mean the council.”His mouth twisted as he finally gave in. “Good guess.”She was getting tired of dancing with shadows. “Not all that difficult.”He flashed a brief smile before turning serious again. “The council wants itdone anyway. They want the key to be made.”Magda had to take another drink of water to compose her voice. “Why? If everyoneknows that the power is locked in the Temple, why would the council want the keymade?”“They’ve given me a long list of reasons, none of which make a lot of sense tome, but they’re very insistent. They wish it to be done, period. Ultimately,they don’t need to explain themselves. They wish it to be done so they commandthat it be done. But wishing and commanding doesn’t mean that it can be done andthey won’t listen to reason.”“I’m well aware of how inflexible the council can be.”“They certainly are in this case.”Magda’s mind was racing. “Which councilmen want it done?”“All of them, but Weston and Guymer seem to be the ones forcing the issue mostof the time.”“Weston and Guymer. It would be them,” Magda murmured to herself. She looked upagain. “I thought the council didn’t want you to use this same basic conjuringto create this, this person who could pull truth from lies.”His hazel eyes again locked on her.“The Confessor,” he said."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50 “Confessor?” Magda asked.“That’s right.”She leaned forward, puzzled by the name. “Confessor?”“Yes, that’s what I call the person I would create because with the power Iwould invest in them, they could make anyone—anyone—confess the truth, no matterhow abhorrent the truth may be, no matter how desperately they previously mayhave wanted to conceal it, no matter the lies they’ve told or hidden behind. Thetouch of a Confessor’s power would change all that.”“So, the council wants you to make the key, for which there would be no use, butnot this Confessor for which there could possibly be great use?”“Ironic, isn’t it?”“To say the least.” She wondered if something more than irony was involved. “Istill don’t understand why both the key and this Confessor could require thesame base elements.”“Because at their core they both serve the cause of truth.”“How can the key serve the cause of truth? I get the Confessor, but not thekey.”“At their root, the key and the Confessor both authenticate truth. TheConfessor’s power would force the subject to reveal the truth, while all of thecoded alignments of the key involve proofing it against reality. Reality istruth. Therefore, both the Confessor and the key need the same formulas toinitiate their ultimate function.“In much the same way that a verification web authenticates a spell, the baseelements of this new form of magic I’m trying to create gauges, or measures,matters at hand against reality. In the case of the Confessor, the subject isleft unable to speak anything other than the truth.“The key, as well, follows a verification sequence. By building inauthentication routines, it prevents a person from using it, for example, ifthey are lying about their reason for unlocking the power.”“Maybe the council doesn’t want you to create the Confessor because they fearthe truth,” Magda said.“You may have just arrived at the heart of it.”“But they still want the key.”“Right,” he said. “They want a simple key to make the power work, but I didn’tthink I could trust anyone with a key to that much power, even the council, so Iintended to make the more complex key. That has been a great deal harder todevise, but if I ever get the chance to finally ignite the web, it will be worththe years of extra work.“Yet neither the one I envision nor the simple one the council wants can becreated because they both would need the information that is out of reach in theTemple of the Winds. Without those formulas, I can’t make the key, or theConfessor. At least it doesn’t matter about the key because the power, like theformulas, is safely out of reach.”Magda thought she might be sick. She gulped a drink of water. She wondered whythe council would fear the truth. But more immediate questions sprang to mind asshe stalled for time to think it through.“How would this person, this Confessor, be able to force someone to speak onlythe truth?”He looked uncomfortable as he searched for the words. “You have to understand,Magda, that a Confessor would be a last resort to get at the truth. For example,to get a killer to confess to murders he committed so that we would know theextent of his victims, know beyond a doubt his guilt. Or imagine if a man hadsnatched a child for ransom, or worse. A Confessor could pull the truth from hislies and deception.”She arched an eyebrow. “Or a traitor could be made to give a true confession?”“Without question or hesitation.”Magda touched her fingers to her forehead, trying to grasp the enormity of whathe was telling her.“But how would this Confessor actually get the person to confess?”“Basically,” he said, “the magic I would invest in them, much like the key,would contain elements of both Subtractive and Additive Magic.”“So you would need a gifted person to create a Confessor.”“Actually, no, not at all. The person would be the vessel into which I wouldplace this ability, this unique form of power.”“But if they aren’t gifted—”“Everyone has at least a small spark of the gift. It’s part of our life force.Magic is merely a matter of degree. You are said to be ungifted, but that’s nottechnically accurate.“Life connects us all to magic, as illustrated through the design of the Grace.So, for a Confessor, I don’t need a gifted person, just a living one.”Having spent a lot of time around Baraccus and a number of talented wizards,Magda was somewhat familiar with their world and what they considered to bewithin the working realm of possibility. She might not have fully understoodwhat they did or how they did it, but she did have a general sense of the sphereof their capabilities. This was outside that sphere.Her eyes widened with sudden understanding. She looked up at him. “You wouldalter a Grace.”“Of course,” he said, as if it were a trivial matter.This was one of the reasons people feared makers. They didn’t think in terms ofthe impossible, only in terms of how something might be done. What Merritt wasdescribing was unconventional thinking that, to most people, bordered onmadness.“But you could change the person you turned into a Confessor back, right? Imean, if—”“Change them back?” He looked at her as if she had lost her mind. “Once Ialtered them, the power would become an integral part of the person, inseparablefrom who they become. Once altered in this way, they would forever be aConfessor. There could be no going back. Once done, it can’t be undone.”Magda was feeling sick to her stomach. “So how would this power you would investin a person actually work?”“When a Confessor unleashes their power into someone, the Subtractive side of itwould destroy who the person was.”“It would kill them?”“No, not really, not in the conventional sense.”Magda leaned in with a frown. “What does that mean?”“I mean, no, it wouldn’t kill them.” He gestured, seemingly reluctant toexplain, but finally he did. “The way I’ve created the web, it’s narrowlytargeted. Fine threads of Subtractive Magic would burn through the targetperson’s mind like lightning crashing through a tree, all the way down throughits roots, to obliterate their identity.“So, in that sense, who they once were would be dead. They can never regain whatis eliminated with the Subtractive side of the Confessor’s power. They arealive, but who they were no longer exists. What it means to be that person isgone.”“So what would exist for them?”“In place of who they were, in place of what the Subtractive Magic destroys, theAdditive Magic would at the same time flow in behind, filling the void to createin them total, complete, blind devotion to the Confessor. The Confessor wouldbecome the center of the person’s universe, the only thing that matters to them.The Confessor would become their identity, or the object of it, to be moreprecise.“In that realm of total commitment and absolute compliance, they would feel theoverpowering need for the object of their fidelity—the Confessor—to give themdirection. That would be the only purpose of their life. It would be aterrifying emptiness in their existence to be without the direction of theConfessor who touched them with this power.“The Confessor could at that point command anything and the person would becompelled to comply, no matter what the command was. If it is physicallypossible, they would without hesitation carry it out even at the cost of theirown life. Even if it wasn’t possible, they’d still try with every fiber of theirbeing until told by the Confessor to stop, or until they died. The only purposeto their new existence would be to do as the Confessor commanded.“So, as you can imagine, the Confessor would have but to ask and the personwould, without hesitation, confess the truth.“They would be utterly incapable of lying. That part of them, the desire, theneed, the ability to lie, would have been destroyed and forever gone. Who theywere is irretrievable. When the Confessor asks for the truth, telling the truthbecomes the only thing that matters to the person touched by the power.”Magda was horrified. “How could you give that much power to anyone?”Forearms resting on his thighs, fingers intertwined, he leaned toward her. “Wegive swords to soldiers, don’t we? The gifted have children who throughbirthright inherit deadly abilities. The men chosen to serve as soldiers are atleast subjected to some degree of scrutiny. The child is gifted with powerswithout qualification and in fact may grow up to use those powers to cause greatharm. Look at what Emperor Sulachan’s followers do with their abilities,abilities granted to them through no precondition except birth. They use theirpower to destroy innocent people.“On the other hand, the person chosen to be a Confessor and invested with suchpower would have to be the right person, a rational person, a rare person whocould be entrusted with such responsibility, as would the person entrusted topossess the key to the repositories of power. For the right person, either wouldbe a tool. For the wrong person, either could be a weapon of evil. It is themind behind that tool that matters.”She was beginning to understand why the council had originally refused hisrequest. “I heard that the attempt to create this Confessor is dangerous andthat it could even be fatal. You could very possibly kill a good person in theattempt to create a Confessor out of them.”He didn’t look in the least bit daunted by the charge. If anything, he lookedresolute.“Yes, that’s true. It’s profoundly dangerous magic we’re talking about here. Ibelieve I can do it, but I can’t be absolutely positive it will all work the wayI think it will. Such a thing has never been attempted before. Dear spirits, asfar as I know, such a thing has never been envisioned before. If I don’t haveevery last little bit of it right, it could all go terribly wrong in a heartbeatand the person could be killed. There is that risk.”He leaned toward her again, searching her eyes. “But what is the danger of nottrying? Despite all the efforts of our forces, towns and cities everywhere arebeing overrun. We are losing men by the thousands in battles. Yet the horde fromthe South continues to pour north, coming to destroy us all.“You yourself said that there is something going on in the Keep, that you aresearching for answers, that we are all in danger, that traitors are among us andvery possibly plotting our destruction. We need to find those responsible. Doyou think that the death of all our people is preferable to the risk to theperson chosen to become a Confessor?”Magda searched the depths of his hazel eyes, looking for some indication that hewas misguided, or deluded, or even mad. She saw none.She glanced to the graceful women he had carved from white marble. This was nota man who did anything without fully appreciating every angle of it.“I admit that you may have a point,” she finally said.Magda had never liked the idea of magic altering a person. This was nodifferent. It sounded horrific.She changed the subject back to what she had wanted to know in the beginning.“What about the other wizards who have died? The ones people say died because ofyou. You haven’t finished that part of the story.”The impassioned animation that had been so evident in his eyes when he had beentalking about the key and the Confessor extinguished like a campfire in adownpour. He looked miserable to have to return to the subject.Magda felt bad for bringing him back to something that was so obviously painfulfor him.But all their lives were at stake. She needed to be able to find the truth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51 “Well, the thing is, as I’ve explained and as I hope you can appreciate, withoutthe required formulas that are locked away in the Temple of the Winds, trying tomake this kind of magic function for even the simplest form of the key, muchless to create a Confessor, is impossible. More than that, though, we’re talkingabout very dangerous things, here, things that are not to be taken lightly.Without the needed components, the attempt is guaranteed to fail and very wellmight be fatal.”“I can grasp why it wouldn’t work without all the parts you say it needs, butwhy is even trying to make the key so risky?”With a grim expression, Merritt lifted his fist so that she could see the signetring he wore.On its raised center was a Grace.The design of the Grace was deeply engraved into the ring so that it could beused to make an impression in sealing wax. Magda remembered seeing thatparticular design of the Grace left in the sealing wax of documents Baraccus hadreceived.“Even as an ungifted person, you must be aware of the power involved in theGrace when it is used by the gifted.”She was. The Grace represented the world of life, the world of the dead, and theway magic and Creation linked them.The outer circle of the design represented the beginning of the infinite worldof the dead. Inside that outer circle was a square, its points just touching theouter circle. Inside the square was another circle, just touching the insides ofthe square. The area between those two circles with the square represented theworld of life. The inside circle was life’s beginning while the outer circle itsend where souls crossed through the veil into the eternity of the underworld.An eight-pointed star inside the smaller circle was the Light of Creation. Linesfrom that star’s points radiated out across the inner circle, the square, andacross the outer circle that also symbolized the veil to the world of the dead.The lines radiating outward from the Light represented the spark of the giftthat journeyed with everyone from birth, through life, and on into death.Magda imagined that those rays, those conduits of the gift, were what enabledIsidore, the living, gifted spiritist, to be able to connect with the spiritworld beyond the veil.The gifted drew the Grace when conjuring powerful spells in order to invokespecific forces. It added elements that nothing else could, but at the same timeit was a dangerous tool and had to be treated with great respect.A Grace was properly drawn from the outside toward the center—circle, square,circle, star—and then the rays back out across those elements. Everything inwardand then back out. Drawing it improperly or in an improper sequence, when itcounted, could cause magic to fail or even go terribly wrong.Drawn in blood, a Grace could invoke alchemy of consequence.It was said that a person with enough knowledge and power could alter the Graceand thus alter elements of it.Though a Grace was a commonly used tool of the gifted, Baraccus had often saidthat, despite its seeming simplicity, it was rarely mastered.Not many people would dare to wear a Grace. That alone said something importantabout his abilities.Merritt stared down at his ring, burnishing the design of the Grace with thethumb of his other hand. He seemed lost in thought.Magda touched his wrist, making him look up.“You were saying?”His eyes focused again on her face. “I was saying that the spell-forms in playto create a key are dangerously unstable in such combinations without the linksfrom the rift calculations. You need those links to make the structure rigid.Only in that way can the various parts then fuse in the proper sequence. Thecouncil wanted us to try anyway. They wanted the key completed.”“What happens if you don’t have those elements? What happens if you try itwithout them?”“Without those rift and breach connectors you can’t stabilize the verificationweb and hold the spell-form together. Without them, there is nothing to bracethe various elements against, and those particular elements happen to involveboth Additive and Subtractive Magic. As you can imagine, letting the two touchin the wrong way, much less combine, is highly reactive.“Almost as soon as you bring the structure up in a verification web, with thoseopposing elements both so openly contained within the formation, and before youcan begin to activate the generation process, it begins to collapse in onitself. The Additive and Subtractive components attract each other as itimplodes, accelerating the reaction. Anyone nearby trying to hold it together inorder to bind and fuse the components into the key would be seriously injured orkilled.“It doesn’t matter how you try to construct the web, or what different routinesor sequence you use. Without all the parts needed to complete it, there is nochance that it might work. None. As far as I’m concerned, it’s insanity foranyone to think that you can put those particular Additive and the Subtractivecomponents together in that way without the necessary bridging elements andexpect them to coexist. The attempt is not merely pointless, it’s suicide.”“Wouldn’t others realize that?”“Some do, but when people want something bad enough they tend to fixate on theprize and ignore the dangers. The first attempt went as I had predicted and mendied. Some people saw the risk as the price of the prize and wanted to be theone to prove themselves better than anyone else. They think they will gain glorybeing the one to make it work. Yet more men died in subsequent attempts.”“But you do that same kind of thing,” she said. “You’re a maker. You don’taccept that something can’t be done. You figure out how to do things that aresaid to be impossible. So how can you fault them for wanting to make theirattempts?”“The things I do that have never been done before are different. I study theproblem and rationally analyze if it is really possible. Then and only then Iwork on how to do it. I develop a plan based on facts, not wishes. I know eachstep, each element’s nature, and I know where the lines are. To an outsideobserver it may seem that I’m attempting impossible things, but that’s not thecase.”He gestured across the room toward a statue. “It’s like carving. Before you makea cut you know why, you know what to cut away. That’s not what they’re doing inthis case. They are trying to carve, as it were, by hacking away without knowingwhat they’re doing. They’re substituting wishing for knowing.“Some of the men, I know, understood the dangers involved and were worried aboutattempting to make this key. But the council insisted. Even in the face ofdeaths, they insisted that the effort to craft this sword continue. They’ve putall their hopes into wishing it to work. I refused to be a part of it.”Magda frowned. “I don’t understand something. Is it a secret that the chestscontaining this power are locked away in the Temple of the Winds and no one canget to them?”“No. Everyone involved in the attempt to make the key knows it. The chests werelisted on the Temple team’s manifest.”“Then why is the council so insistent that the key be made when they know thatthere is no use for it?”Merritt lifted his hands in a gesture of frustration. “Exactly. I made the sameargument. They didn’t want to hear it. Elder Cadell offered that it was a safetymeasure should the power ever be returned to the world of life. He said that wecouldn’t wait for something to go wrong and only then find out that we areunprepared to deal with it.”“Elder Cadell said that?”“That’s right. The council wanted me to lead the team that was to make the key.I agree with their motive, but that doesn’t mean it can be done. When I toldthem that it was impossible and would only get people killed, they became angry.They questioned my loyalty to the cause of the Midlands.“They said that if I refused to help them and anyone was killed, it would be myfault. They thought that by putting me into such a position I would have to goalong, and if I went along, then I would somehow find a way to make it work.”“They apparently have a great deal of faith in your ability as a maker,” Magdasaid.Merritt could sit no longer. He went to the table again, where he leaned on hishands as he stared down at the sword lying on red velvet. As Magda watched him,waiting for him to go on, his fingers lightly tracked the length of the blade’sfuller.“It’s as if they want us to be able to fly,” he finally said, “and so theycommand people to leap off a cliff, flap their arms, and fly, thinking thatbecause they have commanded it to work, it will.“But then when those people plummet to their death, I’m the one blamed becauseI’m the one who told them the truth that it wouldn’t work.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52 “So you refused to lead them and they went ahead with the attempt anyway,” Magdasaid when he had been silent for a time. “Then what happened?”“What do you think happened? A lot of good men died for nothing, that’s whathappened.”“I see.”She remembered all too well the man down in the lower portion of the Keep, lyingsprawled on the floor dead, with a large fragment of a blade jutting from hischest.“Do you?” He shook his head without looking back. “You say that you thinkBaraccus died for something worthwhile, so you at least have that consolation.These men died for nothing. What consolation is there for those they leavebehind?“Do you know what it’s like to face the widows of such men? Men whose lives werewasted? Can you imagine the grief of those women, knowing that their husbandsare dead, hearing that I’m responsible, hearing that I could have prevented ithad I not been ‘selfish’ and instead helped them? Can you imagine what it’s liketo hear their children, children I’ve given rides on my shoulders, crying forfathers they will never see again?“Can you imagine what it’s like to have the widows, mothers, sisters, anddaughters of men who died lie at your door all night, wailing inconsolably,blaming you for the death of their loved one?”“No, I can’t imagine it,” Magda said into the stillness.She felt shame for being one of those who had so easily thought him guilty ofthe charge merely because she had heard it made. She had formed an opinion ofhim without ever meeting him. She felt a fool for so willingly embracing lies.“How could I convince people in such pain that I tried to prevent such needlessdeaths? They wouldn’t listen. They wouldn’t hear it. They believed the council’sword that had I helped it wouldn’t have happened. It’s easier for the familiesto blame me than to try to grasp the complexities of the issue. They can’tunderstand that even if I had stayed and led the effort their men would be justas dead and me along with them. Easier for them to embrace lies than the truth.”Magda could hear children running up the street, playing a game as their barkingdog bounded after them. She could only imagine the anguish of children very muchlike them losing a father. When they finally receded into the distance, the pallof silence again settled over the small, cluttered home.“That’s why you moved away from the Keep,” Magda said aloud as the realizationcame to her.His back still to her, he nodded. “That’s why.”She could see how much it hurt him to be put in such an impossible situation andso unfairly blamed. She understood why Baraccus had said that he wished he couldhave helped Merritt.Magda rose and crossed the room to lay a comforting hand on the back of hisbroad shoulder. She finally understood the depth of the compassion Isidore sawin him.“Thank you, Merritt, for explaining it to me. I understand, now. I’m greatlyrelieved that what people say isn’t true, but at the same time I’m ashamed thatI blindly believed that you were to blame for those deaths.”He nodded his appreciation as he lightly touched the blade of the sword. “A lotof good people have died for nothing. I’m afraid that a lot more good men aregoing to die before they finally give up the attempt as impossible.”Standing beside him as he turned toward her, she saw then for the first time afull view of the magnificent sword lying on the red velvet. The fuller ran thelength of a gleaming blade that flared beneath side notches near the top. Anaggressive, down-swept cross guard tapered to sharp points. The hilt was coveredin tightly wound, perfectly twisted, fine silver wire.Gold wire woven through the silver spelled out the word Truth.The beauty of the sword nearly took her breath.Almost involuntarily, she reached out and touched the hilt, her fingers trailingover the word Truth standing out in gold. She’d never seen such a thing donebefore.Merritt watched her for a moment; then, as he lifted the sword, her fingersfinally, reluctantly, came off the word Truth. He laid the blade over hisforearm and offered her the hilt.Magda couldn’t resist letting her fingers close around it. As she gripped thehilt, lifting the weapon, she could feel the raised letters of the word Truthwith her fingertips on one side, and the woven wire letters of the word Truth onthe other side of the hilt pressing into her palm.She knew a thing or two about using a sword, but she was by no means expert withone, as she was with knives. This sword felt magical in her hand. Its weight andbalance were extraordinary. It felt light, swift, and remarkably right.It also stirred something deep within her, called something forth in a way thatshe hadn’t expected and didn’t quite understand.The only way she could interpret it was that it felt rather like righteous angerboiling just beneath the surface of her awareness, wanting release.“This is meant to be the key,” she whispered half to herself.He was still watching her eyes. “Indeed it is, but as I’ve explained, I can’tcomplete it.”“It all makes sense, now,” she said, still speaking to herself as much as tohim. “I understand what you meant about the magic of the key serving truth andat the same time protecting the power.”“The power needs truth to work. Truth is reality, the laws of nature. They’reinseparable. That relationship is represented by the word woven into the hilt.That makes this a sword meant to serve more than just the power. It is alsomeant to serve truth.”She at last looked up into his eyes as the realization came to her.“This is the Sword of Truth.”A warm smile softened his expression. “That’s a good name for it. In fact, it’sperfect. I don’t know why I never thought of it myself. More than you realize,this sword serves truth on many levels and in many ways. I’ve always meant forthe one who wields this sword to be a seeker of truth.“Thank you, Magda, for the clarity.” He gestured to the sword in her hand. “Fromnow on, it will always be known as the Sword of Truth.”Magda lifted the blade upright, letting her eyes take in its graceful lines. Itsfuller added not only lightness, which made it faster, but at the same timeadded strength to the blade. It was at once exquisite and deadly. Below thecross guard, the wire-wound hilt felt at home in her hand.“Where did you ever get something this magnificent?”His smile widened. “I made it.”She again lifted the sword in astonishment, watching the light flare along thelength of the blade.“You made this?”Merritt nodded. “While any would serve the purpose, this is the sword I madewith the intent that it be the key. It has always been the sword I intended toinvest with the power.”“I feel . . . something. I can feel something stirring as I hold it.”By his reaction, he was not at all surprised. “Like I explained before, we areall born with a spark of the gift. Though you are not gifted, as such, you stillrespond to magic. This sword is invested with magic. That is what you feel.”Magda frowned. “What sort of magic?”“In addition to preparing it to become the key, I also gave it abilities to helpin its service to protect the power as well as to serve truth. Those are theelements you feel.” His smile ghosted away. “But that was before I knew thatwhat I needed to complete it isn’t in this world any longer. I won’t let othersuse this sword to try to make the key because such a fruitless attempt woulddestroy it. At least the power is safe.”Magda finally handed Merritt the sword. As his fist closed around the hilt,around the words Truth on either side, she closed both her hands around his,holding them tightly.They were close as she searched his eyes.“Answer a question for me?”He shrugged, making no attempt to take the sword and his hand from under hers.“What do you want to know?”“How many chests contain the power, the power that the Sword of Truth you holdis meant to protect?”He seemed reluctant, but finally answered.“Three.”Magda felt a tear well up and run down her cheek.“The three boxes of Orden.”Something more than the gift alone shone in his eyes. “That’s what the power wascalled before the star shift. How is it that you know that name? The name Ordenis only used in the most ancient of sources. How is it that you know it?”How could she tell him?How could she not?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53 “Merritt, I have to tell you something.”Concern creased his features. “What is it?”Magda cleared her throat, hoping that her voice wouldn’t fail her.“When Baraccus returned from the Temple of the Winds, returned from theunderworld, I was there in the First Wizard’s enclave waiting for him. I was ofcourse happy to see him, and he was happy to return safely to me. But he wasstrangely quiet. I asked him what it was that so troubled him.“Baraccus told me that a great power, a very dangerous power, was no longer inthe Temple of the Winds where it belonged. He said that it was supposed to bethere, but it was gone. I asked him what he was talking about. He said that thethree boxes of Orden were missing.”Merritt’s face went ashen. “Missing?”“He said that much was not right in the Temple of the Winds. When I asked whathe meant, he just stared off and was quiet for a time. He finally told me aboutthe boxes of Orden, and how important they were. I asked if he was certain theywere gone. He said that the Temple of the Winds was a big place, but there wasno doubt that the boxes were no longer there.”“Who else has he told about the boxes being gone?”“He said that he could tell no one but me.”“The council doesn’t know?”“No. I’m the only one who knows. And now you. I was waiting for the new FirstWizard to be named. I had planned to tell him once he is named.”One of her hands came off his holding the sword so that she could grasp hismuscular arm to urge his gaze back to her eyes.“But I realize now that you are the one who needs to know, Merritt. You are theone I needed to tell.”His face still hadn’t regained its color. His gaze again drifted away to focusinto distant thoughts. She couldn’t imagine what he, having worked so long tocreate the protective key for the boxes of Orden, must be thinking.“Thank you, Magda, for telling me. For trusting me.”She nodded as her other hand finally slipped away from his on the sword.His expression abruptly turned expectant. “Did Baraccus say anything about therift calculations for creating a seventh-level breach? Maybe he brought themback with him.”Magda shook her head. “I’m sorry, no. He didn’t say anything at all about that.”His momentary eagerness faded, to be replaced by suspicion. “And the councildoesn’t know about this? You’re certain they don’t know?”“Yes, I’m certain. Baraccus said that he could tell no one but me. I don’t knowwhy, but he was clear about it. He wouldn’t have said such a thing unless hemeant it.”“It makes no sense. How could the boxes of Orden not be in the Temple of theWinds?” Merritt stared off again. “I wonder if maybe someone else could go thereto retrieve the formulas. I wonder if I could try it. I don’t know how, but if Icould—”“No,” Magda said with an emphatic shake of her head. “Baraccus told me thatthere was much wrong at the Temple. He said that it would be thousands of yearsbefore anyone again set foot there.”“That sounds ominous. I wonder why he said that?”“I don’t know, but if Baraccus said it he must have known what he was talkingabout. That means that you or anyone else wouldn’t be able to get in.”Merritt thought for a moment. “The Temple was supposed to be brought back tothis world after the war is over and it’s safe again here.”Magda looked up at him from under her brow. “Baraccus was a war wizard. Part ofthat was his ability for prophecy. Maybe he meant that it wouldn’t be safe inthis world for thousands of years, and so it will have to remain banished.”“That’s a grim thought.”“Maybe it’s because of the other thing he said, though, that there is somethingseriously wrong there. Maybe it’s not because of what’s happening here in thisworld that it can’t return, but because of the trouble there.”“I suppose that could be,” Merritt said, deep in thought.“That means that those things you need are never going to be within your reach.”Merritt’s shoulders sagged in frustration.“That still doesn’t explain anything about what happened to the boxes of Orden.If they aren’t there, then they have to be here, in this world.”“It would seem so,” she agreed.“The Temple team put the boxes there, in the Temple,” he said as he reasoned itthrough out loud. “Lothain tried to get into the Temple to fix what the Templeteam had sabotaged, but he couldn’t get in. Then, when Lothain’s attempt toenter the Temple failed, Baraccus sent some of his best men to try to get in tofind out what the Temple team had done. When none of them returned, he finallywent there himself. He confirmed the trouble there.”“That’s right,” Magda said.He gestured with the sword. “That would seem to indicate that the boxes of Ordenwere never actually placed in the Temple in the first place. That must have beenpart of the team’s treachery.”“There has to be more to it that that.”“What do you mean?” he asked.“If the boxes were never there, and no one else got in, then why did the Templeof the Winds turn the moon red in warning that something had gone terribly wrongthere long after the Temple team had been tried and executed for treason?Something made the moon turn red in warning. Baraccus sent wizards who failed toreturn and then went himself to answer the Temple’s call for help and find outwhat was wrong. Something had to have happened that made the moon turn red.”“I can’t imagine what. Did Baraccus give any hint?”Magda’s gaze dropped. “He killed himself before I had a chance to really talk tohim about it.” She looked back up at Merritt. “Maybe the boxes really were therein the temple all along, right where they belonged. Maybe someone else got inand took them, and that’s why the moon turned red.”Merritt looked disturbed by the thought. “Someone else? Like who? You mean theenemy?”Magda shrugged. “I don’t know. But maybe someone got in and stole the boxes ofOrden and caused the other trouble that Baraccus spoke of. Maybe that’s why themoon turned red.”Merritt ran a thumb along his jaw as he considered. “I suppose that’s possible.”“Maybe it was the enemy. Someone Emperor Sulachan sent.”Merritt looked over at her. “That’s a troubling thought.”“Besides that troubling thought, as I told you, there are a number of troublingthings going on at the Keep. I heard rumors of some of our wizards bringing thedead back to life. Do you know anything about such efforts?”“I’ve heard that they’re working to try to learn about the weapons Sulachan hasdeveloped,” he said. “I think that Isidore was helping with just that sort ofthing. She was dealing with matters from the spirit world.”“Other strange things are going on. Enemy forces are harvesting the dead. Theytook all the dead from Isidore’s town of Grandengart. Reports I’ve heard saythat they’ve taken bodies from other places as well, and from battlefields. Whywould they do such a thing?”Merritt heaved a sigh. “I don’t know.”Magda went to the wicker couch and retrieved the bundle she had brought along.“Take a look at this.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54 Magda unfurled the wispy cloth bundle and held it up so he could see it the wayit had looked when it had hung in the maze of hallways outside Isidore’s place.Merritt set the sword back down on the red velvet and crossed the room, drawn bywhat he was seeing. She could make out his silhouette through the silky cloth ashe ran his fingers over the spell-forms drawn on it.“This is remarkable,” he whispered.“I certainly think so. It saved my life.”Merritt pulled the edge of the cloth aside to peer at her. “What do you mean?”“The monster who killed Isidore came after me. He was no less intent on killingme than he had been on killing Isidore. He chased me through your maze. I waslost and trying my best to stay out of his reach. He finally trapped me in adead end behind this cloth, but he couldn’t pass it to get at me. This clothsomehow stopped him.”Merritt lifted the side of the cloth out so that he could examine all thesymbols crudely painted on it.“I can see why,” he said as he studied the symbols.“Isidore told me that the spells she drew were derived from her work as aspiritist, and that they were both powerful and significant.”He was still studying the drawings on the cloth. “There is no doubt of that.” Heshook his head as his gaze wandered from one symbol to another. “I taught herthe basics of these spell-forms, but she has added some very peculiar elementsto them.”“Isidore told me that the dead must heed them.”Merritt glanced her way but didn’t say anything, so she did. “I can testify tothe truth of what she said.” Magda joggled the cloth. “This is what stopped thatmonster, that dead man, from getting at me. He wouldn’t go past it. Isidore saidthat the dead must heed the things she drew. That’s another reason that Ibelieve that this man who killed her and was trying to kill me was actuallydead. He heeded this warning.”Merritt glanced her way. “That might be true, but it’s not necessarily thecase.” He took the cloth, draping it over an arm as he paced across the room,pulling folds aside one at a time as he considered the symbols lying across hisarm.“This is very disturbing, though,” he muttered. “These are keeper spells, meantto ward the dead.”“Keeper spells? Merritt, why was Isidore worried about dead people? Why did shehave these keeper spells drawn on hangings in the hallways around her thatstopped the dead?”He looked back at her a moment. “Perhaps because she had reason to fear them, orperhaps it was only a precaution. She was dealing with the world of the deadafter all. That was her profession. Besides that, she was searching for spiritsthat are trapped in this world. Those spirits belong to the corpses that GeneralKuno took from Grandengart.”“But those are spirits of the dead. Not the dead themselves.”“What are you getting at?”“What if what I’ve heard is true, and some of those wizards down there reallyare able to bring the dead back to life, or not really life, but, well, you knowwhat I mean. What if they are creating monsters out of dead people? Mindlessslaves to do their bidding?”Merritt arched an eyebrow as he handed her back the silky cloth. “I have learnednot to dismiss things that sound preposterous, but do you really believe that?”She took the cloth from him and folded it back up. “I don’t know what Ibelieve.” She lifted the bundle. “But I sleep under this.”She thought he might laugh at her. He didn’t.“Good girl,” he murmured as he turned away in thought.“Merritt, there are too many things happening that make no sense. I fear thatsomething terrible is going to happen before I can figure it out, and no one butme seems to care.”“I care,” he said quietly.She was momentarily caught off guard. She hadn’t expected him to say that. Itwas what she had hoped for, more than she had hoped for, in fact. It was why shehad come to see him in the first place. But she hadn’t expected it.“Thank you,” she whispered.“You’re right that there are too many unexplained things happening. Not only thethings you mention, but others as well. In isolation, they each might seeminnocent enough, or might be able to be explained away, but when you considerthe larger picture, those things together become suspect.”“Do you know anyone who could help us get answers?”He ran his hand back and forth along a curved iron piece of a strange, complexmetal composition as he considered. It almost looked like a sculpturalrepresentation of verification webs she had seen before.“I might,” he finally said.Encouraged, Magda stepped closer. “I’m listening.”He turned to face her. “Do you know about the defector?”“Defector? No. What defector? What are you talking about?”“Just within the last day or two, a sorceress from the Old World, a woman who itis rumored was close to Emperor Sulachan, arrived in the Keep seeking refuge. Iheard that she told people she wanted to join our cause. If that’s true, shemight know something about the enemy’s plans. We know precious little about whatis going on under Sulachan’s rule.”“I never heard of her,” Magda said. “You’re right, we definitely should talk toher. Do you know where we can find her?”“In the dungeon.”“The dungeon?” Magda frowned. “If she defected and wants to join our cause, whyis she in the dungeon?”“I heard whispers that she was tried and convicted of being a spy, and that sheis going to be executed.”Magda gaped at him. “I never heard about any such trial.”He lifted his brow. “Why should you? You’re a nobody, remember?”Magda’s mouth twisted. “Before Baraccus died I used to know a lot more about thegoings-on at the Keep than I do now.” She folded her arms. “We need to go seeher, find out if she can tell us anything.”“I already tried. They wouldn’t let me talk to her.”“There have to be some people around who would be willing to help.” As sheconsidered the problem, Magda went to the table where the Sword of Truth lay,gazing down at it. “Lord Rahl told me that some of the officers had given thedevotion to him.”“Do you know which ones?”“Officers Rendall and Morgan have,” she said. “I trust them. Either would helpme.”“They’re both with their troops, somewhere outside of Aydindril.”“General Grundwall of the Home Guard swore the oath as well,” she said. “I knowhim, although not well. He often came to Baraccus with reports.”Merritt nodded as he considered. “I’ve only met him once or twice, butcommanding the Home Guard he could certainly get in to see a prisoner.” Heglanced her way. “Do you know him well enough for him to get me in there to seethis sorceress?”“I think I know him well enough for him to get me in there. I might be able toconvince him to let you come along.”He smiled briefly. It quickly faded. “Let’s hope they haven’t beheaded heralready, and that she would be willing to talk to us.”“We should do that first, then. Do you know anyone else you can trust?”Merritt rubbed his jaw as he thought it over. “I know lots of trustworthy peoplebut most haven’t sworn the oath to Lord Rahl, so as trustworthy as they mightordinarily be, we can’t trust that a dream walker isn’t watching through theireyes. A lot of people don’t take the threat seriously. That creates anopportunity the enemy can take advantage of.”“Then we dare not take a chance with any of them.”“I do know one person I trust, and he has sworn the oath.”“Who’s that?” she asked.“He’s assigned to guard the sliph. I trust him, and I know that he’s one of thegifted who believed in Baraccus. Since he is usually with the sliph, he sees alot of important people coming and going. He also knows a great deal about thewizards at the Keep, who’s doing what, that sort of thing.”“You mean Quinn?”Merritt’s brow furrowed. “You know Quinn?”Magda smiled. “I grew up with him. When I was younger, I would sometimes go forwalks with him in the forests around Aydindril out to an isolated pond that washome to loons.”“You were sweet on him?”Magda could feel herself blushing. “No, nothing like that. I liked him, but wewere just children. He was a couple years older, though, and that alone made himseem quite impressive. But Quinn was more interested in his journals.”“Ah yes, Quinn’s journals. You certainly do know him, then.”“He pored through books all the time. He loved to study the past. He used totell me that history shaped people’s beliefs, and that one day he was going tobe the Keep’s historian and write about all the goings-on.”“He seems to be well on his way,” Merritt said as he lifted the baldric off thechair and slipped it over his head. He placed it over his right shoulder withthe scabbard at his left hip. “He has quite the collection of journals that hekeeps down there with him as he guards the sliph.”“It keeps him busy,” Magda said. “It’s probably pretty boring being down theremost of the time.”Merritt picked up the sword and slid it into the beautifully tooled silver andgold scabbard at his left hip.“Let’s go see if you can convince General Grundwall to take us down to thedungeon.”“You take the Sword of Truth with you often?”“I never let it out of my sight. It already has certain conjured elements lockedinto it in preparation for the final process. I guess that’s not to be now, buteven with the powers it has, it’s still a dangerous weapon. I wouldn’t want itto fall into the wrong hands.”She supposed it made sense. Magda scooped the folded bundle off the wickercouch, tucking it under an arm.On her way past the bookshelf, she paused, pointing at the tiny clay figures ofpeople floating in the air just off the end of a small scroll sticking out fromthe shelf.“Merritt, do you mind me asking what in the world this is?”Merritt pulled the scroll off the shelf. The little figures floated alongthrough the air, staying close to it.“I call it a gravity well.”Smiling at the little figures hovering in the air, she turned back to him. “Awhat?”“If you toss something in the air, it falls to the ground. In a way, we’re alllike these little figures, pulled to the ground by gravity.”He unfurled the scroll to show her that it had a spell-form drawn on it. She wasa bit alarmed to see that part of the spell-form was made up of an alteredGrace.“You created gravity in a spell?”“Not exactly. I created a spell that attracts specific things. I guess you couldsay that it only mimics gravity. In this case, I had it attract these clayfigures, so they always are compelled to stay near the spell-form, like we muststay on the ground because of gravity. So, I call it a gravity well.”“What’s it for?” She puzzled at the paper and its clay people drawn to it. “Whatis its purpose?”Merritt shrugged. “Nothing, really. It’s just something I came up with while Iwas working on something else more important. I’ve never thought of a use forit, so I guess that it’s just for my amusement.”He folded the scroll up small enough to fit in his hand. The figures floatedclose. He took her hand and placed the small, folded paper in her palm.“Here. A gift for you to make you smile.”Magda held the folded paper out in the palm of her hand, watching the small clayfigures float around it. “Really? I can have this?”“Sure, if you promise to smile that lovely smile you have when you look at it.”She couldn’t help smiling. “I promise,” she said as she gathered up the figuresin her hand and put it all into her pocket.With two fingers on the cross guard, he lifted the sword a few inches and let itdrop back into place, making sure it was clear in its scabbard.“Now, shall we see if we can go talk to this defector before they behead her?”Magda nodded and hurried to follow after him.For the first time since Baraccus died, Magda didn’t feel totally alone. She hadsomeone who believed her, who took her seriously, someone who was going to helpher."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55 On the stone bridge that spanned the vast chasm before the Keep, two womencrossing, near the short stone wall on the opposite side, spotted Merritt andmomentarily froze in their tracks. Both were in long gray dresses and both hadshort hair. One was a couple of years older than Magda, while the other appearedold enough to be the first woman’s mother. Magda saw blood on the youngerwoman’s dress. Both threaded their way through the throngs coming and going fromthe Keep to intercept Merritt.“Mary, what’s the matter,” Merritt asked the younger of the two as she grabbedone of his hands. The older woman stood behind, expectantly wringing her ownhands.The younger woman’s face was tearstained and she was in obvious distress. “It’sJames—he’s been hurt. Hurt bad.”“Hurt?” Merritt asked, clearly alarmed. “How? What happened? How badly is hehurt?”“He was working on an assignment from the council to make a sword of some sort.”She had to pause to choke back a sob. “James never talked much about the work hedoes, so I don’t know a great deal about it. But earlier this afternoon therewas some kind of an accident down in the lower regions. Three of the men withhim were killed outright by a massive explosion. Two others standing fartherback were hurt but not seriously. James is in a bad way, though. He was closerand breathed in the inferno. They say it burned his lungs. He can’t breathe.He’s hurt bad, Merritt.”As she fell against him, sobbing, she clutched his black shirt in both fists.“What will I do if he dies, Merritt? What will I do?”“It had something to do with magic gone wrong,” the older woman added when thefirst succumbed to her tears, hoping that somehow the information might helphim.Merritt cast Magda a look as he circled an arm around Mary’s shoulders. His bighand gently held the woman’s head to his chest as she wept.Magda knew what the look meant. Yet more men had just died and others had beenhurt in a futile attempt to make the key to the boxes of Orden.“Are they healing him?” Merritt asked. “Are there gifted working to heal him?”“No. He wouldn’t let them,” Mary sobbed, barely getting the words out.“What? Why not?”The older woman placed a hand on his forearm. “James is asking for you,Merritt.”“But why? Why won’t he let the gifted help him?”“Apparently, he believes that you are the only one who knows enough about whatthey were doing, what elements are involved, to have a chance to heal him. Thewizards with him are trying to keep him alive until you could be found, but theytold me that they don’t know enough to heal him and they need you. It’s onlychance that Mary and I spotted you on our way down to the city to look for you.Hurry. Please.”Merritt, with one arm around the younger woman, holding her as she cried againsthis chest, put his other hand on the older woman’s shoulder.“Of course.”He turned to Magda, concern shaping his features. “I need to help James. Waitfor me?”Magda nodded. “Hurry. Help him.”Magda put a hand on Mary’s back. She knew what it was like to fear for a lovedone. She knew the terror of it. She was getting tears herself at the sight ofMary’s distress. At least this woman was not yet grieving her husband’s death.Magda hoped that Merritt could prevent that from happening.“Try to be brave,” Magda said. “Merritt will help. Your husband will need to seeyou being strong for him.”The woman nodded as she reached out to squeeze Magda’s other hand. “I’ll try.”“Where will I find you?” he asked in a private tone.“I’ll either be in my apartments,” Magda said, “or in the storage room next doorgetting my things ready to move so the new First Wizard can have the space.”“Wait for me, then, and I will come get you as soon as I help James.”His hazel eyes looked even more green in the late-day light, and they spoke morethan mere words. He knew how important their business was, but at the same timehe couldn’t let a man barely clinging to life die if there was anything thatcould be done to save him.Merritt reached out and briefly touched Magda’s cheek, then let the two womenlead him away in a rush.Magda stood in the center of the massive stone bridge, still feeling the touchof his fingers on her cheek as she watched the three of them cross the bridgeand race toward the gaping iron maw of the portcullis. It had been a small butrather remarkable gesture, she thought, as if to say that he understood thetrouble they were in and to hold tight until he was back.Magda knew that healing a seriously injured person could take quite a while. Ifeverything went right, it could sometimes be done in a matter of hours, but itcould also just as easily take days.The man, James, was apparently a friend. He needed Merritt’s help or he wouldcertainly die. Merritt of course had to go help, to try to heal him. Magda wouldexpect no less of Merritt.But Magda didn’t think the rest of them had days to wait.The boxes of Orden were missing, dream walkers were haunting the Keep, traitorswere among them, people were dying mysteriously, and dead men hunted among thedark passageways.Magda knew that no one else but Merritt even believed her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56 As a jumble of thoughts fought for her attention, Magda gazed out over the stonewall at the side of the bridge and down into the vast chasm. The split in themountain spanned by the stone bridge dropped nearly all the way to the veryfloor of the valley. Clouds frequently drifted by below the bridge, but not thisday. This day a humid haze dimmed the details far below. A flock of birds passedbeneath the arch of the bridge, and far below them trees clung in places tosmall ledges in the cliff. Far down at the bottom she could just make outboulders.The boulders reminded her of the ones below the cliff where Baraccus had jumpedto his death, and she almost had. At that thought she had to turn away from thedizzying drop.The dark, soaring stone walls of the Keep caught the last warm rays of thesetting sun. The humid air had gone dead still as the day neared its end.Magda stood gazing out at the blue haze of mountains in the distance across theother side of the bridge, unsure what to do, unsure how long she dared wait forMerritt before she had to go without him down to the dungeon to look for theenemy sorceress. Someone coming across the bridge caught her eye.It was Councilman Sadler. He looked grim as he strode resolutely across thebridge, head bent, watching the ground before him as if in a daze.Magda stepped out and gently caught him by the arm. “Councilman Sadler, goodafternoon.”His arm a captive in her grip, he looked up.“Magda.” He blinked at being so suddenly jarred from his thoughts. “Goodafternoon.”As he started away, Magda held on to his arm, pulling him to a stop again andkeeping him from leaving.“What’s wrong?” she asked.He scowled unhappily. “Am I that obvious?”“No, not at all. Just a feeling I had when I saw you. Is there anything I can dofor you?”He peered at her a moment, his clear eyes behind drooping lids finally lookedaway from her before he spoke.“The council has made some decisions,” he said. “You caught me thinking over thematter.”“And you don’t like what was decided?”“I can’t say that I’m entirely in agreement with their determinations.”It was uncharacteristic for him to voice such personal feelings about mattersdecided by the council. He was usually quite stoic. With thoughts of all thetrouble at the Keep still in her head, she decided not to let the matter go.“May I ask what they have decided that troubles you?”He pressed his lips tight for a moment, thinking it over, but then he finallyrelented.“People will know soon enough. Won’t be a secret for long.”“Have they named a First Wizard?” She guessed. “Is that it?”He straightened and studied her face before finally letting out a sigh. He gazedoff at the city far down in the valley.“Yes. And more.”Puzzled, Magda was not about to let the matter go without more details. “I don’tknow what you mean. What more?”He came out of his private thoughts and glanced around to see if anyone wasclose, then took her arm and led her over to the stone wall edging the bridge.Women carrying bundles hurried past on their way back from markets in Aydindril.Men walked before carts pulled by mules or rode in wagons piled high withsupplies of every sort, from firewood to barrels of salted fish.A double column of soldiers coming from the Keep rode past on big black horses.Their breastplates reflected the amber glow of the late-day light. Chain mailand armor jangled as the horses trotted past. People scurried out of their way.All the equally big men carried lances at a perfect upright angle. These heavilyarmed men, called the Black Lancers, were some of the most lethal soldiers inthe Home Guard. Besides wearing black tunics beneath their armor and chain mail,they also proclaimed their identity with long black pennants as well as theirbeautiful black horses.Sadler watched the Black Lancers gallop away once they reached the far side ofthe bridge. He waited until all the nearby people continued on their way again,waited until the two of them stood apart from everyone crossing the bridge.“You’re a good woman, Magda. Always fair and always well reasoned. So, I’ll tellyou before you hear it elsewhere tomorrow.”Magda tilted her head toward him so as not to miss his quiet words. “What is it,Councilman Sadler.”“Lothain has been named First Wizard.”Magda’s mouth hung open. It was a moment before she finally found her voice.“Lothain? Head Prosecutor Lothain? That Lothain? He has been named First Wizard?Are you serious?”“Quite serious.” Sadler’s expression was grim. “His installation will be heldsoon—within a matter of a few days, I would expect, although I’ve not beeninformed of exactly when. With pressing matters of the war, the council wants toforgo the usual large, public event such as when Baraccus was named. They wantit to be somewhat smaller than is customary in order to hurry arrangements alongso he can get on with the business of First Wizard.”Magda was too stunned to know what to say.“That’s not all,” Sadler added. He gestured down the mountain. “I’m moving downto my cottage in the woods. No need for me to live at the Keep any longer.”“But the council . . .”His eyes, still as sharp as ever, flashed her way. “I won’t be sitting on thecouncil.”Magda blinked. “What do you mean?”He looked suddenly uncomfortable, even embarrassed. “I have been dismissed.”Magda had to run the word through her mind again to be sure she had heard itcorrectly. “Dismissed? You can’t be dismissed. Unless of course you have beenconvicted of—”“No, no, nothing like that,” he said as he waved with a gesture to indicate thatshe had gotten the wrong idea.“Then what do you mean you’ve been dismissed? How can you be dismissed? Bywhom?”“Lothain.”Magda stared a moment before again having to remind herself to close her mouth.“I don’t understand.”He grimaced a little as he looked away from her. “Lothain suggested, and therest of the council agreed, that changes needed to be made so that decisions insuch difficult times could be more easily reached. With six members on thecouncil, we were often deadlocked.”“But it’s supposed to be that way so that a majority can’t run roughshod anddictate. Six members is meant to be more deliberative, meant to promote ameasured pace in the council working toward the truth. It prevents rashdecisions.”He gestured with a flick of his hand, as if he agreed with her, but could donothing about it.“It was thought that in wartime, with problems such as we now face, what thecouncil needs most is the ability to reach swift rulings. Five members givesthem that ability. Three members in agreement is all it now takes to pass aproposal.”Magda didn’t know what to say. She had known Sadler for a long time. She hadbrought matters before him for several years. He hadn’t always agreed with her,but unlike some of the others he had always listened with an open mind.She reached out and laid a hand on his forearm. “I’m so sorry. Are you going tobe all right?”He again waved off her concern. “Don’t worry for me. I’ll be fine. I alwayswanted to spend more time in my quiet little cottage in the woods. Since my wifepassed . . . well, I guess that I could use some time to reflect. Worrying aboutmatters of war are probably too harsh a burden for me anymore. . . . At least,that was what the others said.”A slight breath of breeze pulled some of her short hair across her face. Magdapushed it back. “Can I come see you sometime?”He grinned and pinched her cheek, something he had never done before. It was anextraordinary gesture that stunned her.“I’d like that, Magda. I’d like that.”He seemed so much less reserved than, in her experience, he had always been. Hisweathered, wrinkled face looked tired. She thought it must be that he hadbelieved he had to present a measured and resolute façade appropriate to being acouncilman. Now that mask had faded away to reveal the man beneath it.As he started away, she watched him turning his back on the Keep, on a life’swork. He looked hunched and older to her than he ever had before. Magda suddenlythought of something and called out to him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57 Magda took a step away from the stone wall at the side of the bridge.“Councilman Sadler.”He stopped and turned. “It’s just Sol, now. I am no longer a councilman. I amjust Sol.”Magda smiled a sad smile. “I’m afraid that I could never in my life bring myselfto call you anything other than Councilman Sadler.”He accepted the sentiment with a slight smile and a nod. “If you wish. I guessmy ears are accustomed enough to the sound of it, and as long as we are alone Iguess that there is no one to object.”Magda glanced around to make sure that no one was close. Everyone looked to bemostly concerned with their own business and in a hurry to get where they weregoing before it got too dark. They didn’t pay the two of them undue attention,although people who did recognize him stared for a moment on their way past.Magda took another step, closing the distance to him so that there was no chancethat anyone could overhear them. She again glanced around.“Councilman Sadler, can you tell me anything about a woman, a sorceress from theOld World, who defected and came here to the Keep to join our cause?”He rubbed a hand back and forth across his mouth as he thought it over. Helifted a finger.“Yes, as a matter of fact I do recall, now, that Lothain mentioned somethingabout a woman coming over from the enemy side, claiming to want to change herloyalty. I think you’re right that she was a sorceress. He said that she was aspy, though. Could that be the woman you mean?”“Most likely. Do you know anything about her?”“I’m afraid not. I never met her. Why do you ask?”Magda didn’t want to say. A councilman, of all people, would certainly be aprime target for a dream walker. For all she knew there could be a dream walkerhiding in the shadows of his mind at that very moment, watching and listening toher every word. She had to be careful. She also had to think quickly. She lifteda hand in an casual gesture.“I was hoping that maybe she might be able to help in our war effort. If shereally did come from the Old World, I was hoping that maybe a woman like thatwould know something that could help us.”For the first time his expression turned suspicious. “You mean, like withinformation about the dream walkers, such as what tasks occupy their attention,and how far they’ve gotten?”Magda showed a brief, if insincere smile. “Well yes, that had crossed my mind,but I was thinking in a more general nature. We could use all the help we canget.”He nodded. “Sorry, but I can’t say. Not because I wouldn’t tell you, Magda, butbecause I don’t know anything.”“I see. Well, thank you anyway, Councilman Sadler.” She smiled again, butsincerely this time. “I’ll try to visit you, soon, and see how you’re gettingalong.”He smiled warmly in return. “I’d like that, Magda. I’d like that very much.”He took a step, but then paused and turned back to her. He laid a hand on hershoulder, his fingers tightening as he drew her a bit closer.“Of all the people who came before us, Magda, you were the only one who alwaysrepresented truth. I want you to know that.”She suddenly felt a bit guilty for being deceptive in her answer about thesorceress. But it was a pretense necessary to protect lives. The dream walkers,after all, could be anywhere.“I came before you to represent those who have no voice.”He smiled a sly smile as he let the hand drop. “No, not exactly. You did notspeak up for the deceitful, the covetous, the greedy who have no voice. Youspoke only on behalf of the innocent, or those of principle, who have no voice.You came before us to represent truth. Others on the council may not have notedthe distinction, but I wanted you to know that I always did.“Though you are not gifted, there is power in a voice such as yours, power intruth. Our reasoning minds, after all, are where our greatest ability lies.Though you are not gifted, that ring of truth resonates with people more thanyou know.“There are things going on at the Keep that I don’t understand. Perhaps othersdo, perhaps even you do, but I don’t. As a councilman I was in a way shut offfrom many of the real goings-on around us. I saw only what was shown to me. Inthat capacity I saw a great many people who came before us for a great manyreasons.“You, Magda Searus, were the only one who always came before us concerned onlywith the truth.“We live in dangerous times. We may be living in the end of times. If we are tosurvive, we need truth more than anything else. Of all the people I have known,you are the only one who stood out to me as someone dedicated to finding thetruth of things. I doubt you have any idea how rare that is.“Don’t ever give up on that calling, Magda. Know yourself, know who you are.Though few would admit it, even those on the council, I truly believe that weall need you.”Magda was stunned to hear him say such things. “But I’m not even gifted. I’m . ..” She almost said that she was a nobody. “I’m not able to do much on my own.”His smile returned. “Standing for truth is everything. Truth is power. Don’tever forget that.”“I won’t. Thank you, Councilman Sadler.”He smiled at the title.“Oh, and Magda, I want you to know that I took your advice.”“My advice? What advice?”He lifted an eyebrow. “Your advice to give the oath to Lord Rahl to protect ourminds from the dream walkers.”Magda stared at him. “You did? When?”He smiled. “The night after you came to the council covered in blood. Like Isaid, I know that you are the only one who came before us concerned with nothingmore than the truth. As soon as I was in my room that night, I went to my knees,as you had instructed, and gave the three devotions to Lord Rahl.”Magda hoped for his sake that he was telling the truth. “Did any of the othercouncil members swear the oath?”He shrugged. “I’m sorry, but I don’t know. I would not tell any of them, and I’msure they would not tell me. I just wanted you to know that if you do come tosee me, you can speak your mind without worry of a dream walker hearing it.”Magda grinned. “Councilman Sadler, you are a devious man.”He returned the grin. “How do you think I have managed to live this long? Bewell, Magda Searus. And be true to yourself.”“I will. And please, take good care of yourself. You can never tell when theMidlands may have further need of you.”As Sadler once again started out across the massive stone bridge, mingling intothe crowds, Magda felt a breeze kick up. She glanced to the horizon and noticeda black band of clouds. The hot, humid weather had been a harbinger ofapproaching storms.Before passing under the iron fangs of the portcullis, she gazed up at themassive, dark walls and towers of the Keep rising up into the darkening sky. Thesilent Keep seemed to be waiting for her, waiting to swallow her up.Magda was alone again. Even though she had only just met him, she missed Merrittbeing with her. There was something about him unlike anyone she had ever met. Itfelt easy, natural, being with him.But now she was alone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58 Magda was just closing the heavy mahogany door to her apartment when she heardfootsteps and then a knock. She thought it might be Merritt, even though sheknew that it was too soon for him to be back—unless he had been unable to helpJames. She pulled open the door.Lothain filled the doorway.He smiled in that private sort of way he had whenever he looked at her. It was alecherous look that always made her skin crawl.After taking a quick appraisal of the room dimly lit by a half-dozen lamps, theman’s black eyes again fixed on her. She could tell by the way he was looking ather that he was having some kind of private thoughts about her, thoughts she wassure she would not like.Magda wanted to slam the door in his face, but she thought better of it. She hadalready pushed him to the edge once before. It would be risky to do it againnow, when they were alone and he didn’t have to worry about witnesses. The wordof the head prosecutor would be taken at face value if she were to end up dead.Enough people already thought she was disloyal to the Midlands that anything hesaid would likely be believed.He smoothed a hand over his short, wiry black hair and down the back of his bullneck. His shoulders and arms were as beefy as his neck.Though he had more formal, dignified clothes that he often wore when conductingofficial business, such as during trials, this night he was wearing unadornedbrown robes, a simple reminder of his high rank as both prosecutor and wizard.Lavish outfits were all too often worn as a pretense of status, since the poorcould not afford fine clothes. Plain, modest robes were meant to be a humblereminder that even those of the highest standing were still mortal. More,though, they were a subtle statement to all that they were of such high rankthat they didn’t actually need to prove it with stylish attire. Their ranktranscended fashion. Those seeking standing would only look silly should theytry to mimic that standing with simple robes, since everyone would know theywere pretenders. So they were left the middle ground of finery to scrap forstanding.“Good evening, Magda.”She didn’t like the arrogance of his informality any more than she liked hisgreasy smile. She stuck to a proper address.“Prosecutor Lothain.”His smile widened into a smug grin. “First Wizard Lothain,” he corrected.She bowed her head slightly with a single nod. “Congratulations. You come into adifficult role with the heavy burden of a terrible war. The people of theMidlands will wish you well with such responsibility, I’m sure, in the hopesthat you might guide us safely through these troubled times.”She wondered if he was to also remain as head prosecutor. That would allow himto retain his private army, but she didn’t want to ask and prolong theconversation.“Yes, a grim duty and heavy responsibility has been placed upon my shoulders,”he said in an indifferent tone, his gaze wandering beyond her to the apartmentwithin.It occurred to her that he was checking to make sure that she was alone.He started to step past her into the apartment, then stopped. “Oh, I’m sorry,Magda. Where are my manners? Here I was, already thinking of the place as mine.Forgive me. May I come in?”Magda stepped back, opening the door wider. As she did, she noticed his largecontingent of personal guards down the hall.“Of course. It’s your place, now. Or at least it will be once I am able to havemy things moved out. I will try not to delay you any longer than necessary.”She couldn’t seem to make herself call him First Wizard.“As a matter of fact, I’m here to discuss that very subject with you.”Magda didn’t give him the satisfaction of asking what he meant. He wasn’t at alla shy man. He liked the sound of his own voice. She knew that he would getaround to it in his own good time. He didn’t need her prompting.He strode into the room, peering about, taking in all the furniture, thegold-fringed draperies, the plush, multicolored carpets, the richly plasteredwalls, and the layered cornices at the edge of the ceiling. He ran a finger overa sideboard of banded mahogany that was beautifully inlaid with silver stems andleaves. It had been a wedding gift from Baraccus, one of many.She hadn’t liked the idea of Baraccus getting such opulent furnishings. Shedidn’t want people to say that he had only been able to win such a beautifulyoung woman into marriage because as First Wizard he was able to shower her withlavish gifts and provide her with a home like a palace.He had gotten her the gifts anyway. When people thought what she had feared, hehad laughed it off and said that he didn’t care about gossip because he knewbetter. He had insisted that the place needed the warmth if she was to livethere.Magda had never in her life lived in such splendor. As beautiful as thesurroundings were, though, they had never meant all that much to her. In fact,she preferred the small storage room because that was where Baraccus’s workbenchwas. She had often sat on her throne of an old crate and watched him work.“Nice,” Lothain said, still looking around. “Very nice. You’ve obviously gone toa great deal of expense and effort adding a woman’s touch to what used to berather cold quarters.”“I can’t take credit. It was all Baraccus’s doing.”He glanced back briefly, looking like he didn’t believe her. He strolled past awall of books in arched bookcases. “Well, he created quite the comfortable homefor you here.”“It’s not my home. It is the First Wizard’s home.”She moved to the door, hinting that now that he had seen enough of the placethat would soon be his, she expected him to be on his way. She wasn’t going toshow him the rest of the apartment. He could see the other rooms once she wasgone.“I really should get to packing my things. The sooner I move out, the sooner youcan move in.”He returned to stand before her. His burly build seemed all the moreintimidating standing so close in front of her. She forced herself not to take astep back as she casually moved her hand closer to her knife hidden in the smallof her back, beneath her dress. A small slit in the dress provided access to theweapon.His smile was back as he fixed her in his gaze again. “That isn’t necessary.”“I don’t know what you mean,” she said.“Moving out,” he said offhandedly. “It isn’t necessary. You see, I think thatit’s time that we came to an arrangement.”Even though she was truly puzzled at his meaning, she didn’t want to coax himinto talking about it. She simply wanted him to leave.“No arrangement will be necessary. If you will leave me to it, I will pack up mythings and move out as quickly as I can so as not to inconvenience you. You areto be First Wizard, so this place is to be yours as well.”“No, I mean that we can make an arrangement so that you don’t have to leave.” Hegestured briefly around the room. “It’s such a beautiful home. This place reallydoes fit you. I want you to stay.”“Stay? I don’t need—”“As my wife.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59 Magda stared, unsure that she had heard what she thought she’d heard.“What?”“I have decided that it is socially appropriate for a man of such standing asthe First Wizard to have a wife.”She was beginning to grasp more graphically the nature of the thoughts that hadbeen so evident behind those black eyes.“What in the world would make you think . . .” She checked herself, rethinkingthe wisdom of the insult she had been about the make. “What makes you think thatI would in any way make an appropriate wife for you?”His gaze drifted down her curves. “Oh, I think you will do just fine.” When thecalculating look finally made it all the way back up to her eyes, his toneturned a bit more serious.“You see, you have already been the wife to a First Wizard. You know theprotocols. You are familiar with the duties. You handled household mattersadmirably for Baraccus, relieving him of menial tasks, and you will do the samefor me.”“There are maids and such assigned to handle household matters. They come withthe apartments. You will do just fine with their help.”“Be that as it may, there are larger issues at stake. You are a woman who alsoneeds the protection of an important man.”Magda was getting the distinct feeling that there was a hidden agenda that hewas working toward.“Protection?”He shrugged. “Of course. Your being the wife of the new First Wizard will bringan end to the questions about your allegiance. It would put to rest the whispersabout your apparent loyalty to Lord Rahl over the Midlands. It would helpdisassociate you from the irregular matters Baraccus was entangled in. It wouldalso bring an end to suspicions about all the strange things you have been upto, lately.”“Strange things I’ve been up to? What are you talking about?”“You have been seen sneaking about, trying not to be seen, hiding your face.”“In other words, you have people spying on me. It so happens that as the formerwife to the First Wizard I simply want to avoid undue attention.”“The fact remains that a virtuous woman, a woman with nothing to hide, would notdo such things. It makes people wonder about you, wonder exactly what you mayhave been up to. Very unsavory behavior for someone of your standing.” Heglanced at her short hair. “Or should I say, former standing.”“If my loyalty to the Midlands and our cause is so suspect, why would you, asFirst Wizard, want to have a woman like that as a wife? More to the point, youare many things, but you are not stupid. You know what I think of you. Why wouldyou be so interested in protecting my virtue?”His smile widened. “Your virtue? You think I care about your virtue? I have useof you, that’s all. Saving your reputation, and perhaps your hide, is merely aplum I offer in return.”“You have use of me? What use could I possibly be to you?”He glanced back over his shoulder, then returned his gaze to her eyes. “Whydon’t you show me the bedroom, Magda, and I will make clear to you one of yourmany uses to me.”Magda could feel the blood rush to her face. She worked to control her voice.Yelling at him was not going to get her to the bottom of what this was reallyall about.“You’re a powerful man. You can have your pick of most any women. A few of themmight even be willing; the rest you can easily afford. You don’t need me forthat.”His grin remained in place. “That may be true, but I would rather have you. Themost unobtainable of all flowers is the most desirable, don’t you think? Itwould prove me the most worthy of any men at the Keep to win the widow ofBaraccus as my wife.”“I wasn’t aware that your self-confidence was so shaky.”His smile finally departed, leaving a grim expression. “Self-confidence is notmy problem; how people perceive me is. You see, having you as my wife would giveme credibility as First Wizard. It would put people in mind of Baraccus. Itwould put us on the same plane. I would be his equal, and as his equal, I wouldhave the same woman at my side.”Magda gritted her teeth. “You are not the equal of Baraccus.”He chuckled. “My dear, you will reconsider that after our first night in bedtogether.”“Get out,” Magda growled through gritted teeth. She pointed through the opendoorway. “Leave.”His humor vanished as his pinched expression took on a vicious cast. He jabbed abeefy finger against her shoulder.“Now you listen to me, Magda Searus. You’ve caused a lot of trouble here in theKeep, trouble that has spread down to the city. I don’t know why, but there area lot of people who believe in you. You got everyone in a fearful uproar withyour bloody show before the council session when you put your wild theoriesabout dream walkers out where people could hear them.“Far worse, though, are your disrespectful and despicable accusations againstme. Improbable as it seems, those insulting charges brought by a nobody havecaught the attention of many. Those accusations have found support and createddivisions within the Keep. They have disgraced and discredited me in the eyes ofsome. Your allegations have made people less willing to trust me, to follow me.“We are at war and you have created speculation, divisions, and suspicion whenwe instead need to be united. Your theories and fanciful notions have shakenpeople’s trust in the council’s wisdom and especially in my authority. You haveundermined faith in me!“You, Magda Searus, have become a threat to order and therefore to our cause. Ifyou care about the Midlands and the people, as you claim, then you would seethat it is your duty to bring peace among them. You are the cause of thedissension and discord, so it is your duty to put an end to it.“By marrying me, you will put to rest all the absurd theories flying around theKeep, absurd theories started by you. The gossip and speculation will end. Youbecoming my wife will calm fears and bring suspicion to an end. It will showpeople that your behavior was only your grief playing tricks on your weak,feminine mind.“Marrying me will put an end to the whispers, about you, and especially aboutme. Marrying me will silence the dissent that is brewing. It will restore unityto the people.“You are going to marry me in order to restore faith in my unquestionedauthority, faith you undermined. You are going to do this for the good of theMidlands.“I am not going—”“This is not a matter open to debate! It is for the good of our people and youare going to do it!”He smoothed a hand back over his bull neck and calmed his tone.“Now, I will give you a chance to think it over. It’s a big step, remarrying,but it will do you good and give you a renewed purpose here at the Keep. I hopethat you don’t make it any more difficult for yourself than it needs to be.“Either way, I can assure you that, in the end, one way or another, you will bemarried to me and serve me as a good and loyal wife should serve her man and herleader, the First Wizard.”He leaned close, his teeth clenched, as he jabbed his fat finger into hershoulder over and over, punctuating his words.“That is the road of life you are going to travel. Don’t make that road anyharder than it needs to be.”Magda ignored the throbbing pain from his finger jabbing her shoulder.“I told you to get out.”He flashed her a cold, patronizing smile. “So you see, since you will bemarrying me, you will be remaining in your apartment—or I should say, ourapartment—surrounded by the luxury to which you are accustomed, living theprivileged life of the wife of the First Wizard. Fears and doubts about theleadership of the Midlands will soon be forgotten when people see you faithfullyat my side.”“I asked you to leave.”Magda’s heart was hammering so hard with rage she couldn’t think straight.He gestured. “You will have to let your hair grow out, of course. It’s onlyfitting for the wife of the First Wizard to have long hair.”“I told you—”“Is there a problem, here?”Magda turned. Merritt filled the doorway."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60 Merritt had Lothain fixed in a dangerous glare.“No, there’s no problem,” Magda said. “Prosecutor Lothain was just leaving. Hehad a minor issue to ask me about, but as it turns out, I’m afraid that I’munable to help him with it.”Lothain stared at her for a moment, as if to say that it was already decided andhe would have his way, before letting his icy look move to Merritt.“What are you doing here, Merritt?”The two men glared at each other like two stags unexpectedly encountering eachother in an open meadow. She knew that she had to do something before one ofthem decided to.“I asked him to come,” Magda said into the dangerous silence.Lothain’s brow twitched as he looked over at her. “You asked him to come? Why?”Before Merritt could say anything, Magda replied, in an offhand manner,“Baraccus was a maker.”“What does that have to do with anything?” Lothain asked before Magda had achance to explain.“Well, when the council told me that they needed the apartments for a new FirstWizard,” she went on, “I told them that I would find a new place and move mythings out. I’m in the process of packing them up. But I have no use forBaraccus’s old tools. I heard that Merritt is also a maker, so I offered him thetools. They aren’t of any use to me. I thought they not only might be of someuse to Merritt, but it would save me the trouble of moving them. Besides, Iwon’t have the room for them in my new quarters.”Lothain smoothed a hand over his head as he considered what she’d said. “I see.”Lothain’s legendary temper was balanced on a knife edge, and she knew that itcould go either way. She was overwhelmed by what he had told her and she neededtime to think, but if she didn’t do something to cool him off, or at least movehim into another direction, there was going to be trouble.With Lothain’s private army filling the hall, she knew that Merritt didn’t standa chance.“I’m glad that I was here and had the chance to show you the quarters,” Magdasaid before he could say anything. She gestured to the door. “If you’re finishedinspecting them, then I will see to getting rid of Baraccus’s old tools andmoving the rest of my things out as soon as possible.”Magda had always thought of Lothain as a sizable man, but next to Merritt helooked almost puny. Still, one man was no match for all the soldiers in greentunics.For whatever reason, Lothain took the opportunity to pass up an uglyconfrontation. He flashed her a cold smile and a meaningful look.“Of course.” He bowed his head slightly. “Thank you, Lady Searus, for listeningwith an open mind to my . . . proposal. We will be coming to an agreement on itvery soon, I assure you.”Lothain let his gaze turn to take in Merritt, from his long, wavy hair to hisboots and back up again. It was a condescending examination.“Didn’t anyone ever tell you, boy, that real wizards don’t need swords?”Magda expected the trouble to begin, but Merritt instead did something thatsurprised her. He grinned. As he leaned against the doorframe he shrugged withhis other shoulder.“I’m compensating for my many inadequacies.”Lothain arched an eyebrow as he bulled the taller man out of his way. “I imagineyou are.”Merritt looked back over his shoulder, watching Lothain and the prosecutor’sprivate army depart.“What did he want?” Merritt asked, his grin gone.“A wife.”“What?”Magda waved off the question. “I’ll tell you later. What about James?”Merritt sighed. “I got lucky. He was having a lot of trouble breathing. Theythought his lungs had been burned when he inhaled the illumination from theexplosion of the collapsing web. They just didn’t understand the reaction causedby the combination of spells involved. Those spells were still stuck together, Iguess you could say, still reacting and suppressing his ability to breathe. OnceI decoupled the elements of the spell-forms to cease the reaction, he couldbreathe again.“He’s still hurting, but the others can heal him now. We have more importantthings to worry about.”Magda let out a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness.”Merritt didn’t look to share her relief. “There are still three other wivesmourning the deaths of their husbands.”Magda nodded. “Let’s go next door, to the storage room, just in case Lothaincomes back. I told him that you were here for Baraccus’s tools. Let’s not givehim any excuse to think we’re up to something.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 61 As they walked into the storage room, Merritt swept an arm out to ignite thelamps. Since he was gifted, his presence also lit the half-dozen heavy glasslight spheres in iron brackets on the walls. The closed shutters held back thenight and the distant flickers of lightning at the horizon.“So what’s this about Lothain wanting you as his wife?”His tone betrayed his displeasure.“We have trouble,” Magda said without answering his question.“More trouble than Lothain wanting you as his wife?”“Lothain has been named First Wizard.”Suddenly speechless, Merritt stared at her, not unlike the way she had stared atCouncilman Sadler when he’d first told her the news. The only sound in thestorage room was the hissing sputters of the freshly lit lamps.Merritt finally found his voice. “That is trouble. I’ve never trusted the man.He’s not half the man needed for First Wizard.”“Believe me, I have a far lower opinion of him than you do, but he’s apparentlya man with enough power to get himself named as First Wizard.”“That’s true enough. A lot of people support him. His reign as head prosecutorhas seen a lot of formerly respected people brought down. Many people hold himin high regard for so vigorously going after criminals and traitors. You have toadmit, he has been able to prosecute a lot of traitors.” Merritt leaned towardher as they crossed the room. “I have to confess, though, that I’ve always hadmy doubts about the guilt of some of those he has prosecuted.”Magda frowned over at him. “Like who?”Merritt pressed his lips tight before finally giving in. “I knew some of thewizards on the Temple team. I’d always thought favorably of them. I can see thatmany on the team turned against our cause and betrayed us, but all of them? Iwonder if some of them might not have been scapegoats. Charging someone andbeheading them ends the investigation. It makes Lothain look like hesuccessfully prosecuted all of the guilty. But I wonder.”Magda was a bit surprised to hear Merritt say such things. She had thought thatshe was the only one. Being ungifted, she had assumed that she didn’t knowenough about the whole thing to judge. She didn’t know that wizards had doubtsabout the guilt of the Temple team. Maybe Merritt was the only one.She looked back over her shoulder at his eyes. “I’ve wondered as well.“That’s not all of it,” she said as she reached the familiar workbench. “Rightafter you left me to go help James, I ran into Councilman Sadler as he wasleaving the Keep. Besides telling me that Lothain was to be named First Wizard,he also told me that Lothain dismissed him from the council.”“Dismissed him?” Merritt leaned in. “Can he do such a thing?”“Apparently. Sadler put on a brave face, but I could tell that he washeartbroken about it.”Merritt scratched his cheek as he considered it. “Why would Lothain get rid ofSadler?”“In order to reduce the council’s number to five so as to make it possible tocarry any motion with three votes. There were six members, before, so the votecould be spilt three to three, preventing action. Now, with five members, thecouncil can’t be evenly split anymore, as happened with difficult decisions.Now, no matter what, they are always guaranteed to have a majority to decide upor down on any matter.”“That is troubling. I’ve never really had much to do with the higher powersrunning the Keep, but this doesn’t sound good to me. What I’m more worriedabout, though, is what does Lothain know about running a war?”“He has his own private army.”Merritt arched an eyebrow. “That doesn’t make him a general, it makes him apetty tyrant with muscle behind him.”“Well, if I’m right about him, he may now become a bigger tyrant.”Merritt considered silently for a moment, and then folded his arms. “All of thisnews is troubling enough, but what’s this about you marrying him?”Magda took a deep breath. She hated the whole subject. “Well, Lothain says thatI’m causing all kinds of trouble in the Keep. He says that the Keep has becomedivided and filled with discord and distrust. Apparently, a lot of peoplebesides us don’t think he is the right man to be First Wizard.“Lothain thinks that his problems with credibility are chiefly my doing. Hethinks that because of the things I said about him I’ve undermined his authorityand have made people doubt him.”“You said something about him? What did you say?”“When I was in front of a crowd in the council chambers, he accused me of makingup the story about the dream walkers in order to get people to switch allegianceto D’Hara. I, in turn, accused him of chasing phantoms just to make a biggername for himself. I said that he sees conspiracies lurking in every shadow,spies hiding around every corner, traitors behind every door. I said that hecared only about inventing wrongdoing in order to advance his own personal fameand power.”Merritt let out a low whistle. “You said that? Publicly?”“I’m afraid so. In front of everyone I accused him of coming up withconspiracies that were only meant to promote his own status. I said that inorder to elevate himself he was deliberately ignoring the truth about the dreamwalkers.”“No wonder he blames you for tarnishing his credibility.”“He also says that I’ve given birth to wild speculation about dream walkers. Hesays that my groundless accusations have turned people in the Keep against him.He says that such divisions are harmful to our cause.”Merritt paced a few step away and then returned with heat in his voice. “Thenwhy in the world would he want to marry you?”“His solution to people’s doubts about him, doubts that he says I created withwhat he calls my baseless accusations, is to have me marry him. He thinks thatif I were to marry him, it would convince everyone that I’ve reconsidered myviews, views shaped by my grief and not any true failing on his part. He saysthat my consent to marry him would show people that I’m putting my faith andtrust in him, and so they should as well. He thinks that it will banish anylingering doubts. He thinks that only in that way will people unite behind himand the war effort. He says that I need to do it for the good of the Midlandsand our cause.”Merritt, arms still folded, stared at her with an unreadable look.Magda finally leaned toward him and said, “I’m not going to marry him.”He let his arms drop. “Oh. All right, then.”Magda turned to the familiar, worn workbench. She knew how angry the very ideaof marrying Lothain made her, but she was a little surprised to see how upset itmade Merritt. It made her feel good, though, that he cared that she didn’t makethe mistake of marrying Lothain.Shadow jumped out from the darkness among crates and supplies stacked on thefloor and up onto the workbench. The silky black cat came close and rubbedagainst Magda’s hand.As Magda stroked the cat’s back, Shadow lifted her hind end, hoping to have itscratched. As she enjoyed the attention, her tail curled around Magda’s wrist.“Who’s this?” Merritt asked.“This is Shadow. Isidore told me that cats have some small capacity to seebetween worlds. She said that black cats catch glimpses of the spirit world.”Merritt held his hand out so that Shadow could get to know him. “Isidore wouldknow.” Shadow inspected each finger in turn.“Shadow detected the presence of that dead man that attacked us before we knewhe was there. She definitely didn’t like him.” Magda smiled. “But I see that shereally likes you.”Shadow was rubbing against Merritt, purring in response to his touch. With hisblack shirt, the cat matched him, looked almost part of him. Magda wondered ifMerritt, too, could detect the presence of spirits. The limits of the gift wereoften a mystery to her.“I now sleep with the cloth from Isidore’s maze as a blanket, and Shadow curledup beside my pillow.” Magda scratched the cat’s head. “Don’t I, little one? Butnow you need to move.”“I’m glad to hear it,” Merritt said. “For someone ungifted, you seem to know howto use the things of magic at your disposal.”Magda smiled as she lifted the cat and set her to the back of the workbench,where she lay down on her side, curled a paw under, and settled in to watch asMagda pulled a piece of wood out that covered a secret compartment in the benchtop.“I have something to show you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 62 “This is the note Baraccus left for me,” Magda said. “You asked before about itsexact wording. I thought we had better check. I know how important such littledetails can be to a wizard.”Suddenly alert, Merritt stepped closer. “Would you mind if I knew what the wholenote said? Context can be important in such matters. Besides that, I might beable to pick up on something you missed. I mean, only if you’d be willing. . . .Would you mind?”Magda smiled. “No, of course not.”She carefully unfolded the piece of paper and then held the note up in the lightso that she could read it aloud.“‘My time has passed, Magda. Yours has not. Your destiny is not here. Yourdestiny is to find truth. It will be difficult, but have the courage to take upthat calling.’” She looked up. “I was right. It doesn’t say ‘find the truth.’ Itjust says ‘find truth.’”Merritt was frowning, deep in thought. After a moment, he gestured to the notein her hands. “Is there more?”Magda nodded and went on. “‘Look out to the rise on the valley floor below, justoutside the city to the left. There, on that rise, a palace will one day bebuilt. There is your destiny, not here.’”She had to swallow and compose herself before she could read the last part.“‘Know that I believe in you. Know, too, that I will always love you. You are arare, fierce flower, Magda. Be strong now, guard your mind, and live the lifethat only you can live.’”The only sound was Shadow’s tail slowly, softly, slapping the top of theworkbench.“It’s a beautiful note, Magda,” Merritt said in a soft, compassionate voice asshe stood staring down at the paper in her trembling fingers. “It’s clear howmuch you meant to him.”Magda wiped a tear from her cheek. She hadn’t realized how shaken she would beto read it again. It brought back so much, and at the same time reminded her ofhow distant it had all become. Baraccus was gone. The world of life had movedon.Magda cleared her throat. “Do you have any idea what he could mean about apalace, and my destiny being there?”“Sorry, but I don’t. Baraccus was a prophet, though, so he must know somethingabout the future. A possible future, anyway. Our free will makes the futuresometimes uncertain, even for prophets. I think that what he means is the futureis yours to decide and he is hoping you will make the right decision.”Magda’s arm lowered. “When the dream walker was trying to kill me, I rememberedwhat he said in this note. Alric Rahl told me that the devotion he created—theone you helped him create—is meant to guard our minds from dream walkers. When adream walker had me, and was trying to kill me, those words in the note made merealize that I had to give the devotion to Lord Rahl in order to guard my mindand save my own life. Baraccus’s words made me choose my own future, chooselife, and as a result his prophetic words proved true.”“Prophecy is often like that,” Merritt said. He seemed to surface from deepthoughts. “It also says your destiny is to find truth, just like you said, notthe truth, as I had thought when you first told me.”“Does that mean something to you?”Merritt gave her a meaningful look, then drew the sword at his hip. As itemerged from the scabbard, the blade made a soft ringing sound that filled thequiet storage room. Magda could see something besides the gift in his eyes whenhe held the sword. It was a kind of deep, distant rage, something almost alivewith its power.Merritt carefully laid the sword on the workbench. Shadow gazed with drowsygreen eyes at the blade he laid before her. Merritt finally looked at Magda in away that told her he expected something from her.She looked from Merritt to the sword and back again. “What?”Merritt gestured to the sword. “What does it say?”She knew very well what it said. She hadn’t been able to get it out of her mind.Still, Magda’s eyes turned to the hilt. She let her fingers lightly glide overthe raised gold letters.“It says ‘Truth.’” She lifted a brow at Merritt. “Are you saying that Baraccus’swords in his note—‘Your destiny is to find truth’—are meant to say that mydestiny is to find the Sword of Truth? You really think that’s what he meant?You really think it could be that obvious?”Merritt shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m a maker, not a prophet. But I made the wordTruth on the hilt, and you came to me and found the sword with that word craftedinto it. You are the one who named it the Sword of Truth.”A jumble of thoughts tumbled through Magda’s mind. Was Baraccus saying that herdestiny was to find Merritt and the sword with Truth on it?Or was he saying that this was the beginning of the path to her finding truth,and that path had taken her to Merritt?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 63 Magda again ran her fingers over the letters as Merritt stepped up beside her atthe workbench. His gaze scanned the tools off to the side.“This is where Baraccus made things, then? This room, this workbench?”Magda nodded as she gestured to the side. “I used to sit on this crate, here,and watch him work.”Magda glanced to the ornately engraved silver box to the side of the table thatheld treasured memories. Baraccus seemed so distant, now. In some ways it wasall like only yesterday, but in other ways it all seemed so long ago in herlife. She missed him, but even that pain was gradually fading as she worriedabout all the immediate problems.“Did he make that as well?” Merritt asked, gesturing to the silver box.Magda nodded as she pulled it closer to show him. She ran her fingers over thetop, much as she had done with the letters on the sword, and then opened thelid.“It just holds some small memories of things he gave me.”Magda lifted out the white flower to show him.Merritt looked somewhat surprised. “That’s pretty rare. I’ve only seen one ofthose once before.”Magda twirled the flower between a finger and thumb. “You know what this is,then? Baraccus said it was rare, but never mentioned the name.”“It’s called a confession flower.”Magda frowned. “Really? A confession flower? Why would it be called that?”“Because a confession is a revelation of the truth. Truth is pure. White ispure. Thus the name.”“That’s a lovely name, for a lovely flower,” she said as she replaced the flowerand closed the lid.“Maybe you could come watch me make something, someday.”Magda smiled. “I’d like that.” She hopped up onto her seat on the crate andpointed at the well-used collection of exquisite metalsmithing tools,semiprecious stones in divided wooden trays, assorted supplies, and the smallbooks filled with notes that had belonged to her husband.“I was making an excuse at the time,” she said, “but I think Baraccus would likeyou to have his tools.”Merritt’s eyes lit up. “You really think so? Me, have the tools that belong to aFirst Wizard?”“I guess that they’re my tools now. I know that I would like you to have them. Ireally do think that Baraccus would approve. He would want them to go to a gooduse, to a good person.”Merritt reached out and reverently touched some of the small tools in thecollection. They really did seem to mean a great deal to Merritt. He respectedtheir value.“These are some of the finest tools I’ve ever seen.”“I’m glad you like them and that you can put them to good use,” Magda said witha smile.He pointed, then, at the little books beside the tools.“What are those?”Magda lifted her head to see where he was pointing. “Oh, those. Notes he took, Iguess.”Merritt gestured to the books. “May I?”Magda’s smile widened at seeing how excited he was by such simple things astools and notes. She leaned forward enough to slide the stack of little bookscloser to him. “Of course. Maybe they can be helpful to you.”Merritt picked up the one on top and opened it, slowly turning the pages, takinga look at what was written there. She watched his hazel eyes move as he scannedthe pages.As he read, his smile vanished. His eyes grew wide.And then the blood drained from his face.“Dear spirits . . .” he whispered.Magda frowned. “What is it? What’s wrong?”He began rapidly turning the pages. He studied each briefly, then turned to thenext page.“Celestial calculations,” he whispered to himself.“That makes sense,” Magda said. She didn’t understand why he was so excited.Baraccus was forever writing down celestial calculations and measurements. Hewould take distances and angles from stars to stars, or from certain stars to adistant spot on the horizon, or sometimes to the moon. “I often heard Baraccusspeaking to other wizards about celestial calculations, measurements, andequations. I thought all wizards knew about those kinds of things.”“No, you don’t understand.” He tapped the book as he held it before her face, asif maybe she, too, should be able to decipher the tangle of lines and numbersand formulas. “These are celestial calculations.”“You said that before. I’m sorry, Merritt, but I can’t make sense of them.”“Magda, these are the rift calculations for creating a seventh-level breach.”His voice broke. “Dear spirits, these celestial calculations are themeasurements and formulas from before the star shift. These are the formulasthat I knew had to exist, but had never been able to find. These are theformulas that Baraccus said he couldn’t give me because they had been taken awayand hidden in the Temple of the Winds.”Magda felt goose bumps tingle up her arms as she hopped down off her crate. “Areyou sure? Are you sure that these are those formulas?”“Yes. Yes, the very ones.” He tapped the book excitedly again. “This is them.These are the occulted calculations and templates for creating a seventh-levelbreach. It’s all right here.”As Merritt dropped heavily into the chair at the bench, Magda looked down at thesmall open book he was holding. The lines and writing looked like nothing but abunch of angles and numbers to her, the same kinds of measurements Baraccus tookall the time from his own observations. It was like a foreign language to her,but it was a language that Merritt, like Baraccus, understood well.It came to her, then.Merritt was still staring at the open book.“I understand, now,” she said in little more than a whisper.With a finger, Magda lifted his chin until his gaze met hers. “I understand.”“What do you mean? Understand what?”“Baraccus knew that you needed these. He must have brought them back with himfrom the Temple of the Winds.” She felt the goose bumps on her arms crawl therest of the way up to the nape of her neck. “Remember what I told you before?That when he went there he found out that the boxes of Orden were gone and hecould tell no one but me? He knew they’d been taken. Do you see? He must havebrought these back so that the key could be completed.”Merritt could only stare at her.Magda swallowed past the lump in her throat. “He brought them back for you,Merritt. He knew what you were making, and he knew that you needed these. Hewanted you to be able to complete the key, hoping you could use it to protectthe boxes of Orden. He said that my destiny was to find truth. That led me toyou, so that I could bring you to what Baraccus wanted you to have to completethe key.”He put a hand to his forehead. “You’re making my head spin, Magda. Do you graspthe enormity of what you’re saying? It’s all so hard to believe.”“The truth is there in your hand, in that book.”“It certainly is. These formulas are staggeringly valuable. Some believe thattheir existence was only gossip and rumor. Some believe they never existed andwere only a myth. But some of us knew from our work that they had to exist. Andhere they are, sitting on the First Wizard’s workbench.”“They’ve been here ever since he returned from the underworld with them. He hidthem in plain sight.”Merritt’s eyes filled with tears as he stared up at her. His voice broke withemotion. “Do you know how many good men have died trying to re-create theseformulas? Died making wild guesses in the dark?”“And now you have what you need to finish the Sword of Truth?”Merritt reached out and touched the blade. He lifted the little book. “Withthese I do. I believe that I now have everything I need to complete it.”“You should be able to get some of the other men to help you finish the sword.The key will be complete.”He went silent for a moment as he considered her words.“I’ve already done all the preliminary work, and I did that by myself. No onehelped me. I don’t really need any of those men to complete it.”“Then why are the people trying to make the key always working in teams?”“The council ordered the key made, but they didn’t know how to make it. Theyassumed it would take teams of wizards. A lot of things do.”“Didn’t you tell them?”“Every chance I got.” His face twisted with frustration. “They wouldn’t listento anything I was telling them about how I thought the key needed to be made.Since it was such a complicated task, they guessed that a team would be neededjust like they guessed about everything else. They wouldn’t listen. They thoughtthat with more men they would be able to cover more ground, overcome thedifficulties, and figure it out. But all that did was get more men killed.”“But shouldn’t you have someone you trust help you?”He regarded her with a meaningful look. “Yes, but with all that’s happening atthe Keep, I don’t dare trust anyone. After all, you didn’t trust even thecouncil with the news that the power of Orden is back in this world.”“I guess you’re right about that.”“Worse, though, the more people who know that the key has been completed, themore we risk word leaking out to whoever has the boxes of Orden. Baraccus didn’ttrust telling anyone but you. If I do it by myself, no one will know that a keyexists. Then I can work to try to find the boxes and protect them.”Magda looked from the sword back to his eyes. “Are you sure that you shouldfinish the Sword of Truth? I mean, if the key doesn’t exist . . .”“Whoever has the boxes very well might try to access the power without the key.That intoxicating temptation has always been the danger. By doing so, and ifthey do certain things wrong, they could unintentionally destroy the world oflife. If that happened, the key would be the only way to control the power andwalk us back from the brink.”“Then I guess it’s better to complete the sword and then we can try to protectthe boxes.”“We?”“We’re the only two people who know all of this. Baraccus trusted me with theinformation about the missing boxes for a reason. The people who have the boxesdon’t know about the formulas that Baraccus brought you. We’re the only twopeople who know the whole story. We need to work together.”Merritt mulled over her words. “You’re right about that much of it, but I don’tknow if I like that idea. It’s too dangerous for you to be involved.”Magda cocked her head. “Too dangerous? Merritt, I’m already at the center ofthis whole thing. What unexpected threat might come after me next? The only truesafety is to figure out what’s going on and put a stop to it.”He wiped a hand back across his face as he let out a weary sigh. “I don’t likeit, Magda, but I have to admit that you very well might be right. No matterwhich way you turn, you seem to always be at the center of the storm, whetherit’s dream walkers, or dead men trying to kill you, Baraccus’s prophecies in hisnote to you, or the boxes of Orden.”Magda was glad he understood. “That’s the way I’ve always looked at it. I haveto find out what’s going on at the Keep before it’s too late. It’s somethingthat maybe only I can do.”Merritt closed his fingers around the hilt of the sword and lifted it off thetable. Shadow’s green eyes followed the blade. Merritt’s own eyes were filledwith iron determination.“I need to do it right now, before anything happens.”“What about going to the dungeons to talk to the sorceress who defected? We haveto do that, too. We need to get to her before they execute her.”He placed the sword’s point in the scabbard and slid the blade home. “If she isstill alive they aren’t going to behead her at night. They usually do beheadingsin the afternoon, so we have at least until tomorrow. That gives me tonight tocomplete the key.”“That’s true, I suppose, but that’s for public executions. This may be somethingdifferent.” Magda didn’t want to lose the opportunity to find out if the womancould tell them anything important about the enemy’s plans. “Are you sure,Merritt? What that woman knows could be important. We may never get anotherchance to learn about secrets from the Old World.”“I understand, but this is more important.” With a thumb, he tapped the hilt ofthe sword. “We need to do this first, then we can go to the dungeons and see ifwe can find her. For all we know, she may not even still be alive. This is moreimportant.”“All right, then, let’s head down to the lower reaches of the Keep and finishthe sword.”With his palm resting on the pommel, Merritt drummed his fingers on the crossguard as he considered. “I think it best not to do it in the Keep. I don’t knowfor sure how big a reaction the release of that much power will create, but Iexpect that it will be pretty violent. It’s sure to attract the attention ofanyone nearby. Besides, I need water. Lots of water.”“Water? Why?”“To cool the reaction.”Magda brightened. “I know a place like that out in the woods—the pond I used togo to when I was younger.”“The one you went to with Quinn?”Magda nodded. “That’s the place. It’s not too far and it’s not only secluded,it’s deserted. We should go now. At night we wouldn’t chance anyone being outfor a stroll in the woods.”Merritt paced for a moment as he considered. “Even though I have what I need,it’s still profoundly dangerous. Such a thing, with the real elements, has neveractually been attempted before that I know of. I think it would be better if youwaited here.”Magda waved the note. “Baraccus said that my destiny is to find truth. I namedit the Sword of Truth. It’s not complete yet and it needs to be. I think mydestiny is to be there with you when you complete it. Besides,” she added, “yousaid you needed help. Who else can you trust?”He watched her eyes for a moment. He finally succumbed to a smile.“I’d like that, Magda. I’d like that very much. Besides, like I said, I do needanother person to help me.”“But I’m not gifted,” she reminded him. “What are we going to do about that?”“I don’t need you to be gifted.”“Then what do you need me for?”“I’ll need your blood.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 64 Magda glanced toward the call of unseen creatures echoing out from the darkness.She had little chance of seeing anything, of course, but she couldn’t helplooking every time she heard a strange sound. The hoots, yelps, and howls comingfrom the distance in the deep woods, even though she was familiar with many ofthe animals that made them, were unnerving at night, and especially a night suchas this one. The lightning and thunder didn’t help, either.The dark shadow of Merritt behind her felt like she was being haunted by aspirit. After leaving the Keep, they had walked for quite some time through theblackness of the dense woods that stretched away in all directions fromAydindril.She often thought of that thick carpet of forest as nearly going on forever,because it seemed to touch the most distant of places. The roads and trailsthrough those forests connected Aydindril with the rest of the world.She had traveled the vast wilderness too many times to count as she journeyed tovisit distant peoples of the Midlands. She had followed woodland trails throughmountains to small kingdoms to the north, the routes off to the distantsettlements to the west, the woods roads to cities in D’Hara in the east, andthe nearly trackless stretches all the way down to the peoples that inhabitedthe open grassland of the wilds, far to the south.Beyond the wilds, farther south, lay the boundless mysteries of the Old World.Though there were well-traveled trade routes down into the Old World, she hadnever had reason to venture to the distant empire. By some of the trade goodsbrought back from there, it seemed like it must be an exotic land.Not wanting to distract Merritt’s mind from what he needed to do, she hadn’tsaid much since they had left the city of Aydindril. He had considered the taskthat lay ahead in silence as Magda had guided him along the little-used path inthe deep woods.She couldn’t imagine what Merritt must be feeling. He had worked toward thismoment for years, only to come to believe that the goal was out of his reach.Men had died trying to do what he was now about to attempt. But now, because ofBaraccus, he had a real chance to complete the key.While it had been years since she had been on this particular trail, she used towalk it often enough that it was still familiar, although it seemed moreovergrown and narrower to her now than it had as a young girl. The lantern Magdacarried lit only a small patch of the trail close around her, but it lit enoughbetween the flashes of lightning for her to make her way without difficulty.Since they had left Aydindril, the clouds had built and the lightning had takenon a kind of stormy urgency.Magda recognized a forked tree and then a particular jumble of granite ledgesthat abruptly loomed up out of the darkness. She knew that the rock led up andover the spine of a long, descending ridge. Without having to think about it,she took the correct footholds in roots and cracks to smoothly make the briefbut tricky switchback ascent. She noticed that Merritt followed in herfootsteps, taking the exact same route, so as to be able to make the climbwithout any trouble.He looked at ease in the dark woods. In his dark clothes, he blended right in.Being used to traveling herself, Magda could tell by the way he moved throughthe woods that he was used to being in the wilderness. A lot of wizards weren’t.A lot of wizards rarely left the confines of the Keep. That contrast, too, madehim stand apart from other wizards.With rain imminent, Magda wanted to finish their business as soon as possibleand get back to the shelter of the Keep. Since her encounter with CouncilmanSadler, just before sunset, the clouds she had seen at the horizon had moved into lower the sky into a brooding mass seething with flashes that revealed amenacing green cast deep inside. That color, she knew, often foretold especiallyviolent weather. The arrival of the clouds had pushed out the hot, muggy air,replacing it with chill, gusty breezes.The sudden bursts of lightning lit the towering pines all around in flashes ofharsh, white light that cast bizarre shadows, making the journey through thedense forest unsettling. When the lightning abruptly cut off, it suddenlyplunged the woods back into blackness. It made for alternating glaring light andthen total blindness. The loud crack of thunder that followed each flash wasequally unsettling. Sometimes a bright flicker of lightning and the loud bangwere quickly followed by deep, rolling thunder that shook the ground.Unlike most storms, this lightning became ever more incessant. As they madetheir way between the towering trunks of pines and occasionally followed thetrail as it tunneled through thick foliage, the lightning flashed relentlesslyin a nearly continual display of crackling intensity. In fact, the lightning wasoften so closely stitched together that she could almost, but not quite, havemade her way without the lantern’s light. The intervals of darkness betweenflashes were surprisingly brief, but without the lantern it would have been likebeing blind as they went from brightly lit to darkest night.The air smelled like rain was imminent. Magda was resigned to getting wet. Shecould also smell the dry pine needles matting the ground, along with theoccasional balsam trees or swaths of cinnamon ferns beside the trail.“How much farther?” Merritt asked as they descended the back of the low ridge.Magda stopped and pointed off to the right. “If it was light, I believe youcould see the pond through the trees, down there.”Merritt cast out his hand, as if he were tossing a pebble. A flare of light, notunlike a tiny, solid bit of the colossal light show overhead, sailed out in thedirection she had pointed, illuminating the dark trunks of trees as it passed.She saw the water reflect the light before it touched down on the ripplingsurface and was extinguished.“That’s too steep and wooded here down to the shore,” he said. “We need to havesome open space.”“Just up here ahead is the place I told you about,” she said. “The trail justahead will take us to the open area at the pond’s edge.”Magda led him onward until she reached a familiar, ancient oak. She passed justbeneath a fat, low limb and warned Merritt to watch his head. He ducked under ashe followed after her. The trail wound its way down across a band of open ledgesand then through a narrow cut in a screen of cedar trees. Dropping down a steepbut brief slope, they arrived at a broad, flat, open area with scattered tuftsof grass. In the spring it was often flooded at the windward end of the pond,but by high summer it was dry and open.Lightning flashes revealed the pond before them and the towering stands of treesto the sides that sheltered them somewhat from the wind. In the flashes oflightning, Magda could see that to the right the surface of the pond was thicklylayered with lily pads riding the choppy surface. Off to the left stood a bandof rushes bending and whipping with each gust. Stretching out from the gravelshoreline was the black expanse of the pond, with a short cliff backing it atthe far side.“It’s perfect,” Merritt said as he looked around.A bright, crackling flash of lightning, followed by booming thunder, silencedall the night creatures. When the thunder rolled away into the distance it leftan interlude of quiet in its wake. The only sound was the wind in the trees andthe small waves lapping the shore. The quiet was quickly broken by yet morerolling thunder.When Magda turned back, she saw Merritt down on his knees, smoothing the sandydirt among clumps of long grass. Once he had a clean, flat area, he stood andbrushed his hands clean.“Set the lantern down over here on this rock,” he said, pointing beside the areahe had just smoothed out.As Magda was setting down the lantern, the chilly air rang with the sound of thesword being drawn. The blade coming out of the scabbard made a uniquely menacingsound that sent a chill up her spine. In the faint lantern light she could seeMerritt standing with his feet spread and the sword in one hand. A bright flashof lightning cast his shadow across the area he had prepared.“You know how to draw the Grace, right?” he asked her as he lifted his fist,showing her the ring he wore with the Grace engraved on it.“Merritt, I’m not gifted.”“I told you, it isn’t necessary. I will be the one doing what is needed withmagic, but you will have to be the one to draw the Grace. That’s all I will needyou to do.”“Well, since I’m not gifted I never had reason to draw the Grace, but I’ve seenit often enough. It’s not that complicated. I shouldn’t have any problem at alldrawing it.”“It needs to be drawn in blood.”She had expected as much and nodded.He had that serious look again that had a way of making her brow bead withsweat. “The sword needs to taste the blood as well,” he said. “The bloodconnects the sword to the Grace.”Magda eyed the sword. She didn’t know what he meant about the sword needing totaste blood. She folded her arms against a chill gust.“How much blood will it take?”He stepped into the center of the flat area and, using the sword to point,gestured in a circle around him. “The Grace needs to be big enough to surroundwhere I’m standing. It has to be enough blood to complete the whole thing. Allthe lines you draw have to be complete. They can’t be a bit here, and anotherbit there. It has to be fully drawn with complete lines. I’m afraid that it willtake quite a bit of blood to do that.”She pulled strands of windblown hair back off her face. She had known it wasn’tgoing to be easy. She had insisted on being a part of it. She had to be the oneto do it. She wasn’t about to back out now, no matter what it took.“I understand,” Magda said. “I’ll do my best.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 65 Merritt stepped closer. He swept his hair back. Lightning cast his handsomefeatures in stark light and black shadows.“Listen, Magda, for the last time, you don’t have to do this. It’s dangerous.There are wizards on the teams who would—”“Wizards we can’t be sure we can trust,” she reminded him. “Especially not withsomething this important.”“I know, but you need to understand that this particular sort of conjuringrequires the use of blood in order to power certain elements. Your blood wouldlink you to the event. It ties you directly into the elements involved. Thoseelements contain not just Additive Magic, but Subtractive. The mixing of thoseelements is what got a lot of wizards killed while trying to do this verything.”He had told her all that before—several times—when they had been crossingthrough the city as he began having second thoughts about her being a part offinishing the key. She hadn’t let him dissuade her then, and she wasn’t about tolet him do so now, but she also hadn’t asked for explanations of some of thethings he’d said. She’d figured that what was necessary was necessary, and shewould find out what she needed to know when the time came. That time had come.“You said that before, but I don’t know what it means, actually, to be linked tothe event.”Merritt looked sympathetic. He stepped closer still, gazing down at her as helifted his fist to show her the ring he wore.“The Grace represents the interconnection of everything, the world of life andthe world of the dead, Additive and Subtractive, as well as the spark of thegift that runs through it all. The Grace does more, though, than simplyrepresent Additive and Subtractive magic, Creation and obliteration, life anddeath; it connects them into a cohesive whole.“By using your blood to draw the Grace, you are the one providing those livingelements, that cohesive whole, to the completion of the key. What was missingbefore was the breach formulas that are supposed to guard those new links in thesword while the combination routines allow the elements to coalesce. Thosebreach formulas are meant to keep the whole thing stable while the Additive andSubtractive parts are fusing. They do that by actually breaching the nature ofthe Grace long enough for the elements to fuse into the target—in this case thekey.“That’s how the others were killed; there was nothing breaching the Grace untilthe two sides could combine in a stable fashion. That’s what happens in life,when a wizard with both sides of the gift is born, both sides are fused intohim, but we’re trying to do that same thing artificially, and we didn’t have theformula to create the breach that would allow it to take place. Now, with thebreach open, the whole process can draw what it needs from you, through theGrace drawn in your blood, as it uses both sides—life and death—that areinherent in your existence.”Much to her amazement, Magda was actually beginning to understand the principlesinvolved. That wasn’t making it any easier to work up the nerve to do it, but atleast she was grasping the true nature of the danger.“So I would be providing the power of death as well?”“Yes. We all will die one day, so I think that we also carry latent death withinus from the moment we come into existence. Your spark of life is what powers theGrace you draw with your blood. That Grace thus contains both the power of lifeand the power of death because you do.“The power of Orden deals with life, death, and the whole nature of existence,so the key also needs to have both sides. It needs both Additive andSubtractive, life and death, to be complete.“Through the Grace, you would be providing those forces. As I invest thoseelements in the sword, with the breach open, it will draw strength from yourlife force.“But if something goes wrong because the formulas I use have flaws, or I make amistake in conjuring spell-forms, or if the seventh-level breach doesn’t openand then close properly, you could be caught beyond the veil to the underworld,just like those wizards Baraccus sent to the Temple of the Winds in theunderworld. They were caught beyond the veil and never returned.”Magda twined her fingers together. “I trust you, Merritt. You’ve been working onthis for a long time. No one knows more about it than you. If it can be done,you can do it. I could be in no better hands.”“And what if I’m wrong about some part of it?” He gestured vaguely. “Look,Magda, you don’t need to do this. I can get a wizard from one of the teams totry it first. This kind of thing is their job. They’ve devoted their lives tocreating such dangerous things. I’m not so sure that you should—”“We’ve had this argument already and it’s settled. This is more important thanmy life and you know it. This is the only life I have and I don’t want to loseit, but there are profoundly important things at stake here this night, things Icare deeply about, things I believe in, like not letting harm come to all ourpeople.“The boxes of Orden are here, in the world of life. Someone stole them. Theyobviously must want to use those boxes and when they do they willintentionally—or even unintentionally—bring all of our lives to an end. Stoppingthat from happening is what matters. What good will it do to worry about apossible danger to me tonight, at the cost of all of us tomorrow?“Who else but you can stop that from happening? Who else but you can completethe key? Who else but me can we trust to help you?“I have to do this, Merritt. I trust you to take care with my life, but if Ilose it in the attempt, then I will have died trying to save all life and Idon’t want you to blame yourself. This is worth doing. I’d rather die trying topreserve the value of life than watch it all end because I failed to do whatonly I can.“Trust in yourself, Merritt. Do what no other but you can do. Use me for whatyou need to complete the key.”He watched her eyes for a long time as lightning flashed and thunder boomed.“You’re something else, Magda Searus.” He slowly shook his head. “You reallyare.”She realized that she was glad he was having a difficult time putting her lifeat risk. She wouldn’t want him to be indifferent.Merritt finally held out a hand, palm up. “Give me your arm.”Magda held her arm out for him. Merritt closed a big hand around her wrist andheld it in a firm grip.“Be still, now,” he said. “I don’t want you to jerk or I might cut too deep.”Magda took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to steady her racingheart. It wasn’t the blade she feared as much as the unknown of the ordeal thatwas to follow. She glanced around, briefly wondering if she would ever see theworld of life again. She met Merritt’s gaze.“I’m ready. Do it.”Without preamble he drew the blade across the inside of her forearm, close toher wrist. She felt the razor-sharp edge bite into her flesh as he dragged itacross her arm, carefully controlling how deeply he cut. It sent a shock of painthrough her. Blood immediately began gushing down her arm. He had cut deeperthan she had expected. She felt faint. She fought the feeling. She knew that shehad to remain conscious.Magda watched the blood flood down her arm, her wrist, down over her palm, tofinally engulf and run off her fingers. She was shocked to see how much bloodthere was.“Hurry, now,” Merritt said, “before you lose too much blood.”Feeling like she was watching herself in a dream, Magda took a couple of stepsaway to begin drawing the outer circle, the one representing the beginning ofthe world of the dead.“No,” Merritt said, holding her shoulders as he guided her back, “I need you tostart in the center. You need to draw the star first.”She looked up at the shadow of his face. “But I thought—”“I know what you thought and ordinarily you would be right, but it can’t bedrawn the way you were taught. This is for something entirely different than theGrace is usually used for. We’re altering the elements involved.” He nodded hisencouragement. “Draw the star first.”Magda had been taught that a Grace was always started with the outer circle,then moved inward through the square to the inner circle to the centraleight-pointed star, and then finally the rays of the gift were drawn from thestar to cross that inner circle, the square, and finally across the outer circleout into the underworld. She had always been told that the Grace was never to bedrawn in any other way, not even casually. The Grace was a serious device thatcarried great importance as well as powerful magic if done by the right people,and especially if done by them in blood.Worried about the implications, Magda nonetheless did as Merritt asked, lettingthe blood drip in a steady line across the sandy ground he had smoothed out. Shewas careful to go slow enough that the lines of blood were unbroken.“Good,” he said. “Now draw the beginning of the world of life around it,touching the points of the star.”Lightning flashing all around, thunder booming, Magda followed his instructions.Wind whipped her hair across her face and she had to pull it back to see whatshe was doing. What the lightning didn’t light for her, the lantern did. Afterthe circle was completed, he had her draw the square, and then the outer circle,where ordinarily a Grace was begun.“Now,” he said, “draw the rays. But you need to begin them out beyond the outercircle, in the world of the dead, pulling the lines inward through the wholething until they touch the points of the star, until they touch creation.”Magda stared at him. “Merritt, are you sure? I’ve never heard of a Grace beingdrawn that way. I’ve never heard of anyone daring to draw the rays inward fromdeath toward the Light of Creation. It seems a sacrilege.”He was nodding. “I know. But that’s what I need you to do. We’re mixingelements, remember? This is what the rift calculations are for. This is why Ineed the seventh-level breach formulas. Hurry, before you lose too much blood.”By the time she was finished, she was feeling decidedly light-headed. Shetingled all over, except for her fingers. They had gone numb.Magda realized that the dim world all around her seemed to be tilting at an oddangle. Merritt caught her in his arms before she hit the ground.He set her down, leaning her against a log off to the side. He placed a handover the cut. “You did good, Magda.”She felt the heavy warmth of magic flowing into her arm.“This will stop the bleeding so that it can start to heal,” he told her. Shecould hardly hear his voice. “While I’m working, I want you to sit right hereand rest. Be strong for me, now. I need you to be strong for the next part.”Magda nodded, but he was already rushing back to the Grace drawn in blood.Her blood."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 66 Magda lay back against the log, watching the lightning flicker deep in theclouds overhead, turning them a greenish color deep inside. The lightning dancedfrom place to place, running in jumping, jagged lines as it ripped across thesky, causing a great cracking, booming sound in its wake. She could feel thedeep rumble of thunder through the sandy ground.Something about that greenish color tickled at the back of her mind, but shecouldn’t seem to bring it forth.When Magda realized that not all the lightning, not all the rumbling roar, wascoming from the sky, she used her elbows against the log to push herself alittle more upright. Standing near the center of the Grace, Merritt was using afinger and thumb to pull a line of light through the air, as if he were pullingyarn from a skein. Before him stood a structure of hundreds of thin lines oflight all connected into a complex scaffolding. It was a verification web beyondthe complexity of any she had seen.Lightning crackled around it, jumping around from point to point on theframework or coming down from the darkness above to connect with it, touchinghere and there, testing, almost as if the threads of lightning were tasting it.In the center of the armature the Sword of Truth floated in the air, a goodlydistance above the ground. It stuck halfway out of the top, turning slowly as ifturning on a spit. As it turned, the blade reflected flashes of the coloredlight from the glowing lines in all directions out across the Grace.As Merritt added more lines, and yet others spontaneously sprang on their ownfrom various points to establish new junctures, the structure grew ever taller,with the sword continuing to rotate inside. Merritt circled around the outsideof the lighted framework, adding bits of lines here and there, pulling some ofthem in arcs from intersection to intersection, as if reinforcing areas hedeemed weak.As the structure began building more rapidly on its own, Merritt raced to thepoints of the star of the Grace and began drawing spell-forms in the sandyground. He used his finger and drew each line with swift precision until theform was complete. He moved from point to point on the star, adding a complexand exacting drawing at each of the points. Each spell-form looked different toher.When all eight had been completed, he returned to the glowing structure, pushingat it here and there with his palms, testing, then carefully adding a line oflight here, another there, to stiffen the whole thing.Magda’s head felt as if it were in a vise. The pressure was painful. She didn’tknow the source of the pain. She wondered whether it was her connection to theGrace and the spells, or simply the loss of blood. She didn’t know what toexpect as she watched the framework continue to build on itself, growing everupward, growing broader at the base. Legs of light grew from the side of theskeleton of lighted lines to anchor themselves at places along the lines of thestar drawn with her blood. She saw blood being drawn up along the beams oflight.Merritt put a finger and thumb together at a spot in the structure and as ifpinching the air itself pulled a radiant line all the way from the glowingscaffolding out and down across the Grace until he attached it at the end of oneof the rays from the star where it crossed the circle representing the world ofthe dead.Magda gasped as she flinched. She gritted her teeth against the stabbing pain.It felt like someone had pushed a knitting needle through her left side andtaken a big stitch. She struggled to breathe against the pain bearing down onher.Merritt quickly returned to the opposite side of the structure and pulledanother line of light from the scaffolding to the end of a ray on that side,where it crossed over into the underworld.Magda gasped again as she felt another stitch at her waist, but this time on theright side. When Merritt pulled the next line of light across the Grace, Magdafelt yet another stitch of pain sear through her in the small of her back. Sheput her hands to the pain, urgently wanting to make it stop, but it didn’t.Overhead dark, cloudy shapes had begun to swirl around the glowing structure ofthe verification web. Threads of lightning flickered from the framework to theshapes moving in a circle high above it as Magda felt yet more stitches of painknitting around her waist coinciding with Merritt pulling lines of light outpast the veil on the Grace. She felt as if she were being sewn to the ground.She could hardly move, hardly breathe.Above them, the lightning in the clouds had the whole sky boiling with awrithing greenish light that seemed to be spreading through the firmament.She saw, then, that the sword had begun to glow with a soft light that pulsedbetween a warm yellow and a green color not unlike that green light deep withinthe clouds overhead.Merritt dropped to his knees, drawing yet more spell-forms at various places inthe Grace. Magda couldn’t move and could barely pull each shallow breath throughgritted teeth. She felt as if she were being torn in half.The rotating dark mass over the structure grew in breadth as it revolved untilit seemed like the entire sky was moving above her. The farthest-out partsrotated more slowly. The closer in toward the glowing web, the faster theyspiraled around. At the center a point of intense greenish light flared.Magda realized that the green color was not merely in the clouds. It seemed asif the very air itself was becoming the same strange tint of green.She remembered then what had been at the back of her mind. Baraccus had told herthat the veil to the world of the dead had glowed a strange green when he hadpassed through it. He had told her that when he had gone though that green wall,that was how he knew that he had crossed over into the underworld. He had calledit the green meadow of the spirits.Magda gasped when she thought she saw a face in the rotating clouds over thestructure. In the billowing green light, she saw another, and then another. Eachhad its mouth wide open, releasing a terrible scream. Each face was distorted inpain and terror. The howls filled the air so that they all joined together intothe sound of the roaring wind.Before long, it seemed as if thousands of vague, filmy corpses were flutteringthrough the spinning air above the glowing structure.The sound they made was unbearable. It was terror, misery, and pain all meltedtogether into one long, ripping howl. The green air seemed packed full ofwrithing, diaphanous figures like so many swimming, squirming, twisting soulsall fighting for space. None of them seemed real, none of them seemed alive, andyet they moved with frenzied purpose.Magda wondered if she had died and was being swallowed up into the spirit world,or if she was suspended, barely alive, beyond the veil in the world of the dead.She wondered if this was what it had been like for Baraccus.The air above the sword ignited with a massive jet of flame that shot upward.Even at the distance she was, the heat of it felt as if it might burn her fleshfrom her bones.The sword heated to white hot. It glowed brighter than anything else, even thebolts of lightning. It was so bright it hurt her eyes. Above it the sky burnedwith reddish orange flame that turned and churned, blackening as it rolled away,replaced by yet more bright orange fire continually boiling forth.The ground around the glowing verification web seethed with a carpet of bluishflame that flickered and jumped.In the center of it, Merritt raced through the walls of flame to pull more linesand draw yet more spell-forms. The world seemed an inferno, while forms in thegreenish light howled in fury and agony.Magda could feel waves of heat off the white-hot, glowing sword rolling overher. The blade glowed incandescent.Magda thought that surely the heat was burning her lungs. The air above them wasa rotating, turning, churning ceiling of flame. The noise of it was deafening.Black lightning, as dark as death itself, crackled through it all as it arcedfrom the fire above to the hilt of the sword. Every time the black lightningtouched it, the blade went momentarily just as black. Magda knew that she wasseeing Subtractive Magic called to life before her.Black lightning erupted from points of the Grace outside the outer ring to arcto the pommel of the glowing sword. Every crackling, twisting streak of it feltas if it was born in her very soul.At the same time, blinding flashes of bright lightning grounded at the pommel ofthe sword exploded skyward with earsplitting booms. The blade looked as if itmight explode from all the heat and the mix of lightning from different worlds.Merritt stood then and lifted his arms. As he drew his arms upward, over andover, great columns of water erupted from the pond, pouring up and over thesword. As the waves of water broke over the sword and the structure, she couldsee the glowing sword through the water.Clouds of steam billowed up as more and more water funneled up from the pond ina twisting column that cascaded over the sword.The flashes of white-hot and inky black lightning hurt her eyes. The thunderousnoise hurt her ears. The sword smoked and steamed with a howling sound thatmatched that of the spirits twisting through the greenish air.Magda’s head felt as if it might explode. The stitches of pain in her side hurtso much she couldn’t draw a breath. It felt like a great weight was crushing herchest, preventing her from drawing air into her lungs.Everything began to dim. Even though she knew that all the sight and sound wasstill going on, it seemed ever more distant.And then, the Sword of Truth suddenly plunged straight down toward the ground.Magda screamed. As the sword fell, it felt as if an iron spike were being drivendown through the top of her head, through her insides, and right into the coreof her soul.Like a great iron door slamming closed, the world went from green to black."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 67 Magda was dimly aware that she was lying on something soft. She slitted hereyes, squinting. The light hurt her eyes.She was shivering all over. She realized that for some reason she was not simplycold but also soaking wet. She remembered, then, that it had started raining fatdrops of icy rain when they had been out in the woods. She didn’t think that shewas still in the woods, but she was having difficulty, between bouts ofshivering, trying to figure out where she was.She saw the hazy figure of Merritt moving about not far away. It was comfortingto see him.Her vision wouldn’t focus but she could make out a table and a chair. There wasa bit of red on the table. She saw statues, stacks of books, scrolls, bones, andall sorts of strange devices sitting everywhere around the floor. There were litcandles around the room, too, some on low tables, some on the tops of shortpillars, some on the table.As the room came more into focus, she realized that she was on the wicker couchin Merritt’s home. She had no recollection of how she had gotten there.Merritt came closer and quietly bent over her a little, moving his hands in theair above her, sweeping them from her head downward. As his hands moved, shefelt her frigid, soaking-wet dress turn dry. By the time he had worked his waydown to her feet, she was completely dry. The bone-chilling cold melted away asa calming, radiant warmth seeped back into her bones.But she still hurt everywhere.“Am I still alive?” she managed.Merritt turned to look at her. He smiled.“Quite alive. We’re at my place, in Aydindril. It was closer than trying to makeit to the Keep. I wanted to get you in out of the rain. It was quite the storm.You were in trouble. The reaction of all the elements combining was greater thanI had hoped, but not as bad as I had feared. The breach held.”His fingers touched her shoulder. “You were strong, Magda. You did good. But Iwas afraid to try to make it to the Keep.”“You carried me?”He nodded. “I didn’t think . . . well, I thought it best to get you in out ofthe rain here, and see to making sure that you’re all right as soon aspossible.”“The sword,” she said, licking her cracked lips.“What about it?”“Did it work, Merritt? Were you able to complete the key?”His handsome smile widened. “Thanks to you, yes. Thanks to your strength anddetermination I was able to do it.”“You did it . . .”“We did it.” He squeezed her hand. “I’ve healed you, but more than anything youneed to rest, now. I can’t use magic to give you that, and you desperately needit.”In the dim recesses of her memory, she recalled him holding her head in hishands as he worked to save her. She had been healed before, so she had knownwhat he had been doing. His touch, though, felt different from any healing shehad felt before. It had fierce intensity, yet a warmth to it that calmed her andlet her relax so that he could do as he needed.She could remember only bits and pieces of him bent over her, holding her head,as the rain poured down on them. She did remember, though, how much she hurt,and how terrified she had been that she would die there in the dark woods.Magda didn’t know what had needed healing, but she was aware that for a time shehad been on the other side of the veil of life.Merritt had come after her and brought her back.“Is it still night?” she asked.“No,” he said. “It’s morning.”“Morning?” Magda tried to push herself up on her elbows, but she couldn’t seemto muster the strength. “Merritt, we have to go. We need to get to the dungeon.We need to find that sorceress who defected. If she’s even still alive. If sheis, they could execute her at any time.”Merritt’s hand on her shoulder gently pushed her back down. “I know, but rightnow you have to rest. I healed you, but if you are to recover, you still need torest. I can’t do that part for you, and you can’t do anything if you don’tfinish getting better, first.”There was something serious about his tone. She looked up to his face. His eyesrevealed the level of his concern. The look in his hazel eyes gave her a rippleof terror.“Am I going to be all right? Am I going to live?”A touch of his smile returned. “If you rest. Your body needs sleep to fullyrecover.”Magda narrowed her eyes, peering, trying to focus her still-blurry vision to seethe sword at his hip. Trying to focus her eyes gave her sharp pains in hertemples. She didn’t see the scabbard there at his hip.Merritt saw where she was looking and gestured. “It’s hung on the chair.”“Please,” she managed past the pain in her throat. “Can I see it? I want totouch it.”Merritt scratched his temple. “Sure.”He went to the chair sitting before the table with the red velvet where thesword used to lie. When he drew the blade from its scabbard hanging on thechair, the room filled with the clear ring of steel. It sounded the same, yetsomehow different. The ring had a nature to it that resonated with somethingdeep inside her.He brought the sword to her, holding it out in both open hands. Magda reached upand touched the hilt, running her fingers over the raised letters of the wordTruth.She stretched both hands toward it, wanting it, needing it. Merritt let her liftit from his hands.Magda laid the blade down the length of her body, feeling the satisfying weightof it against her. The hilt rested on her chest just beneath her chin. At thatmoment, after all she had been through, it was more comforting than any blanket.Knowing that it was now complete was gratifying beyond words.She held the hilt with both hands, letting the deep satisfaction of knowing thatthey had done it seep through her.Merritt had accomplished the near impossible. The key was complete. Magda hadmanaged to do her small part to help him and as a result the Sword of Truth wasnow complete.Though she was ungifted, she could clearly feel the power of the magic the swordnow possessed. It was power unlike anything she had ever imagined. It churnedthe way the storm had. It held more power than the storm had. It was fury andrage and love and life all folded together, over and over, blending them intothe finest layers of something new, something remarkable.This was now a weapon unlike any other, more than any other.It felt so good holding it, knowing that they had done it, that she never wantedto let it go.Magda let out a deep breath of contentment and, with the Sword of Truth held inboth hands, lying down the length of her, listening to the steady drumming ofrain on the roof, she allowed herself to succumb to sleep."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 68 “Are you sure that you’re all right?” Merritt asked in a quiet voice as theymade their way up the broad hallway. “I know I would feel more confident in yourrecovery if you had gotten more rest. You’ve been through quite an ordeal.”This section of the Keep was reserved for the Home Guard. The hall was simplestone block walls, beamed ceilings, and plank floors. There were barracks,dining halls, and assembly rooms down various corridors. As they passedintersections, she saw that some of the halls were filled with soldiers. Ironbrackets held torches with flames that flapped in the breeze as they passed. Thehall smelled musty, punctuated with the heavy aroma of pitch each time theypassed a hissing torch.Two soldiers in polished armor breastplates over blue tunics, their heads bentclose in a confidential conversation, were walking swiftly toward them. Magdawaited until they passed and were out of earshot before she answered Merritt.“I’m fine,” she said. “Really. Stop asking me, would you?”As they marched down the long corridor Merritt glanced over with a skepticalexpression but didn’t answer. From time to time he looked over at her out of thecorner of his eye, as if checking to make sure she was still upright.Magda wished it weren’t so late. She had slept the entire day, and on into thenight. No matter how much she might need rest, she didn’t want to sleep anymore. She was strong enough to do what had to be done. That was all that reallymattered at the moment.“Don’t I look fine?” she asked.Merritt finally smiled. “Yes, you certainly do look fine.” His face reddened. “Imean, you look like you’ve regained your strength.”Magda smiled at his look of embarrassment.Truth be told, she didn’t feel at all fine. She was so exhausted that she couldhardly put one foot in front of the other, but she was more concerned that thesorceress from the Old World might be executed before they could get to her. Itmight be their only chance to get information about what the enemy was up to.She couldn’t afford to worry about how tired she was when there was so much atstake.Despite the late hour, she expected General Grundwall to still be up. She knewhim to be ferociously dedicated to his duty of protecting the Keep and those wholived and worked there. She remembered Baraccus often reminding GeneralGrundwall to get some sleep or he wouldn’t be good for anything. The man rarelytook the gentle reminders to heart.By the clusters of men crowded around the archway to the Home Guard’sheadquarters, she was sure he would be there. Some of the soldiers in bluetunics and light armor clutched papers or scrolls, waiting to give the generaltheir reports. Other men were gathering for their patrols. The dozens ofreflector lamps along the stone walls outside the archway reflected sparkles oflight off polished armor and weapons that all the men carried. It was adecidedly male environment that made her feel out of place.As Magda and Merritt made their way up the corridor, past soldiers coming andgoing as well as clusters of men discussing their work and their plans for thenight, she spotted the general coming out of the arched opening to hisheadquarters. He was average height, but built like an oak tree, with thick armsand a neck that started flaring right from his ears down into his broadshoulders. She thought that he looked like a man who could shove a mountainaside if it was in his way.He spoke to various people with brief, direct orders, sending men on specifictypes of patrols, or telling officers how he wanted watches run, or takingpapers with reports from waiting men even as he was talking to others. Hescanned each report and thanked the man giving it. Before long he had a sheaf ofpapers in his big fist.When General Grundwall spotted Magda weaving her way through the swarm ofsoldiers, his face lit up with a big grin.Magda instantly went on alert.The general smiling like that was out of character. He was a serious soldier,healthy and fit despite the gray at his temples. He often rode with his men orwalked miles and miles of patrols through the Keep with them, up and downcountless stairs as he checked that his people were safe. He was focused andserious. He was not a man to smile casually.Since the strange deaths at the Keep, he was, if anything, short-tempered. Hefelt that the murders reflected poorly on him personally. That the deathscontinued put him continually on edge.But here he was grinning as if he were at a ball and full of wine.“Lady Searus! So glad to see you,” he said as he rushed up to her.Merritt, standing beside her, made the general look not nearly as big andmuscular as she had always thought of him.“General Grundwall, can we speak privately? I need to ask you something.”“Of course, of course,” he said, still grinning as he gestured expansively,urging her into an alcove to the side that held several statues of famoussoldiers from history.Before she could say anything, the general, still grinning, did.“I must congratulate you, Lady Searus.”If Magda had been on alert before, now she was alarmed. Again, the general spokebefore she had a chance to ask what he meant.“It’s wonderful news, simply wonderful. Just what the Keep needed. It lifted thegloom.”Magda was not merely bewildered, she was becoming ever more apprehensive. Shethought it best to be as careful as possible.“And how did you hear the news, General?”He straightened with a proud grin and hooked his thumbs on his weapons belt.“Prosecutor Lothain told me himself.”Magda had to force herself not to act startled. “He did?”General Grundwall nodded. He glanced around to make sure no one was close enoughto hear him.“I have to say, I’ve been worried about matters here at the Keep, but now, withyou to marry our new First Wizard, I have been put at ease.” He held up his handas he glanced around again. “Don’t worry, I haven’t told my men yet that Lothainis to be named First Wizard. I know that the news is supposed to be saved for anannouncement at the council session.“But the biggest news, as far as I’m concerned, is that you will once again bethe wife of our First Wizard. I can’t tell you how relieved I am at that news.”Out of the corner of her eye, Magda shared a look with Merritt.She couldn’t help herself. “Why are you relieved?”His brow lifted. “Lady Searus, you are widely respected. You may not be aware ofit, but your word is widely listened to and valued. People know of all the timesyou have spoken with measured reason before the council, oftentimes being theirconscience. You have always spoken for those who have no voice before thecouncil. That has earned you the quiet respect of many people in the Keep.“A lot of people had doubts about Lothain, and what you had to say about himbefore, and, well, your words put voice to the concerns of many. At the sametime, though, there are others who believe in Lothain, believe that he is oursavior for going after all the traitors among us. Those people, who believe inLothain, would like to cut your throat. I have worried greatly for your safetybecause true believers are often quite vicious.“But Lothain explained it all to me. He made it clear how your grief overBaraccus’s suicide weighed terribly on your nerves, that’s all. As he says, suchdeep grief can make even good people act out in misguided ways and so they mustbe forgiven.“But by your marrying him, it will settle the matter and end any misgivingsabout Lothain being named First Wizard. People will be very pleased to have thereassurance of your confidence in him. After all, you’re marrying him!” Hethumped his chest with a fist. “I’m reassured and pleased! I have to tell you,it will really quiet things down in the Keep. I can’t tell you how happy I amfor you, and that you once again are to be wife to the First Wizard.”Magda did her best to conceal her rage.“And who have we here?” the general asked as his typical suspicious gaze turnedto Merritt.“I’m Merritt,” Merritt said with a pleasant smile, a smile that she could seewas forced.Merritt held out his hand. General Grundwall, still looking suspicious, shookthe hand.“Merritt is a maker,” Magda said, drawing the general’s attention back to her.“Since I have no use for them, I am giving Baraccus’s tools to Merritt, here. Hewill be able to put them to good use.”“Ah,” the general said with a nod indicating that his suspicion had beenallayed. “Well that’s a nice thing to do. I’m sure that First Wizard Baraccuswould have wanted that.”“That’s what I thought,” Magda said.General Grundwall leaned close. “Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?”Magda was taken off guard, and her mind suddenly raced for an answer.If this man was now on the side of Lothain, she couldn’t very well trust him totake her to see the sorceress that Lothain was intent on putting to death. Shemomentarily considered taking him into her confidence and telling him that shehad no intention, under any circumstances, of marrying Lothain. She was furiousat Lothain for having the audacity to tell people that she was going to marryhim.As he stared at her, waiting for her answer, she reminded herself to focus. Shecouldn’t take the chance of trusting him.“Well,” she said, “I was taking Merritt to show him Baraccus’s tools, like Isaid. We were passing nearby, and I hoped to run into you. I wanted to ask youif you had found the man who had murdered Isidore, the spiritist.”“Oh, the spiritist.” The general frowned. “No. We’ve not been able to findanything at all. Even more disturbing, she is not the only one to be murdered insuch a horrific fashion.”Magda let out a disappointed sigh. “I’m sorry to hear that the killer is stillon the loose in the Keep. I was hoping he would have been caught by now.”The general nodded grimily. “A number of wizards working in the lower parts ofthe Keep, and even a few a bit higher up, have been murdered.”“Murdered. By ‘murdered,’ do you mean . . . murdered like Isidore was murdered?In that same fashion?”“That’s right. Ripped apart. They aren’t the only ones. I’ve had two patrolskilled as well.”Surprised, Magda leaned in a little. “Patrols? You mean soldiers? Armedsoldiers?”He folded his meaty arms. “That’s right. One of the patrols had three men, thenseveral days later a patrol of four men was also attacked and killed. They weretorn apart. Blood, guts, and brains everywhere in the hallway where theirremains were found. We didn’t even know which body parts went with which men. Wecouldn’t even identify the remains, and only determined who they were when wetook a head count.”“Dear spirits,” she whispered. “That’s terrible. I’m so sorry to hear aboutthis. And you have no suspects?”“None. None at all.” His gaze had turned abruptly penetrating and uncomfortable.“And you say the man who did it, the man you saw kill Isidore, was a dead man?”Magda shrugged, trying not to be argumentative. This was not the time or place.There were more important considerations.“He looked dead to me. That’s all I can tell you. I suppose that maybe he wasjust disheveled and filthy. Maybe he used magic. Maybe that’s why he appeared sostrong and could do what he did.”“Ah.” The general nodded thoughtfully. “That makes sense.”“It’s quite frightening to hear that no one has been caught.”He peered at Merritt for a moment and then again eyed Magda carefully. “Are youall right? You look . . . I don’t know, tired.”“I am tired, I’m afraid. A lot has been going on in my life recently.”His grin returned. “I understand.”Magda could feel her renewed flash of anger heat her face.“Well, I must be going. Merritt here wants to pick up his tools and be on hisway. I probably should get some rest.”“Of course, Lady Searus,” the general said with a bow of his head. “Once again,my congratulations on your imminent marriage to our soon-to-be new First Wizard.I’m sure that everyone else at the Keep will be just as happy and relieved atthis news as I am. People think a great deal of you, and will be encouraged byyour decision.”Magda nodded. “Thank you, General Grundwall.”Before he could say anything else, Magda turned and headed away. Merritt jumpedto quickly follow after her and stay at her side."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 69 Magda fisted her hands in fury as she marched away. She and Merritt passedgroups of soldiers coming in the other direction as she resolutely made her waydown the stone corridor.“What was all that about?” Merritt finally asked. He sounded about as angry asshe felt.“Isn’t it obvious? There must have been opposition to Lothain being named FirstWizard. Apparently, he’s trying to quell dissent, shore up his support, and winpeople over. It appears to be working. Grundwall thinks it’s going to be goodfor the people of the Keep. Lothain is no doubt counting on just that attitude.“He probably thinks that when I see how pleased everyone is, how it easestensions and reassures people in a time of crisis, I will have no choice but togo along with his plan. He knows that I care about the people here. He’s tryingto shame me into doing it for the good of the Keep.”“But you’re not going to actually do it,” Merritt said.It didn’t sound like a question. Magda frowned over at him. “Are you out of yourmind?”He heaved a sigh of bottled exasperation. “Where are we going, anyway?”“To the dungeon.”“The dungeon?” Merritt grabbed her arm and pulled her to an abrupt halt. Hechecked both ways to make sure none of the soldiers coming and going from theHome Guard headquarters were close enough to hear them. “Are you crazy?”Magda squared up to him. “Look, Merritt, we’re running out of time. If thatwoman is still alive, we have to get to her before they execute her.” She threwher hands up. “I already wasted the entire day sleeping, we can’t afford towaste any more time.”“It wasn’t a waste,” he said in a tone meant to calm her down. “It kept you fromdying.”Magda took a breath, trying to calm her anger over the things the general hadsaid. She didn’t want Merritt to think she was angry with him, or blamed him forwhat they’d had to do. Merritt was the only one who believed her and he wastrying to help. She lowered her voice.“I suppose, and I’m grateful, I really am. You healed me, and I’m better. I knowI need more rest to be back to myself, but right now it doesn’t matter howexhausted I am. We may never get another chance. We have to get to thatsorceress.”Merritt nodded as he visibly cooled off. “I understand and I share your sense ofurgency. After all, I’m the one who told you about the sorceress defector in thefirst place, remember?”“I remember.”“So, how do you propose we get in to see her without General Grundwall? Theydon’t simply let people in to see prisoners.”A group of soldiers hurried past, eyeing the woman in the midst of their domain.She flashed them a brief, polite smile of greeting. Most of the men returned thesmile. Once they were past, Magda pulled the hood of her cloak up over her headand started out once more. She peeked around the edge of the hood at Merritt.“You heard the general. I’m respected. It’s news to me, but maybe not to the mendown in the dungeon. They certainly won’t be expecting a woman—the wife of theirdead First Wizard—to show up in their midst in the middle of the night.”Merritt looked to be getting agitated again. “And what good is that going to doyou?”“Surprise is sometimes the best advantage a warrior can have.”He eyed her suspiciously. “Where did you hear that?”“Baraccus told me.”“He’s right, but this is different from what is typically meant by that saying.”“That’s why this surprise will work to our advantage.”“And if it doesn’t?”Magda took his arm, leaning closer to him as they started down the stone stepsof a broad stairway. Their footsteps echoed through the stairwell, so she kepther voice low.“Merritt, we have to try. Time is working against us. If they haven’t executedher before, or even today while I was sleeping the day away, they will surelybehead her soon, maybe even tomorrow. We can’t delay. If they’ve tried her andcondemned her to death, they’re not going to keep her alive down in the dungeonfor long—a few days at most. Every day we don’t get to her adds to the odds thatwe never will. Maybe she doesn’t know anything and can’t help us, but what ifshe does know something about what’s going on here at the Keep, or EmperorSulachan’s battle plans?“By the way she was tried without the public knowing about it, someone must havea reason to want to get rid of her. After all, why wouldn’t Lothain want to tryher publicly so he could add another executed traitor to his list of heraldedaccomplishments? Could he be doing a favor? Or protecting someone? Maybe evenprotecting himself? Why was the trial conducted out of the public eye?”“I was wondering those same things.” Merritt looked both up and down thestairwell to make sure no one was near. “What we really have to ask ourselves iswhy they’ve let her live this long.”“What do you mean?”“If they charged her with being a spy and sentenced her to death, maybe it’sbecause someone has a reason to want her dead. Maybe it’s to shut her up. So ifthat’s true, and they want to shut her up, then why didn’t they just put her todeath immediately after finding her guilty?” Merritt leaned closer and archedand eyebrow. “If they want her dead, then why have they kept her alive for thislong?”It dawned on her what Merritt was implying. “You mean you think they’retorturing her? You think they haven’t killed her yet because they’re torturinginformation out of her?”“Wouldn’t any spy in the Keep want to know if she has any companions defectingwith her, and if she does how much they know about the people Emperor Sulachanmight have secretly slipped in here? Nor will killing her solve their problem ifshe’s already spoken with people here at the Keep and given them names oftraitors working on behalf of the emperor. They would need to know that beforethey killed her, don’t you suppose?”Magda glanced over at him. “For a traitor, worried about being discovered,finding out how much she knows would be reason enough to torture her.”Merritt waved a hand. “But this is all speculation. For all we know, maybe shereally is a spy, or even an assassin, posing as a defector, intent on using hergift to kill our leaders. Maybe they wanted to keep the trial out of the publiceye in order to find any accomplices. Maybe they did a good thing by uncoveringher plans. For all we know, they may very well have beheaded her right in thebeginning—right after convicting her. We don’t know that she’s even alive.”“All the more reason to get down to the dungeons as soon as we can. We may neverget another chance to find out the truth. Maybe she is an assassin, but maybeshe really is a defector who wants to help us. And if they’re torturing her, shemay soon enough be as good as dead as far as helping us is concerned.”Merritt considered her words as they continued down the broad stairs leading tothe lower levels. The stairwell was a core passage used by the Home Guard tomove quickly between different areas of the Keep. As they kept taking flightafter flight down, several patrols passed them going up.“I don’t like it,” Merritt said after a group of half a dozen soldiers, climbingthe stairs two at a time, were far enough above them not to be able to overhear,“but I have to admit that what you say makes sense. We won’t know the answers toany of it—if she’s still alive and if she is, is she in any condition to talk tous—unless we get down there and see for ourselves.”“The thing that worries me,” Magda said, “is that these dungeon guards might notnecessarily be the reasonable type.”“Likely not, actually. That’s why they’re chosen for the task in the firstplace. Some very nasty criminals and killers are kept down there before beingput to death. Those guards need to be tough men.”When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Magda headed to the broadestcorridor. It led to the immense chamber down in the heart of the lower Keep.Their shadows from the torchlight rotated around them as they moved swiftly downthe simple hall.“That’s what I mean,” Magda said. “I’m not sure they will have any desire to letus in. But, on the other hand, they are liable to be so surprised to see me downthere that we may be able to bluff our way through.”“I’d prefer that to having to kill them,” he said under his breath.Magda blinked in surprise. “Kill them? They’re on our side, Merritt. They’re ourmen.”“How do you know that? What if the traitors in the Keep had those men placedthere to keep the likes of you and me away from their dirty work. You saidyourself that something terrible is going on at the Keep and there seem to be anumber of people involved. This woman might have some answers about that andthat’s why she’s in the dungeon. So who are we up against? Who’s keeping herthere? Who is involved in wanting her dead?“We’re at war. We can’t afford to fail or we could easily end up dead, alongwith all the innocent people of the Midlands.“Those guards down there may be our men, or they very well may be working for atraitor—for the enemy. With what we’re doing, we’ve already crossed a lot oflines, here.“And don’t forget,” Merritt added, “we’re probably dealing with an enemy whostole the power of Orden. This sorceress may know something about all that. Shemay know who has the boxes or where they are. If we’re really serious, then wecan’t be halfhearted. We dare not let this chance slip away, no matter who getsin our way. If we go down there and those guards won’t let us in to see thiswoman, we may have to end up killing them.”Magda sighed in frustration. “You’re right. If we don’t discover the enemy’splans before it’s too late, everyone could die. The risk is too great. We’regoing to have to do what is necessary.” She looked over at him as they turneddown a carpeted corridor. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.”“Hope isn’t a plan. We have to get in and to do that we may need to kill theguards.”“I’d rather bluff my way in.”“If it works, I’m with you. But I need to be ready to have your back.”“Magic doesn’t work in the dungeon,” she reminded him. “The dungeons areshielded to prevent any gifted prisoner from using magic to escape, or from anygifted ally of a prisoner from getting in and using their magic to break themout. Down in the dungeons, it’s muscle that matters. That’s why they have thekind of guards they do down there.”Without looking over at her, he said, “The sword will still work down there.When they crafted the shields, they didn’t shield against the magic I investedin the sword.”“How do you know?”“Because it didn’t exist at the time. No one had ever thought of the kind ofpower I put into the sword until I did. It never existed until I created it, soit’s impossible for them to have shielded against it.”“So if you have a way to defeat our shields, it would be foolish to think theenemy didn’t as well.”“That thought had occurred to me.”Magda nodded, already thinking about the journey down into the lower reaches ofthe Keep, into the place of the dead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 70 Magda’s legs ached from the long descent down into the place of the dead. Shewas so exhausted that at times she thought she might fall over. She knew thatwhat she was feeling was more than normal fatigue. She hated to think about theeventual long climb back up.Magda knew that Merritt was telling her the truth about needing rest to completeher recovery from the ordeal of creating the key. Healing alone hadn’t beenenough. From little things he had done at the time, to hints in the way he hadacted, she suspected that the use of her blood and life force in the effort tocreate the key had come close to costing her her life.Before she could rest, though, they needed to get down to the dungeon. That wasthe prime concern. If the sorceress was still alive, they had to talk to her.The deserted corridor they hurried through, carved from banded, tannishsandstone, created a maze of twisting passageways. None of the walls were squareor straight. For the most part, the passageways were little more than a warrenof tunnels gouged out through the stone.She hadn’t been in these particular underground passages the last time she’dcome down into the catacombs. This area was considerably deeper beneath thesection she’d been in before, where not only were there resting places for thedead, but rooms where wizards also worked. That level was also where Isidore’splace had been.Over time, as ever more people had died, the available space in the catacombshad been filled to capacity. The living then had to dig even deeper to createmore room for the newly deceased. That meant that some of the areas they wereentering were not nearly as old as the places above that she had seen before. Upabove, some of the tombs were centuries old. Some were said to be thousands ofyears old. Magda didn’t know if that much was true or not, but it was clearenough that some sections of the catacombs higher up were ancient.This part, though, was newer. In fact, it was repulsively new. The stagnantstench of death hung in the air down in this place. Even the scent of the stoneall around and the smell of burning pitch from the occasional torches stuck inholes drilled in the soft rock of the walls as well as pots of aromatic oils wasnot enough to mask the smell of death. In spots, some of the rooms they passedwith the recently dead reeked so strongly of rotting flesh that it gagged herand spurred her to hurry past.As they made their way through the tunnels, Magda couldn’t help glancing offinto the dark recesses where the dead were laid to rest. The light sphereMerritt carried cast a greenish glow into the hollowed-out chambers. In thetunnels, the light sphere helped fill in shadowy stretches between torches.In that greenish light, Magda could see countless corpses lying in niches. Someof the dusty finery was filled with bones and nothing more. In other places, thedead were desiccated, with mouths hanging open and eye sockets staring up atnothing. In some of the rooms they passed, the places that smelled the worst,the bodies had grotesquely swollen tongues protruding from gaping mouths andeyes bulging out of sockets. It was a natural process that bodies went throughas they rotted, but it was horrifying to see. It was one of the reasons she wasglad that they had reduced Baraccus’s remains to ashes.Magda speculated that the sights they passed were also one of the reasons thedungeons were down below the catacombs. As prisoners were brought down throughthe place of the dead, the rotting corpses would be a demoralizing spectaclemeant to be a disturbing preview to the living being taken to the dungeon of thefate awaiting them if they caused any trouble. Or a reminder to those condemnedto death of what they would soon look like.Magda only hoped that those condemned really were guilty. If they were guilty ofmurders, then they deserved their fate. But such an end was too horrifying forher to contemplate if the condemned were actually innocent. She knew that guiltwas not always clear-cut, and there were instances where people wondered if thetrue guilty party had avoided paying the price, and an innocent person wasinstead being put to an unjust death.It seemed like an endless spectacle of corpses as they made their way down thetunneled hallway. It was numbing to see so many dead people.Magda missed a step and then jerked to a halt. She stood frozen in place. Therealization ran an icy shiver up between her shoulder blades to the nape of herneck. With the sudden comprehension, she could feel her hands begin to tremble.Her heart started beating faster.Merritt turned, holding the light sphere up to better see her face and to lookinto her wide eyes.He leaned down a little. “What’s wrong?”Magda glanced around at all the niches carved out of the stone, all filled withremains of the dead.“General Grundwall said they hadn’t found the man who killed Isidore.”“That’s right,” he said.Magda met his gaze. “That night, when I was lost in the maze outside herquarters, a lot of men—wizards, wizards with gifted abilities to sense theliving—came to see what the commotion was all about. They fanned out andsearched the maze. They didn’t find anyone. General Grundwall says that theyhaven’t found those responsible for the murders.”“I’m listening.”“How is that possible? I mean, really? How in the world is that possible? Howcould a killer like that vanish? The Keep is a big place, and there are tunnelseverywhere down in the lower reaches as well as down here in the catacombs, butstill, they’ve had a lot of soldiers searching day and night. Think about it.How could the killer evade all those searchers? How did the killer manage tovanish so easily each time he struck?”“Well, I don’t know but even with all the soldiers—”“What if the killer really was dead?”Merritt stood staring at her. He glanced to the rooms filled with the dead. “Youmean, like these dead, here?” he finally said. “Dead, dead?”Magda gestured to one of the rooms beside them. There were dozens and dozens ofdesiccated corpses lying inside in various degrees of decay, some with handscrossed over their chests, others with arms at their sides, all with dead eyesstaring at nothing. Some had been reduced to almost nothing but bones. Yet some,dark and dried-out, didn’t look at all unlike the man Magda had seen murderIsidore.“Yes. What if,” she said, lowering her voice, “what if the killer was one ofthese dead men. What if, after he killed, he simply went back to his restingplace down here and, well, resumed being dead? He would have vanished in ourmidst. How would anyone find him? How would anyone know who it was?”“They would have the blood of the victims on them,” Merritt pointed out.“No one searched all the dead to see if they had fresh blood on them,” Magdascoffed. “No one believed me that it was a dead man who killed Isidore.”“That’s true. After the murders, the soldiers searched for a killer, but no onechecked all the corpses, looking for fresh blood.”“If it wasn’t discovered soon enough, any evidence of fresh blood would soondeteriorate. In many cases, it might just look like natural decomposition andfluids seeping from the dead. The blood of the victims would become part of thedead.” She gestured to a nearby room. “I mean, look at them. Yes, some are neatand tidy, but with a lot of these bodies looking like they do, it would be hardto spot fresh blood on them. Within a short time, you couldn’t see it even ifyou were looking for it.”Merritt slowly shook his head as he peered in rooms. “Dear spirits, Magda, Iwish that didn’t make so much sense.”“You told me that the shields wouldn’t stop your sword because they weren’t madeto stop the magic it contained.”“That’s right.”“There are shields everywhere in the Keep. Think about it, what are the shieldsmade to stop?”“The enemy,” he said.“What enemy?”Merritt grasped her meaning. “The living enemy. The shields work by detectinglife. They can’t detect something that isn’t alive, something dead.”“With the war going on and the attacks in the Keep, as a safeguard the councilordered new shields placed all over. I’ve had to make detours to get aroundshielded areas.” Magda lifted a finger. “Yet, it hasn’t halted the murders, hasit? Or helped soldiers trap the killer. The shields wouldn’t stop a dead man.The shields wouldn’t even be able to detect one, would they?”“No, they wouldn’t. Something dead wouldn’t even set off any of the alarms, muchless the shields. After all, why would an alarm need to be set off to warn ofthe dead?”“What do shields do to intruders?” Magda asked.“Some of the shields are set to kill any unauthorized person who tries to pass.”He arched an eyebrow. “But you have to be alive to be killed.”“What is it that Isidore was searching for, looking into? What were the wizardsthat she was helping trying to do?”Merritt showed her his ring with the Grace on it. “They are trying to interferewith this. They are altering the natural order of things, the flow of life andmagic and death. I haven’t heard a lot of specifics about what they were doing,but I assumed they were looking into what Isidore was so worried about—the deadthe enemy took and their missing spirits.”“From rumors I’ve heard,” Magda said, “wizards down in the lower reaches havebeen working to try to bring the dead back to life. Or an imitation of life,anyway.“I wonder if it could be that some of those experiments have gone terriblywrong. I wonder if that is the source of the murders.”Merritt stared at her for a long, uncomfortable moment before he gestured withthe light sphere. “We’d better get down to the dungeon.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 71 The chiseled stone of the narrow passageway cut through the granular granitebedrock of the mountain beneath the Keep was not only darker but much harderthan the extensive vein of fine, tan sandstone of the catacombs up above them.This was not a place that had been so easily carved out, as were thesubterranean galleries for the dead higher up. This place had required a greatdeal of muscle, sweat, and effort to construct.All to confine evil. At least, that had been the original intent.The smell of stale sweat and acrid rat droppings permeated the dark, dank tunneljust above the entrance to the dungeon. Magda wrapped her cloak tighter againstthe chill air and wrinkled her nose at the stink. When they reached the ironstairs at the end of the single shaft she started down without hesitation.Gritty rust and crumbled bits of remaining paint from the iron railing stainedher hands.At the bottom of the long, steep descent, a pair of burly men waited. They hadclearly heard the visitors to the dungeon approaching. Both were shirtless, andas round-shouldered and hairy as bears. In the illumination of the light sphereMerritt carried, their white eyes peered out from dark, grimy faces stained bysoot from torches. They were clearly surprised to see a woman and suspicious ofMerritt.An oil lamp sitting off to the side on a small, simple plank table provided theonly light. It wasn’t much, and so the men, used to the near darkness, squintedin the relatively bright light Merritt was holding. They were as filthy as apair of moles.Before the men could speak, Magda did. “You have a woman prisoner, a spy. We’rehere to see her.”The two guards shared a look, surprised that it had been she and not Merritt whohad spoken.“Prisoners don’t get to have visitors,” the first guard said in a gravellyvoice.“I’m not a visitor,” Magda told him. She kept her voice cold and unfriendly. “Iam here to question her.”In ill humor, the man planted his fists on his hips.“Prisoners don’t generally answer questions, either.” He grinned as he glancedover his shoulder at the second guard. “Unless it’s under torture.”They both chuckled.Magda knew that she had to be bold in her bluff if it was to work. She hadconvinced Merritt to go along with her plan and follow her lead, so he wasletting her do the talking. She reasoned that it would be unexpected and thusmore convincing coming from her than from a man. Although he had agreed, Merrittstood ready if it didn’t work. Not speaking, resting a palm on the hilt of hisever-present sword, towering just behind her left shoulder, he looked quiteforbidding.Magda leaned toward the grinning man, putting her face close to his, looked himin the eye, and gritted her teeth. “Then I will have to torture the bitch, nowwon’t I?”He blinked in surprise. He opened his mouth to say something, but before hecould, Magda again spoke first.“Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea who you are talking to?”His thick brow drew lower. “Yes, I’m talking to—”Merritt, off to the side and just behind her, gestured from side to side withhis fingertips across his throat, a warning to the man not to say anything tomake her angry. It apparently looked convincing, because the man paused andreconsidered what he had been about to say. He poked his tongue out betweenmissing bottom teeth to swipe at his lower lip, unsure what to do.The second man, picking up on Merritt’s warning, spoke up instead. “I’m afraidthat, no, we don’t know who you are. You have us at a disadvantage.”Magda pushed the hood of her cloak back off her head.“I am Magda Searus.”The first man’s brow came up a little. “Wife to dead First Wizard Baraccus?”“Well, yes,” she said as she flicked her hand, dismissing the importance of thatmuch of it. “But more to the point, as far as you gentlemen are concerned, I amsoon to be the wife of our soon-to-be new First Wizard.”“New First Wizard.” His brow drew back down. “What would you be talking about?”She turned to Merritt. “Don’t they tell the guards down here anything?” WhenMerritt shrugged, she turned back to the guard and again leaned toward him. “I’mtalking about Prosecutor Lothain.”Both men backed away a bit at the name. They clearly knew who Lothain was, andthey were afraid of him.“Prosecutor Lothain is to be named First Wizard?” the second man asked.Magda planted her fists on her own hips. “Who else? Do you have a suggestion forthe council as to who would make a better First Wizard? Shall I tell the counciland my soon-to-be husband that the two guards down here in the dungeon havesomeone better in mind?”Both men held out their hands. “No,” they said together.“No,” the first repeated. “We have no better suggestion. You misunderstood.Lothain will of course make an excellent First Wizard.”“And husband,” she said in cold correction. “Like I said, we’re soon to bemarried. He will be First Wizard and as such he wants me to serve beside him ashis wife.” Again she leaned toward them. “Unless, of course, you two gentlemenhave an objection?”The second man leaned in a little around the first. “Congratulations, LadySearus. He could have chosen no better woman for his wife. Everyone will bedelighted by the news.”She bowed her head once, acknowledging the proffered praise with a brief,deliberately insincere smile.“Now, gentlemen, when my betrothed sends me to question one of his prisoners, hefully expects me to return with what he sent me for. Don’t you suppose?”“Well . . .”“If you would like, I will wait right here for one of you two to trot on up tohis office, interrupt his important work, and question him. Or better yet, wecan have him dragged down here just for you two, so that you both can questionhis wishes and intentions. I’m sure he would be only to happy to explain it toyou.” She grinned wickedly as she glanced back over her shoulder at Merritt. “Ithink that would prove quite entertaining, don’t you suppose?”Merritt chuckled. “Indeed it would.”Both guards shared another look. “I don’t think that will be necessary, LadySearus, as long as—”“Then open the door!”They both flinched.“Of course, Lady Searus,” the first said as he nodded vigorously even as thesecond was pulling out a big key as he turned to the door.As Magda started for the door, the first man held up a finger. “Ah, if I mightinquire, Lady Searus? I can understand Prosecutor Lothain sending you to see theprisoner, but . . .” He gestured to Merritt. “. . . what would be the purpose ofthis fellow you have with you?”Magda glared at the man as if she were having difficulty believing how stupid hewas. “Do you really expect me to torture the prisoner for information myself?”He straightened in relief at the explanation. “Oh, I see what you mean.” Heglanced at Merritt’s stony expression and then bowed quickly. “Of course, LadySearus. I mean, no, of course not.”The man with the key in his beefy fingers fumbled at getting it into thekeyhole. The first man backhanded the side of his meaty arm and told him tohurry. Once the man got the key into the lock, his mouth twisted with the effortof turning it. He strained to turn the key, and it finally threw the bolt backwith a loud clang. Both men seized the iron handles. Together, they pulled andtugged. The door appeared to be too heavy to be opened by one man alone. Rustyhinges protested as, inch by inch, the door was jerked open.When they finally had an opening wide enough to pass through, the first mangestured to the second and under his breath ordered him to get a torch and takethe two visitors in to see the prisoner they were interested in. It was obviousthat he was eager to be out of Magda’s sight and away from her sharp tongue.The second man nodded at the instructions and snatched up a torch from a pile atthe side against the wall. He bent over the table to quickly light a splinter inthe lantern and then set flame to the torch. As soon as he had the torch lit, hegestured for Magda and Merritt to follow as he ducked under the low opening andstepped through the doorway.Magda hiked up her skirts and stepped over the high threshold. She and Merrittfollowed the hunched guard into a twisting maze of narrow tunnels that in placeswere no more than what looked like cracks in the bedrock. They took the secondpassageway to the left, down a split in the rock that was so narrow they had toturn sideways to pass through it. In places they had to walk through ankle-deep,stinking, stagnant water. To the sides, at intervals, were small iron doors setinto places carved out of the solid rock. The fist-sized openings in the doorswere all dark.“Here it is,” the guard said, lifting a finger to the door.When Magda only stared at him he jumped to stab the key into the lock and turnit. As the bolt clanged back the sound echoed through the cavelike tunnels.Holding the torch in one hand, he used his other to tug the heavy door open.Neither Magda nor Merritt made any move to help him with the difficult task.When the door was opened enough to pass, Merritt cut in front of the guard andstepped through the doorway first. Magda followed close on his heels. The guardfollowed them in.She could see by the light of the glass sphere Merritt was holding that therewas a second iron door. The outer room they were in had a ceiling so low thatshe and Merritt had to stoop over lest they hit their heads. She knew that thecells for the gifted had double doors with an outer room as an extra layer ofprotection. Besides the iron doors, the small outer room, as well as the innerroom, would be heavily shielded.“Give me the key,” Merritt said to the guard. “You can wait for us back at theentrance.”The squat, burly guard hesitated. Merritt snapped his fingers and held out ahand, palm up, wiggling his fingers impatiently. The guard reluctantly placedthe key in his palm. Seeing the two of them silently waiting for him to leave,he fidgeted a moment, scratched a hairy shoulder, and then stepped back out thefirst doorway.He ducked his head back in. “If you need anything, yell. Sound echoes down here,so we’ll hear you.”“Well, if you hear the woman screaming, that doesn’t mean we need you,” Merrittsnapped as he gestured a curt dismissal. “It only means we’re questioning her.”As Magda watched the torchlight disappear into the distance outside the firstdoor, Merritt unlocked the second. As she waited anxiously, he put his weightinto pulling open the inner door. It was so cold down in the dungeon that shecould see her own breath rise slowly in the still air.Finally, the greenish light penetrated into the inner darkness.There hanging by chains from manacles attached to the wrists of her spread arms,was a bloody, naked woman."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 72 The woman in the center of the inner room hanging by her wrists appeared to benearly unconscious. She barely slitted her eyelids to see in the dim greenishlight from the light sphere who was entering her cell. Only her eyes moved totake in Magda and Merritt.She wasn’t older, as expected, but instead looked closer to Magda’s age. Herdisheveled, straight, jet black hair was shoulder length with bangs that came tojust above her eyes. She was so beautiful, even with strings of blood across herface, that Magda found herself pausing for an instant to stare.Magda’s heart ached at the sight of what had been done to this poor creature.The woman, even though she was only half conscious, still managed to level ablack look at the two people entering her cell. She obviously expected moretorture. Even though she was chained and helpless, Magda sensed that this wasnot a woman to be trifled with.Magda reached out and gently touched the woman’s cheek. “We’re not here to hurtyou. I promise.”“She tells the truth,” Merritt said in a compassionate voice as he lookedaround, trying to see if there was a simple way to get her down.The woman watched Magda’s eyes but didn’t answer.Magda turned to Merritt. “Get her down, will you?”“The chains are pinned into the rock. The key is the only way.” Merrittstretched up, fitting the key into the lock in the manacles. Despite how hetried, the key wouldn’t turn. “It doesn’t work,” he said.“It’s probably rusty,” Magda said. “Try harder.”“No, it’s the wrong key. I can feel that it doesn’t fit the lock properly. If Itry any harder it will just break it off in the lock and then we’ll never beable to get them open.”Magda started to turn away. “I’ll go get the right key from the guards.”Merritt caught her arm, stopping her. “I have the right key.”Magda frowned at him. “What are you talking about?”As the Sword of Truth came out of its scabbard, the blade sent a clear,distinctive ring through the small prison chamber that had been hollowed out ofsolid bedrock. The steel looked as menacing as the greenish light flared off itas it sounded.The woman’s eyes widened, expecting the worst.“They’re heavy iron,” Magda said. “You can’t cut iron with a sword.”Merritt flashed her a private, one-sided smile before turning to the womanhanging before them. As he lifted her a bit by her forearm and held her steady,he carefully slid the blade of the sword under the iron manacle around herwrist.“Don’t move,” he told the woman. “I’m going to get these off you. The bladewon’t cut you. But just to be sure, don’t move.”It appeared to be too much effort for the woman to turn her head to see what hewas doing. Instead, only her eyes turned to look at his face as he cautiouslyworked the sword under the iron band. She seemed puzzled; her smooth browtwitched slightly.“Hold still, now,” Merritt said.With a mighty effort, the muscles in his neck straining, Merritt pulled thesword.A loud crack rang out as the metal band shattered. As the blade of the Sword ofTruth erupted from under the iron manacle, bits of metal ricocheted off thestone walls and clattered across the floor.With one arm suddenly freed, the woman’s weight dropped. Her bare feet werefinally able to touch the ground, but she was unable to hold her weight and herknees buckled. She hung limp by her other wrist.Magda could see that her weight hanging in the manacles had cut up her wrists.With the sudden added weight on just one wrist, fresh blood started flowing andrunning down her arm. Magda swept an arm around the woman’s middle to try totake some of the weight off the bleeding wrist. The woman let out a small moan.Magda pulled off her cloak and wrapped it around the woman, covering her as bestshe could even though the woman still had one arm trapped and hanging from thechain pinned in the ceiling. The woman’s lips moved as she whispered her thanks.It was a voice as gracefully feminine as the rest of her.Merritt tried to work the sword in under the other manacle, but it wouldn’t go.“Can you lift her any? Her weight is pulling her hand into the top of theshackle and I can’t get the sword through.”Magda nodded and strained to lift the dead weight. “Can you help at all?” sheasked the limp woman. “Can you use your legs to lift just a little? For just amoment?”The woman strained to put weight on her legs. It was just enough of a help forMerritt to start to get the sword through. Magda could feel the woman shakingwith the effort.As soon as Merritt was able to get the blade fully under the manacle, heimmediately gave the sword a mighty yank. The iron band shattered with a loudbang. Pieces of iron clanged against the stone walls. One piece hit Magda’s arm.The metal felt hot when it hit her skin and bounced off, but fortunately itdidn’t cut her.The woman collapsed into Magda’s arms. Controlling the descent, Magda went tothe ground with the weight of the woman, keeping her from falling hard andhurting herself. Once safely down on the ground, Magda hugged the woman closeand pulled the cloak around her, trying to cover her and begin to warm her icyflesh.“Who did this to you?” Magda asked, unable to contain her anger. “Who put you inhere and ordered this done?”The woman looked up and shook her head. “I don’t know them. Men. Some men.” Shesqueezed her eyes shut for a moment in a stitch of pain. “I came to help. Theywouldn’t let me. They hurt me instead. They said they were going to send me backin pieces to show others what would happen to them as well if they tried to dothe same as me.”“I’m so sorry,” Magda whispered.Looking rather mystified, the woman frowned as she reached up and touched herfinger to a tear rolling down Magda’s cheek.Magda quickly wiped her cheek. “We’re going to get you out of here,” she toldthe woman.The woman laid a hand on Magda’s shoulder. “Thank you, but you can’t help me.”“Yes, we can,” Magda insisted. “Do you think you can stand?”“You don’t understand. You must not help me. I am lost. You must leave me. Youdon’t know what you’re dealing with. The dream walkers will tell their contactshere and then they will do this to you as well.”Magda shared a look with Merritt.“We have a way to stop dream walkers from doing that,” Magda said.“Dream walkers are powerful.” The woman turned her eyes up. “Are you so sure?”“We’re sure,” Magda said. “Now, can you stand, just until we can get you out ofhere?”The woman nodded. “If it kills me I want to walk out of this place.”Magda had to smile at that. She could easily understand the sentiment.“I’m Magda, by the way. This is Merritt. He’s gifted. As soon as we get you outof here we’ll protect you from the dream walkers so that they can’t enter yourmind, and then when you’re safe, Merritt can heal you.”The woman reached out and squeezed his hand.With a finger, Magda lifted some of the jet black hair back off the woman’sface. “What’s your name?”“Naja Moon.”It was a name as exotic as the woman’s looks.“Well, Naja, can you tell me why you came here, to the Keep?”Naja looked up at Merritt and then back to Magda. “I came because EmperorSulachan must be stopped or he will destroy the world of life.”Magda straightened a little as she glanced up at Merritt standing over them withthe light sphere. She leaned in again toward Naja.“How do you know this, Naja?”“I was his spiritist.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 73 Before Magda could ask anything else, Naja’s eyes winced closed as she endured ashudder of pain. When the stitch of agony eased up, she struggled to catch herbreath as she rested, huddled in Magda’s warm embrace.Steam from her labored breathing rose into the still air of the small stonecell. Instead of asking anything else for the moment, Magda rubbed the woman’shands, letting her rest while working some warmth into her icy fingers. Thechill of being deep underground was an insidious killer, over time sapping aperson’s energy and eventually their life.Magda knew that the woman needed to gather her strength after having her armsfreed. No longer hanging from the ceiling, she was at last able to breatheproperly. Her wrists had finally stopped bleeding, but she had other, moreserious wounds that Magda knew needed tending as soon as possible.Merritt was impatient to get out of the dungeon—to be away from the shields sothat he could heal her, but also to get them all away from the ever-presentthreat of the guards. By the way he kept checking the corridor outside the outerdoor, it was clear that he was concerned that the longer they waited, the moresuspicious the guards would get.They also had to worry that someone else might show up, possibly even those whohad captured Naja, had put her in the dungeon, and had been torturing her.Getting trapped down in the dungeons would be the end of them all. No one knewthey were there, and if they were locked in, no one would be coming to helpthem.After catching her breath for a short time, Naja, without being asked, startedto try putting weight on her legs. She looked to be even more impatient thanMerritt to get out before the guards returned.Naja finally stood to her full height. The woman’s clothes were nowhere to befound in the cell, but fortunately Magda’s cloak was big enough to wrap aroundher. Naja was thankful to have it, and clutched it to herself as she stood,testing her legs. She was proving to be stronger than Magda had expected.The cloak would have to do for the time being. She was close to the same heightand build as Magda, so Magda would be able to give her some of her own clothes.First they needed to get out of the dungeon.“How is it that your blade did not cut me?” Naja asked Merritt as she moved herarms about, working the circulation back into them.He looked back after checking out the doorway. “It has magic that prevented itfrom cutting you.”“Magic does not work down here. I tried. I tried very hard.”“This magic is not obstructed by the shields down here. It’s somewhat similar tothe way the magic of the light sphere isn’t blocked by the shields. It’scomplicated, and I don’t want to oversimplify it, but basically the sword’smagic won’t harm an innocent or a person believed to be a friend. I don’tconsider you the enemy, so the sword didn’t cut you. I hadn’t tested that aspectof it, though, so I had to be careful. It appears to work as it should. It alsoappears, by the way it cut through those iron manacles, that the other side ofits magic is working as well.”This was news to Magda. He hadn’t told her the part about its magic not beingable to harm innocent people. Merritt was full of wonders.“Why are you two helping me?” Naja’s voice was clearly laced with pain, andjustifiably, some suspicion.“We’re actually hoping that you can help us,” Merritt said. “I heard that youwanted to join our cause. When we found out where you were, we knew we had toget you out.”“I thought that the people here did not want my help. I thought I was wrongabout the New World and the wizards who live and work here. Instead of my help,they chained me up in this awful place. They said that I was a spy and I was toeventually be put to death.”“We believe that there are traitors, here, in the Keep,” Magda told her. “Ithink they had you put down here to keep you from helping our people.”“I thought that I had made the worst mistake of my life in coming here,” Najasaid, shaking her head. “I’m glad to learn that what I believed really is true,that there are good people here, as I had heard. But maybe it is not that thereare traitors here.”Magda frowned. “What are you talking about? Why would the men who captured youput you down here, if they weren’t collaborators with those in the Old World?”She looked from Magda, to Merritt, and back to Magda. “Maybe dream walkerspossess them and made them do it.”Merritt stiffened. “Do you think that could be what is really going on?”“It’s possible. Dream walkers can make people do terrible things.”Magda let out a sigh. “We don’t know what is really going on. That’s why we camedown here looking for you. We hope you can help us learn the truth.”“If this place is shielded,” Naja said, “then maybe in here we are safe from thedream walkers hearing us.”“That’s possible,” Merritt said. “The dungeon is heavily protected with some ofthe most powerful suppression shields ever created.”“Your sword has a newly created form of magic,” Magda said. “It works down herein spite of the shields. The dream walkers were likely also created after theseshields, so the shields may not be able to protect us from them.”She cast a meaningful look at Naja.Naja caught her meaning. “If one of them found me and was in my mind, watchingus, I wouldn’t know it.”Magda looked up at Merritt. “We can’t trust that the bond will work through theshields. We only know for sure that it works when not shielded. We dare not takea chance. Before we talk, we’d better first get her out of here and then get herprotected from the dream walkers.”“She’s right,” Naja said. “If you have a protection that works, then we need toget out of here and use it.”Merritt lifted his sword a few inches and then let it drop back into itsscabbard, making sure that the weapon was clear.“As soon as you feel strong enough to go, we’re ready. We’re glad to have you onour side in the war, Naja. And we do need your help,” Merritt added. “Just assoon as we heal you.”“If there are traitors in the Keep, spies who are working for Emperor Sulachan,and not merely dream walkers using people, then you need my help more than yourealize.”Magda didn’t like the sound of that.Before she could say anything more, Naja started sinking again toward theground. Both Magda and Merritt held her up.“We need to get out of here,” Merritt said to Magda. “I think that she’s asrecovered as she is going to get until I can heal her. We can’t wait any longer.We need to get her out of here, bonded, and healed. She’s strong, but herinjuries are serious. It can’t wait any longer.”“He’s right,” Naja said through gritted teeth from a stitch of pain. “I’m ableto stand, now. Let’s go.”Magda nodded. “We’ll help hold you up as best we can, but it’s narrow and you’llhave to be strong for a little bit longer. Merritt can carry you once we’re outof the dungeon.”“Thank you both,” Naja managed between gasps of increasing pain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 74 Now that the surge of excitement from being cut down from the chains was wearingoff, it was clear that Naja’s strength was flagging. By the twitches of herbrow, Magda could see that even though she didn’t complain, she was enduringincreasingly serious waves of pain. Her determination was keeping her movingbetter than Magda would have thought possible.Naja had difficulty trying to make it out through the small doorway of her cell.It was proving easier to stand than to bend. Merritt held an arm on the outsideof the doorway while Magda, still in the inner cell, held her other arm. AfterNaja was through, Merritt picked the woman up in his arms and carried her acrossthe outer room. He stopped before the outer door, still holding Naja in hisarms.He gestured with a tip of his head. “Check outside,” he whispered to Magda.Magda carefully stuck her head out of the doorway and peered into the darkness.“It’s too dark to see,” she told him.“Take the light. I’ll carry her.”Magda lifted the heavy glass light sphere from his hand. Merritt rearranged hishold on Naja while Magda stuck the light out into the passageway, checking. Shesignaled to Merritt that she didn’t see anything.Naja wrapped her arms around his neck to help hold on as he bent low to passthrough the slightly larger outer doorway and follow Magda into the narrowtunnel. Merritt was easily able to carry the woman, but in places it was sonarrow that he had to turn sideways and even then it was a tight squeeze.“How are we going to get her past the guards?” Merritt asked as he followedbehind Magda.Magda looked back over her shoulder without slowing. “I guess we bluff our wayout the same way we bluffed our way in.”Merritt looked more than a little skeptical. “You really think they’ll go forthat with us trying to leave with her?”“I’ll tell them that we have to take her to my soon-to-be new husband because hepersonally wants to question her.”Merritt let out a sigh as if to say how unhappy he was with such a sketchy plan,and that he didn’t think for a minute that it was going to work.“Unless you have a better idea,” she said.“We can try it. You know my backup plan.”Magda hadn’t liked his backup plan of killing the guards, but now that she’dseen the condition Naja was in, Merritt’s suggestion that they might have tokill the guards was not sounding like nearly such a bad idea. She still didn’tknow, though, if the two guards actually had anything to do with what hadhappened to Naja. They might be nothing more than they seemed: guards who didn’tknow what was really going on.Before they reached the outer doorway to the dungeon entrance, where the twoguards would be waiting, Merritt came to a halt.“Do you think you can walk?” he asked Naja in a quiet voice. “Just until we getpast the two guards? I may need to get at my sword.”She nodded. “I’m getting some of my strength back. Put me down.”He set her on her bare feet. For a moment Magda wondered if the woman was goingto be able to stand, but she steadied herself and with an effort straightenedher back.“I’ll go first and do the talking,” Magda whispered. “Naja, stay close behindme. We’re going to try to walk you right out of here before they have a chanceto argue.”The three of them made their way silently the remaining distance down the stonetunnel toward the light coming from the outer door. The lamplight from thedoorway was a relief, because that meant the heavy iron door was still standingopen. Magda hiked up her skirts and boldly stepped over the raised threshold outto the area where the guards waited.Naja’s hand lightly touched Magda’s back for guidance as she stayed closebehind.The two burly men stood waiting, one a little in front of the other, blockingthe iron stairway up out of the dungeon. The big man in front had his thumbshooked on his belt. The men were close enough that she could smell how badlythey stunk.There wasn’t a lot of room to maneuver. Magda hoped that Merritt had enough roomto use his sword if needed. If he did have to go for his sword, Magda intendedto pull Naja out of the way and protect her.“Well, well,” the guard in front said. A depraved grin widened as he spottedNaja in Magda’s shadow. “Look who we have here out in the light.”“We need to take her for further questioning,” Magda said in an icy voice, notwanting to discuss anything with the man. “Stand aside.”“Well, the thing is,” the man said, scratching the stubble on his chin and nolonger looking the least bit cowed, “you forgot what I told you.”Magda glared at him. “What are you talking about?”“I told you that sound carries through these tunnels. We heard what you said.‘We’re going to try to walk you right out of here before they have a chance toargue,’ I believe is the way you put it. Did I get it right?”Magda felt a quick touch, a light pressure, at the small of her back. Before shecould fully make sense of it, Naja flew past her.Naja had Magda’s knife.The woman struck like lightning. The blade slashed the first guard’s throat openfrom the side of his neck under his right ear clean across his windpipe. Blooderupted in great throbbing gouts from a severed artery at the side of his neck.His open windpipe blew clouds of red mist as he struggled to breathe.As Naja twisted around, completing the powerful, slashing strike, the secondman’s big hand clamped down around her other wrist where the manacle had been.Without pause, Naja used his hand holding her wrist for leverage to spin herselfaround. Using his hold on her wrist, she deliberately yanked herself forcefullytoward the hulking guard. As she flew toward him, she whipped the knife in herother fist around in an arc and hammered it straight into the his heart.His eyes opened wide in shock.The first man hit the floor with a heavy thud. Blood from the severed artery inhis neck pumped out into a spreading pool. His last breath gurgled from hislungs. The man with the knife in his chest toppled back. The back of his headhit the stone floor with a loud crack. Blood oozed out from under his greasyhair. He was as still as the stone that had cracked open his head. He staredwith wide-open, dead eyes.It had happened so swiftly that only then did Magda even realize that she’dheard the sound of steel being drawn. Merritt stood with the sword in his handand rage in his eyes.Magda had to catch Naja when she stumbled back a few steps. She weakly got herbalance and then straightened herself to stand tall and glare down at the bodiesat her feet.In the lamplight Magda could finally see that Naja’s eyes were as blue as thesky on a bright summer day. Her jet black hair and bangs made her blue eyes allthe more dazzling.Now, though, those blue eyes were filled with fiery rage.“They both took turns having their way with me,” Naja said defiantly. “If I hadhad the time, I would not have given them the mercy of a swift death.”Magda couldn’t blame the woman. She would have felt no differently. Thesurprising strength she had shown reminded Magda again that Naja Moon was not awoman to be trifled with, or underestimated.“Then you have carried out justice,” Magda told her. “You’ll get no condemnationfrom me.”Naja smiled with triumphant satisfaction.“Well, that simplifies things,” Merritt said under his breath. He slid the swordhome into its scabbard. “No one knew we were coming down here. No one else butthese two knew that we were in here, or would be aware that we freed Naja, andthey aren’t going to do any talking.”“Right now we’re anonymous,” Magda said. “Let’s get out of here before someoneshows up and identifies us.”Naja bent and yanked the knife from the man’s chest. She carefully wiped itclean on his pant leg. She flipped the knife and caught it by the point, thenoffered Magda the hilt. “I apologize for borrowing your weapon withoutpermission. Had my gift worked down here, I would have handled it withoutneeding to use your knife.”“I don’t blame you. The men got what they deserved,” Magda said as she replacedthe knife in its sheath under the slit in her dress at the small of her back.She headed for the iron stairs. “Now let’s get out of here.”Naja smiled and followed her up."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 75 Magda carefully slid the flimsy door aside just enough to peek through the smallopening. At the moment she didn’t see anyone out in the passageway through thecatacombs, but a few minutes earlier she had seen two wizards, deep inconversation, hurry by. Across the way she could see one of the nearly countlesschambers filled with the dead. At least this upper area didn’t smell as bad asthe lower levels.She didn’t know how long Merritt was going to take with Naja, but Magda hated tohave to spend any time in the small catacombs library near where wizards worked,because it was not all that far from the dungeon. The library was utilitarian,little more than a small space hollowed from the soft rock. It was only largeenough for three short rows of simple plank shelves for books. Between two ofthe shelves sat a simple bench. There was not even any room for a table.Naja lay on the bench, Merritt kneeling beside her, working as quickly as hecould to heal the wounds that required the most urgent attention. He had saidthat the library was seldom used, but Magda worried that this night someonemight come looking for a rare volume and happen upon the three of them. Shecouldn’t think of a plausible story as to why they were there, who Naja was, andwhat had happened to her.They’d had to stop somewhere, though. Merritt wouldn’t have been able to carryNaja far before someone saw them and started asking questions. The small librarywas the first place they could find that Merritt thought would be somewhat safefor a brief time.Naja had a number of injuries, including torn muscles in her legs, a few brokenbones in her feet, and most concerning, a serious abdominal wound thatthreatened her life. Killing the two guards might have been satisfyingretribution, but it had ruptured her abdominal wound and it needed to be closed.Before they’d done anything else, though, even before healing her or addressingany of their other problems, as soon as they’d gotten out from the influence ofthe shields down in the dungeon, Naja had gone to her knees and given thedevotion to Lord Rahl. She was so eager to be protected from the dream walkersthat she ignored the pain long enough to say the devotion three times and gainthe protection of the bond. Magda ached to have the woman healed, but more thananything she had wanted to know that they would be safe from the view of dreamwalkers.When they had finished with the devotion, they had immediately turned to theproblem of finding a place to tend to her injuries. Merritt had said thathealing the sorceress was going to take some time, hours at least, possibly allnight. Since they knew that they couldn’t risk staying in the catacombs librarythat long, he had decided to use the place just long enough to get her out ofimminent danger of dying and able to walk on her own so they could get her to asafer place.Once they were able to move from the little library to a safe place, Merrittwould then be able to take the time to heal the rest of her serious injurieswithout the risk of being interrupted at a critical moment. In the meantime, hewould do what he could as quickly as he could.Magda was nervous, though, about getting caught in the catacomb library. Sheknew that if someone went down to the dungeons and found the two dead guards,they would raise an alarm and the whole place would soon be crawling withsoldiers. They would look in every corner. Magda didn’t know if they would knowwho Naja was, or be aware that she had been in the dungeon and had escaped, butif Merritt and Magda were discovered in the library healing an injured woman,the soldiers would certainly ask a lot of questions and they would expectanswers.Merritt had worked down in the area on occasion, so he was familiar with thispart of the catacombs. He had known of a storage cabinet where wizards andsorceresses kept supplies. There, he’d found a spare sorceress’s robe and someclean rags. The flaxen robes were decorated at the neck with red and yellowbeads sewn in the ancient symbols of the profession.Merritt had then taken them to the little library and stood watch at the doorwhile Magda cleaned Naja up enough so that she wouldn’t draw suspicion if anyonesaw her. After using a damp rag to gently wash some of the blood off the face ofan only half-conscious Naja, Magda had managed to get the robe onto her. Whileonly partially responsive, Naja had been aware enough to be grateful to have therobe to wear.After that, Magda had let Merritt hurry and get to work healing the woman whileMagda stood watch.Merritt finally stepped up behind Magda. “Anyone out there?”“No, not for a while.” Magda looked back and saw Naja standing close behind him.“How are you?” she asked the sorceress.“Merritt helped me enough for now. He is very talented. I think I will be strongenough to walk to a safer place where he can finish.”“Your house?” Magda asked Merritt.He pressed his lips tight as he considered it. He glanced back briefly at Naja.“I wish we could get there. We’d be secluded and alone. But I really think itneeds to be someplace closer. She can walk for a short while, but I’m afraid shewouldn’t make it that far and then we’d be in trouble.”Naja looked past Magda to peer out the crack in the door. She abruptly steppedback in surprise.“There are dead people out there.”Merritt nodded. “This is the catacombs, down under the Keep, where the dead arelaid to rest. We’re just a ways above the dungeon where we found you.”Naja was clearly alarmed. “We need to leave, now.”“They’re dead,” Merritt said. “They can’t hurt you.”“Yes they can,” Naja said.Magda slid the door closed and turned to the woman. “What do you mean?”“Emperor Sulachan uses the dead.”Both Merritt and Magda stared. Magda, having fought a dead man, was not all thatsurprised by Naja’s claim.“Uses them how?” she asked.“To serve him.”“How can the dead serve him?” Merritt asked.“For Emperor Sulachan, the dead can serve him as well as the living. In somecases, better.”“Better.” Merritt repeated as he stared at her. “They have no heartbeat. Theyhave no life in them. How can they do anything?”“Chickens can move and flop for hours after their heads are cut off. They haveno heartbeat, either,” Naja said, “and that doesn’t even involve any magic.“The emperor has rare, gifted people called makers,” she said, leaning in,speaking in a quiet, reverent tone. “I never met any myself, but I do know thatmakers have remarkable powers of originality. They imagine what others neverenvisioned before, and through that mechanism are somehow able to create whatothers never could.”Magda glanced up at Merritt. “We understand. We have makers as well.”“Then you understand the wide range of the totally new and unexpected creationsthey can sometimes come up with. Most people’s minds travel along the same roadtraveled by everyone else, never straying off the route of conventional wisdom.Makers know no such boundaries. They have a rare ability to make their own roadsof thought. Their minds venture through the wilderness of all that exists,combining random bits of knowledge in ways that have never been imaginedbefore.”“We understand that much of it,” Magda said. “What does this have to do withmaking the dead walk again?”“The emperor’s makers have created new forms of magic, new spells, that functionin part by altering the nature of the grace. Through the new forms of powerenvisioned by the makers, along with the help of the emperor’s many gifted, theyhave learned to use magic to control the dead.”“How do you know all of this?” Merritt asked.“I know because I was one of the gifted who helped them. Though the manipulationof the spirits of the dead in the underworld, and investing powerful magic intothe corpses that those spirits came from, the dead are made to respond. That wasthe secret that the makers unlocked, using the spirits of the dead from thespirit world, linking them back to corpses they came from, using that connectionin the Grace, the spark, that runs through creation, life, and into death,connecting it all. With the new spells designed by our makers, the dead are madeto serve the wishes of Emperor Sulachan.”“Against their will, then?” Magda asked.Naja shook her head. “They have no will. They are dead. They are like a rawmaterial which, through the methods dreamed up by makers, is crafted to serve asthe emperor wants.”“Serve? How do they serve?” Merritt asked. “What purpose would the dead havethat could serve Sulachan better than the living?”“The dead never get weary, they don’t know hunger, or pain, or pity. They don’tneed to eat, or sleep, or rest, or stay warm, so they don’t need any supplies.They have no ambition but the one given to them. They have no capacity for fearso they act without hesitation.”“Act how?” Magda asked. “What do the emperor’s forces use these dead peoplefor?”“For all those reasons I mentioned, they make perfect assassins.” She gesturedbeyond the door. “They can be right there, in your midst, and you never know it.You walk by them and never see them for what they are.“The dead can be animated as needed. They are then given a single-mindedpurpose. They never stop trying to carry out that purpose.“For these reasons, they also make the perfect warriors. The dead have theirlimits of service, though. There are things for which Emperor Sulachan cannotuse them.“When he needs the same sorts of things done that the dead do well, but withsome intelligence behind them, he uses the half people.”“Half people?” Magda leaned in. “What are half people?”“Living people he has stripped of their souls.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 76 Merritt folded his arms across his chest. “How much, exactly, do you really knowabout all of this? How complete is your understanding of it?”“I told you, I was Emperor Sulachan’s spiritist.” Naja heaved an impatient sigh.“Must we discuss this now? Can we please go and talk about it later?”“We need to know some things, first,” Merritt said.Naja gestured toward the door. “What you need to know is that any one of thosedead could be a servant of the emperor. You wouldn’t know it until one of themsat up, grabbed you by your throat, and ripped your arms off. If the emperor orhis minions knew we were in here, they could set one or a dozen of the dead onus to tear us apart.”“She’s right,” Magda said, recalling the horror of what had happened withIsidore. “We should get out of here.”“How could he get any of those dead people down here to do his bidding?” Merrittasked, not ready to leave before he had a better grasp of it all and exactlywhat they faced. “He may be powerful, but he’s all the way down in the OldWorld. How could he do a thing like that from such a great distance?”“Easy. One of those loyal to him prepares a dead body, here, at the Keep or inAydindril, and then has it laid to rest out there in your catacombs among theother dead people. How would you know? How would you know that the body that wasbeing laid to rest down here wasn’t one of the ones that had been prepared toserve Sulachan’s purpose? Any of his people hidden here as spies or traitors atthe Keep could then bring the dead out of their death sleep”—she snapped herfingers—“as quickly as that.”Magda had to remind herself to breathe. “Dear spirits, I never thought of that.”“I hadn’t either,” Merritt admitted. “Is there a way to check the dead, to knowwhich have been prepared in this way?”“Before they are called into service, they are nothing more than a corpse. Thereis no way to tell, unless you were to find a way to contact their spirit in theunderworld. As a spiritist I can tell you that would not be an easy task. Icould probably venture into the spirit world to probe for the spirit of a deadbody, but that could take days of searching, and that’s for one dead body. Youhave thousands out there. Do you have thousands of spiritists who could beassigned such a monumental task?”“We might have a handful of such gifted,” Magda said, “but I’m afraid that theonly one that I actually know of was killed by one of the emperor’s deadservants.”“Then you have no way to test a corpse being laid to rest even if you wanted to.Worse, though, those seeking to use the dead wouldn’t even have to go to thatmuch trouble. Do you have guards who check the people who come and go from thecatacombs? Escort them to see what they might be doing?”Merritt arched an eyebrow as he grasped her meaning. “No. There are wizards whowork down here on countermeasures to Sulachan’s weapons. They come and go allthe time.”“Exactly,” she said. “Any of those wizards could be a spy, secretly working forEmperor Sulachan’s cause. They would have their pick from thousands of dead.They merely find a suitable corpse and prepare it to be awakened from death. Thespells have already been well developed by Sulachan’s makers to use on the dead.Such spies would also be able to identify important targets among the gifted andset the dead upon them to cripple your efforts.”Merritt wiped a hand back across his face in exasperation. “Naja, this is allpretty hard to take in. I need to have an idea of what, exactly, it is thatwe’re up against—the larger picture. Not just about some traitors assassinatingpeople here, but how it all fits together in Sulachan’s larger purpose. It’simportant for me to be able to grasp the totality of it.”Naja took a deep breath as she nodded. “I understand. It must be difficult tohear this all for the first time.”“It certainly is,” Merritt said.“Well, you see, Emperor Sulachan is old and sickly,” Naja said. “He fears thathe will not live to see the Old World unite all people into his vision of a justworld. He calls that vision the People’s Alliance. He wants all people ruledunder that alliance.“Emperor Sulachan sees this as a just cause that transcends his life, as alarger cause for the good of all existence—the world of life and the world ofthe dead as one interconnected entity, one whole, just as the Grace is onewhole, interconnected concept. To that end, he believes that all people musthave common rule for that greater good of all, both the living and the dead.”Merritt looked incredulous. “The living and the dead?”“That’s right,” the sorceress said.“Setting aside for the moment the issue of thinking he can rule the spiritworld,” Merritt said, “how does he think it’s going to be possible for him toaccomplish this merely with the world of life if he’s dying? He won’t be aroundto carry out his plans.”“He seeks to continue to exist and function without life in the conventionalsense, so you can’t separate the issue of ruling the spirit world. They’reinterconnected. You said that you wanted the larger picture. The larger pictureis that he seeks an alternate form of existence, you might say, so you have tounderstand it in those terms.“What he seeks is a way to remain connected after his death to a functioningform in this world, in the world of life, so that he can rule it all. Hebelieves that if he rules the spirit world, he can not only rule through hisspirit in that world, but rule this world as well through his spirit’sconnection to his reanimated body. In that way he unites it all.”“It’s madness.” Magda shook her head as she let out a deep sigh. “We stand atthe twilight of everything we hold dear, not only our liberty, but our veryexistence.”Merritt looked stymied by a thousand questions he wanted to ask all at once, soMagda asked a question instead. “How do the dead fit into this plan of his?”“As I said, he uses them for assassins and is preparing to use them as warriors.They are mindless at that task, once set to it. They are very difficult to stop.If you cut them, they don’t bleed. If you chop off an arm, they don’t feel itand will attack with the one they have left. If you cut off their legs they willuse their arms to continue to pull themselves after you. They don’t rest. Theyare tireless, bloodless, relentless, remorseless killers. More corpses can beanimated as needed. The dead are plentiful.”“They just keep going forever?” Magda asked.“Well, no, not forever, I don’t suppose. The dead rot away, but the magic thatpossesses them forestalls that process as part of its function, but the magicthat has been invested in the dead is not a perfect solution. It has limits. Itdecays with time, much the same as a corpse would decompose. As the magic breaksdown, so does the effectiveness, and so do the dead it possesses.”“Well there is that,” Merritt said. “Maybe there is a way we can attack thismagic.” He rolled his hand for her to continue.“The army intends to start using them at the front line as they advance inbattle. Arrows and spears are of little use against the dead. Stabbing them overand over is futile. They can’t really be killed because they are already dead.The soldiers on your side will waste their energy trying to kill them, trying tohack them apart, trying to stop their advance. The dead will keep coming,wearing them out.“Sulachan intends his forces to sweep in after the waves of the dead haveexhausted your soldiers and cut them down. Their corpses will be recovered andend up serving Sulachan’s side in his lifeless army.“When the dead are no longer needed, no longer have a use at the time,Sulachan’s forces simply sever the links of magic and leave them as they wouldany of the dead. They are thus returned to what they were: corpses. They are oflittle value, individually. They are just a supply to be used. If he needs more,his gifted can provide them.”Deep in thought as he listened, Merritt pinched the bridge of his nose. “How canthey be stopped?”“I am not really all that familiar with their use in warfare. I didn’t deal withthe army officers, command structure, or strategists. I dealt with the giftedwho created things, not the people who used those things.“But I can tell you from my general knowledge and familiarity that there areonly a couple of ways to stop them that I know of, other than cutting off themagic that drives them. One way is to rip them to pieces. Not as easy as itsounds, because the magic also hardens them to an extent. It’s not intended tocreate a better weapon out of the dead person. Its purpose is ratherstraightforward. It’s meant to counter the decomposition of the body that wouldotherwise allow tissues to break down.“Even then, if a disembodied arm is close, it will try to grab you, try toattach itself to your leg to slow you down, or if it managed to use the fingersto pull itself across the ground into camp at night, it might clamp on to asleeping soldier’s throat to choke them to death. But as you might expect, bodypieces don’t have much of an ability to come after a person, so they aren’tnearly so serious a threat.“Your forces will try to use shields, but I can tell you from experience thatshields don’t work. Shields key off life. They have nothing to latch on to withthe dead.”“That’s true enough,” Merritt said, still deep in thought as he listened.“Keying a shield to things that aren’t alive would paralyze the shield becauseit would try to ward the world around it.” He looked up. “What about fire. Thatwould have to work.”Naja nodded. “That’s the second way to stop them. Fire, any kind of fire, iseffective because it can reduce the dead to ashes. That certainly would be onesure way to stop them.“Wizard’s fire would obviously work because it would stick to them and keepburning, but as you can imagine, the effectiveness of using it would degradeover time because Sulachan’s gifted can send endless ranks of the dead into theface of the wizard’s fire.“I can also tell you that his gifted are working on ways to shield the dead theysend in from wizard’s fire. I don’t know if they have perfected that sort ofshield, or if they ever will, but you need to be aware that they are trying.Even if they don’t come up with a counter to such conjured fire, it’s not asignificant setback because they don’t care about losses.“Eventually, the wizards summoning such fire would begin to tire. It takeseffort to keep up such conjuring. That is the advantage of using the dead. As Isaid before, they don’t tire. Enough of the dead would eventually make itthrough.“Through the process that animates them, some of the dead will be dedicated tothe task of going after specific targets, such as your gifted. If it takes ahundred, or a thousand dead to take out one wizard on the battlefield, what doesSulachan care? If it takes ten thousand he wouldn’t care.”Magda thought that Merritt was looking numbed by such horrifying accounts. Itwas overwhelming and she could see the despair in his eyes.“What about these others,” Magda asked when Merritt fell silent. “The halfpeople?”Naja ran her fingers back through her black hair, clearly unsettled by themention of the half people.“The half people are worse. Far worse.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 77 “What do you mean, the half people are worse?” Merritt asked. “How are theyworse?”“They were actually created to control and guide the dead. They are livingpeople who are stripped of their souls, so the dead and the half people sharecertain things in common.”“Things in common?” Merritt asked. “Like what?”“They are not alive, at least not in the accepted sense.”Merritt let out an angry breath. “What do you mean by accepted sense?”“The accepted sense of life means having a soul. That is part of existence as weunderstand it, part of what it means for us to be in the world of life.”Naja reached out and lifted his hand with his ring and with her finger tappedthe Grace on it. “Creation, life, death, with the Light of Creation runningthrough it all. The half people are a perversion of the Grace. They areseparated from that spark of the gift that is their soul, that spark they aresupposed to carry through life and then after death into the spirit world.“But these souls from the half people did not pass through the veil in thenormal manner, didn’t carry that spark through the veil themselves. They havebeen ripped asunder. They are neither dead, nor alive. Though they are alive inthe sense that they breathe, eat, even talk some, they are not really alivebecause they have no soul, no connection to Creation and the Grace. It is aliving body that is just a vessel that has been torn away from the conventionalsense of the Grace.“If Emperor Sulachan dies before he can complete his grand scheme, he will bereanimated to be an extension of his soul in the spirit world. But the emperoris hoping that when the method is perfected, if he is still alive, his soul canbe sent on to the underworld, while his living form remains here to rule theworld of life as one of the half people, or should I say, what is left of theworld of life. It is his way of achieving a form of immortality.”“How can that make him immortal?” Merritt asked, his impatience growing by themoment.“He wants to create a race of half people, with him as their ruler. He would nolonger have to fear being old, fear being sickly, fear dying. His soul would besafe in the spirit world, leaving his temporal form to carry out his wishes inthis world, thereby uniting the world of life and death in purpose.“He and his race of half people would live indefinitely, largely unaffected bythe afflictions of the living because they aren’t living people. They are, to anextent, animated in the way the dead have been animated, with magic havingquickening their corporeal form.“And, of course, the world of the dead is eternal, so there is no such thing asdeath for spirits. Spirits are by definition dead. Some of the spirits he hasstripped from both the living and the dead still haunt this world. Having losttheir connection they are unable to pass through the veil.“The half people wouldn’t live forever, but through the process of sending theirsouls to the underworld and investing this vitalizing magic in their bodies,they also alter the way the body that is left behind would age. Changing theGrace changes the way time passes for them. Time doesn’t touch them in the sameway it does us. Without the soul and with what they do to the husk of the livingperson, that person ages very slowly. I don’t know much of the details. I’m notsure anyone does, yet.“Emperor Sulachan wants to convert as many people as possible into this new raceof humans, these half people, living in this altered timeline. He plans toeliminate any opposition to his grand scheme by first eliminating the gifted whowould oppose him—that would be you here in the New World—so that there will beno one with the ability to stop his plans.”“That’s what the war is about,” Magda said out loud as the full realization cameto her. “He wants to unite everyone under the rule of the People’s Alliance, buthis main goal in attacking the New World is to first eliminate magic so that heand his followers are the only ones with the power of the gift.”“That’s right,” Naja said. “He never says that, though. He promotes his goal as‘eliminate the tyranny of magic from mankind.’ He makes people think that magicis their oppressor, and he is fighting for them by fighting to eliminate magicfrom the world of life.”“But in reality,” Merritt said, “by eliminating the magic we have, he iseliminating the potential for opposition.”Naja nodded. “Then he plans on eliminating life itself.”Merritt’s arms came unfolded and dropped to his sides. “What?”“He seeks to destroy the world of life as we know it, purging it of those peoplewith souls. That would leave only the dead which he can control and the halfpeople, who, as I said, aren’t really alive in the conventional sense. Then, thelifeless half people would rule a lifeless world.“With his soul safely in the underworld, Emperor Sulachan would be the ruler ofthe world of life, but the world of life would no longer contain life as we knowit now. There would be plants and birds and beasts, but the people here would nolonger be the race of man as we are now. The people would be nothing more thananimals, really.“The world of life, as we know it, would no longer exist. There would no longerbe any purpose in life, no ambition, no initiative, no accomplishment. No joy.No love.”Magda and Merritt shared a look. She could see in his eyes what he was thinking:the boxes of Orden. In wordless confirmation, a private message to Magda, helifted the Sword of Truth a few inches and let it drop back into its scabbard.“That’s insanity,” Merritt finally said. “There is no other word for it. It’shard to even grasp the very idea of it.”“Whether you can grasp it or not, whether you believe it will work or not,whether you think he has a chance to succeed or not, what matters is that heintends to try to carry out his plan, insane as it is. He intends to try todestroy the world of life in order to create this vision of a perfect worldwhere people do not think for themselves.“That is why I defected. That is why I want to join your cause of stopping him.I, too, think it is insanity. I don’t want any part of it. I don’t want to livein his idealistic version of an ideal world. I don’t want to be a slave to hispurpose, to his deluded vision. It’s my life to live, not his to take for hisends.”Merritt smiled for the first time in a while. “Then you have come to the rightside. That is our feeling as well. That is what we believe in and what we arefighting for. The right to the joy of life. The right to our own life. The rightto love.”“The problem is,” Naja said, “I believe that even if he doesn’t succeed at hisplan for the perfect world, he very well may succeed at destroying the world oflife in the attempt. He is a technically intelligent, resourceful, anddetermined man and he is tampering with the very nature of what the Gracerepresents. Even if what he believes he can accomplish is utterly impossible andhe doesn’t succeed with his ultimate plan, he will kill untold numbers trying.Even if he doesn’t succeed, even if he is insane and he fails to do what hethinks he can do, I fear that he may very well accidentally destroy the world oflife in the process.“Either way, the result is the same. Everyone is dead in the end.”“Are you certain about all this,” Merritt asked in a careful tone. “Were youclose enough to him to know this to all be true? To really believe all this halfpeople talk?”Naja Moon lifted an eyebrow over a cold blue eye. This was the dangeroussorceress Magda had recognized from the first moment she had seen her.“I know how the half people were created because I helped create them. I am aspiritist. I speak with the dead. I also manipulated the spirits of the dead inthe underworld to create for Emperor Sulachan an army of the dead. I helped showhim how it could be done.”Even though she had defected, Magda suddenly wanted to strangle the woman. “Whywould you do such a thing? How could you do such a thing? How could you help putall the innocent lives everywhere in such mortal peril?”Naja leveled a grim look at Magda. “What was being done to me down in yourdungeon is a fate I would have prayed for, had I not done as Sulachan commanded.You could not begin to understand what life is like in the Old World, andespecially in the halls of power there.“Though he may be old and sickly, Emperor Sulachan is still a wizard of greatpower. Defying his wishes earns a person unimaginable torture. He keeps those hetortures alive for a very long time to serve as a reminder to others of the fatethat awaits them should they, too, disobey his wishes. You would be surprisedwhat you would do when living every day of your life in such terror.”“If he is so powerful, then how did you manage to escape?” Merritt asked.Naja let out a deep breath as her gaze drifted away. “There was a brief windowof opportunity created by an unexpected calamity. While people were distracted,I saw my chance and was able to slip away. I ran and I kept running. I didn’twant Sulachan’s vision to come to pass. I didn’t want people to die to fulfillhis plans. I didn’t want innocent people to be visited by such horror as I knewwas coming. I hated that I’d had a part in it all. I was ashamed that I hadn’tbeen brave enough to have chosen torture and death instead of the things I didto help him.“I thought that maybe this was my chance to do something to try to stop theworld from falling into such darkness. After all, if not me, then who? What wasmy life to mean, if I did nothing and let this happen? What kind of person wasI, knowing what was coming, if I stood by and didn’t try to stop it?“I saw my chance and chose to act. Because I am gifted, I was able to fight myway through some of our forces standing between me and the free parts of the NewWorld, and because I am a spiritist I understood how the dead and the half deadfunction, so I was able to avoid them along the way.”Magda laid a hand on Naja’s arm. “Thank you for being brave enough to take upthe cause of life.”“Yes, we appreciate it, Naja,” Merritt said. “Your help will be invaluable. Sowhat was the calamity you mentioned?”“An unexpected complexity developed in the emperor’s plan. The half people hecreated took to eating humans.”Merritt and Magda both leaned in together and together they both said, “What?”“At first, there was no evidence of the behavior, but then without warning thehalf people began attacking and eating the living. I had warned the emperor ofthat possibility, but he wouldn’t be dissuaded. He wouldn’t listen to anywarning that went against what he wanted.”“Why would they start eating people?” Magda asked. “What would make them do sucha thing?”“I believe that the half people crave the soul they no longer have. Thatemptiness drives them with a form of insanity that compels them to eat livingpeople in a futile effort to try to pull a soul into themselves. It doesn’t workthat way, of course, but you can’t exactly talk sense into the half people. Itrapidly became a kind of madness infecting all of them, an obsession, thatoverrode everything else.“They tear living people open, believing the soul they crave is inside. They eatthe insides first, where they think the soul resides. They drink the blood,fearing the soul might leak away. When they aren’t satisfied because theyhaven’t gotten what they want, they strip all the meat from the bones, devouringit, trying to find and consume the soul in the still warm flesh.“If a group of them catches a living person, they will all tear into them,competing for the soul. A cluster of half people will reduce a living person tobones in short order. It’s horrifying. The dead are not even able to beidentified because the half people will use their teeth to peel the face rightoff the skull and eat it. They even suck the brains out of the skull.”“And no one anticipated this?” Merritt asked.“I did, but like I said, no one would listen. When it didn’t happen at first,and everything seemed fine, they were all the more convinced that I was wrong.“The evolution in their nature took a little time, but when it happened, ithappened quickly. They attacked people in the palace, feeding like wolves offthe living who were trying desperately to control them. It was chaos for a time.“That was when I saw my chance and escaped. For all I know, those in charge maybelieve that I was eaten, as were a number of the gifted involved in theproject. It was a terrifying and very bloody time.”“And this is still going on?” Merritt asked.“Yes, but I think they’ve managed to gain some degree of control over thesituation. They would have been able to do that, to some extent at least,because they have altered the Grace in order to use the spirits of thesepeople.”Merritt frowned. “Use their spirits? How can they control spirits in theunderworld beyond the veil?”“When they take the souls of living people to create the half people, thosesouls are not allowed to go to the spirit world. The spirits of the dead theyalso use are pulled back from the world of the dead as well.“These spirits are kept trapped between realms. Unable to get back to theunderworld, they sometimes drift back in this direction and haunt this plane ofexistence.“When I left, the gifted were attempting to channel the need to eat the livinginto the need to instead eat the flesh of the enemy. That way, rather thanhaving to try to find a way to counter such a powerful drive, they insteadredirected it to serve their objective. That makes them an even more terrifyingweapon. The half people are hard to put down, and if they get near your peopleand get the chance, they will rip them open, eating them from the inside out,trying to consume their souls.”“Why are they hard to put down?” Merritt asked.“Because they still have a functioning brain. They can think, plan, scheme,plot, hide, evade, and then attack.”Merritt let out a sigh. “Great. Just great.”Naja spread her hands. She was starting to look worse again.“I hate to sound ungrateful to you both, and I want to help—that’s why I’mhere—but I think that you need to get me to a place where you can finish healingme.”Magda looked up at Merritt. “She’s right. We need to get out of here. We cantalk more later.”Merritt circled an arm around Naja’s waist as she started sagging. “I know justthe place.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 78 As they passed through the opening off the walkway around the inside of theimmense circular stone interior of the great tower and into the sliph’s room,Magda saw Quinn sitting at a table across the room, writing in one of hisjournals. Dominating the center of the room, under a domed ceiling, sat thesliph’s stone well.“Merritt!” Quinn called. He leaned over in his chair to peer past Merritt,helping Naja walk into the room. “And Magda!” Quinn skidded the chair back fromthe table and rushed to meet them. “So good to see you both!”The young wizard was about Magda’s height, and of average build. His ready smilematched his good nature. But it was his brown eyes that were so riveting. Theyhad a quality well beyond his years, an incisive grasp of all they took in, anddespite the intellect behind that astute gaze, the man was always modest whenothers would have been cocky in their knowledge and accomplishments. They werethe eyes of a wise advisor.“Good to see you, too, Quinn,” Merritt said.Quinn’s gaze finally settled on Naja. “Who have we here?”With one arm around Naja’s waist, steadying her, Merritt held his other out inintroduction. “Quinn, I’d like you to meet a friend of ours. This is Naja Moon.”Grinning, staring at the woman for an instant, Quinn remembered his manners andgestured into the room. “Please, Naja, won’t you come in and have a seat. I’mafraid that there is only the one chair, please take it. You look like you mayneed to sit down. Let me get you some water.”“She needs more than water,” Merritt said, getting right down to business. “Sheneeds to be healed.”Quinn regarded the sorceress with a more appraising look. “Yes, I can see that.”Naja showed a brief smile of greeting to Quinn, but declined the offer to sit.“To tell you the truth, Merritt, I don’t think any of you look all that good.”Quinn laid a hand on the side of Magda’s shoulder. “What’s wrong. You lookashen. You don’t look well at all. Maybe you had better sit down.”Magda gently waved off the concern. “Thank you, but we don’t have time for thatat the moment.”“Some things have happened,” Merritt said. “Magda has been healed, but she needsrest to complete the process or she is going to soon go downhill and then she’sgoing to be in trouble.”It was more a warning to Magda than an explanation to Quinn. Magda got thepoint, but it wasn’t really needed. She knew that she was nearing the end of herstrength. It was only her worry after what she had learned from Naja that wasdriving her on at the moment. Her stomach felt like it was in a knot.“I can see that,” Quinn said, a look of concern creasing his brow as he leanedin toward Magda, looking into her eyes for any sign of the trouble. “Whathappened? How were you hurt?”Magda smiled to dispel his concern. “That’s not important at the moment. We havemore urgent business right now.” She looked toward Naja, signaling what shemeant. Quinn got the message.Naja had turned, transfixed by the liquid silver hump of the sliph rising up outof the well that contained her. The swelling bulge of what looked like nothingso much as polished, highly reflective, liquid silver began to rise up until itformed into a head with the aspects of a human face.The quicksilver features resolved fluidly into those of a beautiful woman. Apleasing smile formed in the expression of what looked like nothing so much as asilver statue that was the sliph, except that it always seemed to be moving.“Do you wish to travel?” the sliph asked, her silvery voice echoing around theround room.“No,” Magda said in a blunt tone. “We don’t wish to travel.”“You will be pleased,” the sliph said.“Thank you, but not now,” Merritt said on his way past as he helped Naja towardthe chair.“I’ve heard rumors of such a creature, but I never imagined she was real,” Najasaid as she dragged Merritt to a halt in order to stare at the silver facewatching her.Quinn cast a rather fond look at the creature in the well. “She’s real, there isno doubt of that. She likes to watch me record things in my journals as I watchover her.”“May I touch you?” Naja asked the sliph as she stepped close to the waist-highstone wall of the sliph’s well.“If it pleases you,” came the haunting reply.Naja reached out and carefully touched her fingers to the gently rolling silversurface. The sliph watched. Feeling no ill effects, Naja submerged her entirehand below the surface.“You have both sides,” the sliph said with a satisfied smile. “You may travel.”“Thank you, but I don’t wish to travel right now,” Naja said. “Maybe anothertime.”“When you are ready, I will take you where it pleases you.”Naja looked back over her shoulder at Merritt and Magda. “This is remarkable.”Magda folded her arms. “That’s one way to put it.”Magda held no favor with the sliph. Not only had the sliph often taken Baraccusaway, she took him away as she cooed to him and made gentle promises that hewould be pleased.Baraccus had told Magda that it was just the nature of the sliph, that it didn’tmean anything, and that in any event, there was nothing that could be done aboutit. Magda still hadn’t liked the manner in which the perfect quicksilver facehad spoken so intimately to her husband. Of course, the sliph talked to everyonethat way. Baraccus was right, it was her nature. That didn’t make Magda feel anybetter about it.The sliph had even talked to Magda the same way when Magda had needed to travel.She wasn’t gifted, as was required, but Baraccus had instilled in Magda some bitof magic that enabled her to travel. Traveling was at once a wildly exhilaratingand a terrifying sensation. She hoped never to have to experience it again.Naja withdrew her hand and stepped away from the well. “No, you don’tunderstand. What is remarkable is that this creature has been altered in asimilar way to the half people. Her soul has been fragmented.”Quinn swept his sandy blond hair back. “Half people? What are half people? Whatare you talking about?”Merritt held a hand up. “Listen, Quinn, we have problems.”Quinn’s features took on a serious cast. “So then you’ve heard the rumors thatProsecutor Lothain is going to be named First Wizard? Is that the trouble youmean.”“That’s not the problem I was referring to,” Merritt said.“And it’s not a rumor,” Magda told him. “It’s true.”Quinn’s serious expression turned worried. “Is it really going to happentomorrow, as some say?”“Tomorrow? I haven’t heard that part of it,” Magda said. “What have you heard?”“There’s a lot of rush planning going on. Something big is in the works fortomorrow afternoon in the council chambers. I don’t know what, but it only makessense that it would be the naming of the new First Wizard.” As he gestured toNaja, his eyes again took on that discerning look that Magda knew so well. “Now,what’s this about half people? What are half people?”Before Naja could speak, Merritt did. “Quinn, we don’t have time to explain itat the moment. Right now I need you to listen and do something for me.”Quinn shrugged. “Sure, Merritt, you know I will. Just tell me what you need andconsider it done.”Merritt pulled Naja forward by the arm. “I need you to heal Naja for me. You’vealways been better at healing than me anyway. I have some important things to dothat can’t wait. Once you’ve healed her, she can explain why she’s here, aboutthe half people, and the trouble we’re in.”Quinn glanced at Naja’s face briefly and back to Merritt. “Well, I’ve never seenher before. Can you at least tell me who is she? And how she’s involved inwhat’s going on?”“I was Emperor Sulachan’s spiritist,” Naja said before Merritt could explain. “Icame here to help your people stop him.”Quinn’s brow lifted. “You’re the defector I’ve heard rumored? I could never findout anything about you. People said that it must be gossip and nothing more.”“Not gossip, real.”“Did you get injured escaping, then?”Naja fixed Quinn a serious look. “When I came here I was captured. Men said thatI was a spy and sentenced me to death. They tortured me. That is how I washurt.”“Who did such a thing?” Quinn demanded, looking from one face to another. “Whatmen?”“She doesn’t know who they were,” Magda told him.“They were torturing her to find out if she knows who the traitors in the Keepare and if she has others with her,” Merritt said. “They must be worried aboutbeing discovered.”“And do you know?” Quinn asked Naja.Naja looked genuinely downcast. “No. I’m sorry.”Quinn ran his fingers back through his hair as he walked off a few paces,considering what he’d been told. “This is the very thing I’ve been worriedabout. I’m convinced that there are traitors, or at least spies in the Keep.”Magda and Merritt shared a look.“Do you have any information about such traitors?” Merritt asked. “Have youheard anything from all the wizards and important people who come through hereto use the sliph?”Quinn turned back to them. “No, no one knows anything. I have my suspicions, butI don’t have any evidence to base it on. With the war going badly people aremaking a scapegoat of Baraccus. You know me, Magda, and you know that I believethat Baraccus was our greatest champion, but people are beginning to believeProsecutor Lothain’s contention that Baraccus was responsible for conspiraciesthat have harmed our war effort. He thinks those conspiracies are the source ofthe murders at the Keep. Lothain has been asking a lot of questions aboutBaraccus, trying to find out if he was working with enemy agents.”“I know,” Magda said. “I’ve heard the accusations.”“A lot of people are starting to listen to Lothain’s theories because he hasbeen right so often and so successful at uncovering traitors no one would havesuspected. Fortunately, there are still a lot of people who don’t believe it. Itseems the whole Keep is in turmoil over the discord. From what I’ve heard, thatfriction is beginning to become a problem.”Feeling momentarily faint, Magda had to lean against the side of the sliph’swell. Merritt saw her fading.“Look, Quinn, we have to go. After you heal her, Naja will explain about thewalking dead and the half people. She can fill you in on everything.”“Walking dead?” Quinn blinked. “Does that have to do with the murders down here?Is that what you’re talking about?”“That’s right,” Merritt said. “The enemy is animating the dead with magic andusing them to assassinate important wizards. If you see a dead person walking,use wizard’s fire.”Quinn wiped a hand across his mouth. “This fits with some of the pieces I’vealready put together.”“You hear a lot of talk from wizards and officials using the sliph,” Magda said.“Have you heard anything that would give you any idea who the traitors or spiesmight be?”Quinn gestured toward the table at the back of the room. “Let me go through someof my notes and entries. I’ve talked to a lot of people. Now that I have abetter idea what I’m looking for, I might be able to pull out some importantdetails. After I heal Naja, of course. I’ll let you know tomorrow if I find outanything meaningful.”“Good.” Merritt stepped closer to his friend. “Listen to me, Quinn, this is allvery dangerous. We’re not sure who was torturing Naja, but they are surely thesame people responsible for killing so many of our friends and fellow gifted. Idon’t want you taking any chances. You need to keep this all secret for now.”“I understand,” Quinn said as he gestured out the doorway. “There are emptyrooms up off the tower. My relief watch is due down here soon. I’ll take Naja upto one of those rooms right now to keep her out of sight. As soon as my reliefshows up I’ll go heal her. From the look in her eyes, it will likely take allnight.”“Thanks, Quinn. You’ve got it all right. Naja will fill you in after you healher. We’re going to need your help, then, to get to the bottom of things andcatch the traitors before they kill us all. There are a lot bigger things goingon than you realize.”“I’m glad you came to me,” Quinn said. Magda could see in his eyes that he meantit.Merritt turned to Magda, putting a big hand under her arm. “I need to get you upto your room. You need rest to recover.”“Recover from what?” Quinn asked. “I meant to ask what happened?”“We’ll tell you tomorrow when we talk again,” Merritt said as he started Magdatoward the door. He obviously was getting concerned by her fading strength.On the way to the door, Naja stopped them. She squeezed Magda’s arm. “Thank youboth. I’m going to return your confidence in me, I swear. I’m going to helpyou.”Magda smiled and touched Naja’s cheek. “Thank you, Naja.”Out in the immense, round tower outside the room with the sliph’s well, only afew torches burned higher up on iron landings at intervals in the stairs curvingup around the stone walls. The openings at the top revealed a night sky cloudedover to hide the stars and the moon. Magda looked up at Merritt in the neardarkness.“What is it that you need to do? You told Quinn that you needed to work onsomething.”“I need to work on a way to stop the dead and the half people. We don’t have anytime to waste. When I get you to your room I need to have another look at thecloth hanging that you took out of Isidore’s maze. I need to see the specificalterations she did to the keeper spells.”“Because it stopped the dead?”Merritt nodded. “Because it stopped the dead. I need to do some experiments andtry some things.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 79 Shadow meowed and came running when Magda opened the door. The black cat rubbedagainst her leg, and then against Merritt. Magda leaned down and brieflyscratched the cat’s back.“Have you been a good girl, little one?”The cat answered, as if she had understood the question, with a long mew.“I guess that neither one of us has had dinner.”“You need to eat,” Merritt said as he waved an arm, lighting the lamps in theapartment, “but it can wait until tomorrow. Right now you need to sleep morethan you need food.”Magda put a hand on his shoulder. “Thank you, Merritt. As terrifying aseverything seems right now, it’s comforting to have you on my side in all ofthis.”Merritt smiled. “Thanks to you, we now have the key. That’s a monumentalachievement that is going to be a great asset, and I couldn’t have done itwithout you. It’s all the better for having your strength.”Magda let out a sigh. “It certainly did seem to have taken my strength. I can’tbelieve how weak I feel.”“It’s the sword borrowing your life force. As soon as you get some sleep tofinish your recovery you’ll feel a lot better, I promise.” He gestured off intothe apartment. “Before I leave you, I need to see the cloth from Isidore againso that I can work on some things tonight while you’re resting.”Magda nodded and went back through the white, carved double doors into herbedroom. The bed looked inviting. She retrieved the silky cloth and hurried backout with it. Merritt was gazing around at the place in wonder. She often forgotwhat a beautiful retreat the apartment really was. She was eager to move,though, because it was going to be Lothain’s place, now.“Do you want to take it with you?” she asked as she handed him the foldedfabric.Merritt unfolded the long cloth, holding it up to get a good look at thesymbols. “No. With you in a deep sleep, I’d feel a lot better knowing that youhave this over you, warding off any of the monsters Naja told us about.”“So far as I know, all the murders have been down lower in the Keep. Do youreally think that the dead would come all the way up here?”Merritt stretched the cloth out, looking at it as he spoke. “Your life isn’tworth the risk. I’m the one who gave Isidore the basic keeper spells. I justneed to check some minor details about the modifications she did to them—makesure I have it right in my memory. With something this critical, I don’t want toget it wrong.”She put her hand over his, drawing his gaze. “Merritt, what are we going to doabout all this? How are we going to go about putting a stop to it?”Satisfied with his inspection, Merritt handed her back the cloth as he showedher a brave smile. She thought that it was a nice gesture of him to pretend forher sake.“Tomorrow, Magda. Sleep, get the rest you need, and tomorrow we’ll worry aboutit. You’ll be able to think more clearly after you get the rest you need tofinish healing. We have Quinn working with us now. He’ll be a big help, as willNaja.”Magda smiled at the memory of the stunning sorceress.“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a woman that beautiful.”Merritt’s eyes searched hers. “She’s not nearly as beautiful as you, Magda,” hesaid in a quiet voice that surprised her with not only the words themselves, butthe sincerity in his tone.Merritt caught himself and looked away. “I’m sorry, Magda. I should never havesaid that. You are wife to Baraccus.”She laid a finger along the side of his jaw, turning his face back to hers.“Baraccus is dead. We’re not.”“Still . . .”“It’s all right, Merritt,” she said as she took his arm and walked him to thedoor.Merritt bent and scratched the top of the cat’s head. “You watch out for yourmistress, will you? Watch over her.”Shadow pushed her head against him as she squeezed her eyes closed incontentment. Magda was glad to see that Shadow liked him. The cat was a goodjudge of character.“Where will you be?” she asked. “Where will I be able to find you?”“I’m going to go back to my place down in the city. I have some ideas. I need totry some modifications to Isidore’s spell-forms and then I want to run someintegrity checks on them.”“You’re going to try to make something to keep the dead in their place?” Magdaguessed.“It’s not that simple. Sleep. I’ll come back to the Keep tomorrow. I’ll wait foryou with Quinn. When you’re rested we can talk about it tomorrow. Maybe by thenwe’ll know what the big event is for tomorrow afternoon. By then Naja will behealed, too. She’ll be able to help. We’ll start fresh in the morning.”Magda held the edge of the door and leaned against it. “All right.” As hestarted away, she called out to him. “Merritt, who do you think is responsiblefor all the trouble at the Keep?”He turned back and looked at her for a long moment. “I have my suspicions.”Magda did as well, but she couldn’t be positive. She didn’t want to make amistake in something so important. Getting it wrong could cost all of them theirlives.“Sleep,” he said, pointing back at her in command before starting away down thedark hallway. It made Magda smile.She went to a cupboard and checked inside. She was thankful to find some piecesof salted, dried fish in a jar where she thought she remembered seeing them. Shewas so sleepy that she could hardly stand, but she was also starving and fearedthat if she didn’t have a bite to quell her grumbling stomach she wouldn’t beable to fall asleep. She tore a piece of fish off with her teeth and chewed asshe went to a sideboard that held a pitcher and a washbasin.Shadow followed her, looking up, tail high in the air, meowing the entire way.Magda sucked the salt off a chunk of the fish for a moment and then bent andgave it to the cat. Shadow looked as ravenous as Magda felt. While the catcrouched over her meal, Magda poured a glass of water and washed down the saltedfish. She drained the entire glass. It felt good to have some food in herstomach, even if it wasn’t much.When she looked up at herself in the mirror, she was mildly horrified by whatshe saw. Her face was dirty and her hair, even though it was short now andeasier to manage, was still a mess. She hadn’t realized that Merritt had seenher looking so disheveled and dirty. He must have thought she looked like anurchin. But he had said she was beautiful. Such a compliment felt good comingfrom a man as handsome as Merritt. Still . . .Magda dunked a washcloth in the basin and wrung it out. Her face felt grimy fromher trip down to the dungeon. She saw that her hands were dirty with rust fromthe iron railing down there. She reminded herself of Naja’s condition and thenfelt rather foolish for worrying about the way she looked.As she washed her hands and face, Shadow jumped up on the sideboard, hoping foranother handout. Magda smiled and after sucking the salt off, gave the hungrycat another piece of the fish.Sitting on the sideboard, Shadow hunched over her second helping. In the middleof chewing the fish, she jerked her head up. She dropped the fish as she staredat the door.The cat rose up on her tiptoes, back arched, tail puffed up. Fangs showing,Shadow hissed.Magda stood frozen, eyes wide."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 80 Someone knocked.Magda stood frozen at the sideboard. Her heart pounded. The black cat was stillhissing.Magda couldn’t remember if she had thrown the bolt on the door. When the handleturned and the door started opening, that answered her question. She backed up afew steps, wondering where she could run. There was the balcony in the bedroom.It was several stories off the ground, though.When he strolled into the room, Lothain swept out an arm, lighting a few more ofthe lamps, all the better to see his bull neck, short wiry hair, and his blackeyes as they fixed on her.Fists at her side, Magda stormed toward where he stood at the door. “How dareyou enter without permission?”“I knocked,” he said casually, dismissing her objection.Out the doorway, in the hall, Magda could see a large contingent of his personalguard in their green tunics. She was puzzled to also see about a dozen women intheir midst. Magda realized that they were some of the staff.“This is a poor time to come to claim your apartment,” she said. “I told you, Iwould move as soon as I could.”With his eyes still fixed on her, he smiled. “I haven’t come to claim myapartment, I have come to claim my wife.”“Your wife?” Magda’s jaw clenched as she felt her rage build. “Get out!”When Lothain gestured, two of the big guards stepped into the room and seizedher by the arms, one man on each side. Magda struggled only momentarily, quicklyrealizing that it was only liable to entertain them all to watch her struggling,helpless to do anything about it.“In here,” Lothain said to the women out in the hall. “Bring your things inhere.”Magda was surprised, when the women filed in, to see all the women carryingthings: sewing baskets, small chests, rolls of lace, and dozens of bolts ofcloth of every color.“What do you think you’re doing?” Magda asked Lothain.He followed Magda’s gaze to the women. “Seamstresses. They’re here to make yourwedding dress for tomorrow’s ceremony. I’m to be named First Wizard, so Ithought that would be the appropriate moment for us to be wed. It will settlematters, reassure people, and bring everyone together in support of me.”“You’re crazy if you think—”“That’s enough,” Lothain said in a dangerous tone. “It’s time you learned yourplace.” He gestured with a tilt of his head to the two men who were holding heras he turned and went out into the hall. When he was sure that they had her wellin hand, he marched off down the hallway without further word.Magda had to walk swiftly to keep from being dragged by the men who had her armsin a firm grip. At least another dozen soldiers followed behind them, while evenmore waited back at her apartment.“Where are you taking me?” she demanded to his broad back.Lothain glanced back over his shoulder. “I’m taking you to a place where we candiscuss my marriage proposal. I need you to see something before you say no tomy offer of marriage. I think it will put you in mind to be agreeable. Ourmarriage will be for the good of the Keep and the good of our cause. I’m goingto show you one of the great benefits of your agreeing that it is best for allif you agree to marry me.”Magda decided not to waste her energy telling him that there was nothing thatcould make her agree to marry him. She tried not to fight the men dragging heralong. Several times she stumbled but it didn’t slow them.She didn’t fight them. She needed to conserve what strength she had. If shecould ever get to her knife, she was going to need her strength.Lothain took several turns as he led them down a series of halls to a servicearea. A utility room where supplies and provisions were kept in the back alsohad a space for staff to gather for instructions before going about theirduties. Without pause, Lothain opened a door and went inside, going through anouter gathering room where more of his guards in their green tunics waited. Hewent through an open door in the back into a darker inner room.There, tied in a chair, sagged a weeping Tilly. She was a bloody mess. Guardstowered all around her.“Tilly!”Magda broke from the guards and rushed to the woman, falling to her knees beforeher. Tilly’s terrified gaze met Magda’s.“Tilly, what’s going on? What have they done to you?”Before Magda could say another word, or Tilly could answer, the men snatchedMagda’s arms again and hauled her back up and away from the woman in the chair.Tilly’s hair was matted with blood. It looked like some of her teeth had beenknocked out when her face had been pounded. Her nose looked crooked and her eyeswere blackened. Blood dripped in thick strings from her chin, soaking the frontof her dress.Filled with rage, Magda turned her eyes to Lothain. “What is the meaning of thisoutrage?”A humorless smile widened his mouth. “The meaning of it is to help you make upyour mind to do the right thing.”“The right thing? You do this and talk to me of the right thing?”The last piece of the puzzle had just fit into place for her. She now knew.“Yes, the right thing. You see, whether this friend of yours lives or dies is upto you, Lady Searus. If you make the right choice, then she lives. If not . . .well, I believe you get the point.”Lothain turned and gestured to one of the guards. Without hesitation, he pulledTilly’s arm out straight. She screamed “No! No! No!” over and over, but to noavail.With one powerful blow, the man broke Tilly’s arm.Magda jumped in shock at the loud crack when the bone snapped.Tilly screamed and struggled wildly. “Please! Please! No more! Mistress! Please!Make them stop!”The guard stuffed a wadded rag in her mouth to silence her.Magda panted in fury, tears streaming down her face as she struggled in vainagainst the muscle holding her.“Now,” Lothain said, “this is the way it’s going to be. If you agree to gothrough with the marriage tomorrow afternoon before the council and gathereddignitaries as I am installed as First Wizard, and don’t in any way cause ascene, but rather act in a gracious manner that will help bring our peopletogether under the rule of their new First Wizard, then Tilly here will befreed.”“And if I refuse?” Magda asked, already knowing the answer.His smile returned. “Well, of course you know that it will go very badly for heruntil she eventually dies. I will take you to visit her every day as she istortured. And then . . .”When she didn’t ask what he meant was next, he leaned a little closer. “Andthen, there are a number of your other friends who are going to pay the sameprice. We have a whole list. Your friend who used to be on the council? Sadler?”He arched an eyebrow as he held out a hand and folded a finger down. “Sadlerwill suffer a similar fate, all because you refuse to do the right thing.“Your friend Quinn? The young man you grew up with?”Lothain folded another finger down as he watched her eyes. He went on to nameother longtime friends, folding a finger down each time he spoke a name. When heran out of fingers, he opened his hand and started over naming people she knewand folding over a finger with the mention of each one.“We know where each one of them is, and we have men standing by, keeping an eyeon them in case they are needed,” he said. “I have but to give them the word andevery one of those people will be suffering just like Tilly here by the end oftomorrow. Each one of those people will know that it is because you havedemonstrated through your selfishness, your unwillingness to help the people ofthe Midlands, that it is because you are a traitor and you have brought the samefate down on them, since they, too, must be part of your conspiracy.“Like you, they will be charged and found guilty of treason against theMidlands. Under torture, they will all eventually confess. They will all go totheir eventual deaths cursing your name.“You will be able to hear them cursing your name because you will be chained upclose enough to hear their every scream. And then, when every one of them passesbeyond the veil into the world of the dead, we will start in on you, and I canassure you, for being the leader of such a vile conspiracy against the Midlands,we will save the best till last. And I promise you, when we are finished withyou, you will confess. Publicly.”Magda swallowed. She was trembling all over.“Now, Lady Searus, we have seamstresses standing by, back in the apartment ofthe First Wizard, my apartment, waiting to make you the wedding dress of yourchoice. I’m a generous man. The choice is to be up to you. They will make anydress you wish to be wed in. You see? I wish you to be pleased. Now that I thinkof it, though, I guess I would prefer that it not be white, because, well, youhave been married to a First Wizard before.“We have food and drink being prepared for tomorrow afternoon’s grand event. Wehave people from far and wide coming to attend the momentous gathering, everyonehoping to see the Midlands brought back together under a new First Wizard,hoping to see Lady Searus leading the way by giving her hand in marriage to thenew First Wizard, showing that she places her trust in me, and thus, so canthey.“So, you see, the choice is yours.”Magda tried to think, but listening to Tilly’s muffled cries was making itimpossible to think. She couldn’t figure out what she could do. She couldn’tcome up with a way out of it.And then she realized that there was nothing to think about. There was nochoice.Magda swallowed again. “All right.”“All right, what?” He smiled a wicked smile. “If you accept my proposal ofmarriage, then say it.”With Tilly’s life hanging in the balance, this was no time to tempt his temper.Magda had never felt so low, so humiliated.“Yes, First Wizard Lothain, I accept your proposal of marriage. I’ll do it. I’lldo as you say.”“And exactly as I say. With grace and dignity.”“Yes. Just as you say. I promise. Now let her go.”Lothain smiled at Tilly’s wide-eyed terror. He turned back to Magda. “In duetime, my dear. In due time.”“What does that mean?”“It means that after you keep your word, after everyone sees that you arerecanting all the accusations you made against me in the depth of your mindlessgrief, and after you prove to everyone your sincerity in that retraction bybecoming my wife to show your support of me and your belief that I am the man tobe First Wizard, then we will release her. But not before.“If you carry out your part with a smile and gracious good cheer at myappointment as well as our marriage, all your other friends will never know howclose they came to suffering a terrible fate. Their lives will be in your hands.If you do as you have promised, then they will celebrate in your joy at beingthe new wife to the new First Wizard.”Magda was nodding. “As long as you promise to keep your word.”“My word? My dear, my word has nothing to do with it. You carry out your part,do as you are told, and I will see if you have been cooperative enough towarrant me granting mercy to Tilly here, and to all the rest of your friends.But I can tell you that if you do it all correctly, and make everyone believe inyour sincerity, then I will be in such a good mood that I will be far moreinterested in the pleasure you will bring me on our wedding night than harminganyone. Do we understand each other?”Magda swallowed back her rage. “Yes.”“Good.” He smiled. “Good.” Lothain turned and patted Tilly on the cheek. “She isa good person, is she not?”Tilly, tears of pain and terror streaming down her cheeks, nodded. Magda doubtedthat Tilly even knew why she was nodding.“Don’t worry, Tilly,” Magda said. “I will do what I have to do to keep yousafe.”Tilly’s eyes squeezed closed as she wept. Magda could just make out her muffledwords of gratitude.Lothain lifted Magda’s chin. “You know, I was going to kill you for all thetrouble you’ve caused, but then it came to me that it would be much better tosubvert you instead and have you undo all the harm yourself. Much bettersolution all around, don’t you think? Better that you live to see it, than to bedead and unaware of my triumph.”“You had better let her go after I do what you want.”Lothain chuckled. “I don’t care about this scrub woman. She means nothing to me.I have no need to kill her. It’s all up to you what happens to her.”“I told you that I would do as you say.”“Indeed you did. And I believe you mean it.” He leaned back a little as he tookher in with an appraising look. “You are so weak that you would do it to save ahandful of lives. You foolishly value the life of an individual over the greatergood.“You don’t have the courage it takes to be a part of such an epic struggle.“That is why you are a nobody.”He gestured to the guards. “Take her back to her room so that she can have thewomen there make her wedding dress. Stand guard out in the hall tonight. No onegoes in or leaves but the seamstresses.”The men saluted before yanking Magda away.She could hear Tilly weeping behind her.The corridors she was dragged though were empty. The Home Guard had apparentlybeen dismissed by the prosecutor’s private army. The men’s bootsteps echoedthrough the halls. The Keep was gradually being subverted by Lothain’s loomingrule. His influence, his control, was tainting everything and everyone.In the depths of her despair, as the men were dragging Magda down the hall, in acrystal-clear instant of inspiration, it came to her.Magda knew what she had to do.More clearly than anything she had ever known before, Magda knew what she had todo."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 81 “Are you sure, Mistress?” The seamstress stretched her arm out to indicate allthe choices that had been laid out. “Wouldn’t you like something a little moreresplendent? After all, this is a big occasion, a big moment in your life infront of so many people. Wouldn’t something with more dazzle be appropriate?”Magda smiled her assurance to the concerned woman. “Thank you, but I believethat my choice is quite striking. Adding layers of lace, needlepoint, and beadsisn’t necessarily an improvement. There is power in simplicity.”The woman’s face was a tapestry of worry lines. “If you say so, Mistress.”“I do.” Magda, driven by an overriding purpose, made an effort to soundpleasant. “Please, make it exactly as I have shown you I want it done.”The seamstress nodded reluctantly. “Yes, Mistress.”It was clear that the women were concerned that they would be blamed for lessthan a masterpiece of layered glamour.“And I don’t want any of you to worry,” Magda said to all the women watchingher. “I will let it be known that the dress was my choice, and my choice alone.”That seemed to ease the tension in the room somewhat.Having forced herself to set aside her outrage and horror, Magda had managed togather her senses as she had been dragged back to her apartment. She knew thatshe had to think everything through clearly and deliberately. If she gave in topanic, or worse, resignation, she would be unable to act effectively.Magda held no illusions about Lothain’s potential for cruelty, so while wasworried for Tilly, she knew that she had done everything she could for themoment to give Tilly the best chance. She couldn’t dwell on it.With a firm plan in mind, she had felt a resolute calm come over her. She knewwhat she had to do.“And which material, Lady Searus?” the seamstress asked.Dozens of bolts of cloth were laid out on two of the couches. There werebeautiful prints as well as a wide variety of colors and exotic tone-on-tonefabrics. In addition there were yards and yards of lacework of every sort.But Magda had spotted the right one the very first moment.As far as Magda was concerned, there was only one choice among the wideassortment. She wanted no other.She pointed to a simple, silken material. “This one.”The woman looked up. Worry returned to etch itself back into her expression.“Are you sure, Mistress? Master Lothain said he didn’t think it should bewhite.”“I’m sure that he was referring to a bright white. This isn’t exactly abrilliant white. I’m sure he meant that he didn’t want it to be a glaring white,that’s all.“Besides, my future husband is not the one who will be wearing the dress. I am.This will be my day. I want to look my best.” Magda smiled warmly and sought tomake it clear that she would not be dissuaded. “I think this one, this slightlyoff-white material, is absolutely beautiful for the purpose, don’t you agree? Ilove the sheen of it. It’s the most elegant of all the material here. There isnone its match. It’s beautiful. I love it. It’s perfect for the purpose.”“The purpose?”“My rebirth.”The woman blinked. The others, getting out shears and preparing all the needlesand thread, shared furtive looks but said nothing.“Rebirth, Mistress?” the first woman asked.“Yes,” Magda said, her fingers leaving the lustrous material as her gazereturned to the woman staring up at her. “This will be my rebirth into a newperson. Marriage is changing from a single woman into a woman devoted to herhusband’s wishes, is it not? So, since I am about to be reborn into a newperson, this fits the purpose.”The seamstress smiled, even though she still looked anxious. “I see your point,Mistress.”“You have all my measurements, then? You’re finished with all that? You haveeverything you need?”“Yes, Mistress.”“Good. I’ve had a very trying day. I need to get a good night’s sleep to beready for the big day tomorrow. For my rebirth, as it were.”The woman, still unsure, held up a finger before Magda left. “Mistress, aboutthe cut. Master Lothain was very clear that he wanted the dress to show a lot ofcleavage. I don’t mean to contradict your wishes, but—”“Then don’t. My future husband, in his eagerness, is simply getting ahead ofhimself. He can wait.” Some of the women tittered. “Please make the dress as Ihave drawn it out.”The seamstress’s smile widened. “Yes, Mistress. Of course. We have everything weneed. The dress will be exactly to your design, I swear. We will finish it andleave it out here for you, and then close the doors on our way out so that youmay get your rest. We will not disturb your sleep.”Magda made herself smile. She touched the woman’s shoulder in gratitude.“Thank you, ladies. Good night then.”On her way toward the back bedroom, Magda found the folded pieces of paper inher pocket, along with the collection of small clay figures. It was the gravityspell that Merritt had given to her.She stood staring at the paper in her hand, the little figures floating in theair above her palm, thinking.She finally stuffed it all back into her pocket and went through the open doubledoors to her bedroom.“Good night, ladies,” she said again as she closed and bolted the white doubledoors into the bedroom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 82 Lothain had told his men that they should remain in the hallway outside theapartment all night to make sure that no one went in and that she didn’t leave.The guards all knew, of course, that they were several stories above thesurrounding portions of the Keep. The soldiers in green tunics who had broughther back to the apartment all knew that the only way she would be able to leavewas back out through the doors into the corridor where they stood guard.Since they knew she couldn’t sneak past them, it seemed to her highly unlikelythey would have any reason to come into the apartment, much less her bedroom.Lothain was covetous of her. They weren’t going to want to give the man cause tobe suspicious of what they might be doing with her. Magda was relativelyconfident that they would stand guard but not want to come into the apartmentwithout direct orders.In any event, she couldn’t worry about the off chance that they would come inand check on her. She would simply have to be quick about it. She had to do whatwas necessary, or she was going to find herself the wife of the new First WizardLothain.Without delay, Magda went to the big maple wardrobe that had belonged toBaraccus. His clothes still hung where he had left them. Magda hadn’t known whatto do with them, so she had simply left them there. Before he had killedhimself, he had left his war-wizard outfit in the First Wizard’s enclave. Thewardrobe held a variety of other clothes, everything from old pants and shirtshe wore when working at his workbench to elaborate ceremonial robes. She pushedthe ceremonial robes aside to reach in on the side as far as she could.Magda pushed in the right spot, and the door over a hidden compartment slidopen. Baraccus had made the hiding place himself. Reaching inside, her fingersfound the knotted rope hanging from a peg. She pulled it out, relieved that itwas still there.There had been times when Baraccus had to meet people under cover of darkness,and for the safety of the men he was meeting, those meetings had to be keptsecret. Had he left the apartment by the front door and gone out through thecorridors, all kinds of people would have known about it. Whenever he went outin the Keep there were always eyes watching him. He’d said that he never knewthe motives of the people who saw him.If he had been seen leaving the Keep in the middle of the night, word would haveeventually gotten around. People would have wondered what he was doing, where hewas going, who he was seeing. As it was, as careful as Baraccus had been, itseemed that Lothain had found out about at least some of the late-nightmeetings.In an attempt to keep such meetings secret, Baraccus had kept a knotted ropehidden in his wardrobe so that he would be able to leave from the bedroombalcony. It was a drop of several stories, so people would not be expecting himto leave that way.The rope was exactly the right length to make it safely all the way down to ashallow slate roof. The roof led to a rampart where there were old, unusedexterior stairs that were hidden from view. Magda knew how to make her way fromthere without being seen.She grabbed a clean, black, hooded cloak and threw it around her shoulders. Shewent to a cabinet and pulled her shielded travel lantern out by its wire handle.With a long splinter that she lit in one of the reflector lamps on the wall, sheset flame to the wick of her travel lantern. Once the wick was adjusted low, sheshut the curved metal door and latched it so it wouldn’t give off any lightuntil she wanted it to, then hooked it on her belt.Magda went to the bedroom doors and carefully checked the bolt to reassureherself that the doors were locked. Across the bedroom, she went out theleaded-glass door onto the balcony. It was heavily overcast and black as pitch.Fortunately, there were a few lights around the Keep that let her see what shewas doing.Magda knelt at the edge of the balcony and slipped her hand out through thebalusters, feeling over the edge for the heavy hook that Baraccus had sunk intothe stone with the aid of magic. Her fingers found the hook. She slipped theloop on the end of the rope over the hook, then fed the rest of the rope outbetween the balusters.Once she was confident that it was secure, she climbed over the railing and wasable to lower herself down and get ahold of the rope. She started down, catchingthe knots between her feet for support as she carefully descended hand overhand. She had never used the rope before, and it was frightening hanging inmidair in the darkness, but she kept her mind on the task and before long shetouched down on the slate roof.She was glad that it was a dark night so that no one would see her leaving.She followed the rooftop until she reached the rampart, then ran until she foundthe small opening for the stairs. With no time to waste, she took them down twoat a time."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 83 Magda staggered to a stop. She put her hands on her knees as she caught herbreath. Her legs ached. In fact, her whole body ached. She knew that Merritt wasright about her needing rest. That inexorable requirement after giving herselfover to the completion of the sword was rapidly catching up with her. Her lungsburned, making her cough.She knew that if she didn’t get rest, and soon, she ran the risk of collapsing.But she couldn’t stop, not yet.She’d walked the Keep road down to the city countless times, but the low,threatening clouds hid the moon, making it hard to see. At least they reflectedsome of the isolated lights down in the city of Aydindril and it was enough forher to be able to make out roads when they came in from the sides. With thoselandmarks she knew where she was.This part of the road coming down the mountain from the Keep to Aydindril woundits way through dense forests. She knew that the trees would soon thin out andthen she might be able to see a little better. The thing that she had to becareful of was that to her left, around some of the turns in the road, therewere steep drop-offs. Carelessly taking a step too far off the edge of the roadin the darkness would likely be the last step she ever made.From time to time on the way down, she had stopped and cracked open the door onher lantern to be sure of her surroundings and where she was. Each time, as soonas she got her bearings, she quickly closed the lantern door. With the danger ofspies in and about Aydindril, the Home Guard was on the lookout for anysuspicious activity. She didn’t want any patrolling soldiers to spot her andcome to see who she was and what she was doing.As she panted, catching her breath, a few fat, cold drops of rain splatteredagainst her head and shoulders. She hoped it didn’t start coming down inearnest. Her breath back, she started running again.Before long, as she entered the city, the reflected light off the clouds wasenough for her to make out the road and the buildings to the sides. A littlefarther into the city the street narrowed because it passed between buildingsthat were shops on the first floor, with living space above. They were all dark.It was still quite a distance to Merritt’s house, so, head down, she ignored herburning leg muscles and drove herself on at a quick pace. When she heard someodd noises up ahead, she stopped cold and looked up.Ahead in the darkness, still off a ways on the narrow street, she saw a group ofmen coming toward her. They weren’t carrying any lamps, so it was hard to tellhow many there were, but the bunch of them looked to be a goodly number. Shestared with wide eyes, trying to tell who they were.And then, as they passed a shop with candlelight coming from a window, she sawthe glint of light off swords at their hips. Several men had upright pikes.They were soldiers, probably a patrol of the Home Guard. There looked to bemaybe eight or ten of them.Before the patrol saw her, Magda quickly ducked into the alleyway to her left.She ran a map of the city through her head and realized that, rather thanfollowing the route she’d been planning on taking, she could actually take ashortcut to Merritt’s house and probably save some time, as well as stay out ofsight from the patrol. She didn’t know why she hadn’t thought of it before. Sheguessed that she was so drained of strength that it kept her from thinkingstraight. She reminded herself that her survival depended on thinking clearly.She hurried up the alley, trying to put distance between her and the end of thealley where the soldiers would pass by. She knew that patrols sometimes tookgifted with them to sense people who might be hiding. When she heard themapproaching the intersection where she had gone into the alley, she slipped intothe narrow space between two buildings to hide. She held the lantern behind herin case there was any crack in the metal door that might be spotted if one ofthe soldiers looked her way.Magda peeked out with one eye. She could see them, off in the distance, as theypassed by the end of the alley. It was hard to tell, but she was pretty surethat she was right, that there were eight to ten of them. She hadn’t thoughtthat patrols were typically that large.She saw, then, that one of the men in their midst appeared to be restrained withsome kind of device around his neck with a bar in front. It looked like maybehis wrists were manacled to the end of the bar.That explained the number of men. They had taken someone into custody. Soldierstypically took a larger contingent when they went to apprehend a criminal. Shesupposed that it was easier to catch a man in his bed than to try to run himdown in the day.Once the soldiers and their prisoner had gone past the alley, Magda cautiouslyemerged from her hiding place and checked in all directions for any sign ofother soldiers. When she saw nothing and everything was dead quiet, she rushedoff up the alley. She trotted to cover ground as quickly as possible. She didn’tthink she had it in her to run anymore. At least the brief sprinkle had stopped,but she worried that the clouds still threatened rain.When she reached a cross street with a two-story brick building that sheremembered, she squinted in the darkness across the road. She saw a sign hangingover a door. It was the right size, but she couldn’t tell if it had a blue pigpainted on it. Around the corner, though, she could see the narrow streetfollowing rolling, uneven ground. It was the right place. She turned up thestreet toward Merritt’s house.When she at last saw a forked plum tree in the front of the little porch, shelet out a sigh, thankful to have found the place so quickly in the dark. Lightcame from the window to the side of the house, so she knew that Merritt wasstill up working.She knocked just loud enough that she thought he would hear her but theneighbors wouldn’t. She hoped that dogs didn’t start barking and rouse people.When Merritt didn’t answer the door, she knocked a little harder. When sheknocked harder, the door swung in a little. It wasn’t latched.“Merritt?” she called out in a quiet voice. “Merritt?”She thought that maybe he was out back, so she slipped inside. She pushed thedoor closed behind her as she looked around. She didn’t see him. A few lanternswere lit in the room, but Merritt wasn’t there.She went to the back, looking out, but it was pitch black. She went to a darkdoorway and opened the metal cover on her lantern, throwing light into the darkbedroom. The bed was empty. She couldn’t imagine where he could be.On the way back through the house, weaving her way through the assortment ofobjects lying about all over the floor, she froze in midstride. In front of thetable with the red velvet cloth, the chair was lying on its side.The Sword of Truth, in its sheath, still hanging from the back of the chair, layon the floor.Magda righted the chair. She stood staring at the sword.Merritt wouldn’t leave the sword. He had never left it before, and he certainlywouldn’t leave it since completing its transition into the key to the boxes ofOrden.And then she saw a small piece of green cloth snagged on one of the metalobjects standing nearby. It was the same wool material and the exact same greencolor as the tunics worn by the soldiers of the prosecutor’s office. The samesoldiers in green tunics who were guarding her apartment. The same soldiers ingreen tunics who had brutalized Tilly. The same soldiers in green tunics thatwere Lothain’s private army.She remembered, then, the soldiers with a prisoner she had seen only a shorttime before. They were headed toward the Keep.It was too much to be a coincidence.Magda pulled off her black cloak and threw it on the table. She slipped thebaldric over her head, laying it on her right shoulder, placing the scabbardwith the sword at her left hip. Once it was securely in place, she put her cloakback on, hiding the sword, and headed for the door.In her mind, she swiftly plotted a variety of routes through the city. All thetimes when she had been a young girl, running with friends through the city,were paying off as she considered the fastest way to intercept the soldiers.She needed to get out ahead of them and cut them off.She wondered briefly what she thought she was going to do to make them releaseMerritt.As she ran out the door of his house, she knew only that she had to get Merrittaway from those big soldiers in those green tunics."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 84 Magda raced down dirt alleyways, jumped fences, and cut through yards, taking adiagonal course through the city rather than take the easier but longer routealong the streets. In places along the way, she dashed down the narrow spacesbetween buildings. Once, she encountered an impassable barrier of stacked junkat the end and had to retrace her steps, going around the other side, only to bestopped by a tall fence. She managed to pull herself up and over the fence sothat she didn’t have to find another route.As she ran past houses, dogs in the yards charged toward her, barking andsnapping. Fortunately, the ones she encountered were tied on ropes, or inside,and couldn’t get to her. Their barking made other dogs nearby bark, though.Soon, it seemed that half the dogs in the city were all barking. Here and thereMagda saw lamplight brighten in windows as wicks were turned up.She knew that if the soldiers heard the sounds of dogs barking coming evercloser to them, they would get suspicious.Magda stopped just shy of an intersection and leaned back against the shortstone wall for a moment, gulping air and catching her breath while still out ofsight of the street. She opened the door on her lantern a crack and carefullypeeked around the corner. She had been running with such abandon that she wasn’tsure of exactly where she was.As she held the lantern out around the corner, light fell on closely spacedbuildings that she recognized. Signs hanging out front advertised several smallbusinesses: a cobbler; a seamstress; and a carpenter’s shop. Just up the streetto the right, she knew that there would be a road coming down off the lowerparts of the mountain that intersected the street.That was the one road she needed. It made a loop past a few homes and a numberof storehouses that held grains and dry goods. A little higher up, the side roadreconnected back with the main road going up to the Keep.Without taking time to finish catching her breath, Magda shut the door on herlantern and raced off up the street. If she got there too late, she had nochance. Without pause, when she reached it, she took the road that angled off upthe hill and curved up along the skirt of the mountain. She could just see thelights of the Keep high above.It was harder running uphill. Her legs burned from the effort. She feared thatthey might give out at any moment, but she knew that she dared not slow. If shedidn’t get out in front of those men before they made it up to the Keep, sheknew that she wouldn’t have a chance. If they got past her, she’d likely neverbe able to find where they took Merritt.The Keep was immense. There were places all over the Keep where they could hidehim. For all Magda knew, they might take him to an obscure room like the onewhere they had taken Tilly. There were thousands of rooms in the Keep. She wouldnever be able to find him. And if they took him to the prosecutor’s offices,with his private army headquartered there, she would never get in.In all likelihood, though, they would take him down to the dungeons where Najahad been. Magda didn’t think that she would have a chance to make it in thereagain. After the two dungeon guards had been killed, not only would the men downthere be on alert, they would probably double or triple the guard.The smell of pines and fir trees got stronger the higher up the road she ran.Magda could at last hear a small brook off in the darkness. She knew the brookand where it was located above the buildings. Finally out of the city, she foundherself running past the dark shapes of towering trees.Abruptly, she came to the intersection with the main road up to the Keep. Magdawas terrified that they might have already passed by. She feared being too late.As she stood in the center of the intersection gulping air and catching herbreath, trying in vain to see in the darkness, she heard voices in the distance.They were deep voices interspersed with fragments of laughter. She was relievedthat they were coming from down lower on the road, in the direction of the city.Magda rushed up the road, toward the Keep, around a sharp bend to a spot werethe road narrowed. She wanted a place that wasn’t open to the sides so that themen couldn’t spread out and easily get around her. The voices were gettingcloser.She found a place that looked about as good a spot for her purpose as she wasliable to find on short order. Besides, she didn’t have any time to spare. Sheset the lantern down in the center of the road, placing it so that the closeddoor aimed in the direction of the approaching men.Magda didn’t want to consider the wisdom of her hasty plan too carefully becauseit was the only plan she had. She could think of no other idea, and besides,there simply was no time left. She had no choice but to try.If it didn’t work, she would likely die. If she didn’t try, they were all goingto die anyway.She crouched behind the lantern, waiting. Her hammering heart was making herrock on the balls of her feet.She briefly thought that she must be crazy to think it would work. She had nochoice. Either it worked, or they were all dead anyway.She could hear the sound of gravel crunching under the boots of the men comingher way as they rounded the bend a short distance down the hill. They weren’ttalking any longer. She couldn’t see them. Only the sound of their boots toldher where they were.When she judged that the group of men was as close as she dared let them get toher, she threw open the door of the lantern. Light fell across about a dozenstartled faces. They blinked in the sudden light. They weren’t the Home Guard.They wore the green tunics of Lothain’s private army, as she had expected.Magda stood and backed a few steps behind the lantern so that she would be indarkness and the men wouldn’t be able to see her.In the lantern light, when a couple of the big men spread out defensively, shespotted Merritt in their midst.He had an iron collar around his neck, with a short iron bar coming out from thefront of it. His hands were shackled to the end of the iron bar. His ankles werehobbled with a length of chain short enough to prevent him from running.Blood ran down the side of his face. He looked groggy.Magda focused her rage. It didn’t take an effort.“You are surrounded,” she said in a loud, clear, commanding voice. “Let theprisoner go or you will all die.”One of the men stepped forward. In the light coming from the open door of herlantern, she could see that he was not a soldier. He wore simple robes. Shecould see the deep scowl twisting his features. Even though it was dark, shethought that she could see the gift in his eyes.When he lifted his hand and fire ignited in the air above his palm, Magda knew.It was a wizard.“Magda Searus?” he said. “Magda Searus, is that you?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 85 The man in the robes was not half a dozen strides from her. Magda had seen himbefore. He worked in the lower regions of the Keep. She didn’t know the wizard’sname, but he knew hers. Most likely because when she had been with Baraccus hehad stopped briefly to talk to the man a few times, as he had talked to a numberof wizards. A lot of people knew her because she was Baraccus’s wife and theysaw her with him, but she hadn’t known the names of all those people he spoketo.“Let him go and your lives will be spared,” she said. “You are surrounded. Do asI say or you will all die. I’ll not warn you again.”Worried, the soldiers peered around into the darkness.There was a brief moment of silence, and then the grim-faced wizard spoke.“I sense no one but you,” he said in a surly voice. “You are all alone out here.There is no one with you.”In the lantern light she could see the soldiers grin.Almost without thought, Magda slipped her hand inside her cloak, tightlywrapping her fingers around the hilt of the sword. The word Truth pressed intoher palm. Through that connection, she could feel something stir and seem tocome alive. It seemed to be coming neither from the sword nor from her, but camealive through that connection.She felt the promise of something powerful and merciless in the connection.Without warning, the wizard flicked his hand toward her. In the lantern lightMagda could see the air waver.The bolt of power just missed, flicking her hair as she dove aside and drew thesword.The clear ring of its blade filled the night air with a haunting threat ofviolence.With the blade freed, Magda felt a storm of power surge from the hilt and upthrough her. As it inundated her, it made her flesh tingle and took her breath.Exquisite rage thundered through every fiber of her being.The men all drew weapons.The wizard, angry that he had missed, pulled his arms back to conjure yet moremagic. He looked more annoyed than angry that she had not fallen to his firststrike. She knew that this time he would not be so timid in what he calledforth.A roiling ball of fire ignited in his palm. The liquid flames rolled and burnedwith a sinister bluish light.Indeed, he did not intend to take any more chances. He was intending to loosewizard’s fire against her.Magda knew that she had to act fast or she would die. The sword reactedinstantly to her intent, unleashing a surge of fury through her that charged hermuscles.Even as the wizard was cocking his arm back, Magda was already flying toward theman, closing the distance, trying to get to him before he was able to send thedeadly fire toward her. As she ran, the blade swept around with lightning speed,whistling through the air.Her glare was locked on the wizard’s murderous scowl. She was only dimly awareof the sword’s tremendous momentum. She knew only that it felt right. It feltgood. She guided its track through her intent as the blade made its wayinexorably toward where her eyes were fixed.She wanted this man dead. She focused all her rage at everything that hadhappened into her need to end this traitor’s life.It seemed to take forever to close the distance.She could see the wizard frantically working with both hands to expand thewizard’s fire between his palms, to make it more deadly and ready to kill. Shecould see the indignation in his eyes that she would dare to come at him.She intended far more than merely to come at him.For both of them, it was a race to kill or be killed.The blade won the race. With a loud crack it intercepted the side of thewizard’s skull.Fragments of bone and gore filled the night. In the lantern’s light she couldsee the cloud of blood and brain matter explode away from where most of his headhad been only an instant before. Only the base of his skull and his jawremained. A trail of blood followed the arc of the blade.The wizard hadn’t even had time to scream.But Magda heard herself screaming, screaming with ferocity that was a match forthe sword’s.The killing strike thrilled her, filled her with wild joy. It was nothing shortof a sense of magnificent completion.As the blade came around, his headless body was still falling. Parts of his headstill sailed away into the night. His arms were lifted out at his sides, thewizard’s fire smothered by his instant death and massive loss of blood.Behind the wizard, the soldiers were momentarily frozen in shock at the sight.That shock broke all at once. With weapons raised, they screamed as they chargedin toward her.Magda sidestepped the first man to rush in. As she did, she came around,bringing the blade with her in a circle to split his skull from behind. Thestrike took off the top of his head. A clump of dark hair flew off into thedarkness. His forward momentum drove him face-first into the hard ground.Magda ducked under a mighty swing of another man’s sword. He wasn’t used tofighting someone as small and fast as Magda. His method was mighty blows, notswift, precise strikes. As Magda came up, she drove her sword straight throughhis heart.She heard men roaring in rage as they came after her. She didn’t have time tothink. She acted on instinct acquired in part from learning to use a knife tofight and in part out of the single-minded drive to kill them. She struckwithout hesitation or pause as they got close enough, using her smaller size tomove faster than they did and to stay out of the way of their reach and weapons.She didn’t try any clever moves, any fancy tricks. With every opening she saw,she simply went in for the kill.She kept moving, ducking, rolling, and twisting to avoid their blades. Not beinga soldier, she didn’t move the way they expected. There was no time for her toplan her moves. As they swung, she followed up with a strike of her own,allowing them no time for another try.She pulled back as a man’s arm shot past her, his stabbing move narrowly missingmaking contact. Still in the grip of rage, Magda whipped the sword around with ascream of power, taking off the arm he had thrust out toward her. As the manfell to the ground screaming, she let the swing of the sword follow around,bringing it up behind her to run it through a man rushing in with his swordraised to chop her from behind. As he was collapsing to the side, she yanked thesword free and brought it around in a circle, gripped the hilt in both fists,and drove it straight down into the armless man writhing on the ground. Shehammered it down so hard that the blade stuck in the ground.Before she could yank it free, another man charged her, his sword flashingthrough the night air. She knew instinctively that she wouldn’t be able to getout of the way fast enough.At the last instant, just before his blade made it to her, Merritt crashed intohim from the side, knocking him off balance. The big soldier stumbled from theimpact and fell to a knee. Before he could get up, Magda brought the sword downfrom above, splitting him all the way from the top of his head to the center ofhis chest.The man toppled, hitting the ground with a wet thwack that spilled organs outthe gaping split and across the ground.The night was suddenly still. There were no more men coming at her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 86 Magda, on her knees, sword gripped in both hands, eyes wide, ready to defendherself, gasped for breath. The night was silent. There were no men screamingbattle cries. There were no more blades coming at her.Her head swiveled, looking everywhere, scanning for threats. She was surroundedby bodies. Blood and gore and unrecognizable bits of flesh lay scattered allaround her.There were no men left standing to come at her.Not far away, Merritt, in the iron collar and hand restraints, struggled to getto his feet. Once up, he rushed to stand over her, a small, proud smile lightinghis face.With the threat ended, the Sword of Truth dropped from her hands.And then, searing torment started like a spark deep inside, quickly expandinginto an inferno of pain, burning through every part of her. Magda doubled over.She cried out as she collapsed onto her side, arms crossed over her middle,trying to quell the torture that felt like it was consuming her. She desperatelyneeded air, but try as she might, she couldn’t draw a breath. The weight ofsuffering pressing in on her wouldn’t allow it.Merritt knelt beside her, but with his wrists shackled into the device lockedaround his neck he couldn’t reach out to her. He was helpless to do anything,but it was a relief to simply not be alone with the terror of the suffering.As quickly as it came, the pain released her.As the agony lifted its grip, Magda flopped over onto her back. Tears rolleddown her cheeks as she gasped, getting her breath. She looked up at the concernon Merritt’s face.“I don’t know what’s wrong,” she finally said between panting breaths.“It’s the sword’s magic,” he said. “It extracts a price when you kill with it.The first time is by far the worst. You’re fortunate. The sword’s power wasderived from your life force, so it was already somewhat familiar with you.”Magda rolled onto her side and pushed herself up off the ground to sit back onher heels. “I’d hate to experience worse.”“Anger is a shield for the power of the sword’s magic, so that helped, too.”“Then I was well protected.” She reached out and turned his head to see thewound. “This doesn’t look so good.”“I’m all right now. I’ll be better when I get this thing off from around myneck.”“Can you use your gift to break it?”“No,” he said. “It’s shielded to prevent a gifted person from using magic toescape.”“Shielded,” she said. She remembered the shielded shackles on Naja. “I think Imight have a key that would work on it.”She retrieved the sword and worked the blade under one of the iron cuffs. Sheturned her face away. With a mighty pull the iron exploded in a shower ofpieces. Merritt held the bar to stabilize it for her to break the collar. Inshort order she had the rest of the immobilizing apparatus off him.Once he was free, she threw her arms around him. “I was so afraid. I thought youwere lost. I was so afraid that they would kill you.”He pushed her away for a moment. “‘You are surrounded. Do as I say or you willall die.’ That was your plan? Are you out of your mind?”Magda winced self-consciously. “It was the best I could come up with on thespot.” She frowned. “And it turned out to be true, didn’t it?”“It certainly did,” he said with a smile as he pulled her back to hold her tightin a grateful hug. “Thank you, Magda. I have to tell you, that was quitesomething to behold.”She felt shaky in the wake of the fear from the fight, but it felt good to havehis arms around her. “It was the sword,” she said. “Your creation ismagnificent.”“The sword is just a tool. The one wielding it has to be the right person.That’s what matters most.”She cast him a skeptical look as he stood. “If you say so.”The clouds were beginning to break up and the moon had emerged to cast lightover the landscape.“We need to get rid of these bodies,” Merritt said as he surveyed the area. “Ifthey’re found it will bring the whole army looking for who was responsible.They’ll look for the missing men soon enough as it is.”“It’s quite a drop over there,” Magda said, gesturing. “We can roll them overthe edge. No one is likely to spot them, at least not for a time. That shouldbuy us a day or two at least.”In short order, with the aid of Merritt’s gift, they had all the bodies in greentunics and their body parts moved to the side. Arms and legs flailing, the bigmen rolled and tumbled and bounced down the steep drop, vanishing into the denseunderbrush. No one would be able to see anything from the road, and unless theynoticed a lot of scavengers no one was likely to climb down looking for the men.Merritt then used his gift to eliminate any trace of blood from the fight. Withhis foot, he smoothed the gouges in the ground. In the moonlight, the road againlooked completely normal.“We have to get off the road,” he said. “There could be more of Lothain’ssoldiers about. With the moon out, we could easily be spotted out in the openlike this.”Magda looked around in the moonlight, getting her bearings. She pointed, then,to the dark wall of trees on the opposite side.“There’s a trail over there coming up the mountainside. It passes by near theroad not far off through there. It’s steeper and tougher going in places thantaking the road, but it’s also shorter. No one is likely to be traveling thetrail at night. The forest is pretty dense, so we can use the lantern in placesif we have to. If a patrol passes, they won’t be able to see us from the road.”Merritt nodded, and after a check of the surrounding area one last time to makesure they weren’t missing anything, they quickly headed off the road, throughthe dense undergrowth, and in a short while found the trail. The ground wascovered in a layer of pine needles, so it made for silent passage. With the moonout, enough light made it through the trees to the forest floor and the trail sothat they could see to make their way.“Now,” he said after they had moved deeper into the protection of the trees,“not that I’m unappreciative, but what are you doing here? I told you that youmust rest. I’m surprised that you have enough strength to stand up, and afterthat battle you’re lucky you can still breathe on your own. You’re in moretrouble than you realize, Magda. You—”“And we’re in more trouble than you realize. Lothain is being installed as FirstWizard tomorrow afternoon. He forced me to agree to marry him at the ceremony.”“What!”Magda didn’t let him launch into a rant. “Listen to me. I had no choice. He saidthat he would start killing everyone I know if I didn’t agree. He had Tilly andhad done terrible things to her just to show me that he was serious. Had I saidno he would have killed her on the spot. As it was, she was in a bad way. Shewas just the first of many he would start in on if I didn’t agree. I couldn’tallow that.”“Dear spirits,” he said under his breath.“Here,” Magda said as she pulled the baldric off over her head and handed himhis sword back. “I have a plan, though. I’ve figured it out. I know what we haveto do.”After Merritt had put the sword on, he gripped her arm. “You may have a plan,but I can clearly see in your eyes that you’re at the end of your endurance.That battle and running around out here is only making you worse. I can’t healyou further. You must rest to complete what I’ve done.”“This wasn’t my choice, Merritt,” she said impatiently.He sighed. “I suppose not. But I’d better get you back to the Keep. We can talkabout your plan after you rest.”“We don’t have time for that,” Magda insisted as she pulled her arm away fromhis grasp. “We have something much more important to do and it has to be doneright now. I know that I need rest. Do you think I don’t know how weak I am? Butwe don’t have any choice. This can’t wait.”He appraised the resolve in her eyes. “What are you talking about?”“Merritt, we’re in a lot of trouble. Lothain obviously intended to get rid ofyou so he must suspect that you’re working to find the truth of what’s going on.You were surely being taken back to be tried and executed, and you can bet thatthey would have tortured a confession out of you, first.“Lothain needs to end the doubts about himself and subvert any opposition as alast step to seize rule at the Keep. He’s consolidating his power. He was ableto dismiss Councilman Sadler so that he can more easily control the council. Healready has his own private army.“By marrying me he gains the confidence of the Home Guard and a number of keyofficials, as well as a lot of wizards who believed in Baraccus. Were I torefuse, he would then need to discredit me. He’d simply throw me in the dungeon,torture a confession out of me, and have me executed for treason. It isn’t allthat hard to get people under torture to confess.“I’m in a box. The way it is right now, no matter whether I go along with him ornot, I can’t change what is going to happen. It still all ends the same way. Myword alone against Lothain’s won’t sway enough people. He will be First Wizard.He will rule the Midlands.“By agreeing to marry him during the ceremony tomorrow when he is named FirstWizard, that at least keeps people from dying tonight. But that’s all the timeit buys. If I refuse, a lot of innocent people are going to die immediately, butI hold no illusions; once he uses me to win the popular support in the Keep andhas an iron grip on rule, he will purge the army and the officials of anyone whodoesn’t fully support him and then I will encounter an unfortunate end. I amonly an expedient means to his ends, and my value to him is very short-lived.“If we don’t do something, and do it now while I’m still useful to him, then weand a lot of our people are going to die. I now know the truth about him, buthalf the Keep doesn’t.“Many people believe that Lothain is fighting for the good of mankind byprosecuting those he says are traitors. They think he is our savior. If I tellthem otherwise, that he is often prosecuting people who can reveal his trueintent, like Naja, most people won’t believe it. They will believe the liesLothain tells them.“People aren’t going to believe me if I try to tell them what is really goingon. They believe the word of Lothain, an important man, the head prosecutor.When Lothain makes the accusation that Baraccus conspired with those in the OldWorld to defeat us, they believe him. No matter what I say, they would think Iam the real traitor for siding with Baraccus.“People need the truth. I’m the only one who can deliver truth. But I’d be deadbefore I could finish making the accusation.“The way things stand, I don’t have any way to stop him.”Merritt eyed her suspiciously. “But you said that you have a plan.”“Yes, I have a plan. It’s true that I’m so exhausted I can hardly stand. Iunderstand that. But we have only one chance. We have to take it. I came lookingfor you for a reason.”Merritt’s expression turned unreadable. “What reason?”Magda gathered her resolve.“I want you to use me to create a Confessor.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 87 Merritt tilted his head toward her as his eyes narrowed. “You want me to alteryou into a Confessor?”“Yes,” she said. “We don’t have a lot of time. We need to hurry.”Merritt walked off a distance to stand beneath one of the enormous limbsspreading from an ancient oak. With his back to her, the moon cast cold lightover his broad shoulders.Looking grim, he finally turned back.“Please don’t ask that of me, Magda.”She stepped closer under the massive limbs of the oak. “I had always thoughtthat changing a person’s nature with magic was a cold, calculating, callousthing to do for the sake of creating a weapon. I could never understand howpeople could allow wizards to alter them. I thought that it was a perversion ofour existence.“Isidore taught me that it isn’t always the case. She taught me that if it’sdone for the right reasons it can actually be a chance to make the best ofourselves. Done in the right way, it is adding to who and what we already areand what we already believe. In that way it’s not altering a person’s nature,but adding to it. Such a purpose can be the moral thing to do.“Even more, though, you’re not only a wizard. You’re Merritt. You may not seethe difference in that, but I do. Though we haven’t known each other for long,it has been long enough for me to know you, to know your heart.”“That’s reassuring to hear, but knowing me isn’t enough.”“I realize that, but I’ve thought this through. You may not believe that, but Ihave. It’s not just that this is the only way, it’s that it’s the right thing.While creating weapons out of people can be a terrible deed, done in the rightway by the right person and for the right reasons, it can be a wondrous thing.“You envisioned the idea of a Confessor for the right reasons. Life is truth.Truth is life. You wanted a way to seek truth. Such a cause, in the promotion oflife, is noble.“Killing is a terrible thing, too. I hate killing. But killing isn’t necessarilywrong.” She gestured back down the trail. “Killing those men tonight was theright thing to do, for the right reasons. It was done for good. It was done topreserve innocent life. In this instance, not killing would have been immoral.“You intend the Confessors to stop evil, just as my killing those men stoppedthem from doing evil. That makes both the right thing to do.“Merritt, I want that person, that Confessor that you create, to be me. Iunderstand the nobility of purpose in the creation of a Confessor. I knowprecisely what to do with that opportunity. Please, give me the chance to dowhat only I can do. Give me the means to help stop evil and preserve life. Don’tlet me fail to do what only I can do.“It’s my life. I want it to have this purpose.”“There’s more to it, Magda. We need time to consider all the implications.”“Ordinarily, that would be the right thing, but we have no time. It has to benow. It has to be tonight. I have to use that Confessor power to expose thetruth. I wish it could wait, but it can’t. This is our only chance.“Baraccus told me that my destiny is to find truth—”Merritt threw an arm up, gesturing angrily. “Life is not about fulfilling adestiny. Your life has no destiny but what you make of it.”“And this is what I want to make of it. Baraccus also told me to live the lifethat only I can live. He told me to have the courage to take up that calling. Hewas asking me to choose my destiny. Prophecy is not only about destiny, but thebalance—free will. Becoming a Confessor is my calling. But it’s not preordained.It’s a chance, a fork in the road of my life. I have to have the courage to takeit on of my own free will. In that way, the balance of prophecy and free will isthe magic of the future.”He looked to have calmed down considerably. “I have to admit, you have that muchof it right.”“Merritt, this is the life that only I can live. I’ve always been the persontrying to uncover the truth of things.“I found you for a reason. Destiny brought me to you so that the choice could belaid before me to make. I rejected any such choice for my life until I came toknow you and to understand the real nature of what such a choice means. I foundyou because I need to make that choice for my life. Since then I’ve come tounderstand that I need this mission for my life.“I am that person, Merritt. I’ve made the choice.“I am your Confessor.”Merritt looked down and turned away.After a moment he cleared his throat. “Magda, you don’t know all that isinvolved, all that it means. You don’t know what you’re asking.”“Then tell me, and tell me now, because we are rapidly running out of time.”He turned to look her in the eye. “This would alter the nature of who you are.The Confessor power would become part of you, much as eyesight and hearing arepart of your nature. You would be a Confessor in much the way I am a wizard.“That means that just as any child you have would carry other traits from you,such as sight and hearing, they would also carry this trait. Any child you bearwould be a Confessor. Their children would inherit the same power, and theirs,and so on. Once created, the power is part of you, it is you.”Magda paced off a short distance, chewing a thumbnail, thinking. “It would bepart of them by birth?”“Yes. You would be deciding not only for you, but for them as well. In a way,you would be creating their destiny.”She turned back. “No more than giving them the destiny of eyesight. I would begiving them a different kind of vision.”“But if—”“Merritt, if we don’t do this, I will have no chance to have any offspringbecause I will be dead. If I live, I will only be able to bring a child into atortured existence of half people crafted to fit Emperor Sulachan’s deludednotions for the world of life. I may even be changed into one of those halfpeople, giving birth to a soulless offspring. Is that better?“Don’t you see? I’m not deciding their destiny, I am giving them the possibilityof a life, a life worth living.”Merritt squeezed his temples between the thumb and fingers of one hand. “Look,Magda, even if I wanted to do this, I can’t.”Running out of patience, she folded her arms. “Why not?”He took a deep breath before explaining. “The process is similar to what we didto invest power in the sword. The difference is that the sword has no life forceof its own, so it needed to borrow a life force to help in its creation. Youprovided that with the Grace drawn in your blood.“Creating the Confessor power is similar in purpose and in many ways in themethods involved, but there is a crucial difference. You have your own lifeforce. You can’t be given someone else’s life force to turn you into a Confessorthe way we turned the sword into the key. You need to use your own.”Magda shrugged. “All right. I can draw another Grace with my own blood.”He was shaking his head. “Ordinarily that would be the first step. But you havealready given your strength to the sword. I don’t think that you understand thetrue depth of what you so willingly gave over to create the sword. Right now youdon’t have enough strength to be able to do it for yourself.”“I think I do. We can try. We have to try.”“Do you think I’m guessing about this?” Merritt stepped close and leaned towardher in an effort to make sure she grasped his point. “It’s not simply that itwouldn’t work, Magda. It’s that the attempt would kill you.”She let out a sigh. “Are you so sure, Merritt? I’m pretty strong. You just sawme fight those men.”“This is a different kind of strength.” He gestured in frustration. “You saw theforces involved when we created the sword. Don’t you recall how violent it was?Don’t you understand how close you came to dying? And you came close to dyingwhen you were well and in perfect shape.“Trying to unleash such forces on you tonight would kill you. Not maybe. Notpossibly. I’m not saying that I’m worried, or fear it might harm you. I knowwhat I’m talking about. I’m telling you without a doubt that it would kill you.You can’t hope to help us if you’re dead.”“What if we used another person to help, like I did with the sword? What if youwere the one to lend me power? Or maybe we could get Quinn. He’d help us. We cantrust him.”Merritt laid a hand on her shoulder. “Unlike the sword, the unique ability of aConfessor’s power requires that the person to become a Confessor must be the onewho provides the life force. Another person cannot be a part of that. Anotherperson cannot loan their life to you in such a way. It must be you, and youalone who gives yourself, your life force, into becoming a Confessor. Theprocess would alter you. Another person can’t do it for you.”Magda walked off a ways, clasping her hands.She felt her world, everything she cared about, slipping through her fingers.All because she was too weak.She wanted to tell Merritt that he was wrong, that she was strong enough. Butshe knew that he was right. She could hardly stand, hardly pull each breath. Sheremembered how she nearly died in the ordeal to create the sword. At the moment,she had nothing left to give of herself.Merritt was right. She wouldn’t survive the attempt.“Isn’t there another way?” she asked without turning back to him.“The wizards who wanted to create the sword died trying to do it without whatwas required. The process to create a Confessor requires a prodigious amount ofyour strength. You don’t have it to give right now. You gave that strength tothe sword. Just as those wizards died, you would die trying it without therequired strength.”“I see.”Magda felt as if her heart was breaking. She’d thought it through and had it allfigured out. She’d made the decision. It was already done as far as she’d beenconcerned. She needed only the formality of the magic to complete it.In her mind, she’d gone over what she would do once she was a Confessor. She’dgone over it at least a hundred times. She had envisioned every detail until itwas almost real.And now it was ashes.“I wish there was something I could do, Magda,” he said in quiet sorrow. “Ifthere was one person in the world I could choose to invest with the power of aConfessor, it would be you, I swear.”Magda nodded, turning away to hide her tears.“Thank you, Merritt. I know you mean that.”“I do.”Not only was her world ending, the world of life was going to end. She had losther chance. She had no way to fight Lothain and those helping him. He was toopowerful.She had given her strength over to the making of the Sword of Truth.And now they were all going to die."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 88 Magda turned back suddenly. “Merritt, when I used the sword, I felt the power ofit surging through me. It was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.”He nodded. “I know. I’m the one who created the thing, remember? It holdsimmense power, in part because of what you gave it during its creation. As longas you live, you will always share a connection with the sword. I guess youcould say that as long as it exists it carries some of you.”Magda stepped close to him. “So investing my life force into it made itscreation possible.”Merritt shrugged at the obvious connection. “That’s right.”She watched his face lit by the moonlight. “What if we used the sword, had itloan some of that power back to me, in turn giving me the strength I need to getthrough the ordeal of becoming a Confessor? It’s my life force, after all. Yousaid that it couldn’t be from someone else. Coming from the sword it wouldn’tbe.”Merritt’s gaze searched her eyes but he didn’t answer.“I’d just be borrowing some of my own life force,” she added.He had that odd frown again. “I already thought of that.”“And?”“And it’s too dangerous. Creating a Confessor is dangerous enough in and ofitself. It’s a process that has never been attempted before and very well couldbe lethal, and that’s if there weren’t any other complications involved. Tryingto do it the way you’re suggesting is theoretically possible, but it would be anorder of magnitude more perilous.”“Are you saying you don’t have the skill, or that it’s dangerous for me.”“My skill has nothing to do with it. It’s too dangerous for you for a variety—”“We don’t have a choice. We have to try.”He shook his head. “Magda, please don’t ask me to do that. You have no idea atall what you’re asking.”She leaned toward him in the moonlight. “Merritt, I know exactly what I’masking. I’m asking for a chance at life. Without trying, I’m going to die,you’re going to die, our people are going to die.“You heard Naja. Those in power in the Old World seek to end the world of life.Even if their ideas are crazy, even if their plans are completely unworkable andimpossible and they fail at accomplishing their ultimate aim, they are stillslaughtering our people just the same. They still intend to rule the world oflife one way or another. Untold thousands of innocent people will die in theirattempts, and even more will die if they succeed in winning the war. If theywin, at the very best, the people of the New World will be enslaved.“And what if they really can succeed at what Sulachan wants to accomplish? Whatif he has the boxes of Orden and he uses them to end the world of life as weknow it?“The war is going badly. I believe it’s because the Keep is infected with spiesand traitors helping the enemy. That’s what Baraccus wanted me to uncover. I nowknow who is at the center of it, anyway. It’s Lothain. He’s been hiding rightunder our noses, posing as our champion, prosecuting traitors.“But if we kill him, his secrets die with him. If we capture him instead and hegives other names under torture, how would we ever know if they are really hisaccomplices? He might hold back the names of important spies, or accuse innocentpeople. How could we be sure? With something this important, how could we besure that we have rooted out the entire nest of traitors and spies?“If we don’t get all those who are helping him they will still be able to workfrom inside the Keep to undo our cause, still activate the dead to assassinatekey people. If we kill the man at the head of it, we’ll never know who the restare until it’s too late.“But if I can get a confession out of Lothain, a true confession, and we canexpose the extent of the subversion within our ranks, then we might have real achance to counter it. We would have a chance to save the Keep.“Think of what is going to happen to us and our people if we don’t stop theenemy wizards among us. They will breach the Grace. We won’t merely die. Oursouls will be kept from crossing over into the underworld.“We’ll be like those people of Isidore’s town of Grandengart. Our bodies will beused by the wizards from the Old World while our spirits are trapped betweenworlds. Our spirits will wander, lost, in this world. How many innocent peoplewill be doomed to such a fate?“So, are you trying to tell me that you think such a grim fate would somehow bebetter than the danger of trying, even if it means I die in the attempt? How?How is that better?“Isn’t this the very purpose for which you developed the concept of a Confessor?Isn’t this the reason you believed so strongly in it that you argued before thecouncil to be allowed to create a Confessor? Wasn’t it you who said that therisks were so great that we had to try?”He stared at her from under a lowered brow without answering.“Please, Merritt, don’t condemn me to a brief life of watching all that is goodend because we lack the courage to try. Please don’t do that to me. Please don’tcondemn us and our friends and our people to the horrific fate that EmperorSulachan has chosen for us all.”His gaze finally fell away. “Magda, you don’t know what you’re asking me to do.I just can’t.”Tears trailed down her face. “Then it is you who has chosen our destiny, andthat destiny is endless suffering, all because you are afraid of harming me. Butthe safety you want for me is an illusion. In trying to protect me, you are onlybringing me to even greater harm.”Gritting her teeth, she seized his shirt in her fists. “Well I’d rather dietrying for life than endure the destiny you want to condemn me to. If you won’thelp me then at least give me the Sword of Truth so that I can kill the bastard.Give me the sword and let me die fighting for what I believe in.”His big hands closed around her wrists as he looked into her eyes for a longmoment.“All right,” he said at last. “All right, I’ll try. I’d rather die, too, thansee you have to be a helpless witness to the end of all we hold dear. I’ll try,Magda.”She threw her arms around him in gratitude.After too brief a time, he pushed away, looking into her eyes again. She hadnever seen him looking so grim.“Don’t be so eager to thank me. Doing it this way is nothing like the processwhen we created the sword. What I have to do is something very different fromwhat I would have done to create a Confessor. We can’t do it through thatprocess. You can’t really help me this time. You have to leave it to me to do.”The sobering look in his eyes gave her pause. “What do you mean? What do youhave to do?”“You have to put your trust in me. No questions. You will have to put your lifein my hands and let me do as I must.”Magda swallowed back her rising sense of alarm and nodded.“We really have no choice. We’re running out of time. Do it.”He touched her cheek. “I wish there were another way, Magda, but if we’re to dothis now, there is no other way.”With a hand on her shoulder, Merritt gently eased her back against the trunk ofthe massive oak. Dark, crooked arms of branches stretched out overhead like somegreat monster about to embrace her in its clutches. The moon cast a cold, eerielight across the angular features of Merritt’s handsome face.Magda heard a rustling sound and looked up to one of the great branches of theancient oak. There, perched in a crook on the limb, a raven ruffled itsfeathers.She looked into the raven’s black eyes as it sat quietly watching her. The lasttime she had seen a raven had been down in the maze when the dead man had beenchasing her.Merritt slowly drew the sword. The sound of the blade rang through the night,drawing her gaze back to him.Magda wet her lips. “What are you going to do?”“Use the Sword of Truth to help you be reborn a Confessor.”Magda’s concern was growing by the second. “Reborn? How? What are you going todo with it?”He almost seemed to be looking out at her from a distant world. “Do you trustme?”She wished he wouldn’t keep asking her that. “I told you that I do.”“Then please, Magda, don’t ask.”She nodded. “I’m sorry. Tell me what you need me to do.”With one hand, Merritt pressed her shoulders back against the tree. “I need youto let me do what I must.”With the sword in his other hand, he placed the tip of the blade in the centerof her chest.She could see so much more in his hazel eyes than merely the glow of his gift.His eyes were gentle, yet at the same time they were charged with fierceintensity. More than that, though, she could see wisdom, integrity, competence,and the sort of rage she’d never seen before. Some of that, she knew, was comingfrom the Sword of Truth. Some, though, was all his.She had seen the hint of that rage when she had first met him and told him thatIsidore was dead. His was a temper that had the potential to be devastatinglyviolent, and yet at the same time he was also a man able to control it and focusit.He was focusing it now.Combined with the rage from the sword, such fury was frightening to behold.Magda glanced down and saw the blade glowing white.“Merritt . . .”The blade turned from a white glow to an inky black that was like looking intothe depths of the underworld. The air around her crackled with threads of light,both the pure white light of Additive Magic, and the sinister void ofSubtractive. They wrapped her in a cocoon of magic that dimmed the world.Magda couldn’t seem to stop herself from trembling.“Merritt . . .”“Are you sure about this, Magda? Are you certain?”Behind the shadow of quiet sorrow, she could see love in his eyes.“Yes. With all my heart and soul. Who I was, who I will be, is in your hands.”“Tonight, Magda Searus, you are reborn a Confessor.” A tear ran down his cheek.“If I fail, may the good spirits take me, for I would not want to live in aworld without you.”She blinked in surprise at his words.Glowing white light and inky black darkness rolled up the length of the blade indizzying, undulating waves.“Now you must trust me,” he said with finality.Magda wet the roof of her mouth with her tongue. “I do, Merritt. I trust youwith my life.”And then, as he held her shoulders back against the tree, he pushed the swordstraight through her heart.Thunder without sound silently shook the world around her.Oak leaves and pine needles rained down in the forest all around as dust rose ina rapidly expanding ring spreading away into the night.Magda’s eyes went wide in shock at what he had just done.She let out a last scream as she died."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 89 People had gathered in great numbers. They crowded around the towering, polishedblack marble columns to each side of the gallery leading toward the councilchambers and gathered beside the statues of robed figures, leaning around thepeople in front of them, rising up on tiptoes, all trying to see.The soft rumble of their collective voices echoed from the vaulted ceiling hungwith a procession of long, red silk banners meant to represent the blood thathad been shed in defense of the people of the Midlands. The carpet, with thenames of battles woven along the edges, was also red, meant to be a reminder ofthe struggles fought and the lives laid down so that others might live.This day was no less a battle for the survival of the Midlands, a battle for thesurvival of all innocent lives in peril. Before the day was done, there was agood chance that more blood would be shed in that seemingly endless battle forsurvival.Magda wore a blank expression, showing no emotion as she strode in a measuredpace past the gathered throngs.The drone of voices and light laughter withered to whispers before fallingsilent as she passed, leaving a hush in her wake.People gawked as she marched past them, stone-faced, her eyes fixed ahead,looking neither left nor right. None of the people staring could have imaginedthe charge of power seething somewhere deep inside her.It had at first been an alien power, a terrifying monster within. At first, whenshe had again become aware after that terrible, timeless voyage throughdarkness, she hadn’t known what to expect and didn’t know what she was supposedto do. Since she was ungifted, she had never experienced any power at hercontrol, at her beck and call, much less a power like this.Somewhere, at some point, that inner force had ceased to be a stranger to her.Somewhere in the night, it had become a part of her, as if it had always beenthere and she had merely become aware of it.It was no longer an alien force within her. It now was her.She was also aware from the first that it was a power that sought release. Itrequired her to master it continually, to restrain it. Merritt had assured herthat as time went on it would become easier and feel natural, like breathing.But at that moment it had ached to be set free and she’d had to keep a tightrein on it. As he had promised, that need had eased.She had never felt such a thing before, and had no idea what to expect when sheeventually did release it. Merritt had offered some advice based on some of thecomponent elements, but to a large extent he didn’t know either.As she entered the great rotunda not far from the council chambers, Magda sawspectators crowded all through the enormous room, all hoping to get a glimpse ofthe grand event, a look at the arrival of the future wife of the future FirstWizard.Afternoon sunlight flooded in through the high windows around the lower borderof the golden dome, making the towering reddish marble pillars around the edgeof the room glow. Between the columns, against the stone wall, along with thethrongs of people, the imposing statues of past leaders watched her pass.The great mahogany doors to the council chambers stood open, flanked by rows ofthe Home Guard in spotless uniforms and polished armor, all standing atattention. Through the open door Magda could see even more people crowded intothe vast council chambers. Bluish shafts of hazy sunlight slanting into the roomgave the inner chamber a kind of reverent glow, an anticipation, to theimpending ceremony.Magda marched alone through slanting streamers of sunlight and down the runnerof blue and gold carpet leading off toward her waiting betrothed and thecouncil.With her thumb, she turned the ring Merritt had given her, feeling the raisedridges of the design, a symbol of strength and a reminder of what was at stake.The balconies below the windows were packed full with observers, all dressed intheir finery. The open floor beneath the shadow of the balconies was likewisepacked with important people as well as military men in dress uniformsaccompanied by clusters of staff, officials in dignified robes with color-codedbands to denote rank and position, wizards and sorceresses in simple robes, andaids accompanying well-dressed, important women. A beaming General Grundwallstood at the head of his officers. Commanders Rendall and Morgan were there aswell.Troops in green tunics, the soldiers under the authority of the prosecutor’soffice, stood at attention at regular intervals around the room. It was unusualthat there were no Home Guard standing guard in the council chambers, as therehad been all throughout the gallery and the great rotunda.Magda, her face expressionless, marched onward through the room, down the longblue and gold carpet and through isolated patches of sunlight. Quinn stood nearthe front of the room watching her approach. Magda spotted Naja, partly hiddenbehind Quinn, wearing a hooded cloak that did a good job of shadowing her faceand concealing her black hair. Councilman Sadler was closer to the front. Hesmiled and gave Magda a meaningful look when he saw her. Though she saw both outof the corner of her eye, she returned neither. Her face was a mask that showednothing.Emotion did not play a part in truth, only reality did.A Confessor was about truth, not emotion.In the distance, atop the dais, the council sat at the long, curved, ornatedesk. Staff and assistants sat close by. Even more people stood behind. As Magdaapproached, she could see Elder Cadell sitting in the tallest chair in thecenter, as well as the rest of the council, minus Councilman Sadler.Merritt was nowhere to be seen. Since the troops from the prosecutor’s officehad arrested him, the sight of him in the council chambers was likely to spark abattle, so he was remaining hidden. But Merritt hadn’t wanted to be too faraway.She saw the glint of steel in the deep shadows between the pillars behind thecouncil. Magda expected that it was the Sword of Truth she was seeing. At least,she hoped it was.Lothain, in his elaborate, silk brocade ceremonial robes of office, stood in thecenter of the dais where everyone could see him. The desk of the council framedhim in its half circle. His black eyes watched her approach.As Lothain stepped to the left side of the dais, several officials in gold robesintercepted Magda. She was surprised to be stopped by them. Not knowing what wasgoing on, she let them guide her to the right side of the dais, where theydirected her to turn to face Lothain. One of them whispered to her that she wasto stand there for the ceremony.This wasn’t what she had expected. She needed to be closer to Lothain. She hadexpected to be standing at his side. She needed to be close. She needed to beable to touch him.She wasn’t far. She considered trying to run at him in order to touch him, butLothain was acting unusually cautious, which was making her suspicious. He hadforced her to agree to the marriage. He was well aware that she was not happyabout it. She guessed that he might fear that she would try to assassinate himwith a knife. But she had no knife on her. There was no place for it in thedress the seamstresses had made for her overnight. Other than her power, she wasunarmed.Lothain wouldn’t know that, though. If she ran toward him, he was likely to fearan attack and use his gift to drop her halfway there. He was so close, but hewas far enough away to kill her if he wanted and she would never get her chance.Magda didn’t know what to do. If she couldn’t touch him, she couldn’t use herpower. If she couldn’t use her power, her entire plan was dead.She had the growing sense that something was very wrong.Lothain’s smirk seemed to confirm her suspicion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 90 Magda did her best to curb her anxiety and tried not to let herself bedistracted by worry that her entire plan was unraveling. She reasoned that asthe wedding ceremony began, perhaps after Lothain was installed as First Wizard,the council would have to bring the two of them together to be married. That hadalways been the procedure. She reasoned that it only made sense that he was tobe installed as First Wizard before he took his wife. She would just have to bepatient.Still, she had the sense that something wasn’t right.“Why are you in a white dress?” Lothain asked in a low voice from where he stoodwatching her from a dozen feet way. It was clear that he was not pleased but hedidn’t want the crowd to hear him. “I told you to pick any color but white.”“This is the day of my rebirth. White is perfect for the occasion.”When he glanced deliberately from her face to her chest and then back up again,he did not look pleased. She knew that he had ordered the neckline to show amplecleavage.“It looks awfully plain,” he grumbled. “And . . . modest for such a grandevent.”“Are you more interested in the dress than what is in it, then?”Lothain’s gaze drifted down the length of her again, at the way the dress wascut to fit her every curve. The sight brought his own private, unreadablethoughts behind his black eyes.The dress, made of the satiny white material she had selected, was unadorned.The women who had made it had followed Magda’s instructions perfectly in everydetail. It hugged her curves in a way that gave it a feminine elegance no amountof lace and needlework embellishment could have matched.The neckline was cut square. It complemented the cut of the dress perfectly andadded to the grace of the design. It was a dress unlike any Magda had ever seen.For that matter, it was unlike anything anyone in the room had seen, and thatwas just what Magda had wanted to accomplish. Rather than draw attention toitself in an attempt to define beauty, it instead revealed the underlying beautyof the woman wearing it.But it was meant to be more than simply an unexpected look for a dress. It wasmeant to be a lasting symbol.It was a Confessor’s dress.Lothain flashed her a sly smile before turning his attention to the crowd.“This was to be a joyous occasion,” he said in a voice loud enough to carryacross the sprawling room. The crowd quieted, looking unsure at what he meant.“I’m afraid that while I am to be installed as First Wizard, and that will goforward, there will be no wedding.”Their unspoken question answered, the crowd erupted in chatter. Much of itunhappy at the news. Magda stood as stunned as everyone else. Lothain held hishands up, calling for silence.“I’m sorry to have to inform you of this at this late moment, but I have onlyjust learned the truth a short time ago, learned that Magda Searus had ulteriormotives for agreeing to marry me. In truth, she harbored a monstrous reason.“Her deadly plan was devious in its simplicity. It turns out that she onlywanted to marry me so that she could bed me as her husband.”Lothain let the scattering of chuckles spread, only to die out when he didn’tjoin in. Magda could sense, more than she saw, soldiers closing in behind her.There was nowhere to run.“She wanted to bed me as her husband,” he said in a clear voice that everyonecould hear, an accusatory tone honed as head prosecutor, “because she planned tostab me to death in the night. She only wanted to marry me to be able to getpast those brave men who protect me, get close enough so that she couldassassinate me as I slept beside her.”He lifted an arm toward her as he gazed out over the crowd. “You see, MagdaSearus is a traitor. But she is no ordinary traitor. She is the architect of allthe strange murders that have been taking place here at the Keep.”He held up a hand, forestalling the questions. “I’ve thoroughly investigated hernefarious activities. Multiple witnesses have come forth. They testified tohaving seen her sneaking around in the night, hiding her face, meeting withmysterious people in the shadows.”Magda stared toward the man. Two of Lothain’s private guards seized her armsfrom behind, preventing her from getting closer to Lothain.“You accuse me of treason because I was seen outside at night? Where is yourproof of such a charge!” Magda called across the dais.“Proof? You would like the proof?” He cast a glance across the stunned crowdwatching rapt attention. “Yes, I think proof is in order.”He gestured off over the heads of people standing behind the council desk, andmen dragged someone forward out of the shadows. It was Tilly. The woman wascovered in filth and blood. Her bloodied face hung nearly lifeless, as did herbroken arm.“This woman,” Lothain said, “is a worker here in the Keep. Perhaps many of youhave seen her, thinking nothing of her comings and goings. It turns out that shewas a clever criminal, but we were finally able to get her to admit to her partin the crimes Lady Searus has committed against the Midlands. She long helpedBaraccus with his schemes and then later Lady Searus in her plans. She guidedLady Searus through the lower reaches of the Keep, where together they murderedour spiritist.”The crowd gasped. People had heard the terrifying stories of Isidore’s murder.Whispers broke out, swelling to fill the council chambers.Magda said nothing. She knew it was useless. No one was going to listen to her,and besides, Lothain would simply use his gift to silence her. She could releaseher power on the men holding her, but that would waste it. Merritt had warnedher that using the Confessor’s power would sap her strength and she likely wouldneed to rest for hours, possibly days, before being able to summon it again.She didn’t want to waste her one chance with her only weapon on the soldiersholding her. That would accomplish nothing. She looked to the shadows, wonderingif Merritt would do something. With all the gifted and armed men in the room, itwould be foolish to try just then, but knowing Merritt that didn’t mean that hewouldn’t.Lothain held up a hand again, calling for quiet. “This woman confessed theentire plot.” He turned to Tilly and lifted her chin. “Isn’t that right?”Tilly’s fearful eyes turned from him to Magda. Tears started coursing tracksdown through the dirt on her face.“Say what he wants you to say,” Magda told the woman in a quiet, confidentialvoice. “It is useless for you to speak the truth right now. Tell him what hewants to hear.”Tilly looked shamefaced. “But . . .”“I know what they’ve done to you,” Magda whispered, “and I don’t blame you.Don’t throw your life away for nothing of value. Tell them what they want tohear.”“The truth has value,” Tilly whispered.“It will,” Magda assured her, “but not from you, not right now. Do as I ask. Saywhat he wishes you to say.”Tilly looked out at the crowd, tears streaming down her face. “What ProsecutorLothain says be the . . .” She couldn’t say the word. “It is as he says. We bothbe traitors.”“Traitors,” Lothain added in a loud voice, “that she admitted have killed anumber of our most valuable people. There is no just verdict for such crimesexcept execution!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 91 Some in the crowd lifted fists, shouting their anger that this was the source ofthe mysterious murders, the war going so poorly, and all their other troubles,echoing the sentiment that both Tilly and Magda should be executed immediately.Others in the crowd, though, looked disheartened, distraught, and confused bywhat was happening. This was to have been the day of a joyous wedding, of theKeep coming together in unity, a reason for hope in the midst of troubled times.A few people broke out in tears. Others turned their faces away. They hadbelieved in Magda as well as Baraccus, and now that confidence was shaken oreven shattered. Magda could see in the tormented expressions that some peoplefelt that their faith had been betrayed.“Why would Lady Searus do all this?” Elder Cadell asked from behind the desk,his voice carrying out over the crowd.“You see,” Lothain explained, “her plan all along was to discredit me.” Heturned from the elder to the audience. “She knew how effective I’ve been as headprosecutor. I’ve ferreted out, prosecuted, and executed a number of her fellowconspirators. I was getting too close to the heart of the plot and she feared Iwould uncover her deadly plans. She wanted to stop me from exposing the rest ofthe traitors here at the Keep so that they could continue to sabotage ourefforts, so she made wild accusations about me, hoping not only to throw me offtrack but to damage my ability to do my duty to our people.“When so many of you good people maintained your steadfast faith in me, thatplan failed to work out as well as she had hoped. She became impatient anddecided to use her feminine wiles to worm her way into my life, taking the routeof my heart. I believed her sincerity at first, as did so many of you, but inthe end I came to see through her schemes.”Some in the crowd shouted angrily for Magda’s head.Magda maintained the mask that showed nothing.Even though the soldiers were holding her by her arms, she managed to lift herhand out enough that the crowd could see that she meant for them to see the ringshe was wearing.“The symbol on this ring is at the heart of what is happening,” she said to thepeople watching. “Lothain and those he is loyal to seek to breach this. If theysucceed, you will all die, but that will not be the end of your suffering. Ifthey breach this, your souls will never be able to join the good spirits. Theywill instead wander between worlds, forever lost.”The wave of worried murmurs started in again. She knew that none in the crowdcould see what was on the ring, but it succeeded in stirring their curiosity.Lothain couldn’t help but notice.“What is that you have, there?” he demanded.“Something you fear,” Magda said with a defiant smile.When Lothain saw the smile he stormed across the dais.“Let me see that.” He gestured to the soldiers to release her arms so that shecould show him the ring. “You heard me, let me see what it is you have there.”Magda lifted her hand to show him the ring with the Grace, but she kept it justout of his reach.“This? Merritt gave it to me.”He had given it to her when she had come back from beyond the veil. She hadtraveled the lines of the Grace and returned. She had lived what the Gracerepresented.She’d told him that she knew she was safe in his hands, that she knew he wouldprotect her. That was when he had given her the ring. He said he wanted her tohave it as a symbol of his protection.It meant more to her than anything she had ever been given.It meant everything to her.“Merritt? Merritt is a traitor and has been arrested as well,” Lothain said outtoward the crowd before turning back to Magda. “Why would he give such animportant and sacred object to you, to a nobody?”Magda arched an eyebrow. “A nobody? He gave it to me because I am a protector ofthe Grace.” She pulled her hand back out of his reach when he grabbed for itagain. “Because I am a champion of truth.”“Champion of truth? You’re a nobody!”“If I was a nobody you wouldn’t be so eager to see me dead. Just like thesepeople here, you know that I am devoted to the truth. That’s why you want toeliminate me.”“You are a nobody! Worse than a nobody, you’re a traitor devoted only tomurdering our people and you will be executed for your crimes! Now give that tome!”Lothain charged forward like an angry bull that was being repeatedly taunted. Hereached out again, snatching for her hand.Magda again pulled the hand back, drawing him onward in a rush. Then, in aninstant, she reversed her retreat and stepped into his charge.Magda planted her hand in the center of his barrel chest, becoming a wallagainst his full weight.In that instant, he had made the last mistake of his life: he had let her touchhim.Magda knew that it was not necessary for her to invoke the power within her. Itwas hers, now, always there. She had but to release her restraint of it.She felt no pressure of his advance against her hand because the world hadalready stopped in the instant that she made contact. Lothain might as well havebeen a feather coming at her.Time was hers.This was the man who, along with his fellow spies, directed the dream walkerstoward the minds they wanted to sneak into and snatch. This was the man, alongwith his fellow spies, who awakened the dead and sent them out in the night tokill people. This was the man who had sent one of the walking dead to tearIsidore apart.This was not the prosecutor who protected the people of the Midlands from thosedoing evil, this was the vicious enemy who plotted against them, who plannedtheir demise, who served evil.And now he was hers.The inner violence of her power’s cold, coiled force slipping its bonds wasbreathtaking. Unleashed, that power exploded through her, surging up from thedepths of the dark core deep within, obediently inundating every fiber of herbeing.It was a dead silent, pristine instant of the ignition of a fierce new powerunleashed into the world for the first time. Nothing would ever be the same—forLothain, or for Magda.She contained no hate, no rage, no horror, no sorrow . . . no mercy. In thatinfinitesimal spark of time, her mind was a void where there was no emotion,only the all-consuming rush of her power through the void of time suspended.He had no chance, none at all. He was hers.Time was hers.Magda could see beads of his sweat suspended in air. She could have countedevery dark hair of his stubble before he moved half the width of one of thosehairs.She could see the first hint of terror in his black eyes.She could see that, while he didn’t yet comprehend how, he was beginning torealize that he had just made the biggest mistake of his life. Even as he wantedto draw back from her touch, there was no chance. He might as well have beencarved from stone.Magda could see the gift in his eyes, too, but it would do him no good. His mindwould be gone before he had time to begin to form a thought of how to defendhimself.Like a room of thousands of mute statues, everyone watched, but Magda wasfocused on this man who had done so much harm, who intended so much more. Behindher, the soldiers were also frozen in place even as they reached for her, butthey, too, had no chance to close the distance and make it to her.Magda was in a silent world of her own.In that spark of time, her power suddenly became all.Thunder without sound jolted the air around her.The violence of it was magnificent, immaculate, glorious.As the world came crashing back, the heavy concussion raced outward in a ring,knocking the soldiers near her off their feet. People close to the dais screamedas they toppled back from the impact of the power exploding outward in anever-expanding circle.When it ended, the people who had been closest were on the floor, rollingaround, crying out in pain, clutching their aching joints. Those not quite asclose staggered back but were able to stay on their feet and weren’t in as muchpain. Those farther back fared better yet, showing little sign of being hurt.Lothain, showing no signs of pain at all, dropped to his knees before Magda,looking up with new eyes, eyes that revealed only the wish to please her.“Mistress, command me.”The two closest soldiers, still struggling to recover from the pain, managed toget to their feet. They both drew weapons as they lurched toward her.Merritt, having appeared from the shadows not far away, thrust his left arm out,palm up. At the same time as he was launching magic with his left hand, he wasdrawing his sword with his right. The bolt of power he hurled streaked acrossthe dais, the air wavering in its wake, and slammed into the two men with theforce of an avalanche. Both men disintegrated in blackened bits of flesh andbone. As they hit the floor, unrecognizable, gooey, sooty fragments spilled outfrom their uniforms and across the floor in the direction they had been running.There was nothing recognizable left. The air smelled of burned flesh and hair.It was a staggering demonstration of power that stopped a few of the men ingreen tunics in their tracks. Magda had never seen the gift used in such ashocking way. She wasn’t sure if anyone in the room had.Other soldiers, though, off to the sides and farther away, big men, angry andeager to fight, raced forward to take out the threat that had felled theirfellow soldiers. Merritt was already spinning, sword already arcing around. Whenthe blade caught the men, the air exploded with a fog of blood. Bone fragmentshit the columns with a sickening sound. Merritt was in a full rage unleashed.Battle erupted in the council chambers, with men falling to Merritt’s sword orbolts of power as fast as they went after Magda. Merritt didn’t let any of themget remotely close to her. The attempt brought a swift death.In the calm at the center of the chaos, at Magda’s feet, Lothain put his handstogether. “Please, Mistress, command me.”Magda glanced around at the battle, then back down at Lothain. “Tell your men tostop. Stand up and command them to stop.”Lothain jumped to his feet. “Stop!” he called out. “All of you who served me, Icommand you to stop!”Magda could see men of the Home Guard pouring in the doors at the rear of theroom, weapons to hand, as the men in green tunics came to a confused halt onLothain’s command.“Tell them to lay down their weapons and surrender to the Home Guard,” Magdatold Lothain.“Soldiers of the prosecutor’s office,” Lothain screamed, “lay down your weaponsand surrender!”Bewildered, many of the men looked around and cautiously began following hisorders. Others who didn’t were overpowered by the soldiers of the Home Guard anddisarmed. The few who wouldn’t listen and fought on were cut down. Soon, all ofLothain’s private army were either dead or subdued.The men in green tunics who had been holding Tilly likewise unbuckled theirweapons belts and let them drop to the floor as soldiers with swords drawnclosed in. With no one holding her up, Tilly collapsed.Magda gestured to a young sorceress she knew standing close to the front of thespectators. “Please, Davina, can you help Tilly?”The sorceress nodded, lifted her skirts, and rushed up onto the dais to see tohelping the woman.Elder Cadell shot to his feet. “What is the meaning of this outrage! Magda, whatdo you think you’re doing!”“Sit down,” she said in a deadly cold voice. “Prosecutor Lothain is about toconfess so that everyone can know the truth.”“The truth? What do you think—”“I said sit down,” she repeated through gritted teeth.When he saw the look in her eyes, he sank back down into his tall chair."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 92 “Now,” Magda said to Lothain as a winded Merritt joined her at her side, “I wantyou to tell everyone here who you are loyal to.”The crowd, never having seen the likes of such an event and not understandingwhat was really going on, inched closer. The sea of faces stretched away as faras Magda could see. Everyone tried to crowd in closer in order to hear.Lothain again fell to his knees, again clasping his hands as he gazed up at herwith wide eyes filled with the desperate need to please her.She had always thought of the prosecutor as a bull of a man, a commanding figurefeared for his dogged pursuit of his quarry as well as his intimidatingpresence. Now, he looked weak and powerless. She supposed that he was. The manthat he had been, was no more.Now, he was a man who suddenly appeared to be in great distress as he hesitated.“I’m not sure what you mean, Mistress.”Magda frowned as she looked down the length of her white dress at him. “It’s asimple question. Who are you loyal to? Answer the question.”“To you, Mistress! I am loyal to you and no other!”Magda shared a look with Merritt.“That’s not the right answer,” she whispered.“You have to be more specific,” Merritt whispered back. “He is trying to followyour instructions exactly.”Magda understood. She looked back down at the concern on the stocky face peeringup at her, waiting expectantly.“No, that’s not what I meant—”Lothain cried out in anguish at hearing that he had displeased her. He fell tothe floor, grasping the hem of her white Confessor’s dress.“I’m sorry, Mistress!” he sobbed. “Please, forgive me! I’ll tell you whateveryou want to hear!”“I want to hear the truth. I meant that I want to know where your loyalties usedto lie before you became loyal to me.”Relief washed over his creased face at understanding what she wanted, reliefthat he now knew how to please her. He sat back on his heels.“I was loyal to Emperor Sulachan, Mistress. I was a spy for him. I did hisbidding.”The crowd gasped. Some of the people were still helping those in pain on thefloor as others were pushing around them, trying to get in closer to be able tohear.“How can that be?” one of the older wizards near the front asked. “How is itpossible for our prosecutor to be loyal to Sulachan, and even if it was, whywould he admit it to you?”Magda gestured to Merritt, for the first time really noticing how much blood wasall over him. She paused momentarily to take him in, then turned to the watchingfaces.“This is Wizard Merritt. He is a maker.”That sent ripples of whispering back through the crowd. Some people, she knew,thought that makers were a myth. Other people had known that Merritt was gifted,but hadn’t known that he was a maker. A number of the gifted, though, noddedknowingly, some even with pride.“I want you all to understand what has happened, and why this traitor isconfessing. You see, with his gift as a maker, Merritt created an entirely newform of magic never conceived of before.”Excited whispering swept back through the crowd at the news. Magda waited forthe crowd to quiet down. Wanting to hear what she would say next, they quicklydid.“That magic was crafted specifically to get the truth from a person. Touched bythis power, anyone will reveal the truth, no matter what the truth may be, nomatter how guilty they have been, no matter what evil they have committed.“Once touched by this power, anyone, no matter how much they may have wished tohide it before, is changed forever and they will reveal the truth.“This is not the time to go into a detailed explanation of how it works. Thatdoesn’t matter right now. Right now, the important thing for you to understandis that this powerful magic is infallible at what it is designed to do. A persontouched by this power confesses the truth about anything they are asked. Theycannot lie.”“What kind of power were you using for this?” a wizard in plain robes standingin the front of the crowd asked. “I’ve never heard of such magic.”“In part, I used the calculations for a seventh-level breach,” Merritt explainedwith casual finality.Eyebrows around the room lifted. Wizards shared grim looks.Merritt stepped up closer beside Magda. “You’ve seen the terrible weapons thathave been created out of people, things such as the dream walkers. This one wascreated to help us. This power creates a new kind of weapon that serves thecause of truth. That’s what matters.“Lady Searus volunteered her life to the attempt. It was a perilous journey sheundertook for our sake, for the sake of being able to know truth from deceptionand lies. I guarantee you that none of you can imagine the sacrifice she made todo this, or the personal risks she took for our cause. In the end it worked, andshe has been reborn with this new power.”Merritt held a hand out in introduction. “Please meet Magda Searus, the firstConfessor.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 93 Magda could hear the word “Confessor” whispered over and over, repeatedcountless times back through the mass of people watching. Lothain, still on hisknees, continued to gaze up at her, patiently awaiting her further instructions.When Magda signaled, Quinn brought Naja forward. Naja pushed her hood back sothat Lothain could see her. Rage reddened her face. Magda could see thedangerous aura of the gift shimmering in her icy blue eyes.Naja pointed at Lothain. “This is the man who put me in the dungeon. This is theman who tortured me and—”Quinn grabbed her and pulled her back as she lunged, trying to kick him betweenhis legs. “We need him to be able to talk,” he whispered in Naja’s ear. “Magdaneeds to get all the truth out of him. Let her do it.”Naja, her breast heaving in rage, pressed her lips tightly together as shelooked into Magda’s eyes. Magda could see that the sorceress was on the edge ofunleashing enough violence to reduce Lothain to a smoldering corpse.“I know,” Magda whispered to her. “I know.”“I owe you both my life,” Naja said to Magda and Merritt. “Everyone here does.My trust is the least I can offer in return.” At last, she pulled back from thebrink and gave Magda a nod to continue.“Who is she?” Magda asked Lothain as she gestured to Naja. “Tell everyone herewho this woman is and what her duties were before coming here to the Keep. Tellus what you know about her.”Lothain looked out at the crowd watching him and answered without hesitation.“She is a defector from the Old World. She came here to help the cause of theMidlands. She was Emperor Sulachan’s spiritist. She knows about the ways of thewizards in the Old World. She knows how they have been able to use the dead toserve the ends of Emperor Sulachan. She knows how we are able to control thesouls of the dead in order to use their corpses to do our bidding. She knows,too, about the half people and how we steal their souls as well.”Cries of terror broke out as near panic washed back through the people watching.The true dimension of the threat from the Old World was sinking in. Most ofthese people had never heard of such things.“And what did you do when she defected and came here to help our cause?” Magdaasked him.“I had her chained in the dungeon and tortured.”“Why did you put her in the dungeon?” Magda asked.He leaned in eagerly at the question, happy that he was able to answer her, tobe able to please her. “To make sure that she couldn’t help the wizards andsorceresses here at the Keep who work to defend the Midlands and counter theweapons being created in the Old World. We didn’t want her to stop what we weresecretly doing with the dead, or with assassinating important people.” Tearswelled up in his eyes. “I’m sorry, Mistress. I meant you harm, too.” He fell tohis knees again, clutching at the hem of her white dress. “Please, forgive me!”“Stop that and look at me.”He immediately came to attention on his knees.Magda suddenly went cold with dread.She had forgotten to take it into consideration.She looked down at Lothain. “You know about the dream walkers?”“Yes, Mistress.”“Are there dream walkers here, now, secretly hiding in people’s minds, watchingus right now?”“Yes, Mistress.”She hadn’t considered that. She had been so worried about getting Lothain toconfess in front of everyone, so determined to expose his treason, that shehadn’t thought about dream walkers watching along with everyone else.A man, his eyes wild, his hands clawed, screamed with murderous intent as he rantoward the dais, toward Lothain.Merritt, grasping what was happening, thrust his hand out just in time, sendinga charge of power into the man flying in toward Lothain. The man shuddered whenthe power hit him and he fell dead at Magda’s feet. He had been one of theirown, not a traitor, but a dream walker had turned him into an assassin.As a couple of soldiers dragged the body away, Magda looked up at the shockedfaces. “That was a dream walker taking control of one of our people to try tokill our witness, here.”People backed away, gawking at the dead man being dragged past their feet, oneof them, used by a dream walker to become a killer. It was suddenly becoming alltoo real to people who hadn’t been willing to believe that it was possible dreamwalkers were already invading the minds of people in the Keep.Screams broke out as several wizards in the crowd suddenly covered their ears,writhing as they were stricken out of the blue with terrible agony. Some of thepeople around the victims backed away as blood began to run from the ears andnoses of wizards gasping for breath, pressing their hands to their heads, tryingto suppress the unbearable pain. They began choking on blood and coughing it outin thick gobs.Magda understood all too well what was happening. It had happened to her. Sherushed to the edge of the dais, close to the crowd.“Listen to me!” she screamed out loud enough for all to hear. “Listen to me orsome of you will die! You have to listen to me and do exactly as I say!”Pleading faces turned toward her. Others tried in vain to help the stricken.“Dream walkers are taking your minds!” Merritt yelled from beside Magda. “Theyintend to murder you! You only have one chance to live! Listen to her if youwant to live!”“Lord Rahl created magic to protect people from dream walkers,” Magda calledout. “Giving the devotion to Lord Rahl bonds you to him through links to thismagic. It will protect you from the dream walkers. You have no time to waste!Drop to your knees! Do it now!”A good many people did as she had commanded.“How can such a thing be possible?” one of the confused-looking wizards asked.“There is no way for a remote bond to accomplish something like that.”“Yes there is!” Merritt answered. “I know because I helped him create it. Justas a dream walker can function remotely, so can the bond to Lord Rahl. I knowbecause I ran the integrity check myself, from inside the verification web. Itworks. I tested it with a dream walker. Now listen to Magda and do exactly asshe says or the dream walkers will be able to steal into your minds.”“But I don’t see—”“There is no time to debate this! I’ll give you details later!” Merritt pointedat a man in front, crumpled forward on his knees, bleeding from his ears. “Ifyou want to be vulnerable to dream walkers just like that, then ignore her!”All the people still standing, including the wizard, dropped to their knees.“Everyone!” Magda shouted. “Bend forward, put your forehead to the ground, openyour mind to the words, and repeat them after me! You must do it three times!Repeat the words after me if you want to live!”The vast room reverberated with people shouting that they would do it, orcrying, or begging her to hurry.“To be protected, you must swear as follows,” Magda called out in a clear voice.“Repeat the words after me. Master Rahl guide us.” The voices echoed as thecrowd repeated them. “Master Rahl teach us,” Magda said into the tense quiet.Those stricken, bleeding, and in agony gasped the words of the devotion alongwith everyone else, as she had once done herself. “Master Rahl protect us.” Witheach phrase she called out, everyone repeated it in unison. “In your light wethrive.” She waited for the echo to die out so they wouldn’t miss her words. “Inyour mercy we are sheltered.” She paused, then went on, “In your wisdom we arehumbled.” They repeated together. “We live only to serve.” She looked out at allthe bowed heads as she spoke the last of it. “Our lives are yours.”The echo of the last words of the devotion spoken in unison finally died out.For good measure, Magda had them all repeat it two more times.When the three devotions were finished, the people stricken had collapsed inrelief. They nodded to those attending them that it had worked. The news thatdoing as Magda had said had saved the lives of those in the grip of dreamwalkers spread like wildfire through the packed rooms.“Congratulations,” Magda told the crowd, “you have taken an important step insuccessfully protecting the Keep from dream walkers. You must tell everyone whowas not here today. They must all give the devotion to Lord Rahl in order to beprotected by that bond. We cannot allow anyone unprotected to be among us.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 94 “I’m afraid,” Magda told the people who were now more than eager to hear whatelse she might reveal, “that besides the dream walkers, there are other dangersamong us here at the Keep.”She gestured to the man still on his knees before her. “Lothain, here, has longbeen a traitor acting to damage our ability to defend ourselves. He has beenworking to see to it that our countermeasures are betrayed and our weapons areineffective so that our forces will be weakened and defeated by EmperorSulachan’s invading army. His intent was to seize the rule of the Keep, here,today, by being named First Wizard so that he could hand control of the Keepover to the enemy.“We were at their mercy and they have none. Without even being aware of it, wewere on the brink of defeat, about to be slaughtered or enslaved.”She turned her attention to the former prosecutor waiting on his knees. “Isn’tthat right?”“Yes, Mistress.”“But you weren’t doing this all alone, were you?”“No, Mistress. I had help.”“So you have others, here at the Keep, working with you?” she asked. “Wizardsand others working under you to help subvert the Keep?”Lothain was nodding. “Yes, Mistress. A number of others.”In the distance, Magda could see people trying to slip out of the councilchambers. Soldiers of the Home Guard crossed their lances to bar the doors.Gifted working with the Home Guard stood, prepared to use whatever meansnecessary to prevent any resistance.“Tell us all gathered here,” Magda said, “who are these other traitors workinghere at the Keep.”Lothain began rattling off the names of wizards first. Some of them were the menwho had just been detained trying to leave.Lothain named a half dozen gifted that Magda knew worked down in the lowerreaches of the Keep, and another half dozen she didn’t know. He named other,lower-ranking people who were helping him with various tasks and murders. Henamed the captain of the prosecutor’s private guard and in a rapid ramble namedoff a good thirty names of soldiers loyal to the Old World who were helping himtake control of the Keep.Magda had to stop him and have him repeat names because in his eagerness toanswer her questions, they couldn’t easily understand him. Lothain burst intotears that he had displeased her. She ignored the tears and told him tocontinue, but to do it slower so that they could get all the names.General Grundwall stood grim-faced nearby, listening to all the names. Aidesworked feverishly to scribble down each one. Even as he was listening to thelist of names, General Grundwall was giving instructions to his officers to findand capture all the men named and put them in the dungeon. He ordered the outerportcullis closed to seal the Keep until they were all caught.“And those wizards took orders from you?” Magda asked once he finished thenames.“Yes, Mistress. I was the one commanding the efforts here.”“And those men working down in the lower part of the Keep, what were they todo?”Lothain again looked overjoyed to be able to answer her question. “Some werehelping wizards who work on defenses against Emperor Sulachan’s weapons so thatwe would know what countermeasures the people of the New World had developed.Others worked with those developing weapons for the Midlands.“When the people here went to great lengths to come up with a weapon and deployit before a battle, they won’t know that Sulachan’s forces were ready andwaiting with a trap. We also learned how you are able to defend against ourweapons so that we can circumvent those countermeasures.”“What else did your spies do here at the Keep and down in Aydindril?”“They identified targets, letting me know who the most valuable and importantpeople were. Then, I had others send the dream walkers to take them out, or elseI would have them animate the dead down in the catacombs and send them out tokill those targets in order to spread terror in the Keep.”Again the crowd gasped and whispered at all the horrific news they were hearing.A lot of these people had friends and loved ones who had been murderedmysteriously in the Keep. Now they knew not only how, but who was responsible.They wanted Lothain’s head. Some people, angry at the level of treason Lothainwas revealing, surged forward to try to get at him.Merritt quickly gestured to soldiers of the Home Guard. They understood andrushed in to hold back the angry crowd.“Are there others working with you?” Magda asked after the crowd had settleddown and was listening again. “Other officials or people higher up in the Keep?”“Yes,” he said, pointing a meaty finger back toward the council. “Guymer andWeston. When they traveled in the sliph to meet with officials in the Midlands,they would also secretly travel to places close to the Old World in order to goon to meet with Emperor Sulachan and his inner circle of wizards. There, theyreported on the progress of wizards here, handed over secret information aboutweapons as well as countermeasures, and brought back orders. The sliph neverreveals anything about people who use her, so no one ever knew that Guymer andWeston were carrying important information to the emperor’s forces.”Both councilmen, red-faced, shot to their feet.“This is the most preposterous story I’ve ever heard!” Weston shouted. “Youcan’t believe the product of such wicked magic!”“It’s all lies!” Guymer added. “You can’t believe this man’s delusions!”Magda ignored them as soldiers surrounded the pair. “Anyone else?” she askedLothain.“Of course.” He began to lift his hand to point.Elder Cadell thrust out his arms. With a thump, a tumbling ball of wizard’s fireignited and shot across the dais. The sphere of liquid flame rolled through theair as it roared toward them, expanding into a deadly inferno that hissed withmenace. The hot yellow glow of it lit the faces of the stunned people watching.The room erupted in panic."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 95 Merritt dove on Magda, driving the wind from her lungs as he knocked her out ofthe line of deadly flames flying across the dais. The wizard’s fire liteverything and everyone in the fierce glow of its orange-and-yellow flames.Quinn, Naja, and the general dove the other way just in time.The wizard’s fire hit Lothain with a sickening thump that Magda could feel deepin her chest. The liquid inferno exploded over Lothain as it hit. Blobs of thedeadly fire splattered and sailed on past him to splash down among the crowd.People everywhere screamed, some in panic, some in mortal pain.There was nothing that burned with the deadly ferocity of wizard’s fire. It hada thick consistency that stuck to victims, burning down to bone. People withbits of it on them screamed as they tried without success to extinguish thefiery blobs.Lothain briefly struggled in agony, his movements rapidly slowing to a stop, asthe inferno consumed him. The fire was so intense it hurt her eyes to look atit. His arms, like brightly glowing torches, disintegrated as the man crumpledto the floor, turning into an unrecognizable burning black mass.Out in the crowd, gifted rushed to do their best to quench the droplets of firethat had splashed out into the crowd. Others bent close, helping those injured.There were a number of victims who were beyond help. People everywhere werescreaming.“He’s a liar! This is all lies!” Elder Cadell cried out as he stood in front ofhis taller chair at the center of the council desk. “This Confessor power is acurse that brings forth nothing but terrible lies. The Council forbade Merrittfrom creating such a power because we knew it would become a tyranny of magiccontrolling us all!”Naja, her ice blue eyes as cold as anything Magda had ever seen, pointed at theelder as she addressed the crowd. “The term ‘the tyranny of magic’ is the excuseEmperor Sulachan uses to go to war. It is a cover for his true aim of disarmingall those who oppose him. He wants to eliminate magic to keep anyone fromfighting back effectively.”“She’s a liar! And so is she!” Elder Cadell screamed as he pointed at Magda.“She’s a traitor! They are both traitors! This is the tyranny of magic rightbefore our very eyes! This sham of a Confessor power is an evil contrivance ofan unscrupulous wizard meant to thwart the common good and control our lives!“Arrest her!” Elder Cadell yelled as he gestured wildly at the soldiers nearby.“Lady Searus is a traitor! Lothain proved it! She must be put to death. She mustbe—”The elder’s words were cut off when a frightening blast of power from CouncilmanSadler slammed into him. The elder staggered back a step, his hands clawing ashis flesh blackened and boiled. He only had time to let out the briefest ofcries before his shriveling flesh melted and sloughed away, leaving the top ofhis skull exposed. His eye sockets opened up as his eyes liquefied. Hisshriveled lips fell away, revealing a skeletal grin.Elder Cadell collapsed dead across the council desk, a smoking corpse.Grim-faced Councilmen Clay and Hambrook both watched as soldiers wrestled Westonand Guymer under control and dragged them away.“I’m ashamed at how easily we were deceived by Elder Cadell, Weston, andGuymer,” Councilman Hambrook said, “to say nothing of Prosecutor Lothain.”“How do we know that you two weren’t part of it?” General Grundwall asked as hesuspiciously eyed the two remaining councilmen. “Lothain is dead. He can’t tellus if you were in on it, too.”Clay gestured at Magda. “From what I know of this Confessor power from whenMerritt came before us before, there is no limit to it. She can use this powerto get Councilmen Weston and Guymer to confess all that they know, just asLothain was in the process of doing. Under the touch of a Confessor they willreveal the truth and the rest of the story. That will confirm that I wasn’t atraitor.”“Nor I,” Hambrook said.“Councilman Clay is right,” Merritt said. “We will not only be able to confirmif there are any more traitors among us, but also who is innocent.“That’s the beauty of having a Confessor working with us. She will be able toburn through the deception and lies.“As a Confessor, Magda will for the first time reveal for us the truth.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 96 Councilman Clay watched as the two treasonous councilmen were led away. “Atleast Magda can use her power on them and discover if anyone else is involved.”“We’ll have to move quickly,” General Grundwall said, “before any of them cancause trouble before they are caught.”“How did this nest of traitors come about?” Councilman Clay asked. “How werethey able to work so effectively right under our noses?”Magda stepped away from what was left of the smoldering remains of Lothain. Shehad never trusted Lothain, but she had believed in Elder Cadell. She was angrythat he had fooled her for so long, and that he had betrayed them all.“Naja was forced to help Emperor Sulachan with his twisted objectives,” Magdasaid. “I don’t think that any of us could have imagined what was going on downin the Old World while we were going about our lives. Everyone needs to know thetruth about what they have been doing.”Magda drew Naja closer. “Please explain it. Give these people a picture of thetrue horror that the enemy has in store for us. Tell them how Sulachan uses thedead, and how his wizards rip the souls from the living.”Naja looked out at the faces watching her. “If there is a tyranny of magic, itis what Emperor Sulachan and those who rule with him would impose on all ofyou.”Everyone quieted to listen to her story.“Hold on a moment,” Merritt said as he caught Magda under her arm as her kneesstarted to buckle.Magda was beginning to realize how seriously exhausted she was from using hernew Confessor power. The sword had given her the strength she had needed thenight before, but the use of her Confessor power had drained that strength.Magda gestured. “I need to sit down.”Merritt guided her around the desk. He seized the robes at Elder Cadell’s backand heaved the corpse aside. He gave quick orders. Soldiers rushed up anddragged the body away.Merritt held out the tall chair for Magda. When she sat, he stood behind her,resting a hand on the carved top of the chair.“The council has lost members. We need a council,” Magda said from behind thechair in the center of the council table. “As a start, I hereby reinstateCouncilman Sadler.”No one objected. When Magda gestured to him, Councilman Sadler smiled and took aseat to her left. Clay and Hambrook sat on her right again, at their traditionalplaces.Magda nodded for Naja to go on, then sat quietly listening to what she alreadyknew as the sorceress revealed those terrors being hatched by the rulers in theOld World.Wide-eyed people listened as Naja explained what they had never heard before,and told them what they really faced.When Naja finished her brief summation, Magda, having regained a bit ofstrength, stood.“When you hear the words ‘the tyranny of magic,’ as we heard from Elder Cadell,you will know that it is the calling card of killers. Don’t be fooled by theirplatitudes that it is for the common good. Their real purpose is to strip us ofour abilities so that they may more easily conquer and rule us.“If we are to survive, we need magic now more than ever to defend ourselves fromthose in the Old World. We need to learn, discover, create. We need to use ourreasoning minds and truth.“You have now heard the confession of the traitor Lothain and how he subvertedthe Keep. You have heard from Naja what Sulachan has planned. We now know thereal nature of the war that is upon us.“If we lose this war, we lose more than our lives, we lose more than the futurefor our people. We will lose our connection to all that is good.” Magda liftedher hand, showing them the ring with the Grace on it. “We will lose ourconnection to the very nature of creation, life, and our souls.“We did not choose this war, but if we don’t defeat Sulachan’s forces, thesethieves of souls, then we and future generations will live in a half world ofthe half people and the enslaved dead, disconnected from the Grace forever. Wewill be ruled by Sulachan, who will be nothing more than the embodiment of theKeeper of the underworld.”Her gaze carefully moved across everyone in the room. Every eye was on her.People listened in rapt attention. Every face was serious. Everyone knew thatthey were hearing the truth.“To win, we must have the truth,” Magda said. “Today, the true war for oursurvival begins. I intend to help see to it that we win this war, that ourpeople not only survive, but thrive. The Midlands is my home. I promise you allthat I will not abandon you, our cause, the Midlands, or truth.”As she looked out from her seat at the tall, center chair, the crowd erupted incheers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 97 “The first thing we need to do,” Magda said when the crowd had finally quieted,“is to seal the catacombs.”Councilman Sadler frowned. “Seal the catacombs? But wizards work down there.”“The dead also work from down there,” she said. “The dead hide in their restingplace, only to come up in the darkness and murder us. We don’t know how many ofthose dead down there have been prepared by the enemy to be able to be awakened.We don’t know how many of the dead that have been laid to rest there were reallybeing placed by spies.“We have no way of knowing which corpses might sit up and strangle us. How wouldwe find them? The wizards will have to be moved to other work areas.”“But seal the catacombs?” Councilman Hambrook sounded incredulous. “That’ssacred ground. The people of the Keep have been laying loved ones to rest therefor centuries. Visiting ancestors is a deeply valued tradition. Are you surethere isn’t another way? Maybe it isn’t necessary. Maybe our gifted could find away to reveal the dangerous bodies and remove only those so that we wouldn’thave to take such a drastic step.”Magda looked out at all the faces watching. “Do any of you feel comfortablerisking having the dead walk the halls of the Keep at night, looking for morevictims to rip limb from limb? I know that I certainly don’t.”The crowd assured her they did not like that idea one bit.She looked back at Hambrook. “I understand your concerns. But we are fightingfor the survival of the living, not the dead. They are gone. We have to let goof those who have died and move on to devote ourselves to the living.”Magda’s own words abruptly hit a painful place deep within her. She still couldnot let go of Baraccus. As much as she knew that he was gone, and as much as sherealized that she had to move on with her life, she couldn’t seem to let him go.“Magda is right,” Merritt said. “Even if we thought that we had come up with away to detect the dangerous dead from all the rest, how would we ever know forsure that we were right? A day could come when we tragically learned that we hadonly been fooling ourselves. Aren’t the living what really matter? Would any ofus want to lose the life of a loved one on such a risk? Would anyone here wantto lose a mother? A father? A child?”None in the onlookers indicated that they would.Councilman Hambrook sighed in resignation. “I have to admit, that makes sense. Iwouldn’t want to risk loved ones.”“Nor would I,” Councilman Clay added.Councilman Sadler nodded. “We have a responsibility to life. The living shouldbe our only concern.”“Then seal the catacombs,” Magda said with finality.“We will need to use magic to be sure,” Merritt cautioned. “We’ll need some ofthose keeper spells that Isidore developed. They will ensure that none of thedead can escape to hunt us.”“Please advise our wizards what they will need to do,” Councilman Sadler said.“General, please assemble a team as swiftly as possible.”General Grundwall clapped a fist to his heart in salute. “At once.”“And let it be done before Lady Searus’s nightmare comes to life,” Sadler added.“Confessor Searus,” Merritt corrected under his breath.Councilman Sadler lifted a finger and addressed the onlookers. “I meant to say,‘Confessor Searus.’”The crowd seemed to like the title."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 98 As Magda and Merritt made their way from the walkway around the inside of thegreat tower and into the stone room with the sliph’s well, Quinn heard theirfootsteps and looked back over his shoulder. Seeing who it was, he set down hispen and stood. Smiling, eager to see them, he flipped his journal closed and putit back with all the others.“Magda, how are you feeling?” he asked as he came past the sliph’s well to greetthem.She smiled. “A night’s rest did me wonders.”She glanced at the well, but the sliph didn’t emerge to take a look at thevisitors. Magda couldn’t say that she was unhappy about that. The sliph wasprobably off traveling.“How are things going?” Quinn asked.Merritt rested the palm of his left hand on the hilt of his sword. “I talked toGeneral Grundwall this morning. Overnight the Home Guard captured most of thosenamed by Lothain. They should soon have the rest in hand. Magda will have to useher Confessor power on some of the worst of them in order to get them to confessthe details we otherwise would have gotten from Lothain had he not died. Thatwill enable us to be sure we’ve rooted out all of the traitors andcollaborators.”“What about the councilmen, Weston and Guymer?” Quinn lifted a finger toward thesliph’s well. “Lothain told us that they used the sliph to travel to the Southto collaborate with Emperor Sulachan and his officers.”Quinn’s task was to guard the sliph to make sure that the enemy didn’t use herto secretly slip into the Keep to do them harm. It had been Baraccus who hadasked Quinn to take up the duty after they’d had some unfortunate penetrationsby dangerous people. Now anyone unauthorized and not a friendly force would notlive long enough to climb out of the sliph’s well after using it to try to sneakinto the Keep.In the beginning, Quinn had killed a number of the enemy gifted who had thoughtthey could slip into the Keep through the sliph. After a while, they realized itwould no longer work and such incursions ended, but Quinn or one of severalothers always stood guard over the sliph to make certain they didn’t decide totry it again, especially with a weapon created out of a person.It was a personal outrage for Quinn, who guarded the sliph to prevent the enemyfrom using her, to know that two of their own people, trusted councilmen, wereactually traitors who had used the sliph for a deadly purpose and no one knewit.Magda leveled a meaningful look at Quinn. “I am looking forward to hearing thetruthful confessions of those two. They have caused great harm. A lot ofinnocent people died because of them. I’m sure they have a lot to tell, and theyare going to tell it all.”Quinn smiled. “Having a Confessor is going to be a tremendous help in ourefforts, just as Merritt had always argued before the council. How ironic thatthe two men who so steadfastly stood against the creation of a Confessor are nowgoing to be confessing the truth about their treason because of that power.” Heturned his attention back to Merritt. “What about the dream walkers?”“The general told me that a few of the men he captured, hoping for leniency, arecooperating and have confessed to directing the dream walkers to key people. Thedream walkers had been watching what those people were working on, and inseveral cases they had exerted their control to force the sabotage of importantprojects. We’ve been systematically compromised on a massive scale. It’sfrightening to grasp the extent of it.”Merritt smiled at her. “Magda was right from the beginning about there being agreat deal wrong in the Keep. Without her determination to discover what wasbehind it all, we wouldn’t have known about it until it was too late. We all oweher our lives. All of the Midlands owes her a debt of gratitude.”“There is no doubt of that,” Quinn said, adding his smile.Magda didn’t really feel that it was necessarily her doing, so much asBaraccus’s. It was because of his death that she suspected something was wrongat the Keep in the first place. It was because of him ending his life the way hedid that she began her search for answers. She knew that he had to have had apurpose that was motivated by wanting to save the lives of the rest of hispeople.She still wasn’t entirely sure, though, what was behind him ending his life. Shewas only certain that it had been for a good reason. She still wished she knewwhat that reason was.She still couldn’t let him go.“The Home Guard has gone through the gifted and then the rest of the Keep tomake sure that everyone has given the devotion to Lord Rahl,” Merritt wastelling Quinn. “In a couple cases, we were too late. Several wizards were founddead, obviously killed by the dream walker they were unwittingly hosting. As Isaid, the extent of the infiltration is shocking. None of us realized how closewe were to losing the Keep. We were only days away from the end.“The Keep will soon be as close to completely sealed off from penetration bydream walkers as we can make it. Anyone wanting to enter will be stopped at theportcullis and not allowed in until they go to their knees and give thedevotion. Of course, while we think this will end the threat, we can’t beabsolutely certain. People entering could be deceitful about the devotion theygive. I suppose that’s why we have a Home Guard. But the dream walkers will nolonger be able to use innocent people to secretly penetrate the Keep andsabotage our efforts.”Quinn shook his head in wonder. “Frightening. At least we’ve now halted it alland we can move forward to begin to rebuild all of our efforts on a solidfooting rather than the rotted foundation created by traitors and spies.Unfortunately, in the meantime, the enemy has gotten way ahead of us.”“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Merritt agreed. “The wizards working downin the catacomb areas are being moved as we speak. Then we can go to work onsealing off the entire area. I’ve already prepared some spell-forms for them touse.”“How is Naja doing?” Magda asked.“She is already hard at work helping the gifted.” Quinn let out a troubled sigh.“After some of the things she talked about with me, they are going to have a lotof work to do. She’s incredibly intelligent, though, and she’s going to be aninvaluable help. She understands things that I don’t think one in ten of ourgifted entirely grasp.”As Quinn was talking to Magda, Merritt selected a journal from the row standingon the desk. “Do you mind?” he asked.Quinn looked back and then gestured. “No, please, go ahead. I’ve always intendedmy journals to one day be read by others. I’m hoping that it will give people inthe future an insight to these troubled, historic times, much the way I’vegotten insights and knowledge from old books I’ve read.”Merritt, already engrossed in reading through one of the journals, made a sounddeep in his throat in answer.Quinn returned to what he had been telling Magda. “As a sorceress and aspiritist, Naja has remarkable talents and abilities. She can more than fill infor the work that Isidore was doing helping the gifted. Isidore was only workingat the fringes of a lot of things, trying to understand them. Naja was at thecenter of them. In some cases, she helped originate what Isidore was onlystarting to investigate.“It’s possible that she will be able to unravel the mysteries of the spiritstrapped between worlds. She’s hoping that maybe she can find a way to guide themthrough the veil.“We’re more than fortunate that Naja came over to our side. It will accelerateour understanding of how to catch up with what those in the Old World are doingto defend against us, and losing her specialized assistance will be a blow tothe efforts of Sulachan’s gifted.” Quinn lifted his brow as he tilted his headtoward her. “But more than that, I would hate to have to fight against thatwoman. Having grown up in such a strange and exotic place, she is, well, she isunlike anyone I’ve ever met.”“I know what you mean,” Magda said. “From the first moment I saw her, I knewthis is not a woman to underestimate.” Magda glanced toward the sliph. “Have youheard from Lord Rahl, yet?”“A couple days back, when we thought Lothain was going to be named First Wizard,I sent an urgent message to him through a journey book.” Quinn gestured to thewell. “He should be on his way.”“Quinn,” Magda said, gathering her thoughts to move on to their reason forcoming down to the sliph’s room in the first place, “Merritt and I need to tellyou about some important matters.”“Very important,” Merritt said, lowering the journal he was reading. “But thethings we have to tell you about must be held in strictest confidence. Once wetell you, only the three of us will know about it, and it has to stay that way.Forever.”“Of course,” Quinn said as he nodded with an earnest, if worried, look. “Youboth know that you can trust me. What is it? Has something else happened?”“Yes,” Merritt said on his way back from the table, “and we need your help.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 99 “My help?” Quinn shrugged. “Of course. What is it? What’s happened?”“We need you to know that I completed the key,” Merritt told him.Quinn blinked. “What?”“The magic used to complete the key has a great deal in common with the magic Iused to create the Confessor power.”“But you always told me that you had to have the seventh-level-breachcalculations to complete the key.”“Baraccus left the formulas for Merritt to find,” Magda told him. “With thecalculations he needed, Merritt was able to complete the key.”Quinn stared at her. “The key to the power of Or— Or—” he stammered.“Orden,” Merritt finished.Quinn squinted at him. “You completed the key? It’s done?”Looking him in the eye, Merritt lifted the sword a few inches and let it dropback into its scabbard.Quinn wiped a hand across his face as he sighed. “The teams will be relieved.”“You can’t tell them,” Magda said. “You can’t tell another soul. You can’t tellanyone.”“What?” Quinn was clearly perplexed. “Why not?”Magda gripped his arm. “Quinn, listen to me. There’s more to it. There arecomplications. What we have to tell you requires the utmost secrecy.”“All right.” He took a breath to compose himself. “What else?”“When Baraccus came back from the Temple of the Winds, he told me that the boxesof Orden were gone. Someone took them.”Quinn’s eyes widened as his face went white. “Dear spirits. Do you have any ideawhat—”“I know about the power they contain,” she said. “Baraccus didn’t tell anyonebut me for a reason. I’ve only told Merritt and now you know. No one else canknow about this.”“This is important, Quinn,” Merritt added in a grave tone, holding the journalclosed with a finger marking his place. “We don’t know who stole the boxes ofOrden. We don’t believe that Baraccus did either. He was obviously very worriedabout the boxes being gone. We think that’s why he brought the rift calculationsback. He hid the formulas. We think he wanted me to find them and complete thekey.”“Why would he hide them? The key is the safeguard for the power. The key may bethe only thing that could control a release. Why wouldn’t he want the teamstrying to create the key to have the necessary formulas?”“Think about it,” Magda said. “Think of how the Keep has been compromised bytraitors, spies, and dream walkers. If anyone had access to the formulasnecessary to complete the key, then whoever has the boxes would be able to gethold of those formulas and complete the key themselves and unlock the power.”Quinn gazed off in thought. “That’s true . . .”“When Baraccus brought those valuable seventh-level-breach formulas back,”Merritt said, “he knew how important they were. He hid the calculations so theywouldn’t fall into the wrong hands.”“Where were they hidden? How did you discover them?”“He wrote down the calculations in his notebooks that he left on his workbench.Right there in plain sight the whole time. People who saw those books didn’teven know what was in them, because they were not the right people. When Magdagave me his tools, I discovered the formulas in his notebooks.“He didn’t tell anyone but Magda about the boxes being gone. I think he left atrail that took her to me. I think he wanted me to find the rift calculationsbecause he knew that I was working on the sword alone. I was the right person.He didn’t want anyone else to know about the existence of the formulas to keepwhoever has the boxes from making a key.“That completed key is now the most important object in the world, other thanthe boxes themselves, because the key can access the power. If whoever has theboxes knew that the key is complete, they would come after it, so we can’t let aword of this get out.”“Of course,” Quinn said, waving a hand as if to dismiss any concern that hefailed to grasp the gravity of the situation. “No one even knows the truepurpose of the power of Orden. We know some of its potential, some of itsdangers, but we don’t even know for sure its original purpose. Not much is knownabout the time before the star shift.“But one thing is certain. If Emperor Sulachan is the one who managed to obtainthe boxes of Orden, he would do anything to get his hands on the key.”“Exactly,” Merritt said. “That’s why we need to hide it.”“Hide it?” Quinn shook a finger at the sword on Merritt’s hip. “Bags, Merritt!You’re wearing the thing in plain sight!”Merritt leaned closer and lowered his voice. “Sometimes, the best way to hidesomething important is to hide it in plain sight. Baraccus wanted to show usthat with how he hid the formulas.”Quinn threw his hands up in frustration. “But there are lots of people who haveworked on creating the key out of a sword. A sword is the first thing someonesearching for the key would suspect, the first thing they would look for.”“Not necessarily,” Magda said.Quinn’s gaze shifted between the two of them. “I’m listening.”“They only think the key needs to be a sword because that was the theory gleanedfrom ancient books. I’m the one who came up with it, remember? I’m the one whotold people it needed to be a sword.”“Well there you go. That’s what I mean. Everyone believes it has to be a sword.”“That’s why we need you to create a more inviting belief,” Merritt said,“something more convincing, something that will cause people to shift theirthinking to a better theory of what the key would have to be.”“A better theory?” Quinn looked intrigued. “You mean send them off track so thatthey aren’t looking for a sword?”“Exactly,” Merritt said. “The boxes of Orden were stolen from the safest placeanyone could think of to put them. So why were they vulnerable?”“Because people knew where they were,” Quinn answered. “If you know wheresomething is, you can work on how to steal it no matter how difficult it may beto get to.”“You’re getting the idea,” Magda said. “What makes the key, in the form of thesword, vulnerable, is that if people know it exists they will look for it.That’s why secrecy is so critical. People won’t look for something if they don’tknow it exists.”“So in place of the sword,” Merritt told him, “we have to give people somethingelse more inviting to look for.”Quinn lifted a finger. “A diversion.”Merritt smiled in answer. “It needs to be something they will come to believe isthe key to the boxes of Orden. Then we’ll hide it—to make it look all the moreimportant—when in actuality it will be carefully planted, not hidden. Hiding itmakes it all the more enticing. If people are all looking for the diversion,they won’t be looking for the real key.”“In the meantime,” Magda told him, “we’ll have the real key.”Merritt smiled. “Magda named it the Sword of Truth, so that’s what it will be—atool, a weapon, in its own right, as its own end. It has powerful magic designedaround truth in order to protect the power of Orden, not just unlock it, so itwill have a purpose—seeking truth—that will give it a purpose, a life of itsown, a reason to explain its existence.“Since it is the Sword of Truth—a weapon created to fight for truth—people won’thave reason to expect that it could also actually be the key to the power ofOrden.”Quinn slapped his forehead. “I never knew that my two old friends were thisdevious.”Merritt smiled with one side of his mouth. “In the meantime, with the sword atmy side, I’ll search for the boxes of Orden. If I can find them, we’ll protectthem. With no one knowing about the existence of the true key hiding in plainsight, then hopefully the rumors of our diversion key will entice whoever hasthe boxes to look for that fake key instead of trying to use the power withoutit.“We have to understand, though, that the power of Orden has existed for longerthan any of us knows. It’s ancient. We have to realize that this search, thisstruggle to protect such an ancient power, may be a struggle and a search thatis part of mankind itself, and very well may stretch beyond our lives. It may goon for centuries, or even for thousands of years. This is something moreimportant than the three of us. It is our struggle right now, but we have tokeep in mind that we may in the end be passing this struggle on to futuregenerations.“If we never find the boxes, then in the future, as the Sword of Truth is passedon to the right sort of person who can protect it, that person will have his ownmission—seeking truth. In that way, the true power, the true purpose of thesword as the key, will be hidden in plain sight until the right personeventually comes along.”Quinn stared at Merritt. “This is a heavy responsibility we’re taking on.”“It is,” Merritt agreed.Quinn put his fingers to his forehead as he paced around the room, thinking itthrough. He came back to stand before Magda and Merritt.“So you two want me to create a fake key of some sort?”“Yes, as a diversion for the real key,” Magda said. “Then we’ll hide it. If it’shidden well enough, but we leave hints to its location, then people will come tobelieve that your fake key has to be the true key.”“This is getting awfully complicated,” Quinn said as he dry-washed his hands.“We have to get a long list of things right for all this to work.”“That’s why we came to you,” Magda said. “You’re the only one who could pull itoff.”Merritt regarded him with a sobering look. “Quinn, you know how dangerous thepower of Orden is. Used in the wrong way, it very well could breach the veil anddestroy the world of life. We have to do everything in our power to see to itthat such a thing never comes to pass.”Deep in thought, Quinn flicked a hand. “Yes, of course you’re right. How will wehint at this diversion key?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 100 Merritt waggled the journal. “We’ll hint at it in books of magic, information,records, and history. That’s how I came to the belief that the key had to be asword. You’re always recording history of the Keep. You need to create a falsehistory, for the false key. Create a better idea of what the key should be, onethat makes more sense to people, so that they believe in the diversion wecreate.”Quinn nodded thoughtfully. “Wizard’s First Rule.”“Right,” Merritt said. “Emperor Sulachan has been able to amass informationbecause he is a student of history. He gleans all he can from records andaccounts. According to Naja, that’s part of the way he uses dream walkers.“So, in order to help hide the real key, we need to make some parts of historymore muddled. We need to obscure what I learned about the key needing to be asword. We don’t want it to be easy for Sulachan, or anyone who might get theirhands on the boxes, to be able to so easily learn the truth through history.“If people see the muddled history you create, they will repeat it. Thoseaccounts you create will take on a life of their own. They will become theconventional wisdom. As they do, the truth will be blurred, at least until wefind the boxes or, if not us, then the right person eventually comes along.“So, while you’re down here with the sliph, writing your journals and historiesof the Keep, don’t make clear what is happening now. Don’t make it easy tounderstand what has taken place here in the Keep, or to grasp what we know, whatwe have discovered, and how we solved the plots against us. Don’t let peopleknow how Magda uncovered Lothain’s plots, or how we unmasked the traitors andcollaborators and spies. Don’t let the enemy know how we did what we did. Mix itup.”“Of course. Disinformation,” Quinn said. “I can do that. I’ll leave out criticalevents, then I’ll put in false information and twist everything that hashappened around into a kind of vague, shadowy history that obscures what reallytook place.”“Good,” Merritt said with a firm nod.Quinn snapped his fingers. “And what if I made the diversion for the key, be abook?”“A book . . .” Merritt gazed off as he considered it.“Yes, kind of like the books with the complex rift formulas that Baraccusbrought back from the Temple of the Winds.”“That would be fitting,” Magda said.Quinn shook a finger as he thought. “I could even use some calculations from therift formulas to give it legitimacy. Not enough to make it function properly, ofcourse, but enough star azimuth angles and such to make it appear legitimate. Ifit was complex enough, and if some of the magic in it actually functioned, thatwould make the false key look real.”“What kind of book would it be?” Magda asked.Quinn leaned in. “A book of instructions. After all, isn’t that what peopleexpect? They will want to know how to use the power of Orden. An instructionbook meets their expectations.”“The power of Orden predates the star shift,” Merritt said. “Information aboutit is sketchy, at best.”“Exactly,” Quinn said. “So they will want to know how it works. They start outinvested in wanting a book of magic that will tell them how the power works. Sowhy not give them one?”“Create a fake instruction book as the key to the power?” Magda asked.“Yes. It would be a book on how to use the boxes of Orden, full of legitimateformulas that predate the star shift to add legitimacy, but altered just enoughso that they wouldn’t be of any value as a real key. Who would know they’refalse? There would be no way to check them, nothing to check them against.”Magda was intrigued. “And you think that you could create a book that wouldappear real enough that people, even if they found it and looked at it, wouldbelieve it was real?”“The power of Orden is ancient,” Quinn said. “How would they confirm anything init? I can make it look real and fabricate a verification process within the bookitself, but this book would actually be nothing but shadows. Along with themuddled history I create, that would further add to the sense of authority ofthis shadowy book.”“You could even call it that,” Merritt said. “Name it Shadows, or something.”“That’s too simple,” Magda said. “Sounds like my cat’s name. It would workbetter as a diversion if it sounded like it functioned as a key. Like itcontained methods for unlocking answers. It needs a more mysterious title.”Quinn frowned. “Like what?”Magda thought a moment. It came to her, then.“How about The Book of Counted Shadows.”Quinn’s brow lifted in delight. “I like it.”“It’s brilliant,” Merritt said, grinning at her.Seeing him smile at her like that lifted her heart. But the shadow over herheart dimmed her bright, momentary pleasure.“I’ll get started on it right away,” Quinn said. “I’ll also create somehistorical sources to make it look like the key to the boxes can be found in TheBook of Counted Shadows. I can even come up with some fragments of text and makethem look like they survived from before the star shift as well.“If we let some of these accounts slip into the wrong hands and they get back toEmperor Sulachan, he will be sent off chasing shadows, so to speak.”Merritt pinched his lower lip in thought. “You could create some fake documentsabout recent events, with tantalizing bits of ancient knowledge talking aboutthe key to the power of Orden, hinting at the book as the key, and then we couldplant this documentation on a dead man dressed as a courier.” Merritt leanedclose. “Then we could leave the body where General Kuno’s patrols would findit.”“And if we hide The Book of Counted Shadows,” Quinn added, “it will convince theemperor that he is on the right track. The harder it is to find, the more theywill all be convinced that the book is the key.”“Meanwhile,” Merritt said, lifting the Sword of Truth partway from its scabbard,“no one will ever suspect the true key.”“It all should work,” Quinn said. “After all, no one knows much of anythingabout the power of Orden’s origin. I’ll obscure what’s known about the starshift to better hide what is known. I won’t have to worry about altering a lotof material, or contradicting a great deal of evidence of actual history, so itshould be easier to create a credible diversion out of history.”“And look here.” Merritt opened the journal he had in his hand and tapped aplace on the page. “You wrote in your journal, ‘The third attempt at forging thekey failed today. The wives and children of the five men who died roam thehalls, wailing in inconsolable anguish. How many men will die before we succeed,or until we abandon the attempt as impossible? The goal may be worthy, but theprice is becoming terrible to bear.’”“I see what you mean. That’s the kind of thing that’s too obvious in pointingpeople to the sword as the key. I know,” Quinn said as he swiped a finger acrossthe first words, making them disappear, “I’ll change this part so that it says,‘The third attempt at forging a Sword of Truth failed today.’ How’s that sound?That way it disassociates the key from the sword and makes the sword look like aspecial object of its own.”Merritt smiled. “Perfect. That adds credibility to the sword being somethingother than the key.”“I’ll add some real magic to the book,” Quinn said, “so that it seems even morereal. Some occult spells and spell-forms will make for a sinister book.”“You are a devious man, Quinn,” Magda said with a grin.Quinn arched an eyebrow. “If you think so now, wait until you see The Book ofCounted Shadows.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 101 Magda rushed into the sliph’s room. Merritt followed close behind her.Lord Rahl, leaning back against the low wall of the well, looked up when heheard them come through the doorway, and swept his long blond hair back off hisface. He looked rather disoriented and euphoric after his journey in the sliph.It had that effect on a lot of people. Magda had to admit that it had had thesame effect on her. Despite that, she still didn’t like the sliph.“I came as fast as I could.” Lord Rahl gestured to Quinn. “Quinn filled me in oneverything. Sounds like quite an eventful ordeal.” He grinned at Magda.“Confessor, eh? Seems to fit.” His gaze traveled the length of her white dressand back up again. “I must say, so does that dress. Quite well, in fact.”“Thank you,” she said, not knowing exactly what to say.“When I first got the message, I was pretty worried that for some crazy reasonyou were actually going to marry that pig of a prosecutor. I should have knownbetter. Good job, Magda. Good job. You indeed did have a reason to stay at theKeep, as you told me the last time I saw you.”Merritt nodded his agreement. “Even though Magda uncovered the plot and broughtLothain’s treason to light, I’m afraid that we still have a lot of work to do,and a difficult war ahead of us. Did Quinn tell you about the half people aswell?”Alric Rahl sighed as he nodded. “And these walking dead people things.”“We wanted you to know what your soldiers were facing,” Merritt said. “They’regoing to be hard to fight. I haven’t worked out a method, yet, to keep them awayfrom us. I would suggest that you do something about any places the dead areburied, like the catacombs.”“I always worried about men with a weapon in their hand, or a gifted conjuringmagic. I never thought I’d have to worry about the dead people.”“I can assure you, it’s not a thought I like either,” Quinn said from hiswriting desk.A thought tickled at the back of Magda’s mind, but she couldn’t quite bring itforward.“Say,” Lord Rahl said, stretching his neck to look out the door to make sure noone was near. “I have to bring up something rather important. But it has to bekept a secret among just us in this room.”It seemed to Magda like a day of secrets. “What is it?”Lord Rahl scratched his jaw as he searched for words. “We found something,something quite important.”“You ‘found’ it?” Merritt asked suspiciously. “Where did you ‘find’ thisimportant something?”Lord Rahl heaved a sigh. “It was on a man we killed. Well, actually, we killed awhole bunch of men until we finally killed this particular one. By how well hewas being protected, we knew that he had to be an important person, or havesomething mighty important on him. It turned out to be the latter.”“So, what was it?” Magda asked.Lord Rahl put his hands on the short stone wall of the sliph’s well and leanedback to look up at them with blue eyes.“It was covered in jewels.”Merritt was still looking suspicious. “You’re telling us that you foundimportant treasure?”“You might say so. These jewels were covering a box.” He gave them each ameaningful look.“A box,” Merritt repeated carefully. “What sort of box?”Alric Rahl arched an eyebrow as he folded his arms. “A box as black as theKeeper’s heart, and containing great power, if you catch my drift.”Magda glanced at Merritt before looking back at Lord Rahl. “And what makes youthink that this box contains great power? Did you try to open it?”He frowned indignantly. “Do you take me for a fool?”“No,” Magda said. “But you said that it contained great power. What do you knowabout this box?”He shot her a look. “Are you forgetting that Baraccus and I were good friends?He told me about how the power of Orden was contained in three inky black boxescovered in jewels. The thing is, he said that the boxes had been sent away tothe Temple of the Winds.” He looked from Magda to Merritt and back again. “So ifthey’re in the Temple of the Winds, what is one of them doing in this world inthe possession of a dead man?”“We’d better tell him,” Merritt whispered to her.Magda nodded as she let out a long sigh. “The boxes were stolen from the Templeof the Winds.”“Obviously. But who took them?”Merritt shrugged. “I’d say Sulachan’s people if I had to venture a guess.”“What about the other two?” Magda asked.Lord Rahl, arms still folded, sighed unhappily. “Don’t know. I only have theone. And you would have a hard time believing how many men we had to kill to getthis one.”“I can only imagine,” Merritt said. “But if it was Sulachan who had it, you hadbetter believe that a lot more men than that are going to come to get it back.”“No doubt,” Lord Rahl said.“We have to hide it,” Magda said to Merritt. “Trying to protect it is too risky.It must be hidden.”“That sounds well and good, but where?” Merritt asked. “I don’t know a placesafe enough that Emperor Sulachan couldn’t get to it. After all, it washidden—in the Temple of the Winds in the underworld—and he managed to get toit.”“Well,” she said, “if he didn’t know where to look he—”Magda went silent as the thought tickling at the back of her mind suddenlybecame clear. She blinked. She wondered if it could work. She wondered if it waseven possible.She seized Merritt’s shirtsleeve. “A gravity spell?”Lord Rahl’s face scrunched up into a frown. “A what?”“A gravity spell,” Merritt said, ignoring Lord Rahl, his attention focused onMagda because he realized from the look in her eyes that she was on to somethingimportant. “What about a gravity spell?”“That little gravity spell you created and gave to me draws those little clayfigures to it.”“Right,” he said in a drawl as it started to dawn on him.“What if you created a bigger gravity spell that would draw the dead thatSulachan’s forces have animated, and draw the half people to it as well? Najahelped create them. She knows how they function and how their spirits have beenmanipulated, so maybe she could give you information on the spells involved andthen you could create a gravity spell specifically designed to draw them bothin, right?”“For someone born without the gift,” Merritt said with a smile, “you sure havesome pretty interesting ideas of how to use it. You make a pretty good maker’smatch.”Lord Rahl was looking from one face to the other and back again. “Draw them intowhere?”Merritt ran his hand back over his neck. “That’s the problem. It needs to besomeplace where we could trap them. Once we draw them in, we would also have tokeep them there.”Magda snapped her fingers. “Isidore’s symbols.”Merritt was already nodding. “We could use Isidore’s keeper spells to make abarrier to help prevent them from escaping.”Lord Rahl still had the serious scowl. “You mean that you think you could createa spell that would draw Sulachan’s walking dead people and his half-dead peopleto it?” When Merritt smiled and nodded, Alric Rahl went on. “And then you wouldplace a barrier spell to ensure that they were trapped?”“That’s exactly right,” Merritt said. “If we could draw them in and trap them,then our forces wouldn’t ever have to fight them. I was racking my brain tryingto think of weapons and ways for us to fight these things, but if we trappedthem somewhere instead, we wouldn’t ever need to fight them. If we never had tofight an army of the dead and half dead, it could save the lives of untoldnumbers of our soldiers, to say nothing of the innocent people in placesSulachan invades.”“All we need is a place to put them,” Magda said. “It has to be someplace remotethat would provide physical barriers as well as the barrier spells, just to besure. Maybe a blind canyon or something like that.”Lord Rahl’s scowl was gone. His arms came unfolded as he stood. He lookedsuddenly intent and serious.“The Dark Lands.”“The Dark Lands?” Merritt asked. “What are the Dark Lands?”“A remote and inhospitable area in D’Hara. There is a place there, to the northin the Dark Lands, surrounded by mountains. There is only one way in and out.All around are impassable mountains. If you could draw them in with this spellof yours, you might be able to trap them in there. No one goes to that remotearea in the Dark Lands. It’s a dangerous place. Everyone already considers itdemon ground.”“That’s perfect,” Magda said. She turned to Merritt. “As soon as you can come upwith a gravity spell that works on Sulachan’s dead and his half people, we cango there, set the spell, and draw them in.”“The barrier spells that I could make from what Isidore came up with wouldn’tweaken for thousands of years.“And,” Merritt added with a smile as he leaned toward her with a sparkle in hiseyes, “we could leave the box of Orden there as well. Then it, too, would betrapped there. After all, who is going to go on demon ground filled with thewalking dead and with half people who want to rip you open and eat you alive?”Magda put a hand to her chest and heaved a big sigh of relief. “We’ve justsolved two problems with the same solution. As soon as you can create thespells, we can travel to the Dark Lands and set the trap.”“We?” He shook his head. “You’re not going. The thing about a gravity spell isthat it’s distance-sensitive. If you were to take those little clay figures Igave you some distance away from the gravity spell, it wouldn’t have enoughpower to draw them to it.“So, I’m going to have to create this spell and then travel near the enemyforces so it has enough power to draw the dead out. When I get them all comingafter me, I’ll be able to lead them to the Dark Lands and into this remoteplace. I’ll set the spell and as soon as they’re all drawn in, I’ll place thebarrier spell to keep them in. Having them follow me in isn’t what I wouldprefer, but it’s the only way.“It’s too dangerous for you to come with me.”“Too dangerous?” Magda planted her fists on her hips. “Who is it that saved yourhide by cutting down all those soldiers and setting you free?”Lord Rahl lifted a hand. “Ah, is this a story I ought to know about? You cuttingmen down? What are you talking about?”Merritt waved a hand irritably. “She had the sword.”“Ah, she had a sword. That explains it.”“Just because she killed a wizard and eight or ten of Lothain’s soldiers all byherself, now she thinks she’s qualified for such a fight.”Lord Rahl clasped his hands as he arched an eyebrow. “Sounds to me like maybeshe is.”Merritt’s mouth twisted, and then he gave in to a smile. “I suppose it does. Itwill take a little while to create the spells, but once they’re ready, we canset the trap.”He smiled at Magda in a special, very private way. It made her grin. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 102 “I’ve found him,” Naja said. Her voice sounded like it was coming from thatfar-distant world. She squeezed Magda’s hand. “I’ve found him.”Magda swallowed. “Are you sure it’s him?”Naja, her eyes closed, slowly nodded. “I’ve found him. It’s beautiful. Hisspirit is beautiful. I knew it would be.”A tear rolled down Magda’s cheek. “Can we . . . talk to him?”Naja’s smooth brow twitched slightly. “In a way. Like I told you before, if hepermits it, in a way.”They were alone, the two of them. And yet, in a manner of speaking, they wereamong a whole underworld of spirits.The room was dark except near them where it was lit by a dozen candles set allaround them on the floor. It was the dead of the night and dead quiet. There wasno light to leak in around the shutters. Magda and Naja were alone in thestorage room of the First Wizard’s apartment. It seemed the fitting placebecause Baraccus had spent so much time at his workbench there.Both Naja and Magda sat cross-legged on a plush, round carpet set beforeBaraccus’s workbench lined with candles. Beyond the candlelight, the rest of theroom might as well have been the void of the underworld itself.Magda wondered briefly if perhaps it was.She hadn’t told Merritt what she was going to try to do. She didn’t know what hewould think of the idea. She supposed that he would support whatever she wantedto do, but she didn’t want to worry him. He was always incredibly respectful ofBaraccus as her husband, and Magda’s feelings about him.But Baraccus was gone.Magda was alone, now. She had people who cared about her, but she felt alonewithout Baraccus. It was a terrible feeling to miss him, and at the same timerealize that he was gone and that he never could be in her life again. Shedidn’t know how to find peace.She thought that maybe if she knew why he had killed himself, that would help.Merritt understood. As much as it stood unspoken between them, he understood.She wasn’t sure that she did. Merritt, though, gave her respectful distancebecause of Baraccus.In a way, she wished he wouldn’t. But she didn’t know how to get beyond what waslost.It wasn’t fair to Merritt, of course, but she couldn’t help herself. Shecouldn’t help her feelings.She felt like one of the spirits of the half people, lost between worlds, notknowing where she belonged.Naja had understood. She’d said that it was a common problem. Letting go, she’dsaid, was often hard. She said that people came to her because they haddifficulty letting go. Naja seemed to understand Magda’s conflicting emotionsbetter than Magda did, and offered to help with a spirit reading so that herheart could find peace.Shadow meowed softly as she materialized out of the darkness to rub againstNaja’s side. After letting her tail drag across the spirit woman, the catcarefully stepped into Magda’s lap and curled up in a ball, where she promptlystarted her soft, steady purring.The black cat seemed at peace among spirits.“Can you ask him if he is at peace?”Eyes still closed, Naja smiled. “I don’t need to ask him that. I can feel thathe is.”“He is? How is that possible? I mean, he’s gone, he’s alone . . . he’s withoutme . . .”“It’s not that way for the spirits,” Naja said. “The concerns of our world, theconcerns of our hearts, are not the same as the concerns of the underworld.”“Can I talk to him?”“As I told you before, in a way, and through me, if he will allow it. Ask.”Magda swallowed. “Baraccus, I miss you so much.”“He knows, Magda. He knows.”Magda felt funny trying to talk about such deep, personal feelings throughsomeone other than Baraccus. She knew that she had to try, though, if she wantedto ask him why he would have killed himself. This was her one chance.“But . . . even though I miss you, it’s not the same anymore. You aren’t here,alive, so I can’t hold on to you in the way I want to.”“He knows that, too, Magda,” Naja said in her gentle, soft voice.“But I—”“I know your heart Magda,” Naja said in a suddenly strange, distant voice.Magda looked, trying to see, but it seemed to have grown too dark to see thespiritist’s lips moving. Shadows seemed to move in the blackness around them.“I know your loyalty to me,” the strange voice said. “But who I was, who youloved, no longer exists. I have passed on. In your world, only my memory canexist. Your loyalty to me because of that memory is a part of life, but it canbecome disloyalty to yourself if you hold it so closely that it crowds out therest of life.”“Why did you leave me,” she asked in a halting voice as a tear rolled down hercheek. “I thought you loved me more than anything. Why would you leave me allalone?”The candles hissed for a time as she waited, not knowing if he would answer.Finally, the strange voice returned.“I had to do as I did because I love the world of life.”Magda sucked back a sob. “Please, Baraccus, I don’t understand.”“There are others who can do what I could do. There are others who can fight inthe ways that I could fight. There are others who can serve our cause as Iserved it. In that way, as remarkable as you may have believed me to be, Iwasn’t. I was not essential.“But you are unique, my rare flower. There has never been anyone exactly likeyou before, and there can never be anyone exactly like you again. We are eachthat way. Because of the exact way you are, there are no others who could havedone the things you have done, when you did them, in the way you did them. Thereare no others who have had the particular experiences you’ve had that led you tothe choices you made. What you did, and what you have become, no other couldhave done in your place.“You were, and you continue to be, on a unique path.“There were so many paths that would have taken the world into eternal darkness,but there was only one to take it safely through this perilous time. You tookthe world on that path when it was needed.“Had I lived, you would not have made the choices that took you down that path.“At the Temple of the Winds I saw the future. Not merely one future, but manyfutures. I saw the future as it would be had I returned and lived. I saw thefuture without you. I saw the future in a thousand different ways, and thenanother thousand, and then another. I saw all the layers of possibilities andvariation, all the choices, all branches and forks in prophecy.“But I saw one future above all others that gave the world of life the bestchance in the face of the approaching dark age. In that future I saw that if Ilet you go on to walk your own path, you would be what was needed.“If I had lived, you would have been at my side. You would have had no reason todo more, to be more. The forks in prophecy would not have presented themselvesin the same way. Doorways would have remained closed. Without you seeking outtruth as you have done, our cause would have been lost because you would havenever become a Confessor.“There is so much more that I saw when I was there that brought me to my choice.Lothain lied. He did get into the Temple. He lied to hide his treason. Once inthe Temple, he reinforced the damage done by his traitors on the Temple team,altered important things there, and damaged important elements flowing towardthe world of life.“Lothain choked off the gift from the world of life so that fewer and fewer willbe born gifted, and since the Temple is in the world of the dead, he wasespecially successful at choking off Subtractive Magic. That was why the moonturned red. It turned red in warning because of the damage caused by Lothain.”Magda was not merely astonished to hear this, she was horrified. “You meanLothain managed to break the Grace and end magic in this world?”“Not entirely,” Naja answered in the strange voice. “He tried, and while he didnot succeed completely, he managed to do vast damage. He has doomed the world tobegin down the path that Emperor Sulachan envisions, the path toward a worldwithout magic. While he set the world on that path, I was at least able to keepit from being a certainty.“That was my greatest purpose, what I could do that no other would have beenable to do. But I was only able to do so much. I was able to get enough of thegift to flow along the lines of the Grace to ensure that, even as the gift inmankind dwindles, one day a pebble in the pond will be born with what isrequired to complete the restoration of the world of life, if he, too, makes theright choices at the right times.“You remember the book I brought back and the mission I sent you on upon myreturn?”Magda nodded. “Yes, you asked me to take the book, through the sliph, to yoursecret, private library. When I was gone, you killed yourself. How could Iforget such a thing?”“That journey you undertook was a portion of the part I was able to play insetting the future on a course that gives the world of life a chance in thatfuture that you have now made possible because you took your path. Had you notundertaken that task for me, the world would have been doomed. Now, if the rightchoices are made by the right people for the right reasons at the right time,then mankind still has a chance to escape the fate that Sulachan and Lothaintried to impose.“But until those others can be born, I had to let you save what we have. I couldsee that the only part I could play if I lived would be to keep you fromblossoming. I saw that I had to die in order for you to undertake the journeyyou took to search for answers, fight the dream walkers, take up the oath, seekme in the underworld through a spiritist so that you could discover that thedead down in the catacombs were serving evil, then choose to find Merritt, helphim find what he needed to create the key, and in the end come to understand whyyou would choose on your own to be altered to become a Confessor who was able tounmask the corruption in a way that all could see it.“Had I lived, none of that would have happened. I had to let you take the paththat would save the world for now. That allows you and others to live to fightanother day.“My death gave you the drive to find out why I sacrificed my life, which in turnopened your own truth. In that search for truth, you would expose what I couldnot, in a way I could not, to accomplish what I could not.“You think of me as a great man, Magda. In your eyes I may be, but I was just aman. I had faults, I had weaknesses, I had limits. I couldn’t do everything. ButI like to think I had a noble mind, and with that reasoning mind what I saw whenI was at the Temple was that what needed to be done, I could not do.“But I also saw that you could.“Merritt is similar to you in that he has a unique chance. There is no one elsewho has the knowledge, creativity, and skills that he has. No other everenvisioned what he first envisioned. No other ever would have. Only Merrittcould have envisioned and created the Sword of Truth, and only Merritt couldhave envisioned and created a Confessor.“The world needed you to be there to be that Confessor at that moment, and inmoments to come.“I know, Magda, your heart, and your loyalty to your love for me. But don’t letthat be the end of your ability to love. That love wouldn’t harm me, or diminishme, or change what we had. It can only add to you and who you are. You need toembrace the reality of what is, not what was.“What you and Merritt have is different from what you and I had. It can be more.“You share more with Merritt than I could ever share with you. You share anunderstanding, a partnership of souls, in a way that you and I never could. Youshare the Sword of Truth with him, and you share the new beginning of becoming aConfessor with him. You have been reborn into that new life. Merritt made thatpossible.“You did not see what I saw when Merritt pushed that sword through your heart.He did that not because he wanted to make you a Confessor, but because youwanted it. It was the choice you made. It was killing him inside, but he did itanyway.“It was the hardest thing he had ever done in his life, and though it waskilling him, though it was breaking his own heart, he did it because you wantedit. He wanted to give you what you wanted, no matter how much it hurt him.”Magda swallowed back her sobs. She tried to bring her voice forth, but shecouldn’t form words.“Don’t let what we had limit the even greater experience you can have withMerritt. Don’t let a misguided loyalty to me limit your heart and what you canhave in greater abundance for yourself.“To love another, you must first love yourself. Love yourself, Magda, so thatyou can love him. Love yourself enough to let your memories of me ease away fromclosing your heart.“Love yourself enough to know that you deserve happiness.“Know that I have nothing but love for Merritt, as I have for you. You havewalked the path that has taken you to the possibility of something wonderful.Don’t lose sight of that path because you are looking back at a memory of me.“I am no more. Let me go, Magda. I am at peace now, let me go deeper beyond theveil.”Tears ran down Magda’s face as she sobbed.“Thank you, Baraccus. You’ve given me so much. Thank you for my life. I won’twaste it, I swear.”“I know you won’t, Magda. I know you won’t.” "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 103 Magda stood in the center of the dais, before the half circle of the council’sdesk, before the council, in her white Confessor’s dress. There were only threecouncilmen there, Sadler, Clay, and Hambrook, but they would soon add to thosenumbers so that they could do their work.The center chair sat empty.That center chair was hers, now.She presided over the council, now.She balanced the council, now, with a Confessor’s voice.Behind her, in the great council chambers, there were a limited number ofpeople. It was not a council session opened to the general public. It wasinvited guests only.General Grundwall was there, much chagrined that he had ever expressed faith inLothain to her just because he thought that Magda had agreed to marry him. Hehad apologized countless times. Magda had to finally order him to neverapologize to her about that again.Tilly was there as well, healed, in good health, and in good cheer. She beamedwith pride at seeing Magda in her white Confessor’s dress, at seeing Magdahaving the important place at the Keep that Tilly always thought she shouldhave.Quinn, likewise all smiles, was there as well, as was Naja. Magda missedBaraccus and Isidore and all those like them who were no longer with them andwere now with the good spirits, but she was thankful for the friends they didhave with them.Merritt stood beside her, looking as handsome as she had ever seen him look. TheSword of Truth, in its ornately worked gold and silver scabbard, gleamed againsthis dark outfit. Since she was to his left, she could see the word Truthstanding out in gold letters on the hilt.Councilman Sadler beamed with pride as he addressed them.“Magda, Merritt, we at the Keep all owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude.”Magda’s hand found Merritt’s.“Now,” he said, “we must call upon you both to help the people not only of theKeep, but of the Midlands, D’Hara, and in fact all of the New World to standagainst the threats we face.“Merritt, we have taken your admonition under consideration and we agree that weshould abide by your recommendation, and Magda’s, that a Confessor’s power isbetter suited to women than men. We agree that the Confessor’s power shouldrightly only be invested in women.“We need the ability of a Confessor to help us discover truth as we go forwardin this struggle for our survival. We therefore ask that you create a new forcein the world, the Confessors, a band of sisters who can stand for truth.”Merritt bowed his head as he squeezed Magda’s hand. “I can do that.”“And Magda, we ask that you be their leader, the Mother Confessor, and help makethem as effective, as dedicated, as noble in fighting for truth as you haveshown yourself to be.”Magda bowed her head as she squeezed Merritt’s hand. “I can do that.”“And Merritt,” Councilman Sadler said, “we have come to understand, as you haveexplained it, the particular vulnerabilities of a Confessor. Especially in thetime following the use of her power, when she is weakened and less able toprotect herself. Even more critically, because of the nature of the power thatshe possesses, she is going to be a prime target for a great many dangerouspeople.“We therefore ask that you be permanently assigned to be protector to Magda, theMother Confessor. Once the band of sister Confessors is created, they too willeach need a wizard to be their protector and to help them in their duties.“But for now, there are only you two, the Mother Confessor, and her wizard. Thatis, if you both agree, of course.” He looked to each of them in turn. “Do youboth agree to this?”Magda smiled as she and Merritt shared a look.Looking into her eyes, Merritt said, “Wizard Merritt agrees and promises toalways protect Magda, the Mother Confessor.”Looking into Merritt’s eyes, Magda said, “And Magda, the Mother Confessor, willalways stand by her wizard, Merritt.”The people in the room erupted in cheering.As the people were celebrating the news, Merritt leaned close. “You lookpositively stunning, Mother Confessor.”Magda’s cheeks hurt from smiling.“Oh, I forgot to tell you about your hair,” he said in a private tone.She smoothed her hair back, then pulled out the white confession flower she hadplaced there, the flower Baraccus had once given her that she had kept in hersilver box of memories. She twirled the little flower in her fingers, thinkingabout the path she had taken.“What about my hair?”“You can’t cut it.”Magda twitched a frown up at him. “I can if I want.”“No, actually, you can’t.”“What are you talking about?”He leaned a little closer, looking a bit guilty. “The power won’t let aConfessor cut her hair.”Magda was truly puzzled. “Won’t let me? What in the world are you talkingabout?”“The length of a woman’s hair denotes status in the Midlands. You are the MotherConfessor. There is no woman of higher status than the Mother Confessor. Cuttingyour hair would be lowering your status in the eyes of many, so the magic of aConfessor’s power won’t allow it.”“Won’t allow it,” she repeated in a flat tone.“That’s right, won’t allow it.”“Well, what if it needs to be trimmed?”“Someone else has to do it.”Magda’s brow lifted. “Touchy, isn’t it?”“It can be when it comes to matters of power. It expects you to be respected.”“The length of my hair can’t earn me respect.”Merritt shrugged. “I’m just warning you.”Magda leaned into him, smiling as she tucked her shoulder under his arm. “Thanksfor the warning.”Merritt grinned as he put his arm around her. “Sure.” He pointed. “Is that theconfession flower from your box of memories?”Magda nodded. “I wanted to wear it today. Baraccus sacrificed his life so thatthis course for our future could come to be. He gave his life that we all mightbe standing here today and have this chance. I think he would be pleased.”“I think he would be, too,” Merritt said.Magda twirled the little white flower between her finger and thumb, watching itspin, thinking about all that had brought her to be the Mother Confessor.As the flower was spinning in her fingers, it began to become transparent. Shecould see right through it.And then, the flower vanished.It was gone. Simply, gone.“Did you see that?” Magda asked in astonishment.“I sure did.”She looked up at Merritt’s handsome features. “What do you think it could mean?”“I think it means whatever you want it to mean.”Magda looked down at her empty fingers a moment.“Everything,” she finally said. “It means everything.” END "},{"pageContent":"MANIFESTO Let me say up front that I love printed books. Always have, always will. Butfirst and foremost, I'm a storyteller. As a storyteller, I now have a better wayto bring you books.Stories have been with us since the dawn of mankind. Long before people inventedwriting, they told stories around the fire. Fantasy was born under the stars asparables of man's place in a mysterious universe. Later those stories were setdown on clay tablets, and then scrolls and animal skins, and later yet, in thelast, thin sliver of story-telling history, printed on paper. Stories in spokenform were only recently able to be recorded so people could listen to them attheir convenience. Comic books and graphic novels told stories with words anddrawings. When film came along, stories became movies.The important thread through every form in which stories are told is the storyitself.Every change throughout history has brought improvements and benefits to thosewho are eager for the stories themselves.I have long wanted to tell the story of Magda Searus, the First Confessor.Because this is such a special book, I wanted to bring it directly to readersmyself, without the filtering middleman of a traditional publisher, the longwait, and the higher price. Now, with ebooks, I am able to bring this story Ihave long wanted to tell directly to readers and also be much more involved inthe entire process than was ever possible before.Publishers have long had total control over books, over what is printed and whatyou read. Now, they stand against change by refusing to buy any book from anyauthor unless they also control the ebook edition. They do this to prevent anyauthor from publishing his own ebook. They want to maintain total and absolutecontrol over books in all forms.For me, bringing this book directly to readers myself was far too important togive up that right. I wanted to be involved in every aspect of the book, in itsdesign, in the way it is promoted, in its presentation, in the messaging aboutit, and to be there for readers at every step along that path. I wanted them tosee it all unfold. I wanted this to be a first, a partnership between author andreader, without the heavy hand of publishers.By not selling the whole bag of rights to a publisher, I gave up a substantialadvance. It also meant that I can’t have a hardcover edition featured on bookshelves.Why then am I willing to forego a big advance, not be able to offer hardcovers,and go to all the effort and expense of doing this myself? Because I believethat strongly in this book. The story is what matters and I wanted it presentedbetter than was ever possible in traditional publishing. I wanted to present itartfully, with my creative control, my vision, my passion. I wanted to breathelife into it the way I knew could be done. I also believe strongly in the futureof electronic publishing and all the tremendous advantages it holds for bothauthors and readers. Though it is a huge risk, I wanted to be the first amongbestselling authors to do this because I wanted to show that it can be aremarkable, memorable, exciting experience for readers.I hope to have your support on this new path to bring great books directly fromme to you at a great price. I love printed books so I completely understand whysome of you prefer a paper book. But this story is more important than a mereformat.I will have books in printed form in the future, but this one is special.For this special book, I'm asking you to try something new—after all, I am.Journey with me on this new path for a little while and let me tell you a storyyou have never before imagined and will never be able to forget. As many of you know, when Richard was taken to the Old World he was told what tocarve, how to carve it, where it would appear, and when. It was all out of hishands. What did he do? He carved his own statue, his own way, and revealed it onhis terms, one man taking his work directly to the people. THE FIRST CONFESSORis my statue, my own creation through and through. The subtitle could very wellbe “It’s my life. I am rising up and living it.” Welcome to the New World.I've made the book less expensive and easy to get from anywhere in the world,day or night, without leaving home. I hope you will try this book that is soclose to my heart and discover this moving story. Think of all you have to gain.It's true that this is not a book you stick on a shelf. This is a story you willinstead always carry in your heart.Thank you all for your trust and your support. sigtg-securealtered-1.png [images/00002.jpg]Terry Goodkind"},{"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTAL CONTENT Coming August 2012 as a free enhancement to this ebook.
