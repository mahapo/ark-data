He wasn’t sure who they were. He knew that he knew them, but rightthen it just didn’t seem to matter.The crushing pain in the left side of his chest and his need for air had him atthe ragged edge of panic. It was all he could do to try to draw each crucialbreath.Even so, he had a bigger worry.Richard struggled to put voice to his burning concern, but he couldn’t form thewords, couldn’t get out any more than a gasping moan. He clutched the arm of thewoman beside him, desperate to get them to stop, to get them to listen. Shemisunderstood and instead urged the men carrying him to hurry, even though theywere already panting with the effort of bearing him over the rocky ground in thedeep shade among the towering pines. They tried to be as gentle as possible, butthey never dared to slow.Not far off, a rooster crowed into the still air, as if this were an ordinarymorning like any other.Richard observed the storm of activity swirling around him with an odd sense ofdetachment. Only the pain seemed real. He remembered hearing it once said thatwhen you died, no matter how many people were there with you, you died allalone. That’s how he felt now—alone.As they broke from the timber into a thinly wooded, rough field of clumpedgrass, Richard saw above the leafy limbs a leaden sky threatening to unleashtorrents of rain. Rain was the last thing he needed. If only it would hold off.As they raced along, the unpainted wooden walls of a small building came intoview, followed by a twisting livestock fence weathered to a silver gray.Startled chickens squawked in fright as they scattered out of the way. Menshouted orders. Richard hardly noticed the ashen faces watching him beingcarried past as he stiffened himself against the dizzying pain of the roughjourney. It felt as if he were being ripped apart.The whole mob around him funneled through a narrow doorway and shuffled into thedarkness beyond.“Here,” the first woman said. Richard was surprised to realize, then, that itwas Nicci’s voice. “Put him here, on the table. Hurry.”Richard heard tin cups clatter as someone swept them aside. Small items thunkedto the ground and bounced across a dirt floor. The shutters banged back as theywere flung open to let some of the flat light into the musty room.It appeared to be a deserted farmhouse. The walls tilted at an odd angle as ifthe place were having difficulty standing, as if it might collapse at anymoment. Without the people who had once made it home, given it life, it had theaura of a place waiting for death to settle in.Men holding his legs and arms lifted him and then carefully set him down on thecrudely hewn plank table. Richard wanted to hold his breath against the crushingagony radiating from the left side of his chest, but he desperately needed thebreath that he couldn’t seem to get.He needed the breath in order to speak.Lightning flashed. A moment later thunder rumbled heavily.“Lucky we made it into shelter before the rain,” one of the men said.Nicci nodded absently as she leaned close, groping purposefully across Richard’schest. He cried out, arching his back against the heavy wooden tabletop, tryingto twist away from her probing fingers. The other woman immediately pressed hisshoulders down to keep him in place.He tried to speak. He almost got the words out, but then he coughed up amouthful of thick blood. He started choking as he tried to breathe.The woman holding his shoulders turned his head aside. “Spit,” she told him asshe bent close.The feeling of not being able to get any air brought a flash of hot fear.Richard did as she said. She swept her fingers through his mouth, working toclear an airway. With her help he finally managed to cough and spit out enoughblood to be able to pull in some of the air he so desperately needed.As Nicci’s fingers probed the area around the arrow jutting from the left sideof his chest, she cursed under her breath.“Dear spirits,” she murmured in soft prayer as she tore open his blood-soakedshirt, “let me be in time.”“I was afraid to pull out the arrow,” the other woman said. “I didn’t know whatwould happen—didn’t know if I should—so I decided I’d better leave it and hope Icould find you.”“Be thankful you didn’t try,” Nicci said, her hand slipping under Richard’s backas he writhed in pain. “If you’d pulled it out he’d be dead by now.”“But you can heal him.” It sounded more a plea than a question.Nicci didn’t answer.“You can heal him.” That time the words hissed out through gritted teeth.At the tone of command born of frayed patience, Richard realized that it wasCara. He hadn’t had time to tell her before the attack. Surely she would have toknow. But if she knew, then why didn’t she say? Why didn’t she put him at ease?“If it hadn’t been for him, we’d have been taken by surprise,” said a manstanding off to the side. “He saved us all when he waylaid those soldierssneaking up on us.”“You have to help him,” another man insisted.Nicci impatiently waved her arm. “All of you, get out. This place is smallenough as it is. I can’t afford the distraction right now. I need some quiet.”Lightning flashed again, as if the good spirits intended to deny her what sheneeded. Thunder boomed with a deep, resonant threat of the storm closing aroundthem.“You’ll send Cara out when you know something?” one of the men asked.“Yes, yes. Go.”“And make sure there aren’t any more soldiers around to surprise us,” Caraadded. “Keep out of sight in case there are. We can’t afford to be discoveredhere—not right now.”Men swore to do her bidding. Hazy light spilled across a dingy plastered wallwhen the door opened. As the men departed, their shadows ghosted through thepatch of light, like the good spirits themselves abandoning him.On his way by, one of the men briefly touched Richard’s shoulder—an offer ofcomfort and courage. Richard vaguely recognized the face. He hadn’t seen thesemen for quite a while. The thought occurred to him that this was no way to havea reunion. The light vanished as the men pulled the door closed behindthemselves, leaving the room in the gloom of light coming from the singlewindow.“Nicci,” Cara pressed in a low voice, “you can heal him?”Richard had been on his way to meet up with Nicci when troops sent to put downthe uprising against the brutal rule of the Imperial Order had accidentally comeupon his secluded camp. His first thought, just before the soldiers hadblundered upon him, had been that he had to find Nicci. A spark of hope flareddown into the darkness of his frantic worry; Nicci could help him.Now Richard needed to get her to listen.As she leaned close, her hand sliding around under him, apparently trying to seehow close the arrow came to penetrating all the way through his back, Richardmanaged to clutch her black dress at the shoulder. He saw that his handglistened with blood. He felt more running back across his face when he coughed.Her blue eyes turned to him. “Everything will be all right, Richard. Lie still.”A skein of blond hair slipped forward over her other shoulder as he tried topull her closer. “I’m here. Calm down. I won’t leave you. Lie still. It’s allright. I’m going to help you.”Despite how smoothly she covered it, panic lurked in her voice. Despite herreassuring smile, her eyes glistened with tears. He knew then that his woundmight very well be beyond her ability to heal.That only made it all the more important that he get her to listen.Richard opened his mouth, trying to speak. He couldn’t seem to get enough air.He shivered with cold, each breath a struggle that produced little more than awet rattle. He couldn’t die, not here, not now. Tears stung his eyes.Nicci gently pressed him back down.“Lord Rahl,” Cara said, “lie still. Please.” She took his hand from its hold onNicci’s dress and held it against herself in a tight grip. “Nicci will take careof you. You’ll be fine. Just lie still and let her do what she needs to do toheal you.”Where Nicci’s blond hair was loose and flowing, Cara’s was woven into a singlebraid. Despite how concerned he knew her to be, Richard could see in Cara’sposture only her powerful presence, and in her features and her iron blue eyesher strength of will. Right then, that strength, that self-assurance, was solidground for him in the quicksand of terror.“The arrow doesn’t go all the way through,” Nicci told Cara as she pulled herhand out from under his back.“I told you so. He managed to at least deflect it with his sword. That’s good,isn’t it? It’s better that it didn’t pierce his back as well, isn’t it?”“No,” Nicci said under her breath.“No?” Cara leaned closer to Nicci. “But how can it be worse that it didn’t ripthrough his back as well?”Nicci glanced up at Cara. “It’s a crossbow bolt. If it were sticking out hisback, or close enough to need only to be pushed just a little more, we couldbreak off the barbed head and pull the shaft back out.”She left unsaid what they would now have to do.“His bleeding isn’t as bad,” Cara offered. “We’ve stopped that, at least.”“Maybe on the outside,” Nicci said in a confidential tone. “But he is bleedinginto his chest—blood is filling his left lung.”This time it was Cara who snatched a fistful of Nicci’s dress. “But you’re goingto do something. You’re going to—”“Of course,” Nicci growled as she pulled her shoulder free of Cara’s grip.Richard gasped in pain. The rising waters of panic threatened to overwhelm him.Nicci laid her other hand on his chest to hold him still as well as to offercomfort.“Cara,” Nicci said, “why don’t you wait outside with the others.”“That isn’t going to happen. You’d best just get on with it.”Nicci appraised Cara’s eyes briefly, then leaned in and again grasped the shaftjutting from Richard’s chest. He felt the probing tingle of magic follow thecourse of the arrow down deep inside him. Richard recognized the unique feel ofNicci’s power, much as he could recognize her singular silken voice.He knew that there was no time to delay in what he had to do. Once she started,there was no telling how long it would be until he woke… if he woke.With all his effort, Richard lunged, seizing her dress at the collar. He pulledhimself close to her face, pulled her down toward him so she could hear him.He had to ask if they knew where Kahlan was. If they didn’t, then he had to askNicci to help him find her.The only thing he could get out was the single word.“Kahlan,” he whispered with all his strength.“All right, Richard. All right.” Nicci gripped his wrists and pulled his handsoff her dress. “Listen to me.” She pressed him back down against the table.“Listen. There’s no time. You have to calm down. Be still. Just relax and let medo the work.”She brushed back his hair and laid a gentle, caring hand to his forehead as herother hand again grasped the cursed arrow.Richard desperately struggled to say no, struggled to tell them that they neededto find Kahlan, but already the tingle of magic was intensifying into paralyzingpain.Richard went rigid with the agony of the power lancing into his chest.He could see Nicci and Cara’s faces above him.And then a deadly darkness ignited within the room.He had been healed by Nicci before. Richard knew the feel of her power. Thistime, something was different. Dangerously different.Cara gasped. “What are you doing!”“What I must if I’m to save him. It’s the only way.”“But you can’t—”“If you’d rather I let him slip into the arms of death, then say so. Otherwise,let me do as I must to keep him among us.”Cara studied Nicci’s heated expression for only a moment before letting out anoisy breath and nodding.Richard reached for Nicci’s wrist, but Cara caught his first and pressed it backto the table. His fingers came to rest on the woven gold wire spelling out theword truth on the hilt of his sword. He spoke Kahlan’s name again, but this timeno sound would cross his lips.Cara frowned as she leaned toward Nicci. “Did you hear what it was he said?”“I don’t know. Some name. Kahlan, I think.”Richard tried to cry “Yes,” but it came out as little more than a hoarse moan.“Kahlan?” Cara asked. “Who’s Kahlan?”“I have no idea,” Nicci murmured as her concentration returned to the task athand. “He’s obviously in delirium from loss of blood.”Richard truly couldn’t draw a breath against the pain that suddenly screamedthrough him.Lightning flashed and thunder pealed again, this time unleashing a torrent ofrain that began to drum against the roof.Against his will, hazy darkness drew in around the faces.Richard managed only to whisper Kahlan’s name one last time before Nicci openedinto him the full flood of magic.The world dissolved into nothingness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2The distant howl of a wolf woke Richard from a dead sleep. The forlorn cryechoed through the mountains, but went unanswered. Richard lay on his side, inthe surreal light of false dawn, idly listening, waiting, for a return cry thatnever came.Try as he might, he couldn’t seem to open his eyes for longer than the span of asingle, slow heartbeat, much less gather the energy to lift his head. Shadowytree limbs appeared to move about in the murky darkness. It was odd that such anordinary sound as the distant howl of a wolf should wake him.He remembered that Cara had third watch. She would no doubt come to wake themsoon enough. With great effort, he summoned the strength to roll over. He neededto touch Kahlan, to embrace her, to go back to sleep with her in his protectivearms for a few more delicious minutes. His hand found only an expanse of emptyground.Kahlan wasn’t there.Where was she? Where had she gone off to? Perhaps she’d awakened early and goneto talk to Cara.Richard sat up. He instinctively checked to make sure that his sword was athand. The reassuring feel of the polished scabbard and wire-wound hilt greetedhis fingers. The sword lay on the ground beside him.Richard heard the soft whisper of a slow, steady rain. He remembered that forsome reason he needed it not to rain.But if it was raining, then why didn’t he feel it? Why was his face dry? Why wasthe ground dry?He sat up rubbing his eyes, trying to get his bearings, trying to clear hisfoggy mind as he fought to herd together scattered thoughts. He peered into thedarkness and realized that he wasn’t outside. In the faint gray light of dawncoming in through a single small window he saw that he was in a derelict room.The place smelled of wet wood and damp decay. Dying embers glowed deep withinthe ash in a hearth set into a plastered wall rising up before him. A blackenedwooden spoon hung to one side of the hearth, a mostly bald broom leaned againstthe other side, but other than that he saw no personal items to distinguish thepeople who lived there.Daybreak looked to be still some time off. The incessant patter of the rainagainst the roof promised that there would be no sun this chilly and damp day.Besides dripping through several holes in the tattered roof, rain leaked inaround the chimney, adding yet another layer of stain to the dingy plaster.Seeing the plastered wall, the hearth, and the heavy plank table brought backspectral fragments of memories.Driven by his need to know where Kahlan was, Richard staggered to his feet,clutching at the lingering pain in the left side of his chest with one hand andthe edge of the table with his other.At hearing him stand in the dimly lit room, Cara, leaning back in a chair notfar away, shot to her feet. “Lord Rahl!”He saw his sword lying on the table. But he had thought—“Lord Rahl, you’re awake!” In the somber light Richard could see that Caralooked exuberant. He also saw that she was wearing her red leather.“A wolf howled and woke me.”Cara shook her head. “I’ve been sitting right there, awake, watching over you.No wolf howled. You must have dreamed it.” Her smile returned. “You lookbetter!”He recalled not being able to breathe, not being able to get enough air. He tookan experimental deep breath and found that it came easily. While the ghost ofterrible pain still haunted him, the reality of it had nearly faded away.“Yes, I think I’m all right.”Short, disjointed memories flashed in fits before his mind’s eye. He rememberedstanding alone and still in the eerie early light as the dark tide of ImperialOrder soldiers flooded through the trees. He remembered bits of their wildcharge, their raised weapons. He remembered releasing himself into the fluiddance with death. He remembered, too, the hail of arrows and bolts fromcrossbows, and, finally, other men joining the battle.Richard lifted the front of his shirt out away from himself, looking down at it,not understanding why it was whole.“Your shirt was ruined,” Cara offered, noticing his puzzlement. “We washed andshaved you, then we put a clean shirt on you.”We. That one word rose up above all others in his mind. We. Cara and Kahlan.That had to be what Cara meant.“Where is she?”“Who?”“Kahlan,” he said as he took a stride away from the support of the table. “Whereis she?”“Kahlan?” Cara’s features meandered into a provocative smile. “Who’s Kahlan?”Richard sighed with relief. Cara would not be needling him in such a way ifKahlan were hurt or in any kind of trouble—that much he knew for certain. Anoverwhelming sense of relief purged his dread and with it some of his weariness.Kahlan was safe.He couldn’t help being cheered, too, by Cara’s impish expression. He loved tosee her with a lighthearted smile, in part because it was such a rare sight.Usually when a Mord-Sith smiled it was a menacing prelude to something whollyunpleasant. The same was true when they wore their red leather.“Kahlan,” Richard said, playing along, “you know, my wife. Where is she?”Cara’s nose wrinkled with seldom-seen feminine mirth. Such an extraordinary lookwas so uncommon on Cara that it not only surprised him, but spurred him into agrin.“A wife,” she drawled, turning coy. “Now, there’s a novel concept—the Lord Rahltaking a wife.”That he found himself to be the Lord Rahl, the leader of D’Hara, at times stillseemed unreal to him. It was not the kind of thing a woods guide growing up infar-off Westland would ever have dreamed up in his wildest imaginings.“Yes, well, one of us had to be the first.” He wiped a hand across his face,still trying to clear the web of sleep from his mind. “Where is she?”Cara’s smile widened. “Kahlan.” She tilted her head toward him, arching onebrow. “Your wife.”“Yes, Kahlan, my wife,” Richard said offhandedly. He had long ago learned thatit was best not to give Cara the satisfaction of seeing her mischievous anticsget to him. “You remember her—intelligent, green eves, tall, long hair, and ofcourse the most beautiful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on.”The leather of Cara’s outfit creaked as she straightened her back and folded herarms. “You mean the most beautiful besides me, of course.” Her eyes wereluminous when she smiled. He didn’t rise to the bait.“Well,” Cara finally said with a sigh, “the Lord Rahl certainly seems to havehad an interesting dream during his long sleep.”“Long sleep?”“You’ve been asleep for two days—after Nicci healed you.”Richard raked his fingers back through his dirty, matted hair. “Two days…” hesaid as he tried to reconcile his fragmented memories. He was becoming annoyedwith Cara’s game. “So where is she?”“Your wife?”“Yes, my wife.” Richard planted his fists on his hips as he leaned toward theirksome woman. “You know, the Mother Confessor.”“Mother Confessor! My, my, Lord Rahl, but when you dream you certainly do dreambig. Smart, beautiful, and the Mother Confessor as well.” Cara leaned in with ataunting look. “And no doubt she’s also madly in love with you?”“Cara—”“Oh, wait.” She held up a hand to stop him as she abruptly turned serious.“Nicci said that she wanted me to go get her if you woke. She was reallyinsistent about it—said that if you woke she needed to have a look at you.” Carastarted toward the single closed door at the back of the room. “She’s only beenasleep for a couple of hours, but she’ll want to know that you’re awake.”Cara was in the back room for no more than a moment when Nicci burst out of thedarkness, pausing briefly to grasp the doorframe. “Richard!”Before Richard could say anything, Nicci, her eyes wide with relief at seeinghim alive, dashed to him and seized his shoulders as if she thought he were agood spirit come to the world of the living and only her firm grip would keephim there.“I was so worried. How are you feeling?”She looked as drained as he felt. Her mane of blond hair hadn’t been brushed outand it looked like she’d been sleeping in her black dress. Even so, the contrastof her disheveled appearance only served to highlight her exquisite beauty.“Well, all right for the most part, except that I feel exhausted and lightheadeddespite having had what Cara tells me was quite a long sleep.”Nicci dismissively waved a slender hand. “That’s to be expected. With rest youwill have your full strength back soon enough. You lost a lot of blood. It willtake time for your body to recover.”“Nicci, I need—”“Hush,” she said as she put one hand behind his back and pressed the flat of herother to his chest. Her smooth brow drew together in concentration.Though she appeared to be about his age, or at most only a year or two older,she had lived a very long time as a Sister of the Light at the Palace of theProphets, where those within the walls aged differently. Nicci’s gracefulmanner, the keen appraisal of her blue eyes, and her singular subduedsmile—always delivered with her knowing gaze locked on his—had been at firstdistracting and then unsettling, but was now merely familiar.Richard winced as he felt Nicci’s power tingling deep into his chest, betweenher hands. It was a disconcerting penetration. It made his heart flutter. A mildwave of nausea coursed through him.“It’s holding,” Nicci murmured to herself. She looked up into his eyes then.“The vessels are whole and strong.” The look of wonder in her eyes betrayed howuncertain she had been of success. Some of her reassuring smile returned. “Youstill need to rest, but you’re doing well, Richard, you really are.”He nodded, relieved to hear that he was healthy, even if she sounded a littlesurprised by it. But his other concerns needed to be put to rest, as well.“Nicci, where’s Kahlan? Cara’s in one of her moods this morning and won’t say.”Nicci looked to be at a loss. “Who?”Richard took hold of her wrist and removed her hand from his chest. “What’swrong? Is she hurt? Where is she?”Cara tilted her head toward Nicci. “While he slept, Lord Rahl dreamed himself upa wife.”Nicci turned an astonished frown on Cara. “A wife!”“Remember the name he called out when he was delirious?” Cara flashed aconspiratorial smile. “That’s the one he married in his dream. She’sbeautiful—and smart, of course.”“Beautiful.” Nicci blinked at the woman. “And smart.”Cara cocked an eyebrow. “And she’s the Mother Confessor.”Nicci looked incredulous. “The Mother Confessor.”“Enough,” Richard said as he released Nicci’s wrist. “I mean it, now.Where is she?”It was immediately apparent to both women that his indulgent sense of humor hadevaporated. The intensity in his voice, to say nothing of his glare, gave thempause.“Richard,” Nicci said in a cautious tone, “you were hurt pretty bad. For a timeI didn’t think…” She hooked a stray strand of hair behind her ear and startedover. “Look, when a person is hurt as seriously as you were, it can play trickswith their mind. It’s only natural. I’ve seen it before. When you were shot withthat arrow you couldn’t breathe. Not getting air, like when you’re drowning,causes—”“What’s the matter with you two? What’s going on?” Richard couldn’t understandwhy they were stalling. His heart felt as if it were galloping out of control.“Is she hurt? Tell me!”“Richard,” Nicci said in a calm voice obviously meant to settle him down, “thebolt from that crossbow came perilously close to going right through your heart.If it had, there wouldn’t have been anything I could have done. I can’t raisethe dead.“Even though it missed your heart, the arrow still did serious damage. Peoplejust don’t survive a wound as grave as you had. I wouldn’t have been able toheal you in the conventional manner because it couldn’t be done. There was notime to even try to get the arrow out in any other way. You were bleedinginside. I had to…”She faltered as she stared up into his eyes. Richard bent down a little towardher. “You had to what?”Nicci shrugged one shoulder self-consciously. “I had to use Subtractive Magic.”Nicci was a powerful sorceress in her own right, but she was infinitely moreexceptional in that she was able to wield underworld forces as well. She hadonce been committed to those forces. She had once been known as Death’sMistress. Healing was not exactly her specialty.Richard’s caution flared. “Why?”“To get the arrow out of you.”“You eliminated the arrow with Subtractive Magic?”“There was no time and no other way.” She again clasped his shoulders, althoughmore compassionately this time. “If I hadn’t done something you would have beendead in mere moments. I had to.”Richard glanced to Cara’s grim expression and then back to Nicci. “Well, I guessthat makes sense.”At least, it sounded like it made sense. He didn’t really know if it did or not.Having been raised in the vast woods of Westland, Richard didn’t know a greatdeal about magic.“And some of your blood,” Nicci added in a low voice.He didn’t like the sound of that. “What?”“You were bleeding into your chest. One lung had already failed. I was able toperceive that your heart was being forced out of place. The major arteries werein danger of being ripped apart from the pressure. I needed the blood out of theway in order to heal you—so that your lungs and heart could work properly. Theywere failing. You were in a state of shock and delirium. You were near death.”Nicci’s blue eyes brimmed with tears. “I was so afraid, Richard. There was noone but me to help you and I was so afraid that I would fail. Even after I dideverything I could to heal you, I still wasn’t sure you would ever wake again.”Richard could see the toll of that fear in her expression and feel it in the wayher fingers trembled on his arms. It spoke to how far she had come since she hadgiven up her belief in the cause of the Sisters of the Dark and then theImperial Order.The haunted look on Cara’s face confirmed for him the truth of how desperate thesituation had been. For all the sleep he’d apparently gotten, neither of themappeared to have had much more than brief naps. It must have been a frighteningvigil.The rain drummed without letup against the roof. Other than that, the dank huskof a house was dead quiet. Life seemed all the more fleeting in the abandonedhome. The forsaken place gave Richard the chills.“You saved my life, Nicci. I remember being afraid I was going to die. But yousaved my life.” He touched his fingertips to her cheek. “Thank you. I wish therewas a better way to say it, a better way to tell you how much I appreciate whatyou did, but I can’t think of any.”Nicci’s small smile and simple nod told him that she grasped the depth of hissincerity.Another thought struck him. “Do you mean to say that using Subtractive Magiccaused some kind of… problem?”“No, no, Richard.” Nicci squeezed his arms as if to allay his fears. “No, Idon’t think that it caused any harm.”“What do you mean, you don’t think it did?”She hesitated a moment before explaining. “I’ve never done anything like thatbefore. I’ve never even heard of it being done. Dear spirits, I didn’t even knowthat it could be done. As I’m sure you can imagine, using Subtractive Magic insuch a way is risky, to put it mildly. Anything living touched by it would alsobe destroyed. I had to use the core of the arrow itself as a pathway into you. Iwas as careful as I could possibly be that I only eliminated the arrow… and thespent blood.”Richard wondered what happened to things when Subtractive Magic was used—whatwould have happened to his blood—but his head was already spinning with thestory and he most wanted her to get to the point.“But between all that,” Nicci added, “between the massive loss of blood, theinjury, the dire condition of not being able to get enough air, the stress youunderwent while I used regular Additive Magic to heal you—to say nothing of theunknown element that Subtractive Magic added into the mix—you were going throughan experience that can only be described as unpredictable. Such a terriblecrisis can cause unexpected things to happen.”Richard didn’t know what she was getting at. “What unexpected things?”“There’s no telling. I had no choice but to use extreme methods. You were beyondwhat I thought were all limits. You have to try to understand that you were notyourself there for a while.”Cara hooked a thumb behind her red leather belt. “Nicci is right, Lord Rahl. Youweren’t yourself. You were fighting us. I had to hold you down just so she couldhelp you.“I’ve stood over men at the cusp of death. Strange things happen when they’re inthat place. Believe me, you were there a long time into that first night.”Richard knew very well what she meant when she said that she had stood over menon the cusp of death. The profession of Mord-Sith had been torture—at least ithad been until he changed all that. He carried the Agiel of Denna, the Mord-Sithwho had once stood over him in that capacity. She had given him her Agiel as asolemn gift in gratitude for freeing her from the madness of her terrible duty…even though she had known that the price of that freedom was to be his swordthrough her heart.Right then Richard felt a very long way from the peaceful woods where he’d grownup.Nicci spread her hands as if imploring him to try harder to understand. “Youwere unconscious and then asleep for quite a time. I had to revive you enough toget you to drink water and a broth, but I needed you to stay in a deep sleep sothat you could begin to recover your strength. I had to use a spell to keep youin that state. You’d lost a lot of blood; had I allowed you to awake too soon itwould have sapped your tenuous strength and you still could have slipped awayfrom us.”Died, that was what she meant. He could have died. Richard took a deep breath.He’d had no idea of everything that had gone on over the last three days. Hebasically recalled the battle and then waking when he heard the wolf howl.“Nicci,” he said, trying to show her that he could be calm and understandingeven though he felt neither, “what does this have to do with Kahlan?”Her features were set in an uneasy mix of empathy and disquiet. “Richard, thiswoman, Kahlan, is just a product of your mind when you were in that confusedstate of shock and delirium before I could heal you.”“Nicci, I wasn’t imagining—”“You were at the brink of death,” she said as she held up a hand, commandingsilence and for him to listen. “In your mind you were grasping for someone tohelp you—someone like this person, Kahlan. Please believe me when I say thatit’s understandable. But you’re awake now and must face the truth. She wasfigment born of your dire condition.”Richard was dumbfounded to hear her even suggesting such a thing. He turned toCara, imploring her to come to her senses, if not his rescue. “How could youpossibly think such a thing? How could you believe it?”“Haven’t you ever had a dream where you were terrified and then your long-deadmother was there, alive, and she was going to help you?” Cara’s unblinking blueeyes seemed focused elsewhere. “Don’t you remember waking after such dreams andfeeling sure that it had been real, that your mother was alive again, reallyalive, and that she was going to help you?Don’t you remember how much you wanted to cling to that feeling? Don’t youremember how desperately you wanted it to be real?”Nicci lightly touched the place where the arrow had been, where his flesh wasnow whole. “After I’d healed you to the point that you were past the worst ofthe crisis, you went into a long dreaming state of sleep. You carried thesedesperate illusions forward with you. You dreamed about them, added to them,lived with them longer than any ordinary sleep. This prolonged dream, thiscomforting illusion, this divine longing, had time to seep into every corner ofyour thoughts, saturate every part of your mind, and became real to you, just asCara says, but, because of the length of time you were asleep, it gained evenmore power. Now that you’ve only just come awake from that protracted sleep youare merely having a little trouble filtering out what part of your ordeal was adream and what was real.”“Nicci is right, Lord Rahl.” Richard couldn’t remember Cara ever looking so deadserious. “You just dreamed it—like you dreamed that you heard a wolf howl. Itsounds like a nice dream—this woman you dreamed you married—but that’s all itis: a dream.”Richard’s mind reeled. The concept of Kahlan being nothing more than a dream, afigment of his imagination born in his delirium, was, at its core, terrifying.That terror stormed unchecked through him. If what they were saying was true,then he didn’t want to be awake. If it was true, then he wished that Nicci hadnever healed him. He didn’t want to live in a world where Kahlan wasn’t real. ,He groped for solid ground in a sea of dark disorder, too stunned to think of away to fight such a shapeless threat. He felt confused by his ordeal and that hedidn’t remember much of it. His certainty in what he regarded as truth began tocrumble.He caught himself. He knew better than to believe a fear and thus give it life.While he could not fathom how they’d latched on to such a monstrous idea, heknew that Kahlan wasn’t a dream.“After all that you’ve both shared with her, how can you two possibly say thatKahlan is just a dream?”“How indeed,” Nicci asked, “if what you’re saying were true?”“Lord Rahl, we would never be so cruel as to try to deceive you about somethingso important to you.”Richard blinked at them. Could it be? He frantically tried to imagine if therewas any possibility that what they were saying could be true.His fists tightened. “Stop it—both of you!”It was a plea for a return of sanity. He hadn’t meant for it to come out asthreatening, but it did. Nicci took half a step back. Cara’s face lost a littleof its color.Richard couldn’t slow his breathing, his racing heart.“I don’t remember my dreams.” He looked at each of them in turn. “Not since Iwas little. I don’t remember any dreams while I was hurt, or while I slept.None. Dreams are meaningless. Kahlan is not. Don’t do this to me—please. Thisisn’t helping anything, it’s only making it worse. Please, if something hashappened to Kahlan, I need to know.”That had to be it. Something had happened to her and they just didn’t think hewas strong enough yet to handle the news.A worse fear by far welled up when he recalled Nicci saying that she couldn’traise the dead. Could they be trying to shield him from that?He gritted his teeth with the effort not to scream at them, to keep his voicelevel and in control. “Where is Kahlan?”Nicci cautiously dipped her head, as if beseeching his forgiveness. “Richard,she is just in your mind. I know that such things can seem very real, but it’snot. You dreamed her up while you were hurt… nothing more.”“I did not dream up Kahlan.” He again turned his plea to the Mord-Sith. “Cara,you’ve been with us for more than two years. You’ve fought with us, fought forus. Back when Nicci was a Sister of the Dark and she brought me down here to theOld World, you stood in for me and protected Kahlan. She has protected you.You’ve shared and endured things that most people could never even imagine.You’ve become friends.”He gestured to her Agiel, the weapon that looked like nothing more than a short,thin red leather rod hanging by a thin gold chain from her right wrist.“You even named Kahlan a sister of the Agiel.”Cara stood stiff and mute.Cara’s conferring on Kahlan the title of sister of the Agiel had been aninformal but deeply solemn accolade from a former mortal enemy to a woman shehad come to respect and trust.“Cara, you may have started out as a protector to the Lord Rahl, but you’vebecome more than that to Kahlan and me. You’ve become like family.”Cara would willingly and without hesitation sacrifice her life to protectRichard. She was not only ruthless but fearless in her defense of him.The one thing Cara did fear was disappointing him.That fear was clearly evident in her eyes.“Thank you, Lord Rahl,” she finally said in a meek voice, “for including me inyour wonderful dream.”Richard’s flesh prickled as a wave of cold dread washed up through him.Overwhelmed, he pressed his hand to his forehead, pushing back his hair. Thesetwo women were not inventing some story for fear of telling him bad news. Theywere telling him the truth.The truth as they saw it, anyway. The truth somehow twisted into a nightmare.He couldn’t make any of it work in his mind, couldn’t make any sense of it.After all they had shared with Kahlan, all they had been through with her, alltheir time together, it was impossible for him to understand how these two womencould be saying this to him.And yet, they were.Although he couldn’t conceive of the cause, something was obviously anddreadfully wrong. A suffocating sense of foreboding settled over him. It felt asif the whole world had been turned upside down and now he couldn’t make thepieces fit back together.He had to do something—what he had been about to do just before the soldiers hadattacked them. Maybe it wasn’t too late."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3Richard knelt beside his bedroll and started jamming clothes into his pack. Thecold drizzle he could see through the small window didn’t look like it would beending anytime soon, so he left his cloak out.“What do you think you’re doing?” Nicci asked.He spotted a cake of soap lying nearby and snatched it up. “What does it looklike I’m doing?”He had already lost far too much time; he’d lost days. There was no time towaste. He shoved the cake of soap, packets of dried herbs and spices, and apouch of dried apricots down into the pack before quickly furling his bedroll.Cara abandoned questioning or objecting and instead set about packing her ownthings.“That’s not what I mean and you know it.” Nicci squatted down beside him andtook hold of his arm, pulling him around to look at her. “Richard, you can’tleave. You need to rest. I told you, you lost a lot of blood. You aren’t strongenough yet to go running off chasing phantoms.”He stifled an indignant reply and yanked tight a leather thong around hisbedroll. “I feel fine.” He didn’t, of course, but he felt good enough.Nicci had just spent days of intense effort saving his life. Besides beingworried for him, she was exhausted and probably wasn’t thinking clearly. All ofthose things likely contributed to her believing he was acting irresponsibly.Still, he bristled that she didn’t give him more credit.Nicci insistently gripped a fistful of his shirt as he cinched the second thongtight. “You don’t yet realize how weak you really are, Richard. You’rejeopardizing your life. You need to rest in order for your body to be able torecover. You haven’t had nearly enough time to build your strength.”“And how much time does Kahlan have?” He seized Nicci’s upper arm and in heatedfrustration pulled her close. “She’s out there, somewhere, in trouble. You don’trealize it, Cara doesn’t realize it, but I do. Do you think I can just liearound here when the person I love more than anything in the world is in peril?“If it were you in trouble, Nicci, would you wish me to so easily give up onyou? Wouldn’t you want me to try? I don’t know what’s gone wrong, but somethinghas. If I’m right—and I am—then I can’t even begin to guess at the implicationsor imagine the consequences.”“What do you mean?”“Well, if you’re right then I’m just imagining things out of my dreams. But ifI’m right—and since it’s pretty obvious that you and Cara can’t both be sharingthe same mental disorder—that would have to mean that whatever is happening hasa cause that isn’t benevolent. I can’t afford to delay and risk everything whileI try to convince you of the seriousness of the situation. Too much time hasalready been lost. Too much is at stake.”Nicci looked too startled by the notion to speak. Richard released her andturned back to fasten down the flap on his pack. He didn’t have the time to tryto solve the puzzle of whatever was going on with Nicci and Cara.Nicci finally found her voice. “Richard, don’t you see what you’re doing? You’rebeginning to invent absurd notions in order to justify what you want to believe.You said it yourself—Cara and I can’t both be sharing the same disorder of themind. Stay and rest. We can try to discover the nature of this dream that hastaken such strong root in your mind and hopefully set it right. I probablycaused it with something I did when I was trying to heal you. If so, I’m sorry.Please, Richard, stay for now.”She was focused only on what she saw as the problem. Zedd, his grandfather, theman who had helped raise him, had often said as Richard was growing up, Don’tthink of the problem, think of the solution. The solution he needed toconcentrate on, now, was how to find Kahlan before it was too late. He wished hehad Zedd’s help to find the solution to where she was.“You aren’t out of serious danger yet,” Nicci insisted as she dodged drips ofrainwater trickling through holes in the roof. “Pushing yourself too hard couldbe fatal.”“I understand—I really do.” Richard checked the knife he wore at his belt andthen slipped it back into its sheath. “I don’t intend to ignore your advice.I’ll take it as easy as I can.”“Richard, listen to me,” Nicci said, rubbing her fingers against her temple asif her head was aching, “it’s more than that alone.”She paused to run her hand back over her hair as she searched for the words.“You aren’t invincible. You may carry that sword, but it can’t always protectyou. Your ancestors, every Lord Rahl before you, despite their mastery of thegift, still kept bodyguards close at hand. You may have been born with the giftbut even if you were competent in its use such power is no assurance ofprotection—especially not now.“That arrow only served to show how vulnerable you really are. You may be animportant man, Richard, but you are just a man. We all need you. We all sodesperately need you.”Richard looked away from the anguish in Nicci’s blue eyes. He knew very well howvulnerable he was. Life was his highest value; he didn’t take it for granted. Healmost never objected to Cara being close at hand. She and the rest of theMord-Sith as well as other bodyguards he seemed to have inherited had proventheir worth more than once. But that didn’t mean that he was helpless or that hecould allow caution to prevent him from doing what was necessary.More than that, though, he grasped Nicci’s larger meaning. He had learned whileat the Palace of the Prophets that the Sisters of the Light believed that he wasdeeply enmeshed in ancient prophecy—that he was a central figure around whomevents revolved.According to the Sisters, if their side was to prevail over the dark forcesarrayed against them, it would only be if Richard led them to victory. Prophecysaid that without him all would be lost. Their prelate, Annalina, had spent agreat deal of her life manipulating events to make sure that he survived to growup and lead them in this war. Ann’s hopes for everything they held dear, to hearher tell it, rested on his shoulders. At least Kahlan had thankfully taken thefire out of Ann in that regard. He knew, though, that many others still held thesame view. He knew, too, that his leadership had galvanized a great many peoplewho longed to simply live free.Richard had been down in the vaults at the Palace of the Prophets and had seensome of the most important and well-guarded books of prophecy in existence. Hehad to admit that some of it was pretty uncanny. Nevertheless, his experiencehad been that prophecy seemed to say whatever it was people wanted it to say.He had personal experience with prophecy involving Kahlan and himself,especially those prophecies of Shota, the witch woman. As far as he wasconcerned, prophecy had proven itself to be of little value and great trouble.Richard forced a smile. “Nicci, you’re sounding like a Sister of the Light.” Shedidn’t look to be amused. “Cara will be with me,” he said, trying to ease hermind.He realized, after he’d said it, that having Cara with him hadn’t stopped thearrow that had taken him down. Come to think of it, where had she been duringthe battle? He didn’t remember her being there with him. Cara didn’t fear afight; a team of horses couldn’t drag her away from protecting him. Surely, shemust have been close beside him, but he just didn’t recall seeing her.He picked up his big leather over-belt and fastened it around his waist. He hadgotten the belt and other parts of the outfit, which had once belonged to agreat wizard, from the Wizard’s Keep, where Zedd now stood guard, protecting theKeep from Emperor Jagang and his horde from the Old World.Nicci heaved an impatient sigh—a glimpse of a stern and implacable side of herthat Richard knew all too well. He knew, though, that this time it was poweredby sincere concern for his well-being.“Richard, we simply can’t afford this distraction. There are important things weneed to talk about. That’s why I was coming to you in the first place. Didn’tyou get the letter I sent?”Richard paused. Letter… letter… “Yes,” he said, at last remembering. “I did getyour letter. I sent word to you—with a soldier Kahlan had touched with herpower.”Richard caught Cara’s brief glance up at Nicci—a surprised look that said thatshe didn’t recall any such thing.Nicci appraised him with an unreadable look. “The word you sent never found me.”Somewhat surprised, Richard gestured toward the New World. “His primary missionwas to go north and assassinate Emperor Jagang. He was touched by a Confessor’spower; he would die before ever abandoning her command. If he couldn’t find you,he would have gone after Jagang. I suppose it’s also possible that somethinghappened to him first. There are perils enough in the Old World.”The look on Nicci’s face made him feel like he had just offered her furtherevidence that he was losing his mind. “Do you honestly think, even in yourwildest imaginings, that the dream walker can be so easily eliminated?”“No, of course not.” He pushed the bulge of a cooking pot in his pack back intoplace. “We expected that the soldier would probably be killed in the attempt. Wesent him after Jagang because he was a murdering thug and deserved to die. But Ialso thought that there was a possibility that he might succeed. Even if hedidn’t, I wanted Jagang to at least lose some sleep knowing that any of his mencould be assassins.”He could see by Nicci’s too-calm expression that she thought that this, too, wasno more than part of his elaborate delusion about a woman he had dreamed.Richard recalled, then, what else had happened. “Nicci, I’m afraid that shortlyafter Sabar delivered your letter we were attacked. He died in that fight.”A furtive glance to Cara brought a nod in confirmation.“Dear spirits,” Nicci said in sorrow at hearing the news about young Sabar.Richard shared her sentiment.He remembered Nicci’s urgent warning in the letter about how Jagang had startedto create weapons out of gifted people, as had been done three thousand yearsbefore in the great war. It was a frightening development that had been thoughtimpossible, but Jagang had discovered a way to accomplish the task by using theSisters of the Dark he held captive.During the attack on their camp, Nicci’s letter had been knocked into the fire.Richard hadn’t had the chance to read the whole letter before it had beendestroyed. He’d read enough, though, to understand the danger.When he made for the table, where his sword lay, Nicci stepped in front of him.“Richard, I know it’s hard, but you have to put this dream business behind you.We don’t have time for it. We need to talk. If you got my letter, then at leastyou know that you can’t—”“Nicci,” Richard said, silencing her, “I must do this.” He laid a hand on hershoulder and spoke as patiently as he could, considering his sense of urgency,but by his tone let her know that he was not going to discuss it further. “Ifyou come with us then we can talk later, when there is time and it doesn’tinterfere with what I need to do, but right now I don’t have the time andneither does Kahlan.”Pressing the back of his hand against the side of her shoulder, Richard movedher aside and strode to the table.As he lifted his sword by its polished scabbard, he briefly wondered why, whenhe had heard the wolf howl and he woke up, he’d thought the sword had been lyingon the ground beside him. Maybe he had remembered a fragment of a dream.Impatient to get going, he dismissed it.He slipped the ancient tooled-leather baldric over his head and quickly adjustedthe scabbard at his left hip, making sure it was securely fastened. With twofingers he lifted the sword by the downswept crossguard, not only to be surethat it was clear in its sheath, but to check that the blade was sound. Hecouldn’t remember everything that had happened in the fight and he didn’t recallputting the sword away himself.The polished steel gleamed through a film of dried blood.Fragmented memories of the battle flashed through his mind. It had been suddenand unexpected, but once he had pulled the sword free in anger, unexpected nolonger mattered. Being so heavily outnumbered, though, had mattered. Heunderstood all too well that Nicci was right about him not being invincible.Not long after he’d met Kahlan, Zedd, in his capacity as First Wizard, had namedRichard to the post of Seeker and had given him the sword. Richard had hated theweapon because of what he mistakenly thought it represented. Zedd told him thatthe Sword of Truth—as it was named—was but a tool and that it was the intent ofthe individual wielding a sword that gave it meaning. That had never been sotrue as it was with this particular weapon.The sword was now bonded to Richard, bonded to his intent, driven by hispurpose. From the beginning, his intent and purpose had been to protect those heloved and cared about. To do that, he had come to realize that he had to helpshape a world in which they could live in safety and peace.It was that intent that gave the sword meaning for him.The steel hissed as he slid it back into its scabbard.His intent now was to find Kahlan. If the sword could help him accomplish thatgoal then he would not hesitate to put it to use.He hoisted his pack and swung it around, settling it onto its familiar place onhis back as he scanned the nearly barren room for any of his things he mighthave missed. On the floor beside the hearth he saw dried meat and travelbiscuits. Beside them lay other bundled foodstuffs. Richard’s and Cara’s simplewooden bowls were there as well, one with broth and the other holding theremnants of porridge.“Cara,” he said as he swept up three waterskins and hung their straps around hisneck, “be sure to get all the food that can travel and bring it along. Don’tforget the bowls.”Cara nodded. She packed methodically, now that she realized he had no intentionof leaving her behind.Nicci caught his sleeve. “Richard, I mean it, we have to talk. It’s important.”“Then do as I asked; get your things and come with me.” He snatched up his bowand quiver. “You can talk all you want as long as you don’t hold me up.”With a nod of resignation, Nicci finally abandoned her arguments and rushed tothe back room to gather her own things. Far from minding having Nicci along,Richard wanted her help; her gift might be useful in finding Kahlan. In fact,finding Nicci so she could help him had been his intention when he first awokebefore the attack and realized that Kahlan was missing.Richard threw his hooded forest cloak around his shoulders and headed for thedoor. Cara looked up from beside the hearth, where she hurried to finishcollecting her gear, and gave him a nod to let him know she’d be right behindhim. He could see Nicci in the back room rushing to get her things before he gotfar.In his urgent need to find Kahlan, Richard’s imagination was beginning to getthe better of him. He could see her hurt, see her in pain. The thought of Kahlansomewhere alone and in trouble made his heart quicken with dread.Against his will, the crushing memory of the time she had been beaten nearly todeath flooded forth. He had given up everything else and had taken her far awayback into the mountains where no one could find them so that she would be safeand could have time to heal. That summer, after she had started to recover herstrength, and before Nicci had shown up to capture him and take him away, hadbeen one of the best summers of his life. How Cara could forget that specialtime was incomprehensible to him.From force of habit, he lifted his sword to make sure it was clear in itsscabbard before he threw open the simple plank door.Damp air and iron gray morning light greeted him. Water collected by the roofdripped from the eaves, splashing back against his boots. Cold drizzle prickledagainst his face. At least it was no longer pouring rain. Clouds hung low andthick, hiding the tops of oaks walling off the far side of the small pasture,where trailers of mist drifted like phantoms above the glistening grass. Massivegnarled trunks sheltered dark shadows.Richard was angry and frustrated that it had to rain now, of all times. If ithadn’t rained, his chances would have been far better. Still, it would not beimpossible. There were always signs.There would still be tracks.The rain would make it harder to read them, but even this much rain would noterase all trace of the tracks. Richard had grown up tracking animals and peoplethrough the woods. He could follow tracks in the rain. It was more difficult andmore time-consuming, and it required intense concentration, but he couldcertainly do it.And then it hit him.When he found Kahlan’s tracks, then he would have proof that she was real. Nicciand Cara would at last have no choice but to believe him.Everyone left unique tracks. He knew Kahlan’s. He also knew the route they’dcome in by. Along with his and Cara’s tracks, Kahlan’s tracks would also bethere for all to see. A sense of hope, if not relief, surged up through him.Once he found a set of readable prints and showed them to Nicci and Cara, therewould be no more arguing. They would realize that it wasn’t a dream and thatthere really was something seriously wrong.Then he could start following Kahlan’s tracks out of their camp and find her.The rain would slow that effort but it wouldn’t stop him, and there might be away for Nicci’s ability to help speed that search.Men milling about outside saw him stepping out of the small house and rushed infrom all around. These men were not soldiers, in the strict sense. They werewagon drivers, millers, carpenters, stonemasons, farmers, and merchants who hadstruggled their whole life under the repressive rule of the Order, trying to ekeout a living and support their families.For most of these working people, life in the Old World meant living in constantfear. Anyone who dared to speak out against the ways of the Order was swiftlyarrested, charged with sedition, and executed. There was a steady stream ofcharges and arrests, whether true or not. Such swift “justice” kept people infear and in line.Continual indoctrination, especially of the young, produced a significantsegment of the population who fanatically believed in the ways of the Order.From birth, children were taught that thinking for themselves was wrong and thatfervent faith in selfless sacrifice for the greater good was the only means toan afterlife of glory in the Creator’s light, and the only way to avoid aneternity in the dark depths of the underworld in the merciless hands of theKeeper. Any other way of thinking was evil.The properly devout were only too eager to see things remain as they were. Thepromise of riches to be shared with the common people kept the ever-pioussupporters of the Order perpetually waiting for their quota of the blood ofothers, waiting to share in the loot of the wicked, who, they were taught, weretheir selfish oppressors and therefore sinners who deserved their fate.From the ranks of the righteous came a flood of young men volunteering into thearmy, eager to be part of the noble struggle to crush the nonbelievers, topunish the wicked, to confiscate ill-gotten gains. The sanction of the plunder,the free rein of brutality, and the widespread rape of the unconverted bred aparticularly vicious, and virulent, kind of zealotry. It had spawned an army ofsavages.Such was the nature of the Imperial Order soldiers who had poured into the NewWorld and now rampaged nearly unchecked across Richard and Kahlan’s homeland.The world stood at the brink of a very dark age.It was this very threat that Ann believed Richard had been born to fight. Sheand many others believed it was foretold that if free people were to have achance to survive this great battle, have a chance to triumph, it would only beif Richard led them.These men before him saw through the empty ideas and corrupt promises of theOrder, saw it for what it was: tyranny. They had decided to take back theirlives. That made them warriors in the struggle for freedom.A surprised upwelling of shouted greetings and cries of delight broke theearly-morning stillness. As they gathered in close, the men all talked at once,asking if he was well and how he felt. Their sincere concern touched him.Despite his sense of urgency, Richard forced himself to smile and clasp armswith men he knew from the city of Altur’Rang. This was more the kind of reunionthey had been hoping for.Besides having worked beside many of these men and having become acquainted withothers, Richard knew that he was also a symbol of liberty to them—the Lord Rahlfrom the New World, the Lord Rahl from a land where men were free. He had shownthem that such things were possible for them, too, and given them a vision ofthe way their lives could be.To his own mind, Richard saw himself as the same woods guide he had alwaysbeen—even if he had been named the Seeker and now led the D’Haran Empire. Whilehe had gone through many trying times since leaving home, he was really the sameperson with the same beliefs. Where he had once stood up to bullies, he now hadto face armies. While the scale was different, the principles were the same.But right then, all he cared about was finding Kahlan. Without her, the rest ofthe world—life itself—didn’t seem very important to him.Not far off, leaning against a post, stood a brawny man wearing not a smile buta menacing glare that had set permanent creases in his brow. The man folded hispowerful arms across his chest as he watched the rest of the men greetingRichard.Richard hurried through the crowd of men, clasping hands as he went, toward thescowling blacksmith. “Victor!”The scowl gave way to a helpless grin. The man gripped arms with Richard. “Nicciand Cara would only let me go in to see you twice. If they didn’t let me see youthis morning, I was going to wrap iron bars around their necks.”“Was that you—the first morning? You passed me on your way out and touched myshoulder?”Victor grinned as he nodded. “It was. I helped carry you back here.” He put apowerful hand on Richard’s shoulder and gave him an experimental shake. “Youlook well mended even if a little pale. I have lard—it will give you strength.”“I’m fine. Maybe later. Thanks for helping bring me in here. Listen, Victor,have you seen Kahlan?”Victor’s brow bunched back up with deep creases. “Kahlan?”“My wife.”Victor stared without reaction. His hair was cropped so close that his headalmost appeared shaved. The rain beaded on his scalp. One brow arched.“Richard, since you have been gone you took a wife?”Richard anxiously looked over his shoulder to the other men watching him. “Haveany of you seen Kahlan?”He was greeted with blank expressions from many. Others shared a puzzled lookwith one another. The gray morning had fallen silent. They didn’t know who hewas talking about. Many of these men knew Kahlan and should have remembered her.Now they were shaking their heads or shrugging their regrets.Richard’s mood sank; the problem was worse than he thought. He had thought thatmaybe it was only something that had happened to Nicci and Cara’s memory.He turned back to the master blacksmith’s frown. “Victor, I have trouble and Idon’t have time to explain. I don’t even know how I would explain. I need help.”“What can I do?”“Take me to the place where we had the fight.”Victor nodded. “Easy enough.”The man turned and started out toward the dark woods."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4With two fingers, Nicci pushed a wet balsam bough out of her way as she followedseveral of the men through the dense woods. At the edge of a thickly forestedridge they headed down a trail that switched back and forth in order tonegotiate the steep descent. Slippery rocks made the climb down treacherous. Itwas a shorter route than the one they had used to carry Richard back to thedeserted farmhouse after he’d been hurt. At the bottom they picked their wayover exposed fractured rock and boulders, skirting the fringe of a boggy areaguarded by a towering cluster of silvered skeletons of cedars standing vigil inthe stagnant water.Runnels pouring down mossy banks carved deep cuts through the forest loam toexpose speckled granite beneath. Several days of steady rain had left standingponds in a number of low places. For the most part the rain filled the woodswith the pleasing fragrance of damp soil, but in low places and crannies thedamp, decomposing vegetation smelled of rot.Even though she was warm from the short, arduous trek, the damp, cool air stillleft Nicci’s fingers and ears numb with cold. She knew that this far south inthe Old World the heat and humidity would soon return with such vengeance thatit would make her long for the unusual spell of cool weather.Having grown up in a city, Nicci had spent little time outdoors. At the Palaceof the Prophets, where she had lived most of her life, outdoors meant themanicured lawns and gardens of the grounds covering Halsband Island. Thecountryside had always seemed vaguely hostile to her, an obstacle between onecity and another, something to be avoided. Cities and buildings were a refugefrom the inscrutable dangers of the wilderness.More than that, though, cities had been where she toiled for the betterment ofmankind. That work had had no end. Forests and fields had not been any of herconcern.Nicci had never appreciated the beauty of hills, trees, streams, lakes, andmountains until she had come to know Richard. Even cities were new to her eyesafter Richard. Richard made all of life a wonder.Carefully making her way up the slippery, dark rock of a brief rise, she finallyspotted the rest of the men quietly waiting under the outstretched limbs of anancient maple. Farther away, Richard crouched, studying a patch of ground. Hefinally rose to stare off into the dark expanse of woods beyond. Cara, hisever-present shadow, waited near him. Under the dense vault of soothing green,the Mord-Sith’s red leather outfit stood out like a clot of blood on atablecloth at tea.Nicci understood Cara’s fierce and passionate protection of Richard. Cara, too,had once been his enemy. Richard had not simply gained Cara’s blind allegianceby virtue of becoming the Lord Rahl; he had, far more importantly, earned herrespect, trust, and loyalty. Her red leather outfit was intimidating by design,a promise of violence should anyone even think of causing him harm. It was notan empty promise. Mord-Sith had been trained since they were young to beabsolutely ruthless. While their primary purpose had been to capture the giftedand use their power against them, they were perfectly capable of using theirability against any opposition. Men who knew and trusted Cara, without realizingthey were doing it, kept more distance from her when she wore her red leather.Nicci knew how it felt for Cara to be brought back from the numb madness ofmindless duty, to come to again value life.Off in the distance, through the gloom and shadows and dripping leaves, thehoarse croak of ravens echoed through the forest. Nicci caught the sickeningstench of rotting carrion. Looking around for landmarks as Richard had taughther, she spotted, at the base of a rocky outcropping, a pine that she rememberedbecause it had a secondary trunk that curved out low to the ground almost like aseat. She recognized the spot; beyond the screen of vines and brush lay thescene of the battle.Before Nicci could get to Richard, he ducked under low-hanging branches andstarted into the underbrush. Rising up on the far side, he waved his arms overhis head and yelled like a lunatic. The deep shade among towering spruce eruptedwith the flapping of wings as, all at once, hundreds of the huge black birdsbounded into the air, shrieking with indignation at having their feastinterrupted. At first it looked as if the birds might contest the field ofbattle, but when the air sang with the unique sound of Richard’s sword beingdrawn, they fled into the darkness back among the trees almost as if they knewwhat a weapon was and feared this one in particular. Their deep, angry croakingreceded into the hazy mist. Richard, the triumphant scarecrow, glowered afterthem for a time before sliding his sword back into its scabbard.He finally turned to the men. “All of you, please stay out of this area fornow.” His voice echoed off through the tall pines. “Just wait back there.”Considering herself sovereign in matters of Richard’s safety, Cara paid no heedto his request. Instead, she followed him as he made his way into the smallclearing beyond, staying close but out of his way. Nicci wove her way among thesaplings and wet ferns, moving past silent men, until she reached a thin patchof white birch topping a hillock that edged one side of the clearing. Hundredsof black eyes set in the white bark watched as she made her way among them tofinally halt at the brow of the bank. When she rested her hand on the peelingpapery bark of one, she noticed the bolt from a crossbow stuck in the tree.Arrows jutted from other trees as well.Beyond, dead soldiers lay sprawled everywhere. The stench staggered her. Theravens had been driven off, but the flies, fearing no sword, remained to feastand breed. The first hatch of blowfly maggots were already hard at work.A good number of men were headless or were missing limbs. Some lay partlysubmerged in the stagnant pools of water. The ravens, along with other animals,had been at many of them, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by gapingwounds. The thick leather armor, heavy hides, studded belts, chain mail, andwicked assortment of weapons no longer did these men any good. Here and therethe clothes around bloated bodies strained to remain buttoned, as if trying tomaintain dignity where there could be none.Everything—from the men’s flesh and bone to their fanatical beliefs—would liehere and rot in this forgotten patch of forest.Waiting in the trees, Nicci watched as Richard briefly inspected the corpses.That first morning he’d already killed a great many of the soldiers beforeVictor and his men arrived and charged in to help him. She didn’t know how longRichard had been fighting with that arrow in his chest, but it wasn’t the kindof injury that anyone could endure for long.Huddled back under the partial shelter of the huge maple, the nearly two dozenmen pulled cloaks tight against the chill and settled in to wait.Everywhere in the hushed forest, boughs of pine and spruce hung heavy and wet,quietly dripping water to the sodden ground. Here and there the droopingbranches of maple, oak, and elm lifted whenever a breath of breeze relieved themof their heavy load of water, making it appear as if the trees were gentlywaving. The humid air dampened what the drizzle didn’t reach, making everyonemiserable.Beyond the standing water, Richard crouched again, studying the ground. Niccicouldn’t imagine what he was looking for.None of the men waiting back under the tree appeared at all interested inrevisiting the site of the pitched battle or seeing the dead. They were contentto wait back where they were. Killing was unnatural and difficult for these men.They fought for what was right and they did what they had to do, but they didn’trelish it. That in itself spoke to their values. They had buried three of theirown dead, but they had not buried the bodies of close to a hundred soldiers whowould have eagerly killed them had Richard not intervened.Nicci remembered her surprise, the morning of the battle, coming upon Richardamong all the dead and not at first understanding what had felled so many ofthem. Then she’d seen Richard slipping among those brutes, his sword moving withthe fluid grace of a dance. It had been spellbinding to watch. With every thrustor slice, a man died. There had been a thick swarm of the soldiers—manybewildered by seeing so many of their fellows crashing to the ground. Most hadbeen burly young men who always dominated because of their muscle—the type whoenjoyed intimidating people. The soldiers moved in jerks and fits, chopping andlurching at Richard, but they always seemed to strike just after he had alreadygone. His flowing movement didn’t fit the blundering attack they were lookingfor. They began to fear that the spirits themselves had set upon them. In a way,perhaps they had.Still, their numbers were too great for one man, even if that one man wasRichard and he wielded the Sword of Truth. Just one of those ignorant,lumbering, brawny men connecting with a lucky swing of his axe would be all ittook. Or one arrow finding its mark. Richard was neither invincible norimmortal.Victor and the rest of his men had arrived just in time—a few moments beforeNicci, too, made it to the scene. Victor’s men had flown into the fray, drawingthe attention away from Richard. Once Nicci arrived, she had ended it in ablinding flash as she unleashed her power against the soldiers still standing.Fearful of being exposed not only to the impending storm but, far moretroubling, to potentially untold numbers of enemy soldiers who could appear onthe scene at any moment, Nicci had instructed the men to carry Richard backthrough the woods to the secluded farmhouse. The most she had been able to dofor him on that terrible race to cover had been to trickle a thread of her Haninto him, hoping it would help keep him alive until she was able to do more.Nicci swallowed back the anguish of the ghastly memory.From a distance, she watched as Richard continued his meticulous inspection ofthe scene of the battle, ignoring the fallen soldiers, for the most part, andpaying particular attention to the surrounding area. She couldn’t imagine whathe hoped to discover. As he searched, he had begun moving in a back-and-forthpattern, progressing steadily outward from the small clearing, circling thescene in ever-widening arcs. At times he inched along the ground on all fours.By late in the morning Richard had vanished into the woods.Victor finally tired of the silent vigil and marched through a bed of fernsnodding under the gentle fall of rain to where Nicci waited.“What’s going on?” he asked her in a low voice.“He’s looking for something.”“I can see that. I mean what’s going on with this business about a wife?”Nicci let out a tired sigh. “I don’t know.”“But you have an idea.”Nicci spotted Richard, briefly, moving among the trees some distance away. “Hewas seriously wounded. People in that state sometimes suffer delirium.”“But he’s healed, now. He doesn’t look or act feverish. He sounds normal enoughin everything else, not like a person suffering visions and such. I’ve neverseen Richard behave like this.”“Nor have I,” Nicci admitted. She knew that Victor would never voice to her suchconcerns about Richard unless he was deeply worried. “I would suggest we try tobe as understanding as possible of what he’s gone through and see if he doesn’tsoon start to get his thoughts sorted out. He was unconscious for days. He’sonly been awake for a few hours. Let’s give him some time to clear his head.”Victor considered her words before finally sighing and giving his nod ofagreement. She was relieved that he didn’t ask what they would do if Richarddidn’t soon get over his delirium.She saw Richard, then, returning through the shadows and drizzle. Nicci andVictor crossed the field of battle to meet him. On the surface his face seemedto show only stony intensity, but, as well as she knew him, Nicci could read inhis expression that something was seriously wrong.Richard brushed leaves, moss, and twigs from the knees of his trousers as hefinally reached them. “Victor, these soldiers weren’t coming to take backAltur’Rang.”Victor’s eyebrows went up. “They weren’t?”“No. They would need thousands of men for such a task—maybe tens of thousands.This many soldiers certainly weren’t going to accomplish any such thing. Andbesides, if that was their intent, then what would be the point to sloggingthrough the bush this far away from Altur’Rang?”Victor made a sour face in admission that it had to be that Richard was right.“Then what do you think they were doing?”“It wasn’t yet dawn when they were out here moving through the woods. Thatsuggests to me that they might have been reconnoitering.” Richard gestured offthrough the woods. “There’s a road in that direction. We’d been using it totravel up from the south. I had thought we would be camped far enough off it forthe night to avoid trouble. Obviously, I was wrong.”“We last heard that you were to the south,” Victor said. “The road makes forquicker traveling, so we were using the trails to cut cross-country so we couldcatch the road and take it south.”“It’s an important road,” Nicci added. “It’s one of the main arteries—one of thefirst—that Jagang built. It allowed him to move soldiers swiftly. The roads hebuilt enabled him to subdue all of the Old World under the rule of the ImperialOrder.”Richard gazed off in the direction of the road, almost as if he could seethrough the wall of trees and vines. “Such a well-made road also allows him tomove supplies. I think that’s what was happening here. Being this close toAltur’Rang, and being well aware of the revolt that had taken place there, theywere probably concerned about the possibility of an attack as they passedthrough the area. Since these soldiers weren’t massing for an attack onAltur’Rang, I’d guess they had something more important going on: watching oversupplies moving north for Jagang’s army. He needs to crush the last of theresistance in the New World before the revolution at home burns his tail.”Richard’s gaze returned to Victor. “I think these soldiers werereconnoitering—clearing the countryside in advance of a supply convoy. They weremost likely scouting in the predawn in the hopes of catching any insurgentsasleep.”“As we were.” Victor folded his muscular arms in obvious discontent. “We neverexpected there would be any soldiers out here in these woods. We were sleepinglike babies. If you hadn’t been here and intercepted them, they would have soonsnuck up on us where we slept. Then we’d likely be the ones feeding the fliesand ravens, instead of them.”Everyone fell silent as they considered the might-have-been.“Have you been hearing any news of supplies moving north?” Richard asked.“Sure,” Victor said. “There’s a lot of talk about large quantities of goodsgoing north. Some convoys are accompanied by new troops being sent to the war.What you say about these men scouting for such a convoy makes sense.”Richard squatted down and pointed. “See these tracks? These are a little morerecent than the battle. It was a large contingent—most likely more soldiers whocame looking for these dead men. This was as far as they came. These side ridgesin the prints show where they turned around, here. It looks like they came in,spotted the dead soldiers, and left. You can see by their tracks as they leftthat they were in a hurry.”Richard stood and rested his left hand on the pommel of his sword. “Had you nottaken me away right after the battle, these soldiers would have been on us.Fortunately they went back rather than search the woods.”“Why do you suppose that they would do that?” Victor asked. “Why would they seethese men freshly killed and then leave?”“They probably feared that a large force was lying in wait, so they rushed backto raise an alarm and insure that the supply column was well protected. Sincethey didn’t even take the time to bury their fellow soldiers, I’d guess thattheir most urgent concern was getting their convoy out of the area.”Victor scowled at the tracks and then back in the direction of the deadsoldiers. “Well,” he said as he ran his hand back over his head, wiping awaybeads of water, “at least we can take advantage of the situation. While Jagangis preoccupied with the war that gives us time down here to work to knocksupport for the Order’s rule right out from under them.”Richard shook his head. “Jagang may be preoccupied with the war, but that won’tstop him from moving to restore his authority back here. If there’s one thingwe’ve learned about the dream walker, it’s that he’s methodical aboutannihilating any and all opposition.”“Richard is right,” Nicci said. “It’s a dangerous error to dismiss Jagang as amere brute. While he is indeed brutal, he is also a highly intelligentindividual and a brilliant tactician. He’s had a lot of experience over theyears. It’s nearly impossible to goad him into acting impulsively. He can bebold—when he has good reason to believe boldness will win the day—but he’s moregiven to calculated campaigns. He acts out of firm convictions, not bruisedpride. He’s content to let you think you’ve won—to let you think whatever youwant, for that matter—while he methodically plans how he will gut you. Hispatience is his most deadly quality.“When he attacks, he is indifferent to how many casualties his army takes, aslong as he knows he will have more than enough men left to win. But over thecourse of his career—until his campaign to take the New World, anyway—he’stended to experience far fewer casualties than his enemies. That’s because heholds no favor with naive notions of classic battle, of troops clashing on afield of honor. His way is usually to attack with such overwhelming numbers asto grind to dust the bones of his opposition.“What his horde does to the vanquished is legend. For those in their path, theterror of the wait is unbearable. No sane person would want to be left alive tobe captured by Jagang’s men.“For that reason, many welcome him with open arms, with blessings for theirliberation, with supplications to be allowed to convert and join the Order.”The only sound under the embracing shelter of the trees was the gentle patter ofthe light rain. Victor did not doubt her word; she had been witness to suchevents.At times, the knowledge that she had been a part of that perverted cause, thatshe had been a party to irrational beliefs that reduced men to nothing more thansavages, made Nicci long for death. Certainly she deserved no less. But she wasnow in the unique position of having the opportunity and ability to help reversethe success of the Order. Setting matters right had become the cause that nowdrove her, sustained her, gave her purpose.“It’s only a matter of time before Jagang moves to retake Altur’Rang,” Richardsaid into the silence.Victor nodded. “Yes, if Jagang thought the revolution was confined to Altur’Rangthen he would logically put all his efforts into taking back the city and beingas ruthless about it as Nicci says, but we’re making sure that doesn’t happen.”He showed Richard a grim smile. “We’re lighting fires in cities and townswherever we can, wherever people are ready to cast off their chains. We’repumping the bellows and spreading the flames of rebellion and freedom far andwide so that Jagang can’t confine and crush it.”“Don’t fool yourself,” Richard said. “Altur’Rang is his home city. It’s wherethe revolt against the Order began. A popular uprising in the very city whereJagang was building his grand palace undermines everything the Imperial Orderteaches. It was to be the city, the palace, from where Jagang and the highpriests of the Fellowship of Order were for all time to rule over mankind in thename of the Creator. The people destroyed that palace and instead embracedfreedom.“Jagang will not allow such subversion of his authority to stand. He must crushthe rebellion there if the Order is to survive to rule the Old World—and theNew. It will be a matter of principled belief for him; he considers oppositionto the ways of the Fellowship of Order to be blasphemy against the Creator. Hewill not be shy about throwing his most brutal and experienced soldiers into thetask. He will want to make a bloody example of you. I’d expect such an attacksooner rather than later.”Victor looked unsettled but not entirely surprised.“And don’t forget,” Nicci added, “the Brothers of the Fellowship of Order whoescaped will be among those working to help to reestablish the Order’sauthority. Such gifted men are no ordinary foe. We’ve hardly begun to root themout.”“All true enough, but you can’t work iron to your will until you get it good andhot.” Victor tightened a defiant fist before them. “At least we’ve begun to dowhat must be done.”Nicci conceded that much with a nod and a small smile to soften the dark pictureshe had helped paint. She knew that Victor was right, that the task had to beginsomewhere and at some point. He had already helped ring the hammer of freedomfor a people who had all but given up hope. She just didn’t want him to losesight of the reality of the difficulty that lay ahead.Nicci would have been relieved to hear Richard dealing logically with theimportant matters at hand, but she knew better. When Richard locked on tosomething vital to him, he might address peripheral issues when necessary but itwould be a grave mistake to think that it diminished in the least his focus onhis objective. In fact, he had delivered his warnings to Victor in swiftsummary—a mere matter to be gotten out of the way. She could see in his eyesthat he was preoccupied with matters of far more importance to him.Richard finally turned his riveting gray eyes on Nicci.“You weren’t with Victor and his men?”In a sudden flash of comprehension, Nicci realized why the matter of thesoldiers and their supply convoy was important to him: It was a mere element ofa greater equation. He was trying to unravel how and if the convoy figured intothe illusion he still clung to. It was that calculation he was working toresolve.“No,” Nicci said. “We’d had no word and didn’t know what had happened to you. Inmy absence, Victor left to begin searching for you. Not long after, I returnedto Altur’Rang. I found out where Victor had gone and set out to join him. I wasstill some distance behind at the end of my second day of travel, so the thirdday I started out before dawn, hoping to catch up with him. I’d been travelingfor almost two hours when I arrived nearby and heard the battle. I reached thefighting right at the end.”Richard nodded thoughtfully. “I woke and Kahlan was gone. Since we were close toAltur’Rang, my first thought was that if I could find you, then maybe you couldhelp me find Kahlan. That’s when I heard the soldiers coming through the woods.”Richard gestured up a rise. “I heard them coming through those trees, there. Ihad darkness on my side. They hadn’t seen me yet, so I was able to surprisethem.”“Why didn’t you hide?” Victor asked.“More were coming down from that way, and others were coming in from thatdirection. I didn’t know how many there were, but the way they were fanned outsuggested to me that they were searching the woods. That made hiding risky. Aslong as there was any possibility that Kahlan might be close and maybe hurt, Icouldn’t run. If I hid and waited until the soldiers had a chance to find methen I would lose the element of surprise. Worse yet, dawn was approaching.Darkness and surprise worked to my advantage. With Kahlan missing I didn’t havea moment to lose. If they had her, I had to stop them.”No one commented.Richard turned to Cara, next. “And where were you?”Cara blinked in surprise. She had to think a moment before she could answer. “I…I’m not exactly sure.”Richard frowned. “You’re not sure? What do you remember?”“I was on watch. I was checking some distance out from our camp. I guesssomething must have aroused my concern and so I was making sure the area wasclear. I caught a whiff of smoke and was starting to investigate that when Iheard battle cries.”“So you rushed back?”Cara idly pulled her braid forward over her shoulder. She looked to be havingdifficulty remembering clearly. “No…” She frowned in recollection. “No, I knewwhat was happening—that you were being attacked—because I heard the clash ofsteel and men dying. I had only just realized that it was Victor and his mencamped off in that direction, that it was the smoke from their campfire Ismelled. I knew that I was much closer to them than you, so I thought that thesmartest thing to do would be to rouse them and bring their help with me.”“That makes sense,” Richard said. He wearily wiped beads of rain from his face.“That’s right,” Victor said. “Cara was right there close when I heard the clashof steel as well. I remember because I was lying awake in the quiet.”Richard’s brow drew together. He looked up. “You were awake?”“Yes. The howl of a wolf woke me.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5With sudden intensity Richard leaned in a little toward the blacksmith. “Youheard wolves howl?”“No,” Victor said as he frowned in recollection, “there was just one.”The three of them waited in silence as Richard stared off into the distance, asif he were mentally trying to fit together the pieces of some great puzzle.Nicci glanced over her shoulder at the men back near the maple tree. Some yawnedas they waited. Some had found seats on a fallen log. A few were engaged inhushed conversation. Others, arms folded, leaned against the trunks of trees andwatched the surrounding woods as they waited.“It didn’t happen this morning,” Richard whispered to himself. “When I waswaking up this morning, when I was still half asleep, I was really rememberingwhat had happened the morning Kahlan disappeared.”“The morning of the battle,” Nicci said softly in correction.Lost in thought, Richard didn’t appear to hear her correction. “I must have beenremembering, for some reason, what happened back when I woke that morning.” Heturned suddenly and seized her arm. “A rooster crowed when I was being carriedback to the farmhouse.”Surprised by his abrupt change of subject, and not knowing what he was gettingat, Nicci shrugged. “I suppose it could have. I don’t remember. Why?”“There was no wind. I remember hearing the rooster crow and looking up andseeing motionless tree limbs above me. There was no wind at all. I remember howdead still it was.”“You’re right, Lord Rahl,” Cara said. “I remember when I ran into Victor’s campseeing the smoke from the fire going straight up because the air was dead calm.I think that was why we could hear the clash of steel and the cries from so faraway—because there wasn’t even a breath of breeze to cut the sound fromcarrying.”“If it helps,” the blacksmith said, “there were a few chickens roaming aroundwhen we brought you to the farm. And you’re right, there was a rooster and itdid crow. Matter of fact, we were trying not to be found so that Nicci couldhave the time to heal you, and I was afraid that the rooster might attractunwanted attention, so I told the men to cut its throat.”After hearing Victor’s account, Richard drifted back into thought. He tapped afinger against his lower lip as he considered yet another piece of his puzzle.Nicci thought he might have forgotten they were standing there.She leaned a little closer to him. “So?”He blinked and finally looked at her. “It had to be that when I woke today I wasreally remembering that morning—remembering for a reason. Sometimes you dothat—remember because there was some part of it that doesn’t make sense,remember for some reason.”“What reason?” Nicci asked.“The wind. There was no wind that morning. But I remember that when I woke thatmorning, in the faint light of false dawn, I saw tree limbs moving, like in abreeze.”Nicci was not just confused by his concern for wind, but worried for his stateof mind. “Richard, you were asleep and just waking up. It was dark. You probablyjust thought you saw the tree branches moving.”“Maybe” was all he said.“Maybe it was the soldiers coming,” Cara offered.“No,” he said, dismissing her suggestion with an irritable wave of his hand,“that was a little later, after I’d discovered that Kahlan was missing.”Seeing that neither Victor nor Cara was going to argue the point, Nicci decidedto hold her tongue as well. Richard seemed to put the puzzle from his mind. Heturned a deadly serious expression on the three of them.“Look, I have to show you all something. But you need to realize, despite howlittle you may be able to make out, that I know what I’m talking about. I don’texpect you to take my word, but you need to understand that I have a lifetime ofexperience in this and routinely used such ability. I trust each of you in yourarea of expertise. This is mine. Don’t close your minds to what I have to showyou.”Nicci, Cara, and Victor shared a look.With a nod to Richard, Victor set his reservations aside and turned to the men.“You boys keep your eyes open, now.” He circled a finger in the air. “Therecould be soldiers about, so let’s keep it quiet and stay alert. Ferran,double-check the area.”The men nodded. Some came to their feet, apparently glad to have something to doother than just sit there wet and cold. Four men set out through the trees toset up guard.Ferran handed his pack and bedroll to one of the other men for safekeepingbefore nocking an arrow and slipping quietly into the brush. The young man waslearning the trade of blacksmithing from Victor. Raised on a farm, he also had anatural talent for scouting unseen in the woods. He idolized Victor. Nicci knewthat Victor was fond of the young man as well, but because he was fond of him hewas probably harder on him than on the other men. Victor had told her once,referring to his tough demands of his apprentice, that you had to pound theimperfections out of iron and work it hard if you wanted to shape it intosomething truly worthwhile.Since the battle, Victor had had sentries and lookouts on constant watch whileFerran and several of the others scouted the surrounding forest. None of themhad wanted to take any chance that enemy soldiers would unexpectedly come uponthem while Nicci was trying to save Richard’s life. After she had done all shecould for Richard, Nicci had healed a nasty gash to one man’s leg and taken careof a few other less serious wounds suffered by a half-dozen other men.Since the morning of the battle and Richard being hurt, she had gotten littlesleep. She was exhausted.After watching the men set about the tasks assigned them, Victor clapped Richardon the shoulder. “Show us, then.”Richard lead Cara, Victor, and Nicci past the clearing with the dead men andthen off through the woods. He took a route between trees where the ground wasmore open. At the crest of a gentle rise, he stopped and crouched down.Seeing Richard on bended knee, his cloak draped over his back, his sword in agleaming scabbard at his hip, his hood pushed back to expose strands of wet hairlying against his muscular neck, his bow and quiver strapped over his leftshoulder, he looked at once regal—a warrior king—and at the same time likenothing so much as the wilderness guide from a distant land that he had oncebeen. With intimate familiarity, his fingers brushed the pine needles, twigs,crumbles of leaves, bark, and loam. Nicci could sense, just by that touch, hisbreadth of understanding of the seemingly simple things spread out before them,yet to him those things revealed another world.Richard remembered, then, his purpose and gestured, urging them to squat downclose beside him.“Here,” he said, pointing. “See this?” His ringers carefully traced a vaguedepression in the dense tangle of forest litter. “This is Cara’s footprint.”“Well, that’s no surprise,” Cara said. “This is the way we came in from the roadon our way to where we set up camp back there.”“That’s right.” Richard leaned out a little, pointing as he went on. “See here,and then off there? Those are more of your tracks, Cara. See how they come inhere in a line showing where you were walking?”Cara shrugged suspiciously. “Sure.”Richard moved to his right. They all followed. He again carefully traced adepression so they could make it out. Nicci couldn’t see anything at all in theforest floor until he carefully drew the outline with a finger just above theground. In doing so, he seemed to make the footprint magically appear for them.After he pointed it out, Nicci could tell what it was.“This is my track,” he said, watching it as if fearing that were he to look awayit might vanish. “The rain works to wear them down—some places more thanothers—but it hasn’t made all of them disappear.” With a finger and thumb, hecarefully lifted a wet, brown oak leaf from the center of the print. “Look, youcan see under here how the pressure of my weight under the ball of my foot brokethese small twigs. See? Rain can’t obliterate things like that.”He looked up at them to make sure they were all paying attention and thenpointed off into the shadowy mist. “You can see my tracks coming in thisdirection, toward us, just like Cara’s.” He stretched out and quickly traced twomore vague depressions in the matted forest floor to show them what he meant.“See? You can still make them out.”“What’s the point?” Victor asked.Richard glanced back over his shoulder again before gesturing between the setsof tracks. “See the distance between Cara’s tracks and mine? When we walked inhere I was on the left and Cara was to my right. See how far apart our tracksare?”“What of it?” Nicci asked as she pulled the hood of her cloak forward, trying toshield her face from the frigid drizzle. She pulled her hands back under thecloak and snuggled them in her armpits for warmth.“They’re that far apart,” Richard said, “because when we walked through hereKahlan was in the middle, between us.”Nicci stared again at the ground. She was no expert, so she wasn’t especiallysurprised that she couldn’t see any other tracks. But this time, she didn’tthink that Richard could, either.“And can you show us Kahlan’s tracks?” she asked.Richard turned a look on her of such intensity that it momentarily halted thebreath she was about to take.“That’s the point.” He held up a finger with the same deliberate care with whichhe lifted his blade. “Her tracks are gone. Not washed away by the rain, butgone… gone as if they were never there.”Victor let out a very quiet and very troubled-sounding sigh. If she was shocked,Cara hid it well. Nicci knew that he hadn’t told them all of what he had to say,so she remained guarded in her question.“You’re showing us that there are no tracks from this woman?”“That’s right. I’ve searched. I found my tracks and Cara’s tracks in variousplaces, but where Kahlan’s tracks should be there are none.”In the uncomfortable silence no one wanted to say anything. Nicci finally tookit upon herself to do so.“Richard, you have to know why that is. Don’t you see, now? It’s just yourdream. There are no tracks because this woman doesn’t exist.”With him there on his knees before her, looking up at her, it seemed she couldsee his soul laid bare in his gray eyes. She would have given nearly anything atthat moment to be able to simply comfort him. But she couldn’t do that. Niccihad to force herself to go on.“You said yourself that you know about tracking and yet even you can’t find anytracks left by this woman. This should put the matter to rest. This shouldfinally convince you that she just doesn’t exist—that she never did exist.” Shetook a hand from under her cloak, from its warm resting place, and gently laidit on his shoulder in an effort to soften her words. “You need to let it go,Richard.”He looked away from her eyes as he drew his lower lip through his teeth. “It’snot as simple a picture as you’re painting it,” he said in a calm voice. “I’masking you all to look—just look—and try to understand the significance of whatit is I’m showing you. Look at how far apart Cara and my tracks are. Can’t yousee that there was a third person there, between us, as we walked?”Nicci wearily rubbed her eyes. “Richard, people don’t always walk closetogether. Maybe you and Cara were both looking around for any sign of threat asyou walked through here, or maybe you were both just tired and not payingattention. There could be any number of simple explanations as to why you twoweren’t walking closer together.”“When only two people walk together they don’t habitually walk this far apart.”He pointed behind them. “Look at the tracks we made coming over her. Cara againwalked to my right. Look at how much closer together the tracks are. That’stypical of two people walking side by side. You and Victor were behind us. Lookat how close together your tracks are.“These tracks are different. Can’t you see by their nature that they’re this farapart because there was another person walking between us?”“Richard…”Nicci paused. She didn’t want to argue. She was tempted to keep quiet and lethim have his way, let him believe what he wanted to believe. And yet, silencewould be feeding a lie, lending life to an illusion. While she ached for hisdifficulty and wanted to be on his side, she couldn’t let him delude himself orshe would be causing him greater harm. He could never get better, never fullyrecover, until he faced the truth of the real world. Helping him see reality wasthe only way she could really help him.“Richard,” she said softly, trying to get that truth through to him withoutsounding harsh or condescending, “your tracks are there, and Cara’s tracks arethere. We can see that—you showed us. There are no others. You showed us that,too. If she was there, between you and Cara, then why are her tracks not?”They all hunched their shoulders in the wet and cold as they waited. Richardfinally gathered his composure and spoke in a clear, firm voice.“I think Kahlan’s tracks were erased with magic.”“Magic?” Cara asked, suddenly alert and ill-tempered.“Yes. I think that whoever took Kahlan erased her tracks with magic.”Nicci was dumbfounded and made no attempt to conceal it.Victor’s gaze shifted back and forth between Nicci and Richard. “Can that bedone?”“Yes,” Richard insisted. “When I first met Kahlan, Darken Rahl was after us. Hewas close on our trail. Zedd, Kahlan, and I had to run. If Darken Rahl hadcaught us we would have been finished. Zedd’s a wizard but he isn’t as powerfulas Darken Rahl was, so Zedd cast some magic dust back down the trail to hide ourtracks. That has to be what happened here. Whoever took Kahlan covered theirtracks with the use of magic.”Victor and Cara glanced at Nicci for confirmation. As a blacksmith, Victor wasnot familiar with magic. Mord-Sith didn’t like magic and pointedly avoided thedetails of its workings; their well-honed instinct was simply to violentlyeliminate anyone with magic if they posed even a potential threat to the LordRahl. Both Victor and Cara waited to hear what Nicci had to say about thepossibility of using magic to cover tracks.Nicci hesitated. Her being a sorceress didn’t mean that she knew everythingthere was to know about magic. But still…“I suppose that such a use of magic is in theory possible, but I’ve never heardof it being done.” Nicci made herself look into Richard’s expectant gaze. “Ithink the explanation of why there are no tracks is quite a bit simpler and Ithink you know it, Richard.”Richard couldn’t mask his disappointment. “Looking at this by itself, and notbeing familiar with the nature of tracks and what they reveal, I’ll grant thatmaybe it’s hard to see what I’m saying. But this isn’t all. I have somethingelse to show you that may help you see the whole picture. Come on.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said as she tucked a wet wisp of hair back under the hood ofher dark cloak and avoided looking at him, “shouldn’t we be getting on to otherimportant matters?”“I have something important to show the three of you. Are you saying that youwish to wait here while I show Victor and Nicci?”Her blue eyes turned up to him. “Of course not.”“Fine. Let’s go.”Without further protest, they followed him at a quick pace as he headed in anortherly direction, deeper into the woods. They tiptoed from rock to rock tocross a broad ravine with dark eddies of murky water flowing through it. WhenNicci nearly slipped and fell, Richard took her hand and helped her across. Hisbig hand was warm, but not feverish, at least. She wished he would slow down andnot stress his fragile health.The gentle slope on the far side revealed itself only by degree as they climbedhigher through the drizzle and trailers of low clouds. To the left loomed thedark shadow of a rocky rise. Nicci could hear the burbling rush of watertumbling down that rise.As they went deeper into the swirling gray mist and dense green vegetation, hugebirds lifted from their perches. Wings spread wide, the wary creatures silentlyglided away beyond sight. Harsh screeches of unseen animals echoed through thesomber woods. With the mass of overlapping spruce and balsam boughs and thetangled dead limbs of ancient oaks draped with gossamer moss curtains, to saynothing of the gloomy drizzle, vines, and dense tangle of saplings struggling toreach up for the elusive light, it was not easy to see very far. Only lower tothe forest floor, where the sunlight rarely reached, was it more open.Farther into the sodden forest, dark trunks of trees stood clear of the brushand thick foliage like sentinels watching the three people move among theirgathered army. The ground where Richard took them was easier traveling since itwas more open and covered with soft, sprawling mats of pine needles. Nicciimagined that even on the sunniest of days, only thin streamers of sunlight everpenetrated all the way down to the forest floor. Off to the sides here and thereshe saw nearly impenetrable tangles of brush and tightly knitted walls of youngconifers. The expanse under the towering pines made a natural but unmarkedpathway.At last Richard halted, lifting his arms out to his sides so that they wouldn’tstep out past him. Spread out before them was more of the same—sparse growthsprouting among the thick bed of brown needles. Following his direction, theysquatted down beside him.Richard gestured over his right shoulder. “Back that way is where Cara, Kahlan,and I came in on the night we camped—by where the battle took place. In variousplaces around our camp are my tracks from when I stood second watch, and Cara’stracks from third watch. Kahlan had first watch that night. There are no tracksfrom her watch.”His glance to each of them in turn was a silent request to hear him out beforethey started arguing.“Back that way,” he said, pointing as he went on, “was where the soldiers werecoming up through the woods. From over in that direction, Victor, you and yourmen came to join the battle. In nearly the same place are your tracks from whenyou carried me back to the farmhouse. Off that way, where I already showed you,are the tracks of other soldiers who came in and found their fellow soldiersdead.“None of us or any of the soldiers has been up this way.“Here, where we are now, there are no tracks. Look around. You’ll see only myfresh tracks from this morning when I was searching. Other than that, there areno footprints from anyone else coming through here—in fact, there’s no sign thatanyone has ever been here. At least, it would appear that no one has ever beenhere before.”Victor idly rubbed his thumb on the steel shaft of the mace hanging from hisbelt. “But you think otherwise?”“Yes. Even though there are no tracks, someone did come this way. And, they leftevidence.” Richard leaned out and with one finger touched a smooth rock aboutthe size of a loaf of bread. “As they hurried past, they stumbled on this rock.”Victor seemed caught up in the story. “How can you tell?”“Look carefully at the markings on the rock.” As Victor leaned in a bit, Richardpointed. “See here, the way the top of the rock, where it was exposed to the airand weather, has the pale tannish yellow discoloration of lichen and such? Andhere—like the hull of a boat below the waterline—you can see the dark brown rimethat shows where the belly of the rock had been lying beneath the ground.“But it’s not lying that way now. It’s not settled into its socket in theground, its recent resting place. It’s now lifted a little out of that socketand turned partway over. See how a section of the dark bottom is now exposed?Were it out of the ground for longer, the dark color would be worn away and thelichen would begin to grow there, too. But it hasn’t had that much time yet.This is recent.”Richard waggled his finger back and forth. “Look at the ground, here, on thisside of the rock. You can see the socket where the rock originally rested, butnow the rock has been shoved back a little, leaving a void between this side ofthe rock and the wall of the cavity. On the back side, away from us, because therock was recently disturbed, you can still see a ridge of dirt and debris thathas been pushed up.“The open socket on this side and the ridge on the far side shows that whoeverstumbled on this rock and disturbed it was moving away from our camp, goingnorth.”“But then where’s their trail?” Victor asked. “Their footprints?”Richard raked back his wet hair. “The trail has been erased with magic. Isearched; there is no trail.“Look at the rock. It’s been disturbed, kicked partway out of its resting placein the ground. But there is no scuff mark on it. While the rock wasn’t movedmuch, it was moved. A boot grazing this rock enough to move it like this wouldhave to leave a mark. Yet there is no mark, just as there are no otherfootprints.”Nicci pushed her hood back. “You’re twisting everything you find around to fitwhat you want to believe, Richard. You can’t have it both ways. If magic wasused to erase their trail, then why is it that are you able to detect theirtrail by this rock?”“Probably because the magic they used erases footprints. The person who usedthat magic must not know a great deal about tracks or tracking. I don’t thinkthey’re very familiar with the outdoors. When they used magic to erase theirfootprints, they probably never gave any thought to putting disturbed stonesback in place.”“Richard, surely—”“Look around,” he said as he swept his arm out. “Look at how perfect the forestfloor is.”“What do you mean?” Victor asked.“It’s too perfect. Twigs, leaves, bark are too evenly distributed. Nature ismore erratic.”Nicci, Victor, and Cara peered at the ground. Nicci saw only a normal-lookingforest floor. Here and there small things—pine seedlings, spindly weeds, an oaksapling with only three big leaves—sprouted up through the litter of twigs,moss, bark, and fallen leaves sprinkled over the bed of pine needles. She didn’tknow all that much about tracks or tracking, or forests, for that matter—Richardalways left blazes on trees when he wanted her to be able to find and follow histrail—but it didn’t look like anyone had been through the place, nor did it lookoverly perfect, as Richard suggested. As she looked around, it appeared the sameas other places she eyed for comparison. Victor and Cara seemed equallyconfounded.“Richard,” Nicci said with strained patience, “I’m sure there could be anynumber of explanations as to why a rock looks disturbed to you. For all I know,it could be disturbed, as you suggest. But maybe an elk or a deer kicked it asthey went by and over time their tracks have been worn away.”Richard was shaking his head. “No. Look at the socket. It’s still well formed.You can read by how much the edges have degraded that it happened only a fewdays ago. Time—especially in the rain—erodes such edges and works to fill in thegap. Any deer or elk kicking this rock would have left tracks that would be justas recent. Not only that, but a hoof would have scuffed it, the same as a boot.I’m telling you, three days ago someone stumbled on this rock.”Nicci gestured. “Well, that dead branch over there could have fallen on it anddisturbed it.”“If it did, then the lichen growing on the rock would show the scar of theimpact and the branch would show evidence that it had hit something hard. Itdoesn’t—I already looked.”Cara threw up her hands. “Maybe a squirrel jumped from a tree and landed on it.”“Not nearly heavy enough to have moved this rock,” Richard said.Nicci drew a weary breath. “So what you’re saying is that the fact that thereare no tracks from this woman, Kahlan, proves that she exists.”“No, that’s not what I’m saying, not the way you’re putting it, anyway. But itdoes confirm it if you look at everything together—if you put it all intocontext.”Nicci’s hands fisted at her sides. There were important matters that had to beaddressed. They were running out of time. Instead of dealing with urgent mattersin need of their attention, they were out in the middle of the woods looking ata rock. She could feel the blood going to her face.“That’s ridiculous. All you’ve shown us, Richard, is proof that this woman youimagined is just that—imagined. She doesn’t exist. She left no tracks—becauseyou only dreamed her! There’s nothing mysterious about it! It’s not magic! It’ssimply a dream!”Richard abruptly rose up before her. He changed in a heartbeat from a man ofcalm intensity to a figure of heart-stopping presence, power, and awakeninganger.But rather than confront her, he took a step past her, back toward the waythey’d come from, and stopped. Still and tense, Richard stared back through thewoods.“Something’s wrong,” he said in low warning.Cara’s Agiel spun up into her fist. Victor’s brow tightened as his fingers foundthe mace hanging from his belt.In the distance back through the dripping forest, Nicci heard the sudden, wildalarm cries of ravens.The cries that came next reminded her of nothing so much as the sounds of bloodymurder."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6Richard bounded back through the woods, back toward the waiting men, back towardthe screams. He raced headlong through a blur of trees, branches, brush, ferns,and vines. He leaped over rotting logs and used a well-planted boot to boundover a boulder. He dodged his way through stands of young pines and a cluster offlowering dogwood. Without slowing, he batted aside tamarack limbs and duckedunder balsam boughs. Nets of dead branches on the lower trunks of young sprucetrees snatched at his clothes as he charged past. More than once, dead limbsjutting out, spearlike, from larger trees nearly impaled him before hesidestepped at the last instant.Running at such a reckless speed through dense woods, let alone in the rain, wastreacherous. It was hard to recognize hazards in time to avoid them. Any one ofa number of protruding branches could easily gouge out an eye. One slip on wetleaves or moss or rocks could cause a skull-splitting tumble. Driving a footdown into a crevice or fissure at a dead run would likely shatter a leg. Richardhad once known a young man who had done just that. His broken leg and ankle hadnever mended right, leaving him partially crippled for life.Richard focused his concentration on his intended path, taking as much care aspossible without slowing.He dared not slow.The whole way as he ran, he heard the terrible screams and cries, the shrieks,and the sickening snapping sounds. He could also hear Cara, Victor, and Niccicrashing through the brush behind him. He didn’t wait for them to catch up.Every long stride, every leap, took him farther out ahead of them.Running as fast as he could, gasping for air, Richard was surprised to findhimself winded before he should have been. At first disconcerted, he thenremembered the reason. Nicci had said that he wasn’t yet recovered and becausehe had lost a lot of blood he would need rest to gain back his strength. He keptrunning. He would have to make do with what strength he had. It wasn’t that muchfarther.More than that, though, he kept running because the men needed help. These weremen who had come to his aid when he had been in trouble. He didn’t know what washappening, but it was clear to Richard that they were in some kind of peril.On the morning of the attack, if he’d known more about how to call upon hisgift, he might have been able to use that ability to stop the soldiers beforeVictor and his men had arrived. Had he been able to do that, three of those menwould not have died in the fighting. Of course, had Richard not been where hewas and taken action to stop the soldiers, then Victor and his men might wellhave all ended up murdered at their camp, most while they slept.Richard couldn’t help feeling that he might have done more. He didn’t want tosee any of these men hurt; he kept running with all his strength, holding backnothing. He would use whatever strength he had. He could gain back his strength.Lives could not be gotten back.There were times like this when he wished that he knew more about how to callupon his gift, but his ability regrettably worked differently than in others.Instead of functioning through cognizant direction, as Nicci’s power did,Richard’s ability worked through anger and need. The morning that the ImperialOrder soldiers had poured in all around him he had drawn his sword for thepurpose of his survival and in so doing had given his anger over to the weapon.Unlike his own gift, he knew that he could count on the power of his sword.Others with the gift learned to use their ability from a young age. Richardnever had. It had been an upbringing of peace and security that had given him achance at life, at growing up to profoundly value life. The drawback was thatsuch an upbringing had also left him unaware of and ignorant of his own talent.Now that Richard was grown, though, learning to use his latent ability wasproving more than difficult, not only because of his upbringing, but because hisparticular form of the gift was so extraordinarily rare. Neither Zedd nor theSisters of the Light had had any success at all in teaching him how toconsciously direct his power.He knew little more than what Nathan Rahl, the prophet, had told him, that hispower was most often sparked through anger and a particular, specific kind ofdesperate need, which Richard had not been able to identify or isolate. As faras he had been able to determine, the character of the need required to ignitehis power was unique to each circumstance.Richard also knew that using magic did not involve whim. No amount of wishing orstraining could ever produce results. The initiation and use of magic requiredspecific conditions; he just didn’t understand how to produce or provide thoseconditions.Even wizards of great ability sometimes had to use books to insure that they gotthe details right if the specific magic they wanted was to work. At a young age,Richard had memorized one of those books, The Book of Counted Shadows. That wasthe book which Darken Rahl had been hunting for after he had put the boxes ofOrden in play.On the morning Kahlan had vanished, to meet the threat of the seemingly endlessranks of soldiers charging in upon him, Richard had had to depend on his swordand not his own innate powers. The frenzied fighting had taken him to the brinkof exhaustion. At the same time, his worry for Kahlan left him distracted to thepoint where his mind wasn’t fully on the fight. He knew that allowing such adiversion to beguile his attention was dangerous and foolish… but it was Kahlan.He had been helplessly worried for her.Had his need not summoned his gift when it did, the hail of arrows suddenlyshowering in at him would have been fatal a few dozen times over.He hadn’t seen the bolt fired from a crossbow. As it shot for his heart, he onlyrecognized the threat at the last possible instant and, because of the crucialneed to also stop the three soldiers lunging for him at the same time, he’d onlybeen able to deflect the path of the arrow’s flight, not stop it.It seemed like he’d already gone over the memory a thousand times and come upwith any number of could-haves and should-haves that, in his mind’s harshjudgment, would have prevented what had happened. As Nicci had said, though, hewas not invincible.As he plunged through the woods, the forest unexpectedly fell silent. Theechoing screams died away. The misty green wilderness was again left to themuted whisper of the light rain falling though the leafy canopy. In theoutwardly peaceful and once again quiet world around him, it almost seemed as ifhe had only imagined the terrible sounds he’d heard.Despite his fatigue, Richard didn’t slow. As he ran, he listened for any sign ofthe men, but he could hear little more than his own labored breathing, hisheartbeat pounding in his ears, and his swift footfalls. Occasionally he alsoheard branches behind him breaking as the other three tried to catch up withhim, but they were still falling farther behind.For some reason, the eerie calm was somehow more frightening than the screamshad been. What had started out sounding like the ravens—hoarse croaks risinginto the kinds of terrified cries an animal makes only when it’s beingkilled—had, somewhere along the line, begun to sound human. And now there wasonly the menacing silence.Richard tried to convince himself that he had only imagined that the screams hadturned human. As chilling as such cries had been, it was the haunting, unnaturalstillness after they’d ended that made gooseflesh prickle the hair at the backof his neck.Just before he reached the brink of the clearing, Richard finally drew hissword. The singular sound of freeing the blade sent the cutting ring of steelthrough the damp woodland, ending the silence.Instantly, the heat of the sword’s anger flooded through every fiber of hisbeing, to be answered in kind by his own anger. Once again, Richard committedhimself to the magic he knew, and upon which he could depend.Filled with the sword’s power, he ached for the source of the threat, and lustedto end it.There had been a time when fear and uncertainty made him reluctant to surrenderto the rising storm brought forth from the ancient, wizard-wrought blade,hesitant to answer the call with his own anger, but he had long since learned tolet himself go into the rapture of the rage. It was that righteous wrath that hehad learned to bend to his will. It was that power he directed to his purpose.There had been those in the past who’d coveted the sword’s power, but in theirblind lust for that which belonged to others, had ignored the darker perils theystirred by using such a weapon. Instead of being masters of the magic, they hadbecome servants to the blade, to its anger, and to their own rapacious greed.There had been those who had used the power of the weapon for evil ends. Suchwas not the fault of the blade. The use of the sword, for good or for evil, wasthe conscious choice made by the person wielding it and all responsibility fellto them.Racing through the wall of tree limbs, shrubs, and vines, Richard came to a haltat the edge of the clearing where the soldiers had fallen in the battle severaldays before. Sword in hand, he gasped for air—despite how putrid the airsmelled—struggling to catch his breath.At first, as he scanned the bizarre scene spread out before him, he had troublecomprehending what it was he was seeing.Dead ravens lay everywhere. Not just dead, but ripped apart. Wings, heads, andparts of carcasses littered the clearing. Feathers by the thousands had settledlike black snow over the rotting corpses of the soldiers.Frozen in shock for only an instant, and still breathless, Richard knew thatthis was not what he sought. Tearing across the battle site, he bounded up theshort bank, through the gaps in the trees, and over trampled vegetation, towardwhere the men had been waiting.The rage of the sword spiraled up through him as he ran, making him forget thathe was tired, that he was winded, that he wasn’t yet fully recovered, preparinghim for the fight to come. In that moment, the only thing that mattered toRichard was getting to the men, or, more precisely, getting at the threat to themen.There was a matchless rapture in killing those who served evil. Evilunchallenged was evil sanctioned. Destroying evil was really a celebration ofthe value of life, made real by destroying those who existed to deny otherstheir life.Therein lay the fundamental purpose behind the sword’s essential, indispensablerequirement for rage. Rage blunted the horror of killing, stripped away thenatural reluctance to kill, leaving only its naked necessity if there was to betrue justice.As Richard raced out of the stand of birch, the first thing that caught hisattention was the maple tree where the men had been waiting. The lower limbs hadbeen stripped bare of leaves. It looked like a storm had swooped down to ripthrough the woods. Where only a short time ago small trees grew, now all thatwas left was shattered stumps. Branches thick with shimmering, wet leaves orpine needles lay scattered about. Huge jagged splinters of tree trunks stuck upfrom the ground like spent spears after a battle.Beneath the maple, scattered across the forest floor, was a scene that, atfirst, Richard could make no sense of. Nearly everything that before had beensome shade of green, whether dusty sage, yellowish, or rich emerald, was nowtainted with the stain of red.Richard stood panting, his heart pounding, fighting to focus the rage on athreat he could not identify. He scanned the shadows and darkness back among thetrees, looking for any movement. At the same time he struggled to sort out theconfusion of what he was seeing on the ground before him.Cara skidded to a halt to his left, ready for a fight. An instant later, Victorstumbled to a stop on his right, his mace held in a tight fist. Nicci raced inright behind, no weapon evident, but Richard could sense the air around hervirtually crackling with her power ready to be unleashed.“Dear spirits,” the blacksmith whispered. His six-bladed mace, a deadly weaponthe man had made himself, rose in his fist as he cautiously started forward.Richard lifted his sword in front of Victor to bar him from going any farther.His chest against the blade, the blacksmith reluctantly heeded the silentcommand and stopped.What, at first, had been a bewildering sight became at last all too clear. Aman’s forearm, missing the hand but still covered with a brown flannelshirtsleeve, lay in a bed of ferns at Richard’s feet. Not far away stood aheavy, laced boot with a jagged white shinbone stripped of sinew and musclejutting out from the top. In a thicket of roughleaf dogwood just to the side laya section of a torso, its flesh torn away to lay bare a section of the spine andblanched rib bones. Squiggles of pink viscera lay strewn over the log where themen had been sitting. Ragged pieces of scalp and skin lay atop bare rock andscattered everywhere through the grass and bushes.Richard could not imagine what power could have caused such a shocking scene.A thought struck him. He glanced back over his shoulder at Nicci. “Sisters ofthe Dark?”Nicci slowly shook her head as she studied the carnage. “There are a few similarcharacteristics, but on balance this is nothing like the way they kill.”Richard didn’t know if that was comforting news or not.Slowly, carefully, he stepped forward among the still-bleeding remains. Itdidn’t look to him like it had been a battle; there were no cuts from swords oraxes, no arrows or spears to mark the battlefield. None of the limbs or mangledribbons of muscle appeared to have been cut. Every piece looked as if it hadbeen torn away from where it belonged.It was so horrific a sight, so incomprehensible, that it was beyond sickening.Richard found it disorienting trying to conceive of what could have created suchdevastation—not just of the men, but of the landscape where they had been. Fromsomewhere beyond the boiling rage of the sword’s magic, he felt an agony ofsorrow for what he had not been able to stop, and he knew that that sorrow wouldonly grow. But right then, he wanted nothing so much as to get his hands onwhoever—or whatever—had done this.“Richard,” Nicci whispered from close behind, “I think it best if we get out ofhere.”The direct, calm tone of her voice could not have been any more compelling awarning.Filled with the rage from the sword in his fist, and his own impassioned angerat what he was seeing, he ignored her. If there was anyone left alive, he had tofind them.“There’s no one left,” Nicci murmured, as if in answer to his thoughts.If the threat still lurked nearby, he needed to know.“Who could have done this?” Victor whispered, clearly not interested in leavinguntil he had the guilty party in his grip.“It doesn’t look like anything human,” Cara answered in quiet indictment.As Richard stepped carefully through the remains, the silence of the shroudingwoods pressed in on him like a great weight. No birds called, no bugs buzzed, nosquirrels chattered. The muting effect of the heavy overcast and drizzle onlyserved to thicken the hush.Blood dripped from leaves, branches, and the tips of bent grasses. The trunks oftrees were splattered with it. The coarse bark of an ash was smeared with oozingtissue. A hand, fingers open and slack, empty of any weapon, lay palm-up on agravel slope beneath the large leaves of a mountain maple.Richard spotted the footprints of where they all had entered the area and someof his own footprints where he had left only a short time ago with Nicci, Cara,and Victor. Many of the remains lay in virgin forest where none of them hadwalked. There were no peculiar footprints among the carnage, although there wereunexplained places where the ground had been ripped open. Some of those gougescut right through thick roots.Taking a better look, Richard realized that the plowed gashes were places wheremen had been smashed to the ground with such violence that it had torn open theforest floor. In some spots, flesh still clung to the exposed ends of splinteredroots.Cara gripped his shirt at the shoulder, trying to urge him back. “Lord Rahl, Iwant you away from here.”Richard pulled his shoulder free of her grip. “Quiet.”As he stepped silently among the remains, the countless voices of those who hadused the sword in the past whispered in the back of his mind.Don’t focus on what you’re seeing, on what is done. Watch for what caused it andmight yet come. Now is the time for vigilance.Richard hardly needed such a warning. He was gripping the wire-wound hilt of thesword so tightly that he could feel the raised lettering of the word truthformed by gold wire woven through the sliver. That golden word bit into theflesh of his palm on one side and his fingertips on the other.At his feet a man’s head stared up at him from among scrub sumac. A mute crytwisted the expression fixed on the face. Richard knew him. His name had beenNuri. All that this young man had learned, all that he had experienced, all thathe had planned for, the world he had begun to make for himself, was ended. Forall these men, the world was finished; the one life they had had was goneforever.The agony of that terrible loss, that ghastly finality, threatened to extinguishthe rage from the sword and swamp him in sorrow. All these men were loved andcherished by those waiting for them to return. Each one of these individualswould be grieved over with heartache that would indelibly mark the living.Richard made himself move on. Now was not the time to grieve. Now was the timeto find the guilty and visit upon them retribution and justice before they hadthe chance to do this to others. Only then could the living mourn for theseprecious souls lost.Despite how widely he searched, Richard didn’t see a single body—not a body inthe sense of a whole, recognizable person—yet the entire area where the men hadbeen waiting was littered with their remains. The surrounding woods, also,revealed parts of those remains, as if some of the men had tried to run. If thatwas the case, none had gotten far. As Richard moved through the trees, lookingfor any tracks that might help him identify who had killed these men, he keptone eye on the shadows off in the mist. He saw tracks of men who had run, but hesaw no tracks chasing after them.As he came around an ancient pine, he was confronted by the top half of a man’schest hanging upside down from a splintered limb. The remains hung well aboveRichard’s head. What was left of the armless torso had been impaled on the stumpof a broken limb as if it were a meat hook. The face was fixed with unbridledterror. Being upside down, the hair, dripping blood, stood out straight from thescalp as if frozen in fright.“Dear spirits,” Victor whispered. Rage twisted his face. “That’s Ferran.”Richard scanned the area, but saw nothing moving in the shadows. “Whateverhappened here, I don’t think anyone escaped.” He noticed that on the groundwhere Ferran’s blood dripped there were no tracks.Kahlan’s tracks were gone as well.The pain, the horror, of wondering if this might be the same thing that hadhappened to Kahlan nearly buckled his knees. Not even the sword’s rage wasenough to shield him from the agony of that pain.Nicci, right behind him, leaned close. “Richard,” she said in a near whisper,“we need to get out of here.”Cara leaned in beside Nicci. “I agree.”Victor lifted his mace. “I want those who did this.” His knuckles were whitearound the steel grip. “Can you track them?” he asked Richard.“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Nicci said.“Good idea or not,” Richard told them, “I don’t see any tracks.” He looked intoNicci’s blue eyes. “Perhaps you would like to try to convince me that I amimagining this, as well?”She didn’t break eye contact with him, but she didn’t answer his challenge,either.Victor gazed up at Ferran. “I told his mother that I’d watch over him. What am Igoing to say to his family now?” Tears of rage and hurt glistened in his eyes ashe pointed with the mace back to the rest of the remains. “What am I going tosay to their mothers and wives and children?”“That evil murdered them,” Richard said. “That you will not rest until you knowjustice is done. That vengeance will be had.”Victor nodded, his anger flagging, misery now filling his voice. “We have tobury them.”“No,” Nicci said with grim authority. “As much as I understand your want to carefor them, your friends are no longer here, among these pieces of wrecked bodies.Your friends are now with the good spirits. It is up to us not to join them.”Victor’s anger resurfaced. “But we must—”“No,” Nicci snapped. “Look around. This was a blood frenzy. We don’t want to getcaught in it. We can’t help these men. We need to get out of here.”Before Victor could argue, Richard leaned close to the sorceress. “What do youknow about this?”“I told you before, Richard, that we needed to talk. But this is not the time orplace to do it.”“I agree,” Cara growled. “We need to get away from here.”Looking from the remains of Ferran back to the bloody mess beneath the maple,Richard suddenly felt a sense of overwhelming loneliness. He wanted Kahlan sobad it hurt. He wanted her comfort. He wanted her safe. The agony of not knowingif she was alive and well was unbearable.“Cara is right.” Nicci urgently gripped Richard’s arm. “We don’t know enoughabout what we’re up against, but whatever did all this, I fear that as weak asyou are your sword can’t protect us from it—and right now, neither can I. Ifit’s still in these woods, now is not the time to confront it. Justice andvengeance need us to see them done. To do that, we must be alive.”With the back of a hand, Victor wiped tears of grief and anger from his cheek.“I hate to admit it, but I think Nicci’s right.”“Whatever was looking for you, Lord Rahl,” Cara said. “I don’t want you here ifit should happen to return.”Richard noted the way Cara, in her red leather, no longer seemed out of place inthe woods. She blended right in with all the blood.Still not ready to abandon the search for whatever had killed these men, andwith a dark sense of alarm rising within him, Richard frowned at the Mord-Sith.“What makes you think it was after me?”“I told you,” Nicci said through gritted teeth, answering in Cara’s stead, “nowis not the time and this is not the place to talk about it. There is nothing wecan hope to accomplish here. These men are beyond our help.”Beyond help. Was Kahlan beyond help as well? He couldn’t allow himself tobelieve that.He looked north. Richard didn’t know where to search for her. Just because therock that had been kicked out of its resting place had been found to the northof their camp didn’t mean that whoever took Kahlan went that way. They mighthave simply gone north, trying to avoid contact with Victor and his men and withthe soldiers guarding the supply convoy. They might have only been trying toavoid being spotted until they got out of the immediate area. After that, theycould have gone anywhere.But where?Richard knew that he needed help.He tried to think of who could help him with something like this. Who wouldbelieve him? Zedd might believe him, but Richard didn’t think his grandfathercould offer the specific kind of help he needed in this circumstance. It wasawfully far to go if it ended up that Zedd’s abilities didn’t fit thisparticular kind of problem.Who would be willing to help him, and might know something?Richard turned suddenly to Victor. “Where can I get horses? I need horses.Where’s the closest place?”Victor was taken off guard by the question. He let the heavy mace hang and withhis other hand wiped rainwater back off his forehead as he considered thequestion. His brow bunched back up.“Altur’Rang would probably be the closest place,” he said after a moment’sthought.Richard slid his sword back into its sheath. “Let’s go. We need to hurry.”Pleased with the decision to leave, Cara gave him a helpful shove in thedirection of Altur’Rang. Suspicion lurked in Nicci’s eyes, but she was sorelieved to have him start away from the site of so much death that she didn’task why he wanted horses.Weariness forgotten, the four of them hurried away from men beyond any help. Asheartsick as they felt about leaving, each of them understood that it would betoo dangerous to stay to try to bury these men. A burial of the dead was notworth the risk to their lives.With his sword put away, the anger extinguished. In its place welled up thecrushing pain of grief for the dead. The forest seemed to weep with them.Worse yet was the dread of wondering what could have happened to Kahlan. If shewas in the hands of this evil…Think of the solution, Richard reminded himself.If he was to find her, he would need help. To get help, he needed horses. Thatwas the immediate problem at hand. They still had half a day of daylight. Heintended not to waste a moment of it.Richard led them away through the tangled woods at an exhausting pace. No onecomplained."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7In the deepening gloom of approaching nightfall, Richard and Cara used thin,wiry pine tree roots they’d pulled up from the spongy ground to lash togetherthe trunks of small trees. Victor and Nicci foraged the understory along thebase of the heavily forested slope, cutting and collecting balsam boughs. AsRichard held the logs together, Cara tied off the ropelike root. Richard cut theexcess for use elsewhere and slipped the knife back into its sheath at his belt.Once he had the log framework securely in place against an overhang of rock, hestarted stacking the balsam boughs along the bottom. Cara tied random brancheson from inside to keep them all in place for the night as Richard continuedlayering more up the poles. Victor and Nicci dragged armfuls of boughs close tokeep him supplied as he worked.The area under the overhanging roof of rock was dry enough, it just wasn’t largeenough. The lean-to would expand the shelter so as to provide a snug place tosleep. Without a fire it wouldn’t be especially warm, but at least it would bedry.Throughout the day, the drizzle had turned to a slow, steady rain. While theyhad been on the move they had been warm enough because of their exertion, butnow that they had to stop for the night, the inexorable embrace of the cold hadbegun. Even in chilly weather that wasn’t truly cold, being wet sapped a personof their necessary warmth and thus their strength. Richard knew that, over time,constant exposure to even mildly chilly wet weather could steal enough vitalheat from the body to severely debilitate and sometimes even kill a person.With as little sleep as he knew Nicci and Cara had gotten over the previousthree days, and in his own weakened condition, Richard recognized that theyneeded a dry, warm place to get some rest or they would all be in trouble. Hecouldn’t allow anything to slow him down.For the whole of the afternoon and evening they had set a steady, rapid pace ontheir march toward Altur’Rang. After the brutal slaughter of the men, the fourof them hadn’t been particularly hungry, but they knew that they had to eat ifthey were to have the strength for the journey, so they nibbled on dried meatsand travel biscuits as they made their way through the trackless wilderness.Richard was so exhausted he could hardly stand. Both to cut the distance and toavoid being spotted by anyone, he had guided the others through dense forest,most of it tough going and all of it well off any trails. It had been a gruelingday’s travel. His head ached. His back ached. His legs ached. If they startedearly and kept up the strenuous pace, though, they might be able to reachAltur’Rang in one more day’s travel. After they got horses, the going would beeasier as well as swifter.He wished he didn’t need to go so far, but he didn’t know what else to do. Hecouldn’t spend forever searching the vast forests all around, on the off chancehe would find another rock that had been disturbed so that he then might have anidea of which direction Kahlan had gone. He might never find another such rock,and even if he did, there was no reason to believe that if he kept going in thatdirection he would find Kahlan. Whoever took her might change direction withoutever again disturbing a rock in a way that he would find it.Their regular tracks were gone. Richard knew no way to track someone when magichad made their tracks vanish. Nicci’s gift wasn’t able to help. Wandering aroundaimlessly wasn’t going to solve anything. As reluctant as he was to leave thearea where he had last seen Kahlan, Richard didn’t think that he had any otherchoice but to go for help.He went through the motions of building the shelter without giving the work muchthought. In the failing light, Cara, concerned for his well-being, kept watchinghim out of the corner of her eye. She looked like she expected him to fall overat any moment and if he did she intended to catch him.As he worked, Richard mulled over the remote but real possibility that ImperialOrder soldiers might be searching the woods for them. At the same time hefretted about what could have killed all of Victor’s men—and might now bechasing them. He considered what other precautions he might take, and hedeliberated over how he would fight whatever could have done such violence.Through it all, he kept trying to think of where Kahlan might be. He went overeverything he could remember. He brooded over whether or not she was hurt. Heagonized over what he might have done wrong. He imagined that she must be filledwith fear and doubt, wondering why he wasn’t coming to help her escape, why hehadn’t yet found her, and if he ever would before her captors killed her.He struggled to banish from his mind the gnawing fear that she might already bedead.He tried not to think about what might be done to her as a captive that could beinfinitely more gruesome than a simple execution. Jagang had ample reason towant her to live a good long time; only the living could feel pain.From the beginning, Kahlan had been there to frustrate Jagang’s ambitions andsometimes even reverse his success. The Imperial Order’s very firstexpeditionary force in the New World, among other things, slaughtered all theinhabitants of the great Galean city of Ebinissia. Kahlan came upon the grislysight shortly after a troop of young Galean recruits had discovered it. In theirblind rage, despite being outnumbered ten to one, those young men had been benton the glory of vengeance and victory, on meeting upon the battlefield thesoldiers who had tortured, raped, and murdered all of their loved ones.Kahlan came across those recruits, led by Captain Bradley Ryan, just before theywere about to march into a textbook battle that she realized would be theirdeath. In their bold inexperience, they were convinced that they could make suchtactics work and snatch victory, despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered.Kahlan knew how the experienced Imperial Order soldiers fought. She knew that ifshe allowed those young recruits to do as they planned, they would be marchinginto a merciless meat grinder and all of them would die. The results of theirshortsighted notions of the righteous glory of combat would be that thoseImperial Order soldiers would then go on, unopposed, to other cities andcontinue to murder and plunder innocent people.Kahlan took command of the young recruits and set about dissuading them of theirignorant notions of a fair fight. She brought them to fully understand thattheir only goal was killing the invaders. It didn’t matter how the Galeans cameto stand over the corpses of those brutes, it only mattered that they did. Inthat undertaking of killing, there was no glory, there was simply survival. Theywere killing so that there could be life. Kahlan taught those recruits what theyneeded to know about fighting a force that greatly outnumbered them, and sheshaped them into men who could accomplish the grim task.The night before leading those young men into combat, Kahlan went alone into theenemy camp and killed their wizard along with some of the officers. The nextday, those five thousand young men fought at her side, followed herinstructions, learned from her, and along the way took terrible casualties, butthey eventually killed every last one of the Imperial Order’s fifty-thousand-manadvance force. It had been an accomplishment rarely equaled in history.That had been the first of many blows Kahlan struck against Jagang. In answer,he sent assassins after her. They failed.In Richard’s absence, after Nicci had taken him away to the heart of the OldWorld, Kahlan had gone to join Zedd and the D’Haran Empire forces. She foundthem dispirited and on the run after having lost a three-day battle. InRichard’s place, carrying the Sword of Truth, the Mother Confessor pulled thearmy back onto its feet and immediately counterattacked, surprising the enemyand bloodying them. She brought backbone and fire to the D’Haran forces. Sheinspired them to the challenge. Captain Ryan’s men arrived to join with her inthe fight against Jagang’s invading horde. For nearly a year, Kahlan led theD’Haran Empire forces as they frustrated Jagang’s efforts to swiftly subdue theNew World. She harried and harassed him without pause. She helped direct plansthat resulted in Jagang’s army losing hundreds of thousands of men.Kahlan had bled the Imperial Order army, and helped grind them to a halt outsideAydindril. In winter, she had evacuated the people of Aydindril, and had thearmy take them over the passes into D’Hara. The D’Haran forces then sealed offthose passes and, for the time being, held the Imperial Order at bay short oftheir final objective of conquering D’Hara and finally bringing the New Worldunder the brutal rule of the Fellowship of Order.Jagang’s hatred for Kahlan was exceeded only by his hatred for Richard. Mostrecently, the dream walker had sent an extremely dangerous wizard named Nicholasafter them. Richard and Kahlan had only narrowly escaped capture.Richard knew that the Order relished seeing to it that captured foes sufferedmonstrous abuse, and there was no one, other than Richard, whom Emperor Jagangwanted to put to torture more than the Mother Confessor.There were no lengths to which he would not go to get his hands on her. EmperorJagang would reserve for Kahlan the most unspeakable torture.Richard realized that he was standing frozen, trembling, his fingers gripping afistful of balsam boughs. Cara silently watched him. He knelt and again startedlaying the branches in place while struggling to put terrible thoughts from hismind. Cara went back to her work. He put all his effort into concentrating onthe task of completing their shelter. The sooner they got to sleep, the morerested they would be when they woke, and the faster they could travel.Even though they were nowhere near any roads and a great distance from thetrails, Richard still didn’t want to have a fire for fear that scouting soldiersmight spot it. Although they wouldn’t be able see the fire’s smoke through allthe drizzle and fog, such weather tended to keep smoke low to the ground,drifting this way and that through the woods, so any Imperial Order patrolswould be able to smell it. It was a real enough possibility that none of theothers argued for a fire. Being cold was a lot better than having to fight fortheir lives.Nicci dragged an armful of balsam boughs close as Richard continued to weavethem up the lean-to. None of the others spoke, apparently absorbed in worry thatwhatever had killed the men might be out there, among the deepening shadows,hunting the four of them as they prepared to go to sleep in a fortress made ofnothing more than balsam boughs.Their first day’s journey toward Altur’Rang had felt less like traveling andmore like running for their lives. But whatever had killed Victor’s men had notchased them. At least, Richard didn’t think it had. He couldn’t really imaginethat whatever had the power to kill that many men in such a brutal fashioncouldn’t manage to catch up with them if it had their trail. Especially notsomething filled with a blood frenzy, as Nicci had described it.Besides, when he was in the woods Richard usually knew when there were animalsabout and where they likely were, and, as a rule, he knew when people wereclose. Had Victor and his men not been camped quite so far from Richard, Kahlan,and Cara’s camp, he would have known they were there. He also had a keen senseof when he was being pursued and if someone was following his trail. As a guide,he sometimes tracked people lost in the woods. He and other guides sometimes hadcontests to track one another. Richard knew how to watch for someone trackinghim.This, however, was less a matter of suspecting that someone was following themand more a feeling of icy dread, as if they were being chased by a murderousphantom in a blood frenzy. That fear constantly urged them to run. He knew, too,that running was often the trigger that made a predator pounce.Richard realized, though, that it was only his imagination making him feel thehot breath of pursuers. Zedd had taught him that it was always important tounderstand why you had specific feelings so that you could decide if thosefeelings were caused by something that warranted attention, or something thatdidn’t. Other than the palpable fear caused by the brutality of the slaughter,Richard had no evidence that they were being chased, so he tried to keep theemotion in proper perspective.Fear itself often proved to be the greatest threat. Fear made people dothoughtless things that often got them into trouble. Fear made people stopthinking. When they stopped thinking, they often made foolish choices.Several times when he was growing up, Richard had tracked people who had gottenlost in the vast forests around Hartland. One boy Richard had tracked for twodays kept running in the dark until he eventually fell from a cliff. Luckily itwasn’t a long fall. Richard found him at the bottom of the steep bank with atwisted ankle that was swollen but not broken. The boy was only cold, tired, andfrightened. It could have been far worse and he knew it. He had been very gladto see Richard appear and held him tightly around the neck all the way home.There were any number of ways to die out in the woods. Richard had heard ofpeople attacked by a bear, or a cougar, or bitten by a snake. But he couldn’timagine what had killed Victor’s men. He’d never seen anything like it. He knewit hadn’t been soldiers. He supposed that it could have been the gifted usingsome kind of terrible power to slaughter the men, but he just didn’t think thatwas the explanation.He realized, then, that he was already thinking of it as a beast.Whatever killed the men, Richard had taken precautions as they had set out. Hefollowed shallow streams until they were a good distance from the sight of theslaughter. He was careful to lead them up out of the rushing water and away fromthe stream across ground where it would be much more difficult to track them.More than once throughout the day he had led them over bare rock or throughwater to make it extremely time-consuming for someone good at tracking to followthem. The shelter, too, was designed to blend into the surrounding woods. Itwould be hard to spot, unless someone passed very near to it.Victor dragged a heavy load of balsam boughs close and laid them at Richard’sfeet. “Need more?”With the toe of his boot, Richard nudged the pile, judging by its density howmuch and how well it would cover the remaining poles. “No, I think these and theones Nicci is bringing should be enough.”Nicci dropped her load beside Victor’s. It seemed odd to him seeing Nicci doingsuch work. Even dragging balsam boughs she had a regal look about her. WhileCara was a strikingly beautiful woman as well, her audacious bearing made itseem rather natural for her to be building a shelter—or a spiked flail cocked tokill intruders. Nicci, though, looked unnatural working in the woods—as if shewould complain about getting her hands dirty, although she never once did. Itwasn’t that she was at all unwilling to do whatever Richard needed her to do, itwas just that she looked completely out of place doing it. She simply had anoble bearing that seemed too stately for the task of hauling branches for ashelter in the woods.Now that she had brought all the balsam boughs that Richard needed, Nicci stoodquietly under the dripping trees, hugging herself as she shivered. Richard’sfingers were numb with cold as he quickly wove on the remaining boughs. He sawCara, as she worked to secure the limbs, occasionally putting her hands underher armpits. Only Victor showed no outward appearance of being cold. Richardimagined that the blacksmith’s glower was enough to warm him most of the time.“Why don’t you three get some sleep,” Victor said as Richard placed the last ofthe boughs over the shelter. “I’ll take watch for now if no one objects. I’m notmuch sleepy.”From the undercurrent of anger in the man’s voice, Richard imagined that Victormight not be sleepy for quite a long while. He could certainly understandVictor’s bitter sorrow. The man would no doubt spend his watch trying to thinkof what he would say to Ferran’s mother and the relatives of the other men.Richard laid an understanding hand on Victor’s shoulder. “We don’t know whatwe’re up against. Don’t hesitate to wake us if you hear or see anything at allunusual. And don’t forget to come inside and have your share of sleep; tomorrowwill be a long day of traveling. We all need to be strong.”Victor nodded. Richard watched as the blacksmith picked up his cloak and threwit around his shoulders before seizing roots and clinging vines to help himscale the rock above the shelter to where he would watch over them. Richardwondered if perhaps the outcome might have been different had Victor been withthe men. Then he thought about the aftermath of splintered trees, deep gouges inthe ground carved with such force that it had overturned rocks and torn thickroots apart. He remembered the ripped leather armor, the shattered bones, therent bodies, and was glad that Victor had not been with the men when the attackhad come. Even a heavy mace wielded in anger by the powerful arms of the masterblacksmith would not have stopped whatever had come into that clearing.Nicci pressed a hand to Richard’s forehead, testing for fever. “You need rest.No watch for you tonight. The three of us will each take a turn.”Richard wanted to argue, but he knew that she was right. This was not a battlehe should take up, so he didn’t and instead nodded his agreement. Cara,obviously prepared to take Nicci’s side if he argued, turned back from watchingthem from out of the small opening between the boughs.From the gathering darkness all around a grating sound had begun to build into ashrill chirr. Now that they were finished with the effort of building theshelter, the noise was hard to ignore. It made the whole forest seem alive withraucous activity. Nicci finally took notice of it and paused to look around.She frowned. “What is that sound, anyway?”Richard plucked an empty skin from a tree trunk. Everywhere throughout theforest the trees were covered with the pale, tannish, thumb-sized husks.“Cicadas.” Richard smiled to himself as he let the gossamer ghost of thecreature that had once lived inside roll into his palm. “This is what’s leftafter they molt.”Nicci glanced at the empty skin in his hand and briefly looked at some of theothers clinging to the trees. “While I spent most of my life in towns andcities, and indoors, I’ve spent a great deal of time outdoors since leaving thePalace of the Prophets. These insects must be unique to these woods; I don’trecall ever seeing them before—or hearing them.”“You wouldn’t have. I was a boy the last time I saw them. This kind of cicadaemerges from underground every seventeen years. Today is the first day they allhave begun to emerge. They will only be around for a few weeks while they mateand lay their eggs. Then we won’t see them again for another seventeen years.”“Really?” Cara asked as she poked her head back out. “Every seventeen years?”She thought it over for a moment and then scowled up at Richard. “They betternot keep us awake.”“Because of their numbers they create quite an unforgettable sound. Withcountless of the cicadas all trilling together, you can sometimes hear theharmonic rise and fall of their song moving through the forest in a wave. In thequiet of night, their stridulation may seem deafening at first, but, believe itor not, it will actually lull you to sleep.”Satisfied to know that the noisy insects would not keep her charge awake, Caradisappeared back inside.Richard recalled his wonder when Zedd had walked with him through the woods,showing him the newly emerged creatures, telling him all about theirseventeen-year life cycle. To Richard, as a boy, it was a memorable wonder. Zeddtold him how he would be grown up when they came again, that he had first seenthem as a boy, and the next time he would see them as a grown man. Richardremembered marveling at the event and promising himself that when they cameagain, he would be sure to spend more time watching the rare creatures when theyappeared from the ground.Richard felt a wave of profound sadness for the loss of that innocent time inlife. As a boy, the emergence of the cicadas had seemed like just about the mostamazing phenomenon he could imagine, and waiting seventeen years until theyreturned seemed like the hardest thing he would ever have to do. And now theywere back.And now he was a man. He cast the empty husk aside.After Richard removed his wet cloak and crawled in behind Nicci, he pulledbranches together to cover over the opening to the snug shelter. The thickbranches toned down the high-pitched song of the cicadas. The ceaseless buzzingwas making him sleepy.He was pleased to see that the balsam boughs worked to shed the rain, leavingthe cavelike refuge dry, if not warm. They had laid down a bed of boughs overthe exposed ground so they would have a relatively soft and dry platform uponwhich to sleep. Even without rain dripping on them, though, the humidity and fogstill dampened everything. Their breath came out in ephemeral clouds.Richard was weary of being wet. Handling trees had left him covered with barkand needles and dirt. His hands were sticky from tree sap. He couldn’t rememberever being so miserable with grime and grit clinging to his wet skin and wetclothes. At least the pine and balsam pitch left the shelter smelling pleasant.He wished he could have a hot bath. He hoped that Kahlan was warm and dry andunharmed.Tired as he was, and as sleepy as the sound of the cicadas was making him, therewere things Richard needed to know. There were matters far more important to himthan sleep, or his simple boyhood wonder.He needed to find out what Nicci knew about what had killed Victor’s men. Therewere too many connections to ignore. The attack had come right near whereRichard, Kahlan, and Cara had been camped a few days before. More importantly,whatever had killed the men didn’t seem to have left any tracks, at least nonethat he been able to find in his brief search, and, other than that displacedrock, Richard couldn’t find any tracks from either Kahlan or her abductor.Richard intended, before he slept, to find out what Nicci knew about what hadkilled the men."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Richard untied the leather thongs beneath his pack and opened his bedroll,spreading it out in the narrow space left between the other two.“Nicci, back at the place where the men were killed you said that it had been ablood frenzy.” He leaned back against the rock wall underneath the overhang.“What did you mean?”Nicci folded herself into a sitting position to his right, atop her own bedroll.“What we saw back there wasn’t simply killing. Isn’t that obvious?”He supposed she had a point. He had never witnessed a scene so shaped by rage.He was well aware, though, that she knew far more about it.Cara curled up to his left. “I’m telling you,” she said to Nicci, “I don’t thinkhe knows.”Richard cast a leery gaze at the Mord-Sith and then at the sorceress. “Knowswhat?”Nicci ran her fingers back through her wet hair, pulling strands off her face.She looked a little puzzled. “You said that you got the letter I sent.”“I did.” It had been quite a while back. He tried to remember through the dazeof weariness and worry everything Nicci’s letter had said—something about Jagangcreating weapons out of people. “Your letter was valuable in helping figure outwhat was happening at the time. And I did appreciate your warning about Jagang’sdarker pursuits of creating weapons out of the gifted; Nicholas the Slide was asnasty a piece of work.”“Nicholas.” Nicci spat the name before wrapping a blanket around her shoulders.“He is but a flea on the rump of the wolf.”If Nicholas was the flea, Richard hoped never to run into the wolf. Nicholas theSlide had been a wizard whom the Sisters of the Dark had altered to haveabilities that were well beyond any human traits. It had been thought thataccomplishing such conjuring with people was not only a lost art but impossiblebecause, among other things, such nefarious work required the use of not onlyAdditive but Subtractive Magic. While a rare few had learned to manipulate it,until Richard’s birth there hadn’t been anyone born with the actual gift forSubtractive Magic in thousands of years.But there had been those who, even though they had not been born with that sideof the gift, still had managed to gain the use of Subtractive Magic. Darken Rahlhad been one such person. It was said that he had traded the pure souls ofchildren to the Keeper of the underworld in exchange for dark indulgences,including the ability to use Subtractive Magic.Richard supposed that it could also have been through morbid promises to theKeeper that the first Sisters of the Dark had contrived to obtain the knowledgeof how to use Subtractive Magic, thereafter passing it on in secret to theircovert disciples.When the Palace of the Prophets had fallen, Jagang had captured many of theSisters, both Sisters of the Light and Sisters of the Dark, but their numberswere dwindling. From what Richard had learned, the dream walker’s abilityenabled him to enter every part of a person’s mind and thereby control them.There was no private thought he did not know or intimate deed he could notwitness. It was an inner violation so complete that no hidden corner of the mindwas safe from the dream walker’s direct scrutiny. What was worse, the victimcould not always tell if Jagang was lurking there, in their mind, witness totheir most secret thoughts.Nicci had said that the haunting possession by the dream walker had driven a fewof the Sisters mad. Richard also knew that through that link Jagang couldmeasure out excruciating pain and, if he wished it, death. With such control,the dream walker could make the Sisters do anything he wished.Through an ancient magic created by one of Richard’s ancestors to protect hispeople from the dream walkers of that time, those who swore fidelity to the LordRahl were protected. Along with the rest of his gift, Richard had inherited thatbond and, with a dream walker again born into the world, it now safeguardedthose loyal to him from Jagang stealing into their minds and enslaving them.While a formal devotion was spoken by the people of D’Hara to their Lord Rahl,the protection that the bond provided was actually invoked through theconviction of the person bonded—through their doing what they thought was calledfor by their fidelity.Both Ann, the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light, and Verna, the woman Ann hadnamed as her successor, had stolen into the Imperial Order’s camp and tried torescue their Sisters. The captive Sisters had been offered the protection of thebond—all they had to do was accept in their hearts their loyalty to Richard—butmost were so terrified of Jagang that more than once they had refused theirchance at freedom. Not everyone was willing to embrace liberty; liberty requirednot just effort, but risk. Some people chose to delude themselves and see theirchains as protective armor.Nicci had once been in servitude to the Fellowship of Order, the Sisters of theLight, and then the Sisters of the Dark, and finally to Jagang. She no longerwas; she had instead embraced Richard’s love of life. Her steadfast loyalty tohim and what he believed in had freed her from the clutches of the dream walker,but far more than that, it had freed her from the yoke of servitude she had wornher whole life. Her life was now hers alone. He thought that maybe that mighthave something to do with the resolute nobility of her bearing.“I didn’t read the whole letter,” Richard admitted. “Before I was able to finishit, we were attacked by men that Nicholas had sent to capture us. I told youabout it before—that was when Sabar was killed. During that fight the letterfell into the fire.”Nicci slouched back. “Dear spirits,” she murmured. “I thought you knew.”Richard was tired and at the end of his patience. “Knew what?”Nicci let her arms slip to her sides. She looked up at him in the dim light andlet out a frazzled sigh.“Jagang found a way for the Sisters of the Dark he holds captive to use theirability to begin creating weapons out of people, as had been done during thegreat war. In many ways, he is a brilliant man. He makes it his business tolearn. He collects books from the places he sacks. I’ve seen some of thosebooks. Among all sorts of tomes, he has ancient handbooks of magic from aroundthe time of the great war.“The problem is, while he may be a dream walker and brilliant in certain areas,he does not have the gift and so his understanding of it, of exactly what Han isand how this force of life functions, is crude at best. It’s not easy for onewithout magic to comprehend such things. You have the gift and yet even youdon’t really understand it or know very much about how it works. But becauseJagang doesn’t know how to work magic, he blunders around demanding that thingsbe done simply because he has dreamed them up, because he is the great emperorand he wishes his visions to be brought to life.”Richard rubbed his fingers back and forth on his brow, rolling off the dirt.“Don’t sell him short in that regard. It’s possible that he knows more aboutwhat he’s doing than you realize.”“What do you mean?”“I may not know a lot about the subject of magic, but one of the things I havelearned is that magic can also be thought of much like an art form. Throughartistic expression—for lack of a better term—magic that has never been beforecan be created.”Nicci stared in astonished disbelief. “Richard, I don’t know where you couldhave heard such a thing, but it just doesn’t work that way.”“I know, I know. Kahlan thinks I’m out on a limb with this, too. Having beenraised around wizards, she knows a lot about magic and in the past she hasflatly insisted that I’m wrong. But I’m not. I’ve done it before. Using the giftin such a way, in new and original ways, got me out of what would otherwise havebeen unbreakable traps.”Nicci was peering at him in that analytical way of hers. He suddenly realizedwhy. It wasn’t only what he’d said about magic. He was talking about Kahlanagain. The woman who did not exist, the woman he had dreamed. Cara’s expressionbetrayed her mute concern.“Anyway,” Richard said, getting back to the crux of the matter, “just becauseJagang doesn’t have the gift, doesn’t mean he can’t still dream up things—dreamup nightmares—like Nicholas. It is through such original conceptualization thatthe most deadly things, for which there may be no conventional counter, arecreated. I suspect that this may have been the method those wizards in ancienttimes used for creating weapons out of people in the first place.”Nicci was beside herself with bottled agitation.“Richard, magic just doesn’t work like that. You can’t dream up whatever you’dlike to have, wish for what you want. Magic functions by the laws of its nature,just like all other things in the world. Whim will not make boards out of trees;you must cut the tree to the desired form. If you want a house, you can’t wishup bricks and boards to stack themselves into a dwelling; you must use yourhands to craft the structure.”Richard leaned toward the sorceress. “Yes, but it’s the human imagination thatmakes those concrete actions not just possible, but effective. Most buildersthink in terms of houses or barns; they do what’s been done before simplybecause that was what was done before. Much of the time they don’t want tothink, so they never envision anything more. They limit themselves to repetitionand as an excuse they insist that it must be done that way because it has alwaysbeen done that way. Most magic is like that—the gifted simply repeating what hasalready been done before, believing that it must be done that way with no morejustification than that it has always been done that way.“Before a grand palace can be built, it first has to be imagined by someone boldenough to have a vision of what could be. A palace will not spontaneously springforth to the surprise of all while men are attempting to build a barn. Only theconscious act of conceptualization can bring about the reality.“For that act of creative imagination to bring about the existence of a palace,it cannot violate any of the laws of the nature of the things that are used. Onthe contrary, the person who imagines a grand palace with the goal of seeing itbuilt must be intimately aware of the nature of all the things he will use inthe construction. If he isn’t, the palace will fall down. He must know thenature of the materials better than the man who uses them to build a simplebarn. It’s not a matter of wishing for something that transcends the laws ofnature, but a matter of original thinking based on those laws of nature.“I grew up in the woods around Hartland, never having seen a palace.” Richardspread his arms, as if to show her the things he had seen since leaving hishomeland. “Until I saw the castle at Tamarang, the Wizard’s Keep and theConfessors’ Palace in Aydindril, or the People’s Palace in D’Hara, I neverimagined that such places existed—or even that they could exist. They werebeyond the scope of my thinking at the time.“And yet, even though I never imagined that such places could be built, othermen thought them up, and they were built. I think that one of the importantfunctions of grand creations is that they inspire people.”Nicci appeared not only to be swept up in his explanation, but to be consideringhis words with serious interest. “Do you mean to say, then, that you think anart form can also shape such important things as the function of magic?”Richard smiled. “Nicci, you could not grasp the importance of life until Icarved the statue back in Altur’Rang. When you saw the concept in tangible formyou were able at last to put together all the things you had learned throughoutyour life and finally grasp its meaning. An artistic creation touched your soul.That’s what I mean about an important function of great works is that theyinspire people.“Because it inspired you with the beauty of life, with the nobility of man, youacted to become free—something you had never thought was possible. Because thepeople of Altur’Rang as well could see in that statue what could and should be,they were stirred to stand up to the tyranny crushing their lives. It was notaccomplished by copying other statues, by doing what was the accepted norm forstatues in the Old World of showing man as weak and ineffective, but by an ideaof beauty, a vision of nobility, that shaped what I carved.“I didn’t violate the nature of the marble I used, but rather I used the natureof the stone to accomplish something different than what others routinely didwith it. I studied the properties of stone, I learned how to work it, and Isought to understand what more I could do with it in order to bring about myobjective. I had Victor make me the finest tools that would enable me to do thework in the way it needed to be done. In that way I brought to reality what Iwanted to create, what had never been before.“I think that magic can work this way as well. I believe that such originalideas played a part in how weapons were once created out of people. After all,when such weapons were made, they were effective in large part because they wereoriginal, because they had never been thought of or seen before. In manyinstances, the other side in the war then had to work to create entirely newthings out of magic that were able to counter those weapons. In many cases theywere able to render the weapon obsolete by creating a countermagic, and thensomeone on the other side immediately went to work thinking up some new horror.If using magic creatively was not possible, then how did the wizards of oldcreate weapons with it? You can’t say they simply got the knowledge from a book,or from past experience; where and how would the first such weapons haveoriginated if not with an original idea? Someone had to have used magiccreatively in the first place.“I think that Jagang is again doing this very thing with magic. He has studiedsome of what was done in the great war, what weapons were created, and learnedfrom that. He sometimes may direct that what was once created to be createdagain, such as with Nicholas, but in other instances I think he imagines whathas never been, what goes beyond what has been done before, and has it broughtto reality by those who know how to use magic to build what he wants.“In these acts of creation it isn’t the work that is the most remarkable aspect,but the idea and vision that makes the labor effective, just as carpenters andbricklayers who built houses and barns can be employed to construct a palace. Itwasn’t so much their labor that was remarkable in the creation of palaces, butthe act of insight and creation that gave it direction.”Nicci nodded ever so slightly in concentration as she weighed his words. “I cansee that your notion isn’t at all the wild idea I thought it was at first. Thisis a line of reasoning that I’ve never encountered. I’ll have to think about thepossibilities. You may be the first to really understand the mechanism behindJagang’s scheme—or, for that matter, behind the creations of wizards in ancienttimes. This would explain a great many things that have nagged at me over theyears.”Nicci’s words were spoken with intellectual respect for a concept new to her,but a concept she fully grasped. No one who had ever spoken to Richard aboutmagic had ever treated his ideas with such an insightful understanding. He feltas if this was the first time anyone had truly understood what he saw.“Well,” he said, “I’ve had to deal with Jagang’s creations. Like I said,Nicholas was a great deal of trouble.”In the dim light, Nicci studied his face for a moment.“Richard, from what I was able to find out,” she said in a soft voice, “Nicholaswas not Jagang’s actual goal. Nicholas was merely practice.”“Practice!” Richard thumped his head back against the wall. “I don’t know,Nicci. I’m not so sure about that. Nicholas the Slide was a formidable creationand one nasty piece of work. You don’t know the trouble he caused us.”Nicci shrugged. “You defeated him.”Richard blinked in astonishment. “You make it sound like he was just a bump inthe road. He wasn’t. I’m telling you, he was a frightening creation who nearlykilled us.”Nicci slowly shook her head. “And I’m telling you, as formidable as he may havebeen, Nicholas was not what Jagang was after. You told me not to sell the dreamwalker short—don’t you now do that same thing. I never thought Nicholas wasfully your match.“What you say about the process of imagination in creating new things actuallymakes sense, especially in this instance. It may even explains few things. Fromthe little I was able to learn, I believe that from the beginning Nicholas wasonly meant to expand the skills of the Sisters that Jagang had assigned to thetask of creating weapons. Nicholas was not Jagang’s objective, but simplypractice on the way to that objective.“With his dwindling number of Sisters that practice has gained a new urgency.Even so, he apparently has enough Sisters for the work of creating his weapons.”Richard felt goose bumps tingling up his arms as he began to realist the fullimplications of what Nicci was telling him.“You mean to say that in creating Nicholas, it was like Jagang was just havinghis carpenters build a house as practice before he sends them on to buildsomething vastly more complicated, like a palace?”Nicci looked up at him and smiled. “Yes, that’s it exactly.”“But he sent Nicholas with troops to govern a land as well as to capture us.”“A mere matter of convenience. Jagang had instilled in Nicholas a need to huntyou, but only as part of the testing for his greater goals. He didn’t reallyexpect the Slide to be able to accomplish his transcendent ambitions. Theemperor may hate you for impeding his progress in conquering the New World, hemay consider you unworthy as an opponent, and he may deem you an immoral heathenworthy only of death, but he’s smart enough to give you credit for your ability.It’s like when you said that you sent that captured soldier to assassinateJagang. You didn’t really expect that lone soldier to succeed at the difficulttask of assassinating a well-guarded emperor, but the soldier was of no othervalue to you and since you thought that there was at least a chance that hemight accomplish something, you might as well send him on the mission while youworked on far better ideas that you expected to have a more reasonable chance ofsuccess. And if the soldier was killed, then that was fine by you because heonly got what was coming to him anyway.“Nicholas was like that. He was a conjured creation, practice along the path tosomething altogether superior. In the scheme of things, Nicholas wasn’t all thatvaluable to Jagang, so Jagang, instead of having him killed, [??ltd??] him. IfNicholas succeeded, then Jagang would be ahead of the game and if you killedhim, then you did him a service.” Richard ran his hand back over his hair. Hefelt overwhelmed at the implications. He had criticized Nicci for not being opento seeing the larger picture, and here he had just been guilty of doing the samething.“Well then,” he asked her, “what do you think Jagang might conjure up that’sworse than Nicholas the Slide?”The drone of the cicadas seemed oppressive, invasive, at that moment, as if theywere the enemy surrounding him.“I believe he has forged ahead and already created such a masterwork,” Niccisaid with quiet finality. She pulled her blanket up around her shoulders andheld it closed at her throat. “I think that’s what those men back there in thewoods faced.”Richard watched her expression in the near darkness. “What do you know aboutwhat Jagang has done?”“Not a great deal,” Nicci admitted. “Only a few words whispered as one of myformer fellow Sisters was leaving on a journey.”“A journey?”“To the world of the dead.”By her tone of voice and the way she stared off, Richard didn’t want to ask whathad brought about the woman’s travel plans. “So, what did she tell you?”Nicci let out a weary sigh. “That Jagang, had been making things from the livesof captives and volunteers both. Some of those young wizards actually think theyare sacrificing themselves for a greater good.” Nicci shook her head at such asad delusion. “The Sister was the one who told me that Nicholas was but astepping-stone to His Excellency’s true and noble ends.” Nicci looked up againto make sure that Richard was paying attention. “She said that Jagang was on thebrink of creating a creature similar to one he had found in ancient writings,but far better, far more deadly, and invincible.”The hair at the back of Richard’s neck lifted. “A creature? What kind ofcreature?”“A beast. An invincible beast.”Richard swallowed at the baleful sound of the word. “What’s this creature do?Were you able to find out? What’s its nature?”For some reason, he just couldn’t seem to bring himself to use the same wordaloud right then, as if speaking it might summon it from out of the surroundingnight.Nicci’s troubled eyes turned away. “As the Sister slipped into the arms ofdeath, she smiled like the Keeper himself with a booty of souls, and said, ‘Oncehe uses his power, the beast will at last know Richard Rahl. Then it will findhim, and kill him. His life, like mine, is finally at its end.’“Richard made himself blink. “Did she say anything else?”Nicci shook her head. “At that point, she convulsed in the agony of death. Theroom went black as the Keeper snatched her soul in payment for bargains she hadonce struck.“The one thing that’s been troubling me is how this creature found us. Still, Idon’t think the situation is as desperate as it may seem. There is really noconclusive evidence to make us believe that it really was this beast thatattacked the men back there. After all, you haven’t used your power, so therewouldn’t have been any way for Jagang’s beast to find you.”Richard looked down at his boots. “When the soldiers attacked,” he said in a lowvoice as he rubbed a finger along the edge of the leather sole, “I used my giftto deflect the arrows. I didn’t do so well with the last one.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said, “I don’t think that’s true. I think you used your swordto deflect the arrows.”“You weren’t there right then so you didn’t see what was happening,” Richardsaid as he grimly shook his head. “I was using my sword on the soldiers; Icouldn’t use it to deflect the dozens of arrows as well. I deflected the arrowswith my gift.”Nicci was now sitting up straight. “You used your gift? How did you summon it?”Richard shrugged self-consciously. He wished he knew more about what he’d done.“Through need, I guess. I didn’t know I would end up being responsible…”She gently touched his arm. “Don’t foolishly blame yourself. You had no way toknow. Had you not done as you did you would have been killed. You were acting tosave your life. You didn’t know anything about the beast. More than that,though, you may not be entirely responsible.”Richard frowned at her. “What do you mean?”Nicci sank back against the rock wall. “I fear that I may have contributed toits finding us.”“You? But how?”“I used Subtractive Magic to get rid of your blood so I could heal you. Whilethe Sister didn’t say anything specific that I could point to, I still got theuneasy feeling that this creature may somehow be tied to the underworld. Ifthat’s true, then when I got rid of your blood with the use of Subtractive MagicI may have inadvertently given it a taste of your blood, so to speak.”“You did the right thing,” Cara said. “You did the only thing you could do. Tolet Lord Rahl die instead would have been handing Jagang what he sought.”Nicci nodded her appreciation of Cara’s words.Richard let out the breath he had been holding. “What else can you tell me aboutthis thing?”“Nothing of any consequence, I’m afraid. The Sister told me that the Sisters whowere experimenting with creating weapons out of people had only created Nicholasto work out some of the preliminary details before moving on to their importantwork. Even so, some of them died in the task of conjuring the Slide—and, with asmany as have already died, Jagang is getting to the point where he has few tospare. He has used those he still has, while he still has enough, to accomplishhis goal. Apparently, creating the beast was vastly more complex and difficultthan creating a Slide, but the results were said to have been worth it. Isuspect that along the way he may have directed that shortcuts be taken,shortcuts that involve the underworld.“If we’re going to fight this thing, we need to find out everything we can aboutthis beast. And we need to find out before it catches us. With what happened tothe men, I don’t think we have much time.”Richard knew that what she meant, but hadn’t said, was that she wanted him toforget what she thought were his meaningless dreams about Kahlan and to put hisfull concentration and effort toward this dangerous creation of Jagang’s.“I have to find Kahlan,” he said in a quiet tone meant to convey his convictionand his resolve.“You can’t do anything if you’re dead,” Nicci said.Richard lifted the baldric over his head. He leaned the polished scabbardholding the Sword of Truth against the rock.“Look, we’re not even sure that whatever killed those men back there really isthis beast you’re talking about.”“What do you mean?” Nicci asked.“Well, if it can find me when I use my gift, then why did it attack the men?Sure, it was the place where I’d used my ability, but the attack was three daysafter the fact. If it was supposed to know me after I used my power then whyattack the men?”“Maybe it just thought you were among them,” Cara offered.Nicci nodded. “Cara might be right.”“Maybe,” Richard said. “But if it recognized me by me using my gift and inaddition you gave it a taste of my blood, then wouldn’t it know that I wasn’tamong the men?”Nicci shrugged. “I don’t know. It very well could be that by using your gift youonly summoned it to the general area, but when you stopped using your abilitythen the beast was blind to you, so to speak. Maybe it was so angry that it justmissed you it went into a frenzy of killing whoever was there. If that’s true,then I would suspect that it needs you to again use your gift, now that it’sclose, to finally be able to catch you.”“But she said that once I used my gift it would know me. That doesn’t sound tome like I need to use it again for it to find me.”“Maybe it does now know you,” Nicci said. “But maybe it still needs to find you.Since it knows you, now, maybe all the beast needs is for you to again use yourgift so that it can pounce.”That had a frightening kind of logic to it. “I guess it’s good that I don’tdepend on my gift.”“You’d better make sure you let us protect you,” Cara said. “I don’t think youhad better do anything that might even inadvertently cause you to use yourmagic.”“I’m afraid that I agree with Cara,” Nicci said. “I’m not sure about it having ataste of your blood, but the one thing we do know for sure is what the Sistertold me—that if you use your gift it will find you. As long as the beast ishunting you, and until we can learn more about it and nullify the threat, youmust not use your gift for any reason.”Richard conceded with a nod. He didn’t know if that was possible. While hedidn’t know how to call upon his gift, he wasn’t sure that he knew how toprevent it coming forth, either. It was awakened by anger and answered a certainkind of need. He wasn’t aware of the specific conditions that invoked hisability; it just happened. While their theory of not using his gift made sense,he wasn’t sure he could actually control it enough to prevent it if conditionscaused it to spring to life.Another frightening thought occurred to him. It was possible that the beast hadfound him, and knew precisely where he was, and it had only killed the men outof blood lust. For all he knew, the beast could be out in the woods watching,using the noise of the cicadas to cover its footsteps as it approached theirshelter.In the dim light Nicci watched him. As he pondered the grim possibilities, shereached out again and felt his forehead.Drawing back, she said, “We’d better get some rest. You’re shivering with thecold. I’m afraid that in your condition you may lapse into a fever. Lie down.We’ll all have to keep each other warm. But first, you need to be dry or you’llnever get warm.”Cara leaned past Richard, toward Nicci. “How do you think you can get him drywithout a fire?”Nicci gestured. “Both of you, lie back.”Richard lay back; Cara hesitantly complied. Nicci leaned over them, placing ahand just above their heads. Richard felt the warm tingle of magic, but not anuncomfortable sensation like the last time. He could see the soft glow aboveCara as well. It struck him how remarkable it was for Nicci to trust Cara enoughto use magic on her. Using magic on a Mord-Sith gave them the opportunity toseize that magic in order to control the gifted person. Richard found it evenmore remarkable that Cara would trust Nicci enough to allow her to use magic onher. Mord-Sith did not like magic one bit.Nicci’s hands moved slowly downward, just above their bodies. By the time shereached Richard’s boots, he realized that he felt dry. He ran a hand over hisshirt, then his pants, and found that both were dry.“How is that?” Nicci asked.Cara was scowling. “I’d rather be wet.”Nicci arched an eyebrow. “I can arrange that, if you like.”Cara put her hands under her arms to warm them and remained silent. Satisfiedthat Richard was pleased, Nicci did the same for herself, moving both hands downher dress as if slowly pressing away the water.When she finished, she was shivering and her teeth were chattering, but she andher black dress were dry.Concerned by the way she wavered that she might pass out, Richard sat up andgently gripped her arm. “Are you all right?”“I’m just exhausted,” she admitted. “I’ve not had much sleep for days, on top ofthe effort of healing you and then the exertion of the traveling we did afterthe attack today. I’m afraid that it’s all caught up with me. This bit of magictook what strength and warmth I had left. I just need to get some sleep, that’sall. But even if you don’t realize it, Richard, you need it even more. Lie backand sleep, now. Please. If we all lie close we can keep each other warm.”Dry, but weary and still cold, Richard wriggled into his bedroll. She was right;he did need rest. He couldn’t get help for Kahlan if he wasn’t rested.Without hesitation, Cara pressed up close on his left to help get him warm.Nicci pushed in on his other side. The warmth was a relief. He hadn’t realizedhow cold he was until the three of them crowded in tight together. He knew byhow he felt that Nicci was right, that he wasn’t fully well yet. At least heonly needed rest and not magic.“Do you think this beast could have taken Kahlan in order to get to me? he askedinto the dark and quiet shelter.Nicci was a moment in answering. “Such a creature needs no perverse method toget to you, Richard. From what the Sister said, and from what I fear I may havedone, to say nothing of you having used your gift, the beast will be able tofind you. From all those dead men back there, I fear it already has.”Richard felt the weight of guilt crush down upon him. If not for him, those menwould be alive.He had difficulty swallowing past the lump in his throat. He wished there weresome way to undo what was done, some way to give them their lives and theirfutures back.“Lord Rahl?” Cara whispered. “I would like to make a confession, if you willswear never to repeat it.”Richard had never heard her say such an odd thing. “All right. What is it thatyou wish to confess?”Her answer was a while in coming, and then it was so soft he would not have beenable to hear it were she not so close. “I’m afraid.”Almost against his better judgment, Richard lifted his arm around her shouldersand held her close. “Don’t be. It’s coming after me, not you.”She lifted her head and scowled at him. “That is the reason I’m afraid. Afterseeing what it did to those men, I’m afraid that it’s coming for you and thereis nothing I can do to protect you.”“Oh,” Richard said. “Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m afraid of that,too.”Cara laid her head back down on his shoulder, content to stay under theprotective comfort of his arm. The surrounding strum of the cicadas somehow madehim feel more vulnerable. The seventeen-year cycle of the insects wasinescapable, inexorable, unstoppable.So was Jagang’s beast. How could he hide from such a thing?“So,” Nicci asked, apparently trying to lighten the somber mood in the shelter,“where did you meet this woman of your dreams?”Richard didn’t know if she was trying to soften the question with a littlehumor, or if she was being sarcastic. If he didn’t know better he would havethought it sounded like jealously.He stared up in the darkness as he thought back to that day. “I was out in thewoods, looking for evidence of who had killed my father—the man I grew upthinking was my father, George Cypher, the man who’d raised me. That was when Ispotted Kahlan moving along a trail around Trunt Lake.“Four men were following her. They were assassins sent by Darken Rahl to killher. He had already killed all the other Confessors. She is the last.”“So you rescued her?” Cara asked.“I helped her. Together we were able to kill the assassins.“She’d come to Westland looking for a long-lost wizard. It turned out that Zeddwas the great wizard she had been sent to find—he still held the position ofFirst Wizard, even though he had given up the Midlands and fled to Westlandbefore I was born. The whole time I grew up I never knew that Zedd was a wizard,or my grandfather. I only knew him as my best friend in the world.”He could sense Nicci looking at him, and feel her warm, soft breath against theside of his face. “Why did she want this great wizard?”“Darken Rahl had put the boxes of Orden in play. It was everyone’s worstnightmare.” Richard clearly recalled his dread at hearing that news. “He had tobe stopped before he opened the correct box. Kahlan had been sent to ask thislong-vanished First Wizard to appoint a Seeker. After that first day when I sawher by Trunt Lake, my life was never again the same.”Into the silence, Cara asked, “So, was it love at first sight?”They were humoring him, trying to take his thoughts off the men who had beenslaughtered by a beast sent by Jagang to kill him, trying to take his mind offthe monster now coming for him.The thought struck him that maybe somewhere back in the woods around where theyhad camped, somewhere in an undiscovered place where he hadn’t looked, layKahlan’s torn remains.Such a thought was so painful to contemplate that it felt like it was crushinghis heart.Richard didn’t reach up and wipe away the tear that ran down his cheek. But witha gentle touch, Nicci did. Her hand briefly, tenderly, caressed his cheek.“I think we’d better try to get some sleep,” he said.Nicci drew back her hand and laid her head against his arm.In the darkness, Richard couldn’t seem to make his burning eyes close. Beforelong he could hear Cara’s even breathing as she surrendered to sleep. Niccisoftly pressed her cheek against his shoulder as she snuggled up close in theirshared warmth.“Nicci?” he whispered.“Yes?”“What kind of torture does Jagang use on captives?”He could feel Nicci take a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Richard, I’m notgoing to answer that question. I’m sure you have to know that Jagang is a manwho needs killing.”Richard had had to ask the question. He was relieved that Nicci was kind enoughnot to answer it.“When Zedd first gave me the sword, I told him that I would not be an assassin.I have since come to understand the principled value of preserving life throughthe task of killing evil men. I wish that driving the Imperial Order out of theNew World was as simple as killing Jagang.”“I can’t tell you how many times I wished I had killed him when I had thechance, even though you are right about it not ending the war. I wish I couldstop thinking about all the opportunities I missed. I wish I could stop thinkingabout all the things I should have done.”Richard reached around her and held her trembling shoulders.He felt her muscles slowly relax. Her breathing finally slowed as she slippedinto sleep.If he was to find Kahlan, Richard had to get the rest he needed. He closed hiseyes as another tear leaked out. He missed her so much.His thoughts lingered on that first day he saw Kahlan in the white, satinysmooth dress that he only much later found out distinguished her as the MotherConfessor. He remembered the way it hugged her shape, the way it made her lookso noble. He remembered the way her long hair cascaded down around hershoulders, framing her in the dappled forest light. He remembered looking intoher beautiful green eyes and seeing the gleam of intelligence looking back athim. He remembered feeling, from that first instant, from that first sharedgaze, as if he had always known her.He told her that there were four men following her. She asked, “Do you choose tohelp me?”Before his mind could form a thought, he heard himself say, “Yes.”He had never for an instant been sorry that he said yes.She needed help now.His last thoughts as he drifted into tormented sleep were of Kahlan."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9Ann hurriedly hung the simple tin lantern on the hook outside the door. Shefocused her Han into a bud of heat and it bloomed into a small flame in the airabove her upturned palm. As she stepped into the small room, she gently sent thelittle flame flitting onto the wick of a candle on the table. As the candle cameto life she closed the door.It had been quite a while since she had a received a message in her journeybook. She was impatient to get to it.The room was sparse. The plain plastered walls had no windows. A small table anda straight-backed, wooden chair that she had asked to have’ brought in almostfilled the space not used by the bed. Besides its use as a bedroom, the roomalso made a suitable sanctuary, a place where Ann could be alone, where shecould think, reflect, and pray. It also provided privacy for when she used thejourney book.A small plate of cheese and sliced fruit sat waiting for her on the table.Jennsen had probably left the plate before going off with Tom to stare at themoon.No matter how old Ann got, it invariably brought her a sense of warm innersatisfaction when she saw that look of love in a couple’s eyes. They alwaysseemed to think they did a fine job of hiding their feelings from others, but,as obvious as it usually was, they might as well be painted purple.At times, Ann privately regretted that she had never had a time like that withNathan, a time to indulge in complete, simple, extravagant attraction.Expressions of feelings, though, were deemed unbecoming for the Prelate.Ann paused. She wondered exactly where she had come to have such a belief. Whenshe had been a novice they didn’t exactly hold classes in which they said,“Should you ever be appointed Prelate, you must always mask your feelings.”Except disapproval, of course. A good prelate, with no more than a look, wassupposed to be capable of making people’s knees tremble uncontrollably. Shedidn’t know where she had learned that, either, but she had always seemed tohave had the knack.Maybe all along it had been the Creator’s plan for her to be the Prelate and Hehad given her the appropriate disposition for the job. How she sometimes missedit.More than that, though, she had never allowed herself to consciously considerher feelings for Nathan. He was a prophet. When she was Prelate of the Sistersof the Light and sovereign authority at the Palace of the Prophets, he had beenher prisoner—although they dressed it up in less harsh terms, trying to put amore humane face on it, but it had been no more complicated than that. It hadalways been believed that prophets were too dangerous to be allowed to run freein the world, among normal people.In confining him from a young age they had denied the existence of free will,preordaining that he would cause harm even though he would never been given thechance to make a conscious choice in his own actions. They had pronounced himguilty without benefit of a crime. It had been an archaic and irrational beliefthat Ann had unthinkingly adhered to for most of her life. At times, she didn’tlike considering what that said about her.Now that she and Nathan were both old and found themselves together—howeverimprobable that might have seemed at one time—their relationship could not bedescribed as extravagant attraction. Indeed, she had spent the vast majority ofher life enduring her displeasure with the man’s antics and seeing to it that henever escaped either his collar or his confinement in the palace, therebyinsuring his intractable behavior, thereby incurring the ire of the Sisters,which made him more unruly yet, round and round in a circle.No matter the uproar he had been able to ignite, seemingly at will, there hadalways been something about the man that made Ann smile, inwardly. At limes hewas like child. A child who was nearly a thousand years old. A child who was awizard. A child who carried the gift for prophecy. A prophet had but to open hismouth, but to utter prophecy to the uneducated masses, and it would ignite riotsat the least, war at the worst. At least, that had always been the fear.Although she was hungry, Ann pushed the plate of cheese and fruit aside. Itcould wait. Her heart fluttered with the anticipation of what news the messagefrom Verna might bring.Ann sat and scooled her chair close to the simple wooden table. She pulled outthe little leather-covered journey book and thumbed through the pages until sheagain spotted the writing. The room was small and dark. She squinted to help herbetter make out the words. She finally had to pull the fat candle a littlecloser.My dearest Ann, began the message from Verna written in the book, I hope thisfinds you and the prophet well. I know you said that Nathan was proving to be avaluable contribution to our cause, but I still worry about you being with thatman. I hope his cooperation hasn’t soured since last I heard from you. I admitto having difficulty imagining him being cooperative without a collar around hisneck. I hope you are being cautious. I’ve never known the prophet to be entirelysincere—especially when he smiles!Ann had to smile herself. She understood all too well, but Verna didn’t knowNathan the way Ann did. He could sometimes get them into trouble faster than tenboys bringing frogs to dinner, and yet, after all was said and done, after somany centuries knowing the prophet, there really wasn’t anyone with whom she hadmore in common.Ann sighed and turned her attention back to the message in the journey book.We have been kept quite busy warding off Jagang’s siege of the passes intoD’Hara, Verna wrote, but at least we have been successful. Perhaps toosuccessful. If you are there, Prelate, please answer.Ann frowned. How could one be too successful in keeping marauding hordes fromoverrunning your defenses, slaughtering your defenders, and enslaving a freepeople? She impatiently pulled the candle closer still. In truth she was quitejumpy over what Jagang was up to, now that winter had ended and the spring mudwas past.The dream walker was a patient foe. His men were from far to the south, in theOld World, and weren’t used to the winters up north in the New World. While manyhad fallen victim to the harsh conditions, vast numbers died of the diseasesthat swept through his winter encampment. Despite losing men in battles, tosickness, and by a variety of other causes, more of the invaders poured northall the time so that, despite everything, Jagang’s army inexorably continued togrow. Even so, the man did not waste any of his vast numbers in pointless andfutile winter campaigns. He didn’t care about the lives of his soldiers, but hedid care about conquering the New World, so he only moved when the weather wasnot a factor. Jagang did not take risks he didnt need to. He simply steadily,resolutely ground his enemies to dust. Bringing the world to heel was all thatmattered to him, not how long it took. He viewed the world of life through theprism of the beliefs of the Fellowship of Order. Individual life, including his,was of no importance; only the contribution that a person’s life could make tothe Order was meaningful.With such a vast army in the New World, the forces of the D’Haran Empire werenow at the mercy of what the dream walker did next. To be sure, the D’Haranforces were formidable, but they certainly weren’t enough to withstand, muchless turn back, the full weight of the seemingly endless numbers of ImperialOrder troops. At least, not until Richard did whatever he could to effect somechange in the tide of war.Prophecy said that Richard was the “pebble in the pond,” meaning that he causedripples that spread through everything, affected everything. Prophecy also said,in many different ways and in many different texts, that only if Richard ledthem in the final battle did they have a chance to triumph.If he didn’t guide them in that final battle, prophecy was clear andunambiguous; it said that all would be lost.Ann pressed her fist against the queazy pain in the pit of her stomach and thenpulled the stylus from the spine of the book that was the twin to the one Vernahad.I am here, Verna, she wrote, but you are the Prelate now. The prophet and I arelong dead and buried.It was a deception that had enabled the two of them to save a great many lives.There were times when Ann missed being Prelate and missed her flock of Sisters.She had dearly loved many of them, at least the ones who hadn’t ended up beingin truth Sisters of the Dark. The burning pain of that betrayal, not just of herbut of the Creator, never eased.Still, being free of such towering responsibility left her better able to puther mind to other, more important work. While she hated having lost her old wayof life, of being Prelate and running the Palace of the Prophets, her callingwas to a higher purpose, not to stone walls and the administration of an entirepalace of Sisters, novices, and young wizards in training. Her true calling washelping to preserve the world of life. In order for her to do that, it wasbetter that the Sisters of the Light and everyone else believed her and Nathandead.Ann sat up straighter when Verna’s writing began appearing across the page.Ann, I am comforted to have you back with me, if only in the journey book. Thereare so few of us left. I confess that sometimes I long for the days of peaceback at the palace, the times when everything seemed to he so much easier and tomake so much more sense and I only thought it was all so difficult. The worldcertainly has changed since Richard was born.Ann couldn’t argue with that. She popped a piece of cheese in her mouth and thenleaned in and began writing.I pray every day that such order and peace can again settle over the world andwe can go back to complaining about the weather.Verna, I am confused. What did you mean when you said that perhaps you were toosuccessful in defending the passes? Please explain. I await your reply.Ann leaned back in her straight-backed chair and chewed a slice of pear as shewaited. Since her journey book was twinned with the one Verna had, anythingwritten in one appeared at the same time in the other. It was one of the fewancient items of magic left from the Palace of the Prophets.Verna’s words again began moving across the blank page. Our scouts and trackersreport that Jagang has begun his move. Because he has not been able to breakthrough the passes, the emperor has split his forces and is taking an armysouth. General Meiffert had been fearing that he would do something like this.It’s not hard to guess his strategy. Jagang undoubtedly plans to take a largeforce of his troops down through the Kern Valley and then south around themountains. Once he finally is clear of all the barriers he will swing aroundinto the southern reaches of D’Hara and then head north.This is the worst possible news for us. We can’t abandon the protection of thepasses, not while part of his army lies in wait on the other side. And yet, wecannot allow Jagang’s forces to sweep up on us from the south. General Meiffertsays we will have to leave sufficient forces here to guard the passes while thebulk of our army heads south to meet the invaders.We have no choice. With half of Jagang’s force to the north, on the other sideof the passes, and half heading down to go around the mountains and come up fromthe south, that leaves the People’s Palace right in the middle. Jagang is nodoubt licking his chops over such a prospect.Ann, I’m afraid I don’t have much time. The entire camp is in an uproar,We only just learned the news that Jagang has split his army and we are rushingto strike camp and start south.I must also divide up the Sisters. So many have been lost that there are notmany left to divide. At times I feel as if we are in a contest with Jagang tosee who will be the last one with a Sister left. I fear what will happen to allthese good people if none of us survive. If not for that, I would be satisfiedto leave this world behind and join Warren in the spirit world.General Meiffert says that we can’t spare a moment and must be on our way atfirst light. I will be up the entire night with the arrangements, seeing to itthat we have sufficient men and Sisters here to defend each of the Passes, andinspecting the shields to make sure they are sound. If the Order’s northern armywere to break through up here, it would be a much quicker death for us.Unless you have something important that must be discussed right now, I’m afraidthat I must go.Ann covered her mouth with a hand as she read. The news certainly wasdisheartening. She wrote an immediate reply, so as not to inconvenience Verna.No, my dear, nothing important just now. You know that you are in my heartalways.A message came back almost immediately.The passes are narrow so we have been successful at defending them. The ImperialOrder can’t use their overwhelming power in such narrow places. I feel confidentthe passes will hold. Since Jagang is stymied by not having been able to crossthe mountains, this buys us time while he is [??h >ived??] to take an army allthe way south and then back up into D’Hara, now that he has the weather to hisadvantage. Since this is the greatest danger and threat, I will be heading southwith the army.Pray for us. We will eventually be forced to meet Jagang’s horde in the openplains where he has the room to throw the full weight of his forces against us.I am afraid that, unless something changes, we will have no chance to survivesuch a battle.I can only hope that Richard fulfills prophecy before we are all dead.Ann swallowed before answering. Verna, you have my word that I will do what Imust to see to it. Know that Nathan and I will be dedicated to the risk ofseeing prophecy fulfilled. Perhaps no one but you would truly understand thatthis is what I have devoted myself to for over half a millennium. I will notabandon my cause; I will do whatever I can to see that Richard does what only hecan. May the Creator be with you and all our brave defenders. You will all be inmy prayers every day. Have faith in the Creator, Verna. You are prelate, now.Give that faith to all of those with you.In a moment, a message began appearing. Thank you, Ann. I will check my journeybook every night as we travel to see if you have any news of Richard. I missyou. I hope we can be together again in this life.Ann carefully wrote her last reply.Me too, child. Fair journey.Ann leaned on her elbows and rubbed her temples. This was not good news, but itwas not all bad. Jagang had wanted to break through the passes and end itswiftly, but the passes held and he had finally been forced to split his armyand begin a long, grueling march. She tried to look at the bright side. Theystill had time. There were any number of things they could still try. They wouldthink of something. Richard would think of something. Prophecy had promised thathe held within him the chance for their salvation.She couldn’t allow herself to believe that evil would darken the world.A knock on the door made her jump. She pressed her hand over her racing heart.Her Han hadn’t warned her that someone was about.“Yes?”“Ann, it’s me, Jennsen,” came the muffled voice from the other side of the door.Ann replaced the stylus and tucked the journey book in her belt as she slid herchair back. She smoothed her skirts and took a deep breath to try to slow herheart back to normal.“Come in, dear,” she said as she opened the door, smiling at Richard’s sister.“Thank you for the plate of food.” She held an arm back toward the table. “Wouldyou like to share it with me?”Jennsen shook her head. “No, thank you.” Her face, framed by red ringlets, was apicture of concern. “Ann, Nathan sent me. He wants you. He was quite urgentabout it. You know how Nathan gets. You know how his eyes get all big and roundwhen he’s excited about something.”“Yes,” Ann drawled, “he does tend to get that way when he’s digging upmischief.”Jennsen blinked, looking a little startled. “I fear you may be right, he told mein no uncertain terms to come get you and bring you there straightaway.”“Nathan always expects people to squeak when he pinches.” Ann gestured for theyoung woman to lead the way. “I guess I’d best see to it. Where is the prophet,then?”Jennsen held her lantern up to light her way as she started out of the littleroom. “He’s at a graveyard.”Ann caught the sleeve of Jennsen’s dress. “A graveyard? And he wants me to cometo this graveyard?” Jennsen looked back over her shoulder and nodded. “What ishe doing in a graveyard?”Jennsen swallowed. “When I asked him that, he said he was digging up the dead.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10In a broad weeping willow growing on the grassy slope leading down to thegraveyard, a mockingbird was spending its night repeating a variety of stridentcalls meant to defend its territory against interlopers. Ordinarily, amockingbird’s calls, although intended as threats to others of its kind, toAnn’s ear could be quite lovely, but in the dead-still quiet of night, suchpiercing whistles, chatters, and whoops were jarring to her nerves. She couldhear another mockingbird in the distance making similar threats. Even the birdscouldn’t achieve peace.Plowing through the long, wild grasses, Jennsen pointed as she held the lanternup with her other hand so that Ann could see her way. “Tom said that we wouldfind him down there.”Sweating from the long hike, Ann peered down into the darkness. She couldn’timagine what the prophet was up to. In all the time that she had known the manhe had never done such a strange thing. He had done any number of strangethings, to be sure, but this just wasn’t one of them. As old as he was, onewould think that he would want to avoid spending time in a graveyard any soonerthan he had to.Ann followed Richard’s younger sister as she started down the hill, trying tokeep up without running. It seemed like they had already walked half the nightand she was winded. Ann hadn’t known of this graveyard, all but forgotten out ina distant, uninhabited expanse of wilderness. She wished that she had thought tobring along some of the food sitting on the plate back in her room.“Are you sure Tom is still down here?”Jennsen looked back over her shoulder. “He should be. Nathan wanted him to standguard.”“For what? To fight off the other body snatchers?”“I don’t know, maybe,” Jennsen said without so much as a hint of a giggle.Ann wasn’t very good at making people laugh. She was good at making their kneestremble, but she just wasn’t all that good at jokes. She guessed that agraveyard on a dark night wasn’t a good place for jokes. It certainly was a goodplace to make the knees tremble.“Maybe Nathan just wanted company,” Ann suggested.“I don’t think that was it.” Jennsen found a fallen section in the split-railfence that surrounded the place of the dead and stepped over it. “Nathan askedme to bring you out here and he wanted Tom to stay and stand guard over thegraveyard, I think to make sure there was no one around that he didn’t knowabout.”Nathan liked being in charge; Ann guessed that being a gifted Rahl he could dono less. It was always possible that the whole thing was a pretense just to getJennsen, Tom, and Ann to run around doing his bidding. The prophet was given toa sense of drama and a graveyard did tend to set a mood.Actually, right then, Ann would have been happy were it nothing more than someidiosyncratic diversion of Nathan’s. Unfortunately, she had the queazy feelingthat it was something not at all so simple, or so innocuous as a bit oftheatrics.In all the centuries she had known him, Nathan had at times been secretive,deceptive, and occasionally dangerous, but never to evil ends—although thathadn’t always been apparent at the time. During most of his captivity at thePalace of the Prophets he had tried the Sisters’ patience until they were readyto scream and tear out their hair, yet he wasn’t maliciously willful orcontemptuous of good people. He had an abiding hatred of tyranny and an almostchildlike glee about life. No matter how exasperating the man could be at times,and he could be exasperating in the extreme, Nathan had a good heart.Almost since the beginning, despite the circumstances, he had been Ann’sconfidant and ally against the Keeper getting a foothold in the world of lifeand against evil people having their way over the innocent. He had worked hardto help stop Jagang. He had, after all, been the one to first show her aprophecy about Richard, five hundred years before he would be born.Ann found herself wishing that it wasn’t dark, and that they weren’t in agraveyard. And that Jennsen didn’t have such long legs.It suddenly occurred to Ann why Nathan would need Tom to stand guard and “makesure no one was around that they didn’t know about,” as Jennsen had put it. Justlike Jennsen, the people in Bandakar were pristinely ungifted. They were devoidof that infinitesimal spark of the Creator’s gift carried by everyone else inthe world. That essential connection made everyone else subject to the realityand nature of magic. But for these people magic did not exist.The absence of such an inherent, elemental nucleus of the gift not only made thepristinely ungifted immune to magic, but since they could not interact with whatto them did not exist, it also made them invisible to the power of the gift.If even one parent possessed the pristinely ungifted trait, then it was alwayspassed on to the offspring. These people had originally been banished topreserve the gift in mankind’s nature. It had been a terrible solution, to besure, but as a result the gift had survived in the human race. Had such asolution not been undertaken, magic would long ago have ceased to exist.Because prophecy was magic, it too was blind to these people. No book ofprophecy had ever had anything at all to say about the pristinely ungifted, orabout the future of mankind and magic now that Richard had discovered thesepeople and ended the banishment. What would happen now was completely unknown.Ann supposed that Richard would have it no other way. He did not exactlyenthusiastically embrace prophecy. Despite what prophecy had to say about him,Richard by and large discounted it. He believed in free will. He took a dim viewof the notion that there were things about himself that were predestined.In all things in life, and in magic especially, there had to be balance. In away, Richard’s acts of free will were the balance to prophecy. He was the centerof a vortex of forces. With Richard, prophecy was attempting to predict theunpredictable. And yet, it had to.Most troubling was that Richard’s free will made him a wild card in prophecy,even those prophecies in which he was the subject. He was chaos among patterns,disorder among organization, and as capricious as lightning. And yet, he wasguided by truth and driven by reason, not whim or chance, nor was he arbitrary.That he could be chaos among prophecy and at the same time be completelyrational was an enigma to her.Ann worried greatly about Richard because such contradictory aspects of thegifted were occasionally a prelude to delusional behavior. The last thing theywould want was a leader who was delusional.But all of that was academic. The central problem was that while there was stilllime they had to find some way to make sure he took up the cause fated to him inthe prophecies and to fulfil his destiny. If they failed, if he failed, then allwas lost.Verna’s message sat like the shadow of death in the back of Ann’s mind.Having spotted their light, Tom appeared out of the darkness, sprinting Throughthe long grass to meet them. “There you are,” he said to Ann. “Nathan will behappy that you’re finally here. Come on and I’ll show you the way.”By the brief glimpse she got in the weak yellow light from the lantern, Tom’sface looked troubled.The big D’Haran led them deeper into the graveyard, where in areas there wererows of gently mounded graves outlined in stones. These had in be newer, becausemost of what Ann could see was nothing but tall grass that over time coveredover stones and the graves they marked. In one area there were a few smallgranite gravestones. They were so weathered it could only be that they wereancient. Some of the graves were marked with simple boards with names carved inthem. Most such markers had long ago turned to dust, leaving much of thegraveyard looking like nothing more than a grassy field.“Do you know what the fat bugs are that are making all the noise?” Jennsen askedTom.“I’m not sure,” Tom said. “I’ve never seen them before. They suddenly seem to beall over the place.”Ann smiled to herself. “They’re cicadas.”Jennsen frowned back over her shoulder. “They’re what?”“Cicadas. You wouldn’t know what they are. At the last molt you would haveprobably still been a toddler, too young to remember. The life cycle of thesecicadas with the red eyes is seventeen years.”“Seventeen years!” Jennsen said in astonishment. “You mean they only come outevery seventeen years?”“Without fail. After the females mate with these noisy fellows, they will laytheir eggs in twigs. When they hatch, the nymphs will drop from the trees andburrow into the ground, not to emerge for another seventeen years where theirlife as adults will be brief.”Jennsen and Tom murmured their amazement as they moved on into the graveyard.Ann couldn’t see much of anything else by the light coming from Jennsen’slantern, except the dark shapes of trees moving in the occasional muggy breeze.As the three of them quietly slipped through the graveyard, cicadas chirpedincessantly from the darkness all around. Ann used her Han to try to sense ifanyone else was about, but she didn’t feel anyone other than Tom and somewherein the distance one other person, no doubt Nathan. Since Jennsen was one of thepristinely ungifted, she was intangible to Ann’s Han.Like Richard, Jennsen had been fathered by Darken Rahl. Births of the pristinelyungifted, such as Jennsen’s, had been an unexpected and random side effect ofthe magic of the bond carried by every gifted Lord Rahl. In ancient times, whenthat trait began to spread, the solution had been to banish the pristinelyungifted, sealing them away in the forgotten land of Bandakar. After that, allungifted offspring of the Lord Rahl were put to death.Unlike any past Lord Rahl, Richard had been jubilant to discover that he had asister. He would never allow her to be put to death for the nature of her birth,nor would he allow her and those like her to be forced into banishment.Even though Ann had been around these people for some time now, she was stillnot used to how disorienting it could be. Even when one of them was standingright in front of her, Ann’s ability said that there was no one there. It was ahaunting sort of blindness, a loss of one of her senses that she had alwaystaken for granted.Jennsen had to take long strides to keep pace with Tom. To keep up with the twoof them, Ann had to trot.And then, as they came around a small knoll, a stone monument loomed up intoview. The light from the lantern lit one side of a rectangular stone base thatwas a little taller than Ann, but not as tall as Jennsen. The coarse stone washeavily weathered and pitted, with stone molding carved around recessed squareson the sides. If it had ever been polished, the stone no longer showed anyevidence of it. As the lantern light swept across the surface, it revealedlayers of dirty discoloration from great age as well as the mottled growth ofmustard-colored lichen. Atop the imposing base sat a large carved urn with stonegrapes hanging out over one side. Grapes were a favorite of Nathan’s.As Tom led them around the front of the stone monument Ann was astonished to seethat the rectangle of stone sat off [??killer??].On the far side, faint light oozed up from beneath it.It appeared that the entire monument had been pivoted aside, revealing steepstone steps that led down into the ground, down into the soft glow of light.Tom gave them both a meaningful look. “He’s down in there.”Jennsen leaned over a little and peered into the steep cavity. “Nathan is downthere? Down those steps?”“I’m afraid so,” Tom told her.“What is this place?” Ann asked.Tom shrugged apologetically. “I’m afraid I have no idea. I didn’t even know thiswas here until just a little while ago when Nathan showed me where I could findhim. He told me to send you down just as soon as you got here. He was prettyinsistent about it. He doesn’t want anyone knowing this place is here. He wantedme to stand lookout and keep any people away from the graveyard, although Ireally don’t think anyone ever comes out here anymore, especially at night. TheBandakaran people aren’t the kind to go looking for an adventure.”“Unlike Nathan,” Ann muttered. She patted Tom’s muscled arm. “Thank you, my boy.Best do as Nathan said and stand watch. I’ll go down and see what this is allabout.”“We’ll both go,” Jennsen said."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11Driven by worried curiosity, Ann immediately started down the dusty steps.Jennsen followed close on her heels. A landing turned them to the right and downanother flight. At a third landing, a long run of stairs turned to the left. Thedusty stone walls were uncomfortably close together. The ceiling hunkered low,even for Ann; Jennsen had to crouch. It felt to Ann like she was being swalloweddown though a moldering guild into the graveyard’s belly.At the bottom of the steps she halted to stare in disbelief. Jennsen lei out alow whistle. Beyond was not a dungeon, but a strange, twisting room unlike anyAnn had ever seen. The stone walls zigged and zagged at odd angles, each of itsown design and independently of the others. Plastering covered some of the stonewalls. In a series of the convoluted angles, the whole room snaked off into thedistance, disappearing around projections and pointed corners.The place had a strange orderly disorder about it that Ann found somewhatunsettling. Dark niches here and there in the plastered walls were surroundedwith faded blue symbols and decorations that had flaked off in places. Therewere words as well, but they were too old and dull to be legible without carefulstudy. Bookshelves as well as ancient wooden tables, all layered in dirt, sat inseveral places up against the angled walls.Dead-still cobwebs, heavy with dust, hung everywhere like drapes meant todecorate the room beneath the graves. Dozens of candles sat on tables and insome of the empty niches, giving the whole place a soft, otherworldly glow, asif all the dead above Ann’s head must periodically descend to this place todiscuss matters important only to the deceased, and to welcome new members intotheir eternal order.Beyond the diaphanous curtains of dust-choked cobwebs, amongst four massivetables that had been dragged together, stood Nathan. Disorderly stacks of bookswere piled high all around him on the tables.“Ah, there you are,” Nathan called from his book foil.Ann cast a sidelong glance at Jennsen.“I had no idea that this place was down here,” the young woman said in answer tothe question that remained unasked on Ann’s tongue. Points of candlelight dancedin her blue eyes. “I didn’t even know this place existed.”Ann looked around again. “I doubt anyone in the last few thousand years knewthis place existed. I wonder how he found it.”Nathan snapped a book shut and placed it on a pile behind him. His straightwhite hair brushed his broad shoulders as he turned back. His hooded, dark azureeyes fixed on Ann.Ann caught the unspoken meaning in Nathan’s gaze. She turned to Jennsen. “Whydon’t you go up and wait with Tom, my dear. It can be a lonely job standingwatch in a graveyard.”Jennsen looked disappointed, but seemed to understand their need to be left totheir business. She flashed a smile. “Sure. I’ll be right up top if you needanything.”As the sound of Jennsen’s footsteps on the stone stairs dwindled away into adistant, echoing whisper, Ann struck a weaving course through the vails ofcobwebs.“Nathan, what in the world is this place?”“No need to whisper,” he said. “See how the walls turn at all those odd angles?It cuts the echo.”Ann was a little surprised to hear that he was right. Usually, the echo in stonerooms was annoying, but this odd twisting room had the hush of the dead.“There’s something strangely familiar about the shape of this place.”“Concealment spell,” the prophet said, offhandedly.Ann frowned. “What?”“The configuration of the whole thing is in the form of a concealment spell.” Hegestured to each side when he saw the puzzled look she gave him. “It’s not thelayout of the entire place, the placement of rooms and the course of the varioushalls and passageways—like at the People’s Palace—that is the spell-form, butrather it’s the precise line of the walls themselves that make up thespell-form, as if someone drew the spell large on the ground and then simplybuilt the walls touching right against that line before hollowing out themiddle. Because the walls are a uniform thickness, that means that the outsideof the walls are also the shape of the spell-form, so that lends lo reinforcethe whole thing. Quite clever, actually.”For such a spell to work, it had probably been drawn in blood and with the aidof human bones. There would have been ample supply of those at hand.“Someone certainly went to a lot of trouble,” Ann said as she appraised thespace again. This time she began to recognize some of the shapes and angles inopposition. “What exactly is this place used for?”“I’m not entirely sure,” he admitted with a sigh. “I don’t know if these bookswere meant to be buried with the dead for all time, or they were being hidden,or there was some other purpose.” Nathan beckoned with his hand. “This way. Letme show you something.”Ann followed him through several of the zigzags, around turns, and past yet moreshelves lined with dusty books, until they reached an area of niches three highto each side.Nathan leaned an elbow against the wall. “Look there,” he said as he pointed along finger downward, indicating one of the low, arched openings in the stonewall.Ann stooped and peered inside. It contained a body.All that was left were bones clothed in dusty tatters of robes. A leather beltcircled the waist while a strap crossed over one shoulder. Skeletal arms werefolded over the chest. Gold chains hung around the neck. Ann could see by theglint of light off the medallion on one of the chains that Nathan must havelifted it for a look, and in so doing his fingers had cleaned off the dust.“Any idea who he is?” she asked as she straightened and folded her hands beforeherself.Nathan leaned down close to her.“I believe he was a prophet.”“I thought there was no need to whisper.”He arched an eyebrow as he straightened his frame to its considerable height.“There are a number of other people interred here.” He flicked a hand off towardthe darkness. “Back that way.”Ann wondered if they could all be prophets as well. “And the books?”Nathan leaned down again, and whispered again. “Prophecy.”She frowned and looked back the way they had come. “Prophecy? You mean all ofthem? Those are all books of prophecy?”“Most of them.”Excitement bubbled up through her. Books of prophecy were invaluable. They werethe rarest of jewels. Such books could offer guidance, provide answers theyneeded, spare them futile endeavors, fill in gaps in their knowledge. Perhapsmore than at any other time in history, they needed those answers. They neededto know more about the final battle in which Richard was supposed to lead them.As of yet they had not discovered when this battle was to take place. With thefrustrating vagary of prophecy, it could yet be many years off. For that matter,it was even possible that it was not to take place until Richard was an old man.With all the difficulties they had faced in the past several years, they couldonly hope that it was still many years off and they would have time to prepare.Prophecy could help with that.The vaults at the Palace of the Prophets had been filled with thousands ofvolumes of prophecy, but they had all been destroyed along with the palace toprevent it from falling into the hands of Emperor Jagang. Better to lose suchworks for all time than allow evil to look upon their pages.But no one knew of this place. This place was hidden beneath a concealmentspell. The dizzying possibilities spun through Ann’s mind.“Nathan… this is wonderful.”She turned and looked up at the man. He was watching her in a way that made herfidgety. She reached out and placed a hand on his arm.“Nathan, this is more than we could ever have hoped.”“This is something more than that,” he said cryptically as he started hack.“There are books here that make me doubt my sanity,” he said with a sullenflourish of an arm.“Ah,” Ann quipped as she followed along in his wake, “verification at last.”He halted and turned a glare on her. “This is nothing to joke about.”Ann felt goose flesh ripple up her arms. “Show me then,” she said in a serioustone. “What is it you’ve found?”He shook his head, seeming to lose his momentary flash of ill humor. “I’m noteven sure.” His usual flamboyance was nowhere in evidence as he moved in amongthe tables he’d dragged together. His dark mood turned guarded. “I’ve beensorting the books.”Ann wanted to hurry him along and get to the meat of his discovery, but she knewthat when he was troubled it was best to let Nathan explain things in his ownway, especially when there was arcane speculation involved.“Sorting them?”He nodded. “These here in this pile don’t appear to be of any real use to us.Most are prophecy long since outdated, contain only irrelevant records, or arein unknown languages—things like that.”He turned and slapped a hand to the top of another stack. Dust boiled up. “Thesehere are all books that we had back at the palace.” He swept his hand back andforth in front of the stacks of books piled high on the table behind him. “Allof them. This whole tableful.”Her eyes wide, Ann glanced at the shelves and niches going back along thestrange room. “There are a great many more books other than these you have hereon the tables. This is only a fraction of them.”“Indeed. I haven’t had a chance to even begin to look at them all yet. I finallydecided that I’d better send Tom off to find you. I wanted you to see what I’vediscovered. That, and there is a lot of reading to do. I’ve been pulling out onebook at a time, checking through it, and placing it in one of the piles on thesetables.”Ann wondered how many books could still be viable, could still be usable, alterthousands of years underground. She had found books before that had been ruinedby the effects of time and the elements, especially mildew and water. She peeredaround, inspecting the walls and ceiling, bill she saw no evidence of waterleaking through.“At first glance, none of these books look to be damaged by water. How can thisplace underground be so dry? It would seem that water would seep in through thejoints in the stone and make everything down here wet and moldy. I can hardlybelieve that the books appear to be in such good condition.”“Appear being the operative word,” Nathan said under his breath.She turned back to scowl at him. “What do you mean?”He waved a hand irritably. “In a moment. In a moment. The interesting thing is,the ceiling and walls are sheathed in lead to help keep out the water. The placealso has a shield of magic around it for even more protection. The entrance,too, was shielded.”“But the Bandakar people have no magic and their land was sealed off. There wasno one with magic to shield against.”“That seal to their banished land finally failed, though,” Nathan reminded her.“Yes, that’s right, it did.” Ann tapped a finger against her chin. “I wonder howthat happened.”Nathan shrugged. “How isn’t so important for now, although I am concerned aboutit.”He flipped a hand, as if setting aside the issue. “For the moment, that it didis what’s meaningful. Whoever put these books here wanted them hidden andprotected—and they went to a great deal of trouble to insure that it leyremained that way. The ungifted people here wouldn’t be hindered by shields, theweight of the stone monument would be an obstacle in and of itself, but theywould have no reason to want to move it in the first place unless they had agood reason to believe something was under it. What would cause them to suspectsuch a thing? The fact that this place has remained undisturbed for thousands ofyears proves that they never realized that this place was down here. I believethat the shields were placed to ward any invaders who might eventually make itinto Bandakar, like Jagang’s men did.”“That makes sense, I suppose,” she murmured as she considered it. “Not reallyexpecting that the seal to Bandakar would ever be breached, the shields were asimple act of precaution.”“Or prophecy,” Nathan added.Ann look up. “There is that.” It would take a wizard of Nathan’s ability tobreach such shields. Even Ann didn’t have the ability necessary for someshields. She knew, too, that there were shields placed in ancient times thatcould only be passed with the aid of Subtractive Magic.“It’s also possible that these books were simply placed here as a way ofsafekeeping such valuable works—in case anything happened to others of theirkind.”“You really think they would go to this much trouble to do such a thing?” sheasked.“Well, all the books at the Palace of the Prophets were lost, now, weren’t they?Books of prophecy are always at risk. Some have been destroyed, some have falleninto enemy hands, and some have simply disappeared. Places like this provide abackup for those other works—especially if prophecy foretells the need of such acontingency.”“I guess you could be right. I have heard about rare finds of prophecy that hadbeen secreted away to preserve them, or to keep innocent eyes from viewingthem.” She shook her head as her gaze scanned the room. “Still, I’ve never heardof any find to approach the likes of this one.”Nathan handed her a book. Its ancient red leather cover was laded nearly tobrown. Even so, there was something familiar-looking about it, about the fadedgilded ribs on the spine. She lifted the cover and the first blank page.“My, my, my,” Ann softly mused as she saw the title. “The Glendhill Book ofDeviation Theory. How very wonderful to hold this in my hands again.” She closedthe cover and clasped the book to her breast. “It’s like an old friend come backfrom the dead.”The book had been one of her favorite volumes on forked prophecy. Because it wasa pivotal volume that held valuable information about Richard, she had studiedit and referred to it so often over the centuries as she waited for him to beborn that she practically knew it by memory. She had been heartbroken that ithad to be destroyed along with all the rest of the books in the vaults at thePalace of the Prophets. There was still a great deal of information in it aboutthe possibilities of what was yet to come.Nathan plucked another volume from a stack and waggled it before her as hearched an eyebrow. “Precession and Binary Inversions.”“No!” She snatched it from his hands. “It can’t be.”None of the accounts could ever say for sure that the elusive volume had in factever really existed. Ann herself had hunted for it, at Nathan’s request,whenever she traveled. She’d also had trusted Sisters look for it whenever theywent on a journey. There had been leads, but none of the clues ever resulted inanything but dead ends.She looked up at the tall prophet. “Is this real? Many accounts deny that itever really existed.”“Missing, according to some. A mere myth, according to others. I read a littleof it and by the branches of prophecy it fills in, it can only be genuine—or abrilliant fake. I’d have to study it further to tell which, but from what I’veseen, so far, I tend to believe it’s genuine. Besides, what purpose would therebe in hiding a fake? Fakes are generally created in order to exchange them forgold.”That was true enough. “And here it was all the time. Buried beneath the bones.”“Along with what I suspect may be a great many other volumes that are just asvaluable.”Ann clicked her tongue as she again gazed about at all the books, her sense ofawe growing by the moment. “Nathan, you’ve uncovered a treasure. A treasure ofincalculable value.”“Perhaps,” He said. When she shot him a puzzled frown, he lifted a hefty tomeoff the top of another stack. “You won’t even believe what this is. Here. Openit and read the title yourself.”Ann reluctantly set down Precession and Binary Inversions in order to take theheavy book from Nathan. She set it on the table, too, and bent close. With greatcare, she lifted open the cover. She blinked, then straightened.“Selleron’s Seventh Task!” She gapped at the prophet. “But I thought there wasonly one copy and it was destroyed.”One side of Nathan’s mouth cocked with a quirky smile. He held up another book“Twelve Words Left for Reason. I found Destiny’s Twin as well.” He waggled afinger at a pile. “It’s in there somewhere.”Ann’s jaw worked for a moment until the words finally came. “I thought we hadlost those prophecies for all time.” The odd smile still on his lips, he onlywatched her. She reached out and gripped his arm. “Could we be so fortunate thatthere really were copies made?”Nathan nodded, confirming her guess. The smile ghosted away.“Ann,” he said as he handed her Twelve Words Left for Reason, “take a lookthrough here and tell me what you think.”Puzzled by the grim expression that had settled on his face, she placed the bookin a clear spot and began carefully turning pages. The writing was a littlefaded, but no more so than any book its age. For as old as it was, it was stillin good condition and quite legible.Twelve Words Left for Reason was a book containing twelve core prophecies and anumber of ancillary branches. Those ancillary branches, when carefullycross-referenced, connected actual events to a number of other books of prophecythat were otherwise impossible to place chronologically. The twelve coreprophecies actually weren’t all that important. It was the ancillary branchesthat served to link other trunks and branches in the tree of prophecy that madeTwelve Words Left for Reason so invaluable.Chronology was often the most trying problem facing those working with prophecy.It was often impossible to tell if a prophecy was going to unfold the next day,or the next century. Events were in a constant state of flux. The setting ofprophecy in the context of time was essential, not just to know when aparticular prophecy was to become viable, but because what was of overridingimportance next year might be nothing more than an unimportant minor event ifset in the environment of the year after. Unless they knew which year theprophecy took place, they didn’t know if it foretold danger or simply a matterof note.Most prophets, when they set down their prophecy, left it up to those who wouldcome later to fit it into its proper place in real-world events, There was noclear consensus on whether this had been done deliberately, throughcarelessness, or because the prophet, in the throes of having his visions, hadnever realized how important, and difficult, it would later be tochronologically place his vision. She had often observed with Nathan that aprophecy was so crystal-clear to the prophet himself that he simply failed tocomprehend how formidable a task it would be for others to read and fit into thepuzzle of life.“Wait,” Nathan said as she turned the pages. “Go back a page.”Ann glanced up at him and then flipped the vellum back.“There,” Nathan said as he tapped a finger to the page. “Look here. There areseveral lines missing.”Ann peered at the small gap in the writing, but didn’t see what was someaningful about it. Books often had spaces left blank for a wide variety ofreasons.“So?”Rather than answer, he rolled his hand, motioning for her to go on. She startedflipping over the pages. Nathan thrust his hand in to stop her and tappedanother blank spot so she would note it. He then urged her to continue.Ann noticed that the blank places became more frequent. Finally, she came toentire pages that were blank. Even that, though, was not unheard of. There wereany number of books that simply ended in the middle. It was thought that theprophet who had been working on such books had most likely died and those comingafter didn’t want to interfere with what a predecessor had done, or perhaps theywanted to work on branches of prophecy which were more interesting or relevantto them.“Twelve Words Left for Reason is one of the few books of prophecy that ischronological,” he reminded her in a soft voice.She knew that, of course. That was what made the book such a valuable tool. Shecouldn’t imagine, though, why he had felt it important lo point it out.“Well,” Ann said with a sigh as she reached the end, “it is odd, I suppose. Whatdo you make of the blank places?”Rather than answer her directly, he handed her another book. “Subdivision ofBurkett’s Root. Take a look.”Ann turned the pages of yet another priceless find, looking for something out ofthe ordinary. She came across three blank pages followed by more prophecy.She was growing impatient with Nathan’s game. “What am I supposed to see?”Nathan was a moment in answering. When he finally did, his voice had thatquality about it that tended to run shivers up her spine.“Ann, we had that book down in the vaults.”She was still not following what was obviously of critical importance In him.“Yes, we did. I remember it quite well.”“The copy we had didn’t have those blank pages.”She frowned and then turned back to the book. She leafed through the pages againuntil she found the empty spot.“Well,” she said as she studied the place where the prophecy ended and thenwhere an entirely new branch of prophecy resumed after the empty pages, “maybewhoever made this copy, for some reason, decided not to include some of it.Perhaps they had sound reason to believe that the particular branch had been adead end and, rather than include dead wood in the tree of prophecy, they simplyleft it out. Such pruning is not uncommon. Then, because they didn’t want tomake it appear they were trying to deceive anyone, they went ahead and left theappropriate space blank to denote the deletion.”She looked up. The prophet’s azure eyes were fixed on her. Ann felt sweattrickle down between her shoulder blades.“Take a look at The Glendhill Book of Deviation Theory,” he said in a quietvoice without taking his penetrating gaze from her.Ann broke contact with that gaze and pulled the copy of The Glendhill Book ofDeviation Theory close. She flipped through the pages as she had done with theprevious book, if a little faster.There were blank pages, only more of them.She shrugged. “Not a very accurate copy, I’d say.”Nathan impatiently reached in with a long arm and turned the stack of pages backto the front.There, on a page at the beginning, all alone, was the author’s mark.“Dear Creator,” Ann whispered when she saw the little symbol. It still glimmeredwith the magic the author had invested in his mark. She fell goose bumps tingleup from her toes. “This is isn’t a copy. It’s the original.’^“That’s right. If you recall, the one we had in the vaults was a copy.”“Yes, I remember that ours was a copy.”She had assumed this one as well had been one of a number of copies. Many of thebooks of prophecy were copies, but that didn’t diminish their value. They werechecked and marked by respected scholars who then left their own mark to vouchfor the copy’s accuracy. A book of prophecy was valued for the precision andveracity of its content, not because it was the original. It was the prophecyitself that was valuable, not the hand that had set it down.Still, to see the original of a book she loved as much as she love thisparticular volume was a memorable experience. This was the actual book, writtenin the hand of the prophet who had given these precious prophecies.“Nathan… what can I say. This is a personal delight for me. You know how muchthis book means to me.”Nathan look a patient breath. “And the blank pages?”Ann shrugged with one shoulder. “I don’t know. I’m not really prepared toventure a guess. What are you getting at?”“Look at the place where the blanks fit into the text.”Ann turned her attention back to the book. She read a little of the text beforeone of the blank areas, then read some of what followed. It was a prophecy aboutRichard. She randomly picked another blank place, reading before the blank areaand after. It was another section about Richard.“It would seem,” she said as she studied a third place, “that the blanks appearin places where it talks about Richard.”Nathan was getting more edgy looking by the moment. “That’s only because most ofThe Glendhill Book of Deviation Theory is about Richard. That pattern of blankpages associated with him doesn’t hold true when you start looking at the otherbooks.”Ann lifted her arms and let them fall to her sides. “Then I give up. I don’t seewhat you see.”“It’s what we’re not seeing. It’s the blank places that are the problem.”“What makes you say that?”“Because,” he said with a little more force in his voice, “there is somethingquite odd about those blank sections.”Ann pushed a stray wisp of gray hair back into the bun she always wore at theback of her head. She was becoming frazzled.“Like what?”“You tell me,” he said. “I would bet that you could practically quote TheGlendhill Book of Deviation Theory”Ann shrugged. “Perhaps.”“Well, I can quote it. The copy we had back in the vaults, anyway. I wentthrough this book, testing it against my memory.” For some reason, Ann’s stomachwas churning with anxiety. She began lo dread that the copy they had back in thevaults at the palace might have had fraudulent prophecy filling in what theoriginal author had left blank. That was almost too overwhelming a deception tocontemplate.“And what did you discover?” she asked.“That I can quote this original exactly. No more, no less.”Ann sighed in relief. “Nathan, that’s wonderful. That means that our copy wasn’tfilled with fabricated prophecy. Why would you be troubled because you can’tremember blank places? They are blank, there is nothing there. There is nothingto remember.”“The copy we had back at the palace didn’t have any blank places.”Ann blinked as she thought back. “No, it didn’t. I remember it well.” Sheoffered the prophet a warm smile. “But don’t you see? If you can quote this one,no more or no less, and you learned it from our copy, then that means thatwhoever made the copy simply pulled the text together rather than include themeaningless blank places left by the original prophet. The prophet probably leftblank places as a provision in case he had any further visions about theprophecies and he needed to add to what he had already written. Apparently, henever had that need, so the blanks remain.”“I know that there were more pages in our copy.”‘I’m not following you, then.”This time it was Nathan who threw up his hands. “Ann, don’t you see? Here, lookat the book.” He turned it toward her. “Look at this next-lo-last branch ofprophecy. It’s one page and then six blank pages. Do you remember any branch ofprophecy in our copy of The Glendhill book of Deviation Theory that was only onepage? No. None were this short. They were too complex. You know that there ismore to this prophecy, I know there is more to the prophecy, but my mind is asblank as these pages. What was there is not only missing from the book, but it’smissing from my mind as well. Unless you can quote me the rest of the prophecythat you know should be there, then it’s missing from your mind as well.”“Nathan, that’s just not—I mean, I don’t see how…” Ann sputtered in confusion.“Here,” he said as he snatched a book from behind him. “Collected Origins. Youmust remember this.”Ann reverently lifted the book from his hands. “Oh, Nathan, of course I rememberit. How could one forget such a short but beautiful book.”Collected Origins was an exceedingly rare prophecy in that it was writtenentirely in story form. Ann loved the story. She had a soft spot for romance,although she never admitted it to anyone. Since this tale of romance wasactually a prophecy, that made it an official requirement that she be familiarwith it.She smiled as she lifted open the cover of the small book.The pages were blank.All of them.“Tell me,” Nathan said in that quietly commanding, deep Rahl voice, “what isCollected Origins about?”Ann opened her mouth, but no words would come forth.“Tell me, then,” Nathan went on in that quietly powerful voice of his thatseemed as if it could crack stone, “a single line of this beloved volume. Tellme who it is about. Tell me how it started, how it ended, or anything in themiddle.”Her mind was stark naked blank.As she stared up into Nathan’s cutting gaze, he leaned a little closer. “Tell meone single thing you remember from this book.”“Nathan,” she finally managed to whisper, her own eyes wide, “you often used tokeep this book in your rooms. You know it better than I do. What do you rememberabout Collected Origins?”“Not… one… thing.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12Ann swallowed. “Nathan, how can we both not remember a book we love as much aswe do this one? And why is it that the specific parts we both don’t remembercorrespond to the blank spots?”“Now, that is a very good question.”An idea suddenly hit her. She gasped in a breath. “A spell. It has to be thatthese books were spelled.”Nathan made a face. “What?”“Many books are spelled to protect the information. I’ve not encountered it witha book of prophecy but it’s common enough in books of instruction on magic. Thisplace was designed with the intent of concealment. Perhaps that’s what ishappening with the information protected here.”Such a spell would be activated when anyone but the right person with therequired power opened it. Spells of that nature were sometimes even keyed tospecific individuals. The usual method of protection if the wrong person saw thebook was to erase from their memory everything they’d seen in it. They would seeit and at the same time forget it. The effect in one’s mind was to blank out thetext.Nathan didn’t answer, but his scowl softened as he considered her idea. Shecould tell by his expression that he doubted her theory was the answer hut heapparently didn’t want to argue the point just then, probably because he hadsomething more important that he wanted to go on to.Sure enough, he tapped a finger on top of a small stack of books standing all bythemselves. “These books,” he said with a weighty undertone, “are predominantlyabout Richard. I’ve never seen most of them before. I find that alarming, thatsuch books would be hidden away in a place like this. Most have extensivestretches of blank pages.”For that many books of prophecy, especially about Richard, not to have been inthe Palace of the Prophets was indeed alarming. For five centuries she hadscoured the world for copies of any book she could find that contained anythingat all about Richard.Ann scratched an eyebrow as she considered the implications. “Were you able tolearn anything?”Nathan picked up the volume on the top and flipped the book open. “Well, for onething, this symbol, here, troubles me greatly. It’s an exceedingly rare form ofprophecy, undertaken while the prophet was under siege by a storm of revelation.Such graphic prophecies are drawn in the heat of a powerful vision, when writingwould take too long and interrupt the rush of what is rampaging through hismind.”Ann was only vaguely aware of such representational prophecy. She recalled a fewfrom the vaults at the palace. Nathan had never before mentioned to her whatthey had been, and no one else had known. Yet another of Nathan’s littlethousand year old secrets.She bent close and studied the intricate drawing that took for itself most of apage. There were no straight lines in it at all, only curved swirls and arcsthat eddied all around in a circular design that somehow seemed almost alive.Here and there the pen had dug violently into the surface of the vellum,ploughing up parallel rows of fibers where the two halves of the pen’s point hadspread under the pressure. Ann lifted the book closer to a candle and carefullyexamined a curious place that was particularly rough. She saw in the ancientdried bed of an inky pool a fine, pointed sliver of metal: one side of the pen’spoint had broken off where it had been stabbed into the page. It was stillembedded there. Right after, the cleaner marks of a fresh pen began anew,although they were no less forceful.Nothing in the ink drawing represented any identifiable subject—it appeared tobe completely nonobjective—and yet it was for some reason so gravely disturbingthat it made her hackles lift. It seemed as if the drawing was almostrecognizable but its meaning was just outside of her conscious awareness.“What is it?” She laid the book on the table, open to the drawing. “What does itmean?”Nathan stroked a finger along his strong jaw. “It’s rather hard to explain.There are no precise words to describe what comes as a picture in my mind when Iview it.”“Do you think,” Ann asked with exaggerated patience as she clasped her hands,“that you could make an effort to describe to me as best you can the picture inyour mind?”Nathan viewed her askance. “The only words I can think of that fit are ‘Thebeast comes.’““The beast?”“Yes. I don’t know what the impression means. The prophecy is partially cloaked,either deliberately or perhaps because it’s meant to represent something I’venever encountered before, or maybe even because it’s linked to the blank pagesand without their associated text the drawing won’t fully come to life for me.”“What is it that this beast is coming to do?”Nathan flipped the cover closed so that she could see the title: A Pebble in thePond.Cold sweat broke out across her brow.“The symbol is a graphic warning,” he said.Prophecy often referred to Richard as the “pebble in the pond.” The text of sucha volume would probably be of incalculable value. If only it weren’t missing.“You mean, it’s a warning for Richard that some kind of beast is coming?”Nathan nodded. “That’s about as much as I can get from this—that and a vagueimpression of the ghastly aura around the thing.”“Around the beast.”“Yes. The supporting text preceding the drawing would have been critical tounderstanding it better, to being able to comprehend the nature of this beast,but that text is missing. The branches after are blank as well so there is noway to place the warning contextually or chronologically. For all I know, itcould be something he has already faced and defeated, or something that in hisold age might defeat him. Without at least some of the supporting prophecy or acontext there simply isn’t any way to tell.”Chronology was vital to understanding prophecy, but just from the dread that shefelt when viewing the drawing, Ann didn’t believe it was anything Richard hadyet faced.“Perhaps it’s meant as a metaphor. Jagang’s army behaves like a beast and theycould certainly be described as ghastly. They slaughter everything in theirpath. For free people, and for Richard especially, the Imperial Order is a beastcoming to destroy them and everything they hold dear.”Nathan shrugged. “That very well could he the explanation. I just don’t know.”He paused a moment before he went on. “There is one more disturbing bit ofoblique counsel to be found not only in this book but in several of the otherbooks”—he cast a meaningful look her way—”books that I’ve never seen before.”For a whole variety of reasons, Ann, too, found it disturbing to learn thatthere were all these books hidden in such a strange, underground, graveyardroom.Nathan gestured again to the books stacked all over the four large tables.“While there certainly are copies of a number of books we’ve seen, and I’veshowed those to you, most of these books are new to me. For any library todeviate to this degree from the classic masterworks is unprecedented. Eachlibrary has its own unique volumes, to be sure, but this place is like anotherworld altogether. Nearly every volume in here is an astonishing discovery.”Ann’s caution awakened. She had the uncanny feeling that Nathan had at lastarrived at the core of the labyrinth through which his mind traveled. One thinghe had just said loomed in the back of her mind.“Counsel?” She frowned suspiciously. “What sort of counsel?”“It advises the reader that if their interest is not of a general nature butthey instead have cause to seek more extensive and specific knowledge on thesubjects therein, then they should consult the pertinent volumes kept with thebones.”Ann’s brow drew even tighter. “Kept with the bones?”“Yes. It referred to these caches as ‘central sites.’ “ Nathan leaned closeagain, like a washwoman with a load of dirty gossip. “The ‘central sites’ arementioned in a number of places, but I’ve so far only been able to find whereone of these sites was named: the catacombs beneath the vaults at the Palace ofthe Prophets.”Ann’s jaw fell open. “Catacombs… That’s preposterous. There was no such placebeneath the Palace of the Prophets.”“None we knew of,” Nathan said in a grave tone. “That doesn’t mean it didn’texist.”“But, but,” Ann stammered, “that’s just not possible. It’s just not. Such athing could not have gone unnoticed. In all that time Sisters lived there wewould have known.”Nathan shrugged. “In all this time no one knew of this place, here, beneath thebones.”“But no one lived right above here.”“What if the presence of catacombs beneath the palace was not common knowledge?After all, we know little of the wizards of that time, and not a great dealabout the specific people involved in the construction of the Palace of theProphets. It could be that they had reason to conceal such a place, just as thisplace was concealed.”Nathan arched an eyebrow. “What if part of the purpose of the palace—thetraining of young wizards—was part of an elaborate ruse to hide the existence ofsuch a secret site?”Ann could feel her face going red. “Are you suggesting that our calling wasmeaningless? How dare you even suggest that all our lives have been devoted tonothing more than a deception, and that the lives of those with the gift wouldnot have been spared had we not—”“I’m not suggesting anything of the kind. I’m not saying the Sisters were beingduped or that what they did didn’t spare the lives of boys with the gift andhelp preserve it. I’m only saying that these books suggest that there may havebeen more to it. What if there was not only the intent to have a place for theSisters to practice their useful calling, but there was in part a granderpurpose behind the place where they practiced that calling? After all, think ofthe graveyard above us; it has a valid reason to exist, but it also convenientlyprovides a shroud to hide this place.“Perhaps such catacombs were deliberately covered over thousands of years agowith the intent of hiding them? If so, then by design we would never be aware oftheir existence. If it was a secret cache there wouldn’t have been any recordsof it.“From the impression I got from the references in these books, I have reason tobelieve that there were at one time books that were considered so disturbing andin some cases containing spells so dangerous that it was decided that they hadto be confined to a few hidden ‘central sites’ as a precaution, so that theydidn’t end up in circulation, where they would be copied, as is the practicewith most prophecy. What better way to restrict access’.’’ Since thesereferences speak of ‘the books kept with the bones,’ I suspect that these other‘central sites’ may be catacombs like the one said lo be beneath the Palace ofthe Prophets.”Ann slowly shook her head as she tried to lake it all in, as she tried loimagine if there was any possibility that it could be true. She looked again atthe table with the stacks of books that were mostly about Richard, and whichthey had never seen before.Ann gestured. “And these, here?”“What is there I almost wish I’d not read.”Ann clutched his sleeve. “Why? What did you read?”His seemed to catch himself. He waved a dismissal, smiled briefly, and changedthe subject.“What I find the most troubling about the blank places in the books is theircommon thread. While not all of the missing text is in prophecy about Richard, Ihave determined that they all do have one thing in common.”“And what would that be?”Nathan held up a finger to emphasize his point. “Every one of the missingportions are in prophecies that pertain to a time after Richard was born. Noneof the prophecies that belong to a time before Richard’s birth, or thereabouts,have copy missing.”Ann carefully clasped her hands together as she considered the mystery and howto solve the puzzle.“Well,” she said at last, “There is one thing we could check. I could have Vernasend a messenger to the Wizard’s Keep in Aydindril. Zedd is there protecting theplace so that it can’t fall into Jagang’s hands. We could have Verna send amessenger and ask that Zedd check specific-places in his copies of books we havehere and see if they are missing the same text.”“That’s a good idea,” Nathan said.“With the extent of the libraries at the Keep, he’s bound to have a number ofthe classic books on prophecy that we recognize and have here.”Nathan’s face brightened. “As a matter of fact, it would be even better if wecould have Verna send someone to the People’s Palace in D’Hara. While I wasthere I spent a lot of time in the palace libraries. I clearly remember seeingcopies of a number of these books. If we had someone check them, that would tellus if the books here are spelled, as you suggested, and the problem is confinedto these editions, or if it’s some kind of wider phenomenon. We need to haveVerna send someone to the People’s Palace at once.”“That should be easy enough. Verna is just about to depart for the south. Ontheir way they will no doubt be traveling near the People’s Palace.”Nathan frowned down at her. “You heard from Verna? And she said she is headingsouth? Why?”Ann’s mood sank. “I received a message from her earlier tonight—just before Icame here.”“And what did our young prelate have to say? Why is she traveling south?”In resignation, Ann let out a deep sigh. “I’m afraid the news is not the best.She said that Jagang has split his army. He is taking part of his horde downaround the mountains in order to sweep up into D’Hara from the south. Verna isleaving with a large contingent of the D’Haran forces to eventually stand andface the Order’s army.”The blood drained from Nathan’s face.“What did you say?” he whispered.Ann puzzled at his wide-eyed look. “You mean, that Jagang split his army?”She didn’t think it was possible, but the prophet’s face went even more ashen.“Dear spirits preserve us,” he whispered. “It’s too soon. We’re not ready.”Ann felt a tingling dread start at her toes and begin working its way up herlegs. Her thighs prickled with gooseflesh. “Nathan, what are you talking about?What’s wrong?”He turned and frantically searched the spines of the books stacked all over thetables. He finally found what he wanted in the middle of a pile and yanked itout, letting the rest of the stack topple over. He hurriedly leafed through thebook, muttering to himself as he searched.“Here it is,” he said as he pressed a finger to a page. “There are any number ofprophecies down here that I’ve found in books I’ve never seen before. Theseprophecies surrounding the final battle are veiled to me—I cannot see them invisions—but the words are frightening enough. This one sums them up as clearlyas any.”He bent close and in the candlelight read to her from the book. “ ‘In the yearof the cicadas, when the champion of sacrifice and suffering, under the bannerof both mankind and the Light, finally splits his swarm, thus shall be the signthat prophecy has been awakened and the final and deciding battle is upon us. Becautioned, for all true forks and their derivatives are tangled in this manticroot. Only one trunk branches from this conjoined primal origin. If fuer grissaost drauka does not lead this final battle, then the world, already standing inthe brink of darkness, will fall under that terrible shadow.’ “Fuer grissa ost drauka was one of the prophetic names for Richard, It was from awell-known prophecy in the ancient language of High D’Haran. Its translation wasthe bringer of death. To here call him by that name in this prophecy was a meansof linking the two prophecies in a conjugate fork.“If the cicadas should come this year,” Nathan said, “then that will verify thatthis prophecy is not just authentic but active.”Ann’s knees felt weak. “The cicadas began to emerge today.”Nathan stared down at her like the Creator Himself pronouncing judgment. “Thenthe chronology is fixed. The prophecies have all tumbled into place. Events aremarked. The end is upon us.”“Dear Creator protect us,” Ann whispered.Nathan slipped the book into his pocket. “We must get to Richard.”She was already nodding. “Yes, you’re right. There is no time to lose.”Nathan glanced about. “We certainly can’t take all these books with us and thereis no time to read them. We must seal this place back up, like it was, and leaveimmediately.”Before Ann could add her agreement, Nathan swept out an arm. The candles allextinguished. Only the lantern on the corner of one of the tables remained lit.On his way past, he swept it up in his big hand.“Come on,” he said.Ann scurried to catch up with him, trying to stay in the small circle of lightnow that the odd room had been plunged into darkness. “Are you sure that weshouldn’t take any of these books?”The prophet rushed into the narrow stairwell, the light funneling in with him.“We can’t be slowed down to carry them. Besides, which would we take?” He pausedmomentarily to look back over his shoulder. His face was all angles and sharplines in the harsh lanternlight. “We already know what prophecy says and now,for the first time, we know the chronology. We must get to Richard. He has to bethere at the battle when the armies clash or all will be lost.”“Yes, and we will have to make sure that he is there to complete the word ofprophecy.”“We are in agreement, then,” he said as he turned and rushed onward up thestairs. The tunneled stairwell was so narrow and low that he had trouble makinghis way up.At the top, they burst out into the night, to the shrill, buzzing song of thecicadas. Nathan called out for Tom and Jennsen. The trees gently swayed in thehumid breeze as they waited for an answer. It seemed an eternity, but it wasreally only a moment before both Tom and Jennsen came running out of thedarkness.“What is it?” Jennsen asked, breathlessly.The dark shadow of Tom towered at her side. “Is there trouble?”“Grave trouble,” Nathan confirmed.Ann thought that he might be a little more discreet about it, but as serious asthe situation was, discretion probably was pointless. He pulled the book he hadtaken from the library out of his pocket. He opened it to a blank page whereprophecy was missing.“Tell me what this says.” he commanded, holding it out to Jennsen.She frowned at him. “What it says? Nathan, it’s blank.”He grumbled his discontent. “That means Subtractive was somehow involved.Subtractive is underworld magic, the power of death, so it affects her the sameas us.”Nathan turned back to Jennsen. “We have found prophecy that pertains to Richard.We must find him or Jagang will win the war.”Jennsen gasped. Tom let out a low whistle.“Do you know where he is?” Nathan asked.Without hesitation, Tom turned a little and lifted an arm to point off into thenight. His bond told him what their gift could not. “He is that way. Not a greatdistance, but not close, either.”Ann peered into the darkness. “We’ll have to get our things together and be onour way at first light.”“He’s on the move,” Tom said. “I doubt you will find him there in that spot bythe time you get there.”Nathan cursed under his breath. “There’s no telling where that boy is heading.”“I’d guess that he is headed back to Altur’Rang,” Ann said.“Yes, but what if he doesn’t stay there?” He laid a hand on Tom’s shoulder. “Wewill need you to come with us. You are one of the covert protectors to the LordRahl. This is important.”Ann saw Tom’s hand gripped tightly around the knife at his belt. The silver hiltof that knife was emblazoned with the ornate letter “R,” standing for the Houseof Rahl. It was a rare knife carried by rare individuals who worked unseen toprotect the life of the Lord Rahl.“Of course,” Tom said.“I’ll come as well,” Jennsen added in a rush. “I only have to get—”“No,” Nathan said, silencing her. “We need you to stay here.”“Why?”“Because,” Ann said in a more sympathetic tone than Nathan had used, “you areRichard’s link with these people. They are in need of help in understanding thewider world only just opened to them. They are vulnerable to the Imperial Orderand vulnerable to being used against us. They have only just made the choice tobe part of our cause and part of the D’Haran Empire. Richard needs you to behere for now, and right now Tom’s place is with us and his duty to Richard.”With panic in her eyes, she looked to Tom. “But I—”“Jennsen,” Nathan said, his arm encircling her shoulders, “look there.” Hepointed down the stairwell. “You know what’s down there. If anything happens tous, Richard may need to know as well. You must be here to guard this place forhim. This is important—just as important as Tom coming with us. We’re not tryingto spare you danger; this may in fact be more dangerous than going with us.”Jennsen looked from Nathan’s eyes to Ann’s and reluctantly recognized howserious the situation was. “If you think Richard might need me here, then I muststay.”Ann touched her fingertips to the underside of the young woman’s chin. “Thankyou, child, for understanding the importance of this.”“We must close this place up, like it was when I found it,” Nathan said,swirling his arms with his urgency. “I’ll show you the mechanism and how to makeit function. Then we must get back to town and gather our things. We will onlybe able to snatch a few hours’ sleep before sunrise, but it can’t be helped.”“It’s a long walk out of Bandakar,” Tom said. “After we’re over the mountainpass we’ll have to find some horses if we’re to catch Lord Rahl.”“It’s decided then,” the prophet said. “Let’s get this tomb closed back up andbe on our way.”Ann frowned. “Nathan, this cache of books has been hidden under this gravestonefor thousands of years. In all that lime no one has ever discovered it wasthere.. Just how did you manage to find it?”Nathan lifted an eyebrow. “Actually, I didn’t think it was all that difficult.”He stepped around to the front of the huge stone monument and waited for Ann tocome closer. Once she had, he held up his lantern.There, carved into the face of the ancient stone were but two words:NATHAN RAHL."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13It was late afternoon by the time Victor, Nicci, Cara, and Richard passedthrough the long shadows among the olive groves covering the southern hillsoutside of Altur’Rang. Richard had never eased the pace and they were all tiredfrom the arduous, if relatively short, journey. The chill rain had moved on,pushed away by the oppressive weight of heat and humidity. With as much as theywere all sweating, it might as well have still been raining.Even though he was bone-weary, Richard felt better than he had only a couple ofdays before. Despite the exertion, his strength was gradually returning.He was also relieved that they had seen no sign of the beast. Several times hehad let the others go on while he checked their backtrail to see if they werebeing followed. He had never seen any sign of anyone or anything followingbehind them and so he was starting to breathe a little easier. He also had toconsider the possibility that Nicci’s information about Jagang creating such amonster was not the explanation for what had killed Victor’s men. Even if, asNicci said, Jagang had succeeded in creating such a beast, that didn’t mean thatit was the explanation for the violent and deadly attack or even that this beasthad yet begun to hunt Richard. But if that wasn’t it, then he couldn’t evenbegin to imagine what it could have been.Carts, wagons, and people moved at a brisk pace along the crowded roads aroundthe city. Commerce seemed to be flourishing even more than the last time Richardhad been in Altur’Rang. Some of the people recognized Victor, and some Nicci.Since the revolt, both of them had played important roles in Altur’Rang. A goodnumber of the people recognized Richard, either because they had been there thenight the revolution for their liberty had begun, or because they recognized hissword. It was a unique weapon and the polished silver and gold scabbard was hardto miss, especially in the Old World under the drab rule of the Order.People smiled at the four of them as they passed, or lipped a hat, or gave thema friendly nod. Cara eyed every passing smile with suspicion.Richard would have been pleased to see the emerging vitality in Altur’Rang hadhis mind not been on things far more important to him. And to deal with thoseimportant matters, he needed horses. Since it was so late in the day, it wouldbe dark before he could hope to have horses and supplies collected and ready fora journey. He was reluctantly reconciled to spending the night in Altur’Rang.Many of the people on the bustling country lanes and roads around the cityseemed to be traveling to and from nearby towns, or possibly even places muchfarther. Whereas people once came to the city in the desperate hope of findingwork at building the emperor’s palace, they now arrived filled with optimismthat they would be able to find a new life, a free life.Every one of the people traveling away from the city, besides carrying foods fortrade, also carried word of the profound changes since the revolt. They were anarmy carrying the bright shining weapon of an idea. In Altur’Rang they no longerhad to mold their lives around their fear of the order; they could now shapetheir lives to their own needs and aspirations made possible by personal libertyand their own enterprise. They owed their lives to no one. Swords could enforcetyranny, but only if it relentlessly crushed such ideas.Ultimately, only brutality could enforce the irrationality and dead end ofself-sacrifice.That was why the Order would have to send its most savage troops to crush thevery idea of liberty. If they didn’t, then liberty would spread and people wouldprosper. If that came to be, then liberty would triumph.Richard noticed that new market stands seemed to have sprung up at junctions ofwhat had once been little more than rutted paths and lanes but were now activebyways. The stands sold goods of every sort, from a variety of vegetables tostacks of firewood to rows of jewelry. Merchants at the outskirts of the cityeagerly offered travelers a variety of cheeses, sausages, and breads. Closer tothe city, people milled about, scrutinizing bolts of cloth or inspecting thequality of an array of leather goods.Richard remembered how when Nicci had first brought him to Altur’Rang they’d hadto stand in lines all day for a loaf of bread and often the store would run outbefore they ever got anywhere near the front of the line. So that everyone couldafford bread, bakeries had been strictly regulated and prices had been fixed bya whole variety of committees, boards, and layers of ordinances. Noconsideration was given to the cost of ingredients or labor, only to what wasjudged to be the price people could afford to pay. The price of bread had seemedcheap, but there was never enough bread, nor any other foodstuff. Richardconsidered it a perversion of logic to call something unavailable inexpensive.Laws that the hungry be fed had only resulted in widespread hunger haunting thestreets and dark homes of the city. The true cost of the altruistic ideas thatspawned such laws was starvation and death. Those who championed the loftynotions of the Order were indignantly blind to the endless misery and death theycaused.Now, at stands on almost every corner, bread was plentiful and starvation lookedto have receded into nothing more than a horrific memory. It was amazing to seehow freedom had made everything so plentiful. It was amazing to see so manypeople in Altur’Rang smiling.The revolt had been opposed by a good number of people who supported theImperial Order, who wanted things to continue the way they were. There were manywho believed that people were wicked and deserved no more out of their livesthan misery. Such people believed that happiness and accomplishment were sinful,that individuals, on their own, could not make their own lives better withoutcausing harm to others. Such people scorned the very idea of individual liberty.For the most part, those people had been defeated—either killed in the fightingor driven away. Those who had fought for and won their liberty had fiercereasons to value it. Richard hoped that they would have the will to hang on towhat they had won.As they passed into the older sections of the city, he noticed that many of thedingy brick buildings had been cleaned so that they almost looked new. Shutterswere painted bright colors that actually looked cheerful in the hazy,late-afternoon sun. A number of the buildings that had been burned down in therevolt were already being rebuilt. Richard thought it a wonder, after the way itused to be, that Altur’Rang could look cheerful. It gave him a flutter ofexcitement to see a place so alive.He knew, too, that it was the simple, sincere happiness of people pursuing theirown interests and living their lives for the sake of themselves that would drawthe hate and wrath of some. The followers of the Order believed that mankind wasinherently evil. Such people would stop at nothing to suffocate the blasphemy ofhappiness.As they turned onto a broader street that led deeper into the city, Victor cameto a stop at a corner of major thoroughfares.“I need to go see Ferran’s family and the families of some of the other men. Ifit’s all right with you, Richard, I think I should speak with them alone, fornow at least. The grief of sudden loss and important visitors are a confusingmix.”Richard felt awkward being viewed as an important visitor, especially by peoplewho had just lost loved ones, but in the midst of such bad news it was not thetime for him to try to soften that view.“I understand, Victor.”“But I was hoping that maybe later you could say some words to them. It would bea comfort if you told them how brave their men had been. Your words would honortheir loved ones.”“I’ll do my best.”“There are others who will need to know that I’ve returned. They will be eagerto see you.”Richard gestured to Cara and Nicci. “I want to show them something”—he pointedtoward the center of the city—”down this way.”“You mean Liberty Square?”Richard nodded.“Then I will meet you there as soon as I can manage it.”Richard briefly watched as Victor vanished down a narrow cobbled street to theright.“What do you want to show us?” Cara asked.“Something that I’m hoping may help jog your memory.”The first sight of the majestic statue carved from the finest white Cavaturamarble, glowing in the amber light of the late-day sun, nearly buckled Richard’sknees.He knew every intimate curve of the figure, every fold of the flowing robes. Heknew because he had carved the original.“Richard?” Nicci said as she clasped his arm. “Are you all right?”He could manage hardly more than a whisper as he stared at the statue off acrossthe green sweep of lawns. “I’m fine.”The vast open expanse had been the site of thee construction of the formerpalace that was to be the seat of rule for the Imperial Order. It had been whereNicci has brought Richard to toil for the greater glory of the cause of theOrder in the hope that he would learn the importance of sell sacrifice and thecorrupt nature of mankind. Instead, in the process, she had learned the value oflife.But while he’d still been Nicci’s captive, he had worked for months in theconstruction of the emperor’s palace. That palace was gone, now, erased from theface of the ground. Only a semicircle of columns from the main entrance remainedto stand watch around the proud statue in while marble that marked the placewhere the flame of freedom had first ignited in the heart of darkness.After the revolt against the rule of the Order, the statue had been carved anddedicated to the free people of Altur’Rang and the memory of those who had giventheir lives for that freedom. This place, where people had first spilled bloodto gain their liberty, was now hallowed ground. Victor had named the placeLiberty Square.Lit by the warm light of the low sun, the statue shone like a beacon.“What do you two see?” Richard asked.Cara, too, had a hand on his arm. “Lord Rahl, it’s the same statue we saw thelast time we were here.”Nicci nodded her agreement. “The statue that the carvers created after therevolt.”The sight of the statue made Richard ache. The feminity of its exquisite shape,the curves, the bone and muscle, were clearly evident beneath the flowing robesof stone. The woman in marble almost looked alive.“And where did the carvers get the model for this statue?” Richard asked the twowomen.Both gave him a blank look.With a hooked finger, Nicci pulled back a strand of hair that the humid breezehad lifted across her face. “What do you mean?”“To carve such a statue, expert carvers typically scale it up from a model. Whatdo you recall about that model?”“Yes,” Cara said as her face brightened in recollection, “it was something youcarved.”“That’s right,” he said to Cara. “You and I searched together for the wood forthe small statue. You were the one who found the walnut tree I used. It had beengrowing on a slope just above a broad valley. The tree had been knocked over bya windblown spruce. You were there when I cut the wood from that fallen,weathered walnut tree. You were there when I curved that small statue. We sattogether on the banks of the stream and talked the hours away as I worked onit.”“Yes, I remember you carving while we sat in the countryside.” A hint of a smileghosted across Cara’s face. “What of it?”“We were at the home I built in the mountains. Why were we there?”Cara looked up at him, puzzled by the question, as if it seemed too obvious towarrant the effort of retelling. “After the people of Anderith voted to sidewith the Imperial Order, rather than with you and D’Hara, we gave up on tryingto lead people against the Order. You said that you couldn’t force people towant to be free, but that they must choose it for themselves before you couldlead them.”It was difficult for Richard to calmly tell things to a woman who should knowthem as well as he did, but he knew that reproach wouldn’t help to spark hermemory. Besides, whatever was going on, he knew it wasn’t a willfull deceptionon the part of Nicci and Cara.“That was part of it,” he said. “But there was a much more important reason whywe were there in those trackless mountains.”“A more important reason?”“Kahlan had been beaten nearly to death. I took her there so that she would besafe while she recovered. You and I spent months caring for her, trying to nurseher back to health.“But she wasn’t getting better. She sank into a deep despondency. She haddespaired of ever recovering, of ever being whole again.”He couldn’t bring himself to say that part of the reason Kahlan had nearly givenup was because when those men had beaten her nearly to death, it had caused herto lose her child.“And so you carved this statue of her?” Cara asked.“Not exactly.”I le stared off at the proud figure in white stone rising up against the deepblue sky. He had not intended the little statue he’d carved to look like Kahlan.Through this figure, her robes flowing as she faced into a wind, as she stoodwith her head thrown back, her chest out, her hands fisted at her silk’s, herback arched and strong as if in opposition to an invisible power trying tosubdue her, Richard had conveyed not what Kahlan looked like, but rather a senseof her inner nature.This was not a statue of Kahlan, but of her living force, her soul. Themagnificent statue before them was her spirit encased in stone.“It’s Kahlan’s courage, her heart, her valor, her determination. That’s why Inamed this statue Spirit.“When she saw it, she understood what she was seeing. It made her hunger to bewell again, to be strong and independent again. It made her want to be fullyalive again. That was when she started to get well.”Both women looked more than simply dubious, but they didn’t dispute his story.“The thing is,” Richard said as he started out across the broad stretch ofgrass, “if you were to ask the men who carved this statue where that smallstatue is, that statue I carved and which they used as a model to scale up thisone, they would not be able to find it or tell you what happened to it.”Nicci hurried to keep up with him. “So where is it, then?”“That little statue I carved for her out of walnut wood that summer in themountains meant a great deal to Kahlan. She was eager to have it back after themen were finished using it. Kahlan has it.”Nicci let out a sigh as she returned her gaze to where she was walking. “Ofcourse she does.”He frowned over at the sorceress. “And what does that mean?”“Richard, when a person is suffering delirium, their mind works to come up withthings to fill in the blank places, to knit together the tattered fabric of thatdelirium. It’s a way for them to try to make sense out of their confusion.”“Then where is the statue?” he asked both women.Cara shrugged. “I don’t know. I don’t remember what happened to it. There isthis big one now, in marble. That’s the one that seems important.”“I don’t know, either, Richard,” Nicci said when he looked her way. “Maybe ifthe carvers look around they will be able to come up with it.”It seemed like she was missing the purpose of his story and that they onlythought that he was interested in finding his carving.“No, they won’t be able to come up with it. That’s the whole point. That’s whatI’m trying to make you understand. Kahlan has it. I remember her pleasure theday she got it back. Don’t you see? No one will be able to find it or rememberwhat happened to it. Don’t you see how things don’t fit? Don’t you see thatsomething strange is going on? Don’t you see that something is wrong?”They paused at the base of the broad expanse of steps.“The truth’? Not really.” Nicci gestured up at the statue standing before thesemicircle of pillars. “After this statue was finally finished and the model wasno longer needed it was probably lost or destroyed. As Cara said, we now havethe statue here in stone.”“But don’t you see the importance of the small carving? Don’t you see theimportance of what I’m telling you? I remember what happened to it, and no oneelse will. I’m tying to prove a point—to show you something, to show you thatI’m not dreaming up Kahlan, to show you that things just don’t add up and youneed to believe me.”Nicci slipped a thumb under the strap of her pack in an effort to ease the achecaused by the burden of its weight.“Richard, your subconscious mind in all likelihood recalls what happened to thecarving—that it was lost or destroyed after this statue was finished—and so ituses that small detail to try to patch in one of the holes in the insubstantialstory you dreamed up in your delirium. It’s just your inner mind trying to makethings seem like it all makes sense for you.”So that was it. It wasn’t that they didn’t get his point, it was that they gotit all too well and simply didn’t believe it. Richard took a deep breath. Hestill hoped to be able to convince them that they were the ones who weremistaken, who weren’t taking everything into account.“But why would I invent such a story?”“Richard,” Nicci said as she gently gripped his arm, “please, let’s just dropit. I’ve said enough. I’m only making you angry.”“I asked you a question. What possible reason would I have for creating such astory?”Nicci cast a sidelong glance at Cara before finally giving in. “If you want toknow the truth, Richard, I think you recalled this statue here—partly because itwas only recently carved after the revolt and it was fresh in your memory—andwhen you were hurt, when you were at the brink of death, because this was freshin your mind you wove it into your dream. It became part of this woman youdreamed up—part of the story. You linked it all together and used it to helpcreate something meaningful for yourself, something you could hang on to. Yourmind used this statue because it serves to connect your dream to something inthe real world. In that way, it serves to help make your dream more real foryou.”“What?” Richard was stunned. “Why would—”“Because,” Nicci said, lists at her sides, “It makes it look as if you can pointto something solid in the real world and say ‘this is her.’ “Richard blinked, unable to speak.Nicci glanced away. Her voice lost its heat and dropped to a near whisper.“Forgive me, Richard.”He withdrew his glare from her. How could he forgive her for what she sincerelybelieved? How could he forgive himself for not being able to make herunderstand?Fearing to test his voice just then, he started up the expanse of steps. Hecouldn’t look into her eyes, couldn’t look into the eyes of someone who thoughthe was mad. He was hardly aware of the effort of climbing the hill of steps.At the top, as he crossed the expansive marble platform he could hear Nicci andCara rushing up the steps after him. For the first time, he noticed that thereseemed to be quite a few people on the grounds of the former palace. From theheight of the platform he could see the river that cut through the city. Flocksof birds wheeled above the swirling water. Beyond the towering columns behindthe statue, green hills and trees wavered in the heat.The proud figure of Spirit rose up before him, glorious in the golden late-daysunlight. He laid a hand against the cool, smooth stone for support. He couldhardly endure the pain of what he felt at that moment.When Cara came close he looked up into her blue eyes. “Is that what you believe,too? That I’m just inventing in my head that Kahlan was hurt and you and I caredfor her? This statue doesn’t spark any memory? It doesn’t help you recallanything?”Cara gazed up at the mute statue. “Now that you brought it up, Lord Rahl, Iremember when I found the tree. I remember you smiling at me when I showed it toyou. I remember that you were pleased with me. I also remember some of thestories you told me when you carved, and I remember you listening to some of mystories. But you carved a lot of things that summer.”“That summer before Nicci came and took me away,” he added.“Yes.”“And if I’m only dreaming, and Kahlan doesn’t exist, then how did Nicci manageto capture me and take me away if you were there to protect me?”Cara paused, taken abuck by the culling tone of the question. “She used magic.”“Magic. Mord-Sith are the counter to magic, remember? That’s their whole reasonfor their existence—to protect the Lord Rahl from those with magic who would dohim harm. The day Nicci showed up she intended to do me harm. You were there.Why didn’t you stop her?”Terror crept incrementally into Cara’s blue eyes. “Because I failed you. Ishould have stopped her, but I failed. A day does not go by that I don’t wishyou would punish me for failing in my duty to protect you.” Her face stood outcrimson against her blond hair as her sudden confession burst forth. “Because Ifailed you, you were captured by Nicci and taken away for nearly a year—allbecause of me. If it had been your father I failed in such a fashion he wouldhave executed me, but only after making me beg for death until I was hoarse. Andhe would have been right to do so; I deserve no less. I failed you.”Richard stared in shock. “Cara… it wasn’t your fault. That’s the whole point ofmy question. You should remember that you could have done nothing to stopNicci.”Cara’s hands fisted. “I should have, but I didn’t. I failed you.”“Cara, that’s not true. Nicci used a spell on Kahlan. Had either of us doneanything to stop her, Nicci would have killed Kahlan.”“What!” Nicci objected. “What in the world are you talking about?”“You captured Kahlan with a spell. That spell connected you to Kahlan and wasdirectly controlled by your intent. If I hadn’t gone with you, you could havekilled Kahlan at any time with no more than a thought. That, for the most part,was why Cara and I could do nothing.”Nicci planted her hands on her hips. “And just what kind of a spell do you thinkcould accomplish such a thing?”“A maternity spell.”Nicci regarded him with a blank look. “A what?”“A maternity spell. It created a connection that made anything that happened toyou happen to her. If Cara or I had harmed or killed you, the same fate wouldhave befallen Kahlan. We were helpless. I had to do what you wanted. I had to gowith you or Kahlan would have died. I had to do as you wished or you could havetaken her life through the link of that spell. I had to make sure nothinghappened to you or the same fate would befall Kahlan.”Nicci shook her head with incredulity and then, without comment, turned to stareoff at the hills beyond the statue.“It wasn’t your fault, Cara.” He lifted her chin to make her wet eyes look up athim. “Neither of us could have done anything. You didn’t fail me.”“Don’t you think that I would like to believe you? Don’t you think that I would,if it were true?”“If you don’t remember what I’m telling you really happened,” Richard said,“then just how do you think Nicci managed to capture me?”“She used magic.”“What kind of magic?”“I don’t know what kind of magic it was—I’m no expert on how magic works. Shejust used magic, that’s all.”He turned to Nicci. “What magic? How did you capture me? What spell did you use?Why didn’t I stop you? Why didn’t Cara stop you?”“Richard, that was… what, a year and a half ago? I don’t remember exactly whatspell I used that day to capture you. It wasn’t all that hard. You don’t havethe ability to control your gift or mount a defense against someone experiencedwith it. I could have tied you up in knots of magic and had you over the back ofa horse without working up a sweat.”“And why didn’t Cara try to stop you?”“Because,” Nicci said, gesturing in exasperation at having to try to recall theirksome details, “I had you hobbled under my ability and she knew that if shemade a move I would have killed you first. It’s no more complicated than that.”“That’s right,” Cara said. “Nicci spelled you, just as she says. I couldn’t doanything because it was you she attacked. If she would have used her poweragainst me I could have turned her gift against her, but she used it instead onyou, so I could do nothing.”With a finger, Richard wiped sweat from his brow. “You’re trained to kill withyour bare hands. If nothing else why wouldn’t you have hit her over the headwith a rock?”“I would have hurt you,” Nicci said, answering for Cara, “or possibly evenkilled you, had she even looked like she was going to try anything.”“And then Cara would have had you,” Richard reminded the sorceress.“Back then I was willing to forfeit my life—I just didn’t care. You know that.”Richard did indeed know that that much of it was true. At the time.Nicci did not value life, not. even her own. That had made her dangerous in theextreme.“My mistake was in not attacking Nicci before she could get to you,” Cara said.“If I had made her strike out at me with magic, I would have get her. That iswhat a Mord-Sith is supposed to do. But I failed you.”“You couldn’t,” Nicci said. “I surprised you both. You didn’t fail, Cara.Sometimes there simply isn’t any chance to succeed. Sometimes there is nosolution. For the two of you, that was one of those situations. I was incontrol.”It was hopeless. Every time he backed them into a corner they seemed in he ableto effortlessly slither out.Richard laid a hand against the smooth marble as his mind raced, trying in thinkof how this could be happening—what could be causing them to forget. He reasonedthat maybe he could remedy the problem if he only knew what was causing it.And then, something; about that story he had told them in the shelter a coupleof nights back suddenly sprang to mind."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14Richard snapped his fingers.“Magic,” he said. “That’s it. Remember how I told you that Kahlan showed up inthe Hartland woods near where I lived, and that she had come because she waslooking for the long-lost great wizard?”“What of it?” Nicci asked.“Kahlan was looking for the great wizard because Zedd had fled the Midlandsbefore I was born. Darken Rahl had raped my mother and Zedd wanted to take heraway to safety.”Cara’s brow twitched with suspicion. “Much like you say you took this woman,your wife, to those remote mountains so she would be safe after she had beenattacked?”“Well, kind of, but—”“Do you see what you’re doing, Richard?” Nicci asked. “You’re taking things youheard about and putting them into your dream. Do you see the thread that runsthrough both stories? That’s a common phenomenon when people dream. The mindfalls back on what it knows or has heard about.”“No, that’s not it. Just hear me out.”Nicci conceded with a single nod but she clasped her hands behind her back andlifted her chin in the manner of an uncompromising teacher dealing with anobstinate student.“I guess there were similarities,” Richard finally admitted, uncomfortable atthe way Nicci had him locked in her knowing gaze, “but in a way that’s thepoint. You see, Zedd had become fed up with the council of the Midlands, muchlike I gave up trying to help people who believed in the Order’s lies. Thedifference is that Zedd wanted to leave them to suffer the consequences of theiractions. He didn’t want them to be able to come asking for his help in gettingthem out of trouble of their own making. When he left the Midlands and went toWestland he cast a wizard’s web to make everyone forget him.”He thought they should understand, but they only stared at him. “Zedd lined aspecific magic spell to make everyone forget his name, forget who he was, sothat they couldn’t come looking for him. That must be what happened with Kahlan.Someone took her and used magic not only to erase her tracks, but to eraseeveryone’s memory of her. That’s why you can’t remember her. That’s why no oneremembers her.”Cara looked surprised by the notion. She glanced at Nicci. Nicci wet her lipsand sighed heavily.“That has to be it,” Richard pressed. “That has to be the answer.”“Richard,” Nicci said in a quiet voice, “that’s not what is going on here, itdoesn’t even remotely make sense.”Richard couldn’t understand how Nicci, being a sorceress, couldn’t see it. “Yesit does. Magic made everyone forget Zedd. After Kahlan met me in the woods thatday, she told me how she was looking for the great wizard, but that no one couldrecall the old one’s name because he had cast a web of magic to make them forgetit. Magic must have been used to make everyone forget Kahlan in the same way.”“Except you?” Nicci said as she arched an eyebrow. “This magic seems lo havefailed where you’re concerned, since you have no trouble remembering her.”Richard had been expecting just such an argument. “It’s possible that since Ialone have a different form of the gift, the spell didn’t work on me.”Nicci again drew a deep, patient breath. “You say that this woman, Kahlan, camelooking for the missing wizard, the ‘old one,’ right?”“Right.”“Don’t you see the problem, Richard? She knew that she was looking for this oldone, the missing wizard.”Richard was nodding. “That’s right.”Nicci leaned toward him. “That kind of spell is quite troublesome to create, andit has a number of complications that must be taken into account, but other thanthat it’s not altogether remarkable. Difficult, yes, remarkable, no.”“Then that must be what was done with Kahlan. Someone—maybe one of the Order’swizards traveling with the supply convoy—took her and cast a spell to try tomake us all forget her so that we wouldn’t come after them.”“Why would someone go to the trouble to do such a thing?” Cara asked. “Why notsimply kill her? What’s the purpose in capturing her and then making everyoneforget her?”“I’m not sure. Maybe they simply wanted to have a way to escape without beingfollowed. Maybe they intend to spirit her away and then, at a time of theirchoosing, parade their prisoner before their subjects to show their power, toshow that they can capture anyone who opposes them. The fact remains that she’sgone and no one but me remembers her. It makes sense to me that a spell musthave been used, like the spell Zedd used to make people forget him.”Nicci pinched the bridge of her nose in a way that somehow made Richard feeljust a little stupid, as if his idea was so foolish it was giving her aheadache. “Everyone was looking for this old one, this great wizard. Theyremembered that he was the great wizard, that he was an important, accomplishedman, even that he was from the Midlands. They merely couldn’t remember his nameand probably what he looked like. So, without his name or a description of himthey were having a great deal of difficulty finding him.”Richard nodded. “That’s right.”“Don’t you see, Richard? They knew that he existed, knew that he was the oldwizard, and probably had a great many memories of things he had done, but theysimply couldn’t recall his name—because of the spell. That’s all his name. Theycouldn’t remember his name even though they remembered that the man existed.“But this wife of yours is remembered by no one except you. We don’t know hername or anything else about her. We have no memory of her or of anything shesupposedly did with us. We have no knowledge of anything at all about her. Notone thing. She exists in no one’s mind but yours.”Richard saw the distinction but wasn’t ready to concede the point. “But maybethis was just a stronger spell, or something. It must have been much the same,but just more powerful so that everyone not only forgets her name, but forgetsher altogether.”Nicci gently gripped his shoulders in an almost painfully sympathetic manner.“Richard, I admit that to someone like you, who grew up without understandingmagic, that might seem like it makes sense—and it’s very inventive, it reallyis—but it simply doesn’t work that way in the real world.To someone without an understanding of how such power works it must seementirely logical, at least on the surface. But when you look deeper thedifference between a spell to make everyone forget a person’s name and a spellmaking everyone forget that the person ever existed, it’s the difference betweenlighting a fire at camp and igniting a second sun in the sky.”Richard threw up his hands in frustration. “But why?”“Because the first alters only one thing, the memory of a person’s name—and Imust add that such a thing, as simple as it might seem on the face of it, isprofoundly difficult and beyond the ability of all but a handful of the mostgifted individuals and even then they must have extensive knowledge. Still,everyone knows that they have forgotten the great wizard’s name so even as itdoes the work of making people forget that name, the spell only has toaccomplish this one clearly defined and limited task. The difficulty with spellsof this nature is in how broadly the task is applied, but for the purpose ofthis example that is beside the point.“Where the first example alters one thing, the name of the vanished wizard, thesecond alters nearly everything. That is what makes it beyond difficult; itmakes it impossible.”“I still don’t understand.” Richard paced from the statue partway out across theplatform and back, gesturing as he spoke. “It seems to me like it does roughlythe same thing.”“Think of all the ways a person, especially an important person such as theMother Confessor, touches the lives of nearly everyone. Dear spirits, Richard,she oversaw the Central Council of the Midlands. She made decisions thataffected every land.”Richard closed the distance to the sorceress. “What difference does that make?Zedd was First Wizard. He was important, too, and he touched a lot of lives.”“And people only forgot his name; they did not forget the man himself. Try, fora moment, to imagine what would be the result if a spell could make everyoneforget a simple man.” Nicci walked off a few paces and then abruptly turnedback. “Say, Faval, the charcoal maker. Not just forget his name, but forget theman entirely. Forget that he exists or ever did, just like you suggest happenedto this woman, Kahlan.“What would happen? What would Faval’s family do? Who would his children thinkfathered them? Who would his wife think made her pregnant and gave her children,if she couldn’t remember Paval? Where was this mystery man who sired a family?Would her mind invent another man to soothe her panic and fill the void? Whatwould her friends believe [??aril??] how would all of their thoughts mesh withhers? What would everyone believe without the truth to support their thinking?What would happens when people’s mind’s fabricated patches filling the gaps intheir memories, and those patches didn’t match? With the charcoal ovens allaround his home, how would his wife and children think they got there and howhad all the charcoal been made? What would happen at the foundry when Faval soldhis charcoal? What would Priska think—that somehow basket of charcoal hadmagically appeared in the bins in the storage room of his foundry?“I’m not even beginning to scratch the surface of the ever expandingcomplications such a fanciful forget-me spell cast on Faval would cause—theaccounting of money, the allocation of work, the agreements with lumbermen andother workers, the documents, the promises he’d made and all the rest. Think ofall the confusion and disarray such a thing would cause, and that’s with onelittle-known man living in a tiny house down [??in] lonely lane.” ,Nicci lifted an arm as if in grand introduction, “But with a woman like theMother Confessor herself?” She let the arm drop. “I can’t even begin to imaginethe tangle of consequences left snarled in the wake of such an incomprehensibleevent.”Nicci’s mane of blond hair stood out against the dark background of trees on thehills beyond the broad, level grassy expanse. Her hair’s length and its sweepingcurves looked casual, even comfortably intimate, and complemented her shapelyform in her black dress, but the power of her presence was not to be takenlightly. At that moment, as she stood illuminated by a ray of light from thesetting sun, she was a breathtaking figure of astute perception andknowledgeable authority, a force that seemed beyond reproach. Richard stood muteand motionless as she went on in an instructional tone.“It’s the cascade of connections to all those specific incidents that would makesuch a spell impossible. Every little thing that the Mother Confessor had everdone would snowball together with connected circumstances in which she may noteven have been personally involved, compounding the number of events that wouldbecome tainted by such a spell. The power, the complexity, the sheer magnitudeof it is beyond comprehension.“Those complications must draw power from the spell in order to counteract thedisruptive potential of such complications. Those exigencies feed off the powerof the spell that seeks to command the nature of the spell. Al some point, aspell without the power to compensate for a growing vortex of such dissipativeevents would simply sputter and die like a [??candle] in a downpour.”Nicci stepped close and jabbed a finger at his chest. “And that’s not eventaking into account the most glaring inconsistency of your dream. In yourdelirium you dreamed up an even more complex predicament. You dreamed up notonly this woman, this wife, who is remembered by no one else, but in yourirrational dreaming state you went further, much further, without realizing thefateful consequences. You see, it wasn’t merely some country girl, who no oneknew, that you dreamed up for yourself. No, you made her a known person. In thecontext of a dream that might seem a simple thing, but in the real world a knownperson creates a congruency dilemma.“And yet, you went further still! Even a known person would not be ascomplicated as what you did.“In your state of delirium you picked the Mother Confessor herself, a nearmythic individual, a person of great importance, but at the same time a personfar away, a person that neither Cara nor I nor Victor would know. None of us isfrom the distant Midlands, so we would have no way to easily offer up facts thatare inconsistent with your dream. That distance might have made sense in yourdream because it seemed to also solve the [??ünlidy] problem of contradictoryfacts, but in the real world it still creates for you a problem ofinsurmountable magnitude: Such a woman is widely known. It’s only a matter oftime until your carefully constructed world clashes with the real world andbegins to fall apart. By picking a known person, you have doomed your idyllicdream to destruction.”Nicci lifted his chin and made him look into her eyes. “In your troubled slateof mind, Richard, you dreamed up someone comforting. You were facing the abyssof death; you desperately wanted someone to love you, someone who made you feelless afraid, less terrified, less alone. That’s completely understandable, itreally is. I don’t think any less of you I couldn’t—because you created such asolution for yourself when you were so afraid and so alone, but it’s over andyon have to come to grip, with it.“If it had been an unknown woman you imagined, then the dream would have beennothing more than an ethereal abstraction. But you inadvertently linked it toreality because the Mother Confessor is known by a great many people. If youever get back to the Midlands, or run into people from the Midlands, your dreamwill come face-to-face with the indisputable reality. For you, each one of thosepeople is a lurking shadow ready to shoot an arrow, but this time an arrow thatwill not fail to pierce your heart.“It could even be worse. What if the real Mother Confessor is dead?”Richard drew back. “But she’s not.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said, “I remember several years ago when Darken Rahl sent thequads to kill all the Confessors. The quads don’t fail at the task ofassassination.”Richard stared at the Mord-Sith. “But they failed to get her.”“Richard,” Nicci said in a gentle tone, drawing his gaze back to her, “what ifyou someday get to the Midlands and you discover that the real Mother Confessorwas not what you imagined, but was in fact an old woman? After all, theConfessors didn’t name women as young as this love of yours would have been tobe the Mother Confessor. What if you find out that the real woman was old, andworse, that she is long dead? The truth, now. What would you do then, if youwere confronted by that and it was real?”Richard’s mouth was so dry that he had to work his tongue in order to be able towet his lips enough to speak. “I don’t know.”Nicci smiled wistfully. “An honest answer, at last.” Even that smile was morethan she could manage, and it vanished. “I’m afraid for you, Richard, afraid forwhat will become of your state of mind if you continue to cling to this, let ittake over your whole life, and then it finally comes lo something like that,which it will. Sooner or later you are going to come face to face with the stonecold reality of the situation.”“Nicci, just because you can’t envision—”“Richard,” she said, quietly cutting him off, “I’m a sorceress. I’ve been aSister of the Light and a Sister of the Dark. I know a thing or two about magic.I’m telling you that such a thing as you suggest is simply beyond the power ofany magic I know of. It is not beyond the power of a desperate man to dream up,but it is unworkable in the real world. You can’t even begin to imagine the direconsequences were such a thing to even be attempted, much less possible.”“Nicci, I grant you your great knowledge on the subject, but you don’t knoweverything. Just because you don’t know how to do something, that does not meanit’s impossible. It only means that you don’t know how it can be done. You justdon’t want to admit that you might be wrong.”Her hands fisted at her sides as she blinked. “Do you think that I want tooppose you in this? Is that what you think? Do you think I enjoy trying in makeyou see the truth? Do you think that I like being against you in everything?“What I know is that somehow, in some way, someone has made all of you forgetthat Kahlan exists. I know that she’s real, and I intend on finding her. Even ifyou don’t like it.”Nicci, her blue eyes brimming with tears, turned her back on him and gazed upbriefly at the statue towering over her. “Richard, I would eagerly grand youyour dream were it within my power to make it real. You cannot imagine what Iwould give to have you have what you want… to make you happy.”Richard watched the violet clouds at the horizon turning dark. It somehow seemedtoo peaceful to be real. Nicci stood with her arms folded, glaring off in theopposite direction, staring into the gathering darkness. Cara stood nearby,keeping an eye on all the people roaming the former palace grounds.“Nicci,” Richard finally said into the uncomfortable silence atop the vastmarble circle, “do you have any explanations other than this being a dream? Isthere anything within your knowledge that has any chance at all of being thecause of this? Is there anything at all, any kind of magic, that you can thinkof that would help solve this puzzle?”He watched her back, wondering if she would answer. A long shadow lay across thecurved, bronze dial plane encircling the proud figure. Idling him what he knew,that the day was dying, that valuable time was slipping away. Finally, Nicciturned to him. The fire seemed to gave gone out of her.“Richard, I’m sorry that I can’t make it real for you.” She brushed away a tearas it ran down her cheek, “I’m sorry to let you down.”With a grim expression, Cara met Nicci’s gaze. “I guess we have something incommon.”Richard gently touched his fingertips to the statue of Spirit. The upliftedface, its proud gaze set in white marble, lost its glow as the last rays of thesetting sun sank behind the hills.“Neither one of you let me down,” he said. “You both are telling me what youbelieve. But Kahlan is not a dream. She’s as real as her spirit carved in thisstone.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15Richard turned to a distant commotion and spotted a group of people headingtoward the monument. From atop the prominence he could see yet more peoplestrung out behind, perhaps drawn by the activity, or perhaps by the purposefullook of the cluster of men as they made their way across the open expanse ofground. At the head of the small crowd was just the man Richard wanted to see.Still some distance off, the man waved an arm. “Richard!”Despite everything, Richard couldn’t help but smile at the familiar stockyfellow wearing his customary, curious red hat with a narrow brim. When the mansaw that Richard had seen him, he picked up his pace, trotting across the grass.“Richard,” he called again. “You’ve come back—just as you promised!”As the group of people swarmed up the hill of steps, Richard started down tomeet them. It was then that Richard also saw that Victor was making his waysteadily through the gathering throng. At a wide marble landing, Ishaq rushed upand seized Richard’s hand, pumping it with great glee.“Richard, I’m so happy to see you back in Altur’Rang. You come to drive a wagonfor my transport company, yes? I have orders stacked up. How do I get myselfinto these messes? I need you back. You can start tomorrow?”“Glad to see you, too, Ishaq.”Ishaq was still pumping Richard’s hand. “Then you will come back? I will makeyou a full partner. We share everything equal, you and I.”“Ishaq, with as much money as you owe me—”“Money,” Ishaq scoffed. “What is this talk of money? I have so much work now andmore all the time that there is no time to worry about money. Forget money. Wecan earn all the money you want. I need a man with a good head. I will make youa partner. If you want, you can make me your partner—we will gel more work thisway. Everyone asks after you, ‘Where is Richard?’ they all say. I tell you,Richard, if you—”“Ishaq, I can’t. I’m trying to find Kahlan.”Ishaq blinked. “Kahlan?”“His wife,” a scowling Victor said as he stepped through the men behind Ishaq.Ishaq turned to gawk at Victor. He turned back to Richard.“Wife?” He swept his red hat off his head. “Wife? But this is wonderful!” Hespread his arms. “Wonderful!” He threw his arms around Richard and hugged him ashe laughed and danced back and forth on the balls of his feet. “You took a wife!This is wonderful news. We will have a banquet and—”“She’s missing,” Richard said, easing Ishaq back to arm’s length. “I’m lookingfor her. We don’t know what happened.”“Missing?” Ishaq swiped back his dark hair and replaced his red hat. “I willhelp. I will go with you.” His dark eyes turned serious. “Tell me what I cando.”It was no empty offer Ishaq made for the sake of courtesy. He was sincere. Itwas heartwarming to know that this man would drop everything to help.Richard didn’t think, though, that this was the time or place to explain. “It’snot that simple.”“Richard,” Victor said as he leaned closer, “we’ve got trouble.”Ishaq frowned at Victor, gesturing irritably. “Richard’s wife is missing. Whyyou bring him more worries on top of that?”“It’s all right, Ishaq. Victor already knows about Kahlan.” Richard rested hisleft hand on the pommel of his sword. “What sort of trouble?” he asked Victor.“Scouts have just returned to report Imperial Order troops coming this way.”Ishaq swept his hat from his head again. “Troops?”“Another supply convoy?” Richard asked.“No,” Victor said with a firm shake of his head. “These men are combat troopsand they’re coming this way.”Ishaq’s eyes grew round. “Soldiers are coming? How soon?”Voices carried the worrisome news back through the growing crowd.“At the rate they’re marching, they’re still a few days out. We have some timeto get our defenses organized. But not a lot of time.”Nicci stepped up close to Richard’s side. With her back straight, her head heldhigh, and her cutting gaze, she drew all eyes. Voices quieted as they watchedher. Even people who didn’t know who Nicci was tended to fall silent in herpresence. Some because of her stunning looks, some because there was justsomething dangerous about her commanding presence, on top of her physicalattraction, that made them tend to lose their nerve along with their voice.“And the scouts are sure they’re headed this way?” she asked. “Couldn’t theyjust be passing near on their way north?”“They’re not heading north.” Victor arched an eyebrow. “They’re coming from thenorth.”Richard’s fingers tightened around the hilt of his sword. “They’re coming downfrom the north—are you sure?”Victor nodded. “They’re seasoned combat troops. Worse still, they’ve picked upone of those priests somewhere along the way.”The gathered men gasped. Whispers of the news spread back through the crowd.Some of the men started asking questions, each trying to be heard over theothers.Nicci lifted a hand, commanding silence. With no more effort than that, thedarkening hillside of marble steps fell quiet. In the tense hush, she leanedtoward the grim blacksmith. Nicci’s brow drew down like a hawk that had justspotted dinner.“They have a wizard with them?” she hissed.Victor didn’t back up—one of the few who didn’t. “He’s said to be a high priestof the Fellowship of Order.”“All the Brothers in the Fellowship are wizards,” Ishaq pointed out. “This isnot good news. Not good at all.”“Can’t argue with that,” Victor said. “From the reports brought back by the men,there is no doubt that this one is a wizard.”Worried conversation again swept through the crowd. Some swore that such adevelopment would make no difference, that they would fight any attempt by theOrder to take back Altur’Rang. Others weren’t so sure as to what should be done.Nicci, staring off as she considered what she’d heard, finally returned her gazeto Victor. “Do the scouts know his name or anything about him that might helpidentify him?”Victor hooked his thumbs behind his belt as he gave her a single nod, “The highpriest’s name is Kronos.”“Kronos…” she murmured in thought.“The scouts who spotted the troops used their heads,” Victor told her, “Theyhadn’t been seen, so they got out ahead of the soldiers and mingled into a townalong the legion’s path and waited for them to arrive. The soldiers camped justoutside the town for a few nights to rest up and to resupply. Apparently theystripped the town bare in the process. When they got drunk they talked enoughfor my men to get the gist of what they’re up to and what they are up to is notjust putting an end to the insurrection in Altur’Rang. Their orders are to crushthe revolt and not to be gentle about it. They said they were to make examplesof the people there. They don’t seem to think it will be a big task, and they’relooking forward to the fun they’ll be having after the victory.”A pall of silence fell over the crowd.“What about the wizard?” Ishaq asked.“The men say that this fellow Kronos is a pious sort. He’s average height withblue eyes. He didn’t do any drinking with the soldiers. Instead, he lectured thetown’s folks long and often on the need to follow the Creator’s true ways bysacrificing what they had for the good of their fellow man, the Imperial Order,and their beloved emperor.“But, as it turns out, when he’s not lecturing he’s a letch, and apparently itdoesn’t matter much to him who the woman is or if she’s at all willing. Afterone man angrily raised a ruckus about his daughter being taken right off thestreet by Kronos’s orders, the good Brother came out and with a flash of hispower burned the hide right off the father. The pious wizard left the manscreaming and twitching as a lesson and he went back inside to finish hisbusiness with the daughter. The poor fellow was several hours dying. My men saidit was as horrifying as anything they’d ever seen. After that, no one else hadmuch to say when any woman caught Kronos’s eye.”Murmuring broke out in the crowd. Many of the people were shocked and angered bythe story. A number were frightened that this man was not only coming for thembut was under orders to make examples of them.Nicci didn’t look at all surprised by the report of such brutality. Alterlengthy consideration, she finally shook her head.“I don’t know this Brother of the Order, but there are a number of them that Idon’t know.”Ishaq’s dark eyes shifted between Richard and Nicci. “What are we going to do?Troops and a wizard. This is not good. But you have ideas, yes?”Some in the crowd voiced their agreement with Ishaq, wanting to know whatRichard thought. He didn’t really see what there was to discuss.“You’ve all fought for and won your freedom,” Richard said. “I would suggestthat you don’t give it up.”A number of men nodded. They knew all too well what it was like to live underthe heel of the Order. They had learned, too, what it meant to be free to livetheir own lives. Nonetheless, fear seemed to be stealing into the mood of thecrowd.“But now you’re here to lead us, Lord Rahl,” one of the men said. “You’ve facedworse than this, I’m sure. With your help we can fight off these soldiers.”In the gathering gloom Richard appraised the expectant faces watching him.“I’m afraid that I can’t stay. I have something of critical importance I mustdo. I will have to leave in the morning at first light.”Shocked silence greeted him.“But the soldiers are only a few days away,” one of the men finally said.“Surely, Lord Rahl, you can wait that long.”“If I could, I would stand here with you against these soldiers, just as I’vestood with you before, but right now I can’t afford to delay that long. I mustcarry the fight elsewhere. It’s the same fight, so I will be with you inspirit.”The man looked stunned. “But it’s just a few days…”“Don’t you see that it’s much more than that? If I stay, and we defeat those menwho are coming to kill you, then, eventually, more will come. You have to beable to stand on your own. You can’t depend on me to stay here indefinitely andhelp you uphold your freedom every time Jagang sends soldiers to take backAltur’Rang. The world is full of places like Altur’Rang, all facing the sameordeal. Sooner or later you’ll have to accept the responsibility of standing onyour own. Now is as good a time as any.”“So you’re deserting us when we need you most?” A voice farther back called out.The crowd didn’t speak up to agree with the sentiment, but it was clear thatmore than one person had the same thought. Cara inched forward. Before she couldstep in front of him, Richard surreptitiously lifted his hand, touching her legin warning for her to stay where she was.“Now, look here,” Victor growled, “Richard isn’t deserting anything, and I’llhear none of that kind of talk.” Men backed away at the measured menace in hisvoice. Victor’s glare alone was enough to turn men twice his size pale. “He hasalready done more for us than anyone ever before. He showed us that we can eachrun our own lives for ourselves and that’s what changed everything. You’ve alllived here your whole life under the Order. Richard showed us what we’re reallymade of, showed us that we’re proud men and we can handle ourselves withcourage. We’re the ones who took responsibility for our own lives and gained ourown freedom. He didn’t come here and give us anything. We earned it.”Most of the men standing on the steps and spread out across the lawns fellsilent. Some, feeling shamed, stole looks around at the others. A number of themen finally spoke up that they agreed with Victor.As the men fell to debating among themselves what it was they ought to do, Nicciseized Richard’s arm from behind and drew him back to where she could speak inconfidence. “Richard, this fight here is more important.”“I can’t stay.”Her blue eyes flashed with bottled fury. “This is where you should be, leadingthese men. You’re the Lord Rahl. They’re counting on you.”“I am not responsible for their lives. They already made their choice as to howthey will live when they started the revolt. They did that on their own and theywon that battle. We all are fighting for what we believe in. We all are fightingfor the same thing—the right to live the life we want for ourselves. I’m doingwhat I believe I must.”“You’re running away from the fight to chase phantoms.”The sting of her words hung in the air, unanswered. Richard instead stepped awayfrom the sorceress and addressed the men.“The Old World and the New World are at war.” The crowd slowly fell silent aspeople craned their necks in order to see Richard and hear his words, “Thetroops on their way here are battle tested men from that war.As they’ve rampaged across the land, they’ve used their swords, axes, and flailsagainst both the armed and the unarmed people to the north, the people of theNew World. Those troops are experienced at overrunning cities and slaughteringthe inhabitants. When they get here, they will torture, rape, and murder thepeople of this city, just as they’ve done to the people in cities to the north…unless you stop them first.“But even if you do stop them, that will not be the end of it. The Order willsend more soldiers. If you defeat them, they will eventually send even more thenext time.”“Richard, what are you saying?” Ishaq asked into the still evening air. “Are yousaying that it is hopeless—that we should give up?”“No. I’m saying that you need to face the true dimension of what it means tofight the Imperial Order—the true nature of the task. If you wish to be free,then you need to do more than stand here in this place and defend your city.“No war was ever won defensively.“If you are to be truly free, then you must fight to put a stop to those whoseek to extinguish freedom. If you are to be truly free, then you must be partof the cause to rid the world of the Imperial Order. The D’Haran Empire, theland I rule, is all that now stands against the Order.” Richard slowly shook hishead. “But alone, they have no chance to win. Once the D’Haran Empire falls,Emperor Jagang will be freed up from the effort of that war and he will thenbring his full force to bear on any pockets of resistance to the Order’sbeliefs.“At the head of his list will be Altur’Rang. This is his home city. He will notallow the black mark of freedom to stand against his devout beliefs. He willturn loose on you his most vicious fighters—the sons of the Old World. You willbe isolated and gutted by Jagang’s army of your fellow countrymen. You will dieto a man, your male children will be murdered, and your wives and sisters anddaughters will be used as rewards for the brutes who enforce the Order’sauthority.”The crowd stood in rapt silence. They were now in the grip of fear. This was notthe brave and boastful talk they had expected to hear on the eve of battle.Victor cleared his throat. “You are trying to tell us something, Richard?”Richard nodded as he gazed out over the [??mule Ihrong] watching him from belowthe landing where ho stood. “Yes. I’m trying to tell you that you must do morethan stand and defend yourselves when these men come. You can’t win that kind ofwar. You must strike out at the Imperial Order and help bring them down.”Ishaq lifted a hand. “Bring them down? In what way?”“As you all well know, life under the Order offers nothing but decay and ruin.There is little work, little food, little to look forward to… except the promiseof glory in some afterworld life—but only in exchange for your selfless servicein this one. The priests of the Fellowship of Order have nothing to offer youbut misery, so they proclaim suffering a virtue and in exchange generously grantyou extravagant, eternal rewards in some other world. Rewards that cannot beexamined beforehand, rewards in a world that is unknowable, except, they claim,to them. Not one of you would be gullible enough to trade a dog for such hollowpromises, and yet legions have been swindled into eagerly offering up their ownlives, the only life they will ever have, in the unfair exchange.“Jagang invokes the cause of the Creator, the fight for mankind’s future, andthe elimination of those with the gift as the noble reasons for the Old World toinvade the New World. He tells his subjects that the people far away to thenorth are immoral heathens and, as a duty to the Creator, they must be struckdown.“In reality, Jagang is doing nothing more than producing a diversion to coverthe widespread poverty and unemployment created by the Imperial Order’sdoctrines. A failed Old World of crushing poverty and widespread death is thusblamed on traitors among the people—that would be you—and on their supposedlywicked brethren to the north. Jagang gives hopeless young men an object ofhatred upon which to extract revenge for their misery.“In so doing, out of the ranks of the young men of the Old World, Jagang hascreated an army of zealots. You know yourselves the throngs of such young menwho have departed from Altur’Rang to join the ‘noble’ cause. These men havelittle in life to look forward to and have grasped eagerly at the Order’steachings. Jagang has given them someone to blame for all their woes: those whodon’t submit to the teachings of the Order. These men have been indoctrinated ina culture of death and turned loose on those who have liberty, prosperity, andthe most hateful thing of all, happiness. Most are well beyond reason orredemption.“Fighting far from home, Jagang allows these savages to pillage and loot theirway across the land, hoping they will forget the miserable future awaiting themback home. In the name of the Creator and the Order they slaughter allopposition and take vast territory as their own. With their great numbers theyvanquish all who go up against them. They terrorize everyone in their path. Thepanic of waiting for the murdering horde to arrive is too much for many, and inthe hopes of being spared the worst of what Jagang’s men would do, some placessurrender and petition to join the cause of the Imperial Order.”“You are saying it is hopeless to fight them?” someone asked into the tenseevening silence.“I am telling you the true nature of what we all face,” Richard said. “But itdoes not have to be hopeless if you understand the essence of the fight.“For one thing, the Imperial Order has not fully grasped the corrosive effect ofdistance from their homeland. No matter how much they loot, they still need vastquantities of every kind of supply, from flour to make bread to feathers to makearrows. They can’t scavenge enough food to feed their numbers. They needcraftsmen and workers to support their fighting men and they need a steadystream of new soldiers to replace the vast numbers lost in the battles of thecampaign. It is difficult to fight in a strange and distant land. Their lossesfrom sickness alone have been staggering. Yet with reinforcements alwaysarriving they have been able to more than replace all they lose. Their armygrows constantly, becoming more formidable with each passing day. But that meansit also has more needs every day.“Those convoys of supplies that are constantly streaming north are vital to theefforts of the Imperial Order in conquering the New World. The New World mayseem a faraway problem to you, but it is your problem as much as those troopsheaded this way in a few days. Once those brutes up north are finished murderingmy people, they will be coming back here to murder you. If the Order wins, allof us lose. It doesn’t matter where we are. There will be no place to hide.“If you want to live, not just tomorrow, or the day after you defeat thosetroops headed this way, but to live next season, next year, and the year after;if you want to raise a family, keep what you earn, and better yourselves and thelives of your children; then you need to help to destroy the Order’s ability losurvive.“Victor and his men have already been doing this, but they are only able towhisper when they need to howl in fury. They need far more people to join themin the effort. You need to help in a determined effort to hit the Order’s supplyconvoys and destroy them. Kill their men going In fight. Cripple their abilityto carry on. You need to deprive the Order of flour and feathers andreinforcements. Every man who dies of starvation in the trackless mountains tothe north is a man the Order can’t send back to the Old World to shove his knifein your belly.“In addition, there are other means to prevail.” Richard gestured to Cara andNicci. “These two who now stand with me once stood against me. They were enemiesof what I believe in—of what you have come to believe in—but when I helped themto understand that I fight for life, for the values of life, they came torealize the truth and became warriors in that same cause.”Richard lifted a hand out at the crowd spread down the steps and across thelawns. “Look at all of you. Not all that long ago you were the enemies of theNew World. Many of you for much of your lives might have believed the lies ofthe Order. But when given a glimpse of the bright flame of what life can andshould be, you had the presence of mind to choose life. I now stand with formerenemies, in the heart of enemy territory, among a people once my enemy. Yet nowwe are all believers in the same cause: that life is worth living for its ownsake. Many of us have become fast friends. We are now all on the same side inthe greatest struggle of our lives.“It is possible to make some people who are working for the success of the Ordersee the wonder and beauty in this life. If you can do that, then you will haveone less person who wants to kill you. It would be my choice to win them allover to the truth and to have a world of people living in peace.“But there are those who are lost to the truth, lost to reason. They hate thatyou embrace what is good in life. If you can’t win these followers of the Orderto our side, then you must kill them, for surely, given the chance, they willkill you and destroy everything you hold dear. You must spread the fighteverywhere—leave no place safe for those who preach death. Yes, you will need tokill the wild-eyed fanatics eagerly fighting in the cause of the Order, but farmore important than that, you must strike at the root and kill those who preachthe doctrines of the Imperial Order.“They are the ones who corrupt and poison unthinking minds and, if not stopped,they will breed an endless supply of newly minted brutes to come after you andyour families. Men with such hate in their hearts recognize no boundaries. Theywill never allow you to exist because your prosperity and happiness puts the lieto what they teach.“If you wish to live free, then you must see to it that these disciples ofhatred know that there is no safe place for them, that their ways will not betolerated by civilized men, and that you will not rest until they are all hunteddown and killed because you understand that they want nothing less than to endcivilization. You must not let them have what they lust after.“You’ve all bravely taken the first step and thrown off your shackles. None ofyou need prove yourselves to me. But this is not about a single battle won. Thisis about the future of how you will live your lives from now on—how yourchildren and your grandchildren will live their lives. You’ve fought bravely.Many have already lost their lives pursuing our common goal and many more yetwill. But victory over evil is possible and within your power. You won a battlefor something profound: your own lives to live as you see fit. But don’t nowfail to see that the war for that ideal is a long way from being finished.“You have won your right to live free today. Now you must have the fire to fightto live free always.”“Freedom is never easy to keep and can easily be lost. All it takes is willfulindifference.Richard lifted an arm back toward the statue standing proudly in the afterglowof sunset. “That will to hold life dear, to be free, is the spirit of thisstatue we all so admire.”“But Lord Rahl,” someone complained, “that is too big a task for us. We aresimple people, not warriors. Maybe if you were to lead us it would bedifferent.”Richard laid a hand on his chest. “I was a simple woods guide when I realizedthat I had to rise to the challenges facing me. I, too, didn’t want to lace theseemingly invincible evil that loomed over me. But a wise woman—the woman thatstatue is modeled after—made me see that I had lo do so. I am no better thanyou, no stronger than you. I am simply a man who has come to understand the needto stand without compromise against tyranny. I have taken up that cause becauseI no longer wanted to live in fear, but to live my own life.“Those people in the New World to the north are fighting and dying every day.They are simple people like you. None of them wishes to fight, but they must orthey will surely die. Their fate today is your fate tomorrow. They can’tcontinue to stand alone and hope to win. When your time comes, neither will you.They need you to be a part of a free world, to attack those who bring the shadowof a dark age over all the world.”A man near the front spoke up. “But aren’t you saying the same thing as theOrder, that we must sacrifice for the greater good of mankind?”Richard smiled at the very idea. “Those who wish to impose an idea of a greatergood are simply haters of the good. It’s enlightened self-interest that causesme to lift a sword against the Imperial Order. It’s purely for your ownself-interest, and your self-interest in those you love, that I think you shouldfight—in whatever way you think you can best help our common goal. I’m notforcing you to fight for the greater good of mankind, but trying to make you seethat it’s a fight for your own life.“Don’t ever make the mistake of thinking that such self-interest is wrong.Self-interest is survival. Self-interest is the substance of life.“In your own reasoned self-interest, I suggest that you rise up and strike downthe Order. Only then can you truly have freedom.“The eyes of the Old World are upon you.”The dark figures of all the people in fading light stretched back as far asRichard could see. He was relieved to see a lot of nodding heads.Victor’s gaze swept over the men before he turned back to Richard. “I think weare of a mind, Lord Rahl. I will do what I can to see it through.”Richard clasped arms with Victor as the crowd broke into cheering. Finally, asmen all across Liberty Square began talking among themselves as to how best tomeet the challenge, Richard turned away and took Nicci aside. Cara followedclose on his heels.“Richard, I know the value of what you have just done, but these people stillneed you to—”“Nicci,” he said, cutting her off, “I have to leave in the morning. Cara isgoing with me. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I think it would be agood idea if you were to choose to stay and help these people. They’re facing aterrible enough challenge just with the soldiers, but they additionally mustface a wizard. You know a lot better than I how to counter that kind of threat.You could be a tremendous help to these people.”She looked for a long time into his eyes before she glanced to the crowd not faroff behind him and down the steps.“I need to be with you,” she said in a measured tone, but it still sounded tohim like a plea.“Like I said, it’s your life and I’m not going to tell you what to do, just likeI’d not like you trying to tell me what I must do.”“You should stay and help,” she said. She broke eye contact and looked away.“But it’s your life and you must do what you think best. I guess, after all youare the Seeker.” She again glanced at the men gathering around close to Victor,making plans. “These people may not right now voice objections to what you hadto say, but they will be thinking about it and they may very well decide later,after they face the soldiers, after a terrible and bloody fight, that they don’twish to do more.”“I was kind of hoping that if you stayed and help them defeat this wizard andthe troops coming this way, that you could then add your weight to my words andhelp convince them of what they need to do. Many of them are well aware of howmuch you know about the nature of the Order. They will put stock in what you sayto them, especially if you’ve just helped them save their city and keep theirfamilies safe.” Richard waited until she looked up at him before he went on.“After that, you could then come to join Cara and me.”She appraised his eyes as she folded her arms across her breasts. “You arcsaying that if I help stop the Order’s force coming to kill all these people,then you would allow me to join you?”“I’m just telling you what I think would be the most beneficial thing for you todo in our struggle to eliminate the Order. I’m not telling you what to do.”She looked away again. “But it would please you if I did as you suggest and stayto help these people.”Richard shrugged. “I admit to that.”Nicci sighed irritably. “Then I will stay, as you suggest, and help them defeatthe threat looming a few days away. But if I do that—defeat the troops andeliminate the wizard—then you would allow me to join you’/”“I said I would.”She finally, reluctantly, nodded. “I agree.”Richard turned. “Ishaq?”The man hurried close. “Yes?”“I need six horses.”“Six? You will be taking others with you?”“No, just Cara and me. We’ll be needing fresh mounts along the way so we canrotate the horses we ride to keep them strong enough for the journey. We needfast horses, not the draft horses from your wagons. And tack,” Richard added.“Fast horses…” Ishaq lifted his hat and with the same hand scratched his scalp.He looked up. “When?”“I need to leave as soon as it’s light enough.”Ishaq eyed Richard suspiciously. “I suppose this is to be in partial payment forwhat I owe you?”“I wanted to ease your conscience about when you could begin to repay me.”Ishaq succumbed to a brief laugh. “You will have what you need. I will see to itthat you have supplies as well.”Richard laid a hand on Ishaq’s shoulder. “Thank you, my friend. I appreciate it.I hope someday I can get back here and haul a load or two for you, just for oldtimes’ sake.”That brightened Ishaq’s expression. “After we are all free for good?”Richard nodded. “Free for good.” He glanced at the stars beginning to dot thesky. “Do you know a handy place where we can get some food and a place to sleepfor the night?”Ishaq gestured off across the broad expanse of the old palace grounds to thehill where the work shacks used to be. “We have inns, now, since you were herelast. People come to see Liberty Square and so they need rooms. I have built aplace up there where I rent rooms. They are among the finest available.” Helifted a finger. “I have a reputation to uphold of offering the best ofeverything, whether it be wagons to haul goods, or rooms for weary travelers.”“I have a feeling that what you owe me is going to be dwindling rapidly.”Ishaq smiled as he shrugged. “Many people come to see this remarkable statue.Rooms are hard to come by, so they are not cheap.”“I wouldn’t have expected them to be.”“But they are reasonable,” Ishaq insisted. “A good value for the price, And Ihave a stable right next door, so I can bring your horses once I collect them. Iwill do it now.”“All right.” Richard lifted his pack and swung it onto a shoulder. “At leastit’s not far, even if it is expensive.”Ishaq spread his hands expansively. “And the view at sunrise is worth theprice.” He grinned. “But for you, Richard, Mistress Cara, and Mistress Nicci, nocharge.”“No, no.” Lifting a hand, Richard forestalled any argument. “It’s only fair thatyou should be able to earn a return on your investment. Deduct it from what youowe me. What with the interest, I’m sure the amount has grown handsomely.”“Interest?”“Of course,” Richard said as he started toward the distant buildings. “You havehad the use of my money. It’s only fair that I be compensated for that use. Theinterest is not cheap, but it’s fair and a good value.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16As he walked into his room, Richard was pleased to see the wash basin. It wasn’ta bath, but at least he would be able to clean up before bed. He threw closedthe bolt on the door, locking himself in, even though he felt perfectly safe inthe small inn. Cara was in the room beside his. Nicci was in a room downstairson the first floor close to the entrance and right beside the only stairs up tothe second floor. Men stood guard both inside and outside the inn while yet moremen patrolled the streets in the area around the building. Richard hadn’tthought so many men were necessary, but Victor and the men were insistent aboutproviding the protection since enemy troops were in the area. In the end,appreciating the opportunity for a safe and peaceful night’s sleep, Richardhadn’t objected.He was so weary that he could hardly stand any longer. His hip sockets achedfrom the long day of walking over rough terrain. On top of the journey, theemotional talk with the people at Liberty Square had taken what energy he hadleft.Richard sloughed off his pack, letting it clunk down on the floor at the foot ofthe small bed, before stepping to the washstand and splashing water on his face.He didn’t know that water could feel so good.Nicci, Cara, and Richard had had a quick meal of lamb stew down in the smalldining room. Jamila, the woman who ran the place for Ishaq—another partner—hadbeen instructed by Ishaq to treat them as royalty. The round-faced woman hadoffered to cook them anything they desired. Richard hadn’t wanted to make afuss, and besides, the leftover lamb stew had meant there would be no waitingand they could get to sleep all that much sooner. Jamila had seemed a littledisappointed not to have the chance to cook them up something special. With thekind of meals they’d had over recent days, though, the bowl of lamb stew andfresh, crusty bread with loads of butter had been about the best food Richardcould recall having. Had it not been for so many troubling things on his mind hewould have savored it more.He knew that Cara and Nicci needed the rest as much as he did so he’d insistedthat each lake a room of their own. Both women had wanted to stay in the sameroom as Richard so that they could be close at hand and watch over him. He’d hadvisions of them both standing with their arms folded at the foot of his bed ashe slept. He’d maintained that nothing was going to get to him on the secondfloor, and besides, there were plenty of men to stand guard. They had relented,but reluctantly and only after he reminded them that the two of them would bemore help to him if they were well rested and alert. It was a luxury for all ofthem not to have to stand watch, for once, and be able to get the rest theyneeded.Victor had promised to come see Richard and Cara off in the morning. Ishaq hadpromised to have the horses in the stable and waiting long before then. BothVictor and Ishaq were sorry that he was leaving, but they understood that he hadhis reasons. None of them had asked where he was going, probably because theyfelt ill-at-ease talking about the woman none of them believed existed. He hadbegun to sense the distance it created in people when he mentioned Kahlan.From the tall window in his top floor room, Richard had a breathtaking view ofSpirit off across the grounds below the rise where the inn stood. With the wickon the lamp in his room turned down low, he had no trouble seeing the statue inwhite marble lit by a ring of torches in tall iron stanchions. He idly recalledthe many times he had been up on this same hillside looking down at EmperorJagang’s palace under construction. It hardly seemed like the same world. Hefelt as if he’d been dropped into some other life he didn’t know and all therules were different. Sometimes he wondered if he really was losing his mind.Nicci, in a room on the bottom floor close to the front door, probably couldn’tsee the statue, but Cara had the room next to his so she undoubtedly had thesame view. He wondered if she was taking advantage of it, and, if she was, whatshe thought of the statue she saw. Richard couldn’t imagine how she could notclearly remember everything it meant to him—to Kahlan. He wondered if she, too,felt as if she were living someone else’s life… or if she thought he was losinghis mind.Richard couldn’t imagine what could possibly have happened to make everyoneforget that Kahlan existed. He had held out some slim hope that the people inAltur’Rang would remember her, that it had only been those immediately nearbywhen she had disappeared who were affected. That hope was now dashed. Whateverthe cause, the problem was widespread.Richard leaned against the cabinet with the washbasin and tilted his head backas he closed his eyes for a moment. His neck and shoulders were sore from daysof carrying his heavy pack as they had trudged through dense and seeminglyendless woods. Throughout the swift and difficult journey even conversation had,for the most part, required Ion much effort. It felt good not to have to walkfor a while, even if when lie closed his eyes it seemed that all he could seewas a parade of endless forests. With his eyes closed, it felt as if his legswere still moving.Richard yawned as he lifted the baldric over his head and stood the Sword ofTruth against a chair beside the washstand. He pulled off his shirt and tossedit on the bed. It occurred to him that this would be a good time to wash some ofhis clothes, but he was too worn-out. He just wanted to clean up and then fallinto bed and sleep.He stepped over to the window again as he went about washing with a soapy cloth.The night was dead quiet but for the ceaseless drone of the cicadas. He couldn’tresist staring at the statue. There was so much of Kahlan in it that it made himheartsick. He had to force himself not to think about what horrors she might befacing, what pain she might be enduring. Anxiety constricted his breathing. Inan effort to set his worry aside for a while, he did his best to recall Kahlan’ssmile, her green eyes, her arms around him, the soft moan she sometimes made asshe kissed him.He had to find her.He dipped the cloth in the water and wrung it out, watching dirty water run backinto the basin, and saw that his hands were trembling.He had to find her.In another attempt to force his mind onto other things, he rested his gaze onthe washbasin, deliberately taking in the vines painted all around the edge. Thevines were blue, not green, probably so as to match the blue flowers stenciledon the walls and the blue flowers on the simple curtains and the decorativecover on the bed. Ishaq had done an admirable job of building a warm andinviting inn.The water in the basin, still as a woodland pool, suddenly trembled for noapparent reason.Richard stood stock-still, staring at it.The slack surface abruptly bunched into perfectly symmetrical harmonic waves,almost like the hair on a cat’s back standing on end.And then the whole building shuddered with a hard thump, as if struck withsomething huge. One of the panes of glass in the window cracked with a bridlepop. Almost instantly, from the far end of the building, came the [??nüillled]sound of splintering wood.Richard crouched, frozen, eyes wide, unable to tell what had caused theincomprehensible sound.His first thought was that a big tree had fallen on the place, but then heremembered that there were no large trees anywhere nearby.A heartbeat after the first jolt, came a second thump—louder this time. Closer.The building swayed under the crash of splintering wood. He glanced up, fearingthat the ceiling might collapse.Half a heartbeat later came another thump that shook the building. Shattering,splintering wood let out a high-pitched screech as if crying out in agony as itwas being ripped apart.THUMP. Crash. Louder, closer.Richard touched the fingers of one hand to the floor to keep his balance as thebuilding quaked under the jolt of the heavy impact. What had Marled at the farend of the building was rapidly coming closer.THUMP, CRASH. Closer yet.Splintering shrieks howled through the night air as wood was rent violentlyapart. The building swayed. Water sloshed in the basin, slopping over the rolledmetal edge with the painted blue vines. The sounds of ripping walls andsplintering boards melted together into one continuous roar.Suddenly, the wall to his left, the wall between his and Cara’s room, explodedtoward him. Clouds of dust billowed up. The noise was deafening.Something huge and black, nearly the size of the room itself, drove through thewall, splintering lath, sending plaster and debris showering through the air.The force of the concussion blew the door off its hinges and violently blastedthe glass and the mullions out of the window.Long ragged fragments of boards spun through the room. One smashed the chairthat held his sword, another piercing the far wall. His sword tumbled out ofreach. One piece whacked Richard’s leg hard enough to drop him to one knee.Animate darkness drove debris before it, sending everything flying, envelopingthe light and plunging the flying wreckage into a surreal, swirling gloom.Icy fright shimmered through Richard’s veins.He saw a cold cloud of his breath as he grunted with the effort of scrambling tohis feet.Darkness, like death itself, plunged toward him. Richard gasped a breath. Frigidair stabbed like icy needles into his lungs. Shock at the pain of the cuttingcold clenched his throat shut.Richard knew that life and death balanced on a razor’s edge only an instantwide.With every ounce of his strength driving him, he dove through the window as ifhe were diving into a swimming hole. The side of his body brushed past thedescending inky darkness. His flesh sizzled with a sharp sensation so cold thatit burned.In midair, plummeting through the window out into the night, fearing the longdrop, Richard snatched for the window’s frame and only just managed to seize itwith his left hand. He held on for dear life. His falling weight whipped himaround so hard that his body slammed into the side of the building with enoughforce to knock the wind from him. He hung by his one hand, dazed by the wallopagainst the outside wall, trying to gasp in a breath.The humid night air on top of the blow against the wall, coming right after thefrigid gasp in the room just before he’d jumped out the window, seemed toconspire to do its best to suffocate him. From the corner of his eye he saw thestatue in the fluttering torchlight. With her head thrown back, fists at hersides, and her back arched, the figure stood proud against the invisible powertrying to subdue her. The sight of it, the strength of it, made Richard at lastdraw in an urgent breath. He coughed and drew another, gasping for air as hisfeet searched for any purchase. They found none. He glanced down and saw thatthe ground was awfully far below him.It felt as if he might have ripped his shoulder from its socket. Hanging by onehand, he dared not let go. He feared that such a fall would at the least breakhis legs.Above, from the window, came a wail so shrill that it made every hair on hisbody stand on end and every nerve scream in sharp pain. It was a sound so black,so poisonous, so horrific that Richard thought that, surely, the veil tounderworld had ripped apart and the Keeper of the Dead had been loosed among theliving.The savage wail in the room above him drew out into a twisting, seething shriek.It was a sound of pure hate brought to life.Richard glanced up and almost let go. The fall, he thought, might be preferableto the thing in the room now suddenly streaming out through the window.A dark, incorporeal stain poured out of the shattered window like the exhalationof utter evil.Although it had no shape, no form, it was somehow crystal clear to Richard thatthis was something beyond mere wickedness. This was a scourge, like deathitself, on the hunt.As the inky shadow slipped through the window and out into the night, itsuddenly began to disintegrate into a thousand fluttering shapes that darted offin every direction, the cold darkness decomposing, melting into the night,dissolving into the heart of the blackest shadows.Richard hung by one arm, panting, unable to move, watching, waiting for thething to coalesce suddenly before his face and rip him apart.The hillside fell under the spell of a still hush. Death’s shadow had seeminglybecome part of the night. The cicadas, until then silent, started in again. Asthey began their shrill songs, the rising sound moved in a wave across the vastexpanse of grounds off toward the distant statue.“Lord Rahl!” a man below shouted. “Hold on!”The man, wearing a small-brimmed hat similar to Ishaq’s, scrambled around thebuilding, heading for the door. Richard didn’t think that he could hang on byhis one arm until someone came to help him. He groaned in pain but managed totwist himself around enough to lunge and with his other hand grasp thewindowsill, his legs swinging to and fro over a frightening drop. He wasrelieved to find that just taking some of the weight off his one arm helped easethe pain.He had just pulled his upper body in through the shattered window when he heardpeople spilling into his room. The lantern was gone, probably buried, so it washard to see. Men scrambled over the rubble littering the floor, their bootscrunching shattered bits of the wall, snapping fragments of broken woodenfurniture. Powerful hands seized him under his arms while others grabbed hisbell to help lilt him back inside. In the nearly pitch black room it wasdifficult to get his bearings.“Did you see it?” Richard asked the men as he still struggled to get his breath.“Did you see the thing that came out of the window?”Some of the men coughed on the dust while others spoke up that they hadn’t seenanything.“We heard the noise, the crashing, and the window breaking,” one of them said.“I thought the whole building was coming down.”Someone appeared with a candle and lit a lantern. The orange glow illuminated astartling sight. A second man, and then a third, held a lantern out to be setalight. Amid the swirling dust, the room was a confusing jumble, what with thebed overturned, the washstand embedded halfway through the far wall, and a hillof rubble across the floor.In the flickering light, Richard was able to better see the roughly round holethat had been blown through the wall. Broken lumber around the edges all juttedinto his room, indicating the direction of intrusion. That was hardly asurprise. The size of the hole, though, was surprising: It spanned nearly theentire distance from floor to ceiling. Most of what had once been the wall nowlay shattered all over the floor. Long splintered boards knitted togethersections of lath and chunks of plaster. He couldn’t imagine how something thathad made such a large rupture could have then made it out a window.Richard spotted his sword and worked it out from under broken boards. He proppedit up against the windowsill where it would be handy if he needed it, althoughhe wasn’t sure what his sword could have done against whatever it was that hadcome through the wall only to dissolve into the night.Men coughed from the thick dust still swirling through the air. Richard saw inthe lanternlight that they were all covered with the white dust, making themlook like a gathering of ghosts. He saw that he, too, was covered in the whiteplaster. The only difference was that he was also bleeding from dozens of smallcuts. The blood looked all the more stark against the white powder. He brieflybrushed some of the plaster dust from his hair, face, and arms.Worried about others who might have been buried or hurt, Richard took one of thelanterns from a man standing nearby and then scrambled to the top of the rubble.He held up the light, peering into the darkness beyond the hole. The sight wasastounding, although not unexpected because he had heard and felt, each one ofthose walls being violently breached.Each wall, in a straight line all the way back through the building, had a holesmashed through it. All the holes were similar to the one in the wall lo hisroom. At the end, Richard could see stars through the round opening in the far,outside wall.He stepped carefully over long, jagged fragments of wood. Some of the pile cavedin under his weight and it was a struggle to get his foot back out. Other thansporadic coughing, the men were mostly silent as they looked around in awe atthe damage wrought by something unknown, something powerful that had vanishedinto the night.Through the swirling dust, Richard saw, then, Cara standing in the middle of herroom looking off in the same direction as he, off toward the hole to theoutside. Her back was to him, her feet spread in a defensive stance. Her Agielwas gripped tightly in her right fist.Nicci, a flame dancing above her upturned palm, rushed into Richard’s loomthrough the broken doorway.“Richard! Are you all right?”From atop the wreckage, Richard rubbed his left shoulder as he moved his arm. “Iguess so.”Nicci murmured angrily under her breath as she stepped carefully over debris.“Any idea what’s going on?” one of the men asked.“I’m not sure,” Richard said. “Was anyone hurt?”The men all peered around at each other. A few offered that they didn’t thinkso, that everyone they knew was accounted for and safe. Another man said thatthe other rooms on the top floor had been unoccupied.“Cara?” Richard called as he leaned into the dark hole. “Cara, are you allright?”Cara didn’t answer, nor did she move. She stood fixed in the same stance.His anxiety growing, Richard scrambled the rest of the way over the angledboards and crumbled plaster. Using one hand against the ceiling to help himbalance atop the unstable debris, he stepped through the hole into Cara’s room.The destruction was much the same as it had been in his room. Two walls, ratherthan just one, were holed, but the impact had thrown the material from thesecond wall into Richard’s room. The glass in her window, too, was blown out,but the door still hung, if crookedly, in place.Cara stood directly in the centerline between the two holes, but she was backedcloser to the void in the wall into Richard’s room. Wreckage lay all around her.Her leather outfit appeared to have kept her from being shredded by the flyingdebris.“Cara?” Richard called again as he made his way down the shifting pile ofrubble.Cara stood unmoving in the dark room, still staring off into the distance. Nicciscrambled over the broken boards and plaster and through the hole in the wall.She seized Richard’s arm briefly for support as she caught up with him.“Cara?” Nicci said as she brought her hand holding the flame around in front ofCara’s face.Richard held up the lantern. Cara’s eyes were opened wide, staring, yetunseeing. Tears had left damp trails through the dust on her face. She stillhadn’t moved from her defensive stance, but now that he was close, Richard couldsee that her entire body trembled.He gripped her arm but, startled, drew back.She was as cold as ice.“Cara? Can you hear us?” Nicci touched Cara’s shoulder and with the samesurprise as Richard drew back.Cara didn’t react. It was as if she really were frozen in place. Nicci held theflame up close to the Mord-Sith’s face. Her skin looked almost pale blue, butwith the way she was covered in a layer of white dust, he wasn’t sure if thatwas really true or not.Richard slipped an arm around Cara’s waist. It was like putting his arm around ablock of ice. His instinct was to draw back, but he refused to allow himself todo so. He realized by how his shoulder hurt that he wasn’t going to easily beable to lift her by himself.He looked back at the faces framed in the ragged round hole in the wall, “Couldsome of you help me with her?”Men scrambled over the wreckage, spilling into Cara’s room, causing yet moredust to billow up. With others bringing light close, Nicci let the small flameextinguish as she stepped close to the Mord-Sith. The men gathered into a knotas they silently watched the sorceress.Frowning in concentration, she pressed the flats of her hands lo Cara’s temples.With a cry Nicci staggered back. Richard reached out with his free hand andcaught her elbow to prevent her from tumbling backwards over the tangled rubble.“Dear spirits,” Nicci whispered, panting to catch her breath as if fromunexpected pain.“What?” Richard asked. “What is it?”The sorceress placed her hands over her heart, still gulping air as sherecovered from the unexpected. “She’s barely alive.”With his chin, Richard pointed to the door. “Let’s get her out of here.”Nicci nodded. “Downstairs—my room.”Richard, without thinking, swept Cara up in his arms. Fortunately, the men wereright there to help when they saw him wince in pain.“Dear Creator,” one of the men exclaimed as he lifted her leg, “she’s as cold asthe Keeper’s heart.”“Come on,” Richard said, “help me get her downstairs.”Once they lifted her, Cara’s limbs were easily moved, although they wouldn’t golimp. The men helping Richard carry Cara shuffled through the rubble. One of themen kicked the broken door out of the way. They earned her down the narrowstairs feet first. Richard held her shoulders.At the bottom of the stairs, Nicci directed them into her room and to the bed.They gently laid Cara down as Nicci first yanked the covers out from under thestricken woman. Once Cara was settled into the bed, Nicci immediately coveredher with the blankets.Cara’s blue eyes were still opened wide, staring, it seemed, into some distantnothingness. Occasionally, a tear set out from the corner of her eye on a slowjourney across her cheek. Her chin, her shoulders, her arms trembled.Richard pried Cara’s fingers open, making her release the Agiel she still had ina death grip. Her eyes showed no reaction. He endured the excruciating pain oftouching her Agiel until he got it out of her grip and was able to release it tohang by the chain around her wrist.“Why don’t you all wait outside?” Nicci said in a quiet voice. “Give me somelime to see what I can do?”The men made their way out, saying that they were going back on patrol, or tostand guard, in case they were needed.“If that thing comes back,” Richard told them, “don’t try to stop it. Come getme.”One of the men cocked his head in puzzlement. “What thing, Lord Rahl? What is itwe’re supposed to be looking for?” ■“I’m not sure. All I was able to see was a huge shadow as it came through thewall and then went out the window.”The man looked upward. “If it broke that hole through the wall to get through,then how did it get out a small window?”“I don’t know,” Richard admitted. “I guess I didn’t really get a good look atit.”The man glanced up again, as if he could see the wreckage above, “We’ll keep oureyes wide open. You can be sure of that.”It was then that Richard remembered that he’d left his sword up in his room. Itmade him uneasy to be without it. He wanted to go get it, but he didn’t want toleave Cara’s side.After the last man had left, Nicci sat on the side of the bed as she held a handover Cara’s forehead. Richard knelt close.“What do you think is wrong?” he asked.Nicci let the hand settle on Cara’s forehead. “I have no idea.”“But you can do something to make her better?”Nicci’s answer was a long moment in coming. “I’m not sure. Whatever I can do,though, I will.”Richard took hold of Cara’s still trembling, frigid hand. “Do you think weshould shut her eyes? She hasn’t even blinked.”Nicci nodded. “Probably not a bad idea. I think it’s the dust making her tearsrun.”One at a time, Nicci carefully shut Cara’s eyes. It somehow made Richard feelbetter that Cara wasn’t staring at nothing.Nicci returned her hand to Cara’s forehead as she placed her other hand high onher chest. While Nicci held a wrist, an ankle, and slipped a hand under the backof Cara’s neck, Richard went to the washbasin and returned with a wet cloth. Hecarefully washed Cara’s face and brushed some of the dust and bits of plasterout of her hair. Through the wet cloth, he could feel the icy cold of her flesh.With as warm and humid as it was, Richard couldn’t understand how she could bethis cold. He remembered, then, how when the black thing had come crashing intohis room the air had suddenly gone icy cold, he remembered the painfully coldtouch as he brushed past it as he leaped out the window.“Don’t you have any idea what’s wrong with her?” Richard asked.Nicci absently shook her head as she concentrated on pressing the palms of bothhands against Cara’s temples.“Any idea what that thing was that came through the walls?”Nicci turned to look up at him. “What?”“I asked if you had any idea what could have done this? What crashed through thewalls?”Nicci looked exasperated by the question. “Richard, go wait outside. Please.”“But I want to be in here, with her.”Nicci gently took his wrist and lifted his hand off of Cara’s. “You areinterfering. Please, Richard, let me do this alone? It’s easier without youwatching over my shoulder.”Richard felt awkward being in the way. “If it will help Cara.”“It will,” she said as she turned back to the woman in her bed.He stood and watched briefly. Nicci was already absorbed in slipping a handunder Cara’s back.“Go,” the sorceress murmured.“The thing that came through our rooms was cold.”Nicci looked back over her shoulder. “Cold?”Richard nodded. “It was so cold that I could see my breath. If felt painfullycold to be near it.”Nicci considered his words briefly before turning back to Cara. “Thank you forthe information. When I can, I will come out and let you know how she is doing.I promise.”Richard felt helpless. He stood in the doorway for a moment watching the almostimperceptible movement of Cara’s shallow breathing. The lamplight lit Nicci’sfall of blond hair as she leaned over the Mord-Sith, working to find out whatwas wrong.Richard had the awful feeling that he knew what was wrong with Cara. He fearedthat she had been touched by death itself."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17After pulling his pack from the rubble, Richard briefly cleaned him self up andput on a shirt. He also put on his sword.He didn’t know what had crashed into the building, but it seemed pretty likelythat it had been coming for him. He had no idea if his sword would help himfight such a thing, but it did make him feel a little better having it at hand.Outside the night air was still and warm. One of the men saw him emerge from thedoor and stepped closer.“How is Mistress Cara?”“We don’t know, yet. She’s alive—that’s encouraging, at least.”The man nodded.Richard recognized the man’s hat. “You were the one who saw me hanging from thewindow?”“That’s right.”“Did you get a look at the thing that attacked us?”“I’m afraid not. I heard all the commotion, looked up, and there you werehanging by one arm. I thought you might fall. That’s all I saw.”“No dark thing coming out of the window?”The man clasped his hands behind his back as he thought about it a moment. “No…except maybe I might have just caught the shadow of something. At the most,that’s all I might have seen, a glimpse of a shadow. I was more concerned withgetting up there before you fell.”After thanking the man, Richard walked for a time without really thinking aboutwhere he was going. He felt as if he were in a daze, his thoughts as heavy anddark as the muggy night. Everything he knew and cared about seemed to bedisintegrating. He felt helpless.The murky humidity obscured the stars and the moon hadn’t come up yet, but thelights burning in the city all around reflecting off the haze provided enoughlight for him to make his way to the edge of the hill. He fell useless, notbeing able to help Cara. She had so many times been there to help him. This timeshe had faced something that was more than she could handle.At the brink of the drop, Richard stood for a time gazing off at the statue ofSpirit in the distance. Victor had made the ring of iron stanchions that heldthe torches. Kahlan, fascinated by the process, had stood for must of a day inthe blacksmith’s sweltering shop watching him shape the white hot iron. Victorhad not frowned once that day, but had smiled at her genuine interest as heshowed her how he worked the metal to achieve what he wanted.Richard also remembered Kahlan’s awe at seeing that carving of hers beingreproduced in towering white marble. He remembered when that small statue inbuttery smooth, rich, aromatic walnut was finally returned to her and she hadclutched it to her breast. He had watched the way her lingers had glidedlovingly over the flowing robes. Richard remembered, too, the way her green eyeshad then looked up into his eyes.Having no one believe him about Kahlan made him feel completely alone andisolated. He’d never been in a situation like this before, where people—peoplewho sincerely cared about him—thought that he was only imagining the things hetold them. It was a frightening, helpless feeling to have people think he wasout of touch with reality.But even that was not nearly as frightening as his worry about what might havebecome of Kahlan.He didn’t know what to do to find her. All he knew for sure was that he had toget help. He didn’t know if that help would be forthcoming, but he fullyintended to do whatever was necessary to make sure he got it.After a time, he made his way back to the inn. Jamila was at the bottom of thestairs sweeping up dust and bits of plaster.She eyed him as he walked in. “You must pay for this.”“What do you mean?”With the handle of her broom, she pointed up the stairs. “The damage. I haveseen the place up there. You must pay for fixing it.”Richard was taken aback. “But I didn’t do it.”“It is your fault.”“My fault? I was in my room. I didn’t cause the damage and I don’t know whatdid.”“You and the woman were the only two in rooms up there. The rooms were line whenyou look them. Now they are a mess. It will cost a lot to fix them. I didn’tcause the damage—why should I have to pay? The damage is your fault so you mustpay—including for the loss of rent while they an being repaired.”She had demanded he pay for fixing the rooms without first asking how Cara was,or even expressing concern for her.“I will give Ishaq my permission to deduct the cost from what he owe me.”Richard glared at the woman. “Now, if you will excuse me.”With the back of his hand he pushed her aside as he stepped past her into thedark hall. She huffed at him before turning back to her sweeping Not knowingwhere else to go, he paced slowly up and down the hall Jamila finally finishedcollecting the debris from the first floor and trim died off to other businessas he continued to pace. He finally sat with his back against the wall oppositethe door to Nicci’s room. He didn’t know what else to do, where else to go. Hewanted to see Cara.Richard drew his knees up and locked his fingers over them. He rested his chinon the back of his hands as he thought about what Jamila had said.In a way, she was right. The thing had been coming for him. Had he not beenthere it wouldn’t have happened. If anyone else had been hurt or killed he wouldreally be to blame for bringing danger near them. If not for him, Cara wouldn’tbe hurt.He cautioned himself to put the blame on the guilty. That was Jagang and thoseworking toward his goals. It was Jagang who had ordered the creation of thebeast that was coming after Richard. Cara had simply been in the way. Cara hadbeen trying to protect him from what Jagang and the Sisters of the Dark hadcreated.As Richard thought about Victor’s men who had been killed a few days back,probably by that same beast, he couldn’t help but to feel the awful weight ofguilt.And yet, the thing that had come into the inn had not harmed him. Richard had nodoubt that it would have, but then it had simply vanished before its sinisterwork was finished. He couldn’t imagine why it would do such a thing. Or why ithad come through the walls the way it had. After all, if it went out the window,why didn’t it just break in through the window in the first place? Whatever itwas had demonstrated awareness by heading right for his room. Had it come in thewindow it would likely have had him before he knew what was happening. The thingthat had killed Victor’s men had behaved differently. Cara had not been rippedto shreds in the way they had, although it was clear that she had been seriouslyhurt.He began to question that it really had been the same creature that had killedVictor’s men. What if Jagang had created more than one beast, more then oneweapon to come after him? What if the Sisters of the Dark had spawned an army ofcreatures to hunt him? All the questions seemed to swirl around in his mind,unable to form into answers.Richard jumped when Nicci shook his shoulder. He realized that he must havefallen asleep.“What?” he asked, rubbing his eyes. “What time is it? How long has it been…”“It’s been a few hours,” Nicci said in a quiet, tired voice. “It’s the middle ofthe night.”Richard rose expectantly to his feet. “Cara’s all right, then? You healed her?”Nicci stared at him for what seemed an eternity. It felt to Richard, as helooked into Nicci’s timeless eyes, as if his heart were coming up in his throat.“Richard,” she finally said in a voice so soft and compassionate that it madehis breathing stop, “Cara isn’t going to make it.”Richard blinked at the words, trying to be certain that he understood what Nicciwas really saying.“I don’t understand.” He cleared his throat. “What do you mean?”Nicci gently laid a hand on his arm. “I think you should come in and see herwhile she is still with us.”Richard seized her shoulders. “What are you talking about?”“Richard…” Nicci’s gaze sank to the floor. “Cara isn’t going to make it. She isdying. She won’t live the night.”Richard tried to retreat from the sorceress, but his back met the wall. “Fromwhat? What’s wrong with her?”“I don’t know, exactly. She’s been touched by something that has… has broughtdeath into her. I don’t know how to explain it because I don’t really knowexactly what she is dying from. All I know is that it has overwhelmed her body’sdefenses and moment by moment she is slipping away.”“But Cara is strong. She’ll fight it. She’ll make it.”Nicci was shaking her head. “No, Richard, she won’t. I don’t want to give youfalse hope. She is dying. I think she may even want to die.”Richard came forward off the wall. “What? That’s crazy. She has no reason towant to die.”“You can’t say that, Richard. You don’t know what she is going through. Youdon’t know her reasons. Maybe the suffering is too much for her. Maybe she can’tendure the pain and she only wants it to end.”“If not for herself, Cara would do anything to stay alive in order to protectme.”Nicci licked her lips as she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. “Maybe you’reright, Richard.”Richard didn’t like being humored. He looked from the door back to thesorceress. “Nicci, you can save her. You know how to do such things.”“Look, you had better come see her before—”“You have to do something. You have to.”Nicci hugged her arms around herself. She looked away, her eyes brimming withtears.“I swear, Richard, I tried everything I knew or could think of. Nothing was ofany help. Death already has her spirit and I can no longer reach that far. Sheis breathing, but barely. Her heart is weak and nearly gone. Her whole body isshutting down as she slips away. I’m not even sure that she is really even stillalive in the sense we think of as a person being alive. She is only here by athread, and that thread will not hold for long.”“But, can’t…” He could think of no words to hold back the weight of griefbeginning to slide in on him.“Please, Richard,” Nicci whispered, “come see her before she is gone. Say whatyou would to her while you have the chance. You will forever hate yourself ifyou don’t.”Richard felt numb as Nicci led him into the room. This couldn’t be happening. Itjust couldn’t. This was Cara. Cara was like the sun; she couldn’t die. She was…she was his friend. She couldn’t die."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18The feeble glow of two lanterns failed to do much to brighten the murky room.The smaller one sat on a table in the corner, as if cowering in The presence ofdeath itself. The other stood on a bedside table beside a glass of water and adamp cloth, struggling to hold the gathered shadows ill bay. A brocade bedcoverwith luxuriant gold fringe was draped over Cara, her arms limp atop it, one ofits corners hanging down over the side of the bed to puddle on the floor.Cara didn’t look like Cara. She looked cadaverous. Even in the golden light ofthe lamp, her face looked ashen. Richard didn’t see her breathing.He could hardly draw a breath himself. He could feel his knees trembling. Thelump in his throat seemed as if it might choke him. He wanted to fall on her andbeg her to wake.Nicci leaned close, gently touching Cara’s face. Her fingers slid down to theside of her neck. Richard noticed that Cara’s terrible shuddering had finallyceased. He didn’t think that was the good news it might appear to be.“Is she… is she…”Nicci looked back over her shoulder. “She’s still breathing, but I’m afraid it’scoming slower.”Richard worked his tongue, wetting the roof of his mouth so that he could formwords. “You know, Cara has a man she cares about.”“She does? Really?”Richard nodded. “Most people don’t think that Mord-Sith can ever really careabout anyone, but they can. Cara cares about a soldier. General Meiffert.Benjamin cares for her, too.”“You know him?”“Yes. He’s a good man.” Richard stared at the blond braid lying over Cara’sshoulder and out over the brocade bedcover. “I haven’t seen him in ages. He’swith the D’Haran army.”Nicci looked skeptical. “Ami Cara admitted to you that she cares about thisman?”Richard shook his head as he stared at Cara’s familiar face. Her beautiful facewas now sunken and pale and only looked like a ghost of her former self.“No. Kahlan told me. The two of them became pretty close over the course of theyear they were with the D’Haran army while you had me down here in Altur’Rang.”Nicci looked away and fussed with the covers over Cara. As Richard steppedcloser, Nicci moved over to a chair beside the table to be out of his way. Hefelt as if he were outside of his own body, watching from somewhere above,watching himself go to one knee, watching himself take up Cara’s cold hand,watching himself hold it to his cheek.“Dear spirits, don’t do this to her,” he whispered. “Please,” he added with achoking sob, “don’t take her.”He looked over at Nicci. “She wanted to die as a Mord-Sith, fighting for ourcause, not in bed.”Nicci offered the smallest of smiles. “She had her wish.”The words, making it sound as if Cara was already dead, hit him like a blow. Hecouldn’t allow this to happen. He just couldn’t. Kahlan was gone, and now this.He just couldn’t let it happen.He cupped a hand to Cara’s icy face. It felt like touching the dead. Richardswallowed back the tears.“Nicci, you’re a sorceress. You saved me when I was near death. No one else butyou would have ever been able to come up with a solution. No one but you couldhave saved me. Isn’t there anything at all that you can think of to do forCara?”Nicci slipped forward off the chair to kneel beside him. She took up his handand held it to her lips. He felt a tear fall onto the back of the hand she sotenderly held, as if she were a humble subject beseeching her king’sforgiveness.“I’m so sorry, Richard, but there isn’t. I hope you know that I would doanything it took if I could save her, but I can’t. This is beyond my ability. Atime comes when we all have to die. Her time has come and I can’t change it.”Richard blinked at the watery sight of the death scene, the room barely lit bythe weak light of two small flames. The bed holding Cara seemed lo float byitself in that light, with darkness waiting all around her.He nodded. “Nicci, please, could you leave me alone with her? I want to be alonewith her when the times comes that… It’s nothing against you. It’s just that Ithink I should be alone with her.”“I understand, Richard.” Nicci’s fingers touched his back as she stood and then,as if reluctant to break that contact with the living, trailed along hisshoulder as she moved past. “I’ll be close by if you need me,” she said as herliving touch ended.The door softly shut behind her, leaving the room in silence. Even though theheavy drapes were closed over the window, Richard could hear the ceaselesschorus of the cicadas outside.He could no longer hold back the tears. He laid his head on Cara’s middle as hesobbed, clutching her limp hand.“Cara, I’m so sorry. It’s my fault. It was after me, not you. I’m so sorry.Please, Cara, don’t leave me. I need you so much.”Cara was the only one who followed him because she believed in him. She mighthave agreed with Nicci that he was dreaming up Kahlan, but she still believed inhim. With Cara, that wasn’t a contradiction. More and more lately, it seemedthat her faith in him was all that was holding him together and keeping himfocused on what he had to do. There were frightening moments when he no longerknew if he believed in himself. It was so hard to face an entire world thatthought he was delusional. It was so hard to do what he believed in when almostno one believed in him. But Cara believed in him even if she didn’t believe inKahlan’s existence. There was something unique about that sentiment, somethingunlike even Nicci or Victor’s respect for him.He held Cara’s face in both hands as he kissed her forehead.He hoped she wasn’t suffering. He hoped it was a peaceful end to a life I hathad been anything but peaceful.She was so pale, her breathing so shallow.Her flesh felt as cold as death.Hating that she was so cold, Richard pulled the bedcover aside as he leaned overand slipped his arms around her, hoping that his warmth would help her.“Take my warmth,” he whispered in her ear. “Take all you need. Please, Cara,take warmth from me.”Lying there holding her, Richard descended into a fog of agony. He knew how muchthis woman had suffered. He knew what her life had been like, he knew how muchshe had been hurt, he had endured some of the things she had endured under themad rule of his father, Darken Rahl. He had suffered some of the same pain andhopelessness. Perhaps more than anyone else, he could truly empathize with her.He knew how strangers had taken her into a world of pain and madness. Richardknew because he had been there, too. He had so wanted to bring her back fromthat dark and terrible place.“Take my warmth, Cara. I’m here for you.”He opened himself to her, opened his need to her, opened himself to her need.He clutched her tightly in his arms as he wept against her shoulder. He almostfelt that if he were to hold her tight enough, she couldn’t slip away intodeath.Richard could feel as he held her in his arms that she was still alive and I hecouldn’t bear for that to end. He wished so much that Nicci could have’ donesomething. If anyone deserved to be healed, it was Cara. At that moment, morethan anything, he wanted her to be healed.Richard opened himself, his very soul, to that purpose.He released himself into his empathy for this woman who had given him so much.More than once she had risked her life to follow his orders. She had oftenrisked her life for him in open defiance of his orders. She had followed himacross the world. Countless times she had placed herself between danger and hisand Kahlan’s lives. Cara deserved life, deserved all the goodness in life. Hewanted nothing but to make her whole again. He gave all of himself over to thatdesire. He held back nothing in his focused need to have Cara stay among theliving.To that end, to that desperate desire, he consciously sought the life within heras he descended into the swirling current of her agony. As fast as that thought,he found his mind with hers, with her agonizing pain. He held her tight in hisarms as he wept with her desolate suffering.He gritted his teeth, held his breath, and pulled her pain into himself. Hewanted nothing more than to draw that pain away from her. He spared nothing toprotect himself from the onslaught that suddenly inundated him. He felteverything she felt. He suffered everything she suffered. He pressed his openmouth against her shoulder, muffling his scream as the pain lanced through him.They were in an empty, dark, and hopeless place… a lifeless place.He shook with her suffering as he lifted some of her burden. She held tight tothe pain, loath to release it, especially to him. But as weak as she was, he wasable lo draw it anyway, and then he drew yet more.Lifting and uncovering the layers of suffering, he felt the icy touch of deathwithin her.The raw fear at such an encounter was as arresting as anything he had everconfronted. Cara was saturated in that dark and icy sensation. He shook with thesuffering he shared with her, with the dread they together fell. His mindtwisted with the wrenching pain until it was a terrible and seeminglyinsurmountable struggle just to maintain his own will to go on.Richard was swept into a coursing, cold current of hopeless misery that consumedhim. It seemed more than he could bear, and yet he endured it and took on more.He wanted her to take on his strength, his living warmth. But to do that, hewould first have to survive pulling that dark poison into himself while at thesame time giving over to her his strength.Time lost all meaning. The pain itself was the embodiment of forever.“Death will come often, offering to take you… wanting to take you,” he whisperedagainst her ear. “Don’t accept the offer, Cara. Stay. Don’t accept death.”I want to die.That single thought came spiraling up through the agonizing desolation. Itshocked and terrified him. What if trying to hold on to life was more than shecould endure? What if it was more than he could endure? What if he was askingmore of her than she could abide?… more than he had had a right to ask?“Cara,” he whispered into her ear, “I need you to live. Please, I need you tolive.”I can’t.“Cara, you are not alone. I’m here with you. Hold on. For me, hold on and let mehelp you.”Please, let me go. Let me die. I’m begging you, if you care for me, then leaveme… let me die.She began to slip away. He clutched her tighter. He pulled more of her sufferinginto himself. Her inner self wailed in agony as she fought him.“Cara, please”—he gasped against the torrent of pain flooding through him “letme help you. Please don’t leave me.”I don’t want lo live. I have failed you. I should have saved you when Nicci camelo capture you. I know that now—you made me see it. I would die for you, but Ifailed in my duty, in my promises to myself. There is no reason for me to live.I am not worthy to be your protector. Please, let me go.Richard was stunned to grasp the despair in her longing, but more than that, hewas horrified by it.He gathered that pain, too, and lifted it from her. He took it even as she triedto hold on to it, to slip away from him.“Cara, I love you. Please don’t leave me. I need you.”He fought to draw more of her agony into himself. He overpowered her resistanceand took more yet. She was unable to stop him. He lifted the ashen robes ofdeath dragging her down. Richard held her tight in his arms as he opened hisheart, his need, his soul.She wailed in heartbreak. He understood the crushing loneliness.“I’m with you, Cara. You aren’t alone.”Richard soothed her even as he struggled to endure the stunning agony of theevil that had touched her. It was not simply the pain of it, but the bleakhorror of it that was killing her, and now that same cold desolation was slowlycrushing him—and at the same time her blinding suffering blocked his healingpower from flowing into her.He suddenly felt as if he had swum out to save a drowning person and now theywere both caught up in the same savage torrent and they were both drowningtogether in the black waters of death.If he was to have a chance—if she was—he first had to lift enough of hersuffering. He had to hold the weight of it for her. He pulled the pain onward,heedless of it, welcoming it, drawing it with all his might.When he felt that full weight of misery and anguish gathered into the core ofhimself, he had to struggle mightily to hold on to his own life at the same timeas he let flow his power, his healing strength, his healing heart. Richard hadnever been taught how to heal, how to direct his power, he could only let thewarmth of it flow into her.I don’t want to live. I have failed you. Please, let me die.“Why do you want to leave me? Why?Because only in that way can I serve you, because then you can have another whowill not fail you.“Cara, that isn’t true. Something is wrong. Something neither of usunderstands.” Through the pain, Richard fought to get the words out. “Yon didn’tfail me. You have to believe me. You must believe in me. That is what I needmore then anything—for you to be with me and believe in me. It is you I need,not your service. Please, I need you. I need you to live. That is theservice—your life makes mine better.”He fought with all his might to hold on—to hold Cara with him—but the weight ofthe darkness within seemed bottomless. As the barriers of his restraintcollapsed, he felt as if he were plunging into a molten void, spiraling everdownward into that dark shadow that had come through the wall for him. He sawflashes of it as she had seen it, saw the heart-Mopping terror of it crashing inon her.That was the core of her dread, that vile thing, that death incarnate, comingfor him, right through her. This was not the gentle dissolution of consciousnessinto the void of nonexistence. This was every nightmare come to life, come torip the life out of the living. This was dark death descending upon her, allalone and defenseless, that merciless reaper of souls come to rip hers out whileshe screamed her life away.As she’d stood before it, blocking its way, she had taken its deadly touch.He understood, then, that Cara felt she had failed him before, with Nicci, andthis time she had been determined to die to prove her oath. Madness still dweltwithin her.She believed that death falling in upon her would be her redemption in his eyesand so she refused to shrink before it.She wanted to die for him to prove herself to him.As it had come through the wall and through her room, Cara had tried to stealthe power from death itself.Richard felt that torturous touch envelope him in its all-consuming agony. Itwas a touch so cold it began to freeze his heart.The world began slipping away from him, as it had begun to slip away from her.He was lost in the crushing pain of that deadly touch."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19It felt to Richard as if he were trapped beneath the ice in the swill, ravenwaters of a frozen river. The shadow of panic swirled ever closer around him.He was exhausted and didn’t have any reserve of strength left.As the specter of failure loomed, and the full realization of what such afailure would mean came to him, he rallied his will and exerted greater effortto fight his way toward the remote light of consciousness. Even though he wasaware that he had managed to come partially awake, he was still in some distant,deep place and having difficulty completing the journey. He struggled to riseup, struggled for the life above, but couldn’t break through.Even as Richard tried to press himself harder, it seemed too difficult, too far.For the first time, he considered the peace of surrender… truly considered it,as had she before it had dragged her under.The deadly fangs of failure hovered closer.Driven by the fright of the full realization of everything that such a defeatwould mean, he drew together his strength, focused his will, and with desperatepassion reached toward the world of life.With a gasp, his eyes opened.The pain had been crushing. He felt dizzy and sick from the encounter with suchmalevolence. He still trembled with the power of it. After such raw innerviolence, he feared that every hammer beat of his heart might be the last. Theslick touch of depravity had bequeathed him a repugnant memory of the gaggingstench of rotting corpses, making it nearly impossible to draw the full breathhe needed.He had reached into Cara’s soul and he had felt an alien evil lurking there,within her, sucking the life from her, pulling her into the dark eternity ofdeath. It had been a debilitating dread beyond anything he had ever felt before,beyond the mere fear of the black abyss of eternity.It had been the grinning, linked vow of unimaginable terrors that were comingfor him.At first it had seemed that he had touched the icy face of death itself, but henow knew that he hadn’t. Despite his revulsion, he knew that it was somethingother than simply death.Death was merely a part of its poisonous architecture.Death was inanimate. This was not.He hurt so much that he was unsure at that moment if he would have the strengthto ever stand again, the strength required to live. His bones ached. The marrowof his bones ached. He couldn’t seem to stop trembling. Yet the pain was morethan mere physical agony; it was an abhorrent misery that had seeped through hissoul and touched every aspect of his existence.The quiet room at last began to float into focus around him. The lamps stillheld back the veil of darkness. Beyond the heavy drapes the cicadas still sangtheir song of life.Lying on the bed, still embracing Cara protectively in his arms, Richard was atlast able to draw the full breath he so desperately needed. As he did, herelished the fragrance of her hair, savored the scent of the warm, moist skinalong the curve of her neck, and in so doing the agony began to recede.He felt Cara’s arms tightly embracing him. Downy soft hair behind her earcaressed the side of his face.“Cara?” he whispered.She reached up and ran a hand tenderly down the back of his head as sheunashamedly held him against her. “Shh,” she soothed in his ear. “It’s allright.”He was having trouble making sense of things.He was somewhat disoriented to find himself holding Cara in his arms, to findher holding him so tenderly in hers, to realize they were locked in such anintimate embrace. He could feel the entire length of her pressed against him.But then, nothing could be more intimate than what they had shared in that darkplace as they together faced the evil that had taken her.He ran his tongue across his cracked lips and tasted salty tears.“Cara…”She nodded against the side of his face. “Shh,” she soothed again. “It’s allright. I’m with you. I won’t leave you.”He drew away just enough to look into her eyes. They were blue and clear,revealing a depth he had never seen before. She studied his face with a kind ofcaring, knowing sympathy.At that moment, he clearly saw in her eyes that this was Cara and no more. Inthat moment, he saw that the appellation of Mord-Sith had been stripped awaydown to her soul. In that moment, it was Cara, the woman, the individual, andnothing else.It was as revealing and profound a view of her as he had ever had. It wasstartlingly beautiful.“You are a very rare person, Richard Rahl.”The soft breath of her words against his face soothed some of the lingering painas seductively as did her arms, as did her eyes, as did her words, as did theliving, breathing warmth of her.Even so, the agony he had lifted from her still coursed through him, seeking topull him back toward darkness and death. Somewhere in the back of his mind, hefought it with his love of life, and with his joy that Cara was alive.“I am a wizard,” he whispered back.She stared up into his eyes as she slowly shook her head in wonder.“There has never been a Lord Rahl like you before. I swear, there never has.”With her arms around his neck, she pulled his head closer and kissed him on thecheek. “Thank you, Lord Rahl, for bringing me back. Thank you for saving me. Youmade me see again that I want to live. It is I who is supposed to be protectingyour life, and you are the one to risk yours to save me.”She again searched his eyes with leisurely satisfaction. It was completelyunlike the way a Mord-Sith had of gazing through a person, of seeing all the wayinto their soul. This was an emotion of regard born of her appreciation for hisvalue to her. In the purest sense, it was love. She showed absolutely noreticence in him seeing her feelings laid bare.He supposed that, after what they had just shared, any such modesty would bepointless. He knew, though, that this was more, that this was Cara; sincere,unafraid, and unashamed.“There has never been a Lord Rahl like you.”“Cara, you don’t know how glad I am to have you back with me.”She held his head in both her hands and kissed his forehead. “Oh, but I do know.I know what you suffered for me this night. I know very well how much you wantedme back. I know very well what you did for me.” She slipped her arms around hisneck again and hugged him tight. “I have never been afraid like that, not evenwhen I was first—”He touched his fingers to her lips to silence what she had been about to say forfear that it would break the spell, that it would too soon bring the armor ofMord-Sith back into her beautiful blue eyes. He knew what she had been about tosay. He knew that madness.“Thank you, Lord Rahl,” she whispered in wonder when he took his lingers away.“Thank you for everything, and for not letting me say what I had been about tosay.” With a twitch of her brow, pain ghosted across her face. “That is whythere has never been a Lord Rahl like you before. They all created Mord-Sith.They all brought the pain. You ended it.”Richard couldn’t force any words past the lump in his throat, so he simplybrushed her blond hair from her forehead and smiled at her. He was so happy tohave her back that he couldn’t put it into words.He gazed around the room, then, trying to judge how late it was.“I don’t know how long it took you to heal me,” she said as she watched himsurveying the curtains for any sign of the approach of dawn. “But after you did,you were so exhausted that you seemed to collapse into sleep. I couldn’t wakeyou… I didn’t want to wake you.” Her arms still loosely around his neck, shegazed up at him with a blissful smile, looking as if she never wanted to move.“I was so weak that I fell asleep as well.”“Cara, we have to get out of here.”“What do you mean?”Richard pushed himself up, the urgency of the situation becoming all too clear.His head spun sickeningly. “I used magic to heal you.”She nodded, looking uncharacteristically content at the mention of magic and herin the same breath. This had been magic that had shown her the wonder of life.What he was getting at abruptly became clear to her. She sat up in a rush, buthad to put a hand back to steady herself.Richard stood on trembling legs. He realized then that he was still wearing hissword. He was glad to have it at hand. “If Jagang’s beast is around, then itmight have sensed that I used my gift. I don’t know where it might be, but I’dnot like to be lying here when it returns.”“Nor would I. Once was enough for a lifetime.”He held out an arm and helped her stand. She balanced in a stiff posture for amoment before gathering her senses and loosening her pose. It somehow seemedstartling to him to see that she was dressed in her red leather. After havingbeen so close to her, after having been within her, in a sense, clothes seemedsomehow alien.In some inexplicable manner, Cara drew the aura of Mord-Sith around herself.She smiled. The composed confidence in that smile lifting his heart. “I’m allright,” she said as if to tell him to stop worrying. “I’m back with you.”The steel was back in her eyes. Cara was indeed back.Richard nodded. “Me too. I’m feeling better now that I’m waking up.” He gesturedto her pack. “Let’s get our things and get moving.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20Nicci stood at the edge of the hill, hands clasped, gazing across the grounds atthe white marble statue lit by torches. The people of Altur’Rang had thoughtthat such a noble figure, a symbol of liberty for them, should never go dark andso it was always lit.Nicci had slowly paced the gloomy hall in the inn for much of the night,dispirited about the life slipping away on the other side of the door. She hadtried everything she knew to save Cara, but it had been hopeless.Nicci didn’t know Cara all that well, but she certainly knew Richard. Sheprobably knew him better than anyone alive, except, perhaps, his grandfatherZedd. She didn’t know his past so well, the stories about his childhood or thatsort of thing; she knew Richard the man. She knew him down to the core of hissoul. There was no one alive she knew better.She understood the depth of his grief at losing Cara. Throughout the vigil,Nicci’s gift, unbidden, had brought her the sounds of some of that open misery.It broke Nicci’s heart to have Richard suffer such a loss. She would have doneanything to have spared him that.At one point she had thought to go in and comfort Richard’s grief, to ease someof it by sparing him at least a bit of the loneliness of it. The door would notopen.While it was puzzling, what she could sense told her that there were only twopeople inside and what she could hear told her that there was nothing more thansimple sorrow on the other side, so she hadn’t tried to force open the stuckdoor. Unable to bear the pain of listening to Richard’s supplications to Cara asshe lay dying, Nicci had eventually gone outside, finally ending up staring outacross the black chasm of night to the statue he had created.Other than being with Richard himself, there were few things Nicci would ratherdo than gaze at the majestic things he had created.Sometimes the death of someone close had a way of making people see the world ina new light, a way of making them come back to those things that were mostimportant in life. She wondered what Richard would once Cara passed away, if itwould jolt him back to reality and he would finally abandon the search forphantoms and stand with the people who? wanted to be free of the Imperial Order.Hearing footsteps, and then her name called, Nicci turned.It was Richard, with someone else, approaching through the shadows. Nicci’sheart sank. That could only mean that Cara’s ordeal had finally ended.As Richard came close, Nicci saw who was with him.“Dear spirits, Richard,” she whispered, her eyes going wide, “what have youdone?”In the dim light of the distant torches Cara looked perfectly alive and well.“Lord Rahl healed me,” she said, offhandedly, as if such an accomplishment hadbeen a minor task of no more note than if he had helped her to fetch water.Nicci stared in shock. “How?” was all she could say.Richard looked as weary as if he had been through a battle. She half expected tosee him covered in blood.“I couldn’t stand the thought of not doing something to try to help her,” hesaid. “I suppose that the need was strong enough so that I was able to somehowdo what I needed to do in order to heal her.”The meaning of why that door wouldn’t open suddenly became all too clear. He hadindeed been through a battle, and he was, in a sense, covered in blood, just notthe kind one could see.Nicci leaned toward him. “You used your gift.” It was a charge, not a question.Nonetheless he answered it.“I guess so.”“You guess so.” Nicci wished she could make herself not sound like she wasmocking him. “I tried everything I knew. Nothing I did was able to reach her. Icouldn’t heal her. What did you do? And how did you manage to touch your Han?”Richard shrugged self-consciously. “I’m not exactly sure of it all. I held herand I could feel that she was dying. I could feel her slipping farther andfarther away. I kind of let myself—my mind—sink down into her, down into thecore of who she is, down to where she needed the help. Once I reached that placeof union with her, I collected her pain into myself so that she would haveenough strength to take the warmth of life I offered her.”Nicci understood very well the elaborate phenomenon he was describing, but shewas astounded to hear it explained in such incidental terms. It was as if shehad asked him how he carved such a lifelike statue in marble and he had said ofhis masterwork that he just cut off all the stone that didn’t belong. Whileaccurate, such an explanation was casual to the point of absurdity.“You took upon yourself what was killing her?”“I had to.”Nicci pressed her fingertips to her temples. Even she, with all the powers shehad at her disposal, and she had considerable power, to say nothing of hertraining, experience, and knowledge, could not undertake such a deed. She had tomake an effort to slow her hammering heart.“Do you have any idea at all of the danger involved in such an endeavor?”Richard looked a little ill at ease by the heated tone of her questions. “It wasthe only way, Nicci,” he said in simple summary.“It was the only way,” she repeated in astonishment. She could not believe whatshe was hearing. “Do you have any idea how much power it takes to embark on sucha voyage of the soul, much less to ever come back from such a place? Or theperil in going there?”He stuck his hands in his pockets as if he were a child being upbraided formisbehaving. “All I know is that it was the only way to get Cara back.”“And he did,” Cara said, pointing a finger at Nicci not only for emphasis but tostress her defense of him. “Lord Rahl came for me.”Nicci stared at the Mord-Sith. “Richard went to the brink of the world of thedead for you… and perhaps beyond.”Cara stole a glance at Richard. “He did?”Nicci slowly nodded. “Your spirit had already slipped into a twilight realm. Youwere beyond my reach. That was why I could not heal you.”“Well, Lord Rahl did it.”“Yes, he did.” Nicci reached out and with a finger lifted Cara’s chin. “I hopethat as long as you live you never forget what this man has just done for you. Idoubt there is anyone living who could have—who would have—attempted such athing.”“He had to.” Cara gave Nicci a brazen smile. “Lord Rahl can’t get along withoutme and he knows it.”Richard turned aside as he smiled to himself.Nicci could hardly believe such a casual attitude after such a monumental event.She took a breath in an attempt to control her voice and not give the wrongimpression, an impression that she was displeased that he had healed Cara.“You used your gift, Richard. The beast is already about and you used yourgift.”“I had to or we would have lost her.”To Richard, it all seemed so simple and straightforward. At least he had thesense not to look as self-satisfied as Cara. Nicci planted her fists on her hipsas she leaned closer to him.“Don’t you comprehend what you’ve done? You used your gift again. I warned youbefore that you must not do so. The beast is already somewhere close and byusing your gift you just told it right where you are.”“What did you expect me to do, let Cara die?”“Yes! She is sworn to protect you with her life. That is her job—her sworn duty.Not helping you to bring the beast closer to you. We could easily have lost youin such an attempt, to say nothing of the profound menace you have justawakened. You risked all you mean to the people of D’Hara and your value to ourcause just to save one person. You should have let her go. In saving her youhave only allowed her to bring death to both of you because the beast will nowbe able to find you. What just happened will now happen again, only this timethere will be no escape. You have just saved Cara’s life at the price of yourown, and no doubt hers in the bargain.”Even as she spoke Nicci knew by the smoldering anger in his eyes that she wasnot doing a good job of making him see what she meant. Cara’s eyes, on the otherhand, revealed sudden alarm verging on panic. Richard placed a hand on the backof her neck and gave it a reassuring squeeze, as if to tell her to ignore such asupposition.“That’s not certain, Nicci.” The muscles in his jaw flexed as he gritted histeeth. “It may be a possibility, but it’s not certain—and besides, I wasn’tgoing to let someone I care about die just because it might make me a littlesafer. I’m already hunted. Letting Cara die wouldn’t have changed that.”Nicci let her hands flop down against her thighs. He was in no mood to hearanyone speak against saving the life of a woman he cared deeply for.Nicci had no idea how she could explain it to him in a way that could make himunderstand the magnitude of the forces he had invoked or the grave danger he hadunleashed. How could she say anything and not have him misunderstand hermeaning? In the end, she knew she couldn’t.Nicci placed a hand on his shoulder. “I guess I can’t blame you, Richard. Iguess that in your place, I would have done the same. Someday, when we have theluxury of time we will have to talk about this. When we are able, I would likeyou to tell me everything you did. Maybe I can help you learn to better controlwhat you alone were able to harness. If nothing else maybe I can at least makethings you do spontaneously a little more focused and a little less dangerous.”Richard nodded his appreciation, whether of her offer or her softer tone shewasn’t sure.Nicci could see in Richard and Cara’s eyes that the experience had brought thetwo of them closer. When she realized that he would soon be leaving, Nicci’sbrief bout of joy at seeing Cara alive and well faded.“Besides,” Richard said as he scanned the darkness, “we don’t even know if thishad anything to do with the thing back in the woods.”“Well of course it did,” Nicci said.His gaze returned to her. “How do you know? That thing tore all those men apart.This was a different kind of attack. For that matter, we don’t even know forcertain that either attack was the beast that Jagang ordered to be created.”“What are you talking about? What else could it be? It has to be the weapon thatJagang directed the Sisters to conjure.”“I’m not saying that it isn’t—it very well could be—but a lot of it doesn’t makeany sense to me.”“Like what?”Richard raked his fingers back through his hair. “The thing in the forestattacked the men—it didn’t attack me even though I wasn’t far away. Here, itdidn’t bother to tear Cara apart like it did the men. If it was the same thing,then we know it could have easily killed me. So when it was right here and hadthe chance, why didn’t it use the opportunity?”“Maybe because I tried to capture its power,” Cara offered. “Maybe it justpassed me by because I was a threat or maybe I distracted it enough that itdecided to flee.”Richard shook his head. “You were no threat. It went right through you, andbesides, its touch was enough to eliminate your interference. Then, it camethrough the wall for me, but as it reached my room it didn’t flee, it simplydisappeared.”Nicci abruptly turned suspicious. She never had heard the whole story.“You were in the room and it just vanished?”“Not exactly. I jumped out the window to escape it as it came through the wallinto my room. As I hung there some kind of dark thing, like a moving shadow,came out the window and as it did it seemed to evaporate into the night.”Nicci idly drew the end of the cord of her bodice through her fingers as sheconsidered what he’d said. She tried to fit the pieces into everything else sheknew, but none of it would match. Nothing that the beast did seemed to makesense—if it really was the same beast. Richard was right in that it all seemedto defy logic.“Maybe it didn’t see you,” she murmured half to herself as she considered thepuzzle.Richard flashed her a skeptical expression. “So you’re saying that it could findme, at night, inside the inn, and it then crashed right through a succession ofwalls as it was coming for me, but then when I just barely managed to jumpthrough the only window, it became confused and so it wandered off?”Nicci appraised his eyes a moment. “Both attacks have something important incommon. They both displayed incredible power—shattering trees like they weretwigs and going through walls as if they were no more than paper.”Richard sighed unhappily. “I suppose that’s true.”“What I’d like to know,” Nicci added as she folded her arms, “is why it didn’tkill Cara.”She caught the slight flicker in his eyes and she knew then that he knewsomething more than he had said. Nicci cocked her head as she watched him whileshe waited.“When I was there in Cara’s mind, taking up the pain of the touch of that vilething, there was something more that it left behind,” he admitted in a quietvoice. “I think it wanted to leave a message for me to find, a message that it’scoming for me, that it will find me, and that for all eternity it will make mydeath a luxury beyond reach.”Nicci’s gaze slid to Cara.“I didn’t choose for him to come after me to that twilight place, as you calledit. I didn’t ask him to and I didn’t want him to.” The Mord-Sith’s hands fistedat her sides. “But I can’t lie and say that I’d rather be dead.”Nicci couldn’t help but to smile at such simple honesty.“Cara, I’m joyful that you’re not dead—I truly am. What kind of man would we befollowing if he easily let a friend die without trying his best to save her?”Cara’s expression cooled as Nicci looked again at Richard.“I’m still perplexed as to why it didn’t kill Cara. After all, a message likethat could have just as easily been given directly to you once it had you in itsclutches. If the threat is credible—and I certainly don’t doubt that it is—thenthe beast would have all the time it wished to make you suffer if it would havesnatched you right then. Such a message serves no real purpose. What’s more, itmakes no sense for the beast to be right there and then vanish.”Richard drummed his fingers on the cross guard of his sword as he thought itover. “All good questions, Nicci, but I just don’t have good answers.”With the palm of his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword, he scanned thedarkness again, checking for any threat. “I think Cara and I had better be onour way. Considering what happened to Victor’s men, I’m concerned about whatwill happen if that thing comes back here after me. I’d not like that kind ofbeast rampaging through the city in a blood frenzy. I don’t want any more peopleto be needlessly hurt or killed. Whatever that thing is—the beast Jagang had hisSisters conjure, or something we don’t even know about—it seems to me that I’llhave a better chance to stay alive if I keep moving. Sitting in one place feelstoo much like waiting for the executioner to arrive.”“I don’t think that you are necessarily making logical assumptions,” Nicci said.“Nonetheless I need to be going anyway and I’d feel better if it was soonerrather than later—for a variety of reasons.” He hoisted his pack higher on hisback. “I have to find Victor and Ishaq.”Resigned, Nicci gestured behind her. “After the attack I went and got them. Theyare both over at the stables, back there. Ishaq has the horses you requested.Some of the men helped him gather supplies for you.” She put a hand on his arm.“Some of the relatives of Victor’s men, the ones who were killed, are there,too. They want to hear from you.”Richard nodded as he let out a deep breath. “I hope I can offer them somecomfort. Grief is fresh in my mind.” He gave Cara a quick squeeze on hershoulder. “But mine has been lifted.”Richard hitched his bow higher up onto his shoulder as he started away. Inlittle more than a blink he dissolved into the darkness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21As Cara went past, following in Richard’s wake, Nicci caught the Mord-Sith’sarm, holding her back until she could speak without Richard hearing.“How are you, Cara? Really?”Cara met Nicci’s direct gaze with a steady look of her own. “I’m tired, but I’mfine, now. Lord Rahl made it right.”Nicci nodded her satisfaction. “Cara, may I ask you a personal question?”“As long as I don’t have to promise I’ll answer it.”“Do you have a man for whom you care greatly named Benjamin Meiffert?”Even in the dim light, Nicci could see Cara’s face go as scarlet as her redleather outfit. “Who told you such a thing?”“Do you mean to say, then, that it’s a secret and no one knows?”“Well, that’s not what I’m saying, exactly,” Cara stammered. “I mean… you’retrying to trip me into saying something I don’t intend.”“I’m not trying to trip you into saying anything, especially something thatisn’t true. I only asked about Benjamin Meiffert.”Cara’s brow drew tight. “Who told you such a thing?”“Richard.” Nicci arched an eyebrow. “Is it true?”Cara pressed her lips tight. At last she looked away from Nicci to glare offinto the night. “Yes.”“So you told Richard all about how you care a great deal for this soldier?”“Are you crazy? I would never have told such a thing to Lord Rahl. Where couldhe have heard it?”For a moment, Nicci listened to the cicadas singing their incessant mating songsas she considered the Mord-Sith.“Richard said that Kahlan told him all about it.”Cara stood with her mouth agape. She at last touched her fingers to her foreheadas she worked to gather her senses.“Well that’s just crazy… I, I must have told him myself. I guess I just forgot.We talk about so much. It’s hard to recall everything I told him—but now thatyou bring it up, I think I do recall mentioning it one night when we were bothtalking about such sentimental things. I think that must have been when I toldhim about Benjamin Meiffert. I guess I pushed such a personal discussions to theback of my mind. I guess he didn’t. I ought to learn to keep my mouth shut.”“You have no need to fear anything you tell Richard. You have no better friendin the world. And you have no need to fear me knowing such things, either. Hetold me about it in the depth of his grief for you because he wanted me to knowthat you are more than just Mord-Sith, that you’re a person with a life anddesires of your own and you had come to value a good man. He was honoring you bytelling me. But I will keep it to myself. Your feelings are safe with me, Cara.”Cara idly tugged at strands of hair at the end of her single braid. “I guess Inever looked at it quite that way—I mean about him honoring me by telling you.That’s kind of… nice.”“Love is a passion for life shared with another person. You fall in love with aperson who you think is wonderful. It’s your deepest appreciation of the valueof that individual, and that individual is a reflection of what you value mostin life. Love, for sound reasons, can be one of life’s greatest rewards. Youshouldn’t be ashamed or embarrassed about being in love. I mean, if you reallydo love Benjamin, that is.”Cara thought it over a moment. “I’m not ashamed of it; I am Mord-Sith.” Some ofthe tension went out of her shoulders. “But I don’t know if I’m in love withhim, either. I don’t know for certain what I think about it. I know I caregreatly for him. I’m not sure it’s love, though. Maybe it’s only the first stepalong the path to love. It’s kind of hard for me to tell about such things. I’mnot used to it mattering what I think or how I feel.”Nicci nodded as she began walking slowly through the shadows. “For a lot of mylife I didn’t understand what love was either. Jagang used to sometimes thinkthat he was in love with me.”“Jagang? Seriously? He’s in love with you?”“No, he’s not really in love with me; he just thinks he is. Even back then Iknew that it wasn’t love, even if I didn’t understand why. Jagang’s measure ofworth runs from hate to lust. He scorns and defiles anything that’s good aboutlife, so he couldn’t possibly experience true love. He can only discern it asthe faint fragrance of something tantalizing and mysterious beyond his reach andhe longs to possess it.“He imagined that he could experience love by grabbing me by my hair and forcingme down on him. He interpreted his enjoyment as he watched as feelings of love.He thought that I should be grateful that he had such powerful feelings for methat he would be overcome with desire for me to the exclusion of everythingelse. Since he believed that forcing himself on me was an expression of hislove, he thought I should accept it as an honor.”“He would have liked Darken Rahl,” Cara muttered. “They would have gotten alongsplendidly.” She looked over, suddenly puzzled. “You’re a sorceress. Why didn’tyou use your power to incinerate the bastard?”Nicci let out a deep breath. How could she simply explain a lifetime ofindoctrination?“I don’t think that a day goes by that I don’t wish I would have killed thatvile man. But, brought up as I was under the teachings of the Fellowship ofOrder, the same as he, I believed that moral virtue was only realized throughself-sacrifice. Under their tenets, your duty is to those in need. Such dictatesare imposed under the banner of the common good, or the betterment of mankind,or dutiful obedience to the Creator.“By the ideology of the Order we were to devote ourselves not to those weregarded as the best among mankind, but to those who we ourselves regarded asthe worst among men—not because they had earned it, but precisely because theyhadn’t. This, the Order claims, is the heart of morality and the only means bywhich we earn our entry into the everlasting light of the Creator in theafterlife. It’s the sacrifice of the virtuous into servitude to the vile. It isnever done under the banner of what it really is: naked greed for the unearned.“Jagang’s worldly needs revolved around his crotch. I had what he believed heneeded, so I was morally required to sacrifice myself to his need. Especiallysince he is the leader bringing the Order’s moral teachings to the heathens ofthe world.“When Jagang would beat me until I was only half conscious and then throw me onhis bed to have his way with me, I was doing what I had been taught was not onlyright, but my selfless moral duty. I thought I was evil for hating it.“Since I believed that I was evil for such self-interest, I felt that I deservedall the pain I got in this world and eternal punishment in the next. I couldn’tkill a man who was, under the creed taught to me by the Fellowship of Order,morally superior to me by virtue of his need. How could I possibly harm someonewho I had been taught to serve? How could I possibly object to the harm done tome when I so deserved all I got and more? What could I object to? Justice?That’s the endless, miserable trap of teachings about your duty to the greatergood.”They strolled in silence as Nicci endured an array of ghastly memories.“What changed?” Cara finally asked.“Richard,” Nicci said softly. Right then, she was glad for the darkness. Despiteher tears, she lifted her head with pride. “The Imperial Order’s teachings canonly endure through brutality. Richard showed me that no one has a right to mylife, not the whole of it, nor pieces of it. He showed me that my life is mineto live for myself, for my own purpose, and does not belong to others.”Cara watched with a kind of knowing sympathy. “I guess that you had a great dealin common with Mord-Sith under the rule of Darken Rahl. D’Hara was once a placeof darkness, as life is now under the Imperial Order. Richard didn’t just killDarken Rahl, he ended that kind of sick doctrine for D’Hara. He gave us the samething he gave you; he gave us back our lives.“I guess Lord Rahl could understand us because he was treated much the same.”Nicci wasn’t sure what Cara meant. “The same?”“He was once a captive of a Mord-Sith named Denna. At the time it was our dutyto torture Darken Rahl’s enemies to death. Denna was the best of the best.Darken Rahl had personally selected her to capture Richard and be in charge ofhis training. Darken Rahl had been hunting Richard for quite a while because heknew something important about the boxes of Orden. Darken Rahl wanted thatinformation. It was Denna’s job to torture Richard into being eager to answerany question Darken Rahl asked.”Nicci glanced over and saw tears glistening in Cara’s eyes as she slowed to ahalt. She lifted her Agiel, staring at it as she rolled it in her fingers. Nicciknew all about Denna and what she had done to Richard, but she decided thatright then it might be best to remain silent and simply listen. Sometimes peopleneeded to say things for themselves more than they needed to say them forothers. Nicci thought that perhaps after coming so close to dying, this was oneof those times for Cara.“I was there,” Cara said in a near whisper as she stared at her Agiel. “Hedoesn’t remember because Denna had tortured him until he was delirious and onlypartially conscious, but I saw him there, at the People’s Palace, and I saw someof what she did to him… of what we all did.”Nicci’s breath paused. She cautiously glanced over at Cara. “Of what you alldid? What do you mean?”“It was standard practice for Mord-Sith to pass their captives around. It madeit more difficult for them to learn to endure any particular pattern of torturefrom one individual. It helped to keep them confused and afraid. Fear is anintegral part of torture. That’s something a Mord-Sith learns from the firstmoment she is taken to be trained to become Mord-Sith—that fear and the unknownmakes any pain infinitely worse. Most of the time Denna let a Mord-Sith namedConstance share in training Richard. But sometimes Denna wanted to use others,besides Constance.”Cara stood stock-still as she stared at her Agiel. “It was not long after hearrived at the People’s Palace. Richard doesn’t remember—I don’t think he evenknew his own name at the time because Denna had him in a fog of delirium, in astate of madness from the things she had done to him… but he spent a day withme.”This, Nicci hadn’t known. She stood frozen, afraid to say anything. She had noidea what she could say.“Denna took Richard as her mate,” Cara said. “I don’t think she understood loveany better than Jagang or Darken Rahl. At the end, though, she came to have adeep and genuine love for Richard. I saw the change coming over her. As youdescribed it, she came to value him as an individual. She came to have sincerepassion for him. She loved him so much that in the end she let him kill her sothat he could escape.“But before then, when Denna was still torturing him, I saw him there more thanonce, hanging helpless, covered in blood and begging for the release of death.”A tear ran down Cara’s cheek. “Dear spirits, I too made him beg for death as Istood over him.”Cara seemed to suddenly realize what she had just said aloud. Panic flooded hereyes. “Please don’t say anything to him. It was so long ago—it’s over andeverything has changed, now. I don’t want him to know… about me there with himlike that.” Tears ran down her face. “Please…”Nicci took up one of Cara’s hands in both of hers. “Of course I wouldn’t sayanything about it. I, of all people, understand the way you feel; I too, oncedid terrible things to him, only for a great deal longer than anyone else. Asyou say, that’s over.” Nicci let out a deep sigh. “I guess we all three know alittle about what love is, and what it isn’t.”Cara nodded not just her relief, but her sincere appreciation that Nicciunderstood. “We’d better catch up with Lord Rahl.”Nicci gestured casually toward the stables. “Richard is talking to the relativesof Victor’s men who were killed.” She tapped the side of her forehead. “I canjust barely hear him with my gift.” She reached out and gently wiped a tear fromCara’s cheek. “We have the time to gather our senses before we get there.”As they started slowly walking toward the stable, Cara said, “Nicci, could Itell you something, then… something personal?”On a night of such surprises, this was yet another. “Of course.”“Well…” Cara began as she frowned, trying to find the words, “when Lord Rahlcame to me—to heal me—he was close to me.”“What do you mean?”“I mean he was lying there with me, in the bed with me, with his arms aroundme—you know, protecting me and keeping me warm.” She rubbed her arms as if thememory had brought the chill back. “I was so cold.” Cara stole a quick glanceover at Nicci. “I guess that, well, I guess that in my condition, and all, I waskind of holding on to him, too.”Nicci lifted an eyebrow. “I see.”“And the thing is, I felt things when he came into me—and if you tell him thisI’ll kill you, I swear I will.”Nicci smiled as she nodded her assurance. “We both care a great deal about him.I assume that what you’re telling me is only because you are concerned for him.”“That’s right.” She rubbed her arms again as she went on. “When he came to… topull me back, or whatever it is he did, it was like he was inside me, inside myhead, I mean. It was a kind of intimacy unlike any other.“Lord Rahl healed me once before when I was seriously hurt, but this wasdifferent. Parts were the same, some of the feelings were the same, the sincerecaring and such that I felt from him, but this was different, somehow—reallydifferent. That time he was healing my physical injury.” Cara leaned closer inan effort to try to get her point across. “This time it was more; this time thetouch of that evil thing was inside me, like it was poisoning me, poisoning myexistence, my will to live.”She straightened, then, seemingly frustrated and unable to think of how toexplain it better.“I know the difference you’re trying to define,” Nicci offered. “This time itwas a more personal connection between the two of you.”Cara nodded as if relieved that Nicci seemed to understand.“Yes, that’s right, it was more personal. A lot more personal,” she added underher breath. “It was like my soul was laid bare to him. It was kind of like…well, never mind.”Cara went silent. Nicci wondered if the woman had said all she had really wantedto say and would decide to stop there, but then she went on.“The point is that he felt so much of me, of my inner thoughts and all. No onehas ever…”Cara again went silent, but this time in apparent frustration at trying to findthe words to explain what she meant.“I understand, Cara,” Nicci assured her. “I really do. I’ve healed people so Iknow the sensations you experienced, if not as deeply. I’ve never been able tosucceed to the extent that Richard did with you, but I’ve experienced more orless the same kinds of conditions when I heal people, especially when I healedRichard.”“That’s good to hear—that you know what I’m talking about.” Cara casually kickeda rock as she walked along. “Well, I don’t think Lord Rahl is aware of it, butwhen we were together like that he didn’t just… experience me, experience myinner feelings and thoughts, so to speak; I experienced him as well.” Shegrowled to herself. “I shouldn’t be saying this.” She waved a hand. “Forget Isaid anything.”Nicci wasn’t sure what the woman was getting at. “Cara, if you aren’tcomfortable telling me, then don’t. You know how much I care for Richard, butstill, if you don’t think you shouldn’t say anything, or that you are steppingout of bounds in your relationship with him, then perhaps you should trust thatinstinct.”Cara sighed. “Maybe you’re right.”Nicci couldn’t ever recall Cara appearing so flustered. If there was one thingenduring about the woman it was her resolute confidence. She was always decisiveabout precisely what she should do in any given circumstance. Nicci didn’talways think that Cara was right, and she knew that Richard didn’t either, butthey could always count on Cara being determined to do the best thing forRichard no matter how it might endanger Cara herself—or anger them. If she felther actions were necessary to protect him, she simply went ahead, dismissing theconsequences to herself, including his disapproval.As they walked in silence through the dark alleyway, Nicci, with the help of hergift, could hear people in the distance speaking in low voices. She didn’t tryto pick out the words; she did no more than note the general nature of theconversation. It was men and women gathered at the stables, some speaking inturn. Nicci could distinguish Richard speaking gently to them, answeringquestions. She could hear people weeping.At the corner of the inn where the road to the right lead down a few doors tothe stables, Cara abruptly caught Nicci’s arm and brought her to a halt whilethey were still in the deep shadows.“Look, you and I, well, we both started out in all this determined to kill LordRahl.”Somewhat taken aback, Nicci didn’t think that this was the time to split hairs.“I guess you’re right.”“Maybe more than anyone else, you and I have a unique perspective on Lord Rahl.I think that when you start out wanting to do someone harm and they make you seehow wrong you’ve been and how your own life means more than that, well, it kindof makes you care all that much more for them.”“I think I would have to agree with you.”Cara gestured back the way they had come, toward the grounds of the palace thatwas now Liberty Square. “Back there, when the revolt started, when Lord Rahl waswounded and near death, people didn’t want to let you try to heal him. They wereafraid that you would instead do him harm. I’m the one who told them to trustyou. I understood the awakening you had gone through because I had gone throughmuch the same thing. I was the only one who knew what you had come to feel abouthim. I told them to let you do it. They feared you might use the opportunity totake his life. I knew you wouldn’t. I knew you would save him.”“You’re right, Cara. We both care deeply for him. We both have a special bondwith him.”“Yes, that’s it. A special bond. Different, I think, than other people.”Mystified by what Cara could be getting at, Nicci spread her hands. “So you wishto tell me something?”Cara looked down at her boots as she nodded. “When Lord Rahl and I shared thattogetherness, I felt some of his inner emotions. Inside him he has a terrible,burning loneliness. I think that maybe all the business about this woman—thisKahlan—is because of his lonesomeness.”Nicci took a deep breath and let it out slowly as she wondered at the precisenature of what Cara had sensed in him. “I suppose that may be a part of it.”Cara cleared her throat. “Nicci, when you hold a man in your arms like that, andyou have been… well, together in such a personal way, you come to truly feelwhat’s inside him.”Nicci pushed her feelings farther back into the shadows. “I don’t doubt thatyou’re right, Cara.”“I mean, I just wanted to hold him forever, to comfort him, to keep him fromfeeling so alone.”Nicci stole a sidelong glance at the Mord-Sith. She was twisting her mouth asshe studiously watched the ground. Nicci didn’t say anything, waiting insteadfor Cara to go on.“But I just don’t think I’m the one to do such a thing for Lord Rahl.”Nicci cautiously framed her question. “You mean, you don’t think that you’re thewoman who can satisfy… his loneliness?”“I guess not.”“Benjamin?”The woman shrugged. “That’s part of it.” She looked up and met Nicci’s gaze. “Ilove Lord Rahl. I’d give my life for him. And I have to admit that lying thereand having him in my arms like that made me feel… feel like maybe I could bemore than just his bodyguard and friend. As I lay there in that bed, holding himclose to me, I imagined what it would be like to be his…” Her voice trailed off.Nicci swallowed. “I see.”“But I just don’t think that I’m the one. I don’t know why. I’m not exactly anexpert in matters of the heart, but I don’t feel like I’m the one he needs. Ijust don’t think I could be. If he were to ask it of me, I would do it in aheartbeat… but not because I wanted it, exactly. Do you understand what I mean?”“You mean you would do it out of your deep respect and caring for him, not outof your personal wish to be his lover.”“That’s it,” Cara said with a sigh of relief, apparently at having someone elsesay it aloud. “Besides, I just don’t think that Lord Rahl feels that way aboutme. When I was sensing his feelings, when we were in each other’s arms, I thinkI would have known if he felt that way about me, but he doesn’t. He loves me, Iknow that much, but not in that way.”Nicci carefully eased out her own breath. “So… that’s what you wanted me toknow? That you think his loneliness is the source of his fantasy woman?”Cara nodded. “Yes… but one more thing, too.”Nicci glanced down the street, watching men making their way to the stable. “Andwhat would that be?”“I think that maybe you could be the one.”Nicci’s heart came up in her throat as she turned to see Cara staring right ather. “What?”“I think you could be the one for Lord Rahl.” She held up her hands to forestallany argument. “Don’t say anything. I don’t want you to be saying that I’m crazy.Don’t say anything for now. Just think about it. We’ll be leaving shortly and itwill be a while until you can come to meet up with us, so you have time and youcould think about it. I’m not asking you to sacrifice yourself for him oranything foolish like that.“I’m just saying that I think Lord Rahl needs someone and you could be thatwoman—I mean if you felt right about it.“I’m not the one he needs. I’m Mord-Sith, and Lord Rahl is a wizard. Dearspirits, I hate magic and he is magic. We just aren’t right for each other inall kinds of little ways. But you have so much in common with him. You’re asorceress. Who could understand him better than you? Who could help him withevery aspect of his life better than you?“I remember back that night at camp, in the shelter, when the two of you weretalking about the creative dimension of magic. I didn’t understand half of it,but it struck me then how the two of you could talk so easily to each other andunderstand each other’s thoughts, ideas, and meaning like no one else could. Iremember being taken by how the two of you, well, seemed so right together.“And I remember thinking, too, when we lay down close to him to keep warm, howgood you looked close to him like that. Like a woman would be close to a man shecared about. I remember, for some reason, half expecting him to kiss you. Itwould have seemed natural.”Nicci couldn’t make her heart slow down. “Cara, I…” Words failed her.Cara picked at a strip of pealing paint on the corner board of the building.“Besides, you’re about the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. Lord Rahl shouldhave a wife who is his match and I can’t think of a better match than you.”“Wife… ?”“Don’t you see how much sense it makes? It would fill the emptiness I feltinside him. It would bring him joy and happiness to replace his misery. He wouldhave someone to share his gift and his connection to magic. He wouldn’t belonely. Just think about it.”“But, Cara, Richard doesn’t love me.”Cara appraised her for a long, uncomfortable moment. Nicci recalled then Richardonce telling her how paralyzing it felt to be under the scrutiny of a Mord-Sithwhen she looked into your eyes, really looked into them. Nicci now understoodwhat he meant.“Maybe he doesn’t feel that way now, but maybe when you come back to join us youcould do a little more to let him know you were open to such a notion about thetwo of you—I mean, if you wanted to, if you were open to the idea. Sometimespeople just have to be made aware of something so that they will consider itseriously. That’s why I felt I needed to say something to you. Maybe if hethought you might be open to such a thing then he’d get interested and startlooking at you in that light.“You know, people who are in love had to fall in love at some point. Theyweren’t born in love with their mate. Maybe you just have to help him get tothat point where he will start to think about you in that light. It could evenbe he thinks that a beautiful, intelligent woman like you could never care forhim seriously. Sometimes men are shy that way about a woman they think isextraordinarily beautiful.”“Cara, I just don’t think he—”Cara leaned in confidentially. “It could even be that he thinks you would neverbe interested in him and so he dreamed up this other woman to fill the void.”Nicci wet her lips. “I think we had better get over to the stable or he mayleave without you. He seems pretty set on leaving.”Cara offered a smile. “You’re right. Look, Nicci, if you’d rather, you couldjust forget I said anything. I can see that I’m making you uncomfortable. Idon’t exactly feel right about saying anything, anyway.”“Then why did you?”Cara gazed off wistfully. “I guess because as I was holding him, and I felt thedepth of his loneliness, it just broke my heart.” Her gaze drifted back toNicci’s. “And Mord-Sith don’t get broken hearts all that often.”Nicci almost said that neither did sorceresses."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22Lanterns hanging from stout posts lent a cozy glow to the stable. The dustysmell of fresh straw hung thick in the wide passageway running in front of thestalls and pens. Men and women, some with their children along, had filled thewalkway and in a few places spilled over into the empty pens, but now, afterRichard had talked to the relatives of the men who had been killed, many had bidhim a safe journey and started for their homes.Dawn was still a couple of hours off. Despite the hour, there had been a numberof people other than grieving relatives who had come to ask questions about theimpending battle for their city. More people, sitting on hay bales, had watchedfrom the loft but now many had started down the ladders. Richard supposed thatthey would be going back to bed to catch a little more sleep. He knew that theirsleep would be troubled by worries about the soldiers marching toward theircity.Victor, standing nearby, looked grim after speaking about the bravery of his menand how much he would miss each of them.Many people wept openly as they’d listened. Richard had known that nothing hecould have said would have lifted their grief. He had done his best to make themunderstand what good men he thought they had been, and how much he cared forthem. In the end, all he could really do was sympathize with their loss. He hadfelt helpless and useless, even though they had seemed to appreciate the thingshe’d said.From the corner of his eye, Richard caught sight of Nicci and Cara as they camein the big doorway at the end of the stable. They had to ease their way amongpeople who were leaving. He had been wondering where the two of them had goneto, but, surrounded by people all wanting to speak with him, he hadn’t had achance to go check. He’d figured that either they had wanted to let him have thetime to talk to people, or else Cara had wanted to look around outside to makesure that all was well. Either way, he was glad to see their faces.“So that’s what you think, then, that this thing, this beast, that crashedthrough the walls of Ishaq’s inn was after you?” an older man named Henden askedas he paused beside Richard. He held a pipe with a long curved stem in one hand,his elbow propped on a rail as he spoke.The skin on his thin, leathery face sagged with the weight of years. Because hewas older, and possessed a quiet, prudent manner, many in the crowd had deferredto his earlier questioning of Richard. Henden drew air in through his pipe andreleased aromatic clouds of smoke from the opposite side of his mouth as hewaited for Richard’s answer.“Like I said, the evidence seems to point to it so I think it probably was. Butwhatever it was, it’s likely that it was coming after me, so you can see why Ithink it’s best if I leave now and not risk that thing coming after me again inthe city and maybe causing harm to a lot of people here.”The man removed the pipe from his mouth and gestured toward Richard with thestem. “You mean like those men with Victor were harmed as a result of you beingnear?”Victor stepped forward. “Now look here, Henden, it’s not Lord Rahl’s fault thatevil people are trying to kill him. Those same evil people want to come here andkill us as well—beast or no beast. Would you be to blame if Jagang’s soldierscoming to kill you happened to harm Lord Rahl on their way to get you?“My men were fighting against the Imperial Order when they were cut down bysomething evil. That evil was spawned by the Order. They were fighting for aworld for themselves and their families in which they could live their livesfree and safe. They made the choice to do that rather than live in subjugation.”Henden chewed on the pipe’s stem a moment as his placid eyes considered Victor.“Just asking. Only think it’s reasonable to know what the situation is and whatwe’re up against.”Richard saw heads among the men and women nodding.“You’re right, it is reasonable,” he told the man before Victor could get anyhotter. “I don’t begrudge a man asking questions, especially where lives areconcerned. But Victor is right as well. Jagang is intent on killing us all and,as I’ve told you, the Order needs to be stopped or none of us, no matter wherewe are, will ever be able to rest easy.”Richard saw Nicci slipping effortlessly through the press of people departing.Her flowing blond hair cascaded over the shoulders of a black dress. The dress,cut low with a laced bodice, showed off her shapely form to advantage. But itwas her commanding presence that made her stand out like a queen in the throng.Cara, in her red leather, could have been the royal escort.Richard felt a little uncomfortable at the way they both stared at him as ifthey hadn’t seen him for a month.Henden unexpectedly clapped Richard on the back of his shoulder, bringing himout of his thoughts. The man spoke with the pipe clenched in his teeth.“Safe journey, Lord Rahl. Thank you for everything you’ve done for us. We lookforward to your return to the free city of Altur’Rang.”“Thanks,” Richard said with a smile to the man.Henden moved in with the flow of the others who were engaged in conversation asthey made their way along the aisle and out the door. Richard had been relievedto see that these people understood what their freedom meant, and meant to keepit.Ishaq, standing near Richard, waved his red hat at Nicci and Cara when hespotted them. “There you are,” he called out. “Are you all right, mistress Cara?Richard told me you were safe, but I’m thankful to see it so with my own eyes.”Richard followed Ishaq as he rushed to meet the two women, beaming his pleasureat seeing them both.“We’re fine.” Cara said. “I’m sorry about the damage to your inn.”Ishaq waved a hand, as if the matter were trivial. “It is nothing. Boards andplaster. Nothing at all. People can’t so easily be fixed.”“You’re right about that,” Cara said as she met Richard’s gaze.Richard saw Jamila, standing on the other side of the passageway, scowl atIshaq’s dismissal of the importance of the damage to the inn, but she didn’t sayanything. She held the hand of a little girl as she leaned back against the wallnear the big door, watching. By the girls round face, Richard thought that ithad to be Jamila’s daughter. The girl beamed an infectious smile at him and hecouldn’t help smiling back.“Ishaq, I said that you should deduct the damage from what you owe me, and Imeant it.”Ishaq replaced his hat. “Why you worry so? I told you, I fix.”Before Richard could answer, he heard a commotion just outside. Some of the menwho had been patrolling the neighborhood came in the door dragging two big menwith them. The two men, one with tangled, grimy strands of dark hair and thesecond with his hair cropped short, were both dressed in brown tunics similar tothose worn by many of the people of the city.Victor leaned closer to Richard and spoke under his breath. “Spies.”Richard didn’t doubt it. He could see broad belts underneath the tunics thatwould probably have held weapons. With the Imperial Order soldiers gettingclose, they would have sent scouts ahead to gauge what they were going to be upagainst. Now that they were captives, it was possible that they might beprevailed upon to provide valuable information on the nature of the impendingattack.Despite their attempt to dress the part, the two looked out of place among thepeople of the city. The plain clothes they wore weren’t quite large enough tofit their bulk. Neither was huge, nor were they massively muscular, but they hada well-honed, cool, resourceful demeanor. Both men kept silent, but their eyeswere always on the move, surveying everything around them. They looked asdangerous as wolves among sheep.As the guards pulled the two men into the passageway inside the stable, Richardinstinctively lifted his sword a few inches, making sure that it was clear inits scabbard, before letting it drop back.As one of the guards turned to look at something, the prisoner with the longhair suddenly and savagely kicked the shin of the man holding him from behind.The guard cried out in pain and shock as he crumpled to the ground. The manviolently broke the grip of the men holding his arms by twisting and flingingthem away. Some of the nearby people were toppled to the ground. Guards pouncedon the free man. In the scramble, several crashed to the ground bloodied andanother tumbled back over a rail.In an instant, the subdued mood in the stable changed as the entire placeerupted in panic. Women screamed. Children, when their mothers screamed,shrieked. Older children started wailing. Men yelled. The guards cried outorders. Confusion and fear swept through the crowd.The free enemy spy, a powerful man who knew how to handle adversaries and how tocreate a break for himself in a relatively confined space where they couldn’temploy the numbers necessary to apply overwhelming force, sprang up with a roar.He had Jamila’s little girl by the hair.Somehow, in the scramble, the man had managed to snatch a knife from someone andnow had it pressed to the girl’s throat. The child squealed in terror. Jamiladove for the girl, only to be side-kicked in the head. The powerful blow knockedher aside. Another guard on the ground at the other side also received a wickedkick to his head as he tried to use the opportunity to get close.Richard was already methodically advancing, his attention focused on the threat.“Everyone back!” the man growled at all the people close in all around him.He tossed his head to flip his greasy hair back off his face. His eyes dartedaround at the people trying to back up out of the away. He still panted from theeffort of the brief struggle. Sweat ran down his pockmarked face.“Everyone get back or I’ll slit her throat!”The girl, a meaty fist holding her aloft by the hair, again shrieked in terror.He held her fast against his stomach. Her feet kicked in the air as shestruggled in vain to escape.“Let him go!” the man ordered the guards holding his partner. “Now! Or shedies!”Richard was already lost in a rage unleashed. There would be no compromise, nonegotiations, no quarter given.He stood sideways, in a slight crouch, his right side to the man holding thegirl, preventing him from seeing his sword. The man kept glancing at the guardsto his left who were holding the other man. He wasn’t paying any particularattention to Richard.The burly man holding the wailing girl didn’t know it, but in Richard’s mind thedeed had already been completed. In Richard’s mind the man was already dead.The fury of the magic from Richard’s sword had been freed before his hand evenfound the hilt. When it did, the storm thundered unrestrained up through him,powering his muscles, joining his overwhelming lust to consummate the deadlythought.In an instant, calm had been swept away by a terrible avalanche of need foraction.In that instant, there was nothing Richard wanted more than the man’s blood.Nothing less would stop him. Conviction burned away all uncertainty. The Swordof Truth was a tool of the Seeker’s intent, and that intent was now simple andclear. Now that Richard’s hand was on the hilt of his sword, nothing elseexisted but his purpose, and his singular purpose was to bring death rainingdown on the man before him.His vision tunneled toward his target. His entire life narrowed down to thatsingular lethal commitment.The man with the knife had only to pull it across the tender veil of flesh andthe girl would die. But that would take time, brief time to be sure, but timenonetheless because he would first have to decide to do it. At that moment, theman’s life was tied to the life of the girl; if she died, his shield would loseits value. He would have to weigh that choice and decide on killing her beforehe resolved to it. That decision would take a fleeting glimmer of time.Richard had already made his decision and had fully charged himself to the task.He now had a sliver of time that gave him an opportunity to alter the nature ofthe situation, to be the one to control the outcome. He would not let that smallslip of time escape him.But even that no longer mattered to him.Now, powered by lethal rage, both the sword’s and his own, he wanted the man’sblood. Nothing else would satisfy him, nothing else would stop him, he wouldaccept nothing less.Richard twisted away from the threat, putting the back of his shoulders to theman with the girl, feigning that he was turning away, that he was backing off asthe man had commanded. In so doing, Richard knew that, with so many thingspulling for his attention, the man would discount Richard and direct his concernto the more obvious threat of the men to his sides and back.With his fist tightly gripping the wire wound hilt of his sword, Richard pulleda breath. The world around him seemed to go silent and still.As he reached the apex of his backward twist, he paused.Richard felt his heart begin a beat.With all his power, as people stood frozen, as the man with the knife stood atthe brink of murder, as the girl’s shrill scream drew out into a wire-thin soundfilling the empty void in time, Richard unleashed himself in an explosivemovement.With all his strength he uncoiled. His blade erupted from its sheath fullycharged not only with a wrath of its own but with Richard’s deadly resolve.At the same time as the Sword of Truth rang with the unique sound of itsliberation, Richard released a cry of fury. As he spun, he emptied all his rageinto that roar. With every ounce of effort he had, he drove the blade aroundwith as much speed and power as he could put behind it.In a crystal-clear instant in time, Richard’s vision focused on the man with theknife standing rigid with surprise. Into that void in time Richard poured allhis effort, all his muscle, all his wrath, all his need. That instant belongedto him alone and he used it to his singular purpose.He could see the drops of sweat leave the man’s face as his head snapped towardRichard. Yellow-orange light from the lanterns reflected in tiny points on thosedrops as they floated weightless in midair. Richard could count each point oflight from each lantern in each individual droplet of sweat as his sword ever soslowly swept around. He could count each greasy strand of the man’s hair as itwhipped around, floating up into the air with the droplets.Richard knew that eyes all around the stable were watching, that the eyes of thegirl, too, were watching, but that made no difference. The only eyes thatmattered to him were the dark eyes that at last met his glare.In those black eyes Richard could see the initiation of thought. The tip ofRichard’s sword whistled through the dusty air. Lantern-light glinted off therazor sharp steel. He could see the blade mirrored in the man’s dark eyes. Thoseeyes reflected the recognition of the full dimension of the threat.Onward came the sword, sweeping like the crack of a whip toward those eyes,sweeping around toward the target Richard held in his own sight.In that instant, the man completed his thought and made the decision to act. Buteven in the infinitesimal fragment of time that it took to come to theconclusion of that thought, the lightning arc of the blade closed most of thedistance. Even as the man’s decision was being made, flinching fear fromRichard’s battle cry caused the man to tense.For that instant in time, the muscles of the man’s arms paused as fear foughtintent.It became a race to see which blade would first bite flesh.Losing that race would be irrevocable.With his gaze riveted on the man’s eyes, Richard at last saw his sword, flyingat frightening speed, entering his line of sight. Seeing that blade again filledhim with exhilaration.Driven by thundering rage, the blade caught the side of the man’s head levelwith his dark eyes, exactly where Richard intended it.In that instant, the crystal-clear moment in time that had been stretched to thebreaking point shattered in sound and fury. The world went red in Richard’svision as the man’s head came apart around the blade crashing through his skull.The hammer-hard sound of it thundered through the stables.Bone fragmented. Crimson droplets sprayed up and away. The entire top of theskull lifted as the blade crashed through living tissue. In a long trail acrossthe wall, bone, tissue, and blood traced the route of the sword’s sweep.In that instant of shattering violence, the man’s life was gone. Richard’sremorseless rage shielded him from feeling the pain of any pity.The force of the sword’s impact caused the arm with the knife to fall away fromthe girl even before the swing of Richard’s sword was complete. The man’s body,like nothing more than boneless meat, began collapsing.The man had decided to kill the girl, but after he had made that choice, he hadnot had enough time to make his blade do his bidding.Richard had.He felt his heart finish the beat it had begun when he had leaped into thenarrow window of time.The man’s body gathered speed as it descended until it hit the ground heavily,lifting a small cloud of dust. The top portion of his head, most of his scalpstill attached, landed with a heavy thud just outside the open stable doors,bouncing and tumbling away into the night, leaving a trail of gore to trace itscrooked route.Richard heard people gasp in shock. Others screamed.The little girl, shrieking in terror, scrambled away into her mother’soutstretched arms.As he held the blade cocked, ready for any other threat, Richard met the gaze ofthe wide eyes of the second man, still standing in place, held fast by Victor’sguards. The man made no attempt to escape or to fight.Victor charged in through a gap in the bystanders, his heavy mace raised andready. From somewhere Cara had appeared behind Richard, her Agiel in her fist.Richard spotted Nicci for the first time. She raced across the passageway, herarms held up.“No!” she screamed. “Stop!”Victor straightened in surprise. Nicci seized his raised wrist as if shebelieved he was about to slaughter the other prisoner.“Stand down, blacksmith!”Startled, Victor paused and let his arm drop.Nicci turned a furious glare on Richard. “You too, carpenter! You will do as Isay and stand down. Do you hear me!” she screamed in fury.Richard blinked. Carpenter?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23Through the haze of the sword’s anger storming through him, Richard realizedthat Nicci had to be up to something. He didn’t know her intent, but by callingboth Victor and him by a trade rather than by their real names she was sendingthem a signal that was too obvious to miss. She was making an emphatic bid forthem to catch on to her effort and to follow her lead.Probably because people often did call him “blacksmith,” Victor didn’t seem toget the hint. He started to open his mouth to say something. Nicci smacked himacross the face.“Silence! I will hear none of your excuses.”Shocked, Victor took a step back. The shock quickly curdled into a dark scowlbut he didn’t say anything.Seeing that Victor got the message to keep quiet, Nicci turned her ire onRichard. She shook her finger at him. “You will have to answer for this,carpenter.”Richard didn’t have any idea what she was up to, but when their eyes met he gaveher a slight nod. He feared to do anything else lest he spoil whatever it wasshe was doing.Nicci appeared to be worked up into a fit. “What’s the matter with you?” sheyelled at him. “Where would you ever get the unacceptable idea that you can actof your own accord in such a manner?”Richard didn’t know what she wanted him to say so he offered only a humbleshrug, as if he were too ashamed to speak up for himself.“He was saving my child!” cried Jamila. “That man was going to cut her throat.”Nicci wheeled indignantly to the woman. “How dare you show such little regardfor our fellow man! How dare you judge what is in another man’s heart! That isthe Creator’s exclusive right, not yours. Are you a witch woman who can see thefuture? If not, then you can’t say what he would have done. Do you think heshould be murdered for what you think he might do? Even if he would have acted,none of us alone has the authority to judge the right or wrong of whatever hedid.”Nicci turned again to Richard. “What would you expect the poor man to do? Thetwo of them are dragged in here by a mob, without any charges, trial, or evenbeing allowed to explain themselves. You treat a man like an animal and then aresurprised when he acts out of confusion and fear?“How do you expect Jagang the Just to ever decide to give our people anotherchance to do what is right and proper when we act like this? The man had a rightto fear for his life when among such a mindless rabble as he saw all around him.“As the mayor’s wife, I will not allow such behavior! Do you hear me! The mayorwill not like to hear how shamefully some of our fellow citizens have actedtonight. In the mayor’s absence, I will see that our ways are upheld. Now, putaway your sword.”Beginning to understand what she was doing, Richard made no attempt to answerand instead sheathed his sword, as instructed.As he took his hand from the hilt, the weapon’s rage extinguished. Richard’sknees nearly buckled. No matter the justification, the need, the number of timeshe righteously used the sword, killing remained a hideous deed.Not wanting to spoil Nicci’s act, Richard duly hung his head.She turned a fierce look on the crowd. They all took a step back. “We are apeaceful people. Have you all forgotten our duty to our fellow man? To theCreator’s ways? How can we ever expect the emperor to someday accept us backinto the fold of the Imperial Order if we behave like subhuman animals?”The crowd stood mute. Richard certainly hoped that they, too, grasped that Niccihad a purpose and they should not spoil what she was trying to accomplish.“As the mayor’s wife, I will not allow senseless violence to poison our peopleand our future.”A younger woman in the crowd put her hands on her hips and took a step forward.“But they were—”“We must at all times keep in mind our duty to our fellow man,” Nicci said in athreatening tone, cutting her off, “not our selfish desires.”With a surreptitious glance to Victor, he understood her meaning and pulled thewoman back to make sure she kept her mouth shut.Nicci glanced around at the guards. “It is our responsibility to guide ourfellow man, not to butcher him. One man has been murdered this night. Thepeople’s authorities will have to hear this case and decide what will become ofthis carpenter. Some of you will have to see to it that he is confined untilthen.“In the meantime, as the mayor’s wife, I will not allow this other man to meet asimilar unjust fate. I know my husband would want to set matters right but Ialso know that he would not want it to have to wait until tomorrow just for himto say as much. He would want it rectified immediately, so you will take thisother citizen outside of the city and release him. Let him go on his way inpeace. We will cause him no harm. The carpenter, as I said, will have to be helduntil he can be brought before the proper authorities to answer for his heinousdeed.”Victor bowed. “Very wise, madam. I’m sure your husband, the mayor, would bepleased that you intervened on his behalf.”Nicci glared at the top of his head for a moment while he was bowed before her.She then turned to stand before the second captive spy. She bowed to him.Richard noticed that somewhere along the line the cord of Nicci’s bodice hadcome unlaced. It wasn’t lost on the man, either. Her deep bow provided him agood long look at her cleavage. Once she straightened, it was a moment before hefinally looked up into her eyes.“I hope that you will accept our apology for your inhumane treatment. It is notthe way we were taught to respect all people as our brothers and equals.”The man made a face, as if to say he might be able to forgive his mistreatment.“I can understand why you people are so touchy, what with your insurrectionagainst the Imperial Order, and all.”“Insurrection?” Nicci waved a hand dismissively. “Nonsense. It was little morethan a misunderstanding. Some of the workers”—she gestured toward Richardwithout looking—”like these ignorant, selfish men, here, wanted more say forthemselves and higher wages. It was nothing more than that. As my husband hasoften told me, it was misconstrued and blown all out of proportion. Selfish mencaused an unfortunate panic that got out of control. It was much like thisterrible tragedy here tonight—a misunderstanding resulting in needless harm toone of the Creator’s innocent children.”The man regarded her with a long, unreadable look before he spoke. “And all ofAltur’Rang feels this way?”Nicci sighed. “Well, along with the vast majority of the people of Altur’Rang,my husband, the mayor, certainly does. He’s been working to bring to task thehotheads and troublemakers. Along with representatives of the people he hasworked to make these few reactionary types see what a mistake they made and whatgreat harm they do us all. They acted without considering the greater good. Myhusband has brought the leaders of the trouble before the people’s council andthey have decreed the proper punishment. Most have repented. At the same time,he works to reform and reeducate the less intelligent of the lot.”The man tipped his head to her in a slight bow. “Please tell your husband thathe is a wise man and has a wise wife who knows that her place is properly inservice to the greater good.”Nicci nodded in return. “Yes, exactly, the greater good. My husband has oftensaid that, despite our own personal wishes or feelings, we must always considerthe greater good above all else; that despite any personal sacrifice we mustthink only of the betterment of all people and not cling to the sinful ways ofindividual wishes and greed. No one has a right to place themselves above thewell-being of others.”Nicci’s words seemed to have struck a cord with the man; such notions were thefundamental teachings and beliefs of the Imperial Order. She knew precisely howto strum those cords.“How true,” he said as he watched her, taking another long look down the gapingneckline of her dress. “I guess I’d better be on my way.”“And where are you headed?” Nicci asked. Her hand came up to modestly containthe sagging front of her dress.He looked back up to her face. “Oh, we were just traveling through, headingfarther to the south to where we have family. We were hoping to take up somework, there. I didn’t know this fellow all that well. We’ve simply beentraveling together for the last few days.”“Well,” Nicci said, “considering what happened here tonight, I’m sure that myhusband would suggest that for your own safety you continue with your journeyand, considering the few reactionary types still about, it would be best if youwere to do so at once. There has already been one tragedy tonight; we would notlike to chance another.”The man passed a murderous glare across the assembled crowd. His gaze settled onRichard, but Richard kept his eyes turned to the ground.“Yes, of course, madam. Please thank the mayor for trying to bring the filthytroublemakers back to the ways of the Creator.”Nicci flicked her hand toward a few of the guards. “You men, show this citizensafely out of the city. Take enough men to ensure that there will be no trouble.And I need not remind you of how displeased the mayor and the people’s councilwould be should they discover that any harm whatsoever came to this man. He isto be allowed to go on his way.”The men bowed and mumbled that they would see to it. By the way they acted,Richard could tell that they knew how to fall back into the role of what lifehad been like under the Imperial Order. All the people in the stable watched insilence as the men disappeared into the night with their charge. Long after theywere gone, everyone stood still in tense silence, watching the empty doorway,fearful to speak until the man was far enough away, lest he hear anything.“Well,” Nicci said at last with a sigh, “I hope that he makes it back to hisfellow soldiers. If he does, then we have gone a long way toward spreading alittle confusion before the battle.”“Oh, he will,” Victor said. “He will be eager to report such news as you havegiven him tonight. Hopefully, they will be so confident that we can give them areal surprise.”“Let’s hope so,” Nicci said.Some of the people still remaining in the stable broke into chatter, pleasedwith Nicci’s apparent stratagem of confusing the enemy. Some bid a good nightand went on their way. Some stood around the corpse, staring.Nicci offered Victor a brief smile. “Sorry to have to strike you.”Victor shrugged. “Well, it was to a good purpose.”When Nicci turned to Richard, she looked uneasy, as if she feared a lecture or areprimand.“I want the troops coming this way to think they will have no trouble crushingus,” she explained. “Overconfidence leads to mistakes.”“There was more to it,” Richard said.Nicci cast a quick glance at the people still in the stables and then easedcloser to him so that others couldn’t hear. “You said that I could come and joinup with you once the troops coming to crush the people of Altur’Rang aredestroyed.”“And?”Her blue eyes turned as hard as iron. “And I intend to see to it.”Richard considered her for a time, finally deciding to let her do what she couldto help the people of Altur’Rang and not interfere with how she planned toaccomplish it. Besides, he was more than a little worried about what her planmight be. Right then, he didn’t really want to know what she was up to; healready had enough to worry about.Richard took the loose ends of the cords lacing her bodice, drew them tight, andretied them.She stood with her hands at her side, watching his eyes the whole time he didit. “Thank you,” she said when he finished. “I guess that must have come undonein all the excitement.”Richard ignored her lie and checked to the side to see Jamila there, behind someof the other people. The woman, her cheek swollen and red, was kneeling, huggingthe frightened little girl.Richard stepped closer. “How is she?”Jamila looked up at him. “Safe. Thank you, Lord Rahl. You saved her preciouslife. Thank you.”As the little girl sobbed and clutched her mother, she eyed Richard with a lookof terror, as if she feared he might slay her next. She had witnessed somethingterrible at Richard’s hand.“I’m relieved that she’s safe and unharmed,” he said to Jamila.Richard smiled at the girl, but received only a hateful glare in return.Nicci clasped his arm in empathy, but said nothing.The people still left in the stable finally spoke up to congratulate him onsaving the child. They all seemed to have guessed that Nicci’s words to the manwere a ruse of some sort. Many spoke up, then, to tell her that they thought herdeception was clever.“That should throw them off,” one of the men said.Richard knew that she had more planned than to simply “throw them off.” He wasconcerned about what she intended to do.He watched briefly as some of the men dragged away the dead spy. At Ishaq’sdirection, others began quickly cleaning up the gore. The smell of blood madehorses nervous and the sooner they were rid of it the better.The rest of the people bid Richard a safe journey and then departed for theirhomes. It wasn’t long before they had all gone. The men cleaning up the remainsfinished and left. Only Nicci, Cara, Ishaq, and Victor remained behind. Thestables became a quiet and empty place."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24Richard carefully surveyed the shadows before going to see to the horses thatIshaq had collected for him. The stables felt too quiet. He remembered the hushin the room in the inn before the thing came crashing through the wall. It washard not to find the sudden quiet menacing. He wished he had a way to know ifthe beast was near, or if it was about to pounce. He wished he knew how to fightsuch a thing. His fingers touched the pommel of his sword. If nothing else, atleast he had his sword and its attendant power.He remembered all too well the inhuman promises of suffering and torment leftlurking within Cara for him to find. It made him nauseated and light-headed justrecalling the wordless whisper of those covenants. He had to pause and put ahand on the rail to steady himself for a moment.As he glanced over to see Cara, he still felt the wordless joy of her beingalive and well. It lifted his heart just to see her looking back at him. He felta profound connection to her as a result of the experience of healing her. Hefelt as if he knew the woman beneath the armor of Mord-Sith a little better.Now he needed to help Kahlan, to see her alive and well.Two of the horses were already saddled and waiting, with the supplies loaded onthe others. Ishaq had always been as good as his word. Richard ran his handalong the flanks of the bigger bay mare as he entered her stall, feeling hermuscles and letting her know he was behind her so she wouldn’t be spooked. Oneear swiveled toward him.With all that had happened, to say nothing of the scent of blood in the air, thehorses were all jumpy. The mare tossed her head and stomped nervously at havinga stranger near. Before he went about hooking his bow to the saddle, he firststroked the mare’s neck and spoke softly to her. He reached up and gentlycaressed her ear. He was pleased that she settled down after a little assurance.When he stepped back out from the stall, Nicci was watching him, waiting forhim. She looked lost and lonely.“You will be careful?” she asked.“Don’t worry,” Cara said as she walked past carrying some of her things. On herway into the stall holding the smaller of the two saddled mares she said, “Iwill be giving him a very long lecture on the foolishness of his unthinkingactions tonight.”“What unthinking actions?” Victor asked.Cara laid an arm over the shoulder of her horse, idly running her fingersthrough its mane as she turned back to the blacksmith.“We have a saying in D’Hara. We are the steel against steel so that the LordRahl can be the magic against magic. What it means is that it’s foolish for theLord Rahl to needlessly risk his life in things like battles with blades. We cando that. But we cannot battle the magic. He alone is the one who must do that.To do so, he must be alive. Our job is keeping the Lord Rahl safe from weaponsof steel so that he can protect us against magic. That is the Lord Rahl’s duty.That is his part of the bond.”Victor gestured toward Richard’s sword. “I’d say he seems to do all right with ablade.”Cara arched an eyebrow. “Sometimes he is lucky. Need I remind you that he almostdied from getting himself shot with a simple arrow? Without a Mord-Sith, hewould be helpless,” she added for good measure.Richard silently rolled his eyes when Victor cast a worried look his way. Ishaq,too, seemed concerned as he peered at Richard as if he were a stranger he wasseeing for the first time. Both men had known him for nearly a year as simplyRichard, a man who loaded wagons for Ishaq’s transport company and hauling ironto Victor’s blacksmith shop. They had thought that he was married to Nicci. Theydidn’t know that he had really been Nicci’s captive at the time.Discovering that he was in fact the Lord Rahl, the nearly mythical freedomfighter from far to the north, was still somewhat disorienting for both men.They tended to view him as one of their own who had risen up to fight tyrannywith them. That was how they knew him. Whenever the Lord Rahl issue came up,they got nervous, as if they suddenly didn’t know how they should behave aroundhim.As Cara went about loading the rest of her things into saddlebags, Nicci laid ahand on Ishaq’s shoulder.“If you don’t mind, I need to see Richard alone for a moment before he leaves.”Ishaq nodded. “Victor and I will be outside. We have matters to discuss.”As the two men made for the door, Nicci cast Cara a brief glance. Cara gave herhorse a quick pat on the side and then followed the two men out of the stable,pulling the big door closed behind herself. Richard was amazed, and just alittle concerned, to see Cara leave without an argument.Nicci stood before him in the soft lamplight twining her fingers together andlooking rather uneasy, he thought.“Richard, I’m worried about you. I should be with you.”“You’ve started something tonight that I think you will have to be the one tofinish.”She sighed. “You’re right about that.”Richard wondered just what it was she had started, what it was she had in mind,but he was in a hurry to leave. While he was concerned for Nicci’s safety, hewas vastly more worried about Kahlan. He wanted to get going.“But I still—”“When you’re done helping these people end the immediate threat from thesoldiers who are on their way here, you can catch up with me,” Richard told her.“With this wizard, Kronos, leading them, the people here are certainly going toneed your help.”“I know.” She was nodding, having already been over all of this ground already.“Believe me, I intend to eliminate the threat descending upon Altur’Rang. Idon’t intend to allow it to waste a lot of my time and then I can leave to catchup with you.”A wave of cold dread washed through him as he suddenly grasped the core of herplan. He wanted to tell her to forget what she was thinking, but he made himselfkeep silent. He had important and perilous work of his own that he needed to getto. He wouldn’t want her telling him that he couldn’t do what he had planned.Besides, she was a sorceress who knew very well what she was doing. She had beena Sister of the Dark—one of six such women who had managed to become histeachers at the Palace of the Prophets. When one of them had tried to kill himto steal his gift, Richard had killed her instead. That had been the beginningof the battle that had brought down the palace. Jagang eventually captured therest, including Sister Ulicia, their leader. In order to save Kahlan’s life,Richard had once allowed five of them to swear a bond to him so that they couldescape the dream walker’s hold on them. Nicci hadn’t been with them at the time.Another later died in the sliph, leaving only those four Sisters of the Dark,besides Nicci, not in Jagang’s clutches.Nicci was certainly a formidable threat to any who opposed her. He just hopedshe wasn’t taking a foolish chance just to be able to more quickly get back toprotect him.Richard hooked his thumbs behind his belt, not quite knowing what it was shewanted. “You will be welcomed to join me whenever you can manage it. I told youthat.”“I know.”“A piece of advice.” He waited until her gaze turned up to his. “No matter howpowerful you think you are, something as simple as an arrow can still kill you.”A brief smile visited her face. “That advice goes both ways, wizard.”A thought occurred to him. “How will you find me?”She reached up and gripped his shirt at the collar as she leaned against him.“That’s why I wanted to be alone with you. I will need to touch you with magicso that I can find you.”Richard’s suspicion flared. “What kind of magic?”“I guess you could say that it’s a little like your bond to the D’Haran peoplewhich allows them to find you. Now is not the time to go into an explanation ofit.”Richard began to worry about why she would need to be alone with him to do sucha thing. Still gripping his shirt, she pressed against him, her eyes slidinghalf closed.“Just stay still,” she whispered.She looked rather hesitant and reluctant about whatever it was she had planned.She looked and sounded as if she were slipping into a trance.Richard could have sworn that the lamps had been brighter, before. Now thestable was dimly lit in a mellow orange glow. The hay smelled sweeter. The airfelt warmer.Richard thought that perhaps he shouldn’t be allowing her to do whatever it wasthat she intended to do. In the end, though, he decided that he trusted her.Nicci’s left hand released its grip on his shirt and slipped up and over hisshoulder to the back of his neck. Her fingers glided around his neck. Her handfisted, holding his hair at the back of his head to keep him still.Richard’s level of alarm rose. He suddenly wasn’t so sure that he wanted her totouch him with her power. He’d felt her magic several times before and it wasn’tsomething he was exactly eager to experience again.He wanted to back away, but, somehow, he didn’t.Nicci leaned in even more and gently kissed his cheek.It was more than a kiss.The world around him dissolved. The stables, the humid air, the sweet aroma ofhay, all seemed to cease to exist. The only thing that existed was hisconnection to Nicci, as if she were all that held him from evaporating as well.He was swept into a rising realm of breathless pleasure with all of life itself.It was an overpowering, disorienting, magnificent sensation. Everything, fromthe feel of the connection to her, the warmth and life of her, to all the beautyof the world, felt as if it flooded through him, filling him until it saturatedhis mind, making him dizzy with the staggering exhilaration of it.Every kind of pleasure he had ever known swept through him with overwhelmingforce, amplified beyond anything he had ever experienced, engulfing him in blissso intense that the satisfaction of it brought a gasp and tears.When Nicci broke the kiss on his cheek the world inside the stables swirled backin around him, and yet it seemed more intense than it had before, the sights andsmells more vibrant than he remembered. It was quiet but for the hiss of anearby lamp and the soft neigh of one of the horses. Richard’s hands trembledwith the lingering sensation of her kiss.He didn’t know if what Nicci had done had lasted for a second or an hour. It wasmagic completely unlike any Richard had ever felt before. It left him sobreathless that he had to remind himself to breath again.He blinked at her. “What… what did you do?”The slightest smile blossomed in the curve of her lips and in her blindinglyblue eyes. “I touched you with a small trace of my magic so that I can find you.I recognize my power. I will be able to follow it to you. Fear not, the effectwill last long enough for me to be able to find you.”“I think you did more, Nicci.”Her smile ghosted away. Her brow tightened with her concern. It took her amoment to find the words. At last she peered at him with an intensity that toldhim that it was important to her that he understand.“Always before, Richard, I have hurt you with magic—when I took you away; when Iheld you prisoner; even when I healed you. It was always hurtful or painful.Forgive me, but I wanted, just once, to give you a touch of magic that would notleave you being hurt by me, or hating me.”Her gaze sank away from his. “I wanted you to have a better memory of me than ofthose times before when I touched you with the pain of magic. I wanted, justonce, to give you a small trace of something pleasant, instead.”He could not begin to imagine what any more than a “small trace” would have beenlike.He lifted her chin, making her look up into his eyes. “I don’t hate you, Nicci.You know that. And I know that the times when you healed me you were giving memy life. That was what counted.”Finally, he was the one who had to look away from her blue eyes. It occurred tohim that Nicci was probably the most beautiful woman he had ever met.Other than Kahlan.“Thank you, though,” he managed, still feeling the lingering affects of thesensation.She gently clutched his arm. “You did a good thing, tonight, Richard. I thoughtsome pleasant magic would give you back some of your strength.”“I’ve seen a lot of people suffer and die. I couldn’t stand the thought of thelittle girl dying, too.”“I meant in saving Cara’s life.”“Oh. Well, I couldn’t stand the thought of the big girl dying, either.”Nicci smiled at that.He gestured to the horses. “I need to get going.”She nodded and he moved off to collect the horses and check their gear. Nicciwent to open the stable door. After she did, Cara came back in to get her horse.Dawn was still a couple of hours off. Richard realized that he was terriblytired, especially after the emotional strain of having used his sword, but hedid feel better after what Nicci had just done. He knew, though, that theywouldn’t be getting much sleep for a quite a while. They had a very long way totravel and he fully intended to do it as swiftly as possible. By taking freshhorses with them they would be able to ride hard, change mounts, and thencontinue to ride just as hard in order to make good time. He intended to ridemore than hard.Nicci held his horse’s bit as he stuffed his boot into the stirrup and swung upinto the saddle. The horse flicked her tail and danced about, eager to be out ofthe stable even if it was still night. Richard patted her shoulder to settle herdown; she would have plenty of time to show him her spirit.Cara, once in her saddle, turned to frown at him. “By the way, Lord Rahl, whereis it we’re traveling to in such a hurry?”“I need to go see Shota.”“Shota!” Cara’s jaw dropped. “We’re going to see the witch woman? Are you out ofyour mind?”Nicci, suddenly mortified, rushed to his side. “Going to the witch woman ismadness—to say nothing of the Imperial Order troops all along the way back upthrough the New World. You can’t do this.”“I have to. I think that Shota may be able to help me find Kahlan.”“Richard, she’s a witch woman!” Nicci was beside herself. “She’s not going tohelp you!”“She’s helped me before. She gave Kahlan and me a wedding gift. I think she mayremember it.”“A wedding gift?” Cara asked. “Are you crazy? Shota would just as soon kill youas not.”There was more truth in that than Cara knew. His relation with Shota had alwaysbeen an uneasy one.Nicci put a hand on his leg. “What wedding gift? What are you talking about?”“Shota wanted Kahlan to die because she feared that together we would conceivewhat Shota believed would be a monster child: a gifted Confessor. At ourwedding, as a truce, she gave Kahlan a necklace with a small dark stone. It’smagic of some sort that prevents Kahlan from getting pregnant. Kahlan and Idecided that for the time being, with all that’s going on and all that we haveto worry about, we would accept Shota’s truce.”There had been a time, when the chimes had been loosed, that magic of every sorthad failed. For a while they hadn’t known about the chimes, and that thenecklace’s magic had failed. It was then that Kahlan had conceived a child. Themen who beat her that terrible night had ended that.It was also possible that because of that brief failure of magic, the nature ofthe world had undergone a fundamental, irrevocable change that would eventuallylead to the end of all magic. Kahlan certainly believed that it was happening.There had been a number of strange events that were otherwise inexplicable. Zeddhad called it the cascade effect. He said that once begun such a thing could notbe stopped. Richard didn’t know if it was true that magic was failing or not.“Shota will remember the necklace she gave Kahlan. She will remember her magic,just as you will remember yours so that you will be able to find me. If anyonewill remember Kahlan, Shota will. I’ve had my disagreements with the witchwoman, but in the past I’ve also inadvertently helped her as well. She owes me.She will help me. She has to.”Nicci threw her hands up. “Of course such a thing has to be a necklace thatKahlan would wear, and not something that you would have. Don’t you see whatyou’re doing? Once again your mind has invented something that convenientlycan’t be proven. Everything you come up with is somewhere else or something wecan’t see. This necklace is just more of your dream.” Nicci pressed a hand toher forehead. “Richard, this witch woman is not going to remember Kahlan becauseKahlan doesn’t exist.”“Shota can help me. I know she can. I know she will. I can’t think of any betteropportunity to get answers. Time is slipping away. The longer Kahlan is withwhoever has her, the greater the danger to her life and the less my chance ofhelping get her back. I have to go to Shota.”“And what if you’re wrong?” Nicci demanded. “What if this witch woman refuses tohelp you?”“I will do whatever it takes to make her help me.”“Richard, please, put this off for at least a day or two. We can talk itthrough. Let me help you properly consider your options.”Richard pulled the reins around, letting his horse and the ones tethered to itstart toward the door. “Going to Shota is my best chance of getting answers. I’mgoing.”Richard ducked under the big doorway as they rode out into the night. Out acrossthe expanse of grounds the cicadas droned on.He pulled his horse around to see Nicci standing in the doorway, lit from behindby the lanternlight. “You be careful,” he told her. “If not for yourself, thenfor me.”That, at least, made her smile. She shook her head in resignation. “By yourcommand, Lord Rahl.”He waved his farewell to Victor and Ishaq.“Safe journey,” Ishaq said as he removed his hat.Victor saluted with a fist over his heart. “Come back to us when you can,Richard.”Richard promised them he would.As they started down the road, Cara shook her head. “I don’t know why youbothered going to all the trouble to save my life. We’re going to die, youknow.”“I thought you were coming with me to prevent that from happening.”“Lord Rahl, I don’t know if I can protect you against a witch woman. I’ve neverfaced their power, nor have I heard of any Mord-Sith who has. A Confessor’spower used to be deadly to Mord-Sith; it could be that witch woman’s power isjust as fatal. I will do my best, but I just think you should know that I mightnot be able to protect you from a witch woman.”“Oh, I’d not worry about it, Cara.” Richard said as he squeezed his legs andshifted his weight, urging his horse into a canter. “If I know Shota, she won’tlet you get anywhere near her, anyway.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25As she marched down the side of a wide thoroughfare leading a small knot of men,Nicci thought that in a way it seemed like the sun had gone out since Richardhad left. She missed just being able to look into his eyes, at the spark of lifein them. For two days she had tirelessly gone about the urgent preparations forthe imminent attack, but, without Richard around, life seemed empty, lessbright, less… less of everything.At the same time, when he had been around, his single-minded determination tofind his imagined love had been draining. In fact, she had sometimes wanted tostrangle him. She had tried everything from patience to anger in an attempt toget him to come around to seeing the truth, but it had been like trying to pushagainst a mountain. In the end, nothing she’d done or said had made anydifference.For his own sake she earnestly wanted to help him to come to grips with reality.To do so she had to challenge him in an effort to try to get him to come to hissenses before something terrible happened, but at the same time trying to makehim see the truth somehow always seemed to cast her as a villain working againsthim. She hated being in that position.Nicci hoped that by the time she finished helping to rid Altur’Rang of thethreat of the approaching Imperial Order troops and their wizard, Kronos, shecould quickly catch up with Richard and Cara. With spare horses and as fast asshe knew he would ride, Nicci realized that she would not be able to catch upwith him until after he reached the witch woman. If he even made it that far. IfShota didn’t kill him once he did.From what Nicci knew of witches, Richard’s chances of coming out of her lairalive were pretty slim. He would have to face the witch woman without Nicci’shelp and protection. Still, he knew the woman, and she was a woman in everysense, from what Nicci had heard of her, so maybe Richard would at least becivil. It was not at all wise to be impolite to witches.But even surviving an encounter with a witch woman he would still be devastatedif she didn’t help him and Nicci knew she couldn’t because there was no missingwoman for Richard to find. At times it infuriated her that he was so obstinateabout something so obviously nothing more than an illusion. At other times sheworried that he really was losing his mind. That was too chilling a thought tocontemplate.Nicci paused at the side of the road with a sudden, terrible realization.The men following her lurched to a halt when she did, bringing her out of herthoughts. They were all with her either to see to her instructions in regard tosome of the defenses of the city or else to carry messages as needed. Now theystood silent and uneasy, not knowing why she had stopped.“Up there,” she said to the men, pointing at a three story brick building on thecorner across the street. “Make sure that we can use that place to goodadvantage and put at least a couple dozen archers in the windows. See that theyhave a large supply of arrows.”“I will go take a look,” one of the men said before running off across the road,dodging wagons, horses, and hand-drawn carts.People rushed along the side of the street passing around Nicci and the men withher as if they were a rock in a swiftly moving river. Passersby spoke in hushedtones among themselves as they coursed between clusters of hawkers calling outtrying to sell their goods, or people gathered to urgently discuss the impendingbattle for the city and what they would do to protect themselves. Wagons ofevery sort, from big freight wagons pulled by teams of six horses to smallwagons pulled by a single horse, sped past in a hurry to complete thestockpiling of provisions or other necessary work while they still could.Despite the din of horses, wagons, and people, Nicci didn’t really hear any ofit; she was thinking about the witch woman.Nicci had suddenly realized that Shota might not simply be unwilling to helpRichard, but she might not tell him so. Witch women had their own way of doingthings, and their own ends.If this woman thought Richard was being too insistent or assertive, she verywell might decide to get rid of him by sending him on a useless quest to theends of the world. She very well might do such a thing simply to amuse herself,or to doom him to die a slow death on an endless march across some distantdesert. A witch woman might do such a thing just because she could. Richard, inhis urgency to find his fantasy woman, wouldn’t consider those possibilities. Hewould promptly head off to where she pointed.Nicci was furious with herself for letting him leave to go to such a dangerouswoman. But what could she do? She couldn’t very well forbid him from going.Her only chance was to get rid of Brother Kronos and his troops as swiftly aspossible and then go after Richard and do what she could to protect him.She spotted the man she had sent to check the brick building sidestepping hisway between the wagons and horses as he ran back across the road. Nicci noticedthat even with all the people out traveling the roads of the city, it was stillmuch less busy than an ordinary day. People everywhere were making preparations;some had already holed up in places where they thought they might be safe. Niccihad been with the Order when they swept into a city; there was no safe place.The man dodged his way around an empty wagon bouncing past and at last reachedNicci’s side. He stood silently waiting. He was afraid to speak until sherequested his report. He was afraid of her. Everyone was afraid of her. Shewasn’t just a sorceress; she was a sorceress in a bad mood and they all knew it.No one understood why she seemed so ill-tempered, but for two days everyone hadwalked on egg shells when they were around her. It had nothing to do with them,and not even anything to do with Richard racing off on his mad search for awoman who didn’t exist, but none of them knew that. Nicci was mentally immersedin preparing herself for the ferocity of the violence to come, rehearsing in hermind the various things she might need to do, and hardening herself to it all.When on the brink of unleashing almost inconceivable savagery, one did not hum amerry tune and remark on the lovely day. One nursed dark thoughts.Nicci never bothered to try to explain her mood; going through the effort ofdoing so would drain some of her store of energy. Preparing in her mind togather every bit of skill, knowledge, wisdom, and power she had at her disposalrequired a certain kind of withdrawal. There were violent and deadly forcesthese people could never begin to comprehend that she had to be ready to unleashin an instant. She couldn’t explain all of that to everyone. They would justhave to deal with it.“Well?” she calmly asked the man as he stood silently catching his breath.“It will work,” he said. “They do knitting and make cloth there. All threefloors are pretty open so archers will be able to quickly and easily move fromwindow to window to get the best shot.”Nicci nodded. She put a hand to her brow to shield her eyes from the low sun asshe looked back to the west along the wide boulevard. She studied the layout ofthe roads and the angles at which they crossed. She finally decided that thecrossroads where they stood, with the brick building across the way, was thebest spot. With as wide as both thoroughfares were, these roads would likely bethe choice of enemy cavalry in the eastern part of the city. She knew the waythe Order ran their attacks. They liked width so as to present the strongestfront, the most powerful blow in order to break the enemy apart. She was prettysure that they would send cavalry in this way if they came in from the east, asshe expected.“Good,” she told the man. “See to getting archers here along with a heavy supplyof arrows. Be quick about it—I don’t think we have much time.”As he ran to see to it, Nicci spotted Ishaq in the distance racing up the roadin a wagon pulled by two of his big draft horses. He looked to be in a hurry.She had a good idea why he was coming for her, but she tried not to think aboutit. She turned to another of the men with her.“Back there, just after the brick building where we will station the archers, Iwant spikes placed. The span of the road is hemmed in by buildings on bothsides.” She gestured to the road that crossed the main thoroughfare before thebrick building. “Down the street to each side as well, so that if the remainingmen charging in try to take either route to escape they will get the same.”Once the enemy charged up the main route into Altur’Rang, they would abruptlypull up the spikes to impale them. The archers would then pick off all the thosecaught in the bottleneck between the spikes and the men still rushing up fromthe rear.The man nodded and ran off to see to her orders. She had already instructedeveryone on the spikes. Victor had his blacksmith shop and a number of othersworking feverishly to manufacture the simple but deadly traps. They were littlemore than sharpened iron bar stock that was all connected together, almost likea picket fence, but with different length chain between the top crossbar and theupper portion of the spikes.Sections of these linked spikes were laid in the roads all over the city. Lyingdown flat they didn’t prevent travel on the road, but when cavalry charged inthe pointed ends of the entire section were lifted and an iron brace was jammedin place. The different length of chains attaching the spikes to the crossbarallowed the deadly spikes to hang at varying distances from the crossbar, thusmaking them stick up at different angles. Making them stick up at uneven anglesallowed them to be far more treacherous than a simple straight line of spikes.If it was done properly, the enemy cavalry would unexpectedly run their horsesright onto the sharp iron tips. Even if they tried to jump them the horses wouldmore likely than not be ripped open. It was simple but highly effective.There were traps made of the iron sections all over the city, usually atintersections. Once the sections were lifted they couldn’t easily be lowered.The panicked horses would be gored on the spikes or at the least wouldn’t beable to escape the confinement created by the obstacle. As the cavalry chargedup onto the spikes, the soldiers would either be thrown off their horses andlikely injured or killed, or they would have to dismount in order to try to dealwith the obstruction. Either way, the archers would then have a much betterchance of picking them off than if they were just charging past.The men manning the sections of spikes were instructed to judge the situationand not to necessarily pull the spikes up just as the cavalry ran up to them. Insome cases it would be better to wait until some of the men had already chargedpast. If there was a large number of cavalry this would allow the defenders tosplit the enemy force, not only spreading confusion among the attack, butbreaking it apart, severing the lines of command, making it lose its advantageof unity, and making it easier to deal with the fragmented force. Decisivelyeliminating the cavalry was essential to stopping the invasion.Nicci knew, though, that in the panic of facing a frightening wall of chargingenemy soldiers screaming for blood, such careful plans tended to be forgotten.She knew that at the sight of such fearsome soldiers with weapons raised, someof the men would flee, failing to raise the spikes before they did. Nicci hadseen such terror before. That was why she had placed redundant sections ofspikes.Nearly everyone in the city was committed to its defense. Some would be moreeffective than others. Even women at home with children had supplies of things,from rocks to boiling oil, that they intended to throw down on any invadingsoldiers. There had not been a lot of time to make extravagant weapons, butthere were men everywhere with stacks of spears. A sharpened pole wasn’t fancy,but if it took down a cavalry horse or impaled a man, it was fancy enough. Itdidn’t matter if it was cavalry or foot soldiers, they all had to be defeated,so there were men of the city by the thousands with bows. With a bow, even anold man could kill a vigorous, muscular, hulking young soldier.An arrow could even take down a wizard.It would be futile to have the men of the city trying to fight experiencedsoldiers in a traditional battle. They had to deny the Order’s soldierseverything they were used to using.Nicci’s object had been to make the city one big trap. Now, she had to draw theOrder into that trap.To that end, she saw Ishaq’s wagon rumbling toward her. People scattered out ofthe way. Ishaq pulled back on the reins and drew the big horses to a halt. Acloud of dust boiled up.He set the brake and leaped down off the wagon, something she wouldn’t haveexpected he could do with such agility. He held his hat on with one hand as heran. He was holding something else up in his other hand.“Nicci! Nicci!”She turned to the men with her. “You’d all best see to the things we’vediscussed. I don’t think we have more than a few hours.”The men looked surprised and alarmed.“You don’t think they will wait until morning?” one asked.“No. I believe they will attack this evening.” She didn’t tell them why shethought so.The men nodded and rushed off to their assignments.Ishaq came to a panting halt. His face was nearly as red as his hat.“Nicci, a message.” He waved the paper before her. “A message for the mayor.”Nicci’s insides tightened.“A group of men rode in,” he said. “They were carrying a white flag, just as yousaid they would. They brought a message for ‘the mayor.’ How did you know?”She ignored the question. “Have you read it, yet?”His face went red. “Yes. So did Victor. He is very angry. It is not a good thingto make the blacksmith angry.”“Do you have a horse, as I requested?”“Yes, yes, I have a horse.” He handed her the paper. “But I think that you hadbetter read this.”Nicci unfolded the paper and read it silently to herself.Citizen mayor,I received word that the people of Altur’Rang, under your direction, wish torenounce their sinful ways and bow again to the wise, merciful, and sovereignauthority of the Imperial Order.If it is true that you wish to spare the people of Altur’Rang the totaldestruction we reserve for insurrectionists and heathens, then as a token ofyour good intent and willing submission to the jurisdiction of the ImperialOrder, you will bind your lovely and loyal wife’s hands and send her to me asyour humble gift. Fail to turn over your wife as instructed and everyone inAltur’Rang will die.In the service of the merciful Creator,Brother Kronos,Commander of His Excellency’s reunification force.Nicci crushed the message in her fist. “Let’s go.”Ishaq replaced his hat and scrambled to catch up with her as she marched towardthe wagon. “You don’t seriously intend to do as this brute demands, do you?”Nicci put a foot on the iron step and climbed up onto the wagon’s wooden seat.“Let’s go, Ishaq.”He muttered to himself as he climbed into the wagon beside her. He threw off thebrake and flicked the reins, yelling for people to get out of the way as heswung the wagon around. Dirt and dust spiraled up off the wheels as he turnedthe wagon around in the road. He cracked his whip above the horses’ flanks,crying out to urge them away. The wagon slid around and finally straightened asthe horses threw their weight against the hames.Nicci held on to the side rail with one hand as the wagon lurched ahead, lettingher other hand, with the message crumpled in her fist, rest in the lap of herred dress. She watched without seeing as they raced through the streets ofAltur’Rang, past buildings and storefronts, other wagons, horses, and people onfoot. Low sunlight flickered through rows of trees to the left as they racednorth along the wide boulevard. At vegetable, cheese, bread, and butcher standsunder awnings, some drab and some striped, a press of people were buying up allthe food they could before the impending storm.The road narrowed as it passed into ancient sections of the city, becomingclogged with wagons, horses, and people. Without slowing much at all, Ishaqswung his two big draft horses off the main road and took shortcuts throughalleyways behind tightly packed rows of buildings where entire families lived ina single room. Laundry stretched on lines that crisscrossed small yards and in anumber of places, strung between opposing second-story apartments, stretchedacross the alleyway over their heads. Nearly each tiny plot in the back of thecrowded buildings was used for growing food or keeping chickens. Wings flappedand feathers flew as the birds panicked at the sight of the wagon thunderingpast their yard.Ishaq deftly handled the team as it raced at a frightening speed, guiding themaround obstacles of shacks, fences, walls, and random trees. He called outwarnings as he charged across busy roads. Startled people drew back, letting himpass.The wagon turned up a street Nicci remembered all too well, following beside ashort wall that eventually curved it along the entrance road to the warehousedoors of Ishaq’s transport company. The wagon bounced into the rutted yardoutside the building and came to a crooked halt in the shade of huge oaks risingabove the wall.Nicci climbed down as she saw one of the double doors opening. Apparently havingheard the noise Victor emerged from the building, glowering like he intended tomurder the next person he could get his hands on.“Have you seen the message?” He demanded.“Yes, I have. Where’s the horse I asked for?”He pointed a thumb back over his shoulder toward the open door. “Well, what arewe going to do now? The attack will probably come at dawn. We can’t allow thosesoldiers to take you back with them to the army. We can’t let them leave andreport that we won’t do as Kronos demands. What are we going to tell them?”Nicci tilted her head toward the building. “Ishaq, would you go get the horse,please?”He made a sour face. “You ought to marry Richard. You make a good pair. You areboth crazy.”Startled, Nicci could only stare at the man.She finally found her voice. “Ishaq, please, we don’t have a lot of time. Wedon’t want those fellows to go back empty-handed.”“Yes, Your Highness,” he mocked, “allow me to get your royal mount for you.”“I’ve never seen Ishaq act like that,” she said to Victor as she watched the manstalking toward the door, muttering curses under his breath.“He thinks you’re crazy. So do I.” Victor planted his fists on his hips. “Hasthat ruse back at the stables with the spy gone bad? Or is this what you plannedall along?”In no mood to discuss it with the man, Nicci returned the glare in kind. “Myplan,” she said through gritted teeth, “is to get this over with as soon aspossible and to keep the people of Altur’Rang from being slaughtered.”“What’s that got to do with turning you over to Brother Kronos as a gift?”“If we allow them to attack at dawn, they will have the advantage. We need themto attack today.”“Today!” Victor glanced west, toward the low sun. “But it will be dark soon.”“Exactly,” she said as she leaned in the back of the wagon and retrieved alength of rope.Victor stared off at the heart of the city as he thought about it. “Well, allthings considered, I guess it would be better not to face them in the day, ontheir terms. If we could somehow get them to attack today, they would soon runout of daylight. That would work to our advantage.”“I will bring them to you,” she said. “You just be ready.”The creases across Victor’s forehead deepened. “I don’t know how you’re going toget them to attack today, but we’ll be ready if they do.”Ishaq came out of the warehouse leading a white stallion covered with mottledblack spots. The mane, tail, and legs below the hocks were black. The horselooked not only elegant, but had a tough demeanor about him, as if it would haveboundless endurance. Still, it wasn’t what she had been expecting.“He doesn’t look all that big,” she said to Ishaq.Ishaq gave the horse an affectionate rub on its white face. “You did not saybig, you said that you wanted a steady horse that would not spook easily, onethat had a fearless spirit.”Nicci took another look at the horse. “I just assumed that such a horse would bebig.”“She’s a crazy woman,” Ishaq muttered to Victor.“She’s going to be a dead crazy woman,” Victor said.Nicci handed Victor the rope. “This will be easier if you stand on the wall,after I’m mounted.”She stroked the horse under his jaw and then his silky ears. The animal nickeredhis appreciation and nudged his head against her. Nicci held his head andtrickled a thin thread of her Han into the creature, giving him a bit of calmingintroduction. She ran a hand over his shoulder and then along the side of hisbelly as she inspected him.Without comment, Victor climbed up the wall and waited until she boosted herselfup and was seated in the saddle. Nicci arranged the skirts of her red dress andthen unbuttoned it to the waist. She pulled her arms out of the sleeves one at atime, holding the front of the dress against her chest and then holding it upwith her elbows as she lifted her hands toward Victor, her wrists pressedtogether.Victor’s face went as red as her dress. “Now what are you doing?”“These men are experienced Imperial Order troops. Some will be officers. I spenta lot of time in the Order’s camp. I was widely known—to some as the SlaveQueen, and to others as Death’s Mistress. It’s possible that certain of thesemen may have served in Jagang’s army during that time and so they very well mayrecognize me, especially if I were to wear a black dress. Just in case, I’mwearing a red dress.“I also need to give these men something to stare at to keep them off guard andhopefully from recognizing me. It will disrupt the usual calculating judgment ofsoldiers such as these. It will also get Kronos’s attention and make him thinkthat the ‘mayor’ is desperate to appease him. Nothing rouses the blood lust inthese kind of men more than weakness.”“It’s going to get you in trouble before you even get to Kronos.”“I’m a sorceress. I can take care of myself.”“Seems to me that Richard is a wizard and carries a sword charged with ancientmagic and even he got into trouble when he was greatly outnumbered. He wasoverpowered and nearly killed.”Nicci again lifted her hands out toward Victor, wrists together.“Tie them.”Victor glared at her a moment before finally giving in. With a growl he setabout binding her wrists. Ishaq held the reins just under the horse’s bit as hewaited.“Is this horse fast?” she asked as she watched Victor wrapping rope around herwrists.“Sa’din is fast,” Ishaq told her.“Sa’din? Doesn’t that mean ‘the wind’ in the old tongue?”Ishaq nodded. “You know the old tongue?”“A little,” she said. “Today, Sa’din will need to be as swift as the wind. Nowlisten to me, both of you. I don’t intend on getting myself killed.”“Few people do,” Victor griped.“You don’t understand; this will be my best chance to get near Kronos. Once theattack begins it would be difficult not only to find him, but, even if we didknow where he was, it would be next to impossible to get close to him. He wouldbe dealing death against the innocent in ways you cannot even imagine, spreadingfear, panic, and death. That makes him valuable to them. In battle theirsoldiers will be looking for anyone trying to take out their wizard. I have todo it now. I intend to end it tonight.”Victor and Ishaq shared a look.“I want everyone to be ready,” she said. “When I come back I expect there willbe some very angry people behind me.”Victor looked up after yanking the knot tight. “How many angry people?”“I intend to have their entire force right on my heels.”Ishaq gently rubbed Sa’din’s face. “What are they going to be angry about? If Imay ask.”“Besides trying to take out their wizard, I intend to give the hornets’ nest agood stiff whack.”Victor sighed irritably. “We’ll be ready for them when they attack, but once yougo in there I’m not so sure you will be able to get away.”Nicci wasn’t either. She remembered a time when she went about her plans notcaring if she lived or died carrying them out. Now she cared.“If I don’t come back, then you will just have to do your best. Hopefully, evenif they kill me, I will be able to take Kronos out with me. Either way, we’velaid a lot of surprises for them.”“Does Richard know what you had planned?” Ishaq asked as he squinted up at her.“I expect he knew. He had the good grace, though, not to make me feel any moreafraid by arguing with me about what I know I must do. This is not a game. Weare all fighting for our very lives. If we fail, then innocent, decent peopleare going to be slaughtered in numbers that stagger the imagination. I’ve beenon the other end of attacks like this. I know what’s coming. I’m trying toprevent it. If you don’t want to help, then just stay out of my way.”Nicci looked at each man in turn. Chagrined, they both kept silent.Victor went back to his work and quickly finished up with binding her wrists. Hepulled a knife from his boot and sliced off the excess length of rope.“Who do you want to take you to the soldiers who are waiting?” Ishaq asked.“I think you’d better take me, Ishaq. While Victor alerts everyone and sees tothe preparations, you will be a representative of the mayor.”“All right,” he said as he scratched the hollow of his cheek.“Good,” she said as she picked up the reins.Before she could say anything else, Victor cleared his throat. “There is oneother matter I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. But we’ve both been busy…”Victor uncharacteristically looked away from her.“What is it?” she asked him.“Well, ordinarily I wouldn’t say anything, but I think maybe you ought to know.”“Know what?”“People are beginning to question Richard.”Nicci frowned. “Question him? What do you mean? Question him in what way?”“Word has gotten around about why he left. People are worried that he isabandoning them and their cause to chase phantoms. They question if they shouldbe following such a man. There is talk that he’s… that he’s, you know, derangedor something. What should I tell them?”Nicci took a deep breath as she collected her thoughts. This was what she hadfeared. This was one of the reasons she had thought it important that he notleave—especially the way he did, right before the attack.“Remind them,” she said as she leaned toward him, “that Lord Rahl is a wizard,and a wizard can see things—such as hidden, distant threats—that they cannot. Awizard does not go around explaining his actions to people.“The Lord Rahl has many responsibilities other than just this one place. If thepeople here wish to live free, to live their own lives as they wish, then theymust choose to do so for their own sake. They must trust that Richard, as theLord Rahl and as a wizard, is off doing what is best for our cause.”“And do you believe that?” the blacksmith asked.“No. But there is a difference. I can follow the ideals he has shown me while atthe same time working to bring Richard back to his senses. The two are notincompatible. But the people must trust in their leader. If they think he is amadman they may fall back on fear and give up. Right now we can’t afford thatrisk.“Whether Richard is sane or not it doesn’t change the validity of the cause. Thetruth is the truth—Richard or no Richard.“Those troops coming to murder us are real. If they win, then those who are notkilled will be enslaved once more under the yoke of the Imperial Order. IfRichard is alive, dead, sane, or mad, it does not change that fact.”Victor, his arms folded, nodded.Nicci moved her leg back and pressed her heel into Sa’din’s side, moving hisrump closer to the wall. She turned the back of her shoulders to the blacksmithstanding on that wall beside her. “Pull my dress down to my waist, and be quickabout it—the sun will be setting soon.”Ishaq turned away, shaking his head.Victor hesitated a moment, then sighed in resignation and did as she hadinstructed.“All right, Ishaq, let’s go. Lead the way.” She looked back over her shoulder atVictor. “I will bring you the enemy, chasing the setting sun.”“What should I tell the men?” Victor asked.Nicci shrouded herself in the cold exterior she had used so often throughout herlife, the cold calm of Death’s Mistress.“Tell them to think dark and violent thoughts.”For the first time, Victor’s glower twisted into a grim smile."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26The soldiers atop huge warhorses peered down at Nicci as Ishaq led her horse toa stop beside the community well in the small square at the eastern edge of thecity. Her stallion, Sa’din, felt small in the presence of such huge beasts.Armored plate down the front of their heads lent them a threatening appearance.These were cavalry horses and the armor helped protect them from arrows as theycharged enemy lines. They pawed the ground and snorted their disdain for thesmaller horse come among them. Sa’din backed a step, just out of range of one ofthe warhorse’s teeth when it snapped, but he didn’t shy away.If the horses looked to be frightening animals, the men were clearly theirmasters. Dressed in dark leather armor plates and shirts of chain mail andcarrying an array of sinister weapons, these men were not merely brutish-lookingbut larger than any of the men defending the city. Nicci knew that they wouldhave been selected for the mission because of the way they looked. The Orderliked sending such intimidating messages to strike fear into the hearts of theirenemies.From dark windows, recessed doorways, narrow streets, and the shadows inalleyways people who had retreated out of the open watched the woman stripped toher waist, her wrists bound, being handed over to the soldiers. Nicci hadendured the ride through the city by not thinking about it and instead focusingon her need to get this over with so she could catch up with Richard. That waswhat mattered. So people looked at her—what difference did it make? She had hadto endure far worse at the hands of the men of the Order.“I am an aide to the mayor,” Ishaq said in a subservient tone to the powerfullybuilt man atop a towering, brown, bull neck gelding. The butt of the pole withthe white flag rested on the man’s saddle between his legs, his meaty fistgripping it halfway up the length of the stout shaft. The man sat mute, waiting.Ishaq licked his lips as he bowed before going on. “He sent me in his place withhis woman, his wife… as a gift to the great Kronos to show our sincerity inagreeing with his wishes.”The soldier, a midlevel officer of some sort, smirked at Nicci after taking along and deliberate look at her breasts. Broad leather belts held severalknives, a flail, a short sword, and a crescent-bladed axe. The mail and metalrings along studded straps crossing his broad chest jangled when his horsestomped its hooves. She was relieved not to recognize the man and kept her headturned down to hide her face from the men with him.Still, the officer said nothing.With one hand Ishaq swept his hat off his head. “Please relay our message ofpeace to—”The officer tossed the pole with the white flag down to Ishaq. Ishaq swiftlyreplaced his hat in order to catch the pole with one hand, his other stilltightly gripping the reins just below Sa’din’s bit. The pole looked heavy, butIshaq had been loading wagons for most of his life and had no trouble with it.“Kronos will let you know if the offering is satisfactory,” the officer growled.Ishaq cleared his throat, rather than say anything else, and again bowedpolitely. The soldiers all snickered at him before taking another knowing lookat Nicci’s exposed condition. They obviously greatly enjoyed exerting theirdominance over others.Most of them had metal rings or pointed metal rivets pierced through theirnoses, ears, and cheeks in an attempt to make them look more fierce. Niccithought that it simply made them look silly. Several of the dozen men had wild,dark, tattooed designs sweeping across their faces, also intended to intimidate.These were men who had risen to their highest ideal in life: to be savages.It was somewhat common for many of the women in the cities surrendering toadvancing Imperial Order troops to come out stripped to the waist as a petitionfor leniency. Because it was such a common form of submission, the soldiers werenot at all surprised by the manner in which the wife of the mayor was beingsurrendered. That, of course, was one of the reasons why Nicci had done it. Suchbids for mercy and gentle treatment were never honored, but the women whooffered themselves in such a manner didn’t know that.Nicci knew because she had often been with the Order troops when they took suchwomen captive. Such obliging people imagined that surrender in such asubservient manner would be ingratiating and elicit reasonable treatment. Theyhad no idea that they had willingly given themselves over to incomprehensiblehorrors. The soldiers’ treatment of women captives was dismissed by theintellectuals of the Order as a trivial matter compared to the greater good theOrder was bringing to the nonbelievers.Nicci sometimes longed for death rather than continue to live with such memoriesand the knowledge that she had once been a party to such horrors. What shewanted now, though, was to set things right as only she could do. She wanted toparticipate in wiping the scourge of the Order from existence.The grim officer who had carried the white flag into Altur’Rang bent down andnow took the reins to her horse from Ishaq. He stepped his mount close to her.As he leaned toward her he casually seized her left nipple, twisting it as hespoke intimately to her.“Brother Kronos tires quickly of a woman, no matter how beautiful she is. Iexpect it will be no different with you. When he moves on to the next he givesus the one he is finished with. Know that I will be first.”The men with him chuckled. He flashed her a grin. His dark eyes gleamed withmenace. He twisted harder until she gasped in pain and tears stung her eyes.Satisfied with himself and her timid reaction, he released her. Nicci squeezedher eyes shut as she pressed the back of her bound wrists to herself trying toease the throbbing pain.When he batted her arms away from her breast, she jumped in surprise, thenlowered her gaze in submission. How many times had she seen women do similarthings trying to appease such men, praying silently for deliverance as they didso? For those women, deliverance never came. Nicci recalled thinking at the timethat the Order’s teachings had to be right, that the Creator really was on theirside, for he easily tolerated such behavior from his champions.Nicci did not bother to pray for deliverance; she intended to create her own.As the man turned his horse and led her away, Nicci cast one last look over hershoulder at Ishaq, standing with his red hat in both hands, turning the brimaround and around in his fingers. His eyes glistened with tears. She hoped thatthis wasn’t the last time she would ever see him or the others, but she knewthat such a possibility was all too real.The officer kept ahold of the reins, so she rode gripping the horn of thesaddle. As they rode east, the company of men closely surrounded her—more to geta good look at her, she thought, than from any worry that she might escape. Bythe way they swayed easily in their saddles and deftly handled their mounts,these were experienced horsemen who spent the majority of their waking hours inthe saddle. They had no fear of her getting away from them.As they rode east on a dusty road, the men all grinned their silent promiseswhenever they looked her over. She knew, though, that none of them had enoughrank or stature to dare to drag her off her horse for a little sport along theway. Men like Kronos did not appreciate their conquests freshly raped and thesemen knew it. Besides, they were surely figuring that they would soon enough havetheir turn at her—and if not her, then their pick once they stormed intoAltur’Rang.Nicci tried to ignore the leering men by concentrating on what she had to do.She knew that such behavior was part of their routine. They could think ofnothing more clever than simple innuendo and intimidation, so they used it likea worry stone turned over and over in the fingers. As she rode, her resolvebecame her refuge.It would still be a while before the low sun at her back set, but already thecicadas had started in with their endless droning song. They reminded her ofRichard and the night he had explained about the creatures that emerged from theground every seventeen years. It seemed remarkable that the cicadas had come tentimes in her life and Nicci had never even realized it. Life under the spell atthe Palace of the Prophets had not simply been very long, but had beeninsulating in ways she had never even realized. While the world went on aroundher, she had been devoting her time to other worlds. Others, like the Sisters ofthe Dark who had been Richard’s teachers there, had succumbed to seductivepromises from those other worlds. Nicci had, as well, but not because of thosepromises. She had simply believed that this world held nothing of value to her.Until, one day, when Richard had shown up.The air was warm and humid so at least Nicci wasn’t cold as she rode, but themosquitoes were starting to come out and they were becoming obnoxious. She wasglad that her hands weren’t tied behind her back so she could at least keep thebiting bugs off her face. The wheat-covered hills they passed through to theeast of the city shimmered a greenish gold in the late light, almost likeburnished bronze. She didn’t see any people working in the countryside and theroads remained empty. Everyone had fled before the impending arrival of thearmy, like animals before a wildfire.Cresting a hill, Nicci finally saw them, men and horses from the Imperial Orderspread out across the broad valley below her like a dark flood. It appeared theyhadn’t been there long as it looked like they were only starting to set up camp.Apparently, they wanted to be close to the city so that when they began theirattack in the morning they wouldn’t have far to go.The ground was only just beginning to be churned up by all the men, horses,mules, and wagons. Individual territory had been staked out and small tentserected. Rings of sentries and outposts guarded the sea of men. Every hilltophad lookouts watching all the approaches.The tents cast long shadows across the trampled wheat. Already a haze of smokehung over the valley from all the cook fires. Nicci could see that one of thenearby olive groves had been stripped of its valuable fruit trees to be used forfirewood. Men cooked for themselves or in small groups—simple things, camp stew,rice and beans, bannock, and fritters. The aroma of the burning wood and cookingmingled uneasily with the smell of all the animals, men, and manure.Her escort kept a tight formation around her as they trotted into the camp alongwhat was quickly becoming a temporary road among the seething throng. Nicci hadexpected to see them in a raucous state, drinking and celebrating on the eve ofa great battle. They were not. They were going about the business of preparingin earnest for the job ahead; sharpening weapons, working on saddles and othergear, tending to horses. Lances and spears were already sharpened and neatlystacked all over the camp. Blacksmiths at a traveling forge worked with tongsand hammers as helpers feverishly pumped bellows. Farriers shod horses whileother men mended leather equipment. Cavalry horses were being fed, cared for,and groomed.This was not a typical Imperial Order camp where chaos ruled. The army to thenorth was almost unimaginably vast. Many parts of it were little more than anunruly mob that was periodically unleashed on helpless civilians and allowed toplunder at will. This force, on the other hand, was much smaller, consisting ofless than twenty thousand men. This was the camp of a well-honed war machine.In the main army camp of the Imperial Order, a woman with her breasts exposed asNicci’s were would already have been dragged from her horse by a rabble andraped. These men were no less lecherous, but they were far better disciplined.These were not just any soldiers sent to do some dirty work; these wereexperienced, dedicated, handpicked troops sent to vent the emperor’s rage at theinsult of his home city rejecting everything for which he stood.Nicci felt a shiver of dread at again being among such men. These were the creamof the Order’s crop. These were men who gleefully killed all those who opposedthem. These were brutes who reveled in violence to further their beliefs. Thesewere the embodiment of the term “bloodthirsty.” These men were the enforcers ofthe Order’s doctrines.As Nicci and her escort rode through the camp, the soldiers all ogled her. Everystep of the way, hoots, calls, and cheering followed her. Obscene promises werelaughingly given as she passed. Nothing was left to the imagination of anyone inearshot. She heard herself described in every lewd term she had ever heardbefore, and among Jagang’s men she had heard them all. Now they were alldirected at her.She kept her eyes ahead as she rode, thinking of the way Richard treated her andjust how much such respect meant.Near a grove of cottonwood trees along the bank of a creek running through thevalley, Nicci spotted lambskin tents that were a little larger than the rest.While by no means elaborate accommodations like the tents of Emperor Jagang’sentourage, these were still luxurious by army standards. The small group ofcommand tents sat atop a hillock that afforded the officers the opportunity tolook down on the rest of the camp. Unlike the main army encampment, here therewas no ring of guards protecting the elite forces and officers from the commonsoldiers. Outside the main tent, slabs of meat were being rotated on spits byslaves that always attended the higher ranking officers… or high priests of theFellowship of Order. For a force such as this, only the most loyal slaves wouldhave been brought along.As they slowed to a halt, the man who held the reins to Nicci’s horse tilted hishead, ordering one of his men to go announce them. The man threw his leg overhis horse’s neck and jumped to the ground. With each step, dust lifted from hispants as he strode toward the main tent.Nicci noticed that all around curious men began wandering closer, coming to seethe woman being brought as a gift for their leader. She could hear them laughingand wisecracking among themselves as they leered at her. Their eyes were as coldand frightening as any she had ever seen.What worried her the most, however, was that many of the men held spears or hadarrows nocked in their bows. These were not men who took anything casually. Evenas they drooled at her they were prepared for any kind of threat her appearancemight present.The man sent to announce her was ushered into the main tent by an attendant. Amoment later he reappeared, followed by a tall man in flowing henna-dyed robes.His manner of dress stood out on the drab scene like clotted blood. Despite theheat and humidity the hood of his robe was draped regally over his head, a signof pious authority.He stalked to the edge of the rise, closer to her, and struck an arrogant pose.He took his time looking her over—inspecting the goods.The man holding the reins to her horse bowed in his saddle.“A humble gift from the people of Altur’Rang,” he explained with mockcourtliness.Men far and wide laughed quietly to themselves at that, commenting to oneanother on the specific pleasures Kronos was going to enjoy from his gift.Officers came out of nearby tents to see what was going on.A lustful grin spread across Kronos’s face. “Bring her in. I will have to unwrapthe gift and have a closer look.”The men laughed all the louder. Kronos’s smile widened, pleased that they foundhis wit entertaining.Nicci found the circumstances of her dress to be distracting, but that was therisk. She had judged the risk necessary. These men were brutes and they foundher situation to their liking.Brother Kronos took her in as he waited for her to be conveyed inside. Hisunflinching gaze was riveting. She found herself staring into his dark eyes.Men closed in around her.Nicci knew that she couldn’t allow them to get her off her horse. It had to benow.There were a thousand things she wanted to say to Brother Kronos. She wanted totell him what she thought of him, what she was going to do to him, what Richardwas going to do to all the Imperial Order.A simple death seemed too easy for Kronos. She wanted him to suffer before hedied. She wanted him to know full well what she had in store for him. She wantedhim to feel it, to twist in pain and agony, to beg for mercy, to taste thebitter bile of defeat. She wanted him to suffer for the misery he spread in hiswake. She wanted him to pay the price for everything he had ever done toinnocent people.She wanted him to know that his entire life had been a waste and that it wasabout to end.But she knew that that was not her task. She would risk failure should she evenattempt to accomplish any tiny part of it.Instead, Nicci unceremoniously lifted her fists just a little toward the man asshe willed forth her Han. Fearing to tip Kronos as to what was coming, sherefrained from taking even an extra split second to conjure anything elaborate.She opened the floodgates, using nothing more complex than a blast of airdirected at the man—but it was concentrated beyond anything he would expect evenif he suspected she might be a sorceress.In a blinding instant the late-afternoon camp was lit with a flash of cracklinglight—discharges created by the intense heat generated by a focused compressionof air. Threads of light lashed around the convergent release of force.Since even a slight slip could conceivably give him an opportunity to strike outbefore he died, Nicci didn’t even risk the satisfaction of smiling as theiron-hard spike of air shot for his head.Before Brother Kronos ever realized that something was happening, Nicci’s suddenrelease of power blew a fist-sized hole through the center of his forehead.Blood and brain matter sprayed the lambskin wall of the tent behind him. Hedropped like a sack of sand, his life already long gone. He never had a chanceto respond in kind.Nicci used a shard of power to at last sever the ropes binding her wrists. Theyhissed from the sting of heat as they were cut and then dropped away.Without pause she fed a flow of her Han into a focused line of power that sheswept around her like a blade wielded by a master swordsman. The officer who hadled her horse and leered at her the whole way grunted as that hot edge rippedthrough him, cutting him in two below the rib cage. His mouth opened but noscream escaped as his upper half tumbled toward the ground, landing with a hardthud.With a wet thump the second man could do no more than gasp as he was hit by thesame power and torn in two. Coiled ropes of his intestines disgorged across hishorse’s neck. Nicci twisted in her saddle as she whipped the conjured bladearound in an arc. With frightening speed and a flash that lit the shimmeringleaves of the nearby cottonwood trees, the edge of deadly power sizzled as itripped through the air. Before anyone could begin to react, it cut down all themen on horses around her as they still sat in their saddles.The air filled with the stench of burned flesh, blood, and the contents ofruptured viscera. Horses reared up or bucked, trying to rid themselves of thedisembodied legs. Ordinarily, warhorses were used to the confusion of intensebattle—but that was in large part because they had familiar riders to controland direct them. Now they were on their own and they were spooked. A number ofmen rushing in were knocked down and trampled by the panicked horses, furtheradding to the disorder.As pandemonium began to erupt all around her, as men charged in toward her,Nicci gathered her inner will, preparing to unleash an onslaught of witheringdestruction.Just as she was initiating the launch of that deadly assault, she pitchedforward unexpectedly. At the same time she felt the stunning pain of somethingheavy clouting her across her back. It was propelled by such staggering forcethat it drove her breath out with a cry. She saw flying past her the shatteredpieces of a heavy lance that had been swung like a club.Dazed, Nicci realized that she had just hit the ground face-first. She trieddesperately to gather her senses. Her face felt oddly numb. She tasted warmblood. She saw strings of it dripping from her chin as she pushed herself up onwobbly arms.She realized then, when she couldn’t pull in a breath, that the wind had beenviolently knocked out of her. She frantically tried again, but, despite herdesperate efforts, she couldn’t draw a breath.The world swam in dizzy disarray around her. Sa’din was above her, dancing aboutbut unable to move away. Even though Nicci feared that the horse mightaccidentally step on her, she couldn’t make herself move out of the way. Men allaround finally muscled the horse aside. Other men dropped to their knees besideher. A knee in her back flattened her to the ground again. Powerful handsgripped her arms, her legs, her hair, holding her down—as if she could get up onher own.These men apparently feared that if she got up she might conjure her power, asif the gifted needed to be standing and they had but to keep her on the groundto be safe. But the gifted did need to have their wits about them if they wereto call upon their power, and she didn’t.Some of the men pulled her over on her back. A boot at her throat kept herpinned to the ground. Weapons all around pointed down at her.And then a terrible thought came to her… dark eyes.The wizard she had just killed had dark eyes.Kronos didn’t have dark eyes.Kronos was supposed to have blue eyes.She was having difficulty sorting it all out in her mind. She had killed thehigh priest. It didn’t make sense.Unless there had been more than one Brother.The men holding her down backed away.Grim blue eyes glared down at her. It was a man wearing long robes. The hood waspulled up. A high priest.“Well, sorceress, you have just managed to kill Brother Byron, a loyal servantto the Fellowship of Order.”She could tell by his tone that he had not yet begun to voice his buildinganger.Through the shock, Nicci still couldn’t draw a breath. The pain in her backradiated out in paralyzing waves. She wondered if the man who had clubbed herhad broken her ribs. She wondered if her back was broken. She supposed it didn’tmatter, now.“Allow me to introduce myself,” the red-faced man above her said. He pushed thehood of his robes back. “I am Brother Kronos. You belong to me, now. I intend tomake you pay a long and painful price for the murder of a good man who was onlydoing the Creator’s noble work.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27Nicci couldn’t, simply couldn’t, pull in a breath to save her life, much less tosay anything. The pain of not being able to breathe cloaked her in a tightshroud of panic that prevented her from thinking. The distress of needing airand not being able to get it grew more terrifying with every passing second.She didn’t know what to do.She remembered when Richard had been shot with the arrow and he couldn’tbreathe. She remembered how his skin had turned ashen, and then had begunturning blue. She had been so afraid seeing him not being able to breathe. Nowshe couldn’t.Kronos’s smile was as humorless and wicked as any she had ever seen, but itseemed not to matter to her.“Quite an accomplishment—for a sorceress—killing a wizard. But then, you onlyaccomplished such a feat by treachery, so it was no real accomplishment afterall. It was nothing more than simple, underhanded deceit.”He didn’t know. Nicci realized that he still didn’t know who she was… or whatshe was. She was no mere sorceress.But she needed a breath to be anything.Her vision was narrowing to a black tunnel with the face of the wizard Kronostwisting into rage at the far end. She tried with all her might to pull abreath. It felt like her body had forgotten how to breathe.It surprised her that the lack of air made her ribs throb and ache. She wouldn’thave expected that. Despite her fading, frantic effort to get air into herlungs, the life-giving breath simply would not come into her. She could onlyassume that whoever had clubbed her had done some kind of serious damage, andshe would never again draw a life-giving breath.And then Kronos gritted his teeth and seized her breast in a vicious, viselikegrip spiked with thorns of magic intended to inflict excruciating torment.The sudden sharp shock of pain made her gasp a breath before she realized shewas doing it.The air felt hot with life as it flooded into her lungs. Without consciousthought, she instinctively struck out with her Han at the cause of the piercingpain.Kronos cried out and staggered back, cradling the hand that had been on her anddealing out his revenge. Blood ran down his wrist and under the sleeve of hisrobe.Although she had been able to get him to release her, and even to injure him,she was still too disoriented to muster the force necessary to get past theformidable defenses of a wizard in order to kill him. She panted, gulping air,even though each breath hurt. She knew, though, that it hurt far more not to beable to get a breath.“You filthy bitch!” he yelled. “How dare you use your power against me! Youcannot hope to match me with the gift. You will soon enough learn your place.”His face flushed red with anger. With a thin thread of her Han Nicci could sensethe powerful shields the man had erected before himself. Before he had, though,she had seared the flesh off his fingers. He held the trembling hand to hisbreast. She knew full well that his intent was to extract prolonged and gruesomeretribution.He ranted at her, cursing and calling her names, telling her what he intended todo with her and what would become of her once he was finished with her. Thegrins of the men watching widened at hearing the nature of those plans.He thought she was a sorceress and that he could overpower her gift with his. Hedid not know that she was far more; she had become a Sister of the Dark. Even ifhe knew that much, Kronos might not have understood, as few people did, the fulland terrible meaning behind that appellation. A Sister of the Dark wielded notonly her own gift, but the Han of a wizard as well; his gift was taken before hepassed through the veil into death.As if the combined gift of a sorceress and wizard was not formidable enough,added into that powerful mix was Subtractive Magic gained while the veil wasparted at the instant of the donor wizard’s death. His own Han acted as theconduit, and she held within herself that power as the Subtractive essenceslipped through the veil.There were few people who could command Subtractive Magic: Richard by birth, andthe Sisters of the Dark by contrivance. All of the Sisters of the Dark were nowcaptives of Jagang except for Nicci and four others—three of Richard’s formerteachers from the Palace of the Prophets and their leader, Sister Ulicia.Kronos shook his bloody fist at Nicci. “The people of Altur’Rang are traitors!They have defiled a holy place! In turning away from the ways of the Order theyhave turned away from the Creator Himself. Through our hands, the Creator willhave His revenge and smite these sinful people. We will cleanse Altur’Rang notjust of their flesh and bone but of their unenlightened ways! The Imperial Orderwill once again rule Altur’Rang and from there Jagang the Just will rule theworld under the rightful ways of the Creator!”Nicci almost laughed. Kronos had no idea that he was speaking to the person whohad given Jagang the title of “Jagang the Just.” She had told the emperor thatsuch pronouncements of justice under his rule would win over a great number ofpeople without having to fight them. He had been willing to battle them all; shealone had been able to make him see that it was to his benefit to have themrally to his side of their own free will. She told Jagang that the name she hadgiven him would bring the people to him.She had been all too right. Many people equated intentions with the actual deed.The title she had given Jagang was now widely believed by people who didn’t knowmuch at all about him or the Order. It never failed to amaze her how simplysaying something, no matter how untrue, was all it took to convince a largenumber of people of what you wanted them to believe. She supposed that it waseasier for them to let someone else do their thinking for them.Kronos’s tirade had bought her time to recover. With her strength returning,Nicci couldn’t afford to wait another instant.She straightened her arm, pointing her fist up toward him. She wanted to drawher force out the length of her arm to let it build and converge at a point justbeyond her fist. While it wasn’t at all necessary, she wanted to do it that waysimply because it pleased her to let Kronos see her overt threat.Confident in his ability, and the shields of his power, her hostile posture onlyserved to further enrage him. “How dare you threaten—”She released a tight bolt of Additive and Subtractive Magic laced together in afearsome cord of destruction that arced through the wizard’s shields likelightning through paper and blew a mellon-sized hole right through the center ofhis chest.Kronos’s eyes snapped wide. His mouth hung open in mute shock as his mindregistered the irredeemable.Through that hole, Nicci could see the sky. Almost instantly the internalpressure forced what remained of his surrounding organs into the void and thenout the opening as Kronos’s mortally wounded body toppled back.The man hadn’t known that his power was no match for hers. He could only conjureshields of Additive Magic. Such shields were of limited use against SubtractiveMagic.All around her weapons were already being lifted. Powerful muscles drewbowstrings to cheeks. Arms with spears cocked back, the iron tips all pointingat her along with swords, axes, and pikes.Without pause Nicci unleased a blast of opposing magic twined together in ashattering ignition that in ruinous fury leveled the officers’ tents and blastedthrough the men on the knoll. The devastating concussion radiated outward in acircle at breathtaking speed, stripping flesh from bone. The ground was mademuddy by the sudden deluge of blood.The heat that had been focused into the blast was so intense that nearby treeserupted in flame. The clothes of men in the surrounding camp who had beenrushing to meet the threat also caught fire. The flesh of those a little closerignited. Men closer yet were ripped apart by the thunderous discharge of Nicci’spower. The force of what she had unleashed dissipated with distance and menfarther away were only sent sprawling.Such an extreme effort was risky because it was so draining, but it had thedesired effect. In an instant the situation had changed from arrogant brutesgloating over a captive woman to confusion and panic.Fearing to lose the initiative, she focused intense heat into the trunks oftrees along the creek bank behind the men. It was a method of getting a largereturn for a small investment of power. Superheated sap instantly boiled intosteam and the massive cottonwood trunks exploded in thunderous blasts, sendingheavy sections of splintered wood spiraling though the crowds of men, cuttingthem down by the dozens.Nicci swiftly conjured a liquid fire and sent the inferno spilling out acrossthe field and into the confusion, igniting men, horses, and equipment in theterrible fury of roaring flames. The screams of man and beast melted togetherinto one, long, terrible cry. The air smelled of oily smoke as well as burninghair and flesh.At last, men were no longer charging in at her. In the brief break, Niccistruggled to get up from the blood-soaked ground. She stumbled through thecarnage. Sa’din raced forward through the thick haze and nudged her with hishead, helping her to find her balance. She threw an arm over his neck, relievedthat she had succeeded in directing her power around him and that he was allright.She finally seized the reins and, grunting with effort, managed to pull herselfup on the horse before men could spear him, or slash her, or send arrows atthem. She spun Sa’din around, all the time casting boiling gouts of fire outamong the men as they again began rushing in at her. As they caught on fire,they stumbled blindly, shrieking, flailing, crashing into other men or intotents, spreading the deadly conflagration.A man on one of the big warhorses suddenly galloped out of the smoke. Thesoldier raised his sword as he screamed a battle cry. Before Nicci could doanything, Sa’din bellowed in rage and snapped, ripping the war-horse’s ear off.The wounded horse screamed in terror and pain as it spun and bucked. The soldierwas sent flying into the burning bodies.Nicci directed a web of power at men rushing in at her, each in turn—just for aninstant, but long enough to stop their hearts. They stumbled, clutching theirchests. In a way, it was more frightening for men to see their comrades gasp anddrop from a mysterious cause than it was to see them rent by violence. FromNicci’s point of view it was just as effective and it didn’t take as much of herstrength; even though it required specific targeting, stopping a heart waseasier than conjuring flames or lightning. With so many men all around her andall rushing in at her, she knew she was going to need all her strength if shehoped to get out of the camp alive.While the men in the immediate area knew what was happening, as of yet those inthe outlying areas of the camp weren’t fully aware of what was specificallygoing on, although they now knew they were under some sort of attack. Being welltrained, they all rallied.From all directions, arrows zipped through the air. Spears began flying past. Anarrow flicked through Nicci’s hair. Another clipped her shoulder just enough tocut her. Nicci drummed her heels against Sa’din’s ribs and lay forward over hiswhithers. She was astonished at the power with which the horse leaped away. Hefearlessly galloped right through men rushing in at them. The stallion’s hoovesmade a sickening sound as they struck bone. Men tumbled away. Sa’din jumped overtents and fires. The air was alive with terrible screams. As she raced throughthe camp Nicci took every opportunity to inflict yet more death and destruction.But from behind her, a swelling, angry roar began to lift from thousands uponthousands of men all the way across the valley. The power of it, the ferocity,was frightening.Nicci vividly recalled Richard’s warning that all it would take was one luckyarrow. Now there were thousands. Nicci diverted her power from attacking toshielding her and her horse.As Sa’din carried her back through the men, horses, wagons, and tents, Nicci letgo of her defenses and again focused a scythe of her gift to slice throughanything living that was close enough. The intensely concentrated and compactededge of air sliced through men as they ran in to intercept her. As her horseleaped some obstacles and dodged others, that deadly edge of her power cut somemen off at the knees and decapitated others. Horses screamed as their legs werecleaved from under them and they crashed to the ground. Shrieks of horror andpain from wounded men followed in her wake. But there were growing cries ofrage.As she charged through the camp, Nicci could see men all around swiftly saddlingtheir horses and mounting up. Spears and lances were snatched from those stackedeverywhere throughout the encampment. Nicci wished she could destroy theweapons, but she had to concentrate just to hold on to Sa’din as he bounded overanything in his way, including an occasional wagon. The horse seemed possessedto get her out of the danger as swiftly as possible. Even so, men in gatheringnumbers were taking up the chase, whether on horse or foot.As she cleared the last of the tents, Nicci looked back over her shoulder. Theplace was in an uproar. Flames still shot skyward. Billowing clouds of oilyblack smoke rose in several places. She didn’t have any idea how many men shehad killed, but there were thousands of them coming after her. The pounding shewas taking atop a galloping horse was making her back hurt something fierce.At least she had eliminated Kronos. They had tried to trick her, but in the endit had cost them a second wizard that she hadn’t even known they had with themand would have been terrible trouble for the defenders back at Altur’Rang. Ithad turned out to be a bit of good fortune.As long as they didn’t have three wizards."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28As Nicci crested a hill, the first glimpse of the vast city in the distance wasa beautiful sight. A quick glance over her shoulder revealed the thunderingcavalry right on her heels. Nicci was able to see the raised swords, axes,spears, and lances glinting in the light of the setting sun like steel quills ofan immense porcupine. The cloud of dust boiling up behind them blotted out thedarkening eastern sky. The bloodthirsty battle cries were terrifying.And that was only the cavalry. She knew that farther back came the tide of footsoldiers.Even if the sun wouldn’t have been in her eyes, Nicci didn’t think that shecould have spotted anyone in the city. That was as it should be. She wantedpeople, for the most part, to stay hidden. Even so, it was not reassuring tofeel all alone with an angry hornets’ nest chasing her.She had told Victor and Ishaq the route she would try to take when returning sothat they could concentrate their defenses to the best advantage. She hoped theywere ready. There hadn’t been a great deal of time to prepare. They would get nomore, though; time was up.With the city looming closer, Nicci at last spared the effort to snake her rightarm through the sleeve of her dress, then reached back and threaded her left armthrough the other sleeve. Holding the reins in one hand, leaning forward overthe galloping horse’s withers, she at last managed to blindly button her dressback up. She smiled at the small victory.The first small buildings flashed by. Although there had been a cutoff from themain road that would have more quickly gotten her into the confines of the city,Nicci had kept to the main road down out of the hills. Entering Altur’Rang, theroad turned into a broad boulevard, the main east-west thoroughfare. As thebuildings grew closer together, they also rose up higher. In places along theroad trees lined the way. She could see fastened on the bark of those trees thesplit-open, empty skins of cicadas that had molted. It gave Nicci a fleetingmemory of lying in the shelter, in the warmth of Richard’s arm.Sa’din was sweating into a lather and she knew that he had to be tiring, but hedidn’t show any sign of wanting to slow. She had to urge him to ease up just alittle anyway so that the cavalry would get closer to her. She wanted them tobelieve they were catching her. Once a predator chasing prey was closing in theytended to lose sight of everything else. The instinct to chase was as strong insoldiers as it was in wolves. Nicci wanted them to throw caution to the winds asthey ran her down, so she leaned a little to the side, making it look as if shemight be wounded and ready to fall.Running down the center of the road, trailing a ribbon of dust, she began torecognize groups of buildings. She remembered patterns of windows. She saw abutter-colored clapboard building to the left and red shutters to the right thatshe recognized. In the shadows down an alleyway just beyond a row of closelypacked buildings that she knew were homes because of the laundry hanging onlines between them, she spotted some of the men hiding. They all had bows. Sheknew she wasn’t far.She suddenly came upon the three story brick building. In the late light shealmost didn’t recognize it. The spikes lying across the road were covered with athin layer of dirt to hide them from the soldiers. As she galloped past, shespotted men hiding just around the corner, ready to pull up the spikes once shewas by.“Wait until most are past!” she called out to the waiting men just loud enoughfor them to hear but not so loud that those following could hear.She saw one of them nod to her. She hoped they understood. If the spikes werepulled up at the head of the cavalry, bottlenecking them all, then only those inthe lead would be taken out and most of those in the rear would escape injuryand regroup. If that happened then they would have lost their chance to break upthe cavalry. Nicci needed the defenders manning the spikes to allow most to getpast.Nicci looked back over her shoulder to see the big men with their weapons raisedthundering past the brick building. Most cleared the rear of the building, butthen, there was a sudden howling boom as charging warhorses crashed headlonginto the iron spikes. Horses behind weren’t able to stop and violently collidedwith the animals that had been impaled.Riders cried out as they were crushed. Other men tumbled over the heads of theirhorses.From the windows, arrows rained down as soldiers now on foot tried to halt thetail of the cavalry still charging in. Men desperately slowed their mounts. Asthey did they were hit with arrows. Men and horses were hit with a witheringflight of arrows from several directions. Most of the men put an arm up, only tothen realize that they had neglected to take the time to get their shields.As the last of the riders were still crashing into the sudden blockade, Nicciwent right at the fork in the wide road. The cavalry was right on her heels andswept down the street after her.“Wait until half are past!” she yelled at the men hiding around the corner of atall stone wall as she raced past.Again came the hard impacts and terrible noise of animals screaming in pain andterror as they were unexpectedly impaled or torn open. Soldiers cried out asthey were violently unhorsed. Men carrying spears rushed out from behind thebuilding, running the soldiers through before they had a chance to get to theirfeet and fight. Axes, swords, and flails belonging to fallen soldiers were sweptup by men to be used against the Order.Some of the cavalry, fooled a second time, didn’t intend to be fooled again andat a full gallop peeled off from the main column, some taking another street tothe left. Others turned down a narrow road to the right.The riders following her had gone hardly any distance at all and had not had achance to fully consider if they should break off the charge, when Nicci clearedthe third barrier of iron spikes as men yanked them up and jammed posts inplace. The horses just behind her crashed into the spikes. From immediatelybehind came the most terrible noise of the immense weight of horseflesh thuddinginto the lead animals already caught up on the iron spikes and stopped cold intheir tracks. A great cry lifted from the cavalrymen as they were ensnared inthe violent debacle. Almost at the same time the riders who had taken roads tothe right and left suddenly found themselves caught up in the same iron traps.The enemy found themselves in a box canyon of brick and iron, rather than rock.The impact of the horses running at full speed clouting into a tangled pile ofbroken men and animals blocking the main road was ghastly. Flesh pounded againstflesh and bones snapped. Horses screamed in pain. So powerful was the force ofthe impact that it broke the spike wall and blew a hole through the bottleneckof carcasses. Great warhorses, some with their face armor and some without,spilled through the gap, slipping and sliding on the blood and gore of slaincomrades and other animals. In the treacherous footing, some of the horses andriders fell. Others pouring through the gap at a full gallop didn’t haveanywhere else to go and trampled them.Men bristling with spears rushed out of alleyways to the sides and into the pathof the charging cavalry to close the breach in the line. The horses, already inshock from the carnage and terrible destruction of so many of their kind, nowfaced rank upon rank of men running in at them, yelling battle cries, thrustingspears into their sides. The animals squealed with horrific, desperate screamsas they were mercilessly gored. The fallen animals tripped up those stillrunning in an attempt to escape. The evening air sounded as if it were rippingas archers rained down a hail of arrows on cavalrymen struggling to escape thecarnage.Nicci doubted that these Imperial Order troops would have deliberately attackedinto the city, using the cavalry in such a fashion, if they had not been goadedinto it. These kind of horses were not meant for this kind of fighting. Theysimply couldn’t maneuver properly in the close quarters and the cavalrymencouldn’t effectively cut down their opposition. To make matters more difficultfor them, the defenders had too many places to hide for a cavalry charge to betruly effective. The purpose of the cavalry would have been to swiftly crush anyorganized resistance out in the open hoping to stop the Order before theyreached the city, and then to run down anyone who tried to escape the city afterthe troops were sent in. Had the commanders been properly in control of thesituation and their men, Nicci doubted they would have allowed such a crazycavalry charge into the confines of a city. Nicci, of course, had known all thatwhen she went to whack the hornets’ nest.The folly of a cavalry attack into a city was becoming all too apparent. Thekilling was as swift as it was brutal. The gruesome sight of so many horses andmen torn open seemed somehow unreal. The stench of blood was gagging.When she saw a column of the enemy turn down an alleyway to make an escape,Nicci cast her Han outward, using a concentrated spike of force to snap thebones of the lead horse. As the animal’s legs folded under it the horsesfollowing crashed into it at full speed, breaking their legs as the first horserolled under them before they were able to leap up out of the way. A few of thehorses following behind, seeing what was happening and having more time toreact, were able to jump clear. Nicci saw the men at the far end of the narrowalleyway close off their escape route.Nicci cut around the corner to reach the main bottleneck and help prevent anyImperial Order cavalry from escaping the trap. As she rounded the finalbuilding, she encountered a knot of cavalry as they broke through the lines ofmen with spears. Nicci sent a molten ball of flame howling toward the enemy. Itcleared the heads of the defenders and hit the street, splashing liquid fireacross the horses’ flanks. The animals, their hides ablaze, reared up, allowingthe flames to roll up onto the men on their backs.Nicci raced around tightly packed buildings to come up behind the tail end ofthe center trap that had ensnared a large number of the enemy. The men of thecity had already set upon them. For once, the cavalrymen were outnumbered,disorganized, and unable to break free of the onslaught. Men fighting for theirfreedom had a burning determination that the soldiers had not expected toencounter. Their tactics of intimidation and simple slaughter had fallen apart.In the fading light of dusk, Nicci spotted Victor swinging a heavy mace at anyImperial Order head he could find. She urged Sa’din through the slaughter.“Victor!”The man looked up with a murderous scowl. “What!” he cried out over the din ofthe battle, blood dripping from the steel blades of his weapon.Nicci stepped her horse closer. “The soldiers are coming right behind thecavalry. They will be the real test. We don’t dare let them change their mindabout attacking now. Just in case they are having any second thoughts, I’m goingto go give them something irresistible to chase into the city.”Victor flashed her a grim grin. “Good. We will be ready for them.”Once the army poured into Altur’Rang, there was no way they would be able tostay together. They would split up to move down different streets. Once they didthat, each of those groups could be further divided by the defenders. As eachgroup fled or charged, they would face hidden archers and groups of men withspears, to say nothing of the numerous traps.Altur’Rang was huge. As darkness took the city, many of the invaders wouldbecome disoriented and lost. Because of the narrow warren of streets theywouldn’t be able to stay together to present a coordinated attack. They wouldnot be allowed to go where they wished, as they wished, attacking helplesspeople; they would be relentlessly pursued and harried. Each group would getsmaller all the time, both because they would be whittled down while underconstant attack, and because some of their men would try other routes to find away to safety. Nicci had made sure that there was no place of safety in thecity.“There is blood all down the front of you.” Victor called up to her. “Are youall right?”“I got clumsy and fell off my horse. I’m fine. This must end tonight,” shereminded Victor.“In a hurry to go after Richard?”She smiled but didn’t answer his question. “I’d better go whack the hornets’nest. I will bring them on my heels.”He nodded. “We’re ready.”When she spotted three soldiers in the distance trying to make an escape withouttheir horses, Nicci paused to cast a shimmering spell down a narrow twistingstreet. With three rapid thuds, the lance of power slammed through flesh andbone to drop the three.“And Victor,” she said turning back to the man, “there’s one last thing.”“What would that be?”“No one gets away alive. No one.”With the sounds of battle raging behind him, he appraised her eyes for a moment.“I understand. Ishaq will be waiting for you; try to get the hornet’s nest thereas quickly as you can.”Nicci, checking the reins to hold Sa’din in place, nodded. “I will bring thesoldiers right down—”She turned to the sudden whoosh of flame. Great gouts of fire flared up to theeast. She knew that it could mean only one thing.Victor cursed and climbed up to stand on the carcass of a dead war-horse as hecraned his neck, trying to get a view over the rooftops at the thick smokebillowing up into the darkening sky.He cast a suspicious scowl at Nicci. “You failed to get Kronos?”“I got Kronos,” she growled through gritted teeth, “and another wizard. It wouldappear that they have another gifted with them. I guess they came prepared.”Nicci laid the reins over, turning Sa’din toward the distant sounds of screams.“But they didn’t come prepared for Death’s Mistress.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29What do you think it could mean?” Berdine asked.Verna glanced over at the Mord-Sith’s blue eyes. “Ann didn’t say.”The library was dead quiet but for the soft hiss of oil lamps. What with the rowupon row of aisles along with the woodwork and shelves of dark walnut, the lampsand candles did little to illuminate the vast inner sanctuary. Had Verna lit allof the reflector lamps lining the walls and hung on the end caps of shelves, theplace could have been made to be considerably brighter but, for their purpose,she didn’t think it necessary.In a way, Verna felt that if they were to light too many lamps, pull out toomany ancient volumes, disturb the sanctum to a large degree, it might wake theghosts of all the Master Rahls who haunted the place.Heavy beams divided the dark, frame and panel woodwork of deep-set ceilingcoves. Gilded carvings of vines and leaves meandered up columns to the side thatsupported those massive timbers. Strange yet beautiful symbols were painted inrich colors across the faces of the beams. Underfoot were spread luxuriouscarpets woven with elaborate designs in muted colors.And everywhere, around the outer walls in cases behind glassed doors and infreestanding shelves marching through the library in orderly row upon row, werebooks by the thousands. Their leather bindings, mostly in deep colors with atleast some gold or silver leaf on the spines, added a rich, mottled texture tothe place. Verna had rarely seen libraries so grand. The vaults at the Palace ofthe Prophets where she had spent a great deal of time in study had also heldthousands of books, but the place had been utilitarian, serving only thefunction of storing books and providing a practical place to read them. Thispalace revealed a reverence for the books and the knowledge they contained.Knowledge was power, and throughout the ages each Lord Rahl in turn had suchpower at his fingertips. Whether or not he used that knowledge wisely wasanother question. The only problem with such vast amounts of information wouldbe accessing a specific item, or even knowing that it existed in such an immensecollection.Of course, in times long past there would have been scribes who, besides theirwork of making copies of important works, attended the libraries and wereresponsible for specific sections. The master could then easily ask a fewrelevant questions, narrowing the search to the individual dedicated to theparticular area of interest, and be pointed in the right direction. Now, withoutsuch specialists tending the libraries, the priceless information contained inthe countless volumes was considerably more difficult to retrieve. In a way, themagnitude of information became a hinderance to its own purpose, and, like asoldier carrying so many weapons he couldn’t move, nearly useless.The books held in this one library alone represented almost an unimaginableamount of work by countless scholars and a great many prophets. A short strollthrough the isles had revealed works here on history, geography, politics, thenatural world, and prophecy that Verna had never seen before. A person couldspend a lifetime lost in the place, and yet, Berdine had said that the People’sPalace had a number of such libraries, from some that a variety of people wereallowed to visit, to some that no one but the Lord Rahl, and, Verna assumed, hismost trusted confidants, could enter. This library was one of the latter.Berdine had said that because she knew High D’Haran, Darken Rahl had sometimesbrought her into the most private of the libraries to get her opinion ontranslations of obscure passages in ancient texts. As a result, Berdine was in aunique position to know at least something about the wealth of potentiallyhazardous knowledge stored in the palace.Not all prophecy was equally troublesome, though. A lot of it turned out to beincidental and rather harmless. What most people didn’t realize was that a lotof prophetic space was taken up with what amounted to little more than the stuffof gossip.But by no means was all prophecy so congenial or frivolous, and wanderingthrough the titillating trivia of everyday lives tended to lull one intocomplacency and then when you least expected it, dark things came out of thepages to snatch at your soul.While there were volumes that were by and large completely harmless, there wereothers that were, for anyone but the untrained, unsafe from the first words tothe last. This particular library held some of the most dangerous books ofprophecy Verna knew of, books that at the Palace of the Prophets were consideredso volatile that they were not kept in the main vault, but in smaller, heavilyshielded vaults restricted to all but a handful of people at the palace. Thepresence of those books was probably the reason why this particular library wasa very private retreat for Master Rahl alone; Verna seriously doubted that theguards would have allowed her in had a Mord-Sith not been escorting her.Verna could happily spend a great deal of time in such a cozy place, exploringcountless books she had never seen before. Unfortunately, she didn’t have theluxury of time. She idly wondered if Richard had ever even seen what was now hisas the Lord Rahl.Berdine tapped a finger to the blank page in The Glendhill Book of DeviationTheory. “I’m telling you, Prelate, I studied this book with Lord Rahl at theWizard’s Keep in Aydindril.”“So you said.”Verna found it interesting, to say the least, that Richard knew of The GlendhillBook of Deviation Theory. She found it even more curious, considering hisdistaste for prophecy and the fact that this book of prophecies was mostly abouthim, that he’d studied it.There seemed no end to the curious little things that from time to time Vernadiscovered about Richard. Part of his dislike for prophecy, she knew, was hisaversion to riddles: He hated them. She also knew, though, that in large measurehis animus toward prophecy was due to his belief in free will, his belief thathe himself, and not the hand of destiny, made his own life what it was.While enormously complex and with layers of meaning beyond most people’scomprehension, prophecy certainly did revolve around core elements of thepreordained in its nature, and yet Richard had more than once fulfilled prophecywhile at the same time proving it wrong.Verna sourly suspected that, in a perverse way, prophecy had foretold ofRichard’s birth just so that he could come into the world to prove the conceptof prophecy invalid.Richard’s actions had never been easy to predict, even, or perhaps especially,for prophecy. In the beginning Verna had been baffled by the things he would doand was perpetually unable to predict how he would react to situations or whathe might do next. She had come to learn, though, that what she had thought washis confounding switching in a blink from one matter to something completelyunrelated was, simply, at its core, his singular consistency.Most people were not able to remain riveted to a goal with such dedicateddetermination. They tended to become distracted by a variety of other urgentmatters requiring their attention. Richard, as if in a sword fight with a numberof opponents at once, prioritized those ancillary events, holding them inabeyance or dispatching them as need be, while always keeping his goal firmlyfixed in his mind. It sometimes gave people the false impression that he wasskipping from one unrelated thing to another, when in reality he was, to him,innocently dancing across rocks in the river of events around him as he workedhis way steadily toward the opposite bank.At times he was the most wonderful man Verna had ever met. At other times, themost exasperating. She’d long ago lost track of how often she had wanted tostrangle him. Besides being the man born to lead them in the final battle, hehad by force of his own will become their leader, the Lord Rahl, the linchpin ofeverything she had struggled for as a Sister of the Light.Just as prophecy foretold.But not at all in the manner it had so carefully laid out.Perhaps more than anything else he meant to them all, Verna valued Richard as afriend. She ached for him to be happy, the way she had once been happy withWarren. Her time with Warren after they were married and before he had beenkilled had been the most alive she had ever felt. Since then, she felt like theliving dead, alive but not part of life.Verna hoped that some day, maybe when they finally won the struggle against theOrder, that Richard could find someone to love. He loved life so much; he neededsomeone to share that with.She smiled inwardly. From the first day she had met him and put the collararound his neck to take him back to the Palace of the Prophets to be trained touse his gift, her life had felt as if it had been caught up in the whirlpoolthat was Richard. She vividly remembered that snowy day, back at the mudpeople’s village, when she had taken him away. It had been profoundly sad,because it had been against his will, and at the same time it had been amomentous relief after having searched for him for twenty years.To be sure, he had not gone willingly into such benevolent captivity. In fact,two of the Sisters with Verna had died in the effort to make Richard put on thatcollar he so hated.Verna frowned… put on the collar.That was odd. She tried to recall exactly how it was that she had managed to gethim to put the collar around his neck, as it had to be done. Richard hatedcollars—especially after having once been a captive of a Mord-Sith—and yet hehad put it on of his own free will. For some peculiar reason, though, shecouldn’t seem to recall just how she had managed to get him to—“Verna, this is really strange…” The brown leather of Berdine’s outfit creakedas she leaned in a little more, peering intently at the last of the text in theancient volume laid open on the table before her. She carefully turned a page,checking, and then turned it back. She looked up. “I know this book had writingin it before. That writing is now missing.”As Verna watched the candlelight dance in Berdine’s blue eyes, she set asidememories from long ago and returned her full attention to the important mattersat hand.“But it wasn’t this book, now, was it?” When Berdine frowned, Verna went on toexplain. “It may have been the same title, but it wasn’t this very book. Youwere at the Keep; it was a different copy of this book. Yes?”“Well, sure, I guess you’re right that it wasn’t this actual book…” Berdinestraightened and scratched her head of wavy brown hair. “But if it’s the sametitle, then why do you think that the copy at the Wizard’s Keep has all thewriting in it while this one has big sections of the writing missing?”“I didn’t say that the copy there still has all the writing in it. I’m onlysaying that the copy at the Keep, not this one, was the one you studied withRichard. That you recall reading it and not seeing any blank pages doesn’t proveanything because it wasn’t this very same book. But even more importantly, thisbook might in fact be identical in that it contains all the same text, but thescribe who made this duplicate might have simply left blank pages among thattext for any number of reasons.”Berdine looked skeptical. “What reasons?”Verna shrugged. “Sometimes books with incomplete prophecy, such as these here,have blank places left in them to provide room for future prophets to finish theprophecy.”Berdine planted her fists on her hips. “Fine, but answer me one question. When Ilook through this book I recall the things I’m reading. I may not understandmost of it, but I remember it in a general sense, remember reading thesepassages. So why is it that I can’t remember a single thing about the sectionsthat are missing from the book?”“The simple explanation is that you don’t recall anything of the blank sectionsbecause they are simply that, blank places, as I said, that were left in thebook by the person who made the copy.”“No, that’s not what I mean. I mean, I recall the general nature of theprophecies—the length of them. As a gifted person you would be more attuned towhat you’re reading. I wouldn’t. Since I never really understood theseprophecies, I instead remember more of the way they looked. I remember how longthey were. These are no longer complete. I didn’t understand them, and Iremember how long they seemed and how hard it was to make sense of such longprophecies.”“When something is hard to understand it always seems longer than it really is.”“No.” Berdine screwed up her face with conviction. “That’s not it.” She turnedto the last prophecy and tapped the page. “This one here is only a page longfollowed by a number of blank pages. I can’t say that I remember the others sowell, but for some reason I paid more attention to the last one. I’m tellingyou, I remember that this one for sure was a lot longer. I can’t swear to howlong the others were, or how long this one is supposed to be, but I do know forcertain that this last one, at least, was more than a page. It wasn’tincomplete, as this one here is, now. No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem toremember how long it was, or what it said, but I know that it was more than asingle page.”That was the confirmation Verna had been waiting for.“While most of it makes little sense to me,” Berdine went on, “I do rememberthis part, this beginning having to do with all the talk about a forked sourceand the confusing business about going back to a mantic root, and then the‘splitting the horde that vaunts the Creator’s cause’—that part at least soundslike the Imperial Order—but I can’t recall the rest of it that’s blank after ‘aleader’s lost trust.’“I’m not imagining it, Verna, I’m not. I can’t say why I’m so sure that the restof it is missing, but I am. And therein lies what has me so bothered—why is thepart that’s missing from the book missing from my memory?”Verna leaned close and lifted an eyebrow. “Now, that, my dear, is the questionthat I find troubling.”Berdine looked startled. “You mean, you know what I’m talking about? You believeme?”Verna nodded. “I’m afraid so. I didn’t want to plant the seed of suggestion inyour mind. I wanted you to confirm my own suspicions.”“Then this is what Ann was concerned about, what she wanted us to check?”“It is.” Verna shuffled through the disorderly jumble of books on the sturdytable, finally pulling out the one she wanted. “Look here at this book. This isthe one that is perhaps the most troubling to me. Collected Origins is anexceedingly rare prophecy in that it was written entirely in story form. Istudied this book before I left the Palace of the Prophets to search forRichard. I practically knew the story by heart.” Verna fanned through the pages.“The book is now entirely blank and I can’t remember a single thing about itexcept that it had something to do with Richard—exactly what, I have no idea.”Berdine studied Verna’s eyes the way only a Mord-Sith could study someone’seyes. “So this is some kind of trouble, and that trouble is a threat to LordRahl.”Verna let out a deep breath. The flames of several of the closer candlesfluttered as she did so.“I’d be lying if I said otherwise, Berdine. While the missing text doesn’t allhave to do with Richard, it all pertains to a time after his birth. I don’t havea clue as to the nature of the problem, but I admit that it has me greatlyconcerned.”Berdine’s demeanor changed. Usually the woman was the most good-natured of anyof the Mord-Sith that Verna knew. Berdine had a kind of simple, childlike gleeabout the world around her. At times she could be heartwarmingly curious.Despite hardships that had others complaining, Berdine usually wore anunaffected smile.But at the impression of some kind of threat to Richard, she changed in a flashto all business. And now she had turned as suspicious and coldly menacing as anyMord-Sith ever was.“What could be the cause of this?” Berdine demanded. “What does it mean?”Verna closed the book full of blank pages. “I don’t know, Berdine, I reallydon’t. Ann and Nathan are as puzzled as we are—and Nathan is a prophet.”“What does that part about people losing trust in their leader mean?”For an ungifted person, Berdine had managed to single out the most crucial partof a very oblique prophecy.“Well,” Verna said, cautiously framing her answer, “it could mean a number ofthings. It’s hard to tell.”“Maybe hard for me, but not hard for you.”Verna cleared her throat. “I’m not an expert in prophecy, you understand, but Ithink it has something to do with Richard.”“I know that much. Why would this prophecy talk about people losing trust inhim?”“Berdine, prophecy is rarely as straightforward as it seems.” Verna wished thewoman would stop staring at her. “What it seems to say usually has nothing atall to do with the actual event involved in the body of the prophecy.”“Prelate, this prophecy seems to me to suggest that questions of soundness ofmind are going to be the cause of ‘a leader’s lost trust.’ Since this prophecynames the leader as the one opposed to the horde that vaunts the Creator’scause—that would be the Imperial Order—that means it has to be talking aboutLord Rahl. It then follows that Lord Rahl is the leader in whom people will losetrust. It comes after the part about the splitting of the horde, which the Orderhas now done. That makes the threat imminent.”Verna felt sorry for anyone who ever made the unfortunate mistake ofunderestimating Berdine.“It is my experience that prophecy sometimes tends to fret over Richard like adoting grandparent.”“This sounds to me like a specific threat.”Verna folded her hands before herself. “Berdine, you are a very smart woman, soI hope you can understand why it would be a grave mistake for me to argue oreven discuss this prophecy with you. Prophecy is beyond the mind of theungifted. It has little to do with how smart a person is. Prophecy is a creationof the gifted and meant only for those who are gifted in the same way. They arenot even intended for other types of wizards.“Even us Sisters, talented sorceresses though we may be, had to train for yearsbefore we were allowed to even look at prophecy, much less work with it. It isexceedingly dangerous for the untrained to hazard guesses at the meaning ofprophecy. You may recognize the words, but you do not recognize the meaning ofthose words.”“That’s silly. Words are words. They have meaning. That is how we can understandthe world around us. Why would prophecy take words that mean something and usethem for some other unknown meaning?”Verna felt as if she were stepping gingerly through a field of bear traps. “Thatisn’t exactly what I meant by what I said. Words can be used to make peopleunderstand, to explain, to veil, and to interpret the world, but they can alsobe used to explain things that are only speculation. If I foretell that darktimes will come into your life, those words may be true, but it could mean thatyou will suffer a loss that will sadden you, or it could mean that you will bemurdered. Though the words might be true, their exact meaning is not yet known.It would be a grave injustice to use those words as a reason to start killingeveryone around you because the words made you fear you would be murdered.“Wars have started over such misunderstandings about prophecy. People have diedas the result of the untrained hearing what they think are the simple words ofprophecy. That is why the books of prophecy were kept in secure vaults below thePalace of the Prophets.”“These books of prophecy are not kept in vaults.”Verna’s brow drew down as she leaned toward the Mord-Sith. “Perhaps they shouldbe.”“Are you saying that I’m wrong in what I believe this prophecy says?”Verna heaved another sigh. “Right or wrong is impossible to discern in thisinstance. We can’t even begin to intelligently dissect this prophecy becauseit’s incomplete. We have here only the beginning of it and then a number ofblank pages.”“So?”“So, it could be just as you say, that it’s about Richard and people willquestion his judgment and lose faith in him, but maybe the missing text saysthat the issue will be resolved the next day by some other event of consequenceand they will think more of him than they ever had before. Not only can prophecybe forked, meaning that it may be an either-or kind of statement, but the sameprophecy could mean opposite things.”“I don’t see how it can mean opposite things. And how could something happen inthe missing text of this prophecy to change people’s minds?”Verna shrugged as she gazed around the vast, dimly lit library, trying to thinkof an example. “Well, say that they thought his battle plan was crazy. Maybe thearmy officers think it ill advised. That could be something that would result inthis prophecy, in people losing faith in him. Then, say that, despite the adviceof officers, Richard insists and so, despite their doubts and lack of faith, thesoldiers follow his plan as ordered and achieve a victory that they neverthought they could win. Their faith in Richard as their leader would be restoredand they would probably have even more respect for his judgment than they everdid before.“But if the prophecy were to be acted upon without understanding its truemeaning, those actions very well could countermand the rest of the event as itwould have taken place naturally and give the illusion that the prophecy hadbeen fulfilled, but in fact the real and truly prophesied events had beenbypassed by foolishly invoking a misinterpretation of the actual prophecy.”Berdine, watching Verna the whole time, drew her single brown braid through aloose fist. “I guess that could make sense.”“You see, Berdine, why prophecy is so confusing, even for those of us trained init? But to make matters worse, without the whole prophecy we dare not even beginto try understand them or to assign any significance to them. The complete textis indispensable if one is to even begin to try to understand prophecy. Withoutall the text it’s as if prophecy has gone blind. That’s one reason why this isso disturbing.”“One reason?” Berdine looked up again, still running her braid through her fist.“What is the other reason?”“It’s bad enough to be without the text that was previously there, but the causebehind such an unprecedented event—the text of prophecy vanishing—is troublingin the extreme.”“I thought you just said that we shouldn’t jump to conclusions when it comes toprophecy.”Verna cleared her throat, feeling as if one of those bear traps just snappedclosed on her leg. “Well, that’s true, but it’s obvious that something is goingon.”Berdine folded her arms as she pondered the problem. “What do you think could behappening?”Verna shook her head. “I can’t begin to imagine. Such a thing, to my knowledge,has never happened before. I have no idea why it’s happening now.”“But you think it’s trouble that involves Lord Rahl.”Verna gave Berdine a sidelong look. “The simple fact that so much of prophecyinvolves him makes that conclusion impossible to avoid. Richard is born totrouble. He is at the center of it.”Berdine didn’t appear to like that one bit. “That is why he needs us.”“I’ve never argued that he didn’t.”Berdine relaxed, if only a notch, and flicked her braid back over her shoulder.“No, you have not.”“Ann is searching for him. Let’s hope she can find him, and soon. We need him tolead us in the coming battle.”As Verna spoke, Berdine idly pulled a book from one of the glass cases and beganleafing through it. “Lord Rahl is supposed to be magic against magic, not thesteel against steel.”“That is a D’Haran proverb. Prophecy says that he must lead us in the finalbattle.”“I suppose,” Berdine mumbled without looking up as she slowly turned pages.“With part of Jagang’s forces headed south around the mountains, we can onlyhope that Ann will find him in time and bring him to us.”Berdine was puzzling at the book. “What is it that is buried with the bones?”“What?”Berdine was still frowning as she tried to work out something in the book. “Thisbook caught my attention before because it says Fuer Grissa Ost Drauka on thecover. That’s High D’Haran. It means—”“The bringer of death.”Berdine glanced up. “Yes. How did you know?”“There was a widely known prophecy that the Sisters back at the Palace of theProphets used to debate. It had, actually, been hotly debated for centuries. Thefirst day I brought Richard to the palace he declared himself to be the bringerof death and thus named himself to be the one in the prophecy. It caused quite astir among the Sisters, I can tell you. One day, down in the vaults, Warrenshowed Richard the prophecy and Richard himself solved the riddle of it,although to Richard it wasn’t a riddle. He understood it because he had livedportions of the prophecy.”“This book has a lot of blank pages in it.”“No doubt. It sounds like it’s about Richard. There are probably a great numberof books here that are about him.”Berdine was reading again. “This is in High D’Haran. Like I said, I know HighD’Haran. I would have to work at it to be able to translate it more completely,and it would help if there wasn’t so much missing text, but this place isapparently talking about Lord Rahl. It says something like, ‘what he seeks isburied with the bones,’ or maybe even ‘what he seeks is buried bones’—somethinglike that.”Berdine looked up at Verna. “Any idea what that’s about? What it could mean?”“What he seeks is buried bones?” Verna shook her head with regret. “I have noidea. There are probably countless volumes here that have interesting, orpuzzling, or frightening things to say about Richard. As I told you, though,with copy missing, what is there is next to useless.”“I suppose,” Berdine said in disappointment. “What about ‘central sites’?”“Central sites?”“Yes. This books mentions places called ‘central sites.’ “ Berdine stared off asshe considered something to herself. “Central sites. Kolo mentioned somethingabout central sites.”“Kolo?”Berdine nodded. “It’s a journal written ages ago—during the great war. Lord Rahlfound the book at the Wizard’s Keep, in the room with the sliph. The man whokept the journal is named Koloblicin. In High D’Haran the name means ‘strongadvisor.’ Lord Rahl and I call him Kolo, for short.”“What did this Kolo have to say about these places, these central sites? Whatare they?”Berdine turned through the pages of the book she held. “I don’t recall. It wasnothing I understood at the time so I didn’t devote a lot of effort to it. I’dhave to go study it again to refresh my memory.” She squinted in recollection.“It seemed like there was something buried at the places called central sites. Ican’t remember if it said what was buried.”The Mord-Sith stood frozen in her same pose as she studied the little book. “Iwas hoping this might give me a clue.”Verna let out a heavy sigh as she glanced around at the library.“Berdine, I would love to stay and spend time researching all these books. Iwould truly like to know what this library and the others here at the palacecontain, but there are more pressing matters at hand. We need to get back to thearmy and my Sisters.”Verna took a last look around. “Before I go, however, there is one thing here atthe People’s Palace that I would like to check on. Maybe you can help me.”Berdine reluctantly closed the book and replaced it on the shelf. She carefullyclosed the glass door.“All right, Prelate. What is it you want to see?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30Verna paused at hearing the single, long peal of a bell.“What was that?”“Devotion,” Berdine said, stopping to look back at Verna as the deep tollreverberated through the vast marble and granite halls of the People’s Palace.People, no matter where they seemed to be headed, turned and instead movedtoward the broad passageway from where the deep, resonant sound of the bell hadcome. No one looked to be in a hurry, but they all very deliberately walkedtoward the slowly dying sound of the bell.Verna puzzled at Berdine. “What?”“Devotion. You know what a devotion is.”“You mean a devotion to the Lord Rahl? That devotion?”Berdine nodded. “The bell announces that it is time for the devotion.”Pensively, she gazed off in the direction of the hall where people were headed.Many of the gathering crowd were dressed in robes of a variety of muted colors.Verna assumed that white robes with gold or silver banding on them were the markof officials of one sort or another who lived and worked at the palace. Theycertainly had the manner and bearing of officials. Everyone from thoseadministrators to messengers in tunics trimmed in green and carrying leathersatchels with an ornate letter “R” on them, standing for the House of Rahl,continued their casual conversations even as they made their way to theconvergence of wide halls. Other people who worked at any of the countlessvariety of shops were dressed more appropriately for their profession, whetherit was working at leather, silver, pottery, cobbling, or tailoring, providingthe many foods and services, or doing any of the various palace work frommaintenance to cleaning.There were a number of people dressed in the simple clothes of farmers,tradesmen, and merchants, many with their wives and some with children. Likethose Verna had seen in the lower levels within the great plateau atop which satthe People’s Palace or at the markets set up outside, they appeared to bevisitors come to trade or make purchases. Others, though, were dressed in fineryfor their sojourn to the palace. From what Verna had learned from Berdine, therewere rooms that guests could rent if they wished to stay for an extended period.There were, as well, quarters for the many people who lived and worked at thepalace.Most of the people in robes walked calmy, as if this were just another part oftheir day. Those dressed in finery tried to look just as calm and not stare atthe exquisite architecture of the palace, but Verna saw their wide eyeswandering. The simply dressed visitors, as they fell in with the flow of all thepeople making their way toward the fork that would take them to the passagewaywith the bell, openly peered about at everything, at the towering statues of menand women in proud poses carved from variegated stone, at polished two-storyfluted columns soaring past balconies, at the spectacular black granite andhoney-onyx floors.Verna knew that such intricate and precise patterns in the stone floors, setwith such tight grout joints, could have been created only by the most talentedmaster craftsmen in all of the New World. Serving as Prelate at the Palace ofthe Prophets for a time, she had had to deal with the matter of the replacementof a section of beautifully patterned floor that had in the dim past beendamaged by young wizards in training. The precise events leading to the damageand who, exactly, had been the guilty party remained shrouded in oaths not totattle, but the result was that the bit of mischievous magic had in an instanttorn up a long section of exquisitely laid marble floor. While the debris andloose tiles had long since been removed, the floor sat damaged for decades,filled in with serviceable but unsightly limestone, while life at the Palace ofthe Prophets moved on. The palace attitude toward the boys had been one ofindulgence, in part out of a sense of regret for having to hold such young menagainst their will.Verna had always been vexed that the damage had never been fixed—in part becauseby not fixing it represented to her an attitude that had indulged such badbehavior. It had always seemed like she was the only one—except maybe untilRichard came along—who was bothered by seeing such beauty marred. Richardexpected the boys there to take responsibility for their actions. Even though hewas held against his will, he never tolerated such senseless destructivebehavior.Warren saw matters the same way as Richard. Perhaps that was part of the reasonthey had become such fast friends. Warren had always been serious and dedicatedabout everything. After Richard had left the palace, Warren had reminded Vernathat as the new prelate she no longer needed to complain about either thebehavior or the floor; he encouraged her to act on her convictions. So, asPrelate, she both set new rules and set about seeing to the completion of therepairs to the floor.That was when she had come to learn a thing or two about such floors and thatwhile there were any number of men who boldly professed to be master craftsmen,very few actually were. Those who were let their work make clear thedistinction. The former made the task a nightmare, the latter a joy.She remembered how proud Warren had been of her for seeing the task through andfor not accepting anything less than the best. She missed him so much.Verna gazed around at the spectacular palace, at the intricate stone work, andyet such beauty now failed to move her. Since Warren had died everything seemedbland, uninteresting, and unimportant to her. Since Warren had died, life itselfseemed drudgery.Everywhere throughout the palace, wary soldiers patrolled, probably not everrealizing, or even considering, the staggering amount of human imagination,skill, and effort that had gone into the creation of such a place as thePeople’s Palace. Now, they were a part of it, a part of what kept it viable,like thousands of men just like them who for centuries had walked these samehalls and kept them safe.Verna noticed that some of the guards moved through the halls in pairs, whileothers patrolled in larger groups. The muscular young men were dressed in smartuniforms with molded leather shoulder and breast plates and all carried at leasta sword. Many of the soldiers also carried pikes with gleaming metal points.Verna noticed special guards who wore black gloves and carried crossbows slungover their shoulders. The quivers at their belts held red-fletched bolts. Thesoldiers’ eyes were always on the move, watching everything.“I seem to recall Richard mentioning the devotion,” Verna said, “but I didn’tthink that they still did it when the Lord Rahl wasn’t at the palace. Andespecially not since Richard became the Lord Rahl.”Verna hadn’t exactly meant it to be condescending, although she realized aftershe’d said it that it must have sounded that way. It was just that Richard was…well, Richard.Berdine glanced at Verna askance. “He is still the Lord Rahl. We are no lessbonded to him because he is away. The devotion is always done at the palace,whether the Lord Rahl is here or not. And regardless of how you may view him, heis the Lord Rahl by every measure. We have never had a Lord Rahl we respected asmuch as we respect him. That makes the devotion more meaningful, and moreimportant, than it ever was before.”Verna kept her mouth shut, but she cast Berdine a look that came all too easilyto her as a Sister of the Light and now as Prelate. Even though she understoodthe reasons behind it, she was the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light, devotedto seeing the Creator’s will done. As a Sister of the Light, living at thePalace of the Prophets under the spell that slowed their aging, she had seenrulers come and go. The Sisters of the Light never bowed down to any of them.She reminded herself that the Palace of the Prophets was gone. The ImperialOrder now controlled many of the Sisters.Berdine lifted an arm, indicating the palace around them. “The Lord Rahl makesall this possible. He gives us a homeland. He is the magic against magic. Hisrule keeps us safe. While in the past we have had masters who regarded thedevotion as a demonstration of servitude, its origin is actually nothing morethan an act of respect.”Verna’s aggravation seethed just below the surface. This was not some mythicleader Berdine was talking about, some wise old king; it was Richard. As much asVerna respected and valued him, it was still Richard. Woods guide Richard.Swiftly on the heels of her flash of indignation come regret for such unkindthoughts.Richard always fought for what was right. He had valiantly put his life in perilfor his noble beliefs.He was also the one named in prophecy.He was also the Seeker.He was also the Lord Rahl, the bringer of death, who had turned the world upsidedown. Because of Richard, Verna was prelate. She wasn’t sure if that was ablessing or a curse.Richard was also their last hope.“Well, if he doesn’t hurry up and join up with us to lead the D’Haran army inthe final battle there will be none of us left to respect him.”Berdine withdrew her reproachful stare and unexpectedly started toward thepassageway that turned off to the left—the one where the bell had rung. “We arethe steel against steel. Lord Rahl is the magic against magic. If he doesn’tcome to fight with the army it is only because of his duty to protect us allfrom the dark forces of magic.”“Simpleminded gibberish,” Verna muttered to herself as she hurried to catch upwith the Mord-Sith. “Where are you going?” she called after the woman.“To devotion. At the palace everyone goes to devotion.”“Berdine,” Verna growled as she caught Berdine’s arm, “we don’t have time forthis.”“It is devotion. It is part of our bond to Lord Rahl. You would be wise to go todevotion and then maybe you will remember that.”Verna stood frozen in the vast hall, stunned, watching the Mord-Sith stalk off.Verna had a vivid memory of the time that the bond to Richard had been severed.It hadn’t been for long, but in Richard’s absence from the world of life theprotection of the bond to the Lord Rahl had ceased to exist.In that brief window in time, when Richard and the bond were gone from them all,Jagang had stolen into Verna’s dreams to capture her mind. He had capturedWarren as well. It had been beyond horror to have the dream walker in control ofher consciousness, but it had been all the worse to know that Warren was just ashelpless. Jagang’s brutal presence had dominated every aspect of theirexistence, from what they could think, to what they had to do. They no longerhad control of their own will; Jagang’s will was all that mattered. Just thememory of the searing pain that had been sent through that link into her—andinto Warren—unexpectedly brought the sting of tears to Verna’s eyes.She quickly swiped away the tears and hurried after Berdine. Verna had importantthings to do, but she would lose untold time trying to find her way all alone inthe vast interior of the People’s Palace. She needed the Mord-Sith to show herthe way. If Verna had control of her gift it might help her find what shesought, but in the palace her Han was virtually useless. She would just have togo along with Berdine and hope that they could then get back to business withoutthe loss of too much time.The passageway to the left led under an interior bridge with a rail andbalusters made of gray marble struck through with white veins. At a convergenceof four passageways, the hall expanded into a square open to the sky. In thecenter of the square was a square pond with a short, polished speckled graygranite seat all the way around that held the water within. A large pitted rocksat in the water a little off center. Atop the rock sat a bell—apparently theone that had rung calling people to the devotion.Gentle rain had begun to fall in through the open roof. The surface of the ponddanced with the drops. Verna saw that the floor all around the square was gentlysloped toward drains in order to handle any rain. The clay tiles’ helpedreinforce the realization that the square was really out-of-doors.All around the people were going to their knees, bowing down on the clay tilefloor, facing the pond that held the now silent bronze bell.Berdine’s dark discontent evaporated at seeing that Verna was coming with her.She smiled back happily and then did the strangest thing. She reached out andtook Verna’s hand.“Come on, let me take you up by the pond. It has fish.”“Fish?”Berdine’s grin widened. “Yes. I love the squares with fish.”Sure enough, after they wove their way through all the people kneeling down onthe floor and reached the front of the crowd close to the pond, Verna saw thatthere were schools of orange fish meandering through the water. There was hardlyenough room for them to stand among all the people bowed down on the flooraround them.“Aren’t they pretty?” Berdine asked. She had that little-girl air about heragain.Verna glared at the young woman. “They’re fish.”Berdine seemed unfazed and knelt in a spot that opened up as people moved asidefor them. Verna could see by the sidelong glances that everyone had at least ahealthy respect for the Mord-Sith, if not open fear. While none of them appearedfrightened enough to leave, they clearly didn’t want to be where Berdine wantedto be when she wanted to be there. They also seemed more than a little worriedabout who the Mord-Sith was dragging to the devotion, as if it might be arepentant sinner and the lesson might involve bloodshed.Berdine glanced over her shoulder at Verna before leaning forward and placingher hands on the tile floor. The brief look had been an admonition for Verna todo the same. Verna saw that the guards were watching her. This was crazy; shewas the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light, an advisor to Richard and one ofhis close friends.But the guards didn’t know that.Verna knew all too well that her power was diminished to next to nothing in thepalace. This was the ancestral home of the House of Rahl. The entire palace hadbeen built in the shape of a spell-form designed to enhance their power and denyothers theirs.Verna let out a sigh and finally went to her knees, bowing forward on her handslike everyone else. They were close to the pond, but the opening in the roof wasonly about the size of the pond itself, so the rain was confined mostly to thepond and whatever stray rain the gentle breeze carried beyond. The few sprinklesthat reached her actually felt rather refreshing, considering her heated mood.“I’m too old for this,” Verna complained in a whisper to her devotion partner.“Prelate, you are a young, healthy woman,” Berdine chided.Verna let out a sigh. It was no use arguing the foolishness of kneeling on thefloor and saying a devotion to a man she was already devoted to in more waysthan one. But it was more than foolish. It was silly. And a waste of timebesides.“Master Rahl guide us,” the crowd all began together, if not all quite inharmony, as they bowed down and put their foreheads against the floor.“Master Rahl teach us,” they all said, coming more into unison.Berdine, her forehead against the tile, still managed to cast a fiery lookVerna’s way. Verna rolled her eyes and bent forward, placing her foreheadagainst the tile.“Master Rahl protect us,” she muttered, finally joining in with the devotion sheknew and had already once given to Richard himself. “In your light we thrive. Inyour mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only toserve. Our lives are yours.”Verna sourly considered how, if Richard didn’t wisely hurry up and get his hideto the D’Haran army, he wasn’t going to be able to protect anyone.Together, the assembled throng softly chanted the devotion again.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Verna leaned a little toward Berdine and whispered. “How many times are we goingto have to say the devotion?”Berdine, looking very much the Mord-Sith, shot Verna a stern glance. She didn’tsay anything. She didn’t have to. Verna recognized the look She herself hadcountless times used the same look as she peered down her nose at novices whowere misbehaving or young wizards-in-training who were being mulish. Vernaturned her eyes back to the tile under her feeling very much like a novice againas she softly spoke the chant alone with the rest of the people.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”The murmur of the chanted devotion, in the single joined voice of all the peoplegathered in the square, echoed through the cavernous halls.After the look Berdine had given her, Verna thought it best if, for the timebeing, she kept her objections to herself and said the devotion along witheveryone else.She spoke the words softly, thinking about them, and how many times they hadproven true for her, personally. Richard had changed everything about her life.Verna had thought that the most important mission for the Sisters was to put acollar around gifted boys’ necks and train them in the use of their ability.Richard had humbled her for that unthinking belief. He had changed everything,made her rethink everything.If not for Richard, Verna doubted that she would ever have been thrown togetherwith Warren and that their fondness for each other would have blossomed intolove. In that, Richard had given her the greatest thing she had ever had in herlife.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”The cadence of the murmured words of all the voices of the gathered peoplejoined into a reverent sound that swelled until it filled the great hall.Verna felt so all alone, even among the gathered crowd of so many people. Sheached with how much she missed Warren. She had built a wall around her feelingsand had shut herself away from such thoughts, as well as those around her,hoping to be spared the pain that always seemed to lurk just below the surface.Now she was suddenly overwhelmed by the raw misery of how much she missedWarren, how much she loved him. He was the best thing that had ever happened inher entire life—and now he was gone. Tears from her hopeless heartache welledup. She felt so alone.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Verna sucked back a sob as she remembered kissing Warren for the last time as helay dying. That had been the most dreadful moment in her entire life. Despitethe time that had passed, it seemed as if it had happened yesterday. She missedhim so much that it made her bones ache.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Verna spoke the words of the devotion along with everyone else, pouring herfeelings into them, over and over, yet without haste. The murmured chant filledher mind. She wept as she remembered the time she’d had with Warren.She remembered his last words to her: Give me a kiss, Warren had whispered,while I still live. And don’t mourn what ends, but what a good life we’ve had.Kiss me, my love.Pain and longing twisted her insides. Her world was ashes. Nothing seemedworthwhile. She didn’t want to live anymore.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Verna choked back her sobs as she chanted the devotion. It never even occurredto her to wonder if anyone noticed her.It had all been so senseless, a young man of no ability for anything worthwhile,with no interest in any values, of no use to anyone, including himself,murdering Warren just to prove his loyalty to the cause of the Imperial Order,which was, in essence, that people like Warren had no right to live his own lifebut instead should sacrifice themselves for the likes of his murderer.Richard fought to end such madness. Richard fought with everything he hadagainst those who brought such senseless brutality to the world. Richard hadgiven himself over to ending it so that others would not have to lose those theyloved as Verna had lost Warren. Richard truly understood her pain.Verna sank into the rhythm of the chant, allowing it to wash through her.Richard stood for everything she had fought for her whole life - solidity,meaning, purpose. A devotion to such a man, rather than being blasphemy, seemedaltogether right. In a way, because of who Richard was and what he stood for, itwas actually a devotion to life itself rather than some otherworldly goal.Richard had been Warren’s good friend, his first real friend. Richard hadbrought Warren up out of the vaults and into the sunlight, into the world.Warren loved Richard.The soft chant had become a calming refuge.Verna felt a warm shaft of sunlight settling on her as it broke through theclouds. She was bathed in the gentle, golden glow of light. It embraced her withits warmth that seemed to seep down and touch her very soul.Warren would want her to embrace all the precious beauty of life while she hadit.In the loving touch of glowing light she felt peace for the first time in ages.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”The soft flow of the words of the devotion, as she knelt in the warm shaft ofsunlight, filled her with a profound calm, a serene sense of belonging unlikeshe ever had before. She whispered the words, letting them lift away the shardsof pain. As she knelt, her head to the tiles, putting her heart and soul intosaying the words, she felt free of any and every worry; she was suffused withthe simple joy of life, and with reverence for it. As she chanted along witheveryone else, she basked in the tender glow of the sunlight. It felt so warm,so protective. So loving.It almost felt like Warren’s loving embrace.As she chanted along with everyone else, over and over, without pause but forbreath, time slipped by, incidental, inconspicuous, unimportant within the coreof calm she felt.The bell rang out twice, a low, mellow, comforting affirmation that the devotionhad ended, but at the same time would always be there with her.Verna looked up when she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Berdine smilingdown at her. Verna looked around and saw that most of the people were alreadygone. She alone still bowed forward on her hands and knees on the floor beforethe pool. Berdine was kneeling beside her.“Verna, are you all right?”She straightened up on her knees. “Yes… it’s just that it felt so good in thesunlight.”Berdine’s brow twitched. She glanced over at the drops of rain dancing in thewater of the pond.“Verna, it has been raining the whole time.”Verna peered around as she stood. “But… I felt it. I saw the glow of the shaftof light all around me.”Berdine seemed to catch on, then, and put a comforting hand on the small ofVerna’s back. “I understand.”“You do?”Berdine nodded with a compassionate smile. “Going to devotion in a way gives youa chance to consider your life and along with that it brings comfort in manyforms. Maybe one who loves you came to comfort you.”Verna stared at the soft smile on the Mord-Sith’s face. “Has that ever happenedto you?”Berdine swallowed as she nodded. Her eyes brimming with tears said that it had."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31They followed what seemed like a meandering, wandering, convoluted coursethrough the People’s Palace, not because they were lost or because they weretaking their time and picking random routes as they came upon intersections ofhallways, but because there was no straight route.The complex, confusing passage through the labyrinth was necessary because theplace had not been built to accommodate ease of travel through the palace, but,rather, it had been constructed in the explicit shape of a power spell that hadbeen drawn on the face of the ground. Verna found it astonishing to considerthat this was not only a spell-form similar to spells she herself had drawn, butthat she was actually inside the elements that made up the spell. It was anentirely new perspective on conjuring and one on an imposing scale. Since thepower spell for the House of Rahl was still active, she knew that theconfiguration of the foundation would probably have had to have been first drawnin blood… Rahl blood.As the two of them walked down vast halls, Verna could not get over herastonishment at the utter beauty of the place, to say nothing of its size. Shehad seen grand places in the past, but the sheer magnitude of the People’sPalace was staggering. It was less a palace and more of a city in the desolateAzrith Plains.The palace atop the immense plateau was only a part of the vast complex. Theinterior of the plateau was honeycombed with thousands of rooms and passageways,and there were innumerable stairs taking different routes up through thechambers inside. A great number of people sold goods and services in the lowerreaches of the plateau. It was a long and tiring climb up endless flights ofstairs to reach the elaborate palace at the top, so many of the visitors whocame to trade or make purchases did their business in those lower reaches, nevertaking the time to make it up all the way to the palace proper at the top. Evenmore people did business at open-air markets around the base of the plateau.There was a single winding road, interrupted by a drawbridge, along the outsideof the plateau. Even if it weren’t heavily defended it would still be virtuallyimpossible to attack the palace by that road. The interior of the plateauoffered many more ways up—there were even ramps used by horsemen—but there werethousands of troops guarding the inside passages, and, if need be, there werecolossal doors that could be closed, sealing off the plateau and the palacewithin.Black stone statues standing to either side of a wide, white marble hallwaywatched Verna and Berdine as they made their way down the long hall. Torchlightglimmered off the polished black marble of the towering sentinels, making themalmost seem alive. The contrasting color of stone, the black statuary in a whitemarble hall, added a sense of foreboding to the passage.Most of the stairwells they ascended were quite large, some with polished marblebalustrades more than an arm’s length across. Verna found the variety of stonewithin the palace amazing. It seemed like each vast room, each passageway, eachstairwell had its own unique combination of colors. A few of the moreutilitarian or service areas that Berdine took them through were done in bland,beige limestone, while the more important public areas were composed ofstartlingly vivid colors in contrasting patterns that lent an uplifting sense oflife and excitement to the space. Some of the private corridors that served asshortcuts for officials were paneled in highly polished woods illuminated bysilver reflector lamps that added warm light.While some of those private corridors were relatively small, the mainpassageways stood several stories high. Some of the largest—main branches of thespell-form—were lit from above by windows in the roof that let the light streamin. Rows of soaring columns to each side rose to the roof, far above. Balconies,between those fluted pillars, looked down on the people passing below. Inseveral places there were walkways that crossed over Verna’s head. In one spot,she saw two levels of walkways, one above the other.At times they had to go up to some of these higher levels, cross bridges overthe passageways and then descend again into a different branch of hallways, onlyto once more have to go back up in another place. Despite the up and down of theserpentine route, they steadily worked their way higher into the center of thepalace.“Through here,” Berdine said as she reached a pair of mahogany doors.The doors were twice as tall as Verna. Carved in the face of the thick mahoganywere a pair of snakes, one on each door, their tails coiled around brancheshigher up with their bodies hanging down so that the heads were at eye level.Fangs jutted out from gaping jaws, as if the pair were about to strike. The doorhandles, not much lower than the snakes’ heads, were bronze mellowed with apatina that spoke of its age. The handles were life-sized grinning skulls.“Lovely,” Verna muttered.“They are a warning,” Berdine said. “This is meant to command people to stayout.”“Couldn’t they just paint ‘keep out’ on the door?”“Not everyone can read.” Berdine lifted an eyebrow. “Not everyone who can readwill admit to it when caught opening the door. This gives them no excuse tocross the threshold innocently and lets them know that they will have no excusewhen confronted by guards.”From the chill that the sight of the doors gave her, Verna could imagine thatmost anyone would give them a wide berth. Berdine threw her weight into theeffort of pulling open the heavy door on the right.Inside a cozy, carpeted room paneled in the same mahogany as the tall doors, butwithout any more of the carved snakes, four big soldiers stood guard. Theylooked more fearsome than the bronze skulls.The closest soldier casually stepped into their path. “This area is restricted.”Berdine, wearing a dark frown, skirted the man. “Good. See to it that it staysthat way.”Remembering all too well that her power was next to useless in the palace, Vernastayed close on Berdine’s heels. The soldier, apparently not eager to grab theMord-Sith, instead blew a whistle that let out a thin, shrill sound, no doubtused because such a sound would carry up the stairs to other guards on patrol.The two farthest soldiers, however, stepped together to block the pathwaythrough the room.One of the two held up a hand, if politely, commanding them to halt. “I’m sorry,Mistress, but as he said and as you should well know, this is a restrictedarea.”Berdine put one hand on a cocked hip. Her Agiel spun into her other fist. Shegestured with it as she spoke.“Since we both serve the Name cause, I will not kill you where you stand. Bethankful that I’m not wearing red leather today, or I might take the time toteach you some manners. As you should be well aware, Mord-Silh are personalbodyguards to the Lord Rahl himself and we are not restricted from anywhere wechoose to go.”The man nodded. “I’m well aware of that. But I’ve not seen you around the palacefor quite some time—”“I’ve been with Lord Rahl.”He cleared his throat. “Be that as it may, since you’ve been gone the commandergeneral has tightened security in this area.”“Good. As a matter of fact, I am here to see Commander General Trimack aboutthat very subject.”The man bowed his head. “Very well, Mistress. Top of the stairs. Someone will beable to see to your wishes.”When the two guards stepped apart, Berdine flashed an insincere smile and sweptbetween them, Verna in tow.Crossing thick carpets of golds and blues, they came to a stairwell made of arich, flushed, tawny marble webbed with rust-color veins. Verna had never seenstone quite like it. It was strikingly beautiful, with polished vase-shapedbalusters and a wide handrail that was smooth and cool under her fingers.Changing direction at a broad landing, she spotted at the top of the stairs notjust patrolling soldiers, but what appeared to be an entire army waiting forthem. These were not going to be men Berdine would be able lo so easily getpast.“What do you think all the soldiers are doing here?” Verna asked.“Up there and then down a hallway,” Berdine answered in a low voice, “is theGarden of Life. We’ve had trouble there in the past.”That was the very reason Verna wanted to check on things. She could hear ordersbeing passed and the sound of metal jangling as men came running.They were met at the top of the stairs by dozens of the guards, many withweapons drawn. Verna noticed that there were a lot more of the men wearing blackgloves and carrying crossbows. This time, though, the crossbows were cocked andloaded with the red-fletched arrows.“Who’s in charge, here?” Berdine demanded of all the young faces staring at her.“I am,” a more mature man called out as he pushed his way through Uptight ringof soldiers. He had piercing blue eyes, but it was the pale scars on his cheekand jaw that caught Verna’s attention.Berdine’s face brightened at seeing the man. “General Trimack!”Men made way for him as he stepped to the fore. He deliberately took in Vernabefore turning his attention to Berdine. Verna thought she detected theslightest smile.“Welcome back, Mistress Berdine. I haven’t seen you for quite a while.”“Seems like forever. It’s good to be home.” She lifted an introductory hand toVerna. “This is Verna Sauventreen, the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light. Sheis a personal friend of Lord Rahl and in charge of the gifted with the D’Haranforces.”The man bowed his head but kept his cautious gaze on her. “Prelate.”“Verna, this is Commander General Trimack of the First File of the People’sPalace in D’Hara.”“First File?”“When he is at his palace, we are the ring of steel around Lord Rahl himself,Prelate. We fall to a man before harm gets a glance at him.” His eyes shiftedbetween the two of them. “Because of the great distance, we can only sense thatLord Rahl is somewhere far off to the west. Would you happen to know where LordRahl is, exactly? Any idea when he will be back with us?”“There are a number of people wanting to know the answer to that question,General Trimack,” Verna said. “I’m afraid that you will have step to the rear ofa very long line.”The man looked genuinely disappointed. “What of the war? Do you have any news?”Verna nodded. “The Imperial Order has split their forces.”The soldiers glanced knowingly at one another. Trimack’s face hardened withworry as he waited for her to elaborate.“The Order left a sizable part of their force on the other side of themountains, up near Aydindril in the Midlands. We had to leave men and some ofthe gifted on this side of the mountains to guard the passes so the enemy can’tcome over and get into D’Hara. A large contingent of the Order’s best troops arepresently heading back down through the Midlands. We believe that their plan isto take their main force down around the far side of the mountains and theneventually swing around and up to attack D’Hara from the south. We are takingour main army south to meet the enemy.”None of the men said a word. They stood mute, showing no reaction to probablythe most fateful news they had ever faced in their young lives. These wereindeed men of steel.The general wiped a hand across his face, as if all their concern was distilledinto him alone. “So our army coming south is close to the palace, then.”“No. They are still some distance to the north. Armies don’t move rapidly unlessnecessary. Since we don’t have nearly as much distance to cover as the Order,and Jagang moves his troops at a slow pace, we fell it would be better to keepour men healthy and strong, rather than exhaust them on a long race south.Berdine and I rode on ahead because it was urgent that I examine some of thebooks here… on matters to do with magic. As long as I’m here, I thought I shouldcheck on things in the Garden of Life to make certain that everything is safe.”The man took a breath as he drummed his fingers on his weapons bell. “I’d liketo help you, Prelate, but I have orders from three wizards to keep everyone outof there. They were quite specific: no one, not even the gardening staff, is tobe allowed to go in there.”Verna’s brow tightened. “What three wizards?”“First Wizard Zorander, then Lord Rahl himself, and lastly wizard Nathan Rahl.”Nathan. She might have known he would be trying to make himself look importantat the palace, no doubt dramatically playing up the part of being a gifted Rahl,an ancestor to Richard. Verna wondered what other trouble the man had beenmucking about in while he was at the People’s Palace.“Commander General, I am a Sister, and Prelate of the Sisters of the light. I’mfighting on the same side as you.”“Sister,” he said with an accusatorial, squint-eyed glare that only an armyofficer could conjure up. “We had a Sister visit us before. Couple years back.Remember, lads?” He glanced around at the grim faces before turning back toVerna. “Wavy, shoulder-length brown hair, about your size, Prelate. She wasmissing the little finger on her right hand. Maybe you remember her? One of yourSisters, I believe.”“Odette,” Verna confirmed with a nod. “Lord Rahl told me about the trouble youhad with her. She was a fallen Sister, you might say.”“I don’t really care what side of the Creator’s grace she was on the day shevisited us. I only know that she killed almost three hundred men getting intothe Garden of Life. Three hundred! She killed nearly a hundred more getting backout. We were helpless against her.” As his face reddened, his scars stood outall the more. “Do you know what it’s like to see men dying and not be able to doa bloody thing about it? Do you know what it’s like not only to be responsiblefor their lives but to know that your duty is to keep her out of there… and notbe able to do anything to stop the threat’?”Verna’s gaze fell away from the man’s intent blue eyes. “I’m sorry, General. Butshe was fighting against Lord Rahl. I am not. I’m on your side. I’m fighting tostop those like her.”“That may be true enough, but my orders from both Zedd and Lord Rahlhimself—after he killed that vile woman—are that no one else is to be allowed inthere. No one. If you were my own mother I’d not be able to let you go inthere.”Something didn’t make sense to her.Verna cocked her head. “If Sister Odette was able to get in there, and you andyour men couldn’t stop her”—she lifted an eyebrow—”then what makes you think youcan stop me?”“I’d not like it to come to that, but, if need be, this time we have the meansat hand to carry out our orders. We are no longer helpless.”Verna frowned. “What are you talking about?”Commander General Trimack plucked a black glove from his belt and pulled it on,flexing his fingers to draw the snug glove all the way onto his hand. With athumb and first finger of his gloved hand, he carefully lifted a red-fletchedarrow from the rack of six in a quiver at the belt of a soldier beside him. Thesoldier already had one of the bolts nocked in his crossbow, leaving four in thespecial quiver rack.Holding the bolt by the nock end, General Trimack lifted the razor-sharp steelpoint before Verna’s face so that she could see it up close. “This is tippedwith more than steel. It’s tipped with the power to take down those with magic.”“I still don’t know what are you talking about.”“It’s tipped with magic that is said to be able to penetrate any shield thegifted can erect.”Verna reached out and with a finger carefully touched the rear of the shaft.Pain shot up her hand and wrist before she was able to jerk her arm hack.Despite her gift being diminished in the palace, she had no trouble being ableto detect the powerful aura given off by the web of magic that had been spunaround the deadly point. This was indeed a potent weapon. Even with their fullpowers, the gifted would indeed be in trouble if they encountered one of thesearrows coming toward them.“If you have these arrows, then why weren’t you able to stop Sister Odette?”“We didn’t have them back then.”Verna’s frown darkened. “Then where did you get them?”The general smiled with the satisfaction of a man who knew he would not again bedefenseless against a gifted enemy. “When Wizard Rahl was here he asked me aboutour defenses. I told him about the attack by the sorceress and how we werehelpless against her power. He searched the palace and found these weapons.Apparently they were in some safe place where only a wizard could retrieve them.He is the one who supplied my men with the arrows and the crossbows to firethem.”“How good of Wizard Rahl.”“Yes, it was.”The general carefully replaced the bolt in the special quiver rack that kept thearrows separated. She understood, now, why that was necessary. There was notelling how ancient these weapons really were, but Verna suspected that theywere relics from the great war.“Wizard Rahl instructed us on how to handle such dangerous weapons.” He held uphis hand and wiggled his gloved fingers. “Told us that we must always wear thesespecial gloves to handle the arrows.”He removed the glove and tucked it behind his belt with its mate. Verna claspedher hands before herself, taking a deep breath and with it care in how sheframed her words.“General, I have known Nathan Rahl since long before your grandmother was born.He is not always candid about the dangers involved in the things he does. Were Iyou, I would handle those weapons with the utmost care, and treat anything hetold you about them, even casually, as a matter of life and death.”“Are you suggesting he’s reckless?”“No, not deliberately, but he often tends to downplay matters that he finds…inconvenient. Besides that, he is very old and very talented, so sometimes it’seasy for him to forget just how much more he knows about some very arcanesubjects than most other people, or that he can do things with his gift thatthey aren’t able to do, much less comprehend. You might say he’s like an old manwho forgets to tell visitors that his dog bites.”Men up and down the hall exchanged looks. Some of them lifted an elbow or a handaway from the quivers at their belts.General Trimack hooked a thumb around the hilt of the short sword in its sheathat his left hip. “While I take seriously your warning, Prelate, I hope that youwill understand that I also take seriously the lives of the hundreds of my menwho died the last time a Sister showed up and we were defenseless against hermagic. I take seriously the lives of these men here. I don’t want any such thingto happen again.”Verna wet her lips and reminded herself that the man was only doing his job.With the way the palace drained away her Han, she had an uncomfortable empathywith his feeling about being powerless.“I understand,” General Trimack.” She smoothed back a wave of hair. “I, too,know the heavy weight of responsibility for the lives of others. Of course thelives of your men are valuable and anything that will prevent the enemy fromtaking those lives is worthwhile. It is in that vein that I’m advising you to becareful with weapons that are wrought with magic. Such things are not typicallyintended for the unsupervised use of the ungifted.”The man nodded once. “We take your warning seriously.”“Good, then you should also know that what is in that room is dangerous in theextreme. It’s a danger to all of us. It would be in all our interest if, whileI’m here, I just make sure it’s safe.”“Prelate, I understand your concern, but you must understand that my orders gaveme no discretion for exceptions. I simply can’t allow you to go in there on yourword that you are who you say you are, or that your intent is only to help us.What if you were a spy? A traitor? The Keeper himself in the flesh? A sincerelooking woman though you may be, I didn’t get to the rank of commander generalby letting attractive women talk me into things.”Verna was momentarily startled by being called an “attractive woman” in front ofall these people.“But I can personally assure you that no one—no one at all has been in theresince Lord Rahl himself was in there last. Not even Nathan Rahl went in there.Everything in the Garden of Life remains untouched.”“I understand, General.” It would be a long time before she ever made it back tothe palace. There was no telling where Richard was or when he would return. Sherubbed her fingers on her forehead as she considered the quandary. “Tell youwhat, how about if I don’t go in and instead I just stand in the doorway—outsidethe Garden of Life—and look in to make sure the three boxes being held in thereare safe. You can even have a dozen of your men point those deadly arrows at myback.”He chewed his lip as he considered. “Men in front of you, men to the sides, andmen to the back will have you under the points of their arrows and their fingerswill be on the release levers. You can look past my men, through the doorway,and into the Garden of Life, but you may not cross the threshold under penaltyof death.”Verna didn’t actually need to get close enough to touch the boxes. Truth betold, she didn’t really even want to get close to them. All she really wanted todo was to make sure that they were untouched by anyone else. At the same time,she wasn’t exactly comfortable with the idea of all those men being only afinger twitch away from releasing one of those deadly arrows at her. After all,the notion to check on the boxes of Orden had only been an afterthought, beingas she was already at the palace. It wasn’t why she had come to the palace.Still, she was so close.“Bargain struck, General. I only need to see that they are safe so that we allcan sleep a little easier.”“I’m all for sleeping easier.”Berdine and Verna, with a knot of soldiers surrounding them, were led byCommander General Trimack down a broad passageway of polished granite. Columnsspaced against the wall framed great slabs of stone as if they were artwork. ToVerna, they were visual evidence of the Creator’s hand, artwork from the gardenhe had cultivated that was the world of life. The sound of all the men movingalong with them echoed up and down the great hallway as they passed a series ofintersections that were arms of the spell-form all pulling back into the centerthat was the Garden of Life. They at last came to a pair of doors covered incarvings of rolling hills and forests and sheathed in gold.“Beyond is the Garden of Life,” the general told her in a sober tone.As soldiers surrounded her, raising their crossbows, the general began drawingone of the great gold doors open. Some of the men lo the side and rear pointedtheir arrows at her head. The four men who moved in front of her leveled theircrossbow bolts at her heart. She was at least relieved not to have the ones infront of her pointed at her face. She thought the whole thing was silly, but sheknew that these men were dead serious, so she treated it as such.As the gold-clad door was swung wide, Verna, in lockstep with her cadre ofpersonal assassins, shuffled closer to the opening so that she could see. Shehad to crane her neck and finally swish a hand to gently urge one of the men tomove a little to the side so that she could have a clear view into the greatroom.From the rather dimly lit hallway, Verna peered inside and saw that overcastskies lit the place in all its glory through leaded windows high overhead. Shewas astonished to see that all the way up in the center of the People’s Palace,the Garden of Life looked just like… a lush garden.From what she could see, around the outside of the room walkways wound their waythrough flower beds. The ground was littered with petals, a few still-colorfulreds and yellows but most long since dried and shriveled. Beyond the flowersgrew small trees and then beyond them were short, stone, vine-covered walls.Contained within the walls was a variety of shrubs and ornamental plants,although they were in sorry shape from lack of care. Many were gangly with long,new shoots and in need of a trimming. Others were infested with invasive vines.It looked as if General Trimack had been telling the truth that no one, not eventhe gardeners, had been allowed into the place.At the Palace of the Prophets they had had an indoor garden, although on a muchsmaller scale. There had been a system of pipes coming from collection barrelson the roof that kept the garden watered. Recognizing similar pipes in a corner,Verna realized that rainwater collected on the roof provided a constant supplyof water in this place as well or everything in the garden, lit by suchwonderful light, would be dried up and dead.In the center of the expansive room was an area of shaggy lawn that swept aroundalmost into a circle, the grass ring interrupted by a wedge of white stone. Onthat stone sat two short, fluted pedestals that held a slab of smooth granite.Atop the granite altar sat three boxes, their surfaces such an inky black thatit almost surprised her that they didn’t suck the light entirely out of the roomand pull the whole world with it into the eternal darkness of the underworld.Just the sight of such sinister things made her heart feel as if it were comingup in her throat.Verna knew the three boxes as the gateway, and they were exactly what the nameimplied. In this case, they were together a kind of gateway between the world ofthe living and the world of the dead. The gateway was constructed of the magicof both worlds. If that passage between worlds were ever to be undone, the veilwould be breached and the seal would be off the Nameless One… the Keeper of theDead.Because the information had been in highly restricted books, only a few peopleat the Palace of the Prophets were even aware of the gateway by its ancientname, the boxes of Orden. The three boxes worked together, and together theyconstituted the gateway. As far as anyone at the Palace of the Prophets knew,the gateway had been lost for over three thousand years. Everyone thought thatit was gone, vanished, disappeared for good. There had even been speculation forcenturies as to whether or not such a gateway had ever really existed. If such agateway could even exist had been the source of much heated theological debate.The gateway—the boxes of Orden—did exist, and Verna was having trouble takingher eyes off it.It made her heart race to see such vile things. Cold sweat dampened her dress.It was small wonder that three wizards had ordered the general to allow no oneinto the room. Verna reconsidered her opinion of Nathan for equipping the FirstFile with such dangerous weapons.The jeweled covering had been removed, leaving the sinister black of the boxesthemselves, because Darken Rahl had put the boxes in play and had planned to usethe power of Orden to claim mastery over the world of the living. Fortunately,Richard had stopped him.Stealing the boxes now, though, wouldn’t do a thief any good. Extensiveinformation was required to understand how the magic of Orden worked and how thegateway functioned. Part of that information was contained in a book that nolonger existed except in Richard’s mind. That, in fact, had been part of how hehad defeated Darken Rahl.In addition to vast knowledge and information, any thief would also would needto have both Additive and Subtractive Magic in order to use the gateway or toclaim the power of Orden for himself.The real danger would probably be lo any person foolish enough to handle suchtreacherous things. IVerna sighed with relief at seeing the three boxes untouched, right whereRichard had said he’d left them. For now, there was no safer place to keep suchdangerous magic. Someday, maybe Verna could help find a way to destroy thegateway—if such a thing were even possible—but for now it was safe.“Thank you, General Trimack. I’m relieved to see that everything is as it shouldbe.”“And it will stay that way,” he said as he put his weight against the door, Itsoundlessly moved closed. “No one is getting in there except Lord Rahl.”Verna smiled at the man. “Good.” She glanced around at the magnificent palacearound her, the illusion of permanence, peace, and security it exuded. If onlyit were so. “Well, I’m afraid that we need to be on our way. I have to get backto our forces. I will tell General Meiffert that things here at the palace arewell in hand. Let us hope that Lord Rahl will be joining us soon and we can stopthe Imperial Order before they ever reach this place. Prophecy says that if hejoins us for the final battle, we have a chance to crush the Imperial Order, ifnot drive them back to the Old World.”The general gave her a grim nod. “May the good spirits be with you, Prelate.”With Berdine at her side, Verna made her way back out of the restricted area andaway from the Garden of Life. As they once again descended the stairs, she wasrelieved to be on her way back to the army, even if she was worried over theirmission. She realized that since coming to the palace she felt more of a senseof commitment, and more of a sense of connection to what had became the D’Haranempire under Richard. Even more than that, she seemed to care more about life.But if they didn’t find Richard and get him to lead their forces in the battlethey would face when they finally met the Imperial Order, then the mission tostop Jagang’s army was suicide.“Prelate?” Berdine said as she pushed closed the door with a snake carved on it.Verna paused and waited as the woman tapped the palm of her hand on the top ofthe bronze skull door handle.“What is it, Berdine?”“I think I should stay here.”“Stay?” Verna met the Mord-Sith’s gaze. “But why?”“If Ann finds Lord Rahl and takes him to the army, he will have you and a numberof other Mord-Sith who are there to protect him—and he will be where you say heneeds to be. But maybe she won’t find him.”“She must. Richard is also aware of the weight of prophecy and he knows that hemust be there at the final battle. Even if Ann doesn’t find him, I have faiththat he will come to join us.”Berdine shrugged with the difficulty of trying to find the right words. “Maybe.But maybe not. Verna, I’ve spent a lot of time with him. He doesn’t think likethat. Prophecy doesn’t mean as much to him as it does to you.”Verna heaved a sigh. “You said a mouthful, Berdine.”“This is Lord Rahl’s home, even if he never really lived here except as acaptive. Even so, he has come to care about us as his people, and his friends.I’ve spent time with him; I know how much he cares about us and I know that heis aware of how much we all care about him. Maybe he will feel a need to comehome.“If he does, I think I should be here for him. He depends on me to help him withbooks, with translations—at least, I like to believe he does. He makes me feelimportant to him, anyway. I don’t know, I just think I should remain at thepalace in case he comes here. If he does, he will need to know that you aredesperately trying to find him. He will need to know of the impending finalbattle.”“Does your bond tell you where he is?”Berdine gestured west. “Somewhere in that direction, but very distant.”“The general said the same thing. That can only mean that Richard is at least inthe New World again.” Verna found reason to smile. “At long last. That much isgood to know.”“The closer those with the bond are to him, the better able they will be to helpyou find him.”Verna considered it a moment. “Well, I will miss your company, Berdine, but Iguess you must do as you see fit and I have to admit that what you say does makesome sense. The more places we watch for him lo show up, the better our chancesof finding him in time.”“I really think it’s right for me to stay here. Besides, I want to study some ofthe books and try to match up some of what Kolo says. There are a few thingsbothering me. Maybe if I work it out, I can even help Lord Rahl to win thatfinal battle.”Verna nodded with a sad smile. “See me out?”“Of course.”Both turned to the sound of footsteps. It was another Mord-Sith, in red leather.She was blond, and taller than Berdine. Her piercing blue eyes took Verna inwith the kind of measured calculation that betrayed utter, fearless confidence.“Nyda!” Berdine called.The woman smiled with one side of her mouth as she came to a hall. She placed ahand on Berdine’s shoulder, a gesture that Verna recognized as being as close towild jubilation as it got among Mord-Sith, except perhaps for Berdine.Nyda gazed down at Berdine, her eyes drinking her in. “Sister Berdine, it hasbeen a while. D’Hara has been lonely without you. Welcome home.”“It’s good to be home and see your face again.”Nyda’s gaze slid to Verna. Berdine seemed to remember herself.“Sister Nyda, this is Verna, the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light. She is afriend and advisor to Lord Rahl.”“He is on his way here?”“No, unfortunately,” Berdine said.“Are you two sisters, then?” Verna asked.“No,” Berdine said, waving a hand at the notion. “It’s more like you calling theother women of your kind ‘Sister.’ Nyda is an old friend.”Nyda glanced around. “Where is Raina?”Berdine’s face went white at the unexpected encounter with the name. Her voicefell to a whisper. “Raina died.”Nyda’s face was unreadable. “I didn’t know, Berdine. Did she die well, with herAgiel in her hand?”Berdine swallowed as she stared at the floor. “She died of the plague. Shefought it until her final breath… but in the end it took her. She died in LordRahl’s arms.”Verna thought that she could detect that Nyda’s blue eyes were just a littlemore liquid as she gazed at her sister Mord-Sith.“I’m so sorry, Berdine.”Berdine looked up. “Lord Rahl wept as she died.”By the silent but astonished look on Nyda’s face, Verna could see that it wasunheard of for the Lord Rahl to care if a Mord-Sith lived or died. By the lookof wonder that surfaced, such reverence for one of them was homage of profoundproportions.“I have heard such tales about this Lord Rahl. They are really true, then?”Berdine smiled radiantly. “They are true.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32What are you reading that’s so absorbing?” Rikka asked as she used a shoulder topush the thick door closed.Zedd grunted with displeasure before glancing up from the book lying open beforehim. “Blank pages.”Through the round window to his left, he could see the roofs of the city ofAydindril spread out far below. In the golden light of the setting sun the citylooked beautiful, but that appearance was but an illusion. With all the peoplegone, fleeing for their lives before the hordes of invaders, the city was nomore than an empty, lifeless husk, like the shed skin of the cicadas that hadrecently emerged.Rikka leaned toward him over the magnificent, polished desk and tilted her headto see better as she peered down at the book. “It’s not all blank,” sheannounced. “You can’t read something that is blank. You therefore must bereading the writing, not the blank places. You should try to be more accurate inwhat you say, if not more honest.”Zedd’s frown darkened as his gaze rose to meet hers. “Sometimes what isn’t saidis more meaningful than what is said. Did you ever think about that?”“Are you asking me to keep quiet?” She set down a large wooden bowl containinghis dinner. The steam drifting up carried the aroma of onions, garlic,vegetables and succulent meat. It smelled distractingly delicious.“No. Demanding it.”Through the round window to his right, Zedd could see the dark walls of the Keepsoaring high up overhead. Built into the side of the mountain that overlookedAydindril, the Wizard’s Keep was nearly a mountain itself. Like the city, it toowas empty—with the exception of Rikka, Chase, Rachel, and himself. It wouldn’tbe long, though, before there would be more people in the Keep. At last the Keepwould once again have a family living in it. The empty halls would again ringwith laughter and love as they once had when countless people called the Keephome.Rikka contented herself with gazing around at the shelves in the round turretroom. They were tilled with jars and jugs in a variety of shapes, and delicatelycolored glass vessels, some filled with ingredients for spells, and, in onecase, polish for the desk, the ornately carved straight-backed oak chair, thelow chest beside his chair, and the bookcases. Books in a variety of languagesfilled most of the space on the shelves. The corner cases with glassed doorsheld more of the tomes.Rikka folded her arms as she leaned close and studied some of the gilded spines.“Have you actually read all these books?”“Of course,” Zedd muttered. “Many times.”“It must be boring being a wizard,” she said. “You have to do too much readingand thinking. It’s easier to get answers by making people bleed.”Zedd harrumphed. “When a person is in agony they may be eager to talk, but theytend to tell you what they think you want to hear, whether it’s true or not.”She pulled out a volume and thumbed through it before replacing it on the shelf.“That is why we are trained to question people by using the proper methods. Weshow them how very much more painful it is for them when they lie to us. If theyunderstand the profoundly terrible consequences of lying, people will tell thetruth.”Zedd wasn’t really listening to her. He was concentrating on trying to figureout what the fragment of prophecy could mean. Every single possibility he cameup with only served to further ruin his appetite. The steaming bowl sat waiting.He realized that she was probably hanging around, waiting for him to comment ondinner. Maybe she was waiting for a compliment.“So, what’s to eat?”“Stew.”Zedd stretched his neck a bit to glance in the wooden bowl. “Where’s thebiscuits?”“No biscuits. Stew.”“I know, stew. I can see that it’s stew. What I mean is where are the biscuitsto go with the stew?”Rikka shrugged. “I can get you some fresh bread if you’d like.”“It’s stew,” he exclaimed with a scowl. “Stew calls for real biscuits, notbread.”“If I had known you wanted biscuits for dinner I could have made you biscuitsrather than the stew. You should have said something earlier.”“I don’t want biscuits instead of stew,” Zedd growled.“You change your mind a lot when you’re grumpy, don’t you?”Zedd squinted at her with one eye. “You really are talented at torture.”She smiled, turned on a heel, and strode regally out of the small room. Zeddthought that Mord-Sith must strut even when they were alone.He went back to the book, trying to come at the problem from a different angle.He had only had time to read the passage again a couple of times when the latchon the door lifted and Rachel shuffled into the room carrying something in bothhands. She used her foot to push the door closed.“Zedd, you should put your book away, now, and have some supper.”Zedd smiled at the child. She always made him smile. She was infectious thatway.“What have you got there, Rachel?”She reached up and set the tin bowl on the desk, then stretched her arm out asshe pushed it across the desk toward him.“Biscuits.”Flabbergasted, Zedd rose up a little from his chair to lean over and look in thetin bowl.“What are you doing with biscuits?”Rachel’s big eyes blinked at him as if it were the strangest question she hadever heard. “They’re for your supper. Rikka asked me to carry them for her. Shehad her hands full with a bowl of stew for you and one for Chase.”“You shouldn’t help that woman,” Zedd said with a menacing scowl as he sat backdown. “She’s evil.”Rachel giggled. “You’re silly, Zedd. Rikka tells me stories about the stars. Shemakes pictures out of them and then tells a story about each picture.”“Is that so. Well, sounds like a nice thing for her to do.”With the light fading, it was getting hard to read. Zedd cast out a hand,sending a spark of his gift into the dozens of candles in the elaborate ironcandelabrum. The warm light brightened the cozy little room, lighting the finelyfit stone of the walls and the heavy oak beams across the ceiling.Rachel grinned, her eyes glistening with both reflected points of candlelightand with wonder. She liked seeing him light candles. “You have the bestestmagic, Zedd.”Zedd sighed. “I wish you weren’t leaving me, little one. Rikka doesn’tappreciate my candle-lighting trick.”“You will miss me?”“No, not really. I just don’t want to be left alone with Rikka,” he said as heread the last bit again.They will at first contest him before they plot to heal him. What could thatmean?“Maybe you could get Rikka to tell you some stories about the stars.” Rachelbegan looking sad as she came around the desk. “I’ll miss you something awful,Zedd.”Zedd looked up from the book. Rachel held her arms out, wanting a hug. A smileovercame him as he scooped her into his arms. There were few things in life thatfelt as good as a hug from Rachel. She was a devotee of the hug, never puttingless than her full enthusiasm into it.“You have good hugs, Zedd. Richard has good hugs, too.”“Yes he does.”Zedd remembered being in that very room, so long ago, when his own daughter wasabout the same age as Rachel. She, too, would come to see him and want a hug.Now, all that he had left was Richard. Zedd missed him terribly.“I will miss you, little one, but before you know it you will be back here withthe rest of your family and then you will have brothers and sisters to play withinstead of just an old man.” Zedd sat her on his knee. “It will be good to haveall of you at the Wizard’s Keep with me. The Keep will be a joyful place, whatwith life in it again.”“Rikka said that she will never have to cook again once my mother comes here.”Zedd took a sip of lukewarm tea from a pewter mug on the chest beside him. “Didshe now.”Rachel nodded. “And she said that my mother would probably make you brush yourhair.” She held out her hands, wanting to share a drink from his mug. He let hergulp tea.Zedd cocked his head. “Brush my hair?”Rachel nodded with a serious look. “It sticks all out. But I like it.”“Rachel,” Chase said as he ducked in through the round-topped door way, “are youbothering Zedd, again?”Rachel shook her head. “I brought him biscuits. Rikka said he likes his cuitswith his stew and I should bring him a whole bowl full.”Chase planted his fists on his hips. “And how is he supposed to eat his biscuitswith ugly children sitting on his lap? You could scare his appetite right out ofhim.”Rachel giggled as she hopped down.Zedd glanced at the book again. “Are you all packed up?”“Yes,” the big man said. “I want to get an early start. We’ll leave first thingin the morning, if that’s still all right with you.”Zedd dismissed the concern with a wave of his hand as he studied the prophecy.“Yes, yes. The sooner you get your family back here, the better. We’ll all feelbetter having them here where we know they will be safe and you will all betogether.”Chase’s heavy brow drew lower over his intent brown eyes. “Zedd, what’s thematter? What’s wrong?”Zedd looked up with a frown. “Wrong? Nothing. Nothing is wrong.”“He’s just busy reading,” Rachel assured Chase as she hugged his leg and put herhead against his hip.“Zedd,” Chase said in a demanding drawl that said he didn’t believe a word ofit.“What makes you think something is wrong?”“You haven’t eaten a thing.” Chase rested one hand on the wooden handle of along knife at his belt and with the other caressed Rachel’s head of long, goldenblond hair. The man probably had a dozen knives of various sizes strapped aroundhis waist and to his legs. When he left in the morning he would add swords andaxes to the knives. “That can only mean something is wrong.”Zedd popped a biscuit in his mouth. “There,” he mumbled around the mouthful.“Satisfied?”While Zedd chewed the warm biscuit, Chase leaned down and lifted the girl’schin. “Rachel, go to your room and finish getting your things packed up. And Iexpect your knives to be cleaned and sharp as well.”She nodded earnestly. “They will be, Chase.”Rachel had had a hard life for one so young. For reasons that had always madeZedd suspicious, she’d been at the center of a variety of consequentialsituations. When Chase had taken the orphaned girl in to raise as his owndaughter, Zedd himself had admonished the man to teach her to protect herself,to teach her to be like him so that she could defend herself and stay safe.Rachel adored Chase and eagerly learned all the lessons he taught her. With oneof the smaller knives she carried, she could pin a fly to a fence post at tenpaces.“And I want you in bed early so that you will be rested,” Chase told her. “I’mnot carrying you if you’re tired.”Rachel gave him a puzzled look. “You carry me when I tell you I’m not tired.”Chase cast Zedd a pained look before giving her a clearly feigned scowl. “Well,tomorrow you’re just going to have to keep up on your own.”Rachel nodded seriously, unruffled by the man towering over her. “I will.” Shelooked at Zedd. “Will you come and kiss me good night?”“Of course,” Zedd said with a smile of his own. “I’ll be in after a bit to tuckyou in.”He wondered if Rikka would stop by her room to tell her a story. It washeartwarming to think of the Mord-Sith telling a child stories about picturesmade by the stars in the sky. Rachel seemed to have that effect on everyone.Chase watched through the doorway as his daughter raced off down the broadrampart. Zedd had been gratified at the way she had taken to the Wizard’s Keep.In short order she had made it hers and was happily skipping through halls thatwere thousands of years old. She minded well and never strayed from the areasZedd had warned her about. She was a child who understood danger. Out on therampart, she looked completely al ease as she paused momentarily to gaze througha crenellation down at the city below before racing off again. It seemed to Zedda wonder that such spindly legs could carry the child so swiftly.After Chase was sure that she was safely on her way, he closed the heavy oakdoor and stepped closer to the desk. His size made the cozy room, a room thatZedd had always thought quite comfortable, seem rather cramped.“Now, what’s the problem?”The man wasn’t going to be satisfied until he knew more. Zed sighed and used afinger lo spin the book around for the boundary warden lo read.“Take a look. You tell me.”Chase glanced at the ancient book. He lifted a page to each side and brieflytook a look before setting each page back down.“Like I said, what’s the problem? It doesn’t look like there is much here toworry about.”Zedd arched an eyebrow. “That’s the problem.”“What do you mean?”“It’s a book of prophecy. It’s supposed to have writing in it—prophecy. Youcan’t have a book with no writing and have it still be a proper book, now canyou? The writing is gone.”“Gone?” Chase scratched a graying temple. “That doesn’t make any sense. How canwriting be gone? It’s not like someone could steal the words right off thepage.”That was an interesting way to look at it—that someone had stolen the wordsright off the page. Having been a boundary warden most of his life—until theboundary came down a few years back—Chase was the kind of man who would suspecttheft before anything else. Zedd hadn’t considered that possibility. His mindwas already rushing down the unexplored dark alley of deliberation.“I don’t know how the words could be gone,” he confided as he took a sip of tea.“What is the prophecy about?” Chase asked.“This happens to be a book of prophecy mostly about Richard.”Chase looked completely calm, which of course meant that he was anything but.“Are you certain it used to have writing in it?” he asked. “If it’s old, maybeyou just forgot that it had blank pages. After all, when you read a book youtend to recall the writing, not the blank pages.”“True enough.” He set the pewter mug aside. “I can’t swear for certain that Iremember it having writing in it, but I just don’t believe it was ever mostlyblank. Now it is.”Chase’s expression didn’t betray his feelings as he considered the mystery.“Well, I admit that it does sound strange… but is it really a problem? Richardnever was one for prophecy; he wouldn’t have heeded them anyway.”Zedd rose up and stabbed a finger at the book, tapping insistently. “Chase, thisbook has been here in the Keep for thousands of years. For thousands of yearsit’s had writing prophecy in it. I’m sure of it. Now it’s suddenly blank. Doesthat sound trivial to you?”Chase shrugged as he hooked his thumbs in his back pockets. “I don’t know, Zedd.I’m no expert in such things. I think the day that you have to come to me foranswers about books of prophecy is the day you’re in big trouble. You’re thewizard, you tell me.”Zedd put his weight on his hands as he leaned toward the man.“I can’t recall anything that used to be in this book. I can’t recall anythingabout the blank places in all the other books of prophecy that have missingtext.”Chase’s expression turned grim. “There are others with blank places’?”Zedd nodded as he smoothed back his hair. He gazed in the darkening window,trying to see himself reflected, but he couldn’t, yet—it was still too lightoutside.“Does my hair need to be brushed?” He looked back at Chase. “Does it stick outtoo much?”Chase cocked his head. “What?”“Never mind,” Zedd muttered with a dismissive wave of his hand. “The point is,I’ve discovered blank places in a number of books of prophecy and I’m baffled byit.”Chase shifted his weight and folded his arms. His brow bunched, He was beginningto look seriously concerned, which on Chase meant that he looked like he thoughthe might need to slaughter large numbers of people.“Maybe I’d better stay for now. We don’t have to leave tomorrow. We can waituntil you find out if there is some sort of trouble at hand.”Zedd sighed, beginning to wish that he wouldn’t have mentioned any thing. Thiswasn’t really a problem for Chase. Zedd shouldn’t have gotten the man all workedup over something he wouldn’t understand or could do anything about. It was justthat it was so blasted odd.“That isn’t necessary. This kind of trouble isn’t likely to need to have youstrangle it into submission. It’s an entirely different kind of problem. This isbook trouble. I don’t want to burden you with worry. It’s my area and I’m sureI’ll figure it out sooner or later. I only wondered what you might think of sucha thing. Sometimes it helps to have a fresh view.”Chase waggled a finger over the book. “Well, what does that last part mean? Thatfirst contest him before they plot to heal him part? You said it was prophecyabout Richard. That sounds like trouble—like someone In going to plot againsthim.”“No, not necessarily.” Zedd wiped a hand across his mouth as he tried to thinkof a way to explain it. “The word plot in prophecy often means nothing moresinister than to ‘lay out a plan.’ Like plotting a course of action, you mightsay. In this case, the passage was talking about those who are his closestadvisors, his allies, so when it talks about plotting to heal him, it mostlikely means that they must first convince him that he needs their help and thenonce they are able to convince him, these allies—that would most likely be someof us—are going to set about planning a way to heal him.”“Heal him from what?”“It doesn’t say.”“So then it isn’t serious.”Zedd gave the boundary warden a meaningful look. “I believe that may be the partthat is blank.”“Then it is serious. Richard is in trouble. He needs help. Maybe he’s hurt.”Zedd shook his head unhappily. “In my experience prophecy is rarely so overt.”“But that could be the case.”Zedd appraised the man for a moment. “We’re a long way from needing to dream upthings to worry about. In addition, the chronology of prophecy is alwaystroublesome. For all I know, the part we’re discussing could have alreadyhappened. It could, for instance, be talking about a time Richard had a fever asa child and I had to find the proper herbs to heal him.”“Then it just as well could be past history.”Zedd turned up his palms in frustration. “It could be. Without the missingtext—or knowing a lot more about prophecy than I do—it’s probably impossible toput this in the context of his life.”Chase nodded but then stepped out of the way as the door opened and Rikka sweptinto the room. She reached out to take the bowls, but paused when she saw theywere still full.“What’s the matter? Why haven’t you eaten?” When Zedd waved a hand as if tryingto swish the issue away, she looked over her shoulder at Chase. “Is he sick? Ithought he would have scraped the bowl clean by now and licked the smell off theceiling. Maybe we had better think of a way to make him eat.”“See what I mean about plotting?” Zedd said to Chase. “It could be no moreserious than that.”Rikka surveyed Zedd’s face for a moment, as if checking for any overt signs ofinsanity, then turned her attention to Chase. “What is he jabbering about?”“Something about books,” Chase told her.She turned a growing glare on Zedd. “Well, after all the trouble I went tofixing you this meal, you are going to sit right down and eat it. If you don’t,then I’ll feed it to the worms in the midden heap, instead. Then, when you gethungry later and come to me complaining, you will only have yourself to blame.You’ll get no sympathy from me.”Startled, Zedd blinked at her. “What? What did you say?”“I’m going to feed it to the worms if you don’t—”“Bags!” Zedd snapped his fingers. “That’s it!” He held his arms out to her.“Rikka, you’re a genius. I could hug you.”Rikka straightened defiantly. “I prefer to accept your adoration from afar.”Zedd wasn’t listening to her. He rubbed his hands together as he tried toremember exactly where it was that he’d seen the reference. It had been agesago. But how long ago, exactly? And where?“What is it?” Chase asked. “Have you solved the puzzle?”Zedd’s mouth twisted with the effort of thought. “I recall reading a referenceto such an event. I remember seeing some kind of exegesis.”“A what?”“An explanation. An analysis of this issue.”“So then it is some… book thing.”Zedd nodded. “Yes, exactly. I just need to remember where it was that I saw thepassage. It was about worms.”Chase cast a sidelong glance at Rikka before he scratched his head of thick,graying brown hair. “Worms?”Zedd dry-washed his hands as vague recollections ghosted through his mind. Thoseshadowy memories were real, he was sure of it, but despite his frantic effort tograsp them and pull them into the light of consciousness, they remained just outof reach.“Zedd, what are you talking about?” Rikka asked. “What did you say? Worms?”“What? Oh, yes, that’s right. Worms. Prophetic worms. It was some kind ofevaluation, I think, examining if such a thing might be able to erode prophecy.”Chase and Rikka stared at him as if he were crazy but said nothing.Zedd paced from the table to the corner bookcase and back. He pushed the heavyoak chair aside with a foot as he walked back and forth, thinking. He ranthrough a list of places that might have a book that would contain such areference. There were libraries all over the Keep. There were thousands of booksin those libraries—maybe tens of thousands. If he had even seen the reference atthe Wizard’s Keep. He had visited any number of libraries in other places. Therewere a number of archives in the Confessors’ Palace, down in Aydindril. Therewere palaces on Kings Row, also in Aydindril, that contained extensivecollections of books. There were any number of cities that Zedd had visited withrepositories and archives. There were so many books, how was he to remember onehe hadn’t seen for ages—perhaps since he was young?“What, exactly, are you talking about?” Rikka asked when she tired of watchinghim pace. “What explanation are you talking about?”“I’m not sure, yet. It was a long time ago. Had to be. Had to be when I wasyoung. I will remember, I’m sure of it. I just have to give it some thought.Even if it takes all night, I will remember where I saw the passage. I wish Ihad my reason chair,” he muttered as he turned away.Rikka frowned at Chase as she kept an eye on Zedd as he paced. “His what?”“Back in Westland,” Chase said in a low voice, “he had a chair on his porchwhere he would sit and think—where he would reason out problems. That was backwhen everything started, when Darken Rahl came and tried to capture him andRichard. They fled just in time. They came to me and I led them through a gap tothe boundary.”“Seems to me that there are chairs enough around here. He’s practically trippingover that one, there.” Rikka’s mouth twisted with exasperation. “Besides, aperson doesn’t need a chair to make their brain work. At least, if they do, theyhave bigger problems.”“I suppose.” Together with Rikka, Chase watched Zedd pace for a while. Finally,not being one to stand around, he caught the sleeve of Zedd’s robes. “I guessI’d better go see to Rachel while you work out your solution. I want to makesure she gets her things together and gets to bed.”Zedd swished a hand, urging the man on his way. “Yes, you’re right. Go ahead.Tell her I will come to kiss her good night after a while. I just need lo thinkon this a bit.”Once he was gone, Rikka leaned a leather-covered hip against the heavy desk andfolded her arms under her breasts. “Are you saying that the words of prophecyvanishing was caused by some kind of worm, like a bookworm that eats the pasteor the paper?”“No, it eats the words, not the paper.”“Then it’s… what? Some kind of tiny little worm that eats ink?”Annoyed at the interruption, Zedd halted his pacing to stare at her. “Eats… ?No, no, not in that way. This is something of magic. A tricky little twist ofsomething clever. If I recall correctly it was referred to as a prophetic wormbecause it could eat away at the branches of prophecy, much like wood bore wormseat away at a tree. It starts with related prophecy, either in subject or inchronology, like wood bores might infest a particular branch. Once establishedthis kind of worm begins eating away the tree of prophecy. In this case, thebranch is the one having to do with the time since Richard was born.”Rikka looked genuinely fascinated and at the same time distraught. Shestraightened and tilted her head toward him. “Really? Magic can do such athing?”Zedd, holding his elbow in one hand and his chin in the fingertips of the other,made a low sound deep in his throat. “I think so. Maybe. I’m not sure.” Heheaved an impatient, irritable sigh. “I’m trying to remember. I only saw thereference once. I can’t recall if it was a theory I read or if it was the spellitself, or if it was only a suggestion in a book of records, or if it… Wait—”He stared up at the beamed ceiling as he squinted with the effort ofrecollection. “It was before Richard was born, I’m sure of that much. I rememberthat I was a young man. That would mean that it had to be when I was here. Thatmuch makes sense. And if I was here…”Zedd’s head came back down. “Dear spirits.”Rikka leaned in. “What? Dear spirits what?”“I remember,” Zedd whispered, his eyes going wide. “I remember where I saw it.”“Where?”Shoving his sleeves higher up his bony arms, Zedd headed for the door. “Nevermind. I will see to it. You just go about your patrolling, or some thing. I’llbe back later.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33With the sun going down, the air was beginning to cool as Zedd raced down thebroad rampart. The huge stones of the crenellated wall radiated heat they hadstored from the hot sun beating down on them all day. The city far below themountainside was melting into a sea of gloom, while pink rays of the departingsun caressed the tops of some of the tallest towers of the Keep high overhead.The dying light of dusk had brought a still quiet touched only by the distantwhisper of the cicadas.At an intersection of ramparts, Zedd ran around the corner to the right. Unlikethe rampart at the edge of the Keep, which overlooked a drop-off of thousands offeet down the sheer face of the mountain, the narrower interior bastion wall hadprecipitous drop-offs to both sides, yet within the massive complex that gave aclear view of nearly windowless walls descending down into the darkness.Courtyards far below provided the refreshment of open air directly off some ofthe lower floors within the Keep. Zedd imagined that people who in the past hadworked in the lower reaches of the Keep must have appreciated being able to stepoutside from time to time.As he ran down the narrow bastion path, bridges to various towers crossedoverhead. Soaring up before him at the end of the pathway was an immense,imposing wall with vertical rows of projecting keystones for interior floors.There was a grand, double entrance door at the base of that looming wall withdesigns above reliefs of columns carved in the wall beneath the arched stonelintel, but Zedd instead took to an opening in the side rail to take the stepsdown. The seemingly eternal flight of stairs descended down a long, sloping lipbuilt into the side of the clifflike bastion wall.He needed to go down into the lower reaches of the Keep, deep within themountain, to places where no one ever went.To places no one but he even knew existed.The stone banister on the open, exposed side of the stairs wasn’t very high andas a consequence the descent down the straight run of hundreds of feet ofstairs, with no landings, was a harrowing experience. To his left rose thecarefully fit stone blocks of the imposing bastion wall, to his right was adrop-off that would make any self-respecting cliff proud. Going down thatmonumental run of stairs always made Zedd feel tiny. He could see little more atthe bottom than the jagged formation of dark rock at the base of one of theround towers rising up from the small courtyard.Partway down, Zedd realized that he heard footsteps racing to catch him. Hestopped and turned. It was Rikka.“What do you think you’re doing?” He called up to her.The wind rising up the narrow canyon formed by the stone walls all around liftedhis hair and his robes. It almost felt as if his bony frame might lift right offthe stairs and be carried away like a dried leaf on an updraft.Rikka came to a panting halt a few steps above him. “What does it look like I’mdoing?”“It looks like you’re not doing what I told you to do.”“Let’s go,” she said, swishing her hand to urge him on. “I’m coming with you.”“I told you that I would see to this. I told you to go patrol or something.”“This is trouble that concerns Lord Rahl.”“It’s just some information in old books that I need to check into.”“Chase and Rachel are leaving early in the morning. You would be in with Rachel,telling her a story and tucking her in, unless there was something going on thathas you really worried. This is about Lord Rahl. If it has you worried, then ithas me worried. I’m going with you.”Zedd didn’t want to stand out on the open steps arguing with her, so he didn’t.He turned and raced downward, holding up his robes in both fists so that hewouldn’t trip and fall. Besides going on seemingly forever, the steps werefrighteningly steep. A fall so high up on the steps could easily be fatal.Finally reaching the bottom, Zedd stopped on the first stepping stone and turnedback. “Stay on the stones.”Rikka glanced around at the expanse of viny groundcover. Beyond were walls ontwo sides that rose up for hundreds of feet without interruption. Behind was thestairs and bastion wall. To the right was a jutting mass of bedrock from whichthe tower rose.“Why?” She asked as she followed Zedd across the stepping stones.“Because I said so.” lie didn’t feel like spending time explaining traps ofmagic. Were she to step off the stones, the shields would not just warn her, butprevent her from going where she shouldn’t be. Still, for those not possessingthe proper power, it was always best to stay completely away from shieldswhenever possible.If the shields failed to stop intruders from crossing this secluded courtyard,the vines would snare them. While the victim struggled to escape, theseparticular vines would tangle around the ankles. Stimulated by snuggling, thevines rapidly sprouted wicked thorns that penetrated into bone where they thenanchored themselves. Freeing anyone trapped in the vines was a painful, bloodyaffair and, more often than not, fatal. Defenses at the Wizard’s Keep were nothesitant in their purpose.“Those vines are moving.” Rikka snatched his sleeve. “Those vines are movinglike a nest of snakes.”Zedd scowled back over his shoulder. “Why do you think I told you to stay on thestepping stones?”He lifted a lever and pulled open the second round-topped door he came to andducked inside. He could feel Rikka practically breathing down his neck. Reachingblindly in the darkness his bony fingers found a smooth sphere in the bracket tothe right. As he passed his hand over the glossy surface it began to glow with agreenish light. The entry room was small, made of simple, undecorated stoneblock walls. Overhead was a beam and plank ceiling. Against the wall to theright was a single, short slab of slate built in to provide a bench in case thestairs had left any visitor in need of a brief rest. In both of the other twowalls were two dark passageways going off in separate directions.Along the wall above the slab bench were dozens of brackets, over half of themholding spheres that glowed faintly with the same color of greenish light as theone he had first touched. Zedd lifted one of the spheres from a bracket. It washeavy, made from solid glass, but there were other elements fused into thisglass and those elements responded to the stimulus of the gift. In his hand thegreenish cast changed to a warmer yellow glow. He let a spark of his gift liftthrough the sphere and it brightened, throwing harsh shadows down the two hallsahead of them.With a sharp jab of a bony linger, he sat Rikka on the bench. “This is as far asyou go.”Grim determination was etched on her lace as her blue eyes watched him.“Something strange is happening with the books of prophecy. You’ve been frettingover those books for days, now. You haven’t eaten or slop! But worse by far isthat the prophecies that are vanishing are about lord Rahl.”It was an observation, not a question. He’d thought that his turmoil had beenall internal. She had been quietly paying more attention than he’d, given hercredit for. Or maybe he had just been too distracted to notice her payingattention. In either case, it was not a good sign that he had been sopreoccupied that he hadn’t even been aware of her marking how absorbed andunsettled he’d been.“Near as I can tell, you are right in that a great many of those vanishedprophecies are about Richard, but I don’t think they all are. From what I havebeen able to determine, however, they all have to do with prophecy pertaining toa time after he was born. That doesn’t mean that they are all about him, though.The blank places in the books are extensive. Since I can’t remember what thoseblank places said, there obviously is no way to tell what they were about,making it impossible to know the subject individual of the missing prophecies.”“But from what you can piece together they mostly have something to do with LordRahl.”This, too, had not been a question, but a statement of observation, or, atleast, reasoned speculation. This was a Mord-Sith asking questions that revolvedaround the issue of the safety of her Lord Rahl. Zedd could see that she was inno mood for any evasive explanations.“I would have to agree that Richard, if not central, is at least deeplyconnected with the trouble in the books of prophecy.”Rikka rose up from the bench. “Then this is no time for you to go all secretiveon me. This is important. Lord Rahl is vital to all of us. This is not onlyabout the safety of your grandson, but about the future of all of our lives.”“And I’m seeing to—”“It is not only important to you; he is important to all of us. If you alonediscover something significant and anything happens to you, then we could all beleft at a dead end. This is more important than you keeping your secrets.”Zedd put his hands on his hips and turned away for a moment, considering. Hefinally turned back to her.“Rikka, there are things down there that no one knows about. There are goodreasons for that.”“I’m not going to steal any treasure and if you fear me seeing some ‘secret ofthe ages,’ then I will be willing to swear on my life to keep it secret unlessit is necessary for me to reveal it to Lord Rahl.”“It’s more than that. Many of the things in the lower reaches of the Keep areincredibly dangerous to anyone who goes near them.”“There are things of incredible danger outside the Keep as well. We no longerhave the luxury of secrets.”Zedd watched her eyes. She had a point. If anything happened to him, theinformation, too, was as good as dead. He had always planned on someday lettingRichard know about this, but there had never been any time and, until theproblem with the books of prophecy had cropped up, it hadn’t seemed critical.Still, this was not Richard who would see these things.“What do you think, wizard? That I will go to town and gossip about what I’veseen? Who is left to tell? The Order has overrun most of the New World andeveryone has fled Aydindril for D’Hara. D’Hara hangs by a thread. Our futurehangs by a thread.”“There are reasons that some knowledge is kept hidden.”“There are also reasons that wise men sometimes must share what they know. Lifeis what matters. If knowledge will help preserve and advance life, then thatknowledge should not be hidden—especially when it may be lost right when itcould be that it’s needed most.”Zedd pressed his lips tight as he considered her words. He had discovered thissecret when he had been a boy. His whole life he’d never told another personabout it. No one had instructed him to keep it a secret—nor could they, no onebut he knew about it. Still, he knew that there had to be a reason that this wasnot something that was meant to be widely known. This had been kept secret for areason.He just didn’t know what that reason was.“Zedd, for Lord Rahl’s sake, for the sake of our cause, let me come with you.”He appraised her determination for a moment. “You can never reveal this toanyone.”“Except for Lord Rahl, I will never reveal it to another. Mord-Sith often go totheir graves without revealing the things they know.”Zedd nodded. “All right. It goes to your grave with you, unless some thinghappens to me. If so, then you must tell Richard what I show you this night. Youmust swear to me that you will never tell anyone else about this, though, noteven your sister Mord-Sith.”Without hesitation Rikka held her hand out to him. “I swear.”Zedd clasped her hand and in so doing struck the agreement, accepting her word.When he had been First Wizard during the war with D’Hara, before he had put upthe boundaries and killed Panis Rahl, Darken Rahl’s father, if anyone had toldhim that he would someday make such an agreement with a Mord-Sith over somethingso important, he would have thought they were crazy. He was grateful that suchthings had changed for the better."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34It’s a complex route,” Zedd told her.Rikka arched an eyebrow. “Have you ever had to come find me because I got lostpatrolling the Keep?”Zedd realized that he hadn’t. He knew very well how easy it was to become lostin the Keep. In fact, that was one of its defenses.In several places when trying to travel through the Keep one came uponinterconnected rooms numbering in the thousands. In those places there were nohallways except for the stairs going up or down. Passage through thosethree-dimensional mazes was necessary to get into several well protected areas.It was deceptively easy to become forever lost in the morass of thoseinterconnected rooms. Even people who had grown up in the Keep could easilybecome lost in there.An invader, unfamiliar with the place and if they went too deep into thelabyrinth, faced a formidable challenge just to find their way back out, muchless to make a passage all the way through, and then to escape. Once you hadbeen through a few rooms, through a few doorways, it was amazing how similareverything looked. There were no windows to help and direction soon becamemeaningless. There was virtually no way to tell if you recalled seeing a room ora doorway before. One looked much like the last dozen you’d seen. There had beenspies and such in the past who had become lost in the maze of rooms. In agespast it had not been entirely un usual to find a body in there.Of course, not all those who intended harm were strangers. In the past some hadbeen traitors.“No, I guess you never have become lost,” Zedd finally agreed. “Not yet, anyway.You’ve not been here long enough to begin to explore the majority of the place.There are dangers of every sort. Getting lost in the labyrinth that is the Keepis only one of the perils. Where we’re going is like that. It’s even easier toget lost down there. You will have to do your best to remember your way. I’llhelp you where I can.”Rikka nodded, seemingly unconcerned. “I’m good at remembering things like aseries of turns. I memorize them when I patrol.”“Don’t get overly confident. This is more complex than a series of turns. Imyself have become lost in the Keep, and I grew up here. There is not only oneright way to get where we’re going. Sometimes the route you took the last timewon’t work this time because down in the lower reaches, of the Keep the shieldssometimes shift by themselves to different passageways. It’s part of theirdesign to make it more difficult to go! through—for instance if a spy were todraw a map for their cohorts.”Unimpressed, Rikka shrugged. “I understand. The People’s Palace is like that insome of the sections where the public isn’t allowed—complex, with the openpassages one can get through changing from time to time Additionally, there isno direct route to anywhere, even if all the passages happen to be open, whichthey never are.”“I remember; I was there before, although I was in the public sections, but thatwas confusing enough.” It had been after Darken Rahl had captured Richard. “Ihad the advantage, though, in that the People’s Palace is made in the form of aspell drawn on the face of the ground and I know how that particular spell isconstructed, so I know where the primary arms and the connecting links arelocated.”“Well,” Rikka said, “we had to be able to find different passages through theplace so that we could get from area to area if it was ever invaded. Or, if weare chasing someone, we had to be able to think of a way to get ahead of them.We have to be able to do more than simply remember a series of turns. We mustcomprehend the whole of the place we pass through. In my head the turns I takemake up parts of a picture of a place. Every turn adds to that picture. Withthat ever growing image in my mind I can find my way by taking a different waybecause I can see where the other parts are and how they lock together.”Zedd blinked in astonishment. “That seems quite a remarkable talent.”“I always could understand that kind of thing better than I can understandpeople.”Zedd grunted a brief laugh. “I think you understand people more than you admitto.”She only smiled.“All right, now listen to me,” he said. “You will not only need to remember agreat many turns this night. There is more. The only way to get where we aregoing is through a number of shields. You are not gifted so the only way for youto pass through those shields is for a gifted person to help get you through. Ifit ever becomes necessary, Richard can take you through them, like I will takeyou through tonight. But no matter how well you know the place, or how theshields shift, there is no way to get through without having to pass theshields, so you won’t be able to get through alone. That means you won’t be ableto practice the route by yourself.”He shook a finger before her face to make his point. “Don’t even think lo try toforce your way through the shields. To attempt to do so would be fatal.”Rikka nodded. “I understand. I would have no reason to need to get throughwithout you or Lord Rahl.”Zedd leaned even closer to her. “On your word and your life.”“I have already given you my word and sworn it on my life. That is the way itwill be.”Zedd closed the matter with a single nod. “Good. Let’s go.”With Rikka close at his heels, Zedd rushed down the narrow stone hall to theleft, their way lit by the globe he carried. Glass spheres in brackets in thedistance glowed faintly once coming into sight. As they passed them, eachbrightened at his approach and dimmed as he moved on with the one he had taken.At the first stairway they came to, Zedd took it up, knowing that to descend tohis destination he first needed to traverse several impassable areas of thelower Keep by going higher.They made their way down broad corridors lined with elegant wood paneling andpatterned stone floors and then through several rooms that served as study areasoutside nearby libraries. The rooms had dozens of thick carpets scattered aboutat various angles among the comfortable chairs. There was ample table space, andthere were a number of lamps to provide adequate light for reading. Zedd knewbecause he had spent a great deal of time reading books from the libraries.After passing through a series of plain stone halls that came from various partsof the Keep, they at last reached the main artery hallway in the section theyhad to pass through. The hall was nearly a hundred feel tall, with the slopingwalls getting closer together at the top; it felt like walking through animmense cleft in the Keep. The sun was already down so the high slits in thestone did little to illuminate the hallway. They did, however, allow the batsout. livery night at dusk, thousands of the bats poured up from hidden, dark,damp places in the Keep and made their way out the high slits in the mainhallway.At a gilded doorway, Zedd turned to Rikka. “This passage is shielded. Take myhand and you will be able to pass.”She didn’t hesitate. Zedd went through the shield first. The shield produced agentle tingling sensation against his skin along the plane of the opening. Whenhe turned back toward her and pulled her hand through that plane of the shieldat the doorway, she flinched.“It won’t hurt you as long as I hold on to you,” he assured her. “Shall Icontinue?”She nodded. “It’s just so cold. The feel of it surprised me, that’s all.”Holding her hand tightly, he drew her the rest of the way through the doorway.Once through she vigorously rubbed her arms.“What would have happened had I tried to go through without you?”“It’s hard to say, since different shields do different things, but let’s justsay that you wouldn’t have made it through. This one has no preliminary warningfield, so it may not be fatal. There are a number of shields we will have topass through that would take the flesh right off your bones. Those kind giveample warning, though.”She didn’t look too. pleased to hear it, but she made no protest. Mord-Sithdidn’t like magic, so he knew she was putting in a great effort to suppress hernatural resistance.The gilded doorway led down a hall of white marble all around—the floors, walls,and ceiling. The white color was designed to prevent certain gambits of magicthat used conjuring involving color to trick the shield at either end of thehall. At the far end, Zedd helped Rikka through the shield—this one using heatrather than cold.Once clear of the hall, they went down several flights of dusty black marblesteps. At the bottom of the steps he led her down the left of three forks. Thesphere he carried provided a bubble of light around them as they raced throughthe roughly hewn stone tunnel that took them into simple rooms that were made ofsimple stone blocks.Most of the rooms had one or two doorways, but some had three, or even fouropenings that led to other rooms. Some were reached by going up a short flightof stairs to yet more rooms. A number of rooms were either up or down only astep or two. Most of the rooms, though, were level with one another. The sizesof the rooms varied little and not a single one had any furniture whatsoever.Some of the rooms were plastered to make I he walls smooth and a number of thosewere painted, although the chipped, peeling paint was so faded that the colorswere barely discernible, leaving them all looking a similar dingy color, sincedust had been settling in them for centuries. When Zedd had been a boy he hadbeen lost in the maze of rooms for an entire day. The place was so undisturbedthat there were still faint footprints evident in the fine dirt coating on thefloors.After going through a seemingly endless series of rooms, they finally emptiedinto a broad corridor of coarse, gray granite blocks. While the corridor waswide, the ceiling was so low that they had to bend down slightly so as not tobump their heads. It was a place that, while empty and simple looking, hadalways felt ominous to Zedd. Around a corner, iron brackets holding more of theglass spheres brightened as they passed, and then faded as they continued on. Inseveral places utilitarian stone stairwells emptied into the low corridor.Several other taller halls branched off the main passageway.At the end of the broad, low hall they finally entered a major passageway thatwas plastered and painted a sandy color. Reliefs of pillars were spaced down thepassage, giving it a grander appearance. When they reached the middle, Zeddfinally paused. He pointed up at the ceiling.“See there, that iron grate overhead that lets the Keep breathe, lets fresh airdown here?”She peered up at the ornate grate. “Is that a book?”Within the design, crafted from the iron bars, was the outline of an open book.The design, intended as a quick visual reference, denoted a section of the Keepthat contained a number of libraries.“Yes. The grate will help you remember that this is where you must turn. Thiscorridor with that grate above is a main trunk of passageways. There are anumber of ways down to this place, and from here you can go by various routes tonearly anywhere in the Keep, but here, under this grate, you must turn down thishall.” He gestured toward a small hallway. “It’s the only way to get to where weare going.”Zedd watched her as she looked around at her surroundings and once more checkedthe grate overhead. When she was sure and had nodded, they started down a smallside hall.The hall contained a series of rooms that Zedd believed were once used formaintenance supplies. He knew that one of the rooms still had a number of tools.Beyond, at the end of the hall, were a few roughly constructed rooms made ofstone followed by small, square passageways running oil in several directions.At the end of the center passageway, they came to a warren of short runs throughlow service shafts taking them on a winding route that changed levels by a fewfeet from time to time. They passed empty rooms and rusted iron doors that stoodclosed. Cobwebs clogged the shafts in places. In other places, sections of hallthat were several feet lower held stagnant water. The rotting carcasses of ratsfloated in the fetid water. Without a word they waded through to reach higherground beyond.When they reached a spiral stone staircase beyond the maze they descended intothe inky darkness, the silent sphere bringing harsh light and shadows to placesthat had not been lit for years. The stairs were tiny, only large enough for asingle body at a time to slip downward. It felt rather like being swallowed downthe gullet of some stone monster.At the bottom of the spiral stairs, the light cast harsh shadows down roughlycut passageways that were inspection shafts for part of the Keep’s foundation.Flecks of quartz in stone foundation blocks the size of small palaces sparkledwhen the light fell across them. Zedd led Rikka to the narrow stairs thatdescended down beside the face of that glittering foundation wall. They bothpeered over the edge of that slit in the ground before starting down.At the bottom they followed the narrow slit along the base of the foundationblocks. The stone rose up into the darkness, the sparkling quartz above lookinglike stars. To the right was a roughly cut wall of crumbling rock. If thatsofter wall were to collapse, they would be buried alive where no one would eversearch for them.The foundation in this part of the Keep was kept clear of the soft surroundingrock so that it could move a little if it had to. The foundation blocks had beenset down into the harder bedrock below. The narrow slit also provided an areawayfor inspection of the foundations. Zedd had always thought it remarkable that hehad never found any block that was failing. There were some that had cracks, butthose were said not to be structural problems. When they came to another narrowflight of stairs at the end of the slit, they again went down, deeper into thepitch black cut.“Is there any end to this?” Rikka asked.Zedd looked back over his shoulder, the glowing sphere easting her fire in harshyellow light. “We’re deep in the mountain and getting closer lo one of the sideslopes. We still have quite a ways to go.”She simply nodded, resigned to however far it was.“Do you think you can get this far—providing you have me or Richard lo get youthrough the shields?”There had been a number of shields, some that she had not liked going through.For one without the protection of the gift it was in places a very uncomfortableexperience, even with Zedd helping her.“I think so,” she said.In the lower inspection channels, they came to round, tile-lined tunnels thatwhen need be also served as drains. Zedd entered the complex of tunnels, takingintersections that he remembered since he was a boy. Dripping water echoedthrough the passages. It was cold enough to see their breath in the humid air.Water dripped between the tiles in places, making the tunnel slick.At various places, right in the middle of nowhere in the tunnels, theyencountered powerful shields that he helped her pass through. Several were sostrong that they gave off preliminary warnings long in advance. Zedd had to wraphis arms around her in order to protect her enough to get her safely through.“There’s a lot of rats down here,” Rikka said.Zedd could hear them squeaking by the hundreds all through the honeycombedpassageways. The little beasts seemed to scatter before the light could fullyilluminate them, so they were in evidence by sound, not by sight, except thedead ones.“Yes. Are you afraid of rats?”She halted and scowled at him. “No one likes rats.”“Can’t argue with you about that.”At each intersection Zedd pointed out to her the way they had to go. He couldn’timagine how she was ever going to remember the way. He hoped it never becamenecessary. He hoped to be the one to show Richard. As a boy Zedd had usedtracers of magic to learn his way through. Rikka paid close attention andwatched each of the dark intersections they came to. He was sure that it wasmore than she had bargained for and that she would not be able to remember herway. He thought that perhaps he would take her through several more times inorder to help her get it all mapped out in her head. After that, he would testher and let her lead the way down.After what seemed like an endless journey working their way even lower, theyfinally entered a colossal room, an immense, cavelike chamber, that was hollowedout from the interior of the mountain. The granit quarried out of the mountaindown in this place had provided some of the stone for the foundation. Thequarry, abandoned after the construction was completed, had left behind the hugeroom.In some places around the sides, the builders of the Keep had left [??some]pillars of stone in place to hold up what they apparently had found to be weakerareas of the ceiling. In spots around the room there were broad veins ofobsidian, a black, glassy rock that was unsuitable for building material. Zeddhad seen it used in a few places in the palace, mostly for decoration. In theglow of the light from the sphere, the surface of the obsidian showed the shinycurved arcs left by being chipped away with chisels, leaving it looking likedazzling fish scales.The center of the gigantic room, where the rock was the hardest, was vaulted toa height of over two hundred and fifty feet. From the stone evidence, itappeared that the workers had started at the top, taking out huge blocks ofstone right under what was the present ceiling. They then began quarrying thenext lower level of rock until they eventually had hollowed out the cavelikeroom. The different levels of galleries around the side were just tall enough,and just wide enough between the large square columns, for the foundation blocksto be hauled though. Beyond the room were ramps where the blocks had been easeddown to the lower parts of the foundation.“See there, across the room?” Zedd asked, pointing at an enormous, dark corridorto which he knew the surrounding ramps led. “That was constructed first. It’sthe main channel where the foundation blocks were transported from this room tothe foundation all along that section of the Keep. Look at how the floor is wornby the work.”The floor leading into the yawning dark chasm was worn so smooth that it almostlooked as if it had been polished.“Why didn’t we come that way—it would have been a much shorter route.”He was impressed that she realized that the primary passageway ran in thedirection from which they had come. The stone blocks for the foundation wouldnot have taken the circuitous route they had.“You’re right, it would have been shorter, but there are shields there that Ican’t pass. Since I can’t get in there, because of those shields, I don’t knowwhat is in there, but I suspect that the builders probably created rooms inthere that contain things that must be protected. I can’t really think of anyother reason for those shields.”“Why can’t you pass them? You are First Wizard.”“The wizards of that time had both sides of the gift. Richard is the first inthousands of years to be born with the Subtractive side as well as the Additive.Shields with Subtractive Magic are deadly and are typically reserved for themost dangerous places, or the places that have exceptionally important itemsthey were most concerned about protecting”Zedd led Rikka across the vast room by a route that kept them close to the outerwall. He rarely came down to this room and so he had to watch the stone wallcarefully as they made their way around. When they reached the place he waslooking for, he snatched Rikka’s arm and pulled her to a stop.“This is it.”Rikka blinked as she looked around. To the inexperienced eye, it looked the sameas the rest of the room. “This is what?”“The secret place.”It looked like the rest of the huge room. Everywhere the walls were scarred withthe gouges left by tools used by workers thousands of years before.Zedd held up the glass sphere so she could see where he pointed. “Here. See thatgouge up high? The one going at this angle, following the fissure, and a littlefatter in the middle? Slip your left hand into it. There’s a cleft in the backof the gouge, deeper into the fissure.”Rikka frowned at him but then stood on her tiptoes and slid her hand into thegrove up to her knuckles.“There’s a lip in the rock down here,” he said. “I used it when I was smaller.If you can’t reach, step up on the edge.”“No, I got it,” she said. “Now what?”“You’re only halfway in. Put your hand in deeper.”She wiggled her fingers and worked her hand in farther until it was in up to herwrist. “That’s as far as it will go. It’s solid where my fingertips are.”“Move your longest linger up and down until you find a hole.”She made a face as she worked her fingers. “Got it.”Zedd took her right hand and guided it into a similar gouge in an other part ofthe same fissure down at waist level. “Find a hole in the back of this one aswell. When you do, push a finger firmly into both holes.”She made a little sound deep in her throat with the effort. “Found it! I’ve gotthem both. I’m pushing.”“All right, now, as you push with both fingers, put your right foot up here, onthe wall right on the other side of this chink, and give it a good shove.”She frowned at him, but did as he said. Nothing happened.“Can’t you push any harder than that? Don’t tell me that you aren’t as strong asa skinny old man.”She shot him a scowl and then used her grip in the handholds for leverage as shegrunted with effort and gave the wall a good shove with her boot. Suddenly, theface of the rock began moving away. Zedd urged Rikka to step back. They bothwatched as a section of the wall silently slid back as if it were a massivedoor, which was exactly what it was. Despite its monumental weight, it was soperfectly balanced that once the two finger latches were released, it pivotedwith nothing more than a stout shove.“Dear spirits,” Rikka whispered as she leaned toward the opening and peered intothe dark maw. “How did you ever find such a place?”“I found it as a child. Actually, I found the other end. Once I came throughinto here, I knew where this spot was and I took careful note so that I was ableto find it again. The first few times I couldn’t find it, so I had to comethrough again.”“Well, what is it?”“When I was a boy, it was my salvation. It was the way I was able to sneak backinto the Keep without having to come across the bridge and in the front, likeeveryone else.”She suspiciously arched an eyebrow. “You must have been a troublesome child.”Zedd smiled. “I have to admit that there were those who would agree with that.This place served me well. I was also able to get in here when the Sisters ofthe Dark had taken the Keep. They only knew to guard the front entrance. They,like everyone else alive, didn’t know this place existed.”“So this is what you wanted to show me? A secret way into the Keep?”“No, that’s by far the least important or remarkable thing about this place.Come on and I’ll show you.”Her suspicion flared again. “Just what kind of place is it’?”Zedd held up the sphere of light as he leaned toward her and whispered.“Beyond is eternal night: the passage of the dead.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35The distant howl of a wolf woke Richard from a dead sleep. The forlorn cryechoed through the mountains, but went unanswered. Richard lay on his side, inthe surreal light of false dawn, idly listening, waiting, for a return cry thatnever came.Try as he might, he couldn’t seem to open his eyes for longer than the span of asingle, slow heartbeat, much less gather the energy to lift his head. Shadowytree limbs appeared to move about in the murky darkness,Richard gasped as he fully awoke. He awoke angry.He was lying on his back. His sword lay across his chest, one hand clutching thescabbard, the other gripping the hilt so hard that the letters of the word truthwere pressed painfully into his palm on one side and his fingertips on theother. The Sword of Truth was pulled partway out of its scabbard. Its anger,too, had partly slipped its bounds.The first, faint traces of dawn were just beginning to silently steal throughthe forested mountainside. The thick woods were quiet and still.Richard slid the blade back into its scabbard and sat up, laying the sword downbeside him on his bedroll.He drew his legs up and put his elbows on his knees as he ran his fingers backthrough his hair. His heart still raced from the sword’s rage. It had stoleninto him without his conscious awareness or direction, but he wasn’t surprisedor alarmed. It was hardly the first time he had begun to draw the sword as he’dremembered that fateful morning while slipping the bonds of sleep. Sometimes hewoke to find that he’d pulled the blade completely free.Why did he keep having that memory as he awoke?He knew all too well the reason. That was the morning he had awakened to findKahlan missing. It was the terrible memory of the morning she’d disappeared. Itwas a waking nightmare about the nightmare that had become his life, and yet, heknew that there was something about it that kept making it go through his mind.He had been over it a thousand times but he couldn’t figure out what was someaningful about that particular memory. The wolf waking him had been a bit odd,but that didn’t seem so strange that it would keep haunting him.Richard looked around in the deep gloom but he didn’t see Cara. Off through thethick stands of trees he could just make out the faint stain of red streakingthe rim of the eastern sky. The slash of color almost looked like blood seepingthrough a gash in the slate black sky beyond the perfectly still trees.He was bone-weary from the relentless pace of their wild ride up from deep inthe Old World. They had been stopped a number of times by patrolling soldiersscattered throughout the Midlands, and by occupying troops. It was by no meansthe main force of the Imperial Order, but they had been trouble enough. Oncethey’d let Cara and Richard, posing as a stone carver and his wife, go on theirway to a job Richard had invented for the glory of the Order. The rest of thetimes the two of them had had to fight their way out of the situation. Thoseencounters had been bloody.He needed more sleep—they had gotten very little on their journey—but as long asKahlan was missing they couldn’t afford to sleep any more than was absolutelynecessary. He didn’t know how much time he had to find her, but he didn’t intendto waste any of it. He refused to believe that his time had long since run out.One of the horses had died of exhaustion not long ago; he couldn’t rememberexactly when. Another had come up lame a while back and they’d had to abandonit. Richard would worry about finding more horses later. There were moreimportant concerns at hand. They were close to Agaden Reach, Shota’s home. Forthe last two days they had been climbing steadily into the formidable mountainsthat ringed the Reach.As he stretched his aching, tired muscles, he again tried to think of how hewould convince Shota to help him. She had helped him before, but that was noguarantee she would help him this time. Shota could be difficult, to say theleast. There were people who were so terrified of the witch woman that theywouldn’t even say her name aloud.Zedd had told him once that Shota never told you anything you wanted to knowwithout also telling you something that you didn’t want to know. Richardcouldn’t really imagine what he didn’t want to know, but he understood quiteclearly what it was he did want to know and he intended Shota to tell himanything she knew about Kahlan’s disappearance of where she might be. If Shotarefused, there was going to be trouble.As his anger heated he realized that he felt the cool, tingling touch of mist onhis face.It was then that he also noticed something moving in the trees.He squinted in an effort to see in the darkness. It couldn’t be the breezemoving the leaves; there was no wind in the silent predawn woods.Shadowy tree limbs appeared to move about in the murky darkness.There had been no wind at all that morning, either.Richard’s sense of alarm rose to match his heart rate. He stood in his bedroll.Something was slipping through the trees.It wasn’t disturbing the branches or brush the way a person or an animal would.It was higher up, maybe at eye level. There simply wasn’t enough light for himto see what it was. As dark and still as the morning was, though, he couldn’t becertain that there really was something there. It might have been hisimagination; being this close to Shota certainly was enough to make him uneasy.While she might have helped him in the past, she had also caused him no end oftrouble.But if nothing was there in the trees, then why was his skin tingling withdread? And what was the almost imperceptible sound he heard, like a soft hiss?Without taking his eyes off the dark woods, Richard reached out and put hisfingertips against a nearby spruce for balance as he carefully squatted downenough to pick up his sword from where it lay on the bedroll. As he quietlyslipped the baldric over his head, he tried to focus his eyes in the darknessout ahead of him to see what, if anything, was moving. Whatever was moving, itcouldn’t be much, yet he was more and more convinced by the moment that itreally was something.The most disconcerting aspect of it was the way it moved. It didn’t move inshort bursts, like a bird flitting from branch to branch, or in rapidstart-and-stop spirts like a squirrel. It didn’t even move with the stealth of asnake that glided, then paused, then glided some more.This moved not only fluidly and quietly, but continuously.The horses, off through the trees in a corral Richard had constructed by usingsaplings to fence off the end of a narrow chasm, snorted and stumped theirhooves. A flock of birds in the distance suddenly burst from their roost andtook to wing.For the first time, Richard realized that the cicadas were silent.Richard detected the faint scent of something out of place in the forest.Carefully, quietly, he sniffed the air, trying to place the scent. He thought itmight be a whiff of something burning. The odor wasn’t anywhere near as strongas a fire would be. It almost smelled like a campfire, but they had no campfire;Richard hadn’t wanted to take the time or to chance attracting attention. Carahad a lantern with a light shield around it, but it didn’t smell like thelantern flame.He scanned the woods all around, checking for Cara. She was on watch so she wasprobably nearby, but Richard didn’t see her anywhere. Surely she wouldn’t havegone far, especially not after the attack the morning Kahlan had disappeared.She was all too worried about his safety and knew that this time, if he was shotwith an arrow, there would be no Nicci to save his life. No, Cara would beclose.His instinct was to call out for her, but he suppressed the urge. He firstwanted to find out what was happening, to find out what was wrong, before hecalled out an alarm; an alarm would also alert any adversary that he was alreadyaware of them. It was better to let an opponent, especially an opponent sneakingup on you, believe that they had not been detected.As he studied the surrounding area, Richard thought that there was something notright about the woods. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but they looked wrong.He supposed that he had that impression in part because of the curious burningsmell. It was still too dark to be able to see anything clearly, but from whathe was able to see, the branches didn’t seem to look right. There was somethingodd about the pine boughs, the leaves. They didn’t seem to be hanging naturally.He remembered all too well coming to Agaden Reach the first time. Farther backdown the mountains he had been attacked by some strange creature. As he had beenfrantically fighting it off, Shota had snatched Kahlan and taken her down intothe Reach. That attack had been in the guise of a stranger trying to lead him toan ambush. The creature had finally been frightened off. And, this time therewas no such stranger. Still, that didn’t mean that such a creature, havingfailed before, might not this time try a different approach. He remembered, too,that his sword has been all that had kept the monstrous thing at bay.As quietly as possible, Richard slowly drew his sword from its sheath. In anattempt to keep it from making any noise, he pinched the sides of the bladeright at the throat of the scabbard, letting the steel slide between his fingerand thumb as it slipped out of the scabbard. Even so, the blade hissed ever sosoftly as it came free. The sword’s rage, too, slipped its bounds.As he steadily drew his sword, he began cautiously moving toward the spot wherehe thought he saw movement. Whenever he was looking elsewhere, he thought thatout of the corner of his eye he could see a faint shape of something ahead ofhim, but when he then looked directly at the place, he couldn’t see anything. Hedidn’t know if it was a trick of his sight, or if there was nothing to see.He was well aware that in dark conditions the center of the eyes’ vision was notnearly as good as the peripheral vision. Being a guide and having spent a greatdeal of time outdoors at night, he had often used the technique of not lookingdirectly at what it was that he needed to see, but instead gazing at leastfifteen degrees away from it. At night, the peripheral vision worked better thandirect vision. Since leaving his woods where he had been a guide, he had learnedthat the knack of focusing his awareness to specific places in his peripheralvision while not turning his eyes there was invaluable in sword fighting.Before he had gone three steps, his pant leg came up against something thatshouldn’t have been there. It was a light contact, almost like a low branch. Hehalted immediately, before putting any pressure on it. He smelled somethingagain, only stronger. It smelled like scorched cloth.He then felt the intense heat against his shin. Quickly, and without making asound, he drew back.For the life of him, Richard could not figure out what it was he had touched. Itwas not anything natural that he could think of. He might have suspected that itwas a tripwire of some sort to warn anyone hidden in the trees nearby if hemoved, but a tripwire wouldn’t burn him the way this thing had.Whatever it was, it pulled at his pants, like it was sticky, when he drew away.When he backed free of it, the sleek movement in the trees abruptly halted, asif it had detected the contact against his pant leg being broken. The deadsilence ringing in his ears was almost painful.The mist was too fine to make any sound hitting the leaves and the moisture thatthe pine needles combed from the damp air was not enough id collect and dripvery much. Besides, the sound he had heard had been something different thanrainwater. Richard focused his concentration into the dark shadows, trying tomake out what it was that had stopped moving.Then, it started in again, only more rapidly, as if with more purpose. The soft,silky sound whispering among the limbs of the trees in a way that reminded himof the blade of an ice skate gliding across smooth ice.As Richard backed away, something caught his other pant leg. It was sticky, justlike the thing that he’d snagged before. It too, felt hot.As he turned to see what it was that was against his pant leg, something brushedhis arm, just above his elbow. He didn’t have on a shirt, and the instant thesticky thing touched him it burned into his flesh. He jerked his arm back andthen stepped away from the thing touching his pant leg. With the hand holdingthe sword, he silently comforted the searing pain on his left arm. Warm bloodran down over his fingers. His anger, and the anger flooding into him from thesword, together threatened to overpower his sense of caution.He turned around, trying to see in the darkness what was there that should notbe there. The razor-thin red slash of light at the horizon glinted off his bladeas he turned, making the polished metal look like it was coated in blood tomatch the very real blood covering his hand on the hilt.The shadows around him were beginning to pull inward toward him. Whatever itwas, as it moved closer it caught limbs and boughs all around him, gentlypushing leaves and brush aside as it advanced. Richard suspected that the softhissing sound he heard was actually the sound of vegetation being scorched whenit was touched. The smell of burning leaves he had first detected began to makesense to him; he just didn’t have any idea what could be causing it, or how. Hewould doubt his judgment, doubt that such a thing could be real, were it not forthe fierce burning pain of its touch. He certainly wasn’t imagining the bloodrunning down his arm.Instinctively, Richard knew that he was running out of time."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36Richard swiftly, but silently, raised the sword before himself in preparationfor an attack—what kind of attack he wasn’t sure, but he fully intended to beready. He touched the cold steel of the blade to his sweat-slick forehead.He spoke the words “Blade be true this day” in a softly inaudible whisper, fullycommitting himself and his sword to whatever was necessary.A few fat drops of rain splashed against his bare chest. At first sporadic, thefitful rain gradually began to increase a bit. The soft whispering sound ofraindrops against the thick canopy of leaves began to spread through the quietof the woods. Richard blinked drops of water from his eyelashes.At the sound of the limbs moving, he then heard the sudden rush of footstepsstarting to run toward him. He recognized Cara’s unique gait. Apparently, shehad been patrolling around the perimeter of their campsite and had heard thesame sounds as he had. Knowing Cara, he wasn’t in the least surprised that shehad been paying close attention.But under the cover of the sound of the rain, all around him, Richard could hearbranches and limbs slowly pulling past one another. Here and there a few smalltwigs snapped as something drew in closer all around him. Something touched hisleft arm. He flinched backed a step, pulling his arm away from the gummycontact. The burn throbbed painfully. Warm blood now trickled down his arm intwo places. He felt something catch the back of his pant leg. He tugged his legaway from the sticky contact.Cara crashed through the trees not far away. Subtle, she was not. She threw opena small door on the shield around the lantern she carried, letting a weak beamof light fall across the campsite.Richard was able to see what he thought looked like a strange, dark web ofsomething crisscrossed all around him, woven through trees, shrubs, limbs, andbrush. It looked like thick cords of some sort, but organic and gummy, hecouldn’t imagine what it was or exactly how it had gotten itself every wherearound him.“Lord Rahl! Are you all right?”“Yes. Stay where you are.”“What’s going on?”“I’m not sure, yet.”The sound came closer as the still, dark strands all around him again began todraw tighter. One of them pressed against his back. He flinched away, spun, andslashed with the sword.As soon as he cut it, the whole of the tangle all around him tensed andcontracted in toward him.Cara threw open the entire shield around the lantern, hoping to see better.Richard could suddenly see that the glistening threads were nearly cocooninghim. He even saw lines of the stuff crisscrossing overhead. As close in as itall was, he was running out of clear space to maneuver.With a flash of comprehension, he understood the silken sound he had heard atfirst. The fluid, continuous movement was something spinning the filamentsaround him as if he were a meal for a spider. These filaments, though, were asthick as his wrist. What exactly they were, he had no idea. What he did know wasthat when they had touched him, sticking to his pant leg, his left arm, and hisback, they delivered painful burns.He could see Cara and her lantern as she dodged this way and that, looking for away to get through to him.“Cara, stay back! It will burn you if you touch it.”“Burn?”“Yes, like acid, I think. And, it’s sticky. Keep away from it or you’re liableto get caught in it.”“Then how are you to get out of the middle of it?”“I’ll just have to cut my way out. You stay there and let me come to you.”When the strands pulled in tighter to the left side, he finally swung the swordand struck out at them. The blade flashed in the light of Cara’s lantern,slashing through the enveloping tangle of sticky fibers. As they were parted bythe blade, they whipped around as if they’d been undo tension. Some stuck totrees or limbs, hanging down like murky moss. In the light of the lantern, hecould see the leaves shrivel up, evidently from being burned when they weretouched by the strands.Whatever was creating the webs of the stuff, Richard didn’t see it.The rain began to come down a little harder as Cara darted from side to side,trying to find a way in. “I think I can—”“No!” he yelled at her. “I told you—keep away from it!”Richard swung the sword at the thick, dark ropes wherever they drew in towardhim, trying to check their constriction and weaken their integrity, but he wasforced not to do so unless he had no choice because the sticky strands werebeginning to cling to the blade.“I need to help you stop this thing!” she called back, impatient to set himfree.“You’ll just get caught up in it. If you do that, then you can be of no help tome. Stay back. I told you, let me cut my way out and come to you.”That, at least, looked to have finally dissuaded her from any immediate attemptto try to fight her way through. She stood half crouched, lips pressed tight infrustrated fury, Agiel in her fist, not knowing what to do—not wanting to goagainst what he told her and realizing the sense of what he’d said—but at thesame time not wanting him to have to fight his way out all by himself.It was a strange, confounding, nonviolent kind of battle. There looked to be norush. The gashes he inflicted didn’t seem to cause the thing any pain. The slow,inexorable approach of the surrounding tangle seemed to be trying to lull himinto holding back, inasmuch as there appeared to be plenty of time to analyzethe situation.Despite that quiet appearance, that deceptive calm, Richard found the implacableadvance of the surrounding trap alarming in the extreme. Not wanting to give into that appeal to inaction, Richard swung the sword again, driving into thewalls of the tangled web.He could see more of the strands appearing in the woods all around him even ashe tried to fight his way through it. It was reinforcing itself, adding abackdrop even as he slashed the part closest to him. For every dozen strands hecut, two dozen more enfolded him. He kept scanning the forest, trying to seewhat was creating the growing entanglement so that he could attack the cause andnot the result. Try as he might, he couldn’t see a lead end or what was spinningthe morass, but the viscous ropes of it were moving swiftly through the treesand brush, the strands lengthening and multiplying all the time, endlesslyadding to and forming more of themselves all around him.Even though it seemed like he had ample time to figure a way out, he knew thatsuch a notion was a fool’s empty hope. He was well aware that his time wasswiftly running out. His level of alarm rose steadily. His burned flesh throbbedin pain, reminding him of what fate awaited him if he didn’t get out. Therewould come a point, he knew, when action would no longer be possible. He knewthat once the intricate trap contracted enough, he would die, but he doubtedthat it would be a quick death.As the net reinforced itself around him and moved inward, Richard attacked,slashing furiously, making a mad effort to hack his way through the tighteningentrapment. Every time he swung the sword, though, the blade was furtherensnared in the tacky substance that made up the strands. The more of it he cut,the more of it stuck to what was already clinging tenaciously to his sword. Theunwieldy mass was getting heavy and making it ever more difficult to cut throughthe wall.As he tried to hack and slash his way through, a knot of the filaments not onlycontinued to tangle together in a clotted mass around his blade, but began toadhere to the wall of the trap, making it a formidable task just to move thesword. He felt like a fly caught in a spiderweb. It took a mighty effort to pullthe sword away from the wall of the strands. They, in turn, sticking to thesword, stretched and pulled away in gummy strings.This was the first time that Richard had ever encountered an adversary of anysort that gave the sword such difficulty. He had cut through armor and iron barswith it, but this sticky substance, even though it yielded to being cut, simplyfell away and stuck to everything.He remembered Adie once asking him which he thought was stronger, teeth ortongue. She had made the point that the tongue was stronger, even though it wasmuch softer, and would endure long after the teeth gave out. Although it was ina different context, it had a frightening significance in this instance as well.Some of the gooey strings stretched out and stuck to his pant legs. As he pulledhis sword back, a string fell across his right arm. He cried out in pain anddropped to his knees.“Lord Rahl!”“Stay there!” he called before Cara had a chance to try again to reach him. “I’mall right. Just stay where you are.”Snatching up a handful of leaves, bark, and dirt, he used the debris lo protecthis hand as he pulled the dark, clinging substance from his arm.The searing pain caused him to nearly forget everything else except getting itoff.As the surrounding fibrous structure drew tighter, the thick strands pulledsmall saplings over. Branches snapped. Limbs were torn from trees. The woodswere filled with a pungent, burning smell.Even with the fury of the sword storming up through him, pulling his angerforth, Richard realized that he was losing the battle. Wherever he cut it, agreat many of those cut strands fell back to stick together with others andclose the gap. Despite his cutting through the snarled mass of the webs, the netonly tangled together and stuck to itself, creating an ever more tightly wovenweb.His calm frustration began to give way to the panicked realization that he wastrapped. That fear powered his muscles as he put all his effort into swinginghis sword. He could imagine the strange, dark mass miring him, burning hisflesh, congealing as it enfolded itself around him, eventually to suffocate himif it didn’t first kill him by scorching the flesh off his bones.With all his might Richard brought the sword down over and over, slashingthrough a wall of the stuff. More strands beyond those he cut caught up the oneshe had severed as they whipped around and fell back. The ones he cut only servedto cross over strands beyond and reinforce them. He was not simply failing, butin so doing helping to strengthen his executioner.“Lord Rahl—I need to get to you.”Cara clearly understood the deadly nature of the threat he was under and wantedto find a way to help get him out of the trouble. And, like him, she didn’treally have any idea what to do.“Cara, listen to me. If you get tangled in it, you’ll die. Stay away from it—andwhatever you do, don’t touch it with your Agiel. I’ll figure something out.”“Then hurry up and do it before it’s too late.”As if he wasn’t trying. “Just give me a minute to think.”Panting, trying to catch his breath, he put his back against the protection of alarge spruce tree close to his bedroll as he tried to figure out what to do toescape. There was not much room left around the tree, and not much time beforethat space, too, would be gone. Blood ran down his arms from the wounds wherethe dark substance had touched him. Those wounds burned and throbbed, making itdifficult to think. He needed a way to get across the sticky tangle, to get outof the middle of it, before it finally captured him for good.And then it came to him.Use the sword for what the sword could do best.Without wasting another moment, Richard stepped away from the tree, spun around,drew back, and with all his might swung the sword as hard as he could. Knowingthat his life depended on it, he put every bit of fury and energy behind theblade, driving it with all his power. The tip whistled as it came round withlightning speed.The blade crashed through the tree with a loud boom that sounded like alightning strike and did just as much damage. The tree’s trunk shattered. Jaggedsplinters flew everywhere. Long fragments spiraled through the air. Smallerchips and a shower of bark were netted by the sticky tangle beyond.The mighty spruce groaned as the towering crown pulled itself through thetangled canopy above as the tree began to topple. With gathering speed, itplunged through the tight stand of trees, ripping thick branches from othertrees as the great weight of the spruce dropped through the crowded forest.As the tree fell, it ripped the strands where the trunk rose through the tangledweb above him, pulling gummy ropes along with it, and then it crashed down atopthe entanglement of sticky strands, whipping them down against the ground,burying them under the trunk and the thick thatch of limbs.Before the web had time to re-form or heal itself and close the yawning gap,Richard leaped up onto the trunk even as it was still rebounding from hittingthe ground. He held his arms out and crouched for balance. The rain was pickingup and the trunk of the tree was slippery. As the great trunk bounced andsettled to the ground, and limbs, bark, branches, needles, and leaves stillrained down on him, Richard used the opportunity to race across the length ofthe spruce, using it like a bridge to cross the sticky net.Panting, he reached Cara, free at last of the trap. Cara, having seen himcoming, had climbed up on a stout limb to be ready to help him across. Sheseized his arm to keep him from falling on the wet bark as he ran through thesnarl of branches.“What in the world is going on?” Cara asked through the roar of the downpour asshe helped him down to the ground.Richard was still trying to catch his breath. “I have no idea.”“Look,” she said, pointing at his sword.The gummy substance still stuck to his sword had begun melting away in the rain.The mass of strands tangled all through the woods were also beginning to softenand sag. As strands came apart, the rain beat the net down, pulling yet more ofthe long, thick fibers from the trees. It dropped to the ground in dark masses,where it hissed in the rain and melted like the first snow of the season failingto survive as the storm turned back to rain.In the gray dawn Richard could see the extent of the mass that had woven its wayaround him. It was an immense snarl. When the tree ripped the weave of the meshopen at the top it seemed to have undone the integrity of the whole thing,causing its weight to tear itself apart and collapse.With the cold rain coming down harder all the time, the dark strands were washedfrom the branches and brush. They lay on the ground looking like nothing so muchas the dark viscera of some great dead monster.Richard wiped his sword on wet bushes and grasses until the sticky substance wasall off.The mass on the ground melted away with increasing speed, evaporating into agathering gray fog. Back in the shadows of the trees, like steam rising from theentrails of a fresh corpse on a winter day, that dark fog slowly lifted from theground. Carried on a faint breeze that had come up, murky patches drifted awaybeyond the thick veil of trees.Back in the cover of trees, that dark fog shifted abruptly in some vague mannerthat Richard couldn’t quite follow, solidifying into an inky black shadow. In aflash, before he could make sense of it, that sinister apparition disintegratedinto a thousand fluttering shapes that darted off in every direction, as if adark phantom were decomposing into the rainy shadows and mist. In an instantthey were gone.A chill ran up Richard’s spine.Cara stared in astonishment. “Did you see that?”Richard nodded. “It looked something like what the thing back in Altur’Rang didafter it came though the walls after me. It disappeared in much the same wayjust before it would have had me.”“Then it has to be the same beast.”In the early morning downpour, Richard surveyed the shadows among the trees allaround them. “That would be my guess.”Cara, too, watched the woods all around for any sign of threat. “Lucky for usthe rain came when it did.”“I don’t think it was the rain that did it.”She wiped water from her eyes. “Then what did?”“I don’t know for sure, but maybe just the fact that I escaped its trap.”“I can’t imagine a beast with that kind of power being so easily discouraged—thelast time or this time.”“I don’t have any other ideas. I know someone who might, though.” He took Caraby the arm. “Come on. Let’s get our things together and get out of here.”She gestured off through the woods. “You go get the horses. Let me pack up ourbedrolls. We can dry them out later.”“No, I want us out of this place right now.” He quickly pulled a shirt out ofhis pack, along with a cloak to try to keep relatively dry. “We’ll leave thehorses. With them fenced into a place where they have grass and water they’ll befine where they are for a while.”“But the horses would get us away from here faster.”Richard kept an eye on the surrounding woods as he stuffed his arms through thesleeves of his shirt. “We can’t take them over the mountain pass—it’s too narrowin places—and we can’t take horses down into Agaden Reach where Shota lives.They can get a needed rest while we go see the witch woman. Then, when we findout what Shota knows about where Kahlan is, we can come back and get the horses.Maybe Shota will even know how we can get rid of this beast that’s followingme.”Cara nodded. “Makes sense, except I’d rather get out of here as quickly as wecan and horses would help in that.”Richard squatted down and started rolling up his sodden bedroll. “I agree withthe sentiment, but the pass is close and the horses can’t make it over, so let’sjust get moving. Like I said, the horses need a rest anyway or they’re not goingto be any good to us.”Cara stuffed the few things she had out back into her pack. She, too, pulled outa cloak. She lifted the pack by a strap and threw it up onto a shoulder. “We’llneed to get things out of our saddlebags, back with the horses.”“Leave them. I don’t want to have to carry any more than we must; it would justslow us down.”Cara gazed off through the veil of rain. “But someone might steal our supplies.”“Thieves won’t come near Shota.”She frowned up at him. “Why not?”“Shota and her companion walk these woods. She’s a rather intolerant woman.”“Oh great,” Cara muttered.Richard swung his pack around onto his back and started out. “Come on. Hurry.”She scurried after him. “Have you ever considered that maybe the witch woman ismore dangerous than the beast?”Richard glanced back over his shoulder. “You’re a regular little miss sunshinethis morning, aren’t you?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37The rain had turned to snow after they’d climbed out of the dense forest andmade it into the crooked wood at the transition out of the tree line. Because ofthe harsh conditions common at that elevation, the stunted trees, mantled inmeager vegetation, grew in bizarre, windblown shapes. Walking through thecrooked wood was like passing among the petrified forms of desiccated soulswhose limbs were frozen for all time in tormented stances, as if they hademerged from their graves only to find their feet forever anchored in hallowedground, preventing them from ever escaping the temporal world.While there were those who would not enter the surreal world of the crooked woodwithout some form of mystical protection, Richard wasn’t superstitious about theplace. In fact, he considered all such beliefs to be the refuge of the willfullyignorant. Richard saw through the trappings to what lay beneath allsuperstition—nothing less than the call to surrender to the view of man ashelpless in accomplishing his own ends and dealing with the reality of the worldaround him in order to further his own survival, instead embracing the notionthat he existed only at the whim of vague and unknowable forces that can only bepersuaded to stay their cruel and merciless impulses if man falls to his kneesin supplication, or, if they have to enter a spiritual place, by carrying theproper fetish.While Richard had always found it eerie being in a crooked wood, he knew what itwas and why it had grown to be that way, even if it still fell rather hauntingto be in such a place. He was aware that there were basically two ways to dealwith that primordial emotion. The superstitious solution was to carry sacredtalismans and amulets to ward off spiteful demons and incomprehensible darkforces thought to inhabit such places, hoping that the fates would be persuadedto kindly stay their fickle hand. Even though people proclaimed with completeconfidence that such mysterious forces were fundamentally unknowable to meremortals, they nonetheless passionately believed, without evidence, that theycould be certain that the power of charms would soothe the savage temper ofthose menacing forces, insisting that faith was all that was necessary—as iffaith were a mystical plaster with the power to patch over all the yawning holesin their convictions.Believing in free will, Richard instead chose the second way of dealing withsuch fear, which was to be watchful, alert, and ready to take responsibility forhis own survival and life. At its core, that battle of belief between the cruelfates and free will was his essential disagreement with prophecy and why hediscounted it. To choose to believe in fate was at once an admission of freewill and at the same time an abdication of one’s responsibility to it.As he and Cara passed through the crooked wood, Richard kept a watchful eye outbut he saw no legendary beasts or vengeful ghosts. Only the wind-borne snowwandered the wood.Having traveled at a breakneck pace for so long in the oppressive heat andhumidity of summer, they found that the encounter with bitter cold high up inthe mountain pass made the effort of the climb all the more difficult,especially after being drenched by the miserable rain. Despite being fatiguedfrom the altitude, Richard knew that, as wet as they were, they had to keepmoving at a brisk pace to keep warm or the cold could easily overcome them. Hewas well aware that the seductive song of the cold could entice people to stopand lie down for a rest, luring them to surrender to sleep and the death thatwaited under its inviting cloak. As Zedd had once told him, dead was dead.Richard knew that he would be no less dead from the cold than he would be froman arrow.More than that, though, he and Cara were both eager to put distance between themand the trap that had nearly captured him back at their camp. His burns from thebrief contact with his would-be death trap had blistered. He shuddered to thinkof what had nearly happened.At the same time, he was leery about going to see Shota in her lair at AgadenReach. The last time he had been in the Reach she had told him that if he evercame back there she would kill him. Richard didn’t doubt her word or her abilityto carry out the threat. Even so, he believed Shota would be his best chance ofgetting the kind of help necessary to find Kahlan.He was desperate to find someone who could tell him something useful, and aftergoing through a list of things he might do, people he might go to, and in theend he couldn’t come up with anyone else who could be as potentially informativeas Shota. Nicci hadn’t been able to offer any solutions. Zedd, he knew, might beable to help him in some ways, and maybe there were others with the capacity tobe able to add some piece to the puzzle, but to Richard’s mind, when all wassaid and done, none of them were as likely as Shota to be able to point him inthe right direction. That alone made the choice simple.When he glanced up, Richard briefly saw the snowcap through gaps in the drivingsnow. Some distance off, over the open, broken ground of the steep slope, thetrail over the pass would skirt the lower reaches of the mountain’s year-roundicy mantle. The clouds, laden with moisture, clung to the soaring gray rock. Thelow trailers of mist and fog dragging past left visibility limited in mostplaces and nearly nonexistent in others. It was just as well; the precipitousdrop-offs in spots along the infrequently used and increasingly slippery trailoffered frightening glimpses down the towering mountainside.When a fresh flight of icy gusts carried curtains of wet snow into their faces,Richard pulled his cloak tight against the buffeting onslaught. Out of the coverof the trees, making their way across the loose scree, they had to lean not onlyinto the steep incline, but into the wind. Richard hunched a shoulder, trying tokeep the icy wet sting off his face. Wind-driven snow built a brittle crust onone side of his cloak.With wind howling through the mountain pass, talking was difficult at best. Thealtitude and the exertion left them both winded and in no condition to be ableto easily carry on a conversation. Just getting the air they needed was effortenough and he could tell by the look on Cara’s face that she felt just asnauseated by the altitude as he did.Richard wasn’t in the mood to talk, anyway. He’d been talking to Cara for daysand it never got him anywhere. Cara, for her part, seemed just as frustrated byhis questions as he was by her answers. He knew that she thought his questionswere absurd; he thought her answers were. The inconsistencies and gaps in Cara’srecollection were at first disappointing and confounding but eventually theybecame maddening. Several times he’d had to bite his tongue and remind himselfthat she was not doing it to be malicious. He knew that if Cara could havehonestly said what he wanted to hear she would have eagerly done so. He knew,too, that if she lied it would be of no help in getting Kahlan back. He neededthe truth; that, after all, was why he was going to see Shota.Richard had systematically gone through of long list of times when Cara had beenwith him and Kahlan. Cara, though, remembered events that should have beenmomentous to her in ways that were not consistent with what had really happened.In a number of cases, such as the time he had gone to the Temple of the Winds,Cara simply didn’t recall key parts of the circumstances in which Kahlan hadbeen involved. In other instances, Cara remembered events very differently fromhow they had actually happened.Happened, at least, as Richard remembered them. There were depressing momentswhen he sank into a despondent fear that it was he who was for some reason theone with the problem. Cara thought that it was he who was remembering thingsthat had never taken place. Although she didn’t try to put too fine an edge toher convictions, the more things he brought up the more she thought hisdelusions about a fantasy wife were cropping up everywhere in his memory likeweeds after a rain.But Richard’s clear memory of events and the way those events were knit tightlytogether always brought him back to the solid conviction that Kahlan was real.Cara’s memory about certain incidents was very clear and very different fromhis, while in regard to other things her memory was agonizingly fuzzy. That hisstory of situations was so different from her memory of those same situationsonly served, in Cara’s mind, to further convince her that he was even moredelusional than she had previously realized or feared. While that obviouslysaddened her, he’d continued to press her.At his and Kahlan’s wedding, Cara had been the only Mord-Sith in attendance.Richard knew that such an event had been significant to her in more ways thanone, yet Cara remembered only that she’d gone with him to the Mud People’svillage. And why did they go there if not for the wedding? Cara said that shedidn’t know for certain why he’d gone there, but she was sure that he had hisreasons; her duty was to go where he went and protect him, not to question hismotive every time he turned around. Richard wanted to pull his hair out.Cara didn’t remember that she, Kahlan, and Richard had traveled together to thewedding site in the sliph. At the time Cara had been apprehensive about climbingdown into the sliph’s well and breathing in what appeared to be livingquicksilver. Yet now she had no awareness that Kahlan had helped her overcomeher anxiety about traveling within such a creature of magic. Cara rememberedZedd being there at the Mud people’s village, and Shota making a briefappearance, but instead of the witch woman coming to offer Kahlan the necklaceas a wedding gift and truce, Cara only recalled Shota being there tocongratulate Richard on stopping the plague by going to the Temple of the Winds.When Richard questioned Cara about Wizard Marlin, the assassin Jagang had sent,she clearly remembered him coming to kill Richard, but not any of the partswhere Kahlan had been involved. When he asked how in the world she thought hecould have even gotten to the Temple of the Winds in the first place, or how hehad been cured of the plague, were it not for Kahlan’s help, Cara only shruggedand said “Lord Rahl, you’re a wizard, you know about such things—I don’t. I’msorry, but I can’t tell you how you managed to accomplish astonishing thingswith your gift. I don’t know how magic works. I only know that you did it. Ionly remember you doing what you had to do in order to make things work out—andthey did, so I must be right. I could no more easily tell you how you healed me;I only know that you used your gift and you did it. You were the magic againstmagic, as is your duty to us. I simply don’t recall this woman being any part ofit. For your sake I wish I did, but I don’t.”For every single instance where Kahlan had been present, Cara remembered iteither differently or not at all. For every one of those events, she had ananswer to explain it away with an alternate version or, when that would havebeen impossible, simply didn’t recall what he was talking about. To Richard,there were a thousand little inconsistencies in her version that just didn’t addup or make sense; to Cara’s mind, it seemed not only simple and clear, butstraightforward.To say that it was exasperating trying to convince Cara of the reality ofKahlan’s existence would not begin to touch the depth of his frustration.Because it was pointless to continue to remember significant events in an effortto try to help her remember, when it never did any good, Richard had lostinterest in trying to bring Cara around to reality. She simply didn’t recallKahlan. It seemed that her mind had healed over missing chunks of what hadreally happened.Richard realized that there had to be an actual, rational cause, possibly somekind of spell or something, that was altering her memory—altering everyone’smemory. He was coming to accept the fact that if that was the case, and it hadto be, that there simply was no single event, or body of events, that he wasgoing to be able to question her about that would being back Cara’s memory.What was worse, he was realizing, was that such attempts to make her—or anyoneelse—remember were actually a dangerous distraction from the effort of findingKahlan.Richard glanced back to make sure that Cara was staying close to him on thesteep mountainside. One didn’t have to go far up in the jagged mountains ringingAgaden Reach to find a cliff to fall off of. With loose scree lurking beneaththe coating of fresh snow it would be easy to lose their footing and tumble downthe slope.He didn’t want to chance losing contact with Cara in the poor visibility. Withthe howl of the wind it would be hard to hear voices calling out if they becameseparated, and their tracks would be covered over in mere moments by theblowing, drifting snow. When he saw that Cara was within an arm’s length, hepushed on ahead into the teeth of the wind.As he went over it all in his mind, it occurred to him that by constantly tryingto think of some incident that Cara, or those closest to him, would surely haveto remember, he was falling into the trap of devoting his thoughts and effortsto the problem rather than the solution. Ever since he had been young, Zedd hadcautioned him to keep his sights on the goal—to think of the solution—and notthe problem.Richard vowed to himself that he would keep his focus exclusively on the problemand disregard the distractions created by Kahlan’s disappearance. Cara, Nicci,and Victor all had answers to explain away the inconsistencies. None of themremembered the things that Richard knew had happened. By dwelling on thespecifics of what he had done with Kahlan, and going round and round with peopleover how it was impossible for them to have forgotten such important events, hewas only letting the solution slip farther and farther away from him—lettingKahlan’s life slip farther and farther away from him.He needed to get a grip on his feelings, stop agonizing over the problem, andconcentrate exclusively on the solution.But setting his feelings aside was so difficult. It was almost like tellinghimself to forget Kahlan even as he looked for her. Memory had played a centralpart in his life with her. Going to see Shota only served to bring much of itback to him. He had met Shota for the first time when Kahlan had taken him tosee the witch woman in order to ask for her help in finding the last missing boxof Orden after Darken Rahl had put them in play.Kahlan was inextricably tied to his life in so many ways. He had, in a manner ofspeaking, known her as a Confessor ever since he had been a boy, long before hemet the woman herself that day in the Hartland woods.When he had been a boy, George Cypher, the man who had raised him and whoRichard had at the time thought was his father, had told him that he had rescueda secret book from great peril by bringing it to Westland. His father had toldhim that there was grave danger to everyone as long as the book existed, but hecouldn’t bring himself to destroy the knowledge in it. The only way to eliminatethe danger of the book falling into the wrong hands and yet save the knowledgewas to commit the book to memory and then burn the book itself. He chose Richardfor the prodigious task of memorizing the entire book.Richard’s father took him to a secret place deep in the woods and, day afterday, week after week, watched Richard sit reading the book over countless timesas he worked to memorize it. His father never once looked in the book; that wasRichard’s responsibility.After a long period of reading and memorizing, Richard began to write down whathe’d memorized. He would then check it against the book. At first he made a lotof mistakes, but he continually improved. Each time, his father burned thepapers. Richard repeated the task untold times. His father often apologized forthe burden he was placing on Richard, but Richard never resented it; heconsidered it an honor to be entrusted by his father with such a greatresponsibility. Even though he was young and didn’t understand all of what heread, he was able to grasp what a profoundly important work it was. He alsorealized that the book involved complex procedures having to do with magic. Realmagic.In time, Richard eventually wrote the book out from beginning to end a hundredtimes without error before he was satisfied that he could never forget a singleword. He knew not only by the text of the book, but by its idiosyncratic syntax,that any word left out would spell disaster to the knowledge itself.When he assured his father that the entirety of the work was committed tomemory, they put the book back in the hiding place in the rocks and left it forthree years. After that time, when Richard was beyond his middle teens, theyreturned one fall day and uncovered the ancient book. His father said that ifRichard could write the whole book, without a single mistake, they could both besatisfied that it had been learned perfectly and they would together bum thebook. Richard wrote without hesitation from the beginning to the final word.When he checked his work against the book, it confirmed what he already knew: Hehad not made a single mistake.Together he and his father built a fire, stacking on more than enough wood,until the heat drove them back. His father handed him the book and told himthat, if he was sure, he should throw the book into the fire. Richard held TheBook of Counted Shadows in the crook of his arm, running his fingers over thethick leather cover. He held in his arms not just his father’s trust, but thetrust of everyone. Feeling the full weight of that responsibility, Richard castthe book into the fire. In that moment, he was no longer a child.When the book burned it gave off not only heat but cold, and it releasedstreamers of colored light and phantom forms. Richard knew that for the firsttime he had actually seen magic—not sleight of hand or the stuff of mysticism,but real magic that existed, real magic with its own laws of how it functionedjust like everything else that existed. And some of those laws had been in thebook he had memorized.But in the beginning, that day in the woods, when he had been a boy and for thefirst time lifted open the cover, Richard had, in a way, met Kahlan. The Book ofCounted Shadows began with the words Verification of the truth of the words ofThe Book of Counted Shadows, if spoken by another, rather than read by the onewho commands the boxes, can only be insured by the use of a Confessor…Kahlan was the last Confessor.The day he met her, Richard had been looking for clues to his father’s murder.Darken Rahl had put the boxes of Orden in play and in order to open them heneeded the information in The Book of Counted Shadows. He didn’t know that bythat time the information existed only in Richard’s mind, and that to verify ithe would need a Confessor: Kahlan.In a way, Richard and Kahlan had been bound together by that book, and theevents surrounding it, from the time Richard had first opened the cover andencountered the strange word “Confessor.”When he met Kahlan in the woods that day, it seemed to him that he had alwaysknown her. In a way, he had. In a way, she had played a part in his life, been apart of his thoughts, ever since he had been a boy.The day he first saw her standing on a path in the Hartland woods, his lifesuddenly became whole, even though at the time he had not known that she was thelast living Confessor. His choice to help her that day had been an act of freewill carried out before prophecy had a chance to have its say.Kahlan was so much a part of him, so much a part of what was the world to him,what was life to him, that he could not imagine going on without her. He had tofind her. The time had come to go beyond the problem and seek the solution.A gust of icy wind made him squint and brought him out of his memories.“There,” he said, pointing.Cara paused behind him and peered over his shoulder into the swirling snow untilshe was able to make out the narrow pathway along the edge of the mountainside.When he glanced back she nodded, letting him know that she saw the path skirtingthe lower fringe of the snowcap.With the blowing snow starting to pile up, the path had begun to drift over.Richard was eager to get through it and to lower ground. As they went farther,conditions deteriorated and the only way he could make out the path was by thelay of the land. The snow had a gentle curve to it as the mountainside rose upfrom below on the left. It leveled out with a slight dip where the path was, andthen to the right humped up where the year-round snow rose higher up.As they trudged through the ankle-deep snow, Richard glanced back over hisshoulder. “This is the highest point. It will start going downhill soon and thenit will get warmer.”“You mean we’ll be back in the rain before we even have a chance to get down tolower altitudes and get warm,” she grumbled. “That’s what you’re telling me.”Richard understood all too well her discomfort, but could offer no prospect ofrelief anytime soon.“I guess so,” he said.Suddenly, something small and dark skittered down out of the white curtains ofsnow. Just as he saw it, and before he had a chance to react, it knockedRichard’s feet right out from under him."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38Richard saw the ground flash past his face as his legs flipped up in the air,then all he could see was white. For an instant he couldn’t tell up from down orwhere he was in relation to anything else.And then his full weight came crashing to the ground, the momentum pitching himdown the slope. The snow offered little cushion. His breath was driven from hislungs. Rolling over and over he saw only brief glimpses of the ground. The worldspun crazily. He couldn’t control or stop what he quickly realized was histumbling descent down an increasingly steep slope.It had all happened so unexpectedly and so fast that Richard hadn’t had muchtime to brace for the fall. At that moment, inattention seemed a poor excuse andno comfort. He bounced over a knob of hard ground and landed on his chest. Withthe wind knocked out of him, he tried to gasp a breath as he slid face-firstdown the mountain, but instead of air he got only a mouthful of icy snow.With the force of the fall and the precipitous angle of the incline, there wasnothing at hand to help stop him as he skidded with increasing speed down thesteep incline. Heading downward face-first made it all the more difficult totake effective action. In a frantic attempt to stop or at least slow his fall,Richard spread his arms. He fought to dig his hands and feet into the snow andscree to slow his out of control plunge down the side of the mountain, but thesnow and the scree only began to slide along with him.He saw a shadow flash by. Over the sound of the wind he could hear wild screamsof rage. Something solid slammed into the back of his ribs. He dug his fingersand boots deeper into the scree beneath the snow, trying to slow his frighteningslide. With the snow billowing up around him as he slid, he couldn’t seenanything but white.The dark shape again came flying out of the swirling snow. Again somethinghammered into him, only this time it was much harder and it was a direct blow tohis kidneys meant to help accelerate his plunging Call.Richard cried out with the shock of pain. As he twisted in distress onto hisright side, he heard the unique ring of steel as the Sword of Truth was yankedfrom its scabbard.As he slid down the slope, Richard twisted and reached for the sword as it wastorn away from him. He knew that if he were to grab the razor-sharp blade itselfit could easily slice his hand in two, so he tried instead to seize the hilt orat least snag the crossguard, but he was too late. The assailant dug in hisheels to stop himself as Richard sailed out of sight.Twisting awkwardly as he reached for his sword left Richard even more offbalance. As he bounced over the uneven ground he was thrown into a headfirstroll.In the middle of pitching over, just as he started spreading his arms and legsto stop the tumbling, if nothing else, his back slammed into a jut of rock underthe snow. Again the wind was violently driven from him, only this time morepainfully.The force of the impact flipped him over the obstruction.Tingling dread surged through him as he found himself in midair. With franticeffort, Richard reached out and snatched the rock outcropping he had hit. Heheld fast as his legs whipped out and over a drop-off.Richard clutched the rock with frantic strength. For a moment, he clung to therock, collecting his wits and gulping air. He had at least stopped falling. Snowand small flakes of scree still sliding down the steep slope bounced off therock he was holding as well as his arms and head.Carefully, he swung his legs all around, trying to catch them up onto something,trying to find some support for his weight. There was nothing. He swunghelplessly, a living pendulum clutching a knob of icy rock.He glanced over his shoulder and saw blowing snow and dark clouds scudding byunderneath him. Through a brief gap, he spotted bits of scree in the midst of along fall through the air toward trees and rock far below.Above him, feet spread, stood a short, dark form with long arms, a pallid head,and gray skin. Bulging yellow eyes, like twin lanterns glowing out from themurky bluish light of the snowstorm, glared down at him. Bloodless lips curledback in a grin to expose sharp teeth.It was Shota’s companion, Samuel.He was gripping Richard’s sword in one hand and looked more than content withhimself. Samuel wore a dark brown cloak that flapped like a flag of victory inthe wind. He backed away a few paces, waiting to sec Richard fall from themountain.Richard’s fingers were slipping. He tried to get his arms around the rocks toclimb up, or at least get a better hold. He wasn’t successful. Ho knew, though,that if he did manage to get a better hold, Samuel stood ready to use the swordto insure that Richard fell.With his feet dangling over a drop of at least a thousand feet, Richard was in avery precarious and vulnerable position. He could hardly believe that Samuel hadgotten the better of him in such a way—and that he had managed to snatchRichard’s sword. He surveyed the gloomy gray trailers of fog carried along withthe blowing snow but he didn’t see Cara.“Samuel!” Richard screamed into the wind. “Give me back my sword!”Even to himself, it seemed a pretty ridiculous demand.“My sword,” Samuel hissed.“And what do you think Shota would say?”The bloodless lips widened with his smile. “Mistress not here.”Like a wraith materializing out of the substance of the shadows themselves, adark shape appeared behind Samuel. It was Cara, her dark cloak billowing in thewind, giving her the aspect of a vengeful spirit. Richard realized that she hadprobably followed his rolling trail down through the snow. What with theblustery wind in his ears and, more importantly, his gaze riveted on Richard’spredicament, Samuel didn’t notice Cara looming behind him.In a single glance she took in the ominous sight of Samuel gripping Richard’ssword, standing above Richard as he clung to the edge of the cliff. Richard hadlearned in the past that Samuel’s attention and actions were pretty firmly ruledby his rampant emotions; his feet just followed. With the gleeful distraction ofhaving the object of his rabid hatred at the point of a sword he’d once carriedand to this day coveted, Samuel was too busy gloating to watch for the Mord-Sithshowing up behind him.Without a word, Cara unceremoniously rammed her Agiel into the base of Samuel’sneck at the back of his skull. With the slippery conditions, she couldn’tmaintain the contact.Samuel shrieked in pain and sudden, confused terror as he dropped the sword andtoppled back into the snow. Writhing in agony, not understanding what hadhappened, he pawed frantically at the back of his neck where Cara had pressedher Agiel. He squealed as he Hopped in the snow like a fish in sand. Richardknew that the horrifying shock of pain from an Agiel when applied in that spotfell like a lightning strike.Richard recognized the look on Cara’s face as she started to lean over thesquirming figure. She intended to used her Agiel to finish Samuel.Richard wouldn’t really care if she killed the treacherous companion to thewitch woman, but he had far more urgent problems right then.“Cara! I’m hanging on the edge of a cliff. I can’t hold on. I’m slipping.”She immediately snatched up the sword from beside a thrashing Samuel so that hecouldn’t get at it as she ran to help Richard. Stabbing the blade in the groundbeside herself, she dropped down, braced her boots against the rocks, and seizedhis arms. She had not been an instant too soon.With her help, Richard was able to get a better grip on the rocks. With both ofthem struggling in the difficult conditions, he at last managed to hook his armover the outcropping. Once he had a firm hold with an arm he was finally able toswing a leg up and hook it over the rocks. Cara grabbed his belt and helped haulhim up. Straining with effort, he dragged himself up and over the slipperyoutcropping.Richard sagged over onto his side, gasping, trying to get enough of the thinair. “Thanks,” he managed.Cara glanced back over her shoulder, keeping an eye on Samuel. Richard quicklygathered his strength and staggered back to his feet. As soon as he had hisfooting at the brink of the cliff, he pulled up his sword from where Cara hadstuck it in the ground.He could hardly believe that Samuel had managed to catch him off guard that way.Ever since Richard and Cara had left their camp that morning, he’d been watchingfor Samuel to show up unexpectedly. He knew, though, that despite expecting suchan attack, it was impossible to forestall it every moment—much as it had beenimpossible to stop every arrow that morning that Kahlan had disappeared.Richard brushed some of the snow off his face. The tumbling fall, the suddenplunge, and hanging by his fingers over a cliff had left him shaken but, morethan anything, angry.Samuel, still lying crumpled in the snow, wriggling and squirming, pulled tohimself, mumbling something Richard couldn’t hear over the sound of the wind.When Samuel saw Richard stalking toward him, he scrambled awkwardly to his feet,still suffering from the lingering pain. Despite that pain, though, he saw whathe wanted.“Mine! Gimme! Gimme my sword!”Richard lifted the point toward the disgusting little fellow.Seeing the point of the blade approaching, Samuel lost his courage and scuttleda few steps backward up the slope. “Please,” he whined, holding his hands out toward Richard’s wrath, “no kill me?”“What are you doing here?”“Mistress sends me.”“Shota sent you to kill me, did she?” Richard mocked. He wanted Samuel to admitthe truth.Samuel vigorously shook his head. “No, not to kill you.”“So then that was all your idea.”Samuel didn’t answer.“Why, then?” Richard pressed. “Why did Shota send you?”Samuel eyed Cara as she moved to the side, halfway hemming him in. Samuel hissedat her, showing his teeth. Cara, unimpressed, showed him her Agiel. His eyesgrew big with fear.“Samuel!” Richard yelled.Samuel’s yellow eyes turned back to Richard and they again turned hateful.“Why did Shota send you?”“Mistress…” he whimpered as his anger flagged. He stared off longingly in thedirection of Agaden Reach. “She sends companion.”“Why!”Samuel flinched when Richard yelled and took an aggressive stride forward.Samuel, trying to keep watch on both of them, pointed a long finger al Cara.“Mistress say for you to bring pretty lady.”This was a surprise—for two reasons. “Pretty lady” was what Samuel had alwayscalled Kahlan.Secondly, Richard would never have expected that Shota would want Cara to comedown into Agaden Reach with him. He found that somehow troubling.“Why does she want the pretty lady to come with me?”“Don’t know.” Samuel’s bloodless lips pulled back in a grin. “Maybe to killher.”Cara waggled her Agiel for him to see. “If she tries, maybe she will get a lotmore than you got. Maybe I’ll kill her, instead.”Samuel squealed in horror, his bulging eyes going wide. “No! No kill mistress!”“We didn’t come to harm Shota,” Richard told him. “But we will defendourselves.”Samuel pressed his knuckles to the ground as he leaned toward Richard. “We willsee,” he growled with contempt, “what mistress does with you, Seeker.”Before Richard could answer, Samuel suddenly darted off into the swirling snow.It was surprising how fast he could move.Cara started after him, but Richard caught her arm to stop her.“I’m in no mood to go running after him,” he said. “Besides, it’s unlikely we’llcatch him. He knows the trail and we aren’t familiar with it. We can’t followhis tracks as fast as he can make them. Besides, he will be heading back toShota and that’s where we’re going anyway. No use to waste our energy when we’llcatch up with him in the end.”“You should have let me kill him.”Richard started up the slope toward the trail. “I would have, but I can’t fly.”“I suppose,” she conceded with a sigh. “Are you all right?”Richard nodded as he slid the sword home into its scabbard, putting away, too,the flush of hot anger. “Thanks to you.”Cara flashed him a self-satisfied smile. “I keep telling you, you couldn’t getalong without me.” She glanced around in the gray-blue murk. “What if he triesthat again?”“Samuel is basically a coward and an opportunist. He only attacks when he thinksyou’re helpless. He is without any redeeming qualities as far as I can tell.”“Why would a witch woman keep him around?”“I don’t know. Maybe he’s just a sycophant and she enjoys the groveling. Maybeshe lets him stay around to run errands for her. Maybe Samuel is the only onewho would willingly be her companion. Most people are terrified of Shota andfrom what I hear no one will come near this place.Although, from what Kahlan told me, witch women can’t help bewitchingpeople—it’s just the way they are. Even if they didn’t, Shota is certainlyseductive in her own right so I imagine that if she really wanted a worth whilecompanion, she could have her pick.“Now that we’ve driven him off, I really doubt that Samuel would have thecourage to attack again. He’s delivered Shota’s message. Now that we’ve scaredhim, and hurt him, he will probably want to run back to Shota’s protection.Besides, he probably thinks she may kill us and he’d be just as happy to haveher do it.”Cara stared off into the swirling snow for a moment before following Richard upthe steep slope. “Why do you think Shota would send a messenger to make surethat I come with you down into Agaden Reach?”Richard found the trail and started down it. He saw Samuel’s footprints but theywere already filling in with the blowing snow.“I don’t know. That part has me puzzled.”“And why does Samuel think that your sword belongs to him?”Richard slowly let out a deep breath. “Samuel carried the sword before me. Hewas the last Seeker before me—although not a legitimately named Seeker. I don’tknow how he acquired the Sword of Truth. Zedd came into Agaden Reach and took itback. Samuel believes that the sword still be longs to him.”Cara looked incredulous. “He was the last Seeker?”Richard cast her a meaningful look. “He didn’t have the magic, the temperament,or the character required by the sword to be the true Seeker of Truth. Becausehe wasn’t able to be the master of the sword’s power, that power changed himinto what you see today.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39With one finger, Richard swiped the sweat and drizzle from his brow. Littlelight penetrated the gloom at the lower stories of the swamp, hut even withoutthe sun beating down on them the steamy heat was oppressive. After coming downfrom the storm raging up in the mountain pass, Richard didn’t mind the heat somuch as he otherwise might have. Cara wasn’t complaining, either, but then sherarely did about her own discomfort. As long as she was near him she wassatisfied, although whenever he did anything she considered risky, it did tendto make her ill-tempered, which explained her irritable disposition about goingto see Shota.Here and there in the mud and soft ground of the forest floor, Richard saw freshfootprints left by Samuel. It was clear to Richard that Shota’s companion hadbeen eager to get back to her protection and had hurried along the trail at aconstant lope. Cara, too, saw the tracks. Richard had been impressed when shehad pointed them out when she’d first spotted them. She had been more observantof tracks ever since the day Kahlan had disappeared and Richard had shown her,Nicci, and Victor some of the kinds of things that tracks revealed.Even though Samuel’s tracks made it clear that he had been rushing and it didn’tlook like he intended to try to jump them again, Richard and Cara still keptcareful watch in case he, or anything else, were to be lurking in the shadows.The swamp was, after all, a place meant to keep intruders away. Richard wasn’tsure just what waited back under cover of leaf and shadow, but people in theMidlands, including wizards, didn’t Tear to come into Shota’s sanctuary withoutsound reason.It was no longer raining, but as foggy and humid as it was it might as well havebeen. The forest canopy collected the mist and drizzle, releasing it assporadic, fat drops. Broad leaves on long arching stalks sprouting up from thetangled growth at the forest floor and vines twisting through the branches oftrees all around bobbed under the assault of those heavy drops, giving the wholeforest a constant, nodding movement in the still air.The trees in the swamp grew in gnarled, twisted shapes, as if tormented by theload of vines and curtains of moss that hung limp and heavy from their branchesin the mist. Crusty lichen and in places black slime grew on the bark. Here andthere, in the distance, Richard spotted birds perched on the branches, watching.Vapor hovered just above the surface of stagnant expanses of murky water runoffcollected in the lap of the mountains. At the water’s edge tangles of rootssnaked down into the depths. Things moved through the dark pools, lifting thefilm of duckweed on the slow rolling waves. From the shadows back across thewater, eyes watched.All around the cacophonous calls of birds rang though the damp air while Richardand Cara had to swish at the bugs buzzing around them. Other animals back in themist let out whoops and whistles. At the same time, the thick, still vegetationand the oppressive, muggy, weight of the air lent the place a kind of uneasystillness. Richard saw Cara wrinkle her nose at the pervasive, rotting stench.The path through the dense growth almost seemed more like a living, growingtunnel. Richard was glad they didn’t have to venture off the trail and back intothe surrounding quagmire. He could imagine all too well claws and fangs waitingpatiently for dinner to happen by.When they reached the brink of the gloomy swamp, Richard paused in the deepshadows. Peering out of the dark tangle of branches, hanging moss, and clinginggreen growth was like looking out from a cave at a glorious new day beyond.Despite the drizzle and mist up in the swamp, the late-day sun had brokenthrough the cloud cover in places to cast golden shafts of sunlight on thedistant valley, as if were a jewel on display.Around the verdant valley the rocky gray walls of the surrounding mountainsascended almost straight up into a dark rim of clouds. As far as Richard knew,there was no way into Shota’s home but through the swamp. The valley floor belowwas spread with a rolling carpet of grasses dotted with wildflowers. Stands ofoak, maple, and beech mottled some of the hills and congregated in low placesalong the stream, their leaves shimmering in the late light.In the dark forest where Richard and Cara stood, it felt like standing in night,looking out on day. Not far off through the vines and brush, water tumbled offthe craggy rock in the edge of the swamp to disappear into vertical columns ofmist on its way down to the clear pools and streams far below where it made adistant roar that, at their height, sounded like-little more than a hiss. Thatspray and mist wet their faces as they gazed off the edge of the cliff.Richard led Cara through a narrow path off the main trail that simply ended atthe cliff. The small side track would be nearly impossible to find had he notknown where to look for it from his previous visit. It passed through a maze ofboulders nearly hidden beneath a layer of pale green ferns. Vines, moss, andbrush also helped conceal the obscure route.At the edge they finally began the descent. The trail down into the valley inlarge part was made up of steps, thousands of them, cut from the stone of thecliff wall itself. Those steps twisted and tunneled and turned ever downward,following the natural shape of the tiers of rock, sometimes following aroundsoaring natural stone columns, only to spiral back on themselves to passunderneath the pathway bridging above.The view on the way down the side of the cliff was spectacular. The streamscarrying mountain runoff meandering through gentle hills were as beautiful asany Richard had ever seen. The trees, in places gathered into bands and in otherspots standing alone as a single monarch atop a hill, were as calm and invitinga sight as he could hope for.In the distant center of the valley, set among a carpet of grand trees, was abeautiful palace of breathtaking grace and splendor. Delicate spires stretchedinto the air, wispy bridges spanned the high gaps between towers, and stairsspiraled around turrets. Colorful flags and streamers flew atop every point. Ifa majestic palace could be said to look feminine, this one did. It seemed afitting place for a woman like Shota.Other than his home of Hartland and the mountains to the west of there, where hehad taken Kahlan to recover over the span of a magical summer, Richard had neverseen another place to compare to this valley. That alone had given him pause inhis judgment about Shota before he’d met her for the first time. Passing throughthe swamp back then, he had thought it a fitting place for a witch to live. Whenhe had been told that the valley was actually her home, he had thought that,surely, someone who could call such a peaceful, beautiful place home had to havesome good qualities. Later, when he had seen the beauty of the People’s Palace,Darken Rain’s home, he came to discount such indulgent notions.At the bottom of the cliff beside the waterfall a road led off through grassyfields to wind its way among the small hills. Before they took lo the road,though, Cara asked if they could take the opportunity for a quick dip to getclean.Richard thought it sounded like a good idea, so he stopped and took off hispack. Most importantly, he wanted to wash the painful burns so they would have abetter chance to heal. He was drenched in sweat and dirt and imagined that hemust look like a beggar.Kahlan had told him once that it was important to convey the proper impressionto people. She had wanted him to come up with something better than hiswoods-guide attire. At the time, she had been trying to tell him that if heexpected people to believe in him and follow him, if he was to be the Lord Rahland command the D’Haran Empire, he had to look the pail.Appearance, after all, was a reflection of what a person thought of themselvesand therefore, by extension, of others. A person crippled by self-loathing orself-doubt reflected those feelings in their appearance. Such visual clues didnot inspire confidence in others because, and while not always completelyaccurate, for the most part they did reflect the inner person—whether or notthat person realized it.No self-respecting bird in good health would allow its feathers to look ruffled.No confident cougar would let its fur long remain matted and dirty. A statuemeant to represent the nobility of man did not convey that concept by portrayinghim disheveled and dirty.Richard had understood Kahlan’s point, and, in fact, had already begun to see toit before she mentioned it. He had found most of an outfit from a former warwizard up in the Wizard’s Keep. He used the important elements of that outfitand had some other things made. He didn’t know how it impressed other people,but he remembered quite clearly how it had impressed Kahlan.Richard went around the rocks at the bottom of the waterfall to find a privateplace for a quick wash while Cara picked another spot for herself. She promisedthat she wouldn’t be long.The water felt soothing, but Richard didn’t want to waste any time. He had a lotmore important matters on his mind. Once rinsed clean of sweat and grime andafter cleaning the burns, he put on his war wizard’s outfit, which he had pulledfrom his pack. He thought that today, of all days, would be the proper day toappear to Shota as a leader come to speak with her, rather than a helplessbeggar.Over black trousers and a black, sleeveless shirt, he put on his black,open-sided tunic, decorated with symbols snaking along a wide gold band runningall the way around its squared edges. A wide, multilayered leather belt bearinga number of silver emblems in ancient designs held a gold-worked pouch to eachside and cinched the tunic at his waist. Pins on the leather lashing around thetops of his black boots also carried those symbols. He carefully placed theancient, tooled-leather baldric holding the polished gold- and silver-wroughtscabbard over his right shoulder and attached the Sword of Truth at his lefthip.While to most people the Sword of Truth was an awesome weapon, and it certainlywas that, it was much more to Richard. His grandfather, Zedd, in his capacity asFirst Wizard, had given the sword to Richard, naming him Seeker. In many waysthat trust was much the same as his father’s trust had been in asking him tomemorize the book. It had taken Richard a long time to come to fully understandall that the trust and responsibility of carrying the Sword of Truth meant.As a formidable weapon, the sword had saved his life countless times. But it hadnot saved his life because it came with redoubtable power, or because it wascapable of remarkable feats. It had saved his life because it had helped himlearn things not just about himself, but about life.To be sure, the Sword of Truth had taught him about fighting, about the dancewith death, and how to prevail against seemingly impossible odds. And while ithad helped him when he had to carry out that most terrible of allacts—killing—it had also helped him learn when forgiveness was justified. Inthose ways it had helped him come to understand what values were important inhelping to advance the cause of life itself. And it had helped him learn theimportance and necessity of judging those values, and of how to put each incontext.In some ways, like the way that learning The Book of Counted Shadows had taughthim that he was no longer a child, the sword had helped him learn to be a partof the wider world, and his place in it.It had, in a way, also brought him Kahlan.And Kahlan was why he needed to see Shota.Richard closed the flap on his pack. There was a cape, looking like it had beenspun from gold, that he’d found with the rest of the war wizard’s outfit up inthe Keep, but, since it was such a warm day, he left that in tin-pack. Finally,on each wrist he put on a wide, leather-padded silver band bearing linked ringsencompassing more of the ancient symbols. Amour other things, those ancientbands were used to call the sliph from her sleep.When Cara called out that she was ready, Richard lifted his pack and made hisway around the rocks. He saw, then, why she had wanted to stop She had done morethan simply take a quick bath.She had put on her red leather outfit.Richard cast a meaningful glance at the Mord-Sith’s bloodred uniform. “Shota maybe sorry she invited you to the party.”Cara’s smile said that if there was any trouble, she would see to it.As they started down the road, Richard said, “I don’t know exactly what powersShota has, but I think that maybe you should try something today that you havenever tried before.”Cara frowned. “What would that be?”“Caution.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40Richard scanned the surrounding hills, watching for any sign of danger, as heand Cara entered a place where the magnificent beech and maple trees had grownclustered together at the top of a rise. The straight, tall trunks forked everwider in gentle, ascending arcs, giving Richard the sense of massive columnsholding up the vaulted ceiling of a great, green cathedral. The fragrance ofwildflowers drifted in on a gentle breeze. Through the canopy of rustling leaveshe could get tantalizing glimpses of the soaring spires of Shota’s palace.Streamers of golden sunlight flickered through the leaves and cavorted around onthe low grass. Water from a spring burbled up through an opening in a lowboulder and ran down its smooth sides into a shallow, meandering stream. Spreadthrough the stream were rocks covered with a coat of fuzzy green moss.A woman with a thick mane of blond hair and wearing a long black dress sat inthe dappled sunlight on a rock beside the stream, leaning on one graceful arm asshe ran her fingers through the clear water. She seemed to glow. The very airaround her seemed to glow.Even with her back to him, she looked all too familiar.Cara leaned toward Richard and spoke in a confidential tone. “Is that Nicci?”“In a way I wish it were, but it isn’t.”“Are you sure?”Richard nodded. “I’ve seen Shota do this before. The first time I ever saw her,in that exact same place, she appeared to me as my deceased mother.”Cara glanced over at him. “That’s a rather cruel deception.”“She said that it was a gift, a kindness, meant only to briefly bring acherished memory to life.”Cara huffed skeptically. “So why would she be trying to make you rememberNicci?”Richard looked over at Cara, but didn’t have an answer for her.When they finally reached the rock, the woman gracefully rose and turned to him.Blue eyes he knew met his gaze.“Richard,” the woman who looked like Nicci said. Her voice had the exact samesilken quality as Nicci’s. The low neckline of the laced bodice seemed toRichard to be cut even lower than he recalled. “I’m so pleased to see youagain.” She rested her wrists on his shoulders, casually locking her fingerstogether behind his head. The air around her seemed filmy, giving her a soft,blurred, surreal appearance. “So very pleased,” she added with breathlessaffection.She could not have looked or sounded any more like Nicci if it had been Nicciherself. The illusion was so convincing that Cara stood with her jaw hanging.Richard almost felt a sense of relief at seeing Nicci again.Almost.“Shota, I’ve come to talk with you.”“Talk is for lovers,” she said, a coy smile seeping through her exquisitefeatures.She slipped her fingers into the hair at the back of his head as her soft smilewarmed affectionately. Her eyes, joining in her smile, reflected her delight atseeing him. She seemed at that moment more pleased, more quietly satisfied, moreat peace than he had ever seen Nicci look. She also looked so much like Niccithat he was having trouble convincing himself to keep in mind that it was Shota.If nothing else, she acted far more in character with Shota than with Nicci.Nicci would never be so forward. It had to be Shota.She gently pulled him closer. At that moment, Richard had trouble trying tothink of a reason to resist. None came presently to mind. He couldn’t stopgazing into her alluring eyes. He felt himself being swept away with the simplepleasure of gazing at Nicci’s entrancing face.“And if that is your offer, Richard, then I accept.”She had drifted so close to him that he could feel the sweet breath of her wordson his face. Her eyes closed. Her soft lips met his in a slow, luxurious kissthat he did not return. Nonetheless, he didn’t force her away, either.As her arms drew him tighter into the embrace, into the kiss, it seemed toscramble his thinking and completely immobilize him. Even more than the kiss,that embrace awakened a terrible longing for the comfort of steadfast support,sheltering devotion, and tender acceptance. More than anything, the promise ofthat long-absent solace was what disarmed him.He could feel every inch, every curve, every rise and fall of her firm bodypressing against his. He knew that he was trying to think of something otherthan that kiss, that embrace, that body, but he couldn’t for the life of himremember what it was. In fact, he was having a great deal of difficulty makinghimself think at all.It was because of that kiss. It was a kiss that made him forget who he was, orwhy he was there, even though, oddly enough, it didn’t seem to be a kiss thatnecessarily promised love, or even lust. He wasn’t sure what it promised. Italmost seemed to be conditional.One thing he did know was that it was very different from the kiss Nicci hadgiven him back in the stable in Altur’Rang just before he’d left. That kiss hadcarried the extraordinary pleasure and serenity of magic, if not other things.The real Nicci had been behind that kiss. Despite the visual illusion, this wasnot Nicci. This was a kiss that seemed irresistible, as a great weight might beirresistible, but not really all that… erotic. Even so, it threatened to tanglehim up in its cautious questions and silent promises.“Nicci—or Shota—or whoever you are,” Cara growled through clenched teeth, fistsat her sides, “just what do you think you’re doing?”She pulled away, turning her head slightly, her cheek resting against Richard’s,to gaze curiously at Cara. Delicate fingers idly twined their way through thehair at the back of his head. Richard’s mind was reeling.Cara backed away a bit as Shota-in-Nicci’s-skin, with her other hand, tenderlycupped the Mord-Sith’s chin.“Why, nothing more than what you want.”Cara backed another step so that her face would be out of range of thecomforting hand. “What?”“This is what you want, isn’t it? I would think that you would be grateful thatI’m helping you with your grand plan.”Cara planted her fists on her hips. “I don’t know what in the world you’retalking about.”“Why so angry?” The smile turned sly. “I didn’t come up with this. You did. Thisis your plan—the one you hatched all by yourself. I’m simply helping you bringit to life.”“What makes you think… ?” Cara seemed to run out of words.The blue-eyed gaze that looked so much like Nicci’s slid to Richard. The smilereturned as she studied his features from only inches away.“This young woman is such a dear friend and loyal protector. Has your dearfriend and loyal protector told you what she has all planned out for you,Richard?” She touched his nose. “Such plans, they are, too. She has the rest ofyour life all thought out and arranged for you. You really should ask hersometime what she is plotting for you.”Cara’s face suddenly went slack with understanding and then it went crimson.Richard grasped Shota by the shoulders and eased her back, forcing her hand toslip off his shoulder. At the same time he renewed his efforts to regain controlof himself.“You’ve already said it—Cara is my friend. I do not fear what she may want formy life. You see, despite what friends and loved ones want for me, or hope Iwill achieve, it’s my life and I decide what I will try to make of it. Peoplecan plan or hope all they want for those they care about, but in the end it iseach individual who must take responsibility for their own life and make thechoice for themselves.”Her wide smile showed her teeth. “How deliciously innocent you are to think suchthings.” Her fingers combed back his hair. “I would strongly advise you to askher what she is plotting to do with your heart.”Richard glanced to Cara. She looked at the same time on the verge of bothexploding in rage and fleeing in panic. Instead of either she stood her groundand kept quiet. Richard didn’t know what Shota was talking about, but he didknow that this was not the time or place to find out. He couldn’t allow Shota tolead him away from his purpose.He also noticed that Cara had a white-knuckled fist around her Agiel.“Shota, enough of this charade. Cara’s wishes and intentions are my concern, notyours.”Nicci smiled sadly. “So you think, Richard. So you think.”The hazy air around the woman shimmered and Nicci was no longer Nicci, butShota. She was no longer a dreamy phantasm, but a clear vision. Her hair,instead of blond, was just as thick but a wavy auburn. Her black dress hadchanged into a wispy, variegated gray, layered affair, cut just as low, withloose points that lifted ever so slightly in the breeze. She was every bit asbeautiful as the valley around her.As Shota turned her attention to Cara, her expression tightened dangerously.“You hurt Samuel.”“I’m sorry.” Cara said with a shrug. “I didn’t mean to hurt him.” Shota archedan eyebrow over her threatening glare, as if to say she didn’t believe a word ofit.“I meant to kill him,” Cara said.Shota’s anger melted away. An incandescent smile accompanied a genuine, ifbrief, laugh. She regarded Richard with a sidelong glance, the smile still onher lips.“I like her. You can keep her.”Richard recalled that Cara had once made that very same pronouncement to himabout Kahlan.“Shota, I told you, I have to talk to you.”Her bright, clear almond eyes took him in with a sense of wonder. “So you havecome offering to be my lover?”Richard noticed Samuel off through the trees, watching, his yellow eyes glowingwith hatred.“You know I haven’t.”“Ah.” Her smile returned. “What you mean to say, then, is that you have comebecause you want something from me.” She caught one of the floating points ofher dress. “Isn’t that right, Richard?”Richard had to remind himself to stop staring into her ageless eyes. But it wasso hard to make himself glance away. It was as if Shota controlled where hisgaze rested and he was having trouble keeping it resting in proper places.Kahlan had told him once that Shota had been bewitching him. Kahlan said thatShota couldn’t help it, it was just what witch women did. It came naturally tothem.Kahlan.That thought of her again jolted his mind.“Kahlan is missing.”Shota’s brow wrinkled ever so slightly. “Who?”Richard sighed. “Look, something terrible is going on. Kahlan, my wife—”“Wife! Since when did you take a wife?”Her expression curdled into a heated glare. By the sudden anger powering herfeatures and the way her cleavage heaved at the brink of the low-cut dress,Richard knew that she was not feigning surprise. She truly didn’t rememberKahlan.Richard ran his own fingers back through his hair as he gathered his thoughtsand started again.“Shota, you’ve met Kahlan several times. You know her quite well. Something hashappened to erase everyone’s memory of her. No one remembers her, you included,and—”“Except you?” she said with incredulity. “You alone remember her?”“It’s a long story.”“Length won’t make it true.”“It is true,” Richard insisted. He gestured heatedly. “You were at our wedding.”She folded her arms. “I don’t think so.”“The first time I came here, you had captured Kahlan and had covered her insnakes—”“Snakes.” Shota smiled. “You’re saying I liked this woman and are suggestingthat I treated her indulgently?”“Not exactly. You wanted her dead.”The smile widened. She returned her wrists to his shoulders. “Now, Richard,that’s awfully harsh, don’t you think?”Richard grasped her by the waist and gently moved her back. He knew that if hedidn’t stop her she would soon hamper his ability to think.“I certainly thought so,” he said. “Among other things, you didn’t want us towed.”Shota ran a red lacquered nail down his chest. She looked up at him from underher brow.“Well, maybe I had my reasons.”“Yes—you didn’t want us to bring a child into the world. You said we would becreating a monster because from me it would have the gift and from Kahlan itwould be a Confessor.”“Confessor!” Shota took a step back as if he had turned poisonous. “A Confessor?Are you out of your mind?”“Shota—”“There aren’t any more Confessors. They’re all dead.”“That’s not quite accurate. All of them are dead except Kahlan.”She turned to Cara. “Has he had a fever or something?”“Well… he was shot with an arrow. He nearly died. Nicci healed him but he wasstill unconscious for days.”Shota suspiciously held up a finger as if she had uncovered a devious plot.“Don’t tell me—she used Subtractive Magic.”“Yes, she did,” Richard answered in Cara’s place. “And because she did she wasable to save my life.”Shota took back the step she had put between them when she had retreated. “UsedSubtractive Magic…” Shota muttered to herself. She looked up at him again. “Howdid she use it—for what purpose?”“She used it to eliminate the barbed arrow embedded in me.”Shota rolled a hand, wanting him to continue. “She must have done somethingmore.”“She used Subtractive Magic to purge all the blood pooling in my chest. She saidthat there was no other way to get either the arrow or the blood out of me andeither would kill me if left in.”Shota turned her back to them and, one hand on a hip, walked off a few paces asshe considered the brief account.“That explains a great many things,” she said unhappily under her breath.“You gave Kahlan a necklace,” Richard said.Shota frowned back over her shoulder. “A necklace? What sort of necklace would Igive her? And why, my dear boy, do you imagine I would ever do such a thing foryour… lover?”“Wife,” Richard corrected. “You and Kahlan had spent time together—byyourselves—and had come to an understanding of sorts. You gave the necklace toKahlan as a gift so that she and I could… well, be together. It had some kind ofpower so that we wouldn’t conceive children. While I don’t agree with your viewof future events, right now, what with the war and all, we decided to acceptyour gift and the truce that went with it.”“I can’t imagine how you could possibly imagine that I would do any of thosethings.” Shota looked to Cara again. “Did he have a bad fever on top of theinjury?”Richard might have thought that Shota was being sarcastic, but he could see bythe look on her face that she was asking a serious question.“Not exactly a bad fever,” Cara said, hesitantly. “It was a slight fever. Niccisaid, though, that his problem was partly with how close he came to death butmostly had to do with the extended time that he was unconscious.” Cara soundedrather reluctant to speak about it to a person she considered a potentialthreat, but she at last finished her answer. “She said that he was sufferingfrom delirium.”Shota folded her arms as she heaved a sigh while taking him in with her almondeyes. “What am I to do with you,” she murmured half to herself.“The last time I was here,” Richard said, “you told me that if I ever came backinto Agaden Reach you would kill me.”She showed no reaction. “Did I, now. And why would I say such a thing?”“I guess you were rather angry with me for refusing to kill Kahlan and forrefusing to allow you to do it.” He pointed with his chin back up toward themountain pass. “I thought you might have meant to keep your word and so you sentSamuel to fulfill your threat.”Shota glanced to her companion off through the trees. He looked suddenlyalarmed.“What are you talking about?” She asked with a frown as she looked back atRichard.“Are you now claiming you didn’t know?”“Know what?”Richard briefly considered the angry yellow eyes glaring at him.“Samuel hid up in the pass and jumped me from out of the storm. He snatched mysword and kicked me over a cliff. I just managed to catch the edge. If Carawouldn’t have been there, Samuel would have used the sword to see to it that Ifell from the cliff. He very nearly killed me. That he didn’t wasn’t because hedidn’t intend to or try his best.”Shota’s glare glided to the dark figure crouched off in the trees. “Is thattrue?”Samuel could not bear her scrutiny. Puling with self-pity, his gaze sank to theground. That was answer enough.“We will discuss this later,” she told him in a low voice that carriedunequivocally through the trees and gave Richard goose bumps.“That was not my intention, Richard, nor my orders, I can assure you. I toldSamuel only to invite your devious little guardian to come along.”“You know what, Shota? I’m getting pretty tired of Samuel trying to kill me andyou then claiming that you never gave him any such instructions. Once might havebeen credible, but it’s growing too routine. Your innocent surprise every timeit happens is beginning to strike me as rather convenient. It appears to me thatyou find deniability quite useful and so you stick to it.”“That isn’t true, Richard,” Shota said in a measured tone. She unfolded her armsand clasped her hands as she looked at the ground at her feet. “You carry hissword. Samuel is a little touchy about that. Since it was taken from him, notgiven freely, that means it still belongs to him.”Richard nearly objected, but then reminded himself that he wasn’t there to arguethe point.Shota’s gaze rose to meet his. It came up angry.“And how dare you complain to me about what Samuel does without my knowledgewhen you knowingly bring a deadly menace into the peace of my home?”Richard was taken aback. “What are you talking about?”“Don’t play stupid, Richard, it doesn’t fit you. You are hunted by a wildlydangerous threat. How many people have already died because they wereunfortunate enough to be near you when the beast came looking for you. What ifit decides to come here to kill you? You come here and in so doing cavalierlyrisk my life, without my permission, simply because you happen to wantsomething?“Do you think it’s right that I’m put at risk of death because of your wants?Does the fact that you think I have something you need put my life at yourdisposal and therefore at great risk?”“Of course not.” Richard swallowed. “I never looked at it that way.”Shota threw her hands up. “Ah, so your excuse is that I am to be put in perilbecause you didn’t think.”“I need your help.”“You mean you have come as a helpless beggar, begging for help, without regardto the danger it puts me in, simply because you want something.”Richard rubbed a fingertips across his forehead. “Look, I don’t have all theanswers, but I can tell you that I have good reason to believe that I’m right,that Kahlan exists and she has disappeared.”“Like I said, you want something and you don’t bother to consider the risk toanyone else.”Richard took a step closer to her. “That isn’t true. Don’t you see? You don’tremember Kahlan. No one but me does. Think, Shota, think of what it means if I’mright.”Her brow twitched as she puzzled at him. “What are you talking about?”“If I’m right, then there is something gravely wrong in the world that’s makingeveryone—including you—forget her. She has been wiped from your mind. But it’smore serious than that. It’s not just Kahlan that is missing from everyone’smind. Everything that you or anyone else ever did with her is also missing. Someof those missing bits may be trivial, but other parts of it very well could bevital.“You don’t remember that you said you would kill me if I ever came back here.That means that when you said that, in your mind that threat had to be somehowconnected to Kahlan. She contributed to your choice to make that threat. Now,since you don’t remember Kahlan, you also don’t recall saying that to me.“What if there’s something vastly important that you’ve likewise forgotten.Because you’ve forgotten Kahlan, you’ve lost part of what you’ve done in yourown life—lost some of the decisions you’ve made. How many ways do you have aconnection with Kahlan that you are completely unaware of that are now wipedaway? How important are those missing bits? How much of your life has beenaltered because you now don’t recall the changes in your thinking that you madebecause of her influence?“Shota, don’t you see the magnitude of the problem? Can’t you fathom how thishas the potential to change everyone’s perception? If everyone forgets howKahlan changed their individual lives, they will act without the benefit of theshifts they made in their thinking.”Richard paced, one hand on a hip, gesturing with the other. “Think of someoneyou know.” He turned back to her, meeting her gaze. “Think of your mother. Now,just try to imagine all that you would lose if you lost every memory of her andeverything she taught you, every one of your decisions in which she had aninfluence, both directly and indirectly.“Now, imagine everyone forgetting someone important like your mother was toyou—but imagine them being central to events important to everyone. Imagine fora moment how your life—your thinking—would be altered if you forgot that I existand you no longer recalled the things you’ve done with me, the things you’vedone because of me. Can you begin to see the significance?“You gave Kahlan that necklace as a wedding gift to both of us to prevent herfrom conceiving—at least for now. It was a gift that was more than that, though.It was a truce. It was peace between you and me as much as between you andKahlan. What other truces, alliances, and oaths have been made because of Kahlanthat, like the necklace, are now forgotten? How many important missions will beabandoned?“Don’t you see? This holds the potential to throw the world into turmoil. I haveno idea of the possible effects of such a wide-ranging event, but for all I knowit could alter the complexion of the fight for freedom. It could usher in thedawn of the Imperial Order. For all I know, it could usher in the end of lifeitself.”Shota looked astonished. “Life itself?”“Something this significant does not happen randomly. It’s not an unfortunateaccident or some casual mistake. There has to be a cause, and anything thatcould cause a universal event of this enormity carries sinister implications.”For a time, Shota regarded him with an unreadable expression. She finally caughta floating corner of the layered material that made up her dress and turned awayas she thought about his words. Finally she turned back.“And what if you are simply suffering from a delusion? Since that is thesimplest explanation, that makes it most likely the true answer.”“While the simplest explanation is usually the true answer, it is not infalliblyso.”“This is no ordinary choice as you paint it, Richard. What you describe isextravagantly complicated. I’m having trouble even beginning to envision thecomplexities and consequences that would be involved in such an event. It wouldhave to cause so many things to come undone, with such compounding disorder,that it would soon become all too obvious to everyone that something wasterribly wrong in the world—even if they didn’t know what. That just isn’thappening.”Shota swept her arm out in grand fashion. “Meanwhile, what damage to the worldwill you cause because of this mad mission you have undertaken to find a womanwho does not exist?“You came to me the first time to get help in stopping Darken Rah I. I helpedyou, and in so doing I helped you become the Lord Rahl.“The war rages on, the D’Haran Empire fights desperately on, and now you are notthere to be a part of it, as is your place as the Lord Rahl. You have beeneffectively removed from your position of authority by your own delusions andunthinking actions. A void is left where there should be leadership. All thehelp you would be able to provide is no longer available to those who fight forthe cause you have championed.”“I believe that I’m right,” Richard said. “If I am, then that means there is agrave danger that no one but me is even aware of. Therefore, no one but me canfight it. Only I stand opposed to some unknown but impending ruin. I can’t ingood conscience ignore what I believe to be the truth of a hidden threat moremonstrous than anyone realizes.”“That makes a convenient excuse, Richard.”“It’s not an excuse.”Shota nodded mockingly. “And if the newly founded free empire of D’Hara falls inthe meantime? If the savages of the Imperial Order raise their bloody swordsover the corpses of all those brave men who will perish defending the cause offreedom while their leader is off chasing phantoms? Will all those brave men beany less dead because you alone see some inscrutable danger? Will theircause—will your cause—be any less ended? Will the world then be able to slidemerrily into a long dark age where millions upon millions will be born intomiserable lives of oppression, starvation, suffering, and death?“Will chasing off after the enigma in your mind alone make liberty’s graveacceptable to you, Richard? A mere consequence of what you stubbornly think isright in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary?”Richard had no answer. In fact, he feared to even attempt to give her one. Afterthe way she’d put it, anything he said would sound hollow and selfish. He feltsure that he had sound reasons to stick to his convictions, but he also knewthat to everyone else the proof had to seem pretty thin, so he thought thatmaybe it was best to just keep quiet.More than that, though, lurking beneath the surface was the terrible shadow offear that she could be right, that it was all some dreadful delusion in his mindalone and not some problem with everyone else.What made him right and everyone else wrong? How could he alone be right? Howcould such a thing even be possible? How could he know himself that he wasright? What proof, other than his own memory, did he have? There was not oneconcrete shred of evidence that he could hold, that he could point to.The crack in his confidence terrified him. If that crack widened, if itruptured, the weight of the world would crash in and crush him. He couldn’t bearthat weight if she didn’t exist.His word alone stood between Kahlan and oblivion.He couldn’t go on without her. He didn’t want to go on in a world with out her.She was everything to him. Until that moment, he had been pushing her personal,private, intimate loving memory aside and instead dealing with details in orderto endure the pain of missing her for yet an other day even as he worked towardfinding her. But that pain was now tightening around his heart, threatening totake him to his knees.With the pain of missing her came a flood of guilt. He was Kahlan’s only hope.He alone kept the flame of her alive above the torrent trying to drown out herexistence. He alone worked to find her and bring her back. But he had not yetaccomplished anything useful toward that end. The days marched past, but so farhe hadn’t gained anything that would get him any closer to her.To make matters all the worse, Richard knew that Shota was also right in onevery important way. While he worked toward helping Kahlan, he was failingeveryone else. He had been the one who, to a large extent, had made peoplebelieve in the idea, the very real possibility, of a free D’Hara, of a placewhere it was possible for people to live and work toward their own goals intheir own lives.He was only too aware that he was also largely responsible for the great barriercoming down, allowing Emperor Jagang to lead the Imperial Order into the NewWorld to threaten the newfound freedom in the New World.How many people would be at risk, or lose their lives, while he pursued this oneperson that he loved? What would Kahlan want him to do? He knew how much shecared for the people of the Midlands, the people she had once ruled. She wouldwant him to forget her and to try to save them. She would say that there was toomuch at stake to come after her.But if it was he who was missing, she would not abandon him for anything oranyone.Despite what Kahlan might say, it was her life that was important to him, herlife that meant the world to him.He wondered if perhaps Shota was right, that he was merely using the concept ofthe danger Kahlan’s disappearance represented for the rest of the world, as anexcuse.He decided that the best thing to do for the moment, until he could think of abetter way to get the help he needed, and to buy himself time to gather hiscourage, to harden his resolve, was to change the subject.“What about this thing,” Richard asked, gesturing vaguely, “this beast, that’schasing me.” The passion was gone from his voice. He realized how tired he wasfrom the long trek over the pass, to say nothing of the blur of days riding upfrom the Old World. “Is there anything you can tell me about it?”He felt on safer ground with this question because the beast could interfere notonly with his search for Kahlan, but with the mission Shota was urging him toreturn to.She watched him for a moment, her voice finally coming much softer, as had his,as if without realizing it they had reached a wordless truce to lower the levelof antagonism. “The beast that hunts you is no longer the beast it once was, thebeast it was as it was created. Events have caused it to mutate.”“Mutate?” Cara asked, looking alarmed. “What do you mean? What has it become?”Shota appraised them both, as if to make sure they were paying attention.“It has become a blood beast.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41A blood beast?” Richard asked.Cara moved close to his side. “What’s a blood beast?”Shota took a breath before explaining. “It is no longer simply a beast linked tothe underworld, as it was when it was created. It was inadvertently given ataste of your blood, Richard. What’s worse, it was given that taste throughSubtractive Magic—magic also linked to the underworld. That event changed itinto a blood beast.”“So… what does that mean?” Cara asked.Shota leaned closer, her voice dropping to little more than a whisper. “Thatmeans that it is now oh so much more dangerous.” She straightened after she wassure she had made the intended impression. “I’m not an expert on ancient weaponscreated in the great war, but I believe that once such a beast as this one hastasted the blood of its mark in such a way, there is no turning it back, ever.”“All right, so it won’t give up.” Richard rested his palm on the hilt of hissword. “What can you tell me to help me kill it, then? Or at least stop it, orsend it back to the underworld. What does it do, precisely, how does it knowthat—”“No, no.” Shota waved a dismissive hand. “You are trying to think of this interms of some ordinary threat hunting you. You’re trying to put a nature to it,trying to give it a defining behavior. It has none. That is the peculiarity ofthis thing—the absence of a defining description, of a makeup. At least one thatis of any use, since its nature is precisely that it has none. Because of thatit therefore cannot be predicted.”“That makes no sense.” Richard folded his arms, wondering if Shota really knewas much about this beast as she said she did. “It has to function by somefundamental nature. It has to behave in certain ways that we can at least cometo understand and therefore begin to anticipate. We just need to figure it out.It can’t possibly have no nature.”“Don’t you see, Richard? Right from the beginning, here you are trying to figureit out. Don’t you suppose that Jagang would know that you will try to figure itout so that you can defeat it? Haven’t you done that sort of thing with him inthe past? He has figured out your nature, and to counter you he has created aweapon that, for that very reason, has no nature.“You are the Seeker. You seek answers to the nature of people, or things, orsituations. To a greater or lesser extent, all people do. Had the blood beast aspecific nature, its actions could then be learned and understood. If somethingcan be understood enough to predict its behavior, then precautions can be taken,a plan to counter it can be made. Decoding its nature is essential to effectiveaction being taken. That’s why this thing has no nature—so that you can’t dothose things to stop it.”Richard ran his fingers back though his hair. “That doesn’t make any sense.”“It’s not supposed to. That, too, is part of its trait—to have no trait. To makeno sense in order to foil you.”“I agree with Lord Rahl,” Cara said. “It still has to have some kind of makeup,some way of acting and reacting. Even people who think they are being clever bytrying to be unpredictable still fall into patterns even though they may notrealize it. This beast can’t just run around hither and thither hoping to comeacross Lord Rahl napping.”“In order to prevent it from being understood and stopped, this beast wasintentionally created as a creature of chaos. It was conjured to attack and killyou, but beyond that mission, it functions toward that end through disorderedmeans.” Shota gathered up another floating point of her dress as she spoke.“Today it attacks with claws. Tomorrow it spits poison. The next day it burnswith fire, or crushes with a blow, or sinks fangs into you. It attacks by randomaction. It does not choose a course of action based on analysis, previousexperience, or even the situation at hand.”Richard pinched the bridge of his nose as he thought about her explanation. Sofar, it seemed like Shota was right in that there had been no pattern to theattacks. They had come in completely different ways—so different, in fact, thatthey had questioned whether or not it was really the same beast Nicci had warnedwas after him.“But Lord Rahl has evaded this beast several times now. He has proven that itcan be bested.”Shota smiled at the very idea, as if a child had come up with the assertion. Shestrolled off a ways and then returned as she considered the problem. The twitchof her brow told Richard that she had come up with a better way to explain it.“Think of the blood beast as if it were rain,” she said. “Imagine that you wantto stay out of the rain, like you would want to avoid being caught by the beast.Imagine that your goal is to stay dry. Today you may be inside when the raincomes, so you remain dry. Another day the rain may come on the other side of thevalley and you again stay dry. Another day you leave an area just before therain begins. Another day, you may decide not to travel, and there the rainvisits. Maybe on another day as you walk down a road the rain moves in and fallsin the field to your right, but on the road and to your left it remains dry.Each time the random rain event missed you, and you stayed dry—sometimes becauseyou took preventative measures, such as staying inside, and sometimes by sheerchance.“But, as often as it rains, you realize that it will sooner or later get youwet.“So, you may decide that the best approach in the long run is to gain anunderstanding of exactly what you are up against. Therefore, in an effort tounderstand your adversary, you watch the sky and try to learn to predict therain. Some patterns begin to reveal themselves as relatively reliable, so youuse them as a means of prediction and as a result there will be times when youare correct and accurately anticipate the approaching rain. By this means youare able to stay inside when the rain comes and thus you stay dry. You havesucceeded, it would seem, by applying what you’ve learned about how toanticipate and predict the rain.”Shota’s intent, ageless eyes took in Cara and then fixed on Richard with suchpower that it almost halted his breathing. “But sooner or later,” she said in avoice than ran a shiver up his spine, “the rain will catch you. You may be takenby complete surprise. Or, you may have forecast that it was coming, but believedthat you would have time to be able to take to shelter first, and then itsuddenly sweeps in faster than you ever thought possible. Or, on a day when youare far from shelter because you thought that on that day there was no chance ofrain at all and so you ventured far from your shelter, it unexpectedly catchesyou. The result of all these different events is the same. If it is the beast,rather than the rain, you are not wet, you are dead.“Confidence in your ability to predict the rain will eventually be your downfallbecause while you may be able lo accurately predict it on a number of occasions,it is not in reality reliably predictable based on the amount of knowledgeactually available to you or possibly your ability to understand all theinformation you do have. The more times you escape, though, the stronger yourfalse sense of confidence will become, making you all that much more vulnerableto a surprise event. Your best efforts to know the nature of rain willeventually fail you because even if you are right with a number of yourforecasts, the things that brought about successful predictions are not alwaysrelevant, yet you have no way of knowing that. As a result, the rain will sneakup and envelope you when you are not expecting it.”Richard glanced at the worried look on Cara’s face, but didn’t say anything.“The blood beast is like that,” Shota said with finality. “It has no natureprecisely so that you cannot predict its behavior by any patterns to itsconduct.”Richard took a patient breath. He couldn’t keep quiet any longer. “But allthings that exist have to have a nature to them, laws of their existence, evenif we don’t understand them—otherwise what you are proposing is that they couldcontradict themselves and they can’t.“Lack of understanding on your part does not mean that you can pick anexplanation of your choice. You can’t say that since you don’t know the natureof it, it therefore has none. You can say only that you don’t yet know thenature of this thing, that you haven’t yet been able to understand it.”With a slight smile, Shota gestured toward the sky. “Like the rain? You may betheoretically correct, Richard, but some things, for all practical purposes, areso far beyond our understanding that they appear to be driven byhappenstance—like the rain. For all I know, weather may very well have laws thatdrive it, but they are so complex and so far-reaching that we cannotrealistically hope to comprehend or know them. The rain may not truly, in theend, be an event caused by chance, but it is still outside our ability topredict so to us the result is the same as if it were entirely random andwithout order or nature.“A blood beast is like this. If there are in fact laws to its nature, as youbelieve, it would make no difference to you. All I can tell you is that fromwhat I know, it’s a beast created specifically to act without order and thecreation of it was successful to the degree that it functions consistently withhaving no discernible nature—at least none that is of any use in understandingor stopping it.“I grant the possibility that you may be right. I suppose it’s possible thatthere is some complex nature behind the beast’s seeming disorder, but if that isthe case, I can tell you that it is so far beyond our ability to understand thatfor our purposes it functions by chaos.”“I’m not sure I understand you,” Richard said. “Give me an example.”“For instance, the beast will not learn from what it does. It may try the samefailed tactic three times in a row, or it may try something even weaker the nexttime that obviously has no chance of success. What it does appears random. Butif it is driven by some grand, complex equation, it is not revealed through itsactions; we see only chaotic results.“What’s more, it has no consciousness, as we would think of it, anyway. It hasno soul. While it has a goal, it doesn’t care if it succeeds. It doesn’t getangry if it fails. It’s devoid of mercy, empathy, curiosity, enthusiasm, orworry. It was given a mission—kill Richard Rahl—and it randomly uses its myriadabilities to achieve that goal, but it has no emotional or intellectual interestin seeing its purpose accomplished.“Living things have self-interest in seeing themselves succeed at their goals,whether it’s a bird flying to a berry bush, or a snake following a mouse down ahole. They act to further their life. The blood beast does not.“It’s just a mindless thing advancing toward the completion of its built-inconjured objective. You might say it’s like the rain, given the mission of ‘getRichard wet.’ The rain tries and tries, a downpour, a drizzle, a quick shower,and all fail. The rain doesn’t care that it failed to get you wet. It may idleitself with a drought. It doesn’t get eager or angry. It doesn’t redouble itsefforts. It will just go on raining in different ways until eventually itdrenches you. When it does, it will feel no joy.“The beast is irrational in that sense—but make no mistake, it is vicious,fierce, and mindlessly cruel in its actions.”Richard wearily wiped a hand across his face. “Shota, that still makes no senseto me. How could it be like that? If it’s a beast, it has to be driven bypurpose of some sort. Something has to drive it.”“Oh, it is driven by something: the need to kill you. It was created to be acreature that acts with pure disorder so that you may not counter it. In a way,you have proven yourself to be an opponent so difficult to defeat that Jaganghad to come up with something that would work by avoiding your ■ strikingabilities, rather than overpowering them.”“But if it was created to kill me, then it has purpose.”Shota shrugged. “True enough, but that one bit of information is of no use toyou in predicting how, when, or where it will try to kill you. As you shouldknow by now, its actions toward that goal are random. You should clearly see theprofound danger in that tactic. If you know the enemy will attack with spears,you can carry a shield. If you know that one assassin with a bow is hunting you,you can have an army search for a man with a bow. If you know a wolf is huntingyou, you can set a trap, or stay indoors.“The blood beast has no preferred method of killing or hunting, so from thestandpoint of defending yourself from it, it’s profoundly difficult to protectagainst. One day it may attack and easily kill a thousand soldiers who areprotecting you. The next time it may timidly withdraw after mauling a singlechild who toddles in front of you. What it does one time can tell you nothingabout what it will do the next time. That, too, is part of the terror engenderedby such a beast—the terror of not knowing how the attack will come.“Its strength, its lethality, is that it isn’t anything in particular. It isn’tstrong, or weak, or fast, or slow. It’s constantly changing yet it sometimesstays the same or reverts to a previous state, even an unsuccessful one.“The only thing that mattered after it was created was the first time you usedyour gift. That’s when it locked on to you. After that, you can never know whatit will do next or when it will do it. You know only that it’s coming for youand no matter how many times you escape its clutches, it will continue tocome—maybe several times in the same day, maybe not again for a month, or ayear, but you can be sure it will eventually come after you again. It will neverquit.”Richard wondered how much of what Shota was telling him she knew to be fact andhow much she was filling in with what she thought, or maybe even imagined.“But you’re a witch woman,” Cara said. “Surely, you can tell him something thatwill help counter it.”“Part of my ability is the capacity to see how events flow in the river of time,to see where they’re going, you might say. Since the blood beast cannot bepredicted, it, by that practical definition of its character, exists outside myability to predict. My ability is linked in a way to prophecy.Richard is a man who in a way also exists outside prophecy, a man others oftenfind frustratingly unpredictable—as the Mord-Sith have no doubt discovered. Withthis beast I can offer him no advice about what might happen or what he mustavoid.”“So then, books of prophecy would be of no use?” Richard asked.“Just as I am blind to it, so is all prophecy. Prophecy cannot see a blood beastany more than it can see any chaotic, chance event. Prophecy may be able to saythat a person will be shot with an arrow in the morning of a day that it willrain, but prophecy cannot name every day it will rain, or which of those daysthat it does rain the arrow will precede it. You might say that the mostprophecy can predict is that sooner or later it will rain and you will get wet.”With his left hand resting on his sword, Richard nodded reluctantly. “I have toadmit, that’s close to my own views on prophecy—that it might be able to tellyou that the sun will rise tomorrow but not what you will choose to do with yourday.”He frowned at her. “So, you can tell me nothing about what this blood beast willdo, because your ability is with the flow of time.” When she nodded, he asked,“So then how do you seem to know so much about it?”“The flow of events through the river of time is not my only ability,” she said,rather cryptically.Richard sighed, not wanting to argue with her. “So that’s all you can tell me,then.”Shota nodded. “That’s all I am able to tell you about the blood beast and whatsuch a thing holds for you. If it continues to exist, sooner or later it willlikely get you. But, because it’s not predictable, even that outcome is not ableto be predicted. When, where, or how soon it will get you is impossible to know.It may be today, or, for all I know, it may be that before it is able to findyou and kill you, you will first die of old age.”“Well, there is that possibility, then,” Richard muttered.“Not much to lay your hopes on,” she said in a sympathetic tone. “As long as youlive, Richard, as long as blood pumps in your veins, the blood beast will huntyou.”“Are you suggesting that it finds me by my blood? The way a heart hound is saidto be able to find a person by the sound of their beating heart?”Shota lifted a hand as if to forestall the notion. “Only in a manner ofspeaking. It has tasted your blood, in a sense. But your blood, as you arethinking of it, is not what it is meaningful to this beast. What is material iswhat it sensed from that taste: your ancestry.“It already knew that you live. It was already hunting you. Your use of yourgift the first time was enough to bind it to you for all eternity. It is thegift carried in your blood that it sensed and that caused it to change.”Richard had so many questions he didn’t know what to ask first. He started withwhat he thought might be the easiest to understand. “Why is it linked to theunderworld? Is there a purpose for that?”“A couple that I’m aware of. The underworld is eternal. Time has no meaning ineternity. Therefore, time means nothing to the beast. It will feel no urgency tokill you. Urgency would make it act with a kind of conscious intent that wouldgive it a nature. It feels no pressure with every setting sun to finish the job.One day is the same as the next. The days are never-ending.“Because it has no sense of time, it needs no nature. Time helps give dimensionto every living thing. It allows you to put off chores that you know can be donelater. It makes you rush to set up camp before it gets dark. It makes a generalact to get his defenses in place before the enemy arrives. It makes a woman wantto have children while she still has time. Time is one element that helps shapethe nature of everything. Even a moth that emerges from its cocoon to live alife with wings for only a single day must mate in that day and lay eggs orthere will be no more of its kind.“The beast is untouched by time. A constituent element of its makeup is theeternity of the underworld, which is antithetical to the very notion ofCreation, since the underworld is the undoing of Creation. That mix, thatinternal conflict, is part of the driving mechanism which churns its actions andmakes it chaotic. When Nicci used Subtractive Magic to eliminate your spentblood, the beast, from its roots in the underworld, got its taste of you, or,more accurately, a measure of your magic.“Your blood carries both Additive and Subtractive Magic. The beast was createdto be able to know you by your essence, magic, thereby allowing it to transcendtypical worldly limits. The beast needed you to use magic the first time so thatit could link to you. Through that link, it could hunt you. But when it receivedthat taste of your blood, it became able to know you in a whole different way.“The unique element of magic carried in your blood, inherited from Zedd’s sideand from Darken Rahl’s side, is what the beast tasted. That taste is whatmutated it from the beast that Jagang’s minions created.“It’s not your blood itself that it senses, but rather it detects those elementsof magic inherent in it. That’s why any use of magic will draw the beast—that’show it became more dangerous. It now recognizes any use of your magic anywherein the world. Each person’s magic is unique. The beast now knows yours. That’swhy you must not use your gift.“For this very reason, the Sisters who brought the beast into existence forJagang would have loved to have been able to use your blood in the beginning,but they had no way of getting any. They could link the beast to your gift, butwithout your blood, it was a weak link that didn’t really know the full measureof your magic.“Nicci gave the beast what it really needed, right after it had been awakened byyour first use of the gift. She may have done it to save your life, and she mayhave had no choice, but she did it. Now, any use of magic can much more easilybring the blood beast to you. It would seem that Nicci has, in a way, fulfilledher oath as a Sister of the Dark.”The hair at the back of Richard’s neck had lifted. He wanted to think of a wayto prove Shota wrong, to find a chink in the armor of the monster she had givenshape to in his mind.“But the beast has attacked when I wasn’t using magic. Just this morning itattacked at our camp. I wasn’t using magic.”Shota gave him one of those looks that had the power to make him feel hopelesslyignorant. “You were using magic this morning.”“I wasn’t,” he insisted. “I was asleep at the time. How could I be using…”Richard’s words trailed off. His gaze wandered to the distant hills of thevalley and the mountains beyond. He remembered waking up and having thatterrible memory of the morning Kahlan had disappeared and then realizing that hewas holding the hilt of his sword, its blade drawn halfway from its scabbard. Heremembered feeling the sword’s stealthy magic coursing through him.“But that was the sword’s magic,” he said. “I was holding the sword. It wasn’tmy magic.”“It was your magic,” Shota insisted. “Using the Sword of Truth calls its power,which joins with your gift—your magic—which is recognized by the blood beast.The sword’s magic is part of you, now. Using it will chance calling the beast.”Richard felt like everything was pressing in on him, closing off every option,shutting off his ability to do anything to stop what was coming for him. He feltthe way he had earlier, when he woke up to find himself in a ever-tighteningtrap.“But the sword will help me fight it. I don’t know how to use my gift. The swordis the one thing I can count on.”“It’s possible that in some instances it may save you. But because the bloodbeast has no nature, and because it is now a part of the underworld, there willbe times when you think your sword will protect you and it will not. Thinkingyou can predict the ability of your sword to work against the beast will beguileyou into having false confidence. As I told you, the beast can’t be predicted,so there will be times when your sword can’t protect you. You must guard notonly against false reliance on your sword, but on it unwittingly calling thebeast.“It’s always hunting you, and could attack at any time, but when you use yourgift it vastly increases the ability, and therefore the likelihood, of the beastinitiating an attack. Magic baits it.”Richard realized that he was gripping the hilt of the sword so hard in his fistthat he could feel the raised letters of the word truth pressing into his palm.He could also feel the sword’s anger urgently trying to steal into him toprotect him against the threat. He took his hand off the hilt as if it wereburning him. He wondered if that magic had ignited his own, if he had justcalled the blood beast without even realizing what he was doing.Shota clasped her hands. “There is something else.”Richard’s attention returned to the witch woman. “Great, what next?”“Richard, I’m not the one who created this beast. I’m not responsible for itsdanger to you.” She looked away. “If you wish to hate me for telling you thetruth, and want me to stop, then say so and I will stop.”Richard waved an apology. “No, I’m sorry. I know it’s not your fault. I guessI’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed. Go on. What were you going to say?”“If you use magic—any magic—the blood beast will know it. Because it acts in arandom manner, it very well may not use that magic link to come after you rightthen. It may inexplicably not respond. But the next time, it may pounce. So youdare not gain confidence in that manner.”“You already told me that.”“Yes, but as of yet you have not realized the full implications of what I’mtelling you. You must understand that any use of magic will give the beast thescent of your blood, so to speak.”“Like I said, you told me that.”“That means any use of your gift.” When he stared at her with a blank look, sheimpatiently tapped a finger to his forehead. “Think.”When he still didn’t understand, she said “That includes prophecy.”“Prophecy? What do you mean?”“Prophecy is given by wizards who have the gift for prophecy. An ordinary personwho reads prophecy will see only words. Even the Sisters of the Light, guardiansof prophecy though they thought they were, do not see prophecy in its truestate. You are a war wizard. Being a war wizard merely means that your giftcarries a variety of latent abilities. Part of that is that you are able to useprophecy—to understand it as it was intended.“Do you see? Do you see how easy it is to inadvertently use your gift?“It doesn’t matter how you use your gift—if you use your sword, or heal withyour gift, or call down lightning—it doesn’t matter; it will call the beast. Tothe blood beast, any use of your gift is the same—a means of recognition. Itwill not distinguish between a small use, or a spectacular use. To the beast,the gift is the gift.”Richard was incredulous. “Do you mean to say that if I simply heal someone, ordraw my sword, it will alert the beast to me?”“Yes. And likely in short order while it knows precisely where you are. Beingthat it’s elementally Subtractive, it exists only partially in this world, so,while the beast is not hampered by things such as distance or obstacles, it alsodoesn’t function in this world with ease. It can’t fully conceive of the laws ofthis world, such as time. Still, it doesn’t get tired, it doesn’t get lazy, orangry, or eager.“By all this I do not mean to suggest that because you use your gift the beastwill therefore act. As I’ve said, its actions can’t be predicted, so, likeeverything else, the use of magic cannot be used as a predictive factor. It onlymeans that it increases its ease in being able to find you. Whether or not itwill do so is not knowable.”“Great,” Richard muttered as he went back to pacing.“How can he kill it?” Cara asked.“It isn’t alive,” Shota said. “You can no more kill the blood beast than you cankill a boulder that is about to fall on you, or kill the rain before it has achance to get you wet.”Cara looked as frustrated as Richard felt. “Well, there has to be something thatit’s afraid of.”“Fear is a function of living things.”“Maybe, then, something it doesn’t like.”Shota frowned. “Doesn’t like?”“You know, fire, or water, or light. Something it doesn’t like and so avoids.”“Today it might choose to avoid water. Tomorrow it might slither up from a bog,snatch his leg, and drag him under the water to drown him. It moves through thisworld as it would through an alien landscape that has little effect on it.”“Where in the world could someone learn how to create such a beast?” Richardasked.“I believe that the core of the knowledge was discovered by Jagang in ancientbooks on weapons that originated during the great war. He is a student ofancient subjects having to do with warfare; he collects such knowledge from allover. I have a suspicion, though, that he took what he found and addedspecifications he wanted in order to defeat you. We do know that he then usedthe gifted Sisters to spawn the beast.“Since they used Subtractive Magic along with their stolen wizardry, they wereable to make use of other gifted people as constituent parts of the beast,ripping their souls from them, ripping away all but what was needed in order toconjure, combine and create the beast. It is a weapon beyond anything we haveever encountered before. Jagang is the one who caused the beast to be created.He has to be stopped before he creates anything else.”“I couldn’t agree more,” Richard muttered.“You can’t stop him if you are off chasing phantoms,” Shota said.Richard halted his pacing and stared at her. “Shota, you can’t just tell me allthis without at least telling me something that will help.”“You are the one who came to me asking questions. I did not go looking for you.Besides, I have helped you. I told you what I know. Maybe by using theinformation you now have, you can live another day.”Richard had heard enough. The blood beast had no nature, but not to have anature, in a way, was its nature, so it had one as far as he was concerned. Itmay be true, as Shota had said, that there was no accurate way to predict whatit would do next, but lack of understanding or knowledge did not constitute alack of a nature. It was, however, a point that was not worth arguing. Hethought that it might be an important distinction sooner or later, but rightthen it didn’t matter much. Everything Shota had said largely confirmed whatNicci had already reported. While she had added facets and details that Niccihadn’t known about, Shota hadn’t provided any solutions.In fact, it seemed to him that she had gone to a great deal of trouble to makesure she had painted a hopeless picture.Richard almost rested his hand on his sword. He stopped and ran his fingersthrough his hair, instead. He was at his wits’ end. He turned and stared off atthe trees spread across the valley, their leaves shimmering in the late-day sun.“So, there is nothing I can do to protect myself from the blood beast.”“I didn’t say that.”Richard spun back around. “What? You mean there is a way?”Without emotion, Shota studied his eyes. “I believe that there is one way tokeep you alive.”“What way?”She clasped her hands, twining her fingers together. She looked down at theground a moment, as if considering, and then met his gaze with steadyresolution.“You could stay here.”He saw Samuel come to his feet. Richard returned his attention to Shota’swaiting gaze. “What do you mean, I could stay here?”She shrugged, as if it were a trivial offer. “Stay here and I will protect you.”Cara straightened, her arms coming unfolded. “You can do that?”“I believe I can.”“Then come with us,” Cara suggested. “That would solve the problem.”Richard already didn’t like Cara’s idea.“I can’t,” Shota said. “I can only protect him if he stays here, in this valley,in my home.”“I can’t stay,” Richard said, trying to make it sound casual.Shota reached out and gently grasped his arm, not allowing him to so easilydismiss the issue. “You can, Richard. Would it be so bad, staying with me?”“I didn’t mean it that way…”“Then stay here with me.”“For how long?”Her fingers tightened ever so slightly, as if she feared to say it, feared hisreaction, but at the same time was steadfast in her course.“Forever.”Richard swallowed. He felt like he’d walked out onto thin ice without’ realizingit, and now he found that it was a long, long way back to safety. He knew thatif he said the wrong thing he would be in over his head. His flesh tingled as herealized how dangerous the late day air had suddenly become.At that moment, he wasn’t sure that he wouldn’t rather face the beast thanShota’s scrutiny.Richard spread his arms, as if to ask her understanding. “Shota, how can I stayhere? You know that there are people counting on me—people who need me. You saidso yourself.”“You are not the slave to others, chained to them by their need. It’s your life,Richard. Stay, and have a life.”Cara, looking more than suspicious, tapped a thumb to her own chest “And whatabout me?”Without looking over at Cara, without taking her gaze from Richard’s, Shotasaid, “One woman in this place is enough.”Cara glanced between Richard and Shota as they stared into each other’s eyes,but she then did what Richard had earlier advised: she turned: cautious and saidnothing.“Stay,” Shota whispered intimately.Richard could see a terrible kind of vulnerability laid bare in Shota’s eyes, inher hungering expression—an open look he had never seen on her before. From thecorner of his eye, he could also see Samuel glaring at him.Richard tipped his head, indicating her companion. “And what about him?”She did not shy from the question—in fact she seemed to have expected it.“One Seeker in this place is enough.”“Shota—”“Stay, Richard?” she pressed, cutting him off before he could turn her down,before he crossed a line he hadn’t known was there until right then.It was both an offer and an ultimatum.“But what about the blood beast? You said yourself that you can’t know itsnature. How can you know that we would be safe here if I stayed? A lot of mennear me were killed when the beast attacked the first time.”Shota lifted her chin. “I know myself, know my abilities, my limits. I believethat I can keep you safe, here, in this valley. I can’t be completely certain,but I sincerely believe it to be true. I do know that if you leave here you willhave no protection. This is your only chance.”He knew that the last part had more than one meaning.“Stay, Richard… Please? Stay here with me?”“Forever.”Her eyes brimmed with tears.“Yes, forever. Please? Stay? I will take care of you, forever. I will make sureyou never regret it, or ever miss the rest of the world. Please?”This was not Shota, the witch woman. This was simply the woman, Shota,desperately laying herself open to him in a way she never had, offering herunprotected heart, taking a chance. The naked loneliness he saw there wasterrifying. He knew, because he felt the same anguish of being so alone that ithurt.Richard swallowed and took the step out onto the ice.“Shota, that’s probably the kindest thing you’ve ever said to me. To know thatyou respect me enough to ask such a thing means more to me than you will everunderstand. I have more respect for you than you know—that’s why when I neededanswers I thought of no one but you.“I sincerely appreciate all you are offering… but I’m afraid I can’t accept. Ihave to go.”The look that came to her face made Richard go as cold as if he’d been plungedinto icy water.Without another word, Shota turned and started away."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42Richard caught Shota’s arm, stopping her before she could leave. He couldn’tallow it to end in this way—for more than one reason.“Shota, I’m sorry… But you said it yourself; it’s my life to live. If youconsider me—even a little—to be a friend, someone you really do care about, thenyou would want me to live my life as I think I must, not as you might wish Icould.”Her chest heaved. “Fine. You have made your choice, Richard. Leave. Go and livewhat is left of your life.”“I came to you because I need your help.”She turned around fully toward him and cast him as forbidding a look as he hadever seen on anyone. It was the unmistakable mask of a witch woman. He couldalmost see the air around her sizzling.“I have given you help—gained through an effort on my part that I seriouslydoubt you can begin to imagine. Use that help as you wish. Now, leave my home.”As much as he wanted right then to do as she asked, as much as he wanted not topress her, he had come for a reason and she had not yet addressed it. He wasn’tleaving until she did.“I need your help to find Kahlan.”Her look turned even colder. “If you are wise, you will use the knowledge I havegiven you to stay alive as long as you can to help to defeat Jagang, or to gochasing after phantoms—I don’t care which anymore. Just go, before you find outwhy wizards fear to come into my home.”“You said that your ability helps you see events in the flow of time. What doesyour ability see about me in the future?”Shota was silent for a moment before she finally glanced away from his steadygaze. “For some reason, the river of time has become obscured to me. Ithappens.” Her gaze returned, more determined than ever. “You see? I can be of nofurther help. Now, go.”He was determined not to allow her to dodge the issue. “You know that I camehere for information, for something that could help me find out the truth aboutwhat’s going on. This is important. It’s important to more people than just youor me. Don’t close yourself off from me like this Shota, please. I need yourhelp.”She arched an eyebrow. “Since when have you ever followed anything I’ve evertold you?”“Look, I admit that in the past I haven’t always agreed with everything you’vehad to say, but I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think you were an astute woman.While some of the things you’ve told me in the past were true, if I would havedone things strictly your way without using my own judgment as the situationdeveloped I would have failed and we would all be either under the rule ofDarken Rahl or in the merciless embrace of the Keeper of the underworld.”“So you say.”Richard lost his indulgent tone as he leaned toward her. “You do remember thetime you came to see me at the Mud People’s village, don’t you? The time youbegged me to close the veil so that the Keeper wouldn’t have us all? You doremember telling me how much the Keeper wanted those with the gift, wanted you,a witch woman, to suffer unimaginably for all eternity?”He jabbed her with a finger, punctuating his points. “You did not suffer all thefrightful things necessary to stop what was happening—I did. You did not have tofight the Keeper’s terrors to close the veil—I did. You did not save your ownhide from the Keeper—I did.”She was watching him from under her lowered brow. “I remember.”“I succeeded. I saved you from that fate.”“You saved yourself from that fate. That it saved me as well was not yourpurpose, merely a side consequence.”He let out a breath, trying to be patient. “Shota, I know that you must knowsomething about this—something about what’s happened to Kahlan.”“I told you, I don’t remember any woman named Kahlan.”“Yes, and the reason is that something is terribly wrong and I realize thatbecause of that you don’t recall her, but you must know something that will helpme in my search for the truth—some bit of information that will help me find outthe truth about what’s really going on.”“And you expect that you can just walk uninvited into my home, put my life atrisk, do your little dance, and get whatever part of my life, my ability, thatyou want for yourself.”Richard stared at her. She had not denied that she knew something that mighthelp him. He realized that he had indeed been right about her.“Shota, stop posturing and stop acting like I’m unfairly making demands of you.I’ve never lied to you and you know it. I’m telling you that this is importantto you, too, whether or not you yet realize it. For all I know, it could yet besomething the Keeper has initiated in order to get us all. I need whateverinformation you can give me to prevent the success of whatever it is that’sgoing wrong. I’m not playing games. I will have what you know!”“And you think that such a demand entitles you to it?” Her eyes narrowed. “Youthink that just because I have something, your perceived need means that I mustsurrender whatever I have? That you are entitled to any part of my life you feelyou need? You think that my life is not mine, but I am merely meant to serveyou? You think my life means nothing but to be at your disposal when you deignto have use of me? You think you can come in here and make demands, but when Idare ask for something, you get indignant?”“I wasn’t indignant,” he said, trying to restrain his tone. “I appreciated thesincerity of your offer. I understand very well the empty feeling of beingalone. But if you’re the woman I believe you are, you wouldn’t want me eventhough my heart wasn’t in it. You deserve to have someone who can love you. I’msorry, Shota, but I can’t lie and tell you that I can be that one for you or Iwould only in the end be hurting you worse. I can’t lie to you; I’m already inlove with someone.“And even if you already realized that, would you really want someone who was socasually unfaithful as to just take up such an offer on the spot? I think whatyou really want is your equal, a true partner in your life, someone with whom toshare the wonders of life. I don’t think you really want the empty reward of alapdog. I think you already know that a lapdog can bring you no real joy.“If you care about me, if you made such an offer because you really care, if youwere sincere, then help me.”She didn’t look like she intended to answer, so he pressed on. “Shota, I need toknow any information you can give me. It’s important. As important as it was toyou when you came to ask me to seal the breach in the veil. I don’t know enoughto solve this problem. If I fail, I fear we all will lose. I don’t have time forgames. I need the information you have.”“How dare you make such an arrogant demand of me. I’ve already told you, alreadygiven you my answer. It’s my ability, my life. You have no right to it.”Richard pressed his thumb and middle finger to opposite temples as he took acalming breath. He grudgingly realized that maybe she had a point.He turned his back to her and walked off a few paces as he considered what hemight do. One thing he knew for certain, he wasn’t leaving without every bit ofhelp available.“You’re saying, then, that you know something that would help me in my searchfor the truth.”“I know a lot of things about a lot of different areas of the truth.”“But you know something that I need in order to find the truth about whatbrought me here to see you.”“Yes.”He knew it. With his back still to her, he said, “Name your price.”“You would not be willing to pay the price.”He considered the price he expected her to revisit.Richard turned to her. She was watching him in that way that made him feeltransparent. He was not leaving without the information and that was all therewas to it. This was Kahlan’s life.Whatever he had to do to save her life, including giving up his, he would do.“Name your price.”“The Sword of Truth.”The world seemed to stop. “What?”“You asked the price for what I can tell you. The price is the Sword of Truth.”Richard stood paralyzed. “You can’t be serious.”The corners of her lips curled ever so slightly. “Oh, but I am.”Off through the trees, Richard saw Samuel stand up, suddenly very attentive.“What do you want with the sword?”“You asked the price, I named it. What I want with the payment after it has beenmade is not your concern.”Richard felt sweat trickle down between his shoulder blades.“Shota…”He couldn’t seem to make himself move, or speak. This was not at all what he hadexpected.Shota turned her back and started for the road. “Good-bye, Richard. It’s beennice knowing you. Don’t come back.”“Wait!”Shota paused to look back over her shoulder, waves of her auburn hair glisteningin a streamer of golden sunlight. “Yes or no, Richard. I have given you enoughof myself for nothing in return. I will give you no more. If you want this, youwill pay for it. I will not offer you the chance again.”She watched him a moment and then started to turn away again. Richard grittedhis teeth.“All right.”She paused. “You agree, then?”“Yes.”She turned fully around to face him, waiting.Richard immediately reached up to pull the baldric off over his head. Carajumped in front of him and seized his wrist in both her hands.“What do you think you’re doing?” she growled. Her red leather glowed in the lowsunlight, as if to match the fire in her eyes.“Shota knows something about this whole mess,” he told her. “I need to know whatshe can tell me. I don’t know what else to do. I don’t have any choice.”Cara let go of his wrist with one hand to press her fingers to her forehead asshe tried to gather her senses, tried to calm her sudden rapid breathing.“Lord Rahl, you can’t do this. You can’t. You’re not thinking clearly. You’reswept up in the passion of the moment, the passion of wanting something youthink she has. You’ve got it in your head that you have to have it no matterwhat. You don’t even know what she’s offering. As angry as she is at you, it’smost likely that she has nothing of any real value.”“I have to know something that will help me find the truth.”“And there is no assurance that this will. Lord Rahl, listen to me. You’re notthinking clearly. I’m telling you, the price is too high.”“There is no price too high for Kahlan’s life—especially if the price is merelyan object.”“This isn’t her life you would be buying. It’s just a witch woman’s word thatshe can tell you something useful—a witch woman who wants to hurt you forrejecting her. You said yourself that nothing she’s ever told you before everturned out to be the way she said. This will be no different. You will lose yoursword and it will be for nothing of value.”“Cara, I have to do this.”“Lord Rahl, this is crazy.”“And what if it’s me that’s crazy?”“What are you talking about?”“What if all of you are right and there really isn’t any Kahlan? What if I’mcrazy? Even you think I am. I need to know what Shota can tell me. If I’m wrongabout everything I believe, then what good is a sword going to do a crazy man?If all of you are right that I’m delusional, then what good can I do anyoneelse? What good am I to anyone if I’m crazy? What good am I at all?”Her eyes looked liquid. “You’re not crazy.”“No? Then you believe there really is a woman named Kahlan and I’m married toher?” When she didn’t answer, he pulled her other hand off his wrist. “I didn’tthink so.”Cara turned angrily to Shota, pointing with her Agiel. “You can’t take hissword! It isn’t fair and you know it! You’re taking advantage of his condition.You can’t take his sword!”“The price I asked is but a trifling… The sword isn’t even his. It never was.”Shota beckoned with a finger. Samuel, watching from the shadows, scurried towardthem through the trees.Cara stepped between Richard and Shota. “It was given to Lord Rahl by the FirstWizard. Lord Rahl was named to the post of Seeker and given the Sword of Truth.It’s his!”“And where do you suppose the First Wizard got the sword in the first place?”Shota pointed a finger tipped with a long red-lacquered nail downward at theground. “He got it here. He came here, into my home, and stole it. That’s whereZedd got the sword.“Richard doesn’t carry it by right, but by theft. Giving it back to its rightfulowner is a small penance to pay for what he wants to know.”Cara had a dangerous look in her eyes as she lifted her Agiel. Richard gentlygrasped her wrist and lowered her arm before she started something that he knewcould quickly turn ugly. He wasn’t sure of the results of such a confrontation,but he dared not risk losing what Shota could tell him… or risk losing Cara.“I’m doing as I must,” he told Cara in a calm voice. “Don’t make this any moredifficult than it already is.”Richard had seen Cara in every sort of mood imaginable. He’d seen her happy,sad, disheartened, resolved, determined, and enraged, but until that moment hehad never seen her anger focused so intently, deliberately, so directly at him.And then he had a sudden vision of her taken by cruel anger once before, a longtime ago.He couldn’t afford to suffer the distraction of any such memory right then andshoved it out of his mind. This was about Kahlan, and about the future, notabout the past.Richard pulled the baldric off over his head and gathered it together with thescabbard. Samuel, not far behind his mistress’s skirts, stood quietly watching,his greedy eyes riveted on the wire-wound hilt.Holding the gleaming gold and silver scabbard in both hands, bundled togetherwith the ancient, tooled leather baldric, Richard lifted it out to Shota.She made a move to take it. “The sword belongs to Samuel, my loyal companion.”She smiled triumphantly. “Give it to him.”Richard stood frozen. He couldn’t let Samuel have the Sword of Truth. He justcouldn’t.He wondered then just what he thought Shota would want with the sword if not togive it to Samuel. He guessed that he had been trying not to think of what itreally meant to hand it over to Shota.“But the sword made him like that. Zedd told me that the sword’s magic did thatto him, turned him into what he is now.”“And when he has back what belongs to him, he will be who he once was, before itwas stolen from him by your grandfather.”Richard knew Samuel’s character. As far as Richard was concerned, Samuel wascapable of anything, including murder. Richard could hardly give something sodangerous as the Sword of Truth to someone like that.Too many people like Samuel had carried the sword, had fought over it, stolen itfrom one another, sold it to the highest bidder, who then became a Seeker whoseservices were for sale to any loathsome cause that could pay the price. In theshadows it passed from hand to hand, used for vile and violent purposes. By thetime Zedd had finally gotten the Sword of Truth back and eventually given it toRichard, the Seeker had become an object of scorn and contempt, seen as nothingmore than a criminal, and a dangerous one at that.If he gave the sword to Samuel, it would be that way again. It would start allover again.But if he didn’t, then Richard had no chance of ever stopping the far greaterthreat very likely loose in the world, or of ever seeing Kahlan again. WhileKahlan was of paramount importance to him, personally, he was convinced that herdisappearance augured an ominous menace far more sinister, with potential harmon a scale he feared to contemplate.His responsibility as the Seeker of Truth was to the truth, not to the Sword ofTruth.Samuel inched closer, his eyes on the sword, his arms reaching, his palms heldup, waiting.“Mine, gimme,” Samuel growled impatiently, his hateful eyes glaring.Richard lifted his head to look at Shota. She folded her arms, as if to say thatthis was his last chance. This was the last chance Richard had of ever findingthe truth.If he had known of any other way to find a solution, no matter how remote thatchance might be, he would have taken the sword back and taken that chanceinstead. But he couldn’t lose this chance, lose what information Shota had.There was nothing else to do.With trembling hands, Richard lifted the sword out.Samuel, unwilling to wait the final seconds until it reached him, lunged andsnatched the sword away, finally clutching the coveted object to his breast.The instant he had it, a strange look came over his face. He glanced up intoRichard’s eyes, his own wide with wonder, his mouth hanging agape. Richardcouldn’t imagine what Samuel was seeing as a result of having his hands on theSword of Truth. Richard thought that perhaps he was simply awestruck to realizethat he actually did have it again.He suddenly skittered away, swiftly disappearing into the trees. The Sword ofTruth was once again among the shadows.Richard felt naked, and stunned. He stared off in the direction Samuel had gone.He wished now that he had killed Shota’s companion the first time Samuel hadattacked him. Samuel had attacked Richard more than once. Richard had let thosechances slip away.He turned a harsh glare on Shota. “If he harms anyone, it will be on your head.”“I am not the one who gave him the sword. You did so of your own free will. Idid not twist your arm or use my powers to force you. Do not try to shedresponsibility for your own choices and actions.”“And I am not responsible for his actions. If he harms anyone, I will see to itthat this time he pays for his crimes.”Shota glanced off among the trees dotting the sweep of grass. “There is no onehere for him to harm. He has his sword. He is happy, now.”Richard seriously doubted that.With quiet fury, he turned his attention to the matter at hand. He didn’t wantto hear any of her excuses so he came right to the point.“You have your payment.”She stared at him a long time, her face unreadable. Finally, in a quiet voice,she spoke a single word.“Chainfire.”She turned and started toward the road.Richard seized her arm and turned her back. “What?”“You wanted what I know that can help you find the truth. I have given it toyou: Chainfire.”Richard was incredulous. “Chainfire? What does that mean?”Shota shrugged. “I have no idea. I only know that it is what you need to know tofind the truth of all this.”“What do you mean, you have no idea? You can’t just tell me some word I neverheard of and then leave. That’s not a fair trade for what I’ve given you.”“Nonetheless, that is the agreement you made, and I have upheld my end of thebargain.”“You have to tell me what it means.”“I don’t know what it means, but I do know that it is worth the price you paid.”Richard couldn’t believe that he had agreed to a deal in which he got nothing ofvalue in return. He was no closer to finding Kahlan than he had been before he’dcome to see Shota. He felt like sitting down right there on the ground andgiving up.I “Our business is concluded. Good-bye, Richard. Please leave. It will be dark,soon. I can assure you, you would not like to be here when it gets dark.”Shota started down the road toward her palace in the distance. As he watched hergo, Richard reprimanded himself for embracing failure without even trying forsuccess. He now knew something linked to the mystery. It was a piece of thepuzzle, a piece of the solution, so valuable that it had previously been knownonly to a witch woman. It confirmed for him that Kahlan was real. He toldhimself that he was a step closer. He had to believe that.“Shota,” Richard called.She paused and turned back, waiting to hear what he might say, looking like sheexpected a tirade.“Thank you,” he said in a sincere voice. “I don’t know what good knowing theword Chainfire will do me, but thank you. You have at least given me a reason togo on. When I came here, I had none; now I do. Thank you.”She stared at him. He could not imagine what she could be thinking.Finally, she took a slow step back toward him. She clasped her hands beforeherself, looking down a moment before she stared off at the trees, apparentlyconsidering something.At last, she spoke. “What you seek is long buried.”“Long buried?” he cautiously asked.“Like the word Chainfire, I can’t tell you what that means. Things come to me inregard to issues, problems, questions. I am the carrier of the information, thechannel you might say. I am not the source. I can’t tell you the meaning, but Ican tell you that what you seek is long buried.”“Chainfire, and seek something long buried.” Richard repeated as he nodded. “Gotit. I’ll not forget.”Her brow twitched, as if something else had just came to her. “You must find theplace of the bones in the Deep Nothing.”Richard felt goose bumps racing up his legs. He had no idea what the “DeepNothing” was, but he didn’t like the sound of it, or the sound of looking forbones. He refused to consider the dire implications.Shota turned again to the road and started making her way toward her palace. Shehad not gone more than a dozen paces when she stopped and turned back. Herageless eyes met his gaze.“Beware the viper with four heads.”Richard cocked his head expectantly. “I don’t know what that means—the viperwith four heads.”“Whether or not you realize it right now, I have given you a fair trade. I havegiven you the answers you needed. You are the Seeker—or at least, you were; youwill have to seek the meaning to be found in those answers.”With that, she turned for the final time and walked off through the golden lightdown the long road.“Let’s go,” he said to Cara. “I’d not like to find out why we don’t want to behere when it gets dark.”Cara cast him an icy glare. “I would imagine it has something to do with amurderous maniac wielding a deadly sword coming at you out of the darkness.”Richard gloomily supposed that she might be right. Samuel would probably not becontent to simply have the sword. He would probably want to eliminate therightful owner and thereby any chance that Richard might lay claim to it orsomehow get it back.Despite what Shota had said, the real thief had been Samuel. The Sword of Truthwas the responsibility of the First Wizard. He was the one who named Seekers andgave them the sword. It did not belong to whoever might possess it by any means,it belonged to the true, wizard-named Seeker, and that was Richard.With sickening dread, he realized that he had betrayed the trust his grandfatherhad placed in him when he had given Richard the sword.But what value would the sword be to him if keeping it meant that Kahlan wouldlose her life?There was no higher value to him than life."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43Richard was so deep in thought that he wasn’t fully aware of the arduous climbup the steep face of the cliff and out of Agaden Reach. In the golden light ofthe valley below them the long shadows of trees lengthened across the greenfields, yet the quiet beauty of the place as the sun sank behind the enfoldingmountains was lost on him; he wanted to be far away from the valley and out ofthe swamp before darkness took hold for good. He tried to devote his efforts tothat task, that mission, of putting one foot before the other, of moving,advancing.By the time they reached the top of the cliff and the vast swamp guarding theapproach to Shota’s home, it was an early dusk in the deep niche of the toweringmountains that ringed the place. Because the walls of rock cut the sunlight offearly, it left the sky overhead a deep blue, but that light was unable toeffectively penetrate the forest canopy, so that in the late day the vast greenbog seemed mired in a perpetual gloom of half-night. The deep shadows were verydifferent than those in Shota’s valley. The shadows in the swamp concealedpalpable but for the most part ordinary threats; the shadows around Shotaconcealed dangers that were not so easily appreciated, but that Richardsuspected were far more pernicious.The sounds of the dank swamp all around him, the chirps, the whistles, thehooting calls, the clicks, the distant cries, hardly registered in Richard’sconsciousness. He was deep in his own world of despair and purpose tangledtogether in a titanic struggle.While Shota had told him a great deal about the blood beast that was huntinghim, Nicci had already told him that he was being hunted by a beast conjured atJagang’s behest. The visit to Shota had not been worth the minutiae he learnedabout the beast. It was the precious few things that Shota had said at the endthat really mattered to him. It was those things for which he had traveled tothis place. It was for those things he had paid a price so dear that he was onlynow beginning to fully grasp its significance. His fingers itched to touch thehilt of his sword for reassurance, but that familiar and faithful weapon was nolonger there.He tried not to think about it, and yet he could think of little else. He feltrelief that he had gained what he felt sure would be crucial information, but atthe same time he felt a crushing sense of personal failure.He paid only enough attention to where he was walking to keep from stepping on ayellow-and-black-banded snake he spotted coiled in the lap of a root, or lettingthe fuzzy spiders clinging to the underside of leaves silently slide down silkenlines to alight on him. He skirted brush when something within hissed at him.Richard followed the darkening trail as fast as safely possible while in hismind he went over Shota’s every word, concentrating on the treasure for which hehad paid such a terrible price. Cara followed close on his heels, swinging andswatting at the cloud of bugs hovering around their faces. Occasionally a batfluttered in out of the dark shadows to snatch up some of those bugs.As he made his way through the tangle of growth, Richard pushed aside vines andbranches and stepped carefully around snarls of roots—some of which writhed likea nest of snakes when they got too close. On his first visit Samuel had shownhim how those roots could grab an ankle if you got too close. Richard was sototally absorbed in trying to figure out what “Chainfire” could possibly mean,or what it could be, that he nearly stepped into a stretch of black water thatwas hard to see in the murky light. Cara’s hand snatching his arm halted himjust in time. He glanced around and spotted the log they had crossed on beforeand took to that route.He racked his brain trying to think if he had ever heard the word Chain-firebefore, but his hopes grew as dim as the failing light. It was a strange enoughword, it seemed, that he would have remembered it if he had ever heard itbefore. He wished that Shota would have known its source or meaning, but hebelieved that she was telling the truth about these kinds of answers coming toher without explanation or insight.On the other hand, he feared that he knew all too well what Shota meant whenshe’d said, “What you seek is long buried.”That warning made his chest ache. He dreaded that it very well might mean thatKahlan was already dead and long ago buried.He’d felt lost ever since that morning he awoke to find her missing. WithoutKahlan, everything else in the world seemed meaningless.He couldn’t allow himself to envision her death as being true. Instead, hethought about her beautiful, intelligent green eyes, her special smile, hersingular manner as being very real and very alive.Shota’s words, though, kept returning to him. He had to figure out what meaningthey could hold if he was to find Kahlan.The last part, that he should “Beware the viper with four heads,” had made nosense to him at first, but the more he mulled it over, the more it began to feelto him like he should understand it, as if it was something that should makesense to him or something he should be able to figure out if he just thoughtabout it hard enough. The implication that seemed obvious was that thisfour-headed viper—whatever it was—was somehow responsible for Kahlan’sdisappearance.He wondered if he only suspected that because it sounded sinister. He didn’twant to allow himself to start down the wrong roads on groundless impulses. Thatwould only waste valuable time. He feared that he had already used too muchtime.“Where are we going?” Cara asked, lifting him out of his snare of thoughts.He realized that it was the first thing she had said since leaving Shota. “Toget the horses.”“You intend to try to make it over the pass tonight?”Richard nodded. “Yes, if we can. If the storm has blown away, the moon willprovide enough light.”The first time he had come to see Shota, the witch woman had taken Kahlan backto her valley. Richard had followed their tracks over the pass at night. Itwasn’t easy, but he knew it could be done. He knew how tired he was from thehard day of crossing the pass, and he knew that Cara had to be just as tired,but he didn’t intend to stop so long as he could still put one foot in front ofthe other.It was obvious by the set of Cara’s jaw that she didn’t like the idea of makingsuch a journey at night, but, instead of objecting, she asked something else.“And when we get the horses? Then where?”“To try to get answers to what I’ve found out so far.”All around, the mist had slowly drifted in among the gnarled trees, hangingvines, and expanses of still water, as if it were coming closer to listen in ontheir conversation. There was no wind to move the trailers of moss, so they hunglimp from crooked branches. Shadows moved in the dark places beneath vines andbrush. Unseen things distantly splashed in the black stretches of stagnantwater.Richard didn’t really want to discuss the long and difficult ride ahead of them,so before Cara could say anything, he asked, “Have you ever heard the wordChainfire?”Cara let out a sigh. “No.”“Any guesses at all about what it could mean?”She shook her head.“What about the place of the bones in the Deep Nothing? Does that mean anythingto you?”Cara didn’t answer for a moment. “It seems like ‘the Deep Nothing’ might bevaguely familiar, like I might have heard it once before.”Richard thought that that sounded encouraging. “Can you recall where, oranything about it?”“No, I’m afraid not.” She reached out and casually plucked a heart-shaped leaffrom a vine as she walked beside him. “The only thing I can think is that maybeI heard it as a child. I’ve tried and tried, but I just can’t recall if that’sreally true—that I might have heard it—or it’s just that ‘deep’ and ‘nothing’are common enough words and so that’s the reason it seems like I must knowthem.”Richard let out a disappointed sigh. That was what he wondered, too—if they weresimply common words and that was what was making the Deep Nothing sound likemaybe he should know it.“What about a viper with four heads?” he asked.Cara shook her head again as she dropped back a step to fall in behind him inorder to skirt a tree limb hanging over into the trail. A small leaf-green snakewas curled on the branch, watching them pass close by, licking the air for thescent of them.“It makes no sense to me,” she said as she twirled the leaf by its stem. “I’venever heard of such a beast—or whatever it is. Maybe the four-headed viper livesin a place called the Deep Nothing.”Richard had considered that possibility himself, but because of the way Shotamentioned them separately he doubted it. They had seemed to come to her asindividual, distinctly different pieces of information. He supposed that sincethey were connected to his question about something that could help him discoverthe truth, they could be associated as Cara had suggested.At the place in the trail where the trees opened up to the dark mass of themountains rising up before them, Cara paused.“Maybe Nicci will catch up with us soon. She knows a lot about magic and allsorts of things. She might know what Chainfire means, or even some of the restof it. Nicci would be happy to do anything to help you.”Richard hooked a thumb behind his belt. “Do you want to tell me what you andNicci have cooked up?”It seemed rather obvious to him, but he wanted to hear her admit the extent ofit. He watched her eyes as he waited.“Nicci had nothing to do with it. It was my idea.”“What, exactly, was your idea?”Cara turned away from his direct gaze and stared off up the pass. The sky wasmostly clear, with stars beginning to appear. Ragged clouds scudded past on thesilent wind higher up. It wouldn’t be long before the moon rose.“When you healed me, I felt some of the terrible loneliness haunting you. Ithink that you may have thought up this woman, Kahlan, in order to fill thatvoid. I don’t want you to have to suffer the terrible anguish I sensed in you.Someone who does not exist can’t ever fill such a void.”When she didn’t say anything else, he did.“And so you want that void to be filled by Nicci?”She looked back to his eyes, frustration overtaking her features. “Lord Rahl, Ionly wanted to help you. I think you need someone to be with you—to share yourlife—like Shota wanted someone. Like she wanted you. But Shota is the wrongperson—for both of you. I think Nicci would be good for you, that’s all.”“So you thought that in my place you could give my heart away to someone?”“Well… it sounds wrong the way you put it.”“It is wrong.”“No it’s not,” she insisted as her hands fisted at her sides. “You need someone.I know that right now you feel lost. I think you’re getting worse. Dear spirits,you just gave up your sword.“You need someone, I know you do. You seem somehow incomplete. In all the timeI’ve known you, you have never seemed that way to me before. My whole life I’venever before thought of the Lord Rahl as being with just one woman, much lessbeing married, but with you, it just seems that you need a soul mate.“Nicci is a better fit than anyone else. She’s smart—Nicci is smart enough thatyou two can really talk. You share things about magic and such. I’ve seen theway you two talk, the way you both smile. You just look natural together. You’reboth smart—and both gifted. And, she’s beautiful. You should have someonebeautiful and Nicci is that.”“And what part did Nicci play in your little plot?”“Nicci had much the same objections you have—which in a way only proves that I’mright about you two being such a good fit.”“So she didn’t like you planning her life, either?”Cara shrugged one shoulder. “No, that’s not what I mean. She had the sameobjections for you—she spoke up on your behalf, not hers. She only cared aboutwhat you wanted. She seemed to know that you would take a dim view of such anidea.”“Well, you’re right about one thing, she is smart.”“I was only trying to get her to think about it. I wasn’t telling her to throwherself at you. I thought that maybe you two could complete each other, fill thevoid you both feel. I thought that maybe if I encouraged her to consider it,that nature could take its course, that’s all.”Richard wanted to strangle her, but he kept his voice calm because Cara’sactions, while wrong, were so touchingly human, so caring, that at the same timehe wanted to hug her. Who would ever have thought that a Mord-Sith could evercare about love and companionship. He guessed that he had. But still…“Cara, what you’re trying to do is the same thing Shota was trying to do—decidefor me what I should feel, how I should live.”“No, it’s not the same.”Richard’s brow drew down. “And how is it not the same?”Cara pressed her lips together. He waited. She finally answered in a whisper.“She doesn’t really love you. I do. But not that way,” she was quick to add.Richard wasn’t in the mood to argue, or to yell. He knew that Cara’s intent waswell-meaning, if misguided. More than anything, he could hardly believe what hehad just heard her admit out loud. Were it not for everything else going on, hewould have been overjoyed.“Cara, I’m married to the woman I love.”She sadly shook her head. “Lord Rahl, I’m sorry, but Kahlan just doesn’t exist.”“If she doesn’t exist, then why was Shota able to give me clues that will helpme prove the truth?”Cara looked away again. “Because the truth is that there is no Kahlan. Thethings she told you will only help you discover that sad truth. Did you everthink of that?”“Only in my nightmares,” he said as he started for the mountain pass."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44Jillian turned and gazed up into the sky when she heard the raven croak. Thegreat bird’s wide-spread wings rocked as it rode the invisible currents in theperfectly clear blue sky. As she watched, it croaked again, a harsh, gratingsound that echoed through the deep silence of chasms and carried out across theparched, rolling landscape baking in the afternoon sun.Jillian snatched up the small, dead lizard lying on the crumbling wall besideher and then scrambled up the dusty lane. The raven wheeled majesticallyoverhead as he watched her running up the rise. She knew that he had probablyseen her ages ago, long before she knew he had been there.Holding the lizard by its tail as she rose up on the balls of her feet, Jillianlifted her arm as high as she could toward the sky and wiggled the offering. Shelaughed when she saw the inky black bird look almost as if it stumbled in midairwhen it spotted the ringed lizard dangling from her fingers. The bird rolledinto a steep dive with its wings pulled partly in to enable it to gather speedas it plummeted.Jillian hopped up and sat on the dilapidated stone wall beside some of theexposed paving stones that had once been part of a road. Over eons, much of thatroad had been buried beneath layers of dirt. Atop those layers of wind- andrain-borne soil, wild grasses and scraggly trees now grew. Her grandfather hadtold her that this was part of a special place and very old.Jillian had trouble imagining how old it could be. When she’d been younger andhad asked Grandfather if it was older than him, he had laughed and said thatwhile he admitted to being old, he was nowhere near that old and that the grounddid not in a single lifetime so swiftly cover over the accomplishments of man.He said that such slow work required not only time, but neglect. There had beenplenty of time, and with virtually no people left, neglect had worked its ways.Grandfather had told her how this empty, ancient city had once been inhabited bytheir ancestors. Jillian loved to hear his stories about the mysterious peoplewho had once lived in this place and had built the incredible city up on theheadland beyond the stone spires.Her grandfather was a teller, and, since she was always so eager to hear histellings of the old lore, he said that if she was willing to put in the efforthe would make her the teller who would one day take his place. Jillian wasexcited at the prospect of learning to be a teller and mastering all the thingsthere was to learn, someone respected for their knowledge of the ancient timesand their heritage, but at the same time she didn’t like the implication thatsuch an eventual advancement among her people would mark her grandfather’spassing.Lokey alighted next to her and folded in his glossy black wings, bringing herout of her consideration of weighty subjects, of ancient people and the citiesthey built, of wars and great deeds. The curious raven waddled closer.Jillian set down the freshly dead lizard and, holding the tip of its tail,wiggled it temptingly.Lokey cocked his head, watching. Instead of taking the offering, he blinked hisblack eyes. He waddled closer to her, leading with his right foot in thecautious sideways manner he always used when approaching carrion. Rather thanflapping his wings and hopping back several times in the guarded practice heemployed when coming upon what he hoped would be a meal but could potentiallyturn into a threat, he stepped boldly forward and snatched her buckskin sleevein his heavy bill.“Lokey, what are you doing?”Lokey tugged insistently. The curious bird usually plucked at the beads down thesleeve or the leather thongs at the end, but now he pulled the sleeve itself.“What?” she asked. “What do you want?”He let go of her sleeve and cocked his head as he peered at her with onegleaming eye. Ravens were intelligent creatures, but she was never quite surejust how intelligent. Sometimes she thought that Lokey was smarter than somepeople she knew.Lokey’s throat feathers and ears lifted out aggressively.He suddenly let out a piercing caw that sounded very much like angry frustrationat not being able to talk so that he could tell her something. Kraaah. Hefluffed out his feathers again and cawed again. Kraaah.Jillian stroked his head and then his back, scratching gently but firmly underhis raised black plumage—something he loved to have done—-before smoothing downhis ruffled feathers. Instead of clicking contentedly and blinking lazily, as heusually did when she gave him a such a scratch, he hopped back a step out of herreach and let out three piercing caws that made her ears hurt. Kraaah. Kraaah.Kraaah.She covered her ears. “What’s gotten into you today?”Lokey hopped up and down, flapping his wings. Kraaah. He ran across the top ofthe old cobble road, flapping and croaking. At the other side he fluttered upinto the air, alighted, and then lifted off the ground again. Kraaah.Jillian stood. “You want me to come with you?”Lokey cawed noisily as if to confirm that she had at long last guessedcorrectly. Jillian laughed. She was sure that the crazy bird could understandevery word she said and sometimes read her thoughts besides. She loved havinghim around. Sometimes when she talked to him he would quietly stand nearby andlisten.Her grandfather had told her not to let Lokey sleep in her room or he would knowher dreams. Jillian mostly had wonderful dreams, so she didn’t mind if Lokeyknew them. She suspected that maybe her friend did know her dreams and that waswhy she often awoke to find him perched on the nearby windowsill, sleepingcontentedly.But she was always very careful not to send him any nightmares.“Did you find yourself a nice dead antelope? Or maybe a rabbit? Is that whyyou’re not hungry?” She shook her finger at him. “Lokey,” she scolded, “did yousteal another raven’s cache?”Lokey was always hungry. Her ravenous raven, she often called him. He wouldshare her dinner with her if she would let him and steal it if she wouldn’t.Even if he was too full to eat the lizard, she was surprised that he didn’t atleast take it away and hide it for later. Ravens hid whatever they couldn’tmanage to eat—and they could eat a lot. She couldn’t understand how it was thatthe bird didn’t get fat.Jillian stood and brushed the dust from the seat of her dress and her knobbyknees. Lokey was already airborne, circling, cawing, urging her to hurry.“All right, all right,” she complained as she held her arms out for balancewhile scurrying along the top of the fat wall along an enclosure strewn withrubble.At the crest of the small hill she stood with one hand on the sash of clothwrapped around her hip while with her other hand she shielded her eyes as shepeered up into the bright sky to watch her friend pitching and rolling in a bidto keep her attention. Lokey was a shameless show-off. If he couldn’t do aerialstunts to impress other ravens, he would happily do them for her.“Yes,” she yelled into the sky, “you’re a clever bird, Lokey.”Lokey cawed once and then swiftly beat his wings. Jillian’s gaze followed him,her hand shielding her eyes from the sunlight, as he flew south out over thevast expanse before her. Random ribbons of green summer grasses, up closer tothe foot of the headland and mountains behind her, cut through the barrenlandscape. To the sides, hazy violet fingers of distant mountains, each fartherone a shade softer and lighter, extended down into the desolate plain thatseemed to go south forever. She knew it didn’t, though. Grandfather said that tothe south was a great barrier and beyond a long forbidden place called the OldWorld.In the distance, down among the green patches on the plain that lay close upagainst the foothills, she could see the place where her people lived in thesummers. Wooden fences filled the broken gaps in ancient stone walls that heldtheir goats, pigs, and chickens. Some of their cattle grazed out on the summergrasses. There was water in this place, and some trees, their leaves shimmeringin the bright sunlight. Gardens stretched out beside the simple brick housesthat had withstood the harsh winter winds and baking summer sun for untoldcenturies.And then, when she glanced up again at Lokey, Jillian saw at the horizon towardthe west a faint cloud of dust rising up.It was so far away that it seemed tiny. The smudge of dust against the deep blueof the sky where it met the horizon seemed to hang in the air, motionless, butshe knew that it was just a trick of the distance that made it look tiny andstill. Even from this far, she was able to tell that it was spread across abroad swath. It was still so far away that it was hard to see much of its cause.Had it not been for Lokey, Jillian likely wouldn’t have spotted it for sometime.Even though she couldn’t yet see what was causing the dust, she knew that shehad never before seen such a sight.Her first thought was that it had to be a whirlwind or a dust storm. But as shewatched it she realized that it was too broad to be a whirlwind and a dust stormdidn’t stream up into the sky the way this did. A dust storm, even if it didextend high up, still had at the base what looked like huge, billowing, brownclouds running along the ground that was actually where the gusty winds werechurning up the dust.This wasn’t at all like that. This was dust rising up from something coming—frompeople coming on horses.Strangers.More strangers than she could fathom. Strangers in such numbers that it was likesomething in her grandfather’s stories.Jillian’s knees began to tremble. Fear welled up through her, coming to lodge inher throat where screams were born.This was them. The strangers her grandfather always said would come. They werecoming now.People never doubted her grandfather—to his face, anyway—but she didn’t thinkthey really worried about the things in his tellings. After all, their liveswere peaceful; no one ever came to disturb them or their homeland.Jillian, though, had always believed her grandfather and so she’d always knownthat the strangers would eventually come, but, like other people, she’d alwaysthought it would be sometime in the dim future, maybe when she was old, or,maybe even, if they were lucky, generations in the future.It was only in her infrequent nightmares that the strangers arrived in thepresent, rather than the far future.Seeing those columns of dust rising, she knew without a doubt that this was themand they were coming now.In her whole life she had never seen strangers. No one but Jillian’s people everwandered the inhospitable barrens of the vast and forbidding place known as theDeep Nothing.She stood trembling in terror, staring at the smudge of dust at the horizon. Shewas about to see a great many outsiders… the ones from the stories.But it was too soon. She hadn’t had a life yet, hadn’t had a chance to live andlove and have children. Tears brimmed in her eyes, giving everything a wateryappearance. She looked over her shoulder and up into the ruins. Was this whatthey had faced, like in Grandfather’s tellings?Tears began to run down through the dust on her cheeks. She knew, she knewwithout a hint of doubt, that her life was about to change, and that her dreamswould no longer be happy.Jillian scrambled down off the top of the rubble she had been standing on andran down the hill, past the wall, the crumbled empty squares of brick buildings,the pits where once buildings had risen up. Her racing feet raised their owncloud of dust as she ran through the ruins of what once had been outposts of anancient city. She ran down roads that no longer had life around them, no longerwere lined with standing buildings.She had often tried to imagine what it would have been like when people hadlived in the houses, when people had walked the streets, cooked in the homes,hung the wash outside their brick houses, traded goods in the squares. No more.They were all long dead. The whole city was long dead, except for the few ofJillian’s people who sometimes stayed in the most remote of the old buildings.As she got closer to those ancient buildings of the outposts that they used whenthey lived in this area for the summer, Jillian saw people hurrying about,yelling to one another. She saw that they were gathering up their things andcollecting the animals. It appeared they were going to move on, maybe back intothe shelter of the mountains, or out onto the barrens. She had seen her peopledo such a thing only a few times before. The threat had always turned out to beimaginary. Jillian knew that this time it was real.She wasn’t sure, though, if they would have enough time to flee the approachingstrangers and hide. But her people were strong and swift. They were used tomoving around on the empty land. Grandfather said that no one else but herpeople could survive so well in this forsaken place. They knew the mountainpasses and places of water, as well as the hidden passages through what seemedlike impassable canyons. They could vanish into the inhospitable land in shortorder and survive.Most of them could, anyway. Some, like her grandfather, were no longer swift.With that renewed fear, her feet ran all the faster, padding with a steady beatover the dusty ground. As she got closer, Jillian saw men packing their travelgoods on the mules. Women collected cooking utensils, filled water containers,and carried clothes and tents out from their summer homes and storage buildings.It looked to Jillian that they had been aware of the approaching strangers forsome time as they were already well advanced in their preparations to depart.“Ma!” Jillian called out when she saw her mother packing her pot atop a mulealready piled high with their belongings. “Ma!”Her mother flashed a quick smile and held out a sheltering arm. Even though shewas getting past the age for such things, Jillian nuzzled under that arm like achick burrowing under a mother hen’s wing.“Jillian, get your things.” Her mother shooed her with a hand. “Hurry.”Jillian knew better than to question at a time like this. She wiped away hertears and ran to the small, square, ancient building they used as their homewhen they summered on the plains near the headland. The men sometimes had toreplace the roofs when the worst of the weather tore them off, but, other thanthat, the rest of the stout, squat buildings were the very same buildingsconstructed by their ancestors who had once built and lived in the deserted cityof Caska, up on the headland.Grandfather, looking drawn and pale as she imagined a ghost might look, waitedin the shadows just inside the door. He was not hurrying. Terror swelled inJillian’s chest. She realized that he couldn’t come with them. He was old andfrail. Like some of the other older people, he wouldn’t be swift enough to keepup with the rest of them if they were to escape. She could see in his eyes thathe had no intention of trying.She sank into her grandfather’s tender embrace and started wailing even as hecomforted her.“There, there, child,” he said, his hand stroking her short-cropped hair. “Notime for this.”Grandfather grasped her arms and eased her away as she tried her best to bringher sobbing under control. She knew that she was old enough that she shouldn’tbe crying in such a way, but she just couldn’t help it. He squatted down, hisleathery face wrinkling as he smiled at her and brushed away a tear.Jillian swiped away the rest of her tears, trying to be strong and act her age.“Grandfather, Lokey showed me the strangers who are coming.”He was nodding. “I know. I sent him.”“Oh” was all she could think to say. Her world was turning upside down and itwas hard to think, but somewhere in the back of her mind she realized that hehad never before done such a thing. She’d never known he could, but, knowing hergrandfather, it didn’t really surprise her.“Jillian, listen to me. These men who are coming are the ones I always told youwould come. Those who can are going away for a while to hide.”“For how long?”“For as long as necessary. These men who ride this way are only a small numberof those who will eventually come.”Her eyes grew wide. “You mean there are more? But there are so many. They raisemore dust than I have ever seen before. There can be more strangers than these?”His smile was brief and bitter. “These are only a survey party, I expect—thefirst advance scouts of many more to come. This vast and desolate land isunknown to them. I expect they are looking for routes through it, testing to seeif there will be any opposition. I’m afraid that according to the tellings, themen they scout for are more in number than even I can grasp. I believe thatthese other men, with their uncountable numbers, are yet some time in coming,but even this advance party will be dangerous, ruthless men. Those of our peoplewho are able must flee and hide for now.“Jillian, you cannot go with them.”Her jaw dropped. “What… ?”“Listen to me. The times I have told you about are upon us.”“But, Ma and Pa won’t allow—”“They will allow what I tell them they must, just as our people must,” he saidin a stern voice. “This is about far greater matters, matters that have neverbefore involved our people—at least not since our ancestors filled the city. Nowthese things concern us as well.”Jillian nodded solemnly. “Yes, Grandfather.” She was terror stricken, but at thesame time she felt an awakening sense of duty to her grandfather’s call. If heintended to trust her with such things, then she could not fail him.“What is it am I to do, then?”“You are to be the priestess of the bones, the carrier of dreams.”Jillian’s mouth again fell open. “Me?”“Yes, you.”“But I’m still too young. I’ve not been trained in such things.”“There is no more time, child.” He leaned toward her in admonition. “You are theone to do this, Jillian. I have already taught you much of the tellings. You maythink you are unprepared, or that you are not old enough, and all that may havesome truth to it, but you know more than you may realize. What’s more, there isno other. It is upon you to do this.”Jillian couldn’t seem to make herself blink. She felt completely inadequate, andat the same time faintly excited and guardedly inspired. Her people weredepending on her. More importantly, her grandfather was depending on her and hebelieved she could do it.“Yes, Grandfather.”“I will prepare you to be among the dead, and then you must hide among them andwait.”Fear began to wrap its arms around her again. She had never stayed all aloneamong the dead.Jillian swallowed. “Grandfather, are you sure that I’m ready for such a thing?To be there, alone, among the dead? Waiting for one of them?”The light coming in from the open door cast his face with a forbidding look.“You are as ready as I can make you. I had hoped there would be time left toteach you many more things, but at least I have taught you some of what you mustknow.”Outside, people rushed around in the sunlight, tending to the preparations. Theywere careful not to look into the shadows, to Grandfather, after he had pulledher away from the rest of them, telling her what she must face.“To tell you the truth,” he said, “this has taken me unprepared as well. Thetellings have been carried down from our people for thousands of years, but theynever said when it would happen. I never really believed that it would comeduring my life. I remember my own grandfather telling me the things I have toldyou and not really believing it would ever happen except maybe in some farfuture time that didn’t really mean anything to my life. But the time is nowupon us and we must do our best to honor our ancestors. We must be ready—youmust—as we have been taught through the tellings.”“How long will I have to wait?”“There is no way I can tell you that. You must hide among the spirits. As thetellers have done down through the centuries, you and I have stashed food, asLokey does, for just such an eventuality. You will have food to keep your bellyfull. You can fish and hunt for game when it is safe to be out.”“Yes, Grandfather. But couldn’t you hide with me?”“I will take you up there, help prepare you, and tell you all I can. But I mustthen return here to help make these strangers think we are out in the open andwelcoming to them while the others of our people escape—and so that you will beable to hide. I could not be as swift as you, nor as small to slip through thenarrow places so that these men cannot follow you. I will have to return hereand do my part.”“What if the strangers hurt you?”Grandfather took a breath and let it out with weary resolve. “It may be thatthey do so. These men who come will be capable of such brutality—that is whythis is so important. Their cruel ways are why we must be strong and why we mustnot give in to them. Even if I die”—he shook a finger at her—”and you can besure that I will do my best not to, I will be buying the rest of you the timeyou need.”Jillian chewed on her lip. “Aren’t you afraid to die?”He nodded as he smiled. “Very. But I have lived a long life and because I loveyou so, I would choose that you have a chance to do the same.”“Grandfather,” she said through choking tears, “I want you to be with me for mylife.”He took her hand. “Me too, child. I wish to see you grow into a woman and haveyour own children. But I don’t want you to worry too much for me; I am not sohelpless nor a fool. I will sit in the shade with the others and present nothreat to these men. We will confess to the strangers that the younger of ourpeople ran away in terror, but we could not. The strangers will likely have moreimportant things to do than waste their energy harming us. We will be fine. Iwant you to think about what you must do, and not worry about me.”Jillian felt a little better about his safety. “Yes, Grandfather.”“Besides,” he told her, “Lokey will be with you, and he will carry my spiritwith him, so it will be almost like I am watching over you.” When she smiled atthat, he said, “Come, now. We must go and make preparations.”Jillian’s mother and father were allowed a brief farewell after Grandfather toldthem in a stern voice that he was taking her to be with their spirit ancestorsand see to the safety of their people.Her mother and father either understood the importance of allowing theirdaughter to go, or were too afraid of Grandfather to refuse. In either case theyhugged her and bid her strength until they could be together again.Without speaking more of it, Grandfather led her away as eyes followed them. Hetook her up the ancient roads and through gorges, past the deserted outposts andmysterious buildings, and up the great rise of the land. As they climbed, thesun lowered in the western sky behind the golden tail of dust that slowly butsteadily came ever closer. She knew that before the sun set, most of her peoplewould be gone.The lowering sun allowed the murky shadows to begin to haunt the defiles. Thesmooth stone, layered with twisting bands of rock, invited them ever onward tosee what might be around each curving bend. Along the bottom the gravel waslittered here and there with bones of small animals. Most, she knew, were theleavings of the coyotes and the wolves. She tried very hard to banish the mentalimage of her own bleached bones lying scattered in the gravel.Overhead, Lokey lazily circled in the deepening blue of the sky as he watchedher making her way with Grandfather up toward the headland. When they reachedthe stone spires, the bird silently glided among the columns’ pinnacles, as ifit were a game. He had followed them up to the ancient city enough times that hemust have thought nothing of it. To Jillian, even though Grandfather had takenher up through the maze of ravines, gullies, and deep canyons a great manytimes, this time it all seemed new to her.This time she was going as the priestess of the bones, the carrier of dreams.At a place where a quiet stream followed a twisting route through the graveledbottom of a very deep canyon, Grandfather led her to a small boulder in the coolshade and sat her down. All around, the smooth, undulating sides of the canyonrose nearly straight up, leaving no way to climb out if a sudden rain brought aflood. It was a dangerous place—for more than the reason of the threat of flashfloods. It was a tangle of side gullies and canyons that in places tookcomplicated routes around huge standing columns so that it was possible to goaround in circles and never find your way out. Jillian, though, knew her waythrough this labyrinth, as well as others.As she sat quietly, waiting, Grandfather opened a pouch he always carried tiedto his belt. He pulled out a folded piece of oilcloth from among the things hecarried in the pouch, and opened it in one palm. He dipped his first finger inthe oily black substance inside.Grandfather lifted her chin. “Hold still, now, while I paint your face.”Jillian had never been painted before. She knew of the formality fromGrandfather’s stories, but she just never thought about it being her who wouldbe the priestess of the bones, the one to be painted. She sat as still as shecould while he worked, feeling that everything was happening too fast—before shehad even had time to really think about it. Earlier that day the most she had onher mind was catching a lizard for Lokey. Now it felt as if the weight of theworld was on her shoulders.“There,” Grandfather said. “Come see.”Jillian knelt beside a still pool and bent forward. She gasped. What she saw wasfrightening. The face staring back had a painted black band across it, like ablindfold, but one she could see through. Her copper-colored eyes stared back ather from the dark midst of that smoky black mask.“Now the evil spirits will not be able to see you,” he told her as he stood.“You can safely be among our ancestors.”Jillian stood as well, feeling very strange indeed. She felt transformed. Theface she’d seen had been the face of the priestess. She’d heard about it inGrandfather’s tellings, but she’d never seen such a face in real life, much lessexpected it to ever be her own.She leaned over and stole a cautious peek into the still pool. “This will trulyhide me?”“It will keep you safe,” he said as he nodded.She wondered if Lokey would know her, if he would be afraid of her. The facestaring back from the still water certainly scared her.“Come,” Grandfather said, “we must get you up there and then I must get back sothe men will find me there with those of our people who remain behind.”When at long last they climbed out of the spires and stone canyons, they werefinally up near the city, just outside the great main wall but within some ofthe outer rings of smaller walls.They had emerged near the graveyard.Grandfather gestured. “You lead the way, Jillian. This is your place now.”Jillian nodded and started out toward the city glowing in the golden, late-daysunlight. It was a beautiful sight, as it always was, but this day it alsoseemed haunting to her. It seemed she was seeing it through new eyes. She felt avery real connection with her ancestors now.The grand buildings looked as if people might still occupy them, as if she mightspot some of them through the empty window openings as they went about theirdaily lives. Some of the structures were immense, with soaring pillars holdingup projecting sections of slate roofs. Other buildings had rows of archedwindows on each level. Grandfather had taken her into some of those buildings.It was amazing to see places that were stacked inside with layers of rooms sothat one had to climb stairs—stairs actually built right inside the buildings—toget to rooms above. The ancient builders seemed almost magical in the thingsthey had accomplished. From a distance, glowing in the golden light, it trulywas a majestic sight.Now, she would walk the streets alone, accompanied only by the spirits of thosewho had once lived here. She felt safe, though, knowing that Grandfather hadpainted upon her the mask of the priestess of the bones.She would be the one who would cast the dreams at the strangers.If she did her job well, the strangers would be so frightened that they wouldflee and her people would be safe.She tried not to think about how the people who once had lived here had done thesame thing and yet had failed.“Do you think there will be too many?” she asked, suddenly frightened by thetellings of the ancient debacle.“Too many?” he puzzled at her as they walked beside a wall that had long agobeen encased by living nets of vines that now held the crumbling stones inplace.“Too many for the dreams. I’m only one person—and I’m not experienced, or older,or anything. It’s just me.”His big hand gave her an assuring pat between her shoulder blades. “Numbers donot matter. He will help give you the strength you need.” Grandfather lifted acautionary finger. “And don’t forget, Jillian, the tellings say that you must bedevoted to this one. He is to be your master.”Jillian nodded as they entered the vast graveyard. In the lower reaches therewere simple stone markers. As they climbed higher, past row upon row of graves,they eventually came to larger and more ornate monuments to the dead. Some ofthem had grand statues of people in proud poses atop them. Some had carvings ofthe flame of life that represented the Creator’s light. Some had ancientinscriptions of lasting love. A few had only an ancient symbol on them that hergrandfather told her was called a Grace. Some of the great monuments had only aname.Deep in the place of the dead, near the highest spot, where the weathered treesgrew large and twisted, they came at last to a grand grave marked with a huge,ornately crafted stone monument. Atop it sat a speckled gray granite urn thatheld olives, pears, and other fruits, with grapes spilling out over one side,all carved from the same piece of stone. Grandfather, who had taken her to seethis monument many times as he gave her tellings, said that the urn was meant torepresent the bounty of life that man created through his creative efforts andhard work.He watched her as she paused and then stepped closer to a huge gravestone forsomeone long dead, carved from one piece of stone back in the time that theancient city had been alive. She wondered what he had been like. She wondered ifhe had been kind, or cruel, or young, or old.Lokey alighted atop the carved stone grapes and ruffled his glossy blackfeathers before settling himself. She was glad that Lokey would keep her companyin such a lonely place.Jillian reached out and traced a finger through the letters that spelled out thename carved in the gray granite.“Do you think the tellings are true, Grandfather? I mean, really true?”“I was taught that they are.”“Then he really will come back to us from the world of the dead? Really, trulycome back to life from the dead?”She looked back over her shoulder. Her grandfather, standing close behind her,reached out and reverently touched the stone monument. He nodded solemnly.“He will.”“Then I will wait for him,” she said. “The priestess of the bones will be hereto welcome him and serve him when he returns to life.”Jillian briefly glanced at the dust rising at the horizon and then turned backto the tomb. “Please hurry,” she implored of the dead man.As her grandfather watched, she gently ran her small fingers through the boldletters on the tomb.“I can’t cast the dreams without you,” Jillian said softly to the name carved inthe stone. “Please hurry, Richard Rahl, and return to the living.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45As Nicci’s horse, Sa’din, stepped through the empty city, the clop of his hooveson the stone cobbles echoed among the canyons of deserted buildings like aforlorn call that went unanswered. Colorful shutters stood open on some of thewindows, closed on others. On the second floor of many of the buildings, tinybalconies overlooking the empty streets had wrought-iron railings standing infront of doors with drapes pulled tightly closed. There was no breeze to movethe legs of a pair of pants Nicci saw hanging on a line strung between thesecond floors on opposite sides of an empty alleyway. The owner of the pants hadlong ago walked off without them.The quiet was so imposing that it bordered on ominous. It was an eerie feelingbeing within a city without its people, the mere shell that had once held lifeand vitality, now with form but no purpose. It was somewhat reminiscent ofviewing a corpse, the way that it seemed so nearly alive and yet so still thatthere could be no doubt as to the terrible truth. If left this way, if notbrought back from the cold brink with life, it would eventually crumble intoforgotten ruins.Through narrow gaps between buildings, Nicci caught glimpses of the Wizard’sKeep embedded in a rocky slope high up on the monstrous mountain. The vast, darkcomplex perched like a menacing vulture ready to pick over the remains of thesilent city. Spires, towers, and high bridges rising up from the Keep snaggedclouds slowly drifting past the sheer, fractured face of the rock. The immenseedifice was as sinister a sight as she had ever seen. Still, she knew that inreality it wasn’t a sinister place, and she was relieved to at last havearrived.It had been a long and difficult journey from the Old World up to Aydindril.There had been times when she had feared she would never be able to escape thesnares of troops strung out along the way. There had been times when she had fora time lost herself in killing them. There were so many, though, that she knewshe had no realistic hope of making any meaningful reduction in their numbers.It had enraged her that she could be little more than a pest to them. Still, herreal purpose had been to reach Richard. The Order troops were merely an obstaclein her way.Through the conjured connection she had forged with Richard, Nicci knew that shewas at long last near to him. She hadn’t found him yet, but she knew she soonwould.For a time, before she had even started on her way, she had come to think thatshe would never again have a chance to see him.The fighting for control of Altur’Rang had been brutal. The troops who hadattacked, having been surprised and bloodied in the beginning as evening hadfallen, being as experienced and battle-hardened as they were, had quicklygathered their wits and their numbers and, by the light of fires they’d set,made a concentrated effort to turn the tide of battle.Even with as much as Nicci knew about the manner in which Jagang would deal withthe insurrection in Altur’Rang, even she didn’t expect all that he had thrown anthem. For a time, with the help of an unexpected third wizard, it had seemedthat the Order troops would overpower the inexperienced defenders. It was adarkly hopeless moment when it appeared that the efforts of the people ofAltur’Rang to defend themselves were to be for naught. The specter of failure,and the ensuing slaughter everyone knew such a failure would bring, came to seemnot only inevitable, but all too real. For a time, Nicci and those with herbelieved they would not survive the night.Despite her wounds and exhaustion, and even more than her sincere desire to helpthe people she knew in Altur’Rang and all the innocent and helpless souls whowould be slaughtered if they lost, the thought of never seeing Richard again hadgalvanized Nicci and given her the extra strength of will to push on. She usedher fear of never seeing Richard again to ignite a fierce rage that could onlybe quenched with the blood of the enemy who stood in her way.At the crucial point in the battle, in the harsh, flickering light of theroaring blazes from buildings burning all around, as the enemy wizard stood onthe platform of a public well in an open square casting death and ghastlysuffering as he urged his men onward, Nicci appeared like an avenging spirit inthe midst of their ranks and bounded up onto the platform. It was an event sounexpected that it caught the attention of everyone. In that brief fraction oftime when they all stared in stunned surprise, in full view of the Order troops,she abruptly cleaved the chest of their astonished wizard and with her barehands ripped out his still beating heart. With a cry of primal anger, Nicci heldthe bloody trophy up for his soldiers to see and promised them the same.At that moment, Victor Cascella charged with his men into the center of theinvaders. He was gripped by rage of his own, not just that the marauding thugswould murder and pillage the people of Altur’Rang, but that they would steal hishard-won liberty. Had he the gift, his fierce glare alone might have cut downthe enemy. As it was, his bold attack was as unexpected as it was ferocious.That combination of events broke the courage of the attackers. None of themwanted to face the wrath of the blacksmith and fall under the fury of his maceany more than they wanted a mad sorceress who seemed like the avenging spirit ofdeath itself to rip out their hearts.The elite Order troops turned and tried to escape from the city, from the middleof an enraged populous. Rather than let the people of the city be satisfied withvictory, Nicci had insisted that the enemy be pursued and killed to a man.She alone fully understood how important it was that none of the soldiersescaped to tell the tale of their loss. Emperor Jagang would be awaiting wordthat his home city had been brought back under his command, that theinsurrectionists had been tortured to death, and that the people of the city hadbeen driven to their knees, that there was such slaughter that it would for alltime serve as a warning for others.Even though he expected success, Nicci knew that Jagang would have taken word ofthe defeat in stride. He had lost battles before. It did not deter him. Fromlosses he learned the measure of the opposition. He would have simply sent moretroops the next time, enough to accomplish the task, and to do so as viciouslyas possible not only to insure victory, but to insure an extra measure ofpunishment for resisting his authority.Nicci knew the man. He did not care about the lives of his soldiers—or the livesof anyone, for that matter. If men fought for the Order and died, then glory inthe afterlife would be their reward. They could expect only sacrifice in thislife.But if no word of the battle for Altur’Rang ever arrived, that was somethingaltogether different.Nicci knew that Jagang was nettled by lack of knowledge more than any enemy. Hedid not like the unknown. She knew that sending off crack troops—along withthree rare and valuable wizards—and then never again hearing another word fromany of them, would gall him no end. He would work the mystery over and over inhis mind the way a nervous man worked a worry stone in his fingers.In the end, not having any testimony whatsoever as to the outcome of the battlefor Altur’Rang would spook him more than a simple defeat. He did not fear losingmen—life meant little to him—so a defeat he could handle, but he didn’t at alllike the unknown. Perhaps worse, his army, composed of men prone tosuperstition, would take such an event as a bad omen.As Nicci followed the twisting turns of the narrow cobblestone street, she camearound a curve and looked up to see, between the buildings lining each side, asight that nearly took her breath away. On a hill in the distance, lit by thesun, set on a sweep of beautiful grounds of emerald green, stood a magnificentpalace of white stone. It was as elegant as anything she had ever seen. It was astructure that stood proud, strong, and pleasingly possessed of a distinctlyfeminine grace. This, she knew, could be nothing other than the Confessors’Palace.The sight of it, exquisite, authoritative, pure, stood in stark contrast to thetowering mountain behind it upon which rose the dark, soaring walls of the Keep.It seemed clear to Nicci that the Confessors’ Palace was meant to be majestybacked by dark threat.This had been, after all, the place that for millennia had ruled the Midlands.The larger lands of the Midlands had palaces in the city for their ambassadorsand members of the Central Council, which had ruled the collective lands of theMidlands. The Mother Confessor reigned over not only the Confessors, but theCentral Council as well. Kings and queens answered to her, as did every ruler ofevery land of the Midlands. From the narrow street she was on, Nicci didn’t seethe palaces representing the various lands, but she knew that not a one of themwould be as grand as the Confessors’ Palace—especially not with the imposingKeep as a backdrop.Through a gap in the buildings to the side, movement caught Nicci’s attention.When she saw that it was dust rising into the still air, she laid the reins overand swung Sa’din around, directing him down a side street. Squeezing her lowerlegs, she urged him into a canter. Without pause he charged off down the narrowdirt street. In flashes between buildings, she could see the dust rising in thedistance. Someone was riding at speed up a road toward the mountain where theKeep stood. Through her link with him, she knew who it had to be.Nicci had helped end the threat to Altur’Rang as swiftly as possible primarilyso that she could be off after Richard. It wasn’t that she didn’t care aboutthose people, or eliminating the animals sent to massacre them, it was just thatshe cared more about getting to Richard. At first, she had it in her mind toride as fast as she could and catch up with him and Cara. It had quickly becameapparent, however, that there was no chance of that. He was simply traveling tooswiftly. When Richard was focused on a goal and determined to get to it, he wasrelentless.Nicci realized that her only hope of ever catching up with him again was,instead of chasing him, to head toward where he would go next and intercept him.She knew that the witch woman couldn’t help him find a woman who didn’t exist,so Nicci reasoned that Richard would next head north to try to get help from theonly wizard he knew, his grandfather, Zedd, at the Wizard’s Keep in Aydindril.Since she’d still been a long way back to the southeast, Nicci had decided totake the shortest route to Aydindril, thereby needing to cover much lessdistance than he would and thus be able to intercept him there.As she broke out of the narrow confines of the buildings of the city, Nicci’sheart quickened when she saw that she was right, when she finally saw Richard.He and Cara were charging up a road, pulling a long ribbon of dust behind them.Nicci recalled that they’d left Altur’Rang with six horses; they now had onlythree. By the way they were riding, Nicci strongly suspected that she knew why.When Richard had his mind set on something he was unstoppable. He had probablyridden the other horses to death.As Nicci galloped out of the city to cut them off, Richard immediately spottedher and slowed his pace. Sa’din carried her swiftly over the small rises, pastpaddocks, stables, workshops, descried market stands, a black smith’s shop, andfenced pastures with buildings for animals that were no longer there. Stands ofpine trees flashed past and she raced under the broad crowns of white oakscrowded close to the road in places.Nicci couldn’t wait to see Richard again. Her life suddenly had purpose again.She wondered if anything had happened with the witch woman to finally convincehim that there was no woman from his dreams that he remembered as real. Niccieven held out some hope that he had recovered from his delusions and was nowback to his old self. Her relief at seeing him sitting tall atop his horseovercame her concern as to why he would be racing for the Keep.Since she had been separated from him, Nicci had gone over everything that hadhappened, trying to pinpoint the source of his delusion, and she had come to afrightening theory. Going over it a thousand times in her mind, trying toremember every detail, Nicci had come to fear that she had actually been thecause of his problem.She had been, working at a rapid pace as she tried to save his life. There wereother people around creating a distraction. She was worried that enemy soldierswould attack at any moment and so she dared not slow what she was doing. Evenworse, she was attempting things she had never done before—things she’d nevereven heard of before. After all, Subtractive Magic was used to rain ruin, not toheal. She was doing things she wasn’t sure would work. She also knew that therewas no other hope and so she had no choice.But she feared that in that dangerous mix, she was the one who had accidentallyinduced the problem with Richard’s memory, with his mind. If that was true, shewould never forgive herself.If she had made a mistake with Subtractive Magic, and had eliminated someelement of his mind, some vital part that made him able to interact effectivelywith reality, there would be no way to restore such a loss. Eliminatingsomething with Subtractive Magic was as irreversible as death. If she haddamaged his mind, he would never again be the same, dwelling forever in atwilight world of his own imagination, never again able to recognize the truthof the world around him… and it would all be her fault.That thought had taken her to the edge of despair.Richard and Cara halted beside the road as they waited for Nicci to reach them.Fields of lull summer grass grew at the base of wooded hills beyond. Theirhorses took the opportunity to crop at that long grass where it came close tothe side of the road.The sight of Richard swelled Nicci’s heart with joy. His hair was a littlelonger, and he looked dusty from the ride, but he looked as taut, as lull, aspowerful, as handsome, as masterful, as incisive, as focused, as driven as healways looked, like nothing in the world around him escaped his notice. Despitehis simple and dusty travel clothes, he looked every inch the Lord Rahl himself.Still, it seemed there was something not right about him.“Richard!” Nicci called out as she raced up to him and Cara, even though theysaw her. Nicci reined in Sa’din as she reached them. Once she was stopped, thedust she had outpaced began to catch up and drift past. Richard and Cara waited.With the way Nicci had shouted they looked like they expected her to saysomething urgent, when it had been nothing more than her excitement at seeinghim.“I’m relieved to see that you’re both well,” Nicci said.Richard visibly relaxed and draped both hands over the pommel of his saddle. Hishorse shivered flies off its rump. Cara sat up straight in her saddle, her horseclose and behind Richard’s, tossing its head a little al how tightly she had himreined in after the gallop.“I’m glad to see you looking well, too,” Richard said. His warm smile said thathe meant it. Nicci could have bubbled over into joyous laughter at seeing thatsmile, but she restrained herself and simply returned it. “How did it go inAltur’Rang?” he asked. “Is the city safe?”“They destroyed the invaders.” Nicci tightened the reins to settle down anexcited Sa’din. She gave his neck a reassuring pat to help calm him down. “Thecity is safe for now. Victor and Ishaq said to tell you that they are free andwill stay that way.”Richard nodded with quiet satisfaction. “You’re all right, then? I was worriedabout you.”“Fine,” she said, unable to restrain her grin at the very idea that he had beenworried for her and not the least bit interested in telling him about injuriesthat were now healed. None of that mattered anymore. She was with Richard again.He looked weary, as if he and Cara had not gotten much sleep on their journeynorth. By the distance they had covered in such a short time, they could nothave rested much.Nicci then realized what it was that was wrong with him.He didn’t have his sword.“Richard, where’s—”Cara, behind him, flashed Nicci a forbidding look and at the same time quicklydrew a finger across her throat, warning Nicci to cut off what she had beenabout to ask.“Where are the other horses?” Nicci quickly asked, altering the course of herquestion to cover over the ominous silence that had oozed up in the brief pause.Richard sighed, apparently not realizing the truth of what she had been about toask. “I’m afraid I’ve been pushing them pretty hard. A few of them came up lameand the rest died. We’ve had to get new horses along the way. These we stolefrom an Imperial Order encampment near Galea. They have troops billeted all overthe Midlands. We helped ourselves to their horses and supplies along the way.”Cara smiled with sly satisfaction, but remained silent.Nicci wondered how he had managed such things without his sword. She thenrealized how foolish such a thought was; the sword didn’t make Richard the manhe was.“And the beast?” Nicci asked.Richard glanced over his shoulder at Cara. “We’ve had a few encounters.”For some reason, Nicci sensed something disquieting in his voice, if not hiswords.“A few encounters?” she asked. “What sort of encounters? What’s the matter?What’s wrong?”“We managed, that’s all. We’ll talk about it later when we have time.” She couldsee by the irritable look in his eyes that he was understating it and was in nomood to have to relive it right then. He pulled the reins over, taking hishorse’s attention away from the grass. “Right now I need to get up to the Keep.”“And what of the witch woman?” Nicci asked as she walked her horse alongsidehis. “What did you find out? What did she say?”“That what I seek is long buried,” he muttered dejectedly to himself. Richardwiped a weary hand across his face and then came out of his private thoughts tofix her in his penetrating gaze. “Does the word Chainfire mean anything to you?”When Nicci shook her head, he asked, “What about the Deep Nothing?”“Deep Nothing?” Nicci thought it over briefly. “No, what is it?”“I have no idea, but I need to find out. I’m hoping Zedd will be able to shedsome light on it. Come on, let’s get moving.”With that, he galloped away. Nicci immediately urged Sa’din into a gallop tokeep up."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46The road up to the Keep offered magnificent views of the city of Aydindrilspread out below, even though clouds had slipped in over the mountains to mutethe late-afternoon light and leave the still air muggy. Were it’ not for herconcerns, Nicci might have found the views from the road up to the Keep to beone of the most beautiful vistas she had ever seen—and an appreciation of suchbeauty was something relatively new to her, some thing that Richard had awakenedin her.As it was, though, she brooded over his continuing fixation on finding the womanKahlan that he was so sure he remembered. He hadn’t said anything about her,yet, probably because from their previous disagreements he had become frustratedby the futility of trying to convince her that he had to find a woman Nicci knewdid not exist. Despite not mentioning her, it was clear to Nicci that he was noless determined to find Kahlan now than he had been the last time Nicci had beenwith him. Her hopes that he would be better by the time she finally caught upwith him had faded. Her pleasure over the view dimmed.There was something, though—a look in his eyes—that seemed to Nicci somehowdifferent. She couldn’t put her finger on what it was, or what it could mean.He’d always had a penetrating gaze, a cutting, raptor-like appraisal, but now,the way he met her gaze, it was even more acute, as if he were laying her openand searching her soul. Nicci had nothing to hide, though, especially fromRichard. She had nothing but his best interest at heart. She wanted nothing morethan for him to be happy. She would do anything to help him to be happy.She supposed that was why her mood had sunk; even though he was stilldetermined, she knew that he was growing ever more dispirited. The light of lifein his eyes was something Nicci treasured. She would not want to see it go out.Trying to keep up with him left Nicci no opportunity to ask him about what hadgone on with the witch woman. From Cara’s silence, Nicci knew that, whatever hadhappened, it had not gone as well as Richard had expected. That was no surpriseto Nicci. How could a witch woman, even if she wanted to help, be of any use infinding a woman who existed only in Richard’s mind?Whatever Chainfire could be, Nicci had no idea, but she could sense in hisvoice, as well as his tense expression, how eager Richard was to discover itsmeaning. After having lived with him for so long, Nicci knew his feelingswithout him having to say a word. It was obvious he’d placed a lot ofsignificance on the meaning behind Chainfire.More than that, though, Nicci was worried as to what could have happened to hissword. She couldn’t imagine why he didn’t have it with him. Her concern had beenheightened all the more by the way Cara had immediately cut off the question, tosay nothing of the way Richard had not mentioned it. The Sword of Truth was notsomething Richard would have lightly forgotten all about.Higher up on the mountain, as they rode up the switchbacks, the road emergedfrom a thick growth of towering spruce trees before a stone bridge spanning achasm of immense depth. It looked to Nicci as if the mountain were split open toits core, with the closer side pulled away from the rest of the mountain. Asthey rode single-file across the bridge spanning the yawning abyss, she glancedover the edge and could see sheer rock walls to each side dropping down throughcottony clouds drifting by below them. It was a dizzying sight that made herstomach feel queazy.Nicci could tell by Sa’din’s gait how tired he was. His ears lazily swiveledtoward the drop to each side as they crossed the bridge. Richard and Cara’shorses, though, were lathered and blowing hard. Nicci knew how well Richardtreated animals, and yet he was showing these no mercy. He obviously thoughtthere were higher values involved than the lives of animals. She knew what thatvalue was: human life. One in particular.The walls of the Keep, composed of intricately joined blocks of dark granite,rose up like a cliff before them. Coming off the bridge, riding between Richardin front and Cara at the rear, Nicci stared up at the Keep’s complex maze oframparts, bastions, towers, connecting passageways, and bridges. The placelooked somehow alive, as if it were watching them approach the gaping entranceof arched stone where the road tunneled under the base of the outer wall.Without hesitation, Richard trotted his horse in under the raised, massiveportcullis. Given a choice, Nicci would have been a bit more cautious in herapproach to such a place. Her skin crawled with the power emanating from within.She had never before felt such a strong sense of the force of magic from withina place. It was like standing alone on a plain as a vast, massive thunderstormwas about to envelope her.The sensation gave her some measure of the shields that guarded the Keep. Fromwhat she had to conclude by what she could sense, the shields at the Palace ofthe Prophets had been child’s play by comparison. Too, those were predominantlyAdditive and the palace had been built for an entirely different purpose. Here,Subtractive shields were employed in equal service. The lethality of theirdominion was not concealed, but manifest to those whose business it was to knowof such things.Almost unnoticed, hazy clouds had closed in overhead, leaving the late-afternoonsky a flat, steel gray. The gloom that replaced the sunlight made the stone ofthe Keep look all the darker, all the more forbidding, almost as if the Keepitself had drawn a shroud of clouds tightly around itself as it watched theapproach of a sorceress and a wizard able to command powers that yet hauntedthis place.After coming out from under the arched opening in the thick outer wall, theyemerged on a road that continued through the deep interior canyon of the Keep.Beyond, the road tunneled through another dark wall that provided a secondbarrier, should one ever be necessary. Without pause, Richard rode on into thatlong, dark passageway. The sounds of the horses’ hooves echoed off the dampstone under the murky, arched passage.Beyond the tunnel, they emerged beside an expansive paddock growing thick withlush grass. The gravel road ran along the side of a wall to the right withseveral doors. The first doors they’d encountered just inside the portculliswould have been where visitors entered. Nicci surmised that this, beyond thesecond wall, was probably the working entrance to the Keep. A fence along theother side of the road enclosed the paddock. Beyond, to the left, the back sideof the paddock was walled off by the Keep itself. At the far end stood thestables.Without a word, Richard dismounted and opened the gate to the paddock, lettinghis horse go in but leaving it saddled. Perplexed, Cara and Nicci nonethelessfollowed his example before following him across the grounds toward an entrancewith a dozen wide granite steps worn smooth and swaybacked over time. They ledup into a recessed entryway where simple but heavy double doors into the Keepproper began to creak open.An old man, wavy white hair in disarray, peered out like a homeowner surprisedby visitors. He gulped air, apparently winded from having run through the Keepwhen he’d realized that someone was coming. He had no doubt been alerted by websof magic that announced anyone taking the road up to the Keep. In ancient timesthere would have been people closer at hand to see to anyone newly arrived. Nowthere was only the old man. By the way he was breathing he must have been clearacross the Keep when the alarms had warned him.Even through the look of astonishment on his thin, wrinkled face, Niccirecognized elements of the features. She knew that he could be none other thanRichard’s grandfather Zedd. He was tall, but as thin as a sapling. His hazeleyes were wide with wonder and a kind of childlike excitement, if not innocence.His plain, unadorned robes marked him as a great wizard. He wore his age well.It was a pleasing preview of how, in part, time might treat Richard.The old man threw his arms up over his head. “Richard!” A joyous grin sweptacross his face. “Bags, is that really you, my boy?”Zedd emerged from the doorway and started down the worn steps into the drearylight.Richard ran to his grandfather and lifted him off the steps, hugging himfiercely enough to drive the wind from the already winded old man. They bothlaughed, a pleasing sound with obvious kinship.“Zedd! You can’t imagine how glad I am to see you!”“And you, my boy,” Zedd said in a voice turning teary. “It’s been too long. Fartoo long.”He reached a sticklike hand past Richard and gripped Cara’s shoulder. “How areyou, my dear? You appear to be near to spent. Are you all right?”“I am Mord-Sith,” she said, looking a bit indignant. “Of course I’m all right.Why would you think I look anything but perfectly fine?”Zedd chuckled as he pushed back from Richard. “No reason, I suppose. You bothlook like you could use some rest and a meal or two is all. But you do look fineand I’m mighty happy to see you again.”Cara smiled at that. “I’ve missed you, Zedd.”Zedd waggled a finger. “Not very Mord-Sith of you to miss an old man. Rikka willbe astonished to hear such a thing.”“Rikka?” Cara asked in surprise. “Rikka is here?”Zedd waggled a hand back in the direction of the partly opened door. “She’s backin there, somewhere… patrolling, I imagine. She seems to have two preoccupationsin life, patrolling and harassing me. I’m telling you, I have no peace of mindwith the woman. Worse, she’s too clever for her own good. At least she’s atalented cook.”Cara’s brows lifted. “Rikka can cook?”Zedd winced, pulling a breath through his teeth. “Don’t tell her I said that orI’ll never hear the end of it. The woman—”“Zedd,” Richard interrupted, “I have trouble and I need help.”“Are you well? You aren’t ill, are you? You don’t look entirely yourself, myboy.” Zedd pressed a hand to Richard’s forehead. “Summer fevers are the worst,you know. Heat on top of heat. Bad combination.”“Yes—no—I mean, it’s not that. I need to talk to you.”“So talk. It has been a long time. Far too long of a time. What’s it been? Twoyears this past spring, if I’m not mistaken.” Zedd drew back a bit and squeezedRichard’s arms as he looked him up and down. “Richard, where’s your sword?”“Look, we’ll talk about that later,” Richard said, irritably disengaging himselffrom Zedd’s grip in order to wave away the question.“You said you wanted to talk. So talk and tell me where your sword is.” Zeddredirected his broad grin at Nicci. “And who is this lovely sorceress you’vebrought along?”Richard blinked at Zedd’s smile and then glanced at Nicci. “Oh, sorry. Zedd,this is Nicci. Nicci, this—”“Nicci!” Zedd roared as he danced back up two of the steps as if he’d spotted aviper. “The Sister of the Dark who took you away to the Old World? That Nicci?What are you doing with this vile creature? Why would you dare to bring such awoman—”“Zedd,” Richard said, forcefully cutting his grandfather off. “Nicci is afriend.”“A friend! Are you out of your mind, Richard? How in the world do you expect—”“Zedd, she’s on our side now.” He gestured heatedly. “Much the same as Cara, orRikka. Things change. Before, either of them would have…”His voice trailed off as his grandfather stared at him. “You know what I mean. Itrust Cara with my life, now, and she has proven worthy of my trust. I trustNicci the same. I trust them both with my life.”Zedd finally gripped Richard’s shoulder and gave it an affectionate joggle. “Iguess I do know what you mean. Since I gave you the Sword of Truth you’vechanged a great many things for the better. Why, I would never in my life haveimagined that one day I’d happily be eating meals cooked by a Mord-Sith. Anddelicious meals they are, too.” He caught himself and pointed at Cara. “If youtell her I said that I’ll skin you alive. The woman is already incorrigible.”Cara only smiled.Zedd redirected his gaze to Nicci. He didn’t have that raptorlike Rahl quality,but in its own way it was just as disarming and looked to have the potential tobe just as disturbing.“Welcome, sorceress. If Richard says you are a friend, then you are. Sorry toget so huffy.”Nicci smiled. “Perfectly understandable. I didn’t like myself back then either.I was under the influence of dark delusions. I was called Death’s Mistress forgood reason.” Nicci gazed into Richard’s gray eyes. “Your grandson brought me tosee the beauty of life.”Zedd smiled proudly. “Yes, that’s it exactly. The beauty of life.”Richard pounced on the opening. “And life is what this is about. Zedd, listen, Ineed—”“Yes, yes,” Zedd said, waving off Richard’s impatience. “You always needsomething. Haven’t been back long enough to get in the door and already you wantto know something. If I recall correctly, the first word you ever spoke was‘why.’“Come on, then, come inside. I want to know why you don’t have the Sword ofTruth with you. I know you wouldn’t let anything happen to it, but I want tohear the whole story. Don’t leave out a thing. Come along, then.”Motioning them all to follow, Richard’s grandfather climbed the stairs towardthe doorway.“Zedd! I need—”“Yes, yes, my boy. You need something. I heard you the first time. I think itlooks like rain. No use getting started when we’re about to get wet. Come insideand I will hear what you have to say.” Zedd’s voice began echoing as hedisappeared into the darkness. “You look like you could use a meal. Is anyoneelse hungry? Reunions always give me an appetite.”Richard’s arms dropped, his hands flopping against his thighs in frustration. Hesighed and then hurried up the steps after his grandfather. Nicci knew that hadit been anyone else, Richard would have handled it quite differently. People wholoved you, and had raised you since you were little, and had comforted you whenyou cried at a thunderstorm or the howl of a wolf tended to be disarming to dealwith. She could see that it was no different with Richard. His love of hisgrandfather tied his hands with unbreakable ropes of respect.It was a view of Richard Nicci had never seen before, and one she found quiteendearing. Here was the Lord Rahl, the leader of the D’Haran Empire, the Seekerof Truth, a man who could make just about anyone tremble with a look, brought toflustered silence by a kindly if bewildering lecture. Had the matters involvednot been so serious, Nicci would have been unable to keep herself from grinningat Richard’s utter helplessness before such a frail-looking old man.The sound of water reverberated inside the dark anteroom. Zedd cast a handcasually to the side and a lamp on the wall lit. At the ignition of the flameNicci recognized the reiteration of a spark of power that marked it as a keylamp. With a succession of whooshing sounds, starting on both sides of theentrance, hundreds of lamps around the vast room lit in pairs. Each whoosh as apair of lamps caught flame was followed almost simultaneously by another as thelamps around the huge room each took to flame from the engendering magicinitiated by the key lamp, the effect being a ring of fire seeming to dance itsway around the room. Nicci knew that it would have worked the same had someonelit that particular lamp with a flame rather than magic. The light in the roomswelled, and in a span of seconds the anteroom was nearly as bright as day.A clover-leaf-shaped fountain stood centered in the tiled floor. Water spoutedhigh into the air above the top bowl, from where it cascaded down eachsuccessive tier of ever wider, scalloped bowls, finally running from pointsaround the bottom bowl in perfectly matched arcs into the surrounding poolcontained by an outer wall of variegated white marble made wide enough to act asa bench.All the way around the oval-shaped room, highly polished, deep red marblecolumns stood below arches supporting a continuous balcony. A hundred feetoverhead a section of glassed roof let in some of the somber, late-day light tobalance the glow of the lamps down in the heart of the room. At night, theglassed roof would probably also let in the soft cold light of the moon to givethe darkened room a spectral feel, but with it being the new moon, to saynothing of the gathering clouds, there would be no moonlight this night. By thelook of the sky through the glassed roof section, Nicci thought that Zedd wasright; it did look like it might rain.Belying first impressions of the Keep, the room was a beautiful, warm entranceto what seemed such a cold and austere exterior. It hinted at the life the placeonce held. Like the forsaken city down in the valley, Nicci was rather saddenedby the emptiness.“Welcome to the Wizard’s Keep. Perhaps we all should—”“Zedd,” Richard growled, cutting his grandfather short, “I need to talk to you.Right now. It’s important.”Beloved grandfather or not, Nicci could see that Richard was at the end of hispatience. Tight, white knuckles stood out in stark contrast against his tannedskin and the prominent veins on the backs of his fists. Judging by the way helooked, he hadn’t gotten much sleep in recent days or had much to eat. Shedidn’t think that she had ever seen him looking this exhausted or this near hiswits’ end. Cara, as well, looked well past the limits of her endurance, althoughshe did a good job of covering it; Mord-Sith were trained to ignore physicaldiscomfort. Despite being overjoyed at seeing his grandfather, Richard’spreoccupation with finding the woman from his imagination had cut thepleasantries of the reunion short.The mad rush that had become life, since that day he had been shot with thearrow and had nearly died, seemed to have come down to this moment.Zedd blinked in innocent surprise. “Well of course, Richard, of course.” Hespread his arms as he spoke in a gentle voice. “You know that you can alwaystalk to me. Whatever is on your mind, you know that—”“What’s Chainfire?”That was nearly the first thing he had asked of Nicci, too.Zedd stood unmoving, a blank look on his face. “Chainfire,” he repeated in aflat tone.“Yes, Chainfire.”A serious expression weighing on his face, Zedd considered the question withcare, turning toward the fountain as he thought it over. The waiting was almostpainful. The fountain burbled and splashed and echoed in the otherwise silentroom.“Chainfire,” Zedd drawled to himself as he ran a sticklike finger along hissmooth jawbone while staring into the tumbling, dancing water cascading downeach successive tier of the fountain. Nicci stole a glance at Cara, but theMord-Sith was unreadable. Her drawn face looked as tired and ill-fed asRichard’s, but, being Cara, she stood tall and straight, not allowing herexhaustion to get the better of her.“That’s right. Chainfire,” Richard said impatiently through gritted teeth. “Doyou know what it means?”Zedd turned back to his grandson, lifting open his hands. He looked not onlypuzzled but apologetic.“I’m sorry, Richard, but I’ve never heard the word Chainfire before.”The fury leaving him, Richard looked like he might fall down. The disappointmentwas only too evident in his eyes. His shoulders slumped as he let out a breath.Cara carefully, but quietly, slipped a step closer, ready to help him if hecollapsed. To Nicci, that looked like a real possibility.“Richard,” Zedd said, his voice taking on an edge, “where is your sword?”Richard erupted. “It’s just a piece of steel!”“Just a piece—”Richard’s face went crimson. “It’s just a stupid chunk of metal! Don’t you thinkthat there might be more important things to worry about?”Zedd cocked his head. “More important things? What are you talking about?”“I want my life back!”Zedd stared at him, but remained silent, and in doing so thereby almostcommanded his grandson to say something more to fill in some of the blanks.Richard paced from the fountain to a broad band of triple steps that led upbetween two of the red marble pillars. A long red and gold carpet bordered withsimple, black geometric designs ran between the pillars off under a balcony andinto the darkness.Richard raked the fingers of both hands back through his hair. “What differencedoes it make? No one believes me. No one will help me find her.”Nicci felt a deep sense of sorrow for him. At that moment she regretted everyharsh thing she had ever said trying to convince him that he had only dreamed upKahlan. He needed to be helped over his delusions, but, at that moment, shewould have been happy to let him hold on to them if it would have brought thelight of life back into his eyes.She longed to hold him and tell him that it would be all right, but shecouldn’t, for more reasons than one.Cara, arms hanging straight at her sides, looked just as saddened to see Richardagonizing so. There seemed no end in sight. Nicci suspected that the Mord-Sithwould have agreed with Nicci to let Richard have his beautiful dream of thewoman he loved. But a lie would not soothe such real pain.“Richard, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but what does it have to dowith the Sword of Truth?” Zedd asked, the edge returning to his voice.Richard closed his eyes a moment against the torment of saying aloud what he hadsaid so many times, so many times when no one ever believed him.“I have to find Kahlan.”Nicci could see him draw tighter, bracing for the usual disconcerting questionsas to who he was talking about and where he could ever have gotten such anotion. Nicci could see that it was almost too much for him to bear anotherperson telling him he was imagining things, questioning his sanity. She couldsee him dreading it even more coming from his grandfather.Zedd tilted his head a little. “Kahlan?”“Yes,” Richard said with a sigh and without looking up, “Kahlan. But youwouldn’t know who I’m talking about.”Ordinarily, Richard would have launched into a ready explanation, but now helooked too dejected to want to bother to explain yet again, to be greeted withincredulity and disbelieving questions.“Kahlan.” Zedd’s brow drew down in cautious query. “Kahlan Amnell? Is that theKahlan you’re talking about?”Nicci froze.Richard looked up, his eyes wide. “What did you say?” he whispered.“Kahlan Amnell? That Kahlan?”Nicci’s heart skipped a beat. Cara’s jaw had dropped.In a blink, Richard had the front of Zedd’s robes in his fists and had liftedthe old man clear of the floor. Richard’s sweat-slicked muscles glistened in thelamplight.“You said her whole name, Kahlan Amnell. I didn’t tell you her whole name. Yousaid it on your own.”Zedd was looking more confused by the moment. “But, that’s because the onlyKahlan I know of is Kahlan Amnell.”“You know Kahlan—you know who I’m talking about?”“The Mother Confessor?”“Yes, the Mother Confessor!”“Well, of course. Most people know her, I expect. Richard, what’s gotten intoyou? Let me down.”Nicci felt dizzy. She couldn’t believe her own ears. How was such a thingpossible? It wasn’t. It was so overwhelmingly, inconceivably impossible that shethought she might faint.His hands trembling, Richard set his grandfather down. “What do you mean,everyone knows her?”Zedd pulled on each sleeve in turn, pulling them back down his skinny arms. Herearranged his disheveled robes at his hips, all the time watching his grandson.He looked truly bewildered by Richard’s behavior.“Richard, what’s the matter with you? How could they not know her? She’s theMother Confessor, for crying out loud.”Richard swallowed. “Where is she?”Zedd shot a brief, confused glance at Cara and then Nicci before looking back atRichard.“Why, down at the Confessors’ Palace.”Richard let out a cry of joy and threw his arms around his grandfather."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47Gripping his grandfather’s skinny shoulders, Richard shook the old man. “She’shere? Kahlan is at the Confessors’ Palace?”Worry spreading across Zedd’s wrinkled face, he cautiously nodded.With the back of his hand, Richard wiped away the tears running down his cheek.“She’s here,” he said, turning to Cara. He gripped her shoulders and gave her afirm shake. “She’s in Aydindril. Did you hear? I wasn’t imagining it. Zeddremembers her. He knows the truth.”Cara looked as if she were doing her best to come to grips with her astonishmentwithout letting it be mistaken for unhappiness at the startling news.“Lord Rahl… I’m… happy for you—really I am—but I don’t see how…”Richard, not seeming to notice the Mord-Sith’s halting uncertainty, turned backto the wizard. “What’s she doing down there?” he asked, his voice bubbling overwith excitement.Zedd, looking gravely troubled, again glanced to both Cara and Nicci beforetenderly laying a hand on Richard’s shoulder.“Richard, that’s where she’s buried.”The world seemed to stop.In a flash of understanding, Nicci realized the truth.Suddenly, it all became clear. Zedd’s behavior now made sense. The woman Zeddwas talking about was not the Kahlan, the Mother Confessor, from Richard’simagination, the woman he imagined loved him and had married him.It was the real Mother Confessor.Nicci had warned Richard that in his dream he had done a dangerous thing byimagining a woman as his bride who was not simply some anonymous imaginarywoman, but, instead, was a woman he had heard of before—a woman who, it sohappened, was well known in the Midlands. This was the real Kahlan Amnell, thereal Mother Confessor, who was buried down at the Confessors’ Palace, not theone Richard had dreamed up to be his love. It had been this very reality thatNicci had feared would eventually come to shatter Richard’s world.She had warned him that this was bound to happen. She had warned him that hewould one day come face-to-face with the truth. This was the moment, this wasthe very thing she had been trying to prevent.Still, Nicci felt no joy at all in being right. She felt only crushing sadnessat what Richard must be feeling. She couldn’t even begin to imagine howconfusing, how disorienting, it had to be for him. For someone as firmlygrounded in reality as Richard always had been, this entire ordeal had to bedevastating.Richard could only stare.“Richard,” Zedd finally said, giving him a gentle squeeze on his arms, “are youall right? What’s going on?”Richard slowly blinked. He looked in a state of shock.“What do you mean she’s buried down at the Confessors’ Palace?” he asked in ashaky voice. “When did it happen?”Zedd guardedly licked his lips. “I don’t know when she died. When I was downthere—when Jagang’s army was marching on Aydindril—I saw the grave marker. Ididn’t know her. I just saw her grave, that’s all. It’s a pretty big marker. Itwould be hard to miss. The Confessors were all killed by the quads that DarkenRahl sent. She must have died back then.“Richard, you couldn’t possibly have known the woman; she had to have been deadand buried before we ever left our home in Westland—back before the boundarycame down. Back when you were still a woods guide in the Hartland forest.”Richard pressed his palms to his forehead. “No, no, you don’t understand. You’rehaving the same problem as everyone else. It’s not her. You know Kahlan.”Zedd lifted a sympathetic hand toward his grandson. “Richard, that’s notpossible. The quads killed the Confessors.”“Yes, the other Confessors were killed by those assassins, but not her, notKahlan.” Richard waved a hand as he dismissed the argument. “Zedd, she’s the onewho came to ask you to appoint the Seeker—that’s why we left Westland. You knowKahlan.”Zedd frowned. “What in the world are you talking about? We had to leave whenDarken Rahl came hunting us. We had to run for our lives.”“In part, but Kahlan came looking for you first. She’s the one who told us thatDarken Rahl had put the boxes of Orden in play. He was on the other side of theboundary; if not for Kahlan coming, how would we have even known?”Zedd peered at Richard as if he suspected he might be quite ill. “Richard, whenthe boxes of Orden are put into play, the snake vine grows. It even says so inThe Book of Counted Shadows. You, of all people, know that. You were in theUpper Ven and were bitten by a snake vine. It caused a fever and you came to mefor help. That’s how we knew the boxes of Orden were in play. Darken Rahl thencame to Westland and attacked us.”“Well, yes, that’s all true, in a way, but Kahlan told us what was happening inthe Midlands—she confirmed it.” Richard growled in frustration. “It’s more thanthat, more than her coming to ask you to appoint a Seeker. You know her.”“I’m afraid that I don’t, Richard.”“Dear spirits, Zedd, you spent last winter with her and the D’Haran army. WhenNicci took me down to the Old World, Kahlan was there with Cara and you.” Hepointed insistently at Cara, as if it would somehow prove the point and end thenightmare. “She and Cara fought with you all winter.”Zedd glanced up at Cara. Cara, behind Richard’s back, turned her palms up andshrugged at Zedd to let him know that she didn’t know any more about it thanZedd did.“As long as you brought up the business about you being the Seeker, where isyour—”Richard snapped his fingers, his face suddenly lighting up.“That’s not Kahlan’s grave.”“Of course it is. There’s no mistaking this grave. It’s prominent and I clearlyrecall that it has her name carved right in the stone.”“Yes, it’s her name, but not her grave. I realize what you’re talking about,now.” Richard chuckled with relief. “I’m telling you, it’s not her grave.”Zedd didn’t think it was funny. “Richard, I’ve seen her name on the stone. It’sher, the Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell.”Richard shook his head insistently. “No, that’s not her. That was a trick—”“A trick?” Zedd cocked his head, frowning. “What are you talking about? Whatsort of trick?”“They were hunting her—the Order was after Kahlan when they occupied Aydindril.They had taken over the council, condemned her to death, and they were huntingher. To keep them from chasing her, you put a death spell on her—”“What! A death spell! Richard, do you have any idea of the magnitude of whatyou’re suggesting?”“Of course I do. But it’s true. You needed to feign her death so that the Orderwould think they had succeeded and wouldn’t come after her—so that she could getaway. Don’t you remember? You made that headstone, or at least you had it made.I came here to find her—it was a few years back. Your spell even fooled me. Ithought she was dead. But she wasn’t.”His confusion had receded and now Zedd was looking seriously worried. “Richard,I can’t imagine what is wrong with you, but this is simply—”“You two escaped to safety but you left me a message on her headstone,” Richardsaid, jabbing a finger at Zedd’s chest, “so that I would know that she wasreally still alive. So that I wouldn’t despair. So that I wouldn’t give up. Ialmost did, but then I figured it out.”Zedd was nearly boiling over with frustration, impatience, and concern. Nicciknew the feeling.“Bags, my boy, what message are you talking about?”“The words on the headstone. The inscription. It was a message to me.”Zedd planted his fists on his hips. “What are you talking about? What message?What was this message?”Richard started pacing, pressing his fingertips to his temples as he mumbled tohimself, apparently trying to recall the exact wording.Or, Nicci thought, trying to dream it up the way he always dreamed up answers totalk his way out of facing the truth. She knew that this time he was making amistake that would catch him up. Reality was closing in around him, even if hedidn’t yet recognize it. He soon would.Nicci dreaded that unequivocal juncture of delusion and truth. Despite wantingRichard to get better, to get over the false memories he had been suffering, shedreaded the pain she knew it would bring him when he eventually cameface-to-face with the unambiguous truth. Even more, she dreaded what wouldhappen to him if he couldn’t see the truth, or refused to see it, if he sankforever deeper into a world of illusion.“Not here,” he muttered. “Something about not being here. And something about myheart.”Zedd pushed his cheek out with his tongue, apparently in an effort to keep stillwhile he watched his grandson pacing back and forth and at the same timeprobably tried to imagine what could be happening to him.“No,” Richard said abruptly as he halted. “No, not my heart. That’s not what itsaid. It’s a big monument. I remember now. It said, ‘Kahlan Amnell. MotherConfessor. She is not here, but in the hearts of those who love her.’“It was a message for me not to give up hope because she wasn’t really dead—shewasn’t really there, in that grave.”“Richard,” Zedd said in soft consolation, “it’s a common enough thing to say ona grave marker, that someone isn’t dead but rather lives on in the hearts ofthose who love her. Gravediggers probably have stacks of grave markers made upwith that sentiment, carved with those very words.”“But she wasn’t buried there! She wasn’t! It says that—’she is not here’—for areason.”“Then who is buried in her grave?” Zedd asked.Richard went still for a moment.“No one,” he finally said, his gaze wandering off as he thought. “MistressSanderholt—the cook at the palace—she was fooled by your death spell likeeveryone else. When I finally got here she told me that you stood there on theplatform while Kahlan was beheaded—she was in mourning over it and terriblyupset—but I realized that you wouldn’t do such a thing and so it had to be oneof your tricks. You told me that—remember? Sometimes the best magic is just atrick.”Zedd nodded. “That part is true enough.”“Mistress Sanderholt told me that Kahlan’s body had been burned in a funeralpyre, the whole thing supervised by the First Wizard himself. She said thatKahlan’s ashes were then buried before that immense stone marker. MistressSanderholt even took me out to the secluded courtyard beside the palace whereConfessors are buried. She showed me the grave. I was horrified. I thought itwas her, that she was dead, until I figured out the message carved in thestone—the message the two of you left for me to find.”Richard gripped his grandfather’s shoulders again. “Do you see? It was just atrick to throw our enemies off her trail. She wasn’t really dead. She wasn’treally buried there. Nothing is buried there, except maybe some ashes.”Nicci thought that it was rather convenient that Richard imagined her beingcremated in his story of the death-spell bluff so that all that remained wereashes that couldn’t be identified. He always came up with something that to hismind logically explained the lack of evidence. Nicci didn’t know if Confessorsreally were cremated, but if they were, that would only provide him with anotheruseful pretext to prop up his story so that he could continue to deny that itwas her. They would again have no way to prove otherwise.Unless, of course, he was dreaming up the funeral pyre part of his story andConfessors weren’t ordinarily cremated.“And so you say that you went there?” Zedd asked. “Down to where the gravestonestands?”“Yes, and then Denna came—”“Denna was dead,” Cara said, interrupting for the first time. “You killed her inorder to escape from her at the People’s Palace. She couldn’t have been there…unless of course she appeared as a spirit.”“Yes, that’s right,” Richard said, turning to Cara. “She did. She came as aspirit and took me to a place between worlds so that I could be with Kahlanthere.”Cara’s eyes briefly turned to the wizard. Her incredulity was impossible for herto mask so she looked away from Richard and occupied herself with scratching theback of her neck.Nicci wanted to scream. His story grew more insanely convoluted by the moment.She remembered the Prelate once teaching Nicci as a novice how the seed of lies,once planted, only grew more tangled and out of control over time.Zedd came up from behind and gently grasped Richard’s shoulders.“Come on, my boy. I think you need to get some rest and then afterwards we can—”“No!” Richard cried out as he twisted away. “I’m not imagining it! I’m notmaking it up!”Nicci knew he was doing just that. In a certain sense, it was remarkable the wayhe was able, on the spot, to weave new events, based on his original delusion,to continually manage to escape the trap of the truth.But he could not escape it forever. There was the matter of the true MotherConfessor buried in the grave and that was all too real—unless it turned outthat the Midlands actually did cremate their Confessors, in which case Richardwould be able to continue to hobble along, clinging to his dream for a littlewhile longer, until the next problem cropped up. Sooner or later, though,something was going to shatter those dreams.Zedd tried again. “Richard, you’re tired. You look like you’ve been living on ahorse for—”“I can prove it,” Richard said in calm defiance.Everyone went quiet.“You don’t believe me, I know. None of you do—but I can prove it.”“What do you mean?” Zedd asked.“Come on. Come with me down to the gravestone.”“Richard, I told you, the gravestone very well could say what you said youremember, but that proves nothing. It’s a common enough sentiment to express ona gravestone.”“Do they typically burn the bodies of the Mother Confessor on a funeral pyre? Orwas that just part of your trick so that you wouldn’t have to produce her bodyat the funeral when she was supposedly buried.”Zedd was beginning to look more than just a little indignant. “When I used tolive here the bodies of Confessors were never desecrated. The Mother Confessorwas placed in a silver-clad coffin in her white dress and the people wereallowed to view her one last time, to say their farewells, before she wasburied.”Richard glared at his grandfather, at Cara, and finally at Nicci. “Good. If Ihave to dig up the grave and prove to all of you that there is nothing buriedunder the gravestone, then that’s what I will do. We need to get this settled sothat we can move on to the solution to what’s happening. In order to do that, Ineed you all to believe me.”Zedd spread his hands. “Richard, that isn’t necessary.”“Yes it is! It is necessary! I want my life back!”No one offered an argument.“Zedd, have I ever told you a malicious lie?”“No, my boy, you never have.”“I’m not lying now.”“Richard,” Nicci said, “no one is saying that you’re lying, only that you’resuffering the unfortunate effects of delirium induced by an injury. It’s notyour fault. We all know you aren’t doing this deliberately.”He turned to his grandfather. “Zedd, don’t you see? Think about it. Something isgoing wrong in the world. Something is terribly wrong. For some reason that Ihaven’t been able to figure out, I’m the only one who is aware of it. I’m theonly one who remembers Kahlan. There has to be something behind this. Somethingwicked. Maybe Jagang is responsible.”“Jagang had the beast created to come after you,” Nicci said. “He put everythinginto that effort. He wouldn’t need to do anything else. Besides, with the beastalready stalking you, what purpose would it serve?”“I don’t know. I don’t have all the answers, but I know the truth of part ofit.”“And how can it be that you alone know the truth and everyone else is wrong,that everyone’s memory but yours has failed them?” Zedd asked.“I don’t know the answer to that, either, but I can prove what I’m telling you.I can show you the grave. Come on.”“I told you, Richard, the marker says common words.”Richard’s expression turned dangerous. “Then we will dig up the grave so thatyou can all see that it’s empty and that I’m not crazy.”Zedd lifted a hand toward the still open door. “But it will be dark soon. What’smore, it’s going to rain.”Richard turned back from the doorway. “We have an extra horse. We can still makeit down there while we have daylight. If we need to, we can use lanterns. If Imust, I will dig in the dark. This is more important than worrying about alittle rain or the lack of light. I need to get this over—now—so that we can geton to solving the very real problem and so that I can find Kahlan before it’stoo late. Let’s go.”Zedd gestured heatedly. “Richard, this is—”“Let him do as he asks,” Nicci said, interrupting, drawing all eyes. “We’ve allheard enough. This is important to him. We must allow him to do as he thinks hemust. It’s the only chance we have to finally settle the matter.”Before Zedd could answer her, a Mord-Sith appeared from between two red pillarsat the opposite side of the room. Her blond hair was pulled back into a singlebraid like Cara’s. She wasn’t quite as tall as Cara, and not as lean, but shelooked just as formidable in the way she carried herself, as if she fearednothing and lived for an excuse to prove it.“What’s going on? I heard—” She stared in sudden astonishment. “Cara? Is thatyou?”“Rikka,” Cara said with a smile and a nod, “it’s good to see your face again.”Rikka bowed her head to Cara more deeply than Cara had before staring atRichard. She stepped forward into the room.Her eyes widened. “Lord Rahl, I haven’t seen you since…”Richard nodded. “Since the People’s Palace, in D’Hara. When I came to close thegateway to the underworld you were one of the Mord-Sith who helped get me up tothe Garden of Life. You were the one who held my shirt at my left shoulder asall of you guided me safely through the palace. One of your sister Mord-Sithgave her life that night that I might complete my mission.”Rikka smiled in astonishment. “You remember. We were all in our red leather. Ican’t believe you have that good a memory that you could remember me, much lessthat I was the one at your left shoulder.” She bowed her head. “And you honor usall to remember one who fell in battle.”“I do have a good memory.” Richard cast a dark glare at Nicci and then Zedd.“That was just before I came back to Aydindril and the gravestone with Kahlan’sname on it.” He turned back to Rikka. “Watch over the Keep, will you, Rikka? Weall have to go down to the city for a while.”“Of course, Lord Rahl,” Rikka said, bowing her head again, looking almost giddyto be in Richard’s presence, and to be remembered.Richard again swept his raptorlike glare across the rest of them. “Let’s go.”Richard vanished out the doorway. Zedd caught Nicci’s sleeve on her way by.“He was hurt, wasn’t he?” When she hesitated, he went on. “You said he wassuffering delusions from being injured.”Nicci nodded. “He was shot with an arrow. He almost died.”“Nicci healed him.” Cara leaned in as she spoke in a low voice. “She saved LordRahl’s life.”Zedd lifted an eyebrow. “A friend indeed.”“I healed him,” Nicci confirmed, “but it was difficult beyond anything I’ve everattempted before. I may have saved his life, but I now worry that I didn’t do agood enough job of it.”“What do you mean?” Zedd asked.“I fear that I may have somehow done something to cause his delusions.”“That isn’t true,” Cara said.“I wonder if it is,” Nicci said, “if I might have done more, or done thingsdifferently.”She swallowed past the lump growing in her throat. She feared that it was true,that Richard’s problem was her fault, that she hadn’t acted quickly enough, orthat she might have done something dreadfully wrong. She constantly fretted overher decision that terrible morning to get Richard to a safe place before workingon him. She had feared an attack that would have fatally interrupted her effortsto heal him, but maybe if she would have simply started right then and there onthe battlefield he might not now be chasing phantoms.After all, an attack never had come, so she’d made the wrong judgment aboutneeding to get him to the deserted farmhouse. She didn’t know at the time thatno attack was imminent, but maybe if she would have taken the time to haveVictor’s men scout the area she could have started healing Richard much sooner.She hadn’t done that because she feared that if they scouted, and she was rightabout more of the enemy being nearby, then they would have had to move Richardanyway, and by then his time would have run out.Even so, she was the one who had made the decisions and Richard was the one nowsuffering delusions. Something had gone wrong that terrible night.There was no one in the world who mattered to her more than Richard. She fearedthat she was the one who had caused him the harm that was ruining his life.“What exactly was wrong with him?” Zedd asked. “Where was he shot with thearrow?”“In the left side of his chest—with a barbed bolt from a crossbow. That barbedhead lodged in his chest without penetrating all the way through his back. Hewas able to partially deflect it, so it just missed his heart, but his lung andchest were rapidly filling with blood.”Zedd lifted an eyebrow in astonishment. “And you were able to get the arrow outand heal him?”“That’s right,” Cara confirmed with forceful passion. “She saved Lord Rahl’slife.”“I don’t know…” Nicci had difficulty putting it all into words. “I’ve beenseparated from him as I made my way here. Now that I see him again, see how hehas latched so strongly onto his delusion and can’t come to see the truth, I’mnot so sure I did him any good. How can he live if he can’t see the truth of theworld around him? While his body may be healed, he’s suffering a dreadful kindof slow death as his mind fails him.”Zedd gave her shoulder a fatherly pat. Nicci recognized the light of life in hiseyes. It was the same spark that Richard had. At least the same spark he used tohave.“We’ll just have to help him see the truth.”“And if it destroys his heart?” she asked.Zedd smiled. It reminded her of Richard’s smile, the smile she missed so much.“Then we’ll just have to heal his heart, now won’t we?”Nicci was unable to bring forth more than a whisper that bordered on tears. “Andhow are we to do that?”Zedd smiled again and gave her shoulder a firm squeeze. “We’ll have to see.First we have to let him see the truth, then we can worry about healing thewound it will bring his heart.”Nicci could only nod. She dreaded seeing Richard hurt.“And what is this beast you mentioned? The one Jagang created?”“A weapon created with the use of Sisters of the Dark,” Nicci said. “Somethingfrom the time of the great war.”Zedd cursed under his breath at the news. Cara looked like she had something tosay about the beast, but she thought better of it and instead started for thedoor. “Come on. I don’t want Lord Rahl to get too far ahead of us.”Zedd grumbled his agreement. “Looks like we’re going to get wet.”“At least if it rains,” the Mord-Sith said, “it will wash some of the horse offof me.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 48The drizzle started before they were out of the paddock. Richard was alreadygone. There was no telling how far ahead of them he had gotten. Cara wanted tohurry and catch up with him, but Zedd told her that they knew where he was goingand there was no point in risking breaking the leg of one of the tired horsesbecause, if that happened, then they would only end up having to walk down themountain after Richard and then, after visiting the graveyard of the Confessors,walk all the way back up.“Besides,” Zedd told her, “you’ll never be able to catch him.”“Well, you might be right about that,” Cara said as she spurred her horse into acanter, “but I don’t want him alone any longer than necessary. I’m hisprotection.”“Especially since he’s without his sword,” Zedd muttered sourly.They had little choice but to hurry after Cara.By the time they’d raced down the mountain and reached the city, the daylightwas fading and the drizzle strengthening. Nicci knew they were going to besoaked before it was over, but there was no helping it. Fortunately, it was warmenough that at least they wouldn’t be freezing in the wet weather.Knowing where Richard would be, they made their way to the grounds of theConfessors’ Palace where they quickly found his horse, tied to one of the ringsholding chains strung between decorative granite stanchions. Since there was noopening in the chains, they were apparently meant to indicate a private area ofthe grounds. After the three of them tied their horses alongside Richard’s, Caraand Nicci followed Zedd as he stepped over the chain.This was clearly not a place where outsiders were welcome. The secludedcourtyard was screened from public view by a row of tall elms and a dense wallof evergreen junipers. Through the thick branches of the grand trees Nicci sawglimpses of the white walls of the Confessors’ Palace looming close by,enfolding and sheltering the wooded graveyard.Because of the way it was hidden away, Nicci had expected it to be small, butthe place where Confessors were buried was actually quite extensive. Trees wereplaced so as to cut the openness and give each section of the graveyard anintimate feel. By the manner in which it was laid out, with a path and a smallvine-covered colonnade ushering people approaching from the palace, it wasapparently intended to be accessed solely from the palace through elegant,double glassed doors. In the muted gray light the quiet place beneath the canopyof trees had a hallowed feel to it.They found Richard up a slight rise in what would be the shady courtyard were itsunny, standing in the drizzle before a polished stone monument, running hisfingers through the letters carved in the granite, through the letters of thename KAHLAN.Somewhere on the grounds to the Confessors’ Palace Richard had managed to findshovels and picks. They lay at the ready nearby. Scanning the area, Nicci sawthat there were storage buildings for grounds keepers set back among hedgespartly hidden around a corner of the palace and reasoned that Richard had foundthem there.As she quietly approached him, Nicci knew that Richard was on the brink ofsomething potentially very dangerous… to him. She stood behind him, handsfolded, waiting, as he tenderly touched Kahlan’s name in stone.“Richard,” Nicci finally said in a soft voice, feeling the need for a reverenttone in such a place, “I hope that you will think about everything I’ve toldyou, and if things don’t turn out the way at this moment you believe they will,know that we will all help you in any way we can.”He turned away from her name in stone. “Don’t be worried about me, Nicci. Thereis nothing under this ground. She isn’t here. I’m going to show that to all ofyou and then you will have to believe me. I’m going to get my life back. When Ido, then you’re all going to understand that something is very wrong. Then we’regoing to have to work to find out what’s going on and we’re going to findKahlan.”After holding her gaze for a moment, waiting to see if she would dare tochallenge him, Richard, without another word, snatched up a shovel and with aforceful push of his foot, sank the blade into the slightly mounded grassyground in front of the stone marker to the dead Mother Confessor.Zedd stood nearby, silent, unmoving, as he watched. He’d brought two lanternswith him. They sat on a stone bench nearby, giving off a weak but steady glow inthe still dampness. The drizzle was giving rise to ground fog. Although the skywas completely covered over with iron gray clouds, by the failing light Niccithought that it must be just after sunset. With it being the darkest night ofthe new moon, and with thick clouds to hide even the stars, it was going to be ablackest of nights.Even without the drizzle and approaching darkness, it was a miserable time to bedigging up dead people.As Richard worked with a kind of controlled but focused anger, Cara finallypicked up another shovel. “The sooner we get this over with, the better.”She plunged her shovel into the damp ground and started helping Richard dig.Zedd stood nearby, silent and grim as he watched. Nicci would have helped get itover with, but she doubted that more than two people would have room to digwithout getting in the way of each other. She might have used magic toaccomplish the deed of opening the ground, but she had a strong sense that Zeddwould not have approved, that he wanted this to be Richard’s effort, his muscle,his sweat. His doing.As the light gradually dimmed, Richard and Cara worked themselves ever deeperinto the ground. They had to resort to the pick to get through thick rootscrisscrossing the gravesite. Such good-sized roots told Nicci that the grave hadto be older than Richard believed. If he realized as much, he didn’t mention itas he worked. Nicci supposed that he could somehow be right that this was noreal grave, which would explain why the roots had grown as thick as they were.If Richard was right, only a small hole would have had to have been dug amongthem, just big enough for a ceremonial vessel containing ashes to have beenburied, but she didn’t for a moment believe it. Shovelful by shovelful, the pileof black dirt to the side of the hole grew ever larger.Although Zedd said nothing as he watched, Nicci could read in the deep lines ofhis face that, moment by moment, he was becoming ever more incensed at exhumingthe Mother Confessor, even if it would settle the matter. He looked like he hada thousand things to say, all bottled up inside him. Nicci thought that he wouldwait until after Richard found the buried truth, but by the grim set of thewizard’s jaw, she didn’t think that when he finally had his say that it wasgoing to be at all pleasant or understanding. This was behavior that crossed aline with him.When Richard’s and Cara’s heads, dripping sweat and rainwater, were even withthe surface of the ground, Richard’s shovel abruptly thunked against somethingthat sounded solid.He and Cara paused. Richard looked stunned and confused; according to his story,there ought not to be anything in the grave, except maybe a small containerholding ashes, and it was hard to believe that such a container would be buriedthis deep.“It has to be a container for the ashes,” he finally said as he looked up atZedd. “That has to be it. You wouldn’t have simply dumped ashes in the hole inground. At the funeral they would have used a receptacle of some kind for theashes you tricked them into thinking were Kahlan’s.”Zedd said nothing.Cara watched Richard for a moment and then plunged her shovel in the ground. Italso made a resounding thunk. With the back of her wrist she swiped a strand ofblond hair off her face as she looked up at Nicci.“Well it would appear you’ve found something.” Zedd’s ominous voice seemed tocarry through the low fog that had gathered along the ground in the privategraveyard. “I guess we ought to see what it is.”Richard stared up at his grandfather a moment, and then went back to digging. Itwasn’t long before he and Cara had exposed a flat surface. It was too dark tosee it clearly, but Nicci knew what it was.It was the truth about to be uncovered.It was the end of Richard’s delusion.“I don’t understand,” Richard murmured, confused by the size of what they wereuncovering.“Dig the top clear,” Zedd ordered with barely restrained displeasure.Richard and Cara worked to carefully but quickly clean the wet dirt away fromwhat was becoming all too clear was a coffin. When they had it fully exposed,Zedd ordered them out of the hole they’d dug.The old wizard held his hands over the open grave and turned his palms up. AsRichard, Cara, and Nicci watched, the heavy coffin began to rise. Dirt fell awayas the long object rose up out of the dark void. Stepping back away from theopen breach in the sacred ground, Zedd gently used his gift to set the coffin onthe grass beside the open grave.The exterior was elaborately carved with designs of enfolding fern frondsoverlaid with silver. It was reverently, sorrowfully beautiful. Richard couldonly stare in terror at what the coffin might contain.“Open it,” Zedd commanded.Richard looked up at him for a moment.“Open it,” Zedd repeated.Richard finally knelt close to the silver-clad coffin and used the tip of hisshovel to carefully pry the top loose. Cara retrieved the two lanterns, handingone to Zedd. She held the other lantern up over Richard’s shoulder to help himsee.When the it finally came loose, Richard lifted the heavy lid enough to slide thetop portion aside.The glow from Cara’s lamp fell across a decomposed corpse, now almost entirelyskeletal. The careful workmanship of the coffin appeared to have so far kept thebody dry on its long journey toward dust. The bones were mottled with stainsfrom long burial and the inescapable process of deterioration. A fall of longhair, most still attached to the skull, draped over the shoulders. Little tissuewas left, mostly connective tissue, especially that holding the bones of thefingers together. Even this long after death, those fingers still clutched along-ago-crumbled bouquet of flowers.The body of the Mother Confessor was wearing an exquisite, simply styled, satinywhite dress, cut square at the neckline, that now revealed bare ribs.The bouquet clutched in her hands had been enfolded in a wrapping of pearledlace with a broad golden ribbon attached to it. On the gold ribbon, in stitchedletters of silver thread, it said, “Beloved Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell. Shewill always be in our hearts.”There could hardly be any doubt anymore as to the true fate of the MotherConfessor, or to the reality that what Richard had so strongly believed was hismemories was nothing more than sweet delusions now turned to dust.Richard, his chest heaving, his breath catching, could only stare into the opencoffin at the skeletal remains, at the white dress, at the golden ribbon aroundthe black fragments of what had once been a beautiful bouquet of flowers.Nicci felt sick.“Are you satisfied now?” Zedd asked in a measured tone of smoldering anger.“I don’t understand,” Richard whispered, unable to take his eyes from theghastly sight.“You don’t? I think it seems pretty clear,” Zedd told him.“But I know she isn’t buried here. I can’t explain this. I don’t understand thecontradiction to what I know is true.”Zedd clasped his hand. “There is no contradiction to understand. Contradictionsdon’t exist.”“Yes, but I know—”“Wizard’s Ninth Rule: A contradiction cannot exist in reality. Not in part, norin whole. To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief in theexistence of the world around you and the nature of the things in it, to insteadembrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy—to imagine something is realsimply because you wish it were.“A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions.”“But Zedd, I have to believe—”“Ah, you believe. You mean that the reality of this coffin and the MotherConfessor’s long buried body has shown you something you did not expect anddon’t want to accept and so you wish to instead take refuge in the blind fog offaith. Is that what you mean to say?”“Well, in this case…”“Faith is a device of self-delusion, a sleight of hand done with words andemotions founded on any irrational notion that can be dreamed up. Faith is theattempt to coerce truth to surrender to whim. In simple terms, it is trying tobreathe life into a lie by trying to outshine reality with the beauty of wishes.Faith is the refuge of fools, the ignorant, and the deluded, not of thinking,rational men.“In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandonthe most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such abargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have atstake.”Richard ran his fingers back into his wet hair. “But Zedd, something is wronghere. I don’t know what, but I know it is. You have to help me.”“I just did. I’ve allowed you to show us the proof that you yourself named. Hereit is, in this coffin. I admit that it isn’t as desirable as what you wish weretrue, but the reality of it can’t be evaded. This is what you seek. This isKahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, just as it says on the gravestone.”Zedd arched an eyebrow as he leaned a little toward his grandson. “Unless youcan show that this is some kind of trickery, that someone for some reason buriedthis here as part of an elaborate hoax just to make it look like you’re wrongand everyone else is right. That would seem a pretty thin contention, if you askme. I am afraid that from the clear evidence right here this is the reality—theproof you sought—and there is no contradiction.”Richard stared down at the long dead body before him.“Something is wrong. This can’t be true. It just can’t be.”The muscles in Zedd’s jaw flexed. “Richard, I’ve allowed you this gruesomeindulgence when by all rights I shouldn’t have, now tell me why you don’t havethe sword. Where is the Sword of Truth?”Rain patted softly on the canopy of leaves above as Richard’s grandfatherwaited. Richard stared into the coffin.“I gave the sword to Shota in exchange for information I needed.”Zedd’s eyes went wide. “You did what!”“I had to,” Richard said without looking up at his grandfather.“You had to? You had to!”“Yes,” Richard answered in a meek voice.“In exchange for what information?”Richard put his elbows on the edge of the coffin as his face sank into hishands. “In exchange for what might help me find the truth of what’s going on. Ineed answers. I need to know how to find Kahlan.”In fury Zedd thrust his finger toward the coffin. “There is Kahlan Amnell! Rightwhere the gravestone has always said she is buried. And what oh-so-valuable bitof information did Shota give you after she tricked you out of the sword?”Richard made no effort to contend the characterization of being tricked out ofthe sword.“Chainfire,” he said. “She told me the word Chainfire, but she didn’t know whatit meant. She told me that I must find the place of the bones in the DeepNothing.”“The Deep Nothing,” Zedd mocked. He gazed up at the black sky as he took abreath. “I don’t suppose Shota was able to tell you what this Deep Nothing is.”Richard shook his head but didn’t look up. “She also said to beware the viperwith four heads.”Zedd let out another angry breath. “Don’t tell me, neither she nor you have anyidea what that means, either.”Again, Richard shook his head without looking up at his grandfather.“Is that it? That’s the great prize of valuable information you got in exchangefor the Sword of Truth?”Richard hesitated. “There was one other thing.” He spoke so softly that he couldhardly be heard over the gentle whisper of rain. “Shota said that what I seek…is long buried.”Zedd’s smoldering rage threatened to explode. “There,” he said, thrusting out afinger to point, “there is what you seek: Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor,long buried.”Richard, head down, said nothing.“For this you traded the Sword of Truth. A weapon of incalculable value. Aweapon that can bring down not only the wicked but the good as well. A weaponhanded down from the wizards of the ancient times, meant to be entrusted to onlya select few. A weapon I entrusted to you.“And you gave it to a witch woman.“Do you have any idea at all what I had to go through to recover the Sword ofTruth from Shota the last time she got her hands on it?”Richard shook his head as he stared at the ground beside the coffin, lookinglike he dared not test his voice.Nicci knew that Richard had a number of things to say in his own defense, had anumber of things having to do with his reasoning behind his beliefs and actions,but he said none of them even when offered the chance. As his grandfather ragedat him, he knelt in silence, hanging his head, beside the open coffin holdingthe end of his fantasy.“I trusted you with something of great value. I thought such a dangerous objectwas safe in your hands. Richard, you’ve let me down—you have let everyonedown—so that you could chase a dream. Well, here it is, bones long buried. Ihope you think the trade fair, but I certainly don’t.”Cara stood nearby, holding the lantern, her hair plastered to her head by theslow but steady rain. She looked like she wanted to defend Richard, but couldn’tthink of anything to say. Nicci, likewise, feared to say anything. She knew thatat that moment anything they said would only make matters worse. Only the softhiss of the rain against the leaves filled the otherwise silent, foggy night.“Zedd,” Richard said haltingly, “I’m sorry.”“Sorry won’t get it back from Shota’s clutches. Sorry won’t save those peoplewho Samuel will have beneath that sword. I love you like a son, Richard, and Ialways will, but I’ve never before been this disappointed in you. I would neverhave believed that you would do anything this unthinking and reckless.”Richard nodded, unwilling to justify his actions.Nicci’s heart was breaking for him.“I will leave you to bury the Mother Confessor while I go try to think of a wayto get the sword away from a witch woman who was a lot smarter than my grandson.You should realize that you may very well be responsible for what comes ofthis.”Richard nodded.“Good. I’m glad you can at least understand that much of it.” He turned to Caraand Nicci, the look in his eyes every bit as intimidating as the look of a Rahl.“I want you two to come back to the Keep with me. I want to know all about thisbeast business. Everything about it.”“I must stay and watch over Lord Rahl,” Cara said.“No,” Zedd told her, “you will come with me and tell me in detail everythingthat happened with the witch woman. I want to know every word out of Shota’smouth.”Cara looked torn. “Zedd, I can’t—”“Go with him, Cara,” Richard told her in quiet command. “Do as he asks. Please.”Nicci recognized how helpless Richard felt at defending his actions in thepresence of his grandfather, regardless of how certain he might have been thathe did what he thought was necessary. She understood because she had always beenjust as helpless in the presence of her mother when her mother told her, as sheoften did, that she had acted wrongly. Nicci had never been able to defendherself against what her mother thought she should have done. Her mother wasalways able to effortlessly make Nicci’s choices seem petty and selfish. Nomatter how old she was, she was still a child before those who raised her. Evenwhen she had been at the Palace of the Prophets for years, her mother couldstill make her feel ten years old and foolish.Because Richard loved and respected his grandfather, that actually made it allthat much more difficult for him than it had been for Nicci. Despite everythingRichard had accomplished, his strength, his knowledge, his ability, his mastery,he could not argue or reason his way out of the reality of having disappointedhis grandfather, and, because he loved and respected him, it hurt all the more.“Go on,” Nicci told Cara as she gently put her hand on the small of the woman’sback. “Do as he says for now. I think Richard could use some time alone to thinkthis through and get his bearings.”Cara, her gaze going back and forth between Nicci and Richard, looked like shethought this was something Nicci might be better able to handle and so noddedher agreement.“You, too,” Zedd told Nicci. “The Mother Confessor needs to be laid to rest; letRichard see to it. I need to know your part in this, every bit of it, so that Ican try to figure out how to reverse all the trouble born not just of this, butof what Jagang has done.”“All right,” Nicci said. “Get the horses and I’ll be right there.”Zedd cast a brief last look at Richard still huddled on his knees beside thecoffin before agreeing with a nod to Nicci.After he’d vanished with Cara through the junipers and into the fog, Niccicrouched down beside Richard and laid a hand on his back between his slumpedshoulders.“It will be all right, Richard.”“I wonder if anything will ever be all right again.”“It may not seem that way right now, but it will. Zedd will get over his angerof the moment and come to understand that you were doing your best to actresponsibly. I know that he loves you and that he didn’t intend what he said tohurt you so.”Richard nodded without looking up as he knelt in the mud beside the open coffinholding the corpse of the long dead Kahlan Amnell, the woman he had imagined hadbeen his love.“Nicci,” he finally asked so softly she could hardly hear him over the softsound of the gentle rain, “will you do something for me?”“Anything, Richard.”“One last time… be Death’s Mistress for me.”She rubbed his back and then stood, tears mixing with the rain on her face. Bysheer force of will, past the sob struggling to escape, she made her voicesteady.“I can’t Richard. You’ve taught me to embrace life.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49The heavy paneled door opened partway. Rikka stuck her head into the silentroom. “Someone is coming.”Nicci pushed her padded chair away from the polished library table. “Coming?”“Up toward the Keep.”“Do you know who?” she asked as she stood.Rikka shook her head. “Zedd just told me that the shields warned him thatsomeone was on their way up the road. He thought you ought to know. I tell you,all the magic flying around in this place makes my skin crawl.”“I’ll go find Richard.”Rikka nodded before vanishing out of the doorway. Nicci quickly returned thebook she had been studying to its slot in the vast expanse of mahogany shelvesthat filled the quiet library. The book was a tedious report on activities inthe Keep during the great war. Nicci found it rather strange, reading about allthe people who had once lived in the Wizard’s Keep thousands of years ago. Itseemed a disconnected history except when she intermittently reminded herselfthat they were talking about the very place where she was. She considered how,in contrast, the Palace of the Prophets had been so full of life and activityfor so long. Nicci couldn’t imagine the Palace of the Prophets empty of all buta few souls, and the Keep was vastly larger. Of course, now the palace was nomore while the Keep still stood.Nicci hadn’t really been interested in the book she’d been reading. It wasboring but she didn’t really care. It was merely something to occupy her time.She couldn’t force herself to concentrate on anything that would be absorbing orthat would require her to put any great effort into thinking. She was toodistracted.The new moon at the time they had dug up the grave of the Mother Confessor hadgrown to a full moon and was now approaching its last quarter again, and yetnothing much had changed. A few days after digging up the body, Zedd had toldRichard that he loved him and was sorry to have been so hard on him when maybehe should have found out a little more before saying the things he’d said. Zeddpromised that they would figure out a way to get Richard’s sword back andeverything would be all right.It might have been sincere, and it might have been true, but for Richard thehurt of such a personal failure was hard to put back into the bottle. He had notjust disappointed and angered his grandfather; he had failed to prove his dreamwas in fact the truth. He had put everything he had into the effort. He had beencertain and in the end he had only proved himself wrong.Richard had only nodded to Zedd’s words. Nicci didn’t think it mattered much tohim either way if Zedd had softened his viewpoint. He had reached the end of hisideas, his hopes, and his efforts. Nothing had helped him. After that night, thelife had gone out of him.Zedd had interrogated Cara and Nicci for hours that first night. Nicci had beenstunned to hear from Cara what Shota had said about the beast becoming a bloodbeast because Nicci had inadvertently given it the measure of Richard’sancestral blood. She was horrified to learn that she had been responsible forintensifying the danger to Richard.While astonished at how Nicci had accomplished saving Richard’s life, Zedd hadquietly assured her that had she not acted, Richard would most certainly havedied right then and there. He said that she had given Richard a chance at life,and now they could work to solve the problem of the beast Jagang’s Sisters hadcreated, as well as Richard’s strange delusions and the matter of recovering hissword. From what Shota had revealed about the beast, on top of what Niccialready knew, it didn’t look to Nicci that they had much of a chance of success.She had no idea at all of how to even begin to destroy such a beast spawned ofdark powers.She had also been embarrassed to hear Cara telling about how Shota had revealedto Richard Cara’s plan for Nicci to interest Richard romantically. Zedd,thankfully, had withheld any comments on that part of Cara’s story.That, among other things, had left Nicci feeling rather hopeless—and helpless.The Imperial Order was rampaging unchecked through the New World, the beast wasstalking Richard, and he was not himself, to say the least.In some ways, it reminded her of her dead attitude toward life, back beforeRichard. She had been taught that she had been born lucky in every way, andbecause she had ability it was her duty to devote herself to those in need. Nomatter how hard she worked, the needs always outpaced her ability to meet them,leaving her perpetually in debt to the ever worsening lives of others while herown life was not her own. Her feeling about what was happening now with thebeast and Richard’s delusions were different in almost every way, except theywere the same in that they gave her that familiar feeling of hollowhopelessness.Richard had spent the long days, since opening the grave and discovering thetruth, off by himself—with the exception that Cara, after answering all ofZedd’s tedious questions about everything she knew about what had happened withShota, refused to leave Richard’s side for any reason. Since Richard was in nomood to talk to anyone, Cara had become his silent shadow.It was strange seeing the two of them together, totally at ease with each othereven at such a time. It didn’t seem to Nicci like the two of them even needed tospeak, yet they managed, with a look, a slight shrug, or a nothing at all, toall the time understand each other.Nicci felt like an unwelcome outsider to his misery and so she let him be. Sheremained as close as she could, so that she would be at hand should the beastattack, but she stayed out of his sight and left him to his solitude.The first four or five days after arriving at the Keep Richard had spent in theConfessors’ Palace—wandering the magnificent rooms and vast network of halls.Nicci stayed in a guest room in the palace, out of sight, while Richard roamedaimlessly about the empty place. After that, he’d gone out and wandered the cityof Aydindril for a half-dozen days, walking the streets and alleys as ifreliving the life that had once been there. It was a lot more difficult forNicci to stay close to him when he walked all day long through the city. Afterthat he had spent yet more days wandering the forests of the mountains aroundAydindril, sometimes not even returning at night. Richard was at home in thewoods, so Nicci had decided not to follow him, knowing how difficult it wouldhave been for her to keep Richard from knowing she was there. She was comfortedsomewhat by her connection of magic with him that allowed her always to be awareof what direction he was and roughly how far way. When he didn’t come back atnight, though, Nicci paced, unable to sleep.Zedd finally asked Richard to please remain at the Keep so that in case thebeast were to attack, Zedd and Nicci could help stop it. Richard had done ashe’d been asked without comment or objection. He’d spent recent days, instead ofwandering the palace, or the city, or the woods, wandering the outer ramparts ofthe Keep, staring off into the distance.Nicci desperately wanted to do something to help him, but Zedd had insisted thatthere was nothing to do but wait and see if time would begin to bring him aroundto the reality that he had only dreamed up his relationship with Kahlan duringthe time he had been unconscious. In this, Nicci didn’t really think time wouldsolve anything. She’d been with Richard long enough to realize that this wassomething bigger. She believed that he needed some kind of help, but she didn’tknow what that help could possibly be.Nicci hurried down the wood-paneled hall outside the library, her feet swishingacross thick carpets. She rushed up through the maze of stairwells andpassageways, using her sense of her gifted connection with Richard to guide her,letting that thread of magic take her where it may, rather than trying todeliberately remember and find her way through the Keep.As she made her way ever closer to him, she reminisced about the kiss she hadgiven him to link them so that she could find him. She felt rather guilty aboutthat kiss, even if it had been achingly wonderful to do it. It had been far morethan she needed to do. She could have simply touched a finger to the back of hishand, or a shoulder, and established a link without him feeling a thing.But Cara had just been telling her how maybe she needed to make him more awareof her and filled her mind with heady thoughts of the possibilities. That kisswould certainly have planted her firmly in his thoughts. In a way, though, shefelt it was too forward, considering his mental state; he was in love withsomeone else, even if it was a dream, and Nicci hadn’t respected that. Sheregretted, in a way, giving him that kiss. In another way, she wished she hadplanted it on his lips instead of his cheek.As Shota had done.It burned her to hear Cara telling them how Shota had kissed him and tried toget him to stay with her. Nicci knew how the witch woman felt—but that didn’tmake her any happier about it.Nicci would give anything to be able to hold him, now, to comfort him, to tellhim that it would be all right for no other reason than simply to try to makehim feel just a little better, to reassure him that there were others around whocared about him.But she knew that this was not the time or circumstances for such things.At the same time, she knew that this could not continue. He simply could not goon like this. His life could not stay in this static state, drifting without hisconscious direction. He had to come to his senses.Nicci hurried onward, quickening her pace, down the endless maze of halls andthrough empty but grand rooms, suddenly feeling, for some reason, the urgentneed to be with him.Richard stood at the brink of the wall, an arm resting on a massive merlon toeach side, as he stared out through the crenellation. It felt like standing atthe edge of the world. Gray patches of shade drifted slowly over the hills andfields far below as their mothering clouds shepherded them along.He seemed to have lost all track of time. Every day had become the samemonotonous, pointless, empty existence. He didn’t even know how long he had beenstanding at the gap in the wall, staring out at nothing in particular.With Kahlan dead and gone, nothing mattered anymore. He had trouble imaginingwhy it ever had. He couldn’t even imagine for sure, now, that she had ever beenreal.But whether or not she had been, it was over.Cara was close. She was always close. In a way it was comforting, knowing thathe could depend on her for anything. In some ways, though, it was wearing tohave her always there, so that he was never able to have a moment’s privacy.He wondered if she believed she was close enough to snatch him if he jumped.He knew that she wasn’t.He gazed at the tiny little roofs crowded together in the city of Aydindril farbelow. In a way, he felt an affinity for the city. It was empty. He was empty.Life was gone from both of them.Since digging up the grave—he couldn’t bring himself to call it Kahlan’s grave,even in his own mind, much less out loud—he didn’t think there was anythingworth being alive for, anymore. If a person could die by sheer will alone, hewould already be dead, but death, when invited, had suddenly grown shy. The daysdragged endlessly on.He had been so stunned by that grave that it seemed his mind had been scrambledon the spot. It felt like he had lost his ability to think. Nothing he knew madesense to him. The things he’d thought were true somehow no longer were. Hiswhole world had been turned upside down. How could he function if he couldn’ttell what was real and what wasn’t?He didn’t know what else to do. For the first time in his life, he was baffledand defeated by the way things were. He always seemed to have a variety ofoptions that he knew he could try. Now, he didn’t. He had tried everything hecould think of. None of it worked. He was at the end of his rope, and there wasnone left.And all the time, in his mind, he kept seeing her body in the coffin.He saw, he heard, he felt, but he could not think, could not put anythingtogether in a meaningful way. It was a walking, living, imitation of death—apoor one, he believed. What good was living if it felt this way? He longed onlyfor that dark, forever embrace of nothingness to take him.He was so far beyond hurt, beyond sadness, beyond grief, that there was only anunthinking, empty, blind, confused agony that never for a second would releasehim enough to get a breath. He wanted desperately to escape the truth, to refuseto allow it to be real, but he couldn’t and it was suffocating him.The wind coming up the mountain ruffled his hair as he stared out over aprecipitous drop of thousands of feet.What good was he to anyone? He’d let Zedd down. He’d given Shota the Sword ofTruth for nothing of value. Nicci thought he was out of his mind, that he wasdelusional. Not even Cara believed him, really believed him. He was the only onewho believed him, and he had proved himself wrong by digging up her grave.He guessed he must be crazy, that Nicci had to be right. Everyone was right. Hecould only be imagining things. He could see it in all their eyes the way theylooked at him, that he had lost his mind.Richard gazed down the sheer drop of the dark stones of the massive outer Keepwall. They fell away below him for thousands of feet toward the rock and forestbelow. Gusts of wind coming up the face of the wall buffeted him. It was adizzying sight. A dizzying drop.What good was he to anyone, most of all to himself?He stole a sidelong glance at Cara. She was close, but not nearly close enough.Richard didn’t see any reason to continue the agony. He didn’t have his mind,and his mind was life.He didn’t have Kahlan. She was his life.From what everyone told him, from what he saw in the coffin that terrible night,he never had her. It was all just a mad delusion. A wish. A whim.He glanced down again at the forever drop off the towering wall on the side ofthe keep, at the rocks and trees spread out below. It was a very, very long waydown.He recalled people saying that just before you died you relived your life.If he were to relive his life, he would relive every precious moment he’d hadwith Kahlan.Or thought he’d had.It was a long way down.A long time to relive such wonderful, romantic, loving times. A long time torelive every precious moment he’d spent with her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50Nicci opened an iron-strapped oak door to bright daylight. Puffy white cloudsskimmed by just overhead in a sparkling azure sky that on any other day wouldhave lifted her spirits. A fresh breeze carried her hair across her face. Shepulled it away as she gazed down the narrow bridge to a rampart in the distance.Richard stood beyond the end of the bridge, at the far wall of the rampart, inthe gap of the crenellation, looking down the mountain. Cara, nearby, turnedwhen she heard the door.Nicci hurried across the bridge above courtyards far below. She could seeseveral stone benches down among the rose garden at the bottom of a tower andjuncture of several walls. When she finally reached Richard’s side he glancedover, giving her a brief, small smile. It warmed her to see it even though sheknew the smile was little more than a polite formality.“Rikka came and told me that someone approaches the Keep. I thought I shouldcome and get you.”Cara, standing only three strides away, stepped a little closer. “Does Rikkaknow who it is?”Nicci shook her head. “I’m afraid not, and I’m more than a little worried.”Without moving or taking his eyes from the distant countryside, Richard said“It’s Ann and Nathan.”Nicci’s eyebrows lifted in surprise. She looked over the edge. Richard pointedthem out far below on the road that wound its way up the mountain toward theKeep.“There are three riders,” Nicci said.Richard nodded. “It looks like it might be Tom with them.”Nicci leaned out a little farther past Richard and peered down the face of thestone wall. It was a frightening drop. The feeling came over her that she didn’tat all like where he was standing.With a hand on his shoulder to steady herself, Nicci looked out again at thethree horses plodding their way up the sunlit road. They briefly disappearedunder trees only to emerge a moment later as they continued steadily up towardthe Keep.A gust of wind suddenly threatened to unbalance her from her footing in the slotin the immense stone wall. Before it could, Richard’s arm around her waiststeadied her. She instinctively drew back from the edge. Once she was on safefooting, his protective arm released her.“You can tell for sure, from here, that it’s Ann and Nathan?” she asked.“Yes.”Nicci wasn’t especially enthusiastic about seeing the Prelate again. As a Sisterof the Light and having lived at the Palace of the Prophets for most of herlife, Nicci had had just about all she wanted of the Sisters and their leader.In many ways the Prelate was a mother figure to her, as she had been to all theSisters, someone who was there to remind them whenever they were adisappointment and lecture them that they had to redouble their efforts to helpothers in need.When she had been young, should self-interest ever rear its ugly head, Nicci’smother had always been at the ready to bitterly slap it down. Later in Nicci’slife the Prelate served in that same capacity, if with a kindly smile. Slap orsmile, it was the same thing: servitude, even if under a nicer name.Nathan Rahl was another matter. She didn’t really know the prophet. There wereSisters, and novices especially, who trembled at the mere mention of his name.From what everyone always said, though, he was not simply dangerous but possiblyderanged, which, if true, had disturbing implications for Richard’s presentcondition.The prophet had been held in secure quarters almost his entire life, the Sistersseeing not only to his needs but seeing to it that he never escaped. People inthe city of Tanimura, where the palace had been, were both titillated andterrified of the prophet, of what he might tell them of the future. Whisperswere, among the people of the city, that he was most surely wicked, since hecould tell them things about their future. Ability tended to arouse the ire of agreat many people, especially when that ability was not one that could easily bemade to serve their wants.Nicci wasn’t much worried about what people said about Nathan, though. She’d hadexperience with truly dangerous people—with Jagang only the most recent to gracethe top of her list of the wicked.“We’d better get down there,” Nicci told Richard and Cara.Richard stared out over the countryside. “You go on, if you want.”He sounded like he couldn’t have cared less that someone was coming, or who itwas. It was obvious that his mind was elsewhere and he only wanted her to goaway.Nicci pulled a flag of hair back off her face. “Don’t you think you ought to seewhat they want? After all, they must have traveled a long way to get here. I’msure they didn’t come bringing milk and cakes.”Richard shrugged one shoulder, showing no reaction to her attempt at humor.“Zedd can see to it.”Nicci so missed the light in Richard’s eyes. She was at the end of her enduranceof the situation.She glanced over at the Mord-Sith and spoke in quiet but unmistakable command.“Cara, why don’t you go for a little walk? Please?”Cara, surprised by such an unusual but clear directive coming from Nicci, tookin Richard standing at the opening in the wall, staring off into the distance,and then gave Nicci a conspiratorial nod. Nicci watched Cara walk off down therampart before finally addressing Richard again, but this time in a boldlyforthright manner.“Richard, you have to stop this.”As he gazed out at the vast scene below, he didn’t answer.Nicci knew that she couldn’t allow herself to fail in what she had to say, whatshe had to accomplish. She would do almost anything to have Richard care abouthaving her in his life, but she didn’t want to win him this way. She didn’t wantto be second best to a corpse, or a substitute to a dream he couldn’t make real.If she was ever to have him, she would only have him because he chose her, notbecause he was left with nothing else. There had been a time when she would haveaccepted on those grounds, but no more. She respected herself more than that,now, and all because of Richard.But even more than that, this was not the Richard she knew and loved. Even ifshe could never have him, she still wouldn’t allow him to sink to the terriblydark place he was in. If she could give him a needed push back up toward life,and that was all she could ever do for him, then she would.Even if she had to play the role of antagonist to get him out of his downwardspiral, and she could be no more than that to him, then she would.She laid a hand on the stone merlon, making herself impossible to avoid, andtook an even more confrontational tone.“Aren’t you going to fight for what you believe in?”“They can fight if they want.” His voice didn’t sound despondent; it soundeddead.“That’s not what I mean.” Nicci grasped his arm and gently but firmly pulled himaround, turning him from the drop-off, forcing him to face her. “Aren’t yougoing to fight for yourself?”He met her gaze but didn’t answer.“This is because Zedd told you that he was disappointed in you.”“I think the grave I dug up might have had a bit to do with it.”“You may think so but I don’t. Why should it? You have been devastated and sentreeling by things before. I captured you and took you away to the Old World, andwhat did you do? You stood up for yourself and acted like yourself and on yourbeliefs, within the limits of what I would allow you to do. By being who you areyou exerted your love of life and that changed my life. You showed me the truthof the joy of life and all it means.“This time you woke up from nearly dying to me and Cara and everyone else notbelieving in your memory of Kahlan, but that never stopped you. You kept arguingyour convictions despite everything we said.”“What was in that coffin is different, and I’d say a little more than a simpleargument when someone doesn’t believe you.”“Is it? I don’t think so. It was a skeleton. So what?”“So what?” Annoyance crept into his features. “Are you out of your mind? What doyou mean, so what?”“Far be it from me to argue your case when I don’t believe in it, but I don’tseek to win you to what I believe is the truth by default. I would want to winyou over with the true facts, not with this flimsy evidence.”“What do you mean?”“Well, was it Kahlan’s face you saw to prove to you that it really was her? No,it couldn’t be—there was no face left. Just a skull—no face, no eyes, nofeatures. The skeleton was wearing the dress of the Mother Confessor. So what? Iwas in the Confessors’ Palace and there were other dresses there like that.“So was a name stitched on a gold ribbon enough to prove it to you? Enough tobring you to an end of your search, your beliefs? After all the things that Caraand I have said to you, have argued to you, have reasoned to you, you all of asudden feel that this flimsy evidence proves you delusional? A skeleton in acoffin holding a ribbon with her name stitched on it is enough to suddenlyconvince you that you dreamed her up, just as we’ve been telling you all alongand you’ve refused to believe? Don’t you think that the ribbon is just a littletoo convenient?”Richard frowned at her. “What are you getting at?”“I don’t believe that’s what is really going on with you. I think you’re wrongabout your memories but I don’t believe that the Richard I know could beconvinced by the dubious evidence in that grave. This isn’t even because Zedddoesn’t believe your memories any more than Cara and I do.”“Then what’s it about?”“This is all because you believed a corpse in a coffin was her because you wereafraid it was true after your grandfather said that he was disappointed in youand that you let him down.”Richard started to turn away, but Nicci seized his shirt and pulled him back,forcing him to face her.“That’s what I think this is about,” she said with fierce resolve. “You’resulking because your grandfather said you were wrong, said that you disappointedhim.”“Maybe because I did.”“So what?”Richard’s face screwed up in confusion. “What do you mean, ‘so what’?”“I mean, so what if he’s disappointed in you. So what if he thinks you did astupid thing. You’re your own man. You did what you reasoned you had to do. Youacted because you thought you had to act and do the things you did.”“But I…”“You what? You disappointed him? You made him angry at what you decided to do?He thought more of you and you let him down? You came up short in his eyes?”Richard swallowed, not wanting to admit it aloud.Nicci lifted his chin and made him look into her eyes.“Richard, you have no responsibility to live up to anyone else’s expectations.”He blinked at her, looking speechless.“It’s your life,” she insisted. “You’re the one who taught me that. You did whatyou thought you must. Did you turn down Shota’s offer because Cara disagreedwith you? No. Would you have turned down Shota’s offer if you knew I thought youwere wrong to give her your sword? Or would you have turned her down if both ofus told you that you’d be a fool to accept? No, I don’t think so.“And why not? Because you were doing what you thought you must do and as much asyou would hope we would agree with you, in the end it didn’t matter what wethought. Your conviction was what you had to act upon. You didn’t quail at thedecision, you acted. You did what you felt you had to do. You were making thedecision based on what you believed, for reasons only you can truly know, andthat it was the right thing to do. Isn’t that correct?”“Well… yes.”“Then what difference should it make if your grandfather thinks you’re wrong.Was he there? Does he know everything you knew at the time? It would be nice ifhe believed in what you did, if he supported you and said ‘good for you,Richard,’ but he didn’t. Does that suddenly make your decision wrong? Does it?”“No.”“Then you can’t let it take over your mind. Sometimes the people who love us themost have the highest expectations for us, and sometimes those expectations areidealized. You did what you had to do, given what you believed and what youknow, to find the answers you needed to solve the problem. If everyone else inthe world thinks you’re wrong, but you believe you’re right, you have to act onwhat you have sound reason to believe. Numbers of those against you don’t changethe facts and you must act to find the facts, not satisfy the crowd or anyparticular individual.“You have no responsibility to live up to anyone else’s expectations. You haveonly to live up to your own expectations.”Some of the light, the fire was back in his intent gray eyes. “Does this meanthat you believe me, Nicci?”She sadly shook her head. “No, Richard. I think your belief in Kahlan is aresult of your injury. I think you dreamed her up.”“And the grave?”“The truth?” When he nodded, Nicci took a deep breath. “I think that is the realMother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell.”“I see.”Nicci seized his jaw again and made him look back at her. “But that doesn’t meanthat I’m right. I’m basing my belief on other things—things I know. But I don’tthink that anything I saw in that coffin, as much as I believe it’s her, reallyproves it. I’ve been wrong in my life before. You’ve thought I’m wrong all alongin this. Are you going to do as someone says who you think is wrong? Why wouldyou do that?”“But it’s so hard when no one believes me.”“Sure it is, but so what? That doesn’t make them right and you wrong.”“But when everyone says you’re wrong it starts to make you have doubts.”“Yes, sometimes life is really hard. In the past doubts have always made you digall the harder for the truth, to be sure you were right because knowing thetruth can give you the strength to fight on. This time, your shock at seeing abody in the Mother Confessor’s grave when you hadn’t anticipated even thepossibility of one being there, coupled with your grandfather’s unexpectedlyharsh comments right in that moment of horror, overwhelmed you.“I can understand how it was the last straw and you couldn’t fight it anymore.Everyone can sometimes reach the limits of their endurance and give up—even you,Richard Rahl. You are mortal and you have your limits just like everyone elsedoes. But you have to deal with that and move on. You’ve had time to temporarilygive up, but now you have to take control of your own life again.”She could see him thinking, considering. It was a thrilling sight to seeRichard’s mind back and working. She could still see, though, his hesitation.She didn’t want him to come this far and slip back now.“People must have not believed you before, in other things,” she said. “Weren’tthere ever times when this Kahlan of yours didn’t believe you? A real personwould have sometimes disagreed with you, doubted you, argued with you. And whenthat happened, you must have done as you thought you had to, even though shethought you were wrong, maybe even a little crazy. I mean, come on, Richard,this isn’t the first time I’ve thought you were crazy.”Richard smiled briefly before thinking it over. Then, a broad grin spread on hisface.“Yes, there certainly were times like that with Kahlan, when she didn’t believeme.”“And you still did as you believed you had to, didn’t you?”Richard, still smiling, nodded.“Then don’t let this incident with your grandfather ruin your life.”He lifted an arm and let it flop back down. “But it’s just that—”“You gave up because of what Zedd told you without even using what you got fromShota.”He looked up sharply, his attention suddenly riveted on her. “What do you mean?”“In exchange for the Sword of Truth, Shota gave you information to help you findthe truth. One of the things she told you was ‘What you seek is long buried.’“But that’s not all. Cara told Zedd and me everything Shota said. Apparently themost vital thing she gave you, because it was the first and almost all shethought she had to tell you, was the word Chainfire. Right?”Richard nodded as he listened.“She then told you that you must find the place of the bones in the DeepNothing. Shota also told you to beware the viper with four heads.“What is Chainfire? What is the Deep Nothing? What is the viper with four heads?You paid a dear price for that information, Richard. What have you done with it?You came here and asked Zedd if he knew and he said no, then he told you that hewas disappointed in you.“So what? Are you going to throw away everything you’ve gained in your searchjust because of that? Because an old man who has no idea what Kahlan means toyou or what you’ve been through the last couple of years thinks that you actedfoolishly? Do you want to move in here and be his lapdog? Do you want to stopthinking and just depend on him to do your thinking for you?”“Of course not.”“At the grave Zedd was angry. He went through things we probably can’t imagineto get the Sword of Truth away from Shota. What would you expect him to say?‘Oh, yes, that’s a good idea, Richard, just give it back to her; that’s fine.’He had a lot invested in getting that sword back from her and he thought youmade a foolish trade. So what? That’s his view. Maybe he’s even right.“But you thought it was important enough to sacrifice something he had entrustedto you alone, something very precious to you, in order to gain a higher value.You believed that it was a fair trade. Cara said that at first you even thoughtShota might be cheating you, but then you came to believe that she had given youfair value. Did Cara tell it true?”Richard nodded.“What did Shota tell you about your bargain?”Richard gazed up at the soaring towers behind Nicci as he recalled the words.“Shota said, ‘You wanted what I know that can help you find the truth. I havegiven it to you: Chainfire. Whether or not you realize it right now, I havegiven you a fair trade. I have given you the answers you needed. You are theSeeker—or at least, you were. You will have to seek the meaning to be found inthose answers.’ ““And do you believe her?”Richard considered a moment, his gazed dropping away. “I do.” When he lookedback up into her eyes, the spark of life was again blazing there. “I do believeher.”“Then you should tell me and Cara and your grandfather that if none of us aregoing to help you, then we ought to get out of your way and let you do as youmust.”He smiled, if somewhat sadly. “You’re a pretty remarkable woman, Nicci, toconvince me to keep fighting even when you don’t believe in what I’m fightingfor.” He leaned in and kissed her on the cheek.“I truly wish I could, Richard… for your sake.”“I know. Thank you, my friend—and I say friend because only a true friend wouldbe more concerned with helping me face reality than what it means for her.” Hereached out and, with his hand cupped to her face, used a thumb to wipe a tearfrom her cheek. “You have done more for me than you know, Nicci. Thank you.”Nicci felt giddy joy mixed with sinking frustration that they were right back towhere they had started.Still, she wanted to throw her arms around him, but instead she simply cuppedboth her hands over his on the side of her face.“Now,” he said, “I think we had better go see about Ann and Nathan, and then Ineed to find out what part Chainfire plays in all this. Will you help me?”Nicci smiled as she nodded, too choked up to speak, and then, unable to stopherself, at last threw her arms around him and clutched him tightly to her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 51The look on Ann’s face as she stepped in the big door and saw Nicci entering theanteroom from between two red pillars was priceless. Nicci would have laughedaloud had her talk with Richard not so emotionally drained her.The prophet, Nicci knew, was very old, but he was by no means feeble looking. Hewas tall and broad-shouldered, with distinguished white hair that hung to hisshoulders. He looked like a man who could bend iron, and he wouldn’t even needhis gift to do so. It was the raptor gaze of his dark azure eyes, though, thatmade him at once intimidating and alluring. They were the eyes of a Rahl.Ann stared, her own eyes wide. “Sister Nicci…”The Prelate didn’t say “So good to see you again,” or anything cordial. Sheseemed momentarily unable to think of what to say. Nicci found it just a littleremarkable that this squat woman beside the towering prophet had for so longseemed so big in her eyes. Novices and Sisters often went for long periodswithout even seeing the Prelate around the Palace of the Prophets. Absence,Nicci guessed, added to her mythic stature.“Prelate. I’m glad to see you well, especially after your unfortunate death andfuneral.” Nicci glanced over at Richard as she finished the thought. “I hearthat everyone believed you were dead. Amazing how a burial can be so convincing,and yet here you are, alive and well, it would appear.”Richard’s twitch of a smile told her that he caught her meaning. Zedd, to theside, at the brink of the three steps leading down into the center of the roomwith the fountain, gave Nicci a curious frown. The meaning hadn’t been lost onhim, either.“Yes, well, that was unfortunately necessary, child.” Ann’s expression darkened.“What with the Sisters of the Dark having infested the ranks of our Sisters ofthe Light.” She glanced briefly at Richard, Cara, and Zedd, the edge to hercountenance softening. “It appears by the company you keep, Sister Nicci, thatyou have come back into the fold. I can’t tell you how much it pleases me,personally. I can only think that the Creator Himself must have had a hand insaving your soul.”Nicci clasped her hands behind her back. “The Creator had nothing to do with it,actually. I guess that while I was forced to spend my life serving everyone whodecided they wanted the blood and sweat of my abilities, the Creator was busy. Iguess he couldn’t be bothered while I was being used by pious men telling me howit was my duty to serve and to submit and to grovel to them and to kill thosewho opposed the Creator’s ways.“I guess that all the times those champions of the Creator were raping me, theCreator didn’t catch on to the irony.“No more. Richard helped show me the value of my life to myself. And it is nolonger ‘Sister’ Nicci—either of the Light or the Dark. Nor is it Death’sMistress, or the Slave Queen. It is just Nicci, now, if you please… and even ifyou don’t.”Ann’s expression flashed between incredulity and indignation as her face wentred. “But once you are a Sister you are always a Sister. You have done awonderful thing and renounced the Keeper, so you are again a Sister of theLight. You can’t simply decide on your own to forsake your duty to theCreator’s—”“If He has any objections, then let Him speak up right now!” As the echo ofNicci’s heated words faded away, the room fell silent but for the splash ofwater in the fountain. She made a show of looking around, as if she thought thatmaybe the Creator might be hiding behind a pillar ready to pop out and make Hiswishes known.“No?” She again clasped her hands. She put back on the defiant smile. “Wellthen, since He has no objections, Nicci it is, I guess.”“I’ll not have—”“Ann, enough,” Nathan said in a deep, commanding voice. “We have importantbusiness and this isn’t it. We didn’t travel all this way simply for a deadprelate to lecture a reformed Sister of the Dark.”Nicci was somewhat surprised to hear the voice of reason coming from theprophet. She allowed that perhaps she had put too much stock into idle gossip.Ann’s mouth twisted in resignation as she fingered a stray lock of hair into theloose bun at the back of her head. “I suppose you’re right. I’m afraid that I’ma little out of sorts, my dear, what with all the trouble going on. Pleaseforgive my rash presumption, will you, Nicci?”Nicci bowed her head. “Happily, Prelate.”Ann smiled, more genuinely, Nicci thought. “And it’s just Ann, now. Verna isPrelate, now. I’m dead, remember?”Nicci smiled. “So you are, Ann. Wise choice, Verna. Sister Cecilia always saidthat there was no hope of converting that one to the Keeper.”“Someday when we have the luxury of time, I would appreciate hearing more aboutSister Cecilia in addition to Richard’s former teachers.” She sighed at thethought. “I never knew for sure that you and all five of the others were Sistersof the Dark.”Nicci nodded. “I’d be happy to tell you what I know about them—the ones stillalive, anyway. Liliana and Merissa are dead.”“Tom, how is my sister?” Richard asked as soon as there was a brief break in theconversation. Nicci recognized that he had listened long enough and wassignaling that he wanted to move on to more important matters.“She is well, Lord Rahl,” the big blond-headed man near the door said.“Good. Nathan, what’s going on?” Richard anxiously asked, getting right to thepoint. “What trouble are you here about?”“Well… among other things, prophecy trouble.”Richard visibly relaxed. “Oh. Well, that’s not something I can help you with.”“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Nathan said, cryptically.Zedd stepped off the gold and red carpet and down into the room. “Let me guess.You’re here about the blank places in the books of prophecy.”Nicci had to run Zedd’s words through her mind a second time before she was sureshe’d heard him right.Nathan nodded. “You’ve just sat down in the middle of the muck.”“What do you mean you’re here about blank places in the books of prophecy?”Richard looked suddenly suspicious. “What blank places?”“Extensive sections of prophecy—that is, prophecy written down in the books ofprophecy—have simply vanished off the pages of a number of the books we’ve sofar inspected.” Nathan’s brow bunched in an expression of apprehension. “We’vechecked with Verna and she confirmed that the books of prophecy at the People’sPalace in D’Hara are suffering the same inexplicable problem. Therein lies theheart of our worry. We came, in part, to see if the works of prophecy here atthe Keep are still intact.”“I’m afraid not,” Zedd said. “The books here have been similarly corrupted.”Nathan swiped a hand across his tired face. “Dear spirits,” he murmured. “We hadbeen holding out hope that whatever is causing such havoc among the prophecieshad not affected the books here as well.”“You mean that entire sections of prophecy are missing?” Richard asked, steppingdown into the heart of the room.“That’s right,” Nathan confirmed.“Would there happen to be a pattern to the missing prophecy?” Richard asked,suddenly focusing on a line of reasoning that Nicci knew would end up beingsomehow related to his own search. Ordinarily she would have been frustrated oreven annoyed that he could think of nothing else but his fixation with themissing woman, but this time she was heartened to see that the familiar Richardwas back.“Why yes, there is a pattern. They are all prophecies having to do with eventsbeginning roughly around the time of your birth.”Richard stared, dumbfounded. “What are the missing propheciesabout—specifically? I mean, are they related to specific events, or are theynonspecific and instead share only a time period?”Nathan stroked his chin as he considered the question. “That’s the thing thatmakes this so strange. Many of the prophecies that are missing we know we shouldbe able to recall, but they are suddenly and completely just as blank in ourminds as they are on the page. We can’t remember a single word of them. We don’trecall what they were about, and since they’re gone from the books as well Ican’t tell you if they were event related or time related—or something else. Werealize that they are missing, but that’s about all.”Richard’s eyes turned to Nicci, as if to ask if she caught the correlation. Shethought he could see that she did. His voice remained casual, but Nicci knew howintent was the interest behind his words.“Pretty odd that something you’ve known all your lives can just vanish right outof your memory, wouldn’t you say?”“I certainly would,” Nathan said. “Any thoughts on the subject, Zedd?”Zedd, who had been silently and intently watching Richard, nodded. “Well, I knowwhat’s causing it, if that will help you out.”He smiled innocently. Nicci noticed that Rikka, standing in the shadows backbehind the red pillars, smiled as well. Nathan, at first stunned, becameanimated with curiosity.Richard gently tugged Zedd’s robes at his shoulder. “You know?”“You do?” Nathan asked, urging Richard back out of the way as he stepped closer.Ann rushed forward with him. “What is it? What’s happening? Tell us.”“A prophecy worm, I’m afraid.”Nathan and Ann blinked, their faces blank of any comprehension.“A what?” Nathan finally ventured, somewhat cautiously, if not suspiciously.“The text vanishing is caused by a prophecy worm. Once a fork of prophecy isinfected with this scourge, it worms its way entirely through that branch,consuming it as it goes. Since it consumes the actual prophecy itself, thatmeans that over time all manifestations of it, such as the written prophecy orany memory of it, are destroyed. It’s quite virulent.” Zedd regarded their raptstares with another polite smile. “If you want, I can show you the referencework.”“I should say so,” Nathan said.“Zedd this is important,” Richard said. “Why haven’t you said something?”Zedd gave him a familiar clap on the shoulder as he started away. “Well, my boy,when you arrived you weren’t much in the mood to listen to anything but what youwere here about. Remember? You were rather insistent that you had trouble andyou needed to talk to me about it. Since then you haven’t exactly been willingto talk. You’ve been rather… distracted.”“I guess I was.” Richard caught his grandfather’s arm, halting him before hecould get far. “Zedd, look, I need to tell you something about all of that, andabout that night.”“Like what, my boy?”“I know that a contradiction cannot exist.”“I never really thought you did, Richard.”“But there was more to it that night. The rule most involved down there at thegrave site was not the one you quoted. It may have seemed that way to you at themoment, but the rule I made a mistake about was another—the one that says inpart that people can be made to believe a lie because they fear that it’s true.That’s what I was doing. I wasn’t believing a contradiction, I was believing alie because I was so afraid it was true. The rule of noncontradiction is one ofthe ways I should have checked my assumptions. I didn’t, and in that I made amistake.“I understand what it must have looked like to you since you weren’t aware ofeverything that’s been happening, but that doesn’t mean I should have stoppedlooking for the truth out of a misplaced wish to make you happy, or out of fearof what you would think of me.”He met Nicci’s gaze for a brief moment. “Nicci helped me see what I was doingwrong.”He looked back at his grandfather. “I think you meant to show me that the ruleyou quoted is more, though. It also means you can’t hold contradictory values orgoals. You can’t say, for instance, that honesty is a meaningful value, and atthe same time lie to people. You can’t say that justice is your goal but refuseto hold the guilty responsible for their actions.“At the heart of our struggle, the fact that contradictions can’t exist is whythe Imperial Order’s regime is so ruinous. They hold up altruism as theirhighest purpose. Yet, out of their proclaimed selfless concern for oneindividual, they sacrifice another, soothing over the bloodletting byproclaiming that such a sacrifice is the moral duty of the sacrificial victim.It’s really nothing more than organized looting, a passion for the happiness ofthieves and murderers without any concern for their victim. Attempts at goalsthat depend on such contradiction can only lead to widespread suffering anddeath. It’s the fraudulent advocacy of the right to life by embracing death as ameans to achieve it.“The rule you quoted means I can’t, like Jagang’s followers, say I want thetruth and then, without checking my assumption, willingly believe a lie in itsstead, even if out of fear. That’s the way I violated the rule you quoted. Ishould have sorted out what looked like contradictions and found the truthstaring me in the face. That’s where I let myself down.”“Are you saying that you now don’t believe that was Kahlan Amnell?” Zedd asked.“Who says that corpse has to be the woman you think it is? There were no factsthere to contradict my belief that it wasn’t her. I only believed there were outof fear that it was true. It wasn’t.”Zedd took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “You’re stretching things mightythin, Richard.”“Am I? You wouldn’t be too pleased with my rationale if I said that there is nosuch thing as prophecy and held up the blank books as proof that your belief inthe existence of prophecy is wrong. For you to believe that prophecy exists inthe face of the fact that the supposed books of prophecy are blank is not acontradiction. It is a perplexing situation with insufficient information to asof yet explain the facts. You have no obligation to reach a conclusion or holdan opinion you don’t accept for other reasons without adequate information orbefore you have finished investigating.“What kind of Seeker would I be if I did that? After all, it’s the mind of theman that makes him the Seeker, not the sword. The sword is merely a tool—you’rethe one who told me that.“In the case of Kahlan, there are still too many unanswered questions for me tobe convinced that what we saw that rainy night is really the truth. Until it’sproved one way or another, I’m going to continue to look for the answers—for thetruth—because I believe that what is going on is far more dangerous than anyonebut me realizes, to say nothing of needing to find a person I love who needs myhelp.”Zedd smiled in a grandfatherly way. “Fair enough, Richard, fair enough. But Iexpect you to prove it to me. I won’t take your word for it.”Richard gave his grandfather a firm nod. “For starters, I think you have toadmit it’s rather suspicious that prophecies revolving around Kahlan’s and mylives are missing. The memory of her is gone. Now the prophecies are gone thatwould have to contain reference to her. In both cases everyone’s memory of bothreal entities—the person and the prophecies referring to that real person—havebeen wiped away.“Do you see what I’m getting at?”Nicci was immeasurably relieved to see that Richard was thinking rationallyagain. She was also concerned that in a strange way, what he said actually didmake some sense.“Yes, my boy, I do see your point, but do you see that there is a problem withyour theory?”“What’s that?”“We all remember you, now don’t we? And the prophecies about you are missing. Asit turns out, in this case the problem with prophecy doesn’t have anything atall to do with what you are hoping will explain or prove the existence of KahlanAmnell.”“Why not?” Richard asked.Zedd started up the steps. “It has to do with the nature of what I found outwhen I did my own investigation of the problem with the books of prophecy. I’mnot without my own sense of curiosity, you know.”“I know that, Zedd. But it could be connected,” Richard insisted as he walkedalong beside his grandfather.Nicci hurried after him. Everyone else was forced to fall in behind.“It might seem that way to you, my boy, but your speculation is flawed becauseall the facts just don’t fit your conclusion. You’re trying to wear boots thatlook good but are too small.” Zedd clapped Richard on the shoulder. “When we getto the library I’ll show you what I mean.”“Who’s Kahlan?” Nathan asked.“Someone who vanished and I haven’t found yet,” Richard said over his shoulder.“But I will.”Richard paused and turned back to Ann and Nathan. “Do either of you know whatChainfire is?” They both shook their heads. “How about a viper with four heads,or the Deep Nothing?”“I’m afraid not, Richard,” Ann said. “But as long as we’re on the subject ofimportant matters, we do have other things we need to speak with you about.”“After we see Zedd’s reference about prophecy,” Nathan said.“Well, come on, then,” Zedd told them as he started off with a flourish of hissimple robes."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 52In the plush library, Richard stood behind Zedd, watching over his grandfather’sbony shoulder as he flipped open a thick book bound in tattered, tan leather.The room was rather dimly lit by a number of silver reflector lamps on all foursides of five thick mahogany posts standing in a line down the center of theroom. They held up the leading edge of a balcony running the length of the room.Heavy, dark wooden tables with polished tops lined the center of the room downthe line of posts. Wooden chairs were spaced around the outside of the tables.Opulent carpets with elaborately woven patterns felt soft and quiet underfoot.Perpendicular to the long walls on each side were aisles of shelves packed withbooks. Above, the balcony held closely spaced shelves filled with yet morevolumes.A gray-blue shaft of sunlight slanting in from the single window up high at thevery end of the room lit the dust floating in the stuffy air. The freshly litlamps added an oily smell. The room had a vaultlike quiet about it.Cara and Rikka stood off by themselves in the darker area beneath the window atthe end of the room, arms folded, heads together, talking in low voices. Niccistood beside Zedd along one edge of a table lit in a glowing rectangle ofsunlight while Ann and Nathan stood impatiently on the opposite side, waitingfor Zedd’s explanation of how prophecy had vanished. Standing there, in theisland of light, the rest of the room faded away into gloomy shadows aroundthem.“This book was compiled, I believe, sometime not long after the great war hadended,” Zedd told them as he tapped the open cover near the title: ContinuumRatios and Viability Predictions. “The gifted back then had discovered that, forwhatever reason, fewer and fewer wizards were being born and the ones who werebeing born were not being born with both sides of the gift, as had almost alwaysbeen the case before. What’s more, the ones who were being born with the giftwere all being born with only the Additive side. Subtractive Magic wasvanishing.”Ann looked up from under her brow. “It is hardly a novice and a boy wizardstanding before you, old man. We know all this. We have spent our lives devotedto this very problem. Get on with it.”Zedd cleared his throat. “Yes, well, as you may know, this also meant that therewere fewer and fewer prophets being born.”“How remarkably fascinating,” Ann mocked. “I, for one, would never have guessedsuch a thing.”Nathan irritably hushed her. “Go on, Zedd.”Zedd pushed back his sleeves, briefly casting a scowl Ann’s way. “They realizedthat, with ever fewer wizards born to prophecy, the body of work of prophecy wasof course going to cease to grow. In order to understand what the consequencesof this might mean, they decided that they needed to do an intensiveinvestigation of the entire subject of prophecy while they still could, whilethey still had prophets and other wizards with both sides of the gift.“They approached the problem with the gravest of concern, realizing that withthem, this might very well be mankind’s last opportunity to comprehend thefuture of prophecy itself, and to offer future generations an insight tounderstanding what these wizards were increasingly coming to believe would oneday be seriously corrupted or even lost.”Zedd glanced up to see if Ann looked like she intended to offer anymoredisparaging comments. She did not. This was apparently something she hadn’tknown.“Now,” he said, “to their work.”Richard moved up to the table beside Nicci and with a finger turned over pagesas he listened to Zedd. He quickly noticed that the book was written in suchstrange technical jargon having to do with the intricacies of not only magic butprophecy as well that it was nearly incomprehensible to him. It might as wellhave been a different language.One of the surprises was that the book contained a series of complexmathematical formulas. These were interrupted by diagrams of the moon and starsmarked with angles of declination. Richard had never before seen a book aboutmagic that contained such equations, celestial observations, andmeasurements—not that he had actually seen that many books about magic.Although, he recalled, The Book of Counted Shadows that he had memorized as aboy did have a number of sun and star angles that were necessary to know inorder to open the boxes of Orden.Yet more formulas were scratched in the margins, but by different hands, as ifsomeone had come along and done the sums to check the work in the book, orperhaps approached it with updated information. In one instance, several of thenumbers in an elaborate table were crossed out, with arrows pointing from newnumbers scribbled in the margins to the stricken numbers in the tables. Zeddoccasionally stopped Richard from turning pages in order to point out anequation and explain the symbols involved in the calculation.Like a dog watching a bone, Nathan’s dark azure eyes tracked the pages asRichard slowly turned each over, idly looking for anything that made sense tohim as Zedd droned on about overlapping transpositional forks and tripleduplexes bound to conjugated roots compromised by precession and sequential,proportional, binary inversions shrouding flawed bifurcations that the formulasrevealed which could only be detected through Subtractive levorotatory.Nathan and Ann stared without blinking. Once, Nathan even gasped. Annincrementally went ashen. Even Nicci seemed to be listening withuncharacteristic attention.The unfathomable concepts made Richard’s head spin. He hated that feeling ofdrowning in incomprehensible information, of trying to keep his head above thedark waters of complete confusion. It made him feel dumb.Intermittently, Zedd referred to numbers and equations from the book. Nathan andAnn acted like they thought Zedd was on the verge of revealing not only how theworld was going to end but the precise hour.“Zedd,” Richard finally asked, interrupting his grandfather in the middle of asentence that showed no signs of ever coming to an end, “is there any way youcan boil this stew down to some meat that I can chew?”Mouth agape, Zedd regarded Richard for a moment before pushing the book acrossthe table to Nathan. “I’ll let you read it for yourself.”Nathan cautiously picked up the book as if the Keeper himself might pop out athim.Zedd turned back to Richard. “Basically, to put it in terms you might bettergrasp, and at great risk of oversimplifying it, imagine that prophecy is like atree, with roots and branches. Like a tree, prophecy was continually growing.What these wizards were basically saying was that the tree of prophecy behavedas if there were a kind of life to it. They weren’t saying that it was alive,mind you, only that in a number of ways it mimicked—not duplicated—someattributes of a living organism. It was this property that allowed them to comeup with their theory and from that run their calculations—in much the way thereare parameters by which you can judge the age and health of a tree and from thatextrapolate about its future.“During a previous time when there had been a great many prophets and wizardsaround, the works of prophecy and its many branches grew quite rapidly. With allthe prophets who had contributed, it had solid, fertile ground in which to grow,and deep roots. With new prophets constantly bringing new vision to thecollected works, new forks of prophecy sprouted continuously and those newbranches, over time as other prophets added to them, grew thick and strong. Asit grew, prophets continually examined, observed, and interpreted events,enabling them to tend the living stock and prune the deadwood.“But then, the birthrate of prophets began to plummet and with each passing yearthere were fewer and fewer of them to attend to such duties. Because of this,the growth of the tree of prophecy began to slow.“In essence, to explain it in simple terms you can understand, the tree ofprophecy had in a way matured. Like an old monarch oak in a forest, thesewizards knew that the vast tree of prophecy had many years of life ahead of itas a mature entity, but they also knew what the future eventually held in store.“Like all things, the existence of prophecy could not be eternal. As timepassed, prophetic events came to pass, becoming outdated. These no longer servedany use. In this fashion, if nothing else, the passage of time would eventuallysupersede all the predictions dealt with in the work. In other words, withoutnew prophecy, all the existing prophecy, whether or not they turned out to betrue forks, nonetheless would eventually reach their chance in the chronologicalflux. As they did, their time passed—they would be used up.“Thus, the commission studying the problem came to realize that the tree ofprophecy, without the growth and life that it drew from prophets, from theconstant stream of prophecy feeding the many branches, would eventually die.Their task, and the purpose of this book, Continuum Ratios and ViabilityPredictions, was to try to predict how and when this would happen.“The best minds in prophecy studied the problem, took a measure of the health ofthe tree of prophecy. Through known formulas and predictions based on not onlyobserved patterns in the decline of growth in prophecy, but a decline inprophets to sustain it, they determined how this particular tree of knowledgewould become heavy with the deadwood of false and expired prophecy as propheticforks were reached and chronology moved on down the sections of branches stillviable. As this happened—as the tree of prophecy grew thick with age anddeadwood that could no longer be culled by true prophets—they predicted how itwould become susceptible to, to, well, a kind of malady, a decay, much like anold tree in the forest will eventually become susceptible to disease.“That decline in viability, they found, would, over time, leave prophecyvulnerable to any number of ever growing problems. The infirmity that theyconcluded would be the most likely to strike first would come in a form theydescribed as wormlike. They thought that it would begin to infest and destroythe living portions of the tree of prophecy itself, meaning the branches thatare contemporary at the time of this wormlike infestation. In fact, they calledit just that—a prophecy worm.”The air felt heavy in the thick silence.Hands in his back pockets, Richard shrugged. “So what’s the cure?”Astonished by the question, Zedd stared at Richard as if he’d just asked how toheal a thunderstorm. “Cure? Richard, these experts who wrote this book predictedthat there wasn’t any cure, as such. They concluded, in the end, that withoutthe vitality provided by new prophets, the tree of prophecy would eventually rotand die.“They said that prophecy would only come back strong and healthy when newprophets returned to the world—in effect, when a seed of new prophecy sproutedand flourished. Old trees die and make room for the new shoots. It wasdetermined by these learned wizards that the fate of prophecy as we know it isalso doomed to aging, infirmity, and eventual death.”Richard had had to deal with any number of problems caused by prophecy, but thegloomy expressions around the table were infectious. It almost felt like ahealer had come out of a back room to announce that an aging relative was nearto passing on.He thought about all the gifted prophets, devoted to their calling, who hadworked all of their lives to contribute to this great body of work that was nowwithering and dying. He thought about the statue he himself had worked so hardto create and how it made him feel when it was destroyed.He thought, too, that it might simply be the concept of death itself, in anyform, that was so dismal because it reminded him of his own mortality… and ofKahlan’s mortality.He also thought that it might be the best thing that could happen. After all, ifpeople no longer believed that prophecy had foreordained what would become ofthem, then maybe they would realize that they had to think for themselves anddecide what was in their own best interest. Maybe, if unchained from adeterministic mindset, people would realize that it was they themselves whoactually controlled their own destiny. If people comprehended what was really atstake, maybe they would come to realize the value of reason in the choices theymade, instead of mindlessly just waiting for what was to happen, to happen.“From what Ann and I have discovered,” Nathan said into the still, stale air ofthe library, “the branch of prophecy that is vanishing is that which refers totimes roughly since Richard was born. That, of course, makes the most sensebecause temporal souls nourish the active, living tissue of prophecy upon whichthis prophecy worm would feed. But I was able to determine that it hasn’t allsimply vanished, yet.”Zedd nodded. “It’s dying back, but from the root, so some of it is still alive.I’ve found pockets of it alive and well.”“That’s right—especially the portions from the present on into the future. Asyou suggest, it seems that the scourge has attacked the core of these branches,which began two or three decades back and so far have not extensively eatentheir way into future events.“That leaves sections of this prophetic branch—the branch involving you—that arestill alive,” the prophet said as he leaned on his hands toward Richard, “butonce it dies, we will then lose even those prophecies, along with the memory ofhow profoundly important they are.”Richard glanced from Nathan’s grim expression to Ann’s equally serious face. Heknew they had arrived at last at the heart of their purpose.“That is why we’ve come looking for you, Richard Rahl,” Ann said with graveintonation, “before it’s too late. We have come about prophecy that so far isstill alive and has warned us of the most serious crisis to face us since thegreat war.”Richard frowned, already unhappy that prophecy once again seemed about to causehim trouble. “What prophecy?”Nathan pulled a small book out of a pocket and flipped it open. As he held it inboth hands, he fixed Richard with a steady gaze to make sure he looked like hewas going to listen carefully.When Nathan was at last sure he had everyone’s attention, he began. “ ‘In theyear of the cicadas, when the champion of sacrifice and suffering, under thebanner of both mankind and the Light’“—he glanced up from under his bushyeyebrows—”that would be Emperor Jagang—’finally splits his swarm, thus shall bethe sign that prophecy has been awakened and the final and deciding battle isupon us. Be cautioned, for all true forks and their derivatives are tangled inthis mantic root. Only one trunk branches from this conjoined primal origin. Iffuer grissa ost drauka does not lead this final battle, then the world, alreadystanding at the brink of darkness, will fall under that terrible shadow.”“Dear spirits,” Zedd whispered. “Fuer grissa ost drauka is a cardinal link to aprophecy founding a principal fork. Conjoining it with this prophecy establishesa conjugate bifurcation.”Nathan arched an eyebrow. “Exactly.”Richard didn’t fully understand what Zedd had said, but he caught the drift. Andhe didn’t need them to tell him who fuer grissa ost drauka, the bringer ofdeath, was; it was him.“Jagang has split his forces,” Ann said with quiet power as she fixed Richard inher steady gaze. “He brought his army up near to Aydindril, hoping to finish it,but the D’Haran forces, along with the people of the city, made use of winter toescape over the passes to D’Hara and out of Jagang’s clutches.”“I know,” Richard said. “That escape over the passes in winter was by Kahlan’sorders. She’s the one who told me about it.”Cara looked up in surprise, apparently intending to dispute his account, butafter a glance at Nicci she decided to remain silent… at least for the moment.“At any rate,” Ann said, sounding annoyed by the interruption, “Jagang, unableto effectively use his vastly superior numbers to break through those heavilydefended, very narrow passes, has finally decided to split his forces. Leavingan army to watch the passes, the emperor himself took the main element of hisarmy south, headed all the way back down through the Midlands to skirt aroundthe barrier of mountains and then hook around and make his way up into D’Hara.“Our forces are headed south, down through D’Hara, to meet them. That was whywhen we were able to get a message from Verna about the condition of the booksof prophecy at the People’s Palace in D’Hara; she was able to ride south aheadof our army and go look them over herself.”“This is the year that the cicadas are returning,” Nicci said, sounding alarmed.“I’ve seen them.”“That’s right,” Nathan said, still leaning forward on both hands. “That meansthe chronology is now fixed. The prophecies have all made their connections andhave tumbled into place. Events are marked.” In turn, he met the gaze ofeveryone in the room. “The end is upon us.”Zedd let out a low whistle.“More importantly,” Ann said in an authoritative tone, “it means that it is timefor Lord Rahl to join the D’Haran forces and lead them in the final battle.Without you there, Richard, prophecy is quite clear; all will be lost. We havecome to escort you to your forces, to help insure that you make it. We dare notrisk delay; we must leave at once.”For the first time since they started talking about prophecy, Richard’s kneesfelt weak.“But I can’t,” he said. “I have to find Kahlan.”It sounded to him like a plea into a gale.Ann took a deep breath, as if to bite her tongue while she searched for someurgently needed patience, or maybe words that would persuade him and finallysettle the matter once and for all. The two Mord-Sith shared a look. Zeddpressed his thin lips tight while he considered. In frustration Nathan tossedthe book he was holding on the table and wiped his hand across his face as heplanted his left fist on a hip.Richard didn’t know what he could say to them all that would have any chance ofmaking them understand that something profoundly serious was wrong in the worldand Kahlan was only a piece of the puzzle—by far the most important piece, butstill a part of something much larger. Ever since the morning when she haddisappeared, he had argued himself sick about the urgent need to find her and itnever seemed to do any good at convincing anyone that he knew what he wastalking about. He had no interest in yet again wasting his energy on the samefruitless explanations.“You what?” Ann said, her displeasure bubbling up to the surface like dross in acauldron. At that moment, she was very much again the Prelate, a squat woman whosomehow managed to seem towering.“I have to find Kahlan,” Richard repeated.“I don’t know what you’re talking about. We simply don’t have time for any ofthis nonsense.” Ann had dismissed his wants, interests, and needs out of hand,to say nothing of what he believed were his rational and important reasons. “Wehave come to see to it that you get to the D’Haran army immediately. Everyone iswaiting on you. Everyone is depending on you. The time has come when you mustlead our forces in the final battle that is now rapidly descending upon us.”“I can’t,” Richard said in a quiet but firm voice.“Prophecy demands it!” Ann shouted.Richard realized that Ann had changed. Everyone had changed in little ways sinceKahlan had disappeared, but Ann had changed in more overt ways. The last timeshe had come, with the very same purpose, to demand that Richard go with her tolead the war, Kahlan had thrown Ann’s journey book in a fire, telling the formerPrelate that prophecy was not driving events, but rather Ann was by trying tomake people follow prophecy in an effort to make it come true, that she wasacting as prophecy’s enforcer. Kahlan had shown Ann how she herself, as thePrelate, by being prophecy’s handmaiden, might very well have actually been theone who’d brought the world to the brink of cataclysm. Because of Kahlan’swords, Ann had done some deep soul-searching that had eventually helped make hermore rational, and more understanding of how Richard was the one who had tochoose to do what was right.Now, with the memory of Kahlan gone, everything that had happened with Kahlanwas also wiped away. Ann, like everyone else, had reverted to the dispositionshe’d shown before Kahlan’s influence. It made Richard’s head hurt, sometimes,just trying to recall exactly what Kahlan had done with everyone that theywouldn’t now remember so that he could take that into account when he dealt withthem. With some people, like Shota, it had actually in some ways helped him.Shota, for instance, because of losing her memory of Kahlan, hadn’t recalledthat she told Richard that if he ever returned to Agaden Reach she would killhim. With other people, like Ann, it was proving to make matters much moredifficult.“Kahlan threw your journey book in a fire,” he told her. “She was fed up withyou trying to control my life, as am I.”Ann frowned. “I accidentally dropped my journey book in the fire myself.”Richard sighed. “I see.” He didn’t want to argue because he knew it would do nogood. No one in the room believed him. Cara would do whatever he wanted her todo, but she didn’t believe him. Nicci didn’t believe him, but wanted him to actas he believed he must. Nicci was the one who had actually given him the mostencouragement he had gotten since Kahlan had disappeared.“Richard,” Nathan said in a gentler, more benevolent voice, “this is not somesimple little thing. You have been born to prophecy. The world stands at thebrink of a great dark age. You hold the key to preventing a slide into thatlong, terrible night. You are the one prophecy says can save our cause—the causeyou yourself believe in. You must do your duty. You can’t let us down.”Richard was sick and tired of being driven by events. He was at his wits endwith not understanding what was going on, with always feeling like he was onestep behind the rest of the world and two steps behind whatever had happened toKahlan. He was getting angry that everyone was telling him what to do and no onewas interested in what was of paramount importance to him. They didn’t even wantto let him decide his own fate. They thought prophecy had already decided forhim.It had not.He needed to find out the truth of what had happened to Kahlan. He needed tofind Kahlan, period. He was fed up with wasting time on what prophecy, alongwith any number of people, thought he ought to be doing. Anyone who was nothelping him was, in reality, holding him back from something vitally important.“I have no responsibility to live up to what anyone else expects of me,” he saidto Ann as he picked up the small book Nathan had brought with him.Ann and Nathan stared in surprise.He felt Nicci’s reassuring hand on the small of his back. She may not believe inhis memory of Kahlan, but at least she had helped him see that he had to be trueto his principles. She wouldn’t allow him to lose by default. She had been avalued friend when he needed one the most.The only other person he knew who would stand by him in that way, stand up tohim in that way, was Kahlan.He thumbed past all the blank pages in the book Nathan had brought. Richard wascurious to see if there was more that might change the picture, if they wereonly telling him what they wanted him to believe. He also would like to findsomething—anything—that would help him understand what was going on.And something was going on. Zedd’s explanation of the prophecy worm soundedairtight, but something about it bothered Richard. It explained the missing textin the books of prophecy in a way that suited what these people wanted tobelieve. It was too convenient and, worse, it was too much of a coincidence.Coincidence always made Richard suspicious.Nicci had a good point as well; it seemed just a little too convenient that thebody buried down at the Confessors’ Palace would have a ribbon with Kahlan’sname embroidered on it… Just in case there was any doubt, should someone dig upthe body?After blank page upon blank page, Richard found the writing. It was exactly asNathan had read it.In the year of the cicadas, when the champion of sacrifice and suffering, underthe banner of both mankind and the Light finally splits his swarm, thus shall bethe sign that prophecy has been awakened and the final and deciding battle isupon us. Be cautioned, for all true forks and their derivatives are tangled inthis mantic root. Only one trunk branches from this conjoined primal origin. Iffuer grissa ost drauka does not lead this final battle, then the world, alreadystanding at the brink of darkness, will fall under that terrible shadow.There were several things about the passage that puzzled Richard. For one thing,the reference to cicadas. It seemed a lowly creature to be worthy of propheticmention, to say nothing of such a central role in the—purportedly—most importantprophecy in three thousand years. He supposed that it could make sense that itwas a key that helped set the chronology, but, from what others had told him,prophecy never went out of its way to set chronology, making it one ofprophecy’s most difficult issues.It also troubled him that this prophecy, so distant in so many ways from theother he had read at the Palace of the Prophets, would also refer to him in HighD’Haran as fuer grissa ost drauka. He supposed that it could be, as Zedd hadsuggested, that such a linkage meant it was important.But the link to the prophecy Richard had seen at the Palace of the Prophets withthe reference to fuer grissa ost drauka was strongly connected to somethingelse: the boxes of Orden.In the old prophecy that named Richard the bringer of death, the word deathmeant three different things, depending on how it was used: the bringer of theunderworld, the world of the dead; the bringer of spirits, spirits of the dead;and the bringer of death, meaning to kill. Each meaning was different, but allthree were intended.The second meaning had to do with how he used the Sword of Truth, and the thirdsimply that he’d had to kill people. But the first meaning involved the boxes ofOrden.He supposed that in the context of the prophecy at hand, the third meaningseemed the obvious, that he had to lead the army and kill the enemy, so callinghim fuer grissa ost drauka did make sense. Yet again, things seemed awfullyconvenient.All the convenient explanations and coincidences were making Richard more thanjust a little suspicious. With Kahlan’s disappearance involved, he felt thatthere had to be more to what was going on.He turned to the page ahead of the passage, and then the one preceding it,checking. They were blank.“I have a problem with this,” he said, looking up at all the eyes watching him.“And what would that be?” Ann asked as she folded her arms. She used the sametone of voice she would have if she’d been talking to an inexperienced,untrained, ignorant boy freshly brought to the Palace of the Prophets to betrained in the use of his gift.“Well, there’s nothing around it,” he said. “It’s all blank.”Nathan covered his face with a hand while Ann threw her arms in the air in agesture of baffled outrage. “Of course not! They’ve vanished, along with a greatdeal more. That’s what we’ve just been talking about. That’s why this one is soimportant!”“But without knowing the context, you can’t really say that this one isimportant, now, can you? To understand any information one must know thecontext.”Contrary to Ann and Nathan’s agitation, Zedd smiled to himself at lessons taughtlong ago and remembered.Nathan looked up. “What does that have to do with this prophecy?”“Well, for all we know, there might have been mitigating text right before this,or something right after that went on to dismiss this. With the copy missing howare we to know? This prophecy could have been superseded by just aboutanything.”Zedd smiled. “The boy has a point.”“He’s not a boy,” Ann growled. “He’s a man, and the Lord Rahl, the head of theD’Haran Empire that he himself pulled together to fight the Imperial Order, andhe’s supposed to lead those forces. All of our lives depend on him doing so.”As Richard flipped back through the book, he saw writing that he hadn’t seen thefirst time. He paged back to it.“Here’s something else that didn’t vanish,” he said.“What?” Nathan asked with incredulity as he twisted around to look. “There wasnothing else. I’m sure of it.”“Right here,” Richard said, tapping a finger on the words. “It says, ‘Here wecome.’ What could that mean? And why did it not vanish?”“ ‘Here we come’?” Nathan’s face distorted in a look of confusion. “I never sawthat before.”Richard turned back more pages. “Look. Here it is again. Same thing. ‘Here wecome.’““I could have missed it once, perhaps,” Nathan said, “but there is no way Icould have missed a second one. You must be wrong.”“No, look,” Richard said, turning the book to show the prophet. He went backwardthrough the book, turning blank pages until he came to writing. “Here it isagain. A whole page of the same thing written over and over.”Nathan’s jaw hung in speechless astonishment. Nicci peered over Richard’sshoulder. Zedd rushed around next to him to see the writing in the book. Eventhe two Mord-Sith came to have a look.Richard turned a page forward, to what a moment before had been blank. There,down the page, was the same sentence written over and over and over.Here we come.“I watched you turning it back.” Nicci’s silken voice carried a clear undertoneof disquiet. “I know that page was blank an instant ago.”Goose bumps prickled up Richard’s arms. The hair at the nape of his neck lifted.He looked up and saw something dark coalescing out of the deep shadows beneaththe beam of sunlight coming from the high window at the end of the room.Too late, he remembered Shota’s warning not to read prophecy, that if he did theblood beast would be able to find him.He reached for his sword.His sword wasn’t there."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 53With a wail that sounded like the condemned souls of a thousand sinners,tumbling angles and swirls and streaks of darkness materialized out of thedarkness itself, like shadows coming to life.As the tables at the far end of the room were violently upended, the dark tangleexploded through them. Splinters of wood of every size flew through the air.Tables shattered in succession as the beast born of a clutch of shadows cameraging across the room toward Richard.The sound of popping and splintering wood boomed through the dusty air of thelibrary.Cara and Rikka both sprang in front of Richard, each with her Agiel in her fist.He knew all too well what would happen should they encounter the beast. Thethought of Cara being hurt like that again ignited his rage. Before they couldcharge toward the dark mass smashing through the heavy library tables, hesnatched them both by their long blond braids and with a roar of anger tossedthem back.“Don’t get in its way!” he yelled at both Mord-Sith.Ann and Nathan both cast their arms toward the thing, unleashing magic that madethe room shimmer as if seen through the waves of heat over a roaring fire.Richard knew that they were compressing the very air itself in an attempt todrive back the attack. Their efforts had no effect on the knot of shadows thatrolled and twisted through solid wood as it came across the room. They allbacked away, trying to keep distance between them and the threat.Richard ducked as a long board—the entire edge of one of the shatteredtables—whipped past his head and smashed against a post. One of the lamps brokeopen, sending flaming oil splashing across the ancient carpets, setting themablaze. Gray smoke billowed up behind them as they faced the beast charging forRichard.Zedd unleashed a fiery bolt of lightning that passed right through the center ofthe dark mass of disorder as if it were not even there, only to hit thebookshelves against the far wall. Books and flaming paper flew up into the air.Great clouds of dust and smoke boiled up as the room filled with the sound ofthe cacophonous blast.Terrible wails and keening, like the howls of the doomed through an open doorwaydown into the depths of the underworld, came from the beast as it came everonward, crashing through the thick mahogany posts. Lamps spun through the air asthey were flung aside, their silver reflectors casting flickering light aroundthe room and creating shadows that gathered into the beast as it grew moredense, and darker yet.Magic being hastily conjured by Ann and Nathan wasn’t visible to Richard, but itseemed to pass right through the beast, as if it were made of nothing more thanit appeared, shadows all jumbled together, and yet the knot of darkness crashedthrough solid wooden tables and posts, splintering them as the thing advancedacross the room. Twisting beams squealed and boards shrieked under the stress asanother post snapped. The edge of the balcony sagged, then dropped several feetbefore hanging drunkenly. Another post exploded as it was pushed past itscapacity to bend by the onward rush of the dark menace. The edge of the balconydropped several more feet. Bookshelves teetered on the tilting floor and thentoppled, sending an avalanche of books plunging down into the main room.Amidst all the confusion, destruction, and noise, as he backed across the room,watching the approaching menace, trying to think of how to counter it, Richardfound his shirt grabbed at the shoulder. With surprising strength, Nicci rammedhim through the open doorway. Tom, standing guard in the hallway, snatchedRichard’s other arm and helped pull him out of the library as Cara and Rikkafollowed, guarding his retreat.In the room, the beast continued onward, smashing anything in its way as itturned toward the doorway, toward Richard.Ann, Nathan, and Zedd all summoned forces Richard couldn’t even see, but hecould sense them by the hum in the air and the radiating waves of a queazyfeelings it gave him in the pit of his stomach. He could feel the air beingbuffeted as magic was conjured and cast.None of it did any good. They might as well have been attacking shadows.Nicci turned back to the room from the doorway and lifted a fist toward thesnarl of shadows tumbling toward her. The sudden explosion made everyone winceand duck as she unleased a bolt of power that was both blindingly bright and icydark laced together into one terrible blast. The discharge of thundering powerrocked the Keep, shaking the floor and rising dust from every crack and corner.The twisting rope of destruction exploded through the beast, spraying apart.Showers of sparks rained down as bookshelves flew asunder. Wood, debris, andhundreds of books along with sheafs of paper were blasted into the air, leavingfluttering pages to drift through the pandemonium. It looked like a blizzard ofpaper had been turned loose in the room.The deafening discharge of power from Nicci that rocked the Keep also slicedright through the stone walls like flaming pitch through paper. Through thejagged slashes cut in solid stone, ribbons of dusty bluish sunlight suddenlypenetrated into the room. The contrast of harsh light against the otherwise darkroom made it all the harder to see the murky collection of shade and shadow asit moved through the confusion of destruction.Everyone covered their ears as the terrible wail that sounded like lost soulsincreased to a terrifying pitch, as if the power Nicci had set upon it hadreached down into the underworld to sear them in their dark sanctuary.While it didn’t look to have done much to stop the shadowy beast, it did seem toget its attention. Nothing else had.Nicci ran out through the door and shoved Richard, starting him moving down thehallway. He was reluctant to leave Zedd to such a threat, but Richard knew thatthe thing was after him and not his grandfather. Zedd would be safer if Richardran. He didn’t think, though, that running was necessarily the solution to hissafety.“Stay out of its way,” Richard told Tom. “It will rip you to shreds. That goesfor you two as well,” he said to Cara and Rikka as they shepherded him down thehall.“We understand, Lord Rahl,” Cara said.“How do we kill it?” Tom asked as they ran sideways down the hall, keeping awary eye toward the library.“You can’t,” Nicci answered. “It’s already dead.”“Oh great,” he muttered as he turned back to help Nicci, Cara, and Rikka makesure that Richard kept moving. Richard didn’t really think that he needed anyphysical encouragement. The wails of the dead were enough to urge him to run.Flashes of light along with angry shrieks came from the doorway as those in theroom still fought to destroy, or at least contain, what looked like nothing somuch as living shadows. Richard knew that they were wasting their time. It wasmade in part with Subtractive Magic and they had no weapon against that. Thething had already proven that much to them, but they were probably trying todistract it so as to give Richard time to get away. So far, it hadn’t provenitself susceptible to such tactics. Shota had told him as much.At an intersection, Richard took the paneled hall to the right. The rest of themfollowed. At intervals they passed open areas with chairs and couches and darklamps. Such spots must have once hosted warm conversation and companionship.As they turned and ran down a wider corridor with tan, troweled plaster wallsand golden oak floors, a wall ahead exploded. Dust and debris billowed towardthem. Richard slid to a stop on the polished wood floor and reversed directionas the jumble of shadows emerged from the white cloud of dust. Everyone else hadpreviously pushed him on ahead, so that now, having had to turn around, he wasat the rear as the beast rapidly closed the distance.The dark snarl looked like it had collected yet more random shadows along theway—small angled shadows, broad leafy shade, inky dark corners, dark haze ofdusk—and crumbled them all together like wadding up paper. The way the shadowsfolded back on themselves made swirling black shapes that constantly eddied overand under and through one another. It was dizzying to watch, even for the briefglimpses he took as he ran.And yet, it was so insubstantial that when he glanced over his shoulder he couldsee light from windows far off down the hall right through the thing. Even so,as they raced around corners, the beast would sometimes go wide and graze thewalls, and when it did, it ripped apart the wood, or plaster, or stone as easilyas a bull going through bramble.Richard had no idea how to fight a cluster of crumbled shadows that could tearthrough solid stone without even slowing.He recalled Victor’s men in the woods, so violently ripped to shreds in meremoments. He wondered if this was the thing that had slashed through them, ifthis was the fate they faced that terrible morning when the blood beast camelooking for Richard.Two wizards and two sorceresses had now tried to stop Jagang’s conjured beastwithout any practical effect. And Nicci was more than a mere sorceress. She hadbeen taught the sinister art of how to use Subtractive Magic in exchange fordark oaths that Richard feared to think about. Even that hadn’t stopped thebeast, although it did seem to get a reaction.Nicci stopped and turned to the dusky collection of shadows careening down thepaneled oak halls behind them. She looked like she intended to make a stand. Ashe caught up with her, Richard, without slowing, planted his shoulder into hermiddle, knocking the wind from her as he lifted her clear of the floor, carryingher over his shoulder like a sack of grain as he ran.The halls all around lit in a blinding flash of white light as Nicci—havingquickly recovered her breath—cast magic behind even as she was being carted downthe hall. The floor shook, nearly knocking Richard from his feet as he ran.Blackness, like the flash of light, caught them and swept past for an instant asNicci unleashed terrible power at the thing chasing them. By the hauntingkeening that echoed through the halls, Richard thought that Nicci’s effort musthave done something.She seized his shirt in both fists as she squirmed. “Let me down, Richard! Letme run myself! I’m only slowing you down and it’s catching up with us! Hurry!”Richard immediately spun her around in his right arm so that she would be facingthe right way. As he dropped her to the ground he kept his arm around her waistuntil he was sure she had her balance and was up to speed with the rest of them.With Nicci beside him and Tom, Cara, and Rikka right in front of him, they allraced down halls without knowing where they were going. They switched randomlyfrom right turns to left, going past some intersections while taking others. Hecould hear the beast crashing after them. Sometimes it followed down the hallsand corridors, sometimes, when they went around a corner, it clipped though thewalls, trying to close the distance, trying to get to him. Stone, mortar, andwood seemed to make no difference to the thing as it broke through each withequal ease. He knew that a thing conjured by Sisters of the Dark and tied to theunderworld would have abilities that no ordinary creature would possess, so hehad no idea what the limits of it might be.As he ran, he yelled to the two Mord-Sith and Tom. “You three go straight! Tryto get the thing to follow you!”They looked back as they ran and nodded to his orders.“That thing isn’t going to follow them,” Nicci said in a low voice as she leanedtoward him as best she could at a full run.“I know. I have an idea. Stay with me—I’m going to take those stairs up ahead.”At a stairwell, as the three in front shot past it, Richard hooked a hand on theblack stone sphere atop the granite newel post, spinning himself around it andto the right. Nicci did the same and they both shot down the stairs at fullspeed. The beast cut the corner, crashing through the post, sending granitefragments riccocheting off the walls and the sphere bouncing down the hall.Cara, Rikka, and Tom, having already passed the stairs, slid to a stop on thepolished marble floor. They were trapped above the beast. They immediatelyfollowed it down the stairs.Richard and Nicci bounded down the steps three or four at a time. He could hearthe otherworldly howl of the thing right behind him. It felt as if it weretouching the hair at the back of his neck—it was that close.At the bottom of the stairs, Richard cut to the right, following a stonepassageway. The beast went wide, crashing into a tan, polished marble wall. Thestone slab shattered with a loud bang but the beast rushed onward. At the firststairwell Richard came to he raced down it, then took the second and thirdflight down as well to the bottom.The broad hallway running straight off from the stairs had carpets at regularintervals, making it more difficult to keep their footing. The walls had beadedwainscoting beneath smooth plaster. Brackets spaced down the passageway,centered above each carpet held what looked like glass globes that brightened asRichard raced toward each one in turn. He ran as fast as he could, Nicci at hisside, the shadows tumbling onward like death itself right on their heels.At spiral iron stairs, Richard jumped sidesaddle onto the railing and slid atbreakneck speed in a corkscrew course down into the darkness. Right with him,Nicci threw one arm around his neck for balance and did the same. Together theyplummeted downward, gaining some precious distance on their pursuer.At the bottom the railing spilled them out onto a cold, tiled floor. They bothtumbled across the smooth green tiles and slid to a sprawling stop. Richardscrambled to his feet and snatched one of the glowing spheres from a bracket.“Come on, hurry,” he said as Nicci did the same.They raced through endless rooms and passageways, taking as wild a route as hecould in an effort to shake their hunter. Occasionally they gained a preciousfew paces. At other times, especially in the halls, the thing regained thedistance and inched ever closer. Some of the rooms were cozy paneled suites. Thebeast seemed to suck the shadows right out of the cold, dark fireplaces as itpassed them. The globes they carried cast a warm glow across intricately wovencarpets and richly upholstered chairs. Bookcases held leather volumes. Richardaccidentally knocked over a bookstand, but kept his balance and kept running.After charging down yet more flights of stairs, some broad with landings andothers nothing more than narrow shafts that seemed bottomless, the rooms beganto become less grand. Some of the halls were tiled on all sides with oddpatterns. One of the chambers was immense and empty, with fat round stonepillars spaced evenly throughout. The lights they carried were not enough topenetrate the farthest reaches. Occasionally, the passages were little more thanshafts chiseled through solid rock.Other rooms and halls were protected with shields that Richard deliberatelycharged through. He didn’t want Cara, Rikka, and Tom coming near the thingchasing him. He didn’t want them meeting the same fate as Victor’s men. He knewthat Cara would be furious at him when she found herself blocked by shields. Hehoped he lived to hear her lecture.They emerged from what appeared as they’d run through it to be a storage roomfor construction material, with burlap bags and stone stacked to each side.Richard recognized the material from his time in Altur’Rang at forced laborworking on Emperor Jagang’s palace. Now Jagang’s beast was hunting him down.They emerged on the far side of the storage room into a long, corridor with aslate floor. The smooth, stone block walls rose uninterrupted to a lofty ceilingthat had to be at least a hundred and fifty feet overhead, creating a narrow,towering vertical slash through the interior of the Keep. Down at the bottom ofthat soaring passageway, Richard felt like an ant.He immediately cut to the right down the immense corridor. The booming drumbeatof their boots echoed all around him as he ran with all his strength. He soonhad to slow a bit for Nicci. They were both near the end of their endurance. Thewail of a thousand dead souls tumbled ever onward, never seeming to tire.As he ran, Richard couldn’t even see the end of the tall passageway disappearinginto the distance. That this was just one corridor of many gave him a profoundsense of the enormity of the Keep.Arriving at an intersecting passage to the left, Richard turned and ran down ita short distance to where they encountered an iron stairwell. Trying to catchhis breath, he glanced back and saw the knot of shadows round the corner.Pushing Nicci ahead of him, they bounded down the stairs together.At the bottom they found themselves in a small, square room that was little morethan an intersection of stone passageways going off in three directions. Richardheld the glowing sphere out, taking a quick glance in each passageway. He couldsee nothing down two of them. In the one to the right he thought he sawsomething glimmering. He’d been down in the Keep before and had encounteredstrange places and one of those places was what he needed now.Together he and Nicci raced down the passageway. As he’d thought, it wasn’t verylong, just long enough to take them under the colossal corridor and then alittle farther to where it opened into a kind of entry area with walls coveredin small fragments of colored glass meticulously arranged into elaborategeometric designs. The light from the two glowing spheres glinted off the smallglass pieces to send thousands of colored reflections sparkling and shimmeringaround the room. There was only one other opening, off against a far wall.Richard staggered to a halt. The strange glittering room made his skin crawlwith a sensation much like spiderwebs brushing against him. Nicci turned herhead away, swiping at her face as if to get something off her. He knew that sucha sensation was a part of a broader warning to stay away.Small pillars made of polished, gold-flecked stone stood to each side of thedistant opening holding up an entablature. The passageway beyond the pillars,not much taller than Richard, appeared to be roughly square and made of simplestone blocks that disappeared off into darkness. It seemed an elaborate andimpressive entry for such a plain hallway down in the bowels of the place.Richard hoped he was right about the reason.As they crossed the entry room and approached the opening, the area before thepillars began to give off a faint reddish glow. The air itself began to hum in avery troubling way.Nicci, her hair lifting out from her head as if she were about to be struck bylightning, seized his arm, pulling him back. “That’s a shield.”“I know,” Richard said as he dragged her by her grip on his arm.“Richard, you can’t. It’s not just an ordinary shield—not just Additive. It’slaced with Subtractive Magic. Such shields are deadly, this one especially so.”He looked back the way they’d come and saw the shadowy beast tumbling down thepassageway toward them. “I know, I’ve been through places like this before.”He hoped he was right that this particular shield was like the ones he’d beenthrough. He needed the kind that he’d encountered before, the kind that guardedthe most restricted areas. If it was anything less, or one that was actuallymore powerful or more restrictive than the ones he’d seen before, then they weregoing to be in a great deal of trouble.The only way out of the room they were in was back through the passage with thebeast that was coming for them, or onward through the shield.“Let’s go. hurry.”Nicci’s chest heaved as she struggled to catch her breath. “Richard, we can’t gothrough there. That shield will take the flesh right off our bones.”“I’m telling you, I’ve done it before. You can command Subtractive Magic, so youcan make it through as well.” He started running toward the passage. “Besides,if we don’t, we’re dead anyway. It’s our only chance.”With a growl of surrender, she ran along with him through the shower ofglittering reflections from the glass mosaics that covered the walls of theroom. “You’d better be right about this.”He grabbed her hand and held it tight, just in case being born with theSubtractive side was necessary. Nicci had not been born with it, but hadacquired the use of it. He didn’t know a great deal about magic, but from whathe’d learned, there was a great gulf between being born with it and simply beingable to use it. He had helped others, without the gift, through shields before,so between her abilities, and his hold of her, he figured he could get herthrough—if, that was, he could make it through himself.The air all around them turned as red as a crimson fog. Without pause, Richardcharged right though the doorway, pulling Nicci along with him.The sudden avalanche of pressure felt like it would crush them. Nicci gasped.Richard had to force himself against that pressure in order to advance. At therazor edge of the plane along the opening surrounded by polished stone pillars,heat seared across his flesh. It was so intense that for an instant he thoughthe’d made a huge mistake, that Nicci had been right, and that the shield wouldburn the flesh right off his bones.Even as he flinched in reaction to the unexpected burning sensation, hismomentum carried him through the doorway. He was somewhat surprised not only tofind himself alive and well and not at all harmed, but that the passageway wasnot at all what it appeared from the other side. When he’d looked through theopening before, it looked like a simple stone block passage. Once past thepillars, it was polished stone that seemed to shimmer with a rippling silversurface that made it appear three-dimensional.A glance back showed the snarl of shadows streaking for the entrance to theopening. Still holding Nicci’s hand, Richard backed them farther into thesparkling passageway.He was too exhausted to run anymore.“Here we live or die,” he told her as he labored to catch his breath."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 54The shadow hit the opening with such a resounding thud that Richard thought thepassageway they were in would certainly be blown apart. What had been a somewhatcohesive, dark shape exploded apart like glass on granite, shattering intothousands of dark shards. Piercing wails of frightful anguish echoed through thepassageway in terrible, heartbreaking finality as light ignited in a blindingcrimson flash. At the shielded opening, black fragments of shadows tumbled backthrough the room that was filled with shimmering, sparkling reflections off theglass mosaics. With what looked like a year’s worth of meteor showers allcompressed into a single instant, the shadowy fragments burst into bright flaresthat flew in every direction as they glimmered into nothingness.It was suddenly quiet but for Richard and Nicci’s labored breathing.The beast was gone. At least it was gone for the moment.Richard let go of Nicci’s hand and they both flopped down heavily on the floorand slumped back against the iridescent silver wall as they panted inexhaustion.“You were looking for one of those shields, weren’t you?” Nicci asked as sheworked at recovering enough breath to talk.Richard nodded. “Nothing Zedd or Nathan or Ann conjured did anything to stop thebeast. What you did at least seemed to have had an effect, even if a small one.That made me think that there must be something that would be able to counterit, maybe not in totality, but at least in the form it presented this time.“I knew that the wizards from the time back when this place was built needed tostop anything that didn’t belong in here—and the beast, after all, was somethingfrom back in those times, something that Jagang had found described in oldbooks. So I figured that those who made the shields here must have had to takesuch eventualities into account.“Since they’re made to stop such threats, it takes, at the least, an element ofSubtractive Magic to get through the shields. But because the enemy would havehad Subtractive powers as well, I think the shields must also somehow read thenature of who is trying to pass through them, perhaps thereby interpreting thepotential level of threat. It could even be that as we were chased through theKeep and kept going through shields, they somehow gathered information on thenature not only of us, but of the beast as well so that when we reached thesehigher threshold shields, they had finally judged it a threat and stopped it.”Nicci considered what he’d said as she pulled sweaty strands of blond hair backoff her face. “No one really knows a great deal about the gifted back then, butit makes sense that such an ancient threat would be vincible to ancientdefenses.” She frowned as if an idea had come to her. “Maybe such shields wouldeven be a way to protect you if it reappears.”“Sure,” he said, “if I want to live down here like a mole.”She looked around. “Any idea where we are?”“No,” he said, letting out an exhausted sigh, “but I guess we’d better try tofind out.”They struggled to their feet and made their way the rest of the distance downthe short passageway. At the end they emerged into a simple room constructed ofstone blocks once covered in plaster that was now crumbling. The room was nomore than fifteen paces long and not nearly as wide, with books on shelves alongmost of the length of the wall to the left.While it did have some books, it was not a library like so many others he hadseen in the keep. For one thing, it was far too small. For another, it was notat all elegant, or even nice, but rather stark. At best, it could be calledutilitarian. Besides the shelves, the room was only wide enough for a table atthe far end beside a passageway leading out the other side. There was a fatcandle on the table and a wooden stool under it. The far passageway looked verymuch like the one they had come in through.When Richard took a look, he saw that it had the same shimmering silver stonewalls and another shield that looked just like the one they had come in throughat the other end of the room, so that, unlike a number of places in the Keepthat had shields, there was no way to go around and get into the room by way ofanother route without such powerful shields. It was through one of the twoshields or not at all.“With all the dust in here,” Nicci said, “it doesn’t look like anyone hascleaned in here for thousands of years.”She was right. The room was devoid of color other than the dirty gray color ofthe dust that coated everything. The hair at the nape of Richard’s neck stood onend as he fully realized why.“That’s because no one has been in here for thousands of years.”“Really?”He gestured to the far passage he’d just inspected. “The only two ways into hereare protected with shields that require Subtractive Magic to cross. Not evenZedd, the First Wizard himself, has ever been in here. He can’t pass Subtractiveshields.”Nicci brushed her hands together. “Especially these shields. I’ve dealt withshields most of my life. From what I felt of these, they’re deadly. I suspectthat without your help even I might have had some difficulty getting throughthem the first time.”Richard tilted his head to be able to better read the titles as he perused thebooks along the shelves. Some had no titles on the spines. Some were inlanguages he couldn’t read. Some looked like they might be journals. Several,though, looked curious. One small book, Gegendrauss, in High D’Haran meantCountermeasures. He pulled out another beside it of a similar small size titledOrdenic Theory. As he blew off a thick coating of dust, he realized then that itmust have caught his attention because Ordenic reminded him of Orden, as in theboxes of Orden. He wondered if there was any connection.“Richard, look at this,” Nicci called to him from the far passage.Richard tossed the book on the table as he made his way into the passageway,toward the shield. “What is it?”“I don’t know.” Her voice echoed, and then he saw the crimson glow brighten andfinally fade.He realized that she must have gone beyond the shield. Alarmed at first, Richardwas hugely relieved that there had been no horrific results. Nicci was anexperienced sorceress. He suspected that after having gone through the lastshield, she must have known what dangers to look for to tell her if she couldpass this one as well. He reasoned that perhaps the first shield, when he hadhelped her through it, had keyed to her, allowing her to cross shields like it.Pushing on through the plane of pressure and briefly searing heat, he entered asmall room beyond with glass mosaics, like the one at the other end of thelittle reading room. Both rooms had to be a kind of entryway before the shieldto provide warning to anyone coming near, or maybe they were somehow an aid tothe shields themselves. Nicci was standing just beyond, at an open iron door,her back to him, her thick fall of blond hair down around her shoulders.At the railing on the platform beside her, Richard looked out into a round towerroom at least a hundred feet across. Stairs spiraled up around the inside of thecurving outer wall. The tower rose above them for over two hundred feet. Atirregular intervals, small landings like the one where they stood interruptedthe steps wherever there was a doorway. In the gloomy expanse above, shafts oflight pierced the darkness.The place smelled of rot. At the bottom of the tower, not too far below thelanding were they stood, he saw a walkway with an iron railing that ringed theinside of the tower wall. Rain that could come in the openings above, along withseepage from the mountain itself, collected down in the center of the tower.Insects swarmed above the stagnant, inky water. Others skittered on its surface.“I know this place,” Richard said as he peered around, getting his bearings.“You do?”He started down the steps. “Yes, come on.”At the bottom, he followed the iron railing around to a wide platform in thewalkway before a spot where a door had once been. The doorway had been blastedapart and the opening was now perhaps twice its previous size. The jagged edgesof the broken stone were blackened in places. In other places the stone itselfhad been melted as if it were no more than candle wax. Twisting streaks on thesurface of the stone wall ran off in every direction away from the blasted hole,marking where a kind of lightning had flailed against the wall and burned it.Nicci stared in amazement. “What in the world happened here?”“This room was once sealed away, along with the Old World. When I destroyed thebarrier to the Old World, it blew this seal open.”“Why? What’s in here?”“The sliph’s well.”“The thing you told me about that those in ancient times used to travel greatdistances? The thing you’ve traveled in?”“That’s right,” he said as he stepped through the jagged opening that once hadbeen a doorway.The room inside was round, perhaps sixty feet across, its walls were alsoscorched in ragged lines as if lightning had gone wild in the place. A circularstone wall about waist-high, forming what looked like a huge well, occupied thecenter of the room.The domed ceiling was nearly as high as the room was wide. There were no windowsor other doors. To the far side of the sliph’s well was a table and a fewshelves. That was where Richard had found the remains of the wizard who had inancient times been sealed in the room when the barriers that had ended the greatwar had been brought to life. Thus trapped, the man had died in the sealed room.He had left behind a journal that the Mord-Sith Berdine now had. That journalhad in the past, as Richard and Berdine had translated it, revealed valuableinformation.Because of the importance of the information they’d gotten from the journal,they had called the man who wrote it Koloblicin, a High D’Haran word meaning“strong advisor.” Berdine and Richard had eventually taken to simply referringto the mysterious wizard as Kolo.Nicci held her glowing globe over the side and peered down the well. The smoothwalls fell away seemingly forever, the light illuminating the stone for hundredsof feet down before fading away into blackness.“And you say that you put the sliph to sleep?”“Yes, with these.” Richard tapped the insides of the leather padded silver wristbands he wore against one another. “She told me that when she ‘sleeps,’ as sheput it, she goes to be with her soul. She says it’s rapture for her to sleep.”“And you can call her back the same way? By using those bands?”“Well, yes, but, just like putting her to sleep, I would need to use my gift todo it. Not something I’d be at all eager to do again. I especially wouldn’t liketo be inside this room, with only one door, calling the sliph, when the bloodbeast was also called by my gift.”Nicci nodded as she saw his point. “Do you think the beast could follow youthrough the sliph?”Richard thought it over for a moment. “I can’t say for sure, but I imagine it’spossible. But even if it couldn’t it still manages to appear wherever I am, soI’m not sure it would even need to bother with using the sliph. From what I’velearned of its nature from you and Shota, as well as from experience, I suspectthat the beast is able to travel the underworld.”“And other people?” Nicci asked. “Can any of them use this?”“To travel in the sliph you need to have at least some element of both sides ofthe gift. That made it a problem in the great war and that’s why they had awizard always standing guard in this room and in the end why they had to seal itoff—so the enemy couldn’t come through right into the heart of the Keep.“Now, because of the requirement for an element of both sides of magic, thereare few who can use the sliph. Cara has captured gifted people who have AdditiveMagic, and she captured a man who Kahlan said wasn’t entirely human and whohappened to have an element of Subtractive Magic. It was enough so that Cara isable to travel in the sliph. A Confessor’s power is ancient and has an elementof Subtractive to it, so Kahlan can travel in the Sliph. Those are the only onesI know who could travel in the sliph—other than Sisters of the Dark. One of myformer teachers, Merissa, went through the sliph after me. You could travel inthe sliph as well. That’s about it.“Still, it remains a danger if awakened because Jagang could theoretically sendany of his Sisters of the Dark through it.”“What happens if you don’t have at least some element of both sides?” Nicciasked. “If, for example, someone like Zedd, a gifted person had only AdditiveMagic, tried to travel?”Richard reached over to rest his hand on the pommel of his sword, but his swordwasn’t there. It made him sick to expect it and then realize he’d given it toShota—to Samuel, actually. He put the constant, haunting worry of it from hismind.“Well, traveling takes you great distances, but it still takes some time—itisn’t an instant procedure. I think the time varies according to distance, but Iknow that it takes a number of hours, at least. The sliph looks something likeliving quicksilver. To remain alive within her while she takes you to the placeyou wish to travel, you must breathe her in, breathe in that silvery liquid. Youbreathe the sliph, that liquid, and it somehow keeps you alive. If you don’thave an element of both sides, it doesn’t work and you die. Simple as that.”For a fleeting moment, Richard gave thought to waking the sliph to ask if sheremembered Kahlan, but the ancient wizards, men of prodigious ability, hadcreated the sliph out of a very exclusive and high-priced whore. She had becomecaught up in political intrigue that had eventually cost her life. The nature ofthat woman was still partly evident in the sliph; she never revealed theidentity of one of her “customers.”“We’d better get back up there and let Zedd know we’re all right.” Richard’sthoughts returned to the immediate problems. “Cara is probably fit to be tied bynow.”“Richard,” Nicci said in a soft voice as he started to leave.He turned back to see her watching him. “Yes?”“What are you going to do about Ann and Nathan?”He shrugged. “Nothing. What do you mean?”“I mean, what are you going to do about the things they had to say? What are yougoing to do about the war? The time has come, and I think you know it. You can’tgo on chasing after your dream while the rest of the world faces the end ofeverything good—the end of all their hopes and dreams.”He stared at her a moment. She didn’t shy away from his gaze.“Like you said, that body down there didn’t prove anything.”“No, but it certainly does prove one thing: that you were wrong about what wewould find there. Digging up the grave failed to prove what you thought itwould—at the very least. That begs the question of why? Why was it differentthan you said it would be? The only possible answer I can think of is thatsomeone put it there with the idea that you would find it. But why?“It’s been a while since that night down at the grave. Since then you’veaccomplished nothing. Maybe it’s time you thought about the bigger picture. Andin the bigger picture, that prophecy makes the stakes pretty clear. I understandthe value of one life you love—even if she were real—but to some extent don’tyou think you have to balance that one life against the lives of everyone else?”Richard slowly paced off a ways, trailing his fingers along the top of the stonewall around the sliph. The last time he had traveled in the sliph he had takenKahlan to the mud people so they could be married.“I have to find her.” He looked back at Nicci. “I am not the tool of prophecy.”“Where will you go? What can you do next? You’ve been to Shota, and you camehere to Zedd. No one knows anything about Kahlan, or Chain-fire, or the rest ofit. You’ve exhausted all your ideas, all your options. If not now, then when isthe time to finally face reality?”Richard rubbed his fingertips across his brow. As much as he didn’t want toadmit it, he feared that Nicci was right. What was he going to do?He could think of nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. At least, nothingspecific, not at the moment, anyway. He couldn’t imagine what good it would dohim to wander around without a plan, without any idea where to look for Kahlan.The room was dead quiet. The sliph’s well was empty, the sliph off somewherewith her soul. He wondered if Kahlan was still alive. He swallowed as heexperienced one of those brief but terrifying moments when he wondered if sheever had been. He was so tired of the ever growing doubts, not just aboutKahlan, but about himself.At the same time, he was being crushed under the weight of guilt for notanswering the call to lead the D’Haran people against the terrible threat totheir freedom. He thought often of all the countless good people he didn’t evenknow who also had loved ones under mortal threat from the coming storm of theImperial Order. Could he just desert all of them in order to chase around,forever looking for Kahlan?Nicci moved closer.“Richard,” she said in a soft, silken, sympathetic voice, “I know it’s hard tosay it’s over… to say it’s over, and realize that you have to move on.”Richard broke the gaze first. “I can’t do that, Nicci. I realize that I can’texplain it to anyone’s satisfaction, but I just can’t do that. I mean, if shegot sick and died, then I would be devastated, yet eventually I know I wouldhave to deal with the business of life. But this is different. It’s almost as ifI know she’s in some dark river somewhere, calling for help, and I’m the onlyone who can hear her, who knows she in terrible danger of drowning.”“Richard—”“Do you really think I don’t care about all the innocent people under the threatof the horde coming to slaughter and enslave them? I do care. I can’t sleep withworry, and not only worry for Kahlan. Can you even begin to imagine how torn Ifeel?“How would you feel if you were torn between someone you loved and doing whateveryone else said was the right thing to do?“I wake in a cold sweat in the dead of night not only seeing Kahlan’s face, butthe faces of people who will never have a chance at life if Jagang isn’tstopped. When people tell me how all those people are depending on me, it breaksmy heart—both because I want to help them, and because they think they need me,because they think that I, one man, can be the difference in a war involvingmillions of people. How dare they put that much responsibility on me?”She came closer yet and gently put a hand to the side of his arm, rubbing up anddown in a reassuring gesture. “Richard, you know that I wouldn’t want you to doanything that you thought was wrong. Not even when it was to let you believe shewas dead based on what I knew wasn’t good evidence, even though I believe thatevidence, if for other reasons.”“I know.”“But since that night when you dug up the grave, while you’ve been wanderingaround thinking about what you can do, I, too, have been doing a lot ofthinking.”Richard flicked small stone fragments from the top of the well, not wanting tohave to look up at her. “And what have you come up with?”“Among other things, as I watched you walk the ramparts, a troublesome idea cameto me. I haven’t said anything about it yet partly because I don’t know for sureif it could be the answer to what is happening to you, and partly because if itis, then it would be even more trouble than any mere delusion caused by yourinjury. I don’t know if it’s really the answer, but I fear that it very wellmight be. Mostly, though, I haven’t said anything because the evidence is gone,so I have no way of proving it, but I think the time has arrived to broach thesubject.”“Evidence?” Richard asked. “You said that the evidence is gone?”Nicci nodded. “The arrow you were shot with. I fear that this may have all beencaused by that arrow, but in a different and far more disturbing way than we’verealized.”Richard was taken aback by her grave expression. “What do you mean?”“Did you see who shot the arrow that hit you? Who held the crossbow?”Richard took a deep breath while staring off as he sifted through the dimsnatches of mental images of the morning of the fight. He’d only just awakenedafter hearing the howl of a wolf. Shadowy tree limbs had appeared to move aboutin the darkness. Then there had been soldiers all around him. He’d had to fightoff men from all sides rushing in at him. He remembered quite vividly thefeeling of holding the Sword of Truth, of feeling the wire wound hilt in hishand, of its power surging through him.He recalled seeing men back in the trees shooting arrows at him. Most had bows,but there had been some with crossbows. That would have been rather typical forsuch a patrol of Imperial Order troops.“No… I can’t say as I recall seeing who shot the bolt that hit me. Why? What isit that you’ve come up with?”Nicci appraised his eyes for what seemed an eternity. Her ageless eyes sometimesreminded him of others with magic; Ann, the old Prelate; Verna, the new Prelate;Adie; Shota; and… Kahlan.“The barbs on that arrow made it impossible to get it out of you in any ordinaryway in time to save your life. I was in a desperate hurry. I never gave anythought to checking the arrow before I used Subtractive Magic to take it out ofexistence.”Richard didn’t like the direction toward which her worry seemed to be drifting.“Check it for what?”“A spell. A diabolically simple spell that would be profoundly destructive.”Richard was now sure he didn’t like her idea even though he hadn’t heard it,yet.“What kind of spell?”“A glamour spell.”“Glamour?” Richard frowned. “How would that work?”“Well, think of it as a love potion.”Richard stared at her in surprise. “A love potion?”“Yes, after a fashion.” She lightly tapped the fingers of opposite handstogether as she reflected on how best to explain it. “A glamour spell wouldcause you to have a mental vision of a woman, a real woman would be the normalobject of the spell, but as I thought about it I realized that it would workjust as well for an imaginary woman. Either way, it would make you fall in lovewith her. But even that is a rather weak way of describing such a powerfulspell. Under a glamour spell the woman would become an obsession. Such anobsession would be to the exclusion of almost everything else.“A glamour spell is a kind of dark secret among sorceresses, usually taught by agifted mother. Such a spell would be used to make a specific person fixate onthe subject of the spell, usually a real individual—the sorceress herself, inmost cases. Like I said, it’s a kind of love spell.“Some gifted women could not resist the lure of using a glamour on men. Thespell is so effective that at the Palace of the Prophets it was a very seriousmatter for one of the Sisters to even be suspected of using a glamour. To becaught using a glamour was a grave crime, the moral equivalent to rape. Thepunishment was severe. The sorceress was at the least banished, but she couldjust as well be hanged. There have been sisters convicted of such a crime.“As I recall, the last one caught at the palace was over fifty years ago. Shewas a novice, Valdora. The tribunal was split between hanging or banishment. ThePrelate broke the tie and had the young novice banished.“I would expect that Jagang’s Sisters know how to invoke a glamour spell. Itwouldn’t have been all that hard for one of them to tag a glamour to that arrow,or a number of the arrows that morning. If the arrow didn’t kill you, it wouldspell you.”“This is no spell,” Richard said, his tone turning darker.Nicci ignored not just his tone, but his denial as well. “It would explain agreat deal. A glamour spell seems absolutely real to the victim. It bends theirmind, their thinking, around the subject of the obsession.”Richard again raked his fingers back through his hair, trying not to get angrywith Nicci. “What would be the purpose of doing such a thing? Jagang wants tokill me. You’re the one who came and told me that he created a beast toaccomplish that task. The spell you’re talking about doesn’t make any sense.”“Oh, but it makes all the sense in the world. It would accomplish far more thanmerely killing you, Richard. Don’t you see? It would destroy your credibility.It would leave you alive to destroy your cause yourself.”“Myself? What do you mean?”“It would make you obsessed with the subject of the glamour to the exclusion ofanything else. It would make people think there was something wrong with you,think you were crazy.“It would make people begin to doubt you, and therefore your cause.“This spell would condemn you to a living death. It would destroy everythingthat means anything to you. It would give you a mad obsession that you totallybelieve is something real, but that you can never satisfy. There is good reasonwhy using a glamour spell was a serous crime.“In this case, at the same time as you go about trying to find the object ofyour manufactured memory, you see your cause begin to crumble because those youinspired and who believed in you now start to think that if you’re crazy, thenmaybe the things you’ve said were crazy as well.”Richard imagined that a victim of such a web would not be able to recognize theglamour spell within himself. And it was certainly true that nearly everyone wascoming to think he was crazy.“Truth does not depend on the person who says it. The truth is still the trutheven if stated by someone you don’t respect.”“That may be true, Richard, but others don’t necessarily act with such clearinsight.”He sighed. “I guess not.“As far as the beast, Jagang does not necessarily count on just one thing to dothe job and he has no reluctance to do more than is necessary to crush hisopponents. He might have figured that two plagues will be more certain to endthe threat of Richard Rahl than one alone.”Richard certainly didn’t doubt what she said about Jagang. Still, he didn’tbelieve it. “Jagang didn’t even know where I was. Those troops just happenedacross me as they were sweeping the woods, checking for threat, for their supplyconvoy.”“He knows you started the revolt down in Altur’Rang. He might have ordered thathis troops in the area carry arrows that were spelled by his Sisters just incase they ran across you.”Richard could see that she had indeed been doing a lot of thinking. She had ananswer for everything.He opened his arms out to the side and lifted his chin. “Then lay your hands onme, sorceress. Grab the spell and pull its wicked tentacles out of me. Restoremy sanity. If you really believe that a glamour spell is the cause of all ofthis, then use your gift to seek it out and put an end to it.”Nicci turned her gaze away and stared out the broken doorway at the gloom withinthe base of the huge tower.“To do that, I would need the arrow. It no longer exists. I’m sorry, Richard. Inever thought to check the arrow for a spell before I eliminated it. I wasfrantic to get it out of you in order to save your life. Still, I should havechecked.”He laid a hand on the back of her shoulder. “You didn’t do anything wrong, myfriend. You saved my life.”“Did I?” She turned to him. “Or did I condemn you to a living death?”He shook his head. “I don’t think so. Like you said, you wouldn’t let me believesomething if you thought the evidence was insufficient. That body buried downthere wasn’t sufficient proof. Yet, at the same time, it shouldn’t have beenthere, so I’m convinced that it proves that something really is going on. I justhaven’t figured out what.”“Or it proves that maybe your story is nothing more than part of a fabricationspawned by the mad obsession of a glamour spell.”“No one remembers what happened and that Kahlan isn’t buried there, but I do.It’s something solid that shows me, at least, that I’m not imagining all this.”“Or it is simply part of the delusion—whatever its cause. Richard, this justcan’t go on forever. It has to come to a close at some point. You’re at a deadend. Have you come up with anything else to try?”He put his hands on the stone wall of the sliph’s well. “Look, Nicci, I admitthat I’m running out of ideas, but I’m not ready to give up on her, to give upon her life. She means too much to me to do that.”“And how long do you think you can wander around not giving up on her, all thewhile the Imperial Order marches ever closer to our forces? I don’t like Ann’smeddling in my life any more than you like her meddling in yours, but she isn’tdoing it because she is trying to be malicious. She’s trying to preservefreedom. She’s trying to save innocent people from being slaughtered by brutes.”Richard swallowed back the lump in his throat.“I need to think about things, to gather my thoughts. I found some books in thatroom back there. I want to study them for a while, just a while, and try tothink things through, try to see if I can figure out what’s happening and why.If I can’t think of something… I just need to think of what to do next.”“And if you can’t think of what to do next?”Richard leaned on both hands as he stared off into the dark well, doing his bestto stifle his tears.“Please…”If he only knew who to fight, if only he could strike out at an enemy. He didn’tknow how to fight shadows in his mind.Nicci laid a hand gently on his shoulder. “All right, Richard. All right.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 55Nicci knocked on the round-top oak door and waited. Rikka, standing at her back,waited with her.“Come in,” came a muffled voice.Nicci thought that it sounded like Nathan’s deep, powerful voice, rather thanZedd’s. Inside the small, round room that Richard’s grandfather was fond ofusing, she saw the prophet along with Ann, her hands pushed into oppositesleeves of her simple, dark gray dress as she stood patiently waiting for theirinvited guest. Nathan, in dark brown trousers and high boots, with a ruffledwhite shirt under a sweeping cloak, looked more like an adventurer than aprophet.Zedd, in his simple robes, stood quietly at a round leaded window between bookcabinets with glassed doors, his hands clasped behind his back. He appeared tobe lost in thought as he gazed out at the city of Aydindril far below at thebase of the mountain. It was a beautiful view; Nicci could understand why hefavored the cozy room. Rikka started pushing the thick oak door closed.“Rikka, dear,” Ann said with a Prelate’s practiced smile, drawing theMord-Sith’s attention, “my throat is still terribly dry from all that smokeyesterday when that dreadful creature set the library ablaze. Would you mindmaking me some tea, maybe with a spot of honey?”Rikka, holding the half-closed door, shrugged. “Not at all.”“Any of your biscuits left?” Nathan asked with a wide smile. “Your biscuits werewonderful, especially when they’re warm.”Rikka gazed briefly at everyone in the small room. “I will bring biscuits andtea along with some honey.”“Thank you so much, my dear,” Ann said, the smile never breaking, as Rikkavanished out the door.Zedd, still watching out the window, hadn’t said anything.Nicci, ignoring Ann and Nathan, instead turned and addressed Zedd. “Rikka saidthat you wanted to see me.”“That’s right,” Ann said in his place. “Where is Richard?”“Down in that place I told you about, the place he found between the shieldswhere he will be safe. He is reading, looking for information, doing what aSeeker does, I suppose.” With exaggerated care, Nicci folded her fingerstogether. “So, the three of you want to talk to me about Richard.”Nathan huffed a short laugh that transformed itself into a throat-clearing coughwhen Ann glanced his way. Zedd, standing with his back to the rest of them,stared out the window without saying anything.“You always were a bright one,” Ann said.“It wasn’t exactly a guess that required great intellect,” Nicci said, notwanting to allow Ann to get away with such empty flattery. “If you please,withhold your praise until I do something to deserve it.”Both Nathan and Ann smiled. Nathan’s even looked genuine.Flattery had been a plague that had followed Nicci her whole life. “Nicci,you’re such a bright child, so you must give more of yourself.” “Nicci, you’reso beautiful, the most beautiful creature I’ve ever seen. I must hold you.”“Nicci, my dear, I simply must be allowed to sample your exquisite charms or Iwill surely die an impoverished man.” To Nicci, vacuous flattery was the soundof a prybar, a tool used by a thief as he tried to get at what she had.“What is it I can do for you,” Nicci asked in a businesslike voice.Ann, hands still pushed up opposite sleeves, shrugged. “We need to talk to youabout Richard’s unfortunate condition. It was quite shocking to discover himsuffering from delirium.”“I can’t say I disagree with that,” Nicci said.“Do you have any ideas?” the Prelate asked.Nicci glided her fingers back and forth across the polished top of themagnificent desk. “Ideas? What do you mean, ideas?”“Don’t play coy,” Ann said, her indulgent humor evaporating from her voice. “Youknow very well what we mean.”Zedd finally turned around, apparently not liking Ann’s tack. “Nicci, we’re veryworried about him. Yes, we’re worried because of the prophecy and that it sayshe must be the one to lead our forces and all the rest of it, but…” He lifted ahand and let it drop in frustration. “But we’re worried for Richard himself.There is something very wrong with him. I’ve known him from the day he was born.I’ve spent years with him, alone with him, with him around others. I’ve been soproud of that boy that I can’t begin to tell you. He always has been one tooccasionally do puzzling things, things that frustrate and confuse me, but I’venever seen him act like this. I’ve never seen him believe such crazy stories.You can’t imagine what it does to me to see him like this.”Nicci scratched an eyebrow, using it as an excuse to look away from the pain inhis hazel eyes. His white hair looked in even more disarray than usual. Helooked more thin than usual; he looked gaunt. He looked like a man who had notgotten much sleep for weeks.“I think I can understand your feelings,” she assured him. She took a deepthoughtful breath as she slowly shook her head. “I don’t know, Zedd. I’ve beentrying to figure it out since I found him that morning gasping for breath andalmost in the Keeper’s clutches.”“You said he lost a lot of blood,” Nathan said. “And that he was unconscious fordays.”Nicci nodded. “It’s possible that such a condition, such desperate fear of nothaving enough breath and thinking he was going to die that way, caused him todream up someone who loved him—a kind of trick to try to calm himself. I used tosometimes do something similar when I was afraid; I would put my mind in anotherelse, a pleasant place, where I was safe. With Richard, with the heavy loss ofblood and the abnormally long sleep after being healed, while he was regainingsome of his strength—enough strength to try to survive the ordeal—well, I thinkthat the whole time the dream could have grown and grown in his mind.”“And have taken over his thoughts,” Ann finished.Nicci met her gaze. “That was my thought.”“And now?” Zedd asked.Nicci turned her eyes up to gaze at the heavy oak beams across the ceiling asshe searched for words. “I don’t know anymore. I’m no expert in such things.I’ve not exactly spent my life as a healer. I would think that the three of youwould know a great deal more about such maladies than I do.”“Well, yes, as a matter of fact,” Ann said, making a face like she was glad tohear Nicci admit as much, “we would tend to agree with that assessment.”Nicci eyed all three of them suspiciously. “So, what do all of you think is hisproblem?”“Well,” Zedd began, “we’re still not ready to rule out a number of things that—”“Have you considered a glamour spell?” Ann asked, fixing Nicci in her steadystare the way she used to do to make novices tremble and confess to shirkingtheir chores.Nicci was no novice and no longer susceptible to such intimidation from on high.After having Jagang, in a blind rage, hold her with one meaty fist around herthroat and pound her face with the other, a stare was hardly something to makeNicci tremble. In fact, had the subject not been one so serious, one thatsincerely did concern her so, she might have laughed at the very effort of sucha stern look to elicit an incautious report.“It crossed my mind,” she said, seeing no purpose in denying it. “But I had toeliminate the arrow with Subtractive Magic if I was to save his life. I’m afraidthat, at the time, I never gave any thought to such an idea. I was franticallytying to keep him from dying. Perhaps I should have thought about the arrowbeing spelled, but I didn’t. With the arrow now gone there is no way to tell ifthat really was the case and, without the arrow, there’s no way to do anythingabout it if true.”Zedd rubbed his clean-shaven jaw as he looked away. “That certainly makes thingsmore difficult.”“Difficult?” Nicci said. “Such a spell isn’t at all easy to reverse even if youhave the object that in this manner infected the victim with a glamour. Withoutthat object, only the sorceress who cast the glamour can eliminate it. You musthave the web that carried the infection if you are to heal it.“And that’s if you know for certain that it was a glamour spell. It could besomething else. Whatever it is, spell of some sort, or delirium, you have toknow the cause if you’re to heal it.”“Not necessarily,” Ann said as she again stared at Nicci. “At this point thecause is no longer much of an issue.”Nicci’s brow twitched. “No longer an issue—what in the world are you talkingabout?”“If a person has a broken arm you set it and splint it. You don’t waste yourtime running around asking questions, trying to figure out exactly how theymanaged to break their arm. You need to take action to correct the ailment; talkwon’t correct it.”“We think he needs our help,” Zedd offered in a more conciliatory tone. “We allknow that the things he is saying are flat impossible. At first, when he saidthat he gave the Sword of Truth to Shota, I thought he had done somethingprofoundly foolish, but I’ve come to see that his actions weren’t willful norwere the dimensions of them so simply grasped. I reacted with an angry reprimandwhen I should have seen how ill he really is and dealt with it in that context.“There are times when you can see how someone might come to believe somethingodd, but Richard’s behavior is far beyond anything that could remotely bedescribed as odd. It’s become clear that he is delusional and we all now realizeas much.” He opened his hands in a beseeching gesture. “Is there anything at allyou can say in his behalf that makes any sense and that demonstrates how we maybe wrong in our analysis?”Zedd looked truly under great distress. It was obvious how genuinely concernedhe was for his grandson.Nicci turned her eyes downward, unable to look into the hurt in his eyes. “I’msorry, Zedd, but I know of nothing that makes any sense. Unfortunately, I don’tthink that the body he dug up proves anything conclusively or we might have achance to force him to accept the reality of the evidence. On the other hand, Ithink the body he dug up really was the Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell, thewoman that he dreamed he had a relationship with while in his confused state ofpain when he was injured.“He probably heard the name somewhere when he first traveled to the Midlands andit just stuck in his mind. It was probably a nice fantasy. For someone who grewup to be a woods guide, I think it would be a natural enough daydream, likeimagining that he might one day go off to a strange land and marry a queen, butthen it turned into a dream while he was hurt, and then into an obsession.”Nicci had to make herself stop. It hurt to the bone to say such things to otherpeople about Richard, even if those other people also loved and cared about himand wanted to help him. Even Ann, as much as Nicci often thought the woman hadulterior motives, really did care a great deal about Richard. He was a man Annbelieved was necessary to fulfil prophecy, but she still felt warmly toward himas an individual.Nicci knew she was doing the right thing in what she said about Richard, but itstill made her feel like she was betraying him. She could see his face in hermind, watching, silently hurt that she would be so coldly unbelieving.“We think that, whatever the cause of his false belief,” Ann said, “Richardneeds to be brought back to reality.”Nicci didn’t say anything. While she thought they were right, she didn’t knowthat there was anything that could be done, other than letting him, as time wenton, arrive at the truth on his own.Nathan took a step forward and smiled down at Nicci. In the small room he seemedeven more imposing. But it was his dark azure eyes that were so riveting. Hespread his hands in a gesture of open appeal.“Sometimes it hurts a person to help them, but later they see how it was theonly way, and then, when they are finally well, they’re happy that you did ashad to be done.”“Like setting a broken arm,” Ann offered, nodding to Nathan’s words. “No onewants to go through the pain of having that done, but sometimes such things arenecessary if they are to be well and have their life back.”“So,” Nicci asked with a frown, “you want to heal him?”“That’s right,” Zedd told her. He smiled, then. “I found a prophecy aboutRichard that says They will at first contest him before they plot to heal him. Inever thought it would come to pass so soon or in quite this manner, but I thinkwe all agree that we love Richard and want him well and back with us ashimself.”Nicci thought that there must be more to this than what any of them were saying.She began to wonder why they had sent Rikka off for tea—why, exactly, they wouldnot want the Lord Rahl’s bodyguard around.“I told you, I’m not exactly a healer.”“You did quite a good job of healing him when he was shot with that arrow,” Zeddsaid. “Even I could not have accomplished such a feat. None of us in this room,other than you, Nicci, could have accomplished such a thing. You may not thinkyou are much of a healer, but you were able to do what would have beenimpossible for any of us.”“Well, I was only successful because I used Subtractive Magic.”No one said anything. They all just stared at her.“Wait a minute,” Nicci said, looking from one person to the next, “are yousuggesting that I again somehow use Subtractive Magic on Richard?”“That’s exactly what we’re suggesting,” Zedd told her.Ann flicked a hand out toward Zedd and Nathan. “If one of us could do it, wewould, but we can’t. We need you to do it.”Nicci folded her arms. “Do what, exactly? I don’t understand what it is youexpect me to do.”Ann laid the hand on Nicci’s arm. “Nicci, listen to us. We don’t know what iscausing Richard’s malady. We have no way of trying to cure something when wedon’t know what it is. Even if we knew for sure that it was a glamour spell thathad tainted that arrow, short the one who cast such a web, or absent the arrow,none of the three of us could eliminate the spell.“But we can’t be certain it was such a spell, or an entirely different kind ofspell, or if it’s simply delirium brought on by the injury. We don’t know thecause. We may never know.“What must be done, now,” she said in a serious manner that no longer tried tobe anything but straightforward and honest, “is to eliminate theobsession—whatever its origin. It doesn’t matter if it was brought about by aspell, a dream, or by some sudden onset of insanity. The memory of this woman,Kahlan, is a false memory that is distorting his thinking and therefore must beeliminated from his mind.”Nicci was stupefied by what she was hearing. She looked from the former prelateto Zedd. “Are you seriously suggesting that I use Subtractive Magic on yourgrandson’s mind? You want me to eliminate a part of his consciousness? A part ofwho he is?”“No, not part of who he is—never. I would never want that.” Zedd licked his thinlips. His voice came out sounding helpless and despairing. “I want you to healhim. I want Richard back, the Richard I know, the Richard we all know—the realRichard, not the Richard with these foreign notions taking over his mind anddestroying him.”Nicci shook her head. “I can’t do that to the man I—” She closed her mouthbefore she finished the sentence.“I would have back the Richard I love,” Zedd said in soft supplication. “TheRichard we all love.”Nicci backed away a step, shaking her head, unable to think of what to say tosuch desperation. There had to be another way to bring Richard to his senses.“Show her,” Nathan said to Ann, his voice suddenly sounding very much like thetowering prophet he was, the Rahl he was.Ann nodded in resignation and pulled something from her pocket. She held it outto Nicci. “Read this.”When Ann dropped it into Nicci’s hand, she saw that it was a journey book. Shelooked up at Nathan, Ann, and finally Zedd.“Go on,” the prophet said. “Read the message Ann received from Verna.”Journey books were incredibly rare. In fact, Nicci had thought they had all beendestroyed at the Palace of the Prophets. She knew that what was written in oneof the matched pair of twinned books would appear in the other. The stylus keptin the spine that was used to write in the book was also used to wipe away oldmessages. In that way the journey books never wore out or became obsolete. Nicciopened the invaluable product of ancient magic and turned to the writing.Ann, it began in a clear hand, I fear to report that things are not going wellwith our forces. Where is Richard? Have you found him yet? I apologize forpressing you yet again for I know you are traveling with all due haste, but theproblems with the army grow more serious every day. Men have deserted—not agreat many, mind you—but we are in D’Hara now, and the whispers are growing thatLord Rahl will not lead them in a battle that they all believe will be suicide.Richard’s continuing absence only confirms this fear for them. Day by day theygrow to feel they have been abandoned by their Lord Rahl. None of the menbelieve that they have a chance against the enemy if Richard is not with his owntroops to lead them.General Meiffert and I grow more desperate by the day as to what to telldisheartened men. Even if there was a good reason, it is still difficult enoughfor men knowing they face death not to have word from the first leader in theirlives whom they truly believed in.Please, Ann, as soon as you reach Richard, tell him how much all these braveyoung men, who have borne the brunt of defending our cause for so long and havesuffered so much, need him. Please find out how soon he will join us. Ask him toplease hurry.Urgently awaiting word,Yours in the Light,Verna.The book lowered in Nicci’s hands. Tears stung her eyes.Ann lifted the journey book from Nicci’s trembling fingers. “What would you haveme tell Verna? What would you have her say to the troops?” Ann asked in a quiet,even gentle, tone.Nicci blinked at the tears. “You want me to take away his mind? You want me tobetray him?”“No, not at all,” Zedd assured her, gripping her shoulder in his powerfulfingers. “We want you to help him… to heal him.”“We fear to even approach Richard in his present condition,” Ann said.“We fear he may suspect something. I’m afraid I’m partly responsible for thatbecause of my harsh reaction to his delusions. The Creator forgive me, but Ihave spent my life ruling people’s lives and expecting compliance. Old ways diehard. Now, he thinks I intend to inflexibly force him to follow prophecy. Hegrows increasingly distrustful of us… but not of you.”“He would trust you,” Zedd told her. “You could lay a hand on him and he wouldnot suspect anything.”Nicci stared. “Lay a hand on him… ?”Zedd nodded. “You would have control of him before he ever knew what hadhappened. He won’t feel a thing. When he wakes up, the memory of Kahlan Amnellwill be wiped away and he will be our Richard again.”Nicci bit her lower lip, unable to trust her voice.Zedd’s hazel eyes brimmed with tears. “I love my grandson dearly. I would doanything for him. I would do this myself, if I could do as good a job of it asyou. I want him to be well. We all need him well.”He squeezed her shoulder again. “Nicci, if you love him, too, please, do this.Please do what only you can do and heal him one more time.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 56Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us,” Kahlanmurmured yet again.“In your light we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we arehumbled. We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Her shoulders ached from kneeling on the floor with her forehead against thetiles, saying the devotion over and over. Despite the aching fatigue, she didn’treally mind it.“Master Rahl guide us,” Kahlan said as she started in again in harmony with thejoined voices that echoed softly through the marble halls.“Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In your light we thrive. In yourmercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve.Our lives are yours.”In fact, she found it rather pleasant saying the same words over and over. Theyfilled her mind, helping numb the terrible void. The words made her feel not soalone.So lost.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Some of those concepts struck a cord with her and she found them comforting:safe, thriving lives where knowledge and wisdom prevailed. She liked the imageof that. Such ideas seemed quite the marvelous dream.The others with her had been in a hurry, but when they’d seen the soldiers looktheir way, they had decided that they’d better go with the rest of the peoplecollecting in a square that was open to the overcast sky. Under that cloudy skylay white sand raked in concentric lines around a dark, pitted rock. On the topof the rock sat a bell in a stout frame. This was the bell that had rung andcalled all the people together.Pillars supported arches on all four sides of the opening in the roof of thesquare. On the tile floor among the columns, all around Kahlan, people were ontheir knees, bent forward, with their foreheads touching the tile. In unison,everyone chanted the devotion to the Lord Rahl.Right near the end of the next repetition, the bell atop the dark, pitted rockrang twice. The voices all around Kahlan trailed off as they all finishedtogether with “Our lives are yours.”In the sudden quiet, people rose up on their knees, many of them stretching andyawning before getting to their feet. Conversation welled up again as the peoplebegan moving off, going back to their business, to whatever they had been doingbefore the bell had called them to devotion.When the others with her gestured, Kahlan followed the orders and moved off downthe passageway, away from the open square. They passed statues and anintersection before they angled their way over to one side of the broad hall.The other three stopped. Kahlan stood silently as she waited and watched peoplegoing past.The long climb up endless stairs, down miles of corridors, and up random flightsof yet more stairs, all after the journey to get there in the first place, hadleft her dead on her feet. She would have liked to have sat down, but she knewbetter than to ask. The Sisters didn’t care if she was exhausted. Worse, though,she could tell how tense and edgy they were, especially after the unexpectedinterruption for the chanting. They would not react sympathetically or kindly toa request to sit down.With the mood they were in, if Kahlan even asked, she knew they would not havethe slightest compunctions about beating her. She didn’t think that they woulddo it right there, not with all the people around, but they certainly wouldlater. She stood quietly, trying to be invisible and not draw their ire.She guessed that the kneeling would have to be rest enough; it was all she wasgoing to get.Soldiers in handsome uniforms, carrying a variety of polished weapons at theready, patrolled the halls, watching everyone. Each time guards passed, whetherin pairs or larger groups, their gazes took careful note of the three womenstanding with Kahlan. When that happened, the three Sisters pretended to belooking at statues, or some of the rich tapestries of country scenes. One time,to avoid the attention of passing soldiers, they huddled close, pretending to beoblivious of the soldiers as they pointed out a grand statue of a woman holdinga sheaf of wheat as she leaned on a spear. They smiled as they spoke softlyamong themselves as if enjoying a pleasant discussion of the artistic merits ofthe work until the soldiers had gone on past.“Would you two sit down on that bench,” Sister Ulicia growled. “You look likecats being sniffed by a pack of hounds.”Sisters Tovi and Cecilia, both older, glanced around and saw the bench a fewsteps behind them, up against the white marble wall. They scooped their dressunder their legs as they sat beside each other. Tovi, as heavy as she was,appeared especially weary. Her wrinkled face was red as a beet from kneelingwith her face to the floor. Cecilia, always tidy, used the opportunity providedby sitting on the bench to fuss with her gray hair.Kahlan started for the bench, relieved at last have a chance to sit.“Not you,” Sister Ulicia snapped. “No one is going to notice you. Just standthere beside them so I will be better able to keep an eye on you.”Sister Ulicia lifted an eyebrow in warning.“Yes, Sister Ulicia,” Kahlan said.Sister Ulicia expected an answer when she spoke.Kahlan had learned that lesson the hard way, and would have answered sooner hadshe not stopped really listening after she’d been told that the offer to sitdidn’t include her. She reminded herself that even if she was tired she hadbetter pay more attention or she would earn a slap for now and a lot worselater.Sister Ulicia did not look away, or allow Kahlan to, but instead placed the tipof her stout, oak rod under Kahlan’s chin and used it to forcefully tilt herhead up.“The day is not over, yet. You still have your part to do. You had better noteven think of letting me down in any way. Do you understand?”“Yes, Sister Ulicia.”“Good. We’re all just as tired as you, you know.”Kahlan wanted to say that they may be tired, but they had ridden horses. Kahlanalways had to walk and keep up with their horses. Sometimes she had to trot oreven run to keep from falling behind. Sister Ulicia was never pleased if she hadto turn her horse and go back to collect her lagging slave.Kahlan glanced around the passageway at all the wondrous things displayed. Hercuriosity overcame her caution.“Sister Ulicia, what is this place?”The Sister tapped her rod against her thigh as she briefly took in hersurroundings. “The People’s Palace. Quite the beautiful place.” She looked backat Kahlan. “This is the home of the Lord Rahl.”She waited, apparently to see if Kahlan would say anything. Kahlan had nothingto say. “Lord Rahl?”“You know, the man we’ve been praying to? Richard Rahl, to be precise. He is theLord Rahl now.” Sister Ulicia’s eyes narrowed. “Have you ever heard of him, mydear?”Kahlan thought about it. Lord Rahl. Lord Richard Rahl. Her mind seemed empty.She wanted to think things, to remember, but she couldn’t. She guessed thatthere was simply nothing for her to remember.“No, Sister. I don’t believe I have ever heard of the Lord Rahl.”“Well,” Sister Ulicia said with that sly smile she brought out from time totime, “I don’t suppose you would. After all, who are you? Just a nobody. Anothing. A slave.”Kahlan swallowed back her urge to protest. How could she? What would she say?Sister Ulicia’s smile widened. It seemed her eyes could look right down intoKahlan’s soul. “Isn’t that right, my dear? You are a worthless slave who isfortunate for the charity of a meal.”Kahlan wanted to object, to say that she was more, to say that her life hadvalue and was worthwhile, but she knew that such things were only a dream. Shewas tired to the bone. Now, her heart felt heavy, too.“Yes, Sister Ulicia.”Whenever she tried to think about herself, there was only an empty void. Herlife seemed so barren. She didn’t think it was supposed to be, but it was.Sister Ulicia turned when she noticed Kahlan’s gaze going to the returningSister Armina, a mature woman with a straightforward personality. SisterArmina’s dark blue dress swished as she hurried down the wide corridor in aweaving course to make her way among the people strolling through the palaceengaged in conversation and not watching where they were going.“Well?” Sister Ulicia asked when Sister Armina reached them.“I got caught up in a mass chanting to our Lord Rahl.”Sister Ulicia sighed. “Us, too. What did you find?”“This is the place—just behind me at the next intersection, then down the hallto the right. We need to be careful, though.”“Why?” Sister Ulicia asked as Sisters Tovi and Cecilia hurried close to listen.The four Sisters put their heads closer.“The doors are right there at the side of the hallway. There isn’t any way to goin there without being seen. At least for us. It’s pretty clear that no one issupposed to even think of going in there.”Sister Ulicia glanced up and down the hall to make sure no one was paying themany heed. “What do you mean, it’s pretty clear?”“The doors are made specifically to warn people away. They have snakes carved onthem.”Kahlan shrank back. She hated snakes.Sister Ulicia slapped her rod against her leg as she pressed her lips together.Fuming, she finally turned her sour visage on Kahlan.“You remember your instructions?”“Yes, Sister,” Kahlan answered immediately.She wanted to get it over with. The sooner the Sisters were happy the better. Itwas getting late in the day. The long climb up through the inside of the plateauand then the chanting had taken more time than the Sisters had expected. Theyhad thought they would be finished and on their way by now.Kahlan was hoping that when she was done they could make camp and get somesleep. They never let her get enough sleep. Setting up camp meant more work forher, but at least there was sleeping to look forward to—as long as she didn’tearn the Sisters’ displeasure and a beating.“All right, this actually makes little practical difference. We will just haveto stand off a little farther than we planned, that’s all.” Sister Uliciascratched her cheek as an excuse to take a careful look, checking for guards,before leaning in again. “Cecilia, you stay here and watch this end of the hallfor any sign of trouble. Armina, you go back past the entrance and watch theother side. Start now so that it doesn’t look like we’re together as we near thedoors, in case they’re being watched.”Sister Armina flashed a crafty grin. “I will saunter down the halls and looklike an awed visitor until she’s done.”Without further word, she hurried off.“Tovi,” Sister Ulicia said, “you come with me. We’ll be two friends, walking andchatting while visiting the Lord Rahl’s grand palace. Meanwhile, Kahlan will beseeing to her tasks.”Sister Ulicia snatched Kahlan’s upper arm and spun her around. “Come on.”With a shove, Kahlan was pushed on ahead of them. She hiked her pack up as shewas hurried along. Together, the two Sisters followed her down the hall. As theyreached the intersection where they had to turn right, two big soldiers camearound toward them. They gave Sister Tovi only a passing glance, but they smiledat Sister Ulicia’s smile. Sister Ulicia could appear innocently enchanting whenshe wanted to, and she was attractive enough that men paid her notice.No one noticed Kahlan.“Here,” Sister Ulicia said. “Stop here.”Kahlan halted, staring across the hall at the thick mahogany doors. The snakescarved in the doors stared back at her. Their tails coiled around branchescarved into the tops of the doors. The snakes’ bodies hung down so that theheads were at eye level. Fangs jutted out from gaping jaws, as if the pair wereabout to strike. Kahlan couldn’t imagine why anyone would carve such hideouscreatures in doors. Everything else in the palace was beautiful, but these doorswere not.Sister Ulicia leaned close. “You remember all of your instructions?”Kahlan nodded. “Yes, Sister.”“If you have any questions, ask them now.”“No, Sister. I remember everything you told me.”Kahlan wondered why it was that she could remember some things so well, but somany other things seemed lost in a fog.“And don’t dawdle,” Tovi said.“No, Sister Tovi, I won’t.”“We need what you’re being sent to recover for us, and we need it without anyfoolishness.” Malevolence gleamed in Tovi’s eyes. “Do you understand, girl?”Kahlan swallowed. “Yes, Sister Tovi.”“You’d better,” Tovi said, “Or you’ll answer to me and you would not want that,believe me.”“I understand, Sister Tovi.”Kahlan knew that Tovi was deadly serious. The woman was usually relatively eventempered, but when provoked she could turn vicious in a flash. Worse, once shestarted in, she enjoyed seeing others helpless and in agony.“Go on then,” Sister Ulicia said. “And don’t forget, don’t talk to anyone. Ifthe men up there say anything, just ignore them. They will leave you be.”The look in Sister Ulicia’s eyes gave Kahlan pause. She nodded before hurryingoff across the hall. Her exhaustion forgotten, she knew what she had to do, andshe knew that if she didn’t there would be trouble.At the doors she grasped one of the handles that looked like a grinning skull,only made of bronze. She deliberately didn’t look at the snakes as she put hermuscle into pulling open the heavy door.Inside, she paused, letting her eyes adjust to the dim light of lamps. The thickcarpets of golds and blues quieted the room and prevented any of the echoes likethere were in so many of the halls. The intimate room, paneled in the samemahogany as the tall doors, seemed a quiet refuge from the sometimes noisypalace.With the door closed behind her, she realized that she was finally, totally awayfrom the four Sisters. She couldn’t remember a time when she had ever been alonefrom them. At least one of the Sisters was always watching her, watching theirslave. She didn’t know why they watched her so closely, after all, Kahlan hadnever actually tried to escape. She had often used to seriously consider it, butshe had never actually gotten to the point of trying it.Just the thought of trying to escape from the Sisters brought on such terriblepain that it made her feel like blood would run from her ears and nose and thather eyes would surely burst. When she thought of leaving the Sisters and thepain closed in to bear down on her, she couldn’t get the thought out of her headfast enough, and even then the pain lingered. Such an episode usually left herso sick to her stomach that it was hours before she could even stand, much lesswalk.The Sisters always knew when it happened, probably because they found her in aheap on the ground. When the pain in her head finally faded, they beat her. Theworst was Sister Ulicia because she used the stout stick she always carried. Itleft welts that were slow to heal. Some still had not healed.This time, though, they had ordered Kahlan to leave them and go in alone. Theyhad told her that it would not bring on the pain so long as she kept to herinstructions. It felt so good to be away from those four terrible women thatKahlan thought she might cry with joy.Inside the room, though, were four big guards to replace the four Sisters. Shepaused, unsure what to do.Serpents on one side of a door with serpents carved on it, and serpents on theother. She seemed never to be able to find any peace.Kahlan stood frozen for a moment, afraid to try to go past the guards, afraid ofwhat they might do to her for being in a place that she so obviously did notbelong.They were staring at her in a most curious way.Kahlan gathered her courage, hooked some of her long hair behind an ear, andstarted for the stairwell she saw across the room.Two guards stepped together to block her way. “Where do you think you’re going?”one of them asked her.Kahlan kept her head down and kept moving. She turned a little sideways to beable to slip between them.As she went past, the second guard said to the first “What did you say?”The first man, who had asked Kahlan where she thought she was going, stared athim.“What? I didn’t say anything.”As Kahlan made it to the stairs, the other two guards strolled over to the oneswho had tried to block Kahlan’s path.“What are you two babbling about?” one of them asked.The first waved a hand. “Nothing. It’s nothing.”Kahlan hurried up the steps as fast as her tired legs would carry her. Shepaused on the broad landing to catch her breath, but she knew she dared not restfor long. She grabbed the polished stone handrail and hurried on up the rest ofthe way.A soldier at the top immediately turned to the sound of her footsteps. He staredat her as she climbed up into the hallway. She rushed past him. He paused onlybriefly before turning and ambling off to continue his patrol.There were other men in the hall—soldiers. Soldiers everywhere. Lord Rahl had alot of soldiers, all of them huge, intent looking men.Kahlan swallowed in wide-eyed fright at seeing so many soldiers in the way ofwhat she had been told to do. If they slowed her, Sister Ulicia would not beunderstanding nor forgiving. Some of the soldiers saw Kahlan and started herway, but when they reached her they lost their intent gazes and walked right by.As Kahlan hurried along the hall, other guards turned urgently to officers, butthen, when questioned, said that it was nothing, and to forget it. Other menlifted an arm to point, only to then let the arm drop before continuing on theirway.As the men saw her and at the same time forgot her, Kahlan steadily made her waydown the hall toward where she had been told she had to go. It concerned her,though, that so many of the men were carrying crossbows. The men with thecrossbows wore black gloves. Their cocked weapons were loaded withdeadly-looking red-fletched arrows.Sister Ulicia had told Kahlan that as part of the magic that brought on the painto prevent her from escaping, she was shrouded by webs of magic that kept peoplefrom noticing her. Kahlan tried to think of why the Sister would do such athing, but her thoughts simply would not connect, would not link together intounderstanding. It was the most ghastly thing, not being able to make herselfthink about specific things when she wanted to. She would start out with thequestion, then the answer would begin to form, but simply run out as if therewas nothing more there.Despite the conjured shroud around her, though, Kahlan knew that if one of thesoldiers pointed his crossbow at her and pulled the bolt release before heforgot her, she would be dead.She wouldn’t mind being dead because it would at least mean being freed of theanguish that was her life, but Sister Ulicia had warned her that the Sisters hadgreat influence with the Keeper of the dead. Sister Ulicia said that if Kahlanever thought to slip away from her duties to them by slipping the bounds of theworld of the living and taking the long journey into the world of the dead, shewould find that it was no refuge and in fact would prove to be a far worseplace. It was then that Sister Ulicia had told Kahlan that they were Sisters ofthe Dark, as if to drive home the veracity of the warning.Kahlan hadn’t really needed the assurance; she had always been sure that any ofthe four Sisters could chase her down any hole and get her, even if that holewas a grave like the one they’d opened one dark night for reasons Kahlancouldn’t even imagine and didn’t want to know.Looking into the Sister’s terrible eyes, Kahlan had known that she was hearingthe truth. After that, while death invited her with release, it also terrifiedher with dark promises.She didn’t know if this had always been her life, the life of chattel belongingto others. No matter how hard she tried, though, she could remember no other.As she slipped by men patrolling, she made her way through a series ofintersections that Sister Ulicia had drawn in the dirt for her at various campsas they traveled. The Sister had used her oak rod to diagram the halls so thatKahlan would know where she had to go.As she moved through those halls she had memorized, no one ever tried to stopher. In a way, it was depressing that the men paid her no heed.It was the same everywhere, though, no one ever noticed her, or if they did,they immediately disregarded her and went back to their own business. She was aslave, without her own life. She belonged to others. It made her feel invisible,insignificant, unimportant. A nobody.Sometimes, like when making the long underground climb up into the palace,Kahlan would see men and women together, smiling, an arm around each other,touching one another. She tried to imagine what that would feel like—to havesomeone care about her, cherish her… to cherish them.Kahlan swiped a tear off her cheek. She knew she would never have that. Slavesdid not have a life of their own, they were used for their master’s purposes;Sister Ulicia had made that very clear. One day, when Sister Ulicia had gottenthat vicious look in her eyes that she sometimes got, she said that she wasthinking of having Kahlan bred so that she could produce them an offspring.But how did it come to be this way? Where had she come from? Surely, everyone’spast didn’t evaporate out of their minds the way Kahlan’s had.In the fog of her thoughts, she couldn’t make her mind work the problem through.She asked the questions, but the concepts seemed to be soaked up into a dim hazeof nothingness. She hated the way she couldn’t think. Why could other peoplethink while she could not? Even that question quickly faded away intoirrelevance among the mire of twisting shadows, just the way she faded away whenpeople saw her.Kahlan stopped when she arrived at a pair of huge doors covered in gold. Thedoors looked like Sister Ulicia had said they would—a scene of rolling hills andforests all sheathed in gold. Kahlan looked both ways, then put all her weightinto the task of pulling one of the massive doors open enough to slip inside.She took a last look, but none of the guards were watching her. She pulled thedoor closed behind herself.It was much brighter inside than the hallway had been. Even though it was anovercast day the skylights let in a flood of light that lit a most astonishinggarden. Sister Ulicia had told her about the garden, in general terms, but forKahlan to see it, up here in the palace, was beyond anything she had imagined.The place was wondrous.Richard Rahl was a lucky man to have such a garden that he could visit any timehe wanted. She wondered if he would come and visit while she was in there, andsee her… and then forget her.Remembering her task, Kahlan admonished herself to keep her mind on what she hadbeen sent to do. She hurried down one of the paths through a sprawl of flowerbeds. The ground was littered with fallen red and yellow petals. She wondered ifRichard Rahl picked flowers here for his lady love.She liked the sound of his name. It had a comforting ring to it. Richard Rahl.Richard. She wondered what he was like, if he was as pleasant as his name was toher ear.As she made her way along the path, Kahlan gazed up at the small trees growingall about her. She loved the trees. They reminded her of… of something. Shegrowled in frustration. She hated it when she couldn’t remember things that shewas sure were important. Even if they weren’t important, she hated forgettingthings. It was like forgetting parts of who she was.She hurried past shrubs and vine-covered stone walls until she reached thegrassy place that Sister Ulicia said would be there in the center of the garden.Across the way the grassy ring was broken by a wedge of stone atop which sat aslab of granite, looking much like a table.Atop the granite slab were supposed to be the things Kahlan had been sent toretrieve. Seeing them suddenly, she quailed. The three objects were as black asdeath itself. They looked as if they were sucking in the light from the room,from the skylights, from the very sky, and trying to swallow it all.Her heart hammering with dread, Kahlan rushed across the grass to the granitetable. Being that close to such sinister looking objects made her nervous. Sheslipped the shoulder straps off and set the pack down beside the black boxes shehad been sent to recover. Her bedroll, lashed underneath, made the pack not wantto sit up, so she had to lean it a little to the side.She laid her hand on the bedroll for a moment, feeling the soft contour of whatwas rolled up inside. It was her most precious possession.She remembered, then, that she had better get back to business. She immediatelyrealized, though, that she was going to have a problem. The boxes were biggerthan Sister Ulicia had said she thought they would be. They each were nearly asbig as a loaf of bread. There was no way they would all fit in her pack.But those had been her explicit instructions. The wishes of the Sistersconflicted with the reality that the boxes weren’t going to fit. There was noway to satisfy the contradiction.Memories of previous punishments flashed through her mind, bringing a sheen ofsweat to her brow. She wiped the sweat from her eyes as the visions of torturecame back to her. This, of all things, she cursed silently, she had to remember.Kahlan decided that there was nothing else she could do; she would have to try.At the same time, she also fretted about stealing things out of Lord Rahl’sgarden. After all, they didn’t belong to the Sisters, and Lord Rahl would nothave that many men posted all around the garden unless the boxes were importantto him.She was no thief. But was it worth the kind of punishment she would receiveshould she refuse? Was her blood worth Lord Rahl’s treasure? Was Lord Rahl thekind of man who would want her to refuse to steal and as a result suffer theSisters’ torture?She didn’t know why, and maybe she was only coddling her doubts, but she toldherself that Richard Rahl would say to take the boxes rather than sacrifice herlife.She flipped open the top of her pack and attempted to shove things down intighter, but there was very little give. They were already packed as tightly asthey were ever going to pack.With rising worry that she was taking too much time, she pulled on clothes,trying to get something to wrap the first black box in.Out came part of her satiny white dress.Kahlan stared at the silken, nearly white material in her fingers. It was themost beautiful dress she had ever seen. But why would she have it? She was anobody. A slave. What would a slave be doing with such a beautiful dress? Shecouldn’t make her mind work to answer such a question.The thoughts simply would not come together into answers.Kahlan snatched up one of the boxes and rolled it up in the skirt of the dressand stuffed it all into the pack. She leaned on the box, trying to shove it downdeeper, then closed the flap to test the fit. The flap hardly covered the top ofthe box and she only had one of them inside. She had to cinch the flap down withthe strap just to get it to stay. There was no way in the world that the otherboxes were going to fit in her pack.Sister Ulicia had been very explicit that Kahlan had to hide the boxes in herpack or the soldiers would see them. They would forget Kahlan, but Sister Uliciahad said that the soldiers would recognize the boxes Kahlan was taking out ofthe garden room and then they would send up alarms. Kahlan had been told in nouncertain terms that she had to hide the boxes. But she could see that there wasno way all three would fit.Around the camp fire a few nights before, Sister Ulicia had put her face rightup close to Kahlan’s and whispered exactly what she would do to Kahlan shouldshe fail to do as instructed.Kahlan started trembling at the memory of what Sister Ulicia had told her thatterrible night. She thought of Sister Tovi and trembled all the more.What was she going to do?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 57Kahlan pushed open one of the doors with the snakes on the other side of it.Sisters Ulicia and Tovi immediately spotted her and with furtive gesturesmotioned for her to come to where they waited down the hall. They didn’t want tobe seen near the doors with the snakes and the skulls.Kahlan crossed the hallway, watching the patterns in the marble floor, notwanting to look up into Sister Ulicia’s eyes.As soon as she had walked down the corridor and was close enough, Sister Uliciasnatched Kahlan’s shirt at her shoulder and pulled her over to a niche in thefar wall. Both Sisters Ulicia and Tovi caged her in.“Did anyone try to stop you?” Sister Tovi asked.Kahlan shook her head.Sister Ulicia let out a sigh. “Good. Let’s see them.”Kahlan drew the pack off one shoulder and pulled it around enough in front sothat the sisters could open the flap. Both of them pawed at the strap cinchingit down. They finally got it loose and flipped it back.Both Sisters huddled close together, shoulder to shoulder, so that people in thehall couldn’t see what they were doing, see what terrible thing they were aboutto bring out into the light of day. Sister Ulicia carefully pulled off thesatiny white fabric of Kahlan’s dress still stuffed partly down into the pack tosee the black box nestled within.Both stood in silent awe, staring.Sister Ulicia, her fingers trembling with excitement, stuck her arm down in andstarted pawing around, searching for the others. When she didn’t find them shestepped back, a dark look coming over her face.“Where are the other two?”Kahlan swallowed. “I could only fit one into the pack, Sister. The otherswouldn’t fit. You told me that I had to conceal them inside, but they were toobig. I will—”Before Kahlan could say another word, before she explained that she planned tomake two more trips to recover the other boxes, Sister Ulicia, in a rage,whipped her stout rod around so hard that it whistled through the air.Kahlan heard a deafening crack as it hit the side of her head with full force.The world seemed to go silent and black.Kahlan realized that she was on the floor in a heap, crumpled on her knees. Shecupped a hand over her left ear, gasping in paralyzing pain. She saw bloodsplattered all over the floor. She took her hand away and saw that it lookedlike she was wearing a warm, bloody glove.She could only stare at her hand and pant in little gasps. So crushing was thepain that her voice wouldn’t work. She couldn’t even cry out in agony. It seemedas if she were looking through a long, fuzzy, black tunnel. Her stomach feltqueasy.Suddenly, Sister Ulicia seized Kahlan’s shirt and hoisted her up from the flooronly to slam her against the wall. Kahlan’s head smacked the stone, but comparedto the pain radiating from the side of her head, her jaw, and her ear, it seemedinconsequential.“You stupid bitch!” Sister Ulicia railed as she pulled Kahlan away and againslammed her against the wall. “You stupid, incompetent, worthless bitch!”Tovi looked like she, too, wanted to get her hands on Kahlan. She saw that downthe corridor half of Sister Ulicia’s broken rod lay against the wall. Kahlanstruggled to find her voice, knowing it was her only salvation.“Sister Ulicia, I couldn’t fit all three inside.” Kahlan could taste salty tearsalong with blood. “You told me to hide them in my pack. They wouldn’t fit. Iplanned to go back and get them, that’s all. Please—I’ll go back for the others.I swear, I will get them for you.”Sister Ulicia backed away, the smoldering anger in her eyes was frightening.Even though the woman backed away, she pointed at the center of Kahlan’s chestwith one finger and Kahlan was slammed hard against the marble and pinned to thewall with a force that felt as massive as a bull leaning against her. It was astruggle to draw each breath against the crushing pressure. It was a struggle tosee through the blood running into her eyes.“You should have rolled the other two boxes in your bedroll, then you would havethem all right now. Isn’t that right?”Kahlan hadn’t considered doing that because it wasn’t an option.“But Sister, I have something else rolled in the bedroll.”Sister Ulicia leaned in again. Kahlan feared that she was now going to be madeto wish she was dead, or fear that she was about to be. She wasn’t at all surewhich fate would be worse. She felt the pain come on within her head to matchthe pain on the outside from the blow. Pinned against the wall, Kahlan couldn’tfall to the ground, cover her ears, and scream, or she would have.“I don’t care what trifle you have rolled up in your bedroll. You should haveleft it out. The boxes are more important.”Kahlan could only stare, unable to move because of the force keeping herflattened to the wall, and unable to talk because of the force of pain crushingher mind. It felt like ice picks were being slowly shoved and twisted into herears. Her ankles and wrists twitched involuntarily. She gasped with eachthrobbing wave of agony wrenching through her head, trying, but unable to squirmaway from the piercing pain.“Now,” Sister Ulicia said in a low, menacing voice that carried deadly threat,“do you think you can do that? Do you think you can go back up there and rollthe other two boxes in your bedroll and bring them back to me like you shouldhave done in the first place?”Kahlan tried to talk, but couldn’t. She nodded instead, desperate to agree,desperate for the pain to stop. She could feel the blood running from her earand the side of her head soaking the collar of her shirt. She was on hertiptoes, pressed back, wishing she could melt through the wall in order to getaway from Sister Ulicia. The pain wouldn’t let up enough for her to catch abreath.“Do you remember seeing some of the hundreds and hundreds of big, lonelysoldiers quartered down in the lower reaches of this place as we were comingup?” Sister Ulicia asked.Kahlan nodded again.“Well, if you fail me again, then, when I’m done breaking every bone in yourbody and making you suffer the agony of a thousand deaths, I’m then going toheal you enough so that I can sell you to those soldiers down there to be theirbarracks whore. That will be where you spend the rest of your life, being passedfrom one stranger to another with no one to care what happens to you.”Kahlan knew that Sister Ulicia never made empty threats. The Sister wasabsolutely ruthless. Kahlan averted her eyes as she sucked back a sob, unable tostand the Sister’s scrutiny any longer.CHAINFIRE 581Sister Ulicia seized Kahlan’s jaw and turned her face back. “Are you certainthat you understand the price should you fail me again?”Kahlan, her chin held firm, managed to nod.She felt the pressure pinning her to the wall suddenly release. She collapsed toher knees, gasping with the waves of searing pain all along the left side of herface. She didn’t know if any bones were broken, but it certainly felt like it.“What’s going on here?” A soldier asked.Sisters Ulicia and Tovi turned and smiled at the man. He glanced down at Kahlan,frowning. She stared up pleadingly at him, hoping to be rescued from thesemonsters. The man looked up, his mouth open, about to say something to theSisters, but then he never did. He looked from Sister Ulicia’s smile to Tovi’s,and smiled himself.“Is everything all right, ladies?”“Oh, yes,” Sister Tovi said with a jovial chuckle. “We were just about to have arest on the bench, here. I was complaining about my backache, that’s all. Wewere both saying what a nuisance it is to get older.”“I guess it is.” He bowed his head. “Good day, then, ladies.”He walked off without ever acknowledging Kahlan’s existence. If he saw her, heforgot about her before he could say anything. Kahlan realized that it was theway she, too, seemed to forget things about herself.“Get up,” the voice over her growled.Kahlan struggled to her feet. Sister Ulicia jerked Kahlan’s pack around in frontagain. She flipped back the flap and dragged out the sinister black box wrappedin Kahlan’s satiny white dress.She handed the bundle to Sister Tovi. “We’ve already been here too long. We’restarting to draw attention. Take this and get going.”“But that’s mine!” Kahlan cried out as she grabbed for the dress.Sister Ulicia backhanded her hard enough to make her teeth slam together. Theblow knocked her sprawling. Lying on her side on the floor, Kahlan drew her legsup as she cradled her head in agony. Blood was smeared all over the marble. Sheshook as the pain bore down and would not let up.“You want me to leave without you?” Sister Tovi asked as she tucked the boxwrapped in the white dress under her arm.“I think it would be best. It will be safest if we get this box on its way whilethis worthless bitch goes back to get the others. If it takes as long as thefirst one, I’d just as soon not have us both standing around here in the hallwaiting for soldiers to decide to have a look. We don’t need a battle; we needto slip away without a trace.”“If we were questioned it wouldn’t do to have them find we had one of the boxesof Orden,” Sister Tovi agreed. “I should just start out, then, and wait for yousomewhere? Or keep going until I reach our destination?”“You’d best not stop for now.” Sister Ulicia motioned Kahlan to her feet as shespoke to Sister Tovi. “Sisters Cecilia, Armina, and I will meet back up with youonce we get to where we’re going.”Sister Tovi leaned a little toward Kahlan as Kahlan staggered to her feet. “Iguess that gives you a few days to think about what I’m going to do to you whenthe rest of you join up with me again, doesn’t it?”Kahlan could manage only a whisper. “Yes, Sister.”“Swift journey,” Sister Ulicia said.After Sister Tovi had rushed off down the wall, taking Kahlan’s beautiful dresswith her, Sister Ulicia seized a fistful of Kahlan’s hair and twisted her headclose. The Sister’s fingers groped along the side of Kahlan’s face, making hercry out.“You have broken bones,” she announced after her examination of Kahlan’sinjuries. “Complete your mission and I will heal you. Fail, and it will only bethe beginning.“The other Sister and I have a number of other things we must do before ourgoals are accomplished. So do you. If you complete your task today you will behealed. We would like you to be healthy for those future duties”—Sister Uliciapatted Kahlan’s cheek in a patronizing manner—”but I can always make otherarrangements should you fail in this one. Now, hurry up and get me the other twoboxes.”She had no choice, of course. As much pain as she was in, she knew that if shedidn’t comply, and soon, then it was only going to be worse for her. SisterUlicia had shown her that there was always more pain just waiting to be applied.Kahlan knew, too, that there was no escape from the Sisters.Kahlan wished she could forget the pain like she seemed to have forgotten therest of her life. It seemed that only the bad parts of her existence remained inthe dark vaults of her memory.With her breath catching on the ragged edge of tears from the throbbing hurt,she pulled her pack back around, slipped her arm through the strap, and hikedthe whole thing up on her back.“And you had better do as I said and bring them both,” Sister Ulicia growled.Kahlan nodded and rushed off across the broad corridor. Everyone ignored her. Itwas as if she were invisible. The few people who did look her way only seemed tosee her for a fleeting moment, before they, too, forgot that they had evernoticed her.Kahlan grabbed the bronze skull in both hands and pulled open one of the snakedoors. She raced across the plush carpets and was past the guards before theycould think to wonder what they had seen. She dashed up the stairs, ignoringsoldiers patrolling the halls, some of whom briefly turned her way, as if tryingto hold the image of her in their memories, before losing their mental grip ofher and going on about their duties. Kahlan felt like a ghost among the living;there, but not.She grunted with the effort of pulling open one of the gold-clad doors enough toslip inside the garden. She was in so much pain that she could not rush fastenough. She just wanted to get back and have the Sister make the hurt stop. Asbefore, the garden was as quiet as a sanctuary should be. She had no time tonotice or enjoy the flowers and trees. She paused on the grass, staring at thetwo black boxes sitting on the stone slab, momentarily immobilized by the sightof them, and by the thought of what she had been told to do.More slowly, she closed the rest of the distance, not wanting to ever get there,not wanting to ever have to do what she knew she must. But the agony of thetwisting, throbbing pain all along the side of her head drove her on.Standing before the slab, she finally slipped off her pack and set it downbeside the boxes on its back, rather than its bottom. She wiped her runny noseon the back of her sleeve. Gently, she caressed the side of her face, fearing totouch it and make it hurt worse, but at the same time aching to comfort thethrobbing pain. She almost fainted when she felt something jagged sticking out.She didn’t know if it was a splinter from Sister Ulicia’s broken oak rod, or ifit was a splinter of bone. Either way, she felt light-headed and thought shemight vomit.Knowing she had little time, she crossed one arm across her stomach and with theother hand began untying the leather thongs holding her bedroll to the bottom ofher pack. Her fingers were slick with blood, making the task of untying theknots more difficult. She finally had to resort to using both hands. When she atlast had them undone, she carefully unfurled her bedroll and took out what layinside, setting it on the stone slab so as to make room for the loathsome blackboxes. She sucked in a sob, trying not to think of what she was leaving behind.Kahlan forced herself to set to work wrapping the two remaining boxes in herbedroll. When she was finished, she laced up the thongs, securely fastening themto insure that the boxes would not fall out. At last finished, she swung thepack onto her back again and reluctantly started across the open area of bareground in the center of the immense indoor garden.As she crossed the ring of grass, she paused and turned, looking back throughher watery vision at what she was leaving on the stone slab in place of theboxes.It was the most precious thing she had.And now she was leaving it behind.Overwhelmed and unable to go on, feeling more hopeless and helpless than shecould ever remember feeling, Kahlan sank to her knees in the grass.She crumpled forward as she broke down sobbing. She hated her life. She hatedliving. The thing she loved most was being left behind because of those evilwomen.Kahlan wept uncontrollably, gripping the shaggy grass in her fists. She didn’twant to leave it. But if she didn’t, Sister Ulicia would never let her get awaywith violating such a direct order. Kahlan sobbed at how sorry she felt forherself, for her helpless situation.No one but the Sisters knew her, or even knew that she existed.If only just one person would remember her.If only the Lord Rahl would come to his garden and save her.If only, if only, if only. What good was wishing?She pushed herself up then and, sitting back on her heels, stared off throughthe tears at the granite slab, at what she had left standing there.No one was going to save her.She didn’t used to be this way. She didn’t know how she knew that, but she knew.Somewhere in her dim, vanished past, it seemed like she used to be able todepend on herself, on her own strength, to survive. She didn’t used to waste hertime lamenting “If only.”Staring across the garden, Lord Rahl’s beautiful, peaceful garden, she drewstrength from what she saw standing there now, and, at the same time, fromsomewhere deep inside herself. She had to do that now—be resolute, as she wassure she used to be. She had to somehow be strong for herself, for her own sake.Kahlan somehow had to save herself.What stood there now was no longer hers. It would be her gift to Richard Rahl inexchange for the nobility of life—her life—that she had remembered in hisgarden.“Master Rahl guide us,” she quoted from the devotion. “Thank you, Master Rahl,for guiding me this day, for guiding me back to what I mean to myself.”She swiped the backs of her wrists across her eyes, wiping away the tears andblood. She had to be strong or the Sisters would defeat her. They would takeeverything from her. Then they would win.Kahlan couldn’t let them do that.She remembered then, and touched the necklace she wore. She turned the smallstone between a finger and thumb. This, at least, was still hers. She still hadthe necklace.Kahlan struggled to her feet and straightened under the weight of the pack. Shefirst had to get back so that Sister Ulicia would at least heal the injury shehad inflicted. Kahlan would willingly take that help because she would then beable to go on and find a way to succeed.With a last look back, she finally turned and headed for the door.She knew now that she couldn’t surrender her will to them, to their belief thatthey had a right to her life. They might defeat her, but it couldn’t be becauseshe allowed it.But even if she lost her life in the end, she knew now that they would notdefeat her spirit."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 58Richard slowly paced the small room, deep in thought, going over the memory ofthe morning Kahlan had disappeared. He had to figure it out, and soon—for morereasons than one. The most important of those reasons, of course, was to helpKahlan. He had to believe that he still could help her, that she was still aliveand there was still time.He was the only one who knew her, who believed in her existence. There was noone but him to help her.There were also the implications of the wider concerns that her disappearanceengendered. There was no telling how far-reaching those problems could turn outto be. In that, too, he was the only one opposing what hidden designs lurkedbehind events.Since it seemed Kahlan had so far not been able to escape her captors, thatmeant she couldn’t and was going to need help. With the beast seemingly able tostrike again at any time, Richard was painfully aware of how easily he could dieat any moment, and if he did, then the one person who was her connection to theworld would be gone.He had to use every minute of what time he had available to work toward helpingher. He couldn’t even bother wasting time reprimanding himself for all the dayshe had already let slip through his fingers.It had all started that morning, not long before he’d been shot with the arrow,so he had decided to concentrate on that single event and to start anew. He hadpushed the enormity of the problem from his mind in order to narrow his focus onthe solution. He would never come to understand who had Kahlan by pulling outhis hair and agonizing over the fact that someone had her, or by trying toconvince others that she existed. None of that had accomplished anything, norwould it.He had even set aside the books, Gegendrauss and Ordenic Theory, that he’ddiscovered in the little room. The first was in High D’Haran. It had been a longtime since he had worked with the ancient language, so he knew he couldn’tafford to spend time on it. A brief examination had told him that the book mighthold remarkable information, although he hadn’t spotted any that was material.Besides, he was out of practice translating High D’Haran. He didn’t have time towork on it until he first resolved other issues.The second book was difficult to follow, especially with his mind elsewhere, buthe had read just enough of the beginning to realize that the book was indeedabout the boxes of Orden. Other than The Book of Counted Shadows, which he hadmemorized as a child, he didn’t recall ever seeing another book about the boxesof Orden. That alone, to say nothing of the profound danger of the boxesthemselves, told him that the book was of immeasurable valuable. But the boxeswere not his problem at the moment. Kahlan was the problem. He’d set that bookaside as well.There were also other books in the small, shielded room, but he had not had thetime or inclination to search through them. He had decided that devoting himselfto the books before he had a true understanding of what was going on would onlywaste yet more time. He had to approach the problem in a logical manner, not inrandom, frantic attempts to somehow pluck an answer out of thin air.Whatever the cause of Kahlan’s disappearance, it had all started that morningjust before the fight when he’d been shot with the arrow. When Richard hadclimbed into his bedroll the night before the battle, Kahlan had been with him.He knew she had. He remembered holding her in his arms. He remembered her kiss,her smile in the dark. He was not imagining it.No one would believe him, but he was not dreaming up Kahlan.He put that part of the problem aside as well. He couldn’t concern himselfanymore with trying to convince others. Doing so was only diverting hisattention from the real nature of the problem.Nor could he afford to give in to fear that others might be right that he wasonly imagining her; that, too, was a dangerous distraction. He reminded himselfof the very real evidence: the issue of her tracks.Even if he couldn’t make others understand the lifetime of learning that wentinto understanding the meaning of what he saw when he looked at tracks, he knewfor certain what the evidence on the ground had revealed to him. There was alanguage to tracks. Others may not understand that language, but Richard did.Kahlan’s tracks had been swept away, undoubtedly with magic, leaving behind aforest floor too artificially perfect and, more importantly, the rock that he’ddiscovered kicked out of place. That rock told him he was right. Told him thathe was not imagining things.He had to reason out what had happened to Kahlan—and that meant how had she beentaken. Whoever had done it had magic, that much he knew. He at least knew thatmuch because of the way their tracks had been altered. Knowing that narrowed thepossibilities of who could be responsible. It had to be someone with magic sentby Jagang.Richard remembered waking from a dead sleep that morning and laying there on hisside. He remembered not being able to open his eyes for more than a brief momentat a time and not being able to lift his head. Why? He didn’t think it wasbecause he was groggy from still being half asleep; it had been moreoverwhelming than that. It had felt like sleepiness, yet stronger.But the part of the memory that had him at the tantalizing, frustrating brink ofnear understanding was what he remembered seeing in the murky darkness of falsedawn as he had laid there trying to fully wake. That part of the memory waswhere he now put all his attention, all his mental effort, all hisconcentration.He remembered shadowy tree limbs that appeared to move about, as if carried toand fro in the wind.But there had been no wind that morning. Everyone had been sure about thatpoint. Richard himself remembered how dead still it had been. But the darkshapes of the tree limbs had been moving.It seemed a contradiction.But, as Zedd had pointed out with the Wizard’s Ninth Rule, contradictions can’texist. Reality is what it is. If something contradicted itself then it wouldn’tbe what it is. It was a fundamental law of existence. Contradictions can’t existin reality.Tree limbs could not wave around by themselves and there had been no wind tomove them.That meant he was looking at the problem all wrong. He was always stumped by howthe tree limbs could move about in the wind when there was no wind. The simplefact was that they couldn’t. Maybe someone had been moving them.Pacing across the little room, Richard halted.Or maybe it wasn’t the tree limbs that had been moving.He’d seen the shadowy movement and had assumed it was the tree limbs. Maybe itwasn’t.With that single insight, Richard gasped with sudden realization.He understood.He stood frozen, eyes wide, unable to move, as the sequence of events and scrapsof information from that morning tumbled together in his mind, forming aframework of comprehension of what had happened. They had been taking Kahlan,probably using a spell of some sort on her, as they did to keep Richard asleep,then collected her things and tidied up the camp to erase evidence of her havingbeen there. That was the movement he remembered. It hadn’t been tree limbsmoving back and forth in the near darkness, it had been people. Gifted people.Richard saw a red glow. When he looked up, Nicci was coming into the small room.“Richard, I need to talk to you.”He stared at her. “I understand. I know what the viper with four heads means.”Nicci’s gaze turned away, as if she couldn’t bear to look into his eyes. He knewthat she thought he was merely adding another layer to his delusion.“Richard, listen to me. This is important.”He frowned at her. “Have you been crying?”Her eyes were red and puffy. Nicci was not the sort of woman given to tears. Hehad seen her cry, but only for very good reason.“Never mind that,” she said. “You have to listen to me.”“Nicci, I’m telling you, I’ve figured out—”“Listen to me!” Fists at her sides, she looked as if she might again burst intotears. He realized that he had never seen her looking quite this distraught.He didn’t want to waste any more time, but he decided that it might hurry thingsalong if he let her have her say.“All right, I’m listening.”Nicci stepped close and gripped him by both shoulders. With an intentexpression, she peered into his eyes. Her brow wrinkled with conviction.“Richard, you have to get out of here.”“What?”“I’ve already told Cara to collect your things. She’s bringing them now.She said she knows her way down here, down into the tower, anyway, withouthaving to go through shields.”“I know, I taught her before.” Richard’s sense of alarm began to rise. “What’sgoing on? Is the Keep under attack? Is Zedd all right?”Nicci cupped one hand to the side of his face. “Richard, they are determined toheal you of your delusion.”“Kahlan is no delusion. I just now figured out what happened.”She seemed not to notice what he said, or maybe she was ignoring what shethought was no more than yet another in a long series of attempts to prove theimpossible. This time, though, he wasn’t really interested in proving it to her.“Richard, I’m telling you, you have to get out of here. They wanted me to useSubtractive Magic to eliminate your memory of Kahlan.”Richard blinked in surprise. “You mean Ann and Nathan want to do that. Zeddnever would.”“Zedd too. They convinced him that you’re sick and the only way to heal you isto excise what they consider to be the diseased portion of your thoughtsresponsible for your false memories. They convinced Zedd that time is runningout and this is the only way to save you. Zedd is so heartbroken to see you likethis that he has snatched at what he thinks may be the only chance to make youwell again.”“And you agreed to this?”She indignantly smacked the side of his shoulder. “Are you crazy? Do you reallythink I would do that to you? Even if I thought they were right, do youseriously think I would ever consider taking away part of who you are? Afterwhat you’ve shown me about life? After what you have done to bring me back toembracing life? Do you really think that I would do that to you, Richard?”“No, I guess you wouldn’t do such a thing. But why would Zedd? He loves me.”“He is also terrified for you, terrified that you are being taken over by thisdelusion, or bewitchment, or whatever is causing this sickness that is leavingyou alive but not really yourself, turning you into a stranger they don’t know.“Zedd feels that this might be their only chance to ever have you whole again,to ever have you be Richard, the real Richard, again.“I don’t think that any of them—Ann, Nathan, or Zedd—really wants to do this,but Ann truly believes that you alone are the salvation for our cause. She hasfaith that prophecy has revealed this as the only chance we have and she isdesperate to make you well lest we all be lost.“Zedd was reluctant, but then they showed him a message in the journey book andtalked him into it.”“What message?”“Verna is with the D’Haran troops. She sent word that our soldiers are becomingdisheartened that you haven’t joined them. Verna fears that unless you are thereto lead them they may choose not to go on. She sent a desperate message wantingto know if Ann had found you yet, trying to find out when you could be expectedto join your men in the coming battle with the Imperial Order.”Richard was stunned. “I suppose I can understand why the three of them are soworried, but to ask you to use Subtractive Magic…”“I know. I think it’s a solution born of desperation, not clear thinking. Butworse, I fear that once they discover that I don’t intend to do as they wanted,they will then decide that they can’t let this opportunity slip away from themand so their only alternative will be to try to somehow use their gift to cureyou themselves. That kind of blind tampering with consciousness would beunpredictable, to say the least.“They’re desperate because they fear we all are running out of time beforeJagang ends our chances forever. They believe this is the only solution. Theyare no longer listening to reason.“You have to get out of here, now, Richard. I only agreed to their plan so thatI could warn you first and give you time to get away. You must leave immediatelyif you are to escape.”Richard’s head was spinning at the very notion of what they wanted to do. “Thatpresents a problem. I don’t know how to cover my trail with magic, the way Zeddcan. If they are as committed as you say they are, then they will come after me.If they follow me and take me by surprise, what am I going to do, then? Fightthem?”She lifted her arms in frustration. “I don’t know, Richard. But I do know theirstate of resolve. Nothing you say is going to talk them out of this because theythink you are suffering under a condition where you aren’t rational, so theyfeel that for your own good they must take control.They may be doing it for loving reasons, but they’re wrong to do it this way.Dear spirits, I, too, think you’re suffering from some problem, but I justcouldn’t allow them to do this.”Richard squeezed her shoulder in a gesture of appreciation before he turned awayas he tried to take it all in. It was near to impossible for him to imagine thatZedd would agree to such a thing. It just wasn’t like him.Wasn’t like him.Of course. It also wasn’t like Ann to be so certain of how Richard must be madeto play out his role in prophecy. Kahlan had changed everyone who knew her. Shehad made Ann come to see how Richard wasn’t meant to follow the literal readingof prophecy as if it were a book of instruction.Since Kahlan had vanished, everyone had changed. Zedd was different, too, andnot in ways that were at all helpful. Even Cara had changed. She was just asprotective, but now she was protective in a somehow more… feminine way. Niccihad changed as well, although in her case Richard thought the results were morepositive—from his standpoint, anyway. She had forgotten everything having to dowith Kahlan, and as a result she had become more sheltering of him despite herown views and interests, more willing to champion him despite everything he saidand did. She was more devoted to him and thus more dedicated to safeguardinghim.But Zedd had changed in ways that were more troubling, much as Ann had becomemore overbearing and willing to directly interfere with Richard’s decisions andimpose her views of what she believed Richard had to do.Richard had been telling people all along that the implications of Kahlan’sdisappearance were far broader and more complex than anyone but he was seeing.This change in everyone’s behavior, some subtle and some overt, was furthermanifestation of those far-reaching effects. And yet, even Richard hadn’trealized the full extent of the hidden corollaries and consequences.Things had changed. Richard could no longer allow past characteristics toconfuse the reality of how matters were in the present. It was vital that herecognize the truth of the way things were, now, and not be influenced by howthey had once been. Nicci had become even more of an ally. Cara was just asprotective as ever, if in a subtly different way. But Zedd and Ann, and possiblyNathan, had become less than dependable in ways that mattered most.He had to take the way people had changed into account and act accordingly. Hehad to keep his objectives in mind and act to accomplish those goals even if itmeant no longer fully trusting people he once had, people he cared about.With Kahlan’s disappearance, everything was being altered. The rules hadchanged.He turned back to Nicci.“This couldn’t have happened at a worse time. I just figured it out. The viperwith four heads are the Sisters of the Dark.”“Jagang’s Sisters?”“No—my former teachers, Sisters Tovi, Cecilia, Armina, and their leader, SisterUlicia. Sister Ulicia was the one who assigned all of my teachers, includingyou.”“Richard, that’s just crazy. I don’t—”“No, it’s not. That morning when I thought I saw the tree limbs moving whenthere was no wind, it wasn’t the tree limbs. It was those Sisters I saw moveabout in the near darkness.”“But Jagang has all the Sisters of the Dark.”“No, he doesn’t.”“He’s a dream walker, Richard. With the bond to you the Sisters of the Light whoare free are out of his grasp, but he captured those Sisters—I was there, withthem, when Jagang first got his clutches on us. They are Sisters of the Dark;without the bond they’re helpless against the dream walker. My… feelings arewhat bonded me to you and allowed me to escape his control. But they couldn’tescape; they’re not loyal to you nor could they be.”“Oh, but they are. They swore a bond to me.”“What! That’s impossible.”Richard shook his head. “You weren’t with them the day it happened. It was whenJagang’s troops were trying to take the Palace of the Prophets. Sister Uliciaand my former teachers—except you were gone and Liliana was dead—knew whereKahlan was being held. They wanted free of Jagang’s domination and so they mademe an offer. They traded the whereabouts of Kahlan in exchange for being allowedto swear loyalty to me so they could escape the dream walker’s domination.”Nicci was in near apoplexy with bottled objections. She looked as if the ideawas so bizarre that she had trouble even deciding where to start. She heaved abreath to gain control of her galloping objections.“Richard, you simply have to stop coming up with such flights of fancy. None ofthis even works in your story. The viper, as you think you figured out, wouldreally then have to have five heads. You forgot Merissa.”“No, Merissa is dead. She was trying to kill me—she came after me. She said sheintended to bathe in my blood.”Nicci pulled a strand of hair through her finger and thumb. “Well, I admit, Ioften heard her make that vow.”“She tried to make good on the vow. She had followed Kahlan and me in the sliph.The Sword of Truth is incompatible with life in the sliph. When I got here Iretrieved the sword and plunged it into the sliph before Merissa was able to getout. She died in there.“Of those Sisters of the dark who swore loyalty to me, only four are stillalive. Those Sisters are the viper with four heads. They’re the ones who camethat morning and took Kahlan. They used magic to spell me so that I wouldn’tawake easily. The spell they used must have been something simple, likemagnifying my sleepiness so that I wouldn’t realize that magic had been used onme. The single wolf that called wasn’t a wolf, but a signal given by theapproaching troops. Because of the spell I didn’t recognize it for what itwas—the spell made me so sleepy I couldn’t think, but still, I knew there wassomething strange about it. The Sisters then used magic to cover their trail.They took Kahlan.”Nicci seized fists full of blond hair as she growled in agitation. “But they’reSisters of the Dark! They can’t be bonded to you and the Keeper both. That wholeconcept is crazy.”“I thought so too. Sister Ulicia convinced me that I was only looking at it frommy perspective. She wanted to swear loyalty and in return I got to ask whereKahlan was. They had to answer truthfully to honor their bond. They then were toleave. If I asked any more than that it would break our agreement and we wouldall be back where we started—them subjects of Jagang and Kahlan a captive.Sister Ulicia said that after swearing their bond to me and my asking onequestion, they would then leave. They got the bond, I got Kahlan.”“But they’re Sisters of the Dark!”“Sister Ulicia said that if they didn’t actively try to kill me thereafter theyconsidered that to definitely be to my benefit so that was in their viewconforming to the requirements of their bond, since not killing me was what Iwanted, therefore keeping their bond to me intact.”Nicci turned away, one hand on a hip. “In an odd sort of way, that actuallymakes sense. Sister Ulicia is more than devious. That’s the way she thinks.”Nicci turned back. “What am I saying? Now you’re starting to suck me into yourdelusions. Richard, stop this. Look, you have to get out of here, and you haveto do it now. Come on. Cara will be right behind me with your things.”Richard knew that Nicci was right. He couldn’t find Kahlan if he had to worryabout warding off three people with the gift who knew quite well how to use itand wanted to alter his very thoughts. They weren’t likely to give him anychance to explain anything. He had already tried explanations and that hadn’tworked.They would most likely do what they thought they had to do. Richard didn’tbelieve that they would give him any warning. Before he knew what had hit him itwould be over.He hated to admit it to himself, but he knew that Zedd was capable of such athing. After giving Richard the Sword of Truth, when they were on their way totry to recover the boxes of Orden that Darken Rahl had put into play, Zedd hadonce said that so many lives were at stake that he would not hesitate to killeven Richard, if necessary, to save all those innocent people. He had toldRichard how, to be the Seeker and carry the Sword of Truth, he had to be readyto be just as committed to their cause, that he had to understand the largerpicture.It was hardly out of the question to imagine Zedd now being willing to use magicto try to erase Richard’s memory of Kahlan—a memory that Zedd thought was asickness that was harming him and their cause and thereby endangering the livesof millions.“I think you’re right,” Richard admitted in a dejected voice. “They will try tostop me.” He picked up the two small books lying on the table and slipped theminto a back pocket. “I think we had better get out of here before they can dothat.”“We? You want me to go with you?”Richard paused and shrugged self-consciously. “Nicci, you and Cara are the onlytrue friends I have right now. You’ve been there to help me when I needed itmost. I can’t afford to leave valued friends behind just when I’m beginning tofigure out what’s going on. Once I do have it figured out I may need your helpwith it, but even if I don’t I’d like you there with me just for the advice andsupport you give me.“I mean, if you’re willing to come. I’d not force you, of course, but I’d likeyou to come.”Nicci smiled that rare smile she had, the smile that revealed the nobility ofthe woman Nicci really was, the smile he had only seen since she had come tolove life."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 59Cara stood impatiently waiting on the other side of the shield. Rikka, standingguard near the iron door, was watching out into the tower room. Both turned whenthey saw the red glow and heard Richard coming. He saw packs and other gearcollected into a neat pile just inside the door. He pulled his pack out fromamong the others and stuffed the two books inside.“We’re leaving, then?” Cara asked.Richard put his arms through the straps and hiked the pack up onto his back.“Yes, and I think we best not waste any time.”As he picked up his bow and quiver, everyone else started gathering their ownthings.It appeared that Cara, wanting Nicci to be near Richard so that she would behandy to help protect him, had brought the sorceress’s things along as well.Richard wondered how much of wanting Nicci along had to do with what Shota hadsaid.He saw that Rikka, too, had a pack. He almost asked her what she thought she wasdoing, but realized then that she was Mord-Sith and she would say that her placewas with him. He had spent so much time with only Cara protecting him that hethought it would feel a bit odd having more than one Mord-Sith around again.“Everyone ready?” he asked as he saw them all tightening straps and buckles.After each woman nodded, Richard led the grim-faced group out the doorway. Heknew that Cara might have followed him without question, but she wouldn’tblindly follow Nicci or anyone else’s orders without good reason, so hesuspected that Cara had probably asked a lot of pointed questions—somethingMord-Sith were wont to do—and found out why they had to leave.At the base of the tower, Richard ran his hand along the iron railing as hestarted around the walkway, but then a sudden realization brought him to a halt.Everyone waited, watching him, wondering why he had stopped.Richard looked at Nicci’s puzzled blue eyes. “They’re not going to trust you inthis.”“What do you mean?” Nicci asked.“It’s too important. They aren’t going to leave it to you to do as theyinstructed. They will be concerned that you’ll lose your courage, or that youmight fail and allow me to slip away.”Cara stepped closer. “You mean you think they will come looking for you?”“No, not looking for me,” Richard said, “but I bet that somewhere between hereand the way out of the Keep they will be lying in wait, just in case I get pastNicci and try to leave. If we come upon them unexpectedly then it will be toolate.”“Lord Rahl,” Rikka said, “Mistress Cara and I would not allow anyone to harmyou.”Richard lifted an eyebrow. “I’d just as soon not have it come to that. Thosethree think they need to help me. They aren’t intent on harming me—at least notintentionally. I don’t want you two to hurt them.”“But if they surprise us with the intent of using their magic on you, you can’texpect us to let them do it,” Cara said.Richard met her gaze for a moment. “Like I said, I don’t want it to come tothat.”“Lord Rahl,” Cara said in a low voice, “I simply can’t allow anyone to attackyou in such a way, even if they think it’s to help you. You can’t equivocate ina situation like that. If they attack you, it must be stopped—period. If theywere allowed to succeed, then you would never be the same again. You would nolonger be the Lord Rahl we know, the Lord Rahl you are.”Cara leaned even closer and fixed him with that look that Mord-Sith had thatalways made him sweat. “If they do attack you and are allowed to succeed becauseyou fear to harm them, then when they are finished you will no longer rememberthis woman, Kahlan. Is that what you want?”Richard clenched his jaw as he let out a deep breath. “No, it’s not. Let’s tryto avoid having it come to such things. But if it does, then I guess you’reright. They can’t be allowed to do as they intend. But if we must stop them,let’s not use any more force than necessary.”“Hesitation is a mistake that invites defeat,” Cara said. “I would not beMord-Sith had I not hesitated when I was young.”Richard knew she was right. The Sword of Truth had taught him that much, atleast. The dance with death allowed no compromise between life and death.He laid a hand on Cara’s shoulder. “I understand.”Nicci gazed up the tower, her blue eyes taking in the doors all around it.“Where do you think they will wait?”“I don’t know,” Richard said as he hooked his thumbs under the shoulder strapsof his pack. “The Wizard’s Keep is immense, but in the end there’s only one wayout. Since there are so many routes we could take, I’d guess it will be when weget nearer the courtyard out to the portcullis.”“Lord Rahl,” Rikka spoke up, looking a little uneasy once he met her gaze,“there is another way out.”Richard frowned at her. “What are you talking about?”“There is another way out besides the main entrance. It is only accessiblethrough passages deep in the Keep.”“How do you know such a thing?”“Your grandfather showed it to me.”Richard didn’t have time to wonder at such a thing. “Do you think you can findit again?”Rikka considered a moment. “I believe so,” she finally said. “I sure wouldn’twant to get us lost down in the Keep, but I believe I can find the way. Startingout from here we’re already part of the way, so it won’t be quite so hard.”Richard went to rest his hand on the hilt of his sword as he considered. Thesword wasn’t there. He rubbed his palms together, instead.“Maybe it would be better if we went that way.”Rikka turned, her blond braid whipping around as she did so, and started away.“Follow me, then.”Richard let Nicci go ahead of him, then followed, letting Cara bring up therear. He hadn’t gone a dozen steps when he stopped. He turned and looked back.Everyone glanced to where he was looking and then watched him, puzzled by whathe could be thinking.“We can’t go that way, either.” He turned back to Rikka. “Zedd showed you thatway out of the keep. He knows Mord-Sith. he knows that despite how well you twogot along, if presented with a choice, your loyalties will fall to me.“Zedd is fond of using tricks. He will let Ann and Nathan guard the routes tothe main entrance to the Keep. He will lie in wait on the route he showed you,Rikka.”“Well, if there are only two ways out,” Nicci said, “that means they will haveto split up to make sure both are blocked. That’s if Zedd goes through thethought process as you’ve laid it out. He might forget that he told Rikka aboutthe other way out, or he might not think that she would tell you. That way stillmight be clear.”Richard slowly shook his head as he stared off at something else—the wideplatform partway back around the walkway around the stagnant water in the bottomof the gloomy interior of the tower.“While what you say is possible, counting on Zedd to make such a strategicmistake would be foolish.”Nicci was looking a bit worried. “Well, you can’t use your power withoutchancing calling the beast, but I certainly can use mine. And I have more powerat my command than Zedd does. If they split up as you suggest, then we will nothave all three to contend with at once.”“No, but I’d not like to have that kind of a test, especially not in the Keep.It’s possible that there are defenses here that he has initiated to protect theFirst Wizard should he be attacked. You might simply try to catch him up in aconjured tangle to slow him down while we escape and it might be all it takes totrigger something lethal. Besides, even if you do manage to succeed at such athing, he could still come after us.Nicci folded her arms. “Then what, exactly, do you suggest we do?”He turned back and once again met her blue eyes. “I suggest that we take a wayout that they can’t follow.”Her nose wrinkled up. “What?”“The sliph.”Everyone looked back down the walkway as if the sliph might be standing therewaiting for them to come and travel with her.“Of course,” Cara said. “We could escape without them ever knowing where we’vegone. There will be no tracks. More than that, though, it can put us atremendous distance away from the danger. They will have no hope of everfollowing us.”“Exactly.” Richard clapped her on the back of the shoulder. “Let’s go.”They all followed him as he rushed down the walkway and through the blasted opendoorway. Inside the sliph’s room, Nicci cast magic, igniting the torches inbrackets on the walls as they all gathered around the well. Everyone peered downtogether.“There’s only one problem,” Richard said out loud as the thought came to himwhile gazing down into the black abyss. He looked up at Nicci. “I have to usemagic to call the sliph.”Nicci took a deep breath and let it out with a discouraged look. “That is aproblem.”“Not necessarily,” Cara said. “Shota told us that using your magic had thepotential to call the blood beast. But it acts randomly. When you use magic, itwould be logical that it would thus find you, but the beast doesn’t act throughlogic. It might come when you use magic, Shota said, or it might not. There’s noway to tell or predict.”“And we’re pretty certain that we’re not going to be able to walk out of thisplace without having to confront the others,” Nicci pointed out.“Trying to run will present two problems,” Richard said, “getting past them andthen keeping out of their grasp to prevent them from trying to ‘heal me.’ Thismakes more sense. The sliph would be a certain way to escape without Zedd, Ann,and Nathan having any way to either follow or know where I went—and it wouldalso avoid confronting them, something I’d not like to have to do. I love mygrandfather; I don’t want to have to defend myself against him.”“I almost hate to say it,” Cara said, “but this makes more sense to me, too.”“I agree,” Rikka said.“Call the sliph.” Nicci held a handful of her hair back as she looked down topeer into the well again. “And hurry, before they come looking to see what’staking me so long.”Richard didn’t hesitate. He stretched his fists out over the well, He needed tocall his own gift in order to call the sliph and calling his own ability was notsomething he was good at. He resolved that he had done it before; he would haveto do it again.He let his tension go. He knew that he had to do this or he very well might losehis chance to ever find the one woman he loved more than life itself. For amoment, the pain of how much he hurt every day without her nearly made him pullinward with the aching misery of it.With his sincere and burning need to do whatever he must in order to helpKahlan, his need ignited deep within him. He felt it roaring up from the core ofhis being, taking his breath. He tightened his abdominal muscles against thepower of the feeling within him.Light ignited between his outstretched fists. He recognized the sensation fromhaving done it before. He pressed the padded silver-leather wristbands he woretogether. He had not had these the first time, but they were what the sliph hadtold him he should use to call her again. They brightened to such intensity thatthrough his flesh and bone Richard could see the other side of the heavy silverbands.He focused his intent. He wanted nothing else but for the sliph to come to himso that he could help Kahlan. He hungered for it. He demanded it be done.Come to me!The glow of light wailed as it ignited in a line down the center of the well,like a lightning bolt, but instead of the sound of thunder, the air crackledwith the ripping roar of fire and light racing away at incredible speed into thedepths of blackness.Those around the stone wall gazed anxiously down inside the well lit by theflash of light. Nicci also glanced around, keeping an eye on the room aroundthem, apparently worried about the appearance of the beast. The echo of thepower Richard had sent down into the well was a long time in fading away, but atlast all fell silent.In the stillness of the Keep, in the quiet of the mountain of dead stonetowering around and above them, came a distant, deep rumbling.A rumbling of something coming to life.The floor began to quake with growing force, until it began lifting dust fromthe joints and cracks. Small pebbles danced on the trembling stone floor.Far down in the distant depths the well began filling with something rushing upthe shaft at impossible speed, roaring with a howling shriek of velocity as itcame. The howl grew as the sliph rushed upward to meet the call.Nicci, Cara, and Rikka backed away from the well as shimmering silver shotupward, coming to an instantaneous stop that somehow seemed graceful.Within the undulating silver pool, a lustrous metallic hump mounded up, risingabove the edge of the stone wall surrounding the well. It drew up into a bulk,rising of its own accord, gathering into a recognizable shape. Its glossysurface, like a liquid mirror, reflected everything around the room, distortingthe images reflected off its surface as it grew and transformed.It looked like living quicksilver.The rising shape continued to contort, bending into edges and planes, folds andcurves, until it warped into a woman’s face.A silver smile widened in what seemed to be recognition. “Master, you calledme?”The sliph’s eerie, feminine voice echoed around the room, but her lips hadn’tmoved.Richard stepped closer, ignoring Nicci and Rikka’s wide-eyed astonishment. “Yes.Sliph, thank you for coming. I need you.”A silver smile was pleased. “You wish to travel, Master?”“Yes, I wish to travel. We all do. We all need to travel.”The smile widened. “Come, then. We will travel.”Richard herded everyone close to the wall. Liquid metal formed into a hand thatreached out to touch each of the three women in turn.“You have traveled before,” the sliph said to Cara after only brief contact withher forehead. “You may travel.”The glistening hand gently brushed a palm across Nicci’s brow, lingering for abit longer. “You have what is required. You may travel.Rikka lifted her chin, ignoring her distaste for magic, and stood her ground asthe sliph touched her forehead.“You may not travel,” the sliph said.Rikka looked indignant. “But, but, if Cara can—why can’t I?”“You do not have both sides required,” said the voice.Rikka folded her arms defiantly. “I must go with them. I’m going, too. That’sall there is to it.”“It is your choice, but if you try to travel in me, you will die, and then youwill not be with them either.”Richard laid a hand on Rikka’s arm before she could say anything else. “Caracaptured the power of someone who had an element of the required magic; that’swhy she can travel. There is nothing to be done about it. You have to stayhere.”Rikka didn’t look at all happy, but she nodded. “The rest of you had better getgoing, then.”“Come,” the sliph said to Richard, “and we will travel. To which place do youwish to travel?”Richard almost said it aloud, but then stopped himself. He turned to Rikka.“You can’t come with us. I think you had better leave now, so that you don’teven hear where I’m going. I don’t want to take the chance that if you know,then the others might somehow find out. My grandfather can be clever when hewants to be and pull tricks to get his way.”“You don’t need to tell me.” Rikka sighed in resignation. “You’re probablyright, Lord Rahl.” She smiled at Cara. “Protect him.”Cara nodded. “I always do. He’s pretty helpless without me.”Richard ignored Cara’s boast. “Rikka, I need you to tell Zedd something for me.I need you to give him a message.”Rikka frowned as she listened intently.“Tell him that four Sisters of the Dark have captured Kahlan, the real MotherConfessor, not the body buried down in Aydindril. Tell him that I intend to comeback as soon as I can and I will bring him the proof. I ask that when I return,before he tries to cure me, he allow me to show him the evidence I will bring.And tell him that I love him and understand his concern for me, but that I’mdoing as the Seeker must do, as he himself charged me to do when he gave me theSword of Truth.”When Rikka had gone, Cara asked, “What evidence?”“I don’t know. I haven’t found it yet.” Richard turned to Nicci. “Don’t forgetwhat I told you before. You have to breathe in the sliph once we go under. Atfirst you’ll want to hold your breath, but that just isn’t possible. Once wearrive and come up out of the sliph, you must let her out of your lungs andagain breathe in the air.”Nicci was looking more than a little nervous. Richard took her hand. “I’ll bewith you, as will Cara. We’ve both done this before. I won’t let go of you. It’shard to make yourself breathe in the sliph for the first time, but once you do,you will see that it’s quite a remarkable experience. It’s rapture to breathethe sliph.”“Rapture,” Nicci repeated with more than just a little incredulity.“Lord Rahl is right,” Cara said. “You’ll see.”“Just remember,” Richard added, “when it ends you will not want to let go of thesliph and breathe air again—but you must. If you don’t, you’ll die. Do youunderstand?”“Of course,” Nicci said with a nod.“Come on then.” Richard started to climb up on the wall, pulling Nicci up withhim.“Where will we travel, Master?”“I think we should go to the People’s Palace, in D’Hara. Do you know the place?”“Of course. The People’s Palace is a central site.”“A central site?”If living quicksilver could be said to look puzzled by a question, the sliphlooked puzzled. “Yes, a central site. Like this place here is a central site.”Richard didn’t understand, but didn’t think it was relevant and so didn’t pressthe issue. “I see.”“Why the People’s Palace,” Nicci asked.Richard shrugged. “We have to go somewhere. We’ll be safe at the Palace. Butmore importantly, they have libraries there with rare ancient books. I’m hopingthat maybe we can find something about Chainfire. Since the Sisters have Kahlan,I’m thinking that Chainfire might have something to do with some kind of magic.“From what we’ve heard, the D’Haran army is somewhere in the vicinity on theirway south. What’s more, the last time I saw Berdine, another Mord-Sith, was whenI left her here in Aydindril, so she will probably be either close to our troopsor the palace. I need her to help me translate some of the material from thebooks I’m bringing along. Besides that, she has Kolo’s journal and she mayalready know something helpful.”He glanced at Cara. “Maybe we can see General Meiffert and see how things aregoing with the troops.”Cara’s face lit with surprise and a broad grin.Nicci nodded thoughtfully. “I guess all that makes sense, and I guess it’s asgood a place as any. It gets you out of immediate danger and that’s what mattersmost right now.”“All right, sliph,” Richard said, “we wish to travel to the People’s Palace inD’Hara.”A liquid silver arm came up and slipped around all three of them. Richard feltthe warm, undulating grip compressing to get a firm grasp on him. Nicci had hishand in a death grip.“Lord Rahl?” Cara asked.Richard held up the hand that wasn’t holding Nicci’s to halt the sliph beforeshe could lift them into the well. “What?”Cara bit her lip before finally speaking. “You’re holding Nicci’s hand. Will youhold my hand, too? I mean, I wouldn’t want the three of us to get separated.”Richard tried not to smile at the worry on her face. Cara feared magic, even ifshe had already done this before.“Sure,” Richard said as he took her hand. “I wouldn’t want us to get separated.”A sudden thought struck him.“Wait!” he said, stopping the sliph before she could start.“Yes, Master?”“Do you know a person named Kahlan? Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor?”“This name means nothing to me.”Richard sighed in disappointment. He hadn’t really expected the sliph to knowKahlan. No one else did, either.“Would you happen to know a place called the Deep Nothing?”“I know several places in the Deep Nothing. Some have been destroyed, but somestill exist. I can travel to them if you wish.”Richard’s heart quickened in surprise. “Are any of these places in the DeepNothing also a central site?”“Yes, one of them,” the sliph said. “Caska, in the Deep Nothing, is a centralsite. Would you like to travel there?”Richard glanced to both Nicci and Cara. “Do either of you know this place,Caska?”Nicci shook her head.Cara was frowning. “I think I remember hearing something about it when I waslittle. I’m sorry Lord Rahl, but I don’t remember exactly what—just that thename sounds familiar from old legends.”“What do you mean, legends?”Cara shrugged. “Old D’Haran legends… something about dream casters. Storiespeople told. Something about the history of D’Hara. It seems like Caska is aname from olden times.”Olden times. Dream casters. Richard remembered that when he’d skimmed throughsome of the book Gegendrauss that he’d found back in the shielded room, he hadseen something about casting dreams, but he hadn’t translated the passage. Eventhough Richard was the leader of the D’Haran Empire, he knew very little aboutthe mysterious D’Hara.Even if Cara didn’t know more, Richard still felt as if he had just taken a stepcloser to finding Kahlan.“We wish to travel,” he said to the sliph. “We wish to travel to Caska, in theDeep Nothing.”It had been a long time since Richard had traveled in the sliph and he felt abit apprehensive. But his excitement that he was finally making connections tofind the answers that had for so long eluded him swept away any concern.“We travel to Caska, then,” the sliph said, her voice echoing around the stoneroom where once Kolo had died standing guard over her as the great war had cometo an end. At least, everyone thought it had come to an end, but those ancientconflicts had not ended so easily and now they had again flared to life.The arm lifted all three of them off the wall and plunged them down into thesilver froth. Nicci’s grip on his hand tightened and she gasped in a breathbefore going under."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 60With an arrow’s speed, Richard flew through the silken silence of the sliph, yetat the same time he glided with the slow grace of a raven riding the stilledcurrents above towering trees on a moonlit night. There was no heat, no cold. Inthe silence, sweet sounds filled his mind. His eyes beheld light and darktogether in a single, spectral vision, while his lungs swelled with the sweetpresence of the sliph as he breathed her into his soul.It was rapture.Abruptly, it ended.Grainy darkness exploded in his sudden vision. There seemed to be blocky shapesall around as he broke the surface. Nicci’s hand gripped his in terror.Breathe, the sliph told him.Richard let out the sweet breath, emptying his lungs of the rapture. With aneedful gasp, he sucked in the alien air. Cara, too, gasped in the hot, dustyair.Nicci floated face down, rocking gently in the silver fluid.Richard threw an arm over the stone wall at the side of the sliph, pulling Nicciwith him. He took his bow off his back to get it out of his way and quickly setit against the outside of the wall. With the sliph’s help, he hopped up on thewall, and then with the sliph lifting her, pulled the dead weight of Nicci upenough to get her shoulders and head up into the warm, dark air.Richard slapped her on the back. “Breathe, Nicci. Breathe. Come on, you have tolet go of the sliph and breathe. Do it for me.”At last she did. She gasped in the air, her arms flailing in terror at beingconfused and lost in such strange surroundings. Richard pulled her close as hehelped her get her arms over the side and, panting, climb up on the wall.Brackets on the walls nearby held glass spheres, like back at the Keep, thatglowed brighter as he climbed out of the well.“What do you think this place is?” Cara asked as she peered around in the dimlight.“That was… rapture,” Nicci said, still under the sway of the experience.“I told you,” Richard said as he helped her climb out.“It looks like we’re in a stone room of some kind,” Cara said as she walkedaround the perimeter of the room.Richard made his way toward the darkness at one end and two larger spheres intall iron brackets brightened with an eerie green glow. He saw that they flankedsteps. The steps, though, marched up to the ceiling.“That’s pretty strange,” Cara said as she stood on the second step, inspectingthe dark ceiling.“Here,” Nicci said. She was leaning over to the side of the steps. “There’s ametal plate.”It was the kind of metal plate Richard had seen in other places. They weretrigger plates for shields. Nicci tapped her palm against it but nothinghappened.Richard pressed his hand to the icy cold plate and stone started grating as itmoved. Dust came down in streamers.The three of them ducked back as they all peered around in the gloomy light,trying to figure out what, exactly, was moving. The ground trembled. It feltlike the whole room might be shifting and somehow changing shape. Richard thenrealized that it was actually the ceiling that was pulling aside.A growing patch of moonlight fell across the steps.Richard had no idea where they were, other than down in a stone room thatappeared to be buried. He didn’t know where Caska was, other than the sliph saidthat it was in the Deep Nothing, and he didn’t know where that was, so he didn’treally know what to expect. He felt decidedly uneasy.He reached for his sword.The sword wasn’t there. For what felt like the thousandth time, he felt thesinking regret of realizing why and where it now was.He drew his long knife instead as he started up the steps in a crouch, duckinglow not only so as not to hit his head on the ceiling before it had moved out ofthe way, but out of caution for who might be outside and have heard stonesliding aside. Cara, seeing him draw his knife, spun her Agiel up into her fist.She tried to get out ahead of him, but he held his arm out, keeping her behindto the left. Nicci was close behind to his right.As he came up out of the ground, he saw the shadowed shapes of three peoplestanding not far ahead. He knew that from being in the sliph, until he fullyrecovered, his vision was more acute than ordinary. He could probably see thembetter than they could see him.With that sharp vision, Richard saw that the big man in the middle was holding aslender girl back against him. He had one hand over her mouth. He could see thegirl squirming. Moonlight gleamed off the blade he held to her throat.“Drop your weapons,” the man holding the girl growled, “and surrender to theImperial Order, or you will die.”Richard flipped the knife into the air, let it make a half turn, and caught itby the tip. An inky shape suddenly swooped atop the man’s head. The bird let outa piercing caw. The man flinched. Richard didn’t take the time to wonder at suchan unexpected assault. He heaved the knife.On broad wings, the bird lifted into the air. The blade hit the man in thecenter of his face with a solid thunk. Richard knew that the blade was longenough to have penetrated all the way through the man’s brain and that the tipwould have pierced the back of the skull. The man dropped straight down behindthe trembling girl—dead before he could think to do her harm.Before the men to either side of the girl could take a half a step, Nicciunleashed a scything whisper of power that took the heads off the other two men.The only noise it made was the sound of the heads hitting the ground with twin,dull thuds. The bodies toppled to either side of the girl.The night was still but for the drone of cicadas.The girl hesitantly stepped closer and dropped to her knees. She bent forwardbefore the steps until her forehead touched the stone at his feet.“Lord Rahl, I am your humble servant. Thank you for coming and protecting me. Ilive only to serve. My life is yours. Command me as you will.”Even as the girl was still speaking in a quavering voice, Cara and Nicci werespreading out to the sides, searching for other threats. Richard crossed hislips with a finger to let them know to be quiet about it so as not to alert anyother troops that might be near. Both saw his signal and nodded.Richard waited, listening for any threat. Since the girl was on the ground, helet her stay there, out of harm’s way. He heard the whisper of feathers againstair as the raven landed on a nearby limb and then the soft rustle as it foldedin its wings.“It’s clear,” Nicci announced in a quiet voice as she returned from the shadows.“My Han tells me there are no others in the immediate vicinity.”Relieved, Richard let the tension go out of his muscles. When he heard the girlweeping in quiet terror, he sat down on the top step right near her. Hesuspected her terror was fear that she might be killed just as the three men hadbeen. Richard wanted to assure her that she was not going to die.“It’s all right,” he told her as he gently grasped her shoulders and urged herup. “I’m not going to hurt you. You’re safe, now.”As she came up he gathered the frightened girl into his arms, embracing herprotectively, holding her head to his shoulder when she glanced to the threedead men as if they still might jump up and snatch her away. She was a slenderlithesome creature, the kind of girl on the brink of being a woman, yet lookingas frail as a bird about to leave the nest. Her slender arms came gratefullyaround Richard as she wept with relief.“The bird a friend of yours?” he asked.“Lokey,” she confirmed with a nod. “He watches over me.”“Well, he did a good job tonight.”“I thought you weren’t going to come, Master Rahl. I thought it was my fault,that I wasn’t a good enough priestess for you.”Richard ran a hand down the back of her head. “How did you know I was cominghere?”“The tellings say it is so. But I already waited so long that I thought theymight be wrong. I was near to despairing that you would find us not worthy, andthen I feared it was my failing”He surmised that the “tellings” must mean prophecy of some sort. “You are apriestess, you say?”She nodded as she pulled back to look up at his smile. Richard saw then that herbig copper-colored eyes peered out from a dark mask painted in a band around herface. It was a disturbing visage.“I am the priestess of the bones. You have returned to help me. I am yourservant. I am the one meant to cast the dreams.”“Returned?”“To life. You have come back from the dead.”Richard could only stare.Nicci squatted down beside the girl. “What do you mean, he returned from thedead?”The girl pointed behind them, at the structure from where they had emerged.“From the world of the dead… back to we the living. It says his name there, onhis tomb.”Richard turned and indeed did see his name carved in the monument. The thingthat came immediately to mind was seeing Kahlan’s name carved in stone, too.Both of them were alive, despite their graves.The girl glanced at Cara and then at Nicci. “The tellings say that you will comeback to life, Lord Rahl, but they did not say that you would bring your spiritfamiliars.”“I haven’t come back from the dead,” Richard told her. “I came through thesliph—down there, in that well.”She nodded. “The well of the dead. The tellings mention such mysterious things,but I never knew their meaning.”“Do I call you ‘priestess,’ or by your name?”“You are Master Rahl; you can call me as it pleases you. My name is Jillian,though. I have had that name my whole life. I’m afraid I have not been apriestess a long time, and so I’m not very good at it, I don’t think. Mygrandfather said that when it is time, it matters not how old I am, but that itis time.”“How about if I call you Jillian, then?” he asked with a smile.She appeared still too frightened to return the smile. “I would like that,Master Rahl.”“My name is Richard. I’d like it if you called me Richard.”She nodded, still with that look of awe filling her round eyes. Richard didn’tknow if her awe was at the Master Rahl, or a dead man returned to life andwalking up out of his grave.“Now look, Jillian, I don’t know anything about your tellings, yet, but you needto understand that I haven’t returned from the dead. I traveled here because Ihave trouble and I’m looking for answers.”“You have found the trouble, then. You killed three of them. The answer is foryou to help me cast the dreams so that we might drive these evil men away. Theyhave driven most of my people into hiding. The older ones are down there.” Shepointed down the dark slope. “They tremble in fear that these men will kill themif they do not find what they seek.”“What are they looking for?” Richard asked.“I’m not sure. I have been hiding among the spirits of our ancestors. The menmust have made someone down there tell them of me because they knew my name whenthey finally chased me down, today. I have been staying out of their grasp for along time. Today they were hiding where I had cached some food. The men grabbedme and wanted me to show them where the books are.”“These aren’t the regular Imperial Order troops,” Nicci explained to thefrowning look on his face. “They’re advance scouts.”Richard glanced at the bodies. “How do you know?”“Because regular Imperial Order troops would never ask you to put down yourweapons and surrender. Only the scouts, searching routes through strange landsand hunting for any information they can uncover would take prisoners. Theyquestion people. Those who won’t talk are sent back to be tortured. These scoutsare the men who first find stashes of books that are then collected for theemperor to see. Scouts like this find not only the best routes for the troops,but they are meant to find something even more important for the emperor:knowledge, especially that in books.”Richard knew the truth of that. Jagang seemed to be an expert on history andwhat had been done in ancient times. He used that information to greatadvantage. It seemed like Richard was always trying to catch up with what Jagangalready knew.“Have these men found any of the books, yet?” Richard asked Jillian.Her copper-colored eyes blinked. “My grandfather has told me about books, but Iknow of none that are here. The city has been abandoned since ancient times. Ifthere were books, they have long ago been looted along with anything else ofvalue.”That was not what Richard had hoped to hear. He had been hoping that maybe therewould be something here that would help answer the questions he had. After all,Shota had told him that he must find the place of the bones in the Deep Nothing.The graveyard all around him certainly was a place of bones.“This place is called the Deep Nothing?” he asked her.Jillian nodded. “It is a vast land where little lives. None but my people canscrape a life from this forbidding place. People have always feared to comehere. The bleached bones of those who do venture here are out there, in thisplace and to the south, before the great barrier. The land is called the DeepNothing.”Richard realized that it must be a place much like the wilds in the Midlands.“The great barrier?” Cara asked, suspiciously.Jillian looked up at the Mord-Sith. “The great barrier that protects us from theOld World.”“This has to be southern D’Hara,” Cara told him. “That’s why I heard storiesabout Caska when I was a child—because it’s in D’Hara.”Jillian pointed. “This is the place of my ancestors. They were destroyed bythose from the Old World back in ancient times. They, too, were ones who castdreams.” She looked off into the darkness to the south. “But they failed andwere destroyed.”Richard didn’t have time to try to figure it all out. He had enough problems.“Have you ever heard of Chainfire?”Jillian frowned. “No. What is Chainfire?”“I don’t know.” He tapped a finger against his bottom lip as he thought aboutwhat to do next.“Richard,” Jillian said, “you must help me cast the dreams that will drive thesemen away so that my people will be safe again.”Richard glanced up at Nicci. “Any ideas how I can do such a thing?”“No,” she said. “But I can tell you that the rest of the men will sooner orlater come looking for these three dead men. These aren’t your average ImperialOrder soldiers. They may be brutes, but they are the smartest of them. I imaginethat casting dreams is something that involves your gift… not an advisable thingto be doing,” she added.Richard stood up and put one hand on a hip as he stared off at the dark city onthe headland.“Seek what is long buried…” he whispered to himself. He turned back to Jillian.“You said that you were a priestess of the bones. I need you to show meeverything you know about the bones.”Jillian shook her head. “First you must help me cast the dreams so that I canchase the strangers away and my grandfather and the rest of our people will besafe.”Richard sighed in frustration. “Look, Jillian, I don’t know how to help you castdreams and I don’t have time to figure it out. But I would imagine, as Niccisaid, that it involves magic, and I can’t use magic or it very well could call abeast that could kill all of your people. This beast has already killed a lot ofmy friends who were with me. I need you to show me what you know about what islong buried.”Jillian wiped at her tears. “Those men have my grandfather and others downthere. They will kill him. You must save my grandfather first. Besides, he is ateller. He knows more than me.”Richard put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. He could not imagine how he wouldfeel if someone whom he thought was powerful refused to help save hisgrandfather.“I have an idea,” Nicci said. “I’m a sorceress, Jillian. I know all about thesemen and how they work. I know how to handle them. You help Richard, and whileyou do that I’ll go down there and see to getting rid of these men. When I’mdone they will no longer be a danger to you or your people.”“If I help Richard, you will help my grandfather?”Nicci smiled. “I promise.”Jillian looked up at Richard.“Nicci keeps her word,” he told her.“All right. I will show Richard everything I know about this place while youmake those men leave us be.”“Cara,” Richard said, “go with Nicci and watch her back.”“And who will watch yours?”Richard put a boot on the head of the man he had killed and yanked his knifefree. He pointed with the weapon. “Lokey will watch our backs.”Cara did not look amused. “A raven is going to watch your back.”He wiped the blade clean on the man’s shirt, then returned the knife to itssheath at his belt. “The priestess of the bones will watch over me. After all,she’s been here waiting all this time for me to come here. Nicci is the one whowill be in danger. I’d appreciate it if you protected her.”Cara glanced at Nicci as if grasping some greater meaning. “I will protect herfor you, Lord Rahl.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 61As Nicci and Cara started down toward where Jillian said the rest of theImperial Order soldiers were, Richard went back into his tomb and recovered thesmallest of the glass spheres. He slipped it into his pack so that it wouldn’tinterfere with his night vision, but would be handy if they had to go into anyof the buildings of the city. Searching ancient decaying buildings in the darkwas not a prospect he relished.Jillian was like a cat that knew every nook and cranny of the ancient city onthe headland. They went through streets that had nearly disappeared under rubbleand wreckage of walls long since fallen. Some of the debris had collectedweather-borne dust and dirt that had eventually filled it in, making small hillswhere trees now grew among the buildings. There were a number of buildingsRichard didn’t want to enter because he could see that they were ready tocollapse if the wind blew the wrong way. Others were still in relatively goodcondition.One of the larger buildings Jillian took him to had arches all along the frontthat at one time had probably held windows, or maybe had even been open to whatseemed an inner courtyard. As Richard walked across the floor, small bits ofcrumbled mortar crunched underfoot. A mosaic made of tiny square colored tilescovered the entire floor. The colors were long since faded, but Richard couldstill make them out well enough to see that the swirling lines of tiles made upa sprawling picture of trees dotting a landscape surrounded by a wall, withpaths through places where there were graves.“This building is the entrance to a section of the graveyard,” Jillian told him.Richard frowned as he leaned down a little, studying the picture. There wassomething odd about it. Moonlight fell across figures in the mosaic that werecarrying platters with breads and what looked like meats into the graveyard,while other figures were coming back with empty platters.Richard straightened when he heard a horrifying cry drift up to them from thefar distance, both he and Jillian stood up stock still, listening. More of thedistant, faint wails and laments drifted in on the cool night air.“What was that?” Jillian asked in a whisper, her copper-colored eyes wide.“I think Nicci is getting rid of the invaders. Your people will be safe once sheis finished.”“You mean she is hurting them?”Richard could see that such concepts were alien to the girl. “These are men whowould do terrible things to your people—including your grandfather. If they areleft to come back another day, they will kill your people.”She turned and looked back out through the arches. “That wouldn’t be good. Butthe dreams would have driven them away.”“Did casting dreams save your ancestors? Save the people of this city?”She looked back to his eyes. “I guess not.”“What matters most is that people who value life, like you, your grandfather,and your people are safe to live their lives. Sometimes that means it’snecessary to eliminate those who would do you harm.”She swallowed. “Yes, Lord Rahl.”He put a hand on her shoulder and smiled. “Richard. I am a Lord Rahl who wantspeople to be safe to live as they wish.”At last she smiled.Richard looked back to the mosaic, studying the picture. “Do you know what thismeans? This picture?”Finally pulling herself away from the distant, ghastly screams of pain thatdrifted in from the darkness, she looked down at the picture. “See this wallhere?” she asked as she pointed. “The tellings say that these walls held thegraves of the people of the city. This place, here, is where we are, now. Thisplace is the passage to the dead.“The tellings say that there were always dead, but only this place to put themwithin the city walls. The people didn’t want their loved ones to be far fromthem, far from what they considered the sacred place for their ancestors, sothey made passages where they could find resting places for them.”Shota’s words echoed around in his memory.You must find the place of the bones in the Deep Nothing.What you seek is long buried.“Show me this place,” he told Jillian. “Take me back there.”It was more difficult to reach than he had expected it would be. There was alabyrinth of passages and rooms back through the building. Some of it wentbetween walls that were open to the stars, only to reenter the dark depths ofthe building.“This is the way of the dead,” Jillian explained. “The deceased were brought inthrough here. It is said that it was made this way in the hopes that the soulsof the dead would be confused by the passages and these new spirits would not beable to wander back out. Instead, confined in this place and unable to come backamong the living, they would then go on to be where they belonged in the spiritworld.”They at last came back out into the night. The crescent moon was rising abovethe ancient city of Caska. Lokey circled above and called down to his friend.She waved back. The graveyard spread out before him was good sized, but seemedinadequate for a city.Richard walked with Jillian on the path through the crowded graves. Gnarledtrees stood in places. In the moonlight it was a peaceful place, with wildflowers spread across the rising and falling contour of the land.“Where are the passages you spoke of?” he asked her.“I’m sorry, Richard, but I don’t know. The tellings speak of them, but do notsay how to find them.”Richard searched the graveyard, Jillian at his side, as the moon rose higher inthe sky, and he could not find any evidence of passages. It all looked like anygraveyard he had ever seen. Some of the ground was mounded with a number ofmarkers. The stones for each grave were crowded close. Some yet stood, whileothers had long since fallen to lie flat on the ground, or be grown over.Richard was running out of time. He couldn’t stay down in Caska, foreverlistening to the cicadas sing. This was getting him nowhere. He needed to lookfor answers where he was apt to find them. This ancient place did not appear tobe the place.At the People’s Palace in D’Hara there would be valuable books that Jagang hadnot yet been able to loot. It was more likely that he would find usefulinformation there than in an empty graveyard.He sat down on the side of a small hillock beneath an olive tree to considerwhat he might do.“Do you know of any other place where there would be these passages that werementioned in the tellings?”Jillian’s mouth twisted as she considered. “I’m sorry, but no. When it is safe,we can go down and talk to my grandfather. He knows many things—much more thanme.”Richard didn’t know how much time he had to devote to listening to hergrandfather’s stories, either. Lokey fluttered down to the ground nearby tofeast on the newly emerging cicadas. After the seventeen years they’d livedunderground, more of them were emerging—only to be pecked up by the raven.Richard recalled the prophecy Nathan had read to him. It had mentioned thecicadas. He wondered why. It had said something about when the cicadas awakened,the final and deciding battle was upon them. The world, it said, was at thebrink of darkness.Brink of darkness. Richard glanced down at the cicadas as they emerged. Hewatched them coming up out of the ground.As he watched, he realized that they were all coming up through a space in agravestone laying facedown against the rise of ground. Lokey had noticed, too,and stood eating them.“That’s odd,” he said to himself.“What’s odd?”“Well, look there. The cicadas aren’t coming up through the dirt, they’re comingup from under that stone.”Richard knelt down and pushed his fingers down into the space. It seemed hollowunderneath. Lokey cocked his head as he watched. Richard lifted, grunting withthe effort. The stone began to lift. As it came up, he realized that it washinged on the left. It finally gave way and opened.Richard stared down into the darkness. It wasn’t a grave marker. It had been astone cap to a passageway. He immediately pulled the glass sphere out of hispack. As it began to glow, he held it down in the dark maw.Jillian gasped. “It’s a stairway!”“Come on, but be careful.”The stairs were stone, irregular, and narrow. The leading edge of each wasswaybacked and rounded from countless feet making the journey. The passage waslined with blocks of stone, making a clear path down deep into the ground. Thesteps came to a landing and turned right. After another long run, they turnedleft and went deeper.When they finally reached the bottom, the passage opened into wider corridorsthat were carved from the solid but soft rock of the ground itself.Richard held the glowing globe out in one hand and Jillian’s hand in his otheras he bent a little to clear the low ceiling as he led them deeper. It wasn’tlong before they encountered an intersection.“Do your tellings say anything about finding our way down here?” She shook herhead. “How about all those mazes you learned. Do you think they will do you anygood down here?”“I don’t know. I never knew this place existed.”Richard let out a breath as he looked down each of the two passages. “All right,I’ll just start going in deeper. If you think you recognize anything, or any ofthe routes, let me know.”After she agreed, they started down the left fork. To each side of the narrowpassageway they began finding niches that had been carved into the walls. Insideeach lay the remains of a body. In places the niches were stacked three or fivehigh. Some had two bodies, probably a husband and wife.Around some of the recesses, ancient painting still remained. The artwork wasvines in some places, people with food in others, and in some places simpledesigns. From the different styles and the varying quality of the art, Richardguessed that it must have been done by loved ones for a member of their familywho had died.The narrow passageway opened up into a chamber with ten openings tunneling offin various directions. Richard picked one and started down it. It, too, openedinto broader spaces, with a warren of branches. The elevation changed, from timeto time going down deeper, and occasionally going up a bit.They soon began encountering the bones.There were rooms with stacks of similar bones in niches. Skulls had beencarefully fit into one niche, leg bones all stacked end out in another, armbones in another yet. Great stone bins carved in the side walls held smallerbones all laid in neatly. As Richard and Jillian moved through vault aftervault, they saw walls of skulls that had to number in the tens of thousands.Knowing that he was seeing only one random passageway, Richard could not imaginehow many people had to be interred in the catacombs. Even as startling, and evenhorrifying, as it was to see so many of the dead, each of their bones looked tohave been placed reverently. None were simply cast into a hole or a corner. Eachhad been carefully placed as if each had been a valued life.For what had to be well over an hour, they made their way through the maze oftunnels. Each section was different. Some were wide, some narrow, some withrooms to each side. After a time, Richard realized that each spot must have beencarved out of the soft rock to make space for a family; that was why the nichesseemed to fill every available space in such a haphazard fashion.And then they came to a section of the passage that had partially collapsed. Ahuge section of stone had toppled and rubble had fallen in around it.Richard stopped and looked at the tangle of stone. “I guess this is as far as wego.”Jillian squatted down, peering under the stone block lying at an angle acrossthe passageway. “I can see a way under here.” She turned to Richard. Hercopper-colored eyes looked frightening staring out from the black mask paintedacross her face. “I’m smaller. Do you want me to go have a quick look?”Richard held the glowing sphere down in the opening to light it for her. “Allright. But I don’t want you to keep going if you think it looks dangerous. Thereare thousands of tunnels down here, so there are plenty others to look in.”“But this is the one the Lord Rahl found. It must be important.”“I’m just a man, Jillian. I’m not some wise spirit returned from the world ofthe dead.”“If you say so, Richard.”At least she smiled when she said it.Jillian disappeared into the angular hole like a bird going through a thornbush.“Lord Rahl!” came her echoing voice. “There are books in here.”“Books?” he called into the hole.“Yes. A lot of books. It’s dark, but it looks like a big room with books.”“I’m coming in,” he said.He had to take his pack off and push it out ahead as he crawled in. It turnedout not to be as worrisome as he had feared, and he was soon through. When hestood on the other side, he realized that the huge stone block lying at an angleacross the passage had once been a door. It looked like it had been designed toslide out of a slot cut into the side of the wall, but at some point the massivedoor had broken along a fault in the stone, and it had toppled over. As Richardinspected the mess, he brushed the dust away and saw one of the metal platesthat activated a shield.The idea that these books had been behind a shield made his heart race faster.He turned back to the room. The warm light from the glowing sphere did indeedshow a chamber full of books. The room ran at odd angles, seemingly withoutreason. Richard and Jillian walked along the passageway, looking at all thebooks. Most of the shelves were carved into the solid rock, the way the restingplaces for the dead had been cut out to make room.Richard held the sphere up as he started scanning the shelves.“Listen,” he said to Jillian, “I’m looking for something specific: Chain-fire.It might be a book. You start on one side, and I’ll take the other. Make sureyou look at each book’s title.”Jillian nodded. “If it’s in here, we will find it.”The ancient library was discouragingly huge. As they inched along and rounded acorner, they encountered a chamber lined with aisles of shelves. The search wasslow going. They had to work in the same area so that they could both see.For several hours, they painstakingly made their way through the room. Partwaythrough, they encountered side chambers, smaller than the main room, but stillfull of books. From time to time they each had to blow dust off some of thespines.Richard was tired and frustrated by the time they came to a spot where he sawanother of the metal plates. He pressed the flat of his hand against it and thestone wall in front of them began to move. The door wasn’t big, and it quicklypivoted open into blackness. He hoped that the shields keyed off what theyrecognized of his gift, and didn’t actually work by making his power answer somesilent, unfelt call. He’d not like to be down in the catacombs and have thebeast materialize.Richard stuck the light into the darkness and saw a small room with books. Therewas also a table that had long ago collapsed because some of the ceiling hadcome down on top of it.Jillian, deep in concentration, ran a finger along the spines of the books asshe read each while Richard took five strides across the room to the far wall.He saw another metal plate there and pressed his hand to it.Slowly, another narrow door in the stone began pivoting away from him into thedarkness. Richard crouched lower as he stepped into the doorway and held thelight partway in.“Master, you wish to travel?” a voice echoed.He was staring at light reflecting back off the sliph’s silver face. It was thewell room, where they had come in. The doorway was on the opposite side of thesteps from where they had found the first metal plate that had opened theceiling.They had just spent most of the night going around in a circle, ending up rightwhere they had started.“Richard,” Jillian said, “look at this.”Richard turned back around and came face-to-face with the red leather cover of abook she was holding up.It said Chainfire.Richard was so stunned that he couldn’t talk.Jillian, grinning with discovery, came into the sliph’s room with him as hebacked in, taking the book from her hands.He felt as if he were somewhere else, watching himself hold the book namedChainfire."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 62Richard?” It was Nicci’s voice.Still startled to actually have found Chainfire, he walked to the steps andlooked up. Both Nicci and Cara, silhouetted by dawn light, were peering down athim.“I found it. I mean, Jillian found it.”“How did you get down there?” Nicci asked as Richard and Jillian started up thesteps. “We just looked in there and you weren’t there.”“Jillian?” It was a man’s voice.“Grandfather!” Jillian raced the rest of the way up the steps and flew into anold man’s arms.Richard climbed the steps after her. Nicci was sitting on the top step. “What’sgoing on?”“This is Jillian’s grandfather,” Nicci said, lifting out a hand in introduction.“He is the teller of these people, the keeper of the old knowledge.”“Glad to meet you,” Richard said, embracing the old gentleman’s hand. “You havea wonderful granddaughter. She just helped me out immensely.”“You would have found it if I hadn’t seen it first,” Jillian said, grinning.Richard smiled back.He turned to Nicci. “What happened to Jagang’s men?”Nicci shrugged. “Night fog.”As Jillian went with her grandfather to greet Lokey on a nearby wall, Richardspoke confidentially to Nicci and Cara.“Fog?”“Yes.” Nicci interlaced her fingers around a knee. “Some kind of strange smokyfog drifted past them and made them go blind.”“Not just blind,” Cara said with obvious delight, “but burst their eyes right intheir sockets. It was a bloody mess. I quite enjoyed it.”Richard frowned at Nicci, wanting an explanation.“They’re scouts,” she said. “I know these men and they know me. I didn’t wantthem seeing me. More than that, though, I wanted them to be useless toJagang—the ones who live, anyway. From what Jillian’s grandfather tells me, hedoubts that many of them will make it back to Jagang’s forces, but I made surethey were near enough to their horses so that their animals will carry themback. I want the ones who live through the ordeal to be able to report only thehorror of the fog coming down from the hills—that they were blinded in astrange, forbidding, and haunted land. Such news will send a fright through hismen.“Raping, pillaging, and slaughtering the helpless is all perfectly entertainingfor Jagang’s army, but they rather don’t like things like this. Dying for theCreator in a grand battle and going to their reward in the afterlife is onething, being taken by something they can’t see coming out of the darkness andending up helpless in this way is quite another matter.“I expect that Jagang will decide to skirt this land rather than allow someunknown out here to give his men a fright that could change their minds aboutfighting for the glory of the Creator and the Imperial Order. That means theywill have to continue on south for a good distance. It will add time to theirjourney before they can finally swing around and come up into D’Hara.”Richard nodded thoughtfully. “Very good, Nicci. Very good.”She beamed. “What do you have there?”“Chainfire.” He moved up on the steps to sit between Nicci and Cara. “It’s abook.” He hesitated in opening the cover. “In case this is some kind of prophecyor something, I’d just as soon you looked at it first.”Concern settled in her exquisite features. “Of course Richard. Give it here.”Richard handed her the book and stood. He didn’t want to risk glancing at it andtoo late discovering that he shouldn’t have, only to discover the beast about totear into them. Especially not now, not when he was so close to getting answers.Nicci was already scanning the book, Cara looking over her shoulder.“It makes no sense,” Cara announced as she read from Chainfire.Richard didn’t think that Nicci shared that opinion. Her face was draining ofcolor. “Dear spirits…” she whispered to herself.As she kept reading, not saying anything to them, Richard sat on a rise ofground to the side, under an olive tree. There was a vine growing around thetrunk. He reached out to idly pluck a leaf from the vine.He stopped, his hand inches from the dusky, variegated leaves.Icy gooseflesh prickled up his arms.He knew what that vine was.From The Book of Counted Shadows, the book that his father had him commit tomemory before they destroyed it, the words flooded into his mind: And when thethree boxes of Orden are put into play, the snake vine shall grow.“What’s the matter?” Jillian whispered to him as she leaned close. “You looklike you’ve seen a spirit.”“Have you ever seen this plant growing here, where your people live?”“No, I don’t believe I have.”“She’s right,” Jillian’s grandfather said in a puzzled voice. “I’ve lived inthese parts all my life. I don’t recall seeing that vine before, except for aspell almost three years back, I believe it was. That’s right, three years thiscoming autumn. Then it died away. Haven’t seen it since.”Richard didn’t see any pods on the newly sprouted vine. He reached out andcarefully plucked a sprig.“Richard, this is an incredibly dangerous book,” Nicci said in a gravelytroubled voice. She was preoccupied, still reading, and not paying any attentionto the rest of them talking. “This is beyond dangerous.” She was reading as shespoke. “I’m only in the beginning, but this is… I don’t even know how to begin…”Richard rose to his feet, holding the sprig of the vine out, staring at it.“We have to go,” he said. “Right now.”Something in the tone of his voice made Cara and even Nicci look up.“Lord Rahl, what is it?” Cara asked.“You look like you just saw the ghost of your father,” Nicci said.“No, this is worse,” Richard told her, finally looking up. “I understand. I knowwhat’s going on.”He ran to the steps down into his tomb. “Sliph! We need to travel!”“But Richard, you have come to help me cast the dreams so that the evil peoplewill not come here.”“Look, I have to leave. Right now.”“Lord Rahl has already helped us as much as he can for now,” her grandfathersaid as he put an arm around her slender shoulders. “If he can, he will returnto us.”“That’s right,” Richard said, “if I can I’ll return. Thank you, Jillian, forhelping me. You can’t begin to imagine what you have done this day. Tell yourpeople to stay away from that vine.”“Richard,” Nicci said, “what’s gotten into you?”He seized Nicci’s dress at her shoulder, and Cara’s arm.“We have to get to the People’s Palace. Now.”“Why? What’s happening? What did you find?”Richard showed her the sprig of vine before stuffing it in a pocket and grabbingher arm again and forcing her down the steps.“This is a snake vine. It only grows when the boxes of Orden have been put inplay.”“But the boxes of Orden are safe in the palace,” Cara protested.“They’re not safe any longer. Those Sisters have put the magic of Orden in play.Sliph! We need to travel to the People’s Palace.”“Come, we will travel.”Nicci was still fighting him as he pulled her along. “Richard, I don’t see whatthis has to do with your dream of this woman.”Richard slapped the metal plate, starting the ceiling of the tomb closing. “Goodbye, Jillian. Thank you. I will return someday.”As she waved, he snatched up his bow and quiver.He turned to Nicci. “They need Kahlan. She’s the last living Confessor. They putthe boxes of Orden in play. They need the book I have memorized. The first thingit says is ‘Verification of the truth of the words of the Book of CountedShadows, if spoken by another, rather than read by the one who commands theboxes, can only be insured by the use of a Confessor. … ‘ “The ceiling finished closing. In the distance, Richard could hear Jillian call,“Good-bye, Richard. Safe journey.”“Richard, this is crazy. It’s just—”“Now is not the time to argue with me.”She knew by his tone of voice that he meant it.He climbed up on the wall and hoisted both women up.“Here, wait,” Nicci said as she opened the pack. “You had better keep thissafe.” She stuffed Chainfire down inside and tied the flap down tight.“Any idea what Chainfire is about?” he asked.Her blue eyes gazed into his. “From what I was able to tell from the tiny bit Isaw in the beginning, it’s a theoretical formula for conjuring things that havethe potential to unravel existence.”“Unravel existence?” Cara asked. “What does that mean?”“I’m not exactly sure. But it seems to be a discussion of a theory of a specificmagic that if ever initiated could potentially destroy the world of life.”“Why in the world would they need that?” Richard asked. “They have the magic ofOrden, now.”Nicci didn’t answer. She didn’t believe his theory; it involved Kahlan.“Sliph, now, please. Take us to the People’s Palace.”The silver arm swept them up. “Come, we will travel.”Just before they plunged into the silvery froth, Nicci and Cara each seized oneof his hands."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 63Nicci had hardly gotten her bearings, hardly recognized that they were in amarble room, hardly let the sliph out of her lungs and pulled in a desperategasp of air, when Richard was already pulling her up over the wall by the hand.Despite everything, she was still able, in some dim part of her mind, to thrillat holding his hand, for whatever reason.She had thought that while in the sliph traveling to the People’s Palace, thatshe would be able to give thought to Richard’s strange new twist of finding abit of a vine and leaping to the conclusion that the boxes of Orden were inplay—all in an attempt to prove that Kahlan was real.The room they were in was shielded. Richard pulled her and Cara through thepowerful shield. They ran up a marble hall and out a double silver door with alake embossed into the metal.“I know this place,” Cara said. “I know where we are.”“Good,” Richard said, “then you lead the way. And hurry.”There were times when Nicci almost wished that she had gone along with Zedd,Ann, and Nathan’s plan to purge him of his memory of Kahlan.Except for one thing. She had tried the theory on one of Jagang’s men back inCaska. She had tried to use Subtractive Magic to eliminate the man’s memory ofthe emperor. It sounded simple enough. She had done just as the three had wantedNicci to do to Richard.There had only been one problem.It had killed the man. Killed him in a most horrifying fashion.When she thought about how she had almost done that to Richard, how for a timeshe had let them talk her into it and had been committed to doing it, she hadgotten so weak and dizzy that she had to sit down on the ground next to the deadsoldier. Cara had thought Nicci had been about to pass out. The idea of what shehad almost done left her shaking for an hour.“Here,” Cara said as she led them up stairs that emptied into a broad corridorwith parts of the roof glassed.The light flooding in was reddish, so it was either almost sunset or just afterdawn, Nicci didn’t know which. It was a disorienting feeling not to know if itwas day or night.The halls were filled with people. Many of them stopped to stare at the threepeople running along the corridor. Guards also noticed and came running, handsto weapons, until they saw Cara in her red leather outfit. Many of the peoplerecognized Richard and dropped to a knee, bowing as he ran past. He didn’t slowto acknowledge them.They went up a dizzying array of passages, over bridges, along balconies,between columns, and through rooms. Intermittently they ran up stairs.Occasionally Cara took them through service halls, undoubtedly as shortcuts.Nicci took note of how magnificent the palace was, how remarkably beautiful. Thepatterned stone floors were laid with rare precision. There were grandstatues—none as remarkable as the statue Richard had carved, but grandnonetheless. She saw a tapestry that was larger than any she had seen in herlife. It depicted a sprawling battle and must have had several hundred horses init.“This way,” Cara said, pointing down a hall as she rushed toward it.As they came around the corner, Cara crossed over to the other side of thepassageway as she ran down it. Nicci, pulled along by her hand, would have likedto have discussed a number of things, to have asked some important and pointedquestions, but it was all she could do to get her breath as she ran. Running wasnot something she really ever did until she met Richard.Cara slid to slow down as she came to a pair of carved mahogany doors. Nicci wasrevolted to see the snakes carved into them. Without pause, Richard seized oneof the door handles, a bronze skull, and yanked the door open.Inside the quiet, carpeted room, four guards immediately sprang to blockRichard’s path. They saw Cara, and looked at Richard again, uncertain.“Lord Rahl?” One asked.“That’s right,” Cara snapped. “Now, get out of the way.”The men immediately pulled back, each putting a fist to their hearts.“Has anything happened recently?” Richard asked as he caught his breath.“Happened?”“Intruders? Has anyone slipped in this way?”The man snorted a laugh. “Hardly, Lord Rahl. We’d know if that happened and we’dnot allow it.”Richard nodded his thanks and raced to the marble stairs, nearly pulling Nicci’sarm out of the socket in the process. As they ran up the steps, Nicci thoughtthat her legs might simply quit. Her muscles were so exhausted from the long runup through the palace that she could hardly make them go on, but she had to, forRichard.At the top of the stairs, soldiers were running toward them, crossbows loadedwith red-fletched arrows at the ready. They didn’t know it was the Lord Rahl.They thought someone was trying to get into the restricted area. Nicci hopedthat someone got hold of their senses before one of the men got careless.But by their reactions, Nicci realized that these men were highly trained andnot prone to shooting arrows before they were sure of their target. Lucky forthem, because she would have been faster.“Commander General Trimack?” Richard asked an officer pushing his way throughthe ring of steel that had surrounded them.The man stiffened and clapped a fist to his heart. “Lord Rahl!” He spotted theMord-Sith. “Cara?”Cara nodded in greeting.Richard clasped arms with the man. “General, someone has gotten in here. They’vetaken the boxes in the Garden of Life.”The general was momentarily struck speechless. “What? Lord Rahl, that’s notpossible. You have to be mistaken. No one could get past us without our knowingit. It’s been peaceful as can be up here for ages. Why, we’ve only had onevisitor.”“Visitor? Who?”“The Prelate. Verna. It was a while back. She was in the palace checking onsomething about books of magic, she said. She said that as long as she was here,she wanted to have a look to make sure the boxes were safe.”“So you let her go in there?”The general looked a bit indignant. A long scar stood out white when his facewent red.“No, Lord Rahl. I wouldn’t let her go in there. What we ended up doing wasopening the doors so she could look in to see that everything was safe.”“Look in?”“That’s right. We surrounded her with men, all pointing these special arrows ather—arrows Nathan Rahl found for us that will stop even the gifted. We had herringed in steel. The poor woman looked like a pincushion about to happen.”Men all around nodded at the general’s words.“She looked in the garden and said she was relieved to see that everything wasfine. I took a look myself and saw the three black boxes sitting on the stoneslab across the room. But I never let the woman set foot beyond the doors, Iswear.”Richard heaved a sigh. “And that’s it? No one else has opened those doors?”“No, Lord Rahl. No one else has even been up here but my men. No one. We don’tlet anyone even use these halls around the Garden of Life. As you may recall,you were rather insistent about it the last time you were here.”Richard nodded, thinking. He looked up. “Well, let’s go have a look.”The men, all jangling with weapons and armor, followed the surprise visitorsdown the polished granite hall until they reached two huge, gold covered doors.Without waiting for someone else to do it, Richard pulled one of the heavy doorsopen and started into the room. The soldiers paused at the doors. This wasapparently sacred ground, a sanctuary for the master of the palace alone, andunless invited by the Lord Rahl, none of them would enter. Richard didn’t invitethem as he rushed off on his own.Despite how tired she was, Nicci hurried after him as he made his way down apath among beds of flowers. Overhead, through a glassed roof, she could see thatthe sky had turned to a darker purple, so she knew it was night, rather thandawn.Just like Richard, Nicci paid little attention to the vine covered walls, or thetrees, or all the other things growing all around. The garden was a magnificentplace, to be sure, but her gaze was riveted on the stone altar she saw in thedistance. She didn’t see any of the three boxes that were supposed to be there.There was something else standing on the slab of granite, but she couldn’t tellwhat it was.By the way Richard’s chest was heaving, he did know what was standing there.They crossed a ring of grass, and the open dirt. In the dirt, Richard stoppedcold in mid-stride and stared down at the ground.“Lord Rahl,” Cara asked, “what is it?”“Her tracks,” he whispered. “I recognize them. These aren’t covered by magic.She was here alone.” He gestured to the dirt. “Two sets. She was in here twice.”He looked back at the grass, following what he could see that they couldn’t.“She was on her knees there, in the grass.”He took off and ran the rest of the way to the stone altar. Nicci and Carasprang into a run to keep up with him.When they reached the slab of granite, Nicci knew at last what it was that stoodthere all alone.It was the statue of the woman that had been carved in marble in Liberty Squarein Altur’Rang. The original statue Richard had told them he had carved. Thestatue he said belonged to Kahlan. Nicci could see that there were bloodyhandprints all over it.Richard picked up the carved wooden figure in trembling hands and drew it to hisbreast, gasping back a sob. Nicci thought that he might fall to the ground, buthe didn’t.When he had held it for a moment, he turned to them, tears running down hisface. He held out to Cara and Nicci the statue of the proud figure, her headthrown back, her hands fisted at her sides.“This is the statue I carved for Kahlan. This is Spirit. This is the statue Itold you could not be in Altur’Rang because she had it with her. If they copiedthis statue in stone down in Altur’Rang in the Old World, then how did it gethere?”Nicci stared at it, her eyes wide, trying to reconcile what she was seeing. Shecouldn’t comprehend the contradiction. She remembered Richard trying tounderstand what he had seen at the grave site where the Mother Confessor wasburied. Now she knew how he had felt.“Richard, I don’t understand how that could have gotten here.”“Kahlan left it here! She left it here for me to find! She took the boxes ofOrden for the Sisters! Don’t you get it? Don’t you at last see the truthstanding before you?”Unable to say more, he pulled the statue back to his chest as if it were themost precious treasure in the world.In that moment, seeing the pain trembling through him, Nicci wondered what itwould be like to have him love her that much.At the same time, despite her confusion, despite sadness for what she wasseeing, for the pain he was so obviously in, she felt joy, joy that Richard hadsomeone who meant that much to him, someone who could make him feel that way…even if she was imaginary. Nicci was not yet convinced that she wasn’t.“Do you understand now?” he asked. “Do you two get it, now?”Cara, looking as stunned as Nicci felt, shook her head. “No, Lord Rahl, I don’tunderstand.”He lifted the small statue. “No one remembers her. She probably walked rightpast those men and they forgot her, just like you forgot all the thousands oftimes you’ve seen her. She’s all alone, in the hands of those four Sisters, andthey made her come in here and get the boxes. Do you see the blood all over it?Her blood? You should understand that. Can you imagine how she feels, all alone,forgotten by everyone? She left this, probably hoping someone would see it andknow she exists.”He thrust it at Cara, then at Nicci. “Look at it! It’s covered in blood! There’sblood on the altar. There’s blood on the floor. There are her footprints. How doyou think the boxes are gone and this is here? She was here.”The indoor garden was dead silent. Nicci was so confused she didn’t know what tobelieve. She knew what she was seeing, but it didn’t seem possible.“Do you believe me, now?” Richard asked them both.Cara swallowed. “Lord Rahl, I believe what you are saying, but I still don’tremember her.”When his raptor gaze slid to Nicci, she, too, swallowed at the power of thatlook.“Richard, I don’t know what is going on. What you say is certainly powerfulevidence, but, like Cara says, I still don’t remember her. I’m sorry, but Ican’t lie to you and tell you what you want to hear just to make you happy. I’mtelling you the truth. I still don’t know what you’re talking about.”“I know you don’t,” he said with sudden, quiet, remarkable sympathy. “It’s whatI’ve been telling you. Something terrible is happening. No one remembers her.Anything that could cause such an event is undoubtedly powerful and extremelydangerous conjuring, able to be engendered only by the most powerful people whohave command of both sides of the gift. Magic so dangerous that it would behidden in a book buried in a catacomb behind shields where the wizards who putit there hoped no one would ever find it.”“Chainfire” Nicci breathed. “But from the brief bit I saw of it, this somehowhas the power to undo the world of life.”“What do the Sisters care?” Richard asked in a bitter voice. “They’ve alreadyput the boxes of Orden in play. It is their intent to end life on behalf of theKeeper of the dead. You should understand that better than anyone.”Nicci put a hand to her forehead. “Dear spirits, I think you may be right.” Shecouldn’t feel her fingertips. She was tingling all over with dread. “From thelittle bit I read, Chainfire sounds like it might be something along the linesof what Zedd, Ann, and Nathan wanted me to do to you—use Subtractive Magic tomake you forget Kahlan. If what you say is true, then in a way, that might bewhat the Sisters did—they made everyone else forget her.”Nicci looked up into his gray eyes, eyes she could lose herself in. She felttears of fright run down her cheeks.“Richard, I tried that.”“What are you talking about?”“I tried what they wanted me to do to you. I tried it on one of Jagang’s men,back at Caska. Tried to make him forget Jagang. It was fatal. What if that’swhat Chainfire does to everyone?”Richard heaved an angry breath. “Come on.”He marched out of the garden to a general and his guards waiting out in thepolished granite hallway, huddled around the entrance to the Garden of Life.“Lord Rahl,” the general said, “I don’t see the boxes any more.”“They’ve been stolen.”Jaws of men standing all around dropped in stunned astonishment. GeneralTrimack’s eyes went wide. “Stolen… but, who could have stolen them?”Richard held up the statue and waggled it in front of the man. “My wife.”General Trimack looked like he didn’t know whether to scream in fury or commitsuicide on the spot. He instead rubbed a hand back and forth on his mouth as hethought through everything he’d heard and apparently tried to put it togetherwith any other information he had. He looked up at Richard with the kind ofintent look that few men other than generals could muster.“I get reports all the time, Lord Rahl. I insist that I see all reports—younever can tell what bit of information you might learn that could turn out to behelpful. General Meiffert sends me reports as well. Since he’s now close by, Iget them within hours. Soon he and the troops will be moving south and it willtake longer, but for now, I get them fresh.”“I’m listening.”“Well, I don’t know if it means anything, but the latest report I got early thismorning said that they came across a woman, an old woman, who had been stabbedby a sword. She’s in bad shape, according to the report. I don’t know why hesent me a report on such a thing, but General Meiffert is a pretty smart fellow,and I have to think that there was just something bloody odd about it for him towant me to know.”“How close is he?” Richard asked. “The army, I mean. How close?”The general shrugged. “By horse? Ride half way hard and they’re not more than anhour or two away.”“Then get me some horses. Immediately.”General Trimack clapped a fist over his heart at the same time as he signaled acouple men forward. “Run on ahead and get some horses ready for the Lord Rahl.”He looked at Richard, then glanced at Cara and Nicci. “Three horses?”“Yes, three,” Richard confirmed.“And an escort of the First File to show him the way and provide protection.”The two men nodded and took off at a dead run for the stairs.“Lord Rahl, I don’t know what to say. I will of course resign—”“Don’t be silly. This isn’t something you could have done anything about; it wasdeception by magic. It’s my fault for letting this happen. I’m the Lord Rahl.I’m supposed to be the magic against magic.”Nicci could only think that he had been trying to be, but no one would believehim.Without sparing any time to rest, Richard, Cara, and Nicci, escorted by acompany of the palace guards, rushed through the grand, wide corridors ofRichard’s ancestral home. People along their route scattered out of the way ofthe wedge of guards coming down the halls. Behind the guards, Cara marched outin front of Richard. Nicci rushed along at his side.As they made their way down a smaller corridor, with fewer people, Richardslowed and then stopped. The guards stopped far enough away to be handy, but togive him his privacy. As everyone waited, Richard gazed down a side passageway.Cara looked uncomfortable.“Quarters for Mord-Sith,” Cara explained to Nicci in answer to the unspokenquestion in her eyes.“Denna’s room was down that hall.” Richard gestured the other way. “Your roomwas down there, Cara.”Cara blinked. “How do you know that?”He looked at her for a moment, his expression unreadable. “Cara, I rememberbeing there.”Cara turned as red as her leather outfit. “You remember?” Richard nodded. “Youknow?” she whispered, panic coming into her eyes.“Cara,” he said gently, “of course I know.”Her eyes brimmed with tears. “How did you know?”He gestured to her right wrist. “When I’ve touched your Agiel, it hurts. AnAgiel only hurts when a person touches it if it was used to train them, or ifthe Mord-Sith intends it to hurt.”She closed her eyes. “Lord Rahl… I’m sorry.”“It was a long time ago, when you were a different person, and I was the enemyof your Lord Rahl. Things change, Cara.”“Are you sure I’ve changed enough?”“Others made you into who you were. You made yourself into what you havebecome.” He smiled. “Remember when the beast hurt you, and I healed you?”“How could I ever forget it?”“Then you know how I feel.”She smiled at that.Richard’s brow drew together. “Touch…” His eyes lit up with sudden recognition.“The sword.”“What?” Nicci asked.“The Sword of Truth. That morning, when I was asleep, I think the Sisters cast aspell to make me sleep more soundly so they could take Kahlan. But I put my handon the sword. I was touching the Sword of Truth when they took her and madeeveryone forget Kahlan. The sword protected me from that magic. That’s why Iremember her. The Sword of Truth was a countermeasure to what they did.”Richard started out again. “Come on, we need to get to the encampment and seewho that injured woman is.”Baffled, Nicci followed after him."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 64Nicci was surprised by the encampment. She was so used to being among Jagang’sarmy that she hadn’t really given any thought to how different these men mightbe. It made sense, of course, but she had just never given it any thought.Even in the dark, there was still the light of all the fires and she expected tobe the center of morbid attention, with men calling out the filthiest thingsthey could think of in an attempt to shock her, or humiliate her, or frightenher. Men in the Order encampment always hooted and hollered at her, made obscenegestures, and laughed uproariously as she passed among them.These men, to be sure, looked her way. Nicci expected that it was a rareexperience to see a woman like her riding into their camp. But they only looked.A glance, an admiring gaze, a smile here and there with a bow of the head ingreeting was the most she got. It could be that she was riding in beside theLord Rahl and a Mord-Sith in red leather, but Nicci didn’t think so. These menwere different. They were expected to conduct themselves with respect.Everywhere when men saw Richard, they were eager to clap a fist to their heartsin salute as they stood in pride, or trotted alone beside his horse for a time.They looked overjoyed to see him riding into their camp, to see their Lord Rahlamong them again.The camp was also more orderly as well. That it was dry was a help; there werefew things worse than an army camp in the wet. In this camp the animals wereconfined to areas where they wouldn’t accidentally create trouble. Wagons wereout of the main route through the camp. There actually were deliberate routesthrough the camp.The men looked weary from the long march, but their tents were set up in arather systematic manner, not the haphazard, every-man-for-himself method theImperial Order employed. The fires were small and were only what was needed, notthe drunken revelry of men dancing, singing, and brawling around the bonfires.The other big difference was that there were not any torture tents set up. TheOrder always had an active area set aside for torture. A steady stream of peopleflowed in for questioning, and an equal number of corpses flowed out. Theconstant screams from victims made for a noisy camp.That was the other thing. It was rather quiet. Men were finishing with meals andbedding down for the night. It was a quiet time. In the Order’s encampment,there wasn’t any time that was quiet.“There,” one of the men escorting them said as he lifted an arm to point out thecommand tents in the darkness.A big blond-headed officer came out of one of the tents when he heard horsesnearby. He had undoubtedly already been alerted that the Lord Rahl was on hisway.Richard swung down off the saddle and stopped the man from going to his knees todo a devotion.“General Meiffert, it’s good to see you again, but we don’t have time for that.”He bowed his head. “As you wish, Lord Rahl.”Nicci watched the general’s blue eyes glance to Cara as she came up besideRichard.He smoothed back his blond hair. “Mistress Cara.”“General.”“Life is too short for you two to pretend you don’t care for each other,”Richard said, his anger surfacing. “You ought to realize that every moment youhave together is precious and there is nothing wrong with holding someone inhigh regard. That’s the kind of freedom we’re fighting for. Well, isn’t it?”“Yes, Lord Rahl,” General Meiffert said, somewhat taken aback.“We’re here because of a report you sent about a woman who was stabbed. Is shestill alive?”The young general nodded. “I haven’t checked in the last hour or so, but shewas, earlier. My field surgeons attended to her, but there are wounds wellbeyond their ability. This is one of those. She was stabbed in the gut. It’s aslow and painful way to die. She’s lived longer than I expected.”“Do you know her name?” Nicci asked.“She wouldn’t tell us when she was wide awake, but when she was in a feveredstate, we asked again and she said her name was Tovi.”Richard glanced at Nicci before asking, “What does she look like?”“Heavy set, older woman.”“Sounds like her,” Richard said as he wiped a hand across his face. “We need tosee her. Right away.”The general nodded. “Follow me, then.”“Wait,” Nicci said.Richard turned back to her. “What is it?”“If you go in to see her, she won’t tell you anything. Tovi hasn’t seen me forages. The last she knew, I was still a slave to Jagang and she had escaped. Imight be able to talk to her in a way that will get the truth out of her.”Nicci could see how impatient Richard was to get his hands on one of the womenthat he believed was responsible for taking the woman he loved.Nicci still didn’t know what she believed. She wondered if she still believedthat he was only dreaming up this other woman simply because of her ownfeelings.“Richard,” she said as she stepped close to him so that she could talkconfidentially, “let me do this. If you go in there it will spoil what I can do.I think I can get her to talk, but if she sees you, the game will be over.”“And how do you plan to accomplish getting her to talk?”“Look, do you want to know what happened to Kahlan, or do you want to argueabout how I’m going to get that information?”He pressed his lips tight for a moment. “I don’t care if you pull her intestinesout an inch at a time, just get her to talk.”Nicci briefly put a hand on his shoulder on her way by as she followed after thegeneral. Once they were away, she moved up and walked beside him as they marchedthrough the nearly dark camp. She could see why Cara found the man attractive.He had one of those handsome faces that just didn’t look like it could wear alie well at all.“By the way,” he said, glancing over at her, “I’m General Meiffert.”Nicci nodded. “Benjamin.”He paused in the dark pathway through the camp. “How do you know that?”Nicci smiled. “Cara told me about you.” Still, he stared at her. She took hisarm and started him moving again. “And for a Mord-Sith to speak so highly of aman is quite unusual.”“Cara spoke highly of me?”“Of course. She likes you. But you know that.”He clasped his hands behind his back as they walked. “I guess, then, that youmust know that I think a lot of her.”“Of course.”“And who are you, anyway, might I ask? I’m sorry, but Lord Rahl didn’t introduceus.”Nicci gave him a sidelong glance. “You may have heard of me as Death’sMistress.”General Meiffert stumbled to a stop, choking on spit from gasping. He cougheduntil his face was red.“Death’s Mistress?” he finally managed. “People are more afraid of you thanJagang himself.”“For good reason.”“You’re the one who captured Lord Rahl, and took him to the Old World.”“That’s right,” she said as she started out again.He walked along beside her, thinking it over. “Well, I’d guess that you musthave changed your ways, or Lord Rahl wouldn’t have you with him.”She simply smiled at him, a smooth, sly smile. It made him uneasy. He gesturedto the right.“Down here. The tent where we put her is over here.”Nicci grasped his forearm to hold him in place. She didn’t want Tovi hearingher, yet.“This is going to take a goodly amount of time. Why don’t you tell Richard thatI said he should get some rest. I think Cara ought to get some rest, too. Whydon’t you see to that, as well?”“Ah, I guess I could do that.”“And General, if my friend Cara doesn’t leave here in the morning with a giddygrin, I’ll gut you alive.”His eyes widened. Nicci couldn’t help but to smile.“Figure of speech, Benjamin.” She arched an eyebrow. “You have the night withher. Don’t waste it.”He smiled at last. “Thank you…”“Nicci.”“Thank you, Nicci. I think about her all the time. You don’t know how much I’vemissed her—how much I’ve worried about her”“I think I do. But you should tell her that, not me. Now, where is Tovi?”He lifted an arm and pointed. “Down there, on the right. The last tent in theline.”Nicci nodded. “Do me a favor. See to it that no one disturbs us. Including thesurgeons. I need to be alone with her.”“I’ll see to it.” He turned back and scratched his head. “Ah, it’s none of mybusiness, but are you”—he gestured between her and back the way they’d come—”youand Lord Rahl, well, you know.”Nicci couldn’t seem to make herself come up with an answer that she wished tovoice.“Time is short. Don’t keep Cara waiting.”“Yes, I see what you mean. Thank you Nicci. I hope to see you in the morning.”She watched him rush off into the darkness, then turned to her task. She hadn’treally wanted to unnerve the general with talk of Death’s Mistress, but sheneeded to slip back into that part of herself, needed to think that way again,needed to find the icy attitude that was numb to everything.She pulled the tent flap aside and slipped inside. There was a single candle liton a holder made of wrought iron that was stuck in the ground beside a cot. Thetent was stuffy and warm. It smelled of stale sweat and dried blood.Tovi’s bulk lay on her back in the cot, laboring to breathe.Nicci sat lightly on a field stool beside the woman. Tovi hardly noticed someonesitting down. Nicci laid a hand on Tovi’s wrist and began to trickle in a threadof power to help the woman’s suffering.Tovi recognized such gifted help and immediately looked over. Her eyes went wideand her breathing quickened. She then gasped in pain and clutched at herabdomen. Nicci increased the flow of power until Tovi sagged back with a moan ofrelief.“Nicci, where have you come from? What in the world are you doing here?”“Well, since when do you care? Sister Ulicia and the rest of you left me inJagang’s clutches, his personal slave, left me a captive of that pig.”“But you got away.”“Got away? Sister Tovi, are you out of your mind? No one got away from dreamwalker—except you five.”“Four. Sister Merissa is no longer living.”“What happened?”“Stupid bitch tried to play her own game with Richard Rahl. You remember how shehated him—wanted to bathe in his blood.”“I remember.”“Sister Nicci, what are you doing here?”“The rest of you left me to Jagang.” Nicci leaned in so that Tovi could see herglare. “You have no idea of the things I’ve had to endure. Since then, I’ve beenon a long mission for His Excellency. He needs information and he knows I canget it.”Tovi smiled. “Makes you whore for him, to find out what he wants to know.”Nicci didn’t answer the question, instead letting it answer itself. “I justhappened to hear about some fool woman who in the process of getting herselfrobbed or something also managed to get herself stabbed. Something about thedescription made me decide to come and check myself to see if it could possiblybe you.”Tovi nodded. “I’m afraid it’s not good.”“I hope it hurts. I came to make sure you’re a long time dying. I want you tosuffer for what you did to me—leaving me in the clutches of Jagang while therest of you escaped without bothering to even tell me how it could be done.”“We couldn’t help it. We had a chance and we had to take it, that’s all.” Acunning grin came to her. “But you can get free of Jagang, too.”Nicci pressed forward. “How—how can I get free?”“Heal me and I’ll tell you.”“You mean, heal you so you can betray me like before. No good, Tovi. You’regoing to tell it all, or I’m going to sit right here and watch you suffer yourway into the Keeper’s eternal embrace. I may trickle in just enough to keep youalive a little longer.” She leaned in. “So you can continue to feel the paintwisting in your guts a little longer.”Tovi seized a fistful of Nicci’s dress. “Please, Sister, help me. It hurts somuch.”“Talk, ‘Sister.’“She released her grip on Nicci’s dress and let her face roll to face away. “It’sthe bond to Lord Rahl. We swore a bond.”“Sister Tovi, if you think I’m that stupid, I’m going to make you suffer just tomake you regret the thought until you die.”She turned back to look at Nicci. “No, it’s true.”“How can you swear a bond to someone you want to eliminate?”Tovi grinned. “Sister Ulicia figured it out. We swore a bond to him, but madehim let us go before he could hold us to a list of his commands.”“This story just gets more preposterous all the time.”Nicci withdrew her hand from Tovi’s arm, and with it the trickle of relief. AsNicci stood, Tovi groaned in agony.“Please, Sister Nicci, it’s true.” She grasped Nicci’s hand. “In exchange forletting us go, we traded for something he wanted.”“What could Lord Rahl possibly want that would convince him to let a clutch ofSisters of the Dark loose? That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”“A woman.”“What?”“He wanted a woman.”“As the Lord Rahl, he can have any woman he wants. He has but to pick her andhave her sent to his bed, unless she would choose the executioner’s blockinstead, and none do. He hardly needs the Sisters of the Dark to cart women tohis bed.”“No, no, not that kind of woman. A woman he loved.”“Right.” Nicci huffed a sigh. “Good-bye, Sister Tovi. Be sure to give the Keeperof the dead my regards when you get there. Sorry, but I’m afraid that meetingwon’t be for a while. I think you look like you may linger for a number of days,yet. Pity.”“Please!” Her arm rotated around, searching for the contact of the one personwho could save her. “Sister Nicci, please. Please listen, and I will tell youeverything.”Nicci sat down and gripped Tovi’s arm again. “All right, Sister, but justremember, the power can go both ways.”Tovi’s back arched as she cried out in agony. “No! Please!”Nicci had no compunction about what she was doing. She knew that there was nomoral equivalence between her inflicting torture and the Imperial Order doingwhat might on the surface seem like the same thing. But her purpose in using itwas solely to save innocent lives. The Imperial Order used torture as a means ofsubjugation and conquest, as a tool to strike fear into their enemies. And, attimes, as something they relished because it made them feel powerful to holdsway over not just agony but life itself.The Imperial Order used torture because they had no regard at all for humanlife. Nicci was using it because she did. While at one time she would have seenno difference, since coming to embrace life she saw all the difference in theworld.Nicci reversed the suffering she was trickling into the old woman and Tovi sankback in grateful, weeping relief.Tovi was covered in a sheen of sweat. “Please, Sister, give me some comfortinstead and I will tell you everything.”“Start with who stabbed you.”“The Seeker.”“Richard Rahl is the Seeker. Do you really think I will believe such a story?Richard Rahl would have taken your head off with one swing.”Tovi’s head rolled side to side. “No, no, you don’t understand. This man had theSword of Truth.” She pointed at her gut. “I ought to know the Sword of Truthwhen it runs me through. He caught me by surprise and before I knew who he wasor what he wanted, the bastard stabbed me.”Nicci pressed her fingers to her brow in confusion. “I think you better go backto the beginning.”Tovi was already sinking into a stupor. Nicci increased the magic flowing intoher, giving her some healing relief without curing her of her injury. Niccididn’t want to cure her, she needed the woman unable to help herself. Tovilooked the kindly grandmother, but she was a viper.Nicci crossed one leg over the other. It was going to be a long night.The next time Tovi came around, Nicci sat up straighter. “So you swore a bond toRichard, as the Lord Rahl,” Nicci said as if there had been no gap in theconversation, “and that protected all of you from the dream walker.”“That’s right.”“And then what?”“We were able to escape. We kept track of Richard as we went about our work forour master. We needed to find a hook.”Nicci knew very well who their master was.“What do you mean, a hook?”“In order to do what we need to do to satisfy the Keeper, we needed a way tomake sure Richard Rahl could not interfere. We found it.”“Found what?”“Something that keeps us bonded to him no matter what we do. It was brilliant.”“So what is it?”“Life.”Nicci frowned, not knowing if she had heard right. She laid a hand on Tovi’swound and gave some focused comfort.After Tovi had calmed from the wave of pain, Nicci asked in a quiet voice, “Whatdo you mean?”“Life,” Tovi said at last. “It is his highest value.”“So?”“Sister, think. In order to stay out of the dream walker’s grasp, we must bebonded to Richard Rahl all the time. We dare not waver for a moment. And yet,who is our ultimate master?”“The Keeper of the dead. We have sworn oaths.”“That’s right. And if we were to do something that would harm Richard’s life,such as loose the Keeper into the world of life, then we would be going againstour bond to Richard. That would mean that before we could free the Keeper fromhis bounds in the world of the dead, Jagang, in this world, would be able topounce on us.”“Sister Tovi, you had better start making sense, or I will lose my patience, andI assure you, you would not like that. You would not like it one bit. I want toknow what’s going on so that I can be let in. I want my place back.”“Of course. Of course. You see, Richard’s highest value is life. In fact, hecreated a statue to it. We were in the Old World. We saw his statue dedicated tolife.”“I got that much out of what you said.”Her head rolled back so she could again look at Nicci. “Well, my dear, what isit we are pledged to do in the Oaths we have given?”“Free the Keeper.”“And what is our reward for performing our task?”Nicci stared at the woman’s cold eyes. “Immortality.”Tovi grinned. “Exactly.”“Richard’s highest value is life. You are saying that you plan to grant himimmortality?”“We are. We are working toward his most noble ideal: life.”“But he may not want immortality.”Tovi managed a shrug. “Maybe. But we don’t intend to ask him. Don’t you see thebrilliance of Sister Ulicia’s plan? We know that his highest value is life. Nomatter what else we may do against his wishes, those things do not rise to thelevel of his most important value. Thus, we are honoring our bond to the LordRahl in the most grand way possible, while maintaining the bond—keeping thedream walker out of our minds—and at the same time working to bring the Keeperinto the world. See how it goes round and round. Each element locks the othersin tighter.”“But it is the Keeper who promises you immortality. You cannot grant it.”“No, not if we seek it through the Keeper.”“Then how can you possibly grant immortality? You don’t have any such power.”“Oh, but we will, we will.”“How?”Tovi fell to coughing and Nicci had to do some swift work on the wound just tokeep the woman alive. It was nearly two hours before she again had her consciousand calm.“Sister Tovi,” she said once the woman had opened her eyes and looked like shewas seeing again. “I’ve had to repair some of your injury. Now, before I canrepair the rest of your wound and fully heal you—so that you can have yourreward of life—I need to know the rest of it. How can you think that you cangrant immortality? You don’t have that power.”“We stole the boxes of Orden. We intend to use them to destroy all life… exceptthat which we wish to have around, of course. With the power of Orden, we willhold sway over life and death. We will have the power to grant Richard Rahlimmortality. See? Bond fulfilled.”Nicci’s head was spinning. “Tovi, your story is too impossible. It’s morecomplicated than you make it.”“Well, there are other parts to the plan. We found catacombs under the Palace ofthe Prophets.”Nicci had had no idea that such catacombs existed, but she wanted the woman togo on with her story, so she just let her talk.“That’s when it all started. When we got the idea. You see, we had beenwandering the lands, looking for ways to satisfy the Keeper—” She clutchedNicci’s arm so hard it hurt. “He comes in our dreams. You know that. He comes toyou as well. He comes and torments us, forcing us to do his bidding, to work tofree him.”Nicci pulled the clawlike hand off her arm. “Catacombs?”“Yes. The catacombs. We discovered ancient catacombs and in them books. We founda book called Chainfire”Goose bumps ran up Nicci’s arms. “Chainfire, what does that mean? Is it aspell?”“Oh, it is much more than anything so simple as a spell. It was from ancienttimes. The wizards of the time had come up with a new theory of how to altermemory—in other words, real events altered with Subtractive power, with all thedisconnected parts spontaneously reconstructed independently of one another.Namely, how to make an individual disappear to everyone else by making peopleforget this person, even as soon as they’ve just seen them.“But the wizards who came up with this theory were timid men, fearful ofunleashing such things not only because they realized that such a linked eventwould cause irreparable damage to the subject, but because there was no way forthem to control it once it was initiated, it would be self-actuating andself-sustaining.”“What do you mean? What does it do?”“It unravels people’s memory of the subject, but that ignition starts a cascadeevent that can’t be predicted or controlled. It then burns through links theyhave with others, and then others those people know, and so on. It eventuallyunravels connections so that it corrupts everything. For our purposes, though,it doesn’t really matter, since our aim is to undo life anyway. For fear that itwould be discovered what we were doing, we destroyed the book, and thecatacombs.”“But why did you need to destroy the memory of someone?”“Not just someone, but the memory of the woman who bought us the bond in thefirst place, Kahlan Amnell, Richard Rahl’s love. By creating a Chainfire event,we ended up with a woman no one remembers.”“But what can that possibly gain you?”“The boxes of Orden. We used her to get the boxes, so that we can free I theKeeper. With the boxes, we can grant Richard immortal life at the same time wealso free the Keeper.“The Keeper whispered to us in our dreams that Richard has the secret to openingthe boxes, he has a necessary knowledge memorized. It exists nowhere else.Darken Rahl revealed it to the Keeper. Richard knows the way to unlock thesecrets of Orden, only this time, we know the trick that defeated Darken Rahl.“The book he knows says that we need a Confessor to open the boxes. And now wehave a Confessor who no one remembers—so no one can bother us about her.”“What about prophecy disappearing? Was that caused by Chainfire?”“It’s part of Chainfire. They called it the Chainfire corollary. Part of theinitiation phase of Chainfire requires that prophecy also be ignited with aChainfire event, much the same as people’s memories are cast into theconflagration. The Chainfire event feeds on those memories to sustain the event,therefore prophecy must be involved as well. A blank is found in the properfork—a place where a prophet left a space, should a future prophet wish tocomplete the work. We then fill in that void in prophecy with a completingprophecy which has the Chainfire formula invested in it. A Chainfire event thusinfects and consumes all the associated prophecy on the branch, starting withrelated prophecy, either in subject or in chronology—in this case both: Kahlan,the woman we wiped away in life, is thus also wiped away in prophecy by theChainfire corollary.”“You seem to have it all worked out,” Nicci said.Tovi grinned through the pain. “It gets better.”“Better? How could it possibly get more delicious than this?”“There is a counter to Chainfire.” Tovi giggled with the glee of it.“A counter? You mean you risk Richard finding a counter to what you have done, acounter that could bring the entire plan crashing down?”Tovi tried to stifle the giggle, but it bubbled up again. Despite the obviouspain, she was enjoying herself too much to stop. “This is the best pail of all.The ancient wizards who came up with the Chainfire theory realized the potentialfor the total destruction of life. So they created a counter, should a Chainfireevent ever somehow come to pass.”Nicci gritted her teeth. “What counter?”“The boxes of Orden.”Nicci’s eyes widened. “The boxes of Orden were created to be the counter to theChainfire event you’ve initiated’?”“That’s right. Isn’t that delicious? What’s more, we’ve put the boxes in play.”Nicci let out a deep breath. “Well, like I said, you seem to have it all figuredout.”Tovi winced. “Well… almost. There is only one minor issue.”“Like what?”“Well, you see, the stupid bitch only brought out one box the first time we senther in. We couldn’t allow the boxes to be seen, because, unlike Richard’s love,people would remember seeing the boxes of Orden.“Kahlan said she had no room in her pack. Sister Ulicia was furious. She beatthe girl to a bloody mess—you would have loved it, Sister Nicci—and told her toleave something out to make room if she hail In, then sent her back in to getthe other two boxes.”Tovi winced under a pang of pain. “We feared to wait, though. Sister Ulicia sentme on with the first box and said she would catch up with us later.” Tovigroaned under the agony of another stitch of pain. “I had the first box with me.The Seeker, the one with Sword of Truth, anyway, surprised me and ran me though.He snatched the box. Once Kahlan finally retrieved them, Sister Ulicia then hadthose two and thought that I had the third, so before she left the palace, sheput the magic of Orden in play.”Nicci staggered to her feet. She felt dizzy. She could hardly believe it. Butshe knew, now, that it was all true. Richard had been right all along. Withalmost nothing to go on, he had basically figured it all out. And all along noone in the world would listen to him… no one in a world that was unravelingaround them in an uncontrolled Chainfire event."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 65A scream that made the fine hairs on the back of Richard’s neck stand on endsplit the quiet night. Richard, in a bedroll in a simple tent, shot to his feetas the scream ripped the air with its terror. The unending shriek ran a shiverup through his shoulders and instantly brought a sheen of sweat to his brow.His heart racing, Richard rushed out of his tent even as the haunting cry echoedthrough the encampment as if trying to reach every corner of darkness to expressits horror.Outside the tent, which was set apart from the others because it was an extra,Richard saw men standing in the darkness, their eyes wide. Up the row a ways,General Meiffert watched out on the night with the rest of them.Richard saw that it was false dawn, like the morning Kahlan had vanished. Thewoman he loved, the woman who everyone else had forgotten and didn’t care toremember. If she had screamed, no one had heard her.And then, as the scream died, the world went blacker than black. It was likebeing plunged into the inky nothingness of the world of the dead, forlorn andforever lost. Richard shivered as his flesh felt like something alien touchedthe world of living with intimate promise.As quickly as the darkness had come, it was gone. Men looked around at oneanother, none speaking.The thought occurred to Richard that the viper now had only three heads.“The Keeper took one of his own,” he explained to the questioning faces that hadall turned to him. He saw the general watching, listening. “Be glad that one soevil is no longer among the living. May all such people find the death theychampion.”Men smiled and whispered agreement with the curse as they began crawling backinto their tents to try to snatch what was left of their sleep.General Meiffert met Richard’s gaze as he clapped a fist to his heart beforevanishing back into his own tent.In the dim light of the camp that suddenly seemed to be populated only by tentsand wagons, Richard spotted Nicci very deliberately heading straight for him.There was something profoundly disturbing about the way she looked. Perhaps itwas that she had just vented a rage that he doubted anyone but he could trulyunderstand or value.Flags of blond hair flying, she reminded him of a raptor descending in on himfrom out of the night, all tight muscle and talons. When he saw the tearsstreaming down her face, her gritted teeth, her fury and hurt, her powerfulmenace and frail helplessness, her eyes filled with more than he could grasp, hestepped back into his tent, drawing her in out of the view of the camp.She swept into the tent, right for him, like a storm breaking on a headland. Hebacked as far as he could, having no idea what was wrong or what she intended.With a sob of such naked desolation that it nearly made him cry out in kind, shefell to the ground at his feet, throwing her arms around his legs. She wasclutching something in one hand. Richard realized that it was Kahlan’s whiteMother Confessor dress.“Oh, Richard, I’m so sorry,” she wailed between racking gasps. “I’m so sorry forwhat I’ve done to you. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry,” she kept mumbling over andover.He reached down and touched her shoulder. “Nicci, what is it?”“I’m so sorry,” she cried as she clutched at his legs as if she were thecondemned begging a king for her life. “Oh, dear spirits, I’m so sorry for whatI’ve done to you.”He sank down, lifting her arms off his legs. “Nicci, what is it?”Her shoulders heaved with her racking sobs. She looked up at him as he liftedher by her arms. She was as limp as the dead.“Oh, Richard, I’m so sorry. I never believed you. I’m so sorry that I neverbelieved you. I should have helped you and instead I fought you every step. I’mso sorry.”He had rarely seen anyone in such profound misery. “Nicci—”“Please,” she sobbed. “Please, Richard, end it now.”“What?”“I don’t want to live anymore. It hurts too much. Please, use your knife and endit. Please. I’m so sorry. I’ve done worse than simply not believe you. I’ve beenthe one who stopped you at every turn.”She hung like a rag doll from his hands under her arms. She wept in utter miseryand defeat.“I’m so sorry I didn’t believe you. You were right about everything and so muchmore. I’m so sorry. It’s all ended now and it’s my fault. I’m so sorry. I shouldhave believed you.”She started to almost melt through his grip. Sitting on the floor in front ofher, he gathered her up into his arms, much like he had gathered up Jillian.“Nicci, you were the only one who made me go on when I was ready to give up. Youwere the only one who made me fight.”Nicci’s arms came up around his neck when he pulled her close. She felt hot fromthe fever of her anguish.She sobbed and kept mumbling how sorry she was, how she should have believed inhim about the rest of it, how it was all too late now, how she wanted to end thepain and die.Richard held her head to his shoulder as he whispered to her that it would beall right, whispered his comfort, rocked her gently and quieted her withoutsaying anything of consequence except in its empathy.He remembered, then, when he had first met Kahlan and they had spent that firstnight in a wayward pine. She had nearly been pulled back into the underworld andhe had drawn her back at the last moment. Kahlan had cried like this, in abjectterror and misery, but more than that, with the release of having someone holdher.Kahlan had never had anyone she valued hold her when she cried.He knew, now, that Nicci never had either.As he held her in his arms, giving her the unopposed comfort she so needed, sheexhausted herself until, feeling safe as perhaps never before, she drifted intosleep. It was such a profound pleasure to be able to give her that rare refugethat he wept silently as he held her and she slept, safe, in his arms.He must have fallen asleep for a brief time because when he opened his eyesthere was pale light coming through the walls of the summer tent. When he liftedhis head, Nicci stirred in his arms, like a child cuddling closer and neverwanting to wake.But she did, rather suddenly when she realized where she was.She looked up into his eyes, her blue eyes weary. “Richard,” she whispered inwhat he knew would be the beginning of the same thing.He pressed his fingertips to her lips, halting her words.“We have a lot of things to deal with. Tell me what you learned so that we canget on with it.”She put the white dress in his hands. “You were right about almost everything,even if you didn’t know the mechanism. Sister Ulicia and her small band wantedto remain free from the dream walker, just as you said. They resolved, since youvalue life, to give you immortality. Anything else they did, no matter howdestructive, they viewed as of secondary importance. This gave them the freedomto pursue freeing the Keeper.”Richard’s eyes went wider as he listened.“They found Chainfire and used it to make everyone forget Kahlan so that theycould steal the boxes of Orden. Your father, in the underworld, let the Keeperknow that you have memorized the book they need. They know that they need aConfessor to obtain the truth. Kahlan accomplishes two tasks, stealing theboxes, and helping to get the truth of the book you know.“Chainfire, not the prophecy worm, is also responsible for what is happening toprophecy.“The Sisters have two of the boxes of Orden and they put them in play. They havelaunched that phase of their plan for two reasons: because they want to useOrden to call the Keeper into the world of life, and because the boxes of Ordenwere created as a counter to the power that can be engendered with Chainfire”Richard blinked. “What do you mean, they only have two boxes? I thought theyused Kahlan to steal all three. All three were in the Garden of Life.”“Kahlan brought out one box. They gave it to Tovi and had her start out whilethey sent Kahlan back in for the other two—”“Sent her back?” Richard frowned. “What are you leaving out?”Nicci licked her lips, but she didn’t break his gaze. “The reason for Tovi’sscream.”Richard felt his eyes watering. A lump rose in his throat.Nicci laid a hand over his heart. “We’ll get her back, Richard.”He clenched his teeth and nodded. “So then what happened?”“The new Seeker surprised Tovi, stabbed her, and stole the box of Orden she wasspiriting away from the People’s Palace.”“We have to start a search. They can’t have gone far.”“They are long gone, Richard. Just like they covered their tracks when they tookKahlan, they will have done the same this time. That is not the way to findthem.”Richard looked up. “Samuel. The Sword of Truth was a counter. When I gave himthe sword, he must have recognized the truth about Kahlan.” His gaze roved theinside of the tent as he tried to think. “We need to think this through. Collectall the information we can and get ahead of them, instead of always being behindthem.”“I’ll help you, Richard. Anything you want, I will do. I will help you get herback. She belongs with you. I know that now.”He nodded, thankful that her iron was back. “I think we had better set somethings straight and then get some experienced help.”She smiled a crooked smile. “That’s the Seeker I know.”Outside the tent, men had begun to gather, all wanting to see the Lord Rahl.Out of the crowd came Verna. “Richard! Thank the Creator—our prayers have beenanswered!” She threw her arms around him. “Richard how are you?”“Where have you been?”“I was tending to some injured men. Scouts, who met a few of the enemy. GeneralMeiffert sent word for me to return at once.”“And the men?”“Fine,” she said with a smile. “Now that you are finally with us for the finalbattle.”He took up her hands. “Verna, you know you have had a hard time with me in thepast.”She grinned as she nodded that it was true. When she saw that he wasn’t smiling,her smile faded. “This is going to be one of those times,” he told her. “You aregoing to have to believe in me and what I say, or we might as well give up tothe Order right now.”Richard let go of her hand and climbed up on a crate to be better heard. Herealized that a sea of men surrounded him.Cara and General Meiffert were right near the front. “Lord Rahl, will you beable to lead us?” he asked.“No,” he called out into the still dawn air.Worried whispers spread back through the men. Richard held up his arms.“Listen to me!” They quieted. “I don’t have much time. I don’t have the time toexplain things as I wish I could. That is the way it is. I will give you thefacts, and I will let you decide.“The army of the Imperial Order has been slowed a bit down south.” Richard heldup his hands to stifle the cheers. “I don’t have much time. Listen, now.“You men are the steel against steel. I am the magic against magic. I now mustpick one of those two for the coming battle.“If I stay here and lead you, fight with you, then we are not going to have muchof a chance. The enemy forces are huge. I don’t need to tell any of you men thatmuch. If I stay and help you fight them, most of us will die.”“I can tell you right off,” General Meiffert said, “that I don’t like thatchoice.”Most of the men agreed that the grim picture he had just painted was notsomething they relished.“What’s the alternative?” a man nearby called out.“The alternative is that I let you men do your job and present the steel to keepthe Order from choosing instead to run rampant through our lands.“Meanwhile, I pledge to do my job of being the magic against magic. I will dowhat only I can and work to find a way to defeat the enemy without any of youmen having to lose your life in battle with them. I want to find a way, with mypower, to banish or destroy them before we have to fight them.“I can’t guarantee that I will succeed. If I fail, I will die in the attempt andyou men will have to face the enemy.”“Do you think you can stop them with magic of some sort?” Another man asked?Nicci jumped up beside him. “Lord Rahl has already set people in the Old Worldagainst Jagang’s forces. We have fought battles in their own homeland in thehopes of taking away their support.“If you insist on keeping Lord Rahl here, with you, then you are wasting hissingular talent, and you might die as a result. I ask, as one who fights at hisside, that you let him be the Lord Rahl, let him do as he must, while you do asyou must.”“I couldn’t say it any better,” Richard told them. “There it is, then. That isthe choice I give you.”Unexpectedly, men began going to their knees. Far and wide dust rose as menshuffled to make space to kneel down.In one voice, the chant began.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In yourlight we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled.We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.”Richard watched out over the sea of men as the sun broke the horizon. Thedevotion was repeated a second time, and then a third time, as was customary inthe field. Once it was done, men began to return to their feet.“I guess that’s your answer, Lord Rahl,” General Meiffert said. “Go get thebastards.”The men cheered their agreement.Richard hopped down and took Nicci’s hand to help her down. She ignored the handand jumped down of her own accord. Richard turned to Cara.“Well, I have to go. We’re in a hurry. Look, Cara, I want you to know that Iwould be fine with it if you would like to stay with… the army.”A dark frown descended over Cara as she folded her arms. “Are you crazy?” Shelooked up over her shoulder at the general. “I told you, the man is crazy. Seewhat I have to put up with?”General Meiffert nodded seriously. “I don’t know how you do it, Cara.”“Training,” she confided. She trailed her fingertips across his cheek, smilingup at him in a way Richard had never seen her do before. “Take care of yourself,General.”“Yes, ma’am.” He smiled at Nicci before bowing his head. “As per your orders,Mistress Nicci.”Richard’s mind was already elsewhere. “Come on. Let’s get going.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 66Marching down the frame and panel hall, Rikka leading the way, Cara and Nicci intow, Richard reached the intersection and turned down a stone passageway with atowering vaulted ceiling that soared up for nearly two hundred feet. Flutedcolumns to the sides rose up at evenly spaced intervals. Through large windowsat the top the massive exterior buttresses that supported the lofty walls couldbe seen. Streamers of light angled in high overhead and from small round windowsdown lower. Their boot strikes echoed like hammers through the cold hall.Richard’s cape that looked like it was made from spun gold billowed behind himas if in a gathering storm. The gold symbols around the black tunic fairlyglowed in the muted light. Passing each shaft of sunlight, the silver emblems inhis boots, on his wide, multilayered leather belt, and on his leather-paddedwristbands sent blades of light flashing around them, announcing the arrival ofa war wizard.The fury of any Mord-Sith was enough to cause most people’s blood to pause intheir veins, but cold anger on Cara’s attractive features seemed capable ofturning that stilled blood to ice. To his other side the former Death’s Mistressin black looked no less formidable. From the first time he’d met her, Richardcould almost hear the air around Nicci crackle with her power and it was doingthat now.Richard passed padded chairs and tables set in niches. Carpets at angles stuckpartly into the hall in places, inviting people into quiet, cozy nooks. Richardskirted the carpets because the sounds of his boots on polished granite suitedhim. None of those with him walked across the carpets, either. With thereverberation coming back at them from the long hall, the sound built until itsounded almost like an invading army pouring through the Keep.Rikka turned to him without slowing. She gestured to the right. “They’re inhere, Lord Rahl.”Richard cut the corner without slowing, aiming his march through the center ofthe huge double doors that stood open into the exquisite library. Heavy oakmullions crosshatched in the doors divided them into a dozen glass panes each.There were shelves to the ceiling on the thirty-foot back wall of the library,with ladders that rode on brass rails to provide access. Massive mahoganypillars stood gleaming in the streamers of sunlight coming in from high windows.But down low, the light was more gloomy and had to be cut with lamps.An enormous mahogany table with turned legs that were each bigger around thanRichard sat opposite the doors. To each side pillars rose to support vaultsoverhead. The ends of the room to the far left and right were left to theshadows.Ann looked astonished. “Richard! What are you doing here? You are supposed to bewith our troops.”Richard ignored her as he grasped the red leather book he had tucked under anarm. He used the book like a broom to sweep aside the sprawl of books laidbefore them, creating a broad, polished, empty spot before the three giftedpeople.Richard tossed the red, leather-bound book on table. It made a smacking soundthat echoed almost like a clap of thunder.The gold lettering, Chainfire, gleamed in the gloom.“What’s this?” Zedd asked in dismay.“Proof,” Richard said. “Part of it anyway. I promised to bring back proof.”“It’s an ancient book,” Nicci told them. “A formula for creating what is calleda Chainfire event.”Zedd’s hazel eyes turned up. “What is a Chainfire event?”“The end of the world as we know it,” Richard said with grim finality. “Whatthey were doing turned out to inadvertently involve an attempt to create acontradiction, violating the Ninth Rule. They finally realized that if anyoneever actually undertook to initiate a Chainfire event, it would have cataclysmicconsequences.”Nathan frowned at Nicci, apparently hoping for a little more wisdom andexperience from a former Sister. “What is he talking about?”“Wizards in ancient times came up with a new theory on how to alter memory withSubtractive power, with all the resulting disconnected parts spontaneouslyreconstructed independently of one another—the creation of erroneous memory tofill in the voids that had been destroyed. They were studying the theory of howto make an individual disappear to everyone else by making people forget thisperson, even as soon as they’ve just seen them. Even as they look at them.“It unravels people’s memory of the subject, but it was discovered that theignition of such an event starts a cascade that can’t be predicted orcontrolled. Much like a wildfire, it continues to burn through links with otherswhose memory has not been altered. It eventually unravels the world of lifeitself.”“And the prophecy worm?” Richard asked. “It may be real, but the cause of theprophecy vanishing this time is Chainfire. As part of the process, the personwho initiates the event also fills in a void in prophecy, a place left blank bya prophet for future work. This gap is filled in with a completing prophecywhich has the Chainfire formula invested in it. A Chainfire event thus infectsand consumes all the associated prophecy on the branch, starting with relatedprophecy, either in subject or in chronology—in this case both: Kahlan. Thus,she is also wiped out of prophecy by what is called the Chainfire corollary.”Nathan sat down heavily. “Dear spirits.”Ann, hands in her opposite sleeves, did not look pleased or impressed. “All welland good, and we will have to study this book and see if anything you’ve come upwith even begins to make sense.“But that book is not the immediate problem.“You should have stayed with our men. You must lead our troops in the finalbattle. You must return at once. Prophecy is quite clear. Prophecy says that ifyou fail to do this, the world will fall under the shadow.”Richard ignored Ann and met his grandfather’s gaze. “Guess what the counter isto a Chainfire event.”Zedd shrugged, looking puzzled by Richard’s line of questioning. “How would Iknow?”“There is only one. It was created specifically for this purpose.”“What was?” Zedd asked.“The boxes of Orden.”Zedd’s mouth fell open. “Richard, that just isn’t—”Richard reached into his pocket and pulled out what he had brought. He slammedit down on the table before the three of them.Zedd’s eyes went wide. “Bags, Richard, that’s a snake vine.”“You may recall from The Book of Counted Shadows: And when the three boxes ofOrden are put into play, the snake vine shall grow.”“But, but,” Zedd stammered, “the boxes of Orden are in the Garden of Life, inthe People’s Palace, under incredibly heavy guard.”“Not only that,” Nathan put in, “but I personally equipped the men of the FirstFile with weapons that are deadly even against the gifted. No one could get inthere.”“I agree,” Zedd insisted. “It’s impossible.”Richard turned and carefully took what Cara had been carrying. He gently set thestatue of Spirit down so that the figure was facing the three on the other sideof the table, as if she were holding her head high in opposition to theirefforts to make her a delusion.“This is Kahlan’s. She left it there, in the Garden of Life, in place of theboxes, so that someone would know she exists. The Chainfire spell erased herfrom everyone’s memory. Those who see her forget her before she even registersin their minds.”Ann waved a hand over the book, the vine, and the statue. “But this, this, thisis all still conjecture, Richard. Who in the world could even have dreamed upsuch a plot?”“Sister Ulicia hatched the plan,” Nicci said. “She had Sisters Cecilia, Armina,and Tovi with her.”Ann frowned. “How do you know this?”“Tovi confessed to me.”Ann looked more than astonished. “Confessed… Why would she do such a thing? Howdid you even catch her?”“She was fleeing with one of the boxes of Orden.” Richard said. “She wasambushed by the man I gave the Sword of Truth to. He stabbed her and stole thebox of Orden she was carrying.”Zedd slapped his forehead, unable to speak, and thumped down into his chair.“Tovi also told me,” Nicci said, “that they were here, in Aydindril, and plantedthat corpse in the Mother Confessor’s grave to make sure no one believedRichard, should he happen to try digging it up to convince people he was tellingthe truth. They got the dress out of the Confessors’ Palace. They wanted to makesure everyone thought Richard was deluded.“Regarding that, I think you should also know that we traveled to the ruins of acity called Caska, down in southern D’Hara. Imperial Order scouts were there. Iconducted an experiment on one of them. I used the Subtractive spell all of youwanted me to use to ‘cure’ Richard of his supposed delusions.”Ann cautiously cocked her head. “And?”“He didn’t live more than a few moments.”Zedd, nearly as white now as his unruly hair, put his face in his hands.“I’m sure that some of this will prove quite… useful,” Ann said, looking ratherconfused, “and it’s good that you have uncovered it. But as I said, the factremains that you need to be with our troops, Richard. We revealed to you thatvitally important prophecy: ‘If fuer grissa ost drauka does not lead this finalbattle, then the world, already standing at the brink of darkness, will fallunder that terrible shadow.’“These other matters you bring up are intriguing, to be sure, but the prophecyremains our most important mission. We simply can’t fail or the world will fallunder the shadow.”Richard gripped his temples between his thumb and second finger as he lookeddown, trying to gather patience. He reminded himself that these people weretrying to do what was right.He looked up, meeting their gazes. “Don’t you see?” He pointed at the snake vineon the table. “This is the final battle. The Sisters of the Dark have put theboxes of Orden in play. They intend to bring the Keeper of the dead into theworld of the living. They intend to give life over to death in a bid to gainimmortality for themselves. The world stands at the brink of darkness.“Don’t you see? If you three had had your way, bent on enforcing prophecy, andtried to live by words you believed to be foreordained, I would not havesurvived the attempt to ‘cure’ me. I would be dead. In attempting to fulfillprophecy, you would have insured the success of the Sisters of the Dark, and theend of all life. The world of life would have ended because of you.“Only free will—Nicci’s free will, my free will—has prevented what you threewould have brought upon mankind in following your blind faith in prophecy.”Ann, the last one standing, dropped into her chair.“Dear spirits, he’s right,” Zedd whispered to himself. “The Seeker has justsaved three old fools from themselves.”“No. None of you are fools,” Richard said. “We all can do foolish things fromtime to time by not thinking. The thing to do then is to recognize a mistake andnot repeat it. Learn from it. Don’t allow yourself to fail the next time. I’mnot here to tell you that you are fools, because I know you’re not. I’m herebecause I need your help. I want you to start using your minds. You are allbrilliant in your own way. You each have knowledge that probably no one elsealive has.“The woman I love, the woman I’m married to, has been kidnapped by Sisters ofthe Dark and had a Chainfire event unleashed on her life. That event is nowburning through the lives of everyone who knew her and will eventually consumeeveryone living.”He gestured to the statue of Spirit. “I carved that of your granddaughter’sspirit, Zedd. It was precious to her. She left it there, on that stone altar,covered in her blood. I want her back.“I need help. Neither Nicci nor Cara remembers Kahlan, but they both know thetruth of the fact that they don’t remember her because of what’s in this book,Chainfire, not because she doesn’t exist. You all lost something incrediblyprecious when your memory of Kahlan was taken from you. You lost a value in yourlives that you could not begin to replace. You lost one of the best…”Richard had to stop because he couldn’t get the words past the constriction inhis throat. Tears dripped from his face onto the table.Nicci came close and put a hand on his shoulder. “It will be all right, Richard.We’ll get her back.”Cara laid a hand on his other shoulder. “That’s right, Lord Rahl. We’ll get herback.”Richard nodded, unable to speak as his chin trembled.Zedd rose up. “Richard, I hope you don’t think we will fail you again. We won’t.You have my word as First Wizard.”“I’d rather have your word as my grandfather.”Zedd smiled through his own tears. “That, too, my boy. That, too.”Nathan shot to his feet. “My sword’s in play as well, my boy.”Ann scowled at him. “Your sword is in play? What in the world does that mean?”“Well, you know,” Nathan said, swirling his hand in a display of cut and thrust.“It means I will fight the good fight.”“The good fight? How about if you help us find Kahlan.”“Well, bags, woman—”Ann shot a look at Zedd. “Did you teach him to talk like that? He never cursedlike that before he spent time with you.”Zedd shrugged innocently. “My goodness, no. Not me.”Ann scowled at the wizard on each side of her before looking at Richard andsmiling.“I remember when you were first born, Richard. When you were a bundle of life inyour mother’s arms. She was so proud of you then just for being able to cry.Well, I guess she’d be pretty proud of you now. We all are, Richard.”Zedd wiped his nose on his sleeve. “How true.”“If you can forgive us,” Ann said, “we’d like to be a part of stopping thisthreat. I, for one, am quite keen to take care of those Sisters.”Nicci squeezed Richard’s shoulder. “I think you may have a fight on your handsover that. I think we’d all like to be the one to get at them.”Cara leaned past Richard. “Sure, easy for you to say. You got to kill SisterTovi.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 67Richard stood at the crenellation in the rampart, one foot resting on the lowstone, gazing out across the sunlit scene of Aydindril down below the mountain,watching the puffy white clouds parade their shadows across the valley.Zedd came up from behind and stood beside Richard, and for a time also watchedout in silence.“I can’t remember Kahlan,” he finally said. “Try as I might, I just can’t.”“I know,” Richard answered without looking over.“But for her to be your wife, she must be a remarkable woman.”Richard couldn’t help smiling. “She is that.”Zedd laid a bony hand on Richard’s shoulder. “We’ll find her, my boy. I’m goingto help you. We’re going to find her. I promise you that.”Grinning, Richard put his arm around his grandfather’s shoulders. “Thanks, Zedd.I could surely use the help.”Zedd held up a finger. “We’ll get started right away.”“Right away would suit me,” Richard told him. “I’m going to need to get me asword, too.”“Ah, well, the sword isn’t important. The sword is just a tool. The Seeker isthe weapon, and I’d say you are still the Seeker.”“About that, Zedd. You know, I’ve been thinking, and I’ve come to believe thatmaybe Shota wasn’t acting selfishly by demanding the sword in exchange for whatshe told me.”“How do you figure that?”“Well, the Sword of Truth draws from my gift. When I use my gift, such as thatday we were down in the library and I read from a book of prophecy, it has thevery real potential to call the beast to me.”Zedd rubbed his smooth chin. “Well, I guess that’s true. Maybe in a way that didhelp to protect you.” He scowled at Richard. “But she gave it to Samuel! He’s athief!”“And what did he steal since he got the sword back?”Zedd peered at Richard with one eye. “Steal? I don’t know. What do you mean?”“He near to killed a Sister of the Dark and took the box of Orden she had,preventing the Sisters from having all three so that they can invoke the magicof Orden.”Zedd’s scowl deepened. “And just what do you suppose that little thief is goingto do with the box?”Richard shrugged. “I don’t know, but at least he bought us some time. We can goafter him, now, and prevent the Sisters from having all three boxes, at least.”Zedd scratched the hollow of his cheek as he gave Richard a sidelong glance.“Kind of reminds a fellow of the last time, doesn’t it… with Darken Rahl havingto get the last box.”Richard frowned over at his grandfather. “What are you saying?”Zedd shrugged. “Nothing. I’m just saying.”“Saying what?”“Like I said, kind of reminds one of the last time, that’s all.” Zedd clappedRichard on the shoulder. “Well, come on. Rikka has dinner ready. We’ll all get agood meal before we lay out some ideas for how to proceed.”“That sounds great to me.”“How do you know? I haven’t even told you what she’s cooking.”“No, I mean… Never mind. Let’s go.”"},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsChapter 1 [../Text/Chainfire_split_001.html#filepos665]Chapter 2 [../Text/Chainfire_split_001.html#filepos17103]Chapter 3 [../Text/Chainfire_split_002.html#filepos47768]Chapter 4 [../Text/Chainfire_split_003.html#filepos75232]Chapter 5 [../Text/Chainfire_split_004.html#filepos103965]Chapter 6 [../Text/Chainfire_split_005.html#filepos133677]Chapter 7 [../Text/Chainfire_split_006.html#filepos162981]Chapter 8 [../Text/Chainfire_split_007.html#filepos188037]Chapter 9 [../Text/Chainfire_split_008.html#filepos232100]Chapter 10 [../Text/Chainfire_split_009.html#filepos251454]Chapter 11 [../Text/Chainfire_split_010.html#filepos265865]Chapter 12 [../Text/Chainfire_split_011.html#filepos300628]Chapter 13 [../Text/Chainfire_split_012.html#filepos327603]Chapter 14 [../Text/Chainfire_split_013.html#filepos358410]Chapter 15 [../Text/Chainfire_split_014.html#filepos379686]Chapter 16 [../Text/Chainfire_split_015.html#filepos417826]Chapter 17 [../Text/Chainfire_split_016.html#filepos448931]Chapter 18 [../Text/Chainfire_split_017.html#filepos461493]Chapter 19 [../Text/Chainfire_split_018.html#filepos479438]Chapter 20 [../Text/Chainfire_split_019.html#filepos490717]Chapter 21 [../Text/Chainfire_split_020.html#filepos509694]Chapter 22 [../Text/Chainfire_split_021.html#filepos539910]Chapter 23 [../Text/Chainfire_split_022.html#filepos561568]Chapter 24 [../Text/Chainfire_split_023.html#filepos577534]Chapter 25 [../Text/Chainfire_split_024.html#filepos599962]Chapter 26 [../Text/Chainfire_split_025.html#filepos634367]Chapter 27 [../Text/Chainfire_split_026.html#filepos659937]Chapter 28 [../Text/Chainfire_split_027.html#filepos675716]Chapter 29 [../Text/Chainfire_split_028.html#filepos691524]Chapter 30 [../Text/Chainfire_split_029.html#filepos723997]Chapter 31 [../Text/Chainfire_split_030.html#filepos752026]Chapter 32 [../Text/Chainfire_split_031.html#filepos792245]Chapter 33 [../Text/Chainfire_split_032.html#filepos823890]Chapter 34 [../Text/Chainfire_split_033.html#filepos837883]Chapter 35 [../Text/Chainfire_split_034.html#filepos864971]Chapter 36 [../Text/Chainfire_split_035.html#filepos880491]Chapter 37 [../Text/Chainfire_split_036.html#filepos902483]Chapter 38 [../Text/Chainfire_split_037.html#filepos926132]Chapter 39 [../Text/Chainfire_split_038.html#filepos943669]Chapter 40 [../Text/Chainfire_split_039.html#filepos957927]Chapter 41 [../Text/Chainfire_split_040.html#filepos993555]Chapter 42 [../Text/Chainfire_split_041.html#filepos1033826]Chapter 43 [../Text/Chainfire_split_042.html#filepos1062006]Chapter 44 [../Text/Chainfire_split_043.html#filepos1078489]Chapter 45 [../Text/Chainfire_split_044.html#filepos1115580]Chapter 46 [../Text/Chainfire_split_045.html#filepos1136517]Chapter 47 [../Text/Chainfire_split_046.html#filepos1164724]Chapter 48 [../Text/Chainfire_split_047.html#filepos1193364]Chapter 49 [../Text/Chainfire_split_048.html#filepos1219825]Chapter 50 [../Text/Chainfire_split_049.html#filepos1236524]Chapter 51 [../Text/Chainfire_split_050.html#filepos1260181]Chapter 52 [../Text/Chainfire_split_051.html#filepos1280532]Chapter 53 [../Text/Chainfire_split_052.html#filepos1315451]Chapter 54 [../Text/Chainfire_split_053.html#filepos1340557]Chapter 55 [../Text/Chainfire_split_054.html#filepos1375455]Chapter 56 [../Text/Chainfire_split_055.html#filepos1398562]Chapter 57 [../Text/Chainfire_split_056.html#filepos1431876]Chapter 58 [../Text/Chainfire_split_057.html#filepos1452689]Chapter 59 [../Text/Chainfire_split_058.html#filepos1479343]Chapter 60 [../Text/Chainfire_split_059.html#filepos1506881]Chapter 61 [../Text/Chainfire_split_060.html#filepos1527669]Chapter 62 [../Text/Chainfire_split_061.html#filepos1547302]Chapter 63 [../Text/Chainfire_split_062.html#filepos1559105]Chapter 64 [../Text/Chainfire_split_063.html#filepos1582900]Chapter 65 [../Text/Chainfire_split_064.html#filepos1616178]Chapter 66 [../Text/Chainfire_split_065.html#filepos1633851]Chapter 67 [../Text/Chainfire_split_066.html#filepos1650880]"}]
