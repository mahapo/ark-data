The sunken eyeballs had turned to jelly. The jaws hung slack,gaping unnaturally wide because of the hideous scars that had slashed the cheeksall the way back to the hinge of the jaw.Nicci did not at first smell the decay in the thin, cool mountain air. Dressedin her trim black travel dress, she stood back and regarded the four severedheads propped on high wooden poles, two on each side of the rocky road.“The preservation spell is fading,” she said clinically, not afraid. The sightof death had never impressed her. “I don’t know how long these heads have stoodhere as a warning, but they will fall apart soon. More birds and flies willcome.” The chill breeze ruffled her blond hair as she turned to her companions.Next to her, Nathan Rahl propped a hand on the ornate pommel of his sword as hestepped closer to the gruesome display. Formerly a prophet and a wizard, Nathanhad lost both of those abilities after the star shift, when Richard had sealedthe veil of the underworld. That fundamental change in the universe hadeliminated prophecy and reset the rules of magic, with as-yet-unknownconsequences.“I thought the Norukai were ugly enough in life.” He stroked his clean-shavenchin with thumb and forefinger. “Death has not improved their appearance.”Nicci remembered when the ruthless scarred raiders attacked the fishing villageof Renda Bay. The brutal slavers had killed many, burned part of the town, andseized captives. Their ships, featuring fearsome carved sea serpents at theirprows, had been sleek and powerful, their midnight-blue sails guided by magic.To make their faces look more like serpents, the Norukai intentionally slashedtheir mouths wider, sewed up their cut cheeks, and tattooed scales on theirskin. Through wild and unbridled use of magic, Nicci had driven the hideousraiders away from Renda Bay, while Nathan and their young companion Bannon hadfought with swords. Defeated, the Norukai had retreated out to sea.A question loomed before them as Nicci and her companions descended the faintroad out of the high country. Why were these severed heads here, so deep inlandon the far side of the mountains? That made no sense to Nicci.“I hate the Norukai,” Bannon muttered as he stared. His low voice sounded muchlike the growl emitted by Mrra, the restless sand panther who paced near therotting heads. “I hate them for what they did to the poor people of Renda Bay,but I hate them even more for when they raided Chiriya Island and took my friendIan.” His voice hitched. “And they tried to take me, too.…” He wipedperspiration from his freckled forehead and pulled back his long red hair.With an angry kick, Bannon knocked down the nearest pole. The uprooted pole fellover slowly, and the severed head tumbled to the ground, striking a rock besidethe trail with a hollow crack. The jaw split open and fell off. With thepreservation spell disrupted, the long-stalled decay set in swiftly, making upfor lost time.Nicci watched the stinking skin liquefy and run off the skull like tallow. Theeyeballs pooled and glistened, then also soaked into the dirt, leaving only astain of putrefaction.Having knocked down the head, Bannon at first looked queasy; then his facehardened with satisfaction. He turned toward the other three poles, reaching outto do the same, but Nathan held up a hand.“Now, my boy, perhaps we should think this through. Whoever placed this warningmust have done so for good reason. And as you well know, the slavers are nofriends of ours.” His nostrils narrowed, but he did not seem at all bothered bythe ghastly sight or repulsive stench. “It suggests that whoever stuck theseheads on the posts might be our allies … or at least the enemies of our enemies.We wouldn’t want to spark their ire.”Bannon nervously rested his hand on the hilt of his serviceable sword, Sturdy.“Sweet Sea Mother, I wasn’t thinking.”“Not thinking—ah, that is the bane of many an adventurer,” Nathan said with asupportive smile. “And we have many adventures ahead of us.”Nicci said in a harder tone, “My companions should always think before they act.It will save us a great deal of trouble in the long run.”Beside her, the sand panther ventured close to the remains of thenow-disintegrated head, curled her whiskers in a disgusted sniff, and growledagain. Her long tail lashed from side to side. The symbols branded into Mrra’stan hide bore a strange resemblance to the exotic letters scrawled on thewarning placards at the base of the other poles.Without further comment Nicci gazed down the switchbacked mountain road, a pathonce well-traveled but now overgrown. The road hooked around outcroppings andwound over the next ridge, descending toward their destination—an unexpected andmagnificent city they had glimpsed from the high pass of Kol Adair … a wondrousplace that seemed to vanish and reappear like a mirage.The smell of decay turned her stomach sour. “Rather than stopping for a middaymeal, I suggest we eat pack food as we walk. We have miles to cover beforenightfall.”“I am indeed excited to find the city,” Nathan said. “Even if we still don’tknow what we need to do when we get there.”“But we’re willing to try,” Bannon said. “If it helps you get your gift back, wecan all celebrate.”Nathan swung his pack down off a shoulder to remove some of the dried meat theyhad carried since Cliffwall. “Don’t forget, my boy, finding that city might alsobe an important part of Nicci’s mission to save the world.”The sorceress made an unkind sound, glancing back at him with her piercing blueeyes before striding away from the three remaining heads. “I never put too muchstock in what a witch woman commands me to do. Predictions and pronouncementsmay well come true, but never in the way one expects.” She looked at thewhite-haired former wizard. “You assumed you would be able to use magic againthe moment we reached Kol Adair, but that turned out to be only a first step.”“Ah, but now we know the truth of Red’s statement,” Nathan said. “We assumed …and assumptions benefit no one. Her words in my life book promised that from KolAdair I would behold what I need to make myself whole again. I simply didn’t payclose enough attention. Now we understand the true meaning of what she wrote.”“Or at least the next step of what she meant,” Nicci said. Thoughts of themysterious witch woman filled her with distaste.Before they had departed from the Dark Lands on their long mission, Red hadwritten in the mysterious book she gave to the old wizard:Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard willbehold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must savethe world.“Your part seems pretty clear,” Bannon said as he caught up to Nicci. “Yourmission is to save the world. What could be more important than that? We have tofollow instructions.”She paused on the path while Mrra ranged into the hills, hunting on her own.Nicci said to the young man, “The right sort of person doesn’t need an obscureprophecy to tell her to save the world. The right sort of person would do itbecause it is the proper thing to do. She would do it for Lord Rahl.…” Niccisquared her shoulders, brushed dust from the black fabric of her billowingskirts. “And I am the right sort of person.”A powerful sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, Nicci now swore her life andher abilities to the cause of Richard Rahl. She loved him like no other, andwould never love any other, but she had resigned herself to the fact that hisone true love was Kahlan. It was a love against which no other woman, includingNicci, could ever compete.But Nicci could still give him her unwavering loyalty.Back in D’Hara, Richard and Kahlan were both concerned when Nathan proclaimedthat he wanted to help the people in the war-torn Dark Lands. The old wizard hadbeen imprisoned in the Palace of the Prophets for a thousand years, consideredtoo dangerous to be free. But after escaping, he had fought hard on behalf ofD’Hara. He had asked to be sent off on an adventure with the excuse of callinghimself the roving ambassador for D’Hara.Though the tall, handsome wizard was no fool, in many ways he was like a childin search of excitement. Knowing he was bound to get into trouble, Richard hadasked Nicci to accompany him as his bodyguard and protector. She would dowhatever Richard asked her to do, even if it cost her own life. Nicci hadrealized that her best way of serving the man she loved, and saving herself, wasto go away—far away—and be independent. She would help rebuild the world, secureand strengthen the far-flung corners of the D’Haran Empire. In that way shewould help Richard. In that way she could love Richard.Eventually the D’Haran peacekeeping army would spread south to establishbeachheads and outposts. In the meantime, Nicci was like a scout, a one-womanvanguard strong enough and confident enough to take care of problems in theseoutlying territories. If she did her job properly—and she intended to—Lord Rahland his army would not need to intervene.…The pines thinned as the hills opened up, and the terrain became chaparral,rolling grassy slopes scattered with ferocious thistles that were nearly as tallas trees; the enormous purple thistle flowers attracted fat bumblebees. Islandsof low, dark-leaved oaks filled the hollows and ran up some hillsides. A sprayof grasshoppers clicked and leaped out of the way as the travelers trudgedthrough tufts of grass. A snake slithered away in the underbrush, curling andcoiling as it disappeared into a thicket.With Mrra ranging ahead, the three travelers spent most of that day descendingthe primary ridge. They camped for the night in a sheltered valley by afast-running stream. Bannon managed to catch five small trout, and even thoughit was barely enough to make a meal for the three of them, the young man tossedthe two smallest fish to Mrra. The sand panther regarded him with cautiousgratitude, then tore into their silvery scaled sides.Nathan hunched close to the crackling fire Nicci had ignited with her magic.“How many days do you think it’ll take for us to reach that city, Sorceress?”“You’re assuming the city even exists,” she said. From Kol Adair, they had seenthe elaborate skyline, the high towers, the geometrical rooftops … but then theimage had vanished. “It could just be an illusion, or a projection fromelsewhere.”Nathan shook his head, sank his chin into his hand. “We must believe it is real!That’s what I beheld from Kol Adair, as Red’s words said—therefore, it isrequired to exist. The witch woman said so. We will keep walking as far as weneed to.” His azure eyes turned away, as if in shame. “I have to get my giftback, and at present that is our only clue.”Bannon spread his cloak on the ground and curled up on the soft leaves near thestream. “Of course we’re going to the city, so let’s get rested.” He yawned.“Shall I take the second watch?”Nicci arranged a sleeping spot for herself. “No need,” she said, as Mrra lockedfeline eyes with her own. She and the sand panther were spell-bonded, connectedin ways no one else could understand. “Mrra will guard us, so we can rest well.No harm will come to this camp. She’ll warn us of any danger.”* * *Next morning, they toiled up the tree-covered slope to the next ridge, regainingthe hard-fought elevation they had lost the day before while descending into thevalley. They worked their way back and forth up the steepening path to thecrest. Nicci was sure the mysterious city should be just past this last ridge,on the broad plain that extended beyond the foothills.By noon, after fighting their way through trackless oaks and sparse spruce, theytopped the high point. Once the trees cleared enough for them to get the fullview, they looked ahead as the vista opened out before them.“Dear spirits!” Nathan whispered. Bannon stared, rubbed his eyes, and continuedto stare.Beyond the foothills they could see an open plain that ended abruptly at a sheerdrop-off to a wide river, as if the landscape had been torn and then separatedvertically.But there was no city. No city at all. The great and fantastical metropolis theyhad seen from Kol Adair was not there.The plain was not empty, however. What they did see was an army—a vast army thatspread across the foothills and the plain in a blur of human figures in numbersto rival the largest force Nicci had ever seen when she served Emperor Jagang.She knew full well how much destruction such an army could cause.She squinted into the distance, taking in the alarming sight. “That must be halfa million fighting men.”Bannon touched the hilt of his sword, as if considering how many of them hecould fight single-handedly. “Then I’m very glad you’re here to save the world,Sorceress.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 2 [contents.xhtml#c_ch2]Standing on the ridge far from the unexpected army, Nicci took her timeassessing the situation, considering what to do next. “This could be a problem.”With irrational optimism, Nathan adjusted the ornate sword at his side. “Ormaybe not. A conflict has two sides, and as far as I know we’re not a party toeither. We have no enemies here, so deep in the Old World. We’re just travelersfrom afar, and we pose no threat.”Nicci shook her head, standing close to a low, bent oak. “If I were theircommander, I wouldn’t take the chance. I’d assume that any wanderers might bespies.”“But we’re not,” Bannon said. “We’re innocents.”Sometimes Nicci found the young man’s naiveté refreshing, other times annoying.“Why worry about a few dead innocents, if it protects a military campaign?”When Jagang’s army had been on the move and blundered into guiltless travelerswho found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, Nicci had dealt withthe matter herself … and it had never turned out well for those travelers.Nathan bit his lower lip. “But we don’t know, Sorceress. This army could be thesame people who put the heads of those Norukai on stakes and therefore they arethe enemies of the slavers. And if that is the case, I’d happily call themallies.”Nicci gripped one of the gnarled, lichen-patched oak branches, feeling theroughness against her palm. “I don’t want to take the risk. We need to becautious until we learn more.”While gazing ahead, Nathan absently touched the center of his chest, as iftrying to find the missing gift inside himself. He hung so much hope on theobscure writing in his life book, on his need to find the mysterious city thathad somehow vanished. “But if there’s a chance, we have to go there, find outwhat happened to the city. Maybe one of those soldiers knows. Then I can learnwhy I lost my gift.”Nicci turned her gaze toward Nathan. “Did I tell you what the Sisters of theDark believed was the surest way to strip a wizard of his power? Skin him aliveso that the magic could bleed out of him, drop by drop.” She set off again.“They did it to several gifted young men in the Palace of the Prophets.”Nathan trudged after her, his expression indignant rather than queasy. “I canassure you that isn’t how I misplaced my gift.”After gliding through the tall grasses, Mrra now circled back. The big catdidn’t seem bothered by the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, who were too faraway to pose any immediate danger.Nicci watched the massed military force for a long time, listening to the rustleof the dark green oak leaves. She narrowed her blue eyes. “Something isn’t righthere. Have you noticed?” She pointed to the lines of countless soldiers spreadout below. “With that many people, we should see constant movement, patrols orscouting parties heading out or coming in to report, foot soldiers drilling.There is no smoke from cook fires. And listen—you can’t hear a sound.”She stepped out of the camouflaging oaks, no longer afraid of being spotted.“Look—where are their tents, their pennants? A fighting force of thousands ofsoldiers would leave a great mark as they moved across the landscape. They woulddestroy the terrain.” She looked over her shoulder. “If they came over themountains, we would have seen the scars of their passage, the hills andgrasslands trampled to muck by thousands of feet.”“Maybe they came from another direction,” Nathan said. “North or south.”“Why are there no fires?” she repeated. “There should be tents, picket lines ofhorses, supply wagons, material stockpiles.”The others had no answer for her.“Only one way to find out,” Bannon suggested. “If we’re careful, we can work ourway through the hills, stick to the trees, and remain unseen. With so manysoldiers across the plain and in the foothills, we’re bound to come uponoutlying groups, maybe scouts camped in the woods, messengers, perimeterpatrols. If we find a few people by themselves, we could ask questions.” Hegrinned uncertainly, but let his hand stray to the leather-wrapped hilt of hissword.Nicci nodded slowly. “That’s a good idea, Bannon Farmer. We’ll approach throughthe trees—keep your eyes open. Mrra can range ahead and warn us. As soon as wecome upon a lone member of the army, we will capture him and ask questions.” Sheallowed herself a thin smile. “By force if necessary.”“If necessary, indeed.” Nathan raised his eyebrows. “But I would prefer not tostart a war with half a million soldiers—at least not until I get my gift back.”“I thought we would just talk with whomever we found,” Bannon muttered.Having traveled together for so long, they easily worked their way through thechaparral foothills, among the hissing brown grasses and swaying tree thistles.Where possible, they kept to the patchy shelter of scrub oaks. A cascade ofgrasshoppers sprang out of their way. Distant birds chirped.But they heard no sound at all from the huge, distant army.Nicci spotted a dark scar where a grass fire had blackened a swath of bone-dryhills before burning itself out. In these driest months of late summer, shecould imagine how the chaparral might become an inferno. Her greater concern,though, was that the burned area offered no cover.Nathan paused next to a spiky thistle tree, shading his eyes to study the vastand oddly motionless military force. “I believe you’re right. My vision hasalways been exceptional—so much time staring at the rest of the world from hightowers, I suppose. I’ve been focusing on specific groups of soldiers, and thereisn’t any movement. None at all. I can make out hints of their uniforms, whichare of an ancient sort, but their colors are all … gray.” He sucked on a tinydrop of blood that welled up on his palm where a thistle spine had pierced him.“Their armor reminds me of…”His brow furrowed. “Remember after we worked our way inland from Renda Bay?You’ll recall that I took a side trip to an ancient watchtower. Through thetower’s bloodglass, I observed huge armies. I think they were the armies ofEmperor Kurgan—Iron Fang. His General Utros conquered much of the world in hisname, sweeping across the continent. From that watchtower, I saw the ancientwarriors through time and magic.” He nodded slowly. “Dear spirits, the soldiersahead remind me very much of those warriors.”“But the ones you saw were from thousands of years in the past,” Bannon said.“So I thought. And I can’t be sure about this army—until we get closer.”They continued toward patchy forests where they could hide, and the questions inNicci’s mind made her more and more uneasy. She could not make sense of what shewas seeing.She vividly recalled Jagang’s armies, the stench, turmoil, and mayhem, likemiasma. Thanks to the acoustics of the foothills and the open plain, she shouldhave been able to hear a distant murmur of shouts, the clang of steel frompractice swordplay, or the bash of armorers hammering metal, the screams ofcaptive women being dragged into soldiers’ tents, work crews with spades digginglatrines or burial trenches for executed prisoners. There would have been thesmell of funeral pyres, the smoke of cook fires, the lilt of music or bawdysinging, shouted orders from officers, or grumbled complaints from losers ingambling games.But Nicci heard only the silence of the wind, the snickering grasses, the clickand buzz of insects … none of the din and chaos generated by a huge army.Mrra bounded back from her explorations, crashing through the underbrush—notprowling, not stealthy. Nicci relaxed.In a cleft in the foothills ahead, several runoff streams converged in a glenthick with tall scrub oak and scattered pines. Bannon pointed toward the brush,the overhanging branches. “Look, I see soldiers there—not many. Maybe we cantalk to them?”“I see them as well,” Nathan said. “Only four or five men.” His whispered voicehad an undertone of hope.A chill prickled Nicci’s skin as she spotted several figures huddled in thelattice shadows of branches. They crouched together, possibly at a camp, maybeas lookouts for the army. She had not noticed them, and Mrra had not sensedthem, but these concealed warriors had likely seen the three approach.“It may be too late already.” Nicci saw no movement. “We’ll investigate, but becareful.” She touched the daggers she kept on each hip, but her greater weaponwas her magic.Bannon and Nathan drew their swords, and they moved together through the grassesto the patch of forest. Bannon ducked under a low-hanging branch, pushing leavesout of the way. “It looks like a good place to camp,” he whispered, far tooloudly for Nicci’s tastes. “Maybe that’s why they’re here.”Nicci shushed him, but she agreed with the assessment. An outlying party ofsoldiers could have taken shelter here in the tree-filled glen. But where wasthe smoke from a campfire?Five ancient warriors waited for them under the oaks, gathered around a centralpoint. Mrra padded forward, sniffing, but she showed no fear, no concern at all.Nicci halted, staring at the human figures. The burly warriors wore scaledarmor, thick shoulder pads, greaves, and armored boots; pointed, clefted helmetscovered their heads. They carried short swords. One man squatted halfway down,leaning toward an object that no one could see.All five were petrified, turned to the whitish gray of stone.“They’re … statues,” Bannon gasped, with a quaver in his voice. “Like the spellthe Adjudicator used.”Cautious, Nathan stepped closer. The stone warrior directed his blank gazetoward a cleared spot in the forest floor. “I’d wager that area held a campfirelong ago. See, age has erased it, but there are still a few stones left in aring.”The statue warriors wore bland expressions, their thoughts frozen in place whenthe petrification spell took hold. Nicci ventured closer as tentative answerspelted her like cold hailstones in a summer storm. No fires, no movement acrossthe entire army, utter silence. “I wonder if that whole army has been turned tostone across the plain.”Nathan looked both fascinated and unsettled. “The magic required to work such aspell is beyond anything I’ve ever heard of—not since the great wizard warsthree thousand years ago.” He spoke with distant admiration. “Ah, that was atime of titanic, unbridled magic.”Bannon rapped the blade of his sword against the shoulder of one petrifiedwarrior. Sturdy’s steel sent a bright chiming note into the silence. “A thousandyears … three thousand years—and they’re still intact? Will they ever awaken?”He looked at Nicci, his face suddenly struck with remembered grief. “We revivedthe statue people in Lockridge when Nathan defeated the Adjudicator. All thosestatues trapped with their guilt.”“That was a much smaller thing, my boy. The Adjudicator used his corrupt magiconly on those he found guilty, one at a time.” Nathan shook his head again. “Thescope of this effort is … breathtaking. So many thousands of men!”Mrra sniffed at the stone boots, but found nothing of interest in the marblefigures. Restless, she glided off into the spreading oak forest, picking her wayamong windfall branches and thick mats of brown leaves.With curiosity replacing his tension, Nathan walked around the tableau ofpetrified soldiers, inspecting them like an art patron reviewing a new statuegarden placed in a king’s courtyard. “I studied ancient war chronicles back atthe Palace of the Prophets. The armor is familiar to me. This badge here, seethe sylized flame design?” He tapped the breastplate on one of the guards. “Sucha symbol appears in the tales of Iron Fang.” He stepped back, put his hands onhis hips. “If only these men could talk, think of the stories they would tellus.”“I’d rather they remain silent,” Nicci said. “Because if they could talk, thenthe entire army could talk. And I doubt their first priority would be talking.”Bannon remained mystified. “But if they came to conquer that great city, there’snothing to keep them here. The city is gone.”“Except for the fact that they may all be statues, my boy,” Nathan pointed out.“They’re not going anywhere.”“That’s a good point.”Nathan’s voice grew more erudite. “On the bright side, if those countlesssoldiers are stone, then that vast army is no threat to us or to anyone. Weshould be able to walk among them and find clues to where the city has gone. Nomore skulking about. It should be perfectly easy.”The moment he uttered his ill-advised comment, a crashing sound broke throughthe trees at the far side of the glen. Branches snapped asunder, and a huge,hairy creature appeared, uprooting spindly scrub oaks and casting them aside.Nicci spun into a crouch, cupping her hands to touch her gift and pull forthmagic. Nathan raised his ornate sword, with Bannon right at his shoulder. Mrrabounded out of the trees from the opposite side of the glen, racing toward hercompanions.The monster paused to snuffle the air, assessing the intruders. The beast wasthe size of an ogre, but shaped like a nightmare-distorted bear. It let out adeep bellow, spreading its jaws wide to release ropes of saliva that drooledonto the ground. It reared up and extended paws filled with hooked claws likethe tines of a rake.The thing charged toward them, like a bestial thunderstorm."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 3 [contents.xhtml#c_ch3]The beast was too enormous for the thickets of scrub oak to contain it. Thething slashed with a battering-ram arm, catching some meddlesome branches withlong hooked claws. With a heave and a louder roar, it shredded the wood, leavingonly strips of splintered oak, like ribbon frayed by a seamstress into adecorative tassel. With a backward yank, it uprooted the spindly trees andhurled them sideways. The creature crashed toward them, grunting and snortinglike the bellows in a blacksmith shop.Bannon ducked among the statue warriors, as if they could protect him. “What isthat thing?”“We learn something new every day.” Nathan planted his black boots in awidespread stance, bracing himself. He grasped the ornate hilt of his sword withboth hands for a stronger grip. “But I suppose we fight it in the usual way.”Nicci stepped in front of the two men and curled her fingers, felt her skintingle as she awakened the gift inside her. “Stand back.”The monster reminded her of an enormous rabid bear—or it had once been a bear.Its body was covered with matted cinnamon fur clumped with drying pus and bloodthat leaked from oozing sores. Its blazing eyes were wide set in the blockyskull. One side of its face looked melted, like candle wax left too near aflame. The eye drooped in its socket, sliding down its face. The cheek hadpeeled away to reveal a horror of fangs in its elongated snout. Thick salivadripped out, mixed with blood from its cracked gums.The furry body was armored in places with smooth, curved plates, like the shellsof lobsters that fishermen sometimes delivered to Grafan Harbor. The hard plateswere grafted onto the bear monster’s body, and in many places its hide wasmarred with branded symbols and geometric spell designs, much like the scarredrunes that covered Mrra.The creature came on wildly, intent on attacking them, hurting them, killingthem. Nicci saw that the beast wasn’t just a ravening predator in search offood: it was in indescribable agony. Judging from the mutilation of its body,especially the festering brand marks on its hide, she knew that some human—someevil human—had shaped this creature.No wonder the beast wanted to kill anyone it encountered.Even though Nicci understood its reflexive attack, she did not intend to let themonster harm her companions. With barely a thought, she called a sizzling,turbulent sphere of wizard’s fire into each hand. The molten substance wouldengulf the bear monster and turn its repulsive form into purified ash.She hurled the fireballs, one after the other, as the monster crashed closer,knocking lichen-covered trees out of the way. The first blazing sphere struckthe beast—and merely curled around the furry body like hot fog, before spillinginto the shattered trees on either side. The wizard’s fire ignited the densescrub oak, but did no harm to the creature.The second fireball slammed into the bear monster, only to roll off like waterfrom oiled skin. The beast kept coming.“It’s immune to wizard’s fire!” Nathan cried.Nicci didn’t wait. She had an arsenal of other spells. She reached out with hergift to stop the bear’s heart, which would drop it in its tracks. Often, underextreme circumstances, she had wrapped a living heart with her magic andclenched to still its beating … but now her gift slid away again. She couldn’ttouch the heart, couldn’t reach inside at all.The beast stormed closer, undeterred. Just as the bear was upon her, she thrustboth of her hands forward, palms out, and pulled the air together, thickeningthe wind to create an invisible battering ram that slammed into the oncomingmonster. It staggered, paused only a moment, and lumbered forward again. Therunes branded on its hide glowed faintly.Nicci knew what was happening. Mrra was impervious to magic as well, thanks tothe scar markings on her tawny hide. This bear had been branded with the sameprotective runes.Then it was upon her, slamming a huge paw down. As she tried to duck to theside, the blow clipped her shoulder, and the force numbed her as she rolled.Nathan dove into the fray. “Leave it to us, Sorceress. Come, my boy, you haven’tused your sword in days.”Yelling, Bannon came toward the beast, as Nathan darted in, stabbed with thesword, and cut a long gash in the creature’s forearm. The bear snapped itsmisshapen jaws and swiped at the old wizard with its uninjured paw, but Nathandarted out of the way. He spun on one foot with unexpected grace and stabbedagain, but his sword did little more than provoke the creature.Bannon attacked from the other side, swinging Sturdy in a horizontal arc thatcaught the tip of the bear’s massive paw, clipping off four knifelike claws.Nathan swung his blade down hard. The steel struck one of the armor shells andglanced off. Everything happened in a few seconds.Nicci lunged back to her feet and saw that the blaze ignited by her wizard’sfire crackled in the underbrush, catching deadfall branches and the carpet ofdry leaves. The fire would spread, and if it reached the dry grassy hills, theinferno would be unstoppable.But before they could fight the fire, they had to halt the attacking monster.Since her magic could not harm the bear directly, Nicci used her gift to wrenchone of the stunted, burning oaks from the ground and threw the uprootedprojectile at the bear. In a crash of sparks and smoke, the tree struck themonster, spraying fire onto its fur. Bannon and Nathan scattered out of the wayas the monster tore the burning tree apart and came at them again.Nicci set aside her gift and instead drew the two daggers she kept at her sides.In order to inflict harm with the short blades, she would have to be well withinthe monster’s embrace. She did not intend to be crushed in a furious hug, herribs snapped like twigs, but she watched for opportunity.Nathan hacked with his sword again, but the monster caught him with a backhandedblow. The old wizard flew twenty feet and his limp body crashed into a thicketof scrub oaks, where he lay stunned.A tawny shape flashed past, and Mrra sprang upon the monster. Though the pantherwas much smaller than the enormous bear, Mrra was a killing machine, trained insome distant combat arena.Nicci bounded into the fray, both knives held in front of her. As she stabbed,one blade clattered against the implanted armor, but her other knife cut intothe tough fur. Striking like a viper, she jabbed and jabbed again, beforespringing away.Mrra attacked with claws and scimitar fangs, tearing at the sword gash Bannonhad made in the thing’s belly. The panther ripped the wound wider until entrailsspilled out. As it roared, the monster sprayed ribbons of saliva. Its intact pawraked a line of scratches down Mrra’s hide, but the big cat didn’t stop.Bannon stabbed his plain sword into the creature’s belly, driving the bladedeep, all the way to the spine. Using both bloody paws, the bear clawed at theblade, then swatted at Bannon. As the young man reeled out of the way, his swordslid out of the wound, now slick with gore.As Mrra continued to maul, Nicci worked her way close enough to the monster’shead that she could smell its fetid breath. She plunged one knife into its lefteye, drove the point through the socket, cracking the thick bone, and into itsbrain. Pounding the pommel with the flat of her hand, she hammered the knifedeeper and deeper.Even that didn’t kill the bear, but Nicci used her other dagger to slash itsthroat, cutting through insulating fat and sawing through the tendons until shefound its jugular. The razor-honed edge severed the vein, and spouting blooddrenched her.Mrra pulled away, dragging long cords of intestines out of the creature’s tornbelly as if the big cat had found a new toy.Bannon’s eyes flashed with the frenzy of the fight, a battle trance thatsometimes caught him. With a wordless yell, he raised his sword high and plungedit point-first into the bear’s chest, cracking its breastbone and piercing itsheart.The tortured creature shuddered, gurgled, and finally died.Bannon’s shoulders heaved up and down as he hunched over the beast, clutchingthe leather-wrapped hilt. When he looked down at the bloody mess, he beganweeping, not just from relief and terror, but out of real sympathy for the poorcreature. “I would have preferred a cleaner kill.”A stunned Nathan extricated himself from the thicket, clawing leaves andbranches from his hair and clothes. He held a hand to his throbbing head. “SorryI couldn’t be of more help. I was sidelined like an injured player in Ja’La.”Even as the dead bear still twitched, the crackling flames of the growing firecaught Nicci’s attention. The scrub oaks burned quickly, and the mounded dryleaves on the forest floor provided a wealth of fuel. The flames rushed throughthe spindly branches. The blaze had already swept past the five statue warriors,blackening their petrified features.Nicci drew several breaths, calming herself to focus on her Han. A forest firewas something she could fight, a problem her gift could solve. She called up thewind again and swirled a curtain of air around the rising flames, encircling thefire. A cyclone of dry leaves blew all around them.Holding up her hands in a circular motion, she made the wind spin faster andfaster, sucking the air away from the flames. She channeled it, choked it, drovethe fire into a whirlwind pillar, which she tightened into a thinner spout,shooting a jet of flame high into the sky.Bannon and Nathan ducked against the rising storm, letting the sorceress workher magic. Mrra flattened her ears against her head. Around them, branchescrashed and whipped, twigs flew in all directions.At last, the remnants of the fire flickered out, leaving only curls of smokethat dissipated as Nicci let the magic die away. The storm faded, and the oakbranches stirred, as if in a sigh of relief. Charred leaves drifted to theground.Using his fingers to brush the tangles from his white hair, Nathan smiled atNicci’s work, accepting it with little more than a shrug. “Thank you, Sorceress.That could have turned into a bad situation. If I had my gift back, I’d havedone it myself.”“You’ll be restored soon, Nathan. We will find the city.” Bannon remaineddoggedly optimistic. His hazel eyes sparkled as he looked over at Nicci. “Still,that was very impressive.”Nicci was not profligate with her compliments, but she was honest. “Your swordwork was also very useful.” In fact, she was embarrassed by her own failure tofight with her gift, annoyed to feel helpless. She could relate to Nathan’splight. “Seeing those branded symbols, I should have guessed earlier that mymagic wouldn’t work on the monster.”Coppery blood and a rank, gamy stink hung around the dead carcass in front ofthem, overpowering even the smell of smoke. Mrra prowled through the underbrush,keeping her distance from the creature as she guarded against any other attack.Unabashedly curious, Nathan knelt beside the dead bear, rapped his knuckles onthe strange armor shells grafted to its hide. “Dear spirits, what would havecreated such an appalling creature? And why?” He looked up, blinking. “If awizard had a gift powerful enough to manipulate flesh, why would anyone use itfor such an awful purpose?”Still staring at the fallen beast, Bannon wiped the tracks of tears from hisface, smearing some of the blood on his skin. “Back on Chiriya Island, I knewboys who liked to pull the wings off of flies and roast beetles by dangling theminto a flame. Sometimes, they did terrible things to poor cats and puppies.” Heshook his head. “There is no answer for why people do terrible things.”Nathan stood, brushed leaves from his black trousers, adjusted his brown cape.He regarded Nicci, whose face, hair, and black dress were plastered with gore.“You look a mess, Sorceress.”“I’m sure I do,” she said, arching an eyebrow at him. Turning slowly around,Nicci surveyed the blackened trees, the smoldering trunks, the last smear ofsmoke that wafted into the air. “The fire would have been visible for miles, andour fight with the creature would have drawn much attention. So much for ourattempts at stealth. We seem to have announced our arrival.”Bannon and Nathan looked around warily.Farther off through the forest of low oaks and the scattered taller trees, theyheard branches breaking, a murmur of voices. Mrra crouched, growling, her earspressed back. She sniffed the air as if she smelled death. As the voices camenearer, the sand panther bolted away, disappearing into the underbrush.Bannon stared after the cat. “Mrra didn’t flinch when that monster attacked us.What would scare her now?”Nathan swung his sword loosely, ready to keep fighting. “Perhaps we should befrightened as well, my boy.”“Not frightened,” Nicci said, holding up her two daggers. “Prepared.” She stoodher ground and waited for the ominous strangers to arrive."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 4 [contents.xhtml#c_ch4]The approaching strangers did not try to hide. Rather, they talked in loud,raucous voices as they came through the woods; one of them let out a rude laugh.They rustled leaves, pushed branches aside, and made their way toward the sootyremnants of the forest fire. Nicci realized they must have seen the cyclone offlames that had roared up into the sky before being snuffed out.Three colorfully dressed figures came through the thicket—slender, aloof youngmen who looked poorly prepared for the wilderness.Nathan actually laughed when he saw them. “They are just youths!”The strangers looked to be about twenty, no older than Bannon. As if on a casualouting, they strolled through the underbrush dressed in exotic, old-fashionedclothes: billowing shirts with loose front laces that showed off their chests;silk pantaloons dyed dark green, bound at the waist with wide sashes ofcontrasting colors, red, blue, or purple. Dangling from their shoulders wereshort half capes lined with exotic spotted furs—utterly impractical for awarrior, or even hard travel, Nicci observed. Each of the newcomers carried along, wooden cudgel tipped with an iron ball. Such cudgels could be effectiveweapons, but the youths held them like swagger sticks.Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon faced them in the clearing near the smoldering ashesand the bloody carcass of the bear monster. The young men paused, surprised tosee the bedraggled, blood-encrusted companions.The first youth, obviously the leader, sniffed. “By the Keeper’s crotch, who areyou?” He stepped forward, self-consciously straightening his fur-lined cape. Hehad blue-black hair, dusky skin, and deep brown eyes. His generous lips werecurved in a confused frown. “We didn’t expect to see anyone else out here.” Hewore a loose red shirt with a wide purple sash. Casually, he rested the iron tipof his cudgel on the ground.“Nevertheless we are here,” Nicci said, still trying to assess whether theseout-of-place strangers might be a threat. He spoke with an odd and archaicaccent, but his words were still understandable.More conciliatory, Nathan spoke up. “We are travelers from afar. We’ve come overKol Adair, and before that, we crossed the desolation, the mountains, thevalleys, and even the sea itself.” He paused a moment, drawing out the suspense.“We come from the New World.”“That’s far away,” said the second young man, who had reddish-brown hair and asmear of similar color on his cheeks, where wisps of thin whiskers made ahalfhearted attempt at a beard. “I thought you just came from one of themountain towns to the north.”The third young man had a squarish face and dark hair shorn close to his head.He showed no more interest than the other two. “Where are you going? What areyour names?”Nicci interrupted before either of her companions could answer, not wanting togive away too much. “Our destination is wherever our travels take us. We areexploring the Old World. My name is Nicci. My companions are Nathan and Bannon.”The first young man tapped his swagger stick on the ground, stirring forestdetritus. “I’m Amos.” He showed little warmth or welcome—not suspicion, as Niccimight have expected, but simply distance, as if they were of no importance tohim. He indicated his two friends. “This is Jed and Brock. Last time the shroudcame down, we decided to spend some time outside, and now we have to waitagain.”Brock, the young man with close-cropped dark hair, looked curiously at themangled mess of the bear carcass, its gouged-out eye, the glistening entrailsdraped over its abdominal cavity. “Another combat bear got loose.”Amos snorted. “Chief Handler Ivan is an idiot. My mother and father both sayso—one of the only things they’ve ever agreed on.”Jed scratched the wispy red hair on his cheeks. “We heard it hunting in thehills last night, so we stayed away.” He glanced at the blood-spatteredtravelers. “You took care of the brute for us.”“Rather messy,” Brock added.“Dear spirits, you know what this creature is?” Nathan asked. “You’ve seen sucha monstrosity before? You know where it comes from?”Amos frowned. “Of course. Didn’t you hear what Brock said? It’s a combat bear.”Nicci struggled to keep the edge from her voice. “And we have never seen acombat bear.”“Of course you haven’t,” the young man answered in a flippant voice. “And ourfleshmancers have created far worse than this thing.”Jed rubbed a fingertip down the cracked, sooty trunk of one of the blackenedtrees. “We saw the spreading flames and were worried there might be a wildfireon the hills. We could have been trapped out here, but then we saw the cyclonethat extinguished it.”“Someone has an excellent mastery of magic,” Amos said, looking intently at thethree of them. “Who was responsible for that?”“Nicci did it,” Bannon offered, apparently trying to impress the strangers.“She’s a sorceress, and Nathan is a wizard too … or at least he usually is.”Now Amos looked at the travelers with a different measure, his aloofness fading.“You’re gifted, then?” He turned to Bannon. “And what about yourself?”Bannon held up his blood-encrusted sword. “I am a swordsman, and an adventurer.”“Good to know,” said Brock with a thread of sarcasm.Bored with the conversation, Amos strolled over to the five statue warriors, whowere now smeared with soot from the fire that had washed over them. “Jed thoughtthere might be an encampment up here in the trees. Scouts and spies.”After taking the measure of the nearest fire-blackened statue, Amos stepped backand with a vicious grimace swung his iron-tipped cudgel. With all his might, hesmashed the metal end into the statue’s helmeted face. The loud, ringing crackrang out in the forest. Part of the stone helmet and chiseled nose broke away,leaving a scar of bright, fresh marble.Nicci was startled by the unexpected violence and readied herself in case theyattacked her or her companions. Bannon yelped in surprise.But Jed and Brock chuckled along with their friend, raised their clubs, andbattered the faces of the five stone warriors. Ornate, swooped helmetssplintered and broke; aquiline noses, heavy brows, and close-pressed lips burstinto sprays of rock powder.Nathan gasped in confusion, uncertain whether he should stop them. “Dearspirits!” The youths did not rest until they had ruined the faces of all fivestatues. They laughed and congratulated one another over their risk-freebravado.Nicci felt the bear’s blood drying on her cheeks, and where it had soaked herblack travel dress. “Why would you do that?” she asked in a cold voice.“Keeper’s crotch, because they deserve it!” Amos said. “We hate them. GeneralUtros’s army. They’ve been here for fifteen hundred years, back when EmperorKurgan meant to conquer the world, bring everyone under his control. We all knowthe history. So, when our protective shroud went down, my friends and I came outto have fun … to make our point.”Brock added, “We’ve been roaming for days, doing what we can against the stonearmy—just in case.”Nathan gave them a look of clear disapproval. Nicci added in a sharp tone, “Youcan vandalize stone soldiers, but that does not mean you are great fighters.”Amos sniffed. “But this is the only chance we have, and we’re not going to passup the opportunity for revenge. We’ve all been waiting so long.”The three young men looked at one another. Brock said, “Should we make our wayback across the plain? Plenty more statue soldiers along the way.”“No telling how soon they will drop the shroud again,” Jed said, soundingsuddenly nervous. “We won’t want to miss our opportunity and be trapped out herefor even longer.”“Plenty of time to go back and be cooped up again.” Amos glanced at the burnedarea. “I just wanted to see who had used sorcery over here. Let’s go home.”“But where is your home?” Bannon asked. “This land has been wide open and emptyduring most of our travels. We haven’t seen anyone since we came over themountains. Are you from a village in the hills?”Brock and Jed laughed; Amos rolled his eyes. “Oh, there are plenty of towns, butdo we look like hill villagers?”“Where, then?” Nicci asked in a sharp voice.“The city, obviously.”Nathan perked up. “Yes, we saw the city! Can you tell us how to find it?”The young men laughed again. “Of course. That’s our home.” They made it sound asif Nathan were impossibly stupid.“And what is the name of your city?” Nicci pressed. If these youths didn’t startresponding to questions, she would enjoy coercing answers out of them.“Why, it’s Ildakar.” Amos treated her with scorn as well. “How can you not knowthe grand city of Ildakar?”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 5 [contents.xhtml#c_ch5]Hearing the name of the almost-mythical city, Nathan felt a thrill of wonder andexcitement. Ildakar! Gooseflesh prickled his skin, and he realized he wasgrinning like a young lad facing the prospect of more candy than he had everimagined.“Ildakar … from the legends of ages past?” He looked at the three young men withmuch greater interest than he had at first accorded them. “It’s said to be awondrous metropolis.”“Our fine and perfect society has endured for thousands of years,” Amos saidwith a sniff. “But Ildakar is not a legend—it is our home.”“Then where is it?” Nicci asked with more skepticism than wonder. “We glimpsed acity from high in the mountains, but the plain is empty.”“Except for all those statue warriors…” Bannon added.Amos, Jed, and Brock laughed at a private joke that no one else understood. “Ourcity is right there at the edge of the uplift—protected behind the shroud. Don’tunderestimate the wizards of Ildakar.”Burning questions crowded in Nathan’s throat, and he followed the young men asthey wandered out of the charred oak grove. Amos swung his iron-tipped stick ashe walked along, bashing dead twigs out of his way. They emerged from the woodsinto the open chaparral, strolling down the grassy hills. Together, Jed andBrock made a game out of smacking the tops of the thistle trees, scatteringfeathery petals and sharp thorns. The youths seemed carefree and aimless, in nohurry to get back to Ildakar, despite Nathan’s obvious intensity.The former wizard let his imagination run wild, and he looked at Nicci,exchanging silent questions. He couldn’t stop smiling, sure that he would findhis answers after all. Ildakar was said to be a bastion of innovative magic fromages past, filled with powerfully gifted men and women. If the city haddefeated—petrified?—the talented General Utros before disappearing into the fogof myth, surely they had the resources to restore his lost gift. Exactly as thewitch woman had said.He let his hopes soar, and he tried to sound avuncular. “I would love to hearmore of an explanation, lads. I spent centuries in the Palace of the Prophets,up at the northern boundary of the Old World. Perhaps you’ve heard of it? Thepalace was built thousands of years ago. No? Ah, well. The palace is gone nowanyway. I studied all the histories, especially recountings of the Midwar.” Henodded sagely, then paused to see if they had any reaction. “Ildakar featuresprominently in that history, you know.”The three young men did not seem overly interested. He couldn’t even tell ifthey were listening to him.Bannon tried to keep up with the strangers, as if hoping to find kindred spiritsin the young men his own age. “The wizard Nathan told us about Emperor Kurganand his iron fang.” He spread his lips and tapped his left canine tooth with afingertip. “And how General Utros tried to lay siege to Ildakar, and the silverdragon they captured to use as a weapon, but it broke free and attacked them …before the city vanished.” His words came out in a rush.Nathan appreciated the enthusiasm, but he wished Bannon would contain himselfuntil they knew more. He interjected, catching up to Amos, “Yes, lads—how didyou three escape?”“Escape? We came out of the city when the shroud flickered,” Amos answered. “Asthe wizards test their bloodworking, it’s due to disappear again soon. No needfor us to hurry. We’ll have plenty of time to get back.”Brock decapitated a dry thistle, sending puffs of feathery seeds into the air,while Jed thrashed through the grasses, chasing after a rustling sound thatmight have been a snake or a rabbit.Nathan looked over his shoulder at the burned patch in the hills behind them,wondering if he would see Mrra following, but the sand panther had disappearedinto the sparse chapparal. He wondered why she was more worried about thesethree aloof young men than the horrific bear monster or the raging forest fire.These youths did not seem to pose any threat.Nicci plucked persistent burrs from her black skirt. “The city we glimpsed fromthe pass shimmered like a mirage. It seemed unnatural.”“It’s magic,” Amos said. “Depending on the strength of the shroud, Ildakar winksin and out of existence, in and out of time. The shroud goes up and down as thewizards try to hold the ancient spells. My friends and I are out here exploringbecause we had the chance to do so.”“It lets us get our revenge on the enemy soldiers,” Brock said, swinging hisiron-tipped club viciously through the prickly stem of a thistle. “A few at atime.”“I hope the city reappears soon,” Jed said. “We’ve been out here three days,camping and wandering. I could use a good bath and a decent meal. Pack foodleaves much to be desired.”Amos gave a sly grin. “I thought you’d be more anxious to visit the silk yaxen.”His two companions laughed hungrily. Brock added, “Keeper’s crotch! I’d want tobe clean and rested before expending all that energy.”“As long as the girls are clean and rested. That’s what matters most to me,” Jedsaid.“What’s a silk yaxen?” Bannon asked.The youths gave him a withering glance. “Maybe we’ll show you someday.”Together, they waded down the slopes through grasses and weeds. Not needing tohide from the enormous army, they made good time. Once they reached the plainfilled with thousands of statue soldiers, Nathan stared at the motionless ranks.The stone figures were everywhere, flash-frozen in the midst of their normalactivities while prosecuting a major war … a war that had never reached Ildakar.They came upon a group of four cavalry riders, their massive destriers wearingfull battle gear. Nathan recognized the ornate components of equine armor, thechanfron to protect the horse’s head and face, the crinet for the neck, thepeytral for the sides and flanks. Worked into the metal and leather was thestylized-flame symbol of Emperor Kurgan. The right foreleg of one of thewarhorses was upraised as if the mount bounded off in a gallop, but now thestatue stood precariously balanced.The soldiers astride the destriers wore exotic antique armor, which gave them afearsome appearance: large padded helmets with a crest above the forehead, anose guard and sweeping pointed chin guards, a smooth metal cuirass coveringtheir chests, lapped leather thigh guards worked with metal disks for extraprotection. They held curved swords upraised, ready for a charge. Their roundshields were also emblazoned with Kurgan’s flame.Bannon paused to admire the statue cavalry. “They must have been riding out on asortie.”Amos pressed both hands against the stone horse with the raised foreleg. “Helpme with this.” Jed and Brock joined him without question, and Amos looked atBannon. “You can pitch in, too. We’ll let you.”Unsure, Bannon took his place next to the three youths. “What are we doing?” Allfour of them planted their hands against the stone horse.“Doing our part to fight the old war.” Amos and his friends pushed, making thestone horse wobble. Bannon’s uncertain assistance did little.Nathan expressed his biting disapproval. “That’s a historical artifact, lads.You shouldn’t—”“It’s an enemy soldier.” Amos gritted his teeth, and his cheeks flushed with thestrain. With a final heave, they tipped over the stone horse and rider. Theheavy statue crashed to the ground, breaking the horse’s foreleg and crackingthe statue soldier in half.The young men stepped back, congratulating themselves. “Only about a hundredthousand more to go,” Jed said, and sauntered onward.They moved through the large, silent camp, where innumerable ancient warriorswere frozen in the midst of frenetic activity. Many of the statues wore armor,ready to fight. Two burly men stood with gauntleted arms crossed over theirchests like implacable guardians, apparently standing watch.“Why are there no tents or banners?” Bannon asked.Nathan realized the answer. “Any such things would have decayed over thecenturies. Even if the soldiers themselves turned to stone, the other trappingsrotted away long ago.”He shaded his eyes in the bright afternoon, scanning across the tableau. Tenfossilized warriors sprawled in a circle on the ground where weeds and grasseshad grown up around them. From their positions and state of undress, he surmisedthey had been at camp, sleeping around a fire, covered with no-longer-existentblankets. Others squatted nearby, arms extended toward the center of the circle,as if they had been holding sticks, roasting meat over flames.One man stood with his hands at his crotch, gazing toward the ground, preservedin the act of urinating. Amos and his companions found this intensely amusing,and they used their iron-tipped staffs to batter away at the stone hands andpulverize his petrified manhood.They came to a clearing among the fossilized soldiers, perhaps a place where alarge supply tent had disintegrated with time, leaving an unoccupied area.“Here’s a good place to make camp,” Amos said, then looked at Bannon. “Did youbring supplies?”“I hope you have decent food,” Jed added. “And enough to share.”Nicci gave them all a hard look. “You should have prepared better for yourexpedition.”Amos frowned at the criticism, but Nathan shrugged out of his pack. “We havefood. Happy to share.” He undid the strings and opened it to reveal thespell-preserved venison steaks they had carved from one of Mrra’s recent kills.The strangers gave appreciative grins. “Fresh meat sounds good,” Brock said.Working together, they gathered armfuls of dead weeds, grass stalks, and fallenbranches. Nathan laid out a circle of stones he collected, and the Ildakaranyouths piled the debris in the center without finesse.Looking at the unruly heap, Bannon bent down, getting to work. “Building a firetakes a little more skill than that. Dry grass, then twigs for kindling, withlarger branches built up around it.”Amos rolled his deep brown eyes. “Why bother?” With a gesture, he released aflicker of his gift and ignited the piled debris. The crackling grass and twigsquickly built into a healthy fire.“Or, I suppose that would be faster,” Bannon muttered. Nicci also usuallystarted their campfires.As dusk fell, they roasted meat and hunkered down to eat, but Nathan’s attemptsto elicit further conversation resulted in few details. Adding their part to thedinner, the young men pulled out honeyed wafers and dense grain cakes from theirpacks, sharing them. Nathan found them to be flavorful, but the young menclaimed they were tired of eating the stuff.As the darkness deepened, Nathan gazed across the sweeping expanse, whichreminded him of the Azrith Plain in D’Hara. The open grassy prairie extended tothe steep drop-off at the river that bisected the vast plain, and even theimmense open space seemed barely large enough to contain the countless soldiersthat had come to conquer Ildakar.Taking a second honeyed wafer, Nathan gestured with his chin toward the distantriver. “That looks like an extreme uplift. Normally, a river like that wouldhave carved a wide valley, but it seems to have cut the plain like an axe. Thoseare enormous cliffs above the water.”“It didn’t happen by accident,” Amos said, licking venison grease from hisfingers. “In order to defend Ildakar, the wizards’ duma combined their magic toraise this side of the plain, lifting it up like a giant swatch of sod hundredsof feet above the Killraven River. The sheer bluffs prevent any attacks from thewater.”“Only fools would attack Ildakar,” said Brock, chewing on his blackened meat. Heplucked a lump of gristle from his mouth and inspected it between thumb andforefinger before flicking it off into the grasses. “General Utros and his armylearned that lesson.”“How can anyone attack the city if they can’t find it?” Nicci asked. “Where didIldakar go?”“That was part of our genius,” Amos said, without elaborating further.As night insects in the grasses set up a soothing chorus of songs, Nathanpondered what he knew from legends and history. If the wizards of Ildakar coulddo such astonishing things, surely they could help him recover his gift.First, though, they had to solve the mystery of the vanishing city.* * *The next day, long after sunrise, they set off across the plain, wandering amongthe petrified soldiers. At random times, the three young men found stonewarriors that caught their attention. One squatting man with his stone trousersaround his stone knees had fallen over onto the ground when the latrine he wasusing had weathered into dust. Amos and his friends broke that statue intopieces.They targeted particularly fierce-looking warriors, stone men who looked hungryto conquer Ildakar. Amos and his friends used their iron clubs to batter theeyes, noses, and mouths, leaving the faces chipped and featureless, which theyfound hilarious.After all he had read about the glory of Ildakar, Nathan was disappointed intheir attitude. He surveyed the countless figures that covered the open plain.“I suppose General Utros is one of these statues. It would be be intriguing tofind him, just to look upon his features—for the sake of history.”“How would we know who he is?” Bannon frowned at the broken statue the othershad just smashed. “These warriors wear no identifying badges.”“Dear boy, I assume that if we looked long enough, we could find one with ageneral’s garb or armor, probably near the center of camp in a command tent.”Nathan brushed the front of the ruffled shirt he had worn since leavingCliffwall. “But there would be no tent left after all these years, alas … notables, no remnants of charts, no banners.”Nicci looked ahead at the distant river and the sheer cliff drop-off. “If yourwizards were so powerful, why were they afraid? Uplifting half the plain,tearing the landscape to create huge cliffs above the river—that is not an actof confidence.”“It was a demonstration of our invincibility,” Amos said. “The Killraven Riverbrought trade from distant lands, but as times grew darker it also broughtfoolish invaders who sought to conquer the city, so the wizards created the highbluffs and dragged the river closer. They reshaped the landscape like a pottermanipulates clay. Ildakar has stood for all this time, and we are stronger andgreater than ever.”With a grunt of effort, he shoved another stone soldier over, toppling it intothe weeds.As they approached the uplift that loomed above the river, Nathan wondered howthey would ever descend to the water, if that was their destination. The boysrefused to explain, and seemed to find Nathan’s persistent questions annoying.When they were within a mile of the drop-off, in the heat of the afternoon,Nicci expressed her frustration, “So, where is this city?” Her black traveldress was flecked with tan seeds, burrs, and dry grass tips.Amos said, “We’re in the right general place, but I don’t know exactly when theshroud will come down. There’s nothing we can do to hurry it.”“We might have to camp again tonight.” Jed sounded disappointed. “I’d rather—”As if some lookout from within the unseen city had spotted their approach, theair suddenly shimmered and changed. Nathan caught a sharp metallic tang in theair, as if lightning had struck nearby. A sizzling sound like millions ofswarming gnats grew louder, and rose to a persistent drone that made his teethrattle.Then the expansive view of the empty plain dissolved, the air itself peelingaway to reveal what had been hidden behind a camouflaged barrier.When the shimmer faded, Nathan stared at the enormous and breathtaking city ofIldakar directly in front of them."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 6 [contents.xhtml#c_ch6]Nicci stopped in her tracks, staring at the city that had not been there momentsbefore. Bannon staggered backward. “Sweet Sea Mother!” The crackling hum in theair faded as details sharpened into perfect clarity.A walled city as large as Tanimura unfolded from behind a wall of time.Countless layers of buildings were perched on a mounded uplift that rose like aplateau sculpted from the plain.Nathan shaded his eyes as he gazed upward to take it all in. “Dear spirits, eventhe wildest legends did not do this city justice. I see why Iron Fang insistedthat it be conquered.”“It is Ildakar,” Amos said, as if that explained everything. “Many outsidershave tried to possess it, and no army has ever succeeded.”Since the three young men offered no details, Nathan turned to Nicci and Bannon.“Ildakar was the most prominent city in the southern part of the Old World, acultural wellspring for arts and crafts, a focus for research into the magicalarts. Many of the greatest scholars and discoveries in ancient times came fromhere.” He stroked his smooth chin. “In fact, many of the seminal works in theCliffwall archives originated from Ildakar—three thousand years ago.”“Our city has only grown greater since.” Amos adjusted his fur-lined half capeand strode forward across the unmarked plain toward the great gates in thetowering wall. “That’s because we were protected behind the shroud. If Ildakarhad remained vulnerable, we would have been conquered by General Utros or anynumber of other warlords.”Nicci nodded in admiration at the imposing stone walls that surrounded theuplifted city. Her blond hair drifted in front of her face. “If Emperor Jaganghad known about Ildakar, he surely would have sent Imperial Order troops downhere to conquer it.”“Then Jagang—whoever he was—would have failed as well,” Amos said. “By shieldingour city behind time, we avoided the wars, the devastation, the hardship overthe ages. We have had fifteen centuries of isolation to build a perfectsociety.” He paused in front of the nearest stone soldier, a man with a droopingmustache and a wart on his nose. With a sneer, he swung his staff to smash thehead of the statue. Releasing their pent-up anger, Jed and Brock joined in, thethree of them hammering until they shattered the petrified warrior into rubble.Nicci was impatient with their misplaced destructive tendencies, but she did notchastise them, having seen far worse atrocities among Jagang’s soldiers. BoredImperial Order troops would rape, torture, and mangle living captives, justbecause they had nothing better to do. Restless vandalism couldn’t hold a candleto that.Turning his look of obvious distaste away from the young men, he blinked, comingout of his reverie as he turned back to the amazing metropolis that rose up likean island on the edge of the plain. “That city is alive! Let us go see Ildakar.”They trudged across the grassland toward the stone wall. They walked on theweathered remnants of a great road that had vanished into little more thanoccasional rough cobblestones overgrown with tufts of grasses and hardy weeds.Nicci studied the exotic, colorful buildings that clung to the slopes of thesculpted plateau, comparing it to Altur’Rang and Aydindril. Ildakar was so largeit loomed like a mountain of buildings with steep streets, greenways, terracedgardens, orchards. The succession of rising walls and steep barriers formedconcentric defenses that rose dramatically from the otherwise-gentle valley.After all the colorless stone soldiers and the brown grasses of the plain,vibrant Ildakar was bursting with color. Purple and red pennants flew abovecrenellations on the stepped walls. Rooftops on the crowded whitewashed housessported tiles of glazed red, ocher, or black. Some of the windows glinted withrainbows of colored crystal in the bright sunshine. Hanging gardens, verdantwaterfalls of vines and vegetation, were draped over the wall.Behind the tall defensive barricade, the city’s neighborhoods and districts werelike the layers of an onion, small dwellings, large warehouses, observationtowers, gathering areas. Nicci thought of Richard’s seat of power, the People’sPalace, an enormous city within a single structure that overlooked the AzrithPlain. Ildakar was just as imposing, just as magnificent, but with strange,curving architecture that featured pointed towers and swooping arches.Approaching the outer wall, they came upon the weathered remnants of deeptrenches—overgrown moats that must have been used to discourage cavalry attacksages ago—but they had slumped and filled in with time. The group picked theirway through.Amos gestured to the ditches. “For years, Ildakar’s traditional siege defenseswere considered impregnable, but after the wizards erected the protectiveshroud, none of that was relevant anymore.”“The shroud was all we needed to keep the rest of the dangerous world away,” Jedsaid.When they had first seen the city from Kol Adair, Nicci now realized the shrouddome was flickering, perhaps faltering, as the spell faded. From what Amos andhis friends grudgingly revealed, the shroud had been going up and downintermittently for years—well before Richard’s star shift had changed the rulesof magic.The three young men strolled along, yelling up at the walls. Even though theyhad talked about eating and bathing—and visiting their mysterious “silkyaxen”—they seemed in no hurry to get home.“What if the city vanishes again before we reach it?” Bannon asked, picking uphis own pace. “Don’t we want to get inside?”Nathan also added his concern. “We’ve come a long way to find Ildakar. Iwouldn’t want to miss our opportunity.”Amos shrugged, slowing his pace a bit, just to be difficult. “Now that theshroud has been dropped, the sovrena and the wizard commander won’t work themagic again for at least a week. The city will be open to the outside world fornow.”Nicci was eager to learn more answers, to speak with representatives who showedmore interest in the outside visitors. She no longer expected much from Amos andhis companions; she had seen layabouts before. “We don’t know how long ourbusiness will take.” Nicci glanced over at Nathan. “The wizard has an importantrequest to make of your rulers.”“And Nicci’s supposed to save the world,” Bannon interjected. “A witch womansent them here.”“A witch woman?” Amos rolled his eyes again. “A minor sorceress? A trivial seer?Witch women don’t have much standing in Ildakar. In our city, the gifted arestrong.”Nicci was glad to hear that, since she’d had enough of witch women. “Why wereyour wizards so much more powerful than any opponent? In those days were therenot other gifted enemies? Dream walkers? Shapers?”“Ildakar was different because our wizards banded together. Their secretiveresearch had taught them magic and spell-forms that no one else knew, and whenthey united their abilities, no outsider could defeat them.”From the sound of his words, Nicci guessed that Amos was just parroting whathe’d been taught all his life. Nevertheless, it seemed to be true.They soon reached the first of the high outer walls and a towering double gatemade of stone-hard wood held in place with giant iron hinges; each plank was thelength of a full tree. The gate looked impervious to any kind of siege orbattering ram. Nicci ran her gaze up and down the construction, trying toimagine whether she would have the power to blast her way inside. Or to escape,if need be.Bannon looked intimidated. “Will they let us in?”Amos snorted. “They’ll let us in. I’m the son of the sovrena and the wizardcommander.” He went to a smaller, person-sized door inset on the lower leftside. He hammered with his fist. “High Captain Avery, are you on duty? Open up!I brought visitors.”Nicci heard voices on the other side, then a rattle and clank as iron bolts weredrawn back out of their sockets.She sensed a flash of magic as a different kind of seal peeled away from aroundthe jamb; then the smaller door swung open. A uniformed guard stood there, talland handsome, with a red pauldron on his left shoulder. Brown leather armorlapped with iron scales covered his torso but left his arms bare. His wide beltheld a dagger and a sheathed short sword. Though the air was warm, he wore acape lined with a wiry brown pelt from an animal Nicci could not identify. Hishigh boots came to just beneath the knee.The guard captain looked at Amos, ignoring the strangers. “We’ve been expectingyou back, young man.”Amos and his two friends pushed through the gate. “No matter what you do with mymother, you don’t command me, Captain.” He glanced over his shoulder at Nicci,Nathan, and Bannon, who were still waiting to be introduced. “This is HighCaptain Avery, the head of the city guard. He’ll know what to do.” He turnedback to the muscular man. “The woman is a sorceress, and the old one claims tobe a wizard. Apparently, they have some business in Ildakar and have come a longway. I turn them over to you. Take them to my parents in the ruling tower.” Hepaused and glanced at Bannon, considering. “You’ll stay with them, I suppose?”Bannon brushed back his long ginger hair and made up his mind. “Yes, I will.”Amos clearly had no further interest. “Fine. My friends and I have other thingsto do.”Jed pushed forward. “Let’s go to the bathhouse first. Slaves can bring food tous there.”“I thought you wanted to visit the silk yaxen first,” Brock said.“Tonight,” Amos replied. “There’ll be plenty of time.”Without a second glance, the three youths entered the bustling city, while HighCaptain Avery frowned at the three strangers. “Come with me.”After they entered through the wall, he slammed the door behind them, then threwnumerous bolts to keep the barricade intact. Once they were securely lockedinside, the guard captain said, “Welcome to Ildakar.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 7 [contents.xhtml#c_ch7]Nicci didn’t like to have doors closed behind her. Or locked.After the small common entry was sealed, she looked up at the tall ceremonialgate that towered above her head. The door seemed impenetrable, the layered woodadorned with exotic designs, even the rippling curves of denial-basedspell-forms.Nathan also pondered the wooden barrier behind him, his brow furrowed, but thenhe forced a smile. He said to Nicci, “We wanted to come to this city, and nowwe’re inside. I will take that as a good thing.”Taking the lead, she faced High Captain Avery. With her black dress, long blondhair, and shapely form, Nicci did not look intimidating, even with a dagger ateach hip, but the intensity of her blue-eyed gaze gave the guard captain pause.“I am Nicci, a representative of the D’Haran Empire. This is Nathan Rahl, wizardand roving ambassador for D’Hara.”“And this is our companion, Bannon,” Nathan added.The young man touched the sword at his side. “I help defend them.” He glanced atthe three youths, who slipped away into the crowds without even looking back atthem.Avery regarded them with a narrow stony face that was both handsome and aloof.He had close-cropped brown hair and sported a well-groomed mustache, but therest of his face was clean-shaven.“We have come to Ildakar to speak to your leaders,” Nicci said.“Then it is my obligation to take you to the ruling tower. Up there.” With abrusque nod, he indicated the top of the plateau high above these lower levelsof the city. A sleek tower rose from the summit, overlooking the streets below.“I don’t know if the wizards’ duma is in session, but the sovrena and the wizardcommander will be there.” Leaving other guards at the gate, Avery commanded fiveof the armed men to accompany them as an escort through the streets.Ildakar was a city that throbbed with colors, exotic smells, and fascinatingsights. They walked at a brisk military pace, as if Avery had no interest indelay or small talk. People watched them as they marched past, and Bannon turnedfrom side to side as he drank in the turbulence of fascination. “This city iseven bigger than Tanimura.”Nicci assessed the streets and buildings around her. “Tanimura is moresprawling, but Ildakar is contained, everything compact, not an inch wasted.”Nobles, merchants, and tradesmen wore loose, clean clothes with accents of richcolors, while others wore drab linen pants and rough tunics with frayed sleevesand necklines. Instead of well-tooled boots, the drab ones wore only sandals.Nicci assumed they were the lower classes, the workers, for they were carryingwater jugs, pulling carts, lifting crates, or sweeping out gutters. And theykept their eyes averted.Following the guards along the winding cobblestoned streets, she noticed thateven here in the lower level, the paving was well maintained, the walkways wereswept. The brick homes were covered with whitewash, the roofs layered with bakedterra-cotta tiles, glazed with bright colors, like the scales of a dragon.Workers climbed wooden ladders and stood on the roofs, repairing loose tiles orinstalling new glazed pieces to make striped patterns that could only be seenfrom the upper levels of Ildakar.Gold-trimmed purple banners hung from high buildings or bell towers. The bannersbore the ubiquitous symbol of Ildakar, a stylized sun from which emanated jaggedlightning bolts. The design looked powerful and dangerous at the same time.The streets formed an upward, spiraling curve like a graceful snail’s shell thatrose to the top of the tapering plateau. The most magnificent buildings occupiedthe upper level, grand villas and a prominent stair-stepped pyramid as well asthe high tower on the edge of an abrupt drop-off.“From a geological perspective, this is quite unusual,” Nathan said. “Thewizards of Ildakar must have extruded this high mound to make it a defensiblefortress above the plain.”Avery gave a curt nod. “Yes, rather than find a place that suited their needs,the wizards created exactly what they wanted, right here. They uplifted half ofthe valley, then constructed this magnificent city, which has stood formillennia—and will stand for eternity.”They reached a small square where alleys intersected with the main thoroughfare.At a fountain where water spilled out of cast bronze river fish, women filledjugs of water. Others gathered to wash at hemispherical public basins mounted onprominent walls, filled with trickling water supplied by aqueducts that ranthroughout the city.In terraces along the city slopes, narrow strips of arable land held tightlypacked orchards of dwarf fruit and nut trees. Narrow vineyards rolled up slopes,where precariously balanced workers picked the grapes and filled baskets slungat their hips. Agile children in drab clothes climbed the dense vines of hanginggardens, swinging out to reach among the foliage to pluck fruit. Flowers growingin pots on windowsills added a splash of color and sweet perfume to the air.Nicci felt a brief pang. The flower gardens reminded her of Thistle, how thespunky young girl had longed to see the world restored to beauty, includingfrivolous flower gardens. Nicci herself had been forced to kill the girl inorder to obtain the weapon she needed. That black twist of grief and guilt madeher pause briefly in her step; then she focused her thoughts, hardened the wallsaround her emotions. She had long ago formed a heart of black ice, and shedidn’t want to let it melt now.“Are those olive trees up on that outcropping?” Nathan pointed, tossing back hisshoulder-length white hair. “I do enjoy olives.”“That is the sovrena’s private grove. You will find them especially deliciousbecause the ground is fertilized by the bodies of slaves.”Nicci felt a chill. “And that makes them taste better?”Avery nodded. “More vibrant, more plump. Filled with life.”“I doubt the slaves would agree,” Bannon muttered.The people in Ildakar seemed calm, although Nicci detected little mirth andheard no music. The conversations seemed businesslike rather than joyous.Nathan asked, “Do you get many visitors from outside, Captain? How often is theshroud down so the rest of the world can see Ildakar?”“In fifteen hundred years we have lost contact with much of the world, but we doreceive some outside trade, mostly via the river, but also from some of the hilltowns to the north. At present, few enough people know that Ildakar has emergedfrom behind the veil of time.”“Then we are glad to reestablish a diplomatic conversation,” Nathan said. “Wewish to tell you about the D’Haran Empire and Lord Rahl’s new rule. I also havean important personal request.”“Our leaders will hear you,” Avery said, though he promised nothing more.“Sovrena Thora and Wizard Commander Maxim will decide whether or not you canstay in Ildakar, or if you must leave before the shroud is restored again.”Nicci frowned. “Your invitation is premature, Captain. We have not asked toremain here, and we plan to leave before we are trapped.”Avery failed to grasp the reason for her concern. “I did not make an invitation,merely stated a fact. It is the sovrena’s decision.”Heading away from them down the street, a young man in a plain tunic and stainedpantaloons drove a group of lumbering beasts of burden, thick-shoulderedcattlelike creatures with brown fur. The beasts plodded away, bleating outmournful sounds, as if in a slow-motion march to an executioner.“Get those yaxen out of the way, boy!” Avery grumbled. “Use the backthoroughfares, not the main streets.”“Sorry, my lord Captain.” The young man had a mop of brown hair and flashed agrin to reveal his missing front tooth. “The beasts need to drink at thefountain, and then I’ll put them right back down the side street.”“They shouldn’t be drinking from the public fountain, not in the high levels ofthe city.”“But the sovrena says the water is for everyone.”“Yes, she does.” Avery’s voice turned into a growl. “But water them in yourplace. These fountains are for gifted nobles and higher tradesmen. They don’twant their water tainted by yaxen spittle.”“Apologies, my lord Captain,” the boy said, without sounding contrite at all. Hesnapped the sharp tip of a switch against the hindquarters of the rearmostyaxen. The beasts moved forward, bleating out their dismal moans.Two of the creatures turned their heads to look back at them, and Nicci wasshocked to see not the wide-set eyes and flat bovine visage of a stupid cow.Rather, the yaxen faces looked eerily humanlike, with the distorted expressionsof damned men. Shaggy hair covered their heads, and thick beards ran along theirchins. Their mouths were open, letting pale ribbons of drool run out. Bluntedhorns atop the skull seemed to be no more than decoration. Both yaxen turnedaway and plodded onward.Nicci stared, shocked by what she had seen. “Dear spirits, are they human?”“Far less than human,” Avery said. “They are yaxen.”After the boy had driven the animals away, the escort led them across the squaretoward a side street. When the buildings opened up above her, Nicci saw theruling tower, which loomed above them at the top of the plateau, reminding herof the fortress lighthouse that rose over Grafan Harbor.Among the milling people on this side of the square, Nicci detected anexcitement she hadn’t noticed before. Men and women in the drab clothes of lowerclasses jabbered and whispered next to the more colorful merchants and nobles.When Avery and his guards pushed forward to investigate, someone let out awarning whistle. The crowd melted into private businesses, ducking into doorwaysand hurrying away like a flock of birds that scattered into the sky.Avery’s expression darkened as he marched up to a brick wall just around thecorner in a side street. Glinting silvery shards had been thrust like ornamentsbetween cracks in the bricks. Other reflective glints protruded from the wood ofthe doorjambs and window frames.“Look at the little mirrors,” Bannon said. “Someone decorated this alley.”Avery withdrew his short sword and used the flat of the blade to smash themirror shards. He called to his men, “Remove them all! Search these streets andmake sure there are no more.” He swept his sword again, releasing the sound oftinkling reflective glass. “Clean up every bit.”“Are you afraid of your reflection?” Nicci asked with a hint of sarcasm.The guard captain rounded on her. “I’m more concerned with rebels. The followersof Mirrormask did this. They want us to believe their numbers are greater thanthey really are, and they do this in the middle of the night to taunt us. Wecannot let them gain a foothold.”“Mirrormask?” Nathan mused. “Now that sounds like an interesting story. Wouldyou tell us the tale before we reach the tower?”“No. As captain of the city guard, it is my duty to protect and defend Ildakar.If you want stories, ask the sovrena or the wizard commander.”He abruptly cut off his conversation as he marched at a faster pace. Near thetop of the plateau, the sloping streets were filled with more gardens, orchards,and trellises. Avery did not speak another word until they reached the entranceto the ruling tower."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 8 [contents.xhtml#c_ch8]The high pillar of stone rose up from the edge of the sandstone plateau like thetusk of some ancient beast. Serpentine loops and lines carved into the tower’souter walls formed an intricate web that spiraled up to the pinnacle thatoverlooked the residential district and winding streets below.Nathan stared up at the sheer face of the tower. “Dear spirits, that’s a web—aprotective spell constructed into the tower. This place must be impregnable.”“It is said to be,” Avery replied. “But it has not been tested, since no oneever breached the outer walls of Ildakar.”The broad summit of the plateau was populated with numerous palatial buildings,villas, and an imposing pyramid adorned with curved metal devices; Nicciwondered if the stair-stepped structure might be an astronomical observatory.They had a breathtaking view of the city below, with terraced fields and hanginggardens, fountains and reservoirs, glittering cisterns and enamel-painted tileroofs that spread out like a rainbow across the buildings far below.“I am impressed with these defenses,” Nicci said. “A city endures if its peopleremember that there are always others who wish to destroy it.”Avery stepped through the curved arch of the tower’s entrance, and they followedhim inside. Nicci felt the temperature drop by several degrees. Bannon wipedperspiration from his brow, smearing his long ginger hair out of the way. “It’smuch cooler in here.”“The wizards keep it that way,” Avery said. “Note the glyphs on the walls.”The strange designs carved into the interior stone blocks emanated magic, andNicci realized these were concentration points of a passive spell. “Transferencemagic?”Nathan nodded. “Yes, the glyphs drain excess heat from the air and channel itelsewhere, possibly to kitchens or fireplaces.”Avery did not offer his opinion as he led them deeper inside to a dominantcentral staircase, a cascade of steps hewn out of variegated stone, green-veinedgranite, white and black marble. The ornamental balustrades were carved likeeels looping down the staircase.The stairs led up to a landing, then another flight of stairs, then a thirdlanding higher in the tower. At the third landing, the stairs opened up into awide receiving room. As she followed the guard captain, Nicci instinctivelyunderstood the psychology of the construction. Jagang had taught her much whenhe built so many enormous structures as he swept over the land. The steepstairs, the several landings, and finally the open gallery into a grandiose mainroom—the architecture was designed to delay supplicants, to leave them flushedand breathless by the time they faced the powerful rulers.But Nicci refused to tremble when she met the leaders of Ildakar, whoever theywere.Inside the great chamber, slanted sunlight shone through high arched windowsthat dominated one of the side walls. The view through the thin panes of clearglass showed the sprawling city far below.Avery’s boots made loud noises as he strode across blue marble tiles that werepolished to such a sheen they looked like puddles of water. Like an island abovethe lake of blue marble, a raised dais featured two ornate and imposing chairs,on which sat a man and a woman. At each side of the main floor, two curvedmarble tables with empty stone benches were reserved for more council members,three or four on each side.Avery stepped up to the raised dais and dropped to one knee. His fur-lined capespread out across his shoulders and back. “Sovrena Thora, Wizard CommanderMaxim, I bring you visitors from beyond the shroud, from a distant land calledD’Hara.”Sovrena Thora was a tall, willowy woman so beautiful she seemed to be made ofporcelain. She had a narrow chin, a rosebud mouth, and haunting sea-green eyes.Her lustrous hair was like threads of polished brass done up in intricate loopsand whorls. Her fine gown of sky-blue silk was trimmed with bands of stripedgray fur. The dress hung in a rippling band from her left shoulder, wrappedaround her ample breasts; reaching her narrow waist, the fabric became awaterfall of skirts that draped over her bent knees and down to her ankles.On either side of her chair hung two gold-wire cages that held flitting,chirping songbirds, but Thora seemed to pay no attention to the scatteredbirdsong.Next to her sat a handsome man of average build, presumably Wizard CommanderMaxim. He had short brown hair, dark eyebrows, and a dark goatee. Wearing animpish smile, he lounged back in his throne, one knee crossed over the other.His black pantaloons seemed woven from obsidian fiber rather than silk. Hisshirt was open, and an amethyst pendant hung from a gold chain around his throatto nest among the dark curls of his chest hair.Drawing upon her promises to Richard, Nicci took charge and stepped forward,head held high. She summoned the presence of her personality as she faced thetwo leaders, refusing to bow as High Captain Avery had. “We’ve heard of thislegendary city, and we come with the news of Lord Rahl and the golden age hewill bring to the world.”Thora sat ramrod straight and looked directly at Nicci, ignoring Nathan andBannon, and spoke in a strong, husky voice. “We welcome you, but Ildakar isindependent. We have little interest in the outside world.”“Even though the outside world always had interest in us,” Maxim interjected,cocking a grin. “My dear Thora possesses no curiosity.” He rose from the thronein a fluid, catlike movement, stepping toward Nicci. “Welcome to Ildakar. We arealways eager to meet intrepid explorers from the hostile world outside of ourprotective bubble.” He waved his left hand to indicate generalized butunidentified lands beyond the boundaries of the city.While Bannon hung back, clearly out of his depth, Nathan followed Nicci’s lead.The former wizard fluffed the front of his ruffled shirt, adjusted his own cape,and tried to make himself presentable. He broke in, smiling. “We have muchknowledge to share, and we can benefit greatly from one another.” He brushedback his long hair, seeming oddly uncertain, even nervous. Nicci knew how badlyhe wanted answers.Gathering his courage, Bannon stepped up to join Nicci and Nathan. Before shecould caution him to remain silent, the young man blurted out, “We saw your cityfrom Kol Adair. We came from over the mountains. I am from Chiriya Island. Maybeyou’ve heard of it?”“Islands are in the sea,” Sovrena Thora said. “And the sea is far from here,miles downriver and beyond the estuary.”“Then perhaps we should know more about it, my dear,” said Maxim. “Knowledgeequals power.”“We have enough power,” Thora said.“Never enough power.”“You two must be married,” Nathan pointed out, striking a light tone. “Is thattrue?”“For nearly two thousand years,” Maxim said, “even before General Utros came tolay siege to the city.”Thora’s icy expression indicated that she had stopped counting the years ofmarriage long ago, and simply endured.The doors opened on the side of the receiving room, and six wizards hurried in,gifted men and a woman wearing robes and amulets, carrying staffs or otherobvious trappings of their position. High Captain Avery rose to his feet andstepped back. “The wizards’ duma has arrived.”Still sitting on her throne, Thora said, “Thank you for summoning them, Captain.The duma members should hear what these guests have to say.” She paused. “Incase any of it is relevant.”Wizard Commander Maxim strolled down from the dais and crossed the blue marblefloor to the long stone tables as the other six wizards took their seats. Heswept his hands out in a grand gesture, looking back at the guests. “Allow me tointroduce the other primary wizards of Ildakar—Damon, Elsa, Quentin, Ivan,Andre, and Renn.”Nathan gave a brief respectful bow, but he raised his eyebrows in a question.“An even number of voters on a council? You must all be in agreement.”“They are,” Thora said.“We used to have an odd number, but one sorceress decided to challenge thesovrena. Very unwise.” Maxim stroked his dark goatee. “And as you see, she losther bid. Poor Lani.” He indicated a white statue standing on display oppositethe wall of windows—a tall, regal-looking woman whose hair was in ringlets, allpreserved in stone. Her face looked angry, her hand outstretched, her fingerscurled as if about to release a spell. But she had been petrified in place.“That happened a century ago,” Thora said. “No one has challenged me since.”“We have done just fine without Lani, hmmm?” said the wizard named Andre. He hada shaved head and a gray-brown beard tightly braided like a thick brush thatprotruded from the point of his chin. “We have our own work in Ildakar, each ofus with our special areas of expertise.”Nicci looked from Maxim to Thora, noting the icy, invisible curtain that seemedto hang between them. She couldn’t help but contrast this coldness with thedepthless love that Richard and Kahlan had for each other. The sovrena and thewizard commander clearly had no such bond, at least not anymore.“Fifteen centuries of peace,” mused Elsa, a matronly woman who wore deep purplerobes. “At one time we all banded together to defend Ildakar, and we succeeded.Now we have Ildakar … exactly as it is.”“Exactly as it is,” Thora agreed. “We preserved Ildakar. We built our ownperfect society, just as we wish it to be.”“We saw the army outside,” Nathan said. “Hundreds of thousands of warriorsturned to stone. That is quite an impressive display of your magic. They’ve beenhere—petrified, all those centuries?”“Challenging our city was the greatest mistake General Utros made,” said Maxim.“That fool Emperor Kurgan thought that if he had a big enough army, he couldsimply walk all over the world, take anything he liked.” Maxim tugged at thesilk fabric of his open shirt, as if he’d grown hot in the chamber. “But as youcould see, even an army so huge was no match for the wizards of Ildakar.” Hestrolled in front of the seated duma members. “While Iron Fang lounged in hiscapital and let his general do all the fighting for him, our city built updefenses that proved to be his downfall.”Thora picked up the story, as if to upstage her husband. “General Utros broughthis armies over the mountains. According to our scouts, he started with an armyhalf a million strong, but only part of it survived to lay siege to Ildakar. Buthow does one feed an army of such size?”“Or half that size, for that matter,” the wizard Damon interjected. He hadshoulder-length dark hair and long drooping mustaches, each tip adorned with apearl.Ivan, a gruff and burly man with thick black hair and an unruly black beard,hunched at his bench, as if looking for something to break. He wore a tan jerkinof animal hide branded with strange symbols. With a sharp realization, Niccithought the leather jerkin looked much like Mrra’s marked hide. Ivan grumbled,“We may have done them a favor by turning them to stone. We should have leftthem to starve out there. Or fester with disease. Let them rot and die while welaughed at them from inside the city.”“By joining together, we defeated them with a single blow,” Thora said, stillsitting in her tall chair. “We worked massive magic, unleashed power from thesoul of our people. And, oh, the cost…” She looked at her husband with grudgingrespect. “The wizard commander was the focal point for the petrification spell.Maxim used the magic and turned them all to stone.”He seemed immensely pleased with himself. “I was always the best sculptor inIldakar, although my dear wife has potent magic as well—which she used againstdear Lani.”“We stopped the siege and defeated Utros’s army, but we knew more war wouldcome,” Thora continued. “Emperor Kurgan might raise another force to getrevenge, or if not Kurgan, then some other despot. We were weary of it.” Thesovrena’s porcelain face grew flushed.“We were also bored with it,” Maxim added, flashing a smile at Nicci. Shestiffened. Was he flirting with her? The wizard commander continued, “So, weremoved ourselves from the perilous outside world. We built the properspell-forms throughout the walls of the city and then raised a shroud thatencapsulated us in a protective reality where we have remained safe for onethousand five hundred years.” He crossed his thin arms over his open shirt.Thora slid one slender leg over the other, rippling her sky-blue skirts. “Thusleaving us free to create our perfect society here.” She looked down at thevisitors, and her smile reminded Nicci of the curve of a sharp knife."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 9 [contents.xhtml#c_ch9]As they descended the last line of mountains heading west, far from Cliffwall,the two young scholars paused to stare at the wide band of water ahead of them.Yes, they were on an important mission for the sorceress Nicci, but wouldwonders never cease?Oliver blinked several times, trying to focus his eyes. After all his years inthe isolated archive, his vision was better suited for close-up reading,studying countless documents in faded handwriting by lamplight. This expansivelandscape stretched his imagination. “Is that the ocean?” he asked with a clearsense of awe. “I’ve never seen the ocean.”“No one from Cliffwall has,” said Peretta, “not in our lifetimes.” Standing alltoo close to him, the skinny young woman shaded her eyes against the slantingafternoon sun. She was a memmer, one of those who used their gift to memorizecountless volumes of magical and historical lore from the wizards’ archive.Unfortunately, that ability seemed to make Peretta think she knew everything.“But that isn’t the sea.” She extended her thin arm, pointing a stern finger asif she were about to lecture him. “It’s just a river flowing down toward theocean, exactly as the people of Lockridge told us. You can see the bank on theopposite side.”Oliver squinted again. Yes, there was a bank on the other side, not eventerribly far away. “It’s so much wider than the water running through theCliffwall canyons.”Peretta sniffed. “All we had was a stream. This is a real river.”Oliver adjusted his pack on his shoulders. His muscles were sore from so manydays of walking across the Old World, and the straps had chafed his skin. “AndI’ve never seen a real river either.” He knew he and his companion still had along way to go to deliver their important message back to Lord Richard Rahl.Peretta flashed him a rare smile. “Neither have I.”The girl was quite pretty when she let the stern, know-it-all expression fadeaway. Peretta was eighteen years old, gangly and awkward, even scrawny. Her bestfeatures, Oliver thought, were her large brown eyes and the ringlets of brunettehair that stood out like a spray of dandelion puff around her head. Despite hisdim eyesight, he could see his companion quite clearly when he looked at her upclose—and they had spent a great deal of time up close since leaving the hiddencanyons that held the great archive.With the river in front of them, the two set off out of the foothills, followinga worn track that grew wider, rutted from wagon wheels. On either side of thetrack, grasses, weeds, and flowers grew tall, interspersed with wild rosebushesor low willows. The very idea that others had traveled this way, maybe evenrecently, made him feel less homesick. They were such a long way from Cliffwall.Oliver began to hope they might find a village up ahead, where friendly peoplewould offer a good meal and evening conversation, not to mention nice lodgings,two separate beds … or even a single lumpy mattress if necessary. He and Perettahad learned how to make the best of their situation. They both had the same goalsince the sorceress Nicci had dispatched them on their mission.The people of Cliffwall—and the whole world—owed a great debt to Nicci and hercompanions. First, the sorceress had defeated the Lifedrinker, whose powersthreatened to suck the world dry; after that, Nicci had destroyed Victoria andher destructive explosion of growth. That had cost the life of the poor orphangirl Thistle, and in great grief they had laid Thistle to rest overlooking thevalley the girl had helped to save.But Nicci and Nathan had their own goals as well. In gratitude for theirservices, and also because it was the right thing to do, the people of Cliffwallhad dispatched two volunteers to make the long journey across the unchartedcontinent, to make their way up to Tanimura and the D’Haran Empire. Oliver andPeretta carried letters to Lord Rahl, along with copies of the informationNathan had written in his life book. Most importantly, Lord Rahl and the Sistersof the Light needed to know about the wealth of magical knowledge held inCliffwall.Caught up in the excitement of the moment, Oliver had volunteered to go on thetrek, thinking of the possibilities of the wide world he had only read about. Hehadn’t known a whit about what he had agreed to do.Peretta agreed to accompany him, representing her fellow memmers, who were oftenat odds with traditional scholars like Oliver. Because evil Victoria had beenthe leader of the memmer faction, he wondered if Peretta felt driven by guilt orobligation. No one had questioned why either of them wanted to go. They justwent.While packing for the journey, Oliver had combed through the archive, lookingfor reference works on the inhabited lands west of the mountains, the coastline,and the immense ocean. He was a fidgety, skittish young man, often sickly in hisyounger years. Growing up in the book-crowded tunnels within the great mesa, hehad immersed himself in reading and cataloging. Cliffwall students were supposedto inventory thousands of volumes, simply marking down titles, organizing thebooks, scrolls, and tablets. But nothing more—the archived magical lore was notto be used, because it was deemed too dangerous. And it was.“Before true learning can begin, we must know the contents of our library,”scholar-archivist Simon had once told them. Unfortunately, Oliver often becameso engrossed in what he was reading that he would spend hours studyinghistories, legends, geography, and intricate magical lore … and entirely forgetabout the task of cataloging.Before leaving, he made a point of studying the known western maps, and when hewas ready to depart, an impatient Peretta had met him outside the canyon city.“I was already prepared to go.” She tapped her forehead. “I have all thenecessary knowledge up here. You didn’t need to bother.”Heading out of the canyons and the high desert plateau, the two had retracedtheir path, following Nathan’s detailed descriptions and cartographical notes.Thanks to the Lifedrinker’s deadly influence for years, most of the settlementsaround the great valley had been abandoned, and little remained except forghostly foundations of homes and empty streets.Up in the mountains, however, the two travelers found villagers, miners,farmers, shepherds in little settlements that seemed to have awakened from adeep and confusing sleep. They reached the town of Lockridge, and when Oliverinvoked the names of Nicci and Nathan, the two travelers were exuberantlywelcomed and given everything they could need.Now, many days later as he and Peretta walked along the river road, listening tothe gentle slosh of the current, Oliver considered the journey ahead of them,how far Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon had come from the D’Haran Empire. His sorefeet made him despondent about the countless steps still to be taken, but hechided himself with a philosophical adage he had always used as inspiration backin Cliffwall. You can finish even the thickest book if you read one page at atime. And you can read the entire library, one book at a time, one shelf at atime, one room at a time.Oliver decided to view their journey in the same way.A speckled trout leaped out of the river with a splash, snatched a fly in theair, then plunged back into the water. Oliver paused to watch the dissipatingripples. “I’m impressed with this river,” he said. “I know we’re going the rightdirection, because rivers flow to the sea—and we need to get to the sea.”“I already knew that,” Peretta said, tossing her brunette ringlets. She marchedahead of him, leading the way along the dirt path.* * *Heading downriver, they found more villages, and the people welcomed the wearytravelers, who had no coins to pay for food or lodgings. They did have stories,however.More important, the villagers gave them directions, which helped the two orientthemselves. Oliver knew their next main destination was the fishing town ofRenda Bay on the coast, where Nicci and her companions had driven away theNorukai slavers.One afternoon they walked under the hazy sunlight, miserable in the humid air,which was far different from the dry desert. The river spawned lush vegetation,tall cattails, and wild daisies, but also countless gnats and mosquitoes. Oliverwaved his hand in front of his face, but did not succeed in driving them away.“I think they want to drink our sweat … as if there wasn’t enough water all overthe place.”Peretta tossed her curls. “They’re not after our sweat. They drink blood. I knowall about it from one of the volumes I memorized.”“Of course you do,” Oliver muttered under his breath.She frustrated him. Sometimes he delighted in the girl’s company. They wouldexchange stories to pass the time as they covered mile after mile. He would tellher things he had read, and she would recite passages from particularlyinteresting books. Then her mood would change, and she seemed to consider theircompanionship a competition. Oliver had put up with it, not wanting to pick afight.Once, though, she had stumbled in midsentence, forgetting words she’d memorized,and she reacted as if the mistake were a devastating failure. Tears brimmed inPeretta’s dark brown eyes, and her lip trembled. She dashed into the tall weeds,insisting that she needed to use the bushes. She was gone a long time, andOliver knew she was crying, but he didn’t understand why.…They continued along the well-traveled river road, reaching a point where thehills opened up. The two stopped as the river spread out in front of them,widening as it drained into a bay. The world ahead was an endless landscape ofblue water laced with white foamy waves. Oliver’s stomach sank at the thought ofall that water. He couldn’t see any end to it, but not because his eyesight wasweak. The water did extend forever, vanishing over the horizon.Next to him, Peretta stopped in midsentence, blinking her big brown eyes. With agasp, she reached out to touch his arm. “Dear spirits, it looks like half theworld is flooded!”“I think that’s the ocean,” he said.Peretta nodded, and for once, she didn’t argue. “I believe you are correct.”At the mouth of the river they found the village of Renda Bay, exactly as theywere expecting. Feeling a spring in their step, they walked into the town,recalling the stories the visitors had told about the slaver raid, how Bannon,Nathan, and Nicci had fought back the ruthless Norukai, leaving the villagers topick up the pieces.When the people of Renda Bay saw Oliver and Peretta coming down the inland road,they reacted without surprise. Apparently, trade was commonplace up and down theriver.As they approached, Oliver and Peretta raised their hands in greeting. Severalpeople came forward wearing curious expressions, and Oliver invoked the namethat he knew would inspire a welcome. “The sorceress Nicci sent us here, and weare on our way to D’Hara.”“It’s a very long way,” Peretta said. “We hope you can help us.”A murmur of recognition and surprise rippled among the villagers. Oliver lookedaround and saw the bright, bare wood of new construction in the main town, aswell as stone towers being built on either side of the bay’s headlands.One broad-shouldered man with short light brown hair grinned at them. His facelooked weary, his eyes baggy as if he had slept little in recent weeks. “I amThaddeus, the new leader of this town. If you’ve been sent by the ones who savedus, then you are welcome here. How can we help?”Peretta stepped forward, speaking quickly, “We have vital information from Nicciand Nathan, as well as news of the Cliffwall archive. We have strictinstructions to report to Lord Rahl and the Sisters of the Light, as soon as wecan find them.”Thaddeus nodded. “They gave us the same instructions before they departedupriver. We already dispatched a pair of messengers heading north … but we don’tknow how far away it is. And you two will have much more of the story to tell.”Oliver wiped sweat from his forehead, shooing away a buzzing fly before heanswered. “We need a boat and someone who can take us up the Phantom Coast tothe cities in the north. That’s a start.”The town leader did not hesitate. “Then we will provide it. We would do anythingto assist Nicci.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 10 [contents.xhtml#c_ch10]The wizards of Ildakar welcomed the outside visitors with a fine celebration.After centuries of reading about the mythical city from ages past, Nathanreveled in being here in person, in walking through the spiraling streets,seeing the terraced gardens, the whitewashed buildings, the enameled roofs, andthe magnificent high towers. He wanted to pinch himself to make sure he hadn’tfallen into some kind of trance.But his interest in the glories of Ildakar was more than just academic. He alsoheld on to a hope that the solution lay here, a hope that had blossomed insidehim as soon as he glimpsed the metropolis from the giddy heights of Kol Adair.From there, the Wizard will behold what he needs to make himself whole again.Now he knew what that meant. Nathan felt sure this place was where he needed tobe, that the legendary, gifted wizards could help restore him, make him whole.“There is no better reason for a grand banquet.” Wizard Commander Maxim raisedhis voice and shouted loudly enough in the throne hall to startle Thora’s cagedlarks. “Summon the cooks! Slaughter a fresh yaxen. Command the bakers to dotheir finest. We shall have a feast!” Maxim flashed a quick sarcastic glance atthe sovrena’s icy demeanor. “As you can see, my wife can barely contain herexcitement.”Thora ran her hands down the blue dress that clung like oil to her body.“Ildakar will defend against all enemies from within and without, but we arewarm and kind to our friends.”High Captain Avery stood next to the sovrena, and Nathan noted that he showed adistinct fondness toward her. Although he was supposedly the military captainfor the entire city, Avery seemed much more interested in protecting the coldlybeautiful woman.Servants came forward, eyes downcast, voices muted. Under orders, they usheredNathan, Nicci, and Bannon out of the ruling tower and across the top of theplateau toward a large, ostentatious villa.“This is the mansion of the wizard commander and the sovrena,” said one of theservants, a man whose demeanor was like a walking sigh. “You will each have aguest room where you can wash and change into fresh garments, which we willprovide. The banquet will commence in an hour.” The man smiled politely, butwithout warmth. “I hope you are hungry.”When his stomach growled, Nathan decided he was also in the mood for a feast. Hewas anxious to describe his problem, to ask the wizards for their help restoringhis gift, so that he could use powerful magic again.…“An hour?” Bannon said. “A banquet that grand should take days to prepare.”The servant’s eyes narrowed, showing crow’s-feet at the edges. “It should, butthe council members will not wish to wait. As they have commanded, so we willprovide.”The grand villa was an enormous structure adorned with elaborate flourishes.Marble columns veined with red and gold stood tall, their ornate capitalsengraved with prevalent spell runes. Purple banners hung down, displaying thesun-and-lightning-bolt symbol of Ildakar.After the servants took Bannon and Nicci to their respective rooms, Nathanlooked around his own chamber at the spacious bed, the gauzy hangings across theopen windows, flowerpots filled with scarlet snapdragons and a blush ofgeraniums that tumbled over the rail of the open balcony. A reflective basin ofwater hung on the wall, a hemispherical bowl for washing.When he dipped his hands in, Nathan shattered the reflection that stared back athim. Travel dust encrusted his face, and his long hair was stringier than usual.He washed quickly and inspected the garments the servants had laid out for him.It would feel so good to enjoy civilized finery again.An hour later, refreshed and wearing clean clothes in the Ildakaran style,Nathan Rahl felt like a new man again, though still not a wizard. His borrowedrobe was made of heavy silk, a deep emerald green trimmed with copper on thecuffs and hem. It was an entirely different look than his dashing travelclothes, but at least the robe was fresh.He straightened his damp hair with the tortoiseshell comb he had found among thedebris after their shipwreck on the Phantom Coast. He was pleasantly surprisedto discover that his hair had grown long enough that he could tie it in backwith a ribbon. Finding no mirrors to assess his appearance, he looked at hisreflection in the wall basin and decided that he was once again appropriatelyhandsome. He cut a dashing figure, as befitted the roving ambassador for D’Hara.When he joined Nicci and Bannon in the hall outside the banquet chamber, he sawthat the young swordsman had also washed and put on a new maroon tunic, a blacksash, and loose brown pantaloons, which he wore awkwardly.Nicci had been offered fine garments herself, but she had chosen to launder herblack traveling dress, then dried it using her gift. Although it was a differentcut from the more flowing Ildakaran fashion, Nicci remained strikingly beautifulwith her blond hair brushed and pinned back. She wore no jewelry, despite themany options her hosts had offered her. She didn’t seem to need it.“You look glamorous just as you are, Sorceress,” Nathan said.She looked at him, raised her eyebrows. “My intent is not to be glamorous, butto engender respect.”“Indeed, and your glamour and beauty engender a great deal of respect.”“Then I also hope I can help you achieve what you need here, Wizard. We would beglad to have you back in fine form.” She turned, following the servants into thevilla’s banquet hall. He knew that Nicci had never been comfortable receivingcompliments, nor did she often give them.Bannon was smiling as he tagged along. “I’ve never been to a city like this. Anda banquet with royalty! Sweet Sea Mother, I wish I could tell everyone back onChiriya.”“And who exactly would you tell? I thought you didn’t have anyone left on yourisland.” Nathan did not think about the pain that his comment would cause.The young man’s expression fell. Back on Chiriya Island, his father had beenterribly abusive, had beaten Bannon’s mother to death. Bannon’s boyhood friendIan had been seized by Norukai raiders, leaving the young man to deal with theguilt of escaping. No, reminding him about his island home did not bring fondmemories.Deeply apologetic, Nathan squeezed Bannon’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, my boy. We areoff to see the world as you wished, and Ildakar is our most importantdestination. We’ll enjoy it together.”Bannon re-formed his bright expression. “Yes, we will.”The three of them entered the enormous banquet hall, a broad chamber with openceilings and dangling vines of morning glories that drooped from an openceiling. Lavish bouquets filled pots every five feet along the banquet table.Another golden songbird cage hung on a stand behind the seat reserved for thesovrena. The larks flitted about within their confinement, and a few deigned tosing.When Nathan looked at the extravagant food spread out, his stomach growledagain. In the middle of a table sat a sizzling rack of herb-encrusted meat thatdripped juices onto an oval basin. Baskets held knotted breads studded withberries and dried fruits, like jewels embedded in gold. Bowls were piled highwith sliced fruits and curdled puddings; other serving dishes held roastedpotatoes and colorful root vegetables slathered with melting butter. Servantsbustled about like ants from a stirred-up colony.While Thora and Maxim sat at the head of the table and High Captain Avery stoodat attention nearby, the six duma members were spaced along each side of thetable. Nathan was surprised to find Amos and his two young companions alsojoining them for the banquet. Seeing the three young men, Bannon smiled ingreeting, then looked uncertain when they didn’t seem to notice him.Elsa, the matronly member of the wizards’ duma, sat wearing an ornate lacy grayshawl and a silver dress around her sturdy frame. She looked up at Nathan andindicated the empty seat next to her. “Wizard, would you join me? The chairbeside the wizard commander is reserved for the sorceress Nicci.”“I would be delighted to, my dear,” Nathan said, taking the seat.Elsa was a woman who would be labeled “handsome” rather than beautiful. Shereminded him of the prelate Annalina Aldurren, with whom he had spent so muchtime after they had concocted their escape from the Palace of the Prophets. Annhad been an interesting, if often frustrating, traveling companion, but he hadgrown tremendously fond of her. He felt saddened to recall that the Sisters ofthe Dark had killed her, but as a result of living for a thousand years, losingfriends and acquaintances was just something he had to accept.He fashioned a smile for Elsa and adjusted himself, tugging a slick wrinkle fromhis green robe. “Delicious aromas, as well as fine company.”“Ildakar must do its best,” Sovrena Thora said. “We are anxious to hear whereyou come from—and why you are here.”Nicci sat upright next to Maxim, looking fine in her black dress. The platebefore her was empty, while the duma members waited to be served by the hoveringservants. A tall man with long arms reached over with a curved knife, slicinghunks of the dripping, savory meat from the large roast. He deposited a pieceonto Nicci’s plate before serving Nathan and then Bannon.“The roast yaxen is marvelous, a true specialty of our city,” said Maxim,smacking his lips.“Give me a slice of the rarest part,” grumbled Ivan from his seat.Beside him, the wizard Andre explained, “Yaxen are specifically bred to yieldthe most delicious flesh. We have been meticulous with our breeding over fifteenhundred years of confinement, hmmm? Each morsel will melt in your mouth.” Heraised his plate to accept a portion from the roast.Not particularly interested in the food, Nicci said in a businesslike voice,“We’ve come from D’Hara, where Lord Richard Rahl defeated the resurrectedSulachan, and before that, Jagang and the Imperial Order. After Lord Rahl’svictory, we come to the Old World to describe his new peace and to ensure thatthere are no further tyrants.”Nathan dabbed a napkin at his lips as he raised his voice. “We’ve come forpersonal reasons as well. We believe a witch woman guided us here.” He pulledhis life book from the leather pouch he always carried at his side. “This iswhat set us on our course,” he said, and read aloud the words that were writtenthere.“Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard willbehold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must savethe world.”He smiled at them. “We saw your city from the mountain pass exactly as thesewords predicted, so we think someone here may be able to help make me wholeagain.”Andre looked him up and down. “And what part are you missing right now, hmmm?”Nathan fidgeted with sudden uncertainty when it came time to actually explainhis weakness, his failing. He coughed briefly into his hand. “I recently lost mygift of prophecy—which was not a terrible thing, if you ask me. But somethingelse also changed inside of me. I seem to have a little problem.” He swallowed,then covered it with a nervous smile. “Back in D’Hara, I was a great wizard anda prophet, but when prophecy was banished beyond the veil to the underworld,that gift was somehow interconnected with my gift of magic. It has … unraveled,and I am unable to use magic. When I did attempt to cast a spell, theconsequences were…” He fluttered his hands. “Let’s just say, they wereremarkable and unpredictable.”Maxim waved a hand. “None of us has been concerned with prophecy for centuries.Being cut off from the flow of time by the shroud, we are not bothered bypredictions and portents. We have had no prophets since the great war … and wehave not missed them.”The dark-skinned wizard Quentin picked up a raisin-studded roll, inspected it,then spoke to Nathan as he reached for the butter. “That makes no sense. Thegift is intrinsic to a person.” He had a cloud of gray hair like smoke thatclung to his head.“He hasn’t just lost his gift of prophecy.” Thora gave a sidelong frown to herhusband. “He’s lost his gift entirely. How is that possible?”“I don’t know,” Nathan said. “That’s why we’ve come here, following the witchwoman’s clues. Someone in Ildakar must have the answer.” He looked around thebanquet hall. “Someone? Anyone?”“That’s quite worrisome,” said Renn, smacking his lips and dabbing juice fromhis mouth, but a drip fell on his maroon robes. He was a portly man with morethan his share of chins. “We all have the gift, every one of us.” He blinkedwith sudden anxiety. “And if you could lose your abilities, Wizard Nathan, thenperhaps we could, too. What if it’s contagious? Like a fever?”Nicci looked around the table. “I have traveled with him for some time, and mygift remains unaffected.”Andre sat up, his brow furrowing deeply. “This bears further investigation.Wizard Nathan will be an interesting subject.”“We should call him the former Wizard Nathan,” Thora said. “In Ildakar, thosewho possess the gift receive certain privileges. If this wizard is impotent,then we shall have to withhold judgment.”Andre leaned over the table, studying Nathan like an unusual specimen. “I havemany analytical spells, hmmm? We’ll have to run tests, sample your blood.”Elsa explained to Nathan, “Andre is the greatest fleshmancer in Ildakar. Hisprowess is legendary.”Andre took a bite of the juicy meat, speaking as he chewed. “Centuries ago, Ihelped create the yaxen, for example. It is because of my work that they are sodelicious.”Bannon looked up, curious. “What’s a fleshmancer?”Andre stroked the thick braid of beard protruding from his chin. “I am one whocan manipulate and change living things.”Ivan added, “He’s developed many interesting creations over the years. We usethem in the arena.”With a chill, Nathan thought of the horrific combat bear that had attacked themin the hills. Any man who could create such a thing …Thora spoke up. “Wizard Renn’s concerns are legitimate. If a gifted person canlose magic, we need to know why. Is our own magic at risk? We need to solve theproblem.” She nodded to the fleshmancer. “You have our blessing, Andre … and youhave your orders. Study this man.”The fleshmancer’s gray eyes sparkled. “I would have done it anyway.” He quicklylooked at Nicci. “But you still have your powers, Sorceress? Unaffected, as youclaim?”Maxim leaned closer to her and added, “You exude beauty, but I don’t believethat is caused by magic.”“This is who I am,” Nicci said. “And yes, my gift is still strong within me.”“How wonderful,” Maxim said. “The class system in Ildakar is dependent upon aperson’s gift. Those of us from the noble ruling class have the most powerfulgift, as is natural. The merchants and craftsmen have at least some hint of thegift, but few powers. And those unfortunates who possess no known abilitiesserve us as slaves. There’s not much else the poor things can do.”“I … I don’t have any ability with the gift,” Bannon said.“You’re our guest,” Amos interjected, seeming to notice Bannon for the firsttime during the meal. “Don’t worry about it.”Beside him, Brock added, “If you can use that sword, you’ve got a different sortof skill.”Bannon blushed. “I can use it.”Nicci showed little appetite for her food. “We can’t deny that your city isimpressive in many ways. Perhaps Ildakar could become a southern capital of theD’Haran Empire.”Nathan said, “Lord Rahl has been consolidating the war-torn lands, giving thepeople freedom and new hope to live their lives as they choose. With the D’Haranarmy and Lord Rahl’s wise rule, we could help you a great deal.”Maxim twirled his spoon in a crusted pudding and pulled out a mouthful, which hetasted. “We know nothing about your D’Haran Empire.”“Empires rise and fall with a sad monotony,” Thora said. “We’ve had enough ofemperors. We want nothing like that here in our free city of Ildakar.”Nicci gave them a skeptical look. “Free city? You two seem like emperorsyourselves.”“Nothing of the sort,” said Maxim, too quickly.Ivan grumbled, “A little late for that. We might have benefited from an alliancemany centuries ago, but we’ve solved our own problem.”“Chief Handler Ivan speaks the truth,” Maxim added. “We could have welcomed yourLord Rahl’s help when our city was first besieged by General Utros, but we tookcare of him with our own magic.” He looked across the long table at Nicci. “Andyou are supposed to save the world, Sorceress? I applaud such a goal! But we’vealready saved ourselves. Ildakar is fine now.”“Ildakar is our perfect society,” Thora said again.Nicci interjected soberly, “That may be so, but I have never found a perfectsociety that didn’t need saving.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 11 [contents.xhtml#c_ch11]Surrounded by the intimidating members of the ruling council, Bannon felt smalland out of place in the banquet hall.He had seen Nicci do astonishing things with her gift, and he knew Nathan’spotential. Those two had accepted him as a close companion, whether or not hehad magic. He had become an important part of their group, and he certainlypulled his weight. But here in a grand city full of other gifted people, he feltinsecure like when he had been a lonely boy on Chiriya Island. He glanced atAmos, Brock, and Jed sitting near him. Even they had magical skill, as they haddemonstrated while camping out on the plain, but Bannon felt that maybe he wouldfit in better with young men his own age.As the meal continued, he lowered his voice and leaned close to Amos. “Thesovrena and the wizard commander are really your parents?”The three were preoccupied with their own conversation, but Amos lifted his darkeyebrows and turned to their guest. “Yes, and that means I can do whatever Iwant. You like your quarters?”“Yes! They’re the finest quarters I’ve ever stayed in.”Jed picked up a decanter and filled his goblet with dark red wine, then refilledBannon’s, although the young man had sipped only about a third of it. The winewas strong and made him feel light-headed.“It’s good wine too—bloodwine,” Jed said.Bannon hesitated before taking another sip. “Bloodwine? You mean, made fromblood?”The young men chuckled in unison. “Not made from blood! The vines are wateredwith the blood of slaves. It gives the grapes a richness and body unlike anyother vintage.” Amos drank a long gulp, wiped his lips with the back of hishand. “You can definitely taste the difference.”A little nauseated, Bannon took only a small sip.The young men also ate plump olives from a bowl in front of them, and Bannonwondered if those were from the groves fertilized with the bodies of deadslaves. Amos spat out a pit, rolled it between his fingertips, then tossed itonto the floor. “Living under the shroud for so many centuries, we had to makeuse of every possible resource. And slaves were, of course, expendable.”Bannon took a bite of one of the fruit-studded rolls, not wanting to ask whatsort of sacrifices had gone into growing the grains or making the flour. “Youmust have a lot of slaves,” he muttered, thinking of how Ian had been taken byslavers so long ago.“They replenish themselves because they’re allowed to breed,” Amos said. “Underthe shroud, the normal course of time flowed around the city, bypassing thegifted nobles—like my parents, and myself—and so we did not age. Our numbersremain constant, while the slaves grow old and die, or are killed in accidents.”“Or die from diseases,” Brock added.“Some of them run away, every time the shroud goes down,” Jed muttered, earninga glare from Amos. “The mountain towns must have hundreds of escaped slaves.”“Slaves are encouraged to reproduce to maintain their numbers. We’re generousand let them choose whatever mates they like,” Brock picked up the story as hemopped up meat juice on his place with a roll. “And for the past ten years orso, we have another source for slaves, now that trade opened again with theoutside world.”“And you’re sure you don’t have the gift, Bannon?” Amos asked with a frown.The young man didn’t want to admit that he could neither work spells nor releaseany magic. “I’m not a wizard, if that’s what you mean, but doesn’t everyone haveat least some small hint of the gift? At least that’s what wizard Nathan said,since all of the pristinely ungifted departed.”Jed snorted around a mouthful of buttered tubers. “Sounds to me like your Nathanis no longer a wizard himself, so he’s not particularly useful either.”“He is still a wizard,” Bannon said defensively. “He lived a thousand years andstudied a great deal of knowledge. Many enemies have learned not tounderestimate him. Or me.” He touched his side, where he always kept Sturdy.Amused, Amos lifted his goblet of bloodwine. “A toast to our new friend, BannonFarmer, and all the adventures he has had.”The others raised their cups, happy for the excuse to drink deeply, but itseemed that they were laughing at him. Bannon was forced to swallow more of thewine. It left a nice warmth inside his mouth and down his throat, and he triednot to think of the slaves’ blood that had watered the grapes.“I can tell you more about what we’ve done,” he said, “how we saved the greatCliffwall archive and all the knowledge there.” He nodded, saw he had theirattention. Something deep inside him wanted to impress these young men.“Cliffwall? Never heard of it,” Amos said.“One of the greatest archives of magical lore in the world. I helped Nathan andNicci keep it safe.”Brock added, “And what could you do with complex magical lore if you don’t havethe gift?”“I didn’t save Cliffwall for me, but because it needed to be done. And I foughtmy own battles, too. I might not have the gift, but I helped Nicci destroy theLifedrinker, and I also fought against the vicious forest women created byVictoria.” He shuddered to think of the lovely Audrey, Laurel, and Sage. “Theywere so beautiful, but poisonous and deadly.”Amos chuckled. “Keeper’s crotch, sounds like one of the silk yaxen!” He lookedover at Brock. “The one I warned you about.”The young man’s ruddy complexion grew darker as he blushed. “She only scratchedme, but she wanted to do much more.”“She isn’t there any longer. The dacha disposed of her,” said Jed. “Ruth … hername was Ruth.”“Ruthless, more like it,” Amos added with a snort.Brooding, Brock used his knife to cut into his slice of meat.Bannon continued to recount his adventures. “When the selka attacked us on ourship, I killed twenty of them with my sword—terrible, bloodthirsty creatures.They slaughtered every sailor aboard the Wavewalker.”“But you conveniently survived,” Amos said.“I survived. But there was nothing convenient about it.”He was about to launch into a recounting of his battles with the Norukai slaversat Renda Bay, but the other three did not seem interested. He faltered in histelling. “And … well, there were many other adventures and battles. I’ll tellyou about them some other time.”Bannon and his companions had traveled long and hard to reach this importantdestination. He reminded himself he was in a fabulous city now, a place oflegends, dining with the greatest wizards in the entire world. He hadextravagant guest quarters, fine new clothes, and a feast unlike anything he hadever experienced. It wasn’t so bad after all.“I wonder if your cooks know any good recipes for cabbage rolls?” he asked. “Weused to grow cabbage on Chiriya.”“We grow cabbage here,” Jed said. “It’s slave food. And also fed to the yaxen.”Bannon felt belittled. “Then I don’t suppose I need to share the recipes.”Amos laughed at his troubled expression, clapped a congenial hand on hisshoulder. “Don’t worry, Bannon—you’re our new friend. We’ll have lots to dotogether, and we’ll take care of you. Just stick with us. Ildakar has remainedunchanged for countless centuries.”He found that hard to believe. “Nothing new in all that time?”“Once you’ve achieved a perfect society, why should you change?” Amos raised hisgoblet again. “To Ildakar!”The other boys agreed, making the toast a resounding call. “To Ildakar!” Bannondrank more, surprised to discover that he had emptied his wineglass.Jed refilled it again.“Our new friend is much too nervous and reticent,” Amos said. “Bloodwine willloosen him up. Then we can show him the greatest pleasures in Ildakar.”“Would you like that, Bannon Farmer?” Brock asked.He felt intimidated at the prospect of the “greatest pleasures,” not sure whathis friends might mean, but he didn’t dare decline the offer. Nicci and Nathanwould be preoccupied with the duma members for some time, maybe days or weeks,as he tried to get his gift back. Bannon would be left out of all theirimportant work.He smiled at Amos and his two companions and accepted their invitation. “Yes,I’d like that.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 12 [contents.xhtml#c_ch12]The banquet courses continued for two hours, finally tapering into multipledesserts, then tiny glasses of potent liqueurs. Nicci glanced up through theopen ceiling of the grand villa, where night moths flitted around the bloomingvine flowers. The clear sky was awash with stars.After the main course, High Captain Avery took a plate of his own and atestanding beside Thora. Her normally icy expression melted, and she laughed athis whispered comments to her. She shared some morsels from her plate, althoughhe had a full serving of his own.“Our dear captain’s loyalty and bravery are impeccable, and his strength…” Sheheaved a small sigh. “Avery is quite capable, and intensely devoted to the cityof Ildakar.”“And devoted to the beautiful sovrena herself,” Maxim said with lilting sarcasm.He treated his wife’s obvious flirtation with wry cheer that might have covereda hint of annoyance.“He’s certainly more capable than you have been in a long time, husband,” Thoraretorted.“I’m still fully capable, my dear, just no longer interested,” he said, andThora’s face puckered with disdain. Maxim lounged back in his chair. “At leastnot interested in you. Perhaps that’ll change, given another thousand years.”“By then you will be weary of every other woman in Ildakar,” she said.“Oh, I couldn’t be tired of them all,” Maxim said. “And I could never forgetthat you are my wife and my love. Just look at you.” He swept his hand towardthe perfection of her face, the intricate nest of loops and braids of her hair.“How incredibly beautiful you are.” He took a long swallow of bloodwine, loweredhis voice. “On the outside.”Thora reached out to pat Avery’s hand. He stood straight-backed, uncomfortableto be caught in the middle of this discussion. He adjusted the red pauldron onhis shoulder. The other wizards around the table had consumed enough wine thattheir conversation flowed freely and loudly. Even Nathan talked loquaciouslywith a hint of a slur to his words.Taking his goblet loosely in his left hand, Maxim rose from his chair and stoodbeside her seat. The wizard commander had a gleam in his eye—a gleam Niccididn’t like.She was alert and on her guard. She had been used by many men, but had neverpretended to call it love. Throughout her time as Death’s Mistress, she had beenJagang’s plaything, and before that, a pawn tossed about among the soldiers ofthe Imperial Order.Maxim leaned close to her shoulder. “Over centuries of sheltered peace, thegifted nobles of Ildakar had much opportunity to hone our skills and develop thefine arts of sexual pleasure.” He leaned closer, spoke in a husky voice. “Idaresay that most of our techniques have never been seen in the outside world.”“You must be very proud,” Nicci said. “Perhaps you should use those skills tokeep your wife satisfied.”The wizard commander scoffed. “Satisfying Thora is an impossible task—ask any ofher discarded partners. In fact, ask High Captain Avery. I am curious how hemanages to do it.”The sovrena looked icy. “He manages, because he is well endowed with talent …and well endowed in general.”A gasp and a titter went down the table. The banter delighted the other wizards,but Nicci was not amused, although she could not be offended on Maxim’s behalf,because he didn’t seem to care.“You cannot make me jealous, dear wife, for I am as satisfied with ourarrangement as you are.” Maxim bent close enough to Nicci that she could smellthe wine on his breath. “I must inform you of our tradition on special evenings.The gifted nobles often join in pleasure parties, large and small, all of themintimate. You have noticed the immensity of this grand villa. We have numerousrooms with numerous beds … or floor cushions, or swinging hammocks. Thepossibilities may not be endless, but I don’t believe we’ve explored all of themyet, not in fifteen hundred years. I would be most honored if you would join us.Let me show you the true pinnacles of ecstasy. I promise we’ve developedcountless masterful techniques.”Nicci met his gaze with her clear blue eyes. She didn’t back away, or flinch, orgive any sign of warmth. “I think not. I have many techniques of my own, andthey aren’t necessarily pleasurable.”Maxim chuckled at that. “I know what you mean … and there are those who takegreat satisfaction in receiving and giving pain. It is a different form ofenjoyment, although many still consider it sexual ecstasy.”Nicci didn’t budge. The duma members at the table watched her closely. “Youmistake my meaning. I do not intend to participate in your pleasure parties. Atall.”“But we appreciate the offer,” Nathan interjected quickly. “I should tell youthat Nicci has been treated badly in the past, and I’m afraid the experiencerather soured her on what others call pleasure. But if this invitation isimportant to you, and if it’s a tradition, I may have to consider serving in therole. I am the roving D’Haran ambassador.”An awkward mutter ran around the table. Elsa seemed embarrassed for him. Shegave the old wizard’s hand a reassuring pat. “Thank you for your willingness,Nathan, but there’s a problem. You see, our pleasure parties are only for thegifted nobles.” She let her words hang for a moment.Across the table, the fleshmancer Quentin broke in. “As you made clear to us,you have lost your gift. It’s gone within you. We’ll still welcome you here inIldakar, but you won’t be allowed to participate in pleasure parties until yourgift is restored.”Elsa considered, then said, “We have always had a tradition of allowing outsideguests, under special circumstances. This may be an appropriate circumstance, sowe wouldn’t have to leave the poor man out.”“Think about it, Nathan Rahl. What if your condition is contagious?” Thoraasked. “Especially by close, intimate contact.”“I assure you that is not the case,” Nathan said.Gruff Ivan elicited a wave of laughter. “Can he even make his wizard’s staffrise?”Nathan, a man not easily embarrassed, folded his hands in front of him on thebanquet table, adjusting the copper-trimmed sleeves of his green wizard’s robe.“Mock me if you like. I had hoped to receive more sympathy for my tragiccondition, but after this fine and enormous meal, I might be more interested ina good sleep than wild hedonistic celebrations anyway.”Amos and his companions got up from the table, bored with the conversation.“We’ll take Bannon Farmer and show him some fun. Don’t worry about us.”The young swordsman looked out of his depth, but afraid to say no. Nevertheless,Nicci was sure he could take care of himself. “Like Nathan, I believe sleepsounds like a fine idea. We’ll have more business to discuss tomorrow.”She stood, and Nathan rose to join her, collecting his dignity as they departed,walking past the clean, sweet perfume of white flowers from an indoor hedge ofnight-blooming jasmine.As they left the banquet hall, Nathan dipped his hands in the small reflectingpool in the hall, shook off the excess water. “Thank you, Sorceress. A clean,soft bed sounds like enough ecstasy just now.”Nicci made a noncommittal comment. Though their quarters in Cliffwall had beencomfortable, she kept thinking how she had shared her chamber with poor Thistle,how the young orphan girl had loved to curl up on a sheepskin on the stonefloor.“In the morning, Fleshmancer Andre wishes to take me to his research pavilion sowe can study my condition. I’ll be happy to learn some answers.”“I will be glad when your powers are restored and you’re back to your old self,”Nicci said. She bade him good night as she entered her room, pushing aside thepurple fabric hangings that covered the door. She removed her black dress anddonned the comfortable sleep garment the servants had laid out for her. As shelounged on the bed, savoring the cool sheets, listening to the whisper ofbreezes out in the night, she let a trickle of her gift flow out so she couldextinguish the lamps. As she lay in the dim shadows, the room felt very alonewithout Thistle. She also felt alone without Mrra.The spell-bonded sand panther had bounded away when Amos and his companionsarrived. As their group traveled across the plain toward Ildakar, Nicci hadsensed the big cat following them, out of sight … but she hadn’t seen Mrrasince.Now as Nicci drifted, letting her thoughts flow, she did not slide into sleep,but followed the faint bond, reaching out into the night. She knew that Mrraprowled outside the city walls, hunting in the hills. She could detect theuneasiness in her sister panther’s mind. Mrra had been afraid of the three youngmen, and now the cat’s hatred for the great city shouted through her animalinstincts and feline moods.Ildakar was dangerous. Ildakar was a place of pain and bad memories.Nicci had dreamed some of those memories before. She had recognized many of thearcane runes etched in the structures of Ildakar, symbols that matched the marksbranded onto Mrra’s hide.As she drifted closer to sleep, Nicci mused on the dichotomy that the sandpanther was out there alone, roaming the wild, while Nicci herself was in aspacious bedchamber after eating a fine banquet.Yet Nicci feared that she might be the one facing more danger."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 13 [contents.xhtml#c_ch13]Amos and his friends were in high spirits as they left the grand villa, andBannon followed them, glad to have the company after the banquet dispersed. Jedand Brock told off-color jokes, snorting with laughter as they wandered down thesloped cobblestone streets from Ildakar’s upper level, winding into crowdedlower streets of homes owned by wealthy nobles.The young men left the well-manicured wealthy district past orchards ofsweet-smelling citrus blossoms whose perfume made Bannon giddy. He found he hadtrouble walking, thanks to the bloodwine he had consumed, though the very ideaof the wine still unsettled him.“So, what exactly is a silk yaxen?” he asked. “You haven’t told me.” He wantedto sound bright and inquisitive, but his words came out slowly, and he had moretrouble forming them than he expected.Jed and Brock laughed at him, their lips curved in broad grins. Amos said,“You’ll find out soon enough. There are many dachas in the silk yaxen district,and I have my favorite.”“We have a standing account,” Jed said.Amos regarded Bannon coolly. “I’ll even pay for you. This first time will be mytreat for our guest from afar.” He reached into a pocket of his pantaloons,pulled out a small sack, and opened it, taking out five gold coins and handingthem casually to Bannon. “Here, take these just in case.”“Just in case what?”“In case you want special services,” Amos chuckled.“Thank you,” Bannon muttered. “My mother always said to say thank you. Iappreciate it. And I appreciate you showing me the city.” He realized he mightbe babbling, but his companions seemed not to notice.His boots were sturdy and they held his ankles upright, but his steps wereuncertain. The back of his head was packed with warm fuzz.Once, as boys on Chiriya Island, Bannon and his friend Ian had watched a tradingship come into port with goods from Serrimundi. Bannon’s father went down to thedocks while sailors unloaded crates of imported medicines, bolts of cloth, ironcarpentry tools, new farming implements for the cabbage harvest. For their ownpart, the island farmers sold pickled cabbage in sealed clay urns as well as arough ale brewed from kelp that grew not far from the Chiriya coastline.Bannon’s father had met with the first mate of the ship, paid him coins, andwalked away with three bottles of brandy from a distillery in Larrikan Shores.Bannon and Ian had followed him as he went back home and stashed two of thethree bottles in the woodpile behind their house; then he had gone off byhimself to get thoroughly drunk with the remaining bottle.Curious, young Bannon and Ian had moved the stacked wood and retrieved one ofthe brown glass bottles. They hurried with their prize to a sheltered littlecove and sat there, daring each other to drink the rare and expensive brandy. Itburned on the way down, and Bannon coughed. He had to force himself not tovomit. Ian took a larger swig, so Bannon felt he had to outdo him. After thethird swallow, he realized it didn’t taste all that bad, and by the time the twohad finished half the bottle he felt both queasy and euphoric. His skin tingled,his head felt like a bubble, and the world was spinning.As the brandy affected him, some calling of the liquor made him want to drinkmore, to maintain this sense of warm and displaced contentment, or even toincrease the feeling. By the time he and Ian finished the bottle, they were sickand in a stupor. Completely unschooled in the ways of drunkenness, they hadrealized it was nearly dark, but when they tried to get back up from the shore,they blundered and slipped and fell back down.By then, the tide was coming in, the water eating away at their sheltered beach.They were soaked, but too disoriented to climb up the crumbly cliffs. Somehow,after several tries, the two of them did manage to pull their way up. It was amiracle they hadn’t drowned or fallen to their deaths.Bannon had doubled over and vomited up most of what he’d drunk. Ian found ituproariously funny. They went their separate ways, and when Bannon returnedhome, his father was outraged. The boy tried to pretend nothing was different,but he could barely speak, barely walk. His father snarled at him for being alout, a drunk, and a disappointment. He had beaten Bannon, who collapsed intounconsciousness, more from the brandy than from the repeated blows. Bannon wokeup a day later, bruised and in pain, his skull splitting with a roaring headachethat drowned out all thoughts of his swollen eyes and cheeks.The things his father had shouted at him were just a hateful blur of words, andhe eventually realized the man wasn’t so angry because his son had gottenhimself inebriated, but because Bannon had stolen the expensive brandy heintended to drink for himself.Bannon’s mother tended him, dabbing his face with a wet cloth, singing quietlywhile she wept. She had leaned over his bedside, whispering urgently, “Don’tturn out like him. He’s a bad man. It’s not all the liquor’s fault, but theliquor certainly unleashes the demons.”Bannon thought of this now while staggering uncertainly behind the threeIldakaran youths. His stomach was whirling. He hadn’t really wanted the wine inthe first place, but now he didn’t dare vomit in front of Amos, Jed, and Brock.He clamped his teeth together and distracted himself with other thoughts untilthe queasiness died down.…The streets of Ildakar were lit with glowing white spheres on top of iron posts,illumination that pulsed up from arcane symbols. The nobles’ district was welllit, as if hundreds of night wisps had settled along the boulevards, but downhere in the lower levels, the streets twisted and turned into a labyrinth packedwith low candlelit buildings. Dark-leaved oleander hedges blocked the view fromthe street.“So tell us more about this Cliffwall archive,” Amos asked. “Is it a library ofsome sort? A village with a collection of books?”“It can’t be greater than the libraries of Ildakar,” Jed said.“Oh, it is!” Bannon said. “Supposedly the greatest collection in the world,sealed away at the beginning of the wizard wars three thousand years ago.”“I don’t believe it,” Amos said.“Sweet Sea Mother, it’s true! It’s hidden in the winding canyons on the otherside of Kol Adair west of here. It was covered by a camouflage shroud forthousands of years … just like your shroud.”“Then how did you find it?” Brock’s voice had a clear challenge.“The camouflage is down now, and we had a guide.” He thought of Thistle, how thespunky girl had given everything to take them there. “We needed to study thelore to find a way to destroy the Lifedrinker.”The three young men looked pointedly at one another, and Bannon wondered if hehad said too much.With exaggerated good cheer, Amos clapped him on the back. “Bannon, my friend,you have such interesting stories.” He sauntered up a tiled path between thedark hedges to a doorway, where a man sat on a stool, guarding the entrance.“This is our favorite dacha. The silk yaxen here have the finest breeding.”Ahead, the interior of the building was lit with orange glows that providedenough illumination, yet also enough shadows.The man at the door sat on a comfortable wooden seat. He had a well-trimmedbeard and patchy hair. His clothes were of a fine cut, but they werecream-colored and tan, not the vibrant dyes of the gifted nobles. A small brasspot at the side of his stool was filled with coins. The man gave them a brittlesmile, though his eyes were suspicious. “Welcome, Master Amos. Always glad foryour business.” The tone of his voice said otherwise.The young man dropped coins into the beaten-brass pot. “That’s for our newfriend, Bannon Farmer. He may not know what to do with himself.”“I can be taught,” Bannon said, still not sure of himself. “I learned to becomean expert swordsman after Nathan showed me.”“There’s no call for weapons here in the pleasure district.” The doorman lookeddubiously at Sturdy hanging at Bannon’s hip. “You’ll be using a different swordtonight, young man.”“Sturdy stays with me, to defend us if need be,” he said, but the words werebeginning to sink in. Pleasure district? From what he could tell of the mutedorange lighting, the soft laughter, and low conversation inside, he had thoughtit might be a gambling den. But once they stepped inside and he saw the lovelywomen lounging about on divans, he realized what he should have guessed from thebeginning. “Silk yaxen are prostitutes?” Several women attended to noble malecustomers, while others stood beatific against the wall, just waiting. “Thisdacha is just a … whorehouse?”“Keeper’s crotch, not just prostitutes!” Amos said. “Silk yaxen are courtesans,specially bred for this precise use.”Still feeling the warm thrum of the wine inside his head, Bannon couldn’t puttogether an argument or an excuse. He let his three friends lead him inside.Incense burned in small braziers, adding a scent of cloves and honey in astrangely pungent smoke that wafted about the room.Amos turned back to the doorman. “Melody is available for me?”“She is for you, as always. For our new guest, I suggest Kayla. She is beautifuland ready.”“Not that it makes much difference,” Jed muttered. He walked up to where fiveexceptionally beautiful young women stood against a wall near an incensebrazier, where they were bathed in the orange glow. They had vacuousexpressions, simply looking to some imaginary object in the middle of the room.Brock said, “Which one of you is Kayla?”A woman with long wavy locks of dark cinnamon hair looked at him. The smiledidn’t reach the rest of her face. “I am Kayla.”Brock yanked her away from the wall and nudged her toward Bannon. She allowedherself to be propelled in his direction. Brock selected the next woman in line,who had similar-colored hair and pale skin. “I like the looks of you tonight.”He took her arm like a fisherman hauling in a catch.Jed chose a brunette. He didn’t even bother to speak to her, just took her wristand pulled her toward one of the vacant divans.Kayla stood in front of Bannon, making no conversation, not meeting his gaze.She looked like no more than a doll, but a perfectly formed female doll. Sheblinked her eyes slowly. She didn’t smile. He was reminded of a sheep grazingplacidly in a pasture, neither comprehending threat, nor showing any interest.Bannon’s cheeks burned, and he was glad for the uncertain lighting so no oneelse could see his embarrassment. He extended a hand politely to Kayla. “My nameis Bannon. I’m pleased to meet you.”She took his grip. “Thank you. I am pleased to meet you.”He lowered his voice to a husky whisper. “What are we supposed to do now?”“Whatever you want to do,” she said in a normal voice, so the others could hear.He heard a chuckle from one of the divans, where a husky middle-aged noblemanwas pawing a far younger woman, pulling her gossamer garment off and exposingher breasts for all to see. Bannon swallowed hard, and whispered, “Sweet SeaMother!”Kayla was indeed beautiful, and her filmy gown showed her generous figure. Atight sash emphasized her narrow waist and the curves of her hips. A slit up theside showed her creamy calf and thigh.“I … I think we should sit down,” Bannon said, and stumbled backward to a bench.She dutifully followed.“Where’s Melody?” Amos bellowed as he looked around the candlelit room. Heraised his voice enough to disturb other men who sat with their chosen silkyaxen.The fire-orange curtains shifted across an alcove off to the side, and a petiteblond-haired woman stepped out. She had large, round eyes that appeared dark inthe low light of the dacha. She stepped deliberately to Amos, who did not take astep to meet her, expecting her to come to him.“I am here, and I am for you, Master Amos,” she said.“Of course you are.” Smiling lasciviously, he took Melody by the arm and draggedher over to join Bannon and Kayla. “These silk yaxen are beautiful and perfect,some of the finest creations of Ildakar.”“Yes, they’re all beautiful,” Bannon agreed.Kayla sat next to him, so close that her leg pressed against his. She slippedher arm around his waist and leaned against his chest, but it seemed to be morefor balance than for romance.“The fleshmancers created monstrous weapons during the ancient wars, but thesilk yaxen are their finest achievements, if you ask me.” Amos shouted, “Someonebring us more bloodwine! I have a guest here. We must impress him.”“I’m fine,” Bannon said, “Really, I—”Before he could finish his sentence, a less attractive serving girl in drabclothes hurried up with a decanter and poured goblets of red wine, one for Amosand one for Bannon. She offered no wine to the two women.“Silk yaxen are the perfect courtesans, with flawless skin … so warm and silky.”Amos nodded to him. “Go on, reach out and touch it, you’ll see.” He grabbedBannon’s hand and placed it on Kayla’s shoulder. Her skin felt warm andperfectly smooth. She didn’t flinch. “But don’t expect much conversation.They’re just dumb animals, bred for these pleasure dachas where they serve us.As normal yaxen were created as beasts of burden, these women bear a differentsort of burden, and they don’t mind. Do you, Melody?” He looked at her. Shedutifully nodded. “Or you, Kayla?” The cinnamon-haired girl also nodded.Bannon felt unsettled. “You mean they’re like … cattle in female bodies?”“The fleshmancers bred them for a specific purpose. They serve that purpose,”Amos said. “But don’t expect them to go beyond that. In fact, Melody’s name hereimplies that she understands music, or that she can sing.” He let out a coollaugh. “I asked her to sing a romantic tune for me once, just because I wantedto think of myself as her lover.” He snorted. “But it sounded like a cat caughtin a fleshmancer’s cage. Isn’t that right?”“Yes, Master Amos,” Melody agreed.“Show him,” he said, with a taunting tone. “Sing for Bannon here.”Without a moment’s hesitation, Melody began to sing. Her voice was warbling anduncertain, and she missed several notes of a song in a language that Bannondidn’t recognize. Before she could finish the first bar, though, Amos slappedher hard across the face, stunning her into silence. Melody cowered. “I don’tcare what I say, don’t ever sing again,” he said, and slapped her once more,knocking her off the bench.Bannon rose. “Stop; you can’t do that!”Amos blinked in surprise. “Of course I can. They’re silk yaxen. That’s whatthey’re for. Do you think sex is the only kind of pleasure they can give? You’lldiscover it soon enough.” He drank his wine all in one swallow, then hauledMelody, stumbling and cringing, across the wide room, knocking the hangingsaside. He disturbed other couples grappling in the dimness as he took her towardan unoccupied private room in the back.Bannon clenched his fists, swallowing hard. The disorientation from the wineburned away. His father had called his mother a whore, accusing her of thingsthat she had never done, finding excuses to beat her senseless. When Bannon wasyoung, he had never understood what a whore was; only after he’d fled aboard asailing ship and spent time with experienced seamen had he even learned aboutprostitutes.For Bannon, his real experience with love had been with the three youngacolytes, Audrey, Laurel, and Sage, in Cliffwall. Such beautiful and kind womenhad taught him many things, had given him pleasure and taken pleasure forthemselves, sharing him as he shared them. He still felt dizzy now with thosememories, until they cracked and shattered with what those three acolytes hadbecome, turned into monsters by Life’s Mistress.…From the back room where Amos had dragged Melody, Bannon could hear moreslapping sounds as well as whimpering. Jed and Brock had taken their own womeninto private alcoves, while the husky nobleman seemed unembarrassed to tear theclothes from his silk yaxen right on the divan in the main room. Other customerspaused to watch the show.Kayla sat next to him. “Is that what you would like?” Her warm breath wasagainst his cheek, her rich cinnamon hair lustrous in the orange glow. Sheseemed submissive and willing, unconcerned with what he might do to her.His stomach clenched to think of how others had already harmed her. “No … Idon’t think so.” He stood, leaving his wine untouched. He no longer felt theslightest bit tipsy. “I … I think I’ll just find my way back and get a goodnight’s sleep.”Kayla didn’t try to convince him, didn’t react in any way. She just adjustedherself and sat primly on the bench, waiting for someone else to notice her.Bannon’s eyes stung with tears as he hurried out of the dacha. He thought therewould be mocking jeers as he fled, but the others took no notice of him. Thedoorman looked at him as he left, giving a small nod with a surprising hint ofrespect. Bannon wasn’t sure how to take that.The man reached into the pot beside the stool and withdrew several coins. “Here,young man. Your money back.”“But it wasn’t my money. Amos paid for me.”“Then take his coins. You didn’t use what he paid for.” Seeing the insistentlook, Bannon accepted the coins, knowing he could return them later.He wandered into the winding streets, finding his way after numerous falsestarts to a main thoroughfare with side streets branching off to middle-classhomes, merchant shops, tradesmen. He was breathing hard.“Sweet Sea Mother,” he muttered again, unsure about this legendary city. He knewthat Nathan needed to come here, that it was a vital part of getting his giftback, but Bannon hoped they would leave soon. He could see the upper levels ofthe city, and knew that if he just kept climbing the steep streets, he wouldfind the ruling tower and the grand villa and his own rooms. He didn’t want totell anyone what he had done.As he turned a corner, he encountered a dark, brown-robed figure in the shadowsof a side street. A hand darted into a sack and pulled out something bright andsilvery, a flash that caught a stray light from one of the glowing streetlamps.The stranger thrust the jagged object into a crack.Bannon touched the hilt of his sword. “You there, what are you about?”The hooded figure darted away, melting like oil into the deeper shadows.Bannon stepped up to where the figure had been and saw shards of a brokenmirror, small reflective bits shoved into the cracks between bricks. Heremembered what High Captain Avery had said about the rebels, about someonecalled Mirrormask, and he felt queasy again.He hurried back out into the well-lit streets, anxious to get home, though hewasn’t sure anywhere would be safe in Ildakar."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 14 [contents.xhtml#c_ch14]Nicci came instantly awake the next morning when she sensed someone in her room.She opened her eyes to see Wizard Commander Maxim looming over her bed, his lipsquirked in a thin smile.“I came to greet you, Sorceress,” he said, looking down at her wrapped in theslick sheets. “I trust you had a restful and comfortable night … though notnearly as enjoyable as you could have had in a more active bed.”On the cusp of lunging, she felt the gift surge within her, ready to attack, butshe held it back with great effort. He was a formidable wizard in his own right.“You’re lucky I awoke quickly enough to understand where I was. Under othercircumstances, I might have killed you before I recognized you.”The wizard commander raised his eyebrows. “It is always a good idea to recognizesomeone before you kill them. That’s the best way to be sure.” He stroked hisgoatee.She wore a scant, soft shift that had been among the garments left out in herquarters. She sat up, not bothering to cover herself, unwilling to show him anydiscomfort. Nicci had never been ashamed of her body. “What are you doing in myroom?”“It’s actually my room. This is my villa. You are my guest.”“Guests deserve certain consideration.”“I came to wake you. Out of consideration,” he said dismissively. “Thorasuggested that you and Nathan see the central pyramid, which is an importantpart of your understanding of Ildakar.”Nicci recalled the stair-stepped pyramid. “We saw it when we approached theruling tower. Is it a temple of some kind?”“A temple?” Maxim laughed. “With all the great powers we possess, why would weneed to worship at a temple? We acknowledge the Creator and the Keeper beyondthe veil of death, but we don’t need to rely on supernatural interventions. Aswe proved when the army of General Utros came to us, we are impressive powers inour own right.”She remained sitting in her bed with the silken sheets pooled across her lap.“Leave. I will dress and then join you. Has Nathan been informed?”“The sovrena herself went to wake him. I hope she enjoyed her task as much as Ienjoyed mine.” He gave her a lilting smile, then walked out of her room, leavingNicci unsettled.She could easily have summoned fire and scorched him on his way out, but Maximwas the wizard commander. She kept in mind that Nathan needed something from thewizards of Ildakar.After she washed herself and donned her black dress and black boots, Niccibrushed out her golden hair and ate a private breakfast from a platter of fruit,pastries, and cheese that someone had silently delivered to her chamber whileshe slept. The lack of privacy, the vulnerability, made her uneasy. From now on,she decided, she would sleep with both daggers at her side.When she joined Nathan in the main foyer, she saw he had combed out his longwhite hair and donned his copper-trimmed green wizard’s robe again. He seemed tothink it looked good on him. He certainly looked more wizardlike than in hisblack trousers, boots, and ruffled shirt.The wizard commander cheerfully turned to Thora, who stood with them. “I toldyou Nicci would come.” He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. “She seemedquite eager to see the pyramid.”“The sorceress was eager?” Nathan asked. “I’m sure you misinterpreted her mood.”“He did,” Nicci said. “It wasn’t the only thing he misinterpreted.”Nathan changed his tone, sounding like a careful diplomat. “We have much tolearn about each other’s cultures. I understand the pyramid is the heart of yourcity’s power? The projector of the shroud of eternity? I want to get the detailsright.” He seemed to be already considering how to describe the encounter in hislife book, which he carried at his side.“The pyramid is a focal point, a convergence of the lines of magic laid down inintricate spell-forms that permeate the streets and buildings of Ildakar,” Thoraexplained.Departing from the grand villa, they walked along a path covered by an arborthat hummed with bees pollinating pink blossoms. With the shroud down, exposingIldakar to the outside world, the skies were clear and blue. From the top of theplateau, the city all around them seemed pristine, peaceful, untouchable.Ahead rose the imposing structure built of dark gray stone blocks. The blocksformed a square base, then seven successively smaller platforms like giantstairsteps, leading up to an open platform at the apex. Slashed through thecenter of the wide levels was a narrower ramp with smaller steps built for humanfeet.Maxim went forward with a cheerful demeanor, leading them to the steps. “This isthe place from which all of our magic emanates. From here, we will perform themagic to activate the shroud once more.”“Maybe that’s where I’ll need to go in order to have my gift restored,” Nathansaid.“First, we must find out what is wrong with you,” Maxim said. “And I’m sureAndre will relish the challenge.”“The pyramid is reserved for the bloodworking that creates the shroud,” Thorasaid. “The power required for that should remain undiluted.”Nicci didn’t like the sound of “bloodworking.”“It was just a suggestion,” Nathan said quickly. “I’m always happy to considerall alternatives.”Halfway up the second platform, Maxim turned so that he could look down onNathan. “All alternatives? Even the possibility that you might never get yourgift back? What if you must remain a normal and powerless man for the rest ofyour life?”“If that’s the case,” Thora said, “he has no reason to stay here in Ildakar.”“We haven’t decided to stay in Ildakar either way,” Nicci said, climbing thestone steps.Nathan said, “I’ll visit Fleshmancer Andre later this morning. Because I am ascholar myself, he and I can pool our knowledge and understand what we have todo. The witch woman predicted this is the place I must be.”“So very quaint,” Thora mocked. “And your primitive little witch also predictedthat the sorceress would save the world. It seems to me more like she was tryingto stroke Nicci’s ego rather than give you any useful advice. Are you sureyou’ve found the right sorceress from the prediction?”Nicci refused to rise to the bait, though Nathan looked crestfallen.At the pyramid’s top platform, which was cluttered with gleaming, reflectivedevices, Thora and Maxim stood like the king and queen in a strategy game theSisters of the Light had often played in the Palace of the Prophets.The stone floor of the top platform was etched with silver-lined channels,prominent troughs laid out in complex spell-forms with geometrical angles andloops. Nathan was drawn to the intricate polished apparatus standing on display,graduated arcs of reflective metal, empty basins that gleamed like hugecrucibles to collect the sun. Tall metal poles were mounted on each of the fourcorners, like lightning rods stretching up to the sky; each pole was capped witha quartz prism. Two lenses were held within spinning hoops of metal.Nicci stepped into the middle of the patterns and spell-forms. She couldn’t seethe entire pattern, but easily discerned its purpose. “The wizards use thispyramid as a focal point when they cast powerful spells? They can draw the powerneeded to generate your protective shroud?”“Usually,” Maxim said. “But as time has gone by, the bloodworking takes greaterand greater effort.” He sniffed. “We are still assessing.”Thora cut in. “But we have to understand. The shroud has come down too oftenover the past ten years, leaving us unprotected against outside threats.”Nathan shaded his eyes and peered out beyond the periphery of the huge city,turning toward the sheer drop-off to the Killraven River, then in the otherdirection, back to the plain. He gestured toward the waves upon waves of stonesoldiers strewn across the open grasslands. “But you worked your spell long ago.You petrified the army of General Utros, and there is no longer any threat fromthem. Why maintain the shroud if it requires so much energy?”And so much blood? Nicci thought.Thora’s expression darkened. “The shroud was not just to protect the city fromEmperor Kurgan’s bloodthirsty armies. It was to preserve our society, to preventcontamination from the outside. But now it is fading, and I feel great fear forour continued existence.” Her face looked pinched. “Each exposure erodes what wehave created.”The wizard commander was not so convinced. “On the other hand, my dear, openingIldakar to the outside has allowed an infusion of resources and added new lifeto our society. Think of all the fresh blood the slavers have brought for us.”“And how many slaves have escaped out into the wild?” she asked.Chuckling at his wife’s pained expression, Maxim turned to Nicci and Nathan. “Asyou can see, we’ve had this argument many times.”“The outside world has changed greatly in fifteen hundred years,” Nicci said,thinking of Richard and D’Hara. “Lord Rahl put an end to oppression, broughtdown tyrants, defeated the Imperial Order. Slavery should be a thing of thepast.”Thora looked annoyed. “And he has decreed this from a throne so far away that noone has ever heard of it. You’re being naive.”“I am following my beliefs,” Nicci said. “And my beliefs are correct. I haveseen the poison of tyranny, and I will have none of it. Even Ildakar can changefor the better. We will help.”Nathan looked nervous at the tension in her discussion, but Nicci did not backdown.Thora narrowed her sea-green eyes. “You would come here and change theunderpinnings of a society? All by yourself? Ildakar has functioned perfectlywell for thousands of years without your help … and without your interference.”“Perfectly well? That is a matter of some debate,” Maxim said. “Just as you’velost your deep-seated love for me after all this time, my dear, you’ve also lostyour objectivity. Ildakar has changed. The people are beginning to growrestless, and Mirrormask is taking advantage of that. Perhaps a small shift inthe way we do things would reestablish contentment. Is that not better thanwaiting for something to explode?”“I’m not waiting,” Thora said, with a stony sneer. “We will have nothing toworry about once we exterminate Mirrormask and put an end to the trouble he’scaused.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 15 [contents.xhtml#c_ch15]As thin clouds scudded across the early-afternoon sky, Nathan walked up to thefleshmancer’s dwelling, curious, eager, and a little nervous. He counted on thisgifted man’s abilities, hoping to find a simple and straightforward solution tohis lack of magic. Red’s commands had led him here.Andre’s mansion was easy enough to find, not at the top of the plateau wheresome of the other duma members lived, but partway down the layers of theuplifted city, not far from a spectacular outdoor arena and sandstoneoutcroppings. The fleshmancer’s home was a large and impressive structure, threestories high with several connected wings on spacious grounds. The walls werebuilt from quarried white stone. Tall fluted pillars held up the portico andarched walls in an open-air courtyard.As Nathan walked up the pathway, his boots crunched on the crushed stone thatglittered with veins of crystal. The exotic gardens captured his attention likea hunter seizing a bird and refusing to let go. The lush hedges had an eerieundertone of unreality, the interlaced branches folded, then folded back onthemselves as if they had been slowly tortured, broken, then improperly healed.Bright orange flowers looked like hibiscus, though their perfume smelled oddlybitter. The trees in the garden were stunted and malformed, their trunks bentover at improbable angles, then twisted back up, like a goose whose neck hadbeen broken in two places. Even the repressed fruit trees spilled forth ablizzard of pink blossoms.In a special section of the garden, Nathan paused before shoulder-high flowerswith thick stalks and heads as large as his own, like sunflowers with scarletpetals. As he leaned forward for a closer look, Nathan saw that all the seeds inthe center glittered and moved, like insect eyes.Nathan felt a chill, but also a fascination. True, these plants seemeddifferent, but he couldn’t see anything threatening about them, if one didn’tinsist on the original patterns the Creator had used. In a way, he gave Andrecredit for his imagination and originality.Nathan had studied many obscure magical tomes in Cliffwall, searching how hemight recover his gift, but he had found no clues there. As each day went bywithout him being able to do simple things such as lighting a fire or shining alight, Nathan longed to have his gift back. He tried to hide how much hedepended on magic, because he was competent enough without the powers of awizard. By necessity, he had become a much better swordsman, for example.But he felt hollow. Something was missing inside him, and it didn’t reflect whohe was. After the star shift unraveled his gift of prophecy, he had lost so muchmore. And whenever he felt a tiny flicker of his magic coming back, the resultswere grossly distorted amplifications or ricochets of his intent. He didn’t dareattempt to use his magic, nor did he dare to remain helpless. He needed his giftback, badly, and he was betting that someone in Ildakar—Andre, he hoped—wouldhelp him. He was willing to do whatever might be necessary to accomplish that.“I see you admiring my garden, hmmm?” Andre emerged from his villa and stoodunder an entry arch draped with snakelike vines. He casually leaned against oneof the fluted columns.Though startled by his sudden appearance, Nathan showed no reaction other thanto give a grateful smile to the man. “The plants are most unusual. Where did youfind such strange specimens?”“Find them?” Andre laughed. “Why, I created them. Most were just flights offancy, but a few served as practice for other experiments I had in mind.” Thefleshmancer drew down his lips. “I learn a great deal of unique knowledge bytearing living things apart, studying how they work, then reassembling them.”Nathan stepped past the looming red eyeflowers. “I hope you can use some of thatspecial knowledge to help me.”The other man tugged on the knot of his braided beard. “Indeed, former wizard,you pose an interesting challenge. I promise I will study your condition ingreat detail and perform any necessary experiments to discover an answer. Shallwe begin, hmmm?”Nathan followed the man inside a cavernous foyer supported by tall pillars. Hewas glad for the fleshmancer’s assistance, even if Andre seemed to be doing itmore to satisfy his own curiosity than to assist a fellow wizard. Andre led himinto the first wing, which seemed oddly dark even in the bright afternoon.Although the ceilings were mostly open, they had been draped with indigo-dyedcloth, which gave the interior a nighttime feel. Simmering magical pots of lightshone in alcoves and corners.In the large yet somehow claustrophobic room, Nathan saw three long cleantables, each large enough to hold an outstretched man. He heard the sounds ofbubbling fluid and the faint hiss of mist escaping from partially closedcontainers. The air was thick and moist, laced with an undertone of spoiled foodand caustic powders.Shelves along the walls held small colored glass bottles or opaque jars full ofpowders. Aquariums filled with murky liquids held strange shapeless objects.Nearby, he saw a tank with clearer water and a fishlike thing swimming in it,its jagged fins so long they reminded him of the feathers of a tropical bird.Cautious, yet curious, Nathan walked toward a tank that held clotted swirls ofliquid and a shadowy shape that looked something like a severed hand.Standing proudly, Fleshmancer Andre said, “Living forms are like clay. Bone,muscle, flesh, even hair is mutable in a skilled fleshmancer’s hand. I am thesculptor. I am the potter. I look at living creatures as raw material from whichI can make whatever is necessary … or whatever I wish.”Nathan looked around at the three empty tables, the numerous unlabeled bottleson the shelves, the oddly shaped but sharp tools in basins or on platters, andhis imagination filled in details of what Andre actually did here. “This iswhere you conduct your experiments?”“This is where I do my work.” The fleshmancer patted Nathan on the shoulder, lethis fingers linger on the tall wizard’s arm, tracing down the sleeve of thegreen silk robe. “And this is where I will study you. My main living quartersare in the back, but I spend the bulk of my time here in this wing, with myvarious dissection and reassembly chambers, my performance tables, and of coursethe recovery gallery.”With the three tables lined up and waiting for patients, or specimens, thisplace reminded Nathan of an empty battlefield hospital, joined with an abattoir.He pushed back his anxiety, focusing on the goal. “Let’s get on with it—I needto find answers. Thank you for welcoming me into your laboratory.”Andre chuckled. “My laboratory, hmmm? I prefer to think of it as my studio.Fleshmancy is an art, and I have created many masterpieces. I scrutinize mysubjects, my specimens. I treat them as raw material, blank canvases, and Iimagine how they can be improved.”Nathan flinched as the strange fish splashed in the nearby tank, and he clearedhis throat. He wanted this too badly. “I could be greatly improved, if werestore my gift. Then I’d show I am a wizard as powerful as any here inIldakar.”“Oh, that would be a thing to see. I’d better inspect you thoroughly first,hmmm?” Andre faced him. As he absently stroked the braided beard on the point ofhis chin, the expression went out of his gray eyes, as if the fleshmancer hadstopped seeing the wizard in front of him, but instead saw something else. Hetugged on the silken folds of Nathan’s robe. “Disrobe, so I can have a look atyou.”Nathan felt awkward. “You wish me to stand here naked so you can poke and prod?”“Yes. I do.” Just the night before, the nobles of Ildakar had talked about wild,crowded pleasure parties, where no doubt there would have been enough nakedforms on display to last a lifetime. Andre raised his eyebrows. “You said youwanted my help?”Surprised at his own reticence, Nathan drove back his embarrassment. He wastall, handsome, and well built, with nothing to be ashamed of. Andre tugged atthe sash that held the borrowed wizard’s robe closed, and Nathan shrugged out ofit, letting the green garment ripple off his shoulders and slither down to thefloor. He stepped out of the pool of fabric. Though the chamber was hot andstuffy, Nathan felt a tickle of gooseflesh up and down his sides.“My smallclothes as well?” he asked, already knowing the answer.Andre sniffed. “You wanted your magic restored everywhere, didn’t you?”With a sigh, Nathan submitted and stood completely unclothed before thealarmingly eager fleshmancer.Andre walked around him, studying the old wizard’s well-toned form. He madenonverbal noises, some questioning, some approving. Nathan had been preservedfor a thousand years in the Palace of the Prophets, and since leaving there, hehad exercised and maintained his physical appearance. Women had never beendisappointed in him.But Andre showed an unhealthy analytical fascination for his body. Standingbehind Nathan, Andre ran his flat palm across the other man’s back from shoulderblade to shoulder blade, then down the bumps of his vertebrae. Nathan felt thelingering touch, and a heated flush came to his cheeks. He forced himself toremain motionless for the inspection.Andre came around to the front, humming to himself. He reached out with a fingerto touch Nathan’s forehead, then traced the side of his face, running thefingertip up to the top again, forming an oval. “I sense the lines of Han inyou, like scars, but I also see how the tracks have faded … as a scar fades.”“I don’t want my gift to fade,” Nathan said.“That is what we’re trying to fix, hmmm? We may have to find your gift elsewhereand re-graft it onto you, assemble you again from your very core … the way Ihave so successfully put together other specimens for the combat arena.” Hegrinned so widely that Nathan could see all his slightly uneven teeth. “ChiefHandler Ivan says that my creations have made our arena exhibitions morespectacular than any previously seen in Ildakar’s history. I help develop newfighting beasts for precisely that purpose.”“Fighting beasts?” Nathan thought of the horrific monster they had encounteredin the scrub oak grove. “I think we encountered one of them, a creature thatlooked like a bear.”Andre nodded. “Hmmm, several of our combat bears got loose. They are verydifficult to kill, much more terrible than a normal bear.”“We killed it,” Nathan said, “but the task was not easy.”“Ahh, that is sad. I worked hard to create such a thing.” When the fleshmancershrugged, his bony shoulders popped up and down. He bent lower to touch Nathan’schest, then followed some sort of invisible line down his abdomen. “But mycreatures are designed to fight and kill … and die. I suppose that one servedits purpose.”He pressed down on Nathan’s stomach and traced his left hip. Nathan shivered andgrew more tense.Suddenly, shouts echoed from the courtyard beyond the large arched foyer. Gruffmale voices called out, “Fleshmancer! We have materials for you. A practicefight between two of Adessa’s warriors left them both nearly dead. We thoughtyou could save them … or use them.”Distracted, Andre snapped his attention away from Nathan’s naked form. “Dressyourself—I’ve seen all I need. Let us go see what wondrous things have come tous.”The fleshmancer bustled out as Nathan hurriedly donned his green robe andgathered his dignity. Leaving the laboratory room under the dark blue fabrics,they rushed out into the bright sunlight.Waiting at the end of the crushed-stone path stood a wooden cart drawn by asingle glum-looking yaxen. One outflung, bloody human arm flopped over the sideof the cart. Andre peered eagerly down into the bed. Nathan joined him andlooked at the bodies of two well-muscled men wearing only loincloths, their skinlaced with a webwork of old scars as well as fresh, open wounds that oozedblood. Both were mortally injured, barely clinging to life. One of the two menwas shaved bald, but with a round swatch of his skull waxy and pale from along-healed head wound. Blood bubbled up from his neck, where a blade had cutdeep, nearly to the spine.“The sword practically lopped off his head,” said one of the men at the cart. “Ablunted sword! It was supposed to be a practice fight.”The second worker had blue-black whiskers that stuck out from his chin likewires. He flashed a strangely excited grin. “Adessa commands them to fight as iftheir lives depend on it … and sometimes I think the warriors want to die.”“They live only to fight and die,” Andre said dismissively. “Now let’s see whatwe can make of these two.”Nathan stood there, feeling flustered and out of place as he heard the dying mengroan and gurgle. They both bled from chest wounds, deep sword thrusts to theirsides; they had nearly hacked each other to pieces. The bald warrior’s foot hadbeen mangled and his right arm had been lopped off at the elbow.“Carry them inside to the studio. Better hurry.” Andre’s voice was vibrant andanimated now. He smiled at Nathan. “I apologize for the distraction, but thiswill occupy my attention today.” He bustled behind the two cart workers as theymanhandled the dying warriors, lifting the hacked bodies out of the cart anddragging them through Andre’s well-manicured garden into the mansion. He ledthem into the main room under the dark blue fabrics. “Use two of the cleantables, hmmm? Adjacent ones. I want the specimens next to each other.”The men did as they were told, showing no hesitation, no queasiness. After theyhad hauled the victims onto the tables, Andre chased them away. “Thank Adessafor me, and let Chief Handler Ivan know I may have something interesting to turnloose for an upcoming exhibition.”The two blood-spattered workers were all too happy to depart, without waiting tobe paid.Nathan wanted to leave as well, but he felt obligated to remain, though not surehow he could help. He remained in the background, trying not to get in the way,and also reluctant to be splashed with the warriors’ blood. He was close enoughto hear their sickening groans.Andre circled the tables as he gathered tools, decanters, and powders, flasksfilled with bright liquids, packets of dried herbs. Nathan noticed that theperimeter of each table was etched with faint and obscure spell-forms, bindinglabyrinths designed to keep a patient’s lifeblood confined while the fleshmancerdid his work.He looked up at Nathan as if he were a colleague. “These were twowell-recognized fighters from the combat pits, trained for years. Very strong.Good specimens.”“They appear to be dying,” Nathan said. “And I’ve seen more dying men than Icare to remember.”“Yes, they may be dying, but we can still use them.” Andre moved aboutfrenetically. “There’s not much time. This one here is nearly dead.” Heindicated the deep neck wound, the burbling blood. “With the loss of the arm andthe damaged leg, the rest of his body is useless. But his head appears mostlyintact. The other one will heal … but perhaps he could benefit from the Han ofthe first. Two together. They will live to be more than the sum of their parts.”He seemed to be dancing with glee. “I have never done this before. Grafting oneman’s head onto the shoulders of another. Which brain will be dominant, Iwonder? Hmmm?”Nathan was horrified. “Do you really mean to put a second head on the firstman’s shoulders?”“Why not? It’s perfectly possible with fleshmancy. I will have to split and movethe vertebrae in order to create a proper anchor point for the necks.” He spokefaster, like a chef making plans for a large banquet. “I will extrude the nervesand connect them to the brain of the second head. From there, fusing bloodvessels and connecting flesh is a simple matter, like a sculptor manipulatingclay.”“Dear spirits,” Nathan muttered, “I don’t know what to say. Why would you dosuch a thing?”Andre blinked at the seemingly absurd question. “Because I can. Because it wouldbe interesting.”Nathan felt deep doubts as to whether this man could help him with his ownproblem. He wasn’t sure he wanted the fleshmancer to reshape his flesh and hismind, and his own Han.Andre seemed impatient. “Without your gift, you cannot assist me in theoperation, Nathan. In fact, your lack of magic may dampen my own abilities. I’drather you left the studio now. Let me mull over how to restore your gift, butI’ve seen enough to determine a solution. It is obvious what’s wrong with you.”Nathan had begun to retreat, but those words brought him to a stop. “You knowwhat made me lose my magic?”“The gift is intrinsic to you, but you have lost the heart of a wizard. You needto gain it back. Some spark within you changed with the star shift, but it canbe fixed.”“How?” Nathan asked.The two dying warriors groaned and coughed on the table, bleeding out into thespell-confined troughs. The one with the grievous neck wound fell into anominous gurgling silence.“Your heart must be replaced with that of a powerful, gifted man, and then yourHan will be whole. You will once again be the great wizard that you alwayswanted to be.” The fleshmancer bent over the two bleeding forms in front of him,his attention drawn away from Nathan. “But that cannot be done today. Leave meto do my work before time runs out, and these two poor souls become little morethan useless hunks of meat.”Disheartened and sickened, Nathan hurried from Andre’s dwelling."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 16 [contents.xhtml#c_ch16]When Verna, prelate of the Sisters of the Light, arrived in Tanimura, she sawthat the city had changed dramatically, but not nearly as much as the world hadchanged. She could hardly believe it herself, but she fought to remain strong,because the Sisters depended on her.After Lord Rahl defeated Emperor Sulachan and sent the omen machine Regula backto the underworld where it belonged, all prophecy was gone. The stars hadshifted, and magic had changed throughout the world. Richard Rahl consideredthat a good thing.But the Sisters of the Light were suddenly like a ship without a rudder, theirsails torn by the turbulent storm of changed reality. They had devoted countlesscenturies and countless lives to studying and interpreting prophecy, and now allthat effort was obsolete, useless. Returning to Tanimura was just a poignantreminder to her of how much was now different.Verna had come south with a contingent of soldiers, members of the D’Haran armydispatched by Lord Rahl, to help consolidate the empire. She often walkedwherever she needed to go, sometimes on long journeys accompanied by her fellowSisters, sometimes traveling in disguise. This time, the prelate had a fullmilitary escort and a fine horse to ride. Richard Rahl had taught her how toappreciate her mount during their first journey together, when she had taken himfor training in the Palace of the Prophets.Even on horseback, the trip down from the capital of the D’Haran Empire tookmore than ten days, and the soldiers—especially an eager young captain namedNorcross—attended to her needs, which were few enough. Norcross made sure thather tent was erected properly, that her bedroll was soft and dry, that shereceived the first servings from the camp cook tent.Several days into the journey, Verna learned that the captain’s solicitousbehavior was in part because his young sister, Amber, was a novice among theSisters of the Light, joined only recently. Although Verna was prelate of theorder, she knew little about the girl. There had been so much turmoil in recentyears.…Now, with her riding her black mare beside Captain Norcross, they topped a ridgeand started down the well-traveled road to the outskirts of Tanimura. She couldsee the sweep of the city stretching out along the coastline, the green-bluecrescent of the harbor, the numerous ships flitting about on the sea.This wasn’t the first time she had returned to Tanimura. In fact, she had spenttwenty years away from the Palace of the Prophets—and away from the antiagingspells woven into the structure of that place—in her original search forRichard. She had finally found him and then convinced him—coerced him—to come tothe palace, where the Sisters trained him to use his gift.That had set so many titanic events in motion … exactly to fulfill the prophecy.But now prophecy was no more.“A lovely view, Prelate,” said Norcross. “Since I grew up outside of Aydindril,I’ve never seen the ocean before. How does a ship sail off into that wateryemptiness and not get lost?”“Their captains have magic of their own,” Verna said, “although some simply callit navigation. You’re not due to sail away from here, though, are you, Captain?”“No, we’re here to establish the garrison. General Zimmer has alreadycommandeered some large buildings on the waterfront, and he’s reinforcing themto hold five hundred, even a thousand soldiers who will eventually be stationedhere. But that’s just the beginning.” The sandy-haired captain smiled at her,and she noticed that his left front tooth was a little crooked, giving him aroguish look. “Now that the Imperial Order is defeated, we’ll be setting upgarrisons down the coastline and throughout the Old World.”Verna pressed her lips together. “That is the best way to insure that no greattyrants rise to power again.”Sparse pine trees lined the side of the road, but many of the hills had beencleared for firewood and construction material. The air was warm as they rodeonward. She wanted to take a break in the shade to eat a brief midday meal, butshe longed to be back in Tanimura, her home.…As they rode down the rutted road, she heard the punctuated rumble of otherhorse hooves as the hundred D’Haran soldiers rode along in the column. On theoutskirts of town they came upon paddocks that held sheep and goats, largehousehold gardens, orchards of old apple and pear trees. Farther in, thedwellings became more crowded, some of them poor and ramshackle, while otherswere well maintained by families who felt that even a shack deserved to be keptclean and well repaired because it was their home. People emerged to watch asthe soldiers rode in under the banners of D’Hara. Captain Norcross raised agauntleted hand, waving at them.Verna sat straight-backed on her black mare, looking at all of the smilingpeople and feeling out of place. Her brown eyes were still bright, though theyshowed the beginnings of weariness from her age, and her wavy dark hair wasstill mostly brown, except for the increasing gray strands she discovered whenshe studied herself in a mirror. The years were weighing upon her, not just fromtime, but from the heavy responsibility as well.She knew at least ten other Sisters had come to Tanimura ahead of her, hoping toreturn to the Palace of the Prophets. Prelate Verna felt the same pull on herheartstrings, but when she gazed around the shoreline to the flat brown expanseof Halsband Island, her heart ached in a different way.Across a bridge from the Kern River, the island had once been home to the trulytitanic palace, an ancient structure large enough to rival the Wizard’s Keep orthe Confessors’ Palace in Aydindril. But now it was gone, leveled, when Richardbrought down the entire structure by triggering the embedded spell webs. Thatdisaster had destroyed the antiaging spells, the protective webs, the countlesschambers and tunnels, the towers, the libraries, the vaults beneath. The Palaceof the Prophets had simply disintegrated. Richard had done it to keep theincredible knowledge stored there from falling into the hands of Jagang, theevil dreamwalker who could have used that lore to crush the world.And in the chaos of the palace’s destruction, the prophet Nathan had somehowmanaged to escape, to break free of the iron collar around his neck, theRada’Han, and to fake his own death. He had slipped away with Verna’spredecessor, Prelate Ann. Verna wished she could give that responsibility backto the older woman; she had never wanted it.“The island looks so empty,” she said. “Has anyone searched the ruins of thepalace?”“You’ll have to ask General Zimmer,” Norcross said. “I haven’t been here before,but from what I’ve heard tell, there are no ruins to search.” His smile turnedinto a frown. “There’s just … nothing.”As they passed through the streets of Tanimura, the horses’ hooves clattered onthe cobblestones. They rode through squares where children clambered up thesides of buildings to hang pennants of D’Hara. From the shelter of alleys, smalldogs barked at the long line of soldiers, but the D’Haran horses were as welltrained as the men, and they did not spook.Norcross continued to wave, calling out to the people, “We bring greetings andgood wishes from Lord Rahl.”The crowds in the streets waved and shouted, “Lord Rahl, Lord Rahl!”Verna knew that here, far to the south, these people had faced the oppression ofthe Imperial Order, and they had good reason to celebrate Richard’s victory, butthey had escaped the recent war of the soulless half people raised by Hannis Arcand Emperor Sulachan.When the contingent finally reached the waterfront, Verna smelled the salt airand smiled as she looked out at the busy harbor, where creaking two- andthree-masted ships filled the piers. Fishmongers, shell sellers, and merchantswaving exotic items vied for the attentions of passersby. Painted women in filmyclothes leaned out of brothel windows, flirting with the soldiers, confidentthat their business would pick up soon.Verna spotted the newly constructed garrison headquarters that had replacedseveral dockside warehouses, fronted by a stockade built from fresh-scrubbedtimber. Captain Norcross informed her that the soldiers had spacious newbarracks inside the garrison, but many of the inns and large warehouses had alsobeen pressed into service to accommodate the increased military presence. As thelong column of horses rode along the waterfront road, watchmen at the garrisonwalls blew horns to call the stationed soldiers to order. The new stockade gatesopened, and armored men came out to greet them.The horses cantered into the garrison yard while soldiers hurried out to flankthem and greet them. Captain Norcross slid off his dappled gray horse and tookthe halter of Verna’s black mare. “I’ll help you down, Prelate. General Zimmerwill want to see you right away.”“You overstate my influence. I am just your guest,” she said. “He should be farmore concerned with accepting your reinforcements for the garrison.”Norcross laughed. “Dear spirits, Prelate, sometimes you say amazing things!Don’t you realize how important you are?”Verna held her tongue, thinking about how the foundation of her entire order hadturned to quicksand with the end of prophecy, how the Palace of the Prophets wasnothing but a memory and a few broken scraps of rubble. “I am no longer soimportant as you might think.”Another pang struck her heart as she thought of Warren, once her student, thenher beloved husband, whose tragic death had left her devastated. Some days shethought that her identity as a widow was far more consuming than her identity asthe prelate of the Sisters of the Light.When Richard had descended into the underworld, trapped on the twilight verge ofdeath, he had spoken with the spirit of Warren and brought back a message forher that Verna cherished more than any prophecy or proclamation. But it was hermessage, and she kept it wrapped in pretty bows of memories and stored close toher heart. Now she was alone, but not alone, because she had work to do. She hadcome back to Tanimura, and that carried certain responsibilities.Among the soldiers milling about to receive the new arrivals, she saw colorfuldresses, red and green and blue, worn by the Sisters of the Light—hercompanions, ten of whom had arrived ahead of her. One novice Sister looked likejust a fresh-faced girl, far too young to have any responsibilities or heavyteachings from the Sisters.“Amber!” Norcross called out as he hurried forward, laughing.His sister’s dark blond hair hung in ringlets around her face, and long tressesfell below her shoulders. She had sparkling deep blue eyes that laughed alongwith her voice. “You took your sweet time riding here, Brother. I almost leftyou to find some other man to cherish me.”“There are plenty of men who would be happy to marry you, Amber,” he said. “Butyou’re too young yet.”“I am a Sister of the Light, and proud of it,” the girl said, then suddenlyrealized that Verna was watching her. She blanched and stammered, “Prelate, I’mvery sorry. I did not mean to be so casual and friendly in your presence.”Verna gave her a maternal look. “Child, the Sisters are not so grim and studiousthat we don’t allow happiness. Enjoy the reunion with your brother.” She loweredher voice, talking as much for her own benefit as for the young novice’s. “Dearspirits, we have enough pain. We should cherish whatever joy we can find.”A deep male voice boomed out, “Prelate Verna! I’m glad you kept my soldiers safeon the trip down here.”Verna turned to see General Zimmer, a young man she had first met as amuch-lower-ranking officer, now only about thirty, but because so many militaryleaders were slaughtered in the recent war, Zimmer had unexpectedly risen inrank far above his expectations. But his heart and his mind were strong, and heaccepted the increasing burdens each time one of his superior officers waskilled, leaving him in charge. He had dark hair and a thick neck, but when hesmiled, Zimmer looked much younger than expected.Striding forward, he extended his arm for her to take and escorted her towardthe command office in the two-story headquarters building inside the stockadewall. The structure was built from freshly hewn pine boards, sanded and fittedtogether, still redolent with a sweet forest scent that reminded her of spring.Workers on the roof were hammering wooden slat shingles into place. Inside thefence near the training ground, rows of canvas sleeping tents had been erectedwhile larger permanent barracks were built. The sounds of sawing and hammeringwere as loud as the sounds of soldiers drilling.Zimmer led her into his office on the upper level, where he kept the broadwindows open to the sea breezes. The raw floorboards creaked as they walkedacross them, and Verna took the offered wooden chair in front of the general’sdesk. “I called for tea as soon as I saw you ride up, Prelate,” Zimmer said. “Torefresh yourself and to inspire conversation.” He scratched his cheek, where adark stubble was already prominent even though it was barely midafternoon. Heshouted for his adjutant, who hurried into the room with a steaming pot, twoporcelain cups, and a small jar of honey. “After the long road, I thought you’dlike the amenities.”“I don’t need to be pampered, General,” she said, although she was glad for thetea.“And who’s to say that I don’t?” He poured a cup for her and then for himself,and he did not skimp on the honey. “Sometimes hints of civilization remind uswhat we are fighting for.”She took a sip with a smile. “To tea and honey, then—for D’Hara!”“For D’Hara.” Though he had been recruited as a very young soldier, Zimmeralready spoke with a solid military demeanor. He got down to business. “Youbring reports from the People’s Palace? The men have been asking if Lord Rahlintends to visit us in Tanimura.”“I know nothing of Lord Rahl’s plans. He has an empire to run and many urgentmatters, I’m sure.”The general mused, “He told me once that the D’Haran Empire effectivelyencompasses the entire world, but how are we to know how vast that is? How is heto know? Though my own journey to Tanimura was uneventful, and this garrison issecure, I’ve seen maps of the coastal cities and even sketchier reports of theOld World beyond, many cities, the Phantom Coast, and many islands beyond. Asthe world goes, we may have seen only one grain of sand on a very long beach.”Verna nodded. “That could well be true, General. There will be explorers, therewill be ambassadors. We can see this world and make sure that Lord Rahl’s goldenage touches them all.”Zimmer smiled as if he had hoped she would make such a comment. “In light ofthat, Prelate, I have received a report you may find interesting. Nathan Rahl,the wizard and prophet, came through Tanimura some months ago.”Nathan? Verna was surprised. “He is no longer a prophet. There is no moreprophecy.”Zimmer did not seem bothered by her correction. “Even so, a man likes to keephis titles. He was with Nicci. From Tanimura, they both booked passage aboard athree-masted carrack, the Wavewalker.”Verna was always surprised to hear about the former Sister of the Dark and howgreatly she had changed. Nicci had been with Verna in the Palace of the Prophetsfor many years, but she had secretly served the Keeper. She had done much todestroy the order as well as Richard Rahl, but she had changed, and Nicci—whoonce called herself Death’s Mistress—was now one of Richard’s staunchest allies.Verna’s lips curved in a distant smile. “I knew Lord Rahl had dispatched themtogether, but I am surprised Nicci stayed with Nathan. I would not have thoughtthey’d be good traveling companions.”“Soldiers do their duty,” Zimmer said. “Although Nathan and Nicci are notsoldiers, they both have the same goal—to see that Lord Rahl’s cause succeeds.”“How long have they been gone? Where did they go?” Verna asked.“They sailed south, and there has been no word from the Wavewalker since.Apparently, they went to explore those empty places in our knowledge, to meetlocal leaders and tell them about Lord Rahl, perhaps to establish treaties oragreements. They have much work to do.”He poured a second cup of tea for each of them. She added a dab of honey,stirred it, then drank. The tea was surprisingly good for something concocted ina rough-hewn military garrison.Zimmer’s face darkened. “Even though Jagang has been defeated and the ImperialOrder disbanded, there is still so much unexplored and ungoverned land. The OldWorld seems to be a fertile ground for tyrants.”Verna wrapped her fingers around the cup, feeling its warmth, enjoying the senseof peace as she sat across from this brave military man, smelling the freshpinewood and seeing the bright sunshine out the window.She said, “If there are a dozen new tyrants out there, I’d still bet my money onNicci.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 17 [contents.xhtml#c_ch17]The next day, Nicci returned to the ruling tower, where the wizards’ duma washolding session. Sovrena Thora and Wizard Commander Maxim took their ornateseats on the raised platform above the floor of blue marble tiles. Thora wore ashimmering orange and scarlet dress that clung to her shapely body andhighlighted her startling sea-green eyes. Her long hair had been done up in adifferent, intricate pattern of loops and braids, held in place by jeweledclasps. She seemed to radiate power, amplified by her own confidence.Because there was no pressing business, only a few duma members bothered toattend the meeting—Elsa, Renn, and Quentin. Entering late, the muscular Ivancame from the arena pits. The chief handler was swarthy, sweating, and in a foulmood. He stalked in, grumbling, but the other members paid him no mind;apparently, Ivan often attended in such a state.“Had to kill two more unruly animals today, a sand panther and a speckled boar.With my gift, I can usually knuckle them under, force them to submit even if Ihave to break a few bones or burst some blood vessels. But these two beasts keptturning on me. I needed one of my apprentices, Dorbo, to club them intosubmission.” He twisted his thick lips as if he wanted to spit. “A waste of timeand energy, all of them.” He looked around the room as he approached his seat atthe marble table. “Where’s Andre? He creates the things.”“Perhaps he’s just giving you a challenge, Chief Handler,” said Maxim, loungingback in his chair, amused.“I have enough damned challenges already.” He slumped heavily in his seat.Nicci had been invited to watch, but not interfere. From where she stood in theobservers’ alcove near the tall windows overlooking the city, Nicci maintainedher silence. She narrowed her intense blue eyes and watched closely, absorbingthe interaction among the duma members. As far as she could tell, the rulingcouncil of Ildakar lacked any compassion for the rest of the city. She couldn’timagine how they had kept Ildakar functioning when it was bottled up under aprotective shroud for fifteen centuries. If the mirrors mounted defiantly onalley walls were any indication, she suspected a low undercurrent of unrestbeneath this supposed utopia.Though Nicci felt skepticism and distaste roiling inside, she reminded herselfthat she and her companions were only guests here, and she still had herunderlying mission to spread the word of the D’Haran Empire. She would be quietfor now, but she was strong. These people paid little attention to her, but theydidn’t know who she really was yet.Nathan had also joined her for the council session, but he remaineduncharacteristically quiet. He had looked unsettled since meeting withFleshmancer Andre the previous day. For the loquacious former prophet towithhold conversation, Nicci could sense that something was wrong. Though shewouldn’t overtly offer, she would be ready to assist him if she saw theopportunity. Nathan was convinced he needed the help of these wizards, but maybehe was seeing the cracks under this society as well.Bannon arrived. Instead of the loose finery from the banquet, he wore hisdurable canvas pants, which had been cleaned and mended, as well as his scuffedtraveling boots, but he did don a slick brown Ildakaran shirt. The sleeves werewide and billowing, but tapered to a cuff at his wrists. As always, he keptSturdy strapped to his side, and Nathan carried his more ornate sword. No oneseemed the least bit uncomfortable that guests would bring deadly blades intheir presence, and that told Nicci how confident the council members were intheir own magic.When the young redhead entered in the ruling hall, the wizards looked askance athim. Thora frowned, making it plain that she didn’t wish the ungifted young manto be there. “Have you no activities with our son and his friends?”Bannon—intentionally, Nicci was sure—missed her mood and shrugged. “I enjoy thecompany of Amos and the others, but I also like to spend time with my friendsNicci and Nathan. We’ve traveled a long way together to find your city.”“And you’re welcome to sit with us, my boy.” Nathan indicated the bench besidehim; then he emerged from the observation alcove and cleared his throat, as ifThora’s comment had invited open discussion from the floor. “Fleshmancer Andreis hard at work on some massive new project, which consumes his attentions. I’msure he sends his apologies that he can’t attend the duma meeting today.”“He rarely attends duma meetings,” Maxim said with a lilt of sarcasm. “We’ll beforced to muddle along without the delight of his company.”“Such a pity.” Sovrena Thora matched her husband’s sarcasm.“He’s creating something special for the arena,” Ivan said, brushing at a stainon his panther-pelt jerkin. His wide mouth broke into a grin. “I’ll let him takethe time he needs, but he said it would be done soon.”When Nicci shot her companion a questioning glance, Nathan looked away. Heraised his voice and kept speaking to the duma. “Before he became preoccupied,though, Andre identified the root cause of my problem. Apparently, through thefundamental changes after the star shift, I somehow lost … the heart of awizard. The fleshmancer is working on a way to rectify that condition. He hassome ideas, but no clear answers as of yet.”“At least that means your weakness is not contagious,” Renn said with a sigh.“When will he be able to cure you?”“He’s finishing my project first,” Ivan said, rubbing at a red welt on hisexposed biceps, as if trying to remember how he had gotten injured.With some embarrassment, Nathan agreed. “Considering his obvious interest in thechallenge, I believe his attention is focused entirely on that.”“I hope he doesn’t take too long,” said the wizard commander. “How it must painyou to be utterly impotent, Nathan … unable to use even the most trivial magic.”Nathan flushed. “I wouldn’t exactly use the word ‘impotent.’”“Until you can demonstrate the use of magic, your position among us remains inlimbo,” Thora said with a sour expression. “For the moment, we extend ourcourtesy to you as a guest, but if you mean to stay here in Ildakar forever,that will have to change.”A fire of surprise pulsed through Nicci’s veins. This was the second time theyhad mentioned the possibility. “We have no intention of remaining here forever.”“You may not have a choice if you are inside the walls when the shroud goes backup permanently,” Thora said.“Then we can’t let you restore the shroud yet.” Nicci’s voice was hard, and thesovrena looked startled at the defiance. She continued, “We still have work todo here.”Richard had explicitly charged her with seeking out tyranny and oppression. Shemight have to reshape the city’s entire ruling structure, if she took thatmission entirely to heart here. Was Ildakar worth the effort? Though the sovrenaand the wizard commander did not seek to conquer the world, like Jagang, theystill posed a threat to freedom. “I don’t think you’d want to leave me trappedhere.”Before Thora could argue, loud footsteps and harsh shouts drifted up from theentry at the base of the tower below. Footsteps came up the waterfall of stairsin a brisk percussive beat, landing after landing, until a group reached theexpansive ruling chamber.Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon turned to see three ominous women leading a scruffyyoung man in the rough-spun tunic and trousers of a slave. He was barefoot andsmudged with dirt, possibly excrement. His unruly mop of hair looked as if ithad been cut with a sharpened spoon. His brown eyes darted in defiance from sideto side. Fresh bruises were apparent through the dirt smeared on his cheeks.Nicci was surprised to recognize the young yaxen herder who had caused HighCaptain Avery such consternation on the day of their arrival.But her main focus was drawn like a lodestone to the three whip-thin women whoescorted the prisoner. The compact female warriors were composed entirely ofmuscle, as if some fleshmancer had created them out of coiled wires and metalrods, then covered the framework with feminine flesh. Each of the three wore ascant black leather wrap around her waist and another leather band cinchedacross her breasts, leaving legs, arms, and midriff bare. They wore metal-shodsandals with black leather wrappings bound high up their calves.Their exposed skin was an overworked canvas, marked not with tattoos, but actualbrands, arcane Ildakaran symbols that turned their bodies into walking spellbooks—just like those Nicci had seen on Mrra’s hide, or the horrific combat bearthey had killed. Despite their marred skin, these thinly clad warrior women werehauntingly beautiful. They exuded power and dangerous sexuality. Their hair wascropped short, perhaps as a defense against some enemy grabbing a fistful oflocks.Thora leaned forward in her tall chair. “What have you brought us, Adessa? Helooks like a dirty slave, not one of your warriors in training.”“Too scrawny for a warrior,” Chief Handler Ivan muttered, “though he mightprovide some food for my hungry beasts.”The oldest and best-muscled of the three women came forward. Her short blackhair was peppered with highlights of silver, and her dark eyes were bright as araven’s. She might have been beautiful, under other circumstances. Adessadelivered her report with military precision. “He is not one of my fighters, nora trainee from the cells. Just a dirty yaxen herder, but my morazeth caught him.He supports the rebels.”The other two black-clad women each took an arm of the struggling captive boyand pushed him across the polished blue marble tiles toward the dais. His handswere tied in front of him at the wrists.Nathan stroked his thumb and forefinger down his chin as he turned to Nicci.“‘Morazeth’? The word sounds similar to ‘Mord-Sith.’ They are obviously powerfuland dangerous women, and they even have a penchant for wearing leather, thoughthere would not seem to be enough of it to serve as body armor.”Nicci studied the women. “It may have come from the same root word in ancienttimes.” These morazeth warrior trainers did indeed remind her of the Mord-Sith,women impervious to magic, who wore leather and swore their lives to protect theLord Rahl. “I do not know the origins of the Mord-Sith back in D’Hara. These mayhave been an offshoot thousands of years ago, separated back in the days of thegreat war. Ildakar has been sealed away for many centuries. These women couldhave developed independently, followed their own path. Some things may besimilar to the Mord-Sith, but I expect much will be greatly different.”Bannon couldn’t stop staring at them.From his seat at the marble table, Ivan called out, “If he is an unruly slave,why don’t we put him in the fighting pits? Get rid of him.”“A slave that can’t be controlled is a slave that is of no use to Ildakar,”Thora agreed.“I’m not unruly,” the defiant young man shouted. “I fight for freedom!”Adessa looked sidelong at the chief handler, but focused her attention on thesovrena. “We caught him down by the animal cages near the arena pens. Heobviously meant to release some of the beasts to create havoc among the goodpeople of the city—as the rebels have done before.”“The animals should be trained to taste the blood of nobles!” The slavestruggled unsuccessfully to break free of the hands gripping his arms.“Alas, the beasts will have to be satisfied with bitter-tasting slave meat,”Thora said. “Fangs and claws will set you free.”“I am already free,” the yaxen herder insisted. “Mirrormask made me free, and hewill make us all free.”There was grumbling among the duma members. Elsa looked deeply concerned. Renn,Damon, and Quentin muttered to one another.“Why do they call him Mirrormask?” Nathan asked. “It’s a curious name.”“Because he wears a mask made of a mirror,” Quentin responded. “Obviously.”“That doesn’t answer the question why,” Nicci said.Maxim explained, “It is said his face was horribly disfigured by a fleshmancer.His visage is so appallingly hideous that people prefer to look at thereflection of their own faces, rather than his.”“Perhaps he wishes to reflect the ugliness around him,” Nicci suggested, whichearned her an annoyed glare from Thora.Maxim chuckled. “Or maybe he just likes to have people tell stories about him.That way he will seem more mysterious and powerful than he really is.” Hecrossed his legs, one slick black pantaloon over the other. “Whatever thereason, I wouldn’t take his trivial movement seriously. That would giveMirrormask too much respect.”“Have you heard his grievances?” Nathan asked. “Rebels need to rebel againstsomething.”“Discontent feeds itself. Better just to starve it,” Thora said.Nicci stepped forward, focused on the captive. “I would like to speak with thisboy. A mere yaxen herder? Not much of a hero or a martyr. It would be best tounderstand why such a person would show such defiance, knowing it would surelyresult in his death.”“That’s not necessary at all, my dear sorceress,” Maxim said. He rose from hischair and spread both hands out at his sides. “We have handled such nonsensebefore, and I can take care of this quickly.”Nicci looked at the defiant, but also terrified, captive slave. “And yet ithappened again.”“You will not interfere,” Thora said in a cold voice.“Don’t you want to see what you can learn from him?” Nicci couldn’t believe theywould waste such an opportunity.“Not necessary. Not interested.” Maxim curled his fingers as he concentrated,and power circled around him, drawn out of the air like a latent thunderstorm.The wizard commander’s short hair lifted slightly, drifting about in a corona ofgrowing energy. “Those who would disrupt the perfect order of Ildakar must bedealt with appropriately. I am not only the wizard commander; I am also thecity’s master sculptor.”Adessa and the other two morazeth stepped away from the prisoner, giving Maximspace to work. The young yaxen herder struggled with the bindings on his wrists.He straightened his knees, sneered at the duma members, then at Thora, andfinally at Maxim himself. He curled his lips, preparing to spit.Just then the wizard commander released his gift.Shimmers curled through the air like invisible reflections. Twists of windtightened into even more secure bindings. The slave’s filth-stained shirt turnedwhite, as if covered with gypsum powder. His skin hardened, turned gray. Hiswild and unruly hair crystallized. With a crackling, breathy sound, the slavepetrified in his defiant position, and a new statue stood on the floor in thechamber.The petrification spell seemed fundamentally the same as what the insaneAdjudicator had used against the people of Lockridge, against Nicci. TheAdjudicator, though, had been corrupted by the magic. Maxim wielded thetime-stopping magic with ease and clear intent.Ivan stood up from his stone bench, clenching his fists at his sides. “That wasa wasted effort, Maxim. We should have taken the boy to the combat pits, wherehe would have made fine sport. Now what are we supposed to do with him?”Thora frowned at her husband, then nodded slowly. “Killing him in the arenawould have turned the boy into a martyr and incited more foolishness fromMirrormask and his rabble. Better that we took care of it like this.”“And I so rarely get to practice my gift,” Maxim said. He looked at Nicci, andthe tone of his voice held a clear undertone of braggadocio. She assumed he wastrying to impress her, maybe to get her to change her mind the next time heinvited her to one of the Ildakaran pleasure parties. “I am the master of thepetrification magic. I created and controlled the spell that petrified GeneralUtros’s entire army, all those centuries ago.”“Yes, you were the key,” Thora said. “But the rest of us helped turn the lock.You aren’t the only one who can use the magic. I myself took care of Lani, whenshe expressed her insufferable defiance.” She looked over at the stone sorceressstanding at the side of the ruling chamber.“Of course you did, my dear. I would never wish to belittle your abilities.”Maxim folded his arms together. He looked satisfied and content after turningthe rebellious slave to stone. “I suggest we place this new statue in aprominent location … down in the slave market, perhaps, where it will serve as afine decoration—and a clear warning.”After workers had removed the statue of the young yaxen herder, Thora sat back,regarding the others in the ruling chamber. “Chief Handler Ivan is right. It’sbeen too long since we watched a spectacle in the combat arena. Let us arrangeone at the earliest opportunity. Ivan, when can you be ready?”Fleshmancer Andre entered the tower, hours late for the meeting. His loose whiterobe carried hints of stains from past work in his “studio.” He wiped sweat offhis brow and spread his arms wide. “It appears I arrived just in time, hmmm? Myexperiment is finished—the fleshmancy was a complete success. Our new warriorcould make his debut in the combat arena as soon as tomorrow.”Wizard Commander Maxim looked delighted. “Tomorrow it is then! We shall schedulean exhibition.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 18 [contents.xhtml#c_ch18]Smiling magnanimously, Maxim offered Nicci a seat in the nobles’ spectator towerabove the city’s grand arena. Now that Andre had tentatively suggestedpossibilities as to how Nathan might regain his gift, the other duma membersallowed him to join them in the special seats as well, high above the unwashedand unruly crowd.Amos and his companions had asked Bannon to join them in the secondary tier,close to the combat field, but he preferred to sit with his friends Nicci andNathan. The wizards were somewhat displeased to have an ungifted young man withthem, but they deferred, although with obvious reluctance.When the sun stood at its zenith above Ildakar, crowds gathered in the rings ofseats around the combat arena, a broad and deep crater excavated in thesandstone uplift. The fighting field of sand and gravel was surrounded by asheer wall. The spectator seats for the lower classes ringed the rim, while thegifted nobles observed from tower perches that rose high above the sands. Theraised towers gave them an unobstructed vantage as well as improved safety.Nicci guessed that some of the animals in the arena were so dangerous they mightescape and rampage into the spectator stands. From visions conveyed via herspell bond, she remembered times Mrra had fought here.From his seat close beside her, Maxim remarked on the black dress she wore,despite the variety of clothes that had been offered to her. “Are the styles ofIldakar not to your liking? We have many different dresses, from long gowns torather abbreviated silken shifts. If you chose to wear such a garment, everyonehere would appreciate it, I’m sure.”She gave him a stony glance. “I choose to wear black for personal reasons.”“So that is the answer,” Maxim chuckled. “I shall assign our city’s best tailorsto provide you with hundreds of alternatives fashioned out of black cloth. Iwould be honored to help you try them on and choose one that best suits you.”“This one suits me just fine.”“It fits you quite well, too,” he admitted, “although it still leaves too muchto the imagination.”“Then I hope you have a good imagination.”A buzz of anticipation spread among the lower seats, growing louder as the timefor the exhibition approached. In an imperious tone, Sovrena Thora called forservers. “It is midday. Where is our meal? Or would you rather be fed to thecombat creatures?”“At least then someone would have a meal,” the wizard Damon muttered, strokinghis drooping mustaches.Wearing drab tunics sashed at the waist, slaves hurried in with a selection offine foods in petite portions meant to be sampled. There were small roastedsongbirds on skewers, coated with honey; crimson cubes of raw yaxen liver andpaper-thin slices of air-dried yaxen meat; sugary confections spun likecaterpillar cocoons; tart slices of tangerines; dishes of ruby-red pomegranateseeds.Thora served herself first, taking whatever she liked, while Maxim chivalrouslyoffered the food to Nicci. She made selections without particular interest.Nathan was more curious, asking the servers to identify each item. He tasted themorsels, then chose seconds of the ones he liked best. He had no fondness forthe raw yaxen liver, but the fruit pleased him greatly.After the duma members were fed, Bannon was offered the leftovers. He smiledcheerfully and thanked the servers, who looked uncomfortable, before heremembered to thank his hosts.Equally spaced around the perimeter of the combat arena, tall stone pillars weretopped with bronze bowls shaped like flames. Gifted nobles stood at the base ofeach pillar, and when the fanfare sounded, they touched the stone pillars,released their magic, and ignited dazzling white flames that soared up from thebronze bowls like beacons. The crowd in the stands let out an appreciativecheer.Nicci sat silent and alert, trying to comprehend the type of magic used here.The ancient wizards had laid down spell-forms and complex webs throughout thecity’s architecture in much the same way the aqueducts distributed water.A stocky man with a shaved head and voluminous yellow robes sat on a highplatform above the fighting field. He spoke into a large crystal on a silverstand, and his voice boomed from the magical flames, as if his words had beenconjured out of the pillars. “Our beloved champion has remained undefeated forfive months. He has held his title and held our hearts. Let him emerge into thearena so he can bask in the sun of Ildakar, the cheers of our people … and theblood of another vanquished enemy.”An iron gate opened below, and a muscular man strode out onto the ashes andsand, raising a wide-bladed sword to the sky, which summoned the cheers of theobservers. He wore brown leather boots, a girded loincloth wrapped around hiships, and a thick belt studded with sharp points. Two wide straps of leatherrose from the belt, crossed over his back and his chest, providing only minimalprotection. A full helmet with a nose guard and swooped chin guards masked hisface. The champion’s pale skin was covered with a network of scars; his muscleswere chiseled by years of training. Nicci could see he would be a formidablefighter.His body language exuded joy and confidence, not the fear a gibbering victimmight exhibit. He seemed to thrive in his environment. The champion turnedslowly from side to side, jabbing his sword in the air to prod more shouts fromthe audience. They responded as expected.From the private spectator tower, the duma members watched like analyticalobservers. Fleshmancer Andre leaned forward with an eager glint in his grayeyes. “The champion has never faced an opponent like our new one.” He raised hiseyebrows at Nathan. “Hmmm? Soon you’ll see the results of my fleshmancy.”“It better be a fine show,” Ivan growled. “I have animals that need practice.”“You don’t want the champion to kill them all,” Andre said.The chief handler was unconvinced. “And what if he kills your new creation?”“I have high confidence in my work. But if that happens, I shall have to improvemy design for next time, hmmm?”The announcer continued in his spell-amplified voice. “Our champion faces a newopponent today, something never before released into the combat arena.” Thewords boomed out through the lighted torches, and the spectators fell into anominous, anticipatory hush. “Behold the fleshmancer’s new creation!”Ivan picked up a honey-coated songbird and crunched it, bones and all, but didnot take his eyes from the combat field. Andre fidgeted in his seat, barely ableto contain his excitement.The champion crouched, holding up his short sword as he faced the barred gate onthe opposite side of the crater wall. His cocky verve had faded. Though thehelmet obscured his features, Nicci could detect the fighter’s intensity offocus. She sensed no touch of the gift within him. The champion’s combat skillshad been earned through his own prowess.The barred gate opened, and a figure emerged from the shadowy pits beneath thearena. The spectators might have expected some horrific animal, like a combatbear, but the figure lurched forward on two feet, stepping into the sunlight toreveal well-muscled thighs, sturdy boots laced to the top of the calf, anarmored loincloth, two extended hands, each gripping a short sword identical tothe one carried by the champion.When the opponent emerged into the light, its true monstrosity was revealed.Seated on the fighter’s broad shoulders were two heads, the pair of necks spreadapart from a bifurcated spine, fused in place. Both faces were snarling andsneering in agony as well as rage. Drool came from the left head’s mouth, a baldman with a large, round scar on his scalp. The darker skin on the smooth headdid not match the shoulder onto which it had been grafted.The legs staggered forward drunkenly as if receiving conflicting instructionsfrom the rival heads, but each sword arm was held aloft and slashed erratically.The crowd gasped and murmured. The champion recoiled at the sight of his newopponent. Andre chuckled. “Our great champion has never seen anything like that,hmmm?”“He’s seen and killed plenty of opponents before,” Ivan said.Like a weapon with a single-minded purpose, the two-headed warrior lumberedforward, uttering defiant groans from twin throats.Nathan leaned closer to Andre. “Considering that your new creation has two humanminds, it seems to have lost its intellect.”“It didn’t need intellect, just prowess. I was forced to sacrifice some factorsto enhance others. Just like silk yaxen are created for their beauty, not theirwit. This thing will never be admired for its conversation.”The two-headed warrior’s lurching gait was deceptive, but the champion didn’tseem fooled. He darted in, thrusting his short sword like a stinger. The momenthe approached within striking distance, the horrific opponent plunged into ablur of motion, sweeping the left sword, then the right, as if it meant to gutthe champion twice. The man danced out of the way, scuttling backward so swiftlyhe tripped on his heels. One of the opponent’s blades sliced the champion’supper arm, drawing blood.From hundreds of throats in the crowd, a simultaneous gasp of dismay rumbledthrough the arena. The champion ducked, showing no sign that he even recognizedhe had been cut.The two-headed fighter came at him again with both blades, sweeping, stabbing,slashing. The champion parried with a loud clang of his short sword. He duckedback as the monstrosity’s other hand swept the second blade toward him. Thechampion drove in, thrusting with his sword.The two-headed creature spun so that instead of the blade disemboweling it, thepoint merely traced a long red line up its rib cage. It roared in pain out ofboth throats, then brought the left-hand sword down, battering the champion’ssolid helmet with the pommel. The champion reeled, stunned. Backing off, headjusted the helmet.The two-headed warrior charged in, and the champion stumbled weakly, staggered …and Nicci recognized what he was doing. He lured the monstrous fighter closer,and just as the right arm swept down with the blade, the champion thrust upward,stabbing through his opponent’s bicep, and then yanked down like a butcherslicing out a fine hunk of meat. The monster’s right arm was laid bare down tothe bone, and the limb hung useless, spasming before dropping the sword. Thegrafted head on that side roared and rolled its eyes. The left arm reacted,trying to defend by raising its sword.But the wiry champion was full of energy now, no longer feigning anydisorientation. He dodged the blow, then gripped his short sword with both handsfor a brutal slash. Cutting sideways like a woodcutter felling a tree, he loppedoff the warrior’s original head, severing it cleanly from its natural neck.Gushing blood from the stump on its shoulder, the horrific creation reeled andwavered, standing on the blood-soaked sand.Like an overripe squash, the severed head dropped to the ground, leaking blood,its expression still distorted with the last flickers of life.The remaining head, the bald one grafted into place, wailed. Nicci thought thesound was distinctly filled with grief, not pain. The clumsy legs buckled at theknees, dropping to the sand. Dropping the other sword, the thing reached forwardwith both its good arm and the mangled one, using both hands to pick up andcradle the other head, cooing and moaning in despair.The champion stalked forward with no mercy and no pity—or perhaps it was amercy, Nicci thought. With another stroke, he chopped off the second head, whichrolled onto the uneven ground next to its companion. The two-headed warrior’sbody dropped to the sand, like a bull felled by a butcher’s sledgehammer.The crowd roared, suddenly released from their sullen anxiety. Now theircelebration was genuine glee.Chief Handler Ivan crossed his massive arms over his vest made from the pelt ofa sand panther. “At least it was a good show.”Andre looked frustrated. “The champion has no modifications whatsoever. He isjust a man and should not be able to defeat my creations.”“That’ll keep you on your toes,” Maxim said with a smirk. “You just need to makebetter creations.”Thora said, “Listen to the crowd. They are still cheering the champion. Iexpected them to grow tired of him by now.”Elsa leaned forward. “They celebrate the skills of the champion, Sovrena, andthey would not want to see him defeated by a monstrosity like that. You shouldmake him fight better and better human combatants. The people will only acceptanother human champion.”“For now, let him have his victory,” said Maxim, and then his lips quirked in asmile. “I’m sure Adessa will reward him quite well tonight. She has taken him asher lover already, has she not?”Thora sniffed. “Of course. She takes each champion as her lover.”Below in the arena, standing over the butchered body of the fleshmancer’screation, the champion raised his bloody sword and turned in circles to receivethe adulation of the crowd. When the cheers built to a crescendo, he reached upto grasp his helmet, pulling it off and flinging it free. He threw it far acrossthe bloody sands so that he could smile and bask in the open air. He raised bothhands in triumph.* * *Bannon watched the violent combat with trepidation. He had fought and killedmany enemies since joining Nicci and Nathan, and he’d felt no remorse when hedefended himself against the ferocious selka or the Lifedrinker’s dust people.But the very idea of bloody combat for sport displayed a cruelty that he couldnot understand.He was sure his abusive father would have enjoyed the spectacle.Bannon had hardened since leaving Chiriya Island. The darkest and ugliest daysat home had nearly ruined him, but Bannon clung to and nurtured a spark ofoptimism and a sense of good in the world despite all the tragedies he hadsuffered. Now he squirmed uncomfortably at the sound of the cheers, the sight ofthe bloodshed. That horrific monster didn’t deserve to die any more than thedistorted combat bear they had encountered … but such monstrosities should nothave been created in the first place. They were unnatural and sickening.He struggled with his feelings but did not understand them. When he watched thechampion kill his opponent, though, Bannon acknowledged that it was a battle forsurvival. He supposed that people under extreme circumstances would do justabout anything to stay alive. He himself certainly had.The champion removed his helmet and stood exposed so the audience could see hisface. As the victorious warrior turned his head up to stare at the crowd, Bannonfroze. He knew that face. He recognized the eyes, the wide cheekbones, therounded chin, even the grin.He had seen that grin on a young boy’s face in times of joy, long ago in achildhood that had ended in violence and slavery.Ian!The champion was his friend Ian, stolen away by Norukai slavers so many yearsago."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 19 [contents.xhtml#c_ch19]Thaddeus, the new town leader of Renda Bay, was happy to receive the two youngscholars from Cliffwall. “We will help you meet your needs,” he told Oliver andPeretta. “For the sorceress Nicci and the wizard Nathan, we’d do anything toshow our gratitude. They saved our town.” His lips quirked in a smile. “Even theswordsman Bannon defeated more than his share of Norukai slavers. I think he hasa genuine vendetta against them.”Oliver nodded. “Yes, we watched all three of them fight many impossible enemies.They have many stories to tell.” He patted the pouch at his side in which hecarried the reports Nicci and Nathan wished to have delivered up to D’Hara. “Iwouldn’t believe them if I hadn’t seen myself what they could do.”“Aye, we know some of what they endured,” Thaddeus said. “Join us for a townfeast this evening, and we will share stories.”“I can recite our tales accurately,” said Peretta, tossing her mop of tight darkringlets. “I remember every detail.”“She really does,” Oliver added, “and she won’t let you forget it.”The slender girl huffed as if finding some insult in what Oliver had said. Helaughed because he’d known that would be her exact reaction, but still heenjoyed her company. Then, after she looked at him, Peretta’s expression melted.“Oliver and I have been traveling together for too long. Sometimes we know whatthe other might think.”“I would only think the best of you, Peretta,” he said with a congenial smile.“We share the same important mission.”“Yes, we do, and I suppose your companionship is … tolerable.”Oliver felt himself blushing, and Peretta snickered at him. In a way, he knew,they were much alike. Both of them had been born and raised in Cliffwall,trained among the scholars and brought up to love the history and lore stored inthe books there.Oliver’s father was an orchard tender and a beekeeper. When he was young, Oliverhad helped him pick the apples and pears, and also to set out the beehives sothey could carefully harvest the honey. But the boy had been stung too manytimes because he was simply too distracted, daydreaming about the stories in thebooks stored up in the great archive. After Oliver could read, his father hadlet him go up to Cliffwall to be tested by the scholars, and once that dream gotinto his head, the boy couldn’t think of anything else.One day Oliver accidentally knocked over a beehive, setting loose an angrybuzzing swarm to swoop through the canyon. The boy had only saved himself fromcountless stings by diving face-first into the fast-flowing brook. At the timehe had been lost in ideas about how to catalog the types of spells in theshelves, even though he had only the vaguest idea what sorts of spells existedat all. Angry, his father had marched him—still dripping wet from the brook—upthe winding cliff path.His father presented him to Scholar-Archivist Simon. “I promise, he will be ofmore use to you than he is to me. He’ll be happy here, and his mother and I cancome visit him whenever we like.” He glanced in dismay at his son. “Read to yourheart’s content, while I go see if I can fix that hive.”Oliver loved his family, but the call of the great library and all its knowledgehad always been too strong for him. Even now, though he had volunteered for themission Nicci requested, he dreamed of being back among the warm and friendlybooks, but he convinced himself he was learning far more about the world on thisjourney than he had known in his entire previous life … the vastness of theland, the mountains, the ocean, and now the villagers in Renda Bay.To celebrate the visitors, the people hosted a meal in the town square with aroasted goat in addition to bushels of boiled mussels in an enormous pot mixedwith salty seaweed. Though many villagers engaged them in conversation, Oliverfelt embarrassed by all the attention being showered upon them. He thought ofthe times he had spent alone in the Cliffwall archives with nothing but booksand scrolls as his companions. He sat on a splintered wooden bench next toPeretta, who was far less shy than he was. The gregarious young memmer chattedwith anyone who expressed an interest.Nicci had made it clear that her report should be widely shared, so the peopleof the Old World could draw together and follow the basic rules Lord Rahl setdown for the D’Haran Empire. For their own part, the villagers embellished thefearsome tale of the Norukai attack and how the sorceress had driven them back,destroying three of their sturdy serpent ships.As full dark set in and the meal wrapped up, Thaddeus introduced a hardy manwith a face weathered by too much salt and wind. His long brown hair, parted inthe middle, hung past his ears to where it met a bushy brown beard with enoughwiry mass to hide a number of small wild animals.“This is Kenneth,” said the town leader, “a fisherman with his own boat and arestless heart.”Kenneth thrust out a large callused hand and shook Oliver’s with enough force tohurt his elbow. When the fisherman took Peretta’s, he was gentler, but his handwas so large it engulfed hers. “Most importantly, I have no real ties to RendaBay, though I grew up here.”Thaddeus explained, “Kenneth means that he is willing to offer his boat and takeyou north.”“I’ve heard of some of the cities up there, but I’ve never seen them.” WhenKenneth scratched his beard, his fingers disappeared up to the second knuckle.“I was always waiting for the excuse.”“Do you have charts and maps?” Oliver asked. “To know where we’re going?”“I haven’t the faintest clue, but I imagine that if we follow the coast northlong enough, we’ll find something.”Without consulting her companion, Peretta said, “We accept your offer, Kenneth.We’ll go with you.”Oliver stammered, “W-We can’t pay, though.”“The sorceress already paid Renda Bay enough for a lifetime of favors,” Kennethsaid. “Besides, if I go with you and come back, people will buy me free drinksin the inn for a year. I consider that payment in full.”Kenneth’s plate overflowed with the sopping, steaming seagreens and a hunk ofroast goat from which a twisted bone protruded. He sat heavily on the bench nextto Peretta, though there was plenty of room on the other side. He fell to hismeal with great gusto. “Don’t often get goat. For a fisherman, every meal tasteslike the sea. Red meat has an entirely different flavor.” He filled his mouth,talking as he chewed.Thaddeus stood behind them, proud. “We’ll let you take some of the leftover meatfor your voyage, Kenneth.”“When would we be departing?” Oliver asked, looking forward to a night spent ina comfortable bed here in Renda Bay.“Why, tomorrow, of course. First light,” Kenneth said. “I already have basicsupplies aboard my boat—the Daisy. My water casks are full, and we’ll fish alongthe way, so there’ll be plenty to eat.”Though he had taken only a few sips of the sour local wine, Oliver felt deeplyweary. Kenneth’s pronouncement filled him with dismay. “We’re leaving at dawn?”“You said you were in a hurry,” the fisherman said.“We are,” Peretta added.“We are,” Oliver agreed, trying to hide the disappointment in his voice, thoughhe had hoped for a longer rest.“Be at the Daisy an hour before dawn, so we can have everything ready before weget under way.”Kenneth finished his large plate of food, then went back to the communalcauldron and ladled up a small mountain of yawning black mussels.* * *As the sun rose over the landmass to the east, spreading a bright orange veilover the rugged lands through which they had trekked, the fishing boat set offfrom Renda Bay and turned north. Kenneth spread the sail to catch a fresheningbreeze, and soon they were making good time.When Oliver offered to help with chores, the fisherman just looked the youngscholar up and down. “You’re so scrawny. I wager the most you’ve ever lifted issome heavy reading.”Peretta giggled. “I think that’s true.”Kenneth reassured them. “I’ve been piloting the Daisy alone for so long, I knowhow to do everything solo. I’ll call for help if I need it.”As the day grew warm and the sun beat down on the open water, he pulled off hisrough-spun shirt and tossed it into the cabin, standing bare-chested in thewind. Peretta turned away embarrassed. The bearded man laughed at her reaction.“As I said, I’ve sailed by myself for so long, I don’t see any reason to changejust because I have company.”“It’s perfectly fine,” Peretta said in a prim voice.Later in the increasingly warm afternoon, Oliver pulled off his own shirt, andPeretta seemed amused by his rail-thin form. Kenneth gave him an appraisinglook. “It would be a courtesy if I let you build up your muscles.” He loweredhis voice and spoke in a stage whisper, which he knew full well that Perettacould hear. “You’re not going to impress the young lady with a physique likethat.”“I am not trying to impress the young lady. In fact, since she knows myscholarly abilities, she should already be impressed.” Oliver knew he soundeddefensive, but it was only because of his embarrassment.Peretta came to his rescue. “I admit that Oliver is a mighty scholar.”Kenneth let out a booming laugh. “Then you’re a better man than I. I never gotaround to reading any books. Too much fishing to do.”By the time the sun had lowered to the horizon and the temperature dropped,Oliver felt a chill enhanced by the tingling burn on his skin. He had never beenshirtless long enough to get sunburned before. He shivered and put his shirtback on.The Daisy sailed northward for six days into uncharted waters, never strayingfar from shore. During all that time, they saw no other sailing ships, nor anycities, not even small settlements along the way.“That’s why the fishing is so good up here—no competition,” Kenneth said, as hehauled up another net of flopping silvery creatures, which he dumped on thedeck. He sorted out only the ones he said were the best tasting and threw therest back overboard. “If we’re hungry, we’ll catch more tomorrow.”Kenneth had eaten all of the leftover roast goat in the first two days. Thoughhe had offered some to the two travelers, Oliver and Peretta knew how much hefancied the delicacy, and so they contented themselves with seafood—which was,to canyon dwellers like themselves, equally exotic.“I suppose this is the Phantom Coast,” said Kenneth, after two more days ofsailing, seeing only empty coastline. “Once we’re past it, we’ll start seeingcities.”One morning they awoke to fog so thick it felt suffocating. Oliver and Perettastood out on deck marveling at the mist as if it were the most wondrous thingthey had ever seen. Kenneth found their reaction baffling until Oliver explainedthat fog never occurred in the desert.“Enjoy it while you can,” he said. “Right now, it’s a damned nuisance. Can’t seewhere we’re going.” He stood at the Daisy’s bow, peering ahead, guiding themslowly. Oliver joined him, squinting for hidden obstacles, but his vision wasuncertain in the best of times, so he was little help. Peretta fetched a blanketfrom the cabin below and wrapped it around her narrow shoulders as she stoodnext to them.They were all together as the thick mists parted, as if a sculptor were yankingaway a veil to reveal his newest creation. Peretta gasped as they saw thesilhouette, and then sharper details, of a huge figure that loomed before them.“Sweet Sea Mother!” Kenneth cried, then laughed at his own words. “It truly is.”The stone form of a beautiful woman was carved from the living rock of anoutcropping that towered above the water. She was enormous and beautiful.Tresses of stone hair flowed like the waves of an outgoing tide, rippling backinto the cliff. Seawater crashed among the algae-covered rocks at the base ofthe bluff, where the sculpture ended. The statue showed the Sea Mother only fromthe waist up, as if she rose from the tide line, her arms outstretched, handsraised to the sky. Birds flitted around her carved face and rounded breasts.The waves crashed, and the fog continued to clear. Kenneth adjusted course anddrove the Daisy onward. “We’re almost to Serrimundi! That statue is legendary.Never thought I’d see it myself.”As the mist dwindled, they spotted other fishing boats and larger sailing shipsout in the water. Kenneth stared at the shoreline and the piled buildings in thehills leading from the harbor. “They make big cities here in the north.”Oliver squinted, focusing on the tall temples, the great white buildings,impossible stone arches that rose high in the air and spanned the width of twodifferent rivers that flowed through Serrimundi and spilled into the sea. Agold-topped bell tower was the tallest structure in view. “I have read aboutmany huge cities in ancient times, but nothing prepared me for this.”“I thought the great library in Cliffwall was the largest building in theworld,” Peretta said. “I was wrong.”After traveling with her for so many weeks, Oliver was surprised to hear theyoung memmer admit her fallibility, but he did not tease her about it. They allstood together and marveled at the glorious sights as Kenneth guided the Daisyinto the busy harbor. “Serrimundi. I promised I would take you here. This iswhere you wanted to be.”“This is just a start,” Peretta said. She drew a deep breath and let it out, butshe was smiling, as was Oliver.“We still have a long way to go,” he said, but after all they had accomplished,he felt that the journey was no longer so impossible."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 20 [contents.xhtml#c_ch20]When Fleshmancer Andre called him back to his studio, Nathan was more uneasythan excited, but he was determined to find a way to restore his gift. He wasconvinced that somewhere, somehow, Ildakar held the secret to making him wholeagain.He was reluctant to tell Nicci about the strangeness he’d seen in thefleshmancer’s laboratory. No matter what Andre said, Nathan could not considerthe man an inspired artist, not since witnessing the glee with which he fusedthe two mangled warriors, like a seamstress using scraps of cloth to make apatchwork quilt.But he wasn’t required to admire or even like the person who helped him. Thefleshmancer was eccentric, even horrific at times, but he was indeed a powerfulwizard. Nathan only hoped Andre wouldn’t make him part of some twisteddemonstration like the two-headed warrior he had created. Because he could.If he needed the wizards of Ildakar to restore his gift, he would endure, but hewas already planning how soon he and his companions could depart from thisplace. Despite how entranced he had been by the myths of Ildakar, Nathan now sawthe tarnish on what should have been a shining metropolis. Reshaping an entiresociety was not something the three companions could do alone.…He set off for the fleshmancer’s mansion. Perhaps today Andre would have aconcrete solution for how to restore Nathan’s “heart of a wizard.” He passedthrough the distorted gardens, the uniquely shaped hedges, flowers, and stuntedtrees. As he walked along, Nathan forced a smile, clinging to a hint ofoptimism—it was something that young Bannon Farmer had taught him.Even before he could announce himself, the fleshmancer came out to greet him. Hehad an eager, hungry expression. “Welcome, Nathan-who-would-be-a-wizard-again.”His braided beard stood out like a corn shock on the tip of his chin. “I lookforward to continuing our research. After yesterday’s unfortunate showing in thecombat arena, I am honor-bound to demonstrate my prowess in other ways.” Henarrowed his glittering eyes. “Let us achieve a resounding success for yourproblem, shall we, hmmm? I am willing to do whatever it takes.” He leanedcloser. “Are you?”A few days ago, before he was more familiar with Ildakar, Nathan would havereadily agreed. Now he felt uncomfortable, and he chose his words carefully. “Iwill work closely with you. It’s important to me to restore my gift.”“And it is important to Ildakar. Come, we have body maps to make and experimentsto perform.”Andre led him through the separate wings of the large mansion. In the mainlaboratory studio, hung with indigo cloths, the tables had been scoured clean,scrubbed of any traces of blood from the two mangled warriors. The air still hada sour fetid smell. The tanks containing what Andre called “ingredients offlesh” simmered away, and the exotic, unnatural fish swam in its aquarium.Andre hummed as they walked on a tiled pathway to an isolated courtyard behindthe house. “We require open sunlight for our next measurement. I need toconstruct a map of the gift within you, the tangled paths in the fibers of yourbeing as well as the scars of residue from when the gift fizzled away. We haveto restore them.” He stroked his fingers down his knotted beard. “And that maytake some doing, hmmm?”Outside, overhanging vines stirred disturbingly without any breezes. Strangescaled palm trees rose tall above the roofline of the mansion. Their droopingfronds had razor edges, and their plated trunks reminded him of the hide ofBrom, the gray dragon who guarded the bones of his kind in Kuloth Vale. Two ofthe palms stood six feet apart, and stretched between them was a vertical squareof white fabric as tall as a man, suspended by gossamer white ropes. Beneath theblank fabric was an empty patch of smooth white sand.“Here is the canvas on which we must work, my friend,” Andre said. “But it isnot just a blank sheet. At the beginning of any project, an artist views theendless potential of his subject.” A low table in front of the stretched fabricheld glazed clay pots filled with grainy powders of turquoise blue, rust red,brilliant yellow.The fleshmancer gestured impatiently. “Stand in front of the fabric. How else doyou expect me to make the map, hmmm?”“I don’t understand this kind of map,” Nathan said, stepping forward hesitantly.“How is it created?”“The powders and chemicals are my own proprietary mixture. When I cast them,they capture the lines of your aura. It is a way of marking your Han, tracingthe lines of force. I cannot see it with my own eyes, nor can you, but thepowders follow it, like iron filings mark out the lines of attraction around alodestone.”Nathan stood uncertainly in the soft sand, facing the blank fabric. “Like this?”Andre crossed his arms over his chest. “You do insist on making thingsdifficult, don’t you? No wonder you lost your gift!”“What have I done wrong now?”Exasperated, the fleshmancer waved his hands. “You must be naked, of course! Howelse can the powder find the tracks of your Han?”“How else indeed?” Nathan muttered with a sigh, knowing not to argue. Heshrugged out of his wizard’s robe and removed his boots, then submitted to themeasurement.Mumbling, Andre studied the powders in the jars. He dipped his finger into apale blue mixture, sniffed it, then tried the yellow substance instead. Nodding,he scooped a handful of the bright powder and stepped up to his subject.Nathan frowned. “What is it that you—”The fleshmancer hurled the powder, and the spray of dust struck him in thecenter of his chest. Nathan flinched, recoiled, then sneezed, but when he lookeddown at his bare chest, none of the powder had stuck to his skin. It was gone.Andre puttered among the jars, picked up the blue powder, and threw some of it,aiming lower. Nathan watched the powder strike him … and absorb into his skin. Atingle sizzled throughout his body.Laughing, the fleshmancer seemed to consider it a game. Another handful andanother, six different powders in all, but as each cloud of dust struck him anddisappeared, Nathan realized he felt weaker. Something was being sapped fromhim.“Now, again—but this time you must try to use your gift. Concentrate, dosomething easy. Create a flicker of fire in your hand.”Nathan frowned. “Yes, that used to be easy.” He remembered trying to do that onthe deck of the Wavewalker just before the storm and the selka attack. It hadbeen the first indication that his gift might be waning. “But it could backfire.At times, the gift twists and releases magic altogether contradictory to mywishes. I might … I might burn down your villa.”The fleshmancer snickered. “Come now, if I couldn’t stop that, then I am notmuch of a wizard myself, hmmm?” He raised his voice to a sharp, startling shout.“Use your magic!”Nathan reacted, instinctively reaching for his gift to summon fire in his palm.He pushed, stretched his fingers apart, willed flame to ignite there.Andre hurled more dust, emptying an entire pot against Nathan’s chest.No magic came, not even a tiny flicker. The villa did not explode into flames,and the only increased heat came from Nathan’s straining. A drop of perspirationtingled on his brow, but that was all.“Nothing. I’m sorry.”“Even so, that is all we need.” Smiling, the fleshmancer slapped his palmstogether, brushing stray dust from them. “Now, let us admire our work, hmmm?” Henudged Nathan out of the way.As Nathan stepped away from the white fabric, feeling his knees shake, he turnedto look at the formerly blank canvas. Somehow, when Andre threw the powders athim, the essence had passed directly through his body and adhered to the fabric.Lines and swirls of muted colors created an intricate map like a seaman’s chartof currents, or a cartographer’s conception of all the streams in a mountainrange. But these lines had the vague outline of a man—Nathan.“Is that my gift?” he asked. “All the patterns within me?”Andre nodded slowly. “It is an interesting suggestion of what should be. But youcan see the problem.” He pointed to the colorful design. “Here.”Unmindful of his nakedness, Nathan was fascinated by the result, not to mentionthe fact that the test had required no blood or pain. Andre indicated the centerof what seemed to denote Nathan’s chest on the diagram. “You see how pale thisis? The emptiness where your heart should be? That is where your gift hasvanished. The Han permeates every blood vessel, every muscle fiber, every inchof skin, every shaft of hair. Except there. You can see what you have lost.”Nathan felt a heavy weight inside of him. He did indeed see. The markings of theexotic map were plain. “It’s gone then?”“Gone.” Andre snapped lids back on the assorted pots of colorful powders. “Butthat doesn’t mean we can’t replace it. We just need to find what is missing andput it back. I am, of course, up to the challenge.” Andre seemed intrigued. “Andthe other wizards will be pleased to hear that at least it’s not contagious. AsI suspected.”“I am pleased to hear that as well,” Nathan said.“Restoring you is not beyond our abilities. As you know, the wizards of Ildakarhave created tremendous things, hmmm?”Nathan tried to keep the uncertainty out of his voice. “I’ve seen some of yourwork as a fleshmancer. Some might consider it … unorthodox. You call yourself anartist, but now you’re trying to heal my problem. Do you think of yourself as ahealer too?”Andre snorted. “Healers and torturers are both experts in the same art. Both areknowledgeable in pain and endurance, in life and death. I am a master of allaspects.” He waved his hands again. “Now I have something to show you in anotherwing of my mansion. Dress yourself—I have no interest in seeing a naked old manunless I have to.”Nathan smiled. “I am oddly relieved to hear you say that.” He donned hisborrowed wizard’s robe again and sat on one of the garden benches to pull on hisboots.Andre jabbered as he waited. “In the ancient days of many wars and many enemies,we had to create weapons powerful enough to defend the city and its people. Youhave already seen how we lifted the plain above the Killraven River … and whatcould be more impressive than Wizard Commander Maxim’s petrification spell thatturned the army of General Utros into statues? Or the blood magic that projectedthe shroud to wall us off from time?”“All of that is indeed impressive,” Nathan said, stomping his heel on the groundto seat the foot properly in his boot.Andre’s eyes sparkled. “I myself created tremendous warriors, veritable gods ofwarfare. I’m very proud of them, hmmm? Would you like to see?”Nathan smoothed down the fabric of his green wizard’s robe. “Did these warriorshelp you win the war?”“I haven’t had a chance to use them yet.” He sounded disappointed. “But they areready—always ready. Come, I want to show them to you.”Nathan followed the fleshmancer through another arch into a high-ceilinged wingof the mansion. “I named them Ixax warriors. Even with all my efforts, all myskills, I could only create three of them … but three Ixax warriors should besufficient to save our city against the most terrible enemies.” As they enteredthe cavernous wing, he pulled back a curtain to reveal three giants standingthere like motionless titans, fifteen feet high.The Ixax warriors were shaped like men, immense in the shoulders with torsos aslarge as wagons, their heads the size of a cartwheel. The figures were encasedin voluminous armor like a riveted steel shell covering their swollen biceps,their waists, their treelike thighs. Each head was encased in a helmet like acauldron flattened against the sides of their cheeks, leaving only a thin slitfor a mouth and another slit for the eyes. Large, rounded studs covered theirchests. Their hands wore massive gauntlets with spiked knuckles, and a beltencircled their waists. Their boots were enormous, one footfall capable ofcrushing a horse to pulp.They were motionless, locked in place, arms rigid at their sides, feet anchoredto the floor.Andre openly admired them. “Behold, my warriors! I made these three fifteenhundred years ago when we knew Emperor Kurgan’s armies were on the move. Aftertaking three human subjects, I used all my magic and pulled together everythingthat I understood of flesh, of life, and of power. From mere humans, I createdthese three gigantic and indestructible weapons, the most powerful soldiers evercreated. One Ixax is strong enough to slaughter five thousand enemysoldiers—that is how I designed them.” He lovingly caressed the gauntlet of thenearest figure. The Ixax didn’t flinch. “They are primed and ready … as theyhave been for fifteen hundred years.”Nathan was indeed impressed, thinking of such a monstrosity turned loose on anunsuspecting enemy army. “They are held in a stasis spell, then? Frozen in timeuntil they are unleashed?”“Oh, no—they are exactly ready. We cannot tolerate any delay if the city were tobe threatened, hmmm?”“What do you mean?”“These three Ixax warriors have stood awake and aware right here, unable to movefor fifteen centuries.”“Awake … and aware?” Nathan looked at them with sudden uneasiness.“A simple locking spell keeps them immobile, but they can hear us talking now.”“And do they sleep?” Nathan asked, already dreading the answer.“No, they are awake every second of every day. We cannot be unprepared. Theseweapons may be our last resort. The Ixax have nothing to do but stand here andthink about their duty, should it ever arise.”Nathan took a nervous step back, trying to grasp the nightmare of these threewarriors—whether volunteers or perhaps unwilling subjects. They had beentransformed by the fleshmancer’s magic, held immobile, staring for every secondof every day for fifteen centuries. Nathan felt a chill run down his back.By now these Ixax warriors must be entirely insane.Through the eye slit in the iron helmet of the nearest warrior, Nathan saw aglint of yellow eyes staring at him."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 21 [contents.xhtml#c_ch21]As Bannon walked the streets of Ildakar, alone with his thoughts, he carriedguilt as heavy as a sledge piled with cut stone. His jaw ached from clenchinghis teeth to hold in his anger and disgust.Ever since seeing that the bloody arena champion was Ian—innocent, carefree,laughing Ian from Chiriya Island—Bannon had been so consumed with dark memoriesthat he could barely live with himself.In the morning, after waking from a sleep full of nightmares, he looked at hisface in the reflecting basin, then splashed water in his reddened eyes. He sawhis drawn expression. After the arena spectacle, he had avoided Nicci andNathan, even though they knew the painful story of how he had run away from theattack, leaving his best friend to be captured by the raiders.…As he emerged from the grand villa, not knowing what to do, he found Amos, Jed,and Brock. Dressed in bright colors, laughing, jostling one another, the threecompanions had offered a perfunctory invitation for Bannon to join them inwhatever they decided to do that day. Bannon had not felt like their company,though. “No thank you … I have other plans this morning.” They didn’t seem tocare whether or not he would join them.Shoring up his courage, knowing he had to face one of the most bitter moments ofhis past, Bannon descended the streets in search of the warrior training pits.Eyes fixed on the path ahead, he spoke to no one, made no overtures to streetvendors or craftsmen.He carried Sturdy at his side, letting his fingers rest on the wornleather-wrapped hilt. He didn’t expect to fight, but having the familiar bladeat hand gave him the strength for what he would have to do. He was haunted bythat day back on Chiriya when he and Ian had gone down to their private covewhere there were tide pools full of shells and crabs and interesting fish. Itwas a fine place for two curious and bright-eyed boys to play, and Bannonconsidered it a refuge from his father. When he was there with Ian, his bestfriend, he felt safe, able to imagine a brighter world.But the cove was not safe after all. Norukai slaver ships had cruised around thepoint, longboats coming to shore, and the vicious, scarred men grabbed Bannonand tried to drag him away to become a slave. But Ian fought back, gave hisfriend the chance to run … and in doing so, Ian got himself captured. Instead ofrunning back to help him, instead of fighting to save him, Bannon simply ranaway. The last thing he remembered after scrambling to the top of the cliffs waslooking back at his friend’s despairing face as the slavers tumbled him intotheir longboat and rowed away with him forever.…Bannon had never thought to see him again, assumed the boy had died in somesweaty hellhole. Now he knew that Ian had been brought here, sold as a slave,taught to fight. Bannon recalled his own blood fury when he battled the Norukaiat Renda Bay. He had killed many of the hideous men when the surge of angerdrove him into a frenzy he had never before experienced.Ian must have fought like that every day, sentenced to live and die in thecombat arena. Just yesterday he had stood in the sand before the cheeringaudience, facing the monstrous two-headed warrior. This was not a rare battle:It was Ian’s life.Bannon felt so sickened that he wrapped an arm over his stomach to contain theroiling acid of emotions there. He had to see his friend, had to speak with him.No matter what it took, how much he needed to beg Amos or the sovrena and wizardcommander, Bannon would free his friend, although he was many years too late.As he approached the high-walled arena, he passed a menagerie of strange anddeadly creatures. A rock wall, an exposed part of the sandstone outcropping onwhich the city was built, had several tunnel openings leading into darkchambers. From inside, he could hear yowls and snarls, growling noises, and thegruff voice of Chief Handler Ivan as he bellowed at the animals. Wafting outfrom the opening, the stench was thick and musky, rich with excrement and pain.Bannon peered inside, swallowing hard. He had been told that one of these largetunnels led to the underground combat pits where the arena warriors were heldand trained.Large, barred pens held predatory animals pacing back and forth, lashing out atany enemy. Bannon gaped at another huge combat bear that smashed itself againand again into the iron bars, which held firm. Gray-green lizards the size ofsmall dragons hissed and belched, splashing into a scum-covered pool in thefloor of their pen.Inside the wide, torch-lit tunnel, Ivan stood next to a cart piled with bloodychunks of meat, thick bones sawed into pieces, loose wet entrails. On top of themound of meat rested two severed yaxen heads, their slack dead faces showingoddly humanlike expressions of despair. Ivan picked up one of the heads by thematted black hair and tossed it into a barred lair that held three sandpanthers.As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, Bannon watched the felines fight over thepiece of meat. He thought of Mrra, who had remained outside the city, and hisheart sank, realizing now that the cat had known how grim the glorious city was.No wonder she had run off as Amos and his companions approached.Their tan hides were branded with spell symbols just like the ones on Mrra …just like the leather tunic the chief handler wore. Ivan growled at them,sounding much like his own captive beasts. He slammed a broad hand against thebars, making a loud rattling noise. “Tear it apart! Think of that as avictim—you’ll have more to eat if you kill anything in the combat arena.”The troka of panthers looked at the chief handler, their golden feline eyesglaring with hatred. Ivan curled the fingers of his left hand and concentrated,obviously releasing part of his gift. The panthers cringed as if receivinginstructions, and then they attacked one another, fighting over the alreadyshredded head. Ivan laughed.Feeling even more sickened, Bannon ducked out of the menagerie and went insteadto the adjacent tunnel in the sandstone outcropping, hoping that this passagemust lead to where the captive fighters were held.Two steps inside the tunnel, just beyond where the slash of sunlight penetrated,one of the morazeth leaned against the wall, watching him. She didn’t seemoverly alert, but her very presence was threatening. Bannon supposed that noother guard was necessary. Her close-cropped hair was light brown, her eyes anintense hazel. All the exposed skin on her arms, her midriff, and her thighssported designs and spell-forms scarred into her flesh.As Bannon hesitated, she looked up at him, unimpressed and uninterested. Shecrossed her arms over the black leather band that covered her breasts. Shedidn’t speak, forcing him to state his business. “I … I need to see thechampion.”“You wish to fight him?” she said. “I don’t think you could handle the champion.We aren’t taking volunteer combat today.”“No … he’s an old friend. His name is Ian. I knew him back when he was young, onChiriya Island. He will remember me.”“He’s the champion,” said the morazeth. “He needs no other name, and when he isfinally defeated and killed, there will be a new champion. Ildakar always has achampion.”“But he’s my friend,” Bannon said. “I just want to talk with him. I was therewhen—” He swallowed hard. “—when the Norukai slavers captured him.”The morazeth snorted. “None of our fighters has a past. Nothing they did beforebeing trained here matters in the least.” She looked at him, searching thebeseeching expression on his face. He did not retreat, as she seemed to expecthim to do. At last, she straightened. “But this is a matter for Adessa. I’ll letyou talk with her.”With a haughty turn, the morazeth walked into the dark tunnel, expecting him tofollow. Bannon hurried after her, seeing that the woman’s bare back was alsomarked with spell designs. She was lean and well muscled, and the wrap aroundher waist covered and yet conformed to her tight buttocks. She had an angrysexuality about her as she walked, taunting, tempting. Bannon swallowed hard andforced himself to think about Ian trapped inside these cages, tortured for allthose years, forced to fight. What a nightmare it must have been.Bannon’s life had been torn apart after he lost his friend, and he had sufferedmany other deep scars as well. He fled Chiriya to seek a new and perfect lifeout in the world. He could do nothing to save his murdered mother or the drownedkittens, which were a symbol to him of his many losses.But maybe he could do something to help Ian.The morazeth led him through the cool sandstone tunnels, finally emerging into abroad, well-lit grotto. Several circular pits in the stone floor were trainingrings, no doubt. Honeycombed passages in the rock walls led to individual barredcells, separate chambers that served as both homes and prisons for the warriors.“Adessa!” the morazeth called. “This little whip of flesh wants to see thechampion. Claims to be a friend.”The stern female trainer emerged from one of the large chambers hollowed out ofthe stone wall. “The champion has no friends—except for me. I am his trainer. Iam his reason for existence.”Adessa was older and more seasoned than the young morazeth guard. The curves inher body were coiled springs rather than feminine softness. Her face was seamedwith lines, her dark hair speckled with gray. Her brown eyes fixed on him likethe points of crossbow bolts aimed by an expert archer.Though he nearly quailed, Bannon found strength within himself. He let hisfingers touch Sturdy’s hilt and he faced her. “The champion’s name is Ian. He ismy friend. He’ll remember me.” Then he lowered his voice and muttered tohimself, “Sweet Sea Mother, I hope he remembers me.”Adessa looked at him, curious. “I vaguely remember that he said his name wasIan, a long time ago. By the time he came to me, the Norukai had mostly burnedthat identity out of him. But this might be interesting.” Her thin lips pressedtogether in an implacable line. “Lila, get back to your post. I’ll take care ofthis.”The young morazeth flashed a quick glance back at Bannon, then sauntered back upthe tunnel to resume her duty.Adessa led him past the main training grotto to a side tunnel filled with barredchambers. “I’ve given him the largest cell. It is his due as champion, merelyone of his rewards for being a fighter.” Adessa looked at Bannon, then glancedat his sword. “You fancy yourself a fighter?”He squared his shoulders. “I have killed many with my sword, but only whennecessary.”“Killing is always necessary when fighting is warranted,” Adessa said. “I doubtyou’ve been trained properly.”“The wizard Nathan Rahl trained me. He is an expert swordsman himself.”“I hear he is not even a wizard,” Adessa said. “The champion is our best. I am aharsh trainer, but I am proud of him. I have rewarded him in many ways.”“Then you can reward him by freeing him,” Bannon said, sounding much braver thanhe felt. “He was captured as a boy on Chiriya. He’s not a slave.”The morazeth trainer’s eyes widened with bitter amusement. “You don’t understandthe meaning of ‘slave.’ His life is not his own. Ildakar possesses him, and heserves his purpose. I possess him. I train him. I reward him—until he fails me.And then we will have another champion.”“His name is Ian,” he insisted, then added, “and my name is Bannon.”“Names are overrated.” Adessa stopped in front of a wall of iron bars thatblocked a well-lit chamber with a woven mat on the stone floor, a sleepingpallet, a basin of water, a chamber pot.“Champion,” Adessa called, “you have a visitor.”Bannon’s heart nearly broke to see the young man lying on the pallet. He hadrecognized Ian during the arena combat, but now he saw his friend up close. Whenthe champion sat up on the pallet and looked at him, Bannon saw that Ian was nolonger Ian. He was a stranger.“It’s me—Bannon,” he said in a raspy voice. “Do you remember me from Chiriya?From home? We were friends as boys.”The champion swung himself off the pallet and walked toward the barred doorway.He wore only a loincloth. His body was a landscape of hard muscles and whitescars. He didn’t speak.“I’m Bannon,” he said again. He gripped the bars of the cage, pleading, lookinginto the face of his friend. “We used to play together. We explored the island.We worked in the cabbage fields. Don’t you remember? We would splash in the surfor explore the tide pools. And then that day…” Bannon’s throat went dry. He drewa breath. “That day when the slavers came.”“Bannon?” the other man said, as if testing the sound of the word in his mouth.His teeth ground together, and his voice became harder, darker. “Bannon.”“Yes, the slavers tried to capture both of us, but you helped me get away. AndI…” He wasn’t sure he could go on. The memory of that day was almost more thanhe could bear, but he kept talking. “I ran, and they took you. I didn’t helpyou. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!” Tears streamed down his face. His chest hitched,and he began to sob. “Sweet Sea Mother, I am so sorry!”Ian’s face remained an implacable stone mask. He showed no reaction, norecognition. Bannon stared at him through the rippling sheen of tears, sickenedto see Ian’s transformation. His friend’s eyes looked both dead and full ofkilling. He had been changed from a carefree island boy into a ruthless fighter.“I found you again,” Bannon said. “I came back—and I have friends here inIldakar.” He clenched the iron bars. “I’ll do whatever I can to free you. I’llget you out of this place.” He reached into the cell, imploring.“Bannon…?” Ian said. Now a fire kindled behind his eyes, an angry glow. “Iremember.”“Yes, we were friends, and that day—”“You let me be captured.” Quick as a snake, Ian seized Bannon’s wrist.Crying out, he tried to pull away, but kept staring into the face of his friend.“I’ll free you. I promise, I’ll try—”“I do not want to be freed. I’m the champion. I am a fighter … and I’m here.” Heglared at Bannon, but when he looked at Adessa, his features softened into aworshipful expression. “I don’t want to be freed.” His other hand darted betweenthe bars and wrapped around Bannon’s neck, like the jaws of a pit-fighting dog.Bannon gurgled and fought, trying to pull away. “Please…”Adessa watched for a moment, amused, then whipped out a black-handledcylindrical tool from her hip. It had a thin, needle tip, like a shoemaker’sawl. She jabbed the tiny point into Ian’s forearm, and somehow it set off aburst of pain like a lightning bolt. Ian released his grip and staggered back,dropping to the floor.Bannon collapsed in front of the bars of the cell. “Ian…”“He won’t bother you again, Champion,” Adessa said.Recovering from the surge of pain, Ian climbed back to his feet and stood in hiscell, just staring at Bannon. His expression roiled with anger and disgust.Adessa grabbed Bannon by the back of his loose brown shirt, as if she wereseizing an animal by the scruff of its neck. “I can’t let my champion beunsettled. You must go away.” She hauled him from the cell.Bannon kept shouting, “But Ian! I’m sorry.”“He wants nothing to do with you,” said the morazeth trainer. “Now leave himalone.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 22 [contents.xhtml#c_ch22]As night closed in, Nicci walked alone through the spacious tiled corridors ofthe grand villa, looking up at the glittering spray of stars visible throughopen vine-framed skylights. In alcoves and corners she found marble statuesrepresenting Ildakarans in various walks of life: a slender young woman carryinga jug of water on her shoulder; a broad-chested huntsman with two hares slung athis side; a guard wearing the same short cape, scaled chest armor, and shoulderpauldron as High Captain Avery; even an old crone with a back bent from alifetime of labor and a bitter expression of spite, her head turned to one sideas if to criticize anyone who walked past.Nicci had never bothered to appreciate art, although when she’d taken Richard asher sham husband to Altur’Rang, she had seen him make wondrous carvings instone, especially the inspired and uplifting statue called Truth, whose artisticpower was so undeniable it had sparked a revolution in the oppressed city.These statues in the grand villa, though, did not seem merely decorative. Whilenot as horrific as the abominations Brother Narev had commissioned to show theflaws of mankind, they were still unsettling. Nicci guessed that these had oncebeen actual citizens of Ildakar, petrified in punishment for some perceivedmisdeeds, like the boy yaxen herder. Wizard Commander Maxim considered himselfIldakar’s master sculptor, though he worked with magic and flesh instead ofstone.Bannon was away from the villa, presumably out with his newfound friends, soNicci dined privately with Nathan in his room. Noticeably reticent, the wizardreported his work with Andre. “I believe the fleshmancer may have an answer forme. Today we created a map that showed the lines of my Han, and we could see anobvious flaw. I need to keep working with him to get my gift back.”“That is why we came here, Wizard.” She saw how he brightened when she used thetitle, regardless of whether he could still touch his magic. “But I don’t wantto dally. This city makes me uneasy. Although we must spread the news about LordRahl, I fear the rot in Ildakar goes deep.” In many ways, it reminded her ofAltur’Rang.Nathan licked his fingers after finishing a honeyed pastry for dessert. “Icouldn’t agree more. I’m not certain that Ildakar can be saved by one defiantsorceress and her wizard companion … even if I do get my powers back. We need tobe away from here before they raise their shroud again and seal the city out oftime.”Unsettled and fearing she might eventually have to stand against the wizards ofIldakar, Nicci returned to her quarters to consider her original training—themany skills she learned from the Sisters of the Light, as well as the terribleSubtractive Magic when she became a Sister of the Dark, serving the Keeper.Nicci had an arsenal of spells that surpassed that of most gifted opponents, butthe wizards of Ildakar had already proven their extraordinary abilities. Theyhad turned hundreds of thousands of men to stone and sealed their entire cityaway from time. Even Nicci couldn’t compete with that.Since the star shift, she wasn’t convinced that all of the intricate magic shehad learned—verification webs, spell-forms, actions and consequences andinteractions—would work exactly as it once had. Now alone in her quarters, shestood before the shallow reflecting basin filled with water and studied herintense blue eyes, the blond hair she had brushed back and fastened with ajeweled Ildakaran pin. Her features were lovely.Countless men had looked upon her with lust, and many men had used her. The oneman she loved, though, had never seen her as desirable. Richard Rahl respectedher and appreciated her help. He admired her as a companion, advisor, and one ofhis greatest allies in his quest for peace and freedom throughout the world. ButRichard’s true devotion was reserved for Kahlan.Love was not measured on the simple scale of human beauty, though. No objectivejury could claim that Nicci or Kahlan was more attractive. Both were beautifulwomen, but Kahlan’s beauty was for Richard alone, while Nicci’s was her own.Wrapped in her thoughts, she dipped her fingers into the still basin, shatteringher perfect reflection. She splashed the water on her face.Nicci had long ago lost her chance to have a warm and compassionate human heart,but now she was stronger, with the proper loyalties, devoted to servingRichard’s cause of freedom, even though Nicci wasn’t sure she would ever find—oreven wish to find—real love. Nevertheless, she knew she was more human than shehad ever been.Releasing her gift to snuff out the lights around her room, Nicci lay back onthe silky, cool sheets of the bed and sank into sleep, and peace, and dreams.…For the first time in many days, as her consciousness drifted away, she foundthe spell bond with her sister panther, Mrra. Her mind’s eye became the cat’seyes. Her body became lean and feline, and she felt the power of her muscles,the sharp danger of her claws as she loped across the grassy plain. Mrra hadfound easy hunting in the wild: fat antelopes, jackrabbits, even groundsquirrels. She ate well, but she was restless, waiting for Nicci.Mrra had prowled around the ancient stone soldiers for days. With her enhancedfeline senses, she could detect no threat in the statues of armored men, but herreal attention was directed toward the great city filled with buildings, filledwith people … filled with pain. Mrra could have gone off into the hills longago, but she had remained, connected by her spell bond to Nicci, even though thecity seethed with uneasiness.The sand panther would not leave Nicci—or even the friends Bannon and Nathan,who had shown her kindness. Mrra wanted to protect them all, but she could donothing while they were inside the great city. Nicci suffered repeated memorydreams of Mrra’s captivity, how she had been branded by the chief handler,trained as part of a troka with her two sister panthers, how they had killedopponents in the combat arena … visions that Nicci now recognized with thecrystal-sharp details of her personal experience.Though Nicci felt tense as a guest in Ildakar, she was now free again in herdream, connected to the big cat. Mrra experienced life and saw the world throughher predatory eyes, ignoring external obligations or politics. She simplyexisted. She hunted. She ran. She slept.Connected by the spell bond, Mrra was no longer content with her solitary felineexistence. Nicci was part of her. Now that the link had been reestablished,something reawakened inside the panther’s mind. She ran across the plain as drygrasses whispered past her. Her tawny fur was the same color, and she would havebeen invisible to an observer … until she attacked.Now at night, when her vision was sharpest, Mrra prowled just outside the citywalls, smelling humans, the bitter stink of where they dumped chamber pots overthe tall stone barriers. Garbage middens were scattered along the piled stone.Mrra explored the perimeter of the great city, avoided the towering gates, whichwere closed for the night. She climbed up speckled granite outcroppings, leapedonto a high boulder spattered with lichen that abutted a low section of thedefenses. Decades ago, an acorn had fallen into a crack in the rock, and overthe years a tall oak had grown, reaching higher, splitting the granite furtherwith twisting roots.Using her claws, Mrra scaled the oak, climbing to the uppermost branches. From ahigh, sturdy bough, the cat stared at the impenetrable wall, assessed the top,which was still more than fifteen feet higher than the tree. She coiled hermuscles, judging the distance. She did not think, did not hesitate. Withstrength throbbing in her muscles, she sprang, making a mighty leap through theair.The big cat barely reached the top of the wide wall. She scrabbled with heroutstretched claws, gripping the edge of the last stone block, snagging one ofthe loose vines that grew over the wall. She kicked with her back paws, pullingherself up, thrashing her ropelike tail. With a great heave, Mrra pulled herbody onto the top of the wall. She panted, tongue lolling as she rested for amoment; then she began to move, crouching low. She slunk along the top of thewall until she found a nearby rooftop in the lower level of the city.Springing again, Mrra landed on the enameled tiles. She knocked several tilesloose, which clinked and clattered down in a cascade. Shouts came from insidethe dwelling, but Mrra bounded down into a shadowy alley and darted away beforea man and his wife emerged, holding up a lantern pot. They called out,challenging the intruder. The panther didn’t understand the words, heard onlynoises, human voices. Mrra could smell their fear.She was inside Ildakar now, the hated city, the place of pain. Where her sisterpanther was.Nicci rolled restlessly in her sleep, uneasy, not accustomed to sensing fearfrom the sand panther.Mrra drove away her skittishness and kept moving. She stuck to the shadows.There was much food to eat here, although the hunting would be different.From her trancelike state, Nicci tried to communicate with Mrra. “You must hide!Hide! Find a place before dawn comes.”Mrra kept moving through the lower levels of the city, which were relativelyempty in the deep heart of the night. Guards patrolled the streets, and Mrrasensed armored soldiers in the distance, many of them walking alone, some ingroups of three or four. A few other people were about—night workers who stuckto the main thoroughfares, and some who liked the shadows as much as Mrra did.Human hunters.She heard a muffled shout ahead, a scuffle, a fight. Curious, but wary, Mrrapadded along, darting around the corner of an alley to where she could see anopen street. Three brown-robed humans were attacking one of the lone cityguardsmen.Nicci saw through the panther’s eyes, but also through the filter of Mrra’sexperience. Everything seemed different. The three human figures were attackingthe guard like a troka of panthers bringing down large prey. The guard fought,but the human predators were stronger.Mrra smelled blood.Nicci smelled blood.But it did not make either of them hungry. Instead, the scuffle attractedattention, and Mrra melted back into the darkness, concerned only with finding aplace to hide before the sun rose."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 23 [contents.xhtml#c_ch23]What remained of the Palace of the Prophets—if anything—called to Verna andrepelled her. The entire island had been devastated, the immense structure wipedout after having served the Sisters for three thousand years. But thepossibility of finding some small, valuable remnant had made the prelate embarkon her long journey to Tanimura.Ever since the world changed—along with many of the rules the Sisters of theLight had followed—Verna had been searching for answers, or even the rightquestions. Maybe she would find them here. She reminded herself that she wasstill the prelate, even though she didn’t know exactly what that meant anymore.When she arrived in Tanimura and reported to the garrison, she could have goneimmediately to Halsband Island, to see for herself, but she decided to rest fora day, to reestablish connections with the ten Sisters who had arrived earlier.Certainly they would have already gone to weep at their former home.The soldiers of the D’Haran army were busy constructing barracks for the influxof new arrivals, but General Zimmer had already designated one set of barracksfor the Sisters. Verna appreciated the gesture and accepted her new quarters,but she thought the women might be better off finding someplace in the city. Forthousands of years the Sisters had been well respected in Tanimura, and she wassure someone would remember them fondly.On the other hand, the Sisters of the Dark had wrought great havoc on the city,tearing the harbor apart, wrecking ships. And when Richard had triggered thedestructive light web integrated throughout the palace, that Subtractive Magichad unleashed more devastation than the city had ever seen. The island had beenempty ever since.But maybe something remained. Maybe …General Zimmer had invited her to be his guest at dinner, but she begged off,knowing that Captain Norcross needed to present his full briefing from thePeople’s Palace, to describe the recovery of D’Hara after the end of the recentwar in the Dark Lands. It was a time of healing and expansion, and ofremembering those who had fallen.After reuniting with the ten Sisters, Verna talked with them late into thenight, but the next morning, she woke refreshed and restless. The ruins of thepalace called to her, and she knew she had to go. Since the other Sisters hadalready gone back to the ruins, sometimes alone, sometimes in groups, Vernawanted to explore the rubble on her own, whether or not she found anything.Some of the others tried to discourage her. “We’ve already searched, Prelate,”said Sister Rhoda. “And searched and searched. It will only break your heart.”“Truly, nothing useful remains,” said Sister Eldine, who tied her thick blackhair back in a braid. “It will only remind you of all we have lost.”“My heart is already broken, and perhaps I need to be reminded of what we havelost.” Verna had made up her mind. “Nevertheless, this is something I need todo. I consider it a pilgrimage.”But Novice Amber, Norcross’s fresh-faced sister, was solicitous, wanting tospend time with the prelate, and Verna decided to take only the girl with her.The company might do her good. “Amber and I will explore,” she said. The otherSisters nodded in acceptance, though they clearly doubted the prelate would findsomething they had overlooked.Verna and the young novice left the garrison just after sunrise and made theirway across the city, crossing the wide bridges that spanned the fingers of theKern River as it spilled into the sea. She was too set on her mission to noticethe brightly garbed people in the streets, the yellow D’Haran flags flying withthe stylized-“R” symbol for Lord Rahl.Something about the lovely Amber reminded Verna of her own daughter, Leitis,when she was young. A long, long time ago, the child had been fathered by thewizard Jedidiah … so long ago that Leitis had died of old age by now, andJedidiah was dead from his own treachery. And yet Verna went on. She didn’t knowwho she was anymore. Maybe she would find her answers here.The two women passed a weaver’s street, a warehouse filled with bolts of cloth,from warm wool to dyed cotton, even expensive silk. Amber looked in alldirections, her deep blue eyes wide and excited, but Verna kept moving at abrisk pace. She asked, “Why did you join the Sisters, child?”“Because it is what I aspire to, Prelate.” The girl straightened, recovering herresolve. “I hope that through hard work and dedication I can be worthy of theorder.”“I can already tell that your heart is worthy, but if prophecy is gone and ourteachings are no longer valid, I am not sure what the Sisters can offer you. Ourfocus was so much on prophecy.”They paused at an intersection as a well-dressed man and woman rode by on twohorses. The man touched the brim of his hat and nodded respectfully at Verna,though she didn’t know how he had recognized her.Amber continued, “The Sisters are revered. I’ve dreamed of joining you all mylife, and now that I’m here, Prelate, I don’t want to give up that dream.”“Maybe it’s only a dream,” Verna said.“The Sisters are still real to me,” Amber insisted.Verna smiled at the girl, conceding. “And we are happy to have you.”When they reached the outskirts of the city and the wide stretch of river, Vernacould finally see Halsband Island close at hand across the open water. Her heartsank with dismay as she stared. “I was prepared for this, yet I could never beprepared enough.”The bridges that had connected the island to the mainland were wiped out,vaporized in the detonation of the light web that had brought down the palace.The island itself looked as if some great hand had swept across a tabletop,knocking away all debris and leaving only an empty surface.Now a barren stretch of river flowed past, leaving the island isolated. Thewater, formerly green as it spilled into the ocean, was now clogged with silt. Afew large broken rocks thrust above the waterline, creating hazards. Severalfishermen in flatboats poled around in the shallow river mud.“How will we get across?” Amber asked.Verna picked her way down the slope, pushing low shrubs away so she could reachthe riverbank. “One of those fishermen will take us,” she said with confidence.“I am still the prelate, after all, and I doubt they would deny my request.”On the rocks and sand of the open bank, Verna raised a hand to attract theirattention. Amber waved more vigorously and called out, and one young fishermanpoled his flatboat over, obviously more interested in the beautiful young novicethan in the old prelate. When he brought his boat ashore, Verna could see fourlong catfish lying belly-up at his feet, their heads bashed in but theirwhiskers still extended and twitching.“You must be anxious for a catfish dinner, coming down to get my catch before Ieven row to market,” the young man said brightly. “How can I help you, dearladies?”“It’s not fish we’re interested in, but a ferryman. We’d like to go to theisland. Can you take us?”A troubled cloud crossed the young man’s tanned face. “Nobody goes to theisland.”“Then we shall have it all to ourselves.”Skeptically, he turned to Amber. “Do you really want to go there?”At the bottom of the flatboat, one of the catfish twitched, and the young mansnatched up a cudgel in his left hand and bashed it again with a wet smack.“Yes, we do,” Amber said. “I’m with the prelate. We’d like to see what remainsof the Palace of the Prophets.”“Not much.” He lowered his voice. “I’ve been there myself once, at night. It’s abad place.”“It is a place of great historical significance,” Verna said. “And it is closeto my heart.”“Will you take us?” Amber asked. “Please?”“Of course.”Verna primly sat balanced on the flatboat’s single low bench, and Amber struckup a brief conversation as the young fisherman worked his way across thecurrent, finally reaching the shore of Halsband Island. Verna looked across thebleak, rocky surface, seeing nothing … nothing at all. The young man wasworried. “Do you want me to drop you off at any particular place?”“Dear spirits, it doesn’t seem to make much difference,” Verna said, thensighed. “This is fine, right here.”She kept her balance as she climbed out of the flatboat, while Amber easilysprang onto the shore. “How will we get back?”“I’ll come for you,” the young man volunteered.Amber flashed him a flirtatious smile. “You would have our gratitude, but howwill we contact you?”“Just come back here when you’re ready. I can fish up and down the currentnearby, and I’ll see you. I’ll keep an eye out.”“An acceptable solution,” Verna said, climbing up onto the rocks. Amber followedher, waving a quick good-bye to the young man as he pulled away.Verna set her gaze ahead, trudging forward. Her shoes crunched on the brokenrocks. Tears stung her eyes, and she refused to look at Amber, because thatmight encourage questions from the novice, and Verna didn’t have the heart toanswer questions. She didn’t know if she ever would again.“You are much too young to remember this place. The Palace of the Prophets wasone of the grandest buildings in the Old World, constructed by wizards threethousand years ago, before the great war, before the barriers went up. I camehere much later, as a novice myself, and eventually I took on my duties ofstudying, then training. We helped so many gifted young men. Those who didn’tknow how to cope with their growing magic suffered terrible headaches, and theydied if we didn’t assist them in time.”“Lord Rahl was one of them, wasn’t he?” Amber asked.“Yes, yes he was. I spent decades away from the palace searching for him,knowing that he was out there somewhere.” She touched her graying hair, felt thefine wrinkles on her skin. “I lost so much of my life that way, spent so many ofthe years I was allotted.” She knew that if she had stayed inside the antiagingspell webs of the palace, she would still look young and healthy. “I don’tregret it,” she whispered.“What did you say, Prelate?”Startled, Verna looked around herself, saw only the glassy shingle, theflattened remnants of what had once been such a magnificent building. “Nothing.We should keep searching, see if we can find a way underground. Some catacombsmay have been protected from the blast.” She drew a deep breath. “I know thatanother secret library existed beneath the palace, a central site. Nathan andAnn once told me of its existence, but too late. If Emperor Jagang had gottenhis hands on that knowledge…” She shook her head. “Maybe it was worth thecost—even this cost.” She let out a shuddering sigh.They combed the rubble, walking over low rises, slipping as unstable rocks anddebris tumbled loose, disturbed for the first time in years. Working together,they lifted slabs with surprisingly smooth edges, where the broken stone hadhalf melted. The debris shifted and pattered, dropping into voids beneath thecollapse. Amber slipped, her foot dropping into a gap, but Verna caught her armas the girl let out a gasp. What could have been a broken ankle turned into amere scrape, and Amber brushed herself off in relief.Somehow, miraculously, a small clay figurine of a toad had survived in a tinygap where two large blocks had fallen against each other. The figurine’s eyeswere comically large, its lips smiling, its back glazed green. Verna had neverseen it before. She carefully withdrew the object, held it out under thesunlight.Amber beamed. “It’s adorable! How do you think it survived? A miracle?”“Coincidence, and good positioning,” Verna said.“Is it a powerful talisman of some sort? Do you think Prelate Ann kept it?” Sheleaned closer, but did not take the toad from Verna.“More likely just a keepsake from one of the Sisters.” She rubbed her thumb overthe green-glazed back of the toad. Though the figurine had no real significance,it meant something to her now, because it had survived the destruction of thepalace. As she had survived.They kept walking over the blasted landscape, hoping to find more, but they hadvery little idea where to look. Verna couldn’t even discern the outline of theoriginal towers, the foundations of the main walls. No yawning holes revealedcatacombs beneath, just collapsed gullies of settled rubble. Halsband Island hadbeen flattened. Everything this place had been, all the secrets it had held,were simply crushed in the disintegration.Although Verna had her answer soon after their arrival, they stayed for severalhours. She realized that all the countless books hidden for millennia beneaththe palace were obsolete studies and explanations of a world that was nowirrevocably changed. The pristinely ungifted had departed from the world whenRichard gave them a new universe to occupy, and that had solidified thefoundations of magic, but now the star shift had changed everything again. Whilegifted were still prevalent, many of the magical rules were altered in unknownways, some stronger, some weaker, or perhaps just different and unpredictable.“I fear we’ll have to discover our knowledge all over again,” Verna said.“Everything we knew…”Amber gave a surprising smile. “Then that means the Sisters of the Light have astrong purpose after all, doesn’t it, Prelate?”Verna paused, considering, and felt a weight lift from her chest. The airsmelled a bit fresher as she inhaled. “You may be right, dear girl.”Together, they walked through the rubble and back to the shore, where the youngman was not far away in his flatboat. “Tonight we will all have catfish fordinner,” Verna said."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 24 [contents.xhtml#c_ch24]High Captain Avery looked shaken as he sought out Sovrena Thora the followingmorning, marching like an executioner’s apprentice into the main chamber of theruling tower.Nicci had decided to watch the wizards’ aloof political discussions while shewaited for Nathan to finish his consultations with Andre. She felt she mightfind an opportunity to comment on ways they could better serve their own people,though she doubted they would listen. The ruling council seemed to have no realbusiness to conduct, and their conversation served little purpose. Among theduma members, only Renn and Quentin were in attendance this time, apparentlybecause they had nothing else to do in the city; the seats reserved for Andre,Ivan, Elsa, and Damon remained empty.The sovrena sat in her ruling chair, bored, tapping laquered fingernails on thecarved wooden arm. Maxim sat watching a large fly buzz in the air around him; hetraced its path with his finger, and then, with a quick grin, he released hisgift, and the fly turned to stone, dropping like a small pebble to clink on theblue marble floor. No one paid attention to Nicci.Then Avery and another guard rushed in with a clatter of metal-shod boots, thelapped scales of fine armor jingling on their chests. Their faces were ashen.Avery placed a fist against his heart and took a knee on the blue marble tilesbefore the two rulers. “Sovrena, Wizard Commander! There has been a murder.”Nicci became instantly alert, her blue eyes intense. Renn and Quentin sat up,forgetting their aimless discussion about repairs needed in the city’s largesttannery, or the choice of color for roof tiles on one of the silkwormhatcheries.“A murder?” Maxim sounded intrigued rather than horrified. “Tell us.”Avery regained his feet and looked at Thora rather than the wizard commander.“One of my guards on evening patrol last night was assaulted in a midlevelsquare, the one with the fountain of the dancing fishes.”“That’s a nice fountain,” Maxim said.“Silence, husband!” Thora snapped. “How was he killed?”“Butchered,” said Avery.The second guard said in a quavering voice, “Blood everywhere. Lieutenant Kerrywas stabbed multiple times. His throat was cut and…” He couldn’t seem to findthe words.Avery answered for him. “The wounds were made with jagged glass shards.”“How do you know this?” Thora asked. “Cuts could have been made with knives.”“Because when they were done, the assassins thrust the shards into Kerry’s eyesand left them there.” Avery nodded to the sickened-looking guard next to him.“Captain Trevor here found the body.”“It was full daylight by the time anyone sent word,” Trevor said. He had a roundface, and his pale skin flushed easily. He removed his helmet so that his lightbrown hair stuck out. “The dead body had been there for hours. Even thoughpeople were up and about, no one reported it. Someone should have seen him.There were people—craftsmen, merchants, slaves—going about their morningbusiness. And Kerry was just there, dead in the fountain … blood all over theplace.” He swallowed hard. “And those glass shards in his eyes.”“Now we’ll have to drain and clean the fountain,” Maxim said. “I liked thedancing fish, one of our best sculptures.”“Mirrormask did it,” Renn grumbled from the lower bench, running a fingerbetween his second and third chins. “He and his wretched followers grow morebold every day.”“Agreed,” said Sovrena Thora. Her face had gone pale with fury. “We must crushthem.”Nicci knew that Ildakar’s oppressive rulers only inspired such unrest. InAltur’Rang and in other cities in the south, the people had had enough of theunfair Imperial Order, and they had eventually torn it down, violently. Shespoke up, “If the duma members offered equality and freedom, then the peoplewould have no need for a Mirrormask.” She knew these wizards would be deaf tosuch reasoning. They were as fossilized in their ways as if one of Maxim’spetrification spells had backfired into their open minds.Thora shot her an annoyed glare. “The wizards of Ildakar must stand firm. Thecity has many gifted, but we are the strongest. We have to marshal ourresources.” She swung her sea-green gaze toward Nicci. “Since you are so eagerto help, Sorceress, we need to understand what we have to work with. Until Andremanages to restore Nathan Rahl’s gift, we should find out how you can help us.”“I’m not afraid to fight for a just cause,” Nicci said. “But it depends who thetrue enemy is.”Quentin made a rude noise through his plump lips. “The enemy is obvious. Thosebutchers murdered an innocent guard. They thrust glass shards in his eyes.”“People express their displeasure in different ways,” Nicci said.She thought of the horrific tortures Emperor Jagang had inflicted on hiscaptives, his servants, or his lovers if they displeased him. She remembered onebalding servant with a fringe of dark hair. The poor man had stumbled whilecarrying a decanter of Jagang’s favorite wine. He slipped in a pool of bloodseeping from the body of a scrawny young woman Jagang had just murdered bybashing her head against the stone corner of a table. Nicci—Death’s Mistress—hadwatched it all, immune to Jagang’s violent tendencies. He had often taken outhis anger on her.The young girl had had such a beautiful face, but when he tore her gown open torape her, he discovered large dark moles on her breasts, and in disgust, he hadkilled her. The girl’s death had been swift, a response to his rage anddispleasure.But moments later, when the unfortunate servant slipped in her blood and spilledthe wine, Jagang took more time meting out his punishment. He staked the man onthe trampled grass outside his command tent. He had one of his surgeons slitopen the man’s belly, careful not to kill him; then he had poured a basket ofravenous rats into his abdominal cavity and sewed it shut again. He left enoughgaps to provide air so the rats wouldn’t suffocate, giving them time to devourall of the hapless servant’s entrails before burrowing their way up to his heartand lungs.No, she couldn’t be overly horrified by glass shards in a dead man’s eyes.“Mirrormask points out flaws in your society,” Nicci said. “The murder of theguard, and the glass shards in his eyes, were to make a point. Maybe if youbothered to hear why your people are dissatisfied, you could prevent furthermurders.”“We’ll prevent the murders once we catch Mirrormask,” Maxim said, then loweredhis voice. “If that’s even possible.”Thora rose from her chair and left the dais. “Come with me to my sunroom, Nicci.We will discuss your abilities.”“On the condition that I learn about your abilities as well,” Nicci said, seeingthe opportunity. “The wizards of Ildakar use the gift differently from how I wastrained.”Maxim bounced up from his high seat and hurried to tag along. “I’ll join you.”Thora’s face puckered. “And what do you add to the conversation?”“I can offer my charming company.” He waved his hands. “High Captain Avery, goclean up the mess down by the pretty fountain. Send your men to see if you cancapture those murderers, though I doubt you’ll have more luck than with the pastthree murders.”“There have been three murders?” Nicci asked.The wizard commander shrugged. “It’s a large city.”* * *The sovrena’s airy sunroom had walls decorated with frescoes of flowers, trees,waterfalls, and peaceful meadows in which cavorted numerous naked andwell-endowed men and women.Thora took a moment to tend her cages of larks, nearly two dozen birds crowdedbehind the fine gold wire. “Their music is perfect and precious. I draw peacejust from watching them. My pets please me, but most of all, they know theirplace.” She turned a quick sidelong glance at Nicci. “They live their lives inthese cages. They perform well, and they have no further aspirations.”“How do you know what a songbird thinks?” Nicci asked.“I can tell from their music. If they were not happy, they wouldn’t keepsinging.”Jagang had enjoyed the screams of his torture victims. “Perhaps they merely cryout in misery,” she suggested. “And you hear it as music.”The sovrena scowled. “You are our guest, yet you persist in criticizing ourways.”“I am here out of duty to my friend Nathan. We will leave as soon as thefleshmancer restores his gift.”Maxim came into the room a moment later, followed by servants carrying lunch: afresh baked fish stuffed with herbs and covered with a buttery sauce,accompanied by baskets of warm pastries and a bottle of bloodwine. The wizardcommander served himself first, scooping out the flaky meat from the fish,careful to pick away the bones. He sat by himself eating. “Before long, we willraise the shroud again. You don’t wish to stay with us?”“We will be gone by then,” Nicci said. The wizard commander made a tsking soundof disappointment.Thora said, “When our city is safely hidden again, our customs won’t bother yoursensibilities anymore.” She took a delicate bite of fish. “For now, we have tofight against heinous rebels. You said you are able to use wizard’s fire? Thatis not common for a sorceress. What other spells can you unleash?”“I can unleash whatever magic is warranted in a situation,” Nicci said. “Iacquired many abilities from a wizard I killed, and I also studied among theSisters of the Light and the Sisters of the Dark.”“Ah, so Subtractive Magic then,” Maxim said. “Most unusual.”“You served the Keeper, and you complain of our ways?” Thora scoffed.“I was in error. I now serve Lord Rahl and his new golden age, a world in whichall people can choose their own fate and live their own lives.”“Quaint, and impractical.” Carrying her plate, Thora tapped the gold wire cages,and the startled larks sang with great intensity. “Perhaps you’re right. Maybethey sing because they are frightened, but it still sounds like beautiful musicto me.”Nicci served herself fish and fresh bread, and Maxim poured them each a gobletof the deep red bloodwine. He took a long drink of his. “Where else did youlearn your magic? Other teachers? Other archives?”“I learned from my life experience—and I have had much experience. With each newchallenge, I strengthened my abilities and found new techniques. When I fight adangerous opponent, I choose my weapons carefully.” Her voice became quiet andhusky as she thought of poor Thistle and the deadly arrow poisoned with herheart’s blood. “Sometimes those weapons are terrible.”Maxim interjected, “Your companion Bannon mentioned something about a greatlibrary. An archive of magical lore. Is that true?”“He called it Cliffwall,” Thora said, “an immense archive that was hidden at thetime of the great wars.”Nicci was instantly wary. “Bannon spoke of this?”“He told our son,” Maxim said. “It sounds wonderful! We shall have toinvestigate.” He raised his voice for any servant within earshot. “Someone, sendRenn! I need him here now. Tell him the wizard commander requests it.”Nicci heard a bustle of footsteps in the hall as a servant ran down thecorridor. “Why do you need Renn?” she asked.“Of all the duma members, he is our most diligent scholar. And the least useful.I’m certain he will be fascinated to hear about Cliffwall. You must tell him howto find it.”Nicci hesitated. “It was hidden for a reason.”“Yes, in the winding canyons on the other side of Kol Adair. We know that much,”Maxim said. “Surely it can’t be too hard to find.”Thora searched among the rolls, but did not find one she liked. “Our historiesremember when the ancient wizards secretly tried to preserve the world’sknowledge before Emperor Sulachan could destroy it all. Cliffwall was thought tobe lost.”Maxim said, “We’d better find it again and discover what other interesting lorethey preserved.”Nicci stiffened. “The information in Cliffwall is dangerous. Because theuntrained scholars there didn’t know what they were doing, they almost destroyedthe world. Twice, in fact.”“All the more reason for us to send our expertise.” Maxim smiled just as thewizard Renn bustled in, swirling his maroon robes. He walked with a waddlinggait, not because he was overly fat, but because his legs were so short.Thora looked at Maxim, kept her expression cool. “It is a rare occurrence, but Iagree with my husband.” She looked at the befuddled wizard. “Renn, we have amission for you. There is a great archive called Cliffwall, a reservoir ofpreserved magical knowledge. Put together a party and go find it for us. Nicciwill give you the information you need.”Nicci placed her hands at her side. “You’ll never find it. It remained hiddenfor millennia.”“You said yourself that its camouflage shroud is down. I’m sure Renn candiscover Cliffwall.” Maxim pointed to Renn. “It’s on the other side of KolAdair. Cross over the mountains, find the desert canyons. It can’t bedifficult.”Renn’s mouth opened and closed in astonishment as the wizard was caught betweenfascination and fear. “I would like nothing more than to find a new archive ofinformation. Over the past fifteen centuries, I’ve read every book in the cityof Ildakar. But if the archive is outside and … far away…” He smacked his lipstogether. “Well, the journey may be dangerous.”“Then take an escort. A dozen armed guards.” Maxim sniffed. “In fact, why don’tyou take that guard we met earlier, Captain … what was his name? Ahh,yes—Trevor.”“He seemed useless here,” Thora added. “Too sickened by the sight of blood. Havehim lead the group.”“I do not think this is wise,” Nicci warned in a louder voice.Thora scowled at her again. “You disapprove of much that we do, and yet Ildakarendures. I am the sovrena, and I make the decisions.” She gestured to dismissRenn. “That is my command, and that is your duty as a member of the duma. Gofind Cliffwall and see what we can use. It belongs to us anyway.” She squaredher narrow shoulders, then nodded. “Much of that lore was taken from Ildakarthree thousand years ago. It is time we had it back.”“But … Sovrena,” Renn said, fluttering his fingers in the air. He brushed sweatfrom his forehead, then wiped it on his robes. “You are about to raise theshroud again. What if you restore it permanently while I am away?”Maxim finished his bloodwine. “Then we will be very disappointed that youhaven’t brought the Cliffwall records back in time.” He poured another goblet ofbloodwine for himself, topped off Thora’s, then frowned when he saw that Niccihadn’t taken so much as a sip. He waved his hand. “Go, Renn—you had betterhurry!”The wizard scurried off."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 25 [contents.xhtml#c_ch25]Sickened by what had happened to Ian, Bannon no longer noticed any of thewonders of Ildakar. He spent the day alone, trying to figure out what he coulddo to help his friend.His mind churned in a slow whirlpool of regrets and fond memories. He and Ianused to pluck wriggling green caterpillars from the cabbage plants and placethem in a jar. They would feed them torn cabbage leaves until the worms shedtheir skin and hung in a chrysalis on the side of the jar before emerging as thecommon white butterflies that fluttered through the fields. Now Bannon’s lipscurved in a wan smile as he thought of how he and Ian would chase the newbornbutterflies down the rows of green cabbage plants.Some days, he and Ian used to toss cabbage heads back and forth as makeshiftballs. Bored boys could always find things to amuse them, such as going down totheir special isolated cove to play in the tide pools.…Then, like a pane of glass shattering, Bannon could only think of the despairinglook on Ian’s face as Norukai slavers clubbed him and dragged him to thelongboat while Bannon fled. He could not imagine the pain and suffering Ian hadendured in the years since. The poor boy must have been beaten, abused. Bannonremembered seeing the patterns of scars all over his friend’s skin down in thetraining pits. How many cuts and bruises had he suffered? Broken bones,concussions, injuries that weren’t readily visible?A subconscious groan came from deep in his throat. Bannon had begged forgivenessfrom his friend, but he knew he didn’t deserve it. That one second ofhesitation, that one betrayal, had cost him so much in his heart.And it had cost Ian everything.But what circumstances had brought the young man here? What sort of windingobstacle course of events could have taken a Norukai captive from Chiriya Islandto here in the fabled ancient city, where he fought in their combat arena? How?Sweet Sea Mother, how … and why?I should have been there. I should never have left him. They captured me first.Now, so long after the fact and feeling the sharp pain inside, Bannon wished thecircumstances had been reversed, that he’d been the one captured after all, thatIan had gotten away to live with his loving family, his mother and father, hislittle sister Irene.After Bannon ran back to the island village, sounding the alarm and wailing forhelp, it had been far too late. Ian’s family had been destroyed by the loss oftheir son, and Bannon’s father had cuffed him for being such a coward. Bannonendured the abuse, because that time he knew he deserved it.Since his own life had already been filled with so much pain from his drunkenfather, maybe he should have made the sacrifice, let his friend escape instead.That way, Ian could have grown up in a happy home, married a beautiful islandgirl, maybe even occasionally raised a toast to his lost friend, Bannon.But instead, Bannon had stayed behind and suffered more years of being beaten byhis father, before trying to save those poor kittens from drowning … and indoing so, leaving his dear mother vulnerable to that abusive man. Bannon hadfailed on both fronts.And he had failed Ian, too.…On top of the plateau, the day was warm and the sun bright. Bannon wandered thestreets, deep in thought and already perspiring, and when he finally made hisway back to the grand villa, he found Amos, Jed, and Brock lounging about,distracted.“Our friend Bannon looks glum,” Amos said, “and we don’t have anything to do.Let’s cheer him up.”“How are we going to do that?” Jed asked.Brock chuckled. “Take him back to the silk yaxen, even if he doesn’t want topartake.”“He could watch me and Melody,” Amos said. “I promise I won’t make her sing thistime.”Flushing, Bannon shook his head. “I’m fine. I’ll just go back to my room.”“No, you won’t,” Amos said. “Stick with us, and we’ll take care of you.”Bannon steeled himself, forced an optimistic expression onto his face. “There issomething you can do.…” He drew a breath, and nervously stroked his long reddishhair. “I have a favor to request.”“A favor?” Amos asked. “Have you earned it?”Bannon furrowed his brow. “I was always taught a favor is something you ask, notearn.”“Maybe we’re taught differently in Ildakar,” Brock said.He began, “Yesterday, I went down to the training pits near the combat arena.”The three young men laughed. “Adessa might tumble with you, but that’s anotherthing you’d need to earn, Bannon. You’d have to demonstrate your prowess as afighter before any of the morazeth take you seriously.”“No, i-it’s not that,” he stammered, looking for words. “Sweet Sea Mother…” Heshook his head. “I need you to help me free my friend Ian. The champion. Youhave money and connections. The arena masters would listen to you.”“The champion?” Brock asked. “I doubt that.”Amos appeared to consider the idea. “We might be able to do it. Just give ustime. We’ll talk about it later.”Bannon couldn’t tell if the other young man took the request seriously, or if itwas a joke. Maybe they were stringing him along, but what other choice did hehave? “Later? How much time? If you could just come with me to see him…”“Tomorrow,” Amos said. “Too much to do today.”“I thought you said you didn’t have anything to do.”“Keeper’s crotch, we haven’t shown you the river and the bluffs, one of the mostamazing parts of Ildakar. You deserve to see it, and there’s no better way thanif we show you. We can tell you the history.”Jed leaned against a marble column while Amos swung himself to his feet,stomping his boots on the fine white gravel. Brock straightened his spottedcape, threw back his shoulders, and rotated his arms, as if to limber up for afight.Amos said, “From the top of the cliffs, you can watch the boats and the cargocome up the river.” He cocked an eyebrow at Bannon. “From there, even you canfeel like a lord.”“Never wanted to be a lord,” Bannon said. “I’m just a cabbage farmer at heart,but an adventurer too. I wanted to see the world.” He patted the pommel ofSturdy. “And Ian was taken away—”Amos and his companions clearly didn’t want to hear about it. The young menmoved off with long bouncing strides, and Bannon followed them down from the topof the plateau and along a curving thoroughfare that took them around the uplifttoward the river-facing side.They passed a grocer toiling uphill with a cart filled with limes, lemons, andbunches of dark grapes. Carpenters carried their tools over their shoulders asthey walked to work sites, because Ildakar was always being cleaned, maintained,and built higher. One gifted noblewoman, her long gown made of rose-coloredsilk, strolled along while a slave walked a plump orange tabby cat on a leash.They passed fountains, where common workers and slaves drew water, washedthemselves, and carried jugs back to their homes. Narrow tiled channels drew thewater through all parts of the city, and aqueducts ran beneath the streets.When Amos led them to the precipitous drop-off to the Killraven River, Bannon’sstomach grew fluttery as he looked down. The bluff was sheer, the sandstonegnarled and pockmarked. Some agile and daring climber might be able to scalethat dangerous cliff, but any slip would mean certain death.Amos stood beside him, gesturing to the sheer drop-off. “See what the wizards ofIldakar can do? This was a city right on the edge of the river, on the bank. TheKillraven carved out this great valley, with a plain extending in alldirections, but access from the river made us much too tempting a target, muchtoo weak.”“We were never weak,” Jed said.Amos frowned at him for the interruption. “The vulnerability was enough toattract invaders like maggots to a corpse.” He swept his hands out to eitherside. “So our wizards pulled on the land, uprooted this side of the plain, andlifted it up to create this high, defensible bluff. The wizards intentionallyleft a single protected port down below, where riverboats could dock. Largevessels also come in from the distant bay far downstream, where the Killravendrains into the sea.”Far below, Bannon saw a complex network of docks and piers that jutted out fromthe sandstone at the level of the river. There were small boats, fishermen, mudtrollers, shell harvesters, reed gatherers.“How do they get anything into the city from way down there?” Bannon asked. Helooked at two flat barges loaded with barrels from other villages upriver.“Look closer,” Amos said.Bannon leaned over and saw a line of notches in the bluff face that zigzaggeddizzyingly up one level, then the next. He remembered climbing the canyon wallsto reach the great library buildings in Cliffwall, but this looked far moretreacherous. “How could anyone do that carrying loads of cargo?”“We don’t want to make it easy to get from the river up to the city. That’s thewhole point, isn’t it?” Amos’s voice was sharp. “Watch how the slaves do theirwork.”Near one of the wooden docks, a fisherman had loaded baskets of fresh catch on awooden platform connected to ropes that extended up to cantilever arms, pulleys,and counterweights. Another trader had brought in cut stone from a quarry on theother side of the river. When they loaded their goods on the platform, workersat the midlevels of the bluffs turned large interconnected wheels to tighten theropes and ratchet the platforms up.“People must ascend the stairs,” said Amos, “but the merchandise can be liftedvery conveniently.”“Convenient, so long as we have enough slaves,” Jed said. Bannon wondered whythey couldn’t just do it with their powerful magic.Far below, the river flowed against the unlikely cliffside, curling green andwhite. “The ancient wizards even changed the current, brought the Killravencloser, then spread it out down there to the south, making the land beyond thebluffs a large impassable swamp, which discouraged overland travel. The marshesare a labyrinth of twisted trees and mud pits.” Amos’s lips quirked in a hungrysmile. “And our fleshmancers twisted some of the native creatures to createhorrific monsters, serpents, and lizard dragons that now infest the swamps. Noone can get through from that direction.”“But General Utros came from over the mountains and across the plain,” Bannonsaid. “They would have battered down your walls, torn open your gates, andconquered your city.”Jed and Brock looked at each other, their expressions troubled. Amos justsniffed. “That’s why we had to turn them all to stone. Utros failed, EmperorKurgan’s reign collapsed … and Ildakar is still here, as powerful as ever.”At the edge of the cliff several streets away, an ornamental tower stood highand thin, with observation windows around the top. Bannon saw two figures insidethe tower, looking toward the river and waving, shouting. The lookouts switchedthe banners flying from the top of the tower, removing one that showed thecity’s sun-and-lightning-bolt symbol and replacing it with a blue triangularcloth that flapped in the wind. As other Ildakarans noticed the change and heardthe shouts, they picked up the call.“What is it?” Bannon said. “Have they seen something?”Amos, Jed, and Brock all peered downstream. “Look! The boats are coming at agood pace.”Bannon spotted two large, low boats straining against the current. Each had onesquare midnight-blue sail stretched tight. His blood ran cold.“They must have used a lot of blood to summon a breeze like that,” Amos said,his voice critical. “Must be in a hurry to dock.”“They’ve seen Ildakar, so they know the shroud is down,” Jed said. “They want toconduct their business before it’s too late.”The two ships moved rapidly closer. Even though they pushed against the current,they seemed to be guided by a determined magic. Bannon’s stomach curdled. He sawthe wide beam and the low lapped hulls; he knew that each prow would bear amonstrous carved serpent.“Those are Norukai ships,” he whispered. “Are they coming to attack Ildakar?” Hehoped he would watch them be destroyed by whatever magical storm the wizardswould rain down upon them. He squeezed his sweaty hand around his sword’s hilt.He would fight them himself if need be.Amos chuckled. “Of course not, you fool! The Norukai are our best tradingpartners. I wager those two ships are bringing another hundred, maybe twohundred captives.”“We could use some fresh blood,” Brock said. “The slave market will be busytomorrow.”“Slaves?” Bannon asked. “They’re raiders! The Norukai capture innocent people invillages.” Like Ian.“They bring slaves, which we buy,” Amos said, giving him a strange look. “Wehave to replenish our ranks. A lot of slaves run away thanks to Mirrormask, andwho knows how much blood magic will be required to raise the shroud again?”Thinking of the torment his friend must have endured, all those scars, all thatpain, Bannon saw a black haze of anger form at the edges of his vision. He wasdeaf to the excitement as the people of Ildakar went to greet the raider shipsthat docked against the bluffs below the city."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 26 [contents.xhtml#c_ch26]A day after arriving in Serrimundi, Oliver and Peretta bade a tearful farewellto the fisherman Kenneth, who had brought them all the way up the coast fromRenda Bay. The bearded man had enjoyed the long journey, but he was anxious toget back aboard the Daisy and head home.He squeezed Oliver’s narrow shoulders so hard that the young scholar felt two ofhis vertebrae pop. Kenneth gave Peretta an equally enthusiastic, but gentler,hug. “Don’t worry, girl, you look like you break easily. I’ll be careful.”She frowned at the comment. “I can endure anything that Oliver can.”“And you have,” Oliver said. “We make a good team, Peretta. We’ve gone thisfar.”Peretta touched her temple, closed her eyes. “I’ve stored all the impressionsand details in my thoughts.”“Since I’m not a memmer, I wrote down careful notes in my journal,” Oliver said.“That way others can read about our journey.”Peretta gave him a consoling look, as if he had confessed a weakness.“Even without you two aboard the Daisy to help,” Kenneth said, “I’ll have a nicevoyage back south. I always preferred my solitude.” He looked up at the creamywhite buildings of Serrimundi surrounded by tall cedars that stood like darkgreen spearheads lining the boulevards and covering the hills. “No one fromRenda Bay has ever ventured this far, but now that I’ve done it, there’ll beothers. It may be worth the trip now and then.”While he was in the large port, Kenneth had loaded his fishing boat withweapons—swords and shields, axes, maces and hammers—manufactured by the renownedweaponsmiths of Serrimundi. “We have fletchers and bow makers back home, butit’s hard to get good steel for swords. These will do nicely.” He spoke in aconspiratorial fashion as he stood with one boot on the side of his boat and theother on the dock. He swayed to keep his balance. “I even purchased plans forsiege towers and defensible walls. There might be some good ideas we can use todefend Renda Bay. We intend to be ready next time the Norukai come … and theywill come.”“Best of luck to you,” Peretta said.“Someone in Serrimundi will take us the rest of the way up to the New World,”Oliver said. “We’ll be all right from here.”Kenneth unlashed the ropes and cast off with a shove from his boot. He set sailand drifted out of the bustling harbor. Oliver and Peretta watched him head backtoward the towering statue of the Sea Mother, who seemed to emerge from the highcliffs at the mouth of the harbor.“Will we be?” Peretta asked.Oliver blinked. “What do you mean?”“Will we be all right?”He touched her shoulder. “We’ve been just fine so far, you and I.” He knew hewas no manly warrior who could lead troops, nor a scout who could guide themacross uncharted terrain, but their skills were roughly equal. “Between the twoof us, we’ll be fine. You help me as much as I help you. Haven’t you memorized agreat deal of information about where we’re going?”“Not really.” She sounded shy. “But I do know about trade routes. Maybe I candraw on that knowledge to find someone who will take us to Tanimura, and fromthere to Lord Rahl.” She closed her eyes and concentrated, sorting the knowledgein her head, while Oliver scanned the other boats in the harbor. Finally, theyleft the docks and went together into the city.Serrimundi was built around the delta of a river that emptied into the sea withmany branches that flowed through the city. The people had tamed the arms of thedelta into well-behaved canals. Gondola pilots moved small boats up and down thewatery alleys, delivering people to small household docks.The city was filled with busy people wearing colorful garments. Oliver andPeretta listened to the cacophony of voices, music played by sailors fromdistant lands, the rattle and creak of ropes in pulleys, the sway of woodencrates, the slosh of waves against hulls, and the calls of wine sellers, shellmerchants, or corner-stall prophets who claimed to tell fortunes.Peretta’s dark eyes sparkled with an idea. “We should report to the harborlord.That is a man of power here in Serrimundi.”Oliver patted the documents he kept in a pouch at his waist. “Yes, and we havenews for him … about the Wavewalker.”* * *Oliver and Peretta sat in the second-story office of the harborlord, aflat-faced man named Otto with a sincere expression, caramel-colored eyes, andcurled locks of dark hair that dropped past his shoulders. He wore awide-brimmed leather hat even inside his office. The windows stood wide open,and shrieking gulls outside interrupted their conversation. Brisk, salty breezesstirred the papers on the harborlord’s desk.Oliver removed his pouch and set the journals and documents in front of him,keeping his hand on top of them. He hesitated, knowing he was about to give Ottodifficult news.A woman came in carrying a tray of fruit juices and a plate of small, roundcookies that sparkled with cane sugar. Harborlord Otto looked up and smiled.“Ah, my daughter Shira. She should actually be home tending her children, butshe loves working in the office. She is, in fact, my business partner.”The woman looked at them, tossed her hair. “My own husband is out to sea and thechildren can take care of themselves.” Shira had long reddish-brown hair combedto a glossy sheen. She had the widening hips of a woman who had borne severalchildren and lived a hard domestic life, but she was still beautiful.Oliver spoke up as Shira approached with the tray of refreshments. “We have newsfrom travelers who came inland, three people—a sorceress, a wizard, and a youngswordsman. They were aboard a ship named the Wavewalker.”Shira froze, holding the tray.Oliver didn’t notice her sudden intense silence. “Sir, I am sorry to report thatthe Wavewalker was shipwrecked, attacked by selka down along the Phantom Coast.As harborlord, you need to know. All hands were lost, except for the three Imentioned.”With a loud crash and a clatter, Shira dropped the tray of juice and cookies.She stood trembling as if someone had struck her a physical blow; then she spunaway, weeping. “I must see the Sea Mother. I must pray.…” She reached the doorand stopped, gripping the jamb so hard that her knuckles turned white. Her nailsdug into the wood. She heaved several breaths, and finally turned back. Tearsstreaked her cheeks. “I must pray for guidance on how to tell my children thattheir father is lost at sea.” Then she fled the office.Otto looked dour and grim. His shoulders lifted, then fell as he let out a sighthat sounded like the wind of an oncoming storm. “Captain Corwin was a decentman, an adequate husband and father. Any wife of a sea captain knows she’s boundto receive news like this sooner or later. The Wavewalker was gone for much ofthe year, but the captain fulfilled his contract. He made sure that my daughterand their children had food, had a home.”Moving with painful slowness as if he couldn’t face what he was doing, theharborlord opened a desk drawer and withdrew a sheaf of handwritten papers thathad turned brown with age, some so old the purple ink was faded. Finally, hepulled out a document, the old marriage certificate. He shook his head. “Shirais the daughter of the harborlord. She and her children will be fine. I willfind some other sea captain for her, a marriage under the same terms.”Oliver found that heartachingly sad. From the tales that Nicci, Bannon, andNathan had told, Captain Eli Corwin had been a good man who fought hard for hisship. Oliver hadn’t known about his family.Harborlord Otto looked across the desk at them. “Thank you for this news. I meanthat sincerely.”Peretta seemed lost. “But we just told you the ship sank, the man is dead. Whywould you thank us?”“The agony of worry is often worse than the dull ache of grief. Better to knowfor certain, than to spend month after month in empty hope. Each day Shira wouldcome down to check the newly arrived vessels, asking if anyone might havebrought news of the Wavewalker. Now she knows.” He sighed. “We’ll make manyofferings to the temple of the Sea Mother … and I will inform the wishpearldivers as well. Their training master sent his best five aboard the Wavewalkerfor an extravagant fee, which Captain Corwin was willing to pay. I believe thetraining master had hoped to send others on later voyages. Now they’ll just haveto find a different vessel and a new ambitious captain.”He spread more documents on his desk, securing them with heavy lumps of driedcoral so the sea breezes would not blow them away.“We were hoping our news might be worth something to you,” Peretta said, “for weare on a mission of our own. Serrimundi is now part of the D’Haran Empire. LordRahl has brought freedom to all the cities of the Old World.”Otto drew his eyebrows together and straightened his hat. “I’ve heard a story ortwo, but there’s been no change in our daily lives. If Lord Rahl thinks he’s ournew ruler, I suppose he’ll send people down to impose taxes.”“From what we understand,” Oliver said, “Lord Rahl is most interested inguaranteeing rather than imposing a way of life.”The harborlord grimaced. “You mean, like the Imperial Order? Serrimundi had topay lip service to Emperor Jagang, as well as a substantial tithe, just so hewould leave us alone. Since Serrimundi caused him no trouble, he directed hisarmies elsewhere.” Otto suddenly sat up. “In fact, I believe he sent all of hisarmies northward to fight some upstart leader named Richard Rahl. Hmmm…”“Yes, that was it,” Oliver said. “But Lord Rahl doesn’t mean to enforce harshrules like the Imperial Order. He wants all cities and lands to espouse freedom,to let people choose their own destinies, to create their own self-worth, and todepose tyrants. In order to be part of the D’Haran Empire, all lands must simplyabide by a set of established rules based on human decency.”At least, that was what Nicci and Nathan had said.Otto set another lump of coral on the remaining stack of papers, which he hadnot yet read. “Then Serrimundi will get along just fine with the new situation.But what is it you need?”“We need passage north,” said Peretta. “We come from Cliffwall, far inland. Wehave already been traveling for a month, but we must make our way to the NewWorld and eventually find someone who can deliver our reports to Lord Rahl. Ican recite them, if I meet him face-to-face.”“And I have them written down.” Oliver gathered up his documents, stuffing themback in the leather pouch.“We have ships sailing from Serrimundi up the coast, and many go as far asTanimura.”“We don’t require anything fancy,” Oliver said, then lowered his voice. “Becausewe can’t really pay.”“In that case, I have something just for you. My brother Jared runs akraken-hunting ship, and he’s about to set sail tomorrow. He lost some of hiscrew in an … unfortunate incident on his last run, but he intends to work thewaters north of here. If you’re willing to lend a hand, and a kraken-huntingship doesn’t bother you, I’ll have a berth for you right away.”“We don’t know what a kraken hunter is,” Oliver said.“All the better. I will make the arrangements.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 27 [contents.xhtml#c_ch27]Seeing the tension in Nicci’s demeanor as they stood together in the slavemarket, Nathan said, “The legends of Ildakar are better than the reality. Thisbothers you, Sorceress, and I understand why.”“Slavery bothers me, in all forms,” she said. “I used to be called the SlaveQueen myself, but Richard changed me.”Bright colors, sweet-smelling flowers, and excited chatter could not hide thefact that this was a grim and dark place. Anger knotted inside Nicci as shewatched. “Pretty blooms growing in a pile of manure cannot mask the stench.”The slave market was an open plaza with perfectly fitted flagstones and tallwhite buildings on all sides of the square. They passed a new white statue—thedefiant young yaxen herder, recently petrified. Most pedestrians paid noattention to the statue, but some did, knowing exactly what it meant. Nicci sawtiny glints of broken mirrors around its base, shards that the street crews hadnot yet cleaned up.People flowed in from side streets and main thoroughfares, eager to see what theNorukai ships had brought. Well-dressed merchants and tradesmen were followed byslave workers in drab tunics and plain sandals. Gifted nobles seemed excessivelyproud of their silks and furs, their golden necklaces, jeweled amulets, andcloak clasps.Like flowers blooming after a sudden rain in the desert, wine-merchant stallssprang up. Carts arrived with bottles of bloodwine and a panoply of clay,pewter, or crystal goblets. Food vendors hurried in to claim a good place justoutside the square. Small charcoal braziers roasted sizzling meat, and thevendors bellowed over one another, boasting about their merchandise. Sullenslaves carried bolts of cloth for tailors ready to sell new garments for anyonewho purchased the day’s slaves and needed them dressed appropriately.In the center of the slave market, a raised rectangular platform stood empty,ready to hold at least a hundred people. A wooden arbor towered over theplatform, draped with dark green vines that curled around the support beams, asif the plants meant to strangle the wood. From the trellis slats overheaddrooped lush sweet-smelling flowers, crimson wisterias that looked like gouts ofgushing blood.A flustered-looking wizard Renn wiped his brow, then adjusted his maroon robesas he hurried past. “I need another dozen slaves, but I’ll be gone across thewilderness searching for Cliffwall.” He shook his head. “Keeper’s beard, this isterrible timing for me!” Looking harried, he skewered Nicci and Nathan with agaze. “You kept detailed accounts of your journeys. Tell me how to find thisgreat archive, so my trip can be swift and efficient.”Nathan quickly covered his troubled look, and Nicci gave a cool answer. “As Itold the sovrena, we must respect their wish to remain isolated.”Renn pushed out his lower lip, annoyed. “I expected more cooperation from you. Iwill just head west over the mountains and search in the canyons. With my gift,I’m sure I can’t miss it.” He let out a long sigh, looking around the slavemarket. “For now, this is a lost opportunity.”With a snort, Quentin waggled his hands. His cloud of dark gray hair looked likea thunderhead. “Now is the time you need slaves to keep your household together.You can buy them today and let them manage your residence while you’re gone.”Renn looked at him in horror. “Untrained slaves? They would burn my villa to theground.”Quentin snorted again. “Then we’d gut them in public and make an example ofthem.”“At the cost of my villa? No thank you.” He fidgeted, then finally gave up inexasperation. “I need to gather my people and supplies. Captain Trevor has hissoldiers ready, and we plan to leave the city before sundown. It’s a longjourney.” He turned to look hopefully at Nathan. “It’s just over the mountains?”Warily, Nathan just shrugged.“Then I must be going.” Renn turned about with a swirl of his robes and left theslave market, exuding disappointment.The matronly Elsa, with her short graying hair and sturdy figure, stopped besideNathan and said conversationally, “I could use another four or five householdslaves. It’s been months since the Norukai came here with new possibilities,but…” She shrugged, flashed him a faint smile. “I haven’t purchased slaves inyears. I suppose it’s overdue. Many of mine are so old they can barely do theirchores, but I’m fond of them.”In raised stone seats not far from the rectangular platform, prospective buyersshowed their sacks of coins, declared their intent, and received bidding status.The duma members took reserved seats up the stone steps, but guards raised theirhands when Nicci and Nathan attempted to join them. “Apologies,” said astony-faced young man with corn silk for a beard. “You two are not citizens ofIldakar, and these seats are for bidders only. Unless you intend to spend moneyon slaves?”“No, we do not,” Nicci said sharply.Nathan leaned close, his expression distraught. “Maybe we should, Sorceress. Ifwe had enough gold, we could buy a few of the poor wretches, give them a goodlife, set them free. We could set an example for the city.”She looked at her companion, proud of his determination but thinking him naive.“I applaud the suggestion, but where would you get enough Ildakaran coins tooutbid all these nobles?”“If I had my gift, I could create all the gold I might need. It’s a usefulskill.…”“And all the other wizards of Ildakar could do the same. No, we have to thinkmuch bigger, find a way to overturn the whole problem. Buying one or two slaveswould make no difference.” She narrowed her blue eyes, looking around the crowd,seeing the excitement and hunger in their expressions.“It would make a difference to the one or two slaves we set free,” he said in aquiet voice.“In that, you are correct,” she admitted. Her mind prowled through possibilitieslike a hunting cat, tried to find a way to make a difference. She kept herexpression neutral, studying the crowd as it continued to swell. “I alwaysthought I was free, but the Imperial Order had me shackled in chains of my ownbeliefs. I served Jagang, not knowing I was a slave to my own delusions.”Nathan stroked his smooth chin. “And as a Sister of the Dark you were trapped byyour loyalty to the Keeper.”She let out a breath slowly to calm herself, but she didn’t want to be calm. Shejust wanted to focus her determination. How could she fight an entire city, away of life entrenched for thousands of years, and a cadre of powerful wizardswhose gift was unknown?“Now I’m free to serve Richard Rahl in a quest to make others free.” She lookedaround the slave market and felt a heaviness in her heart. “But here, I suspectthese chains are too thick and too strong.”“The Sisters kept me a prisoner as well,” Nathan pointed out, “a slave toprophecy, locked in their impregnable tower because of my gift. But I brokefree—and you managed to throw off the bonds of the Keeper and of Jagang. Let’stake heart; nothing is impossible.”Nicci agreed. “Nothing is impossible.”Arriving late, the fleshmancer Andre hurried through the crowd. Grinning, heshot Nathan a quick glance. “Perhaps I can buy test subjects, and then we canexperiment to find a way to give you back the heart you need, hmmm?”Because the bidders’ stands were full by now, Andre had to take one of the lowerseats, which made him moody, but he perked up when drums began to pound outsidethe square. The audience turned, waiting. Bodies shifted, and the crowd splitapart like a stream diverting around a stone.The Norukai slavers arrived, a procession that stalked into the square. Theymoved through the gathered people as if they were no more than air.Nicci bristled. The Norukai were burly men, built to be fighters, made rugged bytheir windswept islands and their violent lives. Their arms were as thick as anynormal man’s thigh. They wore a variety of tough vests made of a thick, scalyleather like sharkskin, but the scales were larger. Each one had iron-shodleather boots, black leggings, and a thick, armored girdle around his waist andhips. An assortment of double-bladed axes, swords, wicked-looking iron clubs,and knives dangled from their belts. Some sported braided leather whips, thetips of which were splayed, like a horse’s tail; the multiple strands would, nodoubt, inflict great pain on a victim.Every one of the Norukai had a hideously scarred face. They intentionally slicedtheir cheeks from the corners of their lips back to the hinge of the jaw, thenstitched them up again. Some had tattooed scale designs to make them look morelike the powerful serpents carved into the prows of their ships.“I remember killing many of them,” Nicci said.“We saved the people of Renda Bay,” Nathan said. He touched the ornate sword athis side. “I proved I could be a deadly warrior even without my magic.” Heflashed his azure eyes at Nicci. “But I would much rather have my magic.”The Norukai led a procession of more than a hundred captive men, women, andchildren. All were gaunt, dusty, and miserable, wearing only scraps of clothes.Some still wore ragged boots or sandals, while others were barefoot, trailingblood across the flagstones as they stumbled along. Most kept their eyes castdown toward the heels of the person in front of them. When a few saw the broadplatform in the center of the slave market, they began to mutter.Nicci’s stomach clenched, her fist opened and closed as anger flared inside her.With a surge, she could release wizard’s fire and kill all of the raiders … butwhat good would that do? She had been reckless before, fighting for lost causes,but this was a greater battle, and she had to do it properly.A captive woman moaned and sniffled, struggling mightily not to wail. One of theNorukai struck her on the side of the face, his knuckles smashing her temple sothat she reeled. As she started to collapse, the slaver grasped her hair andyanked her back up, dragging her along. She stumbled, her legs flopped, and shefought to regain control of her body. One of her fellow slaves took her arm,tried to help her along. Eventually, somehow, the woman found the strength tokeep her feet moving.While the slavers were distracted by the stumbling woman, a bedraggled manbolted from the line of prisoners and rushed into the crowd, as if he expectedto disappear among them.“What does he think he’s doing?” Nathan cried.Nicci straightened, ready to fight in case a brawl broke out. “He’s a fool.”The desperate man took four steps, holding up his hands as if someone fromIldakar might take him under their wing.Two Norukai broke from their escort line and lunged after him like wolves. OneNorukai drew a sword, swept his arm back, and skewered the fleeing man throughthe ribs. Blood sprouted like a blossom in his side. With a gleeful expressionin his eyes, although his slashed and mangled lips could not show a smile, thesecond Norukai withdrew an iron club studded with metal points at the top, likefangs. He swung the club down on the captive’s shoulder, smashing through skinand bone. The desperate man was already collapsing, mortally wounded from thesword thrust. Even so, the second Norukai struck him in the back of the head,caving in his skull.The Ildakaran spectators recoiled to avoid being splashed by the gore, and yetthey were fascinated. Another blow smashed the man’s face into the paving stonesof the square. The first Norukai raised his sword again, stabbed the man in theback, then stabbed him five more times, while his companion continued to poundhim with the spiked iron club until the victim was no more than a human-shapedstain oozing onto the flagstones.Satisfied, the two slavers replaced their weapons and returned to the line. Theremaining captives were aghast, sickened—chastened.As if they had expected this to happen, Ildakaran slaves arrived in the squarewith buckets and brushes and began to clean up the mess.The Norukai leader at the front of the procession had a hooded brow and a highforehead. His face and head were shaved smooth, but on the left side of hisskull, above the temple, a sharp triangular tooth was inset, perhaps a shark’stooth. Skin and scar tissue had grown around it so that it looked as if thetooth sprouted from his head.Nathan muttered, “Dear spirits, they find new ways to make themselves moreappallingly ugly than the last.”Sitting nearby on the row of stone seats, Andre clucked his tongue. “Yes, it isdisappointing. Their techniques are so crude. I could easily have reshaped themwith my gift, but they seem to enjoy the pain and scars.”“No doubt it makes them feel strong and brave,” Nicci said. “I’ve known men likethat before.”Dressed in business robes, slave merchants gathered on the rectangular platformunder the trellis of red flowers, waiting for the captives to arrive. TheNorukai leader raised his voice defiantly. His loose, gashed jaw distorted hiswords, but the power in his voice was unmistakable. “I am Kor, captain of thisbrace of ships. We’ve brought one hundred sixty to your market. We expect a goodprice. We will be glad to rid ourselves of this walking meat.”The Norukai herded the captives onto the large platform where the cowed andwhimpering men, women, and children stood under the high trellis. The raidersglowered at them, making guttural sounds in their throats, calling up salivathat made their exhalations sound like serpent hisses.Ildakaran slave merchants hurried about, tugging down the lush green vines ofthe wisterias. When they touched vine tendrils to the captives, like laughablythin ropes to hold them in place, the slaves became docile. Their expressions ofterror melted into contented apathy.Even from the bidding benches, Nicci could smell the flower perfume growingthicker, headier. She began to feel dizzy, and she assumed it was some kind ofdrug, a tranquilizing effect from the flowers, enhanced by the merchants’ gift.When all the captives had been tamed, the slave merchants went up and down therows, ripping the rags, pulling off tunics, scraps of cloth, dresses and shawlsthat covered the haggard and abused captives. The merchants took specialpleasure in exposing the young women, even fondling their breasts while theaudience made comparative notes. The most beautiful girls were brought to thefront. One of the slave merchants slapped at their inner thighs, making themspread their legs apart so that all prospective buyers could see their thatchesof hair.Young children were herded in another section, also naked, for sale to the moredisgusting appetites of Ildakar. The stronger male captives were segregated, aswere the middle-aged women, who would be the best domestic servants. Theobservers talked in a drone of casual conversation, while Nicci simply felt firein her throat, all of her unspoken words turning to acid.Elsa pointed to the group of middle-aged women and called out, “What is thestarting bid for those four?”Chief Handler Ivan growled in his deep voice, “And those men, the front ones.Are they combat-trained? Can they fight in the arena?”Captain Kor sneered up at the buyers in the stands. “I did not interview themabout their skills. I have no need for housekeepers on our serpent ships, sothey cowered belowdecks. During the raids, we killed any man who fought againstus, so I would say that these are not the best fighters.” He glanced at thecaptives crowded on the platform and turned back with a withering glare. “Youask questions that do not interest me. These are only walking meat. Norukai arethe herdsmen and, if necessary, the butchers. Buy them and do with them what youwill.”Out of the corner of her eye, Nicci saw a young man pushing his way through thecrowd—Bannon. He looked sullen, his long ginger hair tied back in a ponytailthat fell between his shoulders. He reached Nicci and Nathan, shaking his head.“I was with Amos and the others when we saw the ships come in. But I … I had tocome here. I had to see. All these people…” He swallowed hard. “Ian was one ofthem, years ago.”Nicci knew what he was thinking. Very likely his friend had been in the samesituation, beaten into submission, starved into weakness, unable to fight, heldlistless by the vines of the bloodred wisterias.“I’ll bid four golds for those four domestic women,” Elsa said. “They lookuseful, and I’ll treat them well.”“I care not how you treat them,” Kor said.“Four golds?” another woman grumbled. “You set the price too high!”“If you pay well and treat them well, they serve you well,” Elsa said.One fat nobleman touched his fingertips together, like a spider dancing on amirror. “How much for the three little boys, the tender ones?”The boys didn’t even flinch. They stood naked at the corner of the dais, touchedby the tendrils of the vines.“Enough—this market is over!” said a powerful voice. Sovrena Thora emerged fromthe main thoroughfare on the left, walking alongside Maxim. She still showed nowarmth toward her husband, but they seemed united in their purpose now.“We invoke the city privilege,” Maxim said. “We’ll buy the whole lot.”The slave merchants looked surprised. “But we have yet to set a fair price,Wizard Commander.”“We have the entire city treasury,” he said flippantly. “It’ll be a fair price …but we want them all.”Quentin said, “You can’t cull out just a few of them? This is the first time theNorukai have arrived in months. The whole city has need of slaves. So many havefled once the shroud started going down, thanks to Mirrormask helping themescape.”“Our own slaves are breeding well enough,” Thora said. “We require these for theupcoming blood magic to restore the shroud. That will stop them from fleeing.”Elsa looked nervous and disappointed. “In the past you needed only fifteen ortwenty slaves to erect the shroud. There are one hundred sixty here.”Thora sniffed. “Perhaps we mean to do a greater bloodworking this time, a morepermanent spell.”“It never hurts to be sure,” Maxim said. He gestured to the stone benches wherethe disappointed bidders sat squirming. “Elsa has set the price—four golds forfour slaves. I’ll have the treasurer settle up with the merchants.” He gave apolite nod to Captain Kor. “You’ll be paid well enough that I hope you returnthe next time our shroud comes down.”“If we ever allow it to come down,” Thora said.The crowd muttered at having their entertainment cut short. The wine merchantsdropped their prices and shouted their specials. Food vendors waved leftoverskewers and pastries in the air.Queasy, Bannon shook his head. “I do not like this city,” he said, looking atNathan. “Do you have any hope Andre will restore your gift soon? There’s so muchmore of the Old World to explore.” He swallowed. “Isn’t there?”Nathan said, “I’m as anxious to be on our way as you are.”Nicci, though, was hard and determined. “I am reluctant to abandon these people.Ildakar was once a bright and legendary city, but now it is a festering sore.Lord Rahl sent us on our mission. Could there be any more fundamental need thanthese people have demonstrated? How can we not help them? We must find a way tooverthrow this practice and bring freedom—as Richard demands.”Nathan looked as if he had swallowed a piece of rotten fruit. “I cannot help youfight until I get my gift back … and in order to accomplish that, I have to playalong with these people, even though I’m beginning to despise what I see allaround me.” He looked discouraged, angry at his own helplessness. “Sorceress,you can’t bring down a city’s centuries-old tradition all by yourself.”She fastened her blue-eyed gaze upon him. “I’m not alone. I have you.”Bannon stepped close and touched the hilt of his sword. “And me.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 28 [contents.xhtml#c_ch28]That night, the sovrena and the wizard commander hosted another celebratorybanquet, this time to welcome the vile Norukai.Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon were invited, though their presence was clearly anafterthought. The brutish slavers were the center of attention. Captain Kor andthree other representatives from the serpent ships came up to join the dumamembers, while the remaining thirty Norukai sailors were turned loose on thecity’s drinking establishments, restaurants, and silk yaxen dachas. Despite thehonor of the invitation to dine with the city’s most important wizards, Kor andhis burly companions—Lars, Yorik, and Dar—clearly would have preferred to jointhe rest of their comrades in more hedonistic settings.As brittle as glass, Nicci chose a seat at the far end of the table, next toNathan, and although Bannon sat with Amos, Jed, and Brock, he lookeduncomfortable to be there at all. Nicci had not seen him smile in days, and sheunderstood why. She hadn’t smiled either.The Norukai captain sat with his elbows spread, ready to eat with both hands asa huge joint of roast yaxen was brought in on a spit, slaves carrying it ontheir shoulders; younger slaves kept pace, holding a pan beneath the meat tocatch the drippings. Servants circled the table pouring goblets of bloodwine,but Kor gruffly declared, “This takes too long. Just bring a bottle for me andfor each of my men.” He made a guttural sound that might have been laughter. “Infact, bring two bottles for Yorik; otherwise he will complain.”Dar gulped from his goblet, then wiped a forearm across his lips as a dribble ofred liquid seeped from the scar at the side of his cheek. “A good vintage.”The other Norukai drank and agreed.Kor yanked a leather pouch from his waist and tossed it to Dar. It clanked withgolden coins. “Here’s part of our earnings from today. Find a wine merchant andbuy as much as you can to load aboard our ships.”“We’ll drink it all on the voyage back,” Yorik said.“Better keep at least a keg for King Grieve,” Kor said.The other Norukai suddenly looked tense at the mention of the name. “We’ll setone aside for him.”Maxim nodded to the pouch of coins. “That much gold should buy several kegs.”“Good, then buy some of this meat too.” Kor used his own knife to cut off a hunkof the roast, while the servants were more delicate as they carved the choicestmorsels for the guests.Silent and alert, Nicci watched their movements, studying the Norukai like apredator ready to pounce. The wizards of Ildakar unsettled her, but she hatedthe Norukai in a different way. As second-tier guests, she and her companionswere served last. Nicci ate quietly so as not to draw attention to herself,while Nathan consumed the meat and tubers on his plate, mopping up the juiceswith fresh bread. Bannon didn’t touch his food.“Where are your best silk yaxen whores in the city?” Kor asked.“We’d like to sample several,” said Lars, “but we don’t want to waste our time.”Amos interjected, “I know the best ones.”Sovrena Thora sat at the head of the table using her jeweled dining implements.She ate as if she were made of lace and gold wire. “Yes, my son is well versedin these things.”“Our friend Bannon may be interested in joining us,” Jed said, but it was lessof an invitation than a sarcastic barb. “We’ll take good care of him.”Bannon flushed and carefully admitted, “The women are very beautiful.”The scarred raiders looked at one another and chortled, muttering in a grufflanguage that sounded like rocks grinding together. Dar said, “Ildakar women aretoo delicate and break too easily.”“We prefer the sturdy beauty of Norukai females,” said Kor. “But your women willdo. We have been lonely enough at sea. The slaves were serviceable, but they canonly slake so much of a man’s thirst.”Wizard Commander Maxim said, “Because you are welcome trading partners, we wouldalso invite you to one of our pleasure parties, if you prefer noble Ildakaranwomen. We can make an exception, and it would be an experience you’d not soonforget.” With a wicked smile, he gestured toward the sovrena. “My lovely wifewould be most willing to accommodate you. She is not choosy about her men.”Thora gave him a venomous glare. “We will indeed have a pleasure party thisevening with many nobles, if that would be something you and your men mightenjoy, Captain Kor.” She seemed to force the words out of her.The scarred Norukai leered at her.Maxim added, “And the sorceress Nicci is welcome, as always.”“As always,” Nicci said. “And as always, I choose to decline.”He let out a good-natured chuckle. “As you wish. Considering your cool demeanor,some nobles have suggested your nipples are made of ice chips.”“Fools can suggest whatever they like,” Nicci said.Nathan couldn’t help but smile as he sat beside her.Maxim laughed again. “Adorable, just adorable.”Kor looked from Thora to the prim duma members and turned back to young Amos,who was helping himself to a second serving of the yaxen meat. “We’d prefer thewhorehouses. Noblewomen talk too much, at a time when talking is unimportant.”For the next course, servants brought in platters heaped with small grilledbirds, each one no more than a morsel. The wizard Damon perked up, stroking hislong mustaches. “Ah, delicious! Honey-roasted larks. Are they yours, Sovrena?”She nodded. “Yes, their music is sweet, but their flesh is sweeter. I will needto catch more. We have nets strung out across the rooftops.”“How many more slaves do you need us to bring?” Kor interrupted. “And when? Wehave many serpent ships in the estuary, as well as the islands. We’ll acquirewhat you need. Just tell us.”“Slaves perish, although they do reproduce quickly as well,” Ivan said, holdingup his empty plate, impatiently waiting for a servant to add more meat.“Today’s group will serve us well,” Thora said. “It should allow us to work ourspell and restore the shroud for a very long time.”“If your shroud is in place, then how can we sell you more slaves?”“Ildakar lived beneath the shroud for many centuries,” said Maxim. “We were aclosed system with no outside commerce, but I much prefer the infusion ofoutside goods, and fresh blood. Believe me, we’ll still have to drop the shroudoccasionally in order to replenish our resources.”“You expect us just to wait in our ships until your city shows itself again?What will happen to our cargo in the meantime?” Kor asked.Bannon stared down at his food, moving it about with his sharp-tined fork.“They’re not just cargo,” he growled loudly enough for the others to hear.“They’re people … like my friend Ian. He was a young man with a future ahead ofhim, until you took him. We’re going to get him his freedom.” He shot ameaningful glance at Amos, who ignored him.The Norukai looked surprised that Bannon had spoken. Andre stroked his thick,braided beard, amused. “The nongifted swordsman has a voice after all? Thiscould be entertaining, hmmm?”“Every person in our perfect society has their function,” said Thora. “Some ofus bear the burden of being leaders. Others simply work. They know their place.”Nicci saw that Bannon had gulped his entire goblet of bloodwine. He was flushedand angry, and now he spoke more loudly. “We’ve seen how the Norukai attackhelpless villages.” He stabbed his fork with a clang onto his plate. “How youprey upon the innocent.”Kor’s eyes smoldered. The other Norukai seemed annoyed, but they let theircaptain speak for them. “We don’t prey upon the innocent—we prey upon the weak.That is how nature works. We cull the herd of humanity. Some die, and others areput to good use as slaves. We are the strong, so we do as we wish.”Bannon clearly wanted to start a fight. Fortunately, he had not been allowed tobring his sword to the banquet, or he might have provoked a bloody brawl.Nicci touched her companion’s arm, and he froze, though he still looked ready toexplode. Turning to the slavers, she used a different weapon. “If you are sopowerful, Captain Kor, then explain something we found on our journey here toIldakar.” Her blue eyes flashed, and the others paused, waiting to hear what shewould say. “We encountered four Norukai … or at least, four Norukai heads. Theyhad been skewered on high spikes, left to rot in the road as a warning. Werethey weak?”Angry mutters rippled around the banquet table like the sound of a distantthunderstorm. Both the sovrena and the wizard commander looked uncomfortable,but they made no excuses. Amos glared at Bannon, who didn’t seem to care.“Perhaps they were just there as decoration,” Nathan said flippantly. “Not avery good one.”Thora said, “Beyond our protective shroud there are many hazards. Who knows whathappened to the other Norukai? Since it was well outside Ildakar, it has nothingto do with us.”Yorik gulped another goblet of wine, finishing his first bottle and pouring fromthe second.High Captain Avery marched into the banquet hall as the final dishes were beingtaken away. He bent close to Thora. “Is there anything you desire, Sovrena?”“Why, yes.” She reached up to touch his hand. “We have another pleasure partythis evening. I would like you to attend as my personal guest.”The handsome captain nodded. “As you wish, Sovrena. I will serve Ildakar in anyway I am required.”Beside her, Maxim rolled his eyes and turned a hopeful look to Nicci, but shegave him a cool stare from across the table.Nathan said uncertainly to the fleshmancer, “Andre, shall we discuss ideas ofhow to intensify the Han we mapped out on the chart of my body? I would like todevote more time to the problem.”“Not tonight, dear Nathan. We must have time to relax and recover, hmmm? Youshould rest and gather your strength.”The Norukai drank the rest of the bloodwine at the table while Amos and hisfriends offered to guide the brutish guests to the lower levels of Ildakar. Theydid not extend the invitation to Bannon again, and he did not seem disappointed."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 29 [contents.xhtml#c_ch29]Bannon’s anger made him see red shadows as he strode out into the darkness. Hehad no interest in carousing with Amos and his friends, especially if they werewith the loathsome Norukai. Amos had promised to help him with Ian for two daysnow, made offhand reassurances, but Bannon had seen no real interest there.Therefore, he would try to do what he could on his own. After having seen whathad happened to his poor friend, who was alive but still destroyed, he felt adangerous restlessness.The Norukai sickened him. They had laughed and snorted during the banquet,gorging themselves on roast yaxen and bloodwine … and the council membersgreeted them as welcome visitors, respected merchants. In the slave marketBannon had watched the battered captives hauled onto the platform for sale. Anyone of them might have been Ian as a young man, clubbed and abducted from apeaceful cove on Chiriya Island.…Bannon blinked hot tears out of his eyes as he stumbled into the middle levelsof the city. The boulevards were busy with evening customers. Taverns andrestaurants served food and drink, while shopkeepers stayed open late, hawkingtheir wares to nobles out for an evening stroll.Bannon knew where he had to go. He made his way past the large and eerily emptycombat arena and went directly to the tunnel opening in the sandstoneoutcropping that led to the training pits.Torches in iron racks flickered outside the tunnel, but he saw no barred gate,no guard. Bannon drew a breath, focused his hazel eyes, and entered the darkpassage.His hand strayed to his hip. He wished he had brought Sturdy, but his hosts hadinsisted he leave the blade in his room. Ildakar was supposedly a perfectsociety, so why would anyone need weapons to defend themselves? But one of thecity guards had recently been murdered, so the streets were indeed dangerous …to certain people, at least. Bannon had sensed the unrest among the people likerot spreading through a barrel of apples. Without his sword, his hand clenchedinto a fist instead.He walked deeper into the disturbingly dark tunnel toward the warren of warriorcells. If he could get Ian free, then everything would feel all right.He heard a sudden movement and whirled, reacting as a pale figure lunged out ofthe shadows. Hard muscle slammed into him. A hand grabbed the front of hischest, threw him against the sandstone wall, and another hand seized his longhair, yanked it back.Bannon swung his fist, flailed, and by sheer luck, connected with soft flesh. Heheard an outburst of pain, a quick exhalation of air. He struck again, but thewiry figure kept attacking him, a dynamo of muscles and swift, successive blows.He took a punch to his ribs followed by a crack to the side of his head, and hisskull struck the wall of the tunnel. Stars sparkled in his vision and he reeled,fighting back. A swift chop to the base of his neck turned his legs to jelly.As Bannon began to slide to the floor, his attacker grabbed him by the back ofthe shirt and dragged him along. He could hear heavy breathing, but no voice,nothing beyond the ringing in his ears. He kicked out with his feet, tried todrag the heels of his boots, but nothing slowed his movement. Finally thedarkness grew brighter around him, and he realized he had been hauled to thelarger grotto with sunken fighting pits along with numerous warrior holdingcells in side tunnels.Trying to get his wits about him, he saw the young morazeth with light brownhair standing over him: Lila, wearing only a black leather wrap around her hipsand another strip covering her breasts.“Normally, I would kill an intruder,” she said, “but you sparked my curiosity.”He wiped blood from his mouth and struggled to his feet. “Sweet Sea Mother, whydid you do that?” He shook his head and the ringing began to clear.Lila’s thin lips quirked in a smile. “For practice.” Her skin was covered withthe branded symbols, but she wore them with confidence, like badges of honorrather than scars. “I could have kicked you in the crotch and dropped you like astone, but then you wouldn’t be much for conversation.” She placed her hands onher hips. “Now tell me, why did you come here?”“My friend, Ian,” he said. “I came for Ian.”Lila sniffed. “Are you stupid as well as weak? He doesn’t want to see you. Hemade that clear earlier.”“But I want to see him. I want to free him. I’ll do anything—can I pay for hisrelease? Can I arrange for him to be pardoned?”Lila blinked. “Pardoned? He has committed no crime. He is our champion.”“Ian was taken as a boy, ripped away from his home by Norukai slavers! Who knowswhat torments he suffered? And now he’s forced to fight in your combat pits.”The morazeth gave him a withering stare. “He was a weak child with no futureother than to be a dirt farmer on a dull island. Now he’s been toughened andtrained. He has slain a hundred opponents. He is the champion of all Ildakar,and Adessa herself has taken him as her lover. By the Keeper, why would he wishto leave all that?”“To be free,” Bannon said.Lila sniffed. “No one is free. Every person is bound by chains of one sort oranother.”“I’m not,” Bannon said.“Of course you are—or you will be. Perhaps your chains are your ignorance of theway the world works.”Bannon brushed himself off, wiped more blood from his split lip, and tried to bebusinesslike. He brought out the gold coins Amos had given him in case he wanted“special services” from the silk yaxen, as well as the additional coins thedoorman had given him. “I want to buy his freedom.” He held out the coins. “Realgold.”She let out a scornful laugh. “A few coins? For the champion? Gold is notenough.”“Then what would it take to free him?”Lila seemed amused. “What do you have to offer?”“Anything I have,” he said, swelling his chest.She was unimpressed. “Then you have nothing of interest. Can you get adispensation from the wizard commander? Or the sovrena? Would any member of thewizards’ duma speak on your behalf to transfer ownership of the champion?”Bannon looked away. “Not yet.” He could ask Nicci and Nathan to make his case,but their position here was weak as well. They had used any goodwill to ask thewizards to help Nathan with his gift. His heart ached, and he felt true despair.“I’ll think of something.”“Then you’d best keep thinking.”Lila turned him around and herded him back up the tunnel. Ahead, he discerned abrighter swatch of night, stars and streetlights. “But I want to see Ian again.”“I want many things, too,” Lila responded. “We don’t always get what we want.You have much to learn about life, boy.” She shoved him out into the open, andhe stumbled into the streets. Lila stood at the tunnel opening, slender andfierce, yet disturbingly attractive.Bannon faced her, staring for a long moment, but she didn’t even blink. Herealized he would have to try something else, find another ally, or else Ianwould remain a prisoner forever."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 30 [contents.xhtml#c_ch30]That night while Nicci slept, restless and alone, she also prowled the darkstreets in her mind. Unsettled from the banquet and the Norukai slavers, hermind subconsciously sought out the spell bond with Mrra. The big cat moved likea tan shadow in the night, invisible in the winding maze of the great city.Nicci’s consciousness drifted, then reunited with her sister panther, but hermind simply observed as she felt the cat’s strength. Mrra was a mass of enhancedsenses, sights and smells exploding into a symphony of afterimages. Glowinglight from cracks in the windows and distant streetlights provided more thanenough illumination for her to see. Each faint odor told some story: the foulsplashes of brown water from emptied chamber pots in the tiled gutters, thefresher scent of pure water running through narrow aqueducts beneath thestreets, rat dung and the sharper smell of domestic cats that hunted the backalleys. Decorative flowers exuded a sickly sweet perfume in window boxes above.She leaped onto a decorative stone fence, then with barely an effort, sprang tothe sloping tiles of a high roof and padded along the apex before bounding downto another roof, moving along, exploring.Mrra had found a temporary den where she could sleep during the daylight hours,a large grain warehouse filled with comforting shadows. Few people enteredthere, and she found plenty of rats to eat, although the dust made Mrra’swhiskers twitch and caused her to sneeze.At night, she was free to explore the great city. She had prowled past where thechief handler tormented the arena animals. Her lips curled back and a low growlbubbled in her throat.In bed, Nicci flexed her claws, wanting to rip something apart because of darkmemories from that long-before time, before her troka had escaped. Mrraremembered the pain, the blood, and the fighting.Even now she sensed another troka of sand panthers deep in that nightmarishtunnel. Mrra could tell that these cats were abused just as as she had been,their thoughts twisted by the cruel gift of the chief handler … whom they alsohated. Trained predators, they tore apart victims on the killing sands of thearena, but they wanted to use their claws to rend Ivan instead.Mrra felt the same way, and Nicci tasted it in the back of her own throat.The big cat bounded off into the darkness, letting shadows enfold and embraceher. She wanted to come up to the top of the plateau and see her sister panther,but Nicci silently warned the big cat to keep her distance, to stay far from thegrand villa.Wait, sister panther, Nicci thought in her blurred sleeping state. Wait.* * *Hours after midnight, she awoke with feline dreams still in her mind. As shestretched her arms and legs, Nicci felt the memory of panther muscles. She waswide awake, alert, and impatient, though the sun would not rise for a long timeyet.She donned her black dress and slipped out into the night. Walking in thestreets, she thought about the panther prowling out there, but decided it wouldbe too risky for them to meet. Instead, Nicci would glide through the city byherself—not quite a sand panther, but a sorceress. That would be sufficient.She walked down the cobblestoned streets, passing under decorative willows whosedrooping fronds shushed with secretive whispers. Glowing spheres emanated bluelight from the tops of iron pedestals, illuminating intersections whileproviding ample shadows elsewhere.Nicci descended past the ornate homes of minor nobles who were desperatelytrying to show their importance. She saw the bright green eyes of an orangehouse cat searching for dinner in the streets. The cat darted off without makinga sound.Working her way downhill, following a main thoroughfare, Nicci passed theswinging wooden signs of inns and the homes of tradesmen, where people werebedded down for the night.She came upon a silent square with a fountain leaking a mournful trickle ofwater over a scalloped upper bowl and down into a holding pool. Pennants withthe sun-and-lightning-bolt symbol of Ildakar hung limp with the night dampnessand still air.She caught a sparkle of light on the wall of a nearby building—a jagged fragmentof mirror thrust in the crack between bricks. Another mirror fragment glinted onthe opposite wall.With heightened senses, Nicci cautiously walked across the square, finding morebroken mirrors scattered around the fountain’s edge like defiant declarationsmade during the dark safety of the night. Then her eyes caught furtive movement,hooded figures in the alleys. They did not run away, but waited, blending intothe inky shadows. Nicci faced them, confident in her own powers to defendherself. She waited for them to make the first move.The strangers hiding in the darkness made no noise, did not call out orchallenge her. On impulse, Nicci bent down and picked up one of the mirrorfragments from the edge of the fountain. She held it between her fingers andlifted it up.Several hooded figures came forward, their faces covered by gauzy black scarves.Each wore a wooden amulet bearing an Ildakaran rune. Looking at their obscuredfeatures, Nicci shook her head so that her long blond hair fell loose. “I do notneed to hide who I am.”“But we do,” said one of the strangers. “We still have much to accomplish tosave our city.”“I am not from Ildakar,” she said.“We know,” said another stranger. The hooded figures turned to the deepest blackshadows of a side street and raised their hands in a signal. Another personemerged wearing a flowing robe of thunderstorm gray. When he stepped into thefaint light, Nicci saw a confusing jumble of images inside his hood, rather thana face.A mirror.A mirror mask covered his face.“I know you,” she said. “Or at least I know of you.”“All of Ildakar knows of me,” said the man, his voice muffled behind the smoothmirror. There were mere slits for his eyes, another for his mouth. “Every slaveand every downtrodden citizen of Ildakar knows who I am. We fight for freedom.Some stand openly for our cause, while others support us with their hearts andminds.”“The wizards know of you, too,” Nicci said. “They want to kill you.”“Many have tried, but as you can see, they’ve not yet succeeded. Meanwhile, myfollowers free slaves treated badly by the worst masters. We have secret hidingplaces in the city, and we can slip them out of Ildakar, where they go off intothe hills, find other villages and cities, make new lives for themselves. Wehave to do as much as we can whenever the shroud is down. If we get rid ofenough slaves, then the wizards will never have enough for the fullbloodworking.”“Then why don’t they all leave?” Nicci asked. “Why do you stay?”“Because the battle is here. I intend to remain until we have swept away therepression, overthrown the duma. That is my goal.”“An admirable goal.” Recalling the grim spectacle of the slave market, she felther resentment flare to a brighter intensity. “I also support you, as do mycompanions. We can be a great help—if you have a plan. But the oppression inIldakar is powerful.”The masked man nodded slowly. “Powerful, yes, but not invincible. We have beenwatching you.”Nicci was surprised. “You have followers in the grand villa? In the wizards’duma?”“We have followers everywhere,” said Mirrormask. “We can read your heart. Youare indeed one of us, Sorceress Nicci.”She held on to a thread of healthy skepticism. “Loyal allies are hard to find.Who are you? Is it true you wear that mask because your features were deformedby a fleshmancer?”A strange muffled chuckle came from behind the mirror covering. “Is that whatthey say? Perhaps it’s true. Or perhaps I keep my mask so that people who lookat me can reflect on what they might do for the rebellion. This once-great cityhas grown stagnant during the centuries we were trapped under the shroud.”Again, the muffled laugh. “And ‘shroud’ is an appropriate term, because shroudsare used to wrap the dead.”His hooded followers muttered and nodded.“We do what we can, but you also have great power, Nicci. You can disrupt theequilibrium of this city. We have been watching you.”The disguised followers muttered in agreement. “We’ve been watching you.”With a pale, thin hand, Mirrormask picked up a shard of broken mirror andpressed it into Nicci’s palm. “Be ready.” He closed her fingers around the sharpedges—not enough to cut, but enough for her to feel the razor edge. “Reflect onthis.”He backed away with a swirl of his shadowy gray robes. His followers darted intothe darkness, and Mirrormask disappeared, leaving Nicci holding the mirrorfragment. She kept it, glad that she had come out here late at night. Now shefelt more hopeful about the future of Ildakar than she had in many days.Nicci knew she had found allies."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 31 [contents.xhtml#c_ch31]The sleeping city remained silent as she made her way back to the upper levelsof the plateau. Ahead, not far from the grand villa, Nicci could see theimposing pyramid illuminated with magical torches. At the apex, the silveryapparatus captured the diamond scatter of stars that shone through a thin veilof high clouds.Returning to the villa, Nicci slipped through the archways and into the halls,creeping along. Statues stood in the halls, bizarre sculptures that she wasconvinced must be petrified victims of a wizard’s wrath. After the beseigingarmy was turned to stone, the people of Ildakar would have rejoiced, knowingthey were free, yet over the years, the power that saved them had turned intooppression. When she came upon the statue of the angry old woman, Nicciremembered how helpless she had felt when the Adjudicator trapped her in stone,forcing her to relive the moment of her greatest guilt. Nicci had been unable tofight that spell—and she was certain Sovrena Thora or any of the duma memberswould be far greater foes.She would have to find a different way to fight them. Perhaps Mirrormask and hisuprising might provide an alternative.When she passed Nathan Rahl’s quarters, she saw a glow. The wizard was awakeeven in the hours before dawn. She hesitated, considering whether or not todisturb him. Through the gift, he could have sensed her there, but having losthis magic, Nathan was effectively blind.When she knocked, he sounded startled. “I’m resting. I’m not interested.”“It’s Nicci,” she said.She heard a surprised sound, and he swung the door back. “Sorceress! I thoughtyou were one of those high nobles, demanding that I join them in their wildpleasure parties.”Nicci raised her eyebrows. “And have they bothered you this evening?”He turned away, stroking his smooth chin between thumb and forefinger. “Notexactly, but I was gathering my courage, just in case I needed to turn themdown. I do have principles.”Nicci slipped into his chamber, where he had spread out papers on the smallwriting desk. Glowing lanterns shed warm yellow light over the documents. “I’mwriting in the life book, recording the things we’ve seen and learned,” heexplained. “Someday we’ll take this volume back to D’Hara so we can impressRichard with our adventures.” He sank into the chair by the writing desk andgestured for her to sit, and Nicci chose the comfortable corner of his bed,brushing down the fabric of her black dress.Nathan closed the leather-bound book the witch woman had given him. “I have noregrets at being an ambassador, and I have seen much more of the world than Iexpected to.” His thin lips quirked in a smile. “During all those centuries inthe Palace of the Prophets, I dreamed of having adventures, and I longed toexplore lands unknown. I concocted stories and wrote them down. Even now itsurprises me how popular some of my tales became, like The Adventures of BonnieDay. But now that I’ve actually become an adventurer myself, there’s a part ofme—a small part, but it grows larger every day—that would simply like to go backhome.”“An adventurer makes his own home.” Nicci brushed a stray lock of hair out ofher eyes, tucking it behind her ear. “But I’m not on an adventure. I am on amission for Lord Rahl. He wanted me to make sure that others follow theprinciples he gave us, that people can aspire to their own dreams and abide bytheir responsibilities.”She lowered her voice, although she knew full well that Nathan was aware of thefact. “I love Richard. I have always loved him, in one way or another. Moreimportant, I gave him my vow. I must fight to help people, to teach themfreedom. We must bring down tyrants wherever we find them. Including here.”“I could not agree more, dear sorceress,” Nathan said. “And if I weren’t sohelpless, you and I would be leading a charge to take down the ruling counciland free the people of Ildakar.”“We may still do that,” Nicci said. “We must find a way to overthrow this city’sleadership.”Nathan pressed his fist against his breastbone and pushed hard, as if to squeezeout power. “If only Andre would make me whole again.” He shook his head andglanced down at the life book.Nicci saw that he had opened it to the beginning pages where Red’s words hadbeen scrawled. The Wizard will behold what he needs to make himself whole again.And Nicci knew the additional instructions written there, clearly for her, Andthe Sorceress must save the world.“What if the fleshmancer doesn’t restore your wizard’s heart, Nathan?” Niccisaid. “There could be another answer here in Ildakar. Perhaps what you need tomake yourself whole is to make this city whole.”“And that’s also how you plan to save the world, Sorceress?”“I’ve looked into the eyes of the duma members,” Nicci said. “I told them aboutLord Rahl and his vision, and I saw how their thoughts mock me because he isimpossibly far away.” She gritted her teeth and lowered her voice. “But I am notfar away. I am here, and that is what they should fear.”Yes, they had come to this city to assist Nathan, but after talking withMirrormask she was no longer so anxious just to leave. Maybe Ildakar was hermission. When she studied the aloof wizards as they sat superior in their rulingtower, she would not just try to understand them. She would search forweaknesses.Nathan looked saddened and uncertain. “Again, Sorceress, I would vow to helpyou, but we are not in a position of strength.”Nicci narrowed her eyes. “When we are doing the right thing, we are always in aposition of strength. The ruling council will fall.”She rose from the corner of the bed and paced around his room. Beside thereflecting basin in his wall stood a tiny vase with a sprig of herbs—rosemary,from the scent. She glanced at her reflection in the water, then turned back tohim. “Maybe we shouldn’t be so eager to leave here. Maybe the most importantthing we can do is to stay and make sure this city changes for the better. As asorceress, I am confident I could stand against any member of the duma. Maybe Ishould challenge them, become one of the rulers of Ildakar.” Her lips pressedtight in a hard smile. “Overthrow them if they do not cooperate. We could changeIldakar that way.”“We could, dear sorceress,” Nathan said, frowning down at the life book. Heflipped the pages and found the end of his handwriting. “Indeed we could.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 32 [contents.xhtml#c_ch32]Loaded with its smelly cargo, the kraken hunter ship rode low in the water. Thesails and ropes groaned with exhaustion as the vessel finally came into GrafanHarbor. The sailors whooped, flailing their hands and waving caps long beforeanyone onshore could see them. The ship’s sails were patched and drab, graycanvas, brown canvas, and a startling square of clean white fabric.At the rail, Oliver leaned over and retched one more time, though he had longsince emptied the contents in his stomach. The seas were calm and the krakenhunter ship swayed with the slow swell of the waves. It wasn’t so muchseasickness that churned Oliver’s guts, but the stench that permeated the ship.Next to him, Peretta stood straight-backed, as if someone had lashed a spar toher spine. Her skin was pale and her lips were drawn back. “As a memmer, I havepreserved every moment of our long ordeal on the voyage from Serrimundi,” shesaid, then swallowed. “Sometimes that gift is a curse.”The krakeners laughed and jostled one another, pleased to come into port. “It’sthe brothels first for me,” said one man with a horselike face that could onlybe made attractive with sufficient coins, preferably gold ones.“A fine meal and too much drink for me, first,” said another sailor. “Then thebrothels.”A skinny young man no older than Oliver, but whose hands were scarred from hardliving, called out, “This is Tanimura, lads! Plenty of dockside hospitalityhouses serve all three, so you don’t have to make a choice.”The man with the horse face nodded gravely. “And if you find yourself too drunkto move, you can stay overnight in the same place, for an extra fee.”Captain Jared, the brother of the Serrimundi harborlord, strode out on deck,grinning into the freshening breeze. “The prices won’t be a matter of concernfor any of you. We’ve got such a good haul of kraken meat, I’ll give you each afive-silver bonus, and another two if you come back for the return voyage.”Oliver dry-heaved over the rail one more time, swiped the back of his handacross his lips, and said in a rough voice, “Peretta and I won’t be coming back,I’m afraid.”“Didn’t expect you to,” said the captain.Peretta turned to him with pained formality. “We have other business in theD’Haran Empire. Thank you for the passage.”As the ship lumbered into the harbor, heading toward an open dock, the krakenersdonned gloves, while the younger sailors were ordered down into the hold toattach ropes. They also brought cleavers and saws so they could chop up theslimy, sucker-studded tentacles into easily distributed slices.“Fresh kraken meat is a delicacy for many in Tanimura,” Jared said. “When saltedor pickled, it can be sold all the way up into the Midlands. There’s a specialtyshop in Aydindril that buys barrels of the stuff.”Oliver swallowed hard. “It must be an acquired taste.”After they had killed the first of the tentacled behemoths, the sailors hadfeasted on fresh kraken meat, boiling it in a huge iron pot on the mid decks.Oliver thought the meat tasted foul—rubbery, stringy, fishy, and oily all atonce. They had dumped blobs of offal from the discarded head sack in the wake oftheir ship, and moments later sharks swarmed in to feast on the remains. Oliverrealized that what he had believed to be a fine, shiny varnish on the deckboards was actually layers and layers of hardened slime from previous hunts.Though the passage had been free, thanks to Harborlord Otto, the kraken-huntership had not sailed a direct course, but wandered the oceans for two weeks insearch of prey. Captain Jared stood next to his two passengers. He was a tallman with thick muscles and disproportionately wide-set legs that gave him betterbalance in stormy seas.Now as the ship headed toward the docks and all the men worked together like awell-oiled machine—or perhaps well-greased, thanks to the residue from theslaughtered krakens—the captain watched the approach. “So, which will it be foryou, then?” he said to Oliver, humor in the back of his voice. “A brothel, ameal, or too much to drink?”“A bath sounds best to me,” Oliver said shyly. He didn’t know that he could everget the fishy stink off of him. He knew he would need to find fresh clothes. “Imight suggest most of your crew do the same.”“For me, it’ll be a soft bed,” Peretta said.Oliver remembered the nauseating sway and lurch as he had tried to doze off on arope hammock belowdecks. “And me as well.”“Ah, a soft bed, a warm bed, a large bed.” Captain Jared nudged Oliver andPeretta. “If you two are together, there’s no need for a brothel, is there? Ha,ha!”Peretta sniffed, while Oliver blushed bright. “We are fellow scholars andtravelers on an important mission.”“Of course you are, but one doesn’t preclude the other, does it?” Then thecaptain strolled off before they could reply, shouting orders to his men as thelow-riding ship drifted to the pier. Harbor workers rushed out to catch thethrown ropes and tie up the creaking, patched vessel.Merchants were already gathering by the time the sailors threw down the ricketygangplank. Oliver and Peretta could not get off the ship quickly enough. Itwasn’t until they were on solid ground again, and searching for representativesof the D’Haran Empire, that Oliver realized they had instinctively taken eachother’s hands while disembarking.* * *“No records have survived in the Palace of the Prophets,” Verna said, looking atthe concerned expressions on her fellow Sisters who had gathered around her andAmber. “Nothing whatsoever, not so much as a spell to cure a persistent cough,or an accounting ledger of the palace’s last order of cheese.” She shook herhead, but removed the glazed clay toad figurine. “We found only this dear littlething, and it was just an accident.”Sister Rhoda grinned. “I think that belonged to Sister Armina, a keepsake fromher hometown.”The other Sisters stirred. “Is it tainted? Armina was one of the Sisters of theDark.”Verna held it in her palm, looked at the comical eyes of the toad staring backup at her. “I sense no magic here, nothing special.”“I believe she just found it humorous,” said Sister Rhoda. “A little trinket.”Verna could not imagine the grim and businesslike Armina finding anythinghumorous. She returned the figurine to a pocket of her dress.“We could go back and excavate the ruins for years, if we wish, but there willbe little purpose in it. Even the catacombs below were vaporized.”“The protection web must have been woven all the way down to bedrock,” saidyoung novice Amber. “Lord Rahl’s anger must have been quite thorough when hedestroyed it.” Her voice sounded so musical, so bright. She seemed just a littlegirl.Verna nodded. “Yes, Richard’s anger is often quite thorough … and it has savedthe world.”“So we should celebrate,” said Sister Eldine, a woman centuries old, but wholooked no more than forty because of the preservation spell that had permeatedthe Palace of the Prophets.“Yes, we should rejoice,” Verna said, but the tone of her words said theopposite. She still felt adrift because of all the changes in the world.The Imperial Order had been defeated, as had the bloodthirsty armies of theresurrected Sulachan, but Prelate Verna didn’t know what to do. She had hoped todiscover a treasure trove of documents locked in secret chambers deep beneaththe wreckage of the palace, but that hope had been dashed. She and these Sisterswere here in Tanimura, housed in a large new garrison built by General Zimmerand his soldiers. All the women agreed that they should move out of the barracksso that the soldiers who arrived every day need not be so crowded. Zimmer hadnot encouraged them to leave, but Verna could feel the need. Other Sisters ofthe Light were scattered around the D’Haran Empire, many in Aydindril, and somehad even ventured to Westland, the original home of Richard Rahl, where he hadworked as a skilled woods guide.These ten women were the core of the remaining Sisters, the ones who clung totheir teachings and looked to the prelate for guidance. They were busy withmorning chores when a sharp knock came on the front door of their barracks.Young Captain Norcross stood on the plank porch, grinning. “Travelers justarrived, Prelate! They come from far south in the Old World, bringinginteresting news. You will definitely want to hear what they have to say.”“Travelers?” Verna asked. “From one of the coastal cities?”“Much farther than that,” Norcross said with a shy smile for his sister Amber.“They have word of the wizard Nathan and the sorceress Nicci.”Verna hurried to the door, as the other Sisters joined her. “Has General Zimmerbeen informed?”Norcross nodded with enough vigor to rattle his brain loose. “I can take you tohis offices right away.”“Wait here,” she told the other Sisters. “Let me talk with him first.” She couldnever be sure of anything where Nicci and Nathan were concerned.In the general’s office, the fresh wood of the new construction smelled sweetand resinous, in stark contrast to the strong fishy odor that clung to the twoyoung visitors.When she entered the room, Zimmer rose to his feet behind his desk. “Prelate,I’m glad you’re here. These two have much to report.”The visitors were both thin and dressed in frayed clothes as if they had been ona very long journey. Neither of the travelers looked older than Novice Amber.“We’ve come a long way,” said the young man, squinting and blinking. His hairlooked tousled, and he needed a shave, although the fine corn silk did little tocover his cheeks. “Nicci and Nathan charged us with a mission to deliver a fullreport to Lord Rahl … is he here in Tanimura?”“I’m afraid not,” Zimmer said. “He is at least a two-week ride far to the northin the People’s Palace, but he leads a vast empire, so he could well be in theMidlands, or Westland, or down in Anderith.” The general shrugged. “It mighttake a very long time to find him.”The two young messengers slumped in their chairs, overwhelmed by the task beforethem. “We have been traveling so long, and we just want to go home,” said thegirl, whose hair was a mop of dark ringlets.Zimmer brushed a fleck of sawdust from his sleeve. He looked to Verna. “Oliverand Peretta brought many documents describing the work that Nicci and Nathanhave done since leaving Tanimura. They’ve created quite an epic story.”“I’m not surprised,” Verna said. “I expect that Nicci intends to single-handedlybring freedom and peace to the Old World.”“Yes!” Oliver said, blinking quickly. “I believe she does. She’s made greatstrides already.”“And Nathan … one never knows what trouble he might cause, even though he meanswell.”In a rush, taking turns, the two summarized what Nicci and Nathan had done outin the Scar, destroying first the Lifedrinker and then the wild and uncontrolledlife force of Victoria.“She saved Cliffwall,” said Peretta, “the whole archive of knowledge there andall the people.”“She saved the entire world,” Oliver said. “Life’s Mistress would haveoverwhelmed the land from the sea to the mountains.”Verna’s interest was piqued. “Great archive? What is Cliffwall?”Fascinated, she listened as the two travelers explained about the ancientlibrary hidden in the narrow canyons, preserved since the great wizard wars.“Nicci warned us not to attempt any spells or dabble with magic. It is obviouslydangerous,” Oliver said, sounding cowed. “So, our scholars are simplycataloging. They have a lot to do.”“They are the caretakers of knowledge, but they dare not attempt to use it.”Peretta scratched her dark ringlets. “It is risky.”“Indeed it is. I’m glad you realize that.” Verna’s brow furrowed. “For thousandsof years the Sisters of the Light have been the teachers of the most powerfulmagic.”“I wish we had you in Cliffwall,” Oliver said with a sigh. “We really neededsomeone knowledgeable to guide us.”Verna’s pulse raced, and she turned to Zimmer. “General, if that archive is asextensive as they say, not only would it be a powerful resource, but it would bea dangerous weapon should it fall into enemy hands.” She pressed her lipstogether. “Perhaps we need to protect it? Help the scholars study the lore?”General Zimmer sat back down behind his desk, narrowing his eyes as heconsidered the possibilities. “You have a good point, Prelate. I was sent hereto build a garrison, but Tanimura is at peace and everyone serves Lord Rahl.Thousands more soldiers will be sent here as peacekeepers, and from here we willdispatch them south to other cities. Part of my mission is to establishbeachheads throughout the unexplored Old World.”“It is not unexplored,” Peretta said. “Oliver and I know the way.”“I made careful notes,” the young man agreed. “And she remembers everything.”“No one would be better suited to studying all that ancient lore than theSisters of the Light,” Verna pointed out. “And you and your army areparticularly suited to protect it, so that the archive doesn’t fall into thewrong hands.”General Zimmer gave a slow nod. “It may be wise to take a few hundred soldiers.We could leave the garrison in good hands here, so I’ve got nothing to worryabout. Reinforcements will soon come from the north, and according to plan theywill be dispatched to Larrikan Shores, Kherimus, Serrimundi, and other citiesthat no one from D’Hara has yet visited.” He flexed his large hands, then lacedhis fingers together as he leaned forward across the desk. “For now we couldmount an expeditionary force to Cliffwall, maybe establish other outposts alongthe way. It would be well within my mission to take these two back home.”Peretta placed her hands on her knees, adjusting the folds of her worn skirt.“But we have to find Lord Rahl. Nicci said we need to deliver this report tohim. She said it was very important.”“Leave that to me, young lady,” said Zimmer. “I’ll send my best riders north tothe People’s Palace at full speed to deliver these documents directly to LordRahl and the Mother Confessor.” He glanced to the two young travelers. “We wouldbe much obliged if you’d let us escort you back to Cliffwall—provided you canlead the way.”“The messages will be delivered?” Oliver asked, wanting to be sure. “Youpromise? On your honor?”“Of course. I am a man of my word.”“And we get to go home!” Peretta said.Verna rubbed her cheek and realized she was smiling. “We will make sure yourarchive is in good hands.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 33 [contents.xhtml#c_ch33]The morning after the unpleasant banquet with the Norukai, Amos and hiscompanions donned traveling clothes similar to those they had worn when Bannonfirst met them out in the foothills. They carried their iron-tipped clubs andlooked ready to cause some damage. Amos held an extra club in his left hand,which he tossed to Bannon. “Come with us. We’d better stretch our legs, walk inthe open air before it’s too late.”Bannon caught the heavy club. “What do you mean, before it’s too late?”“Now that the Norukai have delivered fresh slaves, my parents will work theblood magic in a few days,” Amos said. “They’ll bring up the shroud, at least atemporary one.”“Then we’ll be trapped inside again.” Jed fidgeted, tossing the rod from onehand to the other.Brock raised his club. “Last chance to smash statue soldiers for a while.”Bannon was surprised they wanted him to join them. Amos strode out into thestreets, expecting the young man to follow. “You might not be gifted, but youcan swing a club, right?”Bannon held the rod uncertainly. “Yes, I can wield one of these, and I can usemy sword too.” The three young men laughed at his lackluster blade. “But I wouldrather go to the training pits—you promised to help me get Ian released. Won’tyou come with me? A word from the son of the sovrena and the wizard commandermight be all we need.”Amos puffed up his chest. “You’re probably right, but it’s really up to myparents. I already mentioned it to them, and I’ll talk with them later, don’tworry.”Feeling a spark of hope, perhaps a foolish hope, Bannon hurried after the threeyoung men, holding on to the club, but more reassured by the sword at his side.Amos and his friends talked among themselves, making rude comments about slavesthey passed.Their mocking comments embarrassed Bannon as they compared breast sizes of slavewomen and debated whether or not it was possible for a lowly servant to haveperfect breasts. Amos pressed the issue, stopping a mousy young woman whocarried a jug of water from one of the fountains. They forced her to put the jugdown, and Amos commanded her to open her shift so they could all look at herchest. Horrified, she refused, fumbling her words.Bannon touched the hilt of Sturdy. “You shouldn’t treat people like that.”“It’s a slave,” Amos retorted. Impatient, he grabbed the tan fabric of her shiftand pulled hard, ripping the garment apart so that she stood exposed andashamed, but too terrified to run.“See? I told you,” Amos said, jabbing at a rash on her left breast. “Notperfect.”“Keeper’s crotch, you’re right,” Jed said, and Brock chortled, though he let hisgaze linger on the curve of her breasts and the otherwise-perfect shape of hernipples. Without another word, Amos flounced off toward the city’s lower levelsand the outer wall.Bannon gave the slave girl an apologetic look. “I’m sorry.” But she wouldn’tmeet his gaze as she gathered the tatters of her clothing and tried to hold hershift together. She picked up the water jug and hurried away.They met High Captain Avery patrolling the streets, and Amos raised hisiron-tipped staff in a mock salute. “We’ll be out with the stone soldiers,continuing the fight for Ildakar.” With a smirk, he added, “Be sure to guard mymother carefully while we’re gone.”Bannon saw Avery’s expression tighten as the young men sauntered away.Reaching the wall, Bannon followed them through the gate and out onto theremnants of the road that had once led trading caravans to Ildakar. Grasses andtall weeds grew between the paving stones. The ruins of old buildings dotted theplain: stone foundations, collapsed walls, the last shadows of outlyingvillages, nearly vanished to history.“Once the shroud goes up again, it might be ten or fifteen years in normal timebefore we can come outside again,” Amos said.“Ten or fifteen years?” Bannon cried.“Because of the shroud’s powerful magic, time moves differently around Ildakar.Even with the shroud down, there are some distortions. It’s not clear how manyweeks or months or centuries have passed beyond our city, but we don’t care,”Amos said. “This is our world.”He couldn’t believe what he had heard. “But … so many years? That’s half of mylife! Or more.”Amos strolled along, swinging his iron club to smash a large thistle that stoodin his way. “You may only have seen twenty years, Bannon Farmer, but we’ve hadcenturies of youth. And we are not done with it yet.”Bannon was baffled. “Centuries? But I thought you were my age.”They all laughed at him. “You have very little in common with us,” said Brock.Soon enough they reached the front ranks of General Utros’s statue soldiers, thepetrified warriors in their intricately tooled armor, thick breastplates, shortswords, battle-axes, and shields. Jed called attention to a young man who hadremoved his helmet and held it in one gauntleted hand. His hair was short andbristly, except for a short ponytail at the base of his neck. His frozenexpression was twisted in anger, his lips curled back to expose teeth, his eyesnarrowed as he delivered a snarl in the direction of Ildakar.“My, doesn’t this one look defiant?” Jed swung his iron-tipped club so hard hechipped off the statue’s ear. Laughing, Amos and Brock took turns hammering thedefiant soldier’s waist, smashing away his plated skirt until they had turnedthe man’s crotch into a pulp of gray powder.“Get yourself some exercise, Bannon,” Amos said. “What are you waiting for?We’re out here to have fun.”Bannon looked at the thousands of stone warriors across the plain and up intothe foothills. This must have been a fearsome army, intent on destruction, butnow they were merely statues, long dead, and his companions insisted on hisparticipation. So Bannon let his anger loose. Imagining the Norukai raiders whohad seized Ian, he battered the head of one stone soldier, picturing a scarredmouth and tattooed scales. After seven blows, he had destroyed the statuewarrior’s head.Amos, Jed, and Brock cheered him on. Next, he thought of how his father hadwhipped him, how he had killed the kittens, how he had beaten his mother todeath. Bannon swung the club again, finding a surrogate target to pay for thatdespicable man’s crimes.Soon all four were whirling their clubs, destroying one petrified soldier afteranother. The sounds of iron ringing against stone accompanied their shouts andcheers across the otherwise-silent plain. There were so many targets to choosefrom that Bannon did not need to be selective. The petrified enemy ranks seemedendless.He was panting hard, his long ginger hair dripping with sweat. His arms ached,and his wrists were numb from so many blows against unyielding stone. He gaspedfor breath, not happy, but at least purged. He had extinguished some of hisanger, though he wished he could be hurting a worthy enemy rather than oldstatues.Off to his left, far from where the other three were attacking motionlessenemies, Bannon heard an unexpected sound: a groan and then confused words, amale voice that slowly built to a wail.Bannon looked around, seeing only statue after statue, so many warriors fromfifteen centuries ago. Then he spotted movement. One figure from the standingstone ranks shifted. The legs moved. The arms raised up. The moan grew louder.Bannon gripped his iron-tipped club in his left hand, while his right strayed tothe sword at his side. The statue warrior shifted and moved, then collapsed tohis knees. “Ohhhh, what has happened? Ohhhh.”The sound was so plaintive, so desperate that Bannon couldn’t stop himself fromventuring forward. The ancient warrior had some color in his face, though theflesh tone remained gray and pasty, as if dusted with flour. His armor had beenrestored to brass and leather; the flame symbol on his shield was bright red.“Ohhhh.”Bannon paused ten strides away and his heart beat faster. The strange warriorlooked at him through his helmet. They stared at each other, speechless.“You’re awake,” Bannon finally said. “The spell must have worn off.” He lookedaround in alarm at the countless statue warriors, afraid they might all lurchinto motion, but everything else remained still on the plain. The rest ofGeneral Utros’s warriors were white marble.The confused ancient soldier pulled off his helmet, and Bannon saw a young manno more than twenty-five, a fighter from the days of Emperor Kurgan. The irisesof his eyes were gray, but they faded into the whites, as if he was not yetentirely restored from the stone. His short dark hair seemed stiff. He flexedhis arms, slowly. “What happened?” His voice had a strange accent, and he lookedaround at all the statues of his former comrades. “My army … my liege.”Bannon came closer as the wakened warrior hunched his shoulders and shook hishead, utterly miserable. “What happened?”“It was a spell from a long, long time ago,” Bannon said. “Your army came hereduring a war that’s been over for fifteen centuries.”The warrior removed his gauntlets and bent his fingers, reminding Bannon of ablacksmith bending a strip of iron that wasn’t heated enough to be worked. Hisforearms were also chalky, partially stone.“My name is Bannon Farmer. I’m a traveler too, visiting Ildakar.”The warrior’s expression tightened. “Ildakar … we are here to conquer Ildakarfor Iron Fang. General Utros says we must do it because the emperor commandsit.” He heaved a deep breath, which whistled through his mouth and nose. Hischest crackled, as if his lungs were still full of stone dust. “I am Ulrich,tenth-rank foot soldier, and I give my life for Emperor Kurgan.”“Emperor Kurgan is just dust, I’m afraid,” Bannon said.With a groan, Ulrich stood straighter. Bannon didn’t know what to do, but herealized that Nathan would surely want to talk to this man, as would the wizardsof Ildakar. “The war is long over. There’s no need for you to fight. We can takeyou back to the city.”Amos shouted, “What are you doing over there, Bannon?”Bannon waved. “One of the soldiers woke up! The spell faded for some reason.”The three young Ildakarans hurried over. “The spell faded? Keeper’s crotch, howdid that happen?”Ulrich raised his arms as if still struggling to believe he was really awake. “Ican barely move. Please help me.”“We should take him back to the city.” Bannon felt sorry for the ancientsoldier. “He may need medical care, and the historians will want to talk withhim. Won’t the wizard commander need to understand why the spell wore off?”“We’ll bring him to the city,” Amos said, gesturing. “Come, join us.”Bereft and confused, the ancient warrior lumbered after them. “What about myfamily? My comrades?”“They’re all gone,” Amos said. “Be thankful that you’re awake.”“I … don’t understand,” Ulrich said.Bannon reassured him. “We’ll figure it out once we get inside Ildakar. We’llfind you some food.”Perplexed, Ulrich touched his abdomen. “Not hungry … still feels like stone.”They moved at a brisk pace, weaving through the ranks of the statue army backtoward the city’s towering defensive walls. Ulrich looked at the petrifiedfigures, muttering in despair. “Help me get home.”“I doubt your home exists any longer,” Bannon said. “A lot has changed over thecenturies.”Nearing the wall, Amos, Jed, and Brock began to shout, waving their iron-tippedclubs. “Ho, Ildakar! We have an emergency. Ildakar!”By the time they reached the gate, soldiers had gathered for an attack, but theysaw only the four young men and their unexpected companion in the antique armorof the long-defeated troops. Bannon followed Ulrich closely. High Captain Averyarrived at the tall gate, looking at them with a suspicious expression. Headjusted the red pauldron on his shoulder, placed a hand on the hilt of hisshort sword.Ulrich staggered forward, overwhelmed to be so close to the immense city he hadtried to conquer long ago.Bannon said, “High Captain Avery, this is an awakened warrior from the army ofEmperor Kurgan.”Amos pushed forward. “He is an enemy of Ildakar. Seize him and throw him intothe dungeons before he can cause any harm.”Ulrich whirled, confused and betrayed. Bannon was taken aback. “Wait, we weregoing to get him help!”Amos sneered. “Don’t be a fool. This man wanted to conquer Ildakar.” He smiled.“Finally, we can bring one of them to justice. Every person in the city willwant to see it done!”Ulrich looked betrayed, and Bannon realized that he had been tricked as well."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 34 [contents.xhtml#c_ch34]In the ruling tower, Nicci turned at the shouts and commotion. The duma membersrose in alarm from their benches, and even Maxim stood, curious, while Thoraremained ensconced in her chair, as if it would take more than an ordinarycrisis to make her stir from her place.High Captain Avery marched in with a leather-and-steel rustle of his personalarmor. Six city guards escorted a dangerous-looking warrior whose entire bodyseemed bleached, his armor and skin coated with a whitish film. His dark,close-cropped hair seemed dusted with white powder. The prisoner movedsluggishly, staggering under the burden of heavy iron chains draped over hisshoulders and encircling his chest. Avery stared ahead, his expression grim.Nicci could tell he was afraid.Sovrena Thora finally rose to her feet. “What is this?”Recognizing the stylized-flame symbol on the prisoner’s breastplate, Nicciguessed what had happened even before the wizards did.Avery marched up to the dais. “Sovrena, Wizard Commander, one of the petrifiedwarriors awakened. Your son and his friends were among the ranks of stonesoldiers when this one came alive again.”The strange warrior spoke in a deep, heavily accented voice. “My name isUlrich.” He struggled with the chains. “What have you done to my comrades? Whatdid you do to me?”Maxim’s normally cocky expression changed to one of alarm. His face turnednearly as pale as the ancient soldier’s. “The spell wore off? How is thatpossible?”Thora snapped, “What did Amos do? Did our son cause this?”“It seems to have occurred spontaneously, Sovrena,” said Avery. “The young menbrought him to the city gates, where he was seized.”“Wisely,” Ivan said.Fleshmancer Andre did not try to control his curiosity, scuttling across theblue tiled floor. The city guards crowded around the warrior in his antiquearmor, tense and wary, but Andre showed no hesitation. He poked and prodded thearmor, then the man’s exposed cheek. Ulrich grimaced, thrashed his head, andsnapped his teeth as if trying to bite off the fleshmancer’s fingers, but Andrewas nimble and snatched them away. “Skin is stiff and hard, still partiallyfaded.” He looked up. “Good news, Wizard Commander—your spell is only partiallyfaded, hmmm?”“Good news, indeed.” Maxim did not sound the least bit pleased. “Let’s hope itdoesn’t happen again.”Quentin tapped his fingers on the table, accusing Avery. “You bring a fullyarmed enemy into the duma chamber, Captain? Why didn’t you strip him bare?”“We could not remove his armor,” Avery said. “We took away his shield, helmet,and sword, but other parts are still … fused to his skin.”“His skin is still partly stone as well.” Andre rapped his knuckles againstUlrich’s bare arm above the spiked band that wrapped his biceps. “Veryinteresting. It would make him a very tough enemy to kill.” Ulrich flinched,then glared at him, but the fleshmancer did not seem to notice.Chief Handler Ivan slammed a meaty fist against the stone tabletop in front ofhim. “He is an enemy of Ildakar. This man intended to overthrow our city, rapeour women, torture our children.”Damon glanced at the sovrena with a disrespectful sneer. “I always thought yourson and his friends were foolish to go out and vandalize the statues. Now Ithink I understand. Perhaps we should have them do more of it. Send out entirecrews to smash the stone warriors.”“Waste of time,” Quentin muttered. “There are hundreds of thousands…”Still angry, Ivan rose to his feet, his arms bent to show off the bulgingmuscles beneath his panther-hide jerkin. “Turning that army to stone granted usan unprecedented victory, but it failed to give us a modicum of justice. Now wehave one of the enemy in our hands!” He looked around the chamber, scowling atthe confused ancient warrior, who was barely able to stand with the weight ofshackles. “Let’s throw this one into the combat arena and make him fight. All ofIldakar can watch him be torn to shreds.”Nicci spoke up, and they turned to look at her, surprised at the interruption.“Interrogate him first, find out what he knows of General Utros’s plans. This isan unprecedented opportunity.”“For history as well as for the city’s defense,” Nathan said.“Another waste of time,” Quentin said. “How could his knowledge possibly berelevant after so many centuries? Emperor Kurgan is long dead; the army isstone.”“Besides, he is just a foot soldier,” Damon added. “He would know nothing.”From her own experience, Nicci knew that foot soldiers often understood manydetails that others didn’t realize. This ancient soldier would have kept one ofJagang’s interrogators busy for months, and the questioning would not have beenquiet or peaceful. Not only did they need to understand why the spell haddissipated, but she imagined all the intelligence even this mere foot soldiercould provide. To discard him seemed a waste of resources to her.“Ildakar is a peaceful city,” Maxim said. “We know little of torture andinterrogation techniques.” He sniffed. “Better that we use him for somethingelse. Like the arena.”Ulrich stood in his chains, filled with confusion, his face a knot of anger. “Iwill fight whatever you throw against me. I will fight all of you in the name ofIron Fang.”“At least it would be something, hmmm?” Andre said. “I agree with thesuggestion.”“If the petrification spell is faltering, then we may be in great trouble,”Maxim muttered, troubled. He tapped the left corner of his lip as if it helpedhim think. “We have to eliminate this anomaly and make sure the weakness doesn’tspread.” He nodded at the sovrena. “Yes, I agree. Send him into the combat arenafor another great exhibition. Chief Handler, do you have something interestingto throw against him?”“I always do.” Ivan narrowed his hooded eyes, as if the wheels of his mind wereturning.Thora agreed. “Summon the citizens. We will give them a spectacle unlike anythey have seen before.”* * *The hot sun shimmered on the sand of the combat arena. The merchants, tradesmen,gardeners, tailors, and craftsmen dropped their daily work, closed up shops andsmithies, and hurried to see the fight. General Utros had nearly destroyed theircity centuries ago, and that ancient army was more hated than any other. Nowthat one of the stone warriors had broken free of the petrification spell, theywould have a chance to see justice served. They wanted to watch that enemysoldier defeated, slaughtered.Deadly combat had been a part of Ildakaran culture for as long as the city hadexisted, and the people seemed to enjoy it as a release of their increasingfrustrations and anger. Now that Nicci witnessed the tensions brewing among thepopulace, she wondered if this was the duma’s calculated plan to direct unresttoward a specific target and distract them.Nathan followed her into the nobles’ observation tower as the crowds gatheredwith a drone of voices and jostle of bodies. Splashes of colorful fabric andfurs among the wealthier patrons stood in contrast to the drab brown garments inthe lower seats, clearly delineating the classes of spectators.Through the grace of Maxim, Nicci had been invited to sit on one of the highplatforms again. On the other side of the stand, Thora was closely attended byAvery, although not because she needed his protection.Nathan continued his conversation with Andre, but the fleshmancer seemedpreoccupied by this unusual reanimated warrior, no longer thinking aboutrestoring the wizard’s gift. “We will work on it, my dear Nathan. There’s nohurry, hmmm?”The burly Norukai slavers also came to watch the bloody combat. Kor and hismuscular, scarred companions jostled for seats in the lower levels, shovingspectators aside and claiming benches down at the edge of the arena among thelesser workers and unwashed slaves.Sovrena Thora had invited the Norukai to sit among the nobles in the highobservation seats, but Kor spurned the offer. “I want to see the sweat, smellthe blood, and hear every grunt of pain. We might learn something we can bringback to King Grieve. This is the sort of amusement he might like.”Deeply disturbed, Bannon worked his way up to join Nicci and Nathan. “Sweet SeaMother, it’s shameful,” he said in a low voice. “When Ulrich awakened, he waslost and confused, and he asked me for help. Amos lured him to the city wallswith promises, but as soon as we brought him through the gate, the guards seizedhim. He’s going to be killed!”“He is their mortal enemy,” Nicci pointed out, “A warrior from the army thattried to destroy Ildakar.”“That was fifteen centuries ago!” Bannon said. “He’s no threat anymore.”“Maybe not a threat, my boy,” Nathan said, his lips turned down in a frown, “butfor millennia, the people in this city have been seething over Emperor Kurgan’splans to rule the world. They have seen that army of half a million warriorsturned to statues. This is their first opportunity for revenge.”“It’s still not right,” Bannon muttered.“No, it is not,” Nicci agreed. “There is much about Ildakar that isn’t right.”Men in sleeveless tunics hammered on gongs with a crashing metallic clamor thatdrove the spectators into silence.From the top of his high stand, the announcer cried out in a booming voice,amplified by magic, “Today Ildakar will witness an execution, and not an easyone.” The crowd muttered until the speaker drowned them out again. “An enemyfrom the past shall receive the punishment he deserves—the punishment they alldeserve! He will die in our combat arena.”The crowd began to cheer, hiss, and boo, venting their emotions, ratcheting uptheir hatred.Wizard Commander Maxim seemed entertained, while Sovrena Thora was pleased tochannel the citizens’ anger in an appropriate direction. When the spectators inthe lower benches rose up for a better view, the people behind them also had tostand, triggering a ripple of motion throughout the crowd.The Norukai down at the lowest level leaned forward. When one man stood up andgot in Dar’s way, the raider knocked him off the edge. The man tumbled down intothe pit and scrambled back to his feet on the sand. In panic, he gaped at theopening gate and jumped, clawing for the rim, which remained well out of reach.His friends reached down to grab him, hauling him up and out of the way beforethe ancient warrior emerged.The cheering shifted to grumbles as the reawakened warrior marched onto thecombat sands. Ulrich moved sluggishly in his antique lapped armor, which wasstill dusted with gray from stone that had not yet been restored. He held hiscurved sword, which had been returned to him for the fight. He strode into thearena, moving uncertainly. He looked up at the crowds, still disoriented. Theirmutters turned into a chorus of angry threats.Ulrich stepped to the middle of the sands and turned to stare at the highplatform where the wizards sat. He bellowed, “What do you want of me?”“We want you to die, you fool!” said Maxim, and then giggled.Elsa sat next to Nathan, primly holding her hands on her purple skirts. He saidto her, “Where is Chief Handler Ivan? I would have thought he’d want to watchthe combat.”“He is down in the arena,” she said, “where he can manage the beasts.”Remembering the combat bear, Nicci felt a chill. “What beasts?”Down on the sands Ulrich turned as a second gate opened.Nicci stiffened as she saw three tawny and muscular felines. The troka of sandpanthers bounded out onto the fighting field, looking much like Mrra, theirhides branded with spell symbols to make them impervious to magical attacks.The panthers moved forward in a coordinated unit, tails thrashing, lips curledback to expose saberlike fangs. Ulrich planted his booted feet apart and heldhis curved sword, ready to face the feline attackers. The crowd cheered,energized and titillated.Nicci watched the troka split apart. One sand panther approached the targetdirectly, while the other two cats spread out to each side, assessing theirenemy, studying his reactions.Ulrich turned slowly, trying to watch all of them. The flanking pantherscircled, then switched sides while the ancient warrior rotated to protect hisback, then swung back to face the closest panther.“Dear spirits, I know Mrra, but I’ve never seen a troka work together,” Nathansaid. “Is that what attacked you and poor Thistle in the canyons?”“Yes,” Bannon said. “We fought them. We had to.”“We killed Mrra’s sister panthers, but I healed her,” Nicci said. “Her trokamust have escaped from the animal pits here.”“Just like the combat bear,” Bannon said.“Perhaps the animals were intentionally let loose.” Nicci thought aboutMirrormask and his rebels, how they meant to instill chaos, how they had alsofreed other slaves and sent them fleeing into the countryside.Down in the arena, the foremost panther sprang ahead in a frontal attack on theancient warrior. Ulrich brought up his sword and slashed, but the cat dodged andreceived only a scratch. A red stripe of blood stood out on her ribs, not a deepwound. The attack had just been a feint.The impact of a second panther struck Ulrich from the side and sent him reeling.The cat lunged in, raking claws down the warrior’s biceps. In a normal human,such an attack might have ripped his arm off, but the claws left only whitegouges in the grayish skin, which quickly hardened over. The crowd muttered andgasped.Nathan leaned forward, fascinated. “He’s still part stone!”Bannon said, “I think he’s only half recovered from the spell.”Even Ulrich seemed surprised at his invulnerability, looking at the wound. Withgreater anger, he raised his curved sword and brought the pommel down hard onthe sand panther’s flat skull. The crack of the blow resounded throughout thearena.The people cheered, as if they didn’t really know which outcome they preferred.The third panther pounced from behind, slamming into Ulrich and driving himfacedown in the sand. The cat tried to claw his back, raking white gouges downthe armor, which should have been shredded.The second panther bit down on Ulrich’s wrist, dragging his sword arm, but theancient warrior pummeled the cat with a stone-hard fist. The injured cat limpedaway, obviously wounded. Ulrich heaved himself to his feet again as the othertwo panthers closed in, but now they were wary.One of the cats lunged, and the warrior slashed viciously with the short sword,leaving a gash in the tawny fur. Ulrich was damaged, too, his armor broken inplaces, white gouges marking his neck, his arms. But he fought as if heconsidered himself invincible. The battered sand panthers circled out of hisreach.“Such a warrior seems hard to kill,” Nathan observed. “Imagine hundreds ofthousands of them.”The crowd grumbled when the cautious panthers refused to press the attack. Thetroka circled, made tentative advances, then backed off. Nicci felt sorry forthe cats, knowing they had been manipulated by the chief handler to becomekilling animals. The sister panthers were united but confused by this unusualopponent.Finally, another figure strode through the barred gate from which the panthershad emerged, a burly man who wore no armor. Chief Handler Ivan.He walked forward as if he had a hurricane in his veins. For a weapon he carriedan enormous war hammer with a thick shaft and a head a foot wide, weighted withstones and capped with iron on each end. Ivan moved without hurry, letting thehuge mallet swing like a pendulum at his side.Ulrich turned to his new opponent. The wounded panthers kept circling, but theancient warrior ignored them, knowing they had been injured physically, defeatedpsychologically.Ivan let out an animal growl of his own. Without speaking a word, he began tosprint, taking heavy strides, using the giant mallet for momentum.Ulrich raised his curved sword, cocked back his claw-marked arm, but the bladewas laughably small. When Ivan swung the giant mallet, the impact struck thehilt of the sword and broke off the ancient warrior’s entire forearm at thewrist. Ulrich staggered backward and looked down at his stump, which looked likebroken rock that oozed thick strands of red.He roared a hollow, incomprehensible challenge to the chief handler, but Ivanwas impatient, not wanting to continue the sport. As the big man ran forward, hedrew back the mallet, and when it reached the extent of its swing behind him, heput all of his strength into the weighted war hammer. He lifted it up in asmooth arcing motion, timed perfectly so that his last footfalls brought himright up to Ulrich.The massive mallet crashed full into the ancient warrior’s chest—and it was asif a mountain had struck him. The mallet shattered Ulrich, broke his torso,splintered his ribs like kindling, plowed through what would have been hisheart.He collapsed, a mixture of gore and stone, the rubble of what had been a livingbeing.The audience cheered, but Nicci detected an uneasy undertone in their cries.Ivan did not revel in the adulation of the crowd. He stood with the mallet overthe destroyed warrior; then he raised the huge weapon over his head and broughtit down again, obliterating the gray hardened face of Ulrich into the sand ofthe arena.The spell-bonded panthers were pacing, obviously in pain from their wounds. Thechief handler turned from his victim, stretched a hand toward the troka, andreleased his gift. He manipulated the big cats, nudged them, forced them. Allthree snarled and resisted, fighting back. One even made a tentative lungetoward Ivan, but the chief handler grimaced with additional effort, twisted hisfingers, and released a burst of magic. The rebellious sand panther seemedhobbled, forced away. Ivan drove the three animals back through the barred gateand into the pits beneath the arena.“Quite an exciting combat, hmmm?” Andre sounded delighted. He looked to Elsa,Damon, Quentin.“Too bad Renn couldn’t be here to see it,” Elsa said.“He’d better hurry and get back in time,” Maxim said. “Otherwise we may need tofind a new duma member.” He didn’t seem dismayed by the prospect.Bannon hunched in his seat, wrestling with grief and anger. “Ulrich just wantedhelp. We don’t know why he woke up, why the spell wore off.”Nicci looked around the arena, watched the citizens shift and jostle as theydeparted from the stands. She said in an ominous voice, “And that warrior wasonly one of many thousands.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 35 [contents.xhtml#c_ch35]Nicci stood at the ruling tower’s wide observation windows, peering out at theprecipitous drop, which plunged down to the clustered buildings and tangledalleys of the city. The breezes that wandered into the open chamber were cooland crisp.She stood with her back to the gathered duma members, uninterested in theirdroning irrelevant nonsense. The muscles in her back twitched and rippled as ifsome ghostly hand had brushed her. Nicci’s blond hair hung to her shoulders, andher intense blue eyes stared out at Ildakar, focused on what she knew, ratherthan what she saw. The city had not settled down since the previous day’s combatexhibition.Sovrena Thora sat on her high throne like an ice queen. Behind her, a pair ofsilent slaves erected a set of empty songbird cages, while others carried silkennets that held small struggling captives. The hunters delicately extricated thebirds one by one, placing the larks inside the golden cages. They twittered andcheeped in terror, but Thora sat back in her chair with a cool smile. “It isgood to be surrounded by music again, although the others were delicious.”“Crunchy bones,” said the Norukai captain, who wandered about the duma chamber,looking for something to amuse himself. Kor and his comrades had marched intothe ruling tower, uninvited. Taking any available seats, the Norukai lookedbored. Dar announced he had secured a shipment of wine casks and dried Ildakaranfruits, but he still intended to get some freshly butchered yaxen. “Easier cargothan walking meat,” he said.The captain grumbled, scratching the implanted shark’s tooth on the side of hisshaved skull, “But just as expensive.”“And yet you keep coming back to Ildakar whenever our shroud is down,” Maximsaid. “You seem very curious about our city.”“King Grieve is curious, and so we come back,” Kor said. “But I would rather behome on our islands.”Nicci turned from the wide windows. Every time she thought about the Norukai,she wanted to unleash her gift and incinerate these abhorrent beings. She alsowanted to take down the preoccupied and heartless council members and free thepeople, as Mirrormask intended.But she had to find a way that would not be a futile gesture. Nicci wasconfident she would come up with an approach that would free Ildakar.Bannon was off again with his friends, but Nathan joined the group in the rulingchamber for the opportunity to talk with Andre. “Fleshmancer, as there are nocrucial items on the agenda, couldn’t we perhaps go back to your studio? Keepworking to restore my gift?”Andre brushed him aside as if he were a persistent fly. “Right now it’simperative that I study the fragments of the dead stone warrior. What if thewizard commander’s entire spell is fading? We must be concerned.”“My spell is not fading,” Maxim said. “Something has changed in theunderpinnings of the world.”Nicci stepped away from the window. “We told you that already. Lord Rahl causedthe star shift and sealed the underworld for all time. You can see thedifference in the night sky.”“Thank you for your information,” Thora said, her words as sharp as the edges ofbroken glass. “But our solution is obvious.”Nathan unconsciously brushed the green silk of his sleeves. “I’m afraid it’s notobvious to me, Sovrena. What solution did you have in mind?”“We will work our magic from the pyramid. The Norukai have delivered enoughslaves to us, so we should raise the shroud again with all due haste, even if itis just a temporary measure, as before. Then our beloved city will be safe fromthat great army, even if it should awaken.”“An army of statues might not be the worst threat you have to worry about,”Nicci said quietly.Elsa and Quentin looked up, surprised. Chief Handler Ivan picked at hisfingernails with a stubby dagger. “What threat is that?”Uninterested in the discussion, Captain Kor said, “Just keep your damned shrouddown until our ships are away. We plan to stay a few more days.”“Preparations will take time,” Maxim said. “You have plenty of opportunity tocause trouble in Ildakar before you sail back downriver.”Kor, Lars, Yorik, and Dar chuckled mischievously at the invitation.“We’ll still go home with plenty of gold,” Kor said.“And an extra barrel of bloodwine for King Grieve,” Dar added.Nicci looked at Nathan, knowing that neither of them wanted to be bottled up inIldakar for years. But they each still had important work to do here.Interrupting the malaise of the meeting, one of the city guards burst into themain council chamber with a clatter of footsteps. “There’s been another killing!Sovrena, it’s…” He fell silent, sickened.Maxim brushed lint from his black pantaloons. “Murder? Is it those vilemalcontents again?”Tears streamed from the breathless guard’s eyes. “Sovrena, I ran to tell you,but they are just behind me—”A procession hurried up the stairs, marched into the open chamber. Uniformedguards carried a body wrapped in cloaks. Patches of blood were already soakingthrough the silken cloaks that covered the body. The men were somber and shaken.Thora stood tall in front of her throne. Maxim hurried across the blue marbletiles, curious rather than horrified. “And what have we here?” He pulled one ofthe cloaks away to reveal a stained red shoulder pauldron.The first guard’s face was flushed from exertion and fear. “It is High CaptainAvery! He was out on night patrol, and we found his body this morning. It washoisted up in the slave market and left on display.” He choked out his words asThora stepped down from the dais, visibly shaking. “He was stabbed repeatedlywith mirror shards.”Horrified, Thora turned white and removed the silken cloak from the corpse’sface. She stared at Avery’s handsome features, now marred by gashes and driedblood. His eyes had been gouged out, and long crystalline shards had been thrustinto his chest, his throat, his mouth, left there to reflect the pain of hisdying.Thora let out a keening wail. “Nooo!” Her immaculately coiffed hair wafted andher skin seemed to crackle as her fury summoned the magic within her. “Thosesavages must be eradicated.” Grief-struck, she backed away, covering her face.Maxim was flippant. “You will find other lovers, my dear.” He intercepted theguard procession before they could set the body on the marble floor. He shooedthem away. “You will not leave him here, and we will not let his body lie instate as an honored gifted noble.”“But he was the high captain!” said the lead guard.Maxim gave the man a withering frown. “Any guard captain who would let himselfbe killed by street rabble is worthless.”Nicci stepped forward, even though she knew they didn’t want to hear her speakup. “This is a sign of dangerous unrest in your city. You should do somethingabout it, understand why the people would react this way. Let me and mycompanions help, and maybe we can release the pressure before it’s too late.Avery should be the last guard who needs to die.”“Avery didn’t need to die!” the sovrena shrieked.Maxim seemed more amused than horrified. “Ildakar has been a fine and stableplace for many centuries.”Nathan continued to look at the bloody body wrapped in cloaks. “It doesn’tappear to be entirely fine and stable.”Thora wasn’t listening. She shook her head, closed her eyes, and retreated toher raised chair, where she collapsed, weeping.Maxim shot a glance at Chief Handler Ivan. “Feed the body to the arena animals.That way he can at least serve some small purpose other than as a sexualplaything for the sovrena.” He made a vehement gesture, and the unsettled guardshurried out with their bloody burden.Ivan cracked his knuckles. “An excellent suggestion, Wizard Commander. I can useit for training purposes.” As he followed them out, the body left a trail ofblood on the polished blue marble floor.The visiting Norukai looked after the murdered guard captain and seemed to findthe entire scene amusing."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 36 [contents.xhtml#c_ch36]After watching Ulrich slaughtered in the combat arena, Bannon was angry. As hesat in the gathering darkness outside the villa, he remembered how distraughtand confused the ancient stone warrior had looked upon awakening after fifteencenturies. Bannon had tried to help him, as he always tried to help those inneed, but Ulrich was tricked and betrayed.How the audience in the combat arena had cheered! Just as they had cheered whenIan, the champion, also fought for his life in front of the crowd. And the samepeople had watched so eagerly when the Norukai dragged in scores of abusedcaptives to the slave market.Bannon did not belong here in this city; he knew that in his heart. He didn’tunderstand the people of Ildakar, and he just wanted to go away. This was notthe adventure he had been seeking, but he had to stay here until Nathan got theassistance he needed, and until Bannon found a way to free Ian from his longnightmare. Despite promises and reassurances, Amos had done nothing to gain Ianhis freedom. He didn’t seem to care, but Bannon didn’t know what else to do.“You look so glum, my friend!” Amos clapped him hard on the shoulder, startlinghim as he sat outside the villa on a stone bench. “It’s nighttime, when thepleasures of Ildakar come alive.” He flashed a bright grin. His two ever-presentcompanions also came up behind him, dressed in fine fur-trimmed silks of blue,green, and orange.“Come with us,” said Jed. “We’ll distract you.”“I’m not in the mood,” Bannon said. “I’d rather stay in my quarters fortonight.”“You have quarters here because we allow it,” Amos replied sourly, with a hintof a threat. “You tell brave stories of your great battles, but you’re afraid tojoin your new friends? Come, we’re going back to the silk yaxen. Now that youknow what to expect, maybe you’ll have a better time at the dacha.”“Sweet Sea Mother…” Bannon muttered to himself. “I told you that isn’t somethingI’d like to participate in. You go ahead.”“At least accompany us,” Brock prodded. “Look at the beautiful ladies if youdon’t want to touch them. There’s no requirement for what you have to do.”“But you promised you’d help my friend Ian.”Amos grimaced at the reminder. “We will, but not tonight. He’s been here foryears, so there’s no hurry. Now, come with us.”Bannon felt trapped, but he felt trapped by many things in Ildakar. He longedfor when he, Nicci, and Nathan could travel the open countryside again with Mrraloping beside them. Ildakar seemed so crowded, with small spaces, tinydwellings, narrow streets. Now he felt pressure from the three young men staringat him.Maybe he would have a chance to talk more about Ian.… “All right, I’ll go withyou.”Laughing, the young men led the way. Now that they had coerced Bannon to jointhem, they barely bothered to notice him.He let his thoughts wander as they went down the winding streets. He imaginedsomehow breaking Ian free from the training pits and escaping from the city. Thetwo of them could survive out in the hills, find some of the towns or cities notfar from Ildakar. Or, Ian could travel with their group and explore the vast OldWorld, have wondrous adventures … and Ian and Bannon would have a chance torecover their friendship.Brock blurted out, “Maybe we should try a different dacha this time, Amos. Thereare plenty of silk yaxen in the city. Don’t you get tired of the same one?”“The women are bred to be perfect. Why would I tire of perfection? Besides,Melody understands me.” His lips quirked in a sarcastic smile. “As much as thestupid girl understands anything.”Bannon followed them past the crackling blue streetlights and through thelabyrinth of cul-de-sacs and blooming orchards. The hum of crickets provided alow, soothing background. Night moths flitted around, circling the glow of thestreetlights.Amos’s steps grew more jaunty as they approached his favorite dacha. The samedoorman regarded them from his stool. His pot of coins was more than half full.Without a word, he extended the pot so that Amos, Jed, and Brock could each dropa gold coin with a clink into the pile. Bannon fumbled for his money, but thedoorman lifted a hand. “No charge for you, lad.”Amos sniffed. “You turn away paying customers?”“I’m not turning him away. I just know this one won’t do anything that requirespayment.”Bannon looked awkwardly from the doorman to Amos. “I don’t want an argument.”Amos chuckled. “He thinks so little of you.”They pushed their way inside, while Bannon hung back. “Why did you do that?”The doorman scratched his unkempt beard. “The ladies get paid when customers dothings that no one else would want to do. You don’t seem the type, young man,but if you spend much more time with those three, I’ll have to charge you soonenough.” His words sounded sour and disappointed.Wrestling with his knotted stomach, Bannon ducked and went inside. The glowingscarlet lanterns and orange braziers made the place look ominous rather thanromantic. His gaze moved past the divans, the laughing customers, and thefawning but oddly silent women.He saw a hideous scarred face. Two of the Norukai stretched out on the divans,pawing at their chosen women, tearing their garments and grabbing breastswithout bothering to find a private chamber. They drank from goblets ofbloodwine. The women, the victims, made low noncommittal noises that the scarredslavers seemed to interpret as moans of pleasure.Bannon recognized Yorik. “You like that?” the slaver asked the dull-eyed woman,squeezing the breast hard, then tweaked the nipple viciously. The girlwhimpered, but her face wore a frozen smile. Yorik turned to one side and spat.“You don’t even know what you like.”Amos strolled forward with a solicitous smile. “I see you found one of myfavorites. This dacha has the best women, just as I told you on your firstnight.”“They’re adequate,” said the big Norukai. He emptied his goblet and instead ofrefilling it, simply took the bottle and poured the rest of the wine down histhroat. “They don’t fight enough. I like some exercise with my sex. These silkyaxen are so docile, it’s like servicing myself with a corpse.”The comment elicited a round of laughter, though Bannon found nothing funnyabout it. Lars, the other Norukai, sneered at him. “Look, it’s the littlecheeping bird who complains about the innocent and the weak.”Bannon tensed, ready to fight. He wished he had brought Sturdy, because he wouldhave decapitated these two in a single sweep. Before Bannon could burst out anangry retort, Amos interjected. “And where’s Melody, my favorite?” he called tothe other dull-eyed silk yaxen, who were busy with their customers.One curly-haired brunette sidled up to Bannon, clinging to him like a kittenseeking affection, and he felt a chill.“She’s with Captain Kor in a private alcove,” said Yorik. “You can have her whenhe’s done.”Lars laughed. “But you might have a long wait. Unlike the people of Ildakar, weNorukai don’t finish so quickly.”Kor heard his name through the curtain blocking off one of the bedroom alcoves.“Stupid, clumsy whore!” he roared. “Enough, leave me alone.” Bannon heard a slapof flesh against flesh, a scream, then a whimper. The curtains crashed aside,and beautiful Melody, Amos’s favorite, tumbled out and sprawled on the floor.She tried to catch herself, but landed roughly against a table, knocking gobletsover. The other customers scattered.Kor marched out of the privacy alcove, ripping down the hanging curtains. He hadleft his clothes behind, and he was naked and limp, but didn’t seem to mindbeing exposed. His body looked like knotted wood, lined with white scars. Melodyscrambled away from him on her hands and knees, but the Norukai captain wascoming for her.“Here now, Kor,” Amos said, hesitant.The Norukai reached down and grabbed Melody by the throat, lifting her up. Shebit off a scream and fought, struggling, squirming. “That’s more like it … butnot good enough,” Kor said. “Like pleasuring myself with a cow.”“A yaxen,” Amos said, “but prettier.”The burly slaver struck Melody across the face, spraying blood from her lips andprobably knocking teeth loose.“Stop that!” Bannon cried, but his shout was drowned out by the roar of cheersand catcalls.Kor dropped her roughly onto the table, casting her aside. “Waste of money andtime.” He ducked back into the alcove, grabbed his garments, and strode nakedout of the brothel.The other two Norukai looked at the docile women they were fondling. Larsslapped his female companion for good measure, before he and Yorik followedtheir captain out.Bannon rushed to Melody, bending down next to her. She was shuddering andsobbing. “Are you all right?” He touched her face, which was puffy, covered withblood. She would be a mass of bruises, and her throat was an angry red fromKor’s stranglehold. Her filmy dress was torn. “It’s all right. Nothing more willhappen to you.”She looked up at him, but her eyes were flat, holding no recognition. When shespotted Amos, though, she lit up, slid off the table, and crawled toward him.She let out a wordless moan, begging him to comfort her, but Amos just stoodthere. He looked down, planted his foot against her shoulder, and kicked heraway with a disgusted sound. “Now you’re all bruised! Next time I want you, itbetter be very dark in here, so I can’t see how ugly you are.”Jed and Brock looked disappointed. “There are other silk yaxen. We’ll finddifferent ones. Come on, Amos, stay here,” Brock said. “Keeper’s crotch, wedon’t want to waste our evening, too.”Shaking with anger and hatred, Bannon stood. He had Melody’s blood on his hands,and he flexed his fingers, appalled by what he had seen, not just from thedisgusting Norukai, but from his supposed friends as well. Bile rose in histhroat, and tears stung his eyes. Melody didn’t seem to care.For years his own father had abused both him and his mother, had stolen themoney Bannon had saved so he could escape from Chiriya Island. That man haddrowned helpless kittens just to hurt his son, and had beaten Bannon’s mother todeath.Those memories nearly blinded Bannon as he staggered outside past the doormanand lurched into the darkened streets. He had heard tales of the ruthlessEmperor Jagang, and Sulachan, and Darken Rahl. In his mind, all abusers werehateful and evil, just to varying degrees."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 37 [contents.xhtml#c_ch37]The beasts came in a variety of forms, a full range of killing machines. ChiefHandler Ivan admired the creatures even as he twisted them, tortured them …trained them.Wearing his jerkin made from the pelt of a sand panther he had been forced tokill during a session five years earlier, he inhaled the rich musky smell of thepens. All of Ivan’s animals were kept near the training pits in barred cavealcoves or exterior cages. In one breath, he could smell their fur and theirhatred.One large swamp lizard spotted him, its golden eyes slitted, and a forked blacktongue flicked in and out of its fanged jaws. As Ivan stopped to stare at it,the lizard released a pool of urine across the bottom of its cage. Reaching outwith his gift, Ivan felt the hateful intent there, the spite this creature heldfor him.Good. Such things could be developed, nurtured. Releasing a barbed stinger ofmagic, he slashed pain into the reptile’s tiny brain, making the thing snarl andwrithe. It released even more urine, involuntarily this time. Ivan smiled at thereaction. That was what his gift as chief handler was meant to do. These beastshad to be kept under control—his control—but their violence and anger needed tobe banked and kept hot, like the fire in a blacksmith’s forge. Ivan was good atthat, better than any of his three apprentices.He pulled his bloody cart through the wide tunnel between the cages and barredpens. The wheels creaked and wobbled, slightly out of round, jostling thecontents so that the fresh smell of torn meat and dripping blood wafted into theair. He grabbed a strip of raw, red muscle peeled from a rib cage and tossed itto the brutish swamp lizard. Forgetting about the pain Ivan had just inflictedupon it, the reptile scuttled forward and snapped up the morsel.Feeding time was legitimately the work of his lowliest apprentices, but Ivanenjoyed the routine. He used it as an important method of provocation, reward,and deprivation. Every act was reinforced by a bolt of pain from his gift, aprodding jab that pushed against their sensitive nerves to make them understandwho was their master.He pulled the rendering cart to the next cage, gauging how much meat he stillhad to distribute. He had left the preparation work to slaves. They had strippedthe garments from High Captain Avery’s body and returned the armor to the guardheadquarters so the blood could be scrubbed off the metal scales and leather,before the armor was given to some other recruit.Then the renderers had chopped up the man’s body, using axes and cleavers tobreak the limbs from the joints, to cut off hands and feet, legs, arms, head.They had piled the internal organs into separate buckets, which Ivan would useas special treats for the pets that impressed him most.With a rumbling growl, a huge black-furred beast slammed into the cage in frontof him with such force that the bars rattled and the hinges groaned. Raisingitself ten feet tall, a combat bear rose up, reaching a paw through the bars.The beast had a square face with close-set obsidian eyes. It opened its jaws,and ribbons of silvery drool poured out. Parts of its body wore armor shellsgrafted on to protect its vital organs. The combat bear’s enhanced claws scrapeddown the bars of its cage, striking sparks.Ivan stood within inches of the beast’s grasp and laughed. “You’re daring. Youhate me, don’t you?” He moved just within reach.The bear snarled, its eyes focused on him like sparks in a forge.“I’m right here.” Ivan stepped even closer. Just as the bear lunged toward him,he released his gift, sent a shock wave down the monster’s spine. The combatbear roared and retracted its arms, reeling backward. Surprisingly, it foughtthe pain and slammed into the bars, again swiping at him.Ivan had to dance out of the way. “Good, good!” As a special reward, he removedAvery’s liver and tossed the purplish-red handful at the bear. With one lastglower at its tormentor, the beast devoured the bloody organ.Ivan went to the other cages, selecting portions of the dead guard captain: athigh, an arm. He tossed the head into a cage where five starving spiny wolvesfought over the handsome man’s head, ripping it to pieces.Ivan enjoyed the days when he could give his pets treats to prepare them for thecombat arena. It insured that they all had a taste for human flesh, which wouldmake them better attackers in front of a cheering audience.Last, saving some of the choicest meat and the heart, Ivan stopped in front ofthe pen that contained his troka of spell-bonded panthers. The three female catsdid not approach the bars, but kept their distance and watched him from the backof the lair. The low growls sounded almost like purrs in their throats. Theirtails thrashed. They looked at him with clear malice in their eyes.These panthers were still sore from the fight against Ulrich, he could tell.When they fought the partially petrified warrior, they had been injured, butworse, they had been defeated for all to see. Ivan was disappointed in them, andhe had punished them afterward by jabbing their brains with his gift, findingand pressing their pain centers.Somehow, though, the more he used his power in an attempt to hurt them, shapethem, control them, the more the troka seemed to resist. The three spell-bondedpanthers had a link that made them feel one another’s pain, share one another’sthoughts. When he poked one with a burst of pain, all three felt it … but thetroka found a way to distribute the agony to allow them to endure more. Theycould share their strength.Ivan was troubled. He could not allow this to spread. He did not want his giftto fade away like that of the impotent wizard who had come from the outside.He could smell their hatred, their anger. But no fear. Even after all the painhe had inflicted, the cats did not cringe when they saw him. Instead, they satdefiant, refusing to come closer, despite the smell of the fresh meat. They werewary, but not intimidated. Ivan was worried, but could not let it show.He lifted the last pieces of High Captain Avery, the haunch and the redcopper-smelling heart. “Regain your strength. You’ll need to fight soon.”He tossed the offerings into the cage, but all three panthers remained at therear, not moving. Ivan frowned. He had never seen such behavior before. “Eat!”he roared, and the panthers roared back at him, sending a chill down his spine.He took a step backward, staring at them, and they stared back. He felt the giftwhipping and twisting inside him like a night crawler exposed after a downpour.The cats didn’t move toward the meat. Ivan stepped close to the bars. “If youdon’t want it, then you can starve. I’ll take it back.” When he reached for thelock on the cage door, he saw all three sand panthers coil slightly, tense andready. Their golden eyes flashed, fixed on him, and he froze.Was this their plan? Did they mean to trick him into opening the cage door, sothey could tear him apart the moment he entered?Ivan had always controlled them before … but considering the way they resistedhim, maybe they would not be deterred this time. Maybe they would resist hiscontrol just long enough to drive him to the ground, rake their claws across histhroat, dig their curved fangs into his gut, and tear him open.He stood at the bars for a long moment, not moving, assessing. The sand pantherskept staring, and Ivan slowly backed away. “Not this time,” he said. “I am yourmaster. Don’t you forget it.”He stalked away, pulling the empty rendering cart with its squeaky wooden wheelsbehind him."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 38 [contents.xhtml#c_ch38]Anxious for answers, Nathan followed the fleshmancer, wanting to be done withhis weakness, ready to do anything so he could have his gift back, if only tofight alongside Nicci in rebuilding lldakar. Failing that, at least he wouldhave achieved his reason for coming here. To be made whole again …And Andre seemed to be his best source for solving the problem.Originally, the fleshmancer had been intrigued by the loss of Nathan’s gift, yethe was easily distractible and left many things half finished. Now, instead ofheading to his laboratory studio, the fleshmancer led him through the beautifulgarden streets toward the towering pyramid at the top of the plateau.“We are going to join the sovrena and the wizard commander in theirpreparations,” Andre said. “It is almost time to raise the shroud again.”Nathan felt queasy as he walked along. As usual, he wore the copper-trimmedgreen robes Ildakar had given him, though he might have felt more comfortable inhis travel clothes—tight black breeches, ruffled shirt, and a cape thrown acrosshis shoulders so that he cut a dashing figure.Reaching the base of the pyramid, Andre climbed the stone stairs with a jauntystep, one level after another, calling back to Nathan, “Better hurry. Thora andMaxim tend to be impatient, hmmm?”One level below the top, the platform held a new fenced area, flimsy barricadesof metal crossbars. “That looks like a corral,” Nathan remarked. “For wildbeasts or livestock?” Sacrificial animals, he assumed.Andre raised his eyebrows. “Livestock … yes, I suppose so. How else would wework the blood magic to project the shroud?”“I don’t know,” Nathan said, then muttered, “Dear spirits, I may not wish toknow.”The wizard commander and the sovrena toiled together under the bright morningsunlight. Perfect prisms stood erect on silver poles, shattering sunlight intorainbows. Maxim adjusted the crystals, rotating them so that the multicoloredrays fell upon a huge mirrored bowl turned toward the sky.Thora glanced up at them as they arrived. Her face was drawn, her eyes shadowedwith grief after the recent murder of High Captain Avery. Maxim seemed cheery,though. “Much work to do! We could use your help.”“We are here,” Andre said. “Simply guide us.”“What is this blood magic about?” Nathan asked. “I am willing to help protectIldakar, but what is the cost, and how can I help you accomplish it?”The sovrena’s face turned brittle. “You have no gift, Nathan Rahl. You cannothelp us in any way.”“Now, now, I want him to observe what we do,” Andre said. “He was once a greatwizard. It can be an intellectual exercise for him, hmmm? If nothing else, hecan assist in the manual labor.”“I suppose we could use a slave or two,” Maxim said, “and our real slaves refuseto do it, because they know what the bloodworking entails.”Nathan knew he had to walk a fine line. He couldn’t offend these people if heexpected them to help him regain the heart of a wizard … unless the way to makehimself whole again was through another means. Maybe the witch woman’sdeclaration meant that he had to fight to defend the innocent and downtroddenhere in Ildakar, as Nicci suggested. But first he had to be sure.“Tell me more about the process,” Nathan said. “How do you raise the shroud?”“It is blood magic.” Thora sounded exasperated. “How can you claim to be awizard and not know about blood magic?”“The methods of magic are different where I come from,” Nathan said guardedly.“I was taught by the Sisters of the Light. The gift is the gift, and my Han ismy own. Ildakar seems to have another approach to things.”“Right now you have no Han whatsoever,” Maxim said with a capricious snicker.“But we will use your help if we can find a way. Perhaps when it is time, we’llhave you corral the new arrivals.”Nathan glanced down from the top of the pyramid, saw the empty spell-inscribedcorrals on the platform below. “You mean the slaves?”“We may as well use the new ones,” Thora said.“We will need only a dozen or so to work the traditional spell and restore theshroud temporarily,” Maxim said. “That’s all we require for now. The majorworking will take much more preparation, but there’s no need to be rash.”“Twelve of the new slaves?” The answer pounded in front of Nathan’s mind, but herefused to accept it. “You intend to sacrifice them.”Maxim peered down into the rune-etched mirror bowl that rested in an armillarystand in the middle of the pyramid platform. “Magic comes at a cost, and bloodpays the price. We will use the lives of those expendable people to preserve ourcity.”“Why do you object, hmmm?” Andre asked. “We may as well use raw slaves insteadof well-established workers. Why waste time and effort training them? We’ll shedtheir blood and pour it into the rune cauldron, which will reflect its magic ina spiraling web of Han that creates our shroud.”Nathan’s nostrils flared. “So, in order to camouflage your city, you must slayinnocent people.”“Only a dozen for now, and they aren’t even citizens of Ildakar.” Maxim gave awistful smile. “Ah, you should have seen the terrible cost when we petrifiedUtros’s army. We had to sacrifice nearly a third of our citizenry, virtually allof the lower classes! It took centuries to rebuild the population to a stablelevel.” He cracked his knuckles. “But it worked. Ildakar is preserved, while thehorrendous enemy army is nothing more than statues.”“Except for Ulrich,” Nathan muttered.The wizard commander dismissed it. “With hundreds of thousands of soldiers outthere, we can accept one or two exceptions without growing too concerned.”As he looked at the apparatus, Nathan thought he now understood the purpose ofthe basins and the coated troughs that fed into spell-forms, patterns woven intothe pyramid itself. “And is it necessary?”The fleshmancer frowned. “I have worked hard on your behalf, Nathan. You askedme to understand your problem and you begged me to learn how to restore yourgift.” He narrowed his eyes. “Are you going to be afraid of that cost, too?”Nathan felt torn, as a chill ran down his spine. In order to regain his gift,what exactly would he be willing to sacrifice? The magic had defined him for solong. His gift of prophecy had led to his imprisonment by the Sisters for athousand years, but the magic was even more a part of him. He had learned how tolive his life, to be the person he wanted to be before his gift had unraveled.Was Nathan willing to sacrifice the core of his being in order to have thatagain? After the selka attack aboard the Wavewalker, when the gift had abandonedhim, Nathan had discovered how to defend himself, how to be himself. Was it soimportant to go back to something he had already learned how to live without?Andre blew air through his lips. “Don’t look so disturbed, Nathan. I simplymeant to give you food for thought. I am confident you’ll soon have your powersback, and you’ll be a true wizard of Ildakar.” He grinned, showing off hisbright teeth. “The shroud will cover the city, and everything will once again beright with the world.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 39 [contents.xhtml#c_ch39]Bannon had nothing in common with Amos and his companions; he realized that now,and he doubted they would ever follow through on their assurances of helpingIan. He thought of the bright and heady times on Chiriya Island with hischildhood friend … and yes, he truly meant friend. He and Ian had so muchlaughter together, so much fun. Until the day the Norukai had taken him captivein their secret cove.Ian—even the scarred and embittered champion in the combat pits—still must havethat spark of friendship deep within the young man’s heart, if Bannon could justfind it. But for that, he needed help from important people in Ildakar. NeitherNicci nor Nathan could demand the freedom of a slave—particularly not a renownedchampion. Bannon had to keep trying.And that brought him back to Amos, Jed, and Brock. He felt as trapped as any ofthe prisoners in the training pits.Looking at Bannon, Amos quirked his dark lips in an unpleasant smile. “If youneed our help with the champion, come with us. We’re going to find Chief HandlerIvan. He’ll be delighted to hear your request.”Bannon felt a thrill of unrealistic hope. “Truly?” He knew not to believe Amos’smotives, but for someone with no hope whatsoever, even a false hope was worthclinging to. He remembered his bright image of the world, his dream of a placewhere people helped one another, where bloodshed and darkness were washed awayby kindness and good hearts.A false and ridiculous picture, he knew. Nicci had made that very clear when sheforced him to see that his nostalgia was merely a scab that covered festeringmemories. But now he had scars instead of wounds, and he had become a muchstronger person.He needed that strength now. For Ian. “Yes, I’ll go with you.” Ivan intimidatedhim, but he would make his case.“You won’t be disappointed,” Jed said, and his two companions reflected the samesharp smile. Bannon was aware that as an ungifted swordsman he would always bethe butt of their jokes. They had no respect for him, and he had little respectfor them. But for the same reasons that Nathan was forced to spend time withFleshmancer Andre, Bannon needed these three—at least until he found more worthyfriends.They descended to the lower levels of the city, ignoring the bustle of businessin the streets, the slaves and merchants who brought goods up to where thegifted nobles lived. “Are we going back to the combat arena?” he asked. “I’veseen the cages where the chief handler’s animals are held.”“No, today he’ll be in the market,” Jed said. “Just follow us.”Bannon pictured a colorful and vibrant bazaar in one of the numerous squareswith fountains and performance stands, unlike the slave market that seemedstained with years of blood and pain. He imagined farmers who harvested theircrops from the dense terrace gardens, using every scrap of fertile land inIldakar. He pictured vintners offering bottles of wine, olive sellers with greatclay urns mounded high with black and green olives, glistening with brine.But that was not at all where they took him.Instead, chatting among themselves and snickering about things that meantnothing to Bannon, they made their way toward open areas with warehouse-sizedbuildings and large corrals. He heard the miserable lowing and animal groanseven before he smelled the stench. The air was thick with the clotted smells ofmanure, urine, buckets of shed blood, and bestial fear.“Chief Handler Ivan always comes to the yaxen butcher yards at midweek,” Amosexplained. “He gets a good price for the entrails and the waste scraps for hisanimals before the rest is rendered down and fed to the slaves.”Bannon felt ill.Drivers led plodding yaxen down the wide streets toward the corrals. The big,shaggy animals shuffled along in misery. He could hear the panicked cries of thebeasts as they were led into the butcher houses. The yaxen looked at him witheerily humanlike faces, sagging mouths and stubby horns protruding from theirforeheads. Their large dark eyes were wet with terror. He felt they were begginghim to save them, but he could do nothing.From inside a wooden building the size of a barn, he heard the sounds ofslaughter, the wet hard thump of mallets, then the hacking of blades and saws.The wooden planks of the butcher house walls had numerous gaps and knotholesthat allowed glimpses of the death inside.A burly shirtless man wearing a blood-spattered apron over his large stomachstrolled out of the doorway. The scarf across his mouth was covered with redspeckles. In his left hand he held a heavy iron-tipped mallet. He strode intothe corral, grabbed one of the yaxen, and tugged it by the horns. The beaststruggled, but the butcher’s biceps bulged as he hauled the animal inside thedark doorway to its noisy and hopeless death.Bannon saw Chief Handler Ivan standing at the outer corral fence, wearing hisdistinctive panther-skin jerkin. He dickered with a clerk who wore the businessrobes of an esteemed nobleman, though his clothes were likewise spattered withfresh blood. After Ivan handed coins to the man, slaves came forward, wrestlingbarrels full of glistening organs, entrails, and scraps of fatty hide.Ivan directed the sullen slaves toward a cart, careful not to approach the mess.He chastised them as they jostled one of the overfull barrels. “Don’t soil mygarment. I don’t want to kill another sand panther so I can have a replacementhide.” A rope of yaxen tripe flopped out against the slats.Bannon winced as he heard a loud, wet crack from inside the butcher house,followed by a sound like something heavy being tumbled to the ground. Then moreterrified sounds filled the silence.Amos waved. “Chief Handler, we’ve come to see you on behalf of our friend.”Ivan turned away from the clerk with a dismissive gesture. When he noticedBannon, his expression showed little interest, only a frown. “I’ve seen himbefore. Why does he interest me?”“I-I think maybe you can help me,” Bannon said.“Help you?” The chief handler laughed with all the humor of a cruel man seeingan old woman trip and fall. “You have to convince me you’re not worthless beforeI’d consider even listening to you. Maybe you can play with my animals.” Hesmiled as the idea occurred to him. “Can you fight? You could work with myapprentice handlers.”“I can fight,” Bannon said defiantly. He wished he had brought Sturdy with him.“But I’m here to talk to you about the combat arena. My friend Ian—the champion.We grew up together, but he was captured by—”As he saw three hideous figures approaching, the words dried up in Bannon’sthroat, like delicate blossoms in a drought. Captain Kor and two Norukaicompanions strolled to the slaughter area, wearing their gray-scaled vests.Bannon’s lips curled, and he muttered, “Sweet Sea Mother, why would thoseinhuman creatures come here?” He snorted. “No doubt drawn by the smell ofblood.”Ivan inhaled a deep breath and threw back his shoulders. “Yes, exhilarating,isn’t it?”Kor strode over, scratching the scar on his left cheek, accompanied by Yorik andLars. By comparison, Chief Handler Ivan looked almost handsome. “So this is thesource of that delicious meat,” said the Norukai captain. “I’m here to purchasefresh slabs to bring with us when we sail away. We’ll depart soon.”Bannon knew they would come back before long with more slaves. He felt heatthrobbing in his face as he flushed with anger.The blood-spattered clerk bustled forward, intercepting the Norukai. “I canfacilitate that, Captain. As you see, the meat is very fresh, and we have giftedbutchers who can work preservation spells, so the meat will be fresh and juicywhen you cook it back in your Norukai islands.”Lars and Yorik nodded, and their expressions seemed eager, though their truefeelings were difficult to read, due to the scars on their faces. “If we payextra, could we slaughter them ourselves?”“Why, of course,” said the clerk. “We have an assortment of slaughtering tools.”“We have our own weapons,” Kor said.“And we need more kegs of bloodwine,” Yorik interjected. “I don’t know whathappened to Dar. He was supposed to arrange for the shipment.”Kor turned his needle gaze back to Ivan. “Our companion Dar has not been seen inthe past day. He vanished in your city, and we have to find him before we sailoff.”As he watched these men, Bannon felt the hatred inside him coming to a boil likea thick and poisonous stew. If they hadn’t stolen Ian as a boy, then Bannonwouldn’t be here begging to get him released. All those years his friend hadsuffered … He clenched his hands, ignored Amos and his companions. Bannonloathed the Norukai for what they had done, not just to his friend, but to allthe other slaves dragged into the Ildakar market, as well as the even fresherwound of seeing how Kor had abused Melody at the silk yaxen dacha.As emotions boiled up within him, before he could stop himself, Bannon blurtedwith a provocative sneer, “Your friend can’t be hard to find. The Norukai are sougly.”The three slavers turned toward him, surprised at the insult.Bannon’s rage sharpened his words like a whetstone. “Or maybe someone killed himand threw him off the cliffs into the river. We could test the waters for poisonand see if his body is down there contaminating the swamps.”Yorik and Lars bunched their arms, reaching for their weapons. Kor snorted andlooked at Amos. “Why do you tolerate this insulting weakling? Is this thehospitality we receive from Ildakar after we brought you a valuable cargo?”Amos said quickly, “He doesn’t speak for the wizards’ duma. He is also a guesthere.”“He’s an unworthy guest,” Lars said.“I am more worthy than your whole nation combined,” Bannon said, feeling the redanger controlling him, just like when he went into his maddened fighting state.“I have more honor than any Norukai could imagine. You are leeches.” His righthand twitched, longing for his sword, which wasn’t there.Yorik spat a long stream of saliva coupled with a glob of phlegm that struckBannon full in the face.Like a crossbow bolt being released, Bannon threw himself forward, unleashinghis pent-up anger. He was on Yorik, pummeling the man’s ugly face, but theNorukai drew back his well-muscled arm and punched Bannon hard on the side ofthe head. He reeled back, and Yorik slugged him on the chin.Bannon lost himself in the fight, attacking the slaver again.Captain Kor and Lars both got into the brawl, all three of them piling onBannon, beating him so hard that his ears rang. Though he fought and clawed, theNorukai overpowered him, threw him to the ground. His outcries were louder eventhan the miserable yaxen being led to slaughter.With heavy boots they kicked him in the side, and he felt his ribs crack. Thewind whooshed out of him, but he kept fighting. From the ground, he lashed outat their legs.In the back of his mind, he thought of how a group of thugs had robbed him inthe alleys of Tanimura. They’d knocked him senseless before Nicci rescued him.But the beautiful sorceress wasn’t going to rescue him this time. Bannon keptthrashing, and the Norukai pounded him, bruised him, made blood spray out of hisnose and mouth.Eventually, his supposed friends, Amos, Jed, and Brock, pulled the Norukai away.Chief Handler Ivan glared down at Bannon, who could only see through swolleneyes in a fog of blood and anger.“This man has insulted the proud Norukai,” said Kor. “He must be punished.”“He looks punished enough,” Brock said. “Or would you like to have a few moreminutes with him?”Amos said, “On behalf of the wizard commander and the sovrena, I promise we’lltake care of this matter. Bannon Farmer is a guest, but the Norukai are far moreimportant. We’ll think of something to do with him.”Ivan grunted. “He said he was a fighter. Let me take him to the combat pits.Adessa will want him—to give her warriors practice, if nothing else. If thatfails, we can feed him to my animals.”Ivan yelled for slaves, and Bannon was dimly aware of several bodies clusteringaround him, reaching down to grab his arms and legs, lashing them together sothat he couldn’t struggle. The broken-glass pain was so great he could barelymove.“No…” he groaned as they lifted him off the ground. He blinked, twisted hishead, and his gaze met a smug-looking Amos. “Help me.…” The other young manremained unmoved. Bannon cried out again, his voice no louder than a croak.“Tell Nicci and Nathan. Let them know! They’ll help.”Amos crossed his arms over his chest. “Of course we will, my friend. Don’t worryabout it. We’ll resolve the problem.”Bannon fought with the last shreds of his consciousness, and he lost the battle.As he drifted into blackness, he saw Amos and his companions turn away, flashinga smirk and a nod toward the chief handler."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 40 [contents.xhtml#c_ch40]As clouds scudded across the sky, the wizards of Ildakar began to makepreparations in earnest to raise their protective shroud. Their ritual wouldtake place within two days, and at least a dozen of the new slaves delivered bythe Norukai would be killed.Nicci intended to discover a way to stop it before it was too late.Nathan returned from Andre’s twisted studio, disheartened while the fleshmancerwas simply matter-of-fact. “You need the heart of a wizard, but I have none togive you,” Andre said. “Be patient; there will come a time. Plenty of time,hmmm?”“But you intend to raise the shroud again,” Nathan said. “We’ll be trappedinside.”Andre’s bald forehead furrowed with surprise. “Trapped? We would consider itprotected. You have a very dark view of the world, my friend. Under our shroudof eternity you need not feel threatened by the outside world.”Nicci accompanied the two men as they entered the ruling chamber, caught in herown thoughts. The night before, she had slipped out into the dark streets again,seeking Mirrormask’s representatives, but found no one to talk to. She felttensions brewing in the city, a simmering undercurrent of anger. She was surethe rebels would attempt something soon, and she wanted to participate. With hergift, she would be a powerful ally to their cause.Mirrormask and his representatives must be watching her, but they made nocontact.Jagang had been willing to sacrifice countless thousands of foot soldiers, usingsheer numbers to score tiny victories … until those small victories added up tocomplete conquest. Seeing the strength of the shroud spell, as well as thepetrification magic that had frozen the army of General Utros, she knew howpowerful were the wizards of Ildakar, but no one was truly invincible. Sheherself had killed Emperor Jagang.If Nicci played her hand right, and if Mirrormask was the positive leader shehoped, Ildakar would see the error of its ways.Jostling one another, paying no attention to the guards in the tower, CaptainKor and his two Norukai companions pushed their way forward into the rulingchamber. Kor made no bow of respect or other recognition of Ildakaran authority.“We intend to depart. The cargo we purchased has been delivered by platform downthe bluff face and stowed aboard our serpent ships. Our crew is restless andready to go downriver to the estuary and back to the open sea. Your city is toofine and decadent. We can feel ourselves growing softer each day.”“We thank you for your business,” Maxim said, “and we welcome open trade, shouldyou return.…”Thora cut him off. “Ildakar may not be here. Once we raise the shroud, we willsearch for ways to make it permanent, in order to be at peace again. Corruptionfrom the outside has caused much damage to our pristine society. With the shroudin place and everyone where they can be accountable, we’ll have centuries tohunt down Mirrormask and exterminate every one of his followers, like beetlesunder an overturned rock.”Kor, Lars, and Yorik chuckled gruffly. “We wouldn’t miss you either, if you wereto vanish forever. Though we have told King Grieve about this city and he wishesto see it.”“Then he’d best live long,” Thora said.Kor stepped forward, the shark’s tooth sticking out on his shaven scalp. “Beforeour ships depart, one of our men is missing. Dar disappeared two days ago. Whereis he?”“Keeper’s beard,” Maxim said in disgust, “why should we keep account of yourmen? We hear he frequented the silk yaxen. Have you searched the dachas? Maybeyou’ll find him drunk in an alley. He certainly had a fondness for bloodwine atour banquets.”“Or maybe he had his throat slit, accosted by robbers in the darkness,” Koraccused.Thora’s porcelain face flushed with pinpricks of red. “I am offended by yoursuggestion. Such a thing could never happen in our fine city. We have no crimehere, no robbery. Everyone is happy here and content.”Despite the seriousness of the charge, the three Norukai chuckled with sarcasticlaughter. “Perhaps you’ve never set foot in your own city, Sovrena. Every placehas its element of malcontents who must be put in their places.”“Not Ildakar.” Thora bit off her words as viciously as if she were tearingroasted flesh from a bone.“I’m sure dear Captain Avery might disagree,” Maxim said.Nicci spoke up in a chill voice, “If your man Dar was so weak he could beaccosted by street rabble, then perhaps he was no Norukai after all.”Captain Kor spun to look at her with a dead black gaze and then pounded thecenter of his chest as if to cough loose a trapped morsel of food. He laughed.The other two Norukai laughed with him, their loose jaws clacking together.“The pretty sorceress has a point.” Kor snorted. “Very well, enough about theman. He can be replaced.” The Norukai turned, adjusting their weapons at theirwaists. “Our boats are loaded, and it’s time to go downriver. Maybe we’ll seeIldakar again.” He glanced at the wizard commander and the sovrena, then passedhis gaze over the duma members. “Or maybe we will not. I won’t mourn eitherway.”* * *At the end of the day, Nicci and Nathan went to the edge of the steep bluffshigh above the Killraven River. She had not seen Bannon since the previous dayand assumed he was with his friends.They watched the setting sun spill a crimson afterglow on the wide river as theNorukai serpent ships raised their midnight-blue sails and moved downriver,leaving Ildakar alone but not at peace."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 41 [contents.xhtml#c_ch41]Across the trackless wilderness, far from Ildakar, the wizard Renn felt lost andimpatient. As day after hopeless day went by, he began to falter in hisconfidence. He used the focus of his gift to calm himself and fight back hisdespair. Captain Trevor led the way with his contingent of twelve city guards,but Renn was not convinced they knew where they were going either.They had set off from the city with great fanfare, bearing purple banners thatdisplayed the sun-and-lightning-bolt symbol. Ever since the shroud had firstdissipated nearly two decades ago, opening the ancient city to the outside forthe first time in fifteen hundred years, Ildakarans had encountered occasionaltravelers and curiosity seekers. The infrequent visitors came from the towns inthe hills and down the river, and the city even engaged in trade with theNorukai in their serpent ships.But few from Ildakar had ventured far from the city. They lived in their utopia,convinced of their sheltered perfection. Dozens of slaves had run away when theshroud first went down, but few of them knew how to live in the wild. Some oftheir bodies had been found out on the plains, gaunt and starving, dead fromsnake bites or exposure. Others made it away, no doubt thanks to the meddling ofMirrormask, but the official story in the city was that no escaped slave hadsurvived. No one bothered to go look for them.The wizards’ duma simply had no curiosity about the outside. Ildakar had beenbottled up for fifteen centuries, and it was self-sufficient. The people had noneed for the outside world. In fact, most of them—Renn included—had no interestin what lay out there. They wouldn’t admit it, but even the greatest wizardsfeared what the world might have to offer. Hundreds of thousands of EmperorKurgan’s petrified soldiers were a testament to that.But now, Renn had been sent out into the grim wilderness with Captain Trevor andhis escort to find a lost and possibly fictitious archive of precious lore.Cliffwall.“A fool’s errand,” the portly wizard muttered to himself. Renn had his owndisagreements with the council members, though not to the extent of Lani’sbitter feud, centuries ago. He had seen the punishment imposed upon thatrebellious sorceress, whose statue stood as a grim reminder in the rulingchamber. No, that would not happen to him.Renn had never really wanted to be a member of the duma. He did not covet power,although he did enjoy finer things: the best furniture, the greatest carvings,the most elaborate villa, the largest gardens, the most docile and efficientslaves, the best chefs, the most stylish clothes.Now he swatted at a biting fly attracted to his glistening sweat. How he missedhis home.Glancing over his shoulder, he looked longingly at the ridgeline behind him. Hecould no longer even see the city of Ildakar. Too far away … infinitely faraway. He wasn’t sure he would ever get back there. This entire quest might justbe an excuse for the wizard commander and the sovrena to rid themselves of Rennbefore they raised the shroud again. If so, he would never be able to get backinside.Was that what they really wanted to do?He trudged forward, thrashing grasses out of his way. One of the guards used ashort sword to hack at the spiny thistles that grew on the hillsides.“Cliffwall must be just beyond that rise,” said Trevor. His voice was rough andragged, but he put energy in it as if to convince himself. Trevor longed to beback in Ildakar as much as Renn did, but they had their orders. “They said KolAdair was over a few ridges, and we have been traveling for a long time.”“It has been five days,” Renn said as he swatted at another biting fly. “I’vekept track.”Crossing the plain, they had walked through line after line of the macabrestatue soldiers turned to stone by Maxim’s grand spell. Renn remembered thatday, fifteen centuries ago. He had been a young man when it happened … and, oh,the blood that had been spilled to work the magic. Thousands executed to pulltogether a tapestry of magic powerful enough to freeze those enemies in time. Heremembered the wizards building the original shroud, a bubble that sealedIldakar away from time and from history. Costing almost as much blood, thatgreat spell had twisted reality so that the passage of days and weeks in thevicinity might be entirely different from how time was perceived far away, orwithin the city itself.Renn shuddered. Such questions made him feel lost, and he just wanted to gohome. The mountains around him were rugged and fearsome, and his couragequailed. He knew in his heart that they still had a long, long way to go.The expedition toiled over the ridge and down into an intervening valley. On thesixth day, they found a crumbling old road that had dwindled to a weed-strewnpath. They followed it, winding up to an even more imposing mountain range, andas they came around an outcropping, they stopped to stare at three heads impaledon tall poles. Norukai heads, with a placard below and a warning written inIldakaran script: Free the slaves of Ildakar. This is the fate of those who sellhuman flesh.Renn’s heart fluttered. Trevor and his guards muttered to one another.“Mirrormask and his rebels have come even this far.” The guard captain turnedgray, and he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth as if he had justswallowed bile. “They slaughtered my friend Kerry, mutilated him, cut out hiseyes. But this…” Trevor shook his head. “I can’t believe they placed a warningso far away.”“The Norukai are ambitious,” said Renn, trying to come up with an explanation.“Perhaps there is a threat from this direction. The slavers intend to comeoverland as well as up the river.”“The Norukai aren’t that dangerous,” Trevor said, then added in a quieter voice,“Are they? Is their empire so large?”Renn gathered his courage because he knew he had to make a good show for theselesser guards. As wizard, he was the leader of this expedition. “I do not know,and it does not matter. If we gain the lore of Cliffwall and bring it back toIldakar, then we can all rest under the shroud and not worry about petty outsidethreats.” His throat was dry, and he swallowed hard. Narrowing his eyes, hesaid, “Take down those heads. We don’t wish the rebels to have any victory, evena small one like this.”Trevor and two other guards knocked down the poles, jarring the heads loose anddisrupting the preservation spell that kept them intact. The rotting fleshturned black and green, then oozed off of the skulls, exposing teeth. Jelliedeyes ran in streams into the ground. Clumps of hair slid off, and the stenchwafted up.Renn sneered at the sight, intending to seem brave. “I never liked the Norukaieither, and I am not overly sad that a few of them lost their heads.” He lookedup at Trevor. “I would rather Mirrormask’s thugs killed more of them instead ofinnocent citizens … like Kerry. It makes the world a more beautiful place.” Hesnickered at his own joke, then gestured forward. “Up into the mountains! Let usfind Cliffwall without further ado, so we can get home.”“Agreed,” Trevor said, and the guards cheered. “It must be just beyond that nextridge, over the mountains ahead. It cannot be far. We’ve covered so muchdistance already.”The guards muttered, convincing themselves because their captain was so sure.And because Captain Trevor was so sure, Renn let himself be convinced. Theypushed onward, and as night fell, they bedded down in camp.It would only be a few more days, Renn assured himself as he tried to fallasleep on the cold, hard ground. Only a few more days.The next morning they continued into the wild and rugged mountains, still tryingto find Kol Adair."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 42 [contents.xhtml#c_ch42]The night in Ildakar seemed calmer and quieter now that the Norukai had finallydeparted, but Nicci again couldn’t sleep. She was disturbed by the connectedfeline dreams from Mrra as well as her own restless thoughts. She lay in herexpansive soft bed, which seemed far too comfortable to endure. She stared atthe ceiling, listened to the breezes outside, the whisper of gauzy curtains atthe open windows.Inside her mind, the subtle presence of Mrra flowed through her. She had notseen the big sand panther since they’d entered the great city, but she knew thatthe big cat prowled the streets, keeping to the shadows. Mrra would not leaveher.Impatient, Nicci swung herself out of the bed and dressed quietly, shook herblond hair loose, slipped on her boots, and laced them up. She walked throughthe grand villa, knowing Mrra was out there in the dark streets, somewhere.Nicci was anxious for her sister panther, wanted Mrra to get out of thisdangerous situation. The cat didn’t always understand Nicci in details orspecifics, but she would try to convey her urgent message. The panther did notbelong here … none of them did, but Nicci couldn’t leave. Not yet.Mrra, though, belonged outside, roaming the plain, keeping herself safe.Walking past Bannon’s room, Nicci saw it was dark, and with a glance inside sherealized he had not slept in his bed, had not even been back to the villa in aday or two. She frowned, wondering where he might be. No doubt he was with Amos,Jed, and Brock. Although Nicci did not approve of three young men, Bannon couldmake his own friends and learn his own lessons, even if he burned his fingers indoing so. He had not convinced anyone to help free his friend Ian, though Amoshad offered casual assistance. Nicci suspected that was just a ruse, a crueljoke.She concentrated on a larger problem: if she could change Ildakaran society andfree all the slaves, then Ian would be among them.She saw that Nathan’s room was dark as well. She considered rousing the formerwizard so they could search for Mrra together, but as she felt the tendrilscalling her, Nicci decided it would be best if she went alone.Moving with catlike grace of her own, Nicci prowled the streets, descending theupper plateau. She saw feral house cats loose on the city walls, staring at herwith gleaming eyes. She passed darkened estates, large homes of wealthy nobles,sniffed the sweet perfumes of blossoming orchards.Before long, she felt the swell of Mrra’s presence, a flood of joy. Theblossoming fruit trees provided tangled shadows as well as tiny white flowers,and she was surprised to realize the big panther was up in the branches. Mrraleaped down and landed in front of her with barely a sound, muscles tensed, tailtwitching. The panther curled back her whiskers and let out a growling purr ofwelcome.Nicci stepped forward. “Mrra, I’m so happy to see you.” She stroked the bigcat’s wide head, scratched behind the twitching ears. “You shouldn’t be here.You should leave this city.”Mrra growled, but didn’t move.Nicci heard a clatter of roof tiles, looked up to see one of the smaller catsscampering along the gutter, before jumping down into another alley.Nicci lowered her voice, pressed her face close to the panther’s feline eyes.“This is not a place for you. It’s dangerous here.” She wrapped her arms aroundthe thick, muscular neck and hugged Mrra. “I know you’re staying here for me—butyou shouldn’t! This isn’t the wild. Ildakar is not your place.”Nicci pushed the solid furred body, trying to shove Mrra away. “Go! Get out ofthe city before the sun rises again. I want to know you’re free. I can’t worryabout you. There’s too much to do here.”Mrra planted her paws hard on the ground, resisting as Nicci pushed.She sighed. “I wish you could understand me. Somebody will find you here, and Idon’t want you caught. You remember what the chief handler will do to you.You’ve fought in the arena before.”Mrra snorted, then pulled away, turning about reluctantly. Her tail twitched.Nicci put urgency in her voice. “Nathan, Bannon, and I will leave here as soonas we can, but it’s important that we stay, for now.”Mrra looked over her shoulder at her sister panther as she took two steps away.She paused. Nicci raised her voice to a loud whisper. “Please go!”The cat sniffed in clear defiance. Nicci’s heart felt heavy, knowing that Mrrawould stay here for as long as Nicci stayed.She let out a long sigh. “Dear spirits, then keep yourself safe. Hide where theywill never find you, and only come out at night.” Another thought occurred toher. “And if you should see Bannon, protect him. I don’t know what he’s gotteninto.” Nicci straightened, ran her palms down her dark skirts. “If I need you, Iwill call.”Mrra lifted her large head, twitched her tail, then let out another confidentgrowl before she bounded off into the night like a tawny shadow, disappearinginto the winding streets. Nicci hoped the cat would stay safe. She hoped theywould all stay safe."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 43 [contents.xhtml#c_ch43]The torchlight from outside the cell hurt his eyes. Everything hurt his eyes. Infact, everything hurt.Bannon groaned and came back to consciousness looking at sandstone walls. Thelumpy uneven surface bore rusty brown marks, as if someone had used bloodyfingernails to claw notches into the rock.Two stubby candles burned in little cubbyholes, and the ceiling was stained withblack smears of soot from the guttering flames. Outside the cell, mountedtorches cast a latticework of shadows across the floor from the bars that heldhim inside. His cell had a narrow wooden pallet for sleeping, but he lay curledup in pain on the floor where he had been tossed like a broken doll.He remembered provoking the Norukai, fighting them, and how the three hadmercilessly beaten him, no matter how hard he had tried to fight back.Sometimes, when he couldn’t control his rage, he became a wild fighting storm,but his attack against Kor, Yorik, and Lars was ill advised, poorly planned. Hecouldn’t help himself. If he’d had Sturdy with him, Bannon would have killed allof them, but without his sword, anger had been his only weapon, and the brutishraiders knew how to attack helpless victims. They fought with no finesse orhonor, three against one, acting as bullies.Bannon had lost. Badly.He groaned as he propped himself up on the gritty stone floor. At first hethought they had thrown him into some kind of city jail, but then he heardfemale voices outside, listened to the clatter of bars and the clang of dulledswords. Arena warriors were fighting one another, practicing and shouting. Theyoung man raised himself to his knees, reached out to hold the bars for support,and pulled himself upright.He could see the fighting pits now. Bannon gingerly touched his cracked ribs andfelt pain resonate through his bones. He cursed Kor and his companions under hisbreath, then cursed himself for failing. He wanted to see Norukai heads roll,blood spouting from the stumps of necks as the men tumbled to the ground, felledlike those poor yaxen at the butcher house.If only he’d had Sturdy …In the combat pits, the fighters were shirtless, their scarred, well-muscledbodies glistening with oil and sweat in the torchlight. They practiced againsteach other, using swords and shields. Two dour morazeth trainers lounged back onstools, critiquing their moves. Across the passageway, Bannon could see a muchlarger barred cell, and with a jolt he recognized it. Ian’s cell. His heartskipped a beat.“Sweet Sea Mother!” He gripped the bars and drew in a deep breath, but his chestfelt like a shattered bottle. He forced himself to breathe more calmly, thencalled out in a hoarse voice, “Ian, are you there?”He saw figures moving in his friend’s chamber. The champion’s cell. Because ofthe angle, he couldn’t see much, only the shadows flickering and spilling out.When they came into view, he saw that one figure was Adessa, leader of themorazeth and trainer of the arena fighters. Her breasts were bare, small, andhard as if her feminine curves had been distilled down to tough muscle. Herbrown nipples were erect and so sharp they looked like weapons. Indifferent toher nakedness, Adessa casually wrapped the black leather strap around her chest.A moment later the scarred and steely-eyed Ian stepped up beside her. Heglistened with sweat, as if he had just engaged in personal combat.Seeing him, Bannon cried, “Ian! I’m over here. I—”The other young man just looked at him. His flat metal gaze slid over Bannon asif he weren’t there at all. Ian retreated into the unseen corners of hisspacious cell. When Adessa opened the barred door to exit, Bannon realized thegate wasn’t even locked. Apparently, Ian and these warriors were prisoners bytheir own choice, held captive by training, reward and punishment. He rememberedhis friend’s cold stare, the angry twist of his lips.Bannon wondered if these fighters had been so indoctrinated or their wits soaddled by numerous head blows that they didn’t actually want to be free. Maybethey had forgotten what it was to be free. The fighters in the open trainingarea kept dancing around each other’s blades, thrusting and parrying, yetmaintaining silence all the while. Even when one struck a severe blow againstanother, his opponent didn’t cry out.After closing Ian’s barred door Adessa crossed the passageway to Bannon’s muchsmaller cell, moving like a lioness ready to strike. Bannon stood his ground,but the look in the morazeth’s brown eyes made him falter. She grabbed the barsof his cage and used her key to work the lock. He heard a click, then a snap ofsprings, and she yanked the cell door open.“You’re awake, and you’re alive—for now. Tell me, Bannon Farmer, are you worthmy time?” He faced the hard woman, sensing that she was a bully just as hisfather had been. His heart thudded in his chest, but he had long since stoppedbeing frightened of bullies. He had finally stood up to his father, but if he’ddone that years earlier, then his life—and his mother’s—might have been muchdifferent.Bannon faced her. “I am a guest in Ildakar. My friends Nicci and Nathan willcome for me.”“Your friends are weak and have no power here.”Bannon remembered when Nicci had faced the Lifedrinker, destroying the evilwizard just as she had destroyed Victoria. He thought of Nathan slaying themonstrous selka who attacked from the sea and the dust people who crawled out ofthe desert sand. “My friends have a great deal of power.”“Not power that counts,” Adessa said.“Then Amos will come to free me.” Bannon tried to sound convincing. “He’s theson of Sovrena Thora and Wizard Commander Maxim.”Adessa’s close-cropped black hair glistened with sweat. Her lips quirked in arazor smile. “Who do you think brought you here?”Bannon’s heart sank as he slumped down on the wooden pallet. He knew she spokethe truth. He realized that no one would help him, not now. Nicci and Nathanwould eventually notice he had gone missing and they would track him down—if hecould remain alive long enough. “I just wanted to give Ian his freedom.”“The champion already has his freedom. He is doing what he likes, and he willdie in the arena. He is my lover, and I may even let him plant a child in me.What man could be more free?” Adessa’s stomach was flat but marked with runes,as were her arms, her neck, and her cheeks. Her thighs were likewise a book ofprotective spell symbols written with pain. Adessa had a feral power coiledinside her and a simmering sexual ferocity that Bannon found more intimidatingthan her strength.“What made you this way?” Bannon asked.“I am a morazeth. I am a product of the most perfect training. I am currentlythe best and most successful, and I take my duty very seriously.”“But I don’t know what the morazeth are.”“We are your darkest nightmare.” Adessa stepped closer, and he could smell theperspiration on her skin. The glow of his small candles painted her arms andthighs a rippling copper. “For many thousands of years in Ildakar, long beforeGeneral Utros came with his army, long before the shroud was erected, themorazeth have been fearsome fighters and trainers. Hoping to gain status,ungifted merchants, tradesmen, and artisans would offer up their girl childrento become morazeth. Only the finest, most perfect specimens are selected fortraining, and of those only one in ten survives to be branded with theprotective spell symbols.” She used her forefinger to caress the welts on herleft thigh, tracing angles and swirls that wove a shield through her flesh andsoul.“Daughters have their skin branded inch by inch as they pass their training.”Her face twisted in a flicker of pain across her memories. “The weak ones whowhimper are killed.” She stroked her palm over the panoply of arcane markings onher forearm. “We consider any smooth patches on our skin to be shameful marks,and we hide them.” Her dark eyes glittered as she leaned close. “Feel honoredthat we have taken an interest in you. We will train you so you can fight anddie.”“I can fight and die without your training,” Bannon said.“But you will die more swiftly if you do not have it. But such training comes ata cost. Are you worth it? I assume you will be intractable, so I may as wellstart your lesson now.”She withdrew a small cylindrical object like the handle of an awl from her hip.Because it was black, he had not noticed it against the leather of her wrap. Shestroked her thumb down its contoured wooden side, and he heard a faint snick. Asharp silvery tip snapped out, a thick needle no longer than the first knuckleon his forefinger.“Each morazeth has a special weapon like this. We call it an agile knife.”Bannon wondered what she meant to do with it. The needle tip was too short tocause any real damage. “Is it poisoned?”“Far worse than poison. It is composed entirely of pain.”She jabbed the stubby point into his thigh, and with her thumb she touched anodd rune etched into the wooden handle. Bannon felt an explosion of pain rippleup and down his muscles, as if a great crash of thunder had struck him,concentrated in that tiny needle tip.He screamed and collapsed, utterly ignoring the ache of his multiple bruises andthe sharp edges of his cracked ribs. His movement dislodged the tiny agileknife, and the pain disappeared instantly, although the aftereffects made himshudder.Adessa looked at him, disapproving. “That was your first lesson.”Shaking, spasming, he got to his hands and knees and spewed vomit onto the cellfloor. He looked up at her aghast, his jaw slack. With the back of his hand hewiped drool from his mouth. “What … was that?”“It was pain,” Adessa said. “The agile knife has a spell-bonded symbol connectedto one of the runes branded on our flesh.” She stroked the contoured handleagain and smiled. “It doesn’t take much to release it, and we have other symbolsthat can be used to make it kill; just the tiniest prick and you will either bedead, or you will wish you were dead.”He panted. His thoughts were scrambled.Adessa continued to stare at him. “Now get yourself up. There’s a water basin toclean your face.” She cast her glance to the passageway outside of his cell.Bannon barely focused on another figure standing out there, a slender femalealso wearing the scant black coverings of a morazeth. “I have already chosen thechampion as my special pet, so I give you to Lila. She will know what to do.”The young woman opened the barred door and entered his cell as Adessa departed,without even a glance back. Bannon wanted to lurch to his feet and knock Liladown so he could bolt out into the passageways and escape.But he knew Lila would stop him.She crossed her arms over the leather band that wrapped her breasts. “Becauseyou are soft and weak, I’ll grant you an hour to rest and recover.” Her lipstwitched in a grimace that might have been intended as a smile. “I will use thetime to consider what you deserve for your second lesson.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 44 [contents.xhtml#c_ch44]Bells tolled to alert the city. In a solemn procession, the members of theruling council moved through the streets of the upper plateau, heading towardthe great pyramid. Well-dressed nobles and upper-class merchants climbed thestreets to the upper levels, gathering as if for a festival. The eager movementin the streets, accompanied by the closing of shops, inns, and restaurants,signified that this was a day of great importance.“Whatever is happening, I don’t like this,” Nicci said, stepping out of thegrand villa. “Not at all.” No one had called them, but she suspected it mighthave something to do with the ominous spell the duma had promised.Nathan and Nicci left the grand villa, joining the crowds and looking foranswers. “Where is that boy Bannon?” Nathan asked, looking around.“Now that the Norukai are gone, maybe he’s with his so-called friends,” shesaid. The young man was far too open and trusting, and she had seen thehalf-hidden sneers on the faces of Amos, Jed, and Brock. Nicci recalled that sheherself had had no friends when she was young. Her stern mother had forced herto work the streets in the name of the Imperial Order, following the teachingsof Brother Narev, while scorning all the hard work and success that her fatherachieved. Nicci had not understood friendship, had not wanted it. Youthfulfriendship remained a foreign concept to her, but she had grown close to hercompanions.She made a quiet comment, just loud enough for Nathan to hear. “He may not wishto be here, depending on what the wizards intend to do … and what we may have todo to stop them.”The skies were overcast, but the smear of gray clouds carried only gloom, notrain. The clamor of tolling bells continued across the city, echoing from allthe levels. Nicci felt a crackle of tension in the air, both excitement anddread.“No one informed us,” Nathan said. “Maybe we aren’t invited.”Nicci didn’t intend to let that stop her. “We’ll invite ourselves. Come with me,Wizard.”Nathan’s azure eyes narrowed as he watched people ascending the steep streets togather on the upper level of the plateau, crowding near the base of the pyramid.“I believe you’re right, my dear sorceress. I don’t need my gift to sense thebrooding in the air.”Nicci tucked a strand of blond hair behind her ear and set off with a determinedstride. “I do have my gift, but if I choose not to do anything with it, thenwhat use is all that power?” Her throat was dry, her voice husky. “I can’t juststand and watch.”“I understand how powerful your gift is,” Nathan said, “but if you do somethingrash, you will turn a whole city against us, and we’ll end up dead, or at thevery least defeated. You know what the wizards of Ildakar can do. You saw Maximpetrify that rebel before our very eyes.”Nicci did not slow her pace. “But they haven’t seen what I can do. The dumamembers and all these gifted nobles have never experienced anything like mebefore.”“Indeed, no one has.” Nathan hurried to keep up with her. “I will help as muchas I can.”They joined the crowds of jostling people gathered at the top of the plateau.One well-dressed man carried a bowl of grapes tucked in the crook of his rightarm, and he plucked one purple sphere after another, sucking it dry and spittingout the seeds.Nicci smelled a wash of pungent sweat and stinging perfumes. The men had oiled,wavy hair and wore armbands that set off the color of their pantaloons and waistsashes. Strips of exotic furs adorned their half capes or the cuffs of theirlong robes. The women wore swirling gowns as if they were going to a grand gala.The tolling bells played a dissonant metallic tune that rang from a dozen hightowers throughout the city.Intent on her purpose, Nicci glided among the people who were in no hurry.Nathan stayed close to her side. “Dear spirits,” he muttered. They reached thewide base of the stair-stepped pyramid, sensed the excitement growing among thespectators. “It must be the blood magic, Sorceress. We knew the wizards weregoing to do something like this. I expect there will be killing. A lot of it.”“I expect they might try,” Nicci said.The crowds parted as the council members finished their slow procession andarrived at the pyramid. Thora and Maxim were in the lead. An icy wall seemed toseparate the sovrena and the wizard commander, but they were partners in thepowerful magic that protected the city. Thora wore a sapphire gown trimmed withlush gray fur, while Maxim had a long garnet-red cape lined with white furspotted with gray, as if ashes had fallen onto pristine snow. The two did notlook at each other, nor did they glance at Nathan or Nicci as they passed.The members of the duma walked behind them, staring ahead with solemnexpressions: the fleshmancer Andre, Chief Handler Ivan, matronly Elsa in herpurple robes, dark-skinned Quentin wearing an ocher robe and a golden amulet onhis chest, Damon with his shaggy black hair and long mustaches.Uneasy, Elsa flicked a glance over at Nathan, gave him a brief smile, thenturned to mutter to Quentin, “It isn’t right to do this without Renn. We shouldwait for him to come back from his expedition.”“He might never come back,” Quentin mumbled, as they walked past. “The duma cando without him. Renn’s too unreliable. I’ve never been totally convinced of hisloyalty since Lani made her bid for power.”Elsa looked shocked. “Renn has always been a faithful member of the rulingcouncil!”“As you say,” Quentin replied, just as they were walking out of earshot. “Butonce the shroud goes up, he will have to remain outside until we let him backin. And I hope the blood magic buys us a good deal of time.”Thora and Maxim had ascended the stone steps to the top of the pyramid, andturned to face the crowds from their high vantage. The five duma members climbedup to join them among the components of the strange apparatus on the topplatform, the gleaming half sphere mounted in its armature cradle, the quartzprisms standing tall on metal rods.Wizard Commander Maxim extended his arms and gazed across the people. Even fromthe bottom of the pyramid, Nicci could see the sparkle in his eyes. “Ildakar hasstood for thousands of years.” The wizard commander’s voice sounded tinny andresonant, but she had no doubt even the slaves and tradesmen in the lowestlevels of the city could hear him.Thora spoke next. “Ildakar is protected because we protect it. Our perfect wayof life is sacred, but such perfection comes at a cost.” Her voice was hard, butshe did not seem saddened by what she had to do. “The cost of blood.”Down below, ten members of the city guard marched forward, their steel-shodboots making a sound like drumbeats on the flagstones. They led a group oftwelve slaves bound by ropes around their wrists. Some of them struggled andpulled back, but the guards did not cuff them. They simply marched along,implacable, forcing the slaves to follow.Nicci recognized faces from the slave market, the “walking meat” delivered bythe Norukai. The guards herded them single-file up the worn stone steps, fivewomen and seven men. Two of them were old, three were young, and the others ofvarying ages. A thin man and woman, both with brown hair and dusky skin, walkedclose to each other, moving fatalistically. From their dress and facial featuresthey looked to have come from the same village. The woman went up the stairsfirst, one step after another. She extended a hand back and the man reachedforward to brush his fingers against hers. Nicci could tell they knew eachother, cared for each other. Several slaves wore blank expressions as if theyhad been drugged, perhaps by the red wisterias. One woman stumbled and sobbed,trying to keep up with the rest in spite of sore joints. Tears ran through thewrinkles on her face. A muscular man twisted and tugged on his rope, but theothers kept moving forward, ascending to the fenced platform below the top ofthe pyramid.Thora turned to the crowded slaves. “Stand before Ildakar!”The captives moved restlessly, looking confused, and the sovrena stamped herfoot, sending a flicker of power through the structure. The magic jolted thecaptive slaves, seized their muscles, and forced them to stand rigid likepuppets.The crowd muttered. The merchants and nobles in the finest clothes looked eageras they watched, but those in drab clothes were less excited.“Stop!” Nicci called out from below, eliciting a gasp from the crowd. “If thereis such a price, Sovrena, why don’t you pay it with your own blood?”Thora scoffed down at her. “Because my blood is worth too much.”Nicci felt the angry magic coiling within her, like eels swimming through amuddy canal. She felt warm vibrations like hidden strands throughout the city, aspiderweb of magic centered on the pyramid. “So you kill captives instead? Forentertainment?”“For necessity. These slaves will pay the cost. That’s what they are for.” Thetwelve captives were fixed into place one level below the complex apparatus onthe upper platform. Some of the slaves shuddered. The old woman continued toweep, even though she could barely move, held in place by the magic.Thora stared intensely down at them. “They will save us.”Some glared at her in defiance; others turned away, quivering.At the base of the pyramid, Nicci stepped away from Nathan and used a nudge ofher gift to push the crowds aside as she reached the steps. She was going tostop this. “No, Thora.” She could summon a storm of lightning from above, usingboth Additive and Subtractive Magic. Had the wizards of Ildakar ever seenSubtractive Magic? Nicci doubted it. “If you don’t stop this madness, I willmake you sorry.”Nicci could take them by surprise, incinerate the top of the pyramid and disruptthis ceremony. She also knew that Mirrormask and his rebels were a tinderboxjust waiting for a spark to ignite them. Would they rise up and assist her ifshe provided that spark? Maybe this was the time.A hush fell over the crowd, as moans rippled through the twelve slaves. Theystruggled but could not move, locked in place by Thora’s magic. They all facedthe reflective trough in front of them, and Nicci knew exactly what it was for.“Sovrena, let me speak on their behalf!”In unison, as if they had rehearsed this many times before, all five members ofthe wizards’ duma reached into their robes and pulled out long, ceremonialknives with jeweled hilts and curved blades.Thora gestured with one hand, and magic forced the gathered slaves to raisetheir chins high, exposing their throats. Somehow fighting against the puppetcontrol, the dusky-skinned couple reached sideways, touching each other’s hands,drawing strength and comfort in their last moment. Tears streamed from thecorners of their eyes, running down the sides of their upturned faces.Standing with their sacrificial knives in hand, the council members hesitated,looking down at Nicci. She strode up the steep steps, gathering her magic. Shecould see that several of the wizards were intimidated by her boldness. Thecrowd had fallen silent, awed that she would stand up to Thora.Nicci felt magic boiling within her ready to be unleashed.Elsa and Damon both lowered their knives, uncertain. Maxim appeared to beamused. The rest of the wizards didn’t seem to know what to do.On top of the pyramid, Maxim said out of the corner of his mouth, “Just get itover with, Thora. No need for such a dramatic flair.”The sovrena scoffed at the hesitation of the others. In an impatient, offhandgesture, she twitched her finger and gestured down at the line of slaves fifteenfeet below her. With a cruel smile on her thin lips, she drew her sharp,lacquered fingernail across the air in a quick, casual slash.Nicci lunged, building up a swirl of solidified air to knock back the wizards,but before she could release it, Thora’s knife of magic, sharper than thesharpest razor, ripped across the throats of the twelve shocked slaves. All atonce, their eyes bulged, and they jerked and twitched, and the puppet hold wasreleased.The slaves collapsed forward as their knees buckled. Their heads had nearly beensevered by Thora’s invisible blade. The slaves pitched into the trough, spillinggouts of blood into the channels in front of them.Maxim and the five duma members held their ceremonial knives, looking perplexedand surprised. None of them had moved.Nicci staggered on the steps, astonished. “Dear spirits!”Blood flowed, and magic built in a rush around the pyramid.A wind of increasing whispers crossed the crowd. They stood motionless.Nicci struck out with her wall of air, but Thora responded and knocked her backwith a similar blow, throwing her off balance. She tumbled back onto the steepstone staircase. From below, Nathan rushed up to catch her.As the blood from the slaves filled the mirrorized trough, Maxim raised hishands high and made sweeping gestures. The red river flowed through the gutters,defying gravity as it rolled uphill to the top platform, where it spread out andfilled the engraved patterns of the spell-form.All seven ruling council members gathered around the hemispherical bowl. Theygrasped the silver edges, turned it so that it was aligned directly upward. Whenthe blood of the slaves had filled the pattern engraved in the platform, thecrimson current fountained up in a single stream and poured into the mirroredcauldron.The sovrena and wizard commander stood in place while the other five wizardsretreated. The half sphere vibrated, shimmered, and a column of twisted magicrocketed upward, like a geyser. The swirl rose higher and higher until itreached its zenith far overhead and spread out like falling water, ripplingthrough the air. It curled down to create a transparent dome that covered all ofIldakar, flowing past the outer walls to the river bluffs.The crowd cheered,Too late. Nicci felt sick, defeated, as the wizard picked her up from where shehad fallen on the steep stone stairs. She groaned to Nathan, “I should havestopped it.” She was angry at herself, but more furious with the sovrena.At the top of the pyramid, Thora seemed pleased, standing beside her husband asthey reveled in their handiwork. The sovrena didn’t even show anger toward Niccifor her defiance, because it had amounted to nothing.“You didn’t know what was going to happen, Sorceress,” Nathan said, his voicethin and sickened.“We knew. We both knew. And now we’re imprisoned under the shroud.” Her headpounded. “We can’t stay in Ildakar. We have a mission.”Nathan squared his shoulders. “Perhaps this confirms that our mission is here.Even if we can’t escape, we have plenty of work to do.” He sniffed. “They willwish we had left when we had the chance.”Nicci recalled that time passed differently inside the shroud. She forciblyopened her clenched fists. “Even if it takes eternity,” she said quietly."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 45 [contents.xhtml#c_ch45]Two large ships set sail from Tanimura and headed south out of Grafan Harbor.The brisk breeze made the sea choppy, although the sun was bright.Verna went to the bow of the foremost ship and stood with the wind blowing hergraying hair back. The salty spray moistened her cheeks. She realized she wassmiling, and her heart was full of possibilities again as she thought of theirjourney to Cliffwall. It was a strange feeling, and she welcomed it.“I have a purpose now,” she said to herself.The young novice Amber came up to join her, her dark blond hair pinned back andher loose dress clinging to her willowy form with the bodice tied tight acrossher small breasts. “We all have a purpose, Prelate. This is my first greatjourney. I’m very happy you let me accompany you.”All of the Sisters had insisted on coming along, and Verna could not turn themaway. Those who had returned to Tanimura looking for some small spark of hope inthe ashes of the Palace of the Prophets had been disappointed. They had lookedto Verna for leadership, but she hadn’t known what to tell them. Now that Nicciand Nathan had blazed a trail across the Old World and sent messages back, Vernaclung to the new possibility.After the camouflage shroud had fallen years ago, the Cliffwall caretakers hadsent out a call for gifted scholars to help sort through the immense archive. Inretrospect, that had been a dangerous decision, but the isolated people hadn’tbeen aware of the powerful knowledge in all those volumes. One outside scholarhad been Roland, who became the Lifedrinker. Another had unleashed a spell thatmade the stone walls flow like wet clay, melting an entire tower of prophecywritings.Verna knew those people needed careful guidance from her and the other Sisters.A sailor shouted from the lookout, and the crew members paused in their chores,going to the side rails to look, along with many members of the D’Haran army.Amber pointed excitedly. “What are they? Sharks?”Verna saw the sleek bullet shapes rising up and diving down, like a vanguard tolead the ships along. “Not sharks, child—dolphins. They are considered a goodsign among sailors, and it’s a good sign for us, too.”Amber grinned. “I can’t wait to tell my brother.” Captain Norcross was on thesecond ship with the other half of the soldiers and six of the Sisters. “What anadventure!”“Not just an adventure. This is our mission. We have work to do as Sisters ofthe Light.”Oliver and Peretta had also come out on deck. They were inseparable now,relieved to have accomplished what they were sent to do. Oliver squinted to makeout the dolphins. “I long to see the canyons again, and all the books in thegreat library.” He sighed. “I guess I am homesick.”Peretta’s tight ringlets glistened with diamonds of spray. She and Oliver woreclean traveling clothes, replaced in Tanimura. The girl’s dark eyes looked justas eager as Oliver’s. “I wish you were a memmer. If you had the gift of perfectmemory, you could remember every day and every place down to the tiniestdetail.”He gave her a skeptical look. “Does that mean you don’t miss home?”Peretta looked embarrassed. “I still miss it.”Verna knew in her heart that her Sisters had to study that great archive of lostlore. Cliffwall was likely one of the central sites Nathan had talked about. Sheremembered when she and the Mord-Sith Berdine had pored through immenselibraries in the People’s Palace, when they had discovered the first hints ofthe Chainfire spell. After hearing the descriptions from Oliver and Peretta,Verna thought the wealth of information inside Cliffwall might be an evengreater treasure trove.Even though prophecy was gone, there would be so much to learn, so much tostudy. All of the untrained scholars needed to be guided and taught. If theSisters could do as they had done for so many centuries in the Palace of theProphets, those scholars could well become an army of wizards, ready to aid LordRahl in bringing about his golden age. As she stood on deck, Verna took out theglazed clay toad figurine she had found in the ruins, holding it in her palm, asymbol and a memory of what had once been.Maybe she would find some other good place to put it, once they reachedCliffwall. The continuity pleased her.* * *They sailed onward for days, the two ships side by side. General Zimmer hadhandpicked one hundred fifty soldiers from the garrison, the best trained amonghis men. They had packed their armor, weapons, and traveling clothes, writtenletters of farewell to send back to their families. The rest of the soldiersremained behind in Tanimura, maintaining the foothold there and expanding thestrength and security of the D’Haran Empire. Lord Rahl would be dispatchingthousands more men in the coming month, to move down the coast and establishother outposts as well.But this mission to Cliffwall would be the first and the farthest. One hundredfifty soldiers was not a sufficient military force to do any conquering, butthey would be enough to establish the presence of D’Hara and to make sure thename of Lord Rahl was known.With so many soldiers crowded aboard two sailing ships, their expedition had thepotential for a miserable voyage, but they were well provisioned. “Soldiers ofthe D’Haran army do not need to be pampered,” Zimmer had told her. “Think of theterrible enemies they’ve already fought. They won’t be afraid of a sea voyage.”By the fourth day, however, the enemy they could not fight was seasickness, andmany of the men were miserable, clutching their stomachs, retching into bucketsor leaning over the side of the ship. They were foot soldiers, most of whom hadlived their lives on dry land.Verna and her Sisters tended to the miserable soldiers. The prelate herself useda damp rag to comfort General Zimmer, who huddled in his small cabin with theshutters drawn over his porthole. He refused to step outside in the fresh air sothat his soldiers would not see his weakness.“I doubt they’re in any condition to watch much of anything,” Verna said. “Howdo you expect to conquer the Old World if you can’t even get out of bed?”“I’ll conquer the Old World once we dock,” Zimmer groaned.By the time the two ships reached Kherimus, the first port of call south ofTanimura, most of the seasickness had passed, and the men happily disembarkedfor a day. Verna and Zimmer went into the town to buy maps of the lands farthersouth so they had some idea of where they were going. Oliver and Peretta joinedthem to look at the charts. The two young scholars pointed far beyond theboundary of the largest map. “That’s where we need to go.”The two ships sailed to Larrikan Shores two days farther down the coast, andthen, after a fierce and frightening squall that nearly swamped them, theyreached the large city of Serrimundi. They sailed into the harbor guarded by theenormous stone statue of the Sea Mother. General Zimmer shaded his eyes andstared up at the statue that emerged from the high cliff. “Can you imagine whatit took to carve that, Prelate?”Verna tried to picture crews of sculptors dangling from ropes or standing onplatforms, chiseling away to create the lovely female figure. Seabirds flewaround the sculpture, nesting among the carved tresses of her hair. She didn’thave any answer for him.Zimmer nodded to himself as he gazed around the harbor, assessing the otherships. “We’ll get what we need here and move onward.”“And what exactly do we need, General?” Verna asked.“More room, for one thing. I have a writ from Lord Rahl, and I intend to use itto commandeer a third ship and more supplies.”Peretta said, “Renda Bay is just down the coast. I recall all the contours ofthe shore between here and there. I can guide you without any charts.”“She is a memmer,” Oliver said, with a hint of sarcasm.“I believe she mentioned that once or twice,” Zimmer said. “But the captain andI would rather have detailed charts. More importantly, I must talk with theharborlord to finish outfitting this operation. We’re an expeditionary force andwe have a long journey inland. Unless I intend to waste months marching over themountains on foot, I’ll need horses, many horses.” He grinned at the idea.“We’ll have a real military expedition.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 46 [contents.xhtml#c_ch46]Though the sandstone walls around the training pit were only ten feet high, theyseemed insurmountable as Bannon stood on the sands. It was a bowl-shaped arenathirty feet wide. The stone had been hacked, sheer and clean. He would never beable to climb out.“Sweet Sea Mother,” he muttered, trying to calm himself.Two of the morazeth had dragged him out of his cell and pulled him along so fastthat he stumbled. He tried to cooperate, but they didn’t want to make it easy onhim or on themselves. “My friends are coming for me!” Bannon cried out, as ifthat might frighten them. “We’ll leave Ildakar and go far away.”One of the spell-scarred women twisted her mouth in a frown. “You won’t beleaving. The wizards worked the blood magic yesterday and restored the shroud.No one can depart from the city.”Bannon felt a cold twist in his gut. He had been worried about his own plight,not even thinking what might be happening outside. Where were Nicci and Nathan?Were his friends in trouble, too? Were they all prisoners within this city,separated from the world and time? Or had they escaped without him?One of the morazeth nudged him forward. “You have your own prison to worry aboutright here, boy. Do well, and you will deserve our training.”The other woman said, “Do well, and you’ll survive.”They had led him to the edge of the practice pit, an empty featureless ring witha floor of sand and fine pea gravel raked smooth. He saw no way to climb downinto the pit. “How do I—”The women had shoved him, and he fell, sprawling so hard in the yielding groundthat it knocked the wind out of him. He coughed, dragged himself to his handsand knees. “Now what?” he asked aloud, but the morazeth walked away from the rimabove.He turned slowly, looking at the sheer walls. This practice pit seemed simpleand basic. Maybe for beginners …Bannon heard movement above and looked up to see Lila in her black leather overher rune-marked skin. She was barefoot, standing at the edge, studying him. Shecracked her knuckles before tugging on a pair of tight leather gloves. “Iwouldn’t want to scar you too badly, boy. At least not so soon.”She sprang over the edge and dropped down into the pit. She landed in a crouch,perfectly balanced. She held her arms loosely, gloved fists on her hips. “I feela little stiff this morning, and I need some exercise. Fight me.” She flashedher white teeth, but it was by no means a smile. “I’ll reward you for each blowyou land on me.” She came forward, and even though she was smaller than he,Bannon took a step back. “And I plan to deny you any rewards this day.”“I don’t want to fight you,” he said.“Then you will be very sore and bloody before this session is through.” Shelunged toward him, feinted with her left hand, and slapped him across the facewith her right. The glove padded the impact, but his jaw jerked sideways and hefelt stinging pain.He raised his forearm to block a second blow, but Lila struck him on the otherside of the face. He shook his head, and then swung blindly. He tried to hit herstomach, but managed only to strike her side. He could feel her ribs beneath herskin. Somehow, he sensed that she had let him touch her.“Do you like the feel of my flesh, boy?” she taunted. “You can touch it all youlike … if you can strike me.”Lila punched him in the center of the chest, but just a light blow to prove shecould do it. Then she boxed his ears and danced back. Bannon’s heart waspounding. He held up both of his hands, feeling fear and anger. He didn’t wantto be in this place, separated from his friends, trapped in this strange cityunder an invisible dome. His real concern was inside this practice pit, here andnow, facing this lean young woman who seemed to consider pain nothing more thanflirtation. He had to survive this training if he was ever going to get free andreturn to his friends.Hoping to surprise her, he charged toward Lila, swinging both arms, punching theair with his fists, trying to land any contact. Lila danced from side to side,and he adjusted his approach, using his size and weight for whatever advantagehe could. He punched her in the left shoulder, making the morazeth spin justenough that he could drive in with an uppercut that clipped her jaw. It was asolid blow, and Lila reeled backward. She caught her breath, flapping her glovedhands and grinning. “That’s a nice start.”Then, faster than he could see, she delivered a sideways chop to his kidney,which sent him staggering. Spangles of light swirled behind his eyes. Hecouldn’t breathe.Lila swept her bare left foot and knocked his legs out from under him, bucklinghis knees and giving his shoulder an additional shove as he fell. Bannon slammedonto his back, sobbing for air.The morazeth was on top of him, pinning his shoulders to the ground. Her facewas close to his. He could see perspiration glistening on all the marks acrossher face, neck, and shoulders. She was laughing. “You’re not very good athand-to-hand combat, are you, boy?”“I never claimed to be.” He had gotten into a few brawls as a boy on ChiriyaIsland, but nothing where his life depended on it. In the scuffles, he hadsuffered bruises and torn clothes, with his pride injured more than his body.He remembered the training Nathan had given him in swordfighting skills, and themany monsters Bannon had killed made his talent self-evident. But the old wizardhad never spent time training him in fighting with his fists. Bannon couldn’timagine the erudite and dashing Nathan Rahl bothering with such a lowbrow formof fighting. He preferred his ornate sword as a more noble means of dispatchingan opponent.“I’d rather use a sword,” Bannon said, catching his breath. “But you would betoo afraid to let me have one.”Lila remained on top of him, pinning him down. Her eyes reminded him of thecolor of a stormy sea. Then she laughed and rolled off of him, springing back toher feet. “On the contrary, that was our next step.” She brushed sand from herbare skin and shouted up to the rim, “Bring me the sword. Toss it down here.”Within moments, a young man in drab clothes came to the edge of the pit holdinga long object wrapped in rough burlap. Without meeting Lila’s gaze, heunceremoniously dropped the package. Lila caught it with a deft move andstripped off the cloth. She pulled out a sword with a simple leather-wrappedhilt, a straight and unadorned cross guard, and a blade discolored fromimpurities in the steel during its forging.“That’s Sturdy!” Bannon cried, feeling a leap of hope inside his chest. “How didyou get it?”“Your friend Amos delivered it from the grand villa. He thought we might like touse it as a toy.” Lila turned the sword from side to side. “The blade is asunimpressive as you are, boy.”Bannon felt the burn of the insult. “Both of us may surprise you.”“Good. I like to be surprised.” With an expression of distaste, Lila extendedthe sword hilt-first toward Bannon. “Take it. You’ll need it.” She calledupward, “Stick!” The slave boy tossed down a polished wooden pole, which Lilacaught. “If you’re a swordsman, prove it. Fight me. Kill me if you can.”“I don’t want to kill you,” Bannon said.“You will.” Her thin smile flashed at him. “Or I am not training you properly.”When he didn’t move, Lila attacked him. She gritted her teeth, twirled thewooden rod, and swung at him.Instinctively, Bannon brought Sturdy up in a clean defensive move, met thewooden rod with a crack that jarred all the way through to the morazeth’swrists. A flicker of anger crossed her face, and she drew the rod back, moreserious now. She swung again, but Bannon felt comfortable with the sword in hishand. He deflected her blow and pushed forward. He would no longer be ondefense. He had a sword, his sword, and she just had a little stick. He couldn’tthink about what would happen if he did kill this morazeth. He was sure Adessaand the others would punish him.In the moment of distraction, Lila ducked under his guard and cracked the woodenstaff hard across his right thigh. The pain stung, and he nearly collapsed. Hisleg buckled, but he braced himself, straightened again, vowing to concentrate onthis fight, this enemy, and worry about the consequences later.He drove in, slashing sideways, jabbing with the point and sweeping in a reversearc. Lila spun and twirled like a tumbler at a traveling carnival show. Bannonmet the wooden staff each time she tried to strike him with it. He could tellshe was no longer toying with him, but genuinely fighting to the best of herabilities.And Bannon fought to the best of his.With a dim sense of peripheral vision, he realized that others had gathered atthe edge of the pit above, some morazeth and arena fighters. He didn’t care. Heneeded to defeat Lila. The red rage behind his eyes reminded him of what he hadfelt when he fought the Norukai at Renda Bay.He swung his sword like a scalpel and then a bludgeon. Nathan had taught himthat brute force was as acceptable as finesse, so long as it defeated the enemy.Lila found herself on the defensive now, holding up her wooden staff. Pale chipsflew as Sturdy’s blade hacked into the rod and finally cut it in two. The halvesof the fighting staff broke, and Lila staggered.Biting back a roar, Bannon swung his sword at her face, but at the last moment,turned the blade. He couldn’t kill her, couldn’t cleave her head in two.Instead, the flat of the blade struck her cheek with bruising force and drewblood. She collapsed backward, and Bannon was on top of her, driving her down.He shuddered, realizing what he had done. “Sorry,” he said quickly.Lila snatched something with a black-painted wooden handle from her hip. Heheard the snick, barely saw the tiny needle tip as Lila’s thumb touched thespell symbol carved into the hilt. She poked him with her agile knife, and painexploded within him. He threw himself backward, writhing in agony.Lila sprang to her feet, wiping blood from her face. As the thunder of painthrobbed through his head, Bannon heard cheers and shouts from the spectatorsabove. Looking smug, she stood over him and kicked Sturdy away out of his grasp.It slid across the pea gravel and sand.“A fighter must use any weapon available,” she said. “Winning is all thatmatters, because losers die.”After she put away her agile knife, the pain swiftly faded within him. Stillsprawled on his back, he propped himself up on his elbows, heaving greatbreaths, tossing his loose, long hair out of his face.“That is enough for now.” Lila raised her hand, and someone threw down a ropeladder from above. “Climb after me. It’s time to go back to your cell.”Though he ached from the fight, barely able to move in his exhaustion, Bannongot to his feet and followed her. Keeping his head down, he climbed the rope outof the pit and looked around at the spectators, who watched him with surpriseand even a hint of admiration.“This way,” Lila snapped, demanding his attention.They wound through the torch-lit tunnels, past other cells. Down otherconnecting corridors, Bannon could smell the musk of combat animals, the trainedkilling beasts kept by Chief Handler Ivan. He felt like nothing more than ananimal here.Lila brought him to the open door of his cell and said in a grudging voice,“That was a good effort. You may be worthwhile after all.”Bannon didn’t know if he should thank her or not.She shoved him into his cell, and he stumbled toward his pallet. Lila followedhim and closed the barred door behind her. “Time for my reward,” she said. “Andyours … if you know how to receive it.”Bannon swallowed hard, knowing and dreading what she intended to do. She removedthe black leather wraps and let them drop to the sandstone floor of his cell.Bannon’s pulse quickened. He blinked furiously and wiped perspiration from hisbrow. “I think … I think I need a drink of water.”Lila came closer, planting her hands on his chest. “I’m more concerned with whatI need.”Bannon could feel his pulse thrumming like a drumbeat inside him. With a wistfuldesperate memory, he thought of the lovely acolytes from Cliffwall, the warmembraces and tender kisses of Audrey, Laurel, and Sage, his first lovers,enthusiastic women who shared him and lifted him to honeyed heights ofpleasure … before Victoria had turned them into bloodthirsty forest monsters,who only wished to spill his blood to fertilize the ground.Lila seemed to be a little of both.Stepping toward him, naked, with her eyes fixed on him, she laid her agile knifein one of the small alcoves in the sandstone wall. “Don’t forget, it is alwayshere, right within reach. I suggest you not let me think of a reason to use it.”Then she wasn’t paying any attention to her weapon while Bannon fought anentirely different kind of battle."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 47 [contents.xhtml#c_ch47]Nicci had killed wizards before, and she had no qualms about doing so again. Infact, after the horrific bloodworking at the pyramid, she was sure she wouldhave to fight them, one at a time or all at once. Yes, she had to save theworld … for now, she would start with Ildakar.Overhead, the clouds seemed barely distorted by the shroud, but the air itselfhad an unnatural gleam. The sky was just slightly off, the wrong color of blue,as if the magical barrier somehow spoiled the sunlight. Pointing toward the sky,the gifted nobles looked pleased and content to be protected under the bubbleagain.If only she hadn’t hesitated when the slaves were ready to be sacrificed,expecting the wizards to use their killing knives in a more traditional manner.Sovrena Thora had been so focused on working her magic that Nicci could haveblasted her with Subtractive lightning or even just a furious windstorm tointerrupt the ritual before it could be completed.But Thora had slaughtered all her victims in one swift, unexpected slash of aninvisible knife.As the shaken duma members walked past in a subdued procession, Nicci and Nathanstood their ground. Nicci had brushed herself off, regained her dignity, andThora walked by, her head held high, her hair a complex tapestry of thin goldenbraids. The sovrena paused, glancing at Nicci. “It is time for you to be on ourside, Sorceress. You are under the shroud, and you cannot leave.”Maxim added cheerily, “Until such time as we decide to drop it. This is stilljust a temporary shield.”Thora’s face tightened. “Only for now. But I intend to work the blood magicagain with a large enough sacrifice to make the shroud permanent for centuries.”Her eyebrows lifted as she mused, “Maybe even forever. Since time passesdifferently here, it doesn’t make much difference.”“I cannot stay that long,” Nicci said. “Nathan has not been helped here, despiteyour efforts. We need to find our friend Bannon, and then we will leave.”“He is somewhere,” Thora said. “With Amos and his friends, I’m sure.”“Fear not; we’ll find something useful for you to do here,” Maxim murmured, thensauntered away at the sovrena’s side, oblivious of the sharp ice in Nicci’s blueeyes.Yes, she had killed wizards before. And she would do it again.Work crews pulled carts to the base of the pyramid while sullen slaves climbedthe steps to remove the bodies and polish the metal apparatus. Nathan’s eyes hada haunted quality. “Now it’s all the more important that I regain my gift. Ineed the heart of a wizard.” He looked around, scanning the crowd. “I wonderwhere that dear boy Bannon went?”* * *Because of the fleshmancer’s unsettling obsessions, Nathan went to talk to amore sympathetic listener. He wasn’t certain Elsa would be able to assist him,but at least she might offer advice. He was deeply disturbed by the slaughter hehad witnessed. Elsa had stood there holding her wicked-looking ceremonial knife,and even though she had made no active move to slash the throats of the slaves,she had been prepared to do so.In the late afternoon following the ritual, Nathan found Elsa in her elaborateprivate home. The front of her stone house was guarded by statues of leapingstags, and Nathan believed they were genuine artwork, rather thanspell-petrified animals.“Always delighted to see you, Nathan. We can discuss the nature of the gift,even if you can’t demonstrate your powers.”“Yet,” he said.“Yet,” she conceded, and gestured him inside to a lovely private courtyard. Elsahad iron-gray hair shot through with darker strands; in her younger years, shehad raven locks. Her features were quite pleasing, he decided, and he thoughtshe must have been beautiful, but now her curves had shifted, making her moredistinguished than gorgeous. He was still pleased to be in her company.She took a seat on a stone bench near a trickling artificial waterfall that raninto an ornamental pool. Water bubbled up from a hidden spring, perhaps drivenby the force of magic. The rocks around the pond were marked with spell symbols,though Nathan did not know how to interpret them.Sitting next to her, he could not contain his consternation. “Even when I hadfull control of my gift, I never … permitted anything like the blood magic wewitnessed this morning. Those innocent victims you sacrificed, all the blood youspilled—were they willing to pay that price? How could you tolerate that?”Elsa looked troubled, but not defensive. “Ildakar must be protected. That is howwe survived for so many hundreds of years. The shroud hides us from enemies,shields us from outside attack. If we had to battle an invading army, thousandsmore people would die.”“And what attack were you worried about this morning, my dear?” Nathan asked.“Why did the shroud need to be restored at the cost of those twelve poorpeople?”“They were not citizens of Ildakar, but brought here as slaves. The Norukaicould have sold them anywhere. If they didn’t die in the bloodworking, maybethey would have died in a quarry or a dank mine. Other masters could havetortured them to death at their own whim.”Nathan brushed his long white hair, but did not soften his voice. “And is thatwhat you do to your slaves?”“Of course not! How could you think that?”“Then those slaves might have lived long and productive lives, content in theirservice to you, to work in your home perhaps.”As if hearing the conversation, two of her slaves arrived bearing a platter offruit and a glass pitcher of water flavored with squeezed lemons.Elsa admitted, “That was not to be. The shroud is up again, and we are safe. Wehave to make our lives here now. We will still try to restore your magic,Nathan, so that you can be an important member of Ildakaran society. Even yourungifted but endearing friend Bannon can find a good occupation. He seems to bequite close with the sovrena’s son.”Nathan frowned. “I’m not certain that’s an entirely good influence. I haven’tseen the dear boy in days.”Elsa clucked her tongue. “With the shroud in place, it’s not as if he can goanywhere. I could make an inquiry, if you like?”He felt an unexpected relief. “Why yes, my dear, that would be most helpful. Oneless thing for me to worry about.”Though he was still disturbed, Nathan changed the subject. “Andre studied theloss of my gift and created a map of the Han inside me. I am missing animportant part centered around my heart.” Using his forefinger, he traced acircle around his breastbone. “But we’ve made no progress in some time, and I’mnot convinced he’s giving the matter his full attention. I don’t know yourparticular specialty with the gift, but I wondered if you might give me someadvice?”“Don’t play coy with me, Nathan,” Elsa said with a relieved smile. “You mustknow that I’m adept in transference magic. If you want me to transfer the giftback into you, I’m afraid that cannot be done. I can only do minor things withphysical objects.”“Transference magic?” Nathan asked. “I suspected as much. In the New World, suchpractitioners are rare. And you’ve developed it?”“It is a specialty of Ildakar, shifting power from rune to rune,” Elsa said. “Iuse the physical qualities in the world, and although I cannot add or takeaway—like with Additive or Subtractive Magic—I simply … move it.” She gesturedwith her hands. “I take a quality from one thing and transfer it to a differentthing.” Elsa glanced around. “For instance, look at this pitcher. Touch it.”Curious, Nathan reached out to touch the glass pitcher. It was cool but notcold, the water and juice tepid.“Hand me that unlit candle over there.” She gestured to the corner of the table.Nathan picked up a red candle in a small holder and slid it toward Elsa.With the tip of her finger she smeared a thin looping rune on the beadedmoisture on the side of the pitcher. Then with her fingernail she began to makethe same design in the wax of the candle. “See, I am taking heat from the waterin the pitcher and moving it from there to here.” She finished the drawing onthe candle wax.Suddenly the pitcher trembled. Sparkles of condensed water appeared along theoutside, and a faint whiff of chill vapor rose from the liquid it held. Incontrast, the wick of the candle flickered and burst into flame.Elsa smiled. “I drew the heat out of the pitcher and moved it to the candle.It’s all perfectly rational.”Nathan looked from one object to the other. “That is different from any methodI’m familiar with. It requires great study.”She smiled. “And I’m quite good at it. I could show you more … when you get yourgift back.”Nathan touched his chest. “But you can’t…?”“I’m afraid not. If Andre says you need the heart of a wizard, then you trulyneed the heart of a wizard.”“But I don’t know what that means.”“I’m certain Andre does. He’s just waiting for the right moment.”Nathan was frustrated. “And I suppose you think we have all the time in theworld now that the shroud is back in place.”“Well, we do. You’re safe here. Don’t be so eager to escape. We could have manymore conversations like this. I rather like your company.”“My dear Elsa, while I enjoy our conversations, I spent far too much of my lifeheld prisoner in the Palace of the Prophets. I did not go through all thetrouble of escaping just to wind up inside a larger prison.”“Nathan, you’re so dramatic,” she said.“I am indeed, but only when the situation warrants it.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 48 [contents.xhtml#c_ch48]The alarms, shouts, and roars woke Bannon from his aching slumber in thetunnels. He’d been restless, trying to find a glimmer of hope in his despair.The walls of his cell were hard, the candles burned down to guttering stubs andshedding only dim light. He curled on the pallet, but his bruises prevented himfrom finding a comfortable position.He had just dozed off, escaping into a blank darkness that was tinged withcapering nightmares. The growls and screams woke him up.His self-pity washed away, and he rolled off the pallet, instantly awake,searching in the dimness. He saw shadowy figures, animated silhouettes on thetunnel walls … movement out in the open areas where the fighters trained.An earsplitting bellow rattled the bars of his cage, and he saw a furredmonstrosity lurch into the common area, sweeping rakelike claws to bat away pitslaves who were trampled underfoot.Bannon gripped the iron bars of his cell and felt cold fear wash through him. Itwas an enormous combat bear, like the one they had killed in the foothills.“They’re loose! The animals are loose!” someone shouted. More figures dartedthrough the tunnels. Two determined morazeth dashed in, carrying clubs and shortswords, and threw themselves on the combat bear, but the beast smacked themsideways, smashing both women against the rough sandstone walls. The maddenedbear lumbered onward, as more animals bounded through the wide passageways thatconnected to Chief Handler Ivan’s pens.Bannon rattled the door of his cell, but the lock held. He was as trapped as anyof those beasts had been. But these creatures had gotten free.He was even more surprised to see brown-robed figures darting through thepassageway, shouting and banging on metal pots to provoke the animals. Theescaped beasts charged through the tunnel, glad to be free and attackinganything in front of them. The robed figures wore a mesh cloth over their facesand amulets dangling on their chests marked with a strange Ildakaran rune.“For Mirrormask!” they yelled. “For Mirrormask!”Another shouted, “We bring chaos and freedom to the city.”Bannon felt a chill. Mirrormask, the rebel leader? If they were creating havocby turning loose all of the chief handler’s combat creatures, maybe they wouldfree the slave fighters, too. He rattled the bars of his cage again, called out,hoping one of them would hear him, “Help me. Free us all!”One of the masked figures ran to where other trained fighters stood in theircells. Ian had come to the front of his large chamber, arms crossed over hismuscular chest, just watching. He made no move to get out, though Bannon knewhis door was unlocked.One of the masked figures darted up to Bannon’s cell, peered inside. The youngman offered a pleading look. “I have to get out of here! I need to find myfriends.”The figure hesitated. Behind the hood and the face covering, Bannon couldn’ttell if it was a man or a woman. Hands reached toward the cell lock.Another form darted up behind the robed figure and stabbed it brutally in theback. The rebel jerked, thrashed at the attacker, at the knife protruding fromits back, then spasmed in death.Lila stood there, her face twisted in anger as she cast the rebel aside, holdinga long knife in each hand. “The animals are dangerous enough, boy,” she snarledat him, “but these scum are worse.” She kicked at the fallen body, whichtwitched and writhed on the floor. She bent down to unmask the dying figure, butsomething strange happened with the last death rattle. The rune on the amuletglowed and smoked; then in a flash the entire body burst into flame. The searingheat drove Lila back. She held up her arms, crossing the bloody knife againstthe clean one to ward off the fire as she stepped back.Bannon retreated into his cell, away from the bars, as greasy flames rolledupward, stinking of charred flesh. In seconds, the dead rebel was nothing morethan blackened bones and a dark stain on the floor.Lila glared in disgust at the dissipating smoke. “Coward. They’re all cowards.”More unleashed animals thundered through the training pits. A scaly swamp dragonthe size of a small horse darted forward, snapping its jaws at anyone who stoodagainst it. Howling in unison, a pack of spiny wolves bounded free, throwingthemselves at three warriors who tried to defend their tunnels.One of the two morazeth stunned by the monstrous bear picked herself up,reeling. She turned to face the oncoming spiny wolves. Three of them fell uponher, but she fought with her bare hands, pounding them in the snouts with hardknuckles. Their fangs tore at her arms, her chest, her neck. One bit her handclean off, and she fell under the attack. More spiny wolves killed the secondinjured morazeth, who hadn’t even managed to climb to her feet.With a clatter of hooves like sledgehammers on stone, a bull with branched hornsthundered in from the pens, thrashing its head from side to side. It gored oneof the slaves and stormed through the open chamber. Steam flecked with bloodblasted from its nostrils. Finding the passage outside, the bull charged forwardinto the night.Lila growled at him from the other side of the bars, “You are safer here in yourcage, boy. Don’t let them get you. Step back.”Three more spiny wolves prowled after their pack, slower but more cunning thanthe others. Black lips curled back from their muzzles to expose long fangs.Their eyes were like green fire fixing on their target.“Watch out!” Bannon cried as the spiny wolves turned to attack Lila. She bracedherself and faced them with her arms outstretched, each hand holding a longblade. The masked rebel had been an easy kill for her, but these predators wouldbe much more difficult.Bannon stepped away from the bars. He hated those who had imprisoned him,resented what Lila had done to him, but these animals slaughtered anyone insight, including the slave workers and captive fighters. He wasn’t certain thatMirrormask was much better than the other oppressors in Ildakar. Bannon didn’tknow what the rebels expected to buy with all this blood, but they certainlywere willing to spend it generously.The spiny wolves lunged at Lila. With a quick jerk of her right hand, sheslashed the throat of the first one that bore down on her. She shoved it asideand whirled to face the next. Two more spiny wolves charged after her, and sheretreated down the tunnel, slashing with both knives.Bannon ran to the bars, pressed his face against them, but Lila was out of view.He couldn’t see whether or not she was alive. He had not heard her scream, buthe knew Lila would never scream.One of the wolves charged his cage, slamming its muscular, furred body againstthe door. With a yelp, Bannon staggered backward. The beast snapped its jaws,spraying hot saliva as it tried to get through the bars. The growl in its throatwas a manifestation of pure anger and hatred directed at any human, becausehumans had tortured it. The spiny wolf ran its paws along the bars of the cage,trying to pull them apart. The iron rattled, but held. When the creaturecouldn’t break in, it cast a final green-eyed glare at Bannon, then loped afterthe rest of the pack, which had advanced up the tunnel to the outside.Adessa stormed into the open area, outraged at this disruption. She held a shortsword, not bothering with a shield. The morazeth leader meant to inflict damage.Masked rebels bounded through the passageways, banging metal pots, shouting torile up the animals and urge them out of the pits and into the city streets.Another swamp dragon scuttled forward, hissing, and a warrior trainee stood toface it. With a vicious thrash of its jagged tail, it cut the legs off the manjust below the knee. He screamed and fell as the reptile thing snatched up oneof the severed legs in its powerful jaws, crunching down on the bone. The hoodedrebels appeared right behind it, banging and shouting, and the big lizardstormed off, still clenching the man’s leg in its mouth.Ignoring the animals, Adessa attacked her real enemy. The rebels could notdefend themselves against her focused anger. Most of them scattered and tried toflee, but one was too slow. Adessa thrust her sword through the robed man’sback. The rebel collapsed and burst into flames triggered by the mysteriousamulet. She turned, dodged a spotted leopard that seemed more skittish thanferocious. The lean cat streaked off through the tunnels and into the night, butAdessa remained to hunt down the rebels. She killed three more, paying noattention as they burst into their own funeral pyres.She was so focused on punishing Mirrormask’s fighters that she failed to protectherself against the rampaging creatures. Another monstrous reptile scuttledtoward Adessa from behind. She didn’t see it coming.“Beware!” Ian screamed from inside his cell. In a flash, he flicked the lock,threw open the barred door, and sprinted out toward the swamp dragon. Adessafinished killing her victim and spun just in time to see the reptile lunge forher. Even without weapons, Ian leaped on its back and wrapped his arms aroundthe scaly creature’s throat, tugging backward. He just managed to pull itssnapping jaws away from her.Adessa flashed him an appreciative glance, then drove her short sword directlythrough the swamp dragon’s left eye, shoving the blade into its brain. Thearmored thing twitched and shuddered, then collapsed with a gurgle.“Always my champion,” Adessa said, and Ian looked at her adoringly.Bannon stared, sickened.With a bellow as loud and fearsome as any of the combat beasts, a human voiceechoed off the sandstone walls of the pits. “By the Keeper! Back to your cages.”Chief Handler Ivan emerged from a side entry and glared at the wild animalsracing loose from their pens. He wore his panther jerkin with a wide black beltcinched at his waist; his mane of dark hair stuck out around his head as if hehimself were a raging beast. His arms were bare, his muscles bunched. His facewas drawn back in a grimace of vengeful disappointment that made Bannon shudder.That expression reminded him of how his father had looked, just before beatinghim or his mother. Bannon felt a surge of fury, imagining what these animalsmust have endured under the chief handler’s torment.“Oh, what you must have done to them,” he whispered to himself.Many beasts had already escaped to run loose in the city, but others snarled andcringed in the tunnels. Some whimpered as Ivan held up his hands, unleashing hisgift with a crackle of energy. He lashed out with the magic that ground theseanimals under his mental boot heel.“You will all return to your places!” Ivan gestured with a boulder-sized fist.Two leopards snarled, then slunk back into the dim tunnels toward his cage. Aspeckled boar snorted, stuttered forward, but retreated. The chief handlerreleased more magic, trying to wrangle the unruly creatures.But three tawny shapes moved in the opposite direction, as if attracted byIvan’s voice—the troka of spell-bonded panthers that had been pitted against thehalf-stone warrior Ulrich. They glided forward, their golden eyes bright, theirropelike tails flashing. The panthers moved in unison, each step perfectlymatched, their predatory gaze fixed on Ivan.He faced them, defiant, holding up both fists. His face twisted with the strainof releasing his gift. The sand panthers bared their saberlike fangs, and theominous sound from their feline throats seemed more threatening than an actualsnarl.“Back to your cages, damn you!” Ivan roared. He flexed his biceps, gritted histeeth. A surge of his gift rippled through the air. Other combat animals in thechamber whimpered and scattered, running back to their familiar pens.But the troka of panthers merely twitched, each one able to deflect the chiefhandler’s control. They crouched back, enduring the pain and refusing to move.Ivan’s face grew ruddy with the effort; then he reached to his waist and pulledout a long gutting knife. “All right, then. It looks like I’ll have new peltsfor my wardrobe.” He raised the blade.Then the panthers were upon him.They sprang in unison, driving at him from the front and from each side. Anastonished Ivan flung up his muscular arms to defend himself, but the snarlingcats raked their claws down his chest. Fangs bit into his biceps, crunching andtearing. One panther bit the base of his neck, severing his spinal cord; anotherbit his shoulder and tore out a huge hunk of red meat that dripped with blood.Crimson spray gouted from the severed blood vessels. The third panther rippedopen Ivan’s belly and dug out his intestines, shaking her head like a kittenwith a long strand of yarn.Ivan screamed and fought, but the sand panthers mauled him until their tan furwas matted with rich red liquid. Flicking their tails in satisfaction, the threepanthers left their bloody mess and bounded off into the night and freedom.Bannon pressed his back against the rear wall of his cell, waiting for thenightmare to be over."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 49 [contents.xhtml#c_ch49]Alarms summoned the ruling council in the dead of night. At the upper level ofthe plateau, Nicci and Nathan rushed out of the grand villa. Below them, thestreets of Ildakar filled with frenetic activity, as if the city had been calledto war.Nicci had both of her daggers, expecting violence, wondering if Mirrormask hadfinally staged his all-out revolt, since he had not acted during thebloodworking that raised the shroud. Nathan retrieved his ornate sword from hisroom, ready to fight, though he didn’t know what enemies they might face.“The combat beasts are loose!” called a humorless but reliable guard namedStuart, who had taken the place of High Captain Avery. Now wearing the redshoulder pauldron, he led a squad of armored guards, raising swords as they allran down the streets. “We need every fighter. Call the archers and crossbowmen.The arena animals are on the rampage—the rebels set them free.”Nicci said to Nathan, “Let’s join them, Wizard. This is something we cansupport—for the sake of those who cannot fight for themselves … the innocents.”“You called me ‘Wizard,’” Nathan said, with a surprised smile.“I have always considered you a wizard, even if you’re an ineffective one,” shesaid. “I know you can use your sword, even if you can’t use your magic.”The city guards and the duma members were converging near the arena and thetunnels where the animals and fighter trainees were kept. Fleshmancer Andre,whose studio was near the area, had arrived first, perplexed. Sovrena Thora andWizard Commander Maxim were also already there.Nicci hurried forward, summoning her magic, while Nathan drew his sword and keptpace with her. They heard the shouts of frightened people in the streets, thegrowls and roars of rampaging animals. Arriving on their heels, the wizardQuentin looked only partially dressed, and Elsa bustled up from a side street,tugging to adjust her purple robe. Damon was the last to arrive.“Where’s Ivan?” Thora bellowed. “He must get his creatures under control!”Spotted leopards, spiny wolves, and scaled swamp dragons milled about, attackinganything that moved. A combat bear and a monstrous bull crashed forward,attracted by the screams of fleeing people. A woman chose the wrong direction torun, and the bull gored her with its split horns.Spiny wolves bounded out, leaping at anyone they encountered, while Stuart’scity guards fought them with swords, clubs, and gauntleted fists. But the wildbeasts were trained to kill, and more guards died than animals.Among the city guard and the wizards who fought the unleashed animals, Nicci sawyoung Amos and his ever-present companions, all three young men carrying theiriron-tipped wooden staffs, which they used to smash the rampaging animals. ButBannon wasn’t with them.The three young men looked eager to assist in the fight—not to help the city butfor the opportunity to shed blood. Amos darted in and swung his wooden staff tobash the skull of a writhing leopard that rolled bleeding on the street afterits side had been slashed open by a sword. “Got one!”Jed and Brock sought their own targets.Nicci seized Amos’s half cape as he flitted by, dragging him to a halt. “Whereis Bannon? I thought he would be with you.”The young man shook off her grip. “Not now! We have important work to do.” Heflicked his gaze away, not wanting to meet hers. “He’s fine. Don’t worry abouthim.” Amos dashed off with great exuberance, and Nicci was too busy to demandmore of an answer.The combat bear lumbered forward, a titanic mass of claws and fur. Maxim, Thora,and Damon stood together, releasing magic and hurling attacks, all of which slidharmlessly off the protective runes on the monster’s hide.Elsa did not use her gift to attack the bear directly, but made the ground infront of it crackling cold, transferring temperature from the street; at thesame time, a gush of heat flared up next to the charging bull, making the beastrampage in a different direction.The combat bear stumbled across the bitterly frozen ground and came at Elsa. Sheattempted to work another spell, but Nathan tackled her to the side. The bearcharged past, then turned back to come at them again.Nathan held up his sword and braced himself. “I already fought your brother,monster! Now I’ll fight you!” He swung the blade, tracing a complex tauntingpattern in the air. The bear swatted at him, but Nathan used the razor edge tosplit the bear’s paw to the middle of its forearm. The creature roared andyanked back its bloody arm.Nicci dove in, jabbing hard with both daggers, stabbing opposite sides of thecreature’s neck. She succeeded in cutting the bear’s throat. Pushing in close,Nathan plunged his blade into the beast’s side, working through the layers ofmuscle and fat, driving the steel all the way to the hilt. The titanic bearcrashed to the ground.Maxim and Thora continued their fight with magic, using secondary effects todivert or hamper the rampaging animals.Emerging from the tunnels, two hooded figures shouted at the crowd, “ForMirrormask! Bring down the oppressors.”Maxim’s face twisted in a disappointed scowl, and he flung his hand sideways,invoking his petrification spell. The two cheering rebels crackled, froze, andturned into white stone.Quentin released magic that sent a tremor through the street, cracking theflagstones as the enhanced bull charged forward. Its left hoof fell into thewidening crack, and the foreleg snapped as the bull was carried forward by itsmomentum. Trapped, the beast shook its head from side to side, trying to plungeits branched horns into soft flesh. The bull lurched ahead again, its brokenforeleg upraised. People scattered out of its way.The arena beasts reveled in their freedom, ready to attack any prey in theirconfusion. One of the swamp dragons grabbed a merchant out of his doorway andpulled him screaming into the street. A second giant lizard scuttled close andbit his head off.Drenched in blood and shaking from their battle with the combat bear, Nicci andNathan stood shoulder-to-shoulder and rallied as a pack of spiny wolves chargedtoward them. One wolf caught Nicci by surprise, driving her backward as sheraised her daggers. Instinctively, she released a ball of wizard’s fire, but theheat rippled up and away from the enormous wolf, deflected by the protectiverunes branded on its hide.Recovering, she stabbed her left dagger through its ribs and cut downward,slicing it open. Even though Nicci had delivered a mortal wound, the infuriatedcreature kept attacking. More wolves piled on her, but Nathan rushed in,decapitating one with a downstroke of his sword. Shouting, he hacked the spineof one, thrust the blade deep into the haunch of another. The maddened wolvesdid not retreat—but they did die, one by one.As the wizard Quentin fought, he snarled at Andre, “How do we kill these things?You created them.”“Yes, I did! Aren’t they magnificent?”“Magnificent until they tear you apart,” Damon snapped. “Don’t they have anyweaknesses?”The fleshmancer snorted. “If I knew of any weaknesses, I would have removedthem, hmmm?”Elsa tried to work a spell, but was frustrated. “Our magic doesn’t work onthem.”“That is the way they are designed, to be better fighters in the arena. We’lljust have to be superior, hmmm?” Andre said, smiling. “And we are indeedsuperior.”Finally, High Captain Stuart called in his archers. Dozens of crossbowmenclimbed to the rooftops and balconies of the nearby buildings. They wound backtheir strings and loaded quarrels. “Aim carefully, but kill them all!” Stuartshouted.A rain of sharp metal quarrels peppered the rampaging bull, leaving it lookinglike the pincushion of a greedy seamstress. The beast groaned and staggered,barely able to walk with its broken forelimb. It tottered, went down on theother leg, and crashed to the street.“Reload!” Stuart yelled. Choosing their targets at a glance, the crossbowmenshot at the scattered animals, and another rain of crossbow bolts killed fourspiny wolves and the two swamp dragons. The leopards fell alongside the deadcombat bear.A speckled boar the size of an ox stampeded out of the shadows, and more thantwenty arrows barely slowed it. The boar slashed the air with its horribletusks, and High Captain Stuart killed the thing himself by thrusting his swordthrough its chest again and again.As the archers reloaded, Nicci saw the troka of sand panthers emerge from thedark tunnel, covered with blood. They looked much like Mrra, bound to oneanother from the time they were cubs—but not bonded to her. They loped forward,snarling.Nicci and Nathan stood side by side, blades ready, as the sand panthers closedin. Their feline muscles bunched, their claws extended to attack.Stuart shouted, and a storm of quarrels blanketed the troka of panthers, dozensof shafts killing them before they could even spring. The three magnificent catslay dead on the ground, covered in blood. Nicci felt a sharp sympathetic pain,but she knew it was a mercy that all three sister panthers died simultaneously.She remembered the trauma and despair Mrra had felt after losing herspell-bonded sisters, left alone and alive.Arrows still clattered on the streets, and the city guard ranged through nearbyalleys, looking for stragglers. Dead animals lay everywhere, on doorsteps, inthe gutters, out in the open.“I believe they’re all slaughtered,” Damon said. “The city is saved.”The ache in Nicci’s heart washed away the rush of energy from the fight.“They’re all dead,” Elsa replied, shaking her head. “They were so desperate toget away.”“They were driven to this by the chief handler,” Nicci said, turning to Thora.“What did you expect would happen if they got loose?”“I did not expect them to get loose,” said the sovrena.“The air stinks of blood,” Elsa said.“Yes it does, my dear.” Nathan brushed at his own red-drenched robes. “We allneed fresh garments.”Thora’s face twisted in a rictus of hate. “This was caused by Mirrormask and hisrebels. They mean to bring down our society, to cause harm to our way of life.”She gestured to the butchered animals and the dozen or more human bodies thatlay strewn in the streets. “And this! If the rebels care so much about the lowerclasses, then perhaps they shouldn’t have unleashed these wild animals upon thecity! Look at all the dead!”“The people should have just gotten out of the way,” Maxim said. “Now half ofour fighting specimens are dead. How disappointing.”“They only did what they were born and trained to do,” Nicci said. “ChiefHandler Ivan lost control.”“Where is Ivan?” Sovrena Thora snapped. “We need to understand what went wrong.”Fleshmancer Andre emerged from the tunnels, where he and several city guards hadgone. Just behind him, Adessa and two morazeth came out, bloody and exhausted.Rather than looking defeated or troubled, Andre had a gleam in his eyes. Hestepped directly up to Nathan. “Good news for you, my friend. Good news indeed.We must take advantage of this.” He said the next two words with deliberateintent. “Wizard Nathan.”“What happened?” Nathan asked.“The sand panthers attacked and mauled Ivan.”“He is dead,” Adessa announced. “The cats tore him to pieces. I saw it.”“Nearly dead.” Andre raised a finger. “Thankfully, I used a spell to preservehim at the moment of infinite agony, on the edge of his death. He is suspendedthere, but the Keeper doesn’t have him yet. Still, we should hurry.”Nicci was too exhausted and angry to play games. “Hurry to do what?”“Why, this is your chance, Nathan! Chief Handler Ivan is dying … but his heartis intact. This is exactly what you’ve been waiting for since you arrived inIldakar, hmmm? The heart of a wizard.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 50 [contents.xhtml#c_ch50]Bloody after the battle in the training tunnels, Adessa rolled a wooden cart outinto the street. One of the wooden wheels squeaked and wobbled as she pulled italong. Its red-stained bed held the burly form of Chief Handler Ivan.Adessa released the handles and turned toward the bloody form lying in theshadows. “Ivan used this cart to bring butchered meat for his pets.” She smiledat the irony. “It seemed appropriate.”Taking Nathan’s wrist, Andre pulled him closer. “Come, you must see! What awonderful opportunity, hmmm?”Nathan looked down at the body, disturbed. The chief handler sprawledmotionless. The tan leather of his jerkin had been shredded by the claws. Fangshad savaged his spine, torn a huge chunk from his shoulder, ripped open hisribs. The three panthers had eviscerated him, and his glistening guts lay spreadout. Ivan’s bearded face was twisted, his lips drawn back to expose his teeth,as if caught in a howl. His eyes were wide open and staring—but frozen.“You were most fortunate, Nathan. If I hadn’t been here…” Andre gestured to theman’s torn abdomen. Ivan looked like a clumsily gutted fish.“I am not feeling terribly lucky right now,” Nathan said.“Oh, but you should, hmmm? The sand panthers caused horrific damage, but the ribcage and breastbone protected his heart. The organ is intact—exactly what youneed.”Nicci showed no grief for the man’s bloody and painful end. “He deservedwhatever they did to him, but Ivan is dead now, just like the cats he trained.”She looked around them, where workers with carts were cleaning up the massacre,hauling corpses away, animals and humans alike. The city guard plucked crossbowbolts from the bodies to wash and return them to their store of weapons.Downcast slaves came forward with buckets to wash the blood off the streets,kneeling to scrub with thick, stiff-bristled brushes.“Oh, but Ivan isn’t dead, Sorceress,” Andre said. “I reached him just in time.He was very near death, wallowing in agony, bleeding every drop of life away. Ifear his heart had only a few more beats left in it. But I worked my spell andpreserved him. I stopped time around his body, so he will endure that lastendless moment of pain, on the very cusp of death. I’m sure he desperately wantsthat moment to end, to slip through the veil into the underworld. But is thereany better way for one to remember being alive, hmmm?”“I can think of many better ways,” Nicci said.Nathan shook his head, exhausted and trying to understand. He could barelybreathe with the suffocating stench of blood hanging like a metallic fog in theair.“As I said, Nathan—and soon I will call you Wizard Nathan, ha ha!” Thefleshmancer reached down to touch the mangled body, running his fingers throughthe sticky blood that covered the leather jerkin. “In order to restore yourgift, you need the heart of a wizard. Chief Handler Ivan is a powerful wizard,and as you can see, he no longer needs his heart. I intend to give it to you.”As if with a sympathetic connection, Nathan’s own heart skipped a beat. “Accepthis heart? You mean … in a literal sense?”“Of course, my friend! What did you think I was talking about, some esotericwish? I am a fleshmancer. You have been to my studio. You’ve watched me workwith living forms as a sculptor works clay.”Nathan shuddered, taking a step back from the cart and its bloody burden. Herecalled with the clarity of shattered crystal how Andre had created thetwo-headed fighter from the pieces of grievously injured fighters. “Dearspirits…”Andre was not deterred. “It is the only way to restore your gift, as I said. Ithought that was what you wanted, hmmm?”Nathan reeled, and Nicci reached out to grasp his arm. Her fingers felt like aniron clamp. She turned to the fleshmancer with clear challenge in her tone. “Howcan you be certain this will work?”“There are never guarantees, Sorceress. We are speaking of magic, and there isa … variable factor. But I am confident. I’ve done far more challengingexperiments.” He glanced at the bodies of the monstrous arena animals beinghauled away. “I’ve had mixed success, I admit, but I am an artist.” He strokedhis bloody hands down the thick braided beard on his chin, leaving red streakson the pale whiskers. His eyes bored into Nathan’s uncertain expression. “Isthis not why you came to Ildakar in the first place? Did you not stand beforethe wizards’ duma and beg for our help to restore your gift? This is us helpingyou.” He gestured to the torn body.The glint of agony on Ivan’s face remained unchanged. The whites of hispain-widened eyes were muddled with red from hemorrhages. Nathan could onlyimagine how much torment the chief handler was undergoing, endlessly, everyinstant.Perhaps as much pain as he himself had inflicted on the animals that hadattacked him.Swallowing hard, Nathan felt his pulse racing, his heart beating. His heart, theheart that had lost its Han, thus rendering him useless as a wizard. Yes, he hadread the words written in his life book, Red’s pronouncement. From Kol Adair hewould behold what he needed to make himself whole again—and from Kol Adair hehad seen this marvelous city in the distance. Ildakar.The wizards of Ildakar were among the most powerfully gifted in all of history.This was why he and his companions had come here. He had begged for a solution.How often had he demanded that Andre find a way? And if this was the only way inwhich he could regain his gift, the only way he could be a powerful wizardagain, then Nathan must do it to help Nicci, and Bannon … and even Mirrormask.Was that their destiny? If he had his gift back, they could remake the city ofIldakar into the wondrous place it aspired to be. That was exactly what Richardhad dispatched them to do, to spread his cause of freedom, to help build agolden age for the new and expanded D’Haran Empire.Yes, this was why Nathan had come to Ildakar.“I agree,” he said, in a quiet voice. “I’ll do it.” He looked at Nicci, knowingshe could read the tension on his face. But he was Nathan Rahl. He was strong.He was brave. And he had already lived more than a thousand years.“As you wish, Wizard,” Nicci said.“Good, good!” The fleshmancer rubbed his hands together. He barked orders at twoslave workers who were lifting a spiny wolf onto a sledge to haul the body away.“Come, take this cart to my studio. It isn’t far—bring the chief handler. Nathanand I will follow. We have much to accomplish this night.”* * *As he sat on the clean table inside the fleshmancer’s studio, Nathan felt coldsweat on his body. Memories of what he had previously seen there yammeredthrough his mind, but he tried to control his thoughts.“Nothing to fear,” he muttered to himself, but the words sounded false to thepoint of being ridiculous. He had much to fear and much to endure, but he hadmade his decision.“Remove your robe and smallclothes, Nathan, or they will be completely soakedand ruined with all the blood.”“I don’t find that statement very heartening,” Nathan muttered.“Heartening? Quite amusing, my friend,” the fleshmancer chuckled.Nathan found no humor in the unintended joke. He drew a breath and undid hisborrowed wizard’s robe, exposing his chest. “When I have my gift back, I willwear this proudly. I will have earned it.” He slipped the green robe off andcast it on the floor beside the table. Naked, he lay back on the cold surface.Ready.Andre puttered about, humming to himself. “I agree, and now that the shroud isrestored, you shall be here in Ildakar for a long time to come. You’ll haveample opportunity to exercise your gift. And there is an important purpose now,hmmm?”“What is that?” Nathan asked.“After the death of Ivan, and with Renn gone, the wizards’ duma is certainly inneed of a new member. Perhaps that could be you.”On the table adjacent to Nathan lay the chief handler’s burly form. The mangledjerkin was peeled away to expose his torn flesh. His eyes still stared upwardwith that single spark of endless pain.The fleshmancer ran his hands over Ivan’s broad chest. He bent close to theman’s bearded face, to the snarled agony on his lips. “My dear Ivan, we had somefine times did we not? I did tell you on numerous occasions that if you playedwith such dangerous pets, then someday you would get hurt. I created them, and Iknow how dangerous they can be.” He stroked the skin, pressed his palm down onthe breastbone, listened, frowned.“But with half of your animals slain in such a debacle, you would have died fromembarrassment, I’m sure. This way your death serves a glorious purpose, helpingto restore poor Nathan. Now he can become the powerful wizard that youapparently failed to be.” Andre grinned down at the burly man. “Not that youever wished to help people, did you?”He straightened the fingers on both of his hands and pointed them down, palmstogether, like a pair of spatulas. Summoning his gift, the fleshmancer dippedhis fingertips directly into Ivan’s chest. He pushed downward, easilypenetrating the skin and the breastbone as if it were no more than butter, thenpulled his hands apart. A loud crack and a wet squelching sound accompanied themovement, and a red, yawning gap opened in the center of Ivan’s chest. Thefleshmancer moved aside the pieces he didn’t need, exposing the beet-red hearttangled with veins and nestled between his pink foamy lungs. “My, what a beauty!Would you like to have a look, Nathan?”“No, I don’t think so.” Nathan’s stomach twisted and roiled. He lay back,breathing hard.Andre rummaged around inside Ivan’s chest cavity, using his fingertips tomagically snip the connecting blood vessels, working his gift on the time-frozenheart. Finally he lifted his trophy, like a midwife holding up a newly deliveredbaby. “There we are!”Nathan dredged up his courage again. This is what I wanted. This is why I cameto Ildakar.“You look terribly frightened, my friend. There’s no need. Have confidence inme.” Andre smiled. Specks of blood dotted his pale cheeks. “I’ve never actuallydone this before, but I’m certain I can figure it out.”Nathan quailed, tried to cringe away, but he could barely move.The fleshmancer reached a bloody hand toward where Nathan lay, gestured with hisfingers, and released a quick flow of his gift. The magic washed over Nathan’schest like a bucket of water on a cold winter’s morning. He found he couldn’tmove. Everything inside him was completely frozen.“I’ve stopped time within you as well. Your heart is no longer beating, yourbody no longer functioning, your blood no longer flowing. Fortunately, your mindstill works. Your thoughts are able to observe what I am doing. As an educatedman and a wizard, you’ll appreciate the experience.”Nathan wanted to cry out, but he couldn’t flinch, couldn’t control a cell in hisbody.“The nerves themselves still function,” Andre continued, “so I’m afraid you’llfeel all of the pain. Just keep in mind, it is a reminder that you are stillalive.” He leaned close to Nathan’s face. “And you will feel very, very alive.”He ran his fingers down Nathan’s chest, caressing the skin, lingering longerthan was absolutely necessary. Nathan couldn’t raise his head to see exactlywhat the fleshmancer was doing. He watched Andre straighten his fingers just ashe had done above Ivan.Andre plunged his hands deep into Nathan’s chest."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 51 [contents.xhtml#c_ch51]The two visiting ships spent several days in Serrimundi, where Harborlord Ottowas quite accommodating. The man remembered Oliver and Peretta, and he’d heardpositive reports about Lord Rahl from travelers and traders out of Tanimura.Though Serrimundi had not yet declared overt allegiance to the D’Haran Empire,the people in the city were thriving. They, too, had spent generations under thestranglehold of the Imperial Order, but now with Jagang defeated, the cause offreedom spread down the coast with the speed of rumor. The people flourishedwithout being harassed by petty warlords or would-be tyrants. The power vacuumin the Old World had been filled by determined, hardworking people who chosetheir own rulers and governed themselves fairly. Several minor local bullies hadappeared in scattered villages, but the citizens had united to run thosepuffed-up tyrants out of town.Upon receiving the writ of credit from the D’Haran treasury, hand-delivered byGeneral Zimmer, the harborlord arranged for a third ship to join the expeditionand then rounded up the requested horses from local stables and ranchers in thecoastal hills. The mounts were a mixed lot, but all healthy and strong. Thegeneral dispatched a request for payment by courier on the next northbound ship.Zimmer assured the harborlord that all bills would be paid by Lord Rahl.Although the Serrimundi merchants and inland herd masters had been skeptical,the price offered was substantial, and they took the chance.Harborlord Otto looked at Oliver and Peretta, shaking his head. “We owe thesetwo a debt … or at least my daughter does.” Then he smiled. “And it is an excusefor us to strengthen trade with the cities to the north.” He patted thepromissory note and tucked it inside his open shirt. “If it opens our marketswith the rest of the D’Haran Empire, it’s worth gambling on a few horses.”* * *The three ships sailed below the Phantom Coast, led by the large vessel they hadconscripted in Serrimundi. The captains and crews were noticeably more anxious,since these were entirely uncharted waters. They doubled the lookouts, wary ofhidden reefs as well as vicious selka. Every person aboard had heard reports ofhow the Wavewalker was destroyed.Captain Ben Mills came to report to the general in his cabin in the stern, wherePrelate Verna sat with him, discussing plans for after they disembarked in RendaBay. Captain Mills carried a disorganized bundle of rolled charts tucked underhis arm. He fumbled with them, juggled the rolls, and let most of them drop tothe cabin deck. He rescued one and spread the chart out on the small table nextto General Zimmer’s bunk.The captain wore a salt-weathered gray uniform and a cap over his long andunruly white hair. His wrinkled face had been hardened by years of sun and oceanwind, but a smile softened his face to the consistency of well-worked leather.“We sailed south as you commanded, General. Captain Piller from the Serrimundiship is most familiar with these waters, but not from actual experience.” Hecleared his throat, rubbed at his Adam’s apple. “In my trading route I rarelyventured this direction. Other than a few fishing villages with no harbors tospeak of, there’s nothing down here, a great uninhabitable expanse.…” He shookhis head. “I know we’re following the orders of Lord Rahl, but I certainly hopeyou know where you’re going.”He traced his fingers along the chart showing familiar cities and ports of call,but the lines were more uncertain toward the bottom of the map, with ominousnotations, question marks, and drawings of fearsome sea monsters that lay inwait for sailors who ventured too far from home.“I’m confident the two scholars from Cliffwall know where they’re going,” Vernasaid. “They were meticulous in noting their journey. Beyond the Phantom Coast,the lands are inhabited again. Renda Bay is sizable, and there are many othersettlements upriver and in the mountains.”“Think of it as a future trading opportunity, Captain,” General Zimmer said. “Awhole continent of new customers for you, and new allies for D’Hara.”The captain scratched his tangled locks of white hair, adjusting his cap. “Ifyou say so. The stories from old mariners say that this desolation goes all theway to the edge of the world.”“Unlikely,” said Zimmer. “No doubt it’s just an intemperate section of thecoast, sluggish currents and unpredictable breezes. We’ll get past it.”The weather had been accommodating, and the three ships remained in sight of thecoast, but the water turned brown. The heat increased as the sun baked down dayafter day, and the breezes were no stronger than the breath of a dying man.“I used to be confident of my records,” said Captain Ben, “but the currents andconstellations have changed.”“You can learn the world all over again.” Verna still felt optimistic about whatthe great archive of Cliffwall held for them. “Consider yourself an explorer,Captain. We discover new things every day.”“Indeed we do. It’s very exciting,” he said in a deadpan voice. He rolled up hischart again and retrieved the other rolls on the deck.* * *The horses did not like to be confined belowdecks. After several days, many weresick, weak, and restless, but the two Cliffwall scholars insisted that Renda Baywas not far. “We have to be close,” Oliver said, squinting at the distantshoreline. “I don’t know the currents, but our voyage north was no longer thanthis, and we were in a very small boat.”“I recognize those landforms,” Peretta said. “No more than a day, I wouldguess.”The next morning was surrounded by a blanket of thick fog. The mist felt cooland welcome after the sluggish heat of the past several days. All three captainstrimmed their sails because they could not see the way ahead. The fogintensified the silence in the air, made the lapping waves sound louder,amplified the creak of wood in the hulls and the masts.Verna came out on deck wrapped in her Sister robes. Feeling the dampness on herskin, she pulled the fabric close and peered into the white murk. High above,the lookout called, “Ho there! A boat ahead—a small vessel.” His words carriedacross the water, and lookouts on the other three ships took up the call.A voice responded from the mist, “It’s not a small vessel! This is the Daisy, afine fishing boat out of Renda Bay.”Oliver and Peretta stood close to Prelate Verna. They both waved, though the fogwas too thick for anyone to see them. Oliver said, “It’s the fisherman who tookus up to Serrimundi.”Peretta called out, “Kenneth! We came back with sailing ships and anexpeditionary force.”The fisherman laughed. “Is that my two friends from far away?”The Daisy drifted closer, resolving from a dim silhouette in the mist. Peeringover the rail, Verna saw a sturdy midsize fishing boat and the figure of a manat the bow. He seemed to be the only one aboard.Zimmer’s soldiers crowded the decks of all three ships, but Kenneth did not seemintimidated. He stood with his hands on his hips, his shirt open wide to exposehis chest even in the cool misty morning. He lifted his bearded chin, laughing.“I thought I was the only one who sailed this far north. These waters areusually empty, and the old tales say that this is the end of the world.Fortunately, Oliver and Peretta showed me otherwise.”Verna called down, “And we were told this is the edge of the world as well, butfrom the opposite direction! A good thing the edges can meet.”All three sailing vessels dropped anchor, and Kenneth tied the Daisy to theflagship and came aboard to meet with General Zimmer and Captain Mills, thoughhe was more eager to be reunited with the two young scholars from Cliffwall.Seeing Kenneth climb aboard, Peretta turned to the captain with a proud sniff.“I told you we were close. Renda Bay is just down the coast.”“Now, it’s not all that close,” Kenneth corrected her. “I’ve sailed north fortwo days on this run. I catch the best fish up here, because there aren’t anyother fishermen in the area.”“I hope your catch is for sale, because my men are tired of eating smoked beefand salted mutton,” General Zimmer said.Kenneth’s eyes lit up. “Smoked beef and salted mutton? I will happily trade mycatch for such exotic food.”They looked at one another in surprise, then burst out laughing. The deal waseasily struck.When the fog burned off, Kenneth set out in the Daisy, guiding them around asmall patch of treacherous reefs. By dusk the next day they arrived in Renda Baywith great fanfare, the three large ships anchoring outside the mouth of thehalf-moon harbor. Kenneth took a load of people into the bay aboard the Daisy,while the members of the D’Haran army lowered smaller boats and rowed a dozenpassengers at a time over to shore, after which they began the more tedious taskof building rafts in order to unload the many horses.Verna and General Zimmer rode with Oliver and Peretta aboard the Daisy, sailingdirectly into the harbor to spread the news and gather the townspeople.Thaddeus, the town leader, was astonished to see the three huge ships outsidethe mouth of the bay. He met the Daisy on the dock.Oliver greeted him with a relieved smile. “We’re back, and we broughtreinforcements. They can help defend against attacks if the raiders come again.”Stepping out onto the solid dock, General Zimmer looked at the towers underconstruction on either side of the harbor’s mouth, then turned to look at thelow stone walls the villagers had erected just above the rocky beaches. “I seeyou’ve begun preparations already.”“We are making our own fortifications against the Norukai,” Thaddeus said, “butit is difficult work. Our people are exhausted from rebuilding the homes thatwere burned during the last raid.” He squinted at the three ships anchored justoutside of the bay. Verna followed his gaze, but the low sun was in her eyes andshe could see only silhouettes. Thaddeus let out a relieved sigh. “When I sawyour ships approach, I thought it might be Norukai again. We’re not accustomedto large vessels that aren’t a threat.”“Oh, we are a threat,” General Zimmer said, scratching the dark stubble on hischin. “But we’re a threat to your enemies.” He looked skeptically at thewatchtowers and the stone walls. “It looks to me that we could offer some adviceand expert manpower. My men belong to the D’Haran army, specially sworn todefend Lord Rahl against all enemies, and also to protect his people.”Verna added, “Even this far south, Lord Rahl considers you his people.”As the first cutter tied up at the dock and a group of relieved soldiers climbedonto dry land, Zimmer spoke to the pilot of the small boat, who was about toturn about and head back for the next load of passengers. “Have Captain Norcrosscome in the next wave. I have a local assignment for him.”The pilot and two rowers turned about, plying their oars to return to theanchored ships without resting. Zimmer crossed his arms over his armored chestas Thaddeus led them into the town. “We are leading an expedition upriver andoverland, eventually to Cliffwall.” He seemed concerned with the unimpressivestone barricade walls and the half-completed guard towers. “But it is also partof my mission to defend against enemies, and those Norukai sound like preciselythe sort of enemies Lord Rahl warned us about.”The town leader breathed swiftly, as if he couldn’t get enough air to expresshis gratitude. “If you left some of your soldiers here to help us build betterdefenses against the slavers, we would be eternally in your debt.”“Not our debt,” Verna said, “but Lord Rahl’s.”“And the way you can repay it,” Zimmer added, “is by helping to insure the causeof freedom throughout the world.”“That is a debt we will gladly pay,” Thaddeus said. “We will do everything wecan to help you.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 52 [contents.xhtml#c_ch52]After she had cleaned the blood from herself, Nicci went to the fleshmancer’sstudio to watch over Nathan. Andre invited her inside, delighted with what hehad done. He was charged with nervous energy as he paced back and forth aroundthe table where he had performed the sorcerous operation.Lean and handsome, Nathan lay stretched out on the flat surface, his face slack,his skin pale, his long arms at his sides. His eyes were closed, his white hairspread out around his head. Clumps of dried blood smeared the skin and hairbelow his ears and neck. Nicci couldn’t tell if the blood belonged to him, tothe slaughtered combat animals, or to Chief Handler Ivan. His broad chest wascaked with additional dried blood that did not obscure a wormlike line thatwiggled from the base of his throat down to the center of his chest.“That looks like a long-healed scar,” she said, “but you did your work just lastnight. A potent healing spell?”Andre beamed. “Far more than that, Sorceress. As I told you, I am a masterfleshmancer. I shaped his skin, redesigned his insides, and provided him withthe heart of a wizard. A new heart. I’m certain Ivan wouldn’t mind.…”“But will Nathan’s body accept a foreign heart?” She felt certain that the cruelchief handler would not have been Nathan’s first choice.“That is up to his Han,” Andre said. “I created a complete map of the giftthroughout his body, and I could sense the strands myself. I reconnected them,using Ivan’s heart. In theory, his gift will be restored when he awakens. Theheart will beat again, and Nathan will be a true wizard once more.”Grinning, he reached down to touch the broad, naked chest, stroking the scarline carefully, casually. “It is some of my greatest work, maybe even betterthan the combat bears or that two-headed fighter.” He rubbed his hands together.“Now that was quite an accomplishment!” As Nicci regarded him with a cool stare,Andre’s eyes took on a wistful, distant look. “But not better than my Ixaxwarriors. Oh, no! Now those three are special—a shame they have never beenused.”Nicci didn’t know what the eccentric fleshmancer was talking about. “When willwe know if it worked?”“The dear man did endure quite a traumatic experience.” Andre smirked. “Notquite as traumatic as Ivan’s, naturally, but he is in a deep recuperativeslumber. The Han must coil and uncoil, regrow within him, connect its strands,and find itself once more. Nathan must also discover his new heart.”Nicci didn’t take her gaze from the old wizard’s form. She considered remaininghere to guard him, to make certain that Andre did not perform twistedexperiments, just because he could. She realized that Bannon would likely bewilling to sit a vigil here, too, sword propped in front of him, but she had notseen the young man. Feeling an increasing uneasiness, wondering what he wasdoing to occupy himself, she hardened her determination to find Amos and demandto know where their young companion was.“What did you do with the body of Chief Handler Ivan?” she asked.The fleshmancer lifted his chin. Parts of his thick braided beard had comeundone, but he didn’t seem to care. “After I removed his heart, I had no use forthe husk. Normally, a fallen duma member would receive a fine funeral of state,but I decided on something more befitting on behalf of my friend.” His lipsquirked in a smile. “I had his body chopped up and fed to the remaining combatanimals in their cages. Much more appropriate, hmmm?”Nicci grunted, though she did not argue. “It does seem fitting.”Nathan’s chest rose and fell with only the faintest sign of breathing. Niccilooked down, concerned for the man, for the wizard … for her friend. She askedagain, “How long will he sleep?”“Until he is healed.” Andre spoke as if the answer were obvious.“And how long will that take?”The fleshmancer shrugged. “Until he is healed.”Nicci felt impatient. Nathan—the wizard Nathan—would be a great ally when herecovered, but right now, Nicci had plans to set in motion. Even with the citytrapped beneath the shroud of eternity, she knew there must be some way to bringfreedom to Ildakar.Mirrormask had caused mayhem by unleashing some of the combat animals. While hisfollowers had run among the beasts, the rebel leader himself had not beenpresent, although Nicci suspected he might have been watching from a safedistance. How could he have resisted?But Nicci didn’t know what exactly that turmoil was meant to accomplish. It wasjust an annoyance—a spectacular annoyance that had left its mark and resulted inthe death of one of the duma members and all of those animals, but just anannoyance nevertheless. The reckless act had not been part of an overall plan.Richard Rahl would have developed a complete strategy for overthrowing atyrannical rule. If Mirrormask had such a plan, Nicci needed to know what itwas.A sudden flare of instinctive defensiveness rippled through her. It seemed tocome from outside of herself, and Nicci couldn’t identify it. She looked around,seeing the bubbling specimen tanks on the walls of the chamber in the studio,smelling the chemical powders and the sour old blood.No … the feeling was something else.Someone shouted in the spacious entry portico, “Wizard Andre! Another of thewild beasts has been caught nearby.” A uniformed city guard hurried into thestudio’s main wing, squinting in the midnight-blue dimness. “High Captain Stuartbegged me to come for your assistance.”“Another animal? Did we not kill them all last night?” Andre asked in a huff.Nicci felt a twinge again in her mind, defiance mixed with an instinctive fear.She shook her head to get the buzzing out of her thoughts, felt her skincrawl—and she knew where it came from.Mrra.“It is a sand panther, all alone, marked with the chief handler’s runes,” theguard said. “I don’t know about the other members of its troka, but we have tocapture it alive. Sovrena Thora says we need the animals for the combat pits.”“Then I shall create more, when I have time,” Andre said.Nicci watched his attention shift from his patient to another amusing obsession,but she knew she had to take charge, to go to Mrra. “I will take care of this,”she said to the fleshmancer. “You need to stay here with Nathan. Make certain heheals as quickly as possible.”Andre gave her a dismissive wave, bending down and placing his ear very close toNathan’s nostrils. “I have no interest in chasing cats, no matter how large theyare. I didn’t create them, you know. They’re wild sand panthers captured andforced to breed, and then we raise the cubs.” He shook his head. “Ivan used toenjoy that part, as I recall. Now his apprentices will have to do the work.”“Three other gifted handlers are already with us in the warehouse,” the guardsaid, still breathing hard. “They are using their magic to try to control thepanther. But they may need help.…”Nicci was already pushing past him, out the front entryway. “Show me!” Her toneof command made the man snap to attention and hurry after her.In her dreams, Nicci had seen through the eyes of her sister panther as Mrraprowled the streets, and the big cat had refused to leave, no matter how muchNicci insisted. Now Mrra was also bottled up inside the city and separate fromtime. For many nights she had hunted in the shadows. Nicci had tasted the bloodof rats and dogs in her mouth from the panther’s kills, but she longed to runacross the open prairies chasing antelope and deer. She was trapped inside thecity she hated, where she had been born and branded and forced to fight in thecombat arena.Against her own interests, Mrra had stayed to be with her sister panther. WithNicci. And now she was imprisoned, surrounded by tormentors. She was looking forNicci.With a surge of smoldering hatred, Nicci viewed through Mrra’s senses andunderstood what had happened. Someone had accidentally discovered the panther’sdaytime lair, and now guards and handlers closed in to capture her. Mrra wasready to fight, to attack, to kill.Nicci raced ahead of the guard, drawn to where her sister panther cried out forher.The building was a large warehouse filled with sacks of grain, burlap bags ofground flour. Wire-mesh hoppers held dried corn cobs. Daylight spilled throughcracks in the walls, and dust motes swirled in the air like gold dust in astream. As she and the guard entered through the large open doors of thewarehouse, Nicci’s eyes adjusted to the gloom.Sovrena Thora stood next to the wizard commander, both of them with armsidentically crossed over their chests, as if they really were a dedicatedcouple. Three gifted apprentice handlers moved warily into the shadows, makingtheir way among the sacks of grain and the half-full corn hopper. They lookedunskilled and uncertain. Nicci had seen the apprentices working with Ivanbefore, but now that the chief handler was dead, their gift would have to besufficient.Wearing his red shoulder pauldron, High Captain Stuart shouted orders, directinghis guards to box in the cornered sand panther. The armored men in frontextended their short swords, while the three behind them held cocked crossbows.“Don’t kill it,” said the sovrena. “We lost enough of our animals last night. Weneed this one for the arena.”Nicci pushed her way forward, not caring who might resist her. She gripped theforearm of the nearest crossbowman. “Leave her alone. This panther does notbelong here. She is mine.”Thora’s eyes flared in surprise at Nicci’s interference. “No, she does not. Thepanther belongs in the cages. If she is to die, she will die fighting one of ourtrained warriors.” The tendons in her porcelain neck stood out. “With all thetension in this city, our people need the release of entertainment. Now that theshroud is up, we must get the city back to normal. It would be better if youchose to help us.” Her voice held clear threat.Nicci whirled. “You must not send her to the combat pits. She doesn’t belonghere with you.”The wizard commander let out a scratchy laugh. “Where else should she be? Shecan’t leave Ildakar, and we cannot allow a wild panther to prowl the streets.”She sensed a rush of predatory anger through her nerves, and she spotted thesleek feline form crouching among the tallest piles of sacks, up in the shadows.With a low growl, Mrra bounded up to one of the wooden rafters overhead. Hertail thrashed as she glowered at those who would trap her.“I will take care of her myself.” Nicci didn’t know what else to offer. “She ismy sister panther.”“Nonsense.” Thora scowled at Nicci. “At least the sand panther belongs here. Youand your companions remain only because we allow it.”“I think she’s a charming and provocative guest,” said Maxim. “And as you said,my dear, where else should she be? With the shroud in place, Nicci cannot leaveIldakar.”“There are other ways to leave,” Thora muttered.Concentrating on the large cat in the rafters above, the apprentice handlersspread out below. The senior apprentice, a lantern-jawed man named Dorbo, said,“We can use the gift to push her back and capture her again.” Two of themcarried long wooden poles with a nooselike loop around the end, and the thirdheld a wicked-looking whip. The senior apprentice carried a club emblazoned withIldakaran runes.“Once we get the beast down to the floor level,” said the second apprenticehandler, “we can incapacitate it.”“That depends on how much pain she’s willing to endure,” said the third. “Thestun spell won’t work with her protective runes.”“The club itself will work well enough,” said Dorbo.Nicci used a firm tone of command. “You will not harm her.”Her comment elicited a glare from Thora. “We will do what is necessary for thegood of Ildakar. I could have them truss you as well, Sorceress.” Maximsnickered.Nicci did not flinch. “They are welcome to try, although with the death of Ivan,I wouldn’t suggest you sacrifice your remaining apprentice handlers. Then you’dhave no one to control the animals.”The wizard commander chuckled at the two of them. The archers nocked quarrels intheir crossbows. High Captain Stuart watched anxiously, but he was calm andreserved, not willing to take precipitous action. He looked toward the raftersabove, where the silhouette of the panther hunched out of reach.“Remember, Sovrena and Wizard Commander, any regular magical attack will justslide off of her,” said Dorbo. “But the branded symbols do allow a handler touse certain types of spells. Let us do our work, and we will have the cat inhand in no time.”Nicci felt as trapped as the big cat. Mrra had chosen a good lair, but it wasonly a matter of time before she was discovered. Nicci knew she could dispensewith the handlers, but the wizard commander and the sovrena were both powerfulwith the gift. Nicci would still fight them, but even if she managed to keepMrra free for now, what then? The big cat couldn’t simply wander the streets ofIldakar. Nicci’s heart ached.The three apprentice handlers worked together, summoning their gift, proddingwith their magic. Mrra snarled, paced back and forth along the wide rafterabove. Her golden eyes glared down, and her white fangs gleamed in the straysunbeams. Her growl was vicious and threatening … and Nicci caught herselfmaking a similar growl from her own throat.The handlers sent their gift into Mrra’s mind, forcing her to move. The sandpanther had been trained and twisted in this manner when she was just a cub, andthe handlers drove her now, jabbed her pain centers. With a roar she leaped fromthe rafter onto the mounded sacks of grain.“That isn’t one of Ivan’s!” cried one of the apprentices. “Not the cats thatescaped last night.”“She’s an old one,” said Dorbo. “Must have been set loose by the rebels a longtime ago.”“She does not want to be here,” Nicci warned. “Don’t attack her. She will killyou … and I will help her do it.”The handlers ignored her, using their combined gift to push and prod and drive.Mrra fought back, snarling. Nicci felt part of the pain echoing through theirspell bond, and fury built within her just as a parallel fury built within Mrra.The panther crouched on top of the mounded sacks until, sufficiently provoked,she leaped for the gathered people on the floor.Nicci shouted, “Be careful!” But she was warning Mrra, not the intended targets.This was exactly what the handlers had wanted her to do. One of Stuart’s guardsdidn’t get out of the way quickly enough, and Mrra’s claws tore open the leatherand chain mail on his back. The man staggered away, bleeding, but the cat didnot bother with him further.The three handlers closed in, Dorbo holding up his curled fingers to focus thegift. Together, they pummeled Mrra with their special magic, knuckling herunder. Two extended their poles with the open loops. Dorbo removed his whip andcracked it through the air like serpentine lightning strikes. The tip struckMrra’s haunch, drawing blood. She whirled, raking claws through the air to grabat the painful strand.“Stop!” Nicci lashed out at the handlers with her gift, shattering one of theirwooden poles into splinters. They stared at her in shock.Thora twirled her right hand in the air, and Nicci felt unseen bonds of windcoalesce, wrapping her body like a cocoon, pulling tight in a suffocating grip.Focused on their own target, the other two handlers slipped forward, jabbing theloops at the panther’s head, and one succeeded in slipping it around the tawnyneck.Nicci fought to get free, struggling to pull her arms loose. Shredding the bondsof solidified air, she dissolved the invisible ropes, then flung the magicaltatters back at the sovrena.Mrra thrashed to get away, but the noose was cinched tight. Both apprenticesgrabbed the pole, using all their physical strength to hold their captive.“Leave her alone!” Now that she was loose, Nicci called crackling fireballs ineach hand, ready to hurl them at the handlers.Summoning a powerful counterattack with her magic, Thora sent a wall of air thatknocked Nicci backward, slamming her into the rattling bin that held dry corn.“This is none of your concern, Sorceress.”“Yes it is,” Nicci said. “This is Mrra. She is bonded to me.” She tried tosummon more fire, but Maxim and Thora turned on her together, crushing down witha weight of air to hold her deadly fire in place.“Do not interfere,” Thora warned. “Or Maxim will turn you to stone.”Nicci drew a breath for a defiant shout, but then felt an impossible blow to herhead and a blur of scrambled thoughts. One of the handlers had stepped away fromthe thrashing panther and struck her with his specially endowed cudgel. WhileMrra’s runes might have protected her from a magical attack, Nicci had noprotection against the stun spell.While the debilitating magic rang through her skull, making her knees buckle,the handlers closed in and got a second loop over the cat’s head. Two guardsthrew a net over Mrra, and as she thrashed, guards swarmed in with ropes. Oneblow from Dorbo’s club—even without the boost of the spell—sent the sand pantherwrithing.“We have her now!” said one of the apprentices. “We did it!”Nicci forced her hammering thoughts to crystallize, and she threw off theefforts of the sovrena and the wizard commander. She felt the gift coilingthrough her like black lightning, and she drew herself up and faced Thora, hereyes flashing. “Mrra is part of me,” she growled, ready to release a storm ofAdditive and Subtractive Magic.The sovrena stared directly back, her sea-green eyes as cold as a howlingblizzard. “The panther belongs to Ildakar’s arena. See the spell symbols brandedon her side? That beast is our property.”“No. Mrra is free.”The handlers managed to subdue the cat, using their magic to render herhelpless. Mrra lay unconscious, growling and bleeding.High Captain Stuart and his guards looked uneasily at the confrontation betweenNicci and the sovrena, holding their weapons ready. She had no doubt whose sidethey would take if they decided to join the attack, too.She knew she could kill all of them. Or most of them. If she had to.Thora spoke sourly, as if lecturing a child. “Your belief in freedom ismisplaced. Animals aren’t free. Slaves aren’t free. Lesser humans aren’t free.They are all property. Now that you are our guest under the shroud in Ildakar,you must understand how this city works. Ask the fleshmancer—those animals existbecause of us. We created them.”Nicci did not back down. She inhaled sharp dusty air. “Or did they create peoplelike you?”Thora prepared to lash out with her magic, and Nicci could feel the sizzle inthe air around her. Maxim stood next to Thora, holding his gift at bay, butthreatening nevertheless. The handlers also came to their feet next to theunconscious panther. Nicci felt the brewing magic all around her.She even saw the archers pointing their crossbows toward her, ready to moveshould the sovrena or the wizard commander give a signal.Though her defiance continued to rumble within her, Nicci was outmatched. Backat the fleshmancer’s villa, Nathan lay unconscious, recovering, and he might notever be able to use his magic again. Even Bannon wasn’t there, wandering thecity with his newfound companions. Nicci suddenly realized how alone she was inIldakar. She could not fight them all. Not yet.As her head continued to throb from the stun club, she vowed she would pick hertime.“Clearly I still have much to learn about this city.” Nicci meant her words tobe as cutting as the handler’s whip that had struck Mrra.“Indeed you do,” Thora said. “Take care to learn before you regret it.”The handler apprentices and the guards took the bound panther with them, haulingMrra out of the granary and off to the animal pens."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 53 [contents.xhtml#c_ch53]Nicci’s anger built like a distant, ominous storm. She had no way to contactMirrormask and no other allies in Ildakar—and she needed to begin her fight.Now.She returned to the grand villa by midmorning and went to Bannon’s guestquarters. Even though she knew the young man could do little to help her againstthe powerful wizards, she still wanted to see him. But his bed was made and hisclumsy-looking sword was gone. She saw no sign of Amos, Jed, or Brock either.Her concern grew.When she’d first met him in Tanimura, the victim of petty thieves, Nicci hadfound the young man’s optimism and constant chatter bothersome. Since then, hehad become a reliable companion. The young man was a good fighter, didn’tcomplain overmuch, and was certainly devoted to Nathan and Nicci. Most importantto her, he accepted Lord Rahl’s cause. She wanted him with her now, but sherealized she had not seen him for days.With Mrra captured and Nathan comatose, Nicci again felt the chill of beingalone.Nicci thought of her years serving Emperor Jagang. Even with the full might ofthe Imperial Order and his army behind her, Nicci had been alone. She had foughtby herself, using her powers in service of Jagang. She had thought she couldsurvive without friends, had never wanted any. She considered friends apotential weakness—and Nicci was not weak.While among the fiercely dedicated Sisters of the Dark, she had been closelyallied with her Sisters and teachers Tovi, Cecilia, Armina, and Ulicia, but theyhad never been friends. Nicci had always solved her own problems, and nowIldakar was the problem. She had been called Death’s Mistress and Slave Queen.She claimed to have a heart of black ice. Nicci would find a way to take care ofthis, even without Bannon, Nathan, or Mrra.“I beg your forgiveness for the interruption, Sorceress.” It was a young,pasty-faced guard with a pointed reddish beard and pale brown eyes partiallyshadowed beneath his helmet. He found her as she stood in the open hallwayoutside Bannon’s room. “The wizard commander requests a private meeting withyou. And he sends his apologies.” The young guard fidgeted. “I don’t know whathe means by that, I’m afraid.”Nicci frowned. Maxim had allowed Mrra to be captured, and she would not forgivehim for that. “I am not ready to accept his apology.” She looked at thedisturbing statue of the bent-backed old woman who had been petrified whilegoing about her daily toil. “What does he want?”The young guard seemed embarrassed. “He swore me to confidence. He wants you tomeet him alone for a private conversation—an important one, he says—on top ofthe ruling tower.” The guard swallowed visibly, his larynx bobbing up and down.“He is alone in the gardens there.”Nicci summoned her power and stepped closer to the young man. Her gaze boredinto him. She did not use her magic, but she knew he would be able to sense thethreat she posed. “Tell me honestly—is it a trap?”The guard stammered, “N-No, Sorceress. He genuinely wishes to speak with you,and he asked me to make sure that Sovrena Thora did not know.”“You mean his wife?” she asked, suspicious again. She decided she wouldincinerate him if he made lascivious comments to her.“Yes … I suppose so. I don’t know what this is about. It isn’t…” He shook hishead. “Please, Sorceress, I’m just following orders.”“There, you’ve completed your mission. Leave me. I will go there of my ownvolition.” The guard hurried away, relieved.Not sure what the wizard commander intended, Nicci tossed her loose hair, madesure that her black travel dress was immaculate, and set off. Head high, shestrode across the upper streets to the ruling tower that rose like a sentineloverlooking the streets and rooftops far below.She ascended the main central staircase to the empty ruling chamber, thenclimbed a winding stair even higher, taking the polished stone steps in acorkscrew up to the summit and the open sky.Nicci emerged to the scent of fresh citrus blossoms and the hum of bees. She sawscalloped birdbaths spaced among manicured jasmine hedges. Songbirds chirped andflitted about. On poles around the perimeter of the tower hung a fine mesh ofnearly invisible silken threads to catch the myriad larks. The nets wereretracted now, since Thora needed no more docile larks for her golden cages, andthey hung in baggy folds from each pole.Maxim paced about in his black pantaloons and open shirt. Seeing Nicci, heturned to face her, a grin lighting up his face like a sunrise.But after that morning’s capture of Mrra, she had no patience for small talk,especially not with him. “What do you wish to say to me, Wizard Commander?”He pouted. “Oh? I had hoped such a beautiful woman would indulge me with a fewpleasantries.”“It’s been a grim day. My sand panther was beaten and captured, taken to thearena cages—as you well know. The wizard Nathan lies unconscious, recoveringfrom the fleshmancer’s experiment. And my friend Bannon is missing. Have youseen him? How can I make inquiries of the city guard?” Her words were hard,demanding.Maxim made a noncommittal sound. “My, it has been a difficult day for you! I’msure Bannon is off partaking in whores or gambling with Amos and his friends.The boy has no gift and no responsibilities. You cannot blame him.”“How I assign blame is my business,” Nicci said. “But Bannon is not the one Ifault the most. I see great rot in Ildakar. You wizards have ruled for so longthat you are oblivious to the pain that resonates through the city. As leaders,the ruling council leaves much to be desired.”Maxim touched the center of his chest. “Oh, that pains me in my heart! I’m sosorry you are disappointed in us.” He clucked his tongue. “But I cannot entirelydisagree. My dear wife is as blind to the pain of others as she is cold to me inbed, although it has been many years since I’ve risked frostbite to my privateparts. I can find many other softer and warmer places to indulge my pleasures.”He snickered.He quirked his lips in a smile. “Admittedly the duma is understaffed at themoment, with Renn off traveling and Ivan being digested by arena animals, andeven Lani petrified … but my lovely Thora always sets the tone and forces othersto bow to her wishes, even when the duma is at its full strength. She is quitedominant. No one stands up to her, not even I.” He spread his hands. “What wouldbe the use?”“If you stood up to her, you would change the future of Ildakar,” Nicci said.“If someone stood up to her. Yes, that sounds quite ambitious, but I don’t havesuch ambitions anymore. That isn’t to say someone else couldn’t stand up to her.In fact, a mere century ago, the sorceress Lani challenged the sovrena’s rule.Oh, Lani was a firebrand with a strong gift and a propensity for summoning rainand causing floods. Thanks to her, we were able to build and maintain ouraqueduct system, the water-delivery tunnels that run throughout our bedrock.” Heclucked his tongue again. “Lani was angry and she challenged the sovrena … but,alas, Thora defeated her.” He scratched the side of his head. “The entire dumawas secretly disappointed, but no one could admit it.”Maxim narrowed his eyes. “But I noticed what a great toll the battle took onher. My dear wife was very weak, and if I’d had the initiative myself, I couldhave attacked and defeated her right then. But I lost my nerve.” He shook hishead. “At that time I still thought I loved her.”Nicci remembered the statue of the sorceress in the ruling chamber. “But Laniwas defeated and turned to stone.”“Yes, exactly.”“And why are you giving me this information?”“To make a point, and to raise an example.” He bent over to smell the jasmineblossoms in the hedge, waving away the honeybees. He straightened, exhaling longand slow. “By the rules of Ildakar, and by all of our traditions, you canchallenge Thora as sovrena. You could try to overthrow her. I thought you mightbe interested.”“I have no wish to rule this city,” Nicci said. “I don’t want to stay here a daylonger than I must.”“I understand completely,” Maxim said dismissively. “But if you did overthrowThora, you could set the tone of the wizards’ duma. You’d establish the agendafor any changes you want to implement, and no one would question you. I suspectseveral wizards would secretly agree with you … including me.”Wheels spun in Nicci’s mind as she considered the possibilities. “If I defeatedThora, could I free Mrra?”“You could do whatever you like.”“And I could command that the shroud be taken down?”“I wouldn’t complain about that a bit.” He waved a lumbering bee away from hisface. “I rather enjoy the outside trade. Thora is the true isolationist.”An avalanche of ideas tumbled through Nicci’s thoughts. And the Sorceress mustsave the world. This would be a way for her to achieve what Richard had askedher to do, what Red had predicted in the life book. She could free the people,make the city of Ildakar as great as legend claimed it was. “But when Lanichallenged the sovrena, she failed.”Maxim kept smiling. “Then you must not fail. Simple as that.”Frowning, Nicci walked slowly around the potted citrus trees, came to the edge,and looked out over the stair-stepped layers of tiled rooftops, the flappingbanners, the intricate labyrinth of streets, squares, and gardens. All thosepeople, all those businesses, all those smothered hopes and dreams.She looked up to see that several songbirds had flown into one of the danglingnets, where they were caught, fluttering and struggling, their wings trapped inthe silken mesh. She realized that this might be her best chance … or a trap.“You are her husband. Why are you telling me this?”The wizard commander stroked his upper lip with a forefinger. “No doubt you wantme to tell you that I’m determined to fight for the good of my people. Of coursethat’s a factor.…” He shrugged again, and Nicci felt annoyed with him. “But inreality, I’ve been bored with this stagnant city. Do I want to be trapped herefor more interminable centuries? As far as I’m concerned, I would rather theshroud were down and full contact was reestablished with the outside. It’s muchmore interesting out there. Maybe I might like to see this mysterious Cliffwallarchive that sounds so intriguing, or even attend a state dinner with yourdistant Lord Rahl. Those twelve slaves could certainly have been put to betteruse than to have their throats slit on top of the pyramid.”The idea began to take root in Nicci’s heart, and it sounded better and betterwith each passing moment.Maxim finally recaptured her attention. “And there’s one more reason. I alsohate my wife and want to see her destroyed.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 54 [contents.xhtml#c_ch54]“Today you won’t be fighting me, boy,” Lila said as she led Bannon out of hiscell. His morazeth trainer had a bandaged left forearm and stained clothswrapped around her side where the spiny wolves had mauled her. Lila had killedthe animals and survived. Now she didn’t seem to notice her wounds at all. “Anddon’t think it’s because I am weak or in pain. Adessa has another challenger foryou.”She handed Bannon his sword, and he felt his heart lift as he wrapped hisfingers around the familiar hilt. The morazeth woman stood before him unarmed,wrapped like a bird with a broken wing. If he wanted to, he could simply swingthe sword and kill her. He could strike her head off. He could run her through.She certainly deserved it.Lila’s hard gaze bored into him. “Don’t even consider trying to harm me, boy.”Her voice was quiet, not threatening, but filled with a wealth of danger.He realized that even if he did kill her, then what? He could fight like amadman and try to break free, but he would never defeat all the morazeth ortheir indoctrinated fighters. He would not battle his way out of the tunnels,single-handed. Even then, once out in the city streets where would he go? Couldhe find Nicci or Nathan?No, the chance was much too small.“I would never think of it,” he said to her.She sniffed. “Of course you wouldn’t. You’re weak, but I’m working on that. Iwill make you into a worthy fighter yet.”Bannon felt Sturdy’s weight in his hand, and he grew more confident, knowing howwell it had served him in many battles. Neither Lila nor any other fighter inthe pits could be more fearsome than the selka, the dust people, or the viciousforest women who had once been his own lovers.Lila walked ahead, leading him away from his cell. He watched the muscles rippleunder the exposed skin of her back, how the leather wrap around her hips rolledas she walked.Instead of taking him to the practice pits where she had first fought him, Lilaled Bannon to a communal area where the trusted fighters and morazeth trainerssparred in the open. Torches shed yellow light accompanied by thin curls ofgreasy black smoke. The sandstone walls of the chambers echoed withconversations, but not the clash of metal on metal. Bannon saw several morazethstanding against the rough walls near muscular male fighters. Normally, thetrainees would be practicing with various weapons, but now the smooth sandstonefloor had been cleared … empty and waiting.Bannon tightened his grip on the sword. Everyone seemed to be waiting for him.He felt sweat prickle his skin and wished he had his normal clothes back, hishomespun shirt, his canvas trousers. He felt exposed with only the rough clothwrapped around his hips.Adessa stood there like a spring-wound crossbow, even though she held no weaponexcept for the agile knife attached to her hip. “You are ready to fight.”Lila answered for him. “Yes, he is.”Bannon didn’t have any say in the matter.“Good, because if he is not ready, then he will die.” Adessa turned her head andcalled out, “Champion!”Bannon’s heart stuttered in his chest as a hard young man emerged from a sidetunnel. Though he was only Bannon’s age, Ian carried the weight of years ofmisery.“Sweet Sea Mother,” Bannon whispered, and his hand clenched around his sword asif strangling the hilt.Ian stepped forward, blank-faced, his gray eyes cold as frozen steel. His barechest and arms were a webwork of scars, straight slashes from blades, swoops andcurls from ragged wounds, perhaps claw marks. His brown hair was cropped close.His lips were a firm line, neither a smile nor a snarl. Instead of a metalblade, he carried a wooden knout, a rectangular club as long as his arm. Thefour sides were smooth, with sharp edges, though bands of hard leather werewrapped around several places. He gripped the club, swinging it easily.Bannon’s throat went dry. He was reminded of the wooden axe handle his fatherhad used to beat beaten his mother to death.“I don’t want to fight you, Ian,” he said in a low voice.Adessa laughed. “It does not matter what you want, boy.”Lila pushed him, and Bannon stumbled closer to Ian, who stood like a tree carvedinto the shape of a man. “Fighters fight,” Ian said.“But friends don’t,” Bannon said. He held his arms out, raising Sturdy with itspoint turned away. “I’m your friend, Ian. We were friends. Do you rememberChiriya Island?”“No one wants to hear you talk,” Adessa said. “Demonstrate your skills, or yourfailings.”“But…” Bannon looked at the morazeth leader. “I have a sword. I could kill him.He just has a club.”“If you can kill my champion, then he is worthless to me, and I will just takeanother lover,” she said. “Do not be fooled. The knout can be just as deadly asa sword. Ian can batter you to death with a sharp edge, or just bruise you withthe leather-wrapped parts. The choice is his—and yours, boy. Can you defendyourself?”Bannon glanced at Adessa, then at Lila, seeking some escape while trying to findwords. In that moment, Ian moved like an arrow launched from a bow. Making nosound or threat, he lunged, swept back his arm, and swung the knout with all thestrength he possessed.Bannon saw him just in time, twisted out of the way, and brought Sturdy up sothat the sword blade deflected some of the force. The club’s sharp edge grazedhis shoulder, and Bannon realized it would have been a killing blow if he hadn’tdodged in time.He staggered backward, whirling to face his opponent. He heard the morazethmuttering, critiquing, some cheering, others jeering. Lila’s sharp voice cutthrough them all. “Fight, boy! Disappoint me at your peril!”Bannon braced himself, and Ian paced back and forth, studying him. He shiftedthe knout from one shoulder to the other. His gray eyes darted.“Ian, I’m sorry!” Bannon said.The words seemed to trigger the other young man. Ian strode toward him, sweepingthe knout down toward his head. Bannon swung Sturdy up to meet the heavy woodenclub, and the blow rang through his wrists and arms all the way up to hisshoulder. He yelled in pain, stumbled back, and Ian kept coming.Bannon parried with his sword, using every skill that Nathan had taught himduring their training sessions. “I don’t want to hurt you, Ian.”The young man’s lips curled back. “Fighters fight.” He drew a quick breath.“Cowards die.”“I’m sorry, Ian,” Bannon cried again. “I mean it. I shouldn’t have run. Ishouldn’t have let the Norukai have you.” Anger flared across Ian’s face, and heswung the knout again, battering Bannon. Sturdy’s sharp edge shaved offsplinters of the wood, gouged notches into the club, but the blows themselvesnearly broke Bannon’s wrists.“You talk too much,” Adessa called.Her words only hardened the determination. “I talk because I have something tosay to him,” Bannon snapped. He softened his voice even as the wooden clubsmashed against the sword. “Do you remember when we collected shells on thebeach or picked crabs from the tide pools?” He watched for any flicker of memoryon Ian’s scarred face. “Remember when we found caterpillars on the cabbages andraised them until they hatched into white butterflies?”Ian swung, his face blank, and Bannon raised the sword to block the club.“Remember it, Ian! I know you remember it.”“I remember the Norukai,” he said, and struck again harder. The knout slid downthe sword and struck him on the right bicep, leaving what would surely be apurple bruise within days—if Bannon survived.“Do you remember the stray dog we fed? How we collected scraps and gave them tohim every night, until my father caught me?” Dark wings of memory flutteredaround his vision. “I paid dearly for that.”His father had beaten him so badly he could barely get out of bed for days. Hisbody was so mottled with bruises he had been ashamed to show himself, and hisfather had told the other people in the town that Bannon suffered from a badfever. Ian had come to check on him, worried about his friend.The champion faltered. “I fed him for that week when you were in bed. Then heran away.”“I’m sorry,” Bannon said again. “When I learned you were here in Ildakar, I cameto save you. I tried to get you free.”“He is free—free to be a fighter!” Adessa said.“I am free to die in the arena.” Ian’s expression became wooden again, and heflashed forward, swinging the club.Bannon braced himself, blocked the blows.Lila removed her agile knife, holding the black handle in the hand of herunbandaged arm. “If you don’t draw blood, boy, I will make you feel more painthan you have ever before enjoyed.”“I don’t enjoy pain,” Bannon said.“Then fight!” Lila cried.He drove himself forward, hoping to somehow render Ian senseless so this combatwould end. He swung his sword, imagining not his warm boyhood friend, not thecompanion who had roamed across the island with him.Ian swung the knout sideways like a mallet, trying to crush Bannon’s ribs, buthe spun out of the way, his muscles oiled with the heat of the battle. Blow metblow. The knout was splintered, and Sturdy’s edge was dulled. Bannon thought ofhow he had chopped the testing block to pieces in the swordsmith’s backyard inTanimura.“I’m sorry, Ian,” he said again. He saw an opening, his friend’s head exposed,and he turned the sword, using the flat of the blade. He knew this was how ithad to be. He could stun Ian, end this combat. He saw the sword descend withplodding slowness, moving through the air like thick honey toward the curve ofIan’s skull.At the last instant, his friend somehow moved with the speed and grace of acoiled whip. The knout slithered up, deflected the blade, and twisted Bannon’swrist. He gasped in pain, spun, and tried to dodge, unable to believe that hehad missed his target.Then the knout came up and around faster than Bannon could react, faster thanhis eyes could even process the blur. He had no breath with which to cry out.From the corner of his eye he watched the deadly club hurtle toward the side ofhis head. Only at the last instant did the square club rotate slightly so thatthe splintered edge turned and the leather-wrapped section smashed the side ofBannon’s skull, just above his ear.The explosion of blackness engulfed him and sucked him down into a bottomlesspit of pain."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 55 [contents.xhtml#c_ch55]Full darkness fell over the city. When the duma members declared a rarenighttime session to discuss the damage done by the rebels, Nicci decided not towait any longer. She chose her moment—this would be the time.She was on her own here in Ildakar, and she knew it, but she was never helpless.Nicci had slain wizards before. She had proven herself again and again. Thoughshe was wary about how Lani had failed in her challenge a century ago, Nicciknew she was more powerful than Thora, and she would demonstrate it.“I am an enemy unlike any you have ever seen before,” she muttered to herself asshe climbed the stairs of the ruling tower. When she reached the throne chamber,the sovrena and the wizard commander sat on their tall chairs while theremaining duma members—Andre, Elsa, Quentin, and Damon—had taken their places.Nicci kept thinking of Mrra now imprisoned in a cage with the other combatanimals. Nathan remained stretched out in the fleshmancer’s studio, breathing,but lost in his coma. They were trapped beneath the shroud that contained allthe people of Ildakar, the shroud created when Thora had butchered those twelvepoor slaves on the stair-stepped pyramid.As Nicci walked into the open chamber with the tall windows that looked out tothe glittering city buildings far below, she felt the fire within her.And the Sorceress must save the world.Perhaps the world didn’t need saving—Richard had already done that, far to thenorth. But the city of Ildakar certainly needed something. It needed her. Shewas Death’s Mistress. She would be sufficient.Stepping forward into full view, Nicci concentrated on her gift, feeling all thepowers and abilities she had gathered over the years, spells she had learned,tactics and techniques. The air crackled like an aura around her. The fabric ofher dark skirts flowed and stirred. Her loose blond hair drifted faintly as ifcharged with a building storm.The morazeth Adessa stood beside the raised dais, watchful, as if she guardedthe sovrena like a pet hound. The hardened warrior woman looked at Nicci, didnot seem impressed.Wizard Commander Maxim perked up on his throne as Nicci arrived, and a satisfiedsmile crossed his face. Sovrena Thora scowled at the interruption, and hersea-green eyes drank in Nicci’s demeanor. “Sorceress, you are presumptuous tointrude on our meeting. You already interfered enough today.”“Perhaps she should join us,” said Damon, stroking his long drooping mustaches.This evening he had tied tiny garnet baubles into the long pointed ends. “Theruling council is short two members, and she is strong enough. Maybe she offersa valid outside perspective.”“Actually, we’re short three members from what the duma should be,” Elsa said,glancing over at the statue of Lani frozen in place, “and therefore from whatthe ruling council should be.”Nicci announced, “Tonight the council will be short yet another member, after Iremove Sovrena Thora from her position.”Gasps rippled among the wizards seated on their stone benches. Fleshmancer Andreran his fingers down his thick braided beard. “Ah, so it is a challenge, hmmm?”“It is a challenge, by the rules of Ildakar,” Nicci said. “I find the sovrenaunfit to rule. She is a despot and casts a shadow over this city. The dumamembers are also partially responsible for this harsh culture that hurts so manyof its people.” She looked at the other wizards, accusing. “But the ship goeswhere the captain guides it. Therefore, I must take the helm and change thecourse of Ildakar.” She stepped forward, and the crackle around her intensified.“With Thora gone, maybe the rest of you will remember your humanity.”Maxim chuckled. “Keeper’s beard, how grandiose! This is more entertaining than Ihad hoped.”At the side of the dais, Adessa stiffened, ready to attack Nicci, but she didnot move, waiting for instructions. Nicci focused on her main opponent.Thora glared at her husband and rose slowly from her seat. Nicci could sense theroiling power of the sovrena’s gift building around her like a cocoon ofinvisible but deadly magic. Her complex tapestry of woven braids twitched andwrithed like a nest of snakes around her head. “You are not even one of us,Nicci. How dare you challenge me!”“I dare much,” Nicci said, then lowered her voice. “You made a grave mistake bycapturing my sand panther … but that was only your most recent mistake.”Aloof, Thora glided down the two steps to stand on the open blue marble floor.Maxim leaned forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his black pantaloonsand placing his flat palms together. Nicci wondered whether he really wanted herto win—whether, as he’d said, his hatred for Thora ran so deep that he wished tosee his wife destroyed—or whether perhaps he just wanted fresh entertainment inwhat he considered to be an endless boring life. Maxim said, “By our laws, sheis allowed to challenge you. You cannot be afraid, Thora?”The sovrena’s face twisted in a grimace. She glared at her husband, then swungher gaze to encompass the entire ruling chamber. “This foreign sorceress knowsnothing about our laws, our traditions. This challenge has nothing to do with apet animal. She is a spy sowing sedition. She came here pretending to requesthelp for a powerless wizard, but she meant to destroy our way of life from thebeginning.”Nicci stood cold and defiant. “Not true. I would have liked nothing better thanto find that this city was worthy of its own legends. But I swiftly realizedthat this is no perfect society at all.”“You are in league with Mirrormask and his rebels,” Thora accused. “And I canprove it.”The duma members muttered. Thora strode past her to a stone side table, whereshe picked up a porcelain water pitcher. Stepping to the center of the bluemarble floor, the sovrena poured the water in a steady stream onto the polishedstone. The water spread out in a broad, shallow pool. Thora cast the porcelainpitcher aside, where it shattered on the tiles. She held her hands over thepuddle, summoning her gift.The reflective surface of the water stirred, swirled, and became like a windowinto preserved images.“We have been watching these strangers, along with many suspicious people,”Thora said. “This is a trick I learned from Lani before I defeated her. All ofthe washbasins throughout the city, the reflecting basins mounted on the walls,the still fountains—they are scrying pools.” And now she smiled.In his tall chair on the dais, the wizard commander perked up, surprised. Theother wizards muttered. Even Adessa took a step forward from the dais, watchingclosely.“Any such pool is more than a mirror—it is a lens, through which I can observe,whenever I wish. What is reflected on the surface of the water can be reflectedelsewhere, and I have watched Nicci and her impotent wizard companion. Behold!”She swept her hand in a circular motion, and Nicci saw herself reflected in theimage standing next to Nathan. The sound emanated from the pool of water. Theyspoke in low voices in his room, late one night. Nicci remembered theconversation, which took place after she had made contact with Mirrormask andhis rebels. Thora had selected the words carefully, pulling out damningsnippets.We must find a way to overthrow this city’s leadership.The duma members grumbled, but Thora smiled. She flicked her fingers, summoningmore words Nicci had spoken in private to Nathan.When we are doing the right thing, we are always in a position of strength. Theruling council will fall.Nicci stood straight-backed, cold. The images shifted again:As a sorceress, I am confident I could stand against any member of the duma.Maybe I should challenge them, become one of the rulers of Ildakar.She was shocked to hear her own words condemn her, but oddly some of the wizardsin the chamber seemed more appalled to learn that Thora had been spying on allof them. “You can do this from any reflecting basin? Any fountain?” Damonstroked his long mustaches, clearly agitated. “You can use a scrying spell toobserve any part of the city? Any person?”“Wherever I choose,” Thora said. Hearing the mutters of consternation, sheturned on them. “Why? Are you plotting treason yourselves? If not, you havenothing to fear. Did you not just hear what the sorceress said?” She pointed anaccusing finger toward Nicci, then down toward the repeating images reflected inthe spilled water. “She has proclaimed herself guilty. Her own words prove thatshe intends to bring down Ildakar. She came here to sow discord among us. Thisis all part of her scheme. Watch.”Next, Thora displayed images at night, from outside in a shadowed city squarewhen she had first met Mirrormask and his followers next to the fountain—afountain whose water captured the images and words.I also support you, as do my companions. We can be a great help—if you have aplan. But the oppression in Ildakar is powerful.And the masked rebel leader’s damning response: You are indeed one of us,Sorceress Nicci.As Thora continued to show the results of her unexpected, magical spying, Nicciwatched the distaste and resentment grow on the faces of the duma members. Shedefiantly faced Thora, who stood across from her on the other side of thespilled water. “You must eavesdrop on many private nighttime conversations … notjust my own.”She ignored the images wafting up from the scrying pool. “This changes nothingin my challenge to you. I made no secret—I call you out. Without your corruptleadership, there would be no unrest in the city. There would be no need for aMirrormask. You created this situation, and you must be removed.” Nicci steppedup to the very edge of the spilled water.She thought about the lands Richard had freed, the incredible enemies he haddefeated, the tyrants he had overthrown. If he could achieve such impossiblevictories, Nicci could do the same thing in his name.Thora laughed. “Do you wish to lie? Do you deny your sedition before the membersof the duma?”“I deny nothing, because it means nothing. Those words don’t negate mychallenge.” Nicci flashed a quick glance at Maxim, who nodded slightly. “By thelaws of Ildakar, I still demand to face you.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 56 [contents.xhtml#c_ch56]Swelling with indignation, the sovrena stared at her challenger across thepuddle that still reflected images of Nicci’s secret conversations. Thora’svoice dripped with scorn. “An outsider does not dictate to me. We granted youcourtesy here in Ildakar because you were a gifted stranger, but now you make meregret my welcome.”Nicci maintained her silence, waiting for her challenge to be acknowledged. Hergift coiled restlessly within her, hungry to be released.Lounging in his ornate chair, Maxim chuckled. “Regret it all you like, my dearwife—that doesn’t change the facts. Every member of the wizards’ duma knows thelaws of the city. The rules have not changed since Lani defied you. Any giftedperson may challenge the rule of Ildakar, to be decided by demonstration ofpowers—which we have by tradition interpreted to mean combat.”The sovrena glared at her husband. “What you say is true, even if this upstartsorceress chooses to corrupt our rules for her own purposes.” She studied theother wizards, trying to determine which of them sided with Nicci, and whichwould support her. Adessa lounged against the cool stone wall, watching thetense tableau with her flashing dark eyes.Nicci kept her hands loose at her sides, her fingers curled.Maxim shifted in his chair, sliding toward the edge of his seat. “What say you,Thora? We don’t have all night.”Thora stared at Nicci with her face drawn. “I, too, know the laws of our city,and I shall invoke my own rule. Anyone may challenge the ruler of Ildakar tocombat.” Her lips twisted like a withered rosebud. “But as the challenged party,I also have the right to choose my champion.” She lifted her head, and thecomplex loops and whorls of her braids danced about. “This outsider is notworthy of my time or effort. Adessa, you are my champion.” She made a dismissivegesture as she backed toward the dais. “Kill Nicci for me.”The other wizards gasped. Andre chuckled. “This will be interesting, hmmm?”Nicci turned to look at the seemingly relaxed warrior woman, her skin coveredwith brand marks. Adessa held up her gauntleted left hand and touched the hiltof her short sword with her right. She came forward with a languid rolling gait,building up her wariness, her combat readiness. Adessa looked as dangerous as adeathrise flower.As the sovrena lowered herself back into her ruling chair, Nicci called, “Youwon’t fight your own battles? Not even to hold on to your personal rule?”Thora sat back, brushing a hand across the blue silk of her gown to smooth thefabric on her thighs. “I find it more satisfying to observe.” She nodded toAdessa. “Don’t disappoint me.”The morazeth came closer to Nicci, raising her short sword to fight. “I willnot, Sovrena. I have corrected many arrogant pups in the training pits. They allhave an exaggerated sense of their worth and their own abilities—until they arebroken. This sorceress is no different.”Nicci turned her full attention to Adessa, locking her eyes with the fighter’sageless stare. Adessa’s scars bore testament to how many vicious fights she hadsurvived, but Nicci knew she would not survive this one.Adessa sprang forward without a flicker of warning, sweeping with her shortsword while letting out a bloodcurdling yell.Nicci’s black dress flowed around her as she held up her curled hand andreleased the gift that was so impatient in her fingertips. Incandescent fireboiled up in her palm, a sphere of wizard’s fire the size of a ripe orange. Shehad no interest in a prolonged combat, did not wish to give Adessa the honor ofa drawn-out fight. She just wanted to finish this and bring down Sovrena Thora.Nicci hurled the blazing ball, which struck Adessa in the center of the chest,spreading across her bare skin and the black leather wrap. It should haveincinerated her. Wizard’s fire was one of the most horrific weapons Niccipossessed, a persistent unquenchable blaze that would burn an opponent and keepburning until it ate through the charred bones. But her fire merely rippledacross the marks on the morazeth’s naked skin and flowed around to dissipate inthe air behind her. Adessa didn’t even pause in her attack.Nicci ducked as the short sword whistled through where her neck had been. Shefelt the steel skim across her loose blond hair, snipping a few strands. Adessalanded on her studded sandals, spun, and attacked again. Nicci lunged out withher magic, releasing a hammerblow of condensed air that should have flattenedher opponent, but again the wind simply flowed across her spell-branded skin,without touching her.She heard Elsa gasp in her seat, while Andre chuckled. From the corner of hereye, she saw Thora on her throne. The sovrena wore an expression of seethinganger, while beside her Maxim grinned, one leg crossed over the other, as if hehad not enjoyed himself so much in a long time.Nicci’s fierce wind skirled and ricocheted around the walls of the high tower,rattling the windows, but Adessa was immune. The morazeth closed in, swingingher gauntleted fist. The blow crashed into the side of Nicci’s face, making herreel away, her cheek gashed by the brass studs.Nicci folded herself backward, bending as far as possible so that the backsweepof Adessa’s short sword barely missed gutting her.“Your magic doesn’t work on a morazeth,” Adessa said. “You should have beenwarned.”Still stinging from the blow to her head, Nicci recovered, braced herself. “ThenI’ll fight you without my magic.” She never took her eyes from her opponent asshe drew her two daggers, one at each hip. “It’s all the same to me.”Thora leaned to the side and spoke to her husband. “I told you this would nottake long.” Her voice hardened into an accusation. “I know you put her up tothis, Maxim. She will pay for it, and I’ll make you pay as well.”“You are too quick to judge, my dear wife. Watch.”Nicci held the two daggers in a loose grip as she kept moving, circling,watching Adessa. The morazeth’s sword was longer than the daggers, but Nicciwould be nimble. Her dress constricted her, the fabric gathered around her legs,the bodice hugged her waist and chest, while Adessa had nothing to confine her.And nothing to protect her.Nicci jabbed with the dagger in her left hand, provoking, feinting, then slashedwith the knife in her right hand. Adessa easily dodged and drove in. Nicci luredher close enough so that when the morazeth jabbed with the short sword, Niccireleased her right-hand dagger, letting it clatter to the floor. With her handfree, she snatched the warrior woman’s wrist in an iron grip to keep the swordaway, then swept her left leg and stomped down on Adessa’s foot. She heard bonescrunch beneath the sandal ties.Adessa snarled, but did not cry out. She swung her gauntleted fist and punchedNicci in the stomach, knocking the wind out of her. Nicci staggered backward,struggling to suck in air, dodging the tip of the blade. Now she had only oneknife.Pursuing her, Adessa splashed into the spilled puddle of water on the floor,somehow ignoring the pain of her broken foot. She limped only slightly. Nicciscrambled out of the pool, backing away, and just as Adessa charged, Niccireleased more magic … but not against the morazeth this time.With her gift, she sucked heat out of the floor tiles, turned the spilled waterinto a sudden mirror-smooth covering of bitter-cold ice. Already runningheadlong, the warrior woman lost her footing and sprawled across the ice. Niccitook advantage and leaped upon the morazeth as Adessa scrambled to her feet.Nicci knocked her back down onto the ice, raised her dagger to deal a deathblow,but Adessa’s gauntleted hand flashed up, catching her arm. Though Nicci gruntedand strained, trying to drive the dagger down, her muscles were no match for themorazeth’s.To concentrate on her strength, Adessa let go of her short sword, but Niccifocused only on pushing the dagger point closer and closer to the hollow of heropponent’s throat. Adessa used only one hand. Nicci didn’t see her fumble withsomething at her waist, pulling out a short black cylinder. She heard a faintsnick, saw the glint of a silvery needle. Adessa jabbed her agile knife intoNicci’s side.Pain exploded like chain lightning surging through her network of nerves, makingher drop her dagger. Her joints turned to jelly. Nicci writhed away, gasping.Apparently, this woman was more like the Mord-Sith than she had guessed.Adessa, back on her feet again, kicked Nicci in the rib cage with her intactfoot, then again in the kidneys. Nicci grunted and rolled, trying to recover.The crippling pain had ended the moment she broke free of the tiny needle, butAdessa kept her down with brutal blows.Nicci tried to get to her hands and knees, to squirm away. Jagang had beaten herfar worse than this, and she had survived.Adessa swung a hammerblow with her gauntleted fist, striking the other side ofNicci’s head directly in the temple. Her vision filled with black spiderwebs.Each breath was like inhaling fire mixed with broken glass. She swayed, refusingto collapse. Blood poured out of her nose and mouth.The blows paused for a moment, and Nicci saw that Adessa had snatched up hershort sword from where it lay on the patch of ice. Nicci staggered back towardthe wall, trying to find a place where she could defend herself.With a flash of her gift, she turned one of the tiles in front of the morazethinto a red-hot square, which shimmered, turned molten, but the other womanlurched over it.Adessa prowled forward with only the slightest smile on her lips, a predatorready to take down its prey. She glanced back at Thora. “How many pieces wouldyou like her in, Sovrena?”Thora descended the dais, swelling larger as she pulled the gift around her,building her magic to a crackling storm that cowed the other wizards in theroom, even Maxim. “You’ve done enough, Adessa. I will finish this.”Nicci gathered her strength to fight back. Shock waves of pain sprang fromnumerous points throughout her body. The obedient morazeth just stood therewatching, looming, threatening. Nicci raised her defiant gaze toward thesovrena. “My battle was never with Adessa.” Nicci summoned her gift, buildingthe magic within her.“You dared to challenge me,” Thora said. “It is time to discard you. Dump youlike a chamber pot, so that no one—”She swept her hand sideways, and a wall of air slammed into Nicci withincredible force, ten times stronger than anything she had felt before, drivingher backward.“ever—”Thora struck an even harder blow. Nicci skidded toward the wall, trying toregain her strength, pulling up a shield.“challenges me—”Thora used both of her hands and Nicci was too weak to ward off the finalbone-crushing blow.“—again!”Nicci deflected only a fraction of the magic before all the solidified airstruck her like a battering ram, pushed her up and back. Her body smashedthrough the windows of the high tower, and Nicci flew out into the gulf of theopen bottomless night."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 57 [contents.xhtml#c_ch57]Even after years of studying in the Cliffwall archives, Oliver had learned morein a few months of journeying across the Old World than he had ever acquiredfrom books. He and Peretta had both absorbed the details of the unchartedlandscape, working their way over the mountains to the sea, then sailing northto breathtaking cities.And now the two were going home at last, their minds filled with more than alifetime of adventures.Captain Norcross and fifty soldiers had remained behind in Renda Bay to help thevillagers build fortifications, manufacture weapons, and prepare to defendthemselves against raiders from the sea. Town leader Thaddeus was breathlesswith gratitude. “The Norukai are sure to come back. They always do. We foughtback and maybe stung them a little, but they won in each case, no matter what wedid.”“The next time,” General Zimmer said before heading out with the rest of theexpeditionary force, “you will deal them a much more painful wound. CaptainNorcross will make sure of that.”Norcross gave his sister Amber a farewell embrace before the line of troopsdeparted inland, following the river road. Oliver and Peretta led the line,sharing a horse, because there were not enough mounts for all the soldiers inthe expeditionary force.Even with the mild voyage down from Serrimundi, ten horses had perishedbelowdecks. Such beasts were not meant to be kept for long in the hold. Oliverhad felt sorry about the poor animals, but knew that the remaining horses wouldface even more horrific conditions if they went to an actual war.…Lost in his thoughts, Oliver shuddered as they rode along the river with thehundred eager soldiers, who were supposedly the best fighters in the D’Haranarmy. Seated in front of him on the saddle, Peretta turned around to look athim. “What’s wrong? I felt you shiver.”“I just had a thought about war.” He realized how close he was holding her, bothof them crowded in the saddle. She was thin and bony, and he felt her spinepress against his chest, but somehow he found it pleasant.Her dark ringlets of hair stirred in the breeze that whispered up the wideriver. “Why would you think of war?”“Because of these soldiers and the horses.”“Then you must not have been listening to what the prelate and the general toldus. The wars are over and the Imperial Order has been defeated. Lord Rahl openedthe whole world to peace and prosperity, and we’re part of it. Nicci said soherself. It’s good news.”“Then why do we need all these soldiers?” he asked. “Why does D’Hara requiresuch a large army in the first place?”“Why, to make certain the peace stays that way.” She huffed and looked forwardagain. “You worry too much.”The horses walked double-file along the wide river road. The expedition madegood time for days, crossed the foothills, and then descended into the nextvalley, where they found the remnants of imperial roads.Each night at camp, the two scholars joined Prelate Verna and the general fordinner in his command tent. Zimmer studied each day’s charts, which were updatedregularly by his staff cartographers. Verna was interested to hear tales ofCliffwall and the magical knowledge stored there. Peretta could recite many ofthe tomes verbatim—and often did so, long past the point where even the prelateseemed interested. Oliver was more careful to choose his stories, and to tellthem well.As they sat around the central wooden table in the general’s tent, eatingportions of a wild turkey one of the scouts had brought down with an arrow,Oliver told more background of Cliffwall. “Before the great wizard wars, whenmagic was outlawed and the gifted were hunted down, when magical libraries wereseized or torched, some wizards realized that the only way to preserve knowledgefor the future was to hide it. For years, as Sulachan’s armies swept across theOld World conquering city after city, the wizards secretly gathered all theimportant writings they could find and constructed a treasure trove of arcanelore. They found an isolated spot in unknown canyons deep in the high desert.There, they built the Cliffwall library and spent years stockpiling books andscrolls, stashing the knowledge where it would be safe from Sulachan’s grasp.“Many wizards were slain, but they kept the secret. Cliffwall grew, its shelvesand vaults filled with thousands of the most important books ever written.” Hetook another bite of the juicy turkey meat, drawing out the pause. “Then theycreated a camouflage shroud to cover the cliff archive, so it looked likenothing more than a canyon wall. That library remained preserved for threethousand years.” Peretta handed him a napkin, and he self-consciously wiped hislips. “But now a new generation of scholars can study the books.”“One of the memmers discovered a way to break down the camouflage shroud aboutfifty years ago,” Peretta said, and a troubled look crossed her face as shepressed her lips together. “Victoria. She caused problems of her own, but shedid open up Cliffwall again. No one had been able to do that for centuries,although many had tried.”“You keep speaking of memmers, but you never explained exactly what they are,”General Zimmer said, discarding a turkey bone and peeling a strip ofgolden-brown skin with his fingers, then slipping it into his mouth.The young woman was happy to explain. “The memmers were gifted scholars who hada mission to preserve all that knowledge in another way. We memorized it. All ofit. We read and preserved scroll after scroll, committing every word to memory,while the camouflage shroud was in place.”“For three thousand years?” Verna asked. “Dear spirits, was there a preservationweb implanted in the cliffs? How did you survive so long?”“Oh, we live a normal life span,” Peretta said. “The memmers pass theirknowledge along from generation to generation. For millennia, we were the onlyones who knew all the prophecies, all the spells, and all the history hiddenaway.”Oliver interrupted, “But now everyone can read the books for themselves.” SeeingPeretta flinch, he mollified her. “Oh, the memmers are still a valuableresource. They can call upon their own knowledge much more quickly than ascholar like me can read shelves of books to find a specific stanza or turn ofphrase. It’s best if the memmers and scholars work together.” He took one of theunclaimed turkey legs and used a table knife to slice off half of the meat,offering it to Peretta, who accepted it as an apparent peace offering.“I will be glad when my Sisters and I can study some of that library,” PrelateVerna said. “It makes me nervous to know that so many dangerous spells are inthe hands of untrained amateurs. We can help.”Oliver distracted himself with a second hard camp biscuit. The prelate wasright. No one would forget the painful debacle of the Lifedrinker, when ascholar accidentally unleashed a terrible magic that destroyed all life formiles around, or the equally ill-considered restoration spell worked byVictoria, who created deadly jungles so rampant they might have swallowed theworld. After he swallowed his dry biscuit, Oliver said, “We will be very glad tohave you there guiding us.”The next day, the large contingent of soldiers rode across the valley and upinto the mountains, encountering occasional villages. When they reached the townof Lockridge, they found a flurry of rebuilding efforts and freshly plantedcrops, even though it was late in the season. Intrepid townspeople had ventureddown the old roads and into the hills to reestablish trade with other villagesaround the mountains.Mayor Raymond Barre welcomed the line of troops, recognizing Oliver and Perettafrom when they had passed through weeks earlier. Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon hadliberated Lockridge and all the other local towns from the accursed Adjudicator,who pronounced people guilty and transformed them into statues. Nicci and Nathanhad killed the Adjudicator and broken the spell, and Lockridge and other townswere all just getting back on their feet. No one had yet been able to determinehow many years, or even centuries, they had remained petrified, but they weregetting on with their lives now.“We have little food to resupply such a large force,” Mayor Barre saidapologetically, “but we have some grain and smoked sausages. We can make a largepot of goat stew to feed you and your men.”“Goat stew! That would be most appreciated,” said General Zimmer. “We are gladfor your hospitality. Our soldiers will use the water from your well, and my topofficers would sleep in your inn.”“We could find at least twenty beds among our available homes,” Barre said. “Therest will have to camp. We’ll find good places for them.”Zimmer smiled. “I’ll have my men draw lots to choose who gets to sleep on astraw tick instead of the hard ground. And we will help with the food where wecan.”He dispatched several of his best hunters into the forest, and they returnedwith two deer, which they added to the feast. The people of Lockridge celebratedthe hope that the D’Haran army brought them, the reassurance of a peace thatwould last for years to come.Peretta sat next to Oliver as they ate, enjoying the goat, bean, and barleystew. The young woman’s gaze was distant as she leaned closer to him. “When wecame through here before, I had no idea how wide the world was or how far we hadtraveled. We had come so far by the time we got here!” She laughed. “And nowthat we’re back in Lockridge, it seems we’re almost home.”“We are almost home.” He patted her forearm, then withdrew shyly. “We’ll makeit, I promise.”The two of them slept on blankets outside in the town square. They didn’t evendraw straws for a chance at a bed. By now, Oliver was accustomed to warm nightsunder the open starry skies, and he didn’t mind bedding down next to Peretta.They set off into the mountains, following the road that crossed ridge afterridge, climbing higher until they reached the summit of a large divide. Gazingdown into the huge, open valley, Oliver caught his breath and stared. Squinting,he could make out patches of green, the flowing silver of a river, irregularlyshaped mirrors of lakes, even geometrical squares of newly planted cropland.It took him a long moment to recognize what he was seeing. “That used to be theScar!”“Does that mean we’re close to Cliffwall?” asked Verna. She sounded weary andeager at the same time.“Closer than we were yesterday,” Peretta said. “Still many days yet.”Oliver couldn’t contain his excitement. “That was all barren desolation not longago, drained dry by the Lifedrinker. Then it became a bastion of impenetrableforest, thanks to Victoria.”Peretta said, “But now the world is returning to normal again, thanks to Nicci.”She stretched out her hand toward the vast valley. “We have to go down there,around the rim, then up into the high desert. See the plateau there on thehorizon? The canyons and Cliffwall are there.”Oliver sat behind her on the horse, felt her firm body against him. He spokemore for Peretta’s benefit than for anyone else’s. “Yes, we’re almost home.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 58 [contents.xhtml#c_ch58]After smashing through the high window, Nicci fell through space, plummeting outinto darkness. The cold claws of the night air grabbed at her battered body.Blood droplets from her wounds sprayed in the air, flowing upward and driftingaway like red stars among the strange constellations.She plunged, her black dress whipping around her. The stone walls of the rulingtower flashed past, and then the stark cliffs of the plateau’s edge as shehurtled toward the twinkling lights, rooftops, and convoluted streets of thelower city far below.She felt like a bird, a black raven with broken wings dropping toward her death.But Nicci could not fly, because she was not a bird. She was a sorceress. Shewas Death’s Mistress. And although Adessa had battered her and Sovrena Thora haddelivered the coup de grâce by blasting her through the windows, Nicci was notdestroyed, not defeated.She fell … but she could save herself. She had controlled the wind before, usingher gift to manipulate the air, pulling together a solid barrier. Now, despiteher pain-scrambled thoughts, she drew in a quick breath, tasting iron blood inher mouth. She summoned the breezes into a lifeline, gathered the winds beneathher to slow her fall.Rooftops rushed toward her with the speed of an arrow in flight. Nicci had onlyseconds.She strengthened the air, pushed it around her, felt her body tumble. The tiledroofs and tangled streets shot closer, and she knew she was still going toofast. She spread out her arms, trying to guide her descent. With a nudge of windshe knocked herself sideways, scraping past the sharp gutter of a three-storybuilding, only twenty feet from impact.Nicci cried out, drawing upon all the magic she possessed. She refused to fail,refused to die. But even though her anger was strong, she didn’t have theprecise control she needed. The backlash of breezes buffeted her in the air andslammed her into the building wall as she dropped into the chasm of a darkalley.With one last burst she turned onto her back, slowed herself—and crashed ontothe slimy, garbage-strewn cobblestones of a dark street behind a tannery and awarehouse.She cracked her head against the hard ground, and surrendered to merciful halfconsciousness. Nicci didn’t let herself slip into the blissful blackness,though. She had often escaped into the blessed respite of unconsciousness as apersonal defense. Many times, Jagang had beaten her senseless when he raped her,and that brief escape into oblivion was sometimes her only way to defy him. Shewould surrender completely to the blows just to deny him the satisfaction ofhearing her cry out from the pain.Nicci didn’t need to escape now, though. She couldn’t hide from the pain. Thispain was part of her. This pain meant she had survived. She lay for a longmoment with her eyes closed, smelling the stink of tannery chemicals, thediscarded scraps of yaxen hide, the gobbets of tissue scraped from the leatherand dumped in a midden pile for the rats to fight over. She heard the rodentsrustling through the dripping liquid in the gutters, stirring the garbage in aback alley where no one would see.Lying motionless, Nicci took a silent inventory of her body, tasting the bloodin her mouth, smelling it caked in her nose. Her head throbbed from a crackedskull, probably a concussion. Her muscles had been smashed from the brutalcombat as well as the fall, and she knew her pale skin would become a mottledcanvas of bruises. As she inhaled and exhaled, she could tell that several ofher ribs were cracked.A sufficiently gifted wizard could have healed her, but she was all alone hereexcept for the rats. She could use her own gift to heal herself, once sheregained enough strength … but that would be a long time coming. She doubted anyof the wizards of Ildakar would lift a finger to help her, even if some of themalso secretly resented the sovrena’s hard ways. They would not admit it now thatNicci had failed in her challenge.At least she hadn’t been turned to stone, like the defiant sorceress Lani. Thatmeant she could still fight. For now she had to endure, and survive.Nicci opened her eyes. Despite the pain, she forced herself to move, getting toher feet slowly and methodically, catching her breath. She looked up between thebuildings that rose on either side of her, the tannery and the warehouse. Theominous pinnacle of the ruling tower stood like a sentinel on the edge of theplateau. It seemed impossibly high above her. She couldn’t believe she hadfallen that far and lived.When she looked at the walls of the warehouse, Nicci noticed unexpected glintsof lights, jagged reflections flashing from cracks in the bricks. Mirror shards.Pieces of sharp-edged reflective glass left as a sign.Mirrormask! The rebels.Holding on to the wall for balance, Nicci made her way along. The shadows in thealley were easy and comforting. She leaned against the cool stone of thewarehouse and rested, catching her breath. She knew she needed to move again—butshe was all alone in the city, and had nowhere to go.This late, the streets were deserted, and that was good. She wanted to be alone,to assess what to do next. Each step drained the last scraps of energy from her.She had expended too much power during her fight against the morazeth, defendingherself against the sovrena’s blast, and then stopping her fall. Now she hadnothing left. Nothing. Nathan was unconscious and might never recover. Shedidn’t know where Bannon was. Mrra was held in a cage. Nicci was on her own.Her vision was so blurred and the thoughts so loud in her head that she didn’tat first notice the furtively moving figures. Nicci flinched, drew back, knowingshe could not let any guards see her. But this wasn’t High Captain Stuart or hisarmed city guards. These were the rebels.One hurried forward, speaking in a gruff voice. “It’s the sorceress. Mirrormaskwill want her.”Her knees trembled, and she tried to draw on her pride and determination. Shestepped forward to face the rebels, but she buckled and slid back against thewall. The hooded figures rushed up to catch her.“The sovrena … did this.” She drew a breath that stabbed like sharp knife bladesin her lungs, in her side. “I need to kill her.” Their faces were masked withshadows, and Nicci had only the smallest reason to trust them, yet this was theonly hope she had.She felt hands on her arms, propping her up. “Come with us, Sorceress. We have aplace to take you, a place that will be safe.”Those words were all she needed to hear. She surrendered to the calming blackoblivion.* * *Nicci awoke in a dank place that smelled of mist. She heard the gentle flow ofwater like a lover’s soft whisper. She blinked her blue eyes, tried to focus,and looked around to see narrow stone-walled passages lit by enclosed lanterns.The tunnel was smooth and dark, as if some giant magical worm had burrowed itsway through the sandstone uplift. Through the center flowed a stream of water,like an arrow-straight underground canal. The aqueducts! A stone walkway fourfeet wide extended into the darkness on either side of the water.She lay on a wooden pallet softened by several layers of blankets. Her makeshiftbed rested on the solid walkway near the water. She turned, expecting anexplosion of pain from bruises and broken bones, but although she felt the rawache of healing, she no longer seemed to be on the verge of death.“Someone healed me,” she muttered, surprised by the realization. Someone gifted.“Where am I?” Her voice was dry and raspy, her throat parched, despite themoisture in the air. She lifted her head, saw figures in brown robes. They hadshrugged down their hoods, not afraid of showing their identity here. The menand women watched her, looking pale and frightened, but defiant.She propped herself up, which created a stir among the rebels. One ran down thetunnel to get help, while two came forward to assist her. “Ease yourself,Sorceress.”An older woman handed her a shallow bowl filled with water, and Nicci drankgreedily. It tasted clear, cool, and glorious. She drained the bowl and wantedmore, but her helper refused. “Too much and you will vomit. Take it slow.” Thewoman handed her a soft knot of bread, and Nicci tore off a piece. “I baked thismyself and stole it away from my master. The bread will give you strength. Youstill have much healing to do.”“I’ve healed enough.” Chewing the delicious bread, she forced herself to sit up,swinging her feet off the pallet to touch the cool stone of the walkway. “Enoughto contemplate my next actions.”Her black dress had been removed and was folded neatly beside her. She gatheredblankets around her, seeking warmth to offset the cold anger that sizzledthrough her. She took in the details of her surroundings. The air smelled ofclean moisture, not the stink of sewers, not the sour stench of the alley behindthe tannery. Sharp memories came back to her. “Thora … Adessa.”“Shush now, you don’t need to worry about them. I am Melba. Recover here. Fightthem later.” The old woman’s lips curved in a grim smile. “We are all ready tofight them.”“Where are we? Who are these people?”“You already know the answer to both of those questions, Sorceress,” said a malevoice.When she turned, pain shot down her back, but she faced the new figure, who worehooded gray robes and a smooth silvery oval across his face. The reflective maskmuffled his voice, but his words had a certain power.“You challenged the evil in the ruling tower. You were defeated, alas … but youwere not destroyed. We’ll help make you strong again.” Mirrormask paused. “So wecan all be stronger and change Ildakar forever.”“Yes.” Nicci felt a strange glimmer of confidence. “Let us find a way to destroythem. How long … has it been?”Mirrormask came closer to her pallet. “You have been unconscious for more than aday. It is a good thing my followers found you soon after you fell, before thecity guard did.” He let out a soft chuckle. “The fact that they can’t find yourbody has caused them great consternation.”“We heard about your combat,” said Melba, offering another small piece of bread.“It sounded brave and admirable.”“I failed,” Nicci said.“Nevertheless, you shook them up,” Mirrormask said. “Just as we did when wereleased the combat animals to cause chaos in the city.” His followers hadgathered around to listen to her words, joining Melba. In their shining eyes andeager expressions, Nicci saw that she added hope to their very existence … ahope Nicci wasn’t sure she deserved.“We must keep doing damage until we have broken the old order,” Mirrormaskcontinued. “The black society of Ildakar must be reshaped. The council has ruledfor too long without change, and the people have suffered. That must end.” Thesecretive rebels gathered around and muttered their agreement.“I will do everything in my power to help you make that happen,” Nicci vowed.Mirrormask nodded, as if he had expected no less."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 59 [contents.xhtml#c_ch59]Like a sculpture made of flesh-colored candle wax, the white-haired wizard laystretched out on the rune-bordered table in the fleshmancer’s studio.Nathan Rahl looked well preserved and regal, full of the potential to be a greatwizard, if he could be restored to the power he’d once possessed. Andre admiredhim, happy for the chance to perform such an experiment, like a sculptor workingwith the finest, rarest piece of marble.Sometimes, though, in even the most perfect chunk of stone, hidden flaws couldcause a statue to break. He wondered if Nathan had any such internal flaw thatwould prove to be his undoing.“We shall see what you’re made of, hmmm?” He stroked his fingertip down the longscar on the center of the wizard’s chest, where Andre had split flesh and bone,pried his breastbone apart, and scooped out his still-beating, but ungifted,heart to replace it with Ivan’s. “Only time will tell.”When he stepped back, Nathan didn’t even stir. His body was cold, his breathingslow and shallow. The eyelids looked like delicate parchment covering agelesseyes of piercing azure blue.Nathan Rahl claimed to be a thousand years old, which made him an impressiveanomaly among his own people, though the wizards of Ildakar had lived muchlonger than that, thanks to their shroud of eternity.Andre himself had lived for nearly two millennia. He had been five centuriesold, with his gift at its peak, when General Utros marched in with hisastonishing army. Hundreds of thousands of men had depleted all the crops andorchards on their march over the mountains, razed any villages on the way justto keep the army going for another few days. Demanding surrender, they hadarrived at Ildakar expecting to strip that city bare of its wealth. Utros hadpromised to feed his army with the spoils of Ildakar.But Ildakar had defeated them.Leaving Nathan in his healing coma, Andre walked through the wings of hismansion, thinking of how he and his fellow wizards had faced the great army ofEmperor Kurgan. As a fleshmancer, Andre had been so strong then, so cocky, soambitious. Faced with that threat, he had created some of his best work.He entered the large separate wing, using his gift to increase the illumination.With a sigh of pride, he looked up at the three armored titans, his Ixaxwarriors, whom he had created to be the greatest defenders of Ildakar,invincible soldiers who could ravage thousands of the enemy single-handedly—ifthe war ever came to direct combat. Once unleashed, these gigantic fightingmachines would attack like starving hounds in a henhouse, mowing down enemies asfast as they could move.Andre stood with his hands clasped behind his back, admiring their mammotharmored forms, the brass-studded armbands and wristbands, the huge gauntletscovering fists the size of boulders. The three Ixax warriors stood straight,massive arms at their sides, boots together, thick metal helmets covering theirheads and faces, leaving only a slit for their eyes.“Ah, I always marvel at you!” Andre said. “I’m so glad I created you, but I’malso disappointed that the wizards’ duma stopped me from making more thanthree.” He sniffed. “We could have used an entire Ixax army, hmmm?”He walked from the first titan to the second, gazing at the rippled musclesunder the thick contoured armor. “Ready and waiting, and oh so devoted.”Smiling, he walked with a light step to the third gigantic soldier.“I built you each from the raw material of a lowly soldier, a conscript who wasdoomed to die on the battlefield. Now look at you.” He raised his hands. “Lookat what you’ve become!”Andre clucked his tongue. “Ah, if only my magic could have given you increasedpatience. It must seem a very long time to wait, hmmm?” He snickered. “In caseyou haven’t been able to keep track, you’ve been standing there motionless formore than one thousand five hundred years. Every day, frozen in place … awakeand watching.”The nearest Ixax warrior was so tall that his thigh was at the fleshmancer’schest level, and Andre ran his fingers along the stippled surface of the poundedgreave. “You have to be ready to fight, ready to be unleashed in an instant. Notime to wake you if we need your might. I’m sorry it has proven troublesome foryou. What grandiose thoughts you must have had while you stood here,” he said,but his voice took on a taunting lilt. “Oh, the great ideas you must havethought of, hmmm? Too bad you had no way to record them. An artistic man mighthave composed beautiful poetry, an epic thousands and thousands of lines long.I’m sure that’s how you devoted your thoughts over the years. What else did youhave to think of?”He raised his eyebrows.None of the three Ixax warriors twitched. They were like enormous statues. Buthe knew that living, conscious beings were trapped inside that armor. “Howfrustrating it must have been for you.” The taunting tone became richer, moreprominent. “All that time, unable to move a muscle. Don’t you wish you couldjust … stretch your legs?”He stepped in front of the middle Ixax, tapping the armor with his fingertip.“Can you feel that? What if you need to scratch your nose? Do you have an itch,hmmm?”He strolled in front of them, reveling in his success at creating these giantwarriors. Though the three flesh sculptures were long finished, the Ixaxwarriors were like clay in his hands. He could still break them if he wished,and he was bored.He said, “Just imagine you have an itch.…” He snickered.Through the slits in their massive helmets, the yellow eyes of the threemotionless Ixax glared at him."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 60 [contents.xhtml#c_ch60]As she recovered in the shadowy aqueducts of Ildakar, Nicci found the strengthto use her own healing gift to repair the bruises and knit the cracked bones.Someone had used moist cloths for tender ministrations while she wasunconscious, cleaning her up, wiping the blood from her face. But, moremystifying, she knew that someone else had healed her enough to keep her alive.Therefore, someone among the rebels possessed the gift, which meant that not allof these rebels were mere slaves or members of the lower classes. The ability toheal injuries so severe was not minimal magic.When Nicci asked Melba and the others about it, no one answered her questions,but she didn’t need to know the answers. She would rely on herself, gather herown strength. She was already making plans about how to challenge the rulingcouncil members again, particularly Sovrena Thora.As soon as she was ready.Restless, she explored the aqueduct tunnels that wound throughout the city. Oneof the rebels who attended her, a soft-spoken middle-aged man named Rendell,accompanied her with a lit lantern. He knew his way around the maze.He explained, “Our water supply flows in from creeks and streams across theplain, but the bulk of it comes from the Killraven River.”“But the river is far below, at the bottom of the bluff,” Nicci said.“The wizards use transfer runes to make the water flow where they wish it togo—uphill, downhill, it does not matter.” Rendell paused at an intersection,looked at the flowing water in the canal, and chose to go left. Nicci followedhim. The light of his lantern shed a warm orange glow on the sandstone walls.“With their gift they distribute water throughout the city, filling thefountains, basins, and gardens of the gifted nobles.”Nicci adjusted the skirts at her knees as she bent down and extended her fingersinto the flowing water. “That must require a great effort.”He looked at her. “Of course, and the wizards of Ildakar are not averse tomaking grand and unnecessary gestures to prove their strength.”Nicci wiped her wet hand on her dress. “No, I suppose they’re not.”Rendell was a household slave who had run away from the wizard Damon, hadchanged his allegiance to Mirrormask, and had hidden here in the aqueducts formore than a year. Damon had considered the man nothing more than an object, likefurniture. Although Rendell’s expression rarely showed any emotions, his eyesflashed when he spoke about his freedom. Nicci could read the simmering outragethere, a power that Mirrormask had channeled. All of his followers felt the sameway.Nicci spoke to them in order to understand who they were. Some were escapedhousehold slaves who had been in Ildakar for their entire lives, while otherswere new arrivals, sold by the Norukai in the last few years. Some visited thetunnels rarely, while others remained underground all the time, like beetlesburrowing through the rotted hulk of a fallen tree. Mirrormask visited onlyevery day or so, and even in the safe secrecy of the tunnels he never removedthe reflective disguise across his face.He found Nicci while she walked the tunnels with her guide. Her own distortedreflection greeted her where his face should have been. “There you are! I knowyou are growing impatient, Sorceress. Come with me. We have another guest downhere in the aqueducts, and I think you will enjoy our conversation with him.”With a swirl of his gray robes, he strode down the tunnel. “It will likely behis last conversation.”Nicci followed, wary and curious. They passed along the branched, low-ceilingedtunnels and crossed over narrow plank bridges the rebels had laid down. Near anintersection of canals, they came upon a small alcove which had become a dungeoncell.A naked man was manacled to the rough wall. Iron bolts fastened the chainssecurely in place, and the prisoner stood stretched upright, so that his feetbarely touched the ground. When the man saw them coming, he twisted andthrashed, hissing at them like a captive reptile.The comparison was apt, Nicci saw, when she recognized the horrifically scarredface, the slashes from the corners of the lips all the way back to the hinge ofthe jaw, the scale tattoos, the pair of long thin brown braids that dangled fromthe back of his shaved skull. A glare simmered in the captive Norukai’s shadowedeyes. He twisted on the chains, throwing himself to the extent of the links. Shewatched the muscles ripple beneath his emaciated form. His ribs stood out,reminding her of the sea-serpent skeleton that she, Nathan, and Bannon hadencountered along the shore of the Phantom Coast.“That’s the Norukai who went missing.” She narrowed her eyes, trying to recallthe man’s name. “Dar.”“Yes, the others sailed off without him, which demonstrates how loyal they areto their own people,” said Mirrormask. “The Norukai wear the armor of arrogance,but that armor is no shield against freedom. Dar now understands what it is liketo be a captive.”“Walking meat,” Nicci said.The Norukai snapped his jaws like a wild animal trying to bite its tormentor.“Well, he won’t be walking very much.” Mirrormask stepped up to within ahandsbreadth of the twisting prisoner. “His comrades left him here for us toplay with. Many of my followers remember the gentle caresses of the Norukaibefore they were sold to Ildakar.”Much of Dar’s body was an angry deep red. All along his arms, as well asrectangular patches on his thighs and the left side of his back, his flesh wasraw and red. She realized that the skin had been flayed off of him.Mirrormask saw her attention and said, “I have to give my followers something. Igive them sharp knives and let them take their revenge, one narrow strip at atime.” He chuckled. “The waiting list is quite long.” He turned his reflectiveface toward Nicci, and although she could read no expression, she heard the toneof his muffled voice change. “It has been a challenge for me to keep the othersfrom killing him. Such anger…” Under the hood, he shook his head. “Such angercould be so useful.”“And has the pain been useful, too? Have you interrogated him?” Nicci knew howdangerous and loathsome the Norukai were, and she didn’t trust them to have nointerest beyond mere trade. “Do you know why they come to Ildakar?”“To sell slaves.”“And is that all? I think I can get more information from him.” Nicci actuallyrelished the prospect. She remembered how the ruling council had seen noadvantage in questioning the rejuvenated stone soldier Ulrich.“We are fighting for freedom,” said Mirrormask. “We have little experience ininterrogation.”Nicci smiled. “Then allow me.” She recalled torturing captives for EmperorJagang, and she had been very good at extracting vital information. “A flickerof fire in the lung, cracking one bone at a time, raising heat in the marrow, ormaybe freezing one eyeball, then the other.”Dar strained against his manacles again, and Nicci saw the raider’s strength inthe rattling links. Given time and his refusal to accept the pain around hisbloodied wrists, Dar could probably work the iron bolts free from the sandstonewall—if Mirrormask decided to keep him that long.Dar hissed and snapped his grotesque mouth. “You will all die! King Grieve willavenge me.”“King Grieve doesn’t know you are here,” Mirrormask said, “and since the shroudis back in place again, there’s nothing he can do.”Grimacing in pain, Dar thrashed again. “Oh, he will be back the moment yourshroud drops. He will bring all the Norukai. He is already building his naviesand his armies.”“You sound brave,” Nicci said, “but I know nothing about this King Grieve. Hecan’t be much of a threat.”“You will know his name,” Dar snarled. “Grieve—named because that is what peopledo when they have seen him.”Nicci realized that the Norukai was simmering. He wanted to boast about hispeople. “He is so eager to talk, I might not even need to use my techniques.”Disappointment was clear in her voice.Mirrormask said in a bored voice, “King Grieve will get revenge. Yes, yes, we’revery frightened.” He turned to Nicci. “Sorceress, would you like to peel a stripof skin for your own satisfaction?” He withdrew a curved, golden-hilted knifefrom his gray robe.Nicci recognized it. “That looks like one of the sacrificial knives the councilmembers held during the blood magic.”“Yes, a fitting irony, don’t you think? One of the raiders who sold thesacrificial slaves now has to face pain from the same sort of knife.”“Where did you get it?” Nicci asked.Mirrormask held up the blade, turned it in front of his reflective face as ifregarding the details. “My followers are everywhere.”“King Grieve and his army will come here,” Dar insisted. “Why do you think ourslavers trade with Ildakar? We are gathering information. You think your city isinvincible, but you are overconfident and weak.” His excessive jaw opened andclosed like a flapping skull. He worked up the saliva to spit at them, but itonly drooled down the scarred sides of his mouth. “We sell the walking meat,take your gold, and learn everything about your city so that we can capture italong with the rest of the Old World.”“He is quite ambitious, isn’t he?” Mirrormask said in his muffled voice.Nicci did not dismiss the threat so lightly. “What do you mean, the Norukai havearmies and navies? How do they intend to conquer the Old World?”Dar sneered at them. “You are all walking meat to us. You are weak. We build ourstrength on the Norukai islands, and we intend to take over the mainland.” Helaughed. “We saw the thousands of stone soldiers outside of your city. Youthought that was a fierce army? With our ships, we will have twice as manywarriors—and soon we will launch.” He laughed, knowing he would die eventually.Nicci wondered how long the rebels would continue peeling the skin off of him.He could probably survive for days longer.Rendell and several other rebels had quietly followed them down the tunnels towatch the interrogation, and many of them seemed restless and hungry, wantingtheir chance to inflict pain as well.Mirrormask looked at the golden-handled knife, where his reflection ricochetedin the polished steel of the blade. “Alas, you will not be here to see thatvictory.”In a swift motion, he slashed the Norukai’s throat. Dar writhed and jittered onthe manacle chains. As blood spurted out, Mirrormask deftly stepped aside sothat the spraying crimson did not splatter his gray robe, but several warm dropsstruck Nicci’s cheek. The other rebels stood back, muttering as the blood floweddown the slaver’s naked chest, pooling on the narrow walkway and dripping intothe canal, adding blood to the city’s water supply.The people of Ildakar had been exposed to blood before. Nicci was not queasyabout the murder of Dar, or the blood in the canal. “I do not like his talk of agreat conquering army. What do we know of the Norukai?”“Very little, nor do I care,” Mirrormask said. “We are protected inside theshroud. The business of Ildakar is my concern.”After Dar stopped twitching, Mirrormask grasped his forehead and pressed himback against the sandstone wall. He pressed hard with the long knife and sawedacross the throat again, slicing through the larynx, windpipe, and finally thespine. He held Dar’s severed head by one of the dangling braids at the back ofthe skull and tossed it to Rendell, who meekly caught it. Blood splashed on theescaped slave’s drab clothes.Mirrormask said, “Under cover of darkness, take that and mount it on a pikesomewhere inside the city. Because of the shroud, we can’t take it to one of thepaths leading to Ildakar, as we did with the others. But the message should beplain enough.”The rebel leader turned and strode away along the aqueduct tunnels, leaving hishidden nest of followers."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 61 [contents.xhtml#c_ch61]Warm afternoon breezes picked up, whistling through the narrow slickrockcanyons, but the wizard Renn kept his eyes downcast, watching his feet as theyplodded one step after another. The eleven surviving members of the expeditionled by Captain Trevor trudged along the unruly paths.None of them knew where they were going.“I am certain we’re almost there,” Trevor said, for the fifth time that day. Hisfoolish optimism was the only thing that kept him from insanity.After they crossed over the spectacular pass of Kol Adair and worked their wayinto the lower mountains, they found worn paths that were overgrown with weeds,even trees. It was as if the world had reshaped itself to erase any stubbornmarkings left by ancient humanity. Eventually the expedition had found the highdesert plateau and the start of the slickrock canyons. The expedition keptmoving onward, convincing themselves they were on the right path.…Desperate for a drink, the group fought through stunted piñon pines, spiky yuccaplants, and brittle gray tamarisk. The soldiers could hear the flowing stream,so close, so inaccessible. Somewhere in the tamarisk thicket, water flowed intoa pothole and then spilled over the rock. “Keeper’s crotch!” said one of thesoldiers. “Curse these weeds.” They used their swords to hack away at thestubborn tamarisk, splintering sharp dry twigs.“Wizard, can’t you use your magic to make a path?” asked another downcastsoldier. “Or at least to tell us where we are?”“My gift isn’t a map,” Renn said. His throat was too dry to argue. “Don’t youthink if I could, I would have created a magic map two weeks ago?”“It was just a suggestion, Wizard,” Trevor said in a calming voice.Scratching the bothersome stubble on his multiple chins, Renn huffed. “Stepback. I can use magic to clear that debris. It’ll be something, at least.”The nine soldiers backed away from the aggressive thicket clogged around thetrickle of water. Renn jerked his hand and called upon his gift to uproot thestubborn, spiky growths. Expressing his anger and frustration at the wholesituation, he yanked the tamarisks out of the ground and sent them away withsuch vehemence that the dry branches whistled through the air until they crashedfar down the canyon in a heap of debris. The water continued to gurgle from thespring, but now it was a muddy mess. The pools of clear water were slurries ofred mud from the slickrock soil. Crowding forward, the men stared in dismay.“Now we can’t drink that.”“Just wait for it to settle out,” said Captain Trevor, always cheerful. “Or wecan filter it through rags.”“Let’s camp here,” Renn suggested, though it was still just midafternoon. “Atleast we know there’ll be water.”“What about food?” asked one of the soldiers. “Our packs are empty.”“Go catch some lizards,” Trevor commanded. When the soldiers grumbled, hereplied, “If you complain, then you aren’t hungry enough.”The soldiers, once brave members of the Ildakaran city guard, had becomescavengers, foraging up and down the canyons, throwing rocks at lizards ortrying to catch them with their bare hands. Three days ago, one man had found abush filled with dark purple berries, which he ate greedily, not wanting toshare with his fellows. He had returned sheepishly to camp, his lips discolored.His companions were upset with him for having gorged himself on fresh fruit.The man had died screaming that night, vomiting and spasming from the poison.After that, they were much more careful.Renn longed for his own villa back in Ildakar, his household slaves, hisgardens, his lovely wind chimes. “We were not trained as woodsmen,” hecomplained to Trevor, loud enough for the other soldiers to hear.As the scouts came back with their meager offerings from the hunt, they evenbrought the dried branches of the uprooted tamarisk for the campfire. The dry,airy wood blazed so hot and fast, the fire got out of their control and setnearby bushes on fire. Renn was again forced to call upon his magic—and some ofthe water from the spring—to extinguish the blaze.It was just one more catastrophe on their endless journey.Renn hated the sovrena and the wizard commander, resenting them for sending himout on this fool’s errand without a clear goal, without specific directions totheir destination, and without any training. They had been pampered inside thelegendary city for their entire lives. When had Renn ever needed to know how tocamp, hunt, or find edible roots and leaves? None of them knew. The city guardhad no such training.Now they were lost and miserable in the wasteland. They had been gone for solong, he doubted they could ever find their way back home. Instead, they had todiscover Cliffwall and claim the vast libraries of magic in the name of Ildakar.Renn wasn’t so sure he even cared about Ildakar anymore.As they bedded down to sleep, still smelling the smoke from the now-smotheredcampfire, Captain Trevor said, “I’m sure we’ll get there tomorrow.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 62 [contents.xhtml#c_ch62]From her seat in the high ruling tower, Thora could feel the dark energy andunrest in the streets of Ildakar, and it made her furious. She had been on edgefor days, ever since the defiant sorceress Nicci challenged her.Thora had been suspicious of the outside visitors since their arrival. Such anunsettling and contradictory worldview did not fit well with what she and herfellow wizards had accomplished in Ildakar, the perfect society. Nicci had beenquick to criticize, but she didn’t belong here, and her wizard companion had nopowers. Thora wished they had never come to the city.At least the outside sorceress was defeated now, and Nathan still layunconscious in the fleshmancer’s mansion. Maybe he would be less of an annoyancewhen he woke up. If Andre’s experiment did restore his gift, then Nathan Rahlmight feel gratitude. And if he proved intractable, Thora would destroy him aswell.Meanwhile, the useless young man Bannon was being trained in the combat pits.That way he could serve some purpose to the city. Yes, all was well.At the sovrena’s request, Adessa came to the ruling chamber first thing in themorning to give her report. As it was early, Maxim and the duma members were notpresent.The morazeth leader stood below the throne, knowing her place. “Bannon Farmer isan adequate fighter, Sovrena. He even fought well against our champion, thoughhe suffered a severe concussion. Lila has been instructing him. He needs to bethoroughly blooded, but he will be a decent warrior once he is finished.”“At least he will serve as sufficient entertainment,” Thora said. “I don’t careif he falls in his first combat. He was Nicci’s friend, and that still angersme.”Across the room, fresh masonry showed where workers had repaired the edges ofthe smashed windows and the wall. Much of Adessa’s spell-marked skin wasdiscolored from the many blows that Nicci had landed on her. Adessa called itthe price of her combat. Every blow was one little defeat. Even though she hadultimately helped destroy Nicci, the morazeth had not won her battle as quicklyor cleanly as the sovrena had expected.“Have you found her body yet?” Thora asked. “She fell from the tower, so shemust be sprawled down in the city below.”Adessa twitched as she turned away. “No, Sovrena. Captain Stuart and the cityguard have searched the streets and the rooftops. We should have found herbroken corpse somewhere down there.”In cages behind her raised chair, newly captured larks twittered and chirped,but their music did little to calm Thora now. She stood from her throne andwalked across the polished blue marble tiles to the newly repaired windows. Shethrew them open, breathing in the cool morning breeze, and stared down at thecity. Nicci had been flung through these windows with all the force Thora couldsummon. She could have fallen anywhere. “I’d expect some citizen to report asmashed body in his backyard or gutters.”“We would expect that, Sovrena, yet it has not happened.”“Find her body,” Thora said. “The people are talking about Nicci as much as theymutter about that fool Mirrormask.”Though no duma meeting had been called that morning, she preferred to stay inthe ruling chamber, because it was hers. Sitting on her throne, staring out thewindows, the sovrena was reminded of her power and her place. Ildakar belongedto her. The duma members, and even her husband, were just trappings. She was thesovrena, and this was her utopia, her plan all along. She had developed hervision after seeing the army of General Utros cross the plains. The rest ofIldakar had been terrified, but Thora had seen an opportunity.With the shroud in place, they were protected, yes, but they were also shelteredfrom outside influences, dangerous ideas, the poison of teachings and opinionsthat did not match her own. Ildakar had been perfect for fifteen centuries …until the magic weakened and the shroud spell faded. A decade ago, the legendarycity had flickered and returned from its bubble outside of time—exposed andvulnerable. Visitors could come from lands afar and bring their unsettling ideasthat did not belong in Ildakar.Nicci was merely the most egregious example of the dangers Ildakaran societyfaced. Fortunately, after the recent bloodworking, the shroud was back andSovrena Thora could rest easily … for a time.But she also knew that spell was thin and temporary, because they had notspilled enough blood. She and Maxim continually bickered over whether to makethe shroud permanent again. The rules of magic in the outside world had changeddramatically, unstable and shifting now, and Thora couldn’t tell how long even agrand-scale bloodletting would last.But it had to be done.As she stood inside the ruling chamber, listening to the breeze curl through theopen windows, Thora made up her mind. She was the sovrena. She didn’t care whatthe duma members thought, because they would follow her command. Some mightmutter, and Maxim would surely complain—but he always complained, and she wouldkeep to her decision.“The shroud is in place,” Thora said, “but we must make it stronger.”Adessa straightened. “The only way to make the shroud stronger is to shed moreblood.”“Yes,” Thora said with a thin smile, “and we must shed so much blood that theshroud remains intact for a thousand years. That will give us enough time toferret out Mirrormask and his vermin. Begin the preparations! We have to restoreand calibrate the apparatus on top of the pyramid, but I want you to beginselecting and gathering slaves, all of the remaining ones the Norukai justbrought, and more.” She tapped a finger on the stone sill of the window,calculating. “I would say three hundred. Yes, let us make it three hundred.Round up the candidates we need, seize additional ones from the gifted nobles …and if they complain, tell them to consider it a tax for their own safety.”She slowly paced the room as thoughts churned in her mind. Yes, all that bloodwould be extravagant, but powerful. “Have the slave masters work with them, usethe peaceflowers to keep them docile.” She climbed back to the dais and settledinto her throne, where she belonged.“That will take some time, Sovrena,” Adessa said. “At least two or three days.”“Two days,” Thora said. “And enlist the aid of the city guard as well. Thepeople will cheer and rejoice. They know what Ildakar used to be and what it canbe again—but only if the shroud is permanent.”She was still troubled about Nicci’s challenge, which had very nearly succeeded.Thora stared at the petrified figure of the sorceress Lani standing near thewall. That woman had been defiant, too—principled and naive, wishing to expandthe duma to include members of the lower castes. Absurd!Lani had been overconfident in her own abilities and underestimating Thora’s.She had been a dreamer, a gifted woman who played with water and performedtricks for children, as if the gift were such a trivial thing. Lani, too, hadfed birds and drawn them around her. Thora remembered how she would delight instanding on the highest levels of the tower, holding out her arms and lettingthe songbirds flit around her.After the sovrena defeated that challenge, she had decided to cage the larks,which seemed appropriate. Beaten and bleeding, Lani had crawled away,withdrawing her challenge, begging and surrendering. Lani thought that would bethe end of the matter, but the sovrena was just getting started. Taking hiswife’s side, Maxim had worked his petrification spell to turn the defeatedchallenger into the statue just as Lani turned with a last gesture of defiance.Lani served as a grim reminder for any other duma members who might consider asimilar challenge—as Nicci had done. And Nicci had failed as well.Thora gritted her teeth, still wishing they could find the woman’s lifelessbody. Maybe she could convince her husband to turn the broken corpse to stone.She wanted to stand Nicci’s mangled statue in the ruling chamber as yet anotherreminder.“Three hundred slaves will be rounded up for the ceremony, as you command,Sovrena,” Adessa said with a curt bow. “Although with that much bloodshed, Iwish we could use some of the slaves in the combat arena. It seems a waste. Allthose potential fighters…”“It is not a waste if the bloodworking solidifies the shroud,” Thora said. “Wewill have plenty of time to encourage the common slaves to breed and replenishtheir stock.” Her face hardened. “Gather the sacrifices.”The morazeth nodded. “Yes, Sovrena. In two days.”“Two days,” Thora agreed. She could already feel the anticipation building."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 63 [contents.xhtml#c_ch63]Down in the training pits, with his body scabbed and sore, Bannon braced himselffor another day of training.His skull still thrummed with echoes of pain. He had been so severely injured byIan’s knout that one of the gifted workers had been forced to heal his crackedskull. Lila forcefully prevented the healer from doing anything more than wasabsolutely necessary, however. “The boy needs to feel his pain,” she had said.“Every bruise, every ache, every cut is a lesson he must remember.”“Sweet Sea Mother, I remember well enough,” Bannon groaned.Lila had playfully stroked his cheek. Her smile was filled with more hunger thanhumor. “I prefer to keep you intact for more play. You have so much to learn.”He resisted, but it did him no good. Soon enough he learned to use his energiesin more productive ways, such as keeping himself alive. He had heard nothing ofNathan or Nicci, but he was sure they must be looking for him. What if Amos andhis companions had covered up his disappearance? His heart ached.Sooner or later, the morazeth trainers would force him out into the main arenain front of the crowds. He was sure they would make him face some horrificopponent, like the two-headed warrior. What if Nicci and Nathan saw him from thestands, in the same way Bannon had recognized Ian? He could only imagine whatthe sorceress would do then, and a smile crossed his face, though he tried tohide it.But Bannon wasn’t sure he would even survive his training. Each day the work wasmore rigorous, more deadly.Gazing at him from across the corridor, Ian rested. Initially, his friend hadangrily ignored Bannon, but after their duel, the hardened champion more oftencame to the bars of his own cell to stare at him, as if memories had brokenthrough the scar tissue in his mind. Once, Bannon awoke in the middle of thenight to find that Ian had let himself out of his unlocked cell and stoodoutside of Bannon’s bars, just looking at him. As soon as Bannon stirred fromhis pallet to go speak to his childhood friend, Ian had melted back into his owncell, closed the barred gate, and stayed out of view, not responding when Bannoncalled his name in a desperate whisper.Today Ian watched him with narrowed eyes, his face showing no expression as Lilabrought Bannon out to Adessa near one of the sunken training pits. The morazethleader met them, her face grim, her dark eyes darting. He could tell she wasupset about something.That was never a good sign.Adessa’s skin was mottled with yellow and purple bruises, as if she had beenbadly beaten. Bannon took a hard pleasure from seeing that. “It looks like youlost your last combat,” he said, knowing it would provoke her.They stood above one of the sunken pits, similar to the one where he had firstsparred with Lila. Adessa’s face turned glacial, her lips drew back. “Isurvived, and my opponent did not. Therefore, I didn’t lose.”Bannon couldn’t imagine what sort of enemy might have inflicted so much physicalharm on the powerful morazeth.Lila handed him Sturdy, and he squeezed the leather-wrapped hilt. He still woreonly a loincloth and sandals, and he wished he had decent armor. He stood withhis muscles tense, his knees slightly bent in a crouch, at the edge of the pit.“We are preparing for the next arena exposition,” Adessa continued. “Let us seewhich of our two new combatants survives today’s training. Will you survive,Bannon?” She gave a quick nod to Lila.In a flash, the young woman shoved him backward, and he tumbled more than twelvefeet to the floor of the pit. As he struck the soft ground, he managed not tobreak any bones or impale himself with his own sword. Lila had trained him howto fall, how to land, how to recover. He sprang back to his feet, ready.He saw another barred opening at ground level behind which lurked … something.Adessa stood on the rim above with arms crossed over the black leather wrap.“Thanks to the rebels and their sabotage a week ago, we lost half of ourfighting animals, and we no longer have Chief Handler Ivan to control them. Butthe sovrena insists that we hold an exhibition to calm the people of Ildakar.Very soon, we will lose hundreds of slaves.” She shook her head, muttering toherself, “Such a waste, when they could become fighters and die in the arena.”Bannon planted his sandals on the soft ground and held up his sword. “I’d ratheryou fought me,” he shouted up to her. “That way I’d have more of an incentive towin. Or are you afraid to get more bruises?”Lila looked offended. “Am I not enough for you, boy?”Adessa did not respond to the provocation. She turned her head and called,“Summon the other fighters so they can observe which one dies. It is always goodfor them to smell fear and see fresh blood in the morning.”Lila whistled, and workers ran through the tunnels. Soon a group of spectatorsarrived, seasoned warriors, including Ian, who peered down into the pit towatch.Bannon glanced up at his friend, swallowing hard, but then he focused hisattention as he heard movement in the tunnel. The barred gate opened, and acreature padded forward from the shadows, growling. Bannon’s skin crawled whenhe saw the golden eyes, the rippling predatory form. A well-muscled tawny shapeemerged into the pit, an enormous sand panther, whose hide was branded withspell symbols.The big cat curled back lips to expose saberlike fangs. Her gaze locked onBannon, who stood in the middle of the pit, sword upraised. She growled a lowthreat; her long tail thrashed like a fleshy club.Bannon caught his breath in surprise. “Mrra!”The panther padded out, slinking low, her ears pressed back against her wideskull. Her whiskers fanned outward like sharp wires. She snarled, ready toattack any tormentor.Joining the spectators at the rim, the three apprentice animal handlersgathered, peering down at the lone panther. Mrra looked up at them and roared.Even Lila flinched, though she was far out of reach. The handlers stoodtogether, chattering, fascinated, as if it were an analytical exercise.Then the sand panther locked her gaze on Bannon again. Her opponent.He took two careful steps backward, holding the sword but raising his other handin a placating gesture. “It’s all right, Mrra. You know me. You remember me.”Mrra padded closer on her huge paws, leaving broad tracks in the sand. Bannonslowed his breathing, tried to exude a sense of blank calm. The golden felineeyes were sharp and hot, as if candle flames burned behind them. She sniffed theair, looked at him, then took several more steps forward as Bannon cautiouslybacked away.“You remember me,” he whispered. “Think of Nathan. Think of Nicci, your sisterpanther. I know there’s a spell bond. We fought you, and we saved you.”Adessa shouted down, “Fight! What is wrong with you?” She turned to thehandlers. “Have you not trained this one, Dorbo? Why isn’t she ready?”The three apprentices lifted their hands and released their gift, directingmagic down at the big cat. Mrra tensed, flattening her ears even further, andher eyes squinted. She snarled and spun around, roaring up at the rim.The handlers looked at one other, troubled. Their lantern-jawed leader grittedhis teeth, pushing more with his magic. Mrra spun back to look at Bannon as ifsome puppet master were forcing her head around. She obviously felt pain. Bannonsaw the muscles ripple beneath her beautiful tan hide, but he saw no recognitionbehind her eyes.He held Sturdy, its point extended and ready, afraid he would have to fight andkill Mrra, the same way he and his companions had been forced to kill her twosister panthers out in the desert. Bannon could see murder in the big cat’seyes, the bloodlust, the pain that blinded her to memories and personalconnections. Mrra did know him, but the provoked ferocity seemed to overwhelmher.She prowled closer, fangs bared, pushing him toward the back wall.The spectators yelled and hooted. Lila called out, “What are you waiting for,boy? Kill it before it kills you.”“Her name is Mrra!” he shouted.The sound of her name sparked something within the sand panther, and she boundedforward like a tawny thunderbolt. Bannon braced his legs and held his sword,sure that the big cat would impale herself on the blade. But Mrra’s paw knockedhis arm away, and her weight drove him to the ground. The heavy cat was on topof him, snarling, pressing her fangs close to his face. He knew she could ripout his throat with her teeth, slice him to ribbons with her claws.But Mrra just pressed him down, breathing her warm breath in his face. Bannonfroze, staring into the cat’s eyes. She roared one more time, then stepped offhis chest, leaving him flat on his back in the sand.Bannon’s heart pounded, and warm tears trickled out of the corners of his eyes.“Mrra…” he whispered. The sand panther moved away, though he lay there,vulnerable. The cat crouched in front of Bannon, faced the apprentice handlersand the spectators, and let out an earsplitting roar.Clearly upset, all three handlers blasted Mrra with their gift. She thrashed herpaws in the air, clawing at imaginary tormentors. Though she circled aroundBannon, she refused to harm him.With a mighty leap, she sprang up toward Adessa and the others and almostreached the rim of the sunken pit. Her claws scrabbled on the stone wall, caughtthe edge, and she kicked with her back paws, but she slipped back down andlanded heavily on the floor of the pit.The spectators retreated, frightened now.“Do something,” Adessa said. “Control the thing.”The handlers were furious, redoubling their attack. Mrra, seeking escape,bounded back into the dark tunnel, where she vanished from view.Panting hard, Bannon picked himself up and stood with his sword hanging loose athis side. He glared up at them. Among the silent fighters, Ian stood watchingwith a deeply troubled expression on his face.Feeling foolishly brave, Bannon shouted, “Adessa, why don’t you jump into thepit? I would be happy to fight you—and I’m sure Mrra would join me.”The morazeth leader darkened with fury. She glared at the apprentice handlers.“They are not ready. Fix that!” And she stalked off."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 64 [contents.xhtml#c_ch64]Nathan blinked his eyes and woke from a bottomless pit of pain into even morepain. He lay back on the hard table as his thoughts returned to him. Hisconsciousness swam up from the bottom of a deep ocean of inky oblivion.As the light gradually grew brighter in his eyes and he flickered back towakefulness, he feared what would be waiting for him when he returned to life.He swam in a dull half sleep, struggling to sort his thoughts, trying tounderstand where he was, but the agony in his chest was overpowering. Hesurrendered, sliding back into a deep sleep.…Some time later he tried again. Unbearable pain ripped through his bloodstream,his muscles, his mind, but eventually it became almost tolerable, and he calledupon his own strength, making himself brave the darkness. Wherever he was, hehad been here too long.He reminded himself he was Nathan Rahl. He had been a powerful prophet and amagnificent wizard. He was a scholar, a lover, an adventurer. He was not one tosurrender, no matter how much pain he had to endure. Without stirring, hemarshaled his thoughts and his energy, realizing that he heard a faint drumbeatin his ears. As he concentrated on the rhythm, it was slow and even, growinglouder.Thump, thump.Thump, thump.Like war drums calling an army to battle, it was ominous, insistent, powerful.Thump, thump. Thump, thump.No, he realized. Not drums. It was something more primal. A heartbeat—hisheartbeat, pumping strong and even, thudding within his chest.The shock and horror of returning memories almost pushed him back into thatblack pit. He remembered the mangled body of Chief Handler Ivan frozen on thecusp of death, and Fleshmancer Andre prying the big man’s chest apart, as if hewere peeling the rind off a fruit … reaching inside to scoop out Ivan’sstill-living heart. Then he had turned to Nathan as he lay paralyzed on thetable, unable to stop this horrific process. Andre had grinned down at himbefore pushing his fingers right into Nathan’s breastbone, cracking it open, andspreading his chest. He had wanted to scream, but he could not flinch.Now, using all of his effort, he managed to blink. Once.When his eyes were open and filled with light again, he saw that he lay in a dimroom surrounded by indigo hangings, cloths draped on the walls separating partsof the room. The fleshmancer’s studio.Nathan felt weak and exhausted, his body like a wadded-up scrap of parchmentdiscarded into a puddle. He breathed in a gasp of air. His throat was parched,and when he tried to speak, his voice sounded like a rasping tear that couldform no words.Thump, thump. Thump, thump.His heart was beating, his new heart—Chief Handler Ivan’s heart.“Ah, you are awake now, hmmm?”Nathan couldn’t turn his head, but he saw Andre leaning over him, his braidedbeard sticking out from his chin like a long brush. The fleshmancer grinned, andhis muddy eyes sparkled with delight. “I predicted you would wake thisafternoon. In this, as well as all of my other efforts, I am exactly correct.”He patted Nathan’s chest, and the touch of the fleshmancer’s fingers sent joltsof renewed pain through his heart, through his bones. Nathan winced.“You feel that? That means you’re alive. I told you so, hmmm?”Nathan managed to croak, “How…?” He couldn’t form any more of his sentence, butthe word itself invited so many possible answers.“How?” Andre mimicked. “How proud am I that you survived the experiment? Howlong will it be until you are a full-fledged wizard again?”Nathan drew a painful breath and managed to force out, “How … long?”“Oh, it has been some time. Several days. But you needed the recovery. Restassured that your heart is beating with great strength. I’m sure you can feelit. And since you now have the heart of a wizard—exactly as I promised—youshould be able to find your gift again! The lines of your Han have beenrestored. Here, I’ll let you see.”Andre disappeared from view, and Nathan could hear him rustling among papers andscrolls. The fleshmancer returned holding a white sheet on which colored lineswere etched in powder that had settled into new patterns. A new Han map,apparently made while Nathan lay recovering. Where previously the lines hadshown a void around Nathan’s chest, they now showed a gray web, lines restored,but without color, like the other paths of his Han.“It may take some time, but you can see, here and here.” He traced the lines ona picture of Nathan’s chest. “This may be Ivan’s gift, or some new pattern ofHan entirely. Your loss left an empty spot within you, and now the magic istrying to refill it.” Andre poked at Nathan’s chest with his forefinger, sendingjolts of pain. “You’ll just have to figure it out, hmmm?”Nathan felt his strength gradually returning. He was more awake now. The worldaround him had sharper edges, brighter colors. Tentatively, fearfully, he lethis thoughts sink into himself, tracing his heartbeat, the steady drumbeat.Yes … he felt a trickle there, a tingle of the gift that he remembered so well.The magic had been a part of him for all of his life, century upon century. Itsloss was still a raw wound within him, and he rejoiced to feel even a glimmer ofthe gift again.He hesitated. The last few times he actually used his gift had been a debacle,as his magic twisted and failed. He had tried to heal a poor dying man after theNorukai massacre at Renda Bay, and the gift had betrayed him, lunging out in adestructive backlash that caused exactly the opposite of what Nathan intended.Rather than healing the wounded victim, the magic had ripped him apart.When Nathan had attempted magic again, tentatively trying to summon the windwhen he was alone out in the forest, the resulting near cyclone got out of hand,smashing branches, uprooting trees. It was all he could do to dampen it againbefore the destruction became widespread enough to level the forest.The only time the backlash had worked to his advantage was in a final burst ofdesperation while the Adjudicator attempted to turn him to stone. With nothingto lose, he had released all restraint, all control of his gift, and the magichad ricocheted outward, turning the Adjudicator’s magic back upon him. Nathanhad not expected that, but he had survived.Now, considering the new Han map and the fact that his new heart came from Ivan,a gifted wizard of Ildakar, Nathan wondered exactly what his restored gift woulddo.As he listened to the drumbeat in his chest, feeling the blood flow, sensing thelife within him, he also felt an intrinsic anger there, a dark energy. It musthave simmered within Ivan for all his life. The chief handler had used thatdarkness to coerce obedience from the arena animals he trained. How much ofIvan’s core personality remained within his heart? And how much was now withinNathan?He knew he needed to rest and regain his strength before he attempted to usemagic. He was not ready, but Nathan didn’t want to admit that he was afraid. Hestirred, raising himself slightly, to the delight of Andre.“You will be back among us in no time! I cannot wait to show you off to theother wizards.” He leaned closer, grinning. “You’ll join us on the duma. We neednew members now, and if you show sufficient gratitude to me, I will be youradvocate. You have a great future here in Ildakar, Wizard Nathan.”“Can’t … stay,” Nathan said. “Other missions.” He blinked, drew a deep breath.Andre said, “Of course you’ll stay. The shroud has been restored. No one canleave Ildakar. The sovrena has an even grander plan for a tremendousbloodworking in two nights, which should make the shroud permanent. You will behere for a long, long time.”Alarmed, Nathan stirred, but didn’t have the energy to sit up or swing his feetoff the edge of the table. He gasped at the pain, caught his breath, pantingheavily. His vision swirled around him, but then he grew steady once more.“Where is Nicci? I need to see Nicci.”“I’m afraid that won’t be possible, dear Nathan.” Andre clucked his tongue andshook his head. “Quite a lot has happened while you were asleep.”Nathan felt dread building up within him. “What’s wrong? Where is she?”“Nobody really knows,” Andre said. “At least, no one has found her body.” Nathantried to struggle to his feet as the fleshmancer continued, “Your sorceressfriend is quite impulsive. She’s powerful, no arguing with that, but she wasupset because of a stray sand panther that was captured and brought to thetraining pits. So she challenged Sovrena Thora for the leadership of Ildakar.”Andre’s eyes were bright, and his smile widened. “Ah, you should have seen it!Quite the battle up in the ruling tower. First, the sovrena appointed Adessa asher champion, and the morazeth battered Nicci to within an inch of her life.Then the sovrena—in an example of poor sportsmanship, I must admit—used her ownmagic to blast Nicci out the high windows, and she plummeted down into the citybelow.” He clucked his tongue again. “We keep expecting someone to discover herbroken corpse any day now.”Nathan collapsed back onto the table. “Nicci … is dead?”“Undoubtedly. But, oh, it was quite the fight!”Blackness roared inside him again. His heart thumped more loudly as therealization set in. He could imagine Nicci gathering her indignation, vowing toface Thora on her own, challenging her for her rulership. If only Nicci hadwaited until Nathan recovered, when he could use his gift and fight at herside.…But Nicci had done it alone, considering herself invincible. She was arrogant inthat way.He closed his eyes and envisioned her beautiful face, her graceful figure, herblond hair and blue eyes. He knew Nicci’s strength and determination. He hadnever seen someone so fiercely devoted to any cause. Now Nathan’s new heart feltlike a heavy stone in his chest. Yet it kept beating—Thump, thump. Thump,thump—inexorably, powerfully, pulling together the strings of Han, restoringNathan’s gift.But he didn’t know whether or not he could use the magic. He didn’t know if hedared. He stretched out. “Let me rest,” he said, in a bitter voice.Andre chuckled. “Of course. Regain your strength. Let us hope I can present youto the wizards’ duma before the bloodworking. It’ll be soon, hmmm?”The fleshmancer flitted away, and Nathan huddled in his blankets of grief,thinking about Nicci, wondering where Bannon was … feeling the strong heart of awizard within him again.Nicci had challenged Thora by herself and she had failed. She had lost thatbattle, and she had died. But she had sacrificed herself in an effort to freethese people, as Richard Rahl intended.Nathan could do no less. He was determined to recover. He felt the growingconviction that he, too, might have to challenge the wizards of Ildakar, alone."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 65 [contents.xhtml#c_ch65]Mirrormask occasionally visited the aqueduct tunnels to rally his hidden rebels,but Nicci was impatient to accomplish something besides hiding. She feltrestless, a weapon ready to be launched.“Do you have an actual plan?” she demanded the next time the hooded man came tospeak with her. He stood there, his unreadable polished mask simply reflectingNicci’s own questions and anger. “Is there a strategy for victory?”“Why, we intend to free the people,” said Mirrormask. “We are building ourmovement and eroding the underpinnings of Ildakaran society.”“But do you have a plan?”“Of sorts.”Nicci didn’t believe him, and she feared that with the shroud back in place hemight feel he could wait years or even decades until the time was right. Thatwas not at all how Richard Rahl would have done it. Not long ago, she had helpedRichard in his defenses, fighting for the city of Aydindril when EmperorJagang’s army swept through the Midlands. She had defended Altur’Rang after thepeople rose up to overthrow the Imperial Order, and she had helped them standagainst Brother Kronos and his invasion force. When the cause was so vital, shewas a leader, not a spectator. Each battle had been a carefully coordinatedeffort against a gigantic enemy. The powerful wizards of Ildakar, not to mentionmany centuries of tradition, made the battle for this city seem just asdaunting. And she wanted to plan for victory, not just continued resistance.Moisture dripped off the sandstone walls as water flowed through the channels.She had seen no more than fifteen of his followers down in the tunnels at anyone time. Old Melba, the woman who liked to bake things and always smuggledfresh bread for the hidden rebels, had not been here in several days, but otherfurtive figures came and went, slipping in whenever they could disappear fromtheir duties, then returning to their lives when necessary. Some, like Rendell,were familiar to her, while some recruits were strangers who looked at Nicciwith awe. They all knew how she had defied Sovrena Thora, how she had battledAdessa—and how she had been flung from the high tower.Fully healed now, Nicci gathered her gift, feeling her magic as she facedMirrormask, pressing him on the issue and not mincing words. “I think you arelike a kitten, pouncing on any object that moves. If you intend to succeed, wemust coordinate our efforts. Exactly how large is your movement? Is it justthese people, who hide in the tunnels and scatter broken mirrors around thestreets at night? Or do you have countless others among the populace, who willcome when you rally them? How many rebels do you truly have?”“As many as I need,” Mirrormask said. “Word has spread throughout the city. Theyhave seen the mirror shards marking our territory, and the nobles know howwidespread the unrest is. They are afraid of us.”“Then why have they done nothing to address the grievances?” Nicci asked.Mirrormask shrugged. “We will keep increasing the pressure. It may take time.”Her frustration grew, and she could see that she was going to have to take amore active role. “I want to set the wheels in motion, even if I have to do itmyself. We must act with a purpose, Mirrormask. I’ll go out there myself andlead them.”“Everyone will recognize you,” he warned.“Dear spirits, maybe they should! It will make the sovrena and the wizardcommander fear me.”“Are you prepared to fight all the duma members? The gifted nobles, as well asthe city guard and the ranks of the morazeth?”Nicci lifted her chin in defiance and determination. “Yes. If need be.”Behind his reflective mask, he let out a low laugh. “Then I will hand your ownadvice back to you. You need a plan, Sorceress. You need a strategy.”Nicci was unsure of how many days had passed since she’d been rescued by therebels. She had needed time to heal and regain her strength, but she felt strongand ready now. Had Nathan recovered in the fleshmancer’s studio? Did her friendpossess the gift again, now that he had the new heart of a wizard? If so, Nathanwould be a powerful ally. She didn’t know what had happened to Bannon. He had nomagic, but was certainly a decent fighter with his sword.Nicci was determined that together they could overthrow the wizards of Ildakar,but she didn’t truly believe she would have to fight them all. She suspectedthat some—Elsa, possibly Damon, possibly Quentin—would welcome the change. EvenMaxim said he wanted to see his wife defeated.She was also determined to free Mrra. For two nights, her dreams had been aswirlwith the sand panther’s pent-up fury. Caught alone, in a cage pacing back andforth, poked and prodded, starved. And even when Mrra fed, the captivity itselfmade her vomit up the food. Perhaps it was poisoned, the apprentice handlerspunishing her for her intractability. Nicci didn’t know. Her connection wasn’tclear enough. She wanted to go to the pens of the combat animals and tear thebars apart, using her gift to uproot the hinges and peel the iron away so thesand panther could bound free and attack the cruel handlers.“We have to move soon, before the wizards take irrevocable action,” Nicci said.And before she herself went mad with impatience.“The duma members always take irrevocable actions,” Mirrormask said; then hepaused. “But if you have an idea of how we should proceed, I would be pleased tohear it. What do you propose?”“When I challenged Sovrena Thora, I learned that she can spy anywhere in thecity. All those reflecting basins are connected by a scrying spell. That is howshe eavesdropped on my private conversations with Nathan Rahl and when you and Imet for the first time. She can spy on the rebel movement through any one ofthem, if she wishes.”Some of the people in the tunnels muttered uneasily.“That’s why my followers hide their faces any time they do work for our cause,”Mirrormask said. “I planned ahead for that.”Rendell mumbled, “But those basins are everywhere in the city—in the mainsquares, in the boulevards, on civic buildings. We’ve placed our mirror shardsnear many of them. She must have been watching!”Nicci made up her mind, knowing something specific she could do. “We go outtonight. Instead of just leaving little reflective marks of your presence, let’sdestroy those basins. That way we’ll blind Thora.”The rebels nodded, sounding hopeful. They viewed Nicci with a new respect, andshe felt pleased to have something specific to do.“An excellent suggestion!” Mirrormask said. “We will spread the word among therebels. My followers could destroy those scrying basins in street after streetthroughout the city.”“Those basins were meant to be a service to the poor people,” Rendell pointedout, his normally quiet voice now holding a ragged edge of anger. “Fresh waterdirect from the aqueducts for everyone. The sovrena was using them to spy on usall.”Mirrormask brushed at the sleeve of his gray robe, reached up to adjust theplate that covered his face. For a moment Nicci thought he might remove the maskand reveal himself, and then she could see the ghastly malformations somefleshmancer had inflicted upon him. But he withdrew his hand and turned away. “Ilike the way you think, Sorceress. Tonight we go forth and blind the sovrena,then return here and we can plan our next move.”Nicci did not appreciate the compliment, nor did she point out that it was a jobhe should have been doing all along. “After that, our next move must be to freemy sand panther. That is my priority.”Rendell was clearly alarmed. “And let the beast rampage through the streets? Thecity guards will kill her if she is loose.”“Mrra must be free,” Nicci insisted. “I can control her. I can hide her.”Mirrormask held up a hand. “One step at a time, my followers. For now, let ussmash the reflecting basins. That will give us a measurable victory tonight.”* * *After full dark, Nicci emerged from the tunnels with ten of the hooded rebels.Rendell accompanied her, while Mirrormask departed down one of the streetsalone. Other followers spread out to seek the innocuous-looking basins.Ildakar was dark and silent. Stars sparkled overhead, shimmering from thedistortion of the shroud that now encapsulated the city. A faint sliver of moonshaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife hung low to the horizon, barelyvisible between the buildings.This was the first time Nicci had been outside in days, and she paused to take along breath, drawing energy from the cool darkness, but her thoughts weren’twith the stars or the fresh air. Nicci devoted her full attention to their workhere in the city.She and Rendell kept to the shadows, darting between buildings, avoiding the dimglows of light that seeped through shuttered windows. She heard lowconversations, smelled savory curls of smoke from cooking hearths. Some of thewindows were open in the night air, and people sat silhouetted on windowsills,taking in the fresh air. Nicci and Rendell moved silently. She was sure somepeople spotted them, but they raised no alarm, only gave their quiet support.She thought of the times when she had faced enemies using her magic or herknives, defeating them in personal combat. She had led armies both for Jagangand against him. “I don’t like this skulking around,” she muttered to Rendell asthey paused at the mouth of an alley that led out into a gathering square. “Iprefer to face my opponent directly.”“We will have a stand-up fight soon enough,” Rendell said. “The sovrena and thewizard commander are planning another massive bloodworking. Hundreds of slavesare being rounded up for a great sacrifice at the pyramid.” His voice was weary,weighted down with misery. “This one is designed to make the shroud permanent.”Nicci blinked in alarm. “Then we will never get out, and neither will thesacrificial slaves. We have to act before that happens!”“We have already been trapped here forever. But we will keep fighting, shroud orno shroud.”Nicci hissed, “Dear spirits, we don’t have much time. When is this supposed totake place?”“Tomorrow night. The city guards are preparing. The morazeth have been bringingthe slaves into great pens.”She considered how to encourage, or even coerce, Mirrormask to call hisfollowers and act now. She herself might have to take charge.But first things first. “For now, let us remove one of the sovrena’s weapons.She won’t spy on us anymore.” She strode across the square into the openstarlight, making no effort to hide herself.On the opposite wall hung one of the reflecting basins, chest high and holding astill pool of water. Rendell remained in the shadows, calling out in a hoarsewhisper, “If that is a scrying pool, you’ll be seen!”“I intend to be seen.” Nicci marched boldly to the wall. Her black dress wasswallowed in the night, but her blond hair and pale skin made her identityobvious to any observer. She stepped up to the hemispherical reflecting pool andlooked down into the calm, still surface, like a mirror.She stared at her reflection. “Are you watching me, Sovrena?” Her clear blueeyes gazed back at her, but Nicci imagined that they were Thora’s eyes. “I amhere. I am alive. And I mean to destroy you.” She lowered her face until it wasonly inches above the water. “But you’ll never know when I come for you.”She released her gift with cracking force, shattering the curved stone basin, sothat the shards crashed to the flagstones, spilling the water. A continuing flowleaked from a pipe inside the wall, a trickle from the aqueducts.She turned to Rendell. “The rest of the rebels are doing the same. Come help mefind more of the basins. We will gouge out the sovrena’s magical eyes.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 66 [contents.xhtml#c_ch66]The D’Haran army rode out of the mountains into the broad green valley that hadonce been the Scar. Sitting astride her horse, Prelate Verna looked ahead,scanning the landscape. After days of riding, she had named her horse Dusty, anendearing as well as descriptive term; Richard had taught her to name, andrespect, her horse.“Do you think we are almost to Cliffwall?” asked Sister Amber. Her eyes weresparkling. “I never knew the world was so vast.”“You still have seen only the tiniest portion of it, child.” Verna was surprisedby the ever-widening vistas. What if even the sweeping D’Haran Empire was just asmall country in a continent of inconceivable size?The young novice looked amazed, then briefly skeptical, but she gave a solemnnod. “I would never doubt you, Prelate.”Oliver and Peretta, riding together on the same horse, gazed ahead of them. “Wehave to go around the valley to the north, then up into the high desert to findCliffwall.” Oliver squinted, but could not seem to make out the details.Peretta added, “We camped exactly eight times from Cliffwall to this point. Butriding on horseback is much faster.”General Zimmer held the reins of his black destrier and glanced back at the twoyoung scholars. “That means we should be only days away.”They followed a blurred trail, portions of which had once been a road, but muchhad weathered and washed away. The horses followed the gentle geography wherestreams had cut down to the valley.“It looks like a beautiful place,” Verna said. “Wild and pristine.”“The Lifedrinker’s mark is almost entirely erased,” Peretta said. “Look at themeadows, the new forests, the rivers and lakes. The valley is alive again.”“I would not thank Victoria for what she did,” Oliver said.As they rode into the twilight, they saw a sparkle of lights ahead, dozens ofsmall fires. Worried that it might be an army encamped in the valley, GeneralZimmer dispatched scouts to investigate, and they rode back in the dark to saythat the fires were the camps of settlers, people who had moved in and begun tobuild new homes and farms.Rather than approaching the settlement, the general ordered that they bed downfor the night where they were. He scratched the rough stubble on his cheek.“We’d terrify those poor people if a hundred armored riders arrived after dark.Let us wait until morning so we can come in as visitors, rather than invaders.”After giving Dusty a withered apple for a treat, Verna lay on her blanket,listening to the night birds and insects. The Sisters of the Light camped closetogether, spreading out their bedrolls. They talked excitedly, knowing theirdestination was at hand. The soldiers played games and sang songs, relaxed withthe comfortable routine of travel. Many remarked that they liked the landscapeof the Old World, and although they missed lovers, wives, and children from backhome, they certainly preferred this duty to marching off to war and battlinghordes of cannibalistic undead. Verna drifted off to sleep, listening as a youngsoldier played a stringed instrument and sang a quiet tune about a girl he hadleft behind in Anderith.The next morning, the group rode to the new village. Ten families had stakedtheir claim beside a wide stream. When the settlers saw the contingent of ridersapproach, they stood together warily. Verna realized these people must havesuffered much over the years and had learned to fear strangers, but GeneralZimmer introduced himself and insisted that they came in peace.“This valley is fertile again,” said a bearded man in mud-streaked clothes. Hehad fastened a makeshift plow to the settlement’s lone ox, and now stood besidethe big animal. The villagers had cleared and tilled several acres of the land.Woodcutters had chopped down trees and worked them into logs for construction.“For a long time, nobody could live here, but now this ground is perfect forcrops. And untouched.”A thin woman with large eyes and prematurely gray hair came forward to greetGeneral Zimmer and Prelate Verna. She gestured to the largest building they hadconstructed. “That one will be a schoolhouse. Once this settlement isestablished, more people will come down from the mountains to join us.”“Many were driven out as the Lifedrinker’s Scar grew and grew,” said the firstfarmer. “But this valley is our ancestral home. It was ours long ago.”“And the valley is yours again,” said General Zimmer. “We come with the newsthat the Imperial Order has faded, Emperor Jagang is dead, and Lord Rahl nowwants you to be free to determine your own lives, without tyranny oroppression.”More people came close, including three children, all covered with mud becausethey had been helping plant seeds in the new furrows. They all smiled at thesoldiers.“We are just riding through, finding our way to Cliffwall,” Verna said. “Youhave nothing to fear from us.”“Cliffwall?” asked the first farmer. “I’ve heard of it. It’s far away and hiddenin the canyons.” He gestured toward the high plateau in the north.“We know exactly where we’re going,” Peretta said.Without tarrying, the group rode onward, anxious to cover many miles. Over thenext two days they encountered several other new settlements, before theexpedition turned north, heading up into the high desert. Oliver and Perettatook the lead as the rocky terrain grew more complex, but even though thescholars remembered their previous path, they had traveled on foot, and theirroute was not appropriate for horses or so many men. Scouts had to range fartherto divert around slot canyons or steep drop-offs. The canyonlands werebeautiful, but they were a maze.They pressed forward, and Verna heard some of the soldiers grumbling that theywere lost. Many of the arroyos were dry, and the horses needed more water. Thetwo young scholars, though, were not deterred. After following gravel-bottomedwashes into towering red canyons, Oliver and Peretta’s horse led them into anarrowing canyon that seemed blocked off with a dead end.“Here we are,” Oliver said, shading his eyes. Sitting just in front of him,Peretta beamed.“There’s nothing but rock,” said General Zimmer.Peretta flashed a smile at him. “You see why it’s such a good hiding place?”The scholar guides dismounted and walked their horse forward. “You might notwant to ride through. It’s pretty narrow,” Oliver said.They approached the stone wall and walked directly into a shadow, turned left,and disappeared. Two scouts followed the Cliffwall scholars, and shouted anall-clear.Verna realized it was a fold in the rock, a narrow passageway that remainedhidden until she came directly up to it. She dismounted, leading Dusty by thehalter, with General Zimmer and his destrier just ahead of her. The cool rockpressed against her as the walls closed in. The shadows were thick, because nosunlight penetrated into this narrow passageway, but after no more than tensteps, she and her horse emerged into a marvelous canyon, a separate worldhidden from the outside.Streams cut fingerlike canyons in the slickrock, leaving a lush green valley.Numerous fruit trees lined the central stream, with herds of sheep grazing onthe thick grass. Terraced gardens used every scrap of fertile land for vegetableplots layered up along the cliffs. The rock walls rose high on either side ofthe canyon, studded with natural alcoves in which adobe buildings were nestled.Shouts rang throughout the canyon as the people noticed the stream of horses andsoldiers entering through the hidden crack.“There!” Oliver pointed to the other side of the canyon.Verna looked up to the wall on her right, to see a large grotto overhang thatheld enormous buildings, stone towers, and immense façades. A narrow pathzigzagged up the side of the cliff to reach the imposing structures. Vernagasped. “Cliffwall?”Oliver and Peretta nodded. “We’re back home.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 67 [contents.xhtml#c_ch67]Water spilled across the polished blue marble tiles in the ruling chamber,pouring away from the jagged fragments of the smashed pitcher. In anger, Thorastrode down the steps from the dais and bent over to peer into the spreadingpool. The reflective surface showed nothing but the early-morning light thatcame in through the windows. “All of my scrying pools are ruined throughout thecity!”Maxim chortled, lounging back in his seat, crossing his black-clad legs. “Whatdid you expect, my darling wife? You felt compelled to show off your secret infront of everyone. You revealed to the duma members that you’ve been spying onthem, just as you spied on Nicci and the wizard Nathan.”“He is no wizard,” she snarled. “He has no gift.”“Maybe, maybe not. Andre reported that he’s awake and recovering, and he doesindeed show some aptitude for magic.”“Andre never likes to admit failure.” Thora stared down at the pool, whichshowed her nothing.Maxim rested his head against the raised back of his ornate chair. “Once theduma members knew about your scrying pools, word was bound to get out. Slavescould have overheard, even guards and citizens, and from there the informationwas passed to Mirrormask.” He flicked his forefinger back and forth like anaccusing metronome. “You really should have expected that.”“I expected our duma members to be loyal.”The wizard commander toyed with his dark goatee. “Loyalty is earned, my dear,not commanded.” Back in their own homes, the duma members had drained theirpools and fountains, just to cut her off.Thora narrowed her sea-green eyes. Her thoughts spun, and her anger grew hotterinside her mind. “And have I not earned their loyalty, after fifteen centuriesof perfect rule? Have I not given them peace and protection?”“Why, of course. If only everyone else saw it that way. Like our slaves.”The sovrena was annoyed at her husband and annoyed at the turn of events. Duringthe hours of darkness, Mirrormask and his rebels had spread through the streetsin a coordinated effort to smash the public scrying basins, blinding her magicaleyes across the city.But she was most furious with one of the last images projected from a scryingpool the moment before it was destroyed. She had seen Nicci’s face, her fulllips curved down in vengeful anger as she stared into the reflective water,mocking. Nicci took malicious delight in revealing that she had survived boththe attack and the long fall from the tower.“One does not need to blame the loose tongues of our duma members,” Maximcontinued. “Since you let Nicci survive, she could have told them all.”Thora knew he was right. “It will all be over tonight. The sacrificial slavesare rounded up in their pens. At midnight when the star threads and alignmentsare at their peak, we will ascend the pyramid and undertake the greatestbloodworking since we defeated General Utros. The shroud will then bepermanent … and we can take our time to smother this unrest.”Because of the important upcoming ritual, the other wizards would spend the daypreparing, making sure they were ready for such an expenditure of magic. Giftedworkers had gone to the top of the stepped pyramid to make certain all the partsof the apparatus were in perfect alignment for the grand sacrifice.“I think your own decisions have trapped you,” Maxim said. “Even knowing youwon’t listen, I still have to disagree. A permanent shroud will cut off alloutside trade, and that won’t solve our problems, but simply create a biggercage. You’re like one of those larks caught in a net and unable to break free.”The comparison annoyed Thora, but her husband had annoyed her for centuries. Hewas good at it.With an extravagant yawn, Maxim rose from his chair and sloshed straight throughthe puddle, not caring. He headed out of the ruling chamber.“Where are you going?” she demanded.“I am the wizard commander. I have work to do—as do you,” he said. “With all ofthe imminent blood magic, maybe you should pay attention to yourresponsibilities, instead of brooding over a sorceress that you couldn’tdefeat.”Anger flashed in Thora’s eyes. She drew in a quick, cold breath, but her husbandstrolled out of the chamber, leaving wet footprints. He called over hisshoulder, “Since you have nothing else to do, why don’t you call some slaves andclean up that mess?”* * *Nicci’s dreams were unsettled and filled with feline energy. Through the spellbond, her vision drifted through to Mrra’s predatory mind, her restless spirit.So many times Nicci had dream-hunted with her sister panther, roaming freeacross the plains, feeling hot adrenaline as she ran a bleating antelope toground and tore out its throat.Now Mrra could only pace inside a confined lair, caged and tormented as hertroka had been for so many years. Sullen, she was forced to eat food she had notkilled, offal from the yaxen slaughterhouse or hunks of human flesh fed to herby the new handlers. Mrra had tasted human meat before, and in her memory,dreaming, Nicci tasted it as well. Chief Handler Ivan had used chopped-upvictims to whet the appetites of his animals, making sure they would kill theiropponents in the arena. For Mrra, any dead meat was just a victim; it wasnourishment. Mrra remembered the pain the burly chief handler had inflicted onher, how these new apprentice handlers attempted to do the same, but they wereweaker than Ivan. Nicci could detect scorn in her feline thoughts. When the bigcat defied them, the handlers were incensed, and worried.Nicci drifted in sleep on her pallet in the aqueduct tunnels, looking throughher cat’s eyes. The slatted bars in her lair formed shadows, and she delveddeeper, remembering the panther’s recent experiences. She was shocked by a surgeof recognition, another familiar human! The young man with long ginger hair anda sword. Mrra knew his smell, his demeanor, his voice—and Nicci knew it, too.Bannon!The young man had disappeared days ago, and now she saw that Bannon had beencaptured and held in the fighter training pits. No wonder Nicci hadn’t been ableto find him.She was sure his faithless friend Amos lay behind it. Mrra had been pittedagainst Bannon in one of the fighting pits, where the two were expected tobattle each other, to maim and kill. The two had circled while spectatorswatched, and even though the handlers used their gift to coerce the panther,Mrra had refused. The big cat knew Bannon. He was part of her hunting unit withNicci, with Nathan. Bannon had also refused to fight, and their defianceoutraged the observers.With a surge of anger, Nicci forced herself to remain connected through thespell bond, gleaning more information from the panther’s memories. Mrra knewevery turn of the tunnels, every cage and every rock-walled pen. She knew thewarrior cells as well. She knew the fighting areas.Nicci drew upon that now, seeing that many of the combat animals remainedrestless in their cages: several swamp dragons, two armored bulls, ten ravenousspiny wolves, and three wild speckled boars with large tusks. The animals gaveoff the scent of fury, hunger, and murder. They would wreak havoc if they wereturned loose.Nicci also saw where Bannon was imprisoned, and when she had a clear picture inher mind of the layout of all those cells, she forced herself back towakefulness, reluctantly severing the close bond with her sister panther. Shedrew in a deep breath and sat up in the dim, moist aqueduct tunnels. Though theinformation she had obtained was deeply disturbing, she let herself smile. Aplan began to form in her mind.…Mirrormask arrived late in the morning, and dozens of uneasy followers came tomeet with him and hear his words. “Tonight will be our great opportunity. Theduma members intend to commit a gigantic slaughter to work their blood magic.Three hundred slaves, three hundred victims—victims like you.”His followers grumbled. Many of them looked disgusted. A woman with a wan faceand dry skin reached up to brush a tear from the corner of her eye. Next to her,Rendell reached out to take her hand, his gaze flinty with determination. Thebread baker, Melba, still wasn’t among them.“That means we must do something,” Nicci interrupted. “This is our chance. Theplans we considered in the past, the ideas we discussed—it is time. With thisconcerted effort, we can uproot the noxious weeds that grow in Ildakar.”Mirrormask turned his reflective visage toward her. He seemed interested, notoffended that she would take charge. “And what do you suggest, Sorceress?”“I challenged the sovrena before, and I failed. I should not have done it alone.Now, we act together. We must free the captive slaves marked for slaughter. Wemust reach the top level of the city, swarm the steps of the pyramid, anddestroy the apparatus to prevent the bloodworking. If we wreck the projectiontower, we will bring down the shroud forever.”“Ah,” Mirrormask said, “then many of us can escape the city and flee into thecountryside.”“Fleeing will not be sufficient,” Nicci said. “We have to free the city.” Shewould help oust the oppressive masters who believed that bloodshed and slaverymade a utopia.And then, after she found Nathan and Bannon, after she released Mrra, they wouldall depart. Enough of Ildakar! She had too much work to do, too many otherplaces to bring into the fold of the D’Haran Empire. Richard had given her thisquest.And the Sorceress shall save the world.…Nicci would not leave until her work was done. “First, as night falls, we willgo into the arena cages and free my panther. We’ll turn the other animalsloose—not just to cause mayhem this time, as you did the other night, but aspart of an effort to disrupt the city before the bloodworking can take place atmidnight. We will release my friend Bannon from the training pits. He and hissword will help us greatly.” She rolled her shoulders, felt her muscles loosenup. “The rest of the warriors are slaves, and we need fighters. They kill oneanother to entertain the nobles—do you doubt they would fight just as hard fortheir freedom?”The rebels muttered among themselves, their words low.Mirrormask lifted his reflective face, which glinted with the light from thewall torches. “Many of the warriors fight for the love of fighting, but perhapswe can give them a better opponent.” He raised the arms of his billowing grayrobe, signaling to the gathered rebels. “Very well, Sorceress, I agree with yourplan. We’ll spread the word among our many followers, and they will be ready totake action.” He turned slowly, addressing the crowd. “This is what we wanted.If we succeed, Ildakar will be yours!”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 68 [contents.xhtml#c_ch68]Fleshmancer Andre pushed Nathan to try harder, provoked him, and the formerprophet grumbled in frustration, “You are more sadistic than the Sisters of theLight. They locked me up so my dangerous prophecies could not cause damage.”Nathan sniffed and ran his fingers through his long white hair, which very muchneeded a wash. “But that, of course, is what prophecy does. For all theireducation, the Sisters deluded themselves.”“We are not trying to restore your gift of prophecy, hmmm?” Andre said. “Becauseprophecy has gone away, and so the effort would be pointless. We discovered thateven here. The stars are different overhead, and it has nothing to do with ourprotective shroud.”“I’ve already explained the reasons why,” Nathan said. “Richard caused the starshift, sealed the veil, and changed the rules.”“You have indeed told us interesting stories, but such things don’t matter herein Ildakar.” The fleshmancer paced around the laboratory studio, with its oddsmells of chemicals and blood. “Thanks to the distortion of the shroud, we havealways operated under our own rules.”The indigo hangings blocked off the light from the open windows, but Nathan hadpulled one down to let the bright sunshine pour in, making the dank chamberwarmer and brighter than it had been in years.Nathan was regaining his strength. The previous day, upon awakening for thesecond time, he had consumed an entire bowl of broth, and this morning he hadeaten eggs, vegetables, and pastries. Once his hunger was triggered, he becameravenous, and Andre could barely keep up with feeding him, rushing the householdslaves back to the kitchens for tray after tray.Nathan was also restless and unsettled. He’d spent far too long in this stuffyroom, and he wanted to get outside—not because he longed to see Ildakar, but tofind young Bannon. He also vowed to learn more about Nicci’s death, althoughAndre had described her final combat against the morazeth and the sovrena. EvenNicci could not have survived a fall like that.He swallowed a lump in his throat. Andre seemed to notice his gloom. “There,there, just try harder, Nathan. You’ll find your gift soon enough. We certainlyknow that Ivan had the power within him, hmmm?”“I will try.” Nathan rubbed the palm of his hand across the stubble growing onhis neck. Not only did he need to wash his hair; he also wanted a shave. “Atleast you aren’t making me wear an iron collar.”Andre blinked at him. “Why would I ever do that?”Nathan moved aside the plates, bowls, and cups from his third meal of the day,though it was just past noon. “Someday, I will have you ask the Sisters.”The room smelled of harsh cleaning chemicals that barely covered the lingeringundertone of urine spilled by terrified subjects in the laboratory room.Chemical urns rested on shelves, sealed cylinders marked with preservationsymbols. Nathan couldn’t guess what strange things they might contain. The largefanged fish with jagged fins and multiple eyes swam in an endless loop in themurky water of its tank.Nathan extended his hands, stared at the lines in his palm, the life lines.… Heremembered how the witch woman Red had slashed his hand, drawing blood so shecould create ink for his life book. Red claimed that the whorls and lines in aperson’s palm were a unique spell-form. He focused his azure gaze, intentlytracing the patterns, imagining that they were a reflection of the lines of Hanthroughout his body. He felt, or imagined, a tingle. He recognized the hint ofmagic, the gift reawakening within him.Thump, thump.Thump, thump.He touched his chest, felt the beating there, heard the drumbeat of his newlife.“Remember that you have the heart of a wizard now,” Andre said. “Use it!”“And how is the patient doing?” a woman’s voice called.Nathan was glad for the interruption, but when he turned, he felt the tingle ofmagic fade. Elsa strode in, wearing dark purple robes embroidered withunreadable symbols in golden thread.Nathan smiled at the attractive older woman. “Recovering.” He inhaled deeply.“The air still flows into my lungs. I’m alive—that’s something.”Andre interrupted, “He has a strong new heart. Chief Handler Ivan beats withinhim, and dear Nathan will have his gift restored. He is still searching for it,though.”“I’ve just gotten my appetite back.” Nathan glanced at the clutter of emptydishes, then lowered his voice and turned away. “I also learned that my dearcompanion Nicci was murdered by the sovrena, which is enough to make me ill.”Elsa’s eyes were downcast. “It was a terrible thing, and several duma members,including me, believe that Thora cheated. She named Adessa as her champion, butwhen the morazeth didn’t kill Nicci quickly enough, the sovrena used her magic.”She shook her head. “That is not how a challenge should be given or completed.”Andre made a rude noise as he tapped the glass wall of the tank, startling thefearsome-looking fish in the murky water. “It was like the combat arena, onlydone with magic. One doesn’t split hairs about the fine points of protocol in ablood combat. What’s done is done.”“Even so,” Elsa said, “I don’t like the idea that the sovrena used her scryingmagic to spy on people. She could have been watching any of us, through anybasin.”“But what do you have to fear, hmmm? Sovrena Thora is merely insuring thesecurity of our city.”Elsa scoffed. “In my household, I will insure my own security, thank you. I havedrained all of my reflective basins and fountains—and I suggest you do the same.Unless you want her to watch your efforts to awaken Nathan’s gift.”The fleshmancer grinned. “Then she could see how hard we are working. Currently,my primary interest is to make certain that Nathan once again becomes the wizardNathan.”“And that’s my priority as well.” Nathan sat resting on the edge of the tablethat had held him in recovery for so long. He wore a loose, unmarked white robe.He decided he needed to find his trousers, laced boots, ruffled shirt, andcape—and his sword, the lovely ornate sword that had served him so well. Hehoped his blade was still where he had left it in the grand villa, but he wasn’tgoing to be doing any fighting soon. He still felt too weak.“I come to offer my assistance,” Elsa said, stepping close to the table. “I canhelp train you, but more importantly, give you a bit of energy with mytransference magic.” She looked at him with her light brown eyes, and hercrow’s-feet crinkled as she smiled. It was a pretty smile, he realized.“And how would that work?” Nathan asked, far more interested in her than in thefleshmancer’s gruff suggestions for exercises.“The gift is also a great responsibility,” Elsa said. “You might have it, butyou must know how to use it. Inside you, the Han is like a fast-flowing stream.It has been dammed up and now needs to be released.”“If only I knew how to do so, my dear.” He wished he’d been able to wash andcomb his hair, to shave and put on clean—preferably more elegant—clothes. Hefelt awkward speaking with Elsa in his condition.“Let me attempt a little something that might help,” she said. “I think you’retrying too hard. Fear of failure makes you uncertain. Uncertainty makes youweak. Watch.” She extended a finger and touched her chest, just above hercleavage, part of which was exposed by the open purple robe. She traced herfinger in a circular motion, then drew loops marking an invisible symbol, apattern that only she could see, although Nathan tried to follow the tracings.Andre stood back, interested.“Now you, Nathan.” Elsa came closer and tugged open his white robe, exposing hischest. She was startled to see the long, lumpy line that looked like a thickstream of candle wax down the center of his chest.Nathan looked down, embarrassed. “The mark will surely fade in time.”“On the contrary, it will always be there as a reminder of my work.” Thefleshmancer added brightly, “Like the signature of an artist.”Elsa looked troubled, but reached forward and placed her hand against Nathan’schest, touching the scar. “I can feel your heart beating. Yes, it is strong, butis the Han as powerful? Let me give you a little of mine. Perhaps it will unlockwhat you need.”Her fingertip touched the skin above his breastbone and with swift, ticklishgestures she traced a rune on his chest, the counterpart to the one above herown heart. When she finished, she tapped her fingertip there and stepped back.Nathan experienced a sudden tingling warmth inside, as if he had just downed agoblet of fine Aydindril brandy. “I can feel something.”“I think Elsa is flirting with you,” Andre chuckled. “Perhaps you’ll be invitedto our next pleasure party after all—as her guest if nothing else.”Elsa flushed.Nathan just frowned. “You are ruining my concentration, Fleshmancer.”“We wouldn’t want that, would we, hmmm?” Andre scuttled across the room,rummaged among the paraphernalia on the shelves, and found a wide candle. Hecarried the candle over, set it on the table next to Nathan, and indicated thedrooping black wick. “See if you can make a spark. Use your gift to work a firespell and conjure a candle flame.”Nathan was more confident now that he felt warmth tingling through him. MaybeElsa’s transfer magic had connected the last threads of Han to his heart—his newheart. He looked at the bent wick, the hardened and misshapen wax. Nathan feltthe magic, pulled it closer.He remembered the countless times he had summoned huge balls of wizard’s fire,how he had easily ignited campfires or torches with barely a thought. He hadwalked through dark tunnels in the Palace of the Prophets, holding up a handlight that he conjured without effort.He also remembered the time aboard the deck of the Wavewalker when he had triedto show a trick to eager young Bannon. He had summoned a simple flame in thepalm of his hands … only to have it flicker and die out.He shoved those thoughts aside, not wanting his own hesitation to weaken him, asElsa had warned. He focused on the burned wick, sensed the warmth inside him,and tried to move the warmth to the candle. The gift trickled and grew.“Make the flame, Wizard,” Andre snapped. “Or must I deny you that title?”Startled, Nathan tried harder. It had been so easy to create a simple flame. Hesensed the heat, drew it out of the air, and placed it into the candle.“Ignite!” He strained through clenched teeth.He pushed, feeling a hiccup of magic within him. The candle flickered, a smallyellow spark, which then faded.“Ignite!” he shouted louder, pushing with his grasp of the magic, drawing uponthe restored gift.The candlewick still did not light.But the fish tank exploded.Nathan’s uncooperative magic had sent a lightning bolt of heat into the murkywater, flashing it into boiling steam, shattering the glass. With a gush ofwater, the flopping, smoking carcass of the hideous fish spilled onto the floor.Its needlelike fangs snapped as its jaws clacked open and closed until its eyesturned milky, and it slumped in death. Its large scales slid off its body likeunwanted coins, and the crisped skin cracked to reveal steaming, flaky meat thatfell off the curved bones.Nathan lurched back, astonished at what he had done. “Dear spirits!”“You have the gift back!” Andre cried.“But it’s still uncontrolled.” Nathan felt sick dread build up within him. Heremembered the man he had tried to heal in Renda Bay; his efforts had onlyresulted in a mangled corpse. “The magic is wild and dangerous.”“But it’s there,” Elsa said.Andre stepped over to his shattered fish tank, frowned down at the remnants ofthe scaly thing he had created. “And it looks like you’ve prepared a late lunchfor us, Wizard.” He smiled. “Yes, I shall call you wizard, at leastprovisionally.”Nathan shuddered, clasping his hands together. He imagined the consequences ofgreater workings, if his magic ricocheted and went wrong. “I was just trying tocreate a tiny candle flame, and look what happened.”“Indeed!” Andre sounded delighted. “It looks as if Chief Handler Ivan gave you agreat deal of power.” He shouted for slaves to come clean up the mess.Elsa patted Nathan’s hand. “It’s a step in the right direction.”“Or the wrong direction,” Nathan said.“If only you had gotten better sooner,” said the fleshmancer, looking up atthem. “Tonight is the great bloodworking with three hundred slaves. Once wereinforce the shroud, we’ll never have to worry about the outside world again.”Elsa looked away, disturbed.Andre narrowed his muddy eyes and leaned closer, speaking with an undertone ofthreat. “You’d better hope you get your gift back, Nathan, since that is theonly way you will remain among the noble class in Ildakar.”Then he backed away, grinning again. “But you’ve demonstrated the potential, andI know the quality of my work, hmmm? If that doesn’t happen, we can try otherapproaches. Have no fear—no matter how long it takes, we will have plenty oftime to experiment on you.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 69 [contents.xhtml#c_ch69]The sun set on Ildakar with a flourish of crimson clouds, as if in anticipationof the imminent bloodworking. The people in the city were anxious—some nervous,some eager, some resigned.Nicci had no intention of allowing the slaughter to happen. She would not letall those people be killed or let herself be trapped under a shroud of eternity.It was time to act.As darkness gathered in the streets, lights glimmered in homes and inns, candleflames, oil lamps, or magical glows from gifted proprietors. Like nocturnalpredators slipping out of shadowy hiding places, Mirrormask’s rebels began tomove out into the city.Nicci emerged with them, her golden hair brushed out so that it was long andflowing. Her black dress clung to her, the skirts swirling around her legs likea pool of ink as she emerged from the sandstone tunnel entrance. “I don’t needto hide anymore,” she said. “I want Sovrena Thora and all of Ildakar to know whobrings their downfall.”“We do,” said Mirrormask, striding along beside her. The reflective platecovering his face was polished to a high luster. His gray robes flowed aroundhim like fog as he walked with Nicci to their rendezvous. He had ralliedhundreds of his followers, telling them to meet in a dark and dusty grainwarehouse—ironically, the same warehouse where Mrra had been captured.Nicci knew it was no coincidence. Mirrormask had done that for her.The rebels wore brown robes with hoods to hide their faces. Around their necks,each of them wore a thin wooden disk engraved with an incineration rune. If theyshould die, their bodies would be instantly immolated, so as not to reveal theiridentities and unravel the entire network. Rendell wrapped his sweaty handaround the disk, clinging to it.“You won’t need that,” Nicci reassured him. “The freedom fighters for Ildakarwill no longer disguise who they are.” She looked at the people in the dustyshadows of the grain warehouse. Lanterns hung from the rafters overhead,shedding yellow-orange light and casting severe shadows. “After tonight, youwill be proud to admit that you followed Mirrormask. If you die in the fight,your families and your friends will boast of what you have done, and they willmake sure everyone knows it.”A muttered cheer rippled among the rebels. Rendell reached up and pushed backhis brown hood, shaking loose his hair. “For tonight’s work, I don’t intend tohide who I am.”A dry-faced woman beside him did the same. With a ripple of cloth that soundedlike a stirring of wings, many more rebels pulled back their disguising hoods.“We don’t need to hide who we are.”Nicci felt the gift within her, a tingle of magic that made her hair rise withstatic. She turned to Mirrormask, and saw her reflection where his face shouldhave been. She looked hard at him, silently urging him to reveal himself as allthe others had. Among his dedicated followers, he should not be afraid to showthe appalling deformity a fleshmancer had wrought on his face.Mirrormask reached up and adjusted the mirror mask, but left it squarely on hisface. “This is who I am,” he said. His voice, though muffled, rang out so thatall could hear. “This is whom my people follow.”Rendell shouted, “Mirrormask!” The others quickly picked up the chant.“Mirrormask! Mirrormask!”Throughout the streets, people were preparing for the bloodworking ritual. Eversince Sovrena Thora and the wizards’ duma had issued their announcement, thewhole city seemed to be holding its breath in anticipation. Mirrormask’s spieshad reported that the three hundred slaves, made docile from the intoxicatingperfume of the red peaceflowers, had been herded into a large holding area nearthe central pyramid.Mirrormask seemed uncertain, even though they had spent hours that afternoonplanning in detail, deciding which moves to make, how they would begin theirstrike, and how best to achieve their victory. Nicci had discussed, then arguedstrategy with him, and finally she realized that Mirrormask enjoyed hisfollowers and enjoyed leading the rebellion, but the end goal itself was not abright flame within him. He liked to launch small uprisings, stir up the city.His followers would bravely place their mirror shards in the walls, paintdefiant words on buildings, but Nicci wondered if Mirrormask truly wanted tosucceed. Complaining about a corrupt government was one thing, but actuallyruling a city was quite a different task. Though his rebellion had slowly grownfor years, he had achieved little until Nicci and her companions arrived.That was unacceptable to Nicci. She would fight to win.She spoke up when Mirrormask seemed at a loss for words. “It ends tonight. Wordhas spread throughout the city. The slaves are whispering, even those who havenot joined us. They will know what to do when they see the uprisings in thestreets. Our army will increase a thousandfold as soon as this begins.” Sheflashed a hard smile. “The blood magic is scheduled at midnight, but full darkhas already fallen, and this is our time. Blood will be spilled tonight—and itwill not be the sacrificial slaves.”“But how will we fight against wizards?” one of the rebels asked, his voicecracking with nervousness. He was a long-faced young man with prematurelythinning hair and pockmarks on his cheeks. “We are not gifted.”“Leave that to me,” Nicci said. “I owe the sovrena a fair amount of pain.”Rendell’s steely eyes flashed as he turned to his comrades. “And if they killyou, you will die free! From the moment you fight back, you have liberatedyourself.” The drab woman next to him reached out to take his hand. Rendelllowered his voice. “Whether you survive or not is secondary.”Someone else began the chant again. “Mirrormask! Mirrormask!”Rendell added, “Nicci! Nicci!”She felt the energy of their defiance in the air. It continued to increase inintensity.“This is not a rally,” Nicci said. “This is a call to war, and I will strike thefirst blow. I’ll lead a group to the animal pits and the fighters’ cells. We’llrelease all the captives there, both man and beast, and they will help us.” Shesmiled grimly. With Mrra and Bannon at her side, Nicci would feel powerfulagain. She would do this, not just for herself and the people of Ildakar, butfor Richard Rahl and his dream of a unified world.“I will go with you,” Mirrormask said. “If this is our first battle, then weshould be together.”Nicci didn’t argue with him. She touched the hilts of two sheathed daggers ather hips; she had replaced the weapons after her battle with Adessa. “We haveeverything we need.”* * *Drawing upon the vivid memories she had seen through her dream connection, Nicciknew exactly where to find Mrra. But her map was filtered through the sandpanther’s senses, which relied as much on identifying smells and sounds as onsight. Nevertheless, she would lead her companions.“Don’t be afraid to kill,” Nicci said, making sure they all heard her. “Yourenemy certainly isn’t.”They moved furtively through the streets. Whispered word passed down the alleysand lower thoroughfares, and their numbers swelled. Speed was their friend now.Soon enough all chaos would break loose with fangs, claws, and blades.“I’ve looked forward to this for a long time,” Mirrormask said. “My people areready. Ildakar will not know what is about to hit them.”The stink assaulted Nicci’s senses even before they reached the menagerie. Shefelt a prickle in her skin, a tingle in the back of her mind, the faintintangible presence of her sister panther. Mrra could sense her, too, knew shewas coming. Nicci put on a surge of speed, forgoing all caution.Outside the dark entrance to the animal tunnels stood several large cages thatheld mangy, dispirited-looking foxes and coyotes. Jackals snarled and snapped ina third pen. These were not enhanced or trained creatures, but merely practiceprey for the more fearsome animals.Four members of the city guard saw the mob coming and took defensive stances.“Halt! You have no business here.”Nicci swept her hand to one side, releasing a hard slap of air that hurled theguards against the wall, stunning them.“It begins,” Mirrormask said, sounding immensely satisfied.Nicci pointed to the outer cages. “Loose them. Let the animals run free.”Behind her, the rebels worked the latches, and the coyotes knocked theirrescuers aside as they sprang free, darting down alleys. The jackals barked andgrowled, frantic to get away.Two more guards came running, their scaled armor clattering as they drew theirshort swords. The rebels ducked to one side as the jackals sprang free, and thebeasts fell upon the oncoming guards. One man sprawled face-first on thecobblestones while the jackals tore into him, shredding the armor on his back.The other guard fled, yelling for assistance.Nicci paid no attention to what was happening in the streets. She pushed intothe widened tunnel that smelled of musk and wet fur, blood and excrement. “Openthe cages,” she called. “Release them all, and not just a few this time. We mustsend a stampede through the streets to disrupt the bloodworking.”Letting her comrades do the work, she passed cages and stone alcoves, artificiallairs for predatory beasts. She knew where she had to go. Mrra called to herthrough the silent thrumming of her spell bond.The tunnels were a maze, but Nicci remembered what the panther had seen andsmelled. Workers in the pits responded to the shouts and roars, and when theysaw the brown-robed rebels, they ran away instead of remaining to defend theanimals. Some of the slave workers even helped, throwing the bolts and pullingopen barred gates.From a side passage, where Nicci knew the apprentice handlers lived and slept,came the three who had replaced Ivan—the ones who had helped capture Mrra.Dorbo, the angry lantern-jawed man, stalked out, his hands clenched into fists.“By the Keeper, what do you think you’re doing?”When Dorbo recognized Mirrormask, his mouth dropped open. The rebel leader said,“Why, we are throwing Ildakar into turmoil. It’s a shame you won’t see it.”The rebels flung open cages and ran away as the animals burst out: emaciated anddesperate spiny wolves, snapping swamp dragons, and blood-maddened boars. From alarge pen two hooded figures loosed a gigantic scaly bull with two sets ofprominent horns. The creature charged through the tunnels, bellowing. Itsenhanced hooves clattered sparks from the floor.Dorbo and his two companions stood in the way with raised hands, using theirgift to deflect the stampeding monster, but the huge bull charged forward, drawntoward the handlers rather than shying away. The beast ran harder and faster.Mirrormask ducked against the side wall as the bull thundered past. One of theapprentice handlers shrank away and fled, while tall Dorbo and his companiondesperately worked their magic, trying to bring the monster under control. Butit was too late.At the last moment, Dorbo turned to escape, but the bull gored him, impaling himon all four thick horns. The senior apprentice vomited blood as his eyes bulged.He flailed, clutched at the ivory spear points that had sprouted from his chest.The second handler went down, smashed under the onslaught, and the bull keptcharging with Dorbo’s body dangling from its horns. The third apprentice wastrampled under the steel-hard hooves, crushed into a broken horror of blood andshattered bones.Now that the handlers’ manipulative gift had vanished, the freed animalsrampaged with greater fury. Rebels spread through the tunnels, releasingcountless creatures, while Nicci went ahead, looking for one particular barredlair. Mirrormask followed her, nodding at the mangled bodies of the three deadapprentices. “That went well, I think.”Nicci felt a surge of relief when she saw the alcove that held her sand panther.She turned to Mirrormask. “Go find the fighter trainees and release them fromtheir cells. You’ll find weapons there as well. Tell them to fight for theirlives. This is more important than any arena combat.”“As you command, Sorceress.” A hint of sarcasm tinged his muffled words behindthe mask.“Find Bannon, and tell him I am here.”With a swirl of gray robes, Mirrormask flitted down the main tunnel to where thepassages connected with the training chambers. The shouts of responding guardsand warriors were drowned out by the cacophony of roars from liberated beasts.Nicci stepped up to Mrra’s cage. The big cat looked thin, beaten down bycaptivity and brutal training, but she recognized Nicci, her sister panther.Mrra roared in triumph. Her feline eyes blazed golden.Nicci wasted no time. She worked the latch, yanked the cold iron bars to openthe door, and Mrra launched herself out, growling and purring deep within herchest. She licked Nicci’s hand with her hot, bristly tongue. Though other freedanimals bounded past, the big cat did not want to leave Nicci’s side again.“Come, Mrra.” She sprinted down the passageway to where it opened into theperiphery of the warrior barracks. She stopped, because Mirrormask stood aheadof her with his back turned. He stretched out both arms, holding a curvedsacrificial knife in his left hand, the one with which he had killed the Norukaicaptive, Dar. He glanced at her over his shoulder. “We have a problem,Sorceress.”He faced a grim and snarling Adessa. The morazeth leader stood before him withher short sword raised. Smoldering piles of brown rags and greasy smoke, theremnants of incinerated rebels, lay on the floor on either side of Adessa. Shemust have killed them the moment they surged into the fighters’ barracks.Now she blocked Mirrormask with a hateful look in her eyes. “You are a traitor,a gadfly, a hateful annoyance.” Adessa lunged forward with the point of hersword, and Mirrormask danced out of the way. He held up his sacrificial knife,clanging its blade against hers, but he had little finesse as a fighter.“I will kill you in short order.” Adessa slashed a long cut in his gray robe,and he struck out with the knife, but the morazeth batted it away. “You seem tobe all talk. You let others do the fighting for you—because you have no skill.”Mirrormask glanced toward Nicci. “A little assistance, please, Sorceress?”“I would be happy to.” She and Mrra bounded forward.Adessa caught the rebel leader unawares when she swung with her brass-studdedgauntlet, punching Mirrormask in the stomach, and as he buckled, she drove thebutt of her short sword into his face.The round pommel struck the polished mask with a hard shattering noise thatbroke his mirror into several pieces. Crying out, he reeled backward, droppinghis ceremonial knife with a clang to the stone floor. He used both hands to holdthe broken pieces of his reflection in place. Blood poured from between thecracks.Nicci and Mrra both threw themselves upon Adessa. The big cat drove the morazethto the ground while Mirrormask, sobbing for breath, scrambled away. He held hishands against his face as he disappeared into one of the many side tunnels thatbranched out from the training grotto.Adessa fought off the sand panther, pummeling her with the hard gauntlet, andtried to stab her with the sword. The instant before the blade could pierceMrra’s vulnerable hide, Nicci lashed out with her magic. She knew she could notstrike Adessa through her protective spell runes, but she realized what sheshould have done during the combat in the ruling tower.Nicci sent a surge of incandescent heat into the hilt of Adessa’s sword, and themorazeth yelped and dropped the blade. Even so, she managed to punch the sandpanther in the throat, knocking Mrra away from her.Just as Nicci and the sand panther were poised to attack, three more morazethwomen charged in, blades drawn, ready to fight. Nicci saw no sign of Mirrormask,who had fled. No matter. She was ready to fight all of them.With a squeal and a snort from behind them in the tunnels, two speckled boarscharged into the chamber, thrashing with their tusks. One of the new morazethshrieked and spun away, but the first boar gored her, ripping her thigh all theway to her crotch. The woman collapsed, fountaining blood, and the great pigstomped on her neck with a sharp cloven hoof.Nicci and Mrra ducked into a side tunnel as the second boar thundered into thechamber, followed by three howling spiny wolves. Nicci hated to retreat, andlonged to have her real rematch against Adessa, but the other morazeth hadscattered as well, and more animals raced into the warrior barracks.As Adessa retreated and the animals continued to rampage, Mrra growled, as iflonging to join them, but Nicci placed her fingers on the panther’s well-muscledback. “We’ll have our chance. We will fight her again.”She looked forward, remembering the tunnels, knowing where they led. “First,let’s go release Bannon.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 70 [contents.xhtml#c_ch70]Blood and magic hung like a vibrant mist in the air as the night deepened. Amoscould smell it. He could sense it. He found it exhilarating, even arousing, andthe young man knew exactly what to do with his arousal.He had a few hours before the ceremonial killings at the pyramid. His mother andfather would be making their preparations along with the duma, but the young manhad no part in that, nor did his friends. Someday, Amos supposed, he wouldbecome a member of the council, if any of the other wizards ever died. Hedoubted they would retire.But he was not overly eager. He had everything he wanted and noresponsibilities. For tonight, he would merely be an avid spectator, watchingthe cascades of blood spout from hundreds of slashed throats. He hoped he couldbe close enough to smell the moist iron in the air. He licked his lips inanticipation.While he wouldn’t mind having the shroud drop at occasional times, so he and hisfriends could go out and vandalize the stone soldiers, he knew they would findother amusements even if the protective bubble remained permanently in place. Nodoubt there would be more entertaining battles in the combat arena. His lipsquirked in a smile. Soon, according to the morazeth trainers, the bumpkin Bannonwould be ready to die in the arena. Amos looked forward to watching what thecabbage farmer might do.“That will be a thing to see,” he said aloud.Beneath him, Melody whimpered.He slapped her again for good measure, and she bit back another outcry of pain.The bitch simply wouldn’t learn. “If you stop making noises, I’ll stop hittingyou. You’re so stupid.”Melody whimpered again, and Amos knew it was a wasted effort to strike heragain. Then he realized that he enjoyed it, and with a sharp smack he broughthis open hand across her mouth, splitting her lip a second time. Blood dribbleddown her chin.The thick sexual arousal from the impending sacrifice had made him hungry toexpend some of that energy. Without bothering to call Jed and Brock, because hedidn’t need them dangling from him like leeches, he had gone to the dacha of thesilk yaxen and paid his coin to the surly doorman. Amos had grabbed Melody fromwhere she sat prettily next to a fumbling merchant, a chubby man Amos recognizedas a seller of glazed pots.Melody had blinked up at him, then recognized him. She drew back with fear, andAmos’s arousal increased. He grabbed her by the wrists, saw the fading bruiseson her arm, and realized that he hadn’t come here since the Norukai had visitedthis place.“She is mine tonight,” Amos said to the pottery merchant, and dragged her offthe divan. Melody barely struggled, her arms and legs flopping as she stumbledto keep up with him.The merchant sputtered and looked disappointed, but Amos was the son of thewizard commander and the sovrena, so the man found another equally beautiful andequally cooperative whore.“We need a private room,” Amos said, “a place that will muffle the sounds.”Melody had begun to whimper even before he shoved her through the doorway. Shesprawled on the bed, turning to look up at him. He closed the door and verycarefully said, “Tonight I’m going to make you scream.”Melody’s loose gossamer gown was made of pink silk, held together with loops oflace designed to be easily undone. Amos had made a point of ripping the garmentoff of her, tearing the fabric with a loud and satisfying sound. She crawledbackward, propping herself on her elbows. Amos had been hungry for the animalrelease of sex.Melody barely formed the words, “I … please you?”“You will, one way or another,” he growled as he undid his pantaloons and pulledthem off. Striding forward, he breathed hard and fast. He was extremely aroused,like a warrior with an outthrust sword ready to go into battle. And battle hedid.He pressed Melody down and pried her legs apart, grabbing the thatch of shortblond fur between them. He found no moistness there, but decided he didn’t care.She was the one who would hurt if she wasn’t ready for him.Amos thrust into her with angry passion, drawing pleasure not from the actitself, but from what it did to her. Silk yaxen were bred for this, creatureswho lived for no other purpose than to let men use them—to let Amos use her.The private room was brightly lit with many candles rather than the low romanticillumination in other chambers. Amos didn’t mind. He wanted to see what he wasdoing. Melody lay back on the bed, closed her eyes, and let him do whatever hewished. He thrust repeatedly, watched her body move, up and back.Though it was what she always did, her passivity annoyed him tonight. Amosgrabbed her throat and squeezed hard as he continued to push into her. Her eyeswidened and swelled. She clawed at his hands, straining to breathe. As shefought harder and harder, he reached his own peak of intensity and shudderedwith pleasure, releasing his hold on her throat and collapsing on top of her.Melody squirmed while Amos relaxed, enjoying the waning euphoria.But as she struggled to crawl out from under him, his anger came back and hepunched her in the face, drawing more blood. Melody squirmed off the edge of thebed and dropped to the floor. He let her go, sitting up on the fine mattress sohe could watch her pathetic movements.Melody was crying, which seemed strange because silk yaxen didn’t have thebrains or the emotions to cry. The red mark around her eye had begun to swell,which made Amos think of the bloodworking that would occur soon. Now that he hadexpended himself inside the whore, he could shift his anticipation to otherpleasures.Melody worked her way across the room to a stool before a small bureau and amirror. Pots of makeup, colorings for the eyes, rouge for the lips, sat out ondisplay. It was a place for silk yaxen to prepare themselves before each newcustomer. Candles burned on either side of a mirror, and Melody sat staring ather reflection. Tentatively she reached forward, touched a fingertip to hersplit lip, to the blood there. She smeared it across her lips, reddening them asif with rouge. When she stared at her reflection, tears filled her eyes. Shereached up to touch her swollen face, the prominent red mark that would become ablack eye. Her other hand reached her throat where Amos had nearly strangledher.He lurched off the bed, annoyed that she would give more attention to her ownreflection than to him. “I’m paying you for my time here. I’m the one who needsto look at your bruised and ugly face.” Amos snatched one of the pots of makeupand hurled it at the mirror, smashing it. Cracks spiderwebbed out from theimpact point, and silvered shards dropped out of the frame, clattering to thebureau.Melody gasped and sniffled. She picked up one of the broken shards and held itwonderingly in her hand.Amos laughed.She turned, lifted the long shard, and then, smoothly—as if she were practicing,not sure what would happen—Melody sliced the jagged glass across his throat,opening up the skin like an astonished new mouth beneath his chin.Amos blinked at her, too confused to feel the instant razor of pain. Bright redblood showered out all over Melody. He watched the spray drench her, and shegazed at him, looked down at the broken mirror, and smiled.Amos grabbed his throat. He choked and gurgled, unable to hold his wound closed.The crimson waterfall spewed through his clenched fingers, just like the bloodhe had so anticipated being spilled from the sacrificial slaves during themidnight ritual.Amos collapsed to the floor, still twitching as a lake of blood pooled aroundhim. Some ran down his naked chest, while more drained toward Melody’s barefeet. She let the warm blood touch her.She turned her interest back to the broken mirror. She picked up another shardand another, holding the broken pieces in her hands, and then she gently,experimentally, raised them to her face. She pressed the flat, silvered surfacesagainst her cheeks, trying to form a mask of her own."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 71 [contents.xhtml#c_ch71]With the roars of wild beasts and the clash of swords behind him, Mirrormaskfled. He would let Nicci do the rest here. The sorceress had the incentive, andshe certainly had the powers. He could think of more spectacular things to do.With all the combat animals turned loose, ready to kill anyone they encountered,the ruling council would have to respond, including even icy Thora. It wouldsurely disrupt their plans for the bloodworking at the pyramid. He did not wantthe shroud permanently reinforced to trap all of Ildakar under a suffocatingdome forever. Its people would be no more than fish in a bowl, swimming aroundin endless circles, going nowhere. He was sick of Ildakar’s stagnation.Although Nicci and the rebels would cause quite a stir with the deadly animalsand the warrior slaves, Mirrormask had plans of his own. The sorceress wasn’tthinking big enough. He could cause so much more mayhem!He clutched his broken mask, using just enough of his gift to fuse the piecesclumsily together so that the mirror was intact again, though distorted. Bloodstill flowed from the gashes on his face. He healed it just enough to createscabs, not wasting the time or energy to do more right now.He ducked through a side tunnel, looking for a way back out to the streets. Thestench of blood and rotting meat filled his nostrils. This was the passagewaythrough which slaves delivered the animal feeding carts, but the slaves had allfled now. Many were probably among his own followers. Mirrormask didn’t knowthem by name, saw them mainly as a resource to drive his own plans.Bells began to ring from the city towers, not to mark the sacrifice, but tosummon the city guard. Armored soldiers ran through the streets, marching outfrom garrisons, strapping on swords, quivers, and crossbows. Angry lower-classpeople were shouting, rushing out of alleys and side streets to attack theguards with makeshift clubs or confiscated swords.Most of the soldiers were not gifted, but they had training and superiorweapons, which the slaves did not. However, Mirrormask—and yes, Nicci, too—hadgiven the rebels and the downtrodden another weapon. Their anger andindignation, their thirst for revenge, made them selfless fighters and thereforemore deadly than any trained guard. They fell upon the soldiers.Knowing this was happening throughout the city, Mirrormask smiled behind hisclumsily repaired mask. He didn’t let anyone see him. He kept to the shadows,flitting down alleys, working his way around the looming combat arena with itsobservation towers and raised seats above the killing sands. This revolution wasfar more entertaining than any arena spectacle.Mirrormask climbed the streets, knowing the back ways, slipping through orchardsand climbing walls until he reached the sprawling mansion of the fleshmancerAndre. He could enter one of the wings from the back.With his gift, he easily diverted Andre’s guardian spells, but he had moretrouble with the vicious thorns in the squirming hedge of eyeflowers thatsurrounded the courtyard. His gray robe was torn in several places and he wasdisgusted with the inconvenience. But he got inside.He knew that Nathan, the traveler and supposed wizard, remained an experimentalsubject inside the fleshmancer’s studio. Nathan had survived the horrificexchange of hearts, although it remained to be seen whether he could demonstrateany restored capacity for the gift. Perhaps all that pain and effort had beenfor naught. Mirrormask did not know if Nathan Rahl would be an enemy or an ally,but unless the useless wizard could release his magic, he was irrelevant.Mirrormask had an entirely different purpose in visiting Andre’s mansion.Many lights were lit inside the sprawling building, and the fleshmancer was nodoubt preparing for the blood magic at the pyramid in the next few hours. Hewould never be prepared for what Mirrormask was about to do, however.A separate wing was dark, the windows covered with tightly woven hangings. IfAndre called his experimental laboratories his “studio,” then this separate wingwas his “gallery,” where he displayed his most magnificent work.Mirrormask had been looking forward to this for a long time.He was alone inside the dark and silent wing, but in the presence of tremendouspower. He could feel the anger, the impatience, the bottled fury trembling inthe air. He ignited a hand light and set it floating against the wall so that hecould behold the three towering armored figures, fighting behemoths encased intheir prison of armor.The Ixax warriors.He could sense them, and knew they were aware of his presence. He saw theirglittering yellow eyes behind the slit openings in their helmets. The titansloomed there, straining inside their confinement. They had been locked immobilefor more than fifteen centuries.“Patience, patience,” he whispered. “It’s almost time.”He looked through the slits in his own mask, which reminded him of theirencapsulating helmets. Maybe the behemoths could see their reflections in thecracked covering on his face.He stepped up to the first Ixax warrior. “I apologize to the other two. One ofyou will certainly be sufficient for my needs.”The thick studded armor was marked with the insignia of Ildakar, a sun withlightning bolts—back then, Andre had been quite patriotic. He had created thistrio of titans, hoping to unleash them so they could mow down swaths of GeneralUtros’s army, like a scythe harvesting wheat. The wizards of Ildakar had stoppedthe fleshmancer from creating more than three, fearing how powerful those humanweapons might be, suspecting they could be uncontrollable.The petrification spell and then the shroud of eternity had rendered the Ixaxwarriors moot.Mirrormask reached forward, found a deeply etched rune in the steel-hard leatherarmor on the first titan’s waist. Releasing his gift, he activated the spellthat encased the mammoth soldier like a cocoon. He broke apart the magicalmanacles that held the Ixax motionless.As the room began to glow, Mirrormask backed away. “Wake,” he said, “and do whatyou were meant to do.”He laughed, knowing that this would be far more disruptive than anything elsehis rebels could achieve. Mirrormask flitted out into the darkness as the Ixaxwarrior began to bend his massive arms and legs.Awakened at last.* * *The smashing uproar in the side wing of his mansion jarred Andre from hismusing.Elsa had stayed all day to help guide Nathan through his recovery. She suggestedexercises, tiny gestures of magic that would help him build his confidence.Sometimes Nathan succeeded, but at other times the magic reacted in bizarreways. Occasionally, nothing happened at all.Andre was losing patience with his subject. “If you continue to fail, then we’lljust have to find you another heart, hmmm?”Nathan’s face turned ashen at the suggestion. “No, I’ll keep trying. I willunlock my gift.” He turned to Elsa with a look of desperation. “We’ll find away.”“We must stop soon, because we have to go up to the pyramid. The bloodworkinghappens at midnight,” Andre told Elsa, then raised his eyebrows. “You can comeand observe, Nathan, if you like. It might give you some inspiration, though,alas, you won’t be allowed to participate. Not yet.”Nathan did not appear pleased by the invitation.Just then, crashing sounds rang throughout the mansion, a deep hollow roar thatsounded like a bear groaning in an echoing cave.“Now what is it?” Andre said, exasperated.He had heard the alarm bells and shouts down by the combat arena and was surethat some other mayhem was taking place down there. More animals released,perhaps. The city was becoming quite unruly. But he was busy in his own mansion,and the bloodworking would soon require all their attention.This time, however, the havoc emanated from his own home. Elsa and Nathan lookedas if they wanted to follow him, but he snapped, “Stay here.”He stalked off, feeling a shiver go down his spine as he ran toward the sidewing, where the noise had become deafening.“Here now! By the Keeper—” he shouted, striding into the high-ceilinged gallerywhere he displayed the towering Ixax warriors. Two of the armored titansremained motionless, as they always had been. But the third mammoth soldierlurched forward on treelike armor-encased legs, stomping boots so hard theycracked the flagstones of the floor.Andre could only blink and stare.The Ixax reacted to his arrival, swiveling its gigantic helmet so it saw thefleshmancer, its creator, its tormentor. The eyes blazed like tiny balls ofwizard’s fire.Andre stumbled back, holding up his hands and summoning his gift. The Ixaxstrode forward with thunderous footfalls, clenching huge gauntleted hands.Andre released magic in a wall of force that slammed into the armored titan, butit had little effect. The Ixax simply plowed through the magic, intent on thewizard who had taken three unwilling Ildakaran soldiers, conscripts who hadagreed to help their city without knowing what they were offering to do. Thefleshmancer had used those young men as the raw material to create thesethings—weapons powerful enough to save Ildakar, weapons that had never beenused.Instead, the monstrosities had been locked awake, motionless, going insane forfifteen hundred years.Now the Ixax was unleashed, and his limbs swung free, releasing pent-up fury. Hehammered the stone wall with his fist like a boulder launched from a catapult,and the blow crushed through the blocks, pulverizing them.The Ixax let out another bellow, amplified through his helmet. Andre hurledwizard’s fire at the monstrosity. The fierce magical flames scorched the armor,but quickly rolled off. The titan closed the distance to Andre in two stridesand loomed over the fleshmancer.Trapped, Andre flung up his hand, releasing blasts of magic—sizzling bolts oflightning, howling wind, and fire—but the Ixax warrior did not even draw hishuge sword. Instead, he raised a gauntleted fist, clenched it tight, and poundeddown with all the force of a giant falling tree.With a single blow, the Ixax crushed Andre, breaking him, splattering him into amass of jagged bones, a shattered skull, scattered teeth, and spraying blood. Heraised the gauntlet again and brought it down, pounding the ruined corpseanother time, hammering the remains into a pulp.Seven identical blows later, nothing remained of the fleshmancer but a widelydispersed film of gore. Blood, smeared tissue, and bone powder spattered thegallery’s floors, walls, and ceiling.The Ixax lifted his huge feet and straightened. Even though he had destroyed hiscreator and tormentor, he was not satisfied after waiting for fifteen centuries.He had been created for destruction, so he marched ahead to destroy everythingin sight.Everything."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 72 [contents.xhtml#c_ch72]When the clamor and shouts erupted through the fighting pits, Bannon guessedwhat was happening, and hope surged within him. The uproar seemed even greaterthan the previous time. It sounded like more than just a skirmish. This wasoutright war.Bannon went to the bars of his cell and peered out, seeing the brown-robedfigures hurrying into the fighters’ area. This time, they wore their hoods down,defiantly showing their features. Yelling, the rebels drove the unleashedanimals ahead of them.Two black spiny wolves loped forward, snapping their jaws, but more intent onescape than savagery. Three leopards sprang down the tunnels, dodging fallenbodies, paying no attention to the large swamp dragons that scuttled forward onpowerful scaled legs.Bannon shook the barred door of his cell, desperate to break free. He wanted torun loose like the animals, to burst from this prison. He was shirtless, soreand bruised, wearing only a fighter’s loincloth. But after his vigoroustraining, he was more lean and muscular than he had ever been before.He was trapped, held captive as a toy to be thrown out into the combat arena forthe amusement of the people of Ildakar.He hammered on the bars. “Let me loose!”The other fighters took up the chant, pounding on their bars as well. “Set usfree!”And the hooded rebels did exactly that.Mirrormask’s followers had seized keys, and they spread out in the tunnels,rushing from one cell to the next. The caged fighters stared grimly inanticipation, waiting for the doors to open. Their shouts grew louder. “Free me.Free me!”The rebels worked the locks and threw open the barred doors. Muscular youngtrainees as well as seasoned warriors stalked out, blinking and confused as ifthey didn’t know what to do.From his cell, Bannon yelled, “You can still fight. Get your weapons! We can allbattle our way free.” He rattled the bars again, then muttered, “If I ever getout of here.”A female rebel raced up to Bannon’s cell, meeting his eyes through the bars. Shehad a flinty gaze and she looked like an old woman, but Bannon realized shecould not have been more than forty years old. A life of slavery had drained hervitality away like an old rag wrung dry. She fumbled with the key, inserting itin the lock, and turning it. She grimaced, trying harder, but the key didn’twork.“It’s a different one,” Bannon said. He had seen Lila use it numerous times.“The brass one.” The woman shifted to another key.Out in the gallery, the freed fighters rushed to the weapons stockpile. Ignoringthe racks of dulled blades and wooden practice rods, they snatched up the shortswords they used in the combat arena.The rebels gave them the name to cheer. “For Mirrormask!” The fighters took upthe name, and one of the brown-robed figures added, “And for Nicci!”“For Nicci!” they all echoed.Bannon’s heart leaped. Nicci! Nicci was here! The woman on the other side of thegate fumbled with the brass key and inserted it into the lock. She looked atBannon and smiled.Before she could turn it in the keyhole, though, a hissing swamp dragon racedforward and snapped its jaws around her legs. It yanked backward, and though shegrabbed at the bars, the reptile broke her grip and tore her body away from thecell door.Bannon reached through the bars, trying to grab her, but the lizard thing flungher to the stone floor. She pounded with her fists, and blood gushed from hermangled legs. The reptile snapped its jaws and bit her hand off all the way tothe elbow, crunching down on her bones.The key fell out of the lock, struck the stone floor, clinked, and bounced away.Bannon pounded on the door, desperate to break free so he could help her.When the swamp dragon bit through her throat and killed her, the immolation runeon her amulet ignited, and the rebel’s body burst into a crackle of searingflame. The fire flared up and also engulfed the big reptile. The monster hissedand rolled away, but its scales were blackened, its stomach bloated as theintense fire boiled its internal organs.Bannon dropped to his knees, but the cell door wasn’t open yet. He reachedthrough the gap, jamming his shoulder against the bars as he strained to reachthe key. It lay just out of reach near the smoldering remnants of the woman whohad tried to help him. He stretched his fingers and rammed his shoulder againstthe bars to get an extra hairsbreadth of reach. Finally, the tip of his indexfinger brushed the metal end of the key. He stroked it, made it move barelytoward him, then again, and the key edged just close enough for him to snag itwith his fingertip. He clutched it in his cupped palm like the greatest treasurehe’d ever held.Working through the bars, he inserted the key, fumbled to turn it, and heard theclick. A wash of weakness and relief turned his blood to water. Bannon shook hishead, trembling, and pushed open the barred door.Out in the gallery, the rebels and the unleashed fighters ran loose, confusedbut exhilarated. They battled a fearsome speckled boar, herding it down one ofthe larger tunnels and out into the city, where it could cause more havoc.A big, bald veteran fighter emerged from his cage and looked around angrily. Oneof the rebels handed him a sword. “Fight! Fight for your freedom.” The veteranfighter grasped the sword, sneered, and thrust it into the heart of the rebel.The astonished robed man collapsed to his knees and fell on his face beforebursting into a self-contained funeral pyre.“We fight for Ildakar,” growled the veteran, “not for Mirrormask!” He strodeforward, holding up his bloody blade in defiance. The brown-robed rebels werestunned that one of the slaves would turn against them.Four of the newly freed fighters ran toward the veteran, raising their swords.“No! We fight for ourselves, and we fight for the future,” one shouted.The bald veteran was taken aback and defended himself as the four young fightersfell upon him. One stabbed into the meat of his shoulder. “We don’t fight forAdessa!”“We do not fight for the sovrena,” shouted the second man as he plunged hisblade into the veteran’s belly.“We fight for Mirrormask and for Nicci!” they cried as they stabbed again andagain. The seasoned veteran did not have a chance.With the door of his cell finally open, Bannon bolted out to join the others.“For Nicci!” he yelled, hoping she was here, hoping she could hear him. Hejumped over the greasy smoke and the smoldering pile in front of his cell. Heneeded a weapon—not just any weapon, but his weapon.The other fighters had taken the familiar short swords with which they hadtrained, but Bannon knew where Lila kept his own blade, wrapped in a cloth andstored in a high alcove. He ran to it, paying no heed to the fighting all aroundhim. He grabbed his sword, pulled it down from the notch in the sandstone wall.Sturdy fell into his arms, and he yanked away the cloth covering. His handcurled around the leather-wrapped hilt.“Sweet Sea Mother!” Tears stung his eyes. He swung the blade from side to side,feeling energy build within him. He no longer felt his aches, his bruises. Hewas free, and he would fight out in the city. He would find his friends.“Nicci!” he shouted.With the shroud in place, they could no longer just leave Ildakar, but theycould remake the city. That was his focus now. He didn’t know how many days hehad spent down here in the training pits and barred cells, but it seemed like aneternity.Armored trainers ran into the fray, holding shields, wielding their own swords.These were not as skilled as the morazeth, but they had fought and pummeled thetrainees during many practice sessions, including Bannon. He spun to face them,holding up Sturdy. It felt good in his hand, but he knew this would not beanother practice session.“Back to your cages, slaves!” roared one of the trainers. Sneering andoverconfident, he lunged forward, swinging his shield at Bannon. The young mandid not back away, and the trainer faltered for an instant, surprised atBannon’s reaction. With a yell, he smashed the trainer’s shield with the longsword, hammering hard, then swinging again with both hands and all his might.The blow was enough to crack the trainer’s wrist, and he reeled. Bannon reactedlike lightning, responding with his instincts, and he swung the sword again andchopped deep into the other man’s neck.As the man fell onto the bloody stone floor, Bannon stared at what he had done.Yes, he’d been taught well, and the morazeth had warned him to show no mercy. Heshuddered, but refused to allow himself to feel shock or guilt. He would bedoing much more killing before the night was done.He knew the most important thing he had to do. Dodging deadly animals, scatteredrebels, and freed warriors, Bannon sprinted toward Ian’s cell. The champion, hisfriend—the embittered man who had been held prisoner for so long—remainedinside, staring out at the turmoil, his steely eyes drinking in the details.Bannon arrived at the barred door. “You know it’s not locked, Ian. Why didn’tyou get away?”His friend considered for a long moment. “Because this is where I belong.”Bannon worked the latch and swung open the gate. “No it isn’t! You belong withme. You belong back home. You never should have been taken from Chiriya Island.I never should have been a coward, but that’s all behind us. I can’t do anythingabout the past, but I can save you now. Come with me. I beg you. You must befree.”“I am already free.” Ian squared his broad shoulders and stared at the opendoor. “I’m a warrior. I am Ildakar’s champion.”“Ildakar will be different after tonight,” Bannon said. “Come, we have to getout into the streets.”Ian shook his head, staring at his friend grimly from his open cell. His facelooked old, scarred, a stranger’s face … a killer’s face. “All I know how to dois fight. I cannot run away with you.”“Yes, you can! If we can bring down the shroud, there’s the rest of the world. Ihave so much to show you, but first we have to get away. Fight with me for whatis right, for what is noble and true.”Ian shook his head. “What would I do if I just got away? That isn’t me. I am thechampion.”Bannon caught a flicker of motion out of the corner of his eye. He turned to seea tawny sand panther lope into the torch-lit gallery chamber. Mrra! Nicci waswith the sand panther, wearing her black dress and holding a bloody dagger ineach hand.“Bannon Farmer!” she called out. “Bannon, where are you?”He gave Ian a pleading look, then whirled. “Sorceress, I’m here!” His heartswelled with joy despite the screams and growls around him mixed with the clashof blades. With one more quick look back at Ian, he said, “Come with me, Ian!Give yourself a chance at a new life.”But his friend stepped farther back into his spacious cell.Vowing to return for him this time, Bannon bounded over to Nicci. Thespell-branded panther prowled along beside her. Blood covered Mrra’s fangs,muzzle, and paws.“I didn’t know what had happened to you, Sorceress!” Bannon babbled, and heclumsily attempted to hug her. “They captured me, dragged me down here, forcedme to fight. Where’s Nathan? What’s happened to you? I heard you were dead.”“You have too many questions,” she said in a low, hard voice. “I see you haveyour sword. That is all you need right now, not more answers. Fight with us. Wemust release these people, then move against the ruling council. Sovrena Thoraintends to slaughter three hundred victims tonight and make the shroudpermanent.”Bannon’s heart sank. “Then we have to stop it. And now we have an army.”“Yes,” Nicci said, “now we have an army.”The fighting had moved into the main gallery, the open area with several deepfighting pits dug out of the floor. Bannon had sweated and bled in those pits.The freed fighters ran forward, waving their swords, but they suddenlyhesitated, backing away as four robed rebels were killed in short order, theirbodies bursting into flame. Five deadly morazeth strode into the gallery, eachone carrying her weapon of choice. “Back, all of you! Back to your cages.”Lila was among them. Bannon’s heart skipped a beat. He flinched and stepped backtoward Nicci and the sand panther, squeezing his grip on Sturdy’s hilt.Nicci, Bannon, and Mrra strode ahead, their steps in tandem. Nicci’s blond haircrackled with magic, flowing like a comet’s tail behind her head. She spoke tothe morazeth. “The cages will not hold them, and you no longer control thesepeople.”Bannon stepped up beside Nicci, facing the group of morazeth and forcing a bravetone that he didn’t necessarily feel. “All of us will fight you, and we willwin—you trained us well enough.”Lila sneered at him and came forward, selecting her obvious target. “I’ve justbeen playing with you, boy. The real training is about to begin.” She wielded asword with her right hand, a dagger with her left, and an even sharper smile onher face.But he had Sturdy.While Bannon defended himself against his opponent, Nicci and Mrra threwthemselves against the other morazeth, who seemed surprised by the furiousresistance. Mrra slashed with her claws, bit down hard with her curved fangs,and tore one of the attackers to a bloody mess.More female fighters swarmed in, clattering their blades. They fought around theedges of the various circular pits, some shallow and empty, some connected to alower network of tunnels. The pit nearest Bannon had curved iron spikes on thewalls, like the spines of a giant thistle, to prevent any subjects fromescaping.Facing Lila, Bannon stayed several steps from the edge, not wanting to fall in.He would fight her out in the open. Free. Once he defeated Lila, once hebattered her the way she had battered him, he would escape into the city withall these other fighters.And, he desperately hoped, with Ian.In black sandals laced up to the knees and the short leather wrap, Lila did notappear imposing, but Bannon knew full well how deadly she could be. She grippedher sword, carving hypnotic patterns in the air with its tip. She jabbed thepoint in the air, trying to distract him—which convinced Bannon that her realattack would come from her dagger. That was how she intended to kill him.Yes, Lila had taught him, but perhaps his morazeth trainer didn’t know exactlyhow much he had learned from her.She thrust fiercely with the short sword at the same time as she slipped herdagger up in a stealthy arc, intending to plunge it into his ribs. Bannon dodgedthe feint and swung Sturdy sideways to deflect the much smaller knife. Thediscolored blade smashed into the dagger, twisting Lila’s wrist. She gasped inpain and jerked her hand away. The dagger clattered to the floor, bounced, andfell into the deep spike-walled pit beside them.Anger flashed in Lila’s eyes, and then she laughed. “A good trick! I see you’vebeen learning, boy.”“You’ve taught me a lot. I’ll put it to practice right now.”“I have much more to show you.” She slashed with her sword, trying to intimidatehim. “If you survive today.”“Maybe you won’t survive to teach me.”“Then you would miss me,” she taunted. She swung the blade, but he parried withhis longer sword.On the other side of the pit, Nicci and Mrra fought two of the morazeth. Longred lines marred the sand panther’s tawny hide, but she lunged forward andsnapped the neck of one of the warrior women, while Nicci used both of herdaggers and unleashed a surge of magic into the wooden knout her morazethopponent used. The knout turned into a torch in the woman’s hands, and shethrashed the blazing end in Nicci’s face.Letting one dagger drop, Nicci caught the flaming end in her bare hand,extinguished it with her gift, then plunged her second dagger into themorazeth’s throat. With a grunt, she tossed the dead body down into the pitbeside her. The morazeth didn’t fall all the way down. Her body was impaled onthe curved iron spikes and hung there like an insect thrust onto a tree thorn bya shrike bird.Lila had been lulling Bannon, teasing him, but now she flung herself at him withfull fury. She was a fierce dervish of attack, her white teeth clenched. Bannonquickly found himself on the defensive. He could barely keep his balance. Shehammered at him, made him stagger. His foot brushed the edge of the spike-walledpit, and he nearly slipped. He caught his balance by propping the tip of Sturdyon the ground and swinging his other hand. Lila drove in for the kill.She stopped as if she had been yanked back by a leash. Her head lolled; her gazereeled. Her face turned chalky pale as she collapsed, falling forward onto thefloor, the back of her head bloodied.Ian stood behind her, holding a sword. He had struck her with the flat of theblade to render her unconscious.Panting and shuddering, Bannon looked at the limp form of his lovely morazethtrainer. Ian stood over her, unsettled and uncertain. “You needed help. I savedyou again.”“Thank you, Ian,” he nearly sobbed. His friend had come back! “This time we’llboth get away.”The fighters kept battling as more black-clad morazeth dashed into the fray,coming through from the arena tunnels. Adessa arrived, a brooding knot ofenergy, her dark eyes glittering. “You will all die this night—if I have to killyou myself.”Bannon’s heart froze.Ian turned to Adessa, stony and determined. The champion braced himself,crouched into a well-practiced fighting stance. He rippled with preciselycalibrated energy. Bannon had seen him fight in the arena, but he knew thisbattle would be greater than any of Ian’s other challenges. The scarred youngman extended his free hand and shoved Bannon in the chest, forcing him backwardand away from the fight. “Go! You said it yourself—get away.”“I won’t leave you! I left you once before.”Ian flashed a quick glance at him. “And because of that, I’m now the bestfighter in all of Ildakar. Let me prove it.” Warm sincerity infused his eyes.“This time it’s my choice, Bannon. You need have no guilt about it.”Adessa locked her eyes on the defiant man and bounded forward on lithe,spell-branded legs, holding up her blade, clenching her gauntleted fist. “Comethen, lover.” She curled her lips in a dark smile. “I can’t get enough of yourflesh against mine.”Ian braced himself, facing her with his sword. Adessa held her own blade justwithin striking distance, murder in her eyes, prepared to kill the young man whostood in front of her.Bannon retreated toward Nicci and Mrra as they turned.Ian was ready to fight, but there was something strange about his stance. Bannonsaw it for just an instant. Ian’s short sword drooped; his muscles tensed; hisempty hand curved outward. As Adessa fell upon him, he reached up to grab hergauntleted arm, swept out with his right foot, caught her behind the ankles, andknocked her legs out from under her. In the same flow, he drove forward usingher own momentum, spinning the two of them off balance. He pushed off sideways,launching them both over the edge of the deep fighting pit.Bannon screamed, “Ian, no!”After a long fall, the two landed hard on the sand and ashes, miraculouslyavoiding the sharp spines on the walls. The sword was knocked out of Adessa’sgrip. She lay stunned for only a moment before she scrambled away from Ian justas he got to his feet. Shaking his head, he fumbled on the ground and retrievedhis own sword. He could have killed Adessa right then if he’d struck quicklyenough. The morazeth leader was disoriented by the fall, disarmed. Suddenly herattention snapped back. She tensed like a snake.Though she no longer had her sword, she snatched the small black handle of theagile knife at her hip. She held it up, as if to remind him of all the pain itsignified. “Is that how you like to play, lover? Think of all the pleasures I’vegiven you. You are my special one, my champion.”“I’ve received much from you … and not all of it was pleasure.”She prowled around him, and he held up his sword, which was much longer than heragile knife. She could not get close enough to strike him with the short needlepoint. They circled each other warily; then she spotted her short sword, whichhad fallen to the ground. Adessa bounded across the sand, grabbed it in hergauntleted hand, and now faced him with two weapons.Bannon could only watch. Those two were far out of reach below. In the maingallery, the fighting continued around them. He wanted to shout support for Ian,or even jump down and fight at his friend’s side, but he didn’t dare distracthim. Adessa could kill in an instant.Ian and the morazeth leader continued their deadly duel, blade against blade,and Adessa slashed with her needle-pointed agile knife like the stinger of ascorpion. But Ian was the champion, and he fought as well as his mistress andtrainer.She threw herself at him, ferociously swinging her short sword and slashing along wound down his left arm, but Ian punched her with his empty fist and senther stumbling on the loose sand. Adessa fell backward, twisting her body, andstruck the wall. One of the iron spikes dug a deep red gouge along her shoulderblade.Adessa didn’t seem to feel any pain, did not pause to recover. She threw herselfforward, driving hard with her sword. Ian fought magnificently, but hehesitated. Bannon suddenly realized that his friend didn’t want to kill her.Adessa jeered, “What’s the matter? Are you afraid of me, Champion?”He responded as he had been trained to do, as he had been provoked to do. With aroar, he drove harder, battering her with his sword, smashing her blade away,hitting harder and harder, until he broke her wrist, knocking the sword awayfrom her. The blade dropped to the arena floor, and he pounded the pommel of hissword against the side of her head. With an additional shove from his emptyhand, he sent her sprawling onto the ground near the iron spikes. “I am notafraid of you.”She was disarmed, propped on her elbows, shuddering and bleeding from the gashin her shoulder. Her sword arm hung limp with the broken bone. Ian stood overher, his sword raised for the deathblow.“I am your lover,” she said. “Don’t you remember all the pleasure I gave you?”Ian’s face was stony. He pointed his blade down, ready to plunge it through herheart. He hesitated, as she seemed to know he would.“You can’t kill me, because there’s something you don’t know.” Her face twistedin a smile. “For these last four weeks I have been carrying your child.”Ian was taken completely by surprise. He froze for just part of a second.In that moment, Adessa snatched the object she had been covering with her body,the weapon she had found in the sand at the base of the pit. Lila’s dagger,which Bannon had knocked down there.The morazeth woman grabbed the knife in her good hand and lunged like a cobrastriking. She swept up with the blade, using all of her momentum as she droveher body upward with her legs. She thrust the dagger into the center of Ian’schest, shoving it deep and twisting it in his heart.He gasped, coughed blood, and hung like a dead yaxen on a hook.“Ian!” Bannon screamed. “Ian!”But his friend was already dead, and Adessa was too far below.“Now you have made me angry, boy,” said another razor-edged feminine voice.Bannon turned just in time to see Lila, recovered now. She had picked herself upfrom the ground and charged toward him, her blade raised to kill him.Though sickened and stunned by the death of Ian, Bannon spun to defend himself.Nicci stepped in just behind Lila and slammed the pommel of one of her daggersdown hard, bashing the morazeth woman on the already bloodied back of her skull.Lila dropped like a felled tree, crashing to the sandstone floor above the arenapits. Next to her, Mrra roared.Bannon felt frozen, horrified. He stared down at Ian’s bloody form as Adessacast the body aside, but she was too far down in the pit. He couldn’t get toher.Lila lay unconscious next to him, blood matting her short light brown hair.Beside him, Nicci scowled at Adessa. They both wished to be down there to tearthe woman apart, but Nicci had a determined sheen in her eyes. Mrra thrashed hertail.“We can fight here all night, Bannon, but we have a more important battle out inthe city. We have to stop the bloodworking at the pyramid. Come with me. First,we need to find Nathan.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 73 [contents.xhtml#c_ch73]Once inside Cliffwall and surrounded by the smell of books and scrolls, PrelateVerna felt as if the Creator had rewarded her beyond her wildest dreams. Shefelt giddy over the wondrous information on shelf after shelf, room after room,tower after tower.Oliver and Peretta had returned home to a great deal of rejoicing. The veteranscholars rushed out to greet them, full of questions, as well as news of theirown. Peretta introduced her aunt Gloria, the new leader of the memmers. Oliverhappily brought forward Franklin, an owl-eyed gifted scholar who did not seemready for any sort of leadership role, although he was the newscholar-archivist.While most of the D’Haran soldiers built their camp on the canyon floor, thegeneral, the prelate, and the two young travelers had climbed the narrow path upthe cliffside. In the cavernous alcove filled with enormous buildings, otherscholars met them, leading the visitors inside the great archive.Before they entered the imposing stone façades, Peretta gestured toward thecanyon vista. “This was covered by a camouflage shroud for thousands of years.Few ever discovered these canyons at all, and if outsiders did look up at thiscliff, they saw only a blank wall rather than these buildings.”“But now the hidden knowledge is open and available to all,” Oliver said.“Yes,” General Zimmer said in a deep, serious growl. “And that concerns usgreatly. The Sisters will certainly help.”The numerous scholars gathered in a main communal room, while workers hurried toprepare a midday meal. The general made sure that his soldiers and their mountswere cared for below. “The horses can water at the stream and graze in thepastures alongside the sheep, but my men will be tired of eating pack food. If Icould press upon your hospitality?”Gloria dispatched her memmers to see that it was done. Verna sat on a long benchin the dining room, as servers hurried in with platters of meats and fruit,baskets of bread. Verna selected a small green apple from the top of the fruitbowl, turned it in her hand to inspect for worms. Finding none, she bit into itand savored the tart juiciness. She let out an appreciative sigh.Franklin addressed them all, happy to meet Verna, the general, and theircompanions. “Nicci spoke of the Sisters of the Light, and we wished we hadsomeone like you to guide us. We are pleased you came so soon.”“We hurried,” Peretta said. “After talking with Prelate Verna, we decided it wasimportant for us to lead them back here.”“We sorely needed you,” Franklin said, scratching his brown hair as he gave athankful nod to Verna. “Scholar-Archivist Simon was killed, and then we alsolost Victoria. We have been muddling along, but we weren’t sure how best toselect a leader. There’s so much work to do.”Gloria added, “We promised Nicci we would not attempt any of the magic we foundin the books. We’re merely trying to organize and catalog the thousands ofvolumes.”“We’ve been told that our books on prophecy are no longer relevant,” Franklinsaid. “Useless, in fact.”Verna let out a sad sigh. “Yes, I spent much of my life studying prophecy,learning the meanings of countless books, tracing various forks, interpretingpossibilities, all for naught. When the Palace of the Prophets was destroyedalong with that copious knowledge, I thought my way of life was ended.” Sheforced a hard smile. “But I endured. The rest of the Sisters endured. We servedLord Rahl, and we found extensive libraries in the People’s Palace and othercentral sites. We decided to learn what we could and preserve the information.Then, with the star shift…” She shook her head again.Amber spoke up, holding a fresh hunk of bread in her hand. “Now we have adifferent focus. We can help you.”“We can guide you,” Verna corrected. “My Sisters and I trained many students,including Richard Rahl himself. And although the rules of magic are nowdifferent in unpredictable ways, we shall learn, and you’ll learn along withus.”Peretta added, “The memmers have to learn how to be scholars as well. Oliveragreed to show me.”Beside her, Oliver blinked as if the news was a surprise to him. “I … well, ofcourse I will.”More servers brought in bowls of steamed leaves and sliced tubers topped withdollops of melting sheep’s butter. “It’s delicious,” General Zimmer said, as oneof the scholars passed him a platter of cold mutton roast. He carved some of themeat with his own knife, then cut off a piece for Verna. “Prelate?”“Yes, thank you.”Franklin said, “Ever since Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon left us, we’ve beenrebuilding. We are returning to normal. Settlers are coming back to reclaim whatwas once the Scar.”“We found a few new settlements in the valley,” Zimmer said. “Before long,agriculture and commerce will be thriving here. There is so much land to settleand explore, I may have to summon many more troops from the New World.”“Give us time to study the lore contained in Cliffwall,” Verna said, “and wewill send an important report to Lord Rahl. He may need to dispatch a thousandnew scholars, too.”“We’ve already sent out the word to the surrounding lands,” said Franklin.“Years ago, after Victoria discovered how to drop the camouflage shroud, we putout a call for gifted scholars from the other towns throughout the valley and upin the mountains. Many responded.” He shook his head sadly. “But they were alsountrained. That is where Roland came from, the Lifedrinker.…”“Dear spirits, we won’t let that happen again.” Verna finished her meat and tooka helping of the steamed greens. She was surprised at her appetite.“If you and your Sisters intend to read our books,” Gloria said, with a smile,“then you must repay the favor by telling us your stories.”“We have many stories,” Peretta said. “Oliver and I saw things we never readabout in the archives.” She mischievously looked over at her companion. “Tellthem about the kraken-hunter ship.”They finished the meal by describing their journeys, while Verna also talkedabout Lord Rahl and how she herself had found him, untrained, with Kahlan amongthe Mud People, the “pebble in the pond” as prophesied, a war wizard who wouldchange the world, but only if he could learn and control his gift. In order tosave him from deadly skull-splitting headaches, she had been forced to place acontrolling iron collar around his neck.The scholars listened, muttering. Franklin asked, “Will you place iron collarsaround our necks, too?”“That will not be necessary,” Verna said. Her fellow Sisters also looked at her,as if they, too, were unsure of the answer. Verna shook her head morevigorously. “We know other ways to train the gifted scholars here.”After the meal, Verna was anxious to get started. Once the Cliffwall scholarshad shown them their guest quarters, as well as a room for General Zimmer to useas an office, Verna gathered her Sisters.The women went into an echoing library chamber with a roaring fireplace. Booksof all sizes filled shelves that reached to the ceiling. Wooden tables withthick legs and carved feet were covered with scrolls and open volumes. Glowing,magical lamps shed sufficient reading light every hour of the day and night.Verna, Amber, and the others just stood there, smiling. The prelate turnedslowly, not sure where to begin. “Dear spirits,” she whispered under her breath.Beside her, Novice Amber actually giggled. “Just look at the books, Prelate!This might be every word that’s been written in the history of the world.”Verna smiled. “Not by far, child. Not by far.” But as she stared at thethousands of spines, each volume filled with unread and powerful lore, shebreathed a long sigh. “But it may be a good portion.”For so long she had searched for a new direction after the end of prophecy, andnow Verna felt she had a greater purpose than ever before.With a quick gesture, she scattered her Sisters, not telling them where to go,just urging them to get started. “We have nourished our bodies. Now let usnourish our minds.” Verna plunged into the wealth of knowledge like a swimmercrossing a deep pond.Without looking at the words on the spine, she chose a thick, impressive-lookingvolume from one of the shelves and took it to a study table. She sat beside anintent scholar who bent over a long scroll that dangled off the edge of thetable. He was hunched so close to the scribed words that he nearly pressed hisnose to the parchment. He moved his lips as he read, but didn’t look up at her.Verna removed the toad figurine that she had already carried all this way.Amused, she placed it on the tabletop in front of her, rotated it so the large,round eyes stared at the stack of books. Then she smiled and turned to her ownvolume, opened the thick, scuffed cover, and began to read."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 74 [contents.xhtml#c_ch74]Fleshmancer Andre’s bloodcurdling scream echoed through his entire villa, thenended abruptly. In the other room, Elsa backed away, her eyes wide as sheglanced nervously at Nathan. “What did he unleash upon Ildakar?”“I will save us first, dear lady, and then worry about saving the entire city.”He gathered his white smocklike robe around him and took her arm. “It would bewise for us to leave this place.”Elsa hurried along as they pulled aside the indigo hangings, looking for a wayout of the maze that Andre called his studio. With a booming sound and anechoing bellow, something huge hammered through the stone block walls, comingcloser.Before Nathan and Elsa could reach the high foyer at the front of the mansion,the wall opposite them cracked and shivered. A loud pounding blow crashed like abattering ram, and the thick walls toppled. A huge figure threw stone blocksaside like a squirrel scattering leaves in autumn. Nathan’s mouth dropped openin disbelief.The mammoth warrior was like an insane juggernaut smashing through the supportwalls.“Dear spirits, he awakened one of the Ixax warriors!” Elsa cried. Nathan reachedout an arm and swept Elsa behind him. The gigantic soldier turned the iron shellof its cauldron-sized helmet toward the sound of Nathan’s voice. Its yellow eyesblazed through the slit.“Those things were never meant to be activated,” Elsa said. “I didn’t even knowthey were still alive.”“Alive and angry it seems.” Nathan raised his hands in a placating gesture,speaking directly to the titan. “But I’m not the one who tormented you. Wearen’t your enemies.”Fifteen feet tall, the Ixax crashed through the broken stone and lumbered intothe great foyer. Nathan and Elsa backed toward the vine-covered front entrance.The warrior swung its boulder-sized fists, crushing one of the stone blocks intopowder.“I don’t suppose you’d listen to reason?” Nathan pleaded.The Ixax warrior charged like an angry bull the size of a mountain.They scrambled through the spacious foyer, but Nathan knew the Ixax could easilyrun them down. The enormous armored warrior might merely crush them, or perhaps,like a child tormenting an insect, pull them apart limb by limb.The titan confronted one of the marble support columns that rose to the archedceiling. It wrapped its armored arms around the column and strained, crackingthe stone, uprooting the pillar like an angry bear tearing up a tree. The Ixaxhurled the column toward Nathan and Elsa.She held up her hand, and with a shove of magic, diverted the pillar so that itspun in the air and crashed into the second tall marble column, cracking it. Theceiling groaned and splintered. Shards tumbled down to the tiled floor. Thesecond support column broke in the middle, and the halves collapsed.The ceiling cracked, and Nathan grabbed Elsa, pulling her through the arch andoutside the fleshmancer’s villa just as the Ixax straightened and raised bothgauntleted fists. Then the ceiling collapsed, countless stone blocks burying thewarrior under tons of debris.As Nathan and Elsa ducked for shelter, powdered stone dust swirled all aroundthem, making them cough. The continuing roar of the breaking stone sounded likean avalanche. Andre’s mansion fell in on itself with a roar nearly as loud asthe Ixax.“Do you think that destroyed it?” Elsa asked, shielding her eyes from the cloudsof dust.“Of course not, dear lady,” he said. They backed away, keeping an eye on thesmoke and powder from the collapsed building. As he stared at the devastation,Nathan felt a tingle within him, sharp pains that cracked inside his chest, theheavy drumbeat of his heart. Thump, thump. Thump, thump. The lines of Hanthrough his body burned like hot wires, and the gift flowed inside him with astaccato urgency. With Elsa’s help, he had been practicing his magic, but wasstill unable to perform as the great wizard he had once been.Even with control of the gift again, though, Nathan doubted it would be enough.Andre had been an exceedingly powerful wizard, but he had not been sufficientenough to stand against his monstrous creation. What chance did Nathan have?“Why would Andre unleash that thing?” Elsa asked. “Why did he do it?”Nathan shook his head. “Andre was with the two of us, remember? Someone elseawakened that giant warrior.”“But only a great wizard can do that,” she said.He pursed his lips. “As I’ve been told so often, Ildakar is filled withwizards.”Like a geyser of erupting stone, debris flew upward as the Ixax warrior blastedits way out of the rubble, tossing massive blocks out of the way as if they wereno more than pebbles. Covered in dust but otherwise unharmed, the behemoth roseout of the ruined mansion.“By now the rest of the duma will be up near the pyramid,” Elsa said. “We haveto call them and stand together to fight against this monster.”Nathan took her arm, and they backed away. “I am generally an optimist, butAndre told me that each Ixax warrior could single-handedly slaughter thousandsof the enemy. I’m not sure all the duma members combined will be strong enough.”The Ixax charged toward them, picking up speed as it began to run. Each footfallsounded like a stonecutter’s hammer breaking rock in a quarry.Members of the city guard scurried through the streets, responding to the otheralarms. Nathan had no idea what was happening throughout Ildakar, and hewondered if Mirrormask’s rebellion had finally begun. Was awakening the Ixaxwarrior part of that attack? This huge juggernaut would cause utter mayhemthroughout the city.But what fool would do that? Who would dare?He and Elsa retreated down the street as the mammoth warrior uprooted theanchored trellises, mowed down the eerie hedgerows of eye-filled flowers. Nathanlooked for any sort of shelter among the nearby buildings.A bell tower rose next to a civic building constructed of cut sandstone blocks.The bell tolled, loud and desperate, to rouse the city, calling the defenders toarms. With all the turmoil in the streets, the population scrambled about inconfusion. Some were part of a disorganized uprising, while others were merelytrying to flee.Ten armed guards swarmed along the street, holding their swords or crossbows atthe ready. But when they came upon the behemoth, they stumbled to a waveringhalt. As the Ixax warrior turned toward them, the guard lieutenant summoned hissquad. Two crossbowmen fired metal quarrels that struck the Ixax full on thechest, but merely bounced off. The other soldiers yelled a rallying cry andthrew themselves on the impossible enemy, hacking at the massive legs tohamstring the Ixax.But the thing’s armor was like steel, and their blades caromed off of it. Theangry warrior knocked them all aside, smashing them with a single blow as ifthey were a game of gambling sticks. Blood and brains splattered on thewhitewashed walls where, incongruously, rebels had inserted bright, sharp mirrorfragments.The great bronze bell continued to ring out a deafening clamor, and the Ixaxstomped toward the tower, throwing itself upon the high stone structure. Withgauntleted hands like battering rams, it hammered the stone, pounding thestructure of the tower until the anchoring beams cracked and the sandstoneblocks crumbled. With a mighty heave the Ixax toppled the bell tower, crackingthe walls and shoving it forward.Still clanging, the bronze bell broke loose from its cradle and fell from thetower, shattering more sandstone as it went. The entire tower crashed down ontothe adjacent three-story civic building. The Ixax continued to move through thecollapsing barrier, as if the thick walls were no more than an inconvenientthicket of weeds.It roared again through the confining helmet, a tone so loud it shivered some ofthe fallen sandstone blocks. After smashing its way through the rubble, thejuggernaut careered toward the next section of buildings, where trade workerslived. People ran screaming into the night.Weeping, Elsa pulled away from Nathan and bravely stood her ground against thewarrior, raising her hands and releasing her gift. With magic, she lifted someof the broken blocks into the air and hurled them at the oncoming Ixax. A largefractured stone crashed into the helmet without making so much as a dent. TheIxax raised a gauntlet to batter another block out of the air.Seeing Elsa, it changed the focus of its rampage and came toward her. Thematronly sorceress stood frantically trying to release more magic, to find someother desperate weapon. But Nathan knew her primary strength was in transferencemagic, and she needed two points to work that. There wasn’t enough time.He cursed himself, furious for being so useless, so weak. If ever there was atime …He shoved Elsa aside, knocking her into a flower bed adjacent to the street.“Out of the way, my dear. Save yourself!”As the Ixax lumbered toward them with murderous intent, Nathan ran faster,closing the gap. His unadorned smock flapped around him. He did not feel like agreat wizard, but he was a great wizard. He was Nathan Rahl. He had lived for athousand years, and he had fought tremendous foes. His Han had been as strong asbraided steel ropes.“You think you’re invincible, monster.” Nathan stretched out his hands as if toform a laughable roadblock. “But I’m here to stop you. I did not create you, butI will end you.” His words were defiant, and he was pleased that his voicedidn’t quaver at all.“Nathan!” Elsa screamed.“Let me concentrate, please.” He thought of all of his training, all his gift,and all that he was. “I have the heart of a wizard,” he insisted. He suppressedall the times he had failed, all the spells he had been too afraid to use. Buthe had no fear now, not even fear of the titanic Ixax warrior.Thump, thump.Thump, thump.The magic was within him. The lines of Han were wrapped around him and throughhim, and his heart was strong. It beat loudly and made the magic flow and build.Nathan curled back his lips, gritted his teeth, and let out a groan. He summonedeverything he had, refusing to think about the times when the magic hadbackfired, when the result had been horrifying instead of satisfying. He strodeforward another step as the Ixax lumbered to a halt, sensing a thrum in the air,a tension. The warrior raised both of his hugely armored fists as if to batterthe world into submission.Nathan strained. He cried out. He pulled all of his gift, focusing it throughthe strong heart, the powerful heart … the dark heart of Chief Handler Ivan.He felt something tear inside him, and suddenly the last blockages of his magicdissolved away. His gift poured forth like a volcano erupting, and Nathanunleashed the magic. All of it.A giant wave of unstoppable force struck the Ixax warrior and made the armoredfigure stagger back. The titan raised both hands, strained, took one more heavyfootfall forward. But the magic blasted like a cleansing fire, pouring againstthe shield of armor that encased it.As Nathan continued the attack, the avalanche of magic scoured away thewarrior’s armor, exposing the horrendous creature’s pebbly, twisted skin,dissolving it … peeling back the flesh to unwind the wirelike muscles, flayingthe meat away to reach the enhanced bones.The helmet broke and melted to pieces, exposing the face of the Ixax warrior,the glowing eyes that shifted from anger, to pain, to a dissipating wonder asthe body that had once been a human soldier, a horrifically tormented volunteer,was torn away under the onslaught of Nathan’s gift.The torrent of magic peeled the brute into bits, rendering it down to the dustof flesh, leaving only a nightmarish memory and a wavering growl that faded inthe night like a sigh of relief.Afterward, Nathan collapsed to the street, his white robes pooling around him.Elsa ran to him, dropping to her knees and cradling his shoulders. “Nathan!”Utterly drained, he looked up at her, blinking his azure eyes. Though his voicewas weak, he managed to say, “That was rather impressive.”“You destroyed it!” she said. “Nathan, you destroyed the Ixax warrior. You savedthe city.”“I just did my part. But I think we can agree that I have my magic back.”She laughed and dashed tears from her eyes. He wanted to rest, just wanted tolie back and fall asleep for another week, but he knew he couldn’t. He struggledto his feet, leaning on Elsa. “Alas, the night’s work isn’t done. The city stillneeds saving.”Thump, thump.Thump, thump.He touched his chest, felt his pulse racing. He was strong now. He was back!Nathan did feel a shadow inside, a hint of grimness mixed with the clean lightof his gift, but Nathan had to accept it. Part of Chief Handler Ivan wouldalways be inside him.“Come with me now,” he said, as Elsa held him up. “If you’ll help me?” Nathanwasn’t sure where he had to go. As crowds gathered to look at the wreckage andmarvel at the disintegrated scraps of the Ixax warrior, the two limped along.“Let us go find out about the rest of these troubles, shall we?”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 75 [contents.xhtml#c_ch75]It should have been a night of excitement and anticipation.Like a warrior girding herself with armor to fight for the future of Ildakar,Sovrena Thora went to the ruling tower to make her final preparations. But afterhearing initial reports about the disturbances, she felt that madness haddescended upon her beloved city, a madness more impenetrable than the shroud ofeternity itself.Vicious animals rampaged through the streets, trained to kill in the arena butnow pursuing noblemen, traders, even the lower classes who got in their way. Theslave warriors had been released from their cells, and now they fought besidethe rabble, killing many members of the city guard. Much blood had already beenspilled … and wasted, when fresh blood could have been used to good effect.Such ill-advised uprisings were directed at the very underpinnings of herbeautiful, perfect city. Mirrormask and his traitorous rebels did not deserve tolive in Ildakar! Enraged, Thora wanted to use her own magic to turn them all tostone—slowly, so they could feel their muscles freeze, their bones crystallize,their minds petrify.But she couldn’t just massacre them all. If the shroud remained in place, thecity had no way to obtain new slaves, and breeding would take time. She neededthem, and she hated it. Nevertheless, she had to crush their spirit, destroy theleaders, and break the gullible rebels so they would never, ever attempt suchfoolishness again.Still not accustomed to the responsibilities of leading the city guard in placeof Avery, a harried High Captain Stuart raced into the empty chamber. He gaveher a brisk bent knee in a gesture of respect. His face was sweating and red,and his movements were jerky. “I can only give you a sketchy report, Sovrena.The battles are still raging, and my guards are reacting. I will have moreinformation after we put down the flash points and quell this unrest.”He nervously glanced at the tall windows. The flickering lights from the citybelow seemed more orange than usual, a sign of spreading fires.“It better not take long, Captain,” Thora snapped. “The bloodworking isscheduled for midnight. Hundreds of slaves await their fate—as does our belovedcity.”Stuart wiped at a crawling trickle of sweat on the left side of his cheek.“We’re doing everything we can, Sovrena, but … it is more difficult thanexpected.”“Because of all the animals and warriors released? Surely they can be confinedto the area around the combat arena.” She rose from her ruling chair. Herclinging blue gown rippled, and the strips of ornamental fur stood out, likeraised hackles.The high captain nodded. “Slaves throughout the city are setting fires,attacking their masters. They are savages. Some gifted nobles are fighting back,trying to control the mobs and extinguish the fires, but they’re outmatched.”“How can that be? Mirrormask has only a handful of deluded followers.”Stuart remained on his knee and bowed more deeply, perhaps to avoid hersea-green gaze. “It is more than a handful, I’m afraid. The movement has sweptthrough the lower levels of the city. Countless slaves have been killed, butsome managed to assassinate their owners. We don’t know how many are dead.”Thora was deeply troubled as the realization sank in. “With inflammatoryrhetoric, Mirrormask and that maddening Nicci could have swayed hundreds totheir cause.”Now Stuart looked up blinking. “Hundreds, Sovrena? There are many thousandsrising up to overthrow Ildakar.”With a gasp, she turned away so he wouldn’t see her porcelain expression groweven paler. Pink pinpricks of flush crept up her cheeks. “I refuse to believethat.”Stuart remained bowed. “Nevertheless, it is true. There have been fierce battlesdown in the training tunnels. Many morazeth are dead.”Thora reeled. “Impossible! The morazeth are…”“The morazeth are dead. At least five of them. It seems they trained their ownfighters too well.” He squirmed, looking sickened and nervous. “And Sovrena …there is more.”She huffed. “More? Haven’t you told me quite enough appalling news, Captain?”He looked away, then turned back, squared his shoulders. “I’m afraid not. Thedisturbances are widespread, and there have even been incidents in the silkyaxen dachas. Your son … one of the silk yaxen … she—she—” He couldn’t seem toget the words out.“What about Amos?” she demanded. “We don’t have time for this.”“He’s been killed, Sovrena. One of the women slashed his throat.”Thora reeled. Her knees felt weak, and she reached out to hold the arm of thechair on the dais.“I believe he … may have abused her,” Stuart continued.“What difference does that make? They are mindless toys. Amos … Amos—” Shesucked in a breath, feeling shock rather than grief. The boy had always beenunruly and arrogant, and even his mother had not seen much potential in him. Butstill, Amos was her son. “I want them all killed! All of the silk yaxen!”Stuart bowed. “It will be done, Sovrena. But first we must quell the uprisings,stop the fires, bring the people under control.”“Enough of this!” She had already sent word to the duma members, demanding thatthey gather at the ruling tower to prepare for the great sacrifice. Now sheneeded them more than ever. “I expected Andre, Quentin, Damon, and Elsa to meethere half an hour ago. And where is the wizard commander? We’re all essentialnow. As in times past, the wizards of Ildakar must combine our magic and defeatthe enemy—even if that enemy is inside our walls.”As if hearing their names, Quentin and Damon both bustled in, unkempt andharried. “We are here, Sovrena. We were preparing, but…”“Fleshmancer Andre is dead,” Quentin blurted out when Damon hesitated, nervouslystroking the long droopy mustaches on either side of his mouth.Thora took a hesitant step away from the dais, as if afraid she might tread on apoisonous serpent. “Dead? How is he dead? What did that fool do now?”“Someone unleashed one of the Ixax warriors,” said Quentin, his dusky face drawnand concerned.Thora gasped. “But the Ixax were never meant to be—”“Someone awakened it,” Damon said, standing straight. “It killed Andre,destroyed his mansion, then went on the rampage. Elsa was there, along with thewizard Nathan. They barely escaped.”Thora’s thoughts spun. An Ixax warrior was nearly invincible, a living weapondesigned to battle hundreds, if not thousands of enemies at a time. “That is …not possible.”“Not only possible, but true, Sovrena,” Quentin said.She did not know what orders to issue, how even to suggest they might defeatsuch a monster. Fleshmancer Andre had created the trio of Ixax fifteen centuriesago, and if one of the terrible titans had already killed him, she had no ideahow to stop the thing. “Where is Wizard Commander Maxim? We must all fighttogether! This is a tremendous threat—”Damon shook his head in disbelief. “It is already finished, Sovrena. The wizardNathan Rahl destroyed it. Single-handedly.”Thora just blinked at him. How many more astonishing things was she supposed toaccept in one night? Amos murdered, slaves rising up, an Ixax unleashed, and nowNathan Rahl releasing enough magic, alone, to destroy one of the great warriors?“But he is powerless, useless.”“His gift is restored,” said Quentin. “He annihilated the Ixax warrior. He andElsa are safe.”Thora didn’t know whether to be relieved or appalled. “We must act now! We neednot stand on ceremony. The sacrificial slaves are ready. We must go to thepyramid and shed the blood now, work the spells to put the shroud in placeforever before it’s too late.”High Captain Stuart stood, uncertain. He looked toward the windows again,swallowed hard at seeing the dull orange glow.Damon fidgeted, and finally Quentin said, after rubbing the back of his handacross his dry lips, “But isn’t the duma too weak to accomplish such anall-encompassing spell, Sovrena? Andre is dead; Chief Handler Ivan is dead; Rennis gone in search of the Cliffwall archive. We don’t have sufficient numbers.”“We will have enough. I’ll do it myself if I have to!” Thora felt the crackle ofmagic within her. She barked orders. “Get Elsa and find my husband. Meet me atthe pyramid as soon as possible. If we do not shed enough of the slaves’ bloodtonight, then our own blood may be forfeit.” She narrowed her eyes. “I hope thatgives you enough incentive. Now go!” As they all scattered, she shouted afterthem, “Drag Maxim here if necessary.”When the chamber fell silent again after their fading footsteps down the stairs,she could hear the distant murmuring uproar through the high open windows, theshouts in the streets, the tumult of battle. She went to stare out at the greatgulf to the city below. Spreading fires moved from house to house down in thelower levels near the warehouses and the yaxen slaughter yards. Unruly brutes,she thought. How could such people set fire to their own homes, as if freedommeant more than their lives, their shelter, their possessions?Thora clenched her pale fist to pull the threads of her magic tight, likegarrote wires.She heard a rustling sound and looked up to see a figure emerge from the sidepassageway, near the frozen statue of Lani. “Sending out a search party isalways a wasted effort, my dear.” She recognized Maxim’s voice. “I am alreadyhere.” He stepped out wearing scuffed and rumpled gray robes, unlike his usualblack pantaloons and colorful silk shirt.“Where have you been?” she demanded. “Ildakar needs you. I need you!”When he emerged into the light, she saw that his face was lined with red scabs,deep cuts that were quickly but sloppily healed with magic, leaving a webworklike shattered glass.“What have you done to yourself? Have you been out in the fighting? And why areyou wearing…”Then Thora saw what he held in his hand: an oval mirror shaped like afeatureless mask. It, too, was cracked in several places—a pattern of lines thatmatched the cuts on his face.“Oh, I have been busy, my dear. Can’t you hear the fruits of my handiwork?Thanks to Nicci, this response is far more exuberant than I had hoped for. Farmore entertaining!”Cold dread seeped into her. “You? It’s not possible! You are Mirrormask?”“That’s my other identity.” As Maxim stepped closer he couldn’t stop himselffrom grinning, which made him wince from the half-healed cuts on his face. “Fora thousand years, as sovrena you held on to the power in this city. You and Iwere supposed to rule together, as partners, as equals, but you rapidlydominated me. I didn’t care for the longest time, and when I did care, it wastoo late.”His grin widened. “Then I found another great source of power in Ildakar, anunexpected army that was all too willing to do anything I asked, so long as Ipromised them pretty-sounding rewards like freedom and equality.” He held up hiscracked reflective mask. “Ah, it was amazing! I understand why you relish powerso much. I didn’t expect that I would enjoy the experience so much when Idirected my followers to kill your dear lover Avery.”Her eyes flashed, and heat rushed to her cheeks. The words caught in her throat,as if they turned to ice, unspoken.“We needed to make a statement, another guard to be killed, and the highcaptain’s death had such an impact.” He drew a breath. “You should have seenyour face!”She wanted to claw his eyes out, but when she lunged, he knocked her back with ablow of magic. He raised his voice. “Yes, just like you fought back against thesorceress Nicci, showing us all your power. It was most impressive—and I’m sureyou will be glad to know that I am the one who healed her. My followers foundher, nursed her back to health. She plays a key role in what is happening now.”Fury surged within her, but Maxim seemed aloof and unconcerned. “After tonight,my dear wife, I will have it all—or there won’t be any city left.” He shrugged.“I can live with either outcome. If Ildakar falls … well, I have been curiousabout the outside world for some time.”Finally, Thora lunged forward, hatred boiling within her. “You did this! You’retrying to destroy my city, my perfect city!”“Yes.” He laughed. “Marvelous and diverting, isn’t it?”She flung her hand without even thinking, hurling her anger and her gift in acrackling ball of thorny lightning. It blazed toward him, swelling in the air,but Maxim blasted back, slapping her with a wall of sound that nearly deafenedher, made her entire skull ring.With a second gesture, he made a shock wave rumble through the blue marble tilesat her feet, cracking them like spiderwebs, creating a wide fissure in thefloor. Thora nearly lost her footing, but she sprang back to the steps of thedais. She hurled fire at him, which he sent tumbling into the stone statue ofLani before it ricocheted out through the windows.“I will destroy you!” she screamed.Maxim screwed up his expression, sent a wave of magic, and she felt her handsharden, her fingers stiffen. When she tried to bend her arms, she looked down inhorror to see a hard powdery grayness seeping through her skin.“Damn you!” she shouted, and focused all of her gift on fighting back, pushingthe petrification out of her body. That gave Maxim—Mirrormask—just long enoughto dance away.He shouted as he fled, “Ildakar will fall, Thora, but I was done with the cityanyway. I’ll leave now.” He threw his cracked mirror mask on the floor, smashingit. The curved pieces shattered into large sharp fragments that shattered againand again into increasingly smaller bits that rose upward in a gush ofreflective, sparkling steam. Enhanced by his magic, it filled the room with aglittery, obfuscating cloud.Thora used her gift to purge the stone spell from her flesh. When the shimmeringmist faded away, she saw that Maxim had escaped.Alone in the ruling tower, she screamed."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 76 [contents.xhtml#c_ch76]Set by reckless slaves without any encouragement from Mirrormask, fires burnedthrough the streets. Monstrous animals prowled through dark alleys, moreinterested in escaping their tormentors than in mauling civilians. The mayhemmade Ildakar dangerous and uncertain, with half of the people driven to a mobfrenzy to win their freedom, and the other half cowering inside their homes.Nicci glanced over at Bannon as they hurried through the streets. The youngswordsman’s bare chest and arms were flecked with blood; his long ginger hairflew back wildly, clumped and tangled, moist with perspiration. He held Sturdyin his right hand, but he seemed withdrawn, isolated from the mayhem around him.Ian’s death had affected him deeply.“There will always be a cost, Bannon,” she said, “and some will always pay morethan others.”“I hope Adessa rots down in the bottom of that fighting pit.” Bannon looked ather, his expression unreadable. “We all started this, Sorceress. Now we have tofinish it.”Uneasy with so many people around, Mrra padded along, staying close to Nicci.Near the devastation of the fleshmancer’s mansion and the crumbled bell tower,they unexpectedly came upon Nathan. The tall wizard looked astonished, even alittle embarrassed, with stone dust covering his white robes, his face, and hislong hair. Broken buildings were on every side, collapsed pillars, bricksscattered around like stone raindrops. The massive bronze bell, now silent, layon its side among the debris of bricks and shattered timbers.Seeing Nathan alive, Nicci felt emotions swirl through her, excitement andrelief with an intensity that surprised her. Bannon cried out when he recognizedhis mentor, “Nathan! Sweet Sea Mother, what did you do here?” He stared at allthe rubble.The wizard blinked at him. “Why, I saved the city, my boy. Can’t you see?” Helooked down at his hands again, then turned back to Bannon, as if trying tounderstand what he saw. “You’re wearing nothing but a loincloth.”“It’s all they allowed us down in the training pits.” Bannon threw himselfforward and embraced Nathan. The wizard wrapped his arms around him, and theypounded each other on the back. “I’m so glad to see you again.”Nathan glanced up with renewed surprise. “And Nicci, you look lovely asalways—and not at all dead. That’s a very pleasant surprise. You don’t seem tohave a scratch.”“Because I did not let anyone scratch me tonight,” she said. Next to her, Mrrathrashed her tail.“Of course you didn’t.” He grinned. “By the way, I have my gift back.”Nicci glanced around at the complete devastation in the buildings. “I can seethat.”Elsa came up beside him, adjusting her tattered purple robes. The gifted womanwiped at her face, doing nothing more than smear the blood and dust. “We wouldhave been doomed, if not for Nathan. The Ixax warrior would have destroyed usall, but he found his gift and defeated the monster.”“Nathan is good at things like that,” Bannon said, “even when he doesn’t havemagic.”“I am glad to have my magic again, regardless,” Nathan said, “because I don’tseem to have my sword at the moment.”“We could go get it,” Bannon said. “It’s probably up in the grand villa.”“No time for the sword, and no need for it,” Nicci said. “We have to get to thepyramid and free the hundreds of slaves before the sovrena commences herbloodworking.”Elsa stammered, “Y-Yes, Sorceress, I agree. I never wanted all that death, allthat blood in the first place. Such a sacrifice might have been necessarycenturies ago to defend against General Utros, but right now the sovrena justwishes to trap us outside of time. She’ll have all of eternity to shape Ildakarinto the society she wants, with every one of us under her thumb.”Nathan placed a warm hand on Elsa’s shoulder. “I’m very proud of you, my dear.And with my gift restored, I’m one of the most powerful wizards in Ildakar. Ifyou fight by my side, along with Nicci and Bannon, how can we lose?”Nicci was determined, but not naive. “There are always ways to lose, Wizard. Letus not look for one.”The uprising grew, and Nicci had no idea where to find Mirrormask, but shedidn’t need his charismatic yet aloof leadership anymore. She was in controlnow, and she would guide the rebels to victory. This was not a game, and shewould not let the mysterious masked leader play them all. “Come, we don’t havemuch time.” As she began to run, she ignited a blazing ball of fire above heroutstretched hand, like a beacon. “Rebels, follow me!”Nathan took up the shout. “For Nicci! We have to free the slaves.”Many of the rebels were too caught up in their own personal rampage to look atthe bigger picture. They fought for their lives against the city guards, whomade a stand, but even though the guards’ armor and weapons were superior, theunruly lower classes broke their ranks. Some of the guards even cast off theirhelmets and fought alongside the downtrodden people.Bannon waved his sword, shouting at the top of his lungs. Other shirtlessfighters joined him, running with an easy grace they had learned from theirtraining. Mrra bounded ahead, snarling at anyone who got in their way.Nicci rallied the rebels as they raced up the streets toward the high levels ofthe city. “We have to stop the bloodworking, before the council members trap ushere forever!”They passed orchards and hanging gardens, olive groves and trellised vineyards.She glanced back to see the hundreds of dirt- and blood-smeared followers thatcrowded up after her. The people looked to her with hope, with faith. She wasreminded of the earnest citizens who had fought together to overthrow theImperial Order in Altur’Rang—Victor, Ishaq, and so many who had followed herdesperate plan. Nicci’s heart felt strong as she realized that these Ildakaranfollowers were here because they chose to be. They were willing to shed theirown blood for this glorious goal, not because they were commanded to, butbecause they wanted to.In the streets below, she saw countless figures moving in the flickering lightof hungry fires. Although the gigantic stone army of General Utros covered theplain outside the walls, hundreds of thousands strong, the greatest enemy ofIldakar lay under the protective shroud. Sovrena Thora. That one woman hadcaused more damage and pain than any invading army.Nicci’s followers reached the city’s highest level, where countless giftednobles had already gathered. Some of them anticipated the spectacle of theritual, while others sought protection against the bloody chaos in the streets.At the edge of the plateau, the ruling tower stood tall and dark, while brightcelebratory lights surrounded the sacrificial pyramid.Seeing the ominous glow of ceremonial fires, the rebels rushed forward, howlingfor revenge. Mrra let out an earsplitting roar. Nicci, Nathan, and Bannonreached the upper level, accompanied by their ally Elsa. The front ranks ofrebels obviously hoped to see Mirrormask waiting for them at their destination,ready for the great climax, but he was nowhere to be seen.It didn’t matter. Nicci led them now. “Free the sacrificial slaves, and theywill be our allies as well. We’ll increase the size of our army.”The frightened, gifted nobles of Ildakar stood together, trying to defendthemselves. Many summoned magic—flashes of fire, blasts of wind, even smalllightning bolts that lanced down at the oncoming horde.Though seven of her followers were struck down in the concerted attack, Niccididn’t slow her pace. She summoned a blast of wind like a hurricane, knockingover a dozen frightened nobles, but others redoubled their attack, hurlingmagical blasts at the oncoming mob.Nathan touched Nicci’s shoulder and offered her a quirk of a smile. “Allow me,Sorceress. It’ll feel so good to exercise my abilities.”He extended his hands in front of him, palms pressed together, and snapped hisarms apart. With the full force of his gift, he parted the crowded nobles andcleaved open a path all the way to the base of the pyramid. Mrra bounded ahead,and Nicci ran forward, followed by Bannon and Elsa.When they reached the base, she saw hundreds of naked men and women held inpens, crowded on the wide platforms of the stair-stepped pyramid. The barricadeslooked flimsy, and the sacrificial slaves could easily have escaped, but theywere cowed, drugged into complacency.Nicci ran up the steps, reaching the first group of slaves. They huddled,muttering wordlessly among themselves. All were gaunt and starving, because oncethey had been culled out of the ranks and set aside to be slaughtered, Ildakarwould not have wasted any resources to feed them. Sovrena Thora just needed themalive for the bloodworking.Nicci was startled to recognize an old woman among them. She remembered Melba,the slave who always brought fresh bread down into the tunnels. Now Nicciunderstood why the woman had not joined them for several days. She must havebeen taken, gathered with these other slaves for the great bloodworking. Nicci’sanger grew even sharper.“Why don’t they run?” Bannon said, swinging his sword to frighten away askittish nobleman. “They could all get away without much effort. They shouldjust fight!”“It is the perfume of the peaceflower,” Elsa explained. “The red wisterias keepthem docile, like herd animals.”Nicci saw that silver-coated bleeding troughs had been placed on every level,with channels leading up the slope to the complex spell-form on top of thepyramid. Hundreds of the slaves could be butchered at once, their blood flowinginto catchbasins from which it would be drawn through magical compulsion intothe proper patterns.Nicci knew that if they could be roused, the slaves would be hungry andmaddened, ready to shed blood—like the tormented animals in the combat pits.Mrra padded next to her, growling.Elsa said, “We can awaken them using the gift. Simply release a flow of energy,and that will vitalize them.”“We can counteract the soporific effects of that perfume,” Nathan said. Heextended his hand, looked down at his outstretched fingers, and closed his eyes.Elsa followed his motions, added her gift as well.Nicci stared up the steep steps toward the pyramid’s apex, where she saw threefigures on the top platform: wizards Quentin and Damon beside the icy SovrenaThora, who glared down at the rabble. Wizard Commander Maxim was not with them.Nicci knew where to focus her attention.The hundreds of sacrificial slaves blinked their eyes, raised their hands, andturned to one another, gasping, groaning, and raising their voices in angryconfusion. Bannon ran to throw open the first flimsy barricade that held themthere. “We freed you—now fight alongside us. We can end this oppression once andfor all.”The awakened slaves did not need further instructions. They cheered, some inheavily accented voices. They had been captured wherever the Norukai raids tookplace, all across the Old World, and others had been drawn from the ranks ofIldakaran house slaves. Eager to get out, they broke down the corral walls andswarmed alongside the rest of the rebels. Even Melba was with them, shouting.Bannon flushed. “Sweet Sea Mother, they listened to me!”“Get them away from the pyramid, my boy!” Nathan called. “I don’t think it’ll besafe up here in a few minutes.”Concerned for her sister panther, Nicci sent Mrra after them. The big cat wasgrowling and restless, but Nicci did not want to bring her panther up to the topof the pyramid. With a thrash of her tail, Mrra leaped down to join Bannon andthe milling slaves.With Elsa following them, Nicci and Nathan ran up the steep stone stairs of thepyramid. Nicci was the first to reach the top, where Thora stood ready to faceher with murder in her eyes. Quentin and Damon remained nervously on either sideof the sovrena, near the complex apparatus of crucibles, mirrors, and rotatingprisms, all of which sustained the shroud of eternity.Nicci stepped forward, her eyes locked on Thora’s sea-green gaze. “We will stopyour blood magic, as I should have done the first time. We will tear down theshroud.”The other woman clenched her hands, and her looped, braided hair writhed aroundher head as she summoned the immensity of her gift. “Not if I stand before you!I defeated you before, and I’ll defeat you again.”Nicci called on her own magic. “Do I look defeated? I was hoping you would fightback. Just you and me.” She climbed a step higher. “Where is your husband?”“He is a coward. And a traitor!”Elsa called to her fellow duma members, “Damon, Quentin, you can’t support herin this. Do you wish to be trapped here forever? Do you want to see so muchblood spilled just so we can hide from the rest of the world? There’s no longerany need!”Nicci called down lightning. Summoning both Additive and Subtractive Magic,drawing on the dark techniques she had learned when she served the Keeper, aswell as the power she had stolen from wizards she had killed, Nicci pulled blacklightning out of the air, calling it from beneath the barely visible domeoverhead. Crackling bolts sliced down to strike the top of the pyramid andsplintered into a dozen equally destructive bolts. Woven within the dark bolt,Additive Magic generated more traditional lightning. A second searing blastripped open the carefully inlaid spell-forms on the top platform.With a cry of dismay, Thora lashed out with her own writhing mass of electricalenergy, which Nicci deflected. A storm of static sizzled up into the sky,spinning out and unraveling until it limned the boundary of the invisible dome.“You can’t have all the fun, Sorceress.” Nathan raised both of his fists,unleashing his reawakened gift in expanding spheres of wizard’s fire. The flamesroared across the apparatus, striking the crystal prisms and splitting, fanningout in multicolored fire that destroyed the contraptions.Side by side, the wizards Quentin and Damon threw up their own defensive shieldsto block the onslaught and reflect the fire back, nearly striking Thora. Itmight have been an accident, but Nicci couldn’t be sure. At the last instant,the sovrena called up wind herself and blocked the destruction. Gouts of flamesprayed in all directions, scattering the angry evacuating slaves.“Get the slaves out of here!” Nicci shouted down. “Make them retreat.”As Death’s Mistress, she had sent countless thousands of soldiers to theirdeaths for a cause that she had believed appropriate at the time. She had enoughblood on her hands that death no longer bothered her, but the people wereinnocents. They had been marked for sacrifice, and if she saved them fromslaughter only to let them become collateral damage in her battle with Thora,then that would be no worthwhile victory at all.Bannon took up the cry as he rushed the slaves in the other direction, joiningthe panicked nobles who were also flocking away from the pyramid.Nicci did not want anything to hold her back. She knew she was going to need allher strength.Quentin and Damon looked over at Elsa, saw the danger in Nicci’s face, anddecided they’d had enough. “We want no part of this, Sovrena,” Quentin cried,and he raced down the opposite set of stairs, followed by Damon.Nicci called down another braided bolt of lightning, and the explosion blastedthe top of the pyramid, wrecked the remnants of the spell-form, and shatteredthe upper platform. The impact hit Thora in an eruption of fire and pulverizedstone. The sovrena used her gift to encircle herself in a cocoon of smoke andlight, spinning as she tumbled away from the blast, vanishing from the pyramid.Nicci couldn’t see her as the clouds of destruction spread in all directions.Nathan clasped her shoulder and said, “Together, we have enough power to levelthis structure once and for all.”“That would be a good idea, Wizard.”They retreated down to the base of the pyramid, gathering their magic for afinal attack. From the bottom level, Nathan launched more wizard’s fire in a hotfury that ate away the mammoth blocks, sizzling through the stone platforms,breaking the pyramid to the core.Running backward, Elsa pointed up at the sky. “Look, it’s changing! It’sfading.”The stars overhead rippled as the watery dome began to thin and dissipate. Thecrowds below shouted, cheered, or wailed. “The shroud! The shroud is falling!”Others took up the chant.Nicci was glad. “That is exactly what I intended to do.”“And we have succeeded,” Nathan said.Together, she and Nathan—with assistance from Elsa—called down all the fury oftheir gift: explosions and fireballs, lightning bolt after lightning bolt. Forlong minutes, the awed crowds on top of the plateau, both gifted nobles andrebel slaves, watched the outpouring of destructive power.The towering pyramid, one of the most imposing structures in Ildakar, becamenothing more than broken, smoldering rubble, veiled by clouds of smoke thatdrifted away into the tension of the night.A bright glint shone in Nathan’s azure eyes. “We’re not done yet, are we?”Nicci turned from the ruined pyramid to the high ruling tower. “No, too muchstill remains.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 77 [contents.xhtml#c_ch77]Wizard Renn was astonished when the optimistic Captain Trevor proved himselfright—that they would indeed find Cliffwall. Despite his proclaimed confidence,though, the guard captain seemed just as surprised to stumble upon theirdestination.Weary, footsore, and hungry, having lost three men along the way, the groupplodded along the rocky bottom of a high-walled canyon until they reached a deadend. Ignoring the groans of disappointment from the men behind him, the captainwent to the stone wall and leaned against the cool slickrock. “At least there’sshade.” He shook his head. “We’ll rest before we retrace our steps.”He accidentally discovered a crack that led through the towering wall and intoanother network of canyons beyond. Renn followed. As the sky opened up abovethem, they heard running water, saw green meadows, terraced gardens—andbuildings erected inside cliff alcoves high above … an actual city hidden here.Farther down the canyon, he saw horses, groups of men, lines of tents, a largeencampment of some sort.“This is Cliffwall,” Trevor said. “It has to be.”Renn discovered energy again, and he suddenly realized he wasn’t ready for suchan important meeting. Self-consciously, he brushed down his ragged and stainedrobes and released his gift, drawing on magic to freshen up the cloth, brightenthe maroon dye, neaten the tattered hems. “We must look presentable when wereclaim Cliffwall in the name of Ildakar.” With a gesture, he released the magicinto Captain Trevor and the other guards, polishing their armor, removing thedust from their faces, cleaning their hair.“There,” he said, satisfied, “you look fresh and intimidating now.”“Why couldn’t you have done that days ago?” complained one of the guards. “We’vebeen miserable.”“Because it wasn’t necessary,” Renn said. “Come, if this is Cliffwall, we haveour orders.”Renn, Trevor, and the guards hurried into the canyon, where they were soondiscovered. When natives came up to greet them, Renn took charge, resplendent inhis clean maroon robes. He placed himself in front of Captain Trevor so theothers would know who was in charge. “I am the wizard Renn, and this is myescort. We journeyed long and hard to find Cliffwall. I would speak with yourleaders. It is an urgent matter.”“We’ll take you there,” said one of the farmers. “Now that the archives havebeen opened again, we were told to expect many gifted visitors.”Renn was unhappy that after the toll of the arduous journey, their arrivalwasn’t treated as something more significant. “You haven’t been expecting anyvisitors like me,” he said.They stared up at the huge alcove that held towering stone-fronted structures.Renn nodded and said to Trevor, “It’s not like Ildakar, but at least it’scivilization, and there’s plenty of water and food. It will do.”The relieved guards muttered their agreement. “Take us up there,” Renninstructed.The farmers guided the group to the base of a narrow trail that woundprecariously up to the sheer wall, but none of the locals showed any interest infollowing them up there. “The path is clear. At the main entrance of the largesttower, you’ll find scholars who can help you.”Captain Trevor thanked the man. Pulling his maroon robes close so he wouldn’ttrip on them, Renn set his gaze forward and trudged up the steep path, showingno nervousness about the sheer drop-off. After climbing high above the canyonfloor, they reached the immense alcove filled with buildings. Trevor and hisweary men gawked at the stone façades, the tall windows of colored glass, theperfect arch over the main entryway.Gathering his courage, Renn pushed his way to the tall arch. Thick, dark-stainedwooden doors stood open on massive hinges, welcoming visitors inside. Wrappinghis grandeur around him like a cloak, reminding himself that he was a respectedmember of the wizards’ duma of Ildakar, Renn strode into the huge echoing foyerof the outermost archive building. Captain Trevor and his nine men followedclose at his heels.Inside, Renn looked at the polished marble pillars veined with brown and gold,which held up the arched ceiling. Bright magical lights glowed from sconces andalcoves in the walls. People in scholars’ robes moved about, often reading booksas they walked. They looked up at the unexpected visitors.Standing in the open hall, Renn summoned a bright flame in his hand todemonstrate his gift and announced himself in a loud voice. “I am the wizardRenn, a member of the ruling council of Ildakar. I have come here on a mission,escorted by these brave men, to reclaim what is ours.”“And what is yours?” asked an older, distinguished woman. Her dark curly hairwas shot through with strands of gray. She glided out of a side passage. “I amPrelate Verna of the Sisters of the Light.”She was accompanied by a man wearing military armor and an insignia of astylized “R” that Renn did not recognize—probably some pompous minor dictator,like Emperor Kurgan had been. The military man looked at them with his darkeyes, his expression shadowed with suspicion.Renn stated his business. “We demand that you turn over all the knowledge inthis archive to its rightful owners—the city of Ildakar.”Prelate Verna looked more surprised than terrified. She placed her hands on herhips. Flushing a deep bronze, the military man beside her raised his voice andcalled for his own soldiers.Verna faced Renn and said, “Then I am afraid we have a problem.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 78 [contents.xhtml#c_ch78]Carried along by rage as well as adrenaline, Thora fled the destruction of thepyramid and took refuge in the ruling tower, her last bastion of strength. Notonly had the bloodworking been disrupted, but the shroud that protected andpreserved Ildakar was gone.The sovrena’s heart was as broken as the great structure had been. Her perfectsociety was crumbling. Her power was shattered, her grip on the city failing.It was already too late—she knew—but she refused to accept defeat. Marchingacross the broken blue tiles, she climbed the dais and flung herself into herthrone. She squeezed the wooden armrests so tightly, unconsciously releasing atrickle of her gift, that the chair itself cracked. “I am the sovrena!” sheshouted to the empty room.Her words echoed back at her, mocking.Behind her, the golden cages hung silent. All of Thora’s larks were dead, dozensof them. Her only audience was the petrified statue of the sorceress Lani. Shelooked at the white sculpture, the defiant woman frozen in place. Thoramuttered, “If you could see me through those stone eyes, you would be gloatingnow, wouldn’t you?”Quentin and Damon had been with her on top of the pyramid, facing the mob, butthey had fled. She needed their power, their gift, and together they could makea last stand at her side. She was their sovrena; she deserved their loyalty. Butshe doubted she would have it.She would be alone in her stand against a group of desperate lower-classhooligans. And Nicci. She had defeated the sorceress before, and now Thora hadeven more incentive to do it again, to crush Nicci into a smear of bone andflesh. But as she looked across the expansive ruling chamber, her gaze caught onthe shattered blue marble tiles from where Maxim had fought her, and thatfocused her anger to a razor edge. Maxim—Mirrormask!—was the cause of this. Herhusband had been building the unrest, riling up the easily duped mobs.Cold air whistled in and out of her nostrils. Her heart pounded, and her bodytingled with magic that demanded to be released, but she had no target. Yes, shehated how Nicci had defied her, but Maxim was her husband. Thora’s hatred forthe man went deeper than any possible reckoning. He wanted Ildakar to fall. Hehad said so, and now that he’d ignited the political brushfire sweeping throughthe city, he would bring down the order Thora had worked so hard to create.And he had simply fled. “I was done with the city anyway. I’ll leave now.”She knew Maxim was a coward. He wouldn’t stay to see the repercussions of whathe had caused. Now that the shroud was gone, he would run far away so he couldwatch the city topple from a safe distance. For his own amusement! How she hatedhim.Soft, slow footsteps came up the stairs, and Thora saw a female figure enter theruling chamber. For a moment she thought it was Nicci, come back to fight heragain. But the muscular woman was clad in scant black leather, her skin coveredwith branded symbols.Adessa.The morazeth was bloodied, battered. She had a deep wound on her back, and sheheld one arm out, the wrist drooping at an unnatural angle, but she gripped ashort sword in her other hand. Though she looked exhausted, a defiant sparkleremained in her eyes. “I’ve come to you, Sovrena. Ildakar has fallen, but I amhere to defend you. I will die by your side.”Thora walked down the dais. The woman smelled of sweat and dust and the sourmetal tang of drying blood. For a moment her anger softened, her heart feeling awarm spark of hope because of Adessa’s unwavering loyalty, a loyalty that didnot fade because of riots in the streets or the fall of the shroud. No, themorazeth were sworn to defend the city. More important, the morazeth were hers.Adessa was hers.“I would have come sooner, but I was trapped at the bottom of the spiked pit …with this.” She lifted her broken wrist, refusing to show any sign of pain.Thora frowned. “How did you get out? Did someone release you?”“I climbed.”“Of course you did.”She thought of the folly of making a fruitless last stand here. Would anyonedefend her? Anyone besides Adessa? For a strange unprovoked instant, she nearlyreached out to embrace the warrior woman, but stopped herself. “I would be gladto have you at my side, but if you die with me, what would that accomplish?”“It would be satisfactory in and of itself, Sovrena.”“Maybe so, but I’d prefer to use you for something more important.”“We are not dead yet,” Adessa said. “We have not lost.”But Thora knew they had lost. Once, the wizards of Ildakar would have bandedtogether, putting aside their petty differences for the sake of the city, fortheir people, and for their future. But not now. These treacherous people wantedonly to tear down. Her lower lip curled at the thought. They didn’t deserveIldakar.Maxim was the cause of it, and now he was escaping from the city, thrilled withhis stupid accomplishment. Even though Thora knew it would not help her, shewould arrange one separate personal victory.She reached out to take the other woman’s broken wrist. Adessa showed only thefaintest flinch, but Thora held tightly, straightened the hand, the brandedskin, the snapped bone. She let her gift glide into the other woman, bypassingthe powerful defensive runes, and allowing healing magic to knit the wristtogether again, making the bone as strong as new.Adessa gave her a small, grateful nod. She shifted her sword back to herdominant hand. “Now I can fight better.”But Thora shook her head. “I am sending you away, Adessa. There is something youmust do. An important quest.”The morazeth stood ramrod straight, refusing to move. “No, I will protect you.”“I will protect myself—this is my battle. You have something more important todo. When triumph escapes our grasp, all we have left is revenge.”Adessa tensed. “In what manner, Sovrena?”“My husband caused this. Maxim ignited the fires of this revolt. He must pay forthe damage he’s done.”The other woman blinked. “How can that be true? He is the wizard commander.”“He is Mirrormask!”Adessa took a step backward. “How … how is that possible?”“I know it for a fact.” She explained what had occurred, indicated the shatteredblue marble floor tiles. “Maxim has fled the city. He thinks he has won. Hemocks all of Ildakar—and he cannot be allowed to get away with it.”From the fire in her deep brown eyes, Thora could see that Adessa was just asoutraged. “What do you wish me to do, Sovrena? Command me, and I will not restuntil I have succeeded in the mission.”“Kill him. Leave the city, now, and hunt him down. I don’t care if you have totrack him across the Old World itself, but bring his head back to Ildakar. Nomatter what else happens here, the people of this city must see that the wizardcommander has met justice.”She gave a curt nod. “I will not fail in this. If you truly command me to leave,now, then I will go out this night. I will find him.”“And kill him,” Thora added.“And kill him. I will cut off his head and bring it back to Ildakar.”Thora began to feel calmer, more resigned. This, at least, was satisfying. Sheknew that Adessa would do exactly as she promised. “Do not underestimate hispowers. Your spell brands will protect you, but he has other tricks. You willneed great strength.”“I have another source of power,” said Adessa. “It is unexpected, but usefulnow.” She looked Thora squarely in the eye. “You know that the champion was mylover? I allowed him to plant his seed in me, and I am now carrying a child. Itgrows within me even now.”Thora let out a long slow sigh, feeling a shiver. She knew what had to be done,the secret power the morazeth possessed. “Yes, Adessa, I am fully aware why yourwomen let themselves become pregnant. It is an unparalleled source of energy.Against Maxim, you will need it. I command you to work your special magic. Letit be done.”The morazeth nodded. “It is a dark sacrifice, but I will become stronger—strongenough to find and kill the wizard commander.”A sense of urgency scattered her satisfaction. Thora swallowed. “You’d betterhurry. The others will be coming soon.”Adessa closed her dark eyes in deep concentration. She stood with her arms ather sides, then brought her hands to her abdomen, covering her navel, touchingthe skin over her stomach.While the morazeth were branded and protected with spell runes on their skin,each woman retained a special kind of blood magic, one fueled by the blood of anabsolute innocent, an unborn child growing in her womb. Blood magic sprang fromthe taking of life, and a morazeth’s blood magic came from taking the life ofone growing inside her.Adessa breathed faster. Sweat sparkled on her skin, and a flush came to hercheeks. As she touched and kneaded her abdomen, her fingers glowed. She directedher magic inward, and her womb drank deeply of the unborn child, reabsorbing it,taking that life and pulling it back inside her body.Adessa’s skin crackled and shimmered with increasing energy. As Thora watched,the warrior woman throbbed with power.When she opened her eyes and let out a long sigh, Adessa said, “It is done. Inow have the strength of two lives within me. I am powerful enough to defeateven the wizard commander.”For the first time that night, Thora let herself smile. Adessa seemed soconfident, so swollen with unnatural energy, that she nearly reconsidered. Maybeshe should keep the morazeth at her side. With a fighter like that, just the twoof them could defend against a whole city of rebels. Perhaps they could drivethem back.But it would be a short-lived victory, Thora knew. Even though magical attackswould bounce off of Adessa, the hundreds of ravening mob members would stilltear her apart.No, even in defeat Thora wanted to accomplish something. She wanted her revenge.She wanted Maxim’s head.“Go,” she said.Adessa sprinted away, and in a moment, she was gone from the tower, leaving thesovrena alone in the ruling chamber.Outside, Thora could hear the fires, shouts, and screams as the revoltcontinued. Even after destroying the pyramid and dissolving the shroud, theywere not done.Thora knew they were coming for her."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 79 [contents.xhtml#c_ch79]Standing at the rubble of the pyramid, Nicci looked up into the night sky to seethe strange constellations. Now the stars shone clearly without the hazy bubblethat had sealed Ildakar away from time.Mrra paced back and forth near Nicci, satisfied but still restless. Stillhungry.Exuberant crowds gathered in the highest levels of the city, with more groupsstreaming up from the streets below. Nathan stood next to Nicci, his eyesshining, his long white hair flowing elegantly. His chest was full, his chinheld high; he exuded the true presence of a wizard.Nicci pointed toward the ruling tower. “That is where we have to go. We erasedthe shroud and stopped the bloodworking, but Sovrena Thora still must pay forher crimes.”“Indeed.” Nathan stroked his smooth chin. He sounded more than pleased to havehis gift back. “It is the best way to wipe the slate clean so that Ildakar canmake a new legend for itself.”The crowds of slaves cheered, calling out her name. “Nicci! Nicci!”Bannon raised his sword and started another cheer, and others took up the chant.“For Ildakar! For Ildakar!” Mrra let out a roar.Many gifted nobles had fled down into the city, away from the upper plateau.None of them could match the power of Nicci or Nathan, nor could they withstandthe anger of the crowds. In the coming days, Nicci assumed many of them wouldinsist they had always resented Sovrena Thora’s repressive ways, and it wouldreadily become apparent which ones had been kind masters who treated theirservants fairly as human beings.As they marched together toward the ruling tower, Nathan glanced at her andcocked his eyebrows. “Sorceress, I believe you have a smile on your face. Itlooks quite unusual. What are you thinking?”Nicci flicked her blue eyes toward him. “I was imagining what kind of receptionthe Norukai slavers will receive the next time their serpent ships come toIldakar. We might have an interesting welcome for their King Grieve.”Bannon let out a hard laugh. “Sweet Sea Mother, they’ll be in for a surprise.”Nicci stalked forward, her black dress flowing around her. “For now, we havebusiness to complete. The sovrena will have gone there.”The crowd roared, hundreds of them following her. Nicci worried what Thora woulddo when she was cornered like a tortured rat, but Nicci felt confident her magicwould be more than a match for the sovrena’s.Elsa accompanied them, refusing to leave Nathan’s side. “I am a proud member ofthe duma. We are sworn to do what’s right for Ildakar. I think we’ve forgottenthat.”“Will we have to fight Quentin and Damon as well?” Nicci asked, trying to planher strategy. “And what about Wizard Commander Maxim? If they all join thesovrena, they will pose a substantial threat against us.”Elsa tucked a gray-brown strand of hair behind her ear. “Quentin and Damon arepowerful, but not ambitious. They have no wish to be as important as thesovrena.”“But are they loyal to her?” Nicci asked. “Will they fight for her?”“I don’t believe so.” Elsa looked at Nathan, then back at Nicci. “For many yearsthey were unwilling to challenge her, as you did.”“What about Maxim?” Nathan asked. “He might be the biggest threat we face.”“He was nowhere to be found all night,” Elsa said.“Maxim hates his wife, and I doubt he would die at her side. If need be, we willfight and defeat him as well,” Nicci said. “Let us hope it doesn’t come tothat.”As the crowd marched toward the tower, Nicci saw the other two wizards standingat the tower doorway looking nervous. Damon stroked his long mustaches. Quentinlooked dusty in his deep blue robes. Stone powder smeared his dark skin, but hiseyes looked anxious. They didn’t flinch as Nicci, Nathan, and Elsa strode towardthem, leading the large crowd of followers.“Our business is with Sovrena Thora,” Nicci said. “Will you join us, or will youget in our way?” Mrra remained at her side, muscles rippling under her tawnyfur.Bannon lifted Sturdy. “You’d better not get in our way.”Sounding contrite, Damon said, “Like trees, we bend with the wind. And we canfeel which way the wind blows.”Quentin nodded. “And a tree that is too old and too rigid will break in a storm.Mirrormask certainly unleashed a storm.” Both of the wizards looked down andaway. Quentin glanced at Elsa. “Is this the future?”“With the shroud gone, Ildakar must become different,” Elsa said. “We can helpmake it different, or we will break it further.”“This is still my home,” Damon said.“Ildakar is home to all of us!” shouted one of the freed slaves behind Bannon.“You can all live together,” Nicci said, then hardened her voice. “Or you candie.”The two wizards spread their hands. “Then why don’t we all live? Let us go seethe sovrena.”They entered the ruling tower with Nicci and the others following. The angrycrowd noise continued to grow louder as the flood of people entered the immensetower. Nicci moved with a deliberate pace, building her magic, feeling thestrength within her. She still had the daggers at her hips, but she wouldn’tneed them. She had her gift, and she had herself.The big cat walked at her side as they climbed the wide waterfall of stairs,ascending higher and higher until Nicci, Nathan, and the other three wizardsspilled into the large ruling chamber, followed by countless others. Glowinglights hung on the walls, illuminating the expansive, empty room.Thora sat by herself on her throne in front of two cages full of dead birds. Shesaid in an icy voice, “So, you have brought your foolish followers here todestroy what remains of the glory of Ildakar? This does not surprise me.”Nicci walked across the broken blue marble floor, her eyes locked on thesovrena’s. “Your own rule is what destroyed the majesty of Ildakar. You have noone to blame but yourself.”“I blame who I choose,” the sovrena snapped; then her voice faltered as her gazeflicked away. “I blame my husband. I blame Mirrormask.”The crowds swelling behind Nicci muttered. She frowned. “What are you saying?Where is the wizard commander?”“Maxim is Mirrormask! He betrayed me. He betrayed the city.” Then her eyesflashed past them to skewer Elsa, Quentin, and Damon. “And I blame you! You weremembers of the duma. You were supposed to protect Ildakar.”“That is what we’re doing,” Elsa said. “We must reconstitute the council—withoutyou.”“Yes,” Damon said, stepping forward next to Elsa. “We will remove you from yourposition, Sovrena.”“Her name is just Thora now,” said Quentin.Nicci faced the woman and spoke so that the crowd behind her could hear. Thehubbub fell quiet as her voice grew louder. “Now that the shroud is goneforever, this city has opened itself to the rest of the world. Ildakar willalways be free.” Her lips formed a smile as cheering erupted in the chamber.“Each of these people thought they were weak, that they were alone, but theyfought together—just as the ancient wizards of Ildakar did to protect this city.Now the battle is different, and you are the enemy, Thora.”“You are all fools!” Thora hissed.Nicci continued, “One person can change the city and bring it down.” She spreadher hands to indicate the crowd behind her. More and more people continued toclimb the stairs, filling the ruling chamber. “And we are one.”As she spoke, Nicci could imagine Richard rallying his armies against anunstoppable enemy. She knew this was what he would have wanted for Ildakar. Shehad followed his instructions. She had done her best.Nicci remembered the words the witch woman had written in Nathan’s life book.And the Sorceress shall save the world. Maybe that prediction had proven trueafter all. Maybe she indeed had saved the world … or at least this small part ofit.As Thora rose from her chair, threads of magic curled around her body like thewebs of some energized silkworms. “Do you all wish to fight me? I can bring thistower down around us.”Nicci raised her hand, summoning her gift. “Is that how you want this to end,Thora? I can defeat you. Now. Myself.”“No,” Elsa said, taking a step in front of Nicci. “You are from the outside,Nicci. You said again and again that you intend to leave Ildakar as soon as yourbusiness is finished here. And Nathan has reclaimed his gift.” She looked sadlyat the old wizard, who frowned. “So he will be going, too.”The older woman glanced at Quentin and Damon on either side of her. “This is amatter for the true rulers of Ildakar, for the remaining duma members—and thatis the three of us. We know the punishment that must be meted out. It has beenwell established.” Elsa raised her hands, curling her fingers. So did Damon andQuentin.Thora recoiled. “What are you doing?”“You know the price for treason against Ildakar, against its people and againstits leaders. We will impose it, by the law and by the gift vested in us.”Thora cringed. Her porcelain face grew even more pale. “You must not! I’llannihilate all of you.” She summoned her own gift, tightened the crawling energythreads around her body.Elsa continued, “Wizard Commander Maxim was the most adept at the petrificationspell, but we three together can release the magic as well.”Quentin said, “Thora, you will be a statue for all to see. We will never forgetthe damage you have done to our city.”“No!” Thora cried. She lashed out with her own magic, but the three unitedwizards of Ildakar brought up a shield that deflected the hissing bolts ofenergy.Nicci and Nathan threw up their own magical shields to protect the crowd behindthem as the destructive lashes sprayed everywhere, striking the walls,skittering along the floor. Bannon and the slaves standing behind him gasped,ducking from the attack, but did not run away. All these people were eager towitness the utter defeat of the evil sovrena.Nicci wanted to destroy Thora, grind her down until she was nothing but greasysmoke and a bad memory, but she respected the will of the duma members. It wastrue—she, Nathan, and Bannon would leave Ildakar soon, along with Mrra. Thisjustice belonged in the hands of the new rulers of Ildakar. Nicci certainly didnot intend to stay and become their new sovrena.Elsa, Damon, and Quentin stood shoulder-to-shoulder, pouring their gift into thepetrification spell.Thora weakened. She trembled. The yellow lacing of power skirled around her,then vanished like morning mist. She raised her hands in agony, and her skingrew whiter, stiffer. She placed her palms against her cheeks, horrified at whatwas happening.“No!” she cried. Her pale blue dress rippled, and she tried to take one laststep forward, as if she might find somewhere to run. Her skin became hard andgray, and with a sound like ice crackling on a frozen pond, Thora becameentirely petrified, a new statue.The audience remained silent for a moment, like a held breath, and then theycheered in their victory. The remaining duma members looked at one another,momentarily relieved, but clearly realizing their work had just begun.Nicci looked at Nathan and then at Bannon. She nodded in satisfaction. “Ibelieve that is what we came to do.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 80 [contents.xhtml#c_ch80]Maxim ran into the night, leaving the city far behind. The shroud was down, andthe whole world awaited him.Ildakar had been his home for countless centuries, and as the wizard commander,he possessed every power, every treasure, anything he could want. He had lovedhis city. He had helped build it, raising it up from the plain, moving the riverand the earth itself, and he had sacrificed much to protect it.Ah, he had been so young and naive.He had also been in love with beautiful Thora. He still recalled how happy hehad been when they were first married. Joy had exploded from him, a romance thathad nothing to do with the gift or any spell that he released. Thora had workeda different kind of spell on him. He had been infatuated, then deeply in love.The passion was immeasurable. He had felt drunk with the touch of her skin, thecurve of her breasts, the feel of her soft, warm thighs wrapped around him as heentered her and she arched her back. It had been so marvelous!What had he been thinking?Unlike the ridiculous songs that minstrels sang, there was no such thing as atrue love that lasted forever, of bonded soul mates whose every thought was fortheir partner, for whom each day, each moment apart was torture.No, even his remarkable delusional love for Thora had lasted no more than acentury or so. Even though she didn’t age and her body remained as perfectlyformed as ever, Maxim had come to find it less interesting. For a while, he haddiverted himself with lovely and pliable silk yaxen, but they quickly provedunsatisfying. So Maxim had his first real illicit lover, then his first tenillicit lovers, managing to keep them secret from his wife, although hesuspected she had taken lovers as well, growing just as discontented with him asa husband. Eventually, they expanded the pleasure parties, flaunting theiraffairs in front of each other, and Maxim soon found that he didn’t even care.He and Thora were bound together as sovrena and wizard commander, but his greatlove had turned to boredom, then apathy, and finally, twisted into along-simmering hatred. He had wanted to destroy her, to make her hurt, to makeher suffer.On a grander scale, his romance with Ildakar was much the same. In thebeginning, long before Emperor Kurgan tried to conquer the Old World, before thearmy of General Utros arrived, Maxim had loved this city. He was the one who haddeveloped the petrification magic as an invincible defense. He had worked thespell that turned all those invading soldiers into stone. He had taught theothers how to do it, but he controlled that potent magic.Bottled up under the shroud, Ildakar became stagnant and remained that way formany intolerable centuries. If one locked even the closest friends or lovers ina confined room, Maxim knew, they would grow to hate each other after enoughtime had passed.That was how Maxim had begun to feel about Ildakar. Yes, the city was still asbeautiful and unchanged as ever, but to him it was just a colorfully paintedcorpse. And corpses began to rot and stink. They needed to be burned on afuneral pyre.As Mirrormask, he had built that funeral pyre, and he had struck the spark toignite the tinder. Nicci had been his tool, and a very useful one.Now, as he continued to run beyond the walls, heading across the plain towardthe hills to the south, he followed the uplift and the bluffs that rose abovethe Killraven River. Maxim knew he had to finish the work he had begun.Ildakar needed to be destroyed. Although the rebellious slaves would prove to bean inconvenience for the rulers, they would do only superficial harm. Maximwanted to do more, and he had long ago thought of the perfect answer, though hehad always been too afraid to try it.Now he had nothing to lose.* * *Word traveled throughout the city of Ildakar of the defeat of Sovrena Thora andthe shocking revelation that Mirrormask was Wizard Commander Maxim himself. Theduma members, united now, sent out announcements commanding High Captain Stuartand all of the city guard to stop fighting against the rebellious slaves.The lower classes had risen up and now they looked at the damage they had done,the fires that burned in the poorer sections of the city. Instead of continuingto clash with the guards, the rebels worked together to stop the conflagrationfrom spreading and also to treat the wounded.Knowing that Mirrormask had escaped, his most vehement followers called forNicci, and she knew it was her responsibility to help calm the unrest. Afterleaving the ruling tower, she, Bannon, and Nathan went through the streets,calling out for peace and cooperation, asking the people to help in the name oftheir homes and of their future.Rendell and some of the other slaves kept calling out Nicci’s name. In her raspyvoice, old Melba even proclaimed that Nicci should become the new sovrena, butthe sorceress immediately quashed that idea. She held up her hand. “That is notfor me. I came here to help, and I came here for my friends. Ildakar is yourcity.”Mrra prowled about, making the people uneasy, but Nicci was sure to keep thesand panther under control.As they moved through the wrecked lower levels of the city, Nathan lifted hishands, releasing his gift to fling water from the fountains and a swirl of windto extinguish burning buildings. Nicci assisted him with her own magic to putout the worst of the fires.Although exhausted, Nicci used some of her remaining energy to heal the mostseriously injured, saving several people who would otherwise have died. Nathanknelt beside Elsa, both of them laying their hands on cuts and burns, soothingthe agony of the victims. He looked gray-faced but relieved. “The last time Itried to do this, with an injured man in Renda Bay, I caused a horrificbacklash. I am so glad to have … myself back.” Elsa placed her hands over his,and helped him heal the next victim.Bannon ran about, gathering water and rags for bandages, while the wounded werebrought to an open square for the doctors and gifted healers to tend them. Hewas eager to do everything he could to assist. Nicci knew the young man hadalways been self-sufficient.The air smelled of smoke and blood. He was startled when a battered young womanclad in black leather came up beside him, moving silently, and offered to help.Bannon jerked backward, blinking his hazel eyes. “Sweet Sea Mother! Lila!” Hereached for his sword, but the young morazeth kept her hands at her sides.“I am not fighting you anymore, Bannon. You were my student and my pet, butAdessa is gone now. I have different orders. The duma has decreed that we shouldall work together. And I decided I would like to work with you.” She raised hereyebrows and waited.He fumbled for words, and finally smiled. “I could use a hand bringing morebandages to the healers. Let’s help take care of the injured.”Lila was stiff and formal, awkward around him now. “I can help treat wounds.I’ve inflicted enough of them.”Nathan continued to work beside Elsa, and he warmly touched her arm. “I amimpressed by your determination and your magical skills, my dear. Now that Ihave my gift back, perhaps you can teach me the spell that turned the sovrena tostone. It might prove useful.”“I would be happy to teach you—if you stay,” she said.“We can stay for a day or two, surely?” said the white-haired wizard, lookingover at Nicci.“A day or two,” Nicci agreed, wiping bloody hands on her black dress, “butthere’s nothing more for us to do here. The city is now free. There’s no reasonfor us to stay. We should let these people pick up the pieces and rebuild.Perhaps they really will achieve a perfect society this time.”“Are you that anxious to go, Sorceress?” Nathan asked.She considered for a long moment. “Yes.”Bannon looked quickly at Lila, who had just returned with more bandages. Shestill made him very nervous. “No reason to stay,” he said. “The city is safe,and we need to find other adventures.”Though Nicci did not look forward to more days walking through the wilderness,camping on the hard ground, eating pack food, she knew that Mrra longed to beout roaming the plains and hunting. Beside her, sensing the thoughts throughtheir spell bond, the big cat let out a sound halfway between a growl and apurr. “Ildakar doesn’t need us anymore.”* * *With the city in the distance, its skyline glittering with lighted buildings andhigh towers in the darkness before dawn, Maxim paused as he heard the howl of aspiny wolf, joined by two more in a primal chorus. They were animals that hadescaped from the fighting pits, now running free far from the city—just as hewas free.Leaving the plain, he climbed the foothills beyond the last ranks of GeneralUtros’s petrified army: hundreds of thousands of armored soldiers. That greatforce had intended to lay siege to the city, to conquer Ildakar in the name ofIron Fang.Their motionless siege had lasted fifteen centuries, he thought with a smirk.Time for it to begin again.When he reached a high vantage point, he stopped and began to make preparations.He scuffed the dry grasses with his heel, exposing bare dirt so that he coulddraw symbols and spell-forms in the ground. He would have preferred to shed theblood of several slaves, but he had only his own. It would have to besufficient.Nearby in the shadows, he glimpsed a spotted feline form, a flash of golden eyesin the night, and heard a growl before the creature loped off, skittish aroundhumans. It must be one of the leopards Chief Handler Ivan had trained. Maximwaited, making sure the creature wouldn’t attack. Instead, it ran away.Getting back to his magic, he used the long curved knife designed forbloodworking sacrifices. Maxim—Mirrormask—scribed the proper markings in thedirt, slashed open his palm, and spilled droplets of red into the dust. Hisblood seeped in, forming a deep brown mud.The original bloodworking spell had required the deaths of thousands, endlesstroughs of blood poured out, hour after hour, for nearly two full days. Victimafter victim came … some of them unwilling, others freely offering themselves.And after all that, the wizards of Ildakar had succeeded. The rippling wave ofmagic had turned General Utros’s warriors to stone. It had saved the city.So much work, so much magic.But it was vastly more difficult to cast a powerful spell than to undo it, torescind the magic. The spell was already weakening.Once his blood had pattered throughout the newly carved spell-form, completingthe path of hot red liquid, he plunged the tip of the sacrificial dagger intothe center of the angles, the intersection of magic.Through his gift, Maxim felt the release, like an incredibly taut cord snappingin half, both ends flying apart with released energy. He broke the petrificationspell, all petrification spells, and revoked the magic. The consequences rippledacross the plain, flowing in a silent invisible wave over the city of Ildakar.Wizard Commander Maxim gasped and fell backward, laughing. It was glorious! Hecould feel the exhilaration. All that energy was no longer bound. The magicitself had waned after the star shift, and when the one stone warrior namedUlrich had spontaneously awakened, Maxim knew it could be done.Now he did it intentionally. He had cast the original spell himself, and todayhe uncast it.He wished he could remain behind to watch, but he had no interest in being apart of this. He had already done what he needed to do. Oh no, there would benothing left of Ildakar. Pleased with himself, Maxim ran into the hills,thinking of the rest of the Old World and all the interesting things thatawaited him there.Across the plain outside of Ildakar, hundreds of thousands of stone warriorsbegan to thaw and awaken, remembering the city they intended to destroy."},{"pageContent":" ALSO BY TERRY GOODKIND[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Wizard’s First Rule[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312857059?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Stone of Tears[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312857066?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Blood of the Fold[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312890520?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Temple of the Winds[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312890537?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Soul of the Fire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551495?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Faith of the Fallen[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984485?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]The Pillars of Creation[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429934893?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Naked Empire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984577?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Debt of Bones[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765351548?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Chainfire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984409?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Phantom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429985093?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429924719?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]The Law of NinesThe Omen Machine[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429965019?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]The First Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890817?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]The Third Kingdom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466826274?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Severed Souls[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429948449?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]Warheart[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890404?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]NestDeath’s Mistress[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765388223?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]"},{"pageContent":" ABOUT THE AUTHOR [contents.xhtml#c_ata]image [../images/author-photo.jpg]Terry Goodkind[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388261]is a #1 New York Times bestselling author.
