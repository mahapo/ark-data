Jolted fully awake by the shock of pain, he instantly seized her bony wrist, preventing her from ripping open his thigh. A dingy dress, buttoned all the way up to her throat, covered her gaunt figure. In the dim light of distant campfires Richard saw that the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (2 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 square of cloth draped over her head and knotted under her angular jaw looked to be made out of a scrap of frayed burlap. Despite her frail frame, her sunken cheeks, her stooped back, she had the glare of a predator. The woman who had stabbed him earlier that night had been heavier, and stronger. Her eyes, too, had burned with hate. The slender blade this woman wielded was smaller as well. While it made a painful puncture wound, had she sliced across his thigh muscle, as she'd apparently intended by the way she was holding the knife, it would have been far worse. The army of the Imperial Order did not bother to care for slaves with crippling injuries; they would simply have put him to death. That had probably been her plan in the first place. Gritting his teeth with awakened rage as he held the struggling woman's wrist in a viselike grip, Richard twisted her arm as he lifted her white-knuckled fist in order to withdraw the blade from his leg. A drop of blood dripped from the tip. He easily muscled her under his control. She was not the powerful killer he had at first feared. Her desire, her intent, her lust, however, were just as vicious as that of any of the invading horde she followed. As she grunted in pain, vapor from each panting breath rose into the cold night air. Richard knew that to be gentle would only give her another opportu-nity to finish the job. Surprise had provided her with an opening; he would not foolishly grant her a second chance. Still firmly holding her wrist, he wrenched the knife from her grasp. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (3 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He didn't let up the pressure on her arm until he had possession of the blade. He could have broken her arm, and she deserved no less, but he didn't-this was not the time or place to create a disturbance. He merely wanted her away from him. Once he'd disarmed her, he shoved her back. As soon as she stumbled to a halt, she spat at him. \"You'll never beat the team of the great and glorious Emperor Jagang. You are dogs-all of you! All of you from up here in the New World are heathen dogs!\" Richard glared at her, watching to make sure she didn't pull another knife and renew the attack. He checked to the sides for an accomplice. Although there were soldiers not far away, just beyond the small enclosure of supply wagons, they were preoccupied with their own business. There didn't appear to be anyone with the woman. When she started to spit at him again, Richard lunged at her. She gasped in fright as she flinched back. Having lost courage for the busi-ness of stabbing a man when he was awake and able to defend himself, she cast him one last hateful glare, then turned and escaped into the night. Richard had known that the length of heavy chain attached to the collar around his neck wasn't long enough to allow him to get to her, but she hadn't known that and so the threat had been convincing enough to scare her off. Even in the middle of the night the vast army encampment into which she had vanished was ceaselessly busy. Like some great, churning beast it swallowed her up. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (4 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 While many of the soldiers were sleeping, others seemed always to be at work repairing gear, making weapons, cooking, eating, or engaged in drinking and raucous stories around fires as they passed the time waiting for their next opportunity at murder, rape, and plunder. All night long, it seemed, there were men testing their strength against one another, some-times with muscle, sometimes with knives. Small crowds gathered from time to time to watch such contests and to bet on the outcome. Patrolling guards looking for any signs of serious trouble, soldiers looking for enter- tainment, and camp followers looking for a handout prowled the encamp-ment throughout the night. Occasionally men wandered by to size up Richard and his fellow captives. Between gaps in the wagons Richard could see some of the camp fol-lowers, hoping to earn food or even a small coin, going from group to group offering to play a flute and sing for the men. Others offered to shave soldiers, wash and care for their clothes, or tattoo their flesh. A number of the shadowy figures, after brief negotiations, disappeared into tents with the men. Others wandered the camp looking to steal. And a few of those out in the night were intent on murder. In the center of it all, in a prison island created out of a ring of supply wagons, Richard lay chained with other captive men brought in to play in the Ja'La dh Jin tournaments. Most of his team was made up of regular Imperial Order troops, but they were off sleeping in their own tents. Hardly a city ruled by the Order was without a Ja'La team. As children these soldiers had played it almost from the time they file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (5 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 could walk. They all expected that after the war was over Ja'La would endure for them. To many of the soldiers of the Order, Ja'La dh Jin-the Game of Life-was itself a matter of life and death, nearly equal to the cause of the Order. Even to a scrawny old woman who followed her emperor to war and lived off the scraps of his conquest, murder was an acceptable means of helping her favored team to victory. Having a winning Ja'La team was a source of great pride for an army division, just as it was for any city. Commander Karg, the officer responsible for Richard's team, was also intent on winning. A winning team could bring far more tangible benefits to those directly involved than mere glory. Those who ran the top teams became powerful men. Winning Ja'La players became heroes rewarded with riches of every sort, including legions of women eager to be with them. At night Richard was chained to the wagons that held the cages that had transported him and the other captives, but in the games they had played along the way he was the point man for their team, trusted to carry Commander Karg's ambitions to glory in the tournaments at Emperor Jagang's main encampment. Richard's life depended on how well he did his job. So far he had rewarded Commander Karg's faith in him. Richard's choice from the first had been to either join Commander Karg's effort, or be executed in the most gruesome manner possible. Richard, though, had had other reasons for \"volunteering.\" Those reasons were far more important to him than anything else. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (6 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He glanced over and saw that Johnrock, chained to the same transport wagon, lay on his back sound asleep. The man, a miller by trade, was built like an oak tree. Unlike the point men of other teams, Richard insisted on endless practice whenever they were not on the move. Not everyone on his team liked it, but they followed his instructions. Even in their cage as they had traveled to the Imperial Order's main force, Richard and Johnrock analyzed how they could have done better, devised and memorized codes for plays, and did endless push-ups and other exercises to build their strength. Exhaustion had apparently overcome the noise and confusion of camp, and Johnrock was sleeping as peacefully as a baby, unaware that their reputation had brought people out into the night who wanted to end their team's chances before they reached the tournaments. As tired as Richard was, he had only been dozing from time to time. He found himself having difficulty sleeping. Something was wrong, something not connected to all the myriad troubles swirling around him. It was not even anything to do with the immediate worldly dangers of being a captive. This was something different, something inside him, something deep within him. In a way it reminded him a little of the times he'd been sick with a fever, but that wasn't really it, either. No matter how carefully he tried to analyze it, the nature of the feeling remained elusive. He was so confused by the inexplicable sensation that he was left with nothing so much as an aching feeling of restless foreboding. Besides that, he was too preoccupied thinking about Kahlan to be file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (7 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 able to sleep. Held captive by Emperor Jagang himself, she was not all that far away. Sometimes when he'd been alone with Nicci, late in the night sitting before a fire, she had stared into those flames and confided in him how Jagang had brutalized her. Those stories gnawed at Richard's insides. He couldn't see the emperor's compound, but as they had rolled in through the sprawling encampment earlier that day he had seen the impressive command tents. To find himself looking into Kahlan's green eyes after all this time, even if for only a fleeting moment, had filled him with joy and relief. He had at long last found her, and she was alive. He had to find a way to get her out. Reasonably sure that the latest woman to have stabbed him was no longer lurking in the shadows for another attempt, Richard finally pulled his hand away to inspect the wound. It wasn't as bad as it might have been. If he had been sound asleep, like Johnrock, it might have gone much worse. He guessed that perhaps the odd feeling that had been keeping him awake had actually served him well. As much as the wound in his leg stung, it wasn't serious. Holding his hand tightly over it had stopped the bleeding. The wound from earlier that night was also painful, but it, too, wasn't anywhere as bad as it might have been. His shoulder blade had caught the tip of the woman's knife and thwarted her attempt at murder. Death had visited him twice that night and gone away empty- handed. Richard remembered the old saying that trouble sired three file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (8 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 children. He hoped not to meet the third child. He had just rolled onto his side to try again to get some sleep when he saw a shadow slipping up among the wagons. The stride appeared deliberate, though, rather than stealthy. Richard sat up as Commander Karg came to a halt over him. In the dim light Richard could plainly see the tattooed scales covering the right side of the man's face. Without the leather shoulder plates and breastplates that the commander usually wore, or even a shirt, Richard could see that the pattern of scales ran down over his shoulder and covered part of his chest as well. The tattoo made him look reptilian. Among themselves, Richard and Johnrock referred to the commander as \"Snake-face.\" The name fit in more ways than one. \"What do you think you're doing, Ruben?\" Ruben Rybnik was the name Johnrock-and everyone else on the team-knew Richard by. It was the name Richard had given when he'd been taken prisoner. If there was one place that his real name would surely get him killed, Richard now sat right in the middle of it. \"Trying to get some sleep.\" \"You have no business trying to force a woman to lie with you.\" Commander Karg pointed an accusatory finger. \"She came to me and told me all about what you tried to do to her.\" Richard's brow lifted. \"Did she, now.\" \"I told you before, if you beat the emperor's team-if you beat them- then you will get your choice of a woman. But in the meantime file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (9 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 you get no favors. I won't tolerate anyone disobeying my orders- least of all the likes of you.\" \"I don't know what she told you, Commander, but she came here with the intent of killing me. She wanted to make sure that the emperor's team wouldn't lose to us.\" The commander squatted down, resting his forearm on his knee as he peered at the point man for his Ja'La team. He looked ready to murder Richard himself. \"A poor lie, Ruben.\" The knife that only a short time ago he'd taken away from the woman was in Richard's hand, pressed up along the inside of his wrist. At this distance he could have gutted the commander before the man knew what had happened. But this was not the time or place. It wouldn't help Richard get Kahlan back. Without taking his gaze off the commander's eyes, Richard spun the knife through his fingers and caught the point between his first finger and^ thumb. It felt good to have a blade in his hand, any blade, even one this small. He held the handle of the knife out toward the commander. \"This is why my leg was bleeding. She stabbed me with it. Where else do you think I could get a knife?\" The significance-and the danger-of a knife being in Richard's possession was not lost on the man. He glanced at the wound on Richard's thigh and then took the knife. \"If you want us to win this tournament,\" Richard said with file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (10 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 deliberate care, \"then I need to get some rest. I would rest a lot easier if there were guards posted. If one skinny old woman, who probably has a bet on the emperor's team, kills me while I'm asleep, then your team will be without a point man and has no chance to win.\" \"Think a lot of yourself, don't you, Ruben?\" \"You think a lot of me, Commander, or you would have killed me long ago back in Tamarang after I killed dozens of your men.\" With his tattooed scales faintly lit by campfires, the commander looked like a snake considering a meal. \"It would appear that being point man is dangerous not just on the Ja'La field.\" He finally rose up over Richard. \"I'll post a guard. Just keep in mind that a lot of people don't think you're so good-after all, you've already lost one game for us.\" They had lost that game because Richard had tried to protect one of his men, a captive named York, whose leg had just been broken in a concentrated charge by the opposing team. He had been a valuable man, a good player, and therefore targeted. The way the Order played Ja'La, the rules allowed such things. With a badly broken leg York had suddenly become useless as a player, and as a slave. After he had been carried from the field, Commander Karg had unceremoniously cut the man's throat. For protecting the downed player rather than continuing play by taking the broc upheld toward the opposing goal, the referee had penalized their team by banning Richard from the rest of the game. They had lost as a result. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (11 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"The emperor's team lost a game, too, as I hear tell,\" Richard said. \"His Excellency had that team put to death. His new team was created from the best men in all of the Old World.\" Richard shrugged. \"We lose players for various reasons, too, and they get replaced. Any number have been hurt and can't play. Not long ago one of our men broke a leg. You did no less than the emperor did with his losers. \"As I see it, the details of who used to be on his team don't matter all that much. We've each lost a game. That makes us even. That's all that really matters. We come into this contest on equal footing. They're no better than us.\" The commander arched an eyebrow. \"You think you are their equal?\" Richard didn't shrink away from the man's glare. \"I am going to win us the chance to play the emperor's team, Commander, and then we will see what happens.\" A sly smile curved into the scales. \"Hoping for your choice of a woman, Ruben?\" Richard nodded without returning the smile. \"As a matter of fact I am.\" Commander Karg had no idea that Richard already knew the woman he wanted. He wanted Kahlan. He wanted her more than life itself. He intended to do whatever was necessary to get his wife away from the nightmare of captivity by Jagang and his Sisters of the Dark. Staring down at Richard, Commander Karg finally conceded with file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (12 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 a sigh. \"I'll tell the guards that their lives depend on no one getting at my team while they sleep.\" After the commander had vanished into the night, Richard lay back, at last letting his aching muscles relax. He watched guards in the distance rushing to set up a tight perimeter around the captive members of the team. The realization of what could be lost to nothing more than a conniving camp follower had spurred Commander Karg to action. At least the attack had served the purpose of making it possible for Richard to get the rest he needed. It wasn't easy sleeping when anyone who wanted to could sneak up and cut your throat. Now, at least, he was temporarily safe, even if it had been necessary to surrender the knife. He still had the other one, though, the one he'd taken from the first woman. It was tucked away in his boot. Richard curled into a ball on the bare ground in an effort to stay warm as he tried to go to sleep. The ground had long ago lost any heat from the previous day. Without a bedroll or blanket, he was forced to bunch up the slack in the chain to make a pillow of sorts. The next sunrise was not far off. Out on the Azrith Plain it wasn't going to be getting warmer any time soon. Dawn would bring the first day of winter. The noise of the camp droned on. He was so tired. Thinking about Kahlan, about the first time he'd met her, about how it had lifted his heart to at last see her alive again, about how happy it made him to look into her beautiful green eyes, finally allowed sleep to gently quiet his mind and take him. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (13 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 CHAPTER 2 It was a soft, otherworldly sound, like a doorway into the world of the dead opening, that woke Richard from a deep sleep. He looked up and saw a figure in a hooded cloak looming over him. Something about its bearing, its very presence, made the hair on the backs of his arms stand on end. This was no timid, frail woman. Something in the demeanor told him that this was not even a knife-wielding attacker. This was something far worse. Richard knew without doubt that this was the third child of trouble and it had just found him. He sat up and scooted back a little, gaining some precious distance. Somehow, Commander Karg's guards had failed to stop the intruder. He glanced their way and saw them casually walking their patrol. As closely spaced as they were, Richard didn't see how anyone could have gotten through their perimeter, yet this latest visitor had managed it. The hooded figure glided closer. The cleansing has begun. Startled, Richard blinked. The eerie voice echoed in his mind, but he wasn't at all sure that he had actually heard it. The words just seemed to be there, in his head. He carefully slipped two fingers down into his boot, groping for the wooden handle of the knife. When he found it, he started file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (14 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 drawing it out. The cleansing has begun, the figure said again. It wasn't like a real voice. It was neither male nor female. The words didn't seem to have been spoken aloud, as by a voice, but rather sounded like a thousand whispers joined together. The words seemed like they had come from another world. Richard couldn't imagine how anything dead could speak, but the words didn't sound at all as if they had come from anything living. He feared to imagine just what it was that stood before him. \"Who are you?\" he asked, stalling for time while he appraised the situation. A quick glance to each side revealed no one else in plain sight; as far as he could tell the visitor had come alone. The guards were facing the other way. They were watching for anyone who might try to get at the sleeping captives; they weren't looking inside the circle of wagons for trouble. The figure seemed suddenly to be closer yet, within a mere arm's length. Richard didn't know how it had gotten that close to him. He hadn't seen it move. He wouldn't have allowed it to get that close if he had seen it moving toward him. And yet, it had. Having a chain attached to his collar didn't leave him much freedom to maneuver if he had to fight. With his fingers he carefully collected links of chain into his free hand. If he had to fight, he would loop the chain and use it as a noose. With his other hand he was still surreptitiously fishing out the knife. Your time starts this day, Richard Rahl. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (15 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard's fingers on the knife paused. It had spoken his real name. No one in the camp knew his real name. Richard's heart hammered against his chest. With as dark as it was, and the hood, the face inside was hidden from view. Richard could see only blackness, like death itself, staring out at him. It crossed his mind that that just might be exactly what it was. He reminded himself not to let his imagination get carried away. He summoned his courage. \"What did you say?\" An arm beneath the dark cloak rose toward him. He couldn't see the hand, just the drape of the cloth over it. Your time starts this day, Richard Rahl, the first day of winter. You have one year to complete the cleansing. An unsettling image of something all too familiar came to mind: the boxes of Orden. As if reading his mind, a thousand whispers of the dead spoke. You are a new player, Richard Rahl. Because of that, the time of the play is now reset. It starts anew from this day, the first day of winter. Until a little more than three years before, Richard had been living a peaceful life in Westland. The entire chain of events had started when his real father, Darken Rahl, had finally gotten his hands on the boxes of Or-den and first put them in play. That had been on the first day of winter four years ago. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (16 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:11 PM]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The key to telling the three boxes of Orden apart and knowing the correct box to open was The Book of Counted Shadows. Richard had memorized that book as a young man. Because he had lost his link to his gift he could no longer remember the words of the book; to be able to read or remember books of magic required magic. But while he didn't recall the words, he did know from remembering his own actions some of the basic principles laid out in the book. One of the most important elements of using The Book of Counted Shadows was verifying if the words Richard had memorized were spoken true-verifying if that key component to opening the boxes of Orden was genuine. The book itself stipulated the means of verification. The means of verification was the use of a Confessor. Kahlan was the last living Confessor. Richard summoned his voice only with the greatest of difficulty. \"What you say is impossible. I have put nothing into play.\" You are named as the player. \"Named? Named by who?\" That you have been named as a new player is what matters. You are forewarned that you have one year from this day-and not one day longer-to complete the cleansing.

He heard a small, soft sound, like a doorway into the world of the dead closing. He could see the little clouds of his panting breath rising into the black winter night. After what seemed an empty eternity, Richard finally lay back down, using the cloak to cover his trembling body, but he could not force himself to close his eyes. To the west distant lightning flickered at the horizon. To the east the dawn of the first day of winter fast approached. Between lightning and dawn, in the middle of an enemy numbering in the millions, Richard Rahl, leader of the D'Haran Empire, lay chained to a wagon thinking about his captive wife, and the third child of trouble.

On an ornately carved wooden chest against the far wall a single oil lamp, its wick turned down low, cast a weak glow through the gloom of the emperor's inner sanctum. The burning oil helped, if only to a small degree, to mask the stench of the encampment: the smells of soot from fires, fetid sweat, rancid refuse, the latrines, the horses and other animals, and manure all mingled together into a ubiquitous stink.

Since arriving in the encampment she was always reluctant to draw a breath too deeply. The smell would forever be linked in her mind to the suffering, misery, and death that the soldiers of the Imperial Order visited upon on everything they touched. As far as Kahlan was concerned, the people who believed in, supported, and fought for the convictions of the Imperial Order did not belong in the world of life among those who valued it. Through the gauze fabric covering the vents in the top of the tent, Kahlan could see the furious flashes of lightning to the west illuminating the sky overhead to announce the approaching storms. The emperor's tent, with its hangings, carpets, and padded walls, was relatively quiet, considering the constant din of the sprawling encampment out beyond, so it was hard to hear the thunder, but she could occasionally feel rumbles of it through the ground. With the cold weather settling in, the rain would make it all the more miserable. As tired as she was, Kahlan couldn't stop thinking about the man from earlier that day, the man who had looked out from that cage as it had rolled through the camp, the man with the gray eyes, the man who had seen her-actually seen her-and had called out her name.

Kahlan knew well the icy touch of oblivion. The same spell that made people forget her as soon as they'd seen her had also wiped out every memory she had of her past. Whatever there was to her life before the Sisters of the Dark, it was now lost to her. Among the millions of troops sprawled out across the vast, barren plain, her captors had found only a handful of soldiers who could see her-forty-three, to be exact. These forty-three were men who, like the collar around her neck, the Sisters, and Jagang himself, stood between her and freedom. Kahlan made it her business to know every one of those forty-three men, to know their strengths, their weaknesses. She studied them silently, mentally making notes about each of them. Everyone had habits-ways of walking, of observing what was going on around them, of paying attention or failing to pay attention, of doing their job. She had learned everything she could about their individual characteristics. The Sisters believed that an anomaly in the spell they had used was responsible for a handful of people being aware of Kahlan. It was possible that out among the Order's vast army there were others who could see and remember her, but Jagang had so far not discovered any more. The forty-three soldiers were thus the only men able to serve as her guards. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (20 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jagang, of course, could see her, as well as the Sisters who had used the spell in the first place. Much to the Sisters' horror they had been captured by Jagang and they, too, had ended up with Kahlan in the wretched encampment of the Imperial Order. Other than the Sisters and Jagang, none of those few who could see her really knew her-knew her from her forgotten past, a past that even Kahlan didn't know. But that man in the cage was different. He had known her. Since she didn't remember ever seeing him before, that could only mean that he was someone who knew her from her past. Jagang had promised her that when she finally had her past back and knew who she was, when she knew everything, then the real horror for her would begin. He delighted in explaining in vivid detail exactly what he intended to do to her, how he would make her life one of endless torment. Since she didn't remember her past, his promises of retribution didn't mean as much to her as he would have liked. Still, the things he'd promised were terrifying enough in and of themselves. Whenever Jagang promised such vengeance, Kahlan returned only a blank look. It was a way of walling off her emotions from him. She didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing her emotions, her fear. Despite what it would mean for her, Kahlan was proud to have earned the contempt of such a vile man. It gave her the confidence that whatever she had done in her past, her convictions could only have placed her in direct opposition to the will of the Order.

His joyous reaction to seeing her stood out in sharp contrast to all those around her who despised and reviled her. She had to know who she was, who the woman was that could be held in such regard by that man. She wished she could have looked at the man for longer than the brief glimpse she had gotten. She'd had to turn away. If she had been caught showing any interest in a captive, Jagang surely would have killed him. Kahlan felt protective of the man. She didn't want to inadvertently bring trouble to someone who knew her, someone so obviously overcome by the sight of her. Yet again Kahlan tried to put her racing mind to rest. She yawned as she watched the flickers of lightning in the little patch of dark sky. Dawn was not far off and she needed sleep. With that dawn, though, came the first day of winter. She didn't know why, but the very idea of the first day of winter made her uneasy. She couldn't imagine a reason. Something about the first day of winter seemed to knot her insides with anxiety. It seemed that beneath the surface of her ability to remember lurked dangers she could not begin to imagine. Her head came up at the sound of something falling over. The noise had come from the outer room, the room outside Jagang's bedroom. Kahlan propped herself up on an elbow, but she dared not get up from her spot on the floor beside the emperor's bed. She knew well the consequences of disobeying his orders.

In the darkness Kahlan heard Jagang, just above her on the bed, sit up. Sudden cries and moans broke out on the other side of the padded walls of the bedroom. It sounded like it might have been Sister Ulicia. Since being captured by Jagang, Kahlan had had occasion enough to hear Sister Ulicia sobbing and crying. Kahlan herself had often enough been brought to tears, all because of those Sisters of the Dark, but especially Sister Ulicia. Jagang threw the covers off. \"What's going on out there?\" Kahlan knew that for the crime of disturbing Emperor Jagang Sister Ulicia was soon going to have even more reason to be moaning. Jagang stepped down onto the floor, straddling Kahlan on the carpet beside his bed. He looked down deliberately, making sure that in the dim light of the lantern glowing atop the chest, she saw him naked and exposed over her. Satisfied with his silent, implied threat, he retrieved his trousers from a nearby chair. Hopping from one foot to the other he pulled them on as he started for the doorway. He didn't bother putting on anything more. He paused before the thick hanging that covered the doorway and turned back, crooking a finger at Kahlan. He wanted to keep an eye on her. As Kahlan rose to her feet, Jagang drew back the heavy covering over the doorway.

Like almost everyone, the woman didn't see Kahlan and had only been more confused and frightened the evening before when Jagang had spoken to the phantom in the room with him. That had been the least of the woman's cause for fright that night. Kahlan felt a jolt of pain sizzle down the nerves of her shoulders and arms, Jagang's reminder through the collar not to linger in doing as she'd been told. Without letting him see how much it hurt, she hurried after him. The sight that greeted her in the outer room was confusing. Sister Ulicia was rolling around on the floor, arms flailing as she babbled incoherently between moans and cries. Sister Armina, hunched over the woman at her feet, shuffled to and fro, following as Sister Ulicia writhed around on the floor, afraid to touch the woman, afraid not to, afraid of what might be the problem. She looked like she wanted to collect Sister Ulicia in her arms and quiet her lest she create a disturbance that would get the attention of the emperor. She didn't yet realize that it was too late for that. Usually when one of those two was in any kind of agony it was agony inflicted by Jagang through his control of their minds, but now he, too, stood watching the strange sight, apparently unsure of what could be causing such behavior. Sister Armina, already bent over the woman floundering on the floor, suddenly noticed Emperor Jagang and bowed deeper yet. \"Excellency, I don't know what is wrong with her.

They had been tasked with seeing to it that Kahlan didn't leave the tent without Jagang. Sisters were not their responsibility. Other guards, Jagang's personal elite guards, huge brutes all covered in tattoos and metal studs piercing their flesh, stood like statues near the doorway of the tent. The job of the elite guard was to see to it that no one entered the tent without invitation. They looked only mildly curious about what might be happening in their midst. Off in the darker corners of the expansive tent, slaves waited in the shadows, always silently at the ready to carry out the emperor's wishes. They, too, would show little reaction no matter what might happen right before them. They were there to serve at the whim of the emperor and nothing more. It was unhealthy for any of them, individually, to distinguish themselves in any way that might bring them notice. The Sisters, sorceresses all, were Jagang's personal weapons, his personal property and marked as such with rings through their lower lips. They were not the responsibility of any of the guards unless specifically instructed.

When Sister Ulicia cried out again, Kahlan realized that it didn't look, as she had at first thought, like the woman was in pain. It looked more like she was . . . possessed. Jagang's nightmare gaze passed among the dozen guards. \"Has she said anything?\" \"No, Excellency,\" one of the special guards said. The rest of the soldiers, those who could see Kahlan, shook their heads in agreement. The emperor's elite guard did not dispute the account of the lesser men. \"What's wrong with her?\" Jagang asked the Sister, who looked ready to fall to the ground and grovel at his feet. Sister Armina winced at the anger in his voice. \"I don't have any idea, Excellency, I swear.\" She gestured toward the far side of the room. \"I was asleep, waiting until I could be of service. Sister Ulicia was asleep as well. I woke when I heard her voice. I thought she was speaking to me.\" \"What was she saying?\" Jagang asked. \"I couldn't understand her, Excellency.\" Kahlan realized, then, that Jagang didn't know what Sister Ulicia had said. He always knew what the Sisters had said, what they'd thought, what they were planning. He was a dream walker. He wandered the landscape of their minds. He was always privy to everything. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (26 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 And yet, he was not privy to this. Or, Kahlan surmised, perhaps he didn't want to say aloud what he already knew. He liked to test people that way, asking questions to which he already knew the answers. It displeased him greatly whenever he caught anyone in a lie. Only the day before he had erupted in a rage and strangled the life out of a new captive slave who'd lied to him about having taken a bite to eat off a tray coming in for the emperor's dinner. Jagang, as heavily muscled as any of his elite guard, had accomplished the deed with one powerful hand around the gaunt man's throat. The rest of the slaves had waited patiently until the emperor had finished the gruesome murder, and then dragged the body away. Jagang reached down and with one meaty fist hauled the Sister to her feet by her hair. \"What's this about, Ulicia?\" The woman's eyes rolled, her lips moved, and her tongue wandered aimlessly in her open mouth. Jagang seized her by the shoulders and shook her violently. Sister Uli-cia's head whipped back and forth. Kahlan thought he very well might break her neck. She wished he would; then there would be one less Sister for Kahlan to worry about. \"Excellency,\" Sister Armina said in a confidential tone of discreet counsel, \"we need her.\" When the emperor glared at her, she added. \"She is the player.\" Jagang considered Sister Armina's words, looking none too happy about them, but not arguing, either. \"First day ...\" Sister Ulicia moaned. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (27 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jagang pulled her a little closer. \"First day what?\" \"Winter . . . winter . . . winter,\" Sister Ulicia mumbled.

One of the soldiers lifted an arm, pointing toward the doorway out of the grand tent. \"It's just dawn, Excellency.\" Jagang fixed him in a glare. \"What?\" \"Excellency, it's just dawn of the first day of winter.\" Jagang let go of Sister Ulicia. She dropped heavily to the carpets that covered the floor. He stared at the doorway. \"So it is.\" Outside, through the slight slit of an opening at the side of the heavy covering hung over the doorway, Kahlan could see the first streaks of color in the sky. She could also see more of the ever- present elite guard who always surrounded Jagang. None of them could see Kahlan; they were totally unaware of her presence. The special guards inside the tent, the ones who were always at hand, could see her just fine, though. Outside, with Jagang's elite guard, there would be more of those special guards. Their job was to insure that Kahlan never came out of the tent alone. On the floor, Sister Ulicia, as if in a trance, mumbled, \"One year, one year, one year.\" \"One year what?\" Jagang yelled. Several of the closer guards flinched back. Sister Ulicia sat up. She began rocking back and forth. \"Starts over. Year starts over. Starts over. One year.

She is the player, after all.\" Jagang's mouth twisted with impatience. \"But we already know that we have a year from back when Ulicia put them in play\"-he flicked a hand in the direction of the towering plateau-\"right after Kahlan took them from the palace up there.\" \"New player!\" Sister Ulicia shouted, eyes closed, as if to correct him. \"New player! The year starts over!\" Jagang looked genuinely surprised at her words. Kahlan wondered how it was that the dream walker could be surprised by such a thing. For some reason, though, he seemed to be unable, at the moment anyway, to use his ability on Sister Ulicia. Unless he was simply playing a trick. Jagang didn't always reveal exactly what he knew and what he didn't know. Kahlan had never felt that he could read her mind, but she always remained cautious that he might want her to think just that. What if all the time he was reading her every thought? Still, she just didn't believe it was so. She couldn't put her finger on any one thing that made her think that he was unable to use his ability as a dream walker on her, but rather it was an impression based on the cumulative evidence of many small little things. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (29 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"How is it possible for there to be a new player?\" Jagang asked in a tone that made Sister Armina begin to tremble just the slightest bit.

There is the the third box, after all, the one that Tovi had.\" \"You mean the box that was stolen because you stupid bitches sent Tovi off by herself rather than having her stay with the rest of you.\" It was an angry charge, not a question. Sister Armina, on the verge of panic, thrust a finger out at Kahlan. \"It was her fault! If she had done as we instructed and brought all three boxes out together, we would all have been together and we would have the three boxes. But she failed to bring them all out together. It's her fault!\" Sister Ulicia had told Kahlan to hide all three boxes in her pack and bring them out. All three wouldn't fit, so she brought one out first, intending to go back for the others. Sister Ulicia had not been pleased, to say the least. She had beaten Kahlan nearly to a bloody death for failing to somehow do the impossible and fit all three in a pack that was not big enough. Kahlan didn't bother to speak up in her own defense. She refused to lower herself to trying to reason with people who didn't abide by reason. Jagang looked back over his shoulder at Kahlan.

Trembling hands covered her face, as if she was overwhelmed by what had just taken place. Jagang turned away, lost in thought as he considered. \"Can there be two people who both have the boxes in play at the same time?\" he asked himself. Sister Armina's eyes darted about. She seemed unsure if she was supposed to attempt an answer. In the end she remained silent. Sister Ulicia rubbed her eyes. \"He vanished.\" Jagang frowned down at her. \"Who vanished?\" \"I couldn't see his face.\" She gestured vaguely. \"He was just there, telling me, but he vanished. I don't know who it was, Excellency.\" The woman looked shaken to her core. \"What did you see?\" Jagang asked. As if jolted by an unexpected sudden shock, she shot to her feet. Her eyes had gone wide with pain. Blood trickled from one ear. \"What did you see?\" Jagang repeated. Kahlan had seen him give the Sisters pain in the past. Whether or not he was able to be in Sister Ulicia's mind before, it was clear that he now had no difficulty making his presence felt. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (31 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"It was someone-\" Sister Ulicia said with a gasp. \"Someone who was just here, in the tent, Excellency.

Someone else has also put the boxes of Orden in play. We are warned that the year must start over. We now have one year from today, the first day of winter.\" Looking to be deep in thought, Jagang started toward the doorway. Two of the elite guards pulled open the double hanging, allowing their emperor to walk through the opening without pause. Kahlan, knowing that if she didn't stay close at hand the pain of the collar was only an instant away, followed him out before he gave her that reminder. Behind her, Sisters Ulicia and Armina hurried to keep up. The big men of the elite guard outside the tent casually stepped away to each side, making way for the emperor. The other soldiers- Kahlan's special guards-marched back and forth just beyond them. Standing close behind Jagang in the cold dawn, Kahlan rubbed her arms, trying to work up some warmth. A wall of dark clouds towered to the west. Even through the stink of the encampment, she could smell the rain carried on the damp air. The thin clouds fleeing to the east were stained bloodred in the sunrise of the first day of winter. Jagang stood silently considering the immense plateau in the distance. Atop that towering tableland was the People's Palace. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (32 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 While certainly a palace, it was vast almost beyond belief.

The army of the Order spread like a poisonous black sea across the Azrith Plain around the plateau, leaving it isolated from any hope of rescue or salvation. The first rays of light were just touching the distant palace, making the marble walls, columns, and towers glow golden in the sunrise. It was a breathtakingly beautiful sight. To all these people of the Order, though, the sight of the palace, of such beauty yet untouched by their lecherous hands, only inspired jealousy and hate. They lusted to destroy the place, to blot such majesty out of existence, to insure that man never again aspired to such merit.

She never said a word to us, of course, to the other Sisters of the Dark, but back at the Palace of the Prophets she gave up a great deal- things I would never have imagined her giving up- in exchange for me naming her to be one of his six teachers. \"The price she paid for that chance to be his teacher made me suspicious of her motives.

In fact, now that I think about it, I'm sure of it. She hated the man. She wanted him dead. She hated everything he represented. She hated him. Plain as day. She hated him.\" Sister Ulicia closed her mouth, visibly forcing herself to stop babbling. \"I gave her everything.\" Jagang's voice rumbled like bottled thunder. \"I made her as good as a queen. As Jagang the Just, I granted her the authority to be the fist of the Fellowship of Order. Those who opposed the righteous ways of the Order came to know her as Death's Mistress. She was able to fulfill that virtuous call to duty only because of my generosity. I was foolish to have given her so much latitude. She betrayed me. Betrayed me for him.\" Kahlan didn't think that she would ever see Jagang in the grip of hot jealousy, but she was seeing it now. He was a man who took what he wanted. He was not used to being denied anything. Apparently, he couldn't have this woman Nicci. Apparently, Richard Rahl had her heart.

Wherever she was, she always analyzed the situation and envisioned how she would implement an attempt to escape. This was not the time, or place, but she still had thought it through. She wouldn't kill the stupid one first, but she would take his knife, just as Jagang had said. Then she would turn to the smart one because he was more watchful and his reactions were far quicker. The special guards' task was to prevent her from escaping; they weren't supposed to use lethal force against her. When the smart one came at her to tackle her, she would already have the knife and would use their closing momentum as she spun toward him to slash his throat. She would sidestep his falling dead weight to his left side, spin, and plunge the knife into the kidney of the stupid fellow, just as Jagang had suggested. \"You have me dead to rights,\" Kahlan told the emperor in a flat tone. \"Well done.\" His left eye twitched just the slightest bit.

As a rule Zedd considered it wise not to give Mord-Sith cause to be surly, but then, he didn't like being pestered when he was doing something important.

Zedd could see her muscles tighten beneath her red leather. \"What do you mean?\" \"Like you said, she was acting pretty strange.

I saw it in there just before she closed the door.\" Zedu pushed a stray wave of white hair back from his face. \"That's part of the reason I think this has something to do with Richard. Cara, I don't go through this kind of seal lightly, but I think this is important.\" Cara sighed in resignation. \"All right.\" Her mouth twisted with the displeasure of agreeing to his plan. \"If she bites your head off I suppose I can always sew it back on for you.\" Zedd smiled as he pushed his sleeves up his arms. Taking a deep breath, he hunched back to the business of unknotting the seal Nicci had woven with magic around the lever. The immense, brass-clad doors were covered with engraved symbols that were specific to the containment field in that part of the Keep. Such a place was already hardened against tampering and shielded against casual entry, but he had grown up in the Keep and knew how various elements of the place functioned. He also knew a great many of the tricks associated with those elements. This particular field was tricky because, being a containment field for what might be inside, it was double-sided. He gently glided the first three fingers of his left hand over the area of convergence. It made the nerve in his left arm tingle up to his elbow-not a good sign. Nicci had added something to the shield, file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (48 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 making a personal shield out of something that had been generic. Zedd was beginning to think that Cara knew more than he had given her credit for. This was a shield that seemed to respond in a unique way to the application of force. He paused a moment to consider. He would have to achieve what he wanted without applying force that would invoke that reaction. He carefully slipped a thin thread of innocent nothing through the snarl. With his right hand he eased the tangled restriction of power so that the whole thing would begin to loosen. He knew all too well that it would do no good to simply try to break through the seal, because the containment field was constructed in such a way that force only caused it to lock tighter. Nicci had apparently added multipliers to that quality. If he applied too much force the shield would simply tighten, like pulling the ends of a knotted rope tighter. If that happened, he would never get it undone. Besides that, Cara was right-Nicci had Subtractive Magic and there was no telling what elements of such sinister power she might have woven into the matrix to prevent the inner seal from being breached. He would not like to force his hand through the keyhole, so to speak, only to discover he had plunged it right into a cauldron of molten lead. Much less risky to untie the knot of magic than try to rip it apart. Such difficulties only made Zedd all the more determined that he was going to find a way to get through.

And then, even though he was being careful beyond all reason, the weave of the shield tightened, neatly snapping off the foray of magic. It was as if it had maneuvered him into an ambush. Zedd stood hunched before the brass-clad doors, surprised that a shield would have been able to react in that way. He was, after all, not yet trying to breach it, but merely to probe its inner workings- having a look in the keyhole, as it were. He had done the very same thing any number of times before. It always worked. It should have worked. It was the most confounding shield he had ever encountered. He was still bent over the lever, considering his next move, when the door opened inward. Zedd turned his head a little, peering up. Nicci, one hand on the inner lever, the other at her side, towered over him. \"Did you ever think of knocking?\" she asked.

Somehow I didn't think you were hoping to catch me cavorting naked.\" She stepped back into the library, implying permission to enter. It was an immense room, with two-story-high round-top windows running the entire length of the far wall. Heavy dark green velvet draperies with gold fringe along with two-story polished mahogany columns rose up between each of the windows, each of those made of hundreds of thick squares of glass. Even the dawn light flooding in through those windows wasn't enough to banish the somber atmosphere from the room. Some of the panes of refractory glass making up the windows that were part of the containment field in this section of the Keep had been broken in an unexpected battle back when Richard had been there. Nicci had invited lightning in through those windows to obliterate the underworld beast that had attacked Richard. Asked how she had been able to coax lightning to do her bidding, she had shrugged and said simply that she had created a void that the lightning needed to fill, so it had been compelled to do so. Zedd understood the principle, he just couldn't imagine how it could be accomplished. While grateful that she had saved Richard's life, Zedd had not been pleased that such valuable and irreplaceable glass had been destroyed, leaving the containment field breached. Nicci had offered to help with the repairs. Zedd wouldn't have known how to accomplish such a thing by himself.

While Zedd had known some very powerful sorceresses, he had never known any who were the equal of Nicci. Some of the things she could do with seeming ease were so confounding that it left him speechless. Of course, Nicci was far more than a mere sorceress. As a former Sister of the Dark she knew how to command Subtractive Magic. As a Sister of the Dark, she would have taken the power from a wizard and added it to her own, creating something altogether unique-not something he liked to contemplate.

His ability had told him that it was there, but his ability had not told him what more there was to it. Behind him, Cara let out a low whistle. Zedd sympathized with the sentiment. The box of Orden, sitting atop one of the massive library tables, absent the decorative covering that once had contained it, was a bewitching black that seemed as if it might suck the light right out of the dawn, a black so black it almost appeared as if the box itself was nothing so much as a void in the world of life. Staring at it felt uncomfortably like looking right into the underworld, the world of the dead. But it was the containment spell that had been drawn all around the box that had him alarmed. It had been drawn in blood. There were other charms, other spells, drawn on the tabletop, and they, too, were drawn in blood. Zedd recognized some of the elements of the diagrams. He didn't know of anyone living who could have drawn such charms. Such things were not entirely stable, making them dangerous beyond belief.

Zedd had seen such terrible spells drawn only once before. Those had been drawn by Darken Rahl-Richard's father-when Darken Rahl had been completing the conjuring involved in opening the boxes of Orden. Opening one of the boxes had cost him his life. Around the box itself, in midair, lines of green and amber light traced yet more spells through space. They were somewhat reminiscent of the glowing green lines of the verification web they had done for the Chainfire spell in that very room, but this structure of three-dimensional formulas was materially different. And these glowing lines pulsed as if alive. He supposed that made sense. The power of Orden was the power of life itself. Other lines, connected to intersections of the green and, in places, amber light, were as black as the box. Peering at them was like looking through slits into death itself. Subtractive Magic had been mingled with Additive to create a network of power the likes of which Zedd had never imagined he would see in his lifetime. The whole web of light and darkness hung in space. The box of Orden itself sat in the center of that web, like a fat black spider.

The thing that only I could do.\" The confluence of both sides of the gift holding the box of Orden within its glowing web was beyond imagining. It was the stuff of nightmares. Zedd chose his words carefully. \"Are you suggesting that you believe that you can put that box in play?\" The manner in which she slowly shook her head tightened his chest with dread. Her blue-eyed gaze riveted him in place. \"I have already put it in play.\" Zedd felt as if the floor might come apart under him and he might never stop falling. He wondered for just an instant if any of this was real. The whole room seemed to be swirling around him. His legs felt wobbly.

She laid a hand gently on his forearm. \"When I opened the gateway I was asked to name the player. I named Richard. I put the boxes of Orden in play on behalf of Richard.\" Zedd stood thunderstruck.

Before he did something beyond retrieval, before he reacted out of blind rage, he told himself that he must keep his head. He tried to touch on all he knew about the boxes and what was happening, tried to remind himself of all the desperate things he'd had to do in his life. He tried to see it from her perspective.

It had, to a degree, countered the damage of the Chainfire spell infecting her. When Nicci named Richard the player, completing the links to the power she had invoked, Nicci had suddenly known Kahlan. It was not a rebuilding of her lost memory of Kahlan-that was gone- but rather it was a simple reconnection to the awareness of the reality of Kahlan's existence, to the here and now. For ages, it seemed, Nicci had thought that Richard was deluded in his belief in the existence of a woman no one but he remembered. Even later, when Richard had found the Chainfire book and had proven to them what had really happened, Nicci had at last believed him, but she had based that belief only on her belief in Richard and the facts he had uncovered. It was an intellectual conviction based on indirect evidence alone. That conviction had no basis in her own memories or perceptions. She had no personal recollection of Kahlan, only Richard's memory to go on, his word, and the evidence at hand. In that secondhand manner she believed in the existence of this woman, Kahlan, because she believed Richard. But now Nicci knew-really knew-that Kahlan was real. Nicci still had no memory of anything about the woman, but she viscerally knew that Kahlan was real, that she existed. She no longer needed to rely on Richard's word to know it.

Nicci knew that, now, because of the connection to the power of Orden, because of what it had done within her, Kahlan would no longer seem to be invisible. Nicci would be able to see her just as she could see everyone else. The Chainfire spell still resided within Nicci, but Orden had at least partially countered the spell, halted the continuing damage, allowing her to be aware of the truth. Her memory of Kahlan was still not vital, but Kahlan was. Nicci now knew, really knew, that Richard's love was real. Nicci felt an aching joy for Richard's heart, even as her own had broken. Cara stepped up close beside her and did something Nicci could never have imagined a Mord-Sith doing: she put an arm gently around Nicci's waist, drawing her close. At least, it was something no Mord-Sith would ever have done until Richard had come along. Richard had changed everything. Cara, like Nicci, had been brought back from the brink of madness by Richard's passion for life. The two of them shared a unique understanding of Richard, a special connection, a perspective that Nicci doubted anyone else, even Zedd, could truly appreciate. More than that, no one but Cara could grasp all that Nicci had just given up. \"You did good, Nicci,\" Cara whispered. Zedd rose. \"Yes, she did.

Nicci didn't. She gestured toward the box of Orden sitting on the table within the glowing web of light. \"I'd better stay close.\" Besides watching over the box, she needed to study The Book of Life, along with other volumes, further. There were still parts of Ordenic theory that she hadn't been able to fully understand. She was distracted by a number of unanswered questions. If she was eventually to be of any help to Richard she would need to know the answers to those questions. What concerned her most was an issue at the center of Ordenic theory having to do with the connections between Orden and the subject of the Chainfire event-Kahlan. Nicci needed to better understand the nature of requirements for connections based on primary foundations. She needed to fully grasp how those foundations were established. She was troubled by the constraints on predetermined protocols-their need of a sterile field in order to re-create memory. She also needed to learn more about the precise conditions in which the forces needed to be applied. At the center of it all, though, was that cautionary requirement of a sterile field. She needed to understand the precise nature of the sterile field Orden required and, more importantly, why Ordenic protocols needed it. \"I have all the shields up,\" Zedd told her. \"The entrances to the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (74 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Keep are sealed.

Considering all that's going on, and all we don't yet know, we can't be too careful. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to keep an eye on the box.\" Nicci nodded as she followed them out of the doorway. \"Let me know as soon as all is clear.\" The towering hall outside, while not more than a dozen feet wide, rose nearly out of sight high overhead. The passageway formed a long, narrow rift deep within the mountain down in the lower part of the Keep. To the left side rose a natural rock wall that had been chiseled right out of the granite of the mountain itself. Even thousands of years later, the marks left by cutting tools could still be seen. The wall on the side with the rooms was made up of tightly fit, enormous stone blocks. They formed the wall opposing the chiseled granite, rising up together sixty or more feet. That seemingly endless split through the mountain constituted part of the boundary of the containment field. The rooms within the containment area were all lined up along the very outer edge of the Keep that rose up out of the mountain itself.

In fact, I'm not going to be in a good mood again until I see Lord Rahl alive and safe.\" \"You have good moods?\" Zedd asked as they hurried away. Cara scowled at him. \"I'm frequently cheerful and pleasant. Are you suggesting that I'm not?\" Zedd held up his hands in surrender. \"No, no. Cheerful describes you perfectly.\" \"Good, then.\" \"In fact, cheerful would come even before bloodthirsty in my book.\" \"Come to think of it, I think I like bloodthirsty even better.\" Nicci couldn't share the spirit of their banter. She wasn't good at making people laugh. She frequently found herself perplexed by the way Zedd and others could ease tension with such exchanges. Nicci knew all too well the nature of the people who were trying to kill them. She had once been one of those people of the Order. She had been as merciless as she had been deadly. She had never once seen Emperor Jagang being jovial or lighthearted. He was hardly a man given to repartee. She had spent file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (76 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 a great deal of time with him, and he was never anything but consistently lethal. His cause was deadly serious to him and he was fanatically dedicated to it. Knowing the kind of people coming for them, people like she herself had once been, and understanding their heartless nature, Nicci didn't feel that she could be any less serious than they. She watched Zedd, Cara, and Rikka hurry down the first hall to the right, heading for the stairway. As they started up, Nicci suddenly understood the sound, the vibration she felt. It was an alarm, of sorts. She knew why Rikka didn't recognize it. She opened her mouth to call out to the others just as the world seemed to come grinding to a halt. A dark cloud poured down the stairwell. It was like a million- speckled suggestion of a snake in midair, rolling, turning, twisting, thinning, thickening as it came roaring down the stairwell. The rolling, fluttering rumble was deafening. Thousands of bats poured around the corner, a fat snake of them in midair, a thing alive made up of untold numbers of the little creatures. The sight of so many thousands of them coalesced into a single moving shape was riveting. The racket reverberated off the walls, filling the split in the mountain with a riot of noise. The bats seemed to be flying in a panic, their fused form coiling around the corner in a rush as they bolted from something.

And then the fleeing bats were gone, driven before some terror coming through the Keep behind them. The soft, fluttering sound they left in their wake echoed its muted alarm through the hall as the bats fled into deeper darkness. That distant sound was what Rikka had heard but not understood. Staring at the stairs from where the bats had come, Nicci felt as if she were frozen and immobile in an expectant, silent moment in time, waiting to breathe, waiting for something unimaginable. With a rising sense of panic, she realized that in fact she really couldn't move. And then a dark shape came sweeping down the stairs like an ill wind. Yet, at the same time, it inexplicably appeared to hang motionless. It seemed composed of swirling black shapes and flowing shadows, creating an inky eddy of obscurity. The dizzying shape of it, the entwining currents of darkness, implied movement that it didn't have. Nicci blinked, and it was gone. She urgently renewed her effort to move, but she felt as if she was suspended in warm wax. She could breathe to a small extent, and make headway, but only in the most impossibly slow fashion. Every inch took monumental effort and seemed to take an eternity. The world had become impossibly thick as everything slowed toward a halt.

It looked like a woman in a flowing black dress floating underwater. Even in the midst of growing terror, Nicci found the exotic sight strangely fascinating. The others, with the intruder already past them, were in mid-stride ascending the stairs, as still as if caught in a painting. The woman's wiry black hair lifted lazily out all around her bloodless face. The loose fabric of the black dress swirled as if in whirls of water. Within the slow turbulence of black cloth and hair, the woman herself seemed nearly unmoving. It looked like nothing so much as if she were floating under murky water. Then the figure was gone again. No, not underwater, Nicci realized. In the sliph. That's how Nicci felt, too. It was that kind of strange, otherworldly, suspended sensation of drifting. It was impossibly slow and at the same time blindingly fast. The figure suddenly appeared again, closer this time. Nicci tried to call out, but she couldn't. She tried to lift her arms to casi a web, but she drifted too slowly. She thought it might take an entire day just to lift her arm. Sparkling shards of light glimmered and flashed in the air between Nicci and the others. Magic, she knew, cast by the wizard. It fell far short of the intruder.

Then it was gone again. In a blink, it reappeared, much closer yet. The ghostlike skin stretched tight over a bony face looking as if it had never been touched by sunlight. Snarls of weightless black hair rose up with wisps of the flowing black dress. It was as disorienting a sight as Nicci had ever seen. She felt as if she were drowning. Panic welled up in her at the feeling of not being able to breathe fast enough, of trying to get the air she needed. Her burning lungs were unable to work any faster than the rest of her. When Nicci focused her gaze, the figure of the woman was gone. It occurred to her that her eyes, too, were too slow. The hallway was empty again. It seemed that her focus could not keep up with the movement. Nicci thought that maybe she was having some kind of hallucination brought on by the spells she had cast, by the power of Orden she had tapped into. She wondered if it could be some kind of aftereffect of the spells. Maybe it was Orden itself come to claim her for tampering with such forbidden powers.

The woman appeared again, as if floating up through the murky deep, emerging suddenly into view out of the dark abyss. This time Nicci could clearly see the woman's austere, angular features. Blanched blue eyes fixed on Nicci as if there was nothing else in her world. That scrutiny touched Nicci's very soul with icy dread. The woman's eyes were so pale that they seemed as if they had to be sightless, but Nicci knew that this woman could see just fine, not only in the light, but also in the blackest cave, or under a rock where the light of day never touched her. The woman smiled as wicked a grin as Nicci had ever seen. It was the smile of someone who had no fear but enjoyed causing it, a woman who knew she had everything under her mastery. It was a smile that sent a slow shiver through Nicci. And then the woman was gone. In the distance more of Zedd's magic sparked and sputtered briefly before it died out. Nicci struggled to move, but the world was too thick, the way it sometimes felt in those terrible dreams she had, dreams where she struggled to move but simply couldn't despite how hard she tried. It was the dream where she was trying to run from Jagang. He was always close, coming for her, reaching for her. He was like death itself, intent on the most unimaginable cruelty, as he came toward her.

She would have given anything to have had him hold her in his arms and tell her that she was safe, but he didn't. Still, his hand on her face, covered with both of hers, and his gentle words, his empathy, had been a comfort that calmed her terror. This, though, was no dream. Nicci tried to gasp a breath, to call out to Zedd, but could do neither. She tried to call her Han, her gift, but couldn't seem to connect to it. It was as if her gift was impossibly fast and she was impossibly slow. The two wouldn't mesh. The woman, her flesh the pallid color of the freshly dead, her hair and dress as black as the underworld, was suddenly right there, right beside Nicci. The woman's arm floated out, reaching through the swirling black cloth. Parched flesh stretched tightly over her knuckles served to emphasize the skeleton beneath. Her bony fingers brushed along the underside of Nicci's jaw. It was a haughty touch, an arrogant act of triumph. At the touch, the vibration in Nicci's chest felt as if it might tear her apart. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (82 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The woman laughed a hollow, slow, burbling underwater laugh that echoed painfully through the stone halls of the Keep.

Her power seemed impossibly distant, crackling so far away that it would take forever to reach it. As the finger brushed along the length of Nicci's jaw, the woman was gone again, vanishing gently back into the dark depths. The next time she appeared, she was back at the brass-clad doors leading open to the room with the box. The woman drifted through the doorway, her feet never touching the ground, her dress washing lightly around her. Again she vanished out of Nicci's focus. The next time she appeared, she was between the room and Nicci. She had the box of Orden under an arm.. As that terrible laughter echoed through Nicci's mind, the world melted into blackness. CHAPTER 6 Rachel didn't know who the horse belonged to, and she didn't really care. She wanted it. She had been running all night and she was exhausted. She had never stopped to consider why she might be running. It somehow didn't seem important. It mattered only that she keep going, keep making progress. She needed to hurry. She needed to keep going. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (83 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She needed to go faster. She needed the horse. She was certain of the direction in which she had to go. She didn't know why she felt so certain about it. She didn't give that matter any serious thought. It remained only a question from somewhere deep in the back of her mind that never completely surfaced into full conscious concern. As she crouched in the dry, brittle brush, she tried to remain still as a shadow as she figured out what to do. It was hard to stay still because she was so cold. She tried not to shiver for fear of giving herself away. She wanted to rub her arms, but she knew not to because any movement might draw attention. As cold as she was, what concerned her the most was getting the horse. Whoever owned the horse didn't seem to be nearby at the moment. At least, if he was, she couldn't see him. He might be sleeping in the long, brown grass and be too low for her to see where he was. He might be off scouting. Or, he might be waiting, watching for her, maybe with an arrow nocked and at the ready so that once she bolted from cover he could take aim and shoot her down. As scary as such a thought was, her fear of such a thing couldn't compare to her need to keep going, her need to hurry. Rachel checked the sun off through the thick stand of trees, checking her bearings, making sure she knew the direction she needed to go. She surveyed her choices of escape routes.

There was also a shallow, gravel-bottomed stream that ran through part of the open meadow. On the other side of the meadow the stream joined the road and ran beside it as both made their way southeast through the trees. The sun, low, huge-looking, and red, hung just above the horizon. The color matched the color of the scratches all over her arms from running through the brush. Before Rachel realized it, before she had finished thinking it through, her legs were moving. They almost seemed to have a mind of their own. Only a few steps out of the brush she was running, bolting out across the open ground toward the horse. Out of the corner of her eye Rachel caught sight of the man as he suddenly sat up in the tall grass. Just as she had suspected, he had been sleeping. With his leather vest and studded straps holding knives, he looked like one of those Imperial Order men. He appeared to be alone. Probably on a scouting mission. That's what Chase had taught her. Imperial Order troops out alone were likely scouts. She didn't really care who he was. She wanted the horse. She thought that maybe she should be afraid of the man, but she wasn't. She was afraid only of not getting the horse, of not hurrying. The man threw his blanket aside as he shot to his feet. He scrambled into a dead run. He was coming fast, but Rachel's legs had grown long over the summer and she was a fast runner. The soldier yelled at her. She paid him no never mind as she raced toward the bay mare. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (85 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The man threw something at her. She saw it streak by over her left shoulder. It was a knife. At such a distance she knew that it had been a foolish throw-a throw-and-pray, as Chase called it. He taught her to focus, to aim. He'd taught her a lot about knives. She also knew that a running target was difficult to hit with a knife. She was right. The knife missed her by a good margin. With a soft thunk it stuck in a fallen log lying along the way between her and the horse. She yanked the knife out of the rotting log as she ran by and stuck it through her belt as she slowed. The knife was hers now. Chase had taught her to take the enemy's weapons whenever possible and be prepared to use them, especially if the weapon was superior to what she had. He had taught her that in a survival situation she had to use whatever was at hand. Gulping air, she ran under the horse's nose, snatching up the loose ends of the reins, but they were tied to a branch of the fallen log. Her fingers worked frantically to undo the tight knot, but they were numb with cold. They slipped on the leather as she clawed at it. She wanted to scream with frustration, but instead she kept tugging, working the knot. It seemed to take forever to get it loose. As soon as the reins were free she gathered them together in one hand. It was then that she noticed the saddle not far away. She glanced up as the man yelled again calling her a name. He was coming fast. She wouldn't have near enough time to even think about saddling the horse. Saddlebags-probably full of supplies-leaned against the saddle. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (86 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She slipped her arm under the flat piece of leather connecting the two halves of the saddlebag and ducked under the startled horse's neck. Rounding the far side she grabbed a fistful of mane and hung on tightly to help her vault up onto the animal's bare back. The saddlebags were heavy and she almost dropped them, but she held on tight and pulled them up behind her. Even though the horse hadn't been saddled, at least it had on its bridle. Somewhere in the dim recesses of her mind Rachel relished the warmth of the animal. She laid the hefty packs across the horse's withers in front of her legs. There would be food and water inside. She would need both if she was to be able to continue for long. She just assumed that it would be a long journey. The horse snorted, tossing its head. Rachel didn't take the time to gentle the animal as Chase had taught her. She laid the reins over as she thumped the horse's ribs with her heels. The horse danced sideways, not sure about its strange new rider. Rachel glanced over a shoulder and saw the man almost there. Holding a fistful of mane tightly with one hand and the reins with the other, Rachel leaned forward and again thumped her heels into the horse's sides, farther back. The horse bolted into a dead run. The man, cursing, made a frantic dive for the bridle. Rachel jerked the reins to the side and the horse followed. The soldier flew past them and landed on his face, grunting with the force of the impact. Suddenly seeing the thundering hooves so close he cried out, his anger switching to fright as he rolled out of the way. He missed being trampled by inches. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (87 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Rachel felt no sense of triumph. She felt only the compulsion to hurry, to run southeast. The horse obliged. She guided the racing mare to the stream at the far side of the grassy clearing.

Chase had taught her how to use water to hide her tracks. Every galloping stride was one stride closer, and that was all that mattered. CHAPTER 7 When the soldier walking past the wagons tossed the hard-boiled eggs, Richard caught as many as he could. As soon as he had scooped the rest of them up off the ground he gathered them all in the crook of his arm and crawled back under the wagon to get out of the rain. It was a cold, miserable excuse for a shelter, but it was still better than sitting in the rain. After having collected his own booty of eggs, Johnrock, pulling his chain behind, scurried back under the other end of the wagon. \"Eggs again,\" Johnrock said in disgust. \"That's all they ever feed us.

That York.\" Johnrock considered a moment. \"You really think these soldiers eat people?\" Richard glanced over. \"If they run out of food they will turn to eating the dead. If they are hungry enough and run out of dead, they will harvest a new crop.\" \"You think they will run out of food?\" Richard knew they would, but he didn't want to say so. He had instructed the D'Haran forces not only to destroy any supply train from the Old World, but to destroy the Old World's ability to provide for their massive invasion force to the north. \"I'm just saying that it could be worse than eggs.\" Johnrock looked at his eggs in a new light, finally grumbling his agreement. As Johnrock started in peeling an egg of his own, he changed the subject. \"You think they'll make us play Ja'La in the rain?\" Richard swallowed a mouthful of egg before he answered. \"Probably. But I'd rather be playing a game and get warm than sit here freezing all day.\" \"I suppose,\" Johnrock said. \"Besides,\" Richard told him, \"the sooner we can start defeating the teams come for the tournaments, the sooner we work our way up in file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (89 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 the standings, and the sooner we get to play the emperor's team.\" Johnrock grinned at that prospect. Richard was starving, but he forced himself to slow down and savor the meal. As they peeled shells and ate in silence, he kept an eye on the activity in the distance. Even in the rain, men were busy at every sort of work. The sound of hammers at forges rang through the drone of rain and clamor of conversation, yelling, arguing, laughing, and orders being shouted. The vast encampment spread across the flat Azrith Plain to what Richard could see of the horizon. Sitting on the ground it was hard to see a great deal of the larger camp out beyond. He could see wagons and a little farther away the larger tents in the middle distance. Horses rode past while wagons pulled by mules made their way through the milling masses. Men on foot, looking miserable in the rain, stood in lines waiting for food at cook tents. In the distance the People's Palace, sitting on a high plateau, towered over everything. Even in the murk of the gray day, the magnificent stone walls, grand towers, and tiled roofs of the palace stood out above the grimy army come to destroy it. With the steamy vapor rising from the Imperial Order camp, along with the rain and the overcast, the plateau and the palace atop it looked like a distant, noble apparition. There were times when cloud and mist drew across like a curtain and the entire plateau vanished in the gray gloom, as if it had seen enough of the seething horde come to defile it. There was no easy way for any enemy to attack the palace high on the plateau. The road up the side of the cliff walls was far too file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (90 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 narrow for any kind of meaningful assault. Besides that, there was a drawbridge that Richard was certain would have already been raised and, even if it weren't, there were massive walls at the top that were formidable in their own right and little space outside of them to gather any sizable assault force. Except in times of war, the People's Palace drew commerce from all over D'Hara. Supplies for all the people living there were constantly being brought in. Because it was a trade center, great numbers of people came to the palace to buy and sell goods. For all those people, the primary way up to the city palace was through the inside of the plateau itself. Stairs and walkways accommodated the large number of visitors and vendors. There were also wide ramps for horses and wagons. Because so many people traveled up the inside of the plateau, there were shops and stands all along the way. Large numbers of people came for those market stands and never made the journey all the way up to the city at the top. The entire inside of the plateau was honeycombed with rooms of every sort. Some of the interior spaces were public, but some were not. There were large numbers of soldiers of the First File-the palace guard- barracked there. The problem, from the perspective of the Imperial Order, was that the great doors to those inner access areas were closed. Those doors had been made to stand against any kind of attack, and there were enough supplies stored inside for a long siege. Outside, the Azrith Plain was not at all a hospitable place for forces to gather for a siege. While deep wells inside the plateau provided water for the inhabitants, outside on the Azrith Plain there was no file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (91 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 steady supply of water nearby, except the occasional rain, and there was no close source of firewood. On top of that, the weather out on the plain was harsh. The Imperial Order did have plenty of gifted with them, but they couldn't be much help in breaching the palace defenses. The very construction of the palace was in the form of a protection spell that magnified the power of the ruling Lord Rahl while at the same time hindering the power of others. Inside that plateau, and in the city atop it, the ability of any gifted but a Rahl was severely blunted by that spell. Because he was a Rahl, such a spell would ordinarily be a benefit for Richard, if it were not for the fact that he had somehow been cut off from his gift. He was pretty sure how that had been accomplished. Chained to a wagon, in the middle of an enemy force numbering in the millions, though, he couldn't do a whole lot about it. Other than the plateau and the palace atop it, the thing that stood out highest of all out on the Azrith Plain was the ramp that the Imperial Order was constructing. Without an easy way to attack the seat of power of the D'Haran Empire, the last obstacle standing in the way of their total domination of the New World, Jagang had apparently come up with a plan to build an enormous ramp to get enough forces to the top of the plateau to breach the walls. He planned not simply to besiege the People's Palace, but to assault it. At first Richard had thought such a task impossible, but as he had studied what Jagang's army was doing, he'd quickly become disheartened to realize that it just might work. While the plateau file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (92 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 was an imposing height, towering high above the Azrith Plain, the Imperial Order surrounding it had millions of men to devote to the undertaking. From Jagang's perspective, this was his last objective, the last place he needed to crush in order to establish the unopposed rule of the Imperial Order. As far as the emperor was concerned, he had no other battles to fight, no more armies to destroy, no more cities to capture. The city on top of the plateau was all that stood in their way. The Imperial Order-the brutes who enforced the faith demanded by the Fellowship of Order-could not allow the people of the New World to live outside the control of the Order, because it put the lie to the teachings of their spiritual leaders. The Brothers of the Order taught that individual choice was immoral because it was ruinous to mankind. The very existence of a prosperous, independent, free people stood in stark contrast to the foundational doctrines of the Order. The Order had condemned the people of the New World as selfish and evil, and required them to convert to the beliefs of the Order, or die. Having millions of soldiers with time on their hands as they waited to enforce faith in the Order's beliefs was no doubt troublesome. Jagang had found a task to keep them all busy, a sacrifice to the cause; they were all now devoted to working in shifts every hour of the day and night at the construction of the ramp. While Richard couldn't see the men down lower, he knew that they had to be digging dirt and rock. As those excavation pits grew ever larger, other men carried the dirt to the site of the ramp.

Richard hadn't been in the camp for long, but he imagined that day by day he would soon be able to see the sloping ramp growing inexorably toward the top of the plateau. \"How will you die?\" Johnrock asked. Richard was sick of watching the distant ramp, of contemplating the dark and savage future the Order would enforce on everyone. Johnrock's question, though, wasn't exactly a ray of sunshine in the gloom. Richard slumped back against the inside of the wheel on the far side of the wagon as he ate eggs. \"You think I will have a choice?\" he finally asked. \"A say in the matter?\" Richard rested a forearm over his knee, gesturing with half an egg. \"We make choices about how we will live, Johnrock. I don't think we have nearly so much say, about how we will die.\" Johnrock looked surprised by the answer. \"You think we have a choice about how we live? Ruben, we have no choice.\" \"We have choices,\" Richard said without explanation. He popped the half of an egg in his mouth. Johnrock lifted the chain attached to his collar. \"How can I make any choice?\" He gestured out at the encampment. \"They are our masters.\" \"Masters? They have chosen not to think for themselves and instead to live according to the teachings of the Order. In so doing they are not even the masters of their own lives.\" Johnrock shook his head in astonishment. \"Sometimes, Ruben, you say the strangest things. I am a slave.

Is that choosing to live? I don't think so. They wear chains that they have put around their own necks, chains of a different kind, but chains nonetheless.\" \"I fought when they came to take me. The Imperial Order won. Now I am chained here. Those men live, but if we try to be free we will die.\" Richard wiped the remaining bits of shell off an egg. \"We all have to die, Johnrock-every one of us. It is how we choose to live that matters. After all, it's the only life each one of us will ever have, so how we live is of paramount importance.\" Johnrock chewed for a moment as he thought it over. Finally, with a grin, he seemed to dismiss the whole matter. \"Well, if I do end up having to choose how I will die, I wish it to be to the cheers of the crowd for how well I played the game.\" He glanced over at Richard. \"And you, Ruben? If you have to choose?\" Richard had other things on his mind-important things. \"I hope not to have to decide the matter this day.\" Johnrock sighed heavily.

Despite everything, he was smiling. Despite how true Johnrock's words were-that they very well might die in this place-he was smiling. Still, he didn't want to discuss Kahlan with the man. \"I saw a lot of things when we rolled into this camp.\" \"Soon enough, after the games,\" Johnrock said, \"and if we do well, there will be women enough. Snake-face has promised us. But now there are just soldiers and more soldiers. You must have been seeing phantoms yesterday.\" Richard stared off at nothing, nodding. \"I guess you're far from the first to think that she's a phantom.\" Johnrock heaved a length of chain out of his way and scooted closer to Richard. \"Ruben, you'd better get your head straight or we're going to get ourselves killed before we even get a chance to play the emperor's team.\" Richard looked up. \"I thought you were ready to die.\" \"I don't want to die.

You said that you saw the woman you want to be your wife.\" Richard didn't correct him. \"I just want for us to play well and win all our games so that we can have the chance to play the emperor's team.\" Johnrock's grin returned. \"Do you really think we can beat the emperor's team, Ruben? Do you think we can survive such a game with those men?\" Richard cracked the shell of another egg on the side of his heel. \"You're the one who wants to die to cheers of the crowds for how well you've played.\" Johnrock gave Richard a sidelong glance. \"Maybe I will do as you say and choose to live free, yes?\" Richard only smiled before biting the egg in half. Not long after Richard and Johnrock had finished the last of their meal, Commander Karg appeared, his boots splashing as he marched toward them through the mud. \"Get out here! All of you!\" Richard and Johnrock crawled out from under the wagon into the drizzle. Other captives at wagons to either side stood up, waiting to hear what the commander wanted. Soldiers who were on the team file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (97 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 gathered closer. \"We're going to have visitors,\" Commander Karg announced. \"What kind of visitors?\" one of the soldiers asked. \"The emperor is touring the teams that arrived for the tournament.

Any man who doesn't reflect well on me, or who fails to show the proper respect for our emperor, will be of no use to me.\" Without further word, the commander hurried away. Richard could feel himself swaying on his feet as his heart pounded. He wondered if Kahlan would be with Jagang, as she had been the day before. While he desperately wanted to see her again, he hated to think of her being anywhere near that man. For that matter, he hated to think of her being anywhere near any of these men. Over the winter, when Nicci had captured Richard and taken him down to the Old World, Kahlan, in his place, had led the D'Haran forces. She was the one responsible for keeping Jagang from having the victory back then that he might otherwise have had. She had been responsible for whittling down the ranks of Order soldiers, even if the endless supplies from the Old World had included reinforcements that more than replenished all the men lost. Kahlan had not only delayed the invaders, but earned their undying hatred for all the pain she had inflicted upon them. Were it not for Kahlan the Order probably would have caught the D'Haran army and slaughtered them. She had kept them one step ahead of Jagang and just out of his reach. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (98 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Trying to look composed, Richard leaned back against the wagon and folded his arms as he waited. Before long he caught sight of an entourage off to the left making their way through the encampment. They were mov-ing down the line of teams in the distance, pausing at regular intervals along the way to take a closer look. Judging by the types of soldiers Richard could see making up the group, it could be none other than the emperor that they escorted. Richard recognized the royal guard from the day before when he had rolled through the camp and right past Jagang. That was when he had briefly seen Kahlan. The emperor's guards were intimidating in their mail and leather and with their well-made weapons, but it was the size of the men and their bulging, rain- slicked muscles that was truly daunting. These were men who even struck fear into the hearts of the regular brutes of the Order. Those regular troops all fell back well clear of the royal guard. Richard didn't imagine that such men were at all tolerant of anything they believed might potentially be a threat to the emperor. Johnrock stepped forward to join the other men waiting in a line for the emperor to review them. It was when Richard saw Jagang's shaved head off in the center of the ranks of muscled guards that the sudden realization hit him. Jagang would recognize him. Jagang, as a dream walker, had been in the minds of various people and he had seen Richard though their eyes. Richard could hardly believe how careless he had been not to even con-sider that when he played the emperor's team in order to get close enough to file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (99 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan, Jagang would be there, and Jagang would recognize him. Dis-tracted by the thought of actually getting to Kahlan, he hadn't taken such a prospect into consideration. Richard noticed something else, then-a Sister. It looked like Sister Ulicia, but if it was, she had aged a great deal since he'd last seen her. She was farther away, back at the tail end of all the guards following Jagang, but Richard could still see the sagging creases in her face. The last time he had seen her she'd been an attractive woman, although Richard had difficulty separating a person's looks from their personality, and Sister Ulicia was one sinister woman. No matter how superficially attractive a person was, a cruel personality tainted Richard's image of them. Corrupt character colored his appraisal of a person to such an extent that he could not see them as attractive separate from their vicious nature. That was also one of the reasons Kahlan was so beautiful to him- she was not simply stunningly attractive, but exemplary in every way. Her intelligence and insight were matched by her passion for life. It was as if her captivating looks perfectly reflected everything else about her. Sister Ulicia, despite how physically attractive she once had been, now appeared to reflect only the rot at her core. Richard realized then that not only would Jagang and Sister Ulicia recognize him, but there would be other Sisters in the camp who also knew him. He suddenly felt very vulnerable.

He had nowhere to hide. When he got close enough, Jagang would not fail to see that Lord Rahl, the very man he was after, was right there in his midst. Chained as he was, without his ability to use his Han, even as difficult as it had been for him to call forth his gift when he'd had access to it, Richard would be at Jagang's mercy. He had a sickening flash of a vision that Shota the witch woman had given him. It had been a vision of being executed. It had been raining in that vision, much as it was raining now. Kahlan had been there. In tearful terror she had watched as his wrists had been bound behind his back and he was made to kneel in the mud. As he knelt there, with Kahlan screaming his name, a big brute of a soldier came up behind him, promising to have Kahlan for himself as he brought a long knife around before Richard's face, and then with a mighty effort cut deep through his throat. Richard realized that he was touching his throat, as if to comfort the gaping wound. He was panting in a panic. He felt a hot wave of nausea welling up through him. Was this to be Shota's vision come to life? Was this what she had been warning him about? Was this to be the day he died? It was all happening too fast. He hadn't been ready for this. But what could he have done to get ready? \"Ruben!\" Commander Karg yelled. \"Get up here!\" Richard struggled to get control of his emotions. He took a deep breath and worked to calm himself as he started moving, knowing that if he didn't it was only going to get ugly even faster. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (101 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Not far away, the clot of men had stopped at the next team up the line.

He knew that he couldn't hide behind the other men. He was point man. Jagang would want to see the team's point man. And then he caught a glimpse of Kahlan. Richard moved as if in a dream. The whole cluster of men around the emperor and Kahlan had started turning in the direction of Richard and his team. Knowing that he had to get up with the other men, Richard started to step over the chain attached to Johnrock's collar. Just then he had an idea. He hurried forward and deliberately let his foot catch the chain. He fell face-first in the mud. Commander Karg went red with rage. \"Ruben-you clumsy idiot! Get on your feet!\" Richard scrambled to his feet as Jagang's guards began parting for the emperor. Richard stood up tall next to Johnrock. With a finger, he wiped mud from his eyes. He blinked to clear his vision. It was then that he spotted Kahlan. She was walking just behind Jagang. The hood of her cloak, pulled up to protect her against the rain, partially hid her face. Richard recognized every familiar movement of her body. No one moved quite the way she moved. Their eyes met.

She had looked so noble in that white dress. He remembered the way she had looked directly at him without speaking-a gaze that was questioning and at the same time guarded, a gaze that instantly and clearly conveyed her intelligence. He had never seen anyone before that moment who looked so . . . valiant. He thought that he had probably been in love with her from that first instant, from that first look into her beautiful green eyes. He had been sure that in that first look into those eyes he had seen her soul. Now there was all that, along with a hint of confused concern in her expression. Because of the way his gaze fixed on her, followed her, she was aware that he could see her. Being the object of the Chainfire spell, she wouldn't remember who he was or, for that matter, who she was. Other than Richard and the Sisters who had taken her prisoner and ignited the Chainfire spell, no one could remember her. Obviously, Jagang was not affected by the spell. Richard surmised that it probably had something to do with a connection to the Sisters. But Kahlan would be invisible to everyone else. She recognized, though, that Richard could see her. In the isolation imposed by the spell, that had to be something profoundly important and meaningful for her. In fact, by the look on her face, he could see that it was. Before Jagang could begin to get close enough to inspect the team, a man called out as he ran up to the group.

Since he carried only minimal weapons-a couple of knives-Richard reasoned that he was probably a messenger. He was winded but seemed to be in a great hurry. When he made it to the emperor, the man bent close, speaking excitedly but in a low voice. At one point in his report, he gestured across the camp toward the area where the construction of the ramp was taking place. Kahlan, pulling her gaze from Richard, looked over at the man speaking with Jagang. Richard surveyed a cadre of other guards, closer in, who surrounded her. They weren't the royal guard, and in fact they were careful to stay out of the way of the imposing royal guards. These men looked more like the regular soldiers of the camp. Their weapons weren't well made. They had no chain mail or armor. Their clothes seemed to be a collection of whatever they could find that looked the part of the rest of the army. They were big men, young and strong, but they were not the match of the emperor's guards. They looked more like common thugs. Richard realized, then, that they could only be guarding Kahlan. Unlike Jagang's guards, who seemed unmindful of her presence, these men frequently glanced at Kahlan, checking on her every move. That could only mean that these men could see her. Jagang's guards never looked at Kahlan, but these men did. Somehow, they were able to see her. Somehow, Jagang had found men to guard her who were not affected by the spell. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (104 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 At first questioning if he was really right that they could see her, and confused by how such a thing was possible, Richard finally realized that it actually did make sense. The Chainfire spell, like the world of magic itself, had been contaminated by the chimes. That contamination eroded the ability of magic to function. The whole purpose of the chimes was to destroy magic. Because of the taint left by their presence in the world of life, the Chainfire spell's very makeup had been impaired. When Zedd and Nicci had run the verification web, Richard had discovered the damage to the structure of the spell itself. Because of that contamination within the Chainfire spell, it didn't function as designed. It was flawed. It only made sense that such a flaw might allow a few people to escape its effects. Richard remembered how the plague, sweeping through the population like a wildfire, didn't touch everyone. There were a few people-even some who cared for the sick and dying-who never contracted the plague themselves. This must be something like that. There were bound to be a few people who weren't affected by the Chainfire event and would therefore be able to see Kahlan. It would certainly explain why there were guards who could see her. As those special guards, distracted by the man speaking to Jagang with such urgency, turned to try to see better what was happening with the emperor, Kahlan made a small move to turn with them. It looked perfectly natural; Richard knew it was anything but. As she turned, Kahlan adjusted the hood of her cloak against the rain, and as her hand came back down it passed close to one of her guards. Richard saw that the sheath at the man's belt was empty.

He wanted to laugh out loud, to cheer, but he didn't dare move a muscle. Kahlan caught him looking at her and realized that he had to have seen what she'd just done. She watched him a moment to see if he might betray her. She was using the hood of her cloak to hide her face from those guarding her, to prevent them from seeing that she was looking obliquely at Richard. When he didn't move, she turned and along with the guards watched what was going on between the messenger and the emperor. Jagang suddenly swung around and started away, returning back the way he'd come, the messenger right on his heels. Kahlan briefly glanced back over a shoulder to catch one last glimpse of Richard before the guards could all close in around the emperor and his captive. As she did so, and the hood of her cloak moved just enough, Richard saw the dark bruise on her left cheek. Hot anger blazed through him. Every fiber of his being wanted to do something, to act, to get her away from Jagang, to get her out of this camp. His mind raced to come up with something, anything, but, chained as he was, there was nothing he could do. This was not the time or place he could act.

Not even the cold rain could cool his bottled fury. Even as his mind raced through every possible action, he knew that there was nothing he could do. Not now, anyway.

Of course, as he had demonstrated any number of times, he needed no excuse. She knew, though, that right then she had better not even look like she might give him cause, because he was in a hurry due to the strange news the man had brought. She didn't care so much about the news, though. Her mind was on the man she had finally seen again, the captive who had been brought in the day before. As she moved through the encampment, thinking about the man, she watched not only her guards but also the common soldiers in the camp, looking for reactions that might indicate that they could see her, listening for any obscene remark that would betray them. All around, startled men stared at the heavily armed group making their way through the midst of their daily life, but she didn't see a single man look directly at her, or show any other signs of seeing her. Despite being men in an army led by the emperor himself, these men had probably never seen Jagang this close before. The army, all in one place, constituted a population that was larger than almost any city. If these men had ever seen the emperor before, it was likely only at a great distance. Now, as he passed close by, they stared at him in open awe. Kahlan noted in their reaction, and Jagang's attitude toward them, the contradiction to the Order's teachings of the absolute equality of all men. For his part, Jagang never showed any penchant for sharing the common life of his men, a daily existence in the filth file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (111 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 and mud. They lived in a camp that was virtually lawless, involved in crimes of every sort with their unruly fellows, while Jagang always enjoyed protection from those theoretically equal to him in every way. Kahlan supposed that if they shared one thing, it was that they, like their emperor, lived lives of almost constant, irrational violence and complete indifference to human life. Kahlan, invisible to the soldiers all around, stepped carefully over puddles and dung. She clutched the knife tightly in a fist under her cloak, unsure, yet, exactly what she would do with it. The opportunity to take the knife had suddenly presented itself and she had acted. In such rough surroundings it felt good to have a weapon. The encampment was a frightening place, despite how invisible she was to nearly all the soldiers. Even though she knew that she had no hope of using the knife to escape Jagang, all of her special guards, and the Sisters, it still felt good to have a weapon. A weapon gave her a modicum of control, a way to defend herself-at least to a degree. More than that, though, a weapon symbolized how much she valued her life. Having it was a declaration to herself that she had not, and would not, give up. If she had a chance, Kahlan would use the knife to try to kill Jagang. She knew that if she were to actually accomplish such a deed it would mean a sure death for her as well. She knew, too, that the Order would not falter because of the loss of the man. They were like ants. Stepping on one would not send the colony into retreat.

She had already seen him murder several people for little or no excuse, so putting an end to him would at least serve to satisfy her sense of justice. Kahlan's memory of her past life was gone. Her total awareness since the Sisters had taken that memory was that of a world gone mad. She might not be able to set the world right, but if she could kill Jagang she might be able to see justice done in one little part of it. It wouldn't be easy, though. Jagang was not only physically powerful and skilled at combat, he was a very clever individual. Sometimes Kahlan thought that he really could read her mind. In another way, since Jagang was a warrior and he was often able to anticipate what she would do next, Kahlan thought that in the past she could not remember she must have been a warrior, too. Alerted by the urgent whispers of their friends, men in the camp all around came out of tents, rubbed sleep from their eyes, and stood in the drizzle staring at the swift procession in their midst. Other men turned from work at caring for animals to watch. Riders reined in their horses to wait until the emperor passed. Wagons rumbled to a halt. No matter where she was in the camp it stank, but in among the men it was a degree worse. The cook fires added greasy soot to the smell of the latrines. She didn't think that the hastily dug latrines were going to be adequate for long. By the foul look of the little streams of water wending their way through the camp, they were already overflowing.

Even with the stench and the revolting sights of some of the things going on in the camp, Kahlan noted it all only dimly in the back of her mind. Her thoughts were on other things. Or rather, on one thing: that man with the gray eyes. She hadn't known which team he would be with. When she had seen his face the day before he had been in a cage on a transport wagon. She knew only, from catching bits of Jagang's conversations with officers, that the cages held some of the men who were on a team come to play in the tournaments. Jagang had been eager to tour the teams before any of the games were to begin. As they went from team to team, she had been looking for the man. At first, she hadn't even realized that she was doing it. She found herself staying close to Jagang as he inspected the players so that she could also see them. He knew a great deal about some of the teams. He commented to his guards about what he expected he would see before he reached each new team. When he arrived at a new group he would ask to see the point man, along with the wing men. Several times he wanted to have a look at the men of the blocking line. It reminded Kahlan of a housewife at market, inspecting cuts of meat. Kahlan had searched all the faces she saw, looking at every man. She had not been gauging their height, weight, and muscle, as Jagang had been doing. She had found herself looking at their faces, trying to find the man she had seen in the cage the day before. She was beginning to lose heart, thinking that he must not be among the teams.

Everyone else thought the man was just clumsy as he tripped over the chain lying there on the ground. As they'd approached the team some of the guards had laughed, whispering among themselves about how quickly such a man was going to get his neck broken on the Ja'La field. Kahlan hadn't thought it was funny, though. She alone had been looking at the man and she knew that he hadn't tripped accidentally. She knew that it had been deliberate. The fall had looked real enough. No one else imagined that it had been by design. Kahlan knew it was. She knew what it was to be a captive and have to instancy do something no matter how risky because you had no choice. She just couldn't imagine why the man had done it. What could be the purpose of such a thing? What danger could he have been trying to avoid? In some circumstances people did such things to get a laugh-and some of the guards had laughed-but that wasn't the purpose behind what this man had done. To Kahlan's mind it had been not only deliberate, but done with haste, as if he thought of it only a second before and there was no time to come up with something better.

Or possibly Sister Ulicia. At any rate, it had to be that he was trying to keep from being recognized. She supposed that it did make some sense. After all, the man was a captive. Only enemies of the Order would be captives. She wondered if he was a high-ranking officer or something like that. And he had known Kahlan. From the first instant their eyes met the day before, when he had been in that cage, she could see that he recognized her. As she had approached his team with Jagang, she and the man had shared a look. In that look she saw that they both knew the plight the other was in, and they both had done nothing to betray the other, as if they'd made a silent pact. It lifted Kahlan's heart to know that among all these murderous men, there was one who was not an enemy. At least, she didn't think he was. She reminded herself not to substitute her imagination for the truth. With her memory gone she had no real way of knowing if he was an enemy or not.

But if he was trying to hide his face to keep from being recognized, what was going to happen once the Ja'La games started? He might be able to stay muddy for a day or two, but once the rain stopped the mud was going to dry up. She wondered what he would do then. She couldn't help feeling a pang of worry for him. At the end of visiting the teams, as they had left to see what the messenger had to show Jagang, she had seen one other thing in the man's eyes: rage. As she had turned back for a last, quick look at him, the hood of her cloak had pulled back and he had seen the black bruise Jagang had left on her face. Kahlan had thought that he looked like he might use his bare hands to rip apart the chain holding him. She was at least relieved that he was smart enough not to try to do anything. Commander Karg would have killed him in a blink. From the conversations between Jagang and the commander as Jagang had started out to inspect the teams, the two were old acquaintances. They mentioned battles they had been in together. In that brief conversation she had taken appraisal of the commander. Like Jagang himself, the commander was not a man to be underestimated. Such a man would not have wanted to be embarrassed before his emperor, and would have killed his point man without hesitation had he allowed his anger to slip its bounds. She supposed that it was that, his anger at seeing what Jagang had done to her, that made her think the man could not be her enemy. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (117 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 But the man was dangerous as well. The way he stood, the way he balanced, the way he moved, told Kahlan a great deal about him. She could clearly see the intelligence in his raptor gaze. In the measured way he moved she saw that he also was a man not to be underestimated. She would know for sure if she was correct once the games started, but a man like Commander Karg would not have a captive be his point man unless there was a very good reason. Kahlan would know soon enough when she saw the man play, but to her he looked like coiled fury, and like he knew how to uncoil. \"Over this way, Excellency,\" the messenger said as he pointed off through the gray drizzle. They followed the messenger, leaving the dark sea of the camp, emerging out onto the open ground of the Azrith Plain. Kahlan had been so preoccupied thinking about the man with the gray eyes that she hadn't even noticed that they were coming up on the site of the construction. The ramp rose high overhead. Beyond, the plateau towered above them. Up this close the plateau truly was imposing. Up this close she could see far less of the magnificent palace atop it. When it had started to rain she had hoped that maybe it would cause the ramp to collapse, but she could see, now that they were there beside it, that it was not only reinforced with rock but being well compacted as material was added. Gangs of men with heavy weights tamped the dirt and rock as it was placed. This was not a haphazard effort.

They were the ones supervising the construction; the brutes merely handled the dirt. As ignorant and unaware as the general population of soldiers was, Jagang surrounded himself with competent men. His personal guards, as big and powerful as they were, were hardly idiots. Those overseeing the construction of the ramp were likewise intelligent men. The men supervising the project knew what they were doing and were confident enough to contradict Jagang when he suggested something that wouldn't work. Jagang had initially wanted to make the base of the ramp narrower so that they could build height more quickly. While respectful, they were not afraid to tell him that it wouldn't work, and why. He had listened carefully and, when satisfied that they were right, let them proceed with their plans even though those plans had been contrary to his initial desire. When Jagang thought he was right, though, he was as determined as a bull to have his way. Numerous lines of men, each twelve or fifteen men deep, stretched back away from the colossal ramp. Some of the men passed baskets filled with dirt and rock, and some passed back empty baskets. Other men wheeled carts carrying rock. Mules pulled trains of wagons hauling larger rock. The project was massive almost beyond belief, but with so many men constantly adding to it, the ramp grew steadily.

The lines of men parted as the royal procession marched through, then melted back together. As they made their way past throngs of workers, Kahlan finally saw the pits where men in astounding numbers dug material for the ramp. There seemed to be countless numbers of vast pits in the ground, each with one sloping end where men were carrying material out as others brought empty baskets, carts, and wagons back down in to be loaded. The array of pits stretched as far as she could see into the gray drizzle. Jagang and his party made their way along the wide tracks between the pits arranged in a grid across the plain. Those pathways between were wide enough to accommodate wagons going in opposite directions. \"Down here, Excellency. This is the place.\" Jagang paused, peering down the long, sloping ramp into the pit. It appeared to be the only excavation that was deserted. He looked around at the other pits nearby. \"Clear this one, here, as well,\" he said, gesturing at the next pit lying in the direction of the plateau. \"And don't start any new digging beyond in the same direction.\" Some of the supervisors who had gathered hurried to carry out his instructions. \"Let's go,\" Jagang said. \"I want to see if this is really something or not.\" \"I'm sure you will find it as I described, Excellency.\" Jagang ignored the angular messenger as he started down the sloping track file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (120 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 into the pit. Kahlan stayed close. A glance back revealed Sister Ulicia not a dozen steps behind. The Sister, without a hood on her cloak and with her wet hair plastered to her head, did not look at all pleased to be out in the rain. Kahlan turned back to watch her footing on the slick, muddy slope. The bottom of the pit was an uneven mess where thousands of men had toiled at digging and loading. Since some of the ground was softer and easier to dig, those places were deeper. In other spots, where it was more rocky and harder to dig, there were mounds nearly twice Kahlan's height that had yet to be reduced. Following the messenger through the disorder, Jagang descended into one of the deeper areas. Kahlan followed them down into the muck, her guards staying close around her. She wanted to stay close to Jagang in case he became distracted by whatever was in the pit. If she got a chance, no matter the risk, she would try to kill him. The messenger squatted down as they came to a halt. \"This is it, Excel-lency.\" He slapped his hand on something just peeking up from the ground. Kahlan frowned, looking along with everyone else at the smooth expanse that had been exposed. The messenger had been right, it definitely did not look natural. She could see what looked like joints. It did look like a structure buried deep in the ground. \"Clean it off,\" Jagang said to some of the foremen from the project who had come down into the pit. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (121 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Apparently, as per standing orders, when the structure had been discov-ered all work was abandoned and the workers pulled out until Jagang could personally inspect the find. The form was slightly rounded, as if they had uncovered the very top portion of a massive, long, rounded shape. As men worked with shovels and brooms, Jagang directing where they dug, it quickly became apparent that the messenger had been accurate in his report: it did look like the exterior of a barrel- vaulted ceiling. As the men cleaned it off, Kahlan could see that the structure was made of large stones cut to precise shapes to make up the curve of the arch. It reminded her of nothing so much as a buried building, except that there was no roof, just the exposed outer structure of an interior vaulted ceiling. Kahlan could not imagine what such a thing could be doing buried all the way out here on the Azrith Plain. There was no telling how many hun-dreds of even thousands of years whatever was inside had been entombed. When enough of the dirt and debris had been cleared off, Jagang crouched down and ran his hand over the wet stone. His fingers traced a few of the joints. They were so tight that not even a thin knife blade would have slipped between them. \"Get some tools down here-pry bars and such,\" he said. \"I want this opened. I want to know what's down inside it.\" \"At once, Excellency,\" one of the construction bosses said. \"Use your assistants instead of the laborers.\" Jagang stood, sweeping an arm around at the general area. \"I want this whole place cordoned off.

The plundered rings he wore said that Jagang knew the same thing. Kahlan glanced up when she noticed some of Jagang's guards rushing down the slope into the pit. They pushed their way through the construction foremen and other guards to get in near the emperor. \"We got her,\" one of the breathless men reported. Jagang smiled a slow, wicked grin. \"Where is she?\" The man pointed. \"Just up there, Excellency.\" Jagang glanced briefly at Kahlan. She didn't know what he was up to, but the look he gave her ran a chill up her spine. \"Bring her down here, now,\" Jagang told the man. He and another of the guards hurried back up the slope to get whoever it was they had. Kahlan could not imagine who the men had been talking about, and why it gave Jagang such satisfaction. As they waited, the construction supervisors continued to expose more of the buried structure. In short order, a stretch of the stone nearly fifty feet long had been exposed. All of it that they had uncovered ran in a straight line, the arch uniform along the entire length. Other men worked at widening the excavation around the smooth stonework. The more of it they uncovered, the more the shape-and scale-of it came into view. This was no small thing.

The men each held a thin, spindly arm of a girl not half their height. It was Jillian, the girl from back in the ancient ruins in the city of Caska, the girl Kahlan had helped to escape. Kahlan had killed two of Jagang's guards and Sister Cecilia so that Jillian could get away. As the guards brought the helpless girl forward, her copper-colored eyes finally caught sight of Kahlan. Those eyes filled with tears at all that had been lost, at her failure to evade the men of the Order. The guards brought her in close and stood her up before the emperor. \"Well, well,\" Jagang said with a shallow, gruff chuckle, \"look what we have here.\" \"I'm sorry,\" the girl whispered up at Kahlan.

She was not about to join his game. \"What we have here,\" he said in answer to his own question, \"is someone who can help you behave.\" She gave him a blank look and didn't ask. Jagang unexpectedly pointed at the waist of one of Kahlan's special guards, the one standing just to her right. \"Where's your knife?\" The man looked down at his belt as if he was afraid a snake might be about to sink its fangs into him. He looked back up from the empty scabbard. \"Excellency ... I, I must have lost it.\" Jagang's icy look made the man's face pale. \"You lost it, all right.\" Jagang spun and backhanded Jillian hard enough to send her flying -through the air.

The damp air rang with a loud crack as bone shattered. The man collapsed dead into the mud. The flood of blood was shocking in the gray light.

That reputation will unsettle those who have to face us next.\" \"Come on, Johnrock,\" one of the other men said as he impatiently folded his arms. The rest of the team gathered around watching nodded their agreement. None of them really wanted to be first. Most of them, but not all, had at least been won over by Richard's explanation of what the paint would do for them. Johnrock, looking around at all the men waiting, finally grimaced. \"All right, go ahead.\" Richard glanced past his wing man to the guards with arrows nocked and at the ready. Now that the chains had been removed from the captives, the guards watched for any sign of trouble as file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (128 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 they waited to take the team to their first match. Commander Karg always stationed a heavy guard whenever Richard and the other captives were not chained. Richard noted, though, that most of the arrows were pointed in his direction. Focusing again on Johnrock, he spread his fingers and grabbed the top of the man's head to hold him still. Richard had been fretting about what he would paint on the faces of the team. When he'd first come up with the idea, he had thought that maybe he would simply have each man paint his own face in whatever manner he wanted. After brief consideration he realized that he couldn't leave it up to the men. Too much was at risk. Besides that, they all wanted Richard to do it. He was the point man. It had been his idea. He figured that most of them had been hesitant because they believed that they were going to be laughed at, and so they had wanted it to be by his hand rather than their own. Richard dipped his finger in the small bucket of red paint. He had decided against using the brush Commander Karg had brought along with the paint. Richard wanted to feel the act of drawing directly. In the little time he'd had, he'd given a great deal of thought to what he would paint. He knew that it had to be something that would accomplish what he'd intended in the first place. In order to make it work the way he'd described, he had to draw the things he knew. He had to draw the dance with death. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (129 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The dance with death, after all, was ultimately centered on life, yet the meaning of the dance with death was not merely the singular concept of survival. The purpose of the forms was to be able to meet evil and destroy it. in that manner enabling one to preserve life, even one's own. It was a fine distinction, but an important one: it required recognizing the existence of evil in order to be able to fight for life. While the vital necessity of recognizing the existence of evil was obvious to Richard, it was clearly a concept that many people willfully refused to face. They chose to be blind, to live in a fantasy world. The dance with death would not allow such lethal fantasies. Survival required the clear and conscious recognition of reality; therefore the dance with death required that one recognize truth. It was all part of a whole and would not succeed if parts were ignored or left out. The elements of the dance with death-their forms-were at their base the components of every manner of combat, from a debate, to a game, to nghting to the death. Drawn in a language of emblems, those components built the concepts making up the dance. Using those concepts involved seeing what was really happening-in part and in whole-in order to counter it. The ultimate purpose of the dance with death was winning life. The translation of Ja'La dh Jin was \"the Game of Life.\" The things that belonged to a war wizard all played some part in the dance with death. In that way a war wizard was devoted to life.

He knew those moves from fighting with the Sword of Truth. Even if he didn't have the sword any longer, he grasped the totality of what was involved in the meaning of the dance with death, and therefore the knowledge he'd gained from using the sword remained with him whether or not he had the sword itself. As Zedd had often reminded him in the beginning, the sword was just a tool; it was the mind behind the weapon that mattered. Along the way, since Zedd had first given Richard the sword, he had come to understand the language of emblems. He knew their meaning. They spoke to him. He recognized the symbols belonging to a war wizard, and understood what they meant. Using his finger, Richard began laying down those lines on Johnrock's face. They were the lines of parts of the dance, the forms used to meet the enemy. Each combination of lines making up an element had meaning. Cut, sidestep, thrust, twist, spin, slash, follow through, deliver death swiftly even as you prepare to meet the next target. The lines he put on Johnrock's right cheek were admonitions to watch for all that would come at you, without focusing too narrowly. Besides the elements of the dance, Richard found himself drawing parts of spells he had seen. At first he didn't realize he was doing it. At first, as he drew those components, he had trouble recalling where he'd seen them before. Then he remembered that they were parts of the spells that Darken Rahl had drawn in the sorcerer's sand in the Garden of Life as he had invoked the magic necessary to open the boxes of Orden. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (131 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard realized only then that the visit by the strange, ghostly figure the previous night still weighed heavily on his mind. The voice had told him that he'd been named a player. This was the first day of winter. He had one year to open the correct box of Orden. Richard had been exhausted, but he could think of little else after that encounter. He had been unable to get much sleep. Being distracted by the pain of the wound in his leg and the one on his back kept him from fully devoting his mind to reasoning it out. The first day of winter had brought the inspection by Jagang. With his sudden concern over how to avoid being recognized by Jagang and all the Sisters in the Order's encampment, Richard hadn't been able to consider how it was possible for him to be a player for the boxes of Orden. He wondered if it could be some kind of mistake-some misdirection of magic caused by the contamination left by the chimes. Even if he had the knowledge, which he didn't, his gift had been cut off by that witch woman, Six, so he didn't see how he could have somehow inadvertently put the boxes in play. He couldn't imagine how such a thing as opening the correct box would be able to be accomplished without his gift. He wondered if Six could be at the center of it all, if it could be some part of a plot he didn't yet understand. Back when Darken Rahl had been drawing those spells just before he opened one of the boxes, Richard had not understood anything about their composition. Zedd had told him that drawing such spells was dangerous in the extreme, and that one misplaced line, drawn by the right person, in the right circumstance, in the right file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (132 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 medium, could invoke disaster. At the time all the drawings had seemed like arcane motifs executed with mysterious elements that were all part of some complex foreign language. As Richard had come to learn more about magical designs and emblems, he had come to grasp the meaning behind some of their elements-in much the same way he had at first learned the ancient language of High D'Haran by first coming to recognize individual words. As his understanding of words grew, he was able to grasp the ideas the words were expressing. In much that same way, he had come to learn that some of the parts of the spells Darken Rahl had drawn to open the boxes of Orden were also parts of the dance with death. In a way that made sense. Zedd had once told him that the power of Orden was the power of life itself. The dance with death was really about preserving life, and Orden itself was centered around life and preserving it from the rampages of the Chainfire spell. Richard dunked his finger back in the red paint and laid down an arcing line across Johnrock's forehead, then supported it with lines that created a symbol for centering strength. He was using elements he understood, but combining them in new ways to alter them. He didn't want a Sister to see the drawings and recognize their direct meaning. While the designs he was painting were composed of elements he knew, they were original. The men who had gathered all around leaned in a little, spellbound by not just the process, but by the drawing itself. It had a kind of poetry to it. While they didn't understand the meaning of the lines, they experienced the totality of them as expressive of meaningful file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (133 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 purpose, as important, and as exactly what they were: threatening. \"You know what this whole thing, this drawing, reminds me of?\" one of the men asked. \"What?\" Richard murmured as he added more to the emblem that stood for a powerful strike meant to break an opponent's strength. \"In a way it reminds me of the play of the game. I don't know why, but the lines kind of look like the movements of certain attacks in Ja'La.\" Surprised that the man-another captive-could pick up such a significant trait from the drawing, Richard shot the man a questioning frown. \"When I was a farrier,\" the man explained, \"I had to understand horses if I was to shoe them. You can't ask a horse what's bothering him, but if you pay attention you can learn to pick up on things, like the way the horse moves, and after a time you start to understand the meaning behind certain body language. If you pay attention to those little movements you can avoid getting kicked, or bitten.\" \"That's very good,\" Richard said. \"That's something like what I'm doing. I'm going to give each of you a kind of visual picture of power.\" \"And how would you know so much about drawing symbols of power?\" one of the men, Bruce, asked in a suspicious tone.

My intention is to draw on each man what I think makes them look more powerful, that's all.\" Bruce didn't look satisfied by the answer. He gestured at Johnrock's face. \"What makes you think all them squiggly lines and such look like visions of power?\" \"Well, I don't know,\" Richard said, trying to come up with something to make the man stop asking questions without having to actually reveal anything important, \"the form of the lines just seem powerful to me.\" \"That's nonsense,\" Bruce said. \"Drawings don't mean anything.\" Some of the soldiers on the team watched Bruce and waited for Richard's answer as if considering a rebellion against their point man. Richard smiled. \"If you think so, Bruce, if you're convinced that drawings don't mean anything, then how about if I paint a flower on your forehead.\" All the men laughed-even the soldiers. Bruce, suddenly looking a little less sure of himself as his gaze darted around at his chuckling teammates, cleared his throat. \"I guess, now that you put it that way, I can see some of what you mean.

When you hear them laughing at you, let that laughter make you angry. Let it fill your hearts with the desire to jam that laughter right back down their throats. \"In that very first moment when we step onto the field, the other team, as well as many of those watching, will probably not just laugh, but call us names. Let them. We want that. Let them underestimate us. When they do that, when they laugh at you or call you names, I want you to save up the anger you're feeling. Fill your hearts with it.\" Richard met the eyes of each man in turn. \"Keep in mind that we are here to be victorious in the tournaments. We are here to win the chance to play the emperor's team. We alone are worthy of that chance. Those men who are laughing at you are the worthless dregs of Ja'La players. We must sweep them aside so that we can get at the emperor's team. The men in the first games are in our way. They are in our way and they are laughing at us. \"When you step onto the field of play let their laughter ring in your ears. Soak it in, but keep silent.

We can't be satisfied with that kind of piddling victory. We must be unyielding. We must overwhelm them. We must hammer them into the ground. \"We must beat them by at least ten points.\" The men's jaws dropped. Eyebrows went up. Such lopsided victories happened only in children's mismatched games. A Ja'La team on this level winning by more than four or five points was virtually unheard of. \"Every member of the losing team gets a lash of the whip for each point they lose by,\" Richard said. \"I want that bloody whipping to be on every tongue of every other team in this camp. \"From that moment on, no one will laugh.

You crushed any city that stood against you so that those yet to be conquered trembled in fear as they waited for you to come. Those people knew your reputation and they greatly feared your arrival. Their fear allowed you to more easily conquer them.\" The soldiers grinned. They could now put Richard's plan in a frame of reference that they understood. \"We want to make all the other teams afraid of the team with the red, painted faces.\" Richard fisted his free hand. \"Then, we will crush each of them in turn.\" In the sudden silence, the men all made fists to match his and thumped them to their chests in oaths that they would make it so. These men all wanted to win, each for his own reason. None of those reasons was anything like Richard's reason. He hoped not to ever have to play the emperor's team-he hoped to get his chance long before then-but he had to be prepared to go that far, if necessary. He knew that a good chance might not come along before then. Should it not, he had to insure that they reached the final game of the tournament, when he was more confident of getting the chance he would need. Richard finally turned back to Johnrock and in short order completed the drawing with a few emblems that symbolized massive weight behind an attack, drawing them down each of Johnrock's heavily muscled arms. \"Do me next, will you, Ruben?\" one of the men asked. \"Then me,\" another called out. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (138 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"One at a time,\" Richard said. \"Now, as I'm working, we need to go over our strategy.

I want for us to be ready to rush the opponent from the first instant. I want to knock the wind out of them while they're still laughing.\" Each man in turn sat on the overturned bucket and let Richard paint his face. Richard approached each man as if the drawing was a matter of life and death. In a way it was. The men had all been pulled in by Richard's sober lecture. A solemn mood settled over them as they sat silently watching their point man draw what only Richard knew were some of the most deadly concepts he knew how to create. Even if they didn't understand the language behind those symbols, they understood the meaning behind what Richard was doing. They could see that each man looked fearsome. As each man was completed, Richard realized that it was like looking at a nearly complete collection of the designs that made up the dance with death, with elements of the boxes of Orden thrown in for good measure. The only symbols he'd left out were the ones he was saving for himself, the elements of the dance that invoked the most deadly of cuts-the ones that cut into the enemy's very soul.

The men all watched in rapt attention. This was their leader in battle, the one they followed in Ja'La dh Jin. This was his new face and they were all serious about learning it. As a final element, Richard added the lightning bolts of the Con Dar, the symbols representing a power Kahlan had invoked when the two of them had been trying to stop Darken Rahl from opening the boxes of Or-den and she thought that Richard had been killed. It was a power meant for vengeance. Thinking about Kahlan, her memory lost, her identity taken from her, being at the mercy of Jagang and the evil beliefs of the Order, as well as picturing her in his mind with that lurid bruise on her face, made his blood boil with rage. Con Dar meant \"Blood Rage.\" CHAPTER 10 Kahlan kept an arm protectively around Jillian as they followed closely behind Jagang. The emperor's entourage made its way through the sprawling encampment to the silent awe of some, and the cheers of many. Some chanted Jagang's name as he passed, shouting encouragement for his leadership in their fight to exterminate opposition to the Imperial Order, while many more lauded him as \"Jagang the Just.\" It never failed to dishearten her that so many could view him-or the Fellowship of Order itself-as custodians of justice.

Kahlan felt somewhat ashamed of her pretense of protection when she knew that in reality she could offer little safety to the girl. Worse, Kahlan might very well end up being the cause of any harm that came to Jillian. No. She reminded herself that she would not be the cause of such harm, should it come to pass. Jagang, as advocate for the corrupt beliefs of the Fellowship of Order and the champion of unjust justice, would be the cause. The twisted beliefs of the Order justified, in their minds, any injustice in aid to their ends. Kahlan was not responsible-in part or in whole-for evil committed by others. They were answerable for their own actions. She told herself that she mustn't allow herself to shift blame from the guilty to the victim. One of the hallmarks of the people plying evil beliefs was to always blame the victim. That was their game and she would not allow herself to play it. Still, it broke Kahlan's heart that Jillian was once more a terrified captive of these brutes. These people from the Old World who would harm innocent people in the name of a greater good were traitors to the very concept of good. They were not capable of sincere feelings of heartache because they did not value good; they resented it. Rather than seeking values, it was a kind of corrosive envy that guided their actions. Kahlan's only real satisfaction since being captured by Jagang had been that she had managed to engineer an escape for Jillian. Now even that was lost. As they marched through the camp, Jillian's arm tightly circled Kahlan's waist, her fingers clutched at Kahlan's shirt. It was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (141 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 obvious that while the sinister nature of the soldiers all around them frightened her, she was more terrified of Jagang's personal guards. It had been men like these who had hunted her down. She had managed to evade them for quite a while but, despite how well she knew the deserted ruins of the ancient city of Caska, she was still a child and no match for a search carried out by such determined and experienced men. Now that Jillian was a prisoner in the sprawling encampment, Kahlan knew that she had little chance of again helping the girl escape the clutches of the Order's men. As they walked through the mud and refuse, weaving around the disorder of tents, wagons, and piles of gear and supplies, Kahlan turned Jillian's face up and saw that at least the cut had stopped bleeding. One of the collection of plundered rings that Jagang wore had been responsible for the jagged gash over the bone of Jillian's cheek. If only that were her biggest worry. Kahlan smoothed her hand over the girl's head in response to a brave smile. Jagang had momentarily been quite pleased to have back a girl who had dared escape from him-and to have yet another means to torment and control Kahlan-but he had been more interested in learning all he could about the discovery down in the pit. It seemed to Kahlan that he knew something more about whatever it was that was buried than he was revealing. For one thing, he had not been as surprised by the find as she would have expected. He seemed to take the discovery in stride.

Once he was satisfied that everyone understood exactly how he wanted the discovery handled, and that everyone there was working diligently toward those ends, his attention had quickly turned to seeing a bit of the opening games of the tournaments. He was eager to appraise some of the eventual competition to his own team. Kahlan had been forced to go with him to Ja'La games before. She wasn't looking forward to going again, primarily because the excitement and violence of the games put him in a stormy mood laced with savage carnal desires. Ordinarily the man was terrifying enough, capable of instantaneous and brutal violence, but when he was in an agitated, aroused mood after a day at Ja'La games he was altogether more intractable and willful. After the first time they'd gone to watch games the focus of his depraved lust had been Kahlan. She had fought her panic, finally coming to accept that he was going to do what he was going to do and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She had finally gone numb to the terror of being under him, resigning herself to the inevitable. She had turned her eyes away from his lecherous gaze and freed her mind go to another place, telling herself that she would save her hot rage until the time was right, until a time when it would serve some purpose. But then he'd stopped short. \"I want you to know who you are when I do this,\" he had told her. \"I want you to know what I mean to you when I do this.

That alone spoke volumes about the man's craving for revenge, and about how much she had engendered his lust for it. Patience was a quality that made Jagang all the more dangerous. He could easily be impulsive, but it was a mistake to think that he could be lured into becoming reckless. Feeling the need to make her understand his greater purpose, Jagang had explained that it was much the same as the way he punished people who angered him. If he killed such people, he'd pointed out, they would be dead and unable to suffer, but if he made them endure agonizing pain then they would wish for death and he could deny it. Witnessing their endless torment, he could be sure of their great regret for their crimes, of their insufferable grief for all that was lost to them. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (144 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 That, he'd told her, was what he had in store for her: the torture of regret and utter loss.

Kahlan hoped that Jillian was too young for his tastes. She wouldn't be, Kahlan knew, if she were to do anything to give him cause. As they moved through crowds of soldiers cheering for a game already under way, the royal guards forcefully shoved any men out of the way they judged to be too close to the emperor. Several men who didn't move willingly enough, or quickly enough, got an elbow that nearly cracked their skulls. One burly drunk in a sour disposition, who didn't intend on being shoved aside for anyone, even an emperor, turned on the advancing royal guards. As the soldier stood his ground, growling bold threats, he was eviscerated with one swift scything cut from a curved knife. The incident didn't slow the royal party a single step. Kahlan shielded Jillian's eyes from the sight of the man's insides spilled in their path. Since it had stopped raining, Kahlan pushed the hood of her cloak back off her head.

When she realized that she was stretching in order to see the game, she immediately lowered herself back down. The last thing she wanted was for Jagang to ask her why she was suddenly so interested in Ja'La. She wasn't really interested in the game, but she was interested in seeing if she could spot the man with the gray eyes, the man who had deliberately tripped and fallen in the mud so as to hide his face from Jagang-or maybe Sister Ulicia. If the rain didn't return, it was soon going to be hard for the man to maintain a muddy face to hide his identity. Even with rain and mud Jagang would quickly become suspicious if the point man for Commander Karg's team walked around all the time with a muddy face. Then the man would find that the mud, rather than hiding him, only attracted Jagang's suspicion. Kahlan fretted about what would happen then. Many of the men watching the game cheered and shouted encouragement when the point man for one of the teams made it into the opposing team's territory. Blockers rushed in to prevent the man from gaining any more ground. The onlookers roared as the players toppled one another while other men scrambled to protect their territory. Ja'La was a game in which men ran, dodged, and darted past one another, or blocked, or chased the man with the broc-a heavy, leather-covered ball a little smaller than a man's head-trying to capture it, or attack with it, or score with it.

Rolling across the ground without shirts, many were soon left slick not just with sweat, but with blood. The square Ja'La fields were marked out in a grid. In each corner was a goal, two for each team. The only man who could score, and only when it was his team's timed turn, was the point man, and even then he had to do so from within a specific section of the grid on the opponents' side of the field. From that scoring zone, an area running across the width of the field, he could throw the broc toward either of the rivals' goal nets. It wasn't easy to score. It was a throw of some distance and the goal nets weren't large. To make it all the more difficult, the opposing players could block the throw of the heavy broc. They could also knock the point man back out of the shooting zone-or even tackle him-as he tried to score. The broc could also be used as a kind of weapon to knock interfering players out of the way. The point man's team could try to clear the opposing players from in front of a goal net, or they could protect him from blockers so that he could try to find an opening in one net or the other so that he could make a shot, or they could split up and try to do both. Each strategy for each side had its advantages and disadvantages. There was also a line far back from the regular shooting zone from where the point man could attempt a throw. If such a shot went in, his team scored two points rather than the usual single point, but shots were rarely wasted at such a distance because the chance for interception was so much greater, while at the same time the chance of making such the shot was negligible. Such attempts were file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (147 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 usually made only out of desperation, such as a last-ditch effort by the team that was behind, trying to score before time ran out. If the opposing team tackled the point man, then, and only then, were his wing men allowed to recover the broc and attempt to score. If any attempt to score missed the net and the broc went out of bounds, then the team on offense got the broc back, but it was returned to them on their own side of the field. From there they had to start the running attack all over again. All the while their timed turn with the broc continued to run down. On a few squares on the field the attacking point man was safe from the threat of being tackled and having the broc stripped away from him. Those squares, though, could easily become dangerous islands where he could become trapped and unable to advance. He could, though, pass the broc to a wing man and once on the charge get it back again. On the rest of the squares, and in the regular scoring zone, the defending team could capture or steal the broc in an attempt to prevent the attacking team from scoring. If the defending team captured the broc, though, they couldn't score with it until their turn of the hourglass, their turn at attack, but they could try to keep possession in order to deny the team whose turn it was a chance to score. The attacking team had to get it back if they were to score. Fights over possession of the broc could get bloody. An hourglass timed each team's turn of play-each side's timed chance to score. If an hourglass wasn't available, other timing means, such as a bucket of water with a hole in it, could be used.

It often seem to Kahlan that there were no rules-other than the major rule that a team could score only during their timed turn. The timed-play rule prevented any one team from dominating the possession of the broc and kept the game moving. It was a fast- paced, exhausting game, with constant back-and-forth play and no real time to rest. Because it was so difficult to make a point, teams rarely scored more than three or four points in a game. At this level of play the concluding gap in the final score was usually only a point or two. A prescribed number of turns of the hourglass for each side made up the official time of the game, but if the score was even at the end of those turns then play continued, no matter how many more turns of the hourglass were needed, until one team scored another point. When that finally happened the other team then had but one turn of the hourglass to try to match the point. If they failed, the game was over. If they made the point, the other team got another turn. The extended play went on in that fashion until a team scored without an answering point within the one-following-play rule. For that reason, no Ja'La dh Jin game could ever end in a tie. There was always a winner, always a loser. With or without tie-breaking play, when the game was over the losing team was brought out onto the field and each man was flogged. A terrible whip made up of a bundle of knotted leather cords bound together at the handle end was used to mete out the punishment. Each of those leather cords was tipped with heavy nuggets of metal.

The crowd enthusiastically counted out each lash to each man on the losing team kneeling in the center of the field. The winners often cavorted around the perimeter of the field, showing off for the crowd, while the losers, with bowed heads, received their whipping. With such bitter rivalry between teams the flogging always ended up being a grim sight. The players, after all, had been selected specifically for their belligerent brutality, not merely their skill at playing. The crowds who watched the Ja'La games expected bloody matches. The female camp followers watching from the sidelines weren't in the least bit put off by the blood. If anything, it made them all the more eager to catch the attention of favorite players. To the people of the Old World, blood and sex were inextricably linked-whether it was a Ja'La match, or the sacking of a city. If there wasn't much blood during the game the crowd could get riled, believing that the teams weren't really trying hard enough. Kahlan once saw Jagang order the execution of a team because he thought they hadn't fought hard enough. The teams who had played on the bloody field after the executions had thrown themselves into the match. The more brutal the players were-from the crowd's standpoint-the better. Legs and arms were frequently broken, as were skulls. Those who had previously killed an opponent in a Ja\"La match were well known and widely acclaimed. Such men were idolized and entered the field at the beginning of games to the wild cheers of the spectators.

To the Imperial Order, the Game of Life was a blood sport. Kahlan moved up close behind Jagang as he stood near the edge of the field at midpoint. The game had already gotten under way while they had still been back at the construction site. The royal guards flanked Jagang's sides and guarded his back. Kahlan's own special guards surrounded her close enough to be sure she didn't try to wander away. She suspected that the heated emotions of the fans, as well as their drinking, held the potential for more than a little trouble. Still, Jagang, despite the show of force by his guards, was a man who did not fear trouble. He had won rule by brute force; he held on to it by being absolutely ruthless. There were few, even among the largest of his guard, who were his equal in sheer brawn, to say nothing of his skill and experience as a warrior. Kahlan suspected that he could easily crush a man's skull in one bare hand. On top of that, the man was a dream walker. He could probably have strolled alone among the meanest of drunken soldiers and had nothing to fear. Out on the field the teams came together in a great crash of bone and muscle. Kahlan watched the point man as he lost the broc when hit from both sides at once. On one knee, he held a hand over his ribs as he panted, trying to catch his breath. He wasn't the man she was looking for. The horn blew, signifying the end of that turn of play. The fans of the other team cheered wildly at the failure to score.

Kahlan let out a silent sigh. That wasn't him, either. As the hourglass was turned over the horn blew again. The point man and his team started their run downfield. The opposing team started their run to defend their goals. The crash of flesh was horrific. One of the players screamed in pain. Jil-lian, behind the wall of guards and unable to see much of what was happening on the field, still shrank from the sound of the screams. She pressed herself all the harder against Kahlan. Play continued even as the fallen player was dragged from the field by the referee's assistants. Jagang, having seen enough, turned and started off toward the next Ja'La field. The men in the crowd, all pushing and shoving as they tried to see the game, parted for the emperor leaving their game. The crowd was huge, even though in such a camp it constituted only a small fraction of the men. The construction of the ramp continued despite the games. Most of the men working on it would have plenty of time, once their shift was over, to see other games that were to go on throughout the day and evening. From what Kahlan could gather from bits of conversation, there were a lot of teams contending for the right to eventually play the emperor's team. The tournaments constituted a welcome diversion for men with nothing to do but endure endless days of working and the interminable siege of the People's Palace. It was a long trek through the cheering, shouting, booing men watching the game the emperor was leaving behind.

An area had been roped off for the emperor and his party of guards. Jagang and a number of officers who had joined him talked at length about the teams who were about to play. Apparently, the game they'd left was between lesser- ranked teams. This game, though, was supposed to be between men who were for some reason expected to offer a better show. The two point men were just arriving at center field to draw straws to determine which team would get the chance at first play. A hush fell over the crowd as they waited. The point men both drew a straw from a bunch the referee held out in his fist. The two men held up their straws. The man with the short straw cursed. The winning point man held the straw high as he cried out in triumph. His fellow players and the crowd favoring his team sent up a thunderous cheer. The long straw give him the choice of taking the broc on the first play or giving it to the man who had pulled the short straw. Of course, no team ever gave up their chance to be first to score a point. Scoring first augured well for their prospect of victory. From what Kahlan overheard from the soldiers and guards around her, it was believed by most that the Game of Life was won or lost by that very first draw of a straw. That straw, they believed, revealed what fate had in store. Neither point man was the one Kahlan was looking for. As the game started, it became obvious that these men were better than those playing in the last game. The tackles were wild efforts. Men threw themselves through the air in desperate attempts to make contact-either to take out the point man or to protect him. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (153 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The point man, besides running with the broc, used its weight to help knock a man out of his way. As another man closed on him, he heaved the broc with all his might at close range. The blocker grunted with the weight of the impact of the broc and fell. The fans rooted and hooted. One of the wing men scooped up the broc and tossed it to the point man as they charged across the field. \"I'm sorry,\" Jillian whispered up to Kahlan while the guards, officers, and Jagang all watched the game, some of them commenting on the players. \"It wasn't your fault, Jillian. You did your best.\" \"But you did so much. I wish I was as good as you and then-\" \"Shush, now. I'm a captive, too. We both are no match for these men.\" Jillian smiled just a little, then. \"I'm at least glad to be with you.\" Kahlan returned the smile in kind. She glanced at her guards. They were caught up in watching the excitement of the game. \"I'll try to think of a way to get us out of this,\" she whispered. From time to time Jillian peeked out between the big men to try to see what was happening on the field. When Kahlan noticed Jillian rubbing her bare arms and that she was beginning to shiver in the cold, she wrapped her cloak protectively around the girl, sharing her warmth with her. As time wore on, each team scored a point.

The point man of one team was tackled low from behind while at the same time another blocker, in a coordinated attack, flew in from the front, hitting him square in the chest with a lowered shoulder. The point man went limp and hit the ground hard. The tackle looked like it might very well have broken the man's back. The crowd went wild. Kahlan turned Jillian's face away and pressed it in against her instead. \"Don't watch.\" Jillian, on the edge of tears, nodded. \"I don't know why they like such cruel games.\" \"Because they are cruel people,\" Kahlan murmured. Another man was designated point man as their fallen leader was carried away to a deafening roar of satisfaction on the one side, and angry yells on the other. The two sides of onlookers seemed on the verge of combat, but when play swiftly resumed they were quickly caught up in the fast-paced action. The team who had lost the point man fought desperately, but it soon became apparent that they were fighting a losing battle. The new point man was not the equal of the man they'd lost. When the last regular play of the hourglass was finished they had lost by two points-a resounding victory for the other team. Such a point spread, as well as eliminating the opposing point man in such savage fashion, would add greatly to the winning team's reputation.

The guards, intoxicated with the murderous ferocity of the play, whispered among themselves, going over what they had liked best about some of the more violent clashes. The crowd, already worked up by the game, was excited all the more by the ensuing whippings. They were fired up, eagerly anticipating the next game. As they waited, they began a rhythmic chant, impatiently urging the next teams out. They clapped their hands in time to their monotone cries for action. One of the teams emerged from the crowd at the far end of the field on the right. By the way they cheered, the crowd recognized a favored team. Each player raised a fist over his head as they strutted in a circle around the field, showing off for their fans. Men in the crowd, as well as the women camp followers, cheered the team they knew and supported. One of Jagang's guards standing not far in front of Kahlan commented to the man next to him that this team was more than merely good, and he expected that they would badly maul their foe. By the hooting of the crowd, most onlookers seemed to be of the same mind. Apparently, this was a popular team with the kind of hostile reputation the men of Imperial Order liked and remembered. After the previous game, the mob of soldiers was aroused and eager for blood. The vast crush of soldiers all stretched, craning their necks to see the other team as they finally made their way out through the crowd on the left.

No one cheered. They were too astonished to cheer. CHAPTER 11 The men, all without shirts, marched in single file out from the middle of a thick knot of grim guards, all with arrows at the ready. Each man in the column making his way toward the center of the field was painted with strange red symbols. The lines, whorls, circles, and arcs covered their faces, chests, shoulders, and arms. They looked like they had been marked in blood by the Keeper of the underworld himself. Kahlan noticed that the man at the lead had designs drawn on him that, while similar, were slightly different. In addition, he alone had twin lightning bolts on his face. Starting from the temple on each side, in a mirror image of each other, the top part of each bolt zigzagged over the eyebrow, the center lobe of each lightning bolt passing over the eyelid, with the bottom of the zigzag slashing over the cheekbones, finally terminating in a point at the hollow of each cheek. Kahlan found the effect viscerally frightening. Glaring out from the raptor gaze at the center of those twin lightning bolts were penetrating gray eyes. It was hard to make out what the man looked like beneath the distraction of lines. The strange symbols, and especially the lightning bolts, confused the features beneath.

She didn't let so much as a smile slip onto her features. While relieved, at the same time she wished that she could see his face, really see it, see what he looked like. He was not as big as some of the other hulking players, but he was still a big man-tall and muscular, but not muscled the way some of the thick, heavy, bull-like men were muscled. This man was built in a way that was all the right proportions. As she stared at him, Kahlan suddenly feared that everyone might see her transfixed by the man. She could feel her face flushing. Still, she stared. She couldn't seem to help herself. This was the first time she'd really gotten a good look at the man. He looked exactly the way she somehow knew he would. Or maybe it was that he looked just the way she dreamed he would. The cold first day of winter suddenly felt warm to her. She wondered who this man was to her. She made herself rein in her imagination. She dared not daydream about things that she knew could never be. While the other point man laughed, the man with the gray eyes waited before the referee, his cutting gaze fixed on his counterpart. She had known the instant she'd seen the painted designs that it would be viewed by these soldiers as empty bravado. The painted designs were the sort of visual statement that, if not backed up by a man of the right nature, would in such circumstances be the worst kind of presumption, the kind of provocation that would bring him brutal, if not lethal, treatment.

He was putting himself and his team at great risk by making such a proclamation in paint. It almost seemed that the lightning bolts were meant to insure that no one could miss that he was the point man, as if he meant to direct the other team's focus and attention to him. She couldn't imagine why he would do such a thing. Following their point man's lead, the team that wasn't painted had all started laughing. The crowd, too, had joined in, laughing, hooting, and calling the painted men, and in particular the point man with the lightning bolts, names. Kahlan knew without a doubt that there was no more dangerous mistake to be made than to laugh at this man. The painted team stood as still as stone, waiting while the crowd went into a riot of laughter and mockery. The other team shouted insults and taunts. Some of the women camp followers threw small things-chicken bones, rotten food, and even dirt when nothing else could be found. The players on the other team called the man with lightning bolts the kind of names that caused Kahlan to absently cover Jillian's ear with a hand, pressing her head to Kahlan's chest. She wrapped her cloak around Jillian. She didn't know what was going to happen, but she knew for sure that this game was not going to be a place for a girl. The point man with the twin lightning bolts stood with an expressionless look that showed nothing of what he might be feeling.

And yet, in this man's calm demeanor Kahlan saw coiled fury. He never looked her way-his gaze was fixed on his counterpart-but just seeing him standing there, seeing all of him, seeing his face, even though it was covered in painted lines, seeing the way he held himself, seeing him at length without having to quickly look away . . . made Kahlan's knees weak. Commander Karg nudged his way in through the wall of guards to join Emperor Jagang at the side of the field. He folded his muscled arms, apparently not at all concerned about the uproar his team was causing. Kahlan noticed that Jagang was not laughing along with everyone else. He didn't even smile. The commander and the emperor tipped their heads close together and spoke in words Kahlan couldn't hear over the jeering, laughing, and vulgar insults being shouted by the crowd. As Jagang and Commander Karg spoke at length, the other team took to dancing around the field, arms raised, the recipients of the mob's esteem even though they had yet to score a point. They had become heroes without having done anything. These soldiers, devoted to dogmatic beliefs, were motivated by hate. They saw any individual's quiet confidence as arrogance, his competence as unjust, and such inequity as oppression. Kahlan recalled Jagang's words: \"The Fellowship of Order teaches us that to be better than someone is to be worse than everyone.\" The men watching believed in that creed and so they hated men for appearing to proclaim with paint that they were better.

It was unavoidable that beliefs as irrational as those taught by the Fellowship of Order would produce endless tangles of contradictions, desires, and emotions. Shortcomings made evident by even the most basic common sense were plastered over with a liberal application of faith. Anyone who questioned matters of faith was held to be a sinner. These men were here in the New World to eliminate sinners. Order was finally restored by the referee calling for the crowd to settle down so that the game could start. As the spectators quieted, to a degree at least, the man with the gray eyes gestured to the referee's fistful of straws, inviting his opponent to draw first. The man drew a straw, smiling at his choice when it came out looking like it surely had to be a winning length. The man with the gray eyes drew a straw that was longer. As the crowd hooted their disapproval, the referee gave the broc to the point man with the painted face. Instead of going to his side of the field to start his charge, he waited a moment until the crowd quieted a little and then graciously handed the broc to the other point man, forfeiting the first turn at an attempt to score. The crowd erupted in wild laughter at such an unexpected turn of events. They clearly thought the painted point man was a fool who had just handed victory to the other team. They cheered as if their team had just been victorious. None of the painted team showed any reaction to what their point man had just done.

When the hourglass was turned over and the horn blew, the attacking team wasted no time. Eager to score quickly, their charge was instantaneous. They all yelled battle cries as they rushed across the field. The painted team raced toward the center of the field to meet the charge. The roar from the crowd was deafening. Kahlan's muscles tensed in anticipation of a terrible collision of flesh and bone. It didn't happen the way she expected. The painted team-the red team as the guards had already taken to calling them-deviated in their direction of charge, splitting in two and pouring to either side around the advance blockers, going instead for the rear guard. Such an unexpected and amateurish mistake was^a stroke of luck for the team trying to score. Following his blockers and wing men, the point man with the broc went through the gap the red team had left open, racing straight up the field. In an instant both wings of the red team pivoted and the opening snapped closed like great jaws, tumbling the charging blockers inward. The painted point man charged right up the middle-toward the center blockers coining for him. Just as they were about to tackle him, he sidestepped one man and whirled around, slipping between two others. Kahlan blinked in disbelief at what she had just seen. It looked as if he had squirted like a melon seed right through half a dozen men file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (162 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 converging on him. One of the bigger men on the red team, likely one of the wing men, went for the charging point man with the broc. Just before reaching him, though, he dove at him too soon, so that his diving block was too low. The man with the broc jumped right over him. The crowd cheered at how deftly their man had just evaded a tackle. But the man with the twin lightning bolts also made a flying leap over his downed wing man, using his back like a step to launch himself. He met the other point man in midflight, hooking him with an arm and upending him in midair. The reversal of direction was forceful enough to dislodge the broc. As he came crashing to the ground the man with the gray eyes caught the loose broc while it was still in the air. His foot came down on the back of the fallen point man's head, driving his face into the mud. Kahlan knew without a doubt that he could have easily broken the man's neck, but he had deliberately avoided doing so. Blockers from every direction dove for the painted man who now had their broc. He pivoted, changing direction. They landed where he had been but he was already gone. They crashed down instead atop their own point man. The red team now had possession of the broc. Even though they couldn't score until it was their turn, they could keep the other team from scoring. For some reason, though, the man with the gray eyes charged across the field, flanked by his two wing men and half his blockers. They were formed into a perfect wedge as they crossed the field.

He followed the broc, recovered it from the net, and then, rather than keeping possession in an effort to deny the other team an opportunity to score, he trotted back up the field and with an easy underarm throw tossed the broc back to the point man still on his knees spitting out mud. The crowd gasped in confused astonishment. What Kahlan had just seen confirmed what she had believed from the first moment she'd looked into the man's raptor gaze-this was the most dangerous man alive. More dangerous than Jagang, dangerous in a different way, but more dangerous than Jagang. More dangerous than anyone. This was a man too dangerous to be allowed to live. Once Jagang realized what she already knew-if he didn't already know it-he might very well decide to have this man put to death. The team with first turn took the broc back to their starting point on the right and, in a fury to redeem themselves and score a point that would count, charged across the field. Surprisingly, the red team waited rather than running to stop the advance as far away from their goal as possible. A mistake, it would seem, but Kahlan didn't think so. When the attackers reached the red team they threw themselves into the defenders. The red team abruptly bolted in every direction, evading the overconfident blockers. As they ran, the red team came around and their own blockers formed into a crescent formation. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (164 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 As they raced across the field they scythed down the opposing wing men and blockers, as well as the point man. The big painted wing man stripped the broc from him, then tossed it as high as he could into the air. The man with the lightning bolts, who had already dodged, darted, and threaded his way through the line of charging men, came through at a dead run and caught the broc before it hit the ground. By himself he had outrun all the men of the other team chasing him. When he reached the opposite end of the field he heaved the broc into the net in the corner opposite to the one he'd thrown it into the first time. The blockers dove for him but he effortlessly sidestepped and they crashed to the ground in a heap beside him. He trotted to the net and retrieved the broc. \"Who is that man?\" Jagang asked in a low voice. Kahlan knew that Jagang meant the point man with the lightning bolts painted on his face, the man with the gray eyes. \"His name is Ruben,\" Commander Karg said. It was a lie. Kahlan knew that wasn't the man's name. She didn't have any idea what his name really was, but it was not Ruben. Ruben was a disguise, just like the mud had been, just like the red paint was now. Ruben was not his real name. She suddenly wondered what made her think such a thing. She knew from the way he'd looked at her that first time their eyes had met the day before that he knew her.

The name just didn't fit him. The horn blew, marking the end of the first play. The hourglass was turned over and the horn blew again. The red team was already down at their end of the field, back beyond their starting point. They didn't bother to give themselves the advantage of getting up to the sections of the grid where they were allowed to start their attack. Instead, the man Commander Karg had said was named Ruben, already in possession of the broc, gave a slight hand signal to his men. Kahlan's brow twitched as she watched carefully. She had never seen a point man use such hand signals. Men playing Ja'La usually seemed to function as a loosely coordinated mob, carrying out the designated job of their position- blockers, or wing men, or guards, as seemed fitting to each man in each circumstance that came up. The prevailing wisdom was that only if each man acted as he saw fit could the team expect to deal with the unexpected variations that came about during play. They were, in a way, each reacting to what fate dealt them. Ruben's team was different. At the completion of the signal, they pivoted and in a coordinated fashion charged ahead of him in formation. They were not acting as a loosely coordinated mob; they were behaving like a well-disciplined army going into a battle. The men of the other team, by now enraged, each man driven by the desire for revenge, rushed to intercept the team with the broc. Crossing midfield, the red team turned as one, going for the net to their right.

Their blockers knew that their job was to block, and they meant to stop the advancing red team before they could reach the scoring zone. But Ruben didn't follow his men. He broke left at the last moment. All by himself, without even his wing men for protection, he alone went diagonally the other way across the field, heading for the net to the left. The bulk of the two teams collided in a great heap, some of the defenders not even aware that the man they were after wasn't under the pile. Only one guard had been lagging back, saw what Ruben was doing, and was able to turn in time to block. Ruben lowered a shoulder and caught the guard square in the chest, knocking the wind from him and sending him sprawling. Without pause as he reached the scoring area of the field, Ruben heaved the broc into the net. The red team sprinted back to their side of the field, forming up for a second attack while they still had time left. As they waited for the referee trotting with the broc across the field, they all looked to their panting leader for his hand signal. It was quick and simple, a sign that, to Kahlan, didn't look like it meant anything. When the referee tossed Ruben the broc he immediately broke into a dead run. His team was ready and sprang out ahead to fan out in a short, tight line before him. When the angry, disorderly cluster of men of the other team were almost upon them, the red team pivoted left, scooping up the blocking charge, deflecting its momentum left.

Before any of the blockers could reach him, he yelled with the effort of heaving the broc from way behind the regular scoring zone. It was exceedingly difficult to make a shot from that far back. Thrown from there, a shot that went in was worth two points rather than one. The broc arced through the air over the heads of net guards jumping wildly for it. Confused by the strange single-line charge, they hadn't expected such a long-shot attempt to score and hadn't been ready for it. The broc just made it into the net. The horn blew, signifying the end of the red team's scoring period. The crowd stood stunned, mouths hanging agape. In their first turn at play, the red team had scored three points-not to mention the two points Ruben had made that didn't count. A hush fell over the field as the other team huddled in a confidential discussion of what to do about the sudden turn of events. Their point man made what appeared to be an angry proposal. All his men, grinning at what he suggested, nodded and then broke up to begin their turn with the broc. Seeing that they had obviously cooked up a plan^the crowd again started cheering encouragement. Over the cheers, the point man growled orders to his men. Two of his guards nodded at words Kahlan couldn't hear. At his yell, they charged across the field, gathering into a tight knot of muscle and fury. Rather than going for the scoring zone, the point man abruptly hooked right, leading the charge oddly off course. Ruben and his defenders shifted to meet the charge but file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (168 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 weren't able to bring their full weight to bear in time. It was a brutal impact. The strike had deliberately targeted Ruben's left wing man to the exclusion of all the other men, abandoning even the show of an attempt to score in favor of doing damage to one man in order to harm the red team's ability to play effectively. As the crowd cheered in anticipation of first blood, the pile of men got up one at a time. Players painted red yanked their opponents back out of the way, trying to reach the men at the bottom of the heap. The left wing man for the red team was the only man who did not get up. As the team with the broc ran back to form up another charge, Ruben knelt beside the downed man, checking on him. It was obvious by his lack of urgency that there was nothing to be done. His left wing man was dead. The crowd cheered as the fallen player was dragged away, leaving a thick trail of blood across the field. Ruben's raptor gaze swept the sidelines. Kahlan recognized the appraisal. She could almost feel what he was thinking because she had also appraised opposition and weighed odds. The guards with arrows put tension to their bows as Ruben rose up. \"What's going on?\" Jillian whispered as she peeked out from under Kahlan's cloak. \"I can't see past all of Jagang's guards.\" \"A man was hurt,\" Kahlan said. \"Just stay warm, there's nothing worth seeing.\" Jillian nodded and remained huddled under Kahlan's protective arm and the warmth of her cloak. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (169 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The play of Ja'La was not halted for anything, even a death on the field. Kahlan felt great sadness that the death of a man was all part of the game, and cheered by the spectators. The men with bows stationed around the field, watching over the captives who played on the red team, all seemed to be pointing their nocked arrows toward one man. She and the man with the lightning bolts painted on his face had something in common: they each had their own special guards. As the crowd chanted for play, Kahlan felt an odd, tense, foreboding in the air. The broc was returned to the team with time left in their turn at play. As they formed up, she knew that the moment had passed. Kahlan saw a grim Ruben give his men a stealthy signal. Each of his men returned a slight nod. Then, just enough for them to catch his meaning, Ruben stealthily showed them three fingers. The men immediately assembled up into an odd formation. They waited briefly as the other team started across the field at a dead run, yelling battle cries inspired by their brutal accomplishment. They believed they now had a tactical advantage that gave them the upper hand. They were confident that they could now dictate the course of the game. As the team with the broc charged across the field, the red team broke into three separate wedges. Ruben led the smaller center wedge, heading for the point man with the broc. His two wing men- his big right wing man and the newly designated left wing man-led the majority of the blockers in the two side wedges.

The strange defensive tactic drew scorn from Jagang's guards. From the comments Kahlan could hear they were convinced that the red team, by splitting up into three groups, would not have the weight of enough blockers left in the center to stop the point man with the broc, much less handle all the men coming at them. The guards thought that such an ineffective defense would give the aggressors an easy score and probably cost the life of another member of the red team in the center group-very possibly the point man himself, since he was now virtually unprotected. The two outer red-team wedges cut through the sides of the charge, not blocking in the expected manner. The legs of men on the attacking team flipped up through the air as men were violently upended. Ruben's center wedge smashed into the main group of blockers defending the point man with the broc. He tucked the broc tightly against his stomach and, following behind some of his guards, leaped over the tumbling tangle of men. Ruben, at the rear of the center wedge, running at full speed, deftly evaded the onrushing line of guards and sprang over the pileup of his blockers. As he jumped, he pushed off with one foot, twisting as he leaped off from the ground so that he spiraled through the air. In midair, as they came together, Ruben hooked his right arm around the other point man's head as if to tackle him, but the momentum of his spin suddenly and violently twisted the man's head around. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (171 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan could hear the sound of the pop as the point man's neck broke.

Ruben rose up over the point man lying dead in the center of the field. The man's head lay twisted back at a gruesome angle. Ruben scooped the loose broc up off the ground, trotted through the stunned, confused players, and threw a point that didn't count. The meaning of what he'd just done was clear: if another team played specifically to harm anyone on his team, then he would retaliate with a withering response. He was giving notice that by their own actions they were choosing for themselves what would happen to them. Kahlan now knew without doubt that Ruben's red paint was no hollow display. The men on the other team lived only by his grace. Surrounded by nearly uncountable captors, with dozens of arrows pointed at him, this one man had just laid down his own laws, laws that could not be avoided or dismissed. He had just told his opponents how they would play against him and his team. It was a clear message that, by their own actions, Ruben's opponents chose their own fate.

Kahlan wondered just how many points the red team was going to win by. She expected it was going to be a rout. Just then, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted the messenger rushing up, waving an arm to get the emperor's attention as he shoved his way through the big guards. \"Excellency,\" the excited man said in a breathless voice, \"the men have gotten in. The Sisters there at the site asked for you to come at once.\" Jagang asked no questions and wasted no time. As the play on the field resumed he started away.

In an effort to get her bearings her mind snatched at memories of every sort, frantically searching through their ever-changing essence, trying to find ones that seemed relevant, ones that fit. The great store of all of her thoughts seemed in as much disarray as a library full of books scattered by the twisting winds of a thunderstorm. Nothing seemed to make sense to her. She couldn't understand where she was. \"Nicci, it's me, Cara. You're safe. Calm down.\" A different voice in the murky, blurry distance said, \"I'll go get Zedd.\" Nicci saw the dark shape move and then vanish into yet more darkness.

She thought she might cry with relief at finally being able, out of all the shapes and shadows, to grasp the simple concept of a doorway, and the vastly more complex concept of a person. \"Nicci, calm down,\" Cara repeated.

When one memory fit-the memory of the hallway with Rikka, Zedd, and Cara up ahead frozen in place on the stairs-she went on to the next and worked to add another piece. By the sheer force of her will, order began tumbling into place. Her thoughts fused into coherence. Her memories began to coalesce. \"You're safe,\" Cara said, still holding Nicci's arms. \"Be still, now.\" Nicci wasn't safe. None of them were safe.

The red color of the Mord-Sith's leather outfit hurt Nicci's eyes, so she closed them. The cloth felt like a thorned hedge being pressed against her tender flesh. \"There is other trouble,\" Cara said in a quiet, confidential voice.

But this was different. This was well beyond what Nicci had done with the beast. This, in a way, was the opposite of what she had done. \"Zedd, I don't understand how such a thing is possible. It's like throwing a rock; once thrown, the trajectory is set. The rock would follow that trajectory to a termination point.\" \"She hit you on the head with your own rock before you'd even thrown it,\" Cara said. Zedd fixed her in a murderous scowl, as if she were an impetuous student who had just spoken out of turn. Cara's mouth took on an obstinate twist, but she kept it closed. Nicci ignored the interruption as she went on. \"She would have needed to act on specific power as it was engendered-before it was even fully formed-as it began to ignite.

I realized in that instant that my use of force was what was giving her the power she needed.\" \"So you didn't use force.\" He spread his hands as if she had finally grasped the lesson. \"Sometimes doing what you would most like to do can be the very worst thing to do. Sometimes to accomplish what you want in the end, you have to hold back in the beginning.\" As the concept he'd expressed sank in, yet more of her disordered memories-perplexing pieces of some grand puzzle that had never before fit anywhere-having been freed from where they languished in the dark corners of her mind, tumbled into place. It was as if she was seeing everything in a new light. The sudden realizations were jolting. Nicci's jaw fell open. Her eyes went wide. \"I understand, now. I know what it meant.

Like any constructed spell, in the right conditions it is triggered by a specific set of events. It then runs according to its predetermined protocols. Yet, no matter how complex it is, once begun it still functions according to basic principles.\" \"And the sun rises in the east,\" Zedd growled. \"What are you getting at?\" \"It all correlates,\" she said to herself as she stared off at nothing for a moment. She abruptly turned her attention back to the wizard. \"The Book of Life explains how to put the power of Orden in play. It lays out the protocols.

Why did they always end up putting her in a pink nightdress? She imagined that it must have been all they had at hand. She ignited a razor-thin flow of Subtractive Magic almost without a thought and directed it downward through the fabric of the nightdress. With that power she scavenged through the fabric itself, allowing the Sub-tractive flow to seek only the elements of the dye, and eliminate it. The color in the nightdress, starting at the neckline, faded away in a wave that went through the entire garment. Eliminating the pink color left behind a simple, off-white color to the cloth.

Zedd's hand paused. He was starting to look exasperated. \"That is the purpose. To counter Chainfire.\" \"No, no.

His gaze tracked her as she paced. \"Well, yes, there somehow has to be a reestablishment to real events from the past.\" He scratched his temple as he viewed her askance. \"Are you saying that you think that you now understand how such a thing could work?\" Nicci's bare feet padded across the carpets as she paced. \"From file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (189 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 what I've pieced together from what I've read, those who created the boxes of Orden, even though they intended them to be a counter to Chainfire, weren't themselves convinced that such a thing could actually be done.\" Nicci halted to look at him. \"Can you even imagine how monumentally complex such a thing would have to be?

She would only be able to go on from her life after the Chainfire spell had taken her identity from her. She would only be aware of things from that point on. She would be a different person, a person who would have to build a new life for herself. \"All the while she would have the knowledge that she was supposed to love this person, Richard, whom she doesn't know and for whom she has no real feeling.\" \"So, then she would be the only casualty,\" Cara said. \"The rest of us would be restored.\" Nicci sighed. \"Well, that's my belief from my understanding of the theory.\" Zedd was looking suspicious again. \"But there is an alternate possibility?\" Nicci nodded. \"Not one I'd like to contemplate. One of the lines of reasoning in the books of Ordenic theory postulates that absent the anchor it needs in a sterile field, the counter would be unable to run its protocols and collapse in on itself. That line of reasoning suggests that in such a circumstance the counter would fail and the Chainfire event would burn on out of control. Life as we know it would be lost.

In a way, as much as Kahlan means to Richard, I'm afraid that in this she has become secondary to the Chainfire event. It may have started with her, but* now everyone is infected. If that event is not stopped, everything is lost. Countering Chainfire has become more important than Richard and Kahlan's love for each other. It would be wonderful if her love for him could be restored, but it isn't necessary in order to counter the Chainfire event. \"Regardless of what it means for this one person, for Kahlan, or what it means for Richard, personally, the power of Orden must be invoked to counter Chainfire in order to purge the infection from everyone else. \"There's one other alternate theory, besides the one about the whole thing not working if the field is tainted.

It's as simple as that.\" The room was silent for a moment. Zedd rubbed a finger back and forth on his chin as he gazed off into the shadows. \"It would seem wise, in view of such dangers- whether real or not-to see to it that if Kahlan is found she be kept in the dark about her former feelings for Richard.

Great harm can sometimes result from the best of intentions. \"When we find the boy we can tell him all this. But we're an awfully long way from any of this ever happening. We no longer have even one of the boxes of Orden.\" Nicci sighed. \"True enough.

He might be more open to listening.\" Zedd glanced her way before resuming his pacing. \"I understand.\" He halted and turned to Nicci. \"But I'm still not sure I buy the whole theory about emotional foreknowledge being able to taint...\" In midsentence, Zedd's mouth snapped closed with a startled expression. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (203 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"What?\" Nicci asked. \"Did you think of something?\" Zedd sank down to sit on the edge of the bed. \"Yes, I most certainly did.\" The power, the fire, had gone out of him. \"Dear spirits,\" he whispered, sounding as if the weight of his years had just settled on his slumped shoulders. Nicci leaned down and touched his arm. \"Zedd, what's wrong?\" He looked up at her with haunted eyes. \"Foreknowledge can affect how magic works. It's not a theory. It's true.\" \"Are you sure? How do you know?\" \"I don't remember Kahlan, or anything about her. When Richard was here, though, he told me about her. He filled me in on my missing memories of how he came to love her, and she him. \"Kahlan is a Confessor. A Confessor's gift destroys the mind of the person she touches with her power. Confessors release their restraint on their power to unleash it. The rest of the time they must keep it under their tight control.\" \"I know, I've heard about their ability,\" Nicci said. \"But what does that have to do with their love?\" \"A Confessor always chooses her mate from among those they don't really care about because if she were to be intimate with a man she loved she would unintentionally lose control of that power.

Men fear an unmarried Confessor in search of a mate, fear being chosen, fear losing who they are to her power.\" \"But there obviously must be a way for it to work,\" Nicci said. \"How did Richard accomplish it?\" Zedd looked up. \"There is only one way. I can't tell you what it was. I couldn't tell Richard, either. I couldn't even tell him that a way existed.\" \"Why not?\" she asked. \"Because the foreknowledge would have tainted him and her magic, when first she unleashed it on him without intending to, would have taken him. He had to be totally unaware of the solution to it, or that a solution even existed, or that solution would not have worked.\" Zedd stared at the floor. \"It is no theory. Foreknowledge can taint a sterile field, as you put it. Richard himself proved the central question of Or-denic theory: foreknowledge can affect the function of magic.\" Nicci padded barefoot across the carpet to stand before him. She frowned down at the old wizard. \"You knew of this beforehand, before Richard and Kahlan were married? You knew that the foreknowledge of the solution would cause it to fail in Richard?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (205 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"I did.

They, too, ended up in love and married. Since that time, Richard was the first to ever again solve the problem. Since Magda Searus was the first Confessor, no one knew that there was a solution; therefore, there was not yet any foreknowledge to taint him. Without such foreknowledge he was able to solve the paradox of loving a Confessor without her power destroying him.\" Nicci pulled at a strand of blond hair as she considered. \"Then the reality of foreknowledge alone being able to taint magic is true.\" She frowned down at Zedd. \"But the wizards who created Orden knew of no example of foreknowledge tainting a spell. It was only a theory for them.\" Zedd shrugged. \"That probably means that Confessors were created after Orden. First Wizard Merritt proved the concept, so maybe it happened after Orden had already been created.\" Nicci sighed at it all. \"I suppose that might be the answer.\" She gestured vaguely as she went on to other business. \"Casa said something, before, about there being a problem. A problem with the Keep.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (206 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Zedd finally looked up from his private thoughts and stood. The creases in his face drew into a grave expression. \"Yes, there is trouble.\" \"What sort of trouble?\" Nicci asked. He started for the door. \"Come with me, and I'll show you.\" CHAPTER 14 Zedd led Nicci and Cara toward an area of the Keep that Nicci knew to be a labyrinth of halfs and passageways heavily guarded by layers of shields. Glass spheres in iron brackets brightened in turn as they approached each one, then faded back into darkness as they passed. The Keep felt like a great, silent, gloomy place to Nicci. It was not only immense, but immensely complex, and she couldn't imagine what could be the trouble with it that so concerned Zedd. Before they had gone far, Rikka; Tom, the big blond-headed D'Haran from Lord Rahl's elite guard; and Friedrich the old gilder emerged from a reading room to join in the quiet procession. Nicci guessed that they had all been waiting there for her to awake from her encounter with Six. That Zedd had probably asked them to stand by and wait for Nicci to wake only heightened her growing sense of concern. \"You look a lot better than you did last night,\" Rikka said as they started through a cozy room hung with hundreds of paintings of every size. The paintings, each in a rich gold-leaf frame, covered every bit of the walls. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (207 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Thanks. I'm fine now.\" Nicci noticed that the paintings hung throughout the room were all por-. traits, though the styles varied greatly. The subjects in some, dressed in ceremonial robes, sat in formal poses while in others the people stood casually in beautiful gardens, met in conversation among grand columns, or relaxed on benches in courtyards. She saw that in many of the portraits the Keep, or parts of it, were visible in the background. It was a somewhat startling and sad thought to realize that all of these people had probably once lived in the Keep, a place that had been alive with life. It made the place now seem all the more deserted and empty. Rikka cast a sidelong glance down the length of Nicci. \"That nightdress was pink, before.\" \"I hate pink,\" Nicci said. Rikka looked disappointed. \"Really? When Cara and I put you in it I thought that it made you look even prettier.\" At first startled by such a statement coming from a Mord-Sith, Nicci suddenly grasped the whole pink nightgown thing. This was a woman trying to find her way out of the dark wasteland of madness. She was trying to throw off the shackles of emotions that had been drilled into her since she had been a girl. Everything in her life, her world, had been ugly and violent. The pink nightdress represented something innocent and lovely- the kind of thing forbidden to the likes of a Mord-Sith. By appreciating such a simple thing on Nicci, she was testing the possibility of enjoying something attractive and harmless-testing dreams. It was much the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (208 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 same as a young girl making a pretty dress for a doll. It was a considered examination of aesthetics and, more than that, it was practice at aspirations. \"Thank you,\" Nicci said. After a moment's consideration she added, \"It is a pretty nightdress, it's just that it's the wrong color for me, that's all. How about if after I'm dressed I return the color to the nightdress and you can have it.\" Rikka's expression turned suspicious. \"Me? I don't know if-\" \"It would look beautiful on you. Honest. The pink color would go well with your skin tones.\" Rikka looked a bit flustered and uncertain. \"Really?\" Nicci nodded. \"It would be perfect for you. I'd like you to have it.\" Rikka hesitated a moment. \"Well, I'll think about it,\" she finally said. \"I'll clean it and make sure the color is just the right shade of pink for you.\" Rikka smiled. \"Thanks.\" Nicci wished that Richard could have been there to see the small smile that was such a great risk for a Mord-Sith. He would have understood that such a seemingly tentative step was really a rather big shift for such a woman. Nicci realized, too, that it warmed her own heart to see such a positive, if tiny, step back toward the simple joys of life. She comprehended at seeing Rikka's smile how Richard must feel at such things. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (209 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 As a yet larger realization dawned on her, she almost laughed out loud. Richard would not merely have appreciated Rikka's growth, he would also have seen Nicci-Death's Mistress-learning herself how to connect another person with the joy of life, if only in a small matter. She hadn't even realized that she and Rikka had just taken a step together. Nicci couldn't imagine how Richard must have felt to have brought her back from the dark existence she had lived for her whole life. For just an instant, she had a glimpse, a vision, of life through Richard's eyes. It was a staggeringly joyous perspective, a view of how each person's choices could make their own life better. It was a vision of the possible, of how things could and should be. How she missed trim. She would have given anything at that moment just to see his smile, that smile that seemed to reflect all that was good and decent. She missed him so much that she thought she might burst into tears. Rikka cast Nicci a sidelong glance. \"Are you all right? The witch woman didn't do you any lasting harm, did she? You look a little, I don't know . . . distressed.\" Nicci dismissed the concern with a flick of a hand and changed the subject. \"Did you find Rachel?\" As they emerged from a stone room lined with tapestries of country scenes and into a broad hall with wood-paneled walls, the Mord-Sith gave Nicci an unreadable look. \"No. Early this morning Chase came back and told us that he found her tracks outside the Keep. He went off looking for her.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (210 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Rachel was another of those connections back to the simple joys of life for Rikka. Nicci knew that Rikka was quite fond of the girl, even though she never came close to admitting it. \"I don't know what in the world could have gotten into her,\" Zedd said back over his shoulder as he led them around a corner and into a narrower hallway. \"It's just not like her to run off.\" \"Do you think it could have anything to do with Six being here?\" Nicci suggested. \"Maybe she's responsible.\" Rikka shook her head. \"Chase said that Rachel's tracks are all alone. He said that he didn't see any of Six's tracks.\" \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Cara asked Nicci. \"You mean about the lesson Richard gave us one time about tracks?\" Cara nodded. \"He talked about magic being able to hide tracks.\" \"True enough,\" Zedd put in. \"But Rachel disappeared before Six showed up. If Six were trying to hide her tracks with some sort of magic, what would be the point of hiding her own tracks if she didn't hide Rachel's as well?\" Nicci halted abruptly. She turned back to the opening they had just passed through. A gilded pillar stood to each side of the small portal in the passageway. The pillars held up a stout beam with symbols carved in it. She frowned at the pillars. \"Wasn't there a shield there, before?\" Zedd's dark look told her that she was right. As he started away again they all rushed to catch up. At the end of the hall, he turned down a short passageway to the right that led to a spiral stairway. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (211 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Compared with some of the grand staircases in the Keep, the spiral stairs were small, but compared with typical spiral stairs, these were remarkable.

The stairwell was so large, though, that the outer end of each wedge of tread would have required a person to take several steps before reaching each leading edge. The stairs also wandered with an odd twist, winding downward in an oblong corkscrew. The whole thing was disorienting and required her to pay attention lest she trip and fall on the unconventional configuration. As they descended she was able at last to see that the stairs were designed so as to make their way around and then under a formation of rock veined with sparkling minerals. At the bottom of the stairs a short passageway spilled into the familiar split in the mountain that separated the rooms of the containment field from the bedrock of the mountain itself. This was very near the place where the witch woman had caught them unexpectedly. Nicci thought that the halls felt especially quiet after the violation of the witch woman roaming unfettered through them. Knowing as much as she did about shields, she didn't think that such a thing should have been possible. The wizards who had created this place and its defenses would certainly have made provisions to protect against all forms of magic, including that of a witch woman. \"Here,\" Zedd announced as he came to a halt. \"This is where it first appeared.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (212 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He gestured up at the precisely fit stone blocks of the wall opposite the raw, carved-out, natural granite wall of the mountain itself.

It seemed as if something might be weeping out of the stone itself. \"What is it?\" She asked. Zedd swiped a finger through one of the dark places. He held the finger up before her. \"Blood.\" Nicci blinked. She stared at the thick, wet, red substance on his finger. She looked back at the wizard's eyes. \"Blood?\" He nodded solemnly. \"Blood.\" \"Real blood?\" \"Real blood,\" he confirmed. \"Blood from some kind of animals?\" Nicci remembered all the bats that had fled through these very halls, driven before the witch woman. \"Maybe the bats?\" \"Human blood,\" the wizard said.

I just don't know what kind of trouble.\" She turned her attention back to Zedd. \"Do you have any idea what it means?\" \"It means that the Keep itself is bleeding, in a way. It means that it's dying.\" Nicci could only blink at what she'd just heard. \"Dying?\" Looking grim, Zedd nodded. \"That shield back there that you asked about?

Six danced in here all by herself without the alarms sounding or the defenses stopping her. She merely had to take some detours to get around shields that are still functioning.\" \"The chimes . . .\" Nicci breathed, suddenly understanding. Zedd conceded with a nod. \"Richard was right.\" \"Can anything be done?\" \"Yes,\" Zedd said. \"If we can find Richard we can get him to open the correct box of Orden. The Chainfire spell is also contaminated by the chimes. This is confirmation that the taint left by the chimes is corrupting all magic-not only the Chainfire spell-just as Richard told us it was. He needs to unleash Orden and hope that its power will be able to purge the world not only of Chainfire but of the taint left by the chimes having been loose in the world of life.\" Nicci cocked her head. \"Zedd, Orden is designed for a specific purpose: to counter Chainfire. Orden isn't going seek out other magic plaguing us and purge it as well.

They were a very long way from having Richard attempt such a thing. They first had to find Richard before anything else could even be considered. After that, there were difficulties with Richard opening a box of Orden that Nicci had not even begun to reveal to Zedd because she hadn't wanted to worry him any more than was necessary. There were, after all, enough immediate problems they had to solve. \"In the meantime,\" Zedd said, \"we must evacuate the Keep.\" Nicci was taken aback. \"But if the Keep is weakened, then we must do just the opposite; we must defend it.

All we can do is try.\" \"What if it's already been corrupted by the chimes?\" Friedrich asked. \"After all, if the Keep is infected, and this spell is part of the Keep's original power, what's to say it's not corrupted as well?\" Friedrich, having been married to a sorceress most of his life, knew quite a bit about magic even though he was not himself gifted. \"I tried to run verification webs on some of the corrupted aspects of the Keep, such as the alarms. The corruption prevented the verification from functioning. The verification on the spell in the bone box worked without any difficulty. From my tests it's still viable.\" \"Why can't we stay here and put the Keep in this protective state?\" Cara asked. \"It's too dangerous,\" Zedd told her. \"The emergency procedure has never been employed before. I'm not sure of its precise nature or exactly how it works, but the information I reviewed said that such a state will prevent anyone from entering. I can only assume that such an emergency condition, by necessity, would deal harshly with any intruders. It appears that it's a form of light spell. From the limited amount that I know about the conditions of the interior of the Keep in such a state, it would be very dangerous for anyone to be in the place. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (218 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:12 PM]"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"After all, how can we know that there aren't intruders in the Keep right now?\" Cara straightened. \"Now?\" \"Yes. If the Keep's defenses are failing, and the alarms aren't working, how would we know if there were people wandering about who don't belong in here? For all we know, Six could still be lurking about. Chase said he didn't find any tracks of her leaving. Sisters of the Dark could have snuck in as well. There's no longer a dependable way for us to know. \"Even more concerning is that enemies could enter through the sliph. Richard is the only one who could put the sliph back to sleep; we can't. The sliph isn't designed to deny her services to anyone who asks and has the proper power. Jagang could send Sisters of the Dark in through the sliph. There aren't enough of us to guard the sliph all the time, at least not enough of us with enough power to have a chance to defend against an attack from Sisters of the Dark. \"Without the ability to put the sliph back to sleep, or to be able to depend on alarms and shields to protect the Keep, it remains vulnerable to intrusion of all sorts. It must be assumed that such a spell, by its very nature, would eliminate anyone in the Keep.

It seems the only way to preserve the Keep for the time being.\" \"Besides that,\" Zedd said, \"we can't just continue to sit here.\" \"No,\" Nicci said, \"I don't suppose we can.\" She was already thinking of things that had to be done. There were any number of places she needed to go. \"It seems to me,\" Zedd said as he looked around at those waiting for his pronouncement, \"that the first thing to be done is to try to get Richard his power back.

The sliph is much faster, so I will have time at the palace to check into some things.\" \"Like what?\" Zedd asked. \"Well, with Richard missing and cut off from his power, Nathan is acting in the capacity of Lord Rahl. That bond is all that stands between us and the dream walker being able to enter our minds.

We may need your help to deal with whatever is going on down there in Tamarang, and you will definitely need my help to come up with a way to deal with Six. She has already proven how dangerous she is. You're not going to be able to sneak up on her and take back the box. If we get a lead on where she might be, we're going to have to put our heads together and come up with a plan.\" \"Agreed,\" Nicci said. \"What about the sliph-after I've gone through, I mean?

The sliph will draw branches of the spell, hardening that entry point just like any other. Once you leave through the sliph I'll activate the spell.\" \"I'm going with you,\" Cara said to Nicci. It wasn't a request. \"I'll go with Zedd, then,\" Rikka said. \"He'll need one of us looking after him.\" Zedd shot her a sour glare but didn't say anything.

Nicci concentrated on that happy thought, rather than on how nervous she was about again traveling in the sliph. This time, Richard would not be with her to help her. CHAPTER 15 What is it?\" Jennsen whispered to the young woman ahead of her as they both crawled through the tall, dry grass. \"Shh\" was Laurie's only answer. Laurie and her husband had been out in the desolate place picking a late crop of wild figs that grew among the low hills. In the course of their work, as they had picked farther and farther afield, they had separated. As the afternoon drew to a close Laurie had wanted to head back to town but she hadn't been able to find her husband. He seemed to have vanished. Increasingly distraught, she'd eventually run back to the town of Hawton seeking Jennsen's help. Needing to rush, Jennsen had decided to leave her pet goat, Betty, in her pen. Betty hadn't been happy about it, but Jennsen was more concerned about finding file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (223 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Laurie's husband. By the time they had returned with a small search party the sun had long since gone down. As Owen, his wife Marilee, Anson, and Jennsen had spread out searching in among the low hills for Laurie's missing husband, Laurie had found something she hadn't expected. It had clearly shaken her. She wouldn't say what it was; she wanted Jennsen to hurry to see it for herself, and she wanted Jennsen to be quiet about it. Laurie cautiously lifted her head just enough to look off into the night. She pointed and at the same time leaned back so that Jennsen could hear her whisper. \"There.\" By now infected with Laurie's obvious sense of alarm, Jennsen carefully stretched her neck up to peer into the darkness. The tomb was open. The great granite monument to Nathan Rahl had been slid to the side. Light shone up from under the ground, creating a softly glowing beacon in the dark heart of the starlit night. Jennsen knew, of course, that it was not really Nathan Rahl's tomb. Laurie wouldn't know that, though. Back when Nathan and Ann had been staying with them, Nathan had discovered the tomb with his name on it. He had also discovered that what appeared to be a rather extravagant tomb in the ancient graveyard was actually an entrance to secret underground rooms filled with books. He and Ann had told Jennsen that the stash was thousands of years old and had been file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (224 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 protected all that time by magic. Jennsen wouldn't know; she had no magic. She was pristinely ungifted-a hole in the world, as it was sometimes called because those with magic were unable to use their gift to sense those like Jennsen. She was a rare creature-a pillar of Creation. She and the people with her down in Bandakar were all pillars of Creation. In ancient times it had been learned that when the pristinely ungifted mingled with normal people, all of whom possessed at least a small spark of the gift, every child of such unions would be pristinely ungifted. Roaming free in the world they forever carried the latent potential to breed the gift itself out of mankind. In antiquity the solution to the ever-growing numbers of the pristinely ungifted had been to gather them all together and banish them. The pristinely ungifted trait originated in the offspring of the Lord Rahl. Pristinely ungifted births were exceedingly rare, but once those with the trait became adults, the anomaly was spread forth into the general population. After the ancestors of these people in Bandakar had been banished, every child of a Rahl was tested. If found to be born pristinely ungifted such a child would immediately be put to death to prevent the trait from ever again spreading into the general population. Jennsen, the offspring of rape by Darken Rahl, had managed to defy the odds and escape detection. Since Richard was now the Lord Rahl, eliminating any such flaw in his lineage fell to him. But Richard found the very thought abhorrent and would not do such a thing. He believed that Jennsen and those like her had the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (225 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 same right to life as did he. He had actually been happy to discover that he had a half sister-pristinely ungifted or not. He had greeted her with open arms rather than murderous intent, as she had once expected. Richard had broken the banishment and freed these people to live their own lives. Since Richard had become the Lord Rahl, they were no longer banished but welcomed into the world, as was Jennsen. Despite what it would eventually mean for the existence of magic within mankind, he had destroyed the barrier barring these people from the rest of the world. Since the barrier had come down, many of the people from Bandakar had been captured by the Imperial Order and taken away to be used for breeding stock to hasten the end of magic. After the Imperial Order had been driven from Bandakar, most of the rest of these people had chosen to remain in their ancestral homeland for the time being. They wanted to take some time to learn about the outside world before deciding what they would do. Jennsen felt a kinship with these people. Having been in hiding her whole life for fear of being put to death for the crime of her birth, she had in a way suffered under her own form of banishment. She had wanted to remain with these people as they all learned to be a part of their new, wider world. That new beginning, that excitement of building a new life for themselves full of possibilities, was a passion shared by them all. Laurie obviously felt a sense of dread that their world was again being threatened. But with the Imperial Order on the march everyone's world was threatened. In that sense there was nothing file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (226 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 especially unique about the pristinely ungifted. Jennsen wasn't sure who it was that was now down in the tomb. She reasoned that it might be Nathan and Ann returned to retrieve books they needed from the long-forgotten underground library. Those books, too, had been banished to their hiding place behind boundaries that none had been able to cross until Richard had come along. Jennsen reasoned that it might also be Richard down in the tomb. Nathan and Ann had long ago set off with Tom to find him. If they had succeeded they would have told him about the underground library. Perhaps he'd returned to see the ancient library for himself, or maybe he'd returned looking for something specific. Jennsen would dearly love to see her brother again. The very idea of it gave her a flutter of excitement. She realized, though, that it could be someone else-someone who could harm them all. It was that thought that kept her from rushing down into the tomb. Despite how much she wanted to go and see if it was Richard, Jennsen's life on the run with her mother had given her a finely honed sense of caution, so she crouched motionless, watching for any sign of who it might be down in the tomb. Mockingbirds in the distance repeated calls into the still darkness, trying to outdo one another in a kind of endless nightly argument. As she idly listened to the strident calls, Jennsen knew that it would be best to remain hidden and wait for whoever was down inside the tomb to appear, but she worried that the others might file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (227 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 return from their search and inadvertently give them away, so she decided that as she kept an eye on the tomb it would be best to send Laurie to find the others and warn them about the unknown intruders. Before Jennsen could crawl in close and whisper instructions to Laurie, the young woman abruptly started crawling forward. Apparently, she'd decided that it might be her husband down in the tomb. Jennsen lunged, snatching at the young woman's ankle, but it was out of reach. \"Laurie!\" Jennsen whispered. \"Stop!\" Laurie ignored the command, instead skittering off through the dry grass. Jennsen immediately crawled after her, wending her way among ancient grave markers scattered about on the uneven ground. The dry grass made far too much noise for Jennsen's liking. Laurie wasn't being especially careful, or quiet. Jennsen had been schooled in evasion and escape by her mother. Laurie didn't know much about such things. Some distance ahead in the darkness, Laurie gasped in fright. Jennsen lifted her head just enough to try to see if anyone was nearby, but in the darkness it was hard to see much of anything. For all Jennsen knew there could be a dozen men spread out around them. If they remained still it would be difficult, if not impossible, to see them. Laurie suddenly rose up on her knees as she let out a wail of horror that sent a ripple of goose bumps up the nape of Jennsen's neck. The scream shattered the quiet of the night. The mockingbirds fell file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (228 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 silent. In the dead of night, such a scream would carry great distances. No longer having to worry about giving herself away, Jennsen scrambled to her feet and raced to cover the remaining distance to the woman. Overcome with abject misery, Laurie held her hair in her fists as she threw her head back and cried in desolation. The body of a man lay sprawled in the grass before her. Even though it was too dark for Jennsen to make out the face, it was only too obvious who it had to be. Jennsen pulled the silver-handled knife from the sheath at her waist. Just as she did so, the dark shape of a big man, sword in hand, loomed up out of the darkness. He had probably been the one who had killed Laurie's husband. After that he'd likely crouched somewhere nearby to be on watch for anyone else who might approach the open tomb. Just as Jennsen reached Laurie, but before she could knock the young woman out of harm's way, the man swung the sword. The dark blur of the blade slashed across Laurie's throat, nearly decapitating her. Splatters of warm blood splashed across the side of Jennsen's face. Her horror was instantly banished by a flash of anger. She might have expected dread, fear, or even panic, but it was a rush of hot rage that erupted through her. It was an anger first ignited by others who had so long ago come out of nowhere and brutally murdered her mother. Before the sword had even finished the murderous slash, Jennsen file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (229 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 was already leaping toward the man. She leaped out of the darkness, hitting him square in the chest with her knife. Before he could even flinch back in surprise, she pulled the knife back and, gripping it tightly in her fist, stabbed it into his neck three times in rapid succession. Atop him, she rode him to the ground, still furiously stabbing him. Only when his breath gurgled to a halt did she stop. In the sudden stillness, she panted, catching her breath. She struggled to not allow herself to become paralyzed by the shock of what had just happened. If there was one guard, there would likely be others. She knew for certain that there was someone down in the tomb. She had to get away from the place where Laurie had screamed. Jennsen told herself to move. Moving was her best defense, now. Moving was life. Crouching low, she started slipping away to the side, the whole time keeping an eye on the shaft of light rising up from the tomb, watching for anyone who might emerge to investigate the noise and discover the bodies. A second man seemed suddenly to materialize out of the black night, rising up out of the grass right in front of her. Jennsen flipped the knife in her hand, getting a fighting grip on it, rather than the stabbing grip she'd had when she'd taken the other man down. Her heart pounded wildly as she looked around for other threats. She ignored the man's command to stop and instead quickly feinted file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (230 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 left. As he lunged in that direction, grabbing for her, Jennsen instead rolled to the right. Another man appeared out of the darkness, responding to the yells of the first man, blocking any escape to that side. The light coming from the tomb glinted softly off links of the chain mail covering the man's broad chest and the axe gripped in a meaty fist. Long greasy strings of hair hung down over his shoulders. She reminded herself to remember his chain mail in case she had to fight him off. Her knife would be largely ineffective against such armor. She would need to find vulnerable spots. She realized that she had been lucky that the man she'd fought, the man who had killed Laurie, hadn't been wearing chain mail. Jennsen's frantic urge was to turn and run in blind panic but she knew that running would be a mistake. Running aroused the instinct to chase. Once in a chase, that instinct took over and men like this wouldn't stop until they had a kill. Both men expected her to run in the direction that seemed open to her-away to her left. Instead, she bolted for them, intending to slip right between them and out of their snare before they could close in. The closest man, the one she knew to be wearing mail, had his axe at the ready. Before he could raise it and strike, she slashed the exposed inside of his arm. Her razor-sharp knife sliced across the meat of the underside of his forearm, just up from the wrist. She could hear the soft snap of tendons under tension parting as they were cut. The man cried out. Unable to hold his axe, he dropped it to the ground.

She spun and slammed the weapon into his back as he flew past. Jennsen scrambled away as one of the men held his useless right arm and the other wheeled toward her with an axe handle jutting up at an angle from his back. He staggered a few steps, still coming for her, before he dropped to a knee gasping for breath. By the gurgling sound of his breathing, she knew that she had punctured his lung at the least. It was clear that he was in no condition to fight, so she turned her attention elsewhere. If she was going to escape, this was her chance. Without hesitation, she took it. Almost immediately a wall of men loomed up before her. Jennsen skidded to a stop. Men appeared all around her. From the corner of her eye she saw shadows twisting through the shaft of light as figures raced up from within the tomb. \"If you want,\" the man in front of her said in a gruff voice, \"we'd be happy to cut you down. Otherwise, I'd suggest you just hand me that knife.\" Jennsen stood frozen, considering her options. Her mind didn't seem to want to work. In the distance she could see figures, silhouetted by the light, rushing toward her from the tomb. The man held out a hand. \"The knife,\" he said with menace. Jennsen wheeled her arm and stabbed him through the palm of his hand. As he flinched back at the same time Jennsen pulled, the blade parted his hand between his two middle fingers. The night air file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (232 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 rang with a rage of profanity. Jennsen took the chance to dart through the biggest opening in the wall of men and into the darkness beyond. Before she had run three steps an arm hooked her around the middle. He yanked her back so violently that it drove the air from her in a whoosh. The soldier slammed her back against his leather armor. Jennsen gasped for breath. Before he was able to corral her flailing arms, she drove her knife into his thigh. The tip hit bone and stuck. Cursing, he finally collected her arms, pinning them to her sides. Tears of terror and frustration stung at her eyes. She was going to die here in the middle of a graveyard without ever seeing Tom again. At that moment, he was all that seemed important, all she wanted. He would never know what had happened to her. She would never be able to tell him one last time how much she loved him. The soldier jerked the knife from his leg. She gasped back a sob at all that was lost to her, all that was lost to these people. Before the men could tear her apart as she expected them to do, someone appeared with a lantern. It was a woman. She had something else in the same hand as the lantern. She came to a halt before Jennsen, scowling as she took charge of the situation. \"Be quiet,\" the woman said to the man holding his bloody hand and still cursing. \"The bitch stabbed my hand!\" \"And my leg!\" the man holding her added. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (233 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The woman glanced to the bodies lying nearby. \"Looks like you got off lucky.\" \"I guess,\" the man holding Jennsen finally grumbled, clearly uncomfortable under her implacable scrutiny.

What good do you think you will be in that service if you are a cripple? Now, shut your mouth or I won't even consider healing you.\" When he hung his head in mute agreement, the woman finally withdrew her glare and turned her attention to Jennsen. Holding the lantern up, she leaned in to get a better look at Jennsen's face. Jennsen saw then that it was a book she was holding in the hand along with the lantern. She had probably stolen the book from the underground stash. \"Amazing,\" she said, as if speaking to herself as she studied Jennsen's eyes. \"You're right there in front of me, and yet my gift says you are not.\" Jennsen realized that the woman had to be a sorceress, probably one of Jagang's Sisters. Jennsen could not be directly harmed by the powers of such a woman, or anyone with magic, but under the circumstances, that hardly meant that she wasn't a threat. After all, she didn't need magic to orrder the soldiers to put Jennsen to death. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (234 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The woman held out the knife, peering at what was on the handle.

It stuck in the ground at her feet as she put the fingers of one hand to her forehead, wincing as if in pain. The silent soldiers shared troubled looks. When she looked up again, the woman's face had gone blank. \"Well, well, well. If it isn't Jennsen Rahl.\" Her voice sounded different. It was deeper, and carried a threatening, masculine tone. It was Jennsen's turn to frown. \"You know me?\" \"Oh yes, darlin, I know you,\" the woman said in a voice that had turned deep and husky. \"Seems I recall you swearing to me that you would kill Richard Rahl.\" Jennsen understood, then. It was Emperor Jagang, seeing her through the eyes of this woman. Jagang was a dream walker. He could do such seemingly impossible things. \"And what of your promise?\" the woman asked in a voice that wasn't entirely her own. Her movements were puppetlike and appeared to be painful.

Maybe he realized that his life had been wasted, that it had been for nothing.\" The woman glared but said nothing. Jennsen saw then a soft gold glint off the book the woman was holding in the same hand as the lantern. Jennsen could just make out the title in faded, worn gold lettering. It said The Book of Counted Shadows. Everyone turned at the sound of a commotion. Yet more men were dragging other captives closer. When they reached the light Jennsen's heart sank. The big soldiers had Anson, Owen, and Owen's wife, Marilee. All three were disheveled and bloody. The woman bent and retrieved Jennsen's knife at her feet. \"His Excellency has decided that he may have a use for these people,\" the woman said as she straightened.

It was Nathan. Ann followed close on his heels. For every one of Nathan's long strides Ann had to take three just to keep up. Their footsteps echoed off the golden-yellow and brown marble floor of the empty hallway. The rather simple hall was part of the private complex within the palace, used by the Lord Rahl, staff and officials, and, of course, Mord-Sith. It was a passageway of unadorned utility, making no pretense of grandeur. In her modest gray dress buttoned to her throat, Ann looked about the same to Nicci as she had when Nicci had been a child. Short and compact, like a dense thundercloud scudding across the landscape, she always seemed about to throw off lightning. The woman had loomed as an imposing figure in Nicci's mind from the time she'd first been sent to the Palace of the Prophets to become a young novice. Annalina Aldurren had always been the kind of woman who could elicit a babbling confession with nothing more than a stony stare. She struck terror into novices, fear into young wizards, and trepidation into most of the Sisters. As a novice, Nicci had suspected that the Creator Himself would walk on eggshells in the presence of the forbidding prelate, and mind his manners as well. \"We got the message that you've just arrived from the Keep,\" the tall prophet said in a deep, powerful voice as he and Ann caught up with Nicci and Cara. Considering that he was nearly a thousand years old, Nathan was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (237 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 still ruggedly handsome. He had Rahl features in common with Richard, including a hawklike brow. His eyes, though, were a beautiful azure color, while Richard's were gray. Despite his age, the prophet had a vigorous, purposeful stride. His age, like Nicci's, was relevant only to those who at the time had lived outside the spell of the Palace of the Prophets. Those in the palace aged just like anyone else, but at a slower rate only when compared to those who lived outside the spell. Time had moved differently within the palace. Now that the palace, the home of the Sisters of the Light for thousands of years, had been destroyed, Nathan, Ann, Nicci, and all the others who had once called the place home would age at the same rate as everyone else. Nicci remembered the prophet as always wearing robes when he'd lived as a captive in his apartments at the Palace of the Prophets. As a Sister of the Light, it had sometimes been required that she visit him in those apartments to write down anything he claimed to be prophecy. Nicci never really thought one way or the other about the task; it was just one of many required of her. There were Sisters, though, who would not go down into Nathan's apartments alone. Now he was in brown trousers and a ruffled white shirt under a dark green vest. The hem of his maroon cape hovered just above the floor, swirling around his black boots after he came to a halt. Dressed as he now was, he cut an imposing figure. Nicci couldn't imagine why, but at his hip he wore a sword sheathed in an elegant scabbard. Wizards hardly needed swords. Being the only prophet those at the palace had known of in recent file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (238 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 centuries, he had always been an unfathomable character. Many of the Sisters at the palace used to believe that Nathan was crazy. Many feared him. It wasn't so much that Nathan gave them cause for their fear as it was that their imagination provided colorful terrors that the mere sight of him somehow seemed to confirm. Nicci didn't know if very many of the Sisters now thought any differently, but she did know that a number of them were greatly worried because he was no longer locked up behind powerful shields. While a few thought he was rather harmless, if a little odd, most of the Sisters considered him to be the most dangerous man alive. Nicci had come to see him differently. Moreover, he was now the Lord Rahl, standing in for Richard. \"Where is Verna?\" Nicci asked. \"I need to talk with her as well.\" Coming to a halt beside Nathan, Ann tipped her head back toward the empty hallway. \"She and Adie are off meeting with General Trimack about security issues. Since it's getting late I told Berdine to let them both know that you and Cara just arrived from the Keep and that we will all shortly meet them in the private dining room.\" Nicci nodded. \"That sounds like a good idea.\" \"In the meantime,\" Nathan pressed, \"what news is there?\" Nicci was still disoriented from traveling in the sliph. It was a distracting experience in which time seemed to lose all meaning. On top of that, being in the People's Palace only added to her discomfort. The entire palace existed within a spell that amplified the power of the Lord Rahl. At the same time, the spell diminished the power of every other gifted person. Nicci wasn't used to the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (239 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 feeling. It made her restless and uneasy. Being in the sliph also reminded her of Richard. She supposed that everything made her think of Richard. It seemed that her nerves were always on edge with worry for him. It took a moment for Nicci to focus her mind on the question as she struggled to put thoughts of Richard aside. As improbable as it seemed, this man, not Richard, was now the Lord Rahl. Ann, the former prelate, his former jailer, stood beside him waiting to hear the answer to his question. \"I'm afraid that the news is not very good,\" Nicci admitted. \"You mean about Richard?\" Ann asked. Nicci shook her head. \"We've had no news about him, yet.\" Nathan's brow took on an even more suspicious slant. \"Then what news are you talking about?\" Nicci took a deep breath. It still felt strange breathing air after being in the sliph. Despite having traveled in the strange creature before, she didn't think she would ever get used to breathing into her lungs the liquid silver essence that was the sliph. Mentally gathering her thoughts, she gazed out over the short section of balcony railing. The particular portion of the hallway that they were in bridged a complex of expansive halls below. Overhead, out through the opening with the balcony, late-day light flooded into the palace through skylights above. The short balcony, between rather dark runs of the hallway beyond in either direction, was almost like a window looking out into the People's Palace. Nicci imagined that, being a rather small opening, it was probably file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (240 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 meant to allow a covert place to watch the halls below. Now, far below, people filling the various passageways hurried in every direction. Their movements looked purposeful. Nearly all of the benches were empty. Nicci didn't see people gathered in casual conversation the way they had in the past. This was a time of war; the People's Palace was under siege. Worry was everyone's constant companion. Guards patrolled, watching not just every person, but every shadow. Trying to decide how to sum up the troubling news, Nicci ran her fingers through her hair, sweeping it back away from her face. \"Remember Richard telling us about how the taint left by the chimes having been in the world of life was causing magic to fail?\" Ann flicked her hand in a dismissive gesture as she heaved a sigh, apparently annoyed to revisit an old topic. \"We remember. But I hardly think that it's our most pressing problem.\" \"Maybe not,\" Nicci said, \"but it has begun to cause some very real trouble.\" Nathan lifted a hand, the backs of his fingers touching Ann's shoulder, as if to implore her to let him handle the matter. \"How so?\" \"We've been forced to abandon the Wizard's Keep,\" Nicci told him. \"For the time being, at least.\" Nathan's eyebrows lifted. As he tilted his head toward her some of his long white hair fell forward over his broad shoulders. \"Why? What happened?\" Nicci smoothed the black dress at her hips. \"The magic of the Keep file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (241 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 is beginning to fail.\" \"How do you know?\" Ann demanded. \"The witch woman, Six, got into the Keep,\" Nicci said. \"The alarms failed to warn us.

It's difficult telling just how talented a woman like Six is liable to be. Just because there is some sort of problem with the Keep there is no way to know its cause, much less know that the chimes are the cause. With a place as complicated as the Keep it's difficult to really know if it really is all that serious. It could simply be a temporary-\" \"Blood is coming out of the stone walls of the Keep,\" Nicci said in a tone that made it clear she didn't want to debate it. She didn't appreciate being treated like a novice frightened by shadows on her first night away from home. She needed to get on to other matters. \"It's worse down in the lower areas, in the foundation.\" Ann and Nathan both straightened. Ann opened her mouth to say something, but Cara spoke first, apparently as disinterested in having to argue the point as Nicci. \"The blood oozing out of the stone in various places all over the Keep is all human blood.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (242 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Again, both the prophet and the former prelate went mute with surprise. \"Well now,\" Nathan finally said as he scratched under his jaw with one finger, \"that certainly is serious.\" He gestured up the hall. \"Where are you headed?\" \"Cara and I need to go out to see how Jagang's ramp is progressing. I also want to have a look at the Order's army and see if I can tell how they're doing. I'm hoping that Richard's plan will work, that the D'Haran troops sent to the Old World will be able to cut the supply lines. If they succeed, Jagang is going to have a problem. If all those men down there can't be supplied, they can't sit there all winter. They'll starve. I think it may turn out to be a race between the ramp and their supplies running out.\" Nathan nodded as he stepped past Nicci and Cara. \"Come on, then. We'll go with you and you can tell us about your encounter with this witch woman.\" Nicci stood her ground, not following after the prophet. \"She took the box of Orden.\" Nathan turned back and stared at her. \"What?\" \"She stole the box of Orden we had. The one that the witch woman's companion, Samuel, stole from Sister Tovi and that Rachel had then managed to get ahold of and bring to us. We thought it was safe in the Keep.

Nathan and Ann could not have looked more stunned. \"She did what?\" Nathan whispered, seemingly unable to stop staring at Cara, as if hoping he might have heard her wrong or, if he hadn't, that she might think better of what she'd said and recant the claim. \"Nicci put the power of Orden in play,\" Cara said. Nicci thought that the Mord-Sith sounded a bit proud of the accomplishment, proud of Nicci. \"Are you out of your mind!\" Ann roared as she rounded on Nicci, her face going scarlet. \"You named yourself a player for the power of Orden!\" \"No, that's not at all what happened,\" Cara said, once more drawing the attention of the prophet and the former prelate. \"She named Richard the player.\" Cara smiled just the slightest bit, as if pleased to prove that Nicci was better than Nathan and Ann seemed to think. For their part, Nathan and Ann stood thunderstruck. While it had indeed been quite an accomplishment, Nicci didn't feel any pride for having done such a thing-she had been driven to it out of desperation.

Besides the recent events, exhaustion was beginning to take its toll. There was so much to do and so little time. Worse, only she had the necessary knowledge or ability to deal with many of the problems they faced. Who but she had a chance to teach Richard about the use of Subtractive Magic that was necessary to open the boxes of Orden? There was no one else. Nicci felt the terrible weight of that responsibility. There were moments when the enormity of the battles facing them stood out for her in stark clarity. Sometimes when that happened Nicci's courage wavered. She sometimes feared that she was deluding herself that they could actually solve the monumental problems they faced. She remembered how, as a little girl, her mother had forced her to go out with bread to feed the poor and, later, how Brother Narev of the Fellowship of Order had shamed her into working tirelessly to serve the endless needs of people. No matter how much effort she put into solving the problems of all those who were needy, their problems only seemed to grow, outpacing her ability to satisfy them, binding her ever tighter in slavery to the growing ranks of those in need. She was taught that, because she had the ability, it was her duty to ignore her own wants and needs and to sacrifice her life to the wants and needs of others. Their inability, or unwillingness to try, made them her masters.

In those dark moments of self-doubt she wondered if she could ever really shed the mantle Jagang himself had laid around her shoulders when he named her the Slave Queen. He'd had no idea how apt the title really was. In a way, that was how she sometimes felt in this struggle. While she knew that this cause was right, it still seemed hopeless to think that they could win when they were up against so many who sought to crush them. Sometimes, in the face of the seemingly insurmountable, Nicci wanted nothing so much as to sit down and give up. In private moments in the past, Richard had confessed to having the same self-doubts as she felt, and yet she'd seen how he still forged ahead. Whenever Nicci felt discouraged, she thought of Richard, of how relentless he was, and she once again made herself get to her feet if for no other reason than to make him proud of her. She believed in and fought for their cause, but that cause was crystallized in Richard. They needed him. She didn't know how they were ever going to find him or, if they did, how they would get him back. That was assuming he was still alive. Richard being dead, though, was a thought that she refused to contemplate and so she immediately shoved the very idea aside.

When I explained it all to him, explained why I had to do as I had done, and once he'd calmed down, he came to see that there truly is no other way.\" \"And who are you to decide such a thing?\" Ann demanded. Nicci chose not to rise to the insult and instead kept her voice, if not deferential, at least civil. \"You yourself said that Richard is the one who must lead us in this battle. You and Nathan have waited nearly five hundred years for Richard to be born and worked to make sure that he could lead us. You yourself saw to it that he had The Book of Counted Shadows so that he could fight this fight. You seem to have decided a great deal for him before I ever came along. \"The Sisters of the Dark have already put Orden in play. I hardly need to tell you what their goal is. That makes this the final battle- the battle for life itself. Richard is the one who must lead us. If he is to succeed he must have the ability to fight them. You gave him a mere book. I gave him the power, the weapon, that he needs to win.\" Nathan laid a big hand on Ann's shoulder. \"Perhaps Nicci has a point.\" Ann glanced up at the prophet.

They hope to be able to help Richard by finding a way to eliminate whatever spell is barring him from his gift.\" \"You make it sound simple,\" Nathan said as he considered the problem. \"Such a thing will be far from simple.\" Nicci lifted an eyebrow. \"I doubt that standing around wishing for a solution will work better.\" Nathan grunted his agreement. \"What about the Keep?\" Nicci turned and started down the hall, talking back over her shoulder. \"'After Cara and I left in the sliph, and before he started out for Tamarang, Zedd was going to use a spell to close down the Keep.\" \"What about the others-Chase, Rachel, and Jebra?\" Nathan asked. \"Jebra vanished a while back.

Chase went looking for her.\" Nathan shook his head in frustration. \"I hate being stuck here when so much is going on.\" \"Zedd wanted you two to know about the trouble with the magic of the Keep,\" Nicci said. \"He said that there are defenses protecting the People's Palace that may be similar to those at the Keep, so he wants you to be aware of the problem. There's no telling how the contamination from the chimes will affect magic, whether it will hamper all similar power, or whether it's a function of location-if the contamination might be confined to a specific area.\" \"After we're finished here,\" Cara put in, \"Nicci and I are going to travel in the sliph down to the Tamarang area to help Zedd get Lord Rahl's power back. Then we're going after Lord Rahl.\" Nathan didn't object that he presently held the title of Lord Rahl. He, of all people, knew that Richard was the one that prophecy had named to lead them. Nathan was the one, after all, who had originally revealed that prophecy said they stood a chance against the coming storm only if Richard led them. Cara's plan that they were \"going after Lord Rahl\" was news to Nicci. If they knew where Richard was, Nicci would already be headed there.

As Nathan pulled the door open for them, cold air rushed in. A bloodred sky greeted Nicci as she stepped out onto a platform high above the rampart of the outer wall. \"Dear spirits,\" she whispered to herself. \"Every time I see them it's a terrible shock.\" Nathan squeezed out beside her. There was room for only two people on what was apparently an observation platform. Ann and Cara watched from just inside the doorway. The height was dizzying. Nicci gripped the waist-high iron railing as she leaned out a little, peering over the side. She could see over the edge of the outer wall, and the plateau itself, all the way down to the Azrith Plain. The ground immediately around the plateau was deserted. The Imperial Order had camped some distance back, apparently not wanting to chance drawing any unpleasant attention from the gifted up in the palace before absolutely necessary. While the Imperial Order had Sisters and even several young wizards who could shield them from any conjuring from above, Jagang would want to keep them in reserve, keep them healthy, strong, and alive until he began his final attack. A thick red overcast hung above the distant plain black with the invading army. They spread all the way to the horizon in every direction. Nicci rubbed her shoulders with the chill she felt from within. While from this distance it was hard to see much detail, she knew what it was like to be among such men. She knew all too well what they were like. She knew all too well what their officers file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (250 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 were like. She knew all too well what their leader was like. It made Nicci's skin crawl to think of being down among those men. When she had served with that army she had not given a great deal of thought to how not only physically filthy but spiritually squalid it was. As the Slave Queen she had been willfully blind to it. She had believed that brutes like Jagang and his men were necessary in order to impose higher ideals on mankind. Benevolence enforced through brutality. Looking back on such a thought, she could hardly believe how contradictory those convictions really were, and that she had accepted them without question. Not just accepted them, but helped enforce them. She had been so effective at enforcing the Order's will that she had become known as Death's Mistress. She could hardly believe that Richard had put up with her. Of course, she had given him no choice in the matter. She felt tears sting at her eyes at the memory of all the times she had tried to force Richard to join her in service to their vile cause and how, instead, he had shown her something noble. She swallowed back a sob at how much she missed him, missed the light in his eyes. The sight below made the silence up on the platform seem all the more bleak. These men, these millions of men spread out across the plain, were all there for one purpose: to kill everyone in the People's Palace, anyone who opposed the rule of the Order. This was their last obstacle to imposing their beliefs on all of mankind. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (251 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci stared out at the ramp rising up in the distance. It was larger than the last time she'd seen it. Beyond the ramp she could just make out scars in the ground where the material for the ramp was being dug. The top slope of the ramp aimed in a straight line right for the top of the plateau. Even though it was getting dark, there were snaking lines of men carrying dirt and rock to the construction site. If anyone described such an undertaking to her she doubted that she would believe it was possible, but seeing it was different. Seeing it filled her with dread. It was only a matter of time until that ramp was completed and the dark sea of the Imperial Order flooded up it to assault the palace. Standing at the edge of the platform, hugging her shoulders tightly, she knew that she was looking out onto more than a dark army. Nicci knew that she was looking out on a thousand years of darkness. Having been a Sister of the Dark, and having been raised under the teachings of the Fellowship of Order, she knew, perhaps better than anyone, just how real the threat was. She knew how vehemently the followers of the Order believed in their cause. Their faith defined them. They were more than willing to die for it. After all, death was their goal; they had been promised glory in the afterlife. They believed that this life was only a test, a means to gain entry into everlasting life.

Nicci folded her arms and glanced over at the prophet. \"What's that, Nathan?\" \"We've been studying books of prophecy here at the People's Palace. Just like all the books of prophecy everywhere else, the Chainfire spell has caused sections of these books, sections that apparently touch on Kahlan, to vanish. But there is still useful information as of yet untouched by Chainfire. Some of those books are new to me. They've helped me to connect things I've read about in the past. They've helped me to see the larger picture.\" With the Chainfire spell having erased so much of their memories, she didn't know how he could know if he really was seeing the larger picture-or how she could know if she was. Instead of saying so, Nicci waited silently, the cold wind ruffling her hair, watching Nathan look away to gaze out at the forces spread out across the Azrith Plain below. \"There is a place in the prophecies, a cardinal root, that leads to a determinative fork,\" he said at last. \"Beyond that fork, down one of its two branches, is a place the prophecies call the Great Void. \" Nicci frowned into her recollections. There had always been a great deal of speculation surrounding that portion of prophecy. \"I've heard mention of it,\" she said. \"Do you finally know what that file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (253 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 means?\" \"One of the two branches after that crucial fork leads to areas of yet more branches, offshoots, and forks farther on.\" Nathan flicked his wrist offhandedly, as if indicating those things unseen to anyone but him. \"There are a few books of prophecy that I've been able to identify as having to do with issues that lie beyond on that branch. I'm sure that a concerted search would reveal others. So, you might say that down that fork lies the world as we know it.\" He tapped the palm of one hand on the railing as he gathered his thoughts. \"On the other branch of that mantic root lies only the Great Void. There are no books of prophecy for what lies beyond. That is the reason it is called the Great Void. You might say that there is nothing on that branch for prophecy to see-no magic, no world as we know it, and thus no prophecy to illuminate it!\" He cast her a brief glance. \"That is the world the Imperial Order wants. If they take us down that fork, mankind will go forever into the unknown of the Great Void, a place without magic and thus without prophecy. \"Some of my predecessors have speculated that since there is no prophecy for what lies beyond, it could only mean that the Great Void augurs the end of everything, the end of all life.\" Nicci could find no words. She didn't think that there could be anything but darkness if the Order won, so this news wasn't really all that surprising to her. \"From the books here that I have been studying, from the information they have given me-and from recent events-I have file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (254 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 been able to fix us on the chronology of this prophetic root.\" Nicci's gaze darted to the wizard. \"Are you sure?\" Nathan held a hand out toward the army below. \"Jagang's army being here as they are, surrounding us, is one of a number of events that tells me that we are now on the cardinal root that takes us toward that fateful fork. \"I've known for centuries about the Great Void being in prophecy, but I didn't know if it was significant because I was never sure precisely where it fit in the chronology of prophecy. As far as I knew it was always possible that we might end up following an altogether different arm of the tree of prophecy, never setting foot in the area containing that particular cardinal root with the Great Void. \"There was always the possibility that the Great Void would turn out to be somewhere beyond any one of hundreds of false forks, down a dead branch on the tree of prophecy. Ages ago, when I first started studying it, it had seemed to me that it would turn out to be nothing more than false prophecy, eventually to be left in the forgotten dust of history along with so much of the other dead wood of the possible things that never came to pass. \"Slowly, though, events have inexorably carried us to where we find ourselves today. I am now sure that we are on that trunk of prophecy, on that particular branch, on that cardinal root, about to encounter the determinative fork. \"You,\" Nathan said to Nicci, \"have irrevocably placed us there by putting the power of Orden in play in Richard's name.

He turned back to Nicci, laying a hand on her shoulder. \"Do you understand the significance of what I'm telling you?\" \"Nathan, I may not know everything that prophecy has had to say about it, but I certainly know what is at stake. The boxes of Orden were put into play by Sisters of the Dark, after all. I hardly see any outcome should they win except for the end of everything good. As far as I can see, Richard is the only one who has a chance to stop that from happening.\" \"Quite so,\" Nathan said with a sigh. \"This is why Ann and I have been waiting five hundred years for Richard to come into the world. He was the one meant to navigate the forks that would successfully carry us through a dangerous tangle of shrouded knots within prophecy.

She suddenly understood. \"That's where you made the mistake, before,\" she said, half to herself. Ann leaned through the doorway a little, her eyes narrowing. \"What?\" \"You were tracing the wrong root in prophecy,\" Nicci said, even as parts of the puzzle were still falling into place in her own mind. \"You were aware of the importance of the boxes of Orden, but your chronology was jumbled and as a result you ended up tracing a false fork. You mistakenly thought that it was Darken Rahl who, by using the boxes of Orden, created the terminal node. You thought it was Darken Rahl who would lead us into the Great Void.\" Understanding the gravity of the mistake, Nicci turned to stare at the former prelate. \"You thought that you had to prepare Richard to deal with that threat, thinking it was this fork of prophecy-the one we find ourselves on right now-so you stole The Book of Counted Shadows and gave it to George Cypher, meaning it for Richard when he got older. You :hought Darken Rahl was the final battle, the terminal node in prophecy. You wanted Richard to fight Darken Rahl.

Because of you, the Sisters of the Dark were at last able to get their hands on the boxes of Orden. Because of you, the Keeper of the underworld has them to do his bidding. Without what you did, none of that would have been possible.\" Nicci blinked at the former prelate as the magnitude of what they had done sank in. The realization gave her goose bumps. \"You inadvertently caused all of this. You tried to use prophecy to avert a disaster and instead you only served to fulfill prophecy. Your decision to interfere is what made the disaster possible.\" Ann's face twisted with a sour expression. \"While it would seem that we-\" \"All that work, all that planning, all that waiting for centuries, and you messed it up.\" Nicci pulled wind-whipped hair back from her face. \"Turns out I was the one prophecy needed-because of what you would do.\" Nathan cleared his throat. \"Well, that's a pretty big-and somewhat misleading-oversimplification, but I must admit that it's not entirely untrue.\" Nicci suddenly saw the Prelate, a woman she had always thought of as next to infallible, a woman always ready to point out the tiniest mistakes made by others, in a new light. \"You made a file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (258 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 mistake.

After all, here you stand, a woman who fought your whole life for the beliefs of the Order, only to give yourself over to becoming a Sister of the Dark. Shall I invalidate everything you now say and do because you've made mistakes in the past? Do you wish to invalidate everything we've learned and have been able to accomplish on the grounds that there have been times when we've made mistakes? \"It could even be that our mistakes were not really mistakes, but rather a tool of prophecy, a part of a larger design, because all along you were the one meant to be close enough to Richard to help him. Perhaps the things we did are what allowed you to get close enough to him to play such a vital role, a role that only you would be able to play.\" \"Free will is a variable in prophecy,\" Ann said. \"Without it, without all that happened because of the events that Richard tumbled into place, where would you be?

Where would you be had you never met Richard?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (259 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci didn't want to consider such a possibility. \"How many more, like you, in the end might be saved because events turned out this way,\" the Prelate added, \"rather than if none of this had ever happened?\" \"It could very well be,\" Nathan said, \"that, had we not done the things we did, for reasons right or wrong, prophecy would simply have found another way to accomplish the very same results. It's likely, by the way these roots intertwine, that what is happening right now, one way or another, had to happen.\" \"Like water finding a route to lower ground?\" Cara asked. \"Precisely,\" Nathan said, smiling proudly at her power of observation. \"Prophecy is to a degree self-healing. We may think we understand the details, but in fact we may be unable to see the totality of events on a grander scale, so that when we take it upon ourselves to interfere prophecy must find other roots to nourish the tree, lest it die. \"In some ways, since prophecy can be self-healing, any attempt to influence events is ultimately futile. And yet, at the same time, prophecy is intended to be used, intended to spur action, otherwise what would be its purpose? Any intervention in events, though, is a dangerous thing to do. The trick is knowing when and where to act. It's an imprecise discipline, even for a prophet.\" \"Perhaps because we are so painfully aware of our own well- intentioned mistakes,\" Ann said, \"you can see why we would be so distraught that you would take it upon yourself to make such a choice for Richard-a central figure in prophecy-as to name him a file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (260 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 player for the power of Orden.

The boxes of Orden are a determinative node, just about as far from a minor element within prophecy as one can get.\" Nicci hadn't meant it the way it had come out. She never thought of herself as free of fault-quite the opposite. Her whole life she had felt inferior, if not outright evil. Her mother, Brother Narev, and later Emperor Jagang had always told her as much, constantly driving into her how inadequate she was. It was just that it had been surprising to learn that the Prelate could be so . . . human. Nicci's gaze fell away. \"I didn't mean it the way it sounded. I just never thought you made mistakes.\" \"While I do not agree with your characterization of events that have spanned five centuries and countless years of toil and effort,\" Ann said, \"I'm afraid that we all make mistakes. One of the things that defines our character is how we handle our mistakes. If we lie about having made a mistake, then it can't be corrected and it festers. On the other hand, if we give up just because we made a mistake, even a big mistake, none of us would get far in life. \"As to your version of our interaction with prophecy, there are many factors you've not taken into account, to say nothing of those elements of which you are ignorant. You are connecting events in ways that are simplistic, if not entirely inaccurate.

That makes no sense-by prophecy's own admission, part of the prophecy in question is missing.\" Ann pursed her lips. \"Now even Mord-Sith have become experts on prophecy?\" Nathan looked back over his shoulder at Cara. \"It's not so easy to understand the context of events as they relate to prophecy. Prophecy and free will, you see, exist in tension, in opposition. Yet, they interact. Prophecy is magic and all magic needs balance. The balance to prophecy, the balance that allows prophecy to exist, is free will.\" \"Oh, that makes a lot of sense,\" Cara sniped from the doorway. \"If what you're saying is true, that would mean that they cancel each other out.\" The prophet held up a finger. \"Ah, but they don't. They are interdependent and yet they are antithetical. Just as Additive and Subtractive Magic are opposite forces, they both exist. They each serve to balance the other.

No, it defines it, and in so doing creates its value.\" Cara didn't look at all convinced. \"I don't see how free will can even manage to exist within prophecy.\" Nathan shrugged. \"Richard is a perfect example. He ignores prophecy and balances it at the same time.\" \"He ignores me, too, and when he does he always gets in trouble.\" \"We have something in common,\" Ann said. Cara let out a sigh. \"Well anyway, Nicci got it right. And I don't think it was prophecy, but her free will that brought her to do the reasoned thing. That's why Lord Rahl trusts her.\" \"I don't disagree,\" Nathan said with a shrug. \"As nervous as it makes me, we sometimes must let Richard do as he thinks best. Perhaps that is ultimately what Nicci has done-given him the tools to have the freedom to truly exercise his free will.\" Nicci wasn't really listening anymore. Her mind was elsewhere. She abruptly turned to Nathan. \"I need to see Panis Rahl's tomb. I think I know why it's melting.\" From in the distance, a rumbling roar rolled up through the gathering gloom, drawing their attention.

It satisfies the blood lust of his soldiers.\" Nicci remembered Jagang's devotion to Ja'La. He was a man who understood how to control and direct the emotions of his people. He distracted them from the daily misery of their lives by continually blaming every common trouble they faced on those who refused to put their faith in the Order, the latest of those being the heathens to the north. That distraction kept the people from questioning the teachings of the Order, since all their troubles were blamed on those who questioned. Nicci knew, because she did that very thing herself as Death's Mistress. Any suffering was blamed on those who were selfish. Anyone who questioned was attacked as selfish. Jagang won widespread passion for war by building hatred for an imagined oppressor that was condemned for causing every problem the people lived with daily. Personal responsibility was abandoned to the disease of assigning fault for all hardships, and every hardship was blamed on the greedy who failed to do their part. In that way, their daily problems were a constant reminder of the enemy who they believed caused those problems.

The distraction of blaming others for the people's misery came full circle, being the means to turn attention elsewhere, and to let the people themselves demand of him that he go off to fight this battle against evil. Who could complain about the cost and sacrifice of a war they themselves demanded? Ja'La, too, was a distraction that served his ends. In the cities the somewhat more civilized games were a focal point that funneled the emotions and energy of the populace into rather meaningless events. It helped give his people a common cause to rally around, to cheer for, promoting a mentality that steeped people in the concept of being joined in opposition to others. In his army, Ja'La served to distract his men from the misery of service in the army. Since the audience of soldiers was made up of aggressive young men, those games were played under a more brutal set of rules. The violence of such games gave frustrated, combative, hostile men an outlet for their pent-up passions. Without Ja'La, Jagang understood that he might not be able to maintain discipline and control over such a vast and unwieldy force. Without Ja'La they might turn their idle hostility inward, among themselves. Jagang had his own team, which served to demonstrate the indomitable supremacy of the emperor. They were an extension of his power and might, an object of awe. They reflected that awe onto the emperor. His Ja'La team connected the emperor to his men, made him like them, while at the same time stressing his superiority. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (265 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Having spent so much time with him, as his Slave Queen, Nicci knew that despite all of those calculated factors, Jagang, like his men, had actually become caught up in the game.

Since assembling his new team of unbeatable men, a team universally feared, he had come to feel that he, personally, was the master of Ja'La dh Jin. It had become more than a game to Jagang. It had become an extension of his persona. Nicci turned away from the sight of the Imperial Order forces gathered below. She could no longer endure the sight, or the thought of the bloody games she so hated. The muffled roars washed over her, a building blood lust that would eventually be turned loose on the People's Palace. Once back inside, Nicci waited until Nathan pushed the heavy door closed against the cold night descending on the outside world. \"I need to go down to see Panis Rahl's tomb.\" He looked back over his shoulder as he forced the latch into place. \"So you said.

When Cara didn't look at all nclined to agree to the plan, Ann hastily added, \"For when Richard gets back. They want to be certain that everything is being done to insure his security when he returns to the palace.\" Nicci thought that there were few people as wary as a Mord-Sith. They seemed to be constantly suspicious and to assume the worst. Nicci could :ell that Ann simply wanted to speak with her alone. She didn't know why -he didn't just tell Cara that. She guessed that Ann probably wasn't convinced that such an approach would work. Nicci placed a hand on the small of Cara's back and leaned toward her. \"It's all right, Cara.

It was an intimate gaze warmed by a childlike smile, a look of shared understanding and affection. Nicci almost felt embarrassed to be witness to such a private moment. At the same time, it revealed a quality of both Ann and Nathan that she found captivating. It was the kind of simple thing that almost anyone who saw it would understand and appreciate. The brief glimpse into their feelings gave Nicci a sense of comfort and peace. This was not just the prelate she had feared for so much of her life, but a woman who shared the same feelings, longings, and values as most anyone. As they made their way back along the hallway while Nathan and Cara vanished down a stairwell, Nicci glanced over at Ann. \"You love him, don't you?\" Ann smiled. \"Yes.\" Nicci stared, unable to think of what to say. \"Surprised that I would admit it?\" Ann asked. \"Yes,\" Nicci confessed. Ann chuckled. \"Well, I guess there would have been a time when I would have been surprised as well.\" Nicci loosely intertwined her fingers. \"When did all this happen?\" Ann stared off into memories. \"Probably centuries ago.

The railing all the way down was vinelike wrought iron, held in place by masterfully worked iron made to mimic leafy branches. \"Well,\" Ann sighed, \"I guess that I, too, was shocked to find out that I was human. At the same time, at first anyway, it made me quite sad.\" \"Sad?\" Nicci frowned. \"Why?\" \"Because I had to admit to myself that I had thrown away most of my life. I've been blessed by the Creator with a very long life, but I realized only as I approach the end of it that I had lived very little of that life.\" She looked up at Nicci as they reached a landing. \"Doesn't it make you feel remorse to realize how much of your life you wasted without ever realizing what was really important about that life?\" Nicci swallowed back a pang of regret of her own as they reached the edge of a landing and started down the next flight of stairs. \"We have that in common.\" Together they listened in silence to the whisper of their footsteps as they made their way down the rest of the stairs.

The hallway carried the spiced scent from the evenly spaced oil lamps. Cherrywood squares paneled the walls to each side, each panel separated by straw-colored draperies spaced at uniform intervals. Each set of draperies was swagged with a golden rope terminated with gold and black tassels. The reflector lamps hung in every other opening between the drapes lent the hall a warm glow. In every other warmly paneled square hung a painting. Most were ornately framed, as if the works of art were beloved. Each painting had a panel to itself. While the subject matter varied greatly, from a late-day mountain scene beside a lake, to a barnyard scene, to a towering waterfall, the thing that all the paintings had in common was an achingly beautiful use of light. The mountain lake sat between soaring mountains with light from beyond hazy mountains breaking through billowing, golden clouds. A shaft of that glorious light spilled across the shoreline. The forest all around fell back into a cozy darkness, while in the center, the distant couple standing on a rocky prominence were bathed in the warmth of the shaft of light. In the barnyard scene the chickens scratched on stone pavers littered with straw and lit by an unseen source of muted light that, without the harsh touch of direct sunlight, made the whole painting all the more vibrant. Nicci had never before thought of a barnyard as beautiful, but this artist had seen the beauty in it, and brought it forth. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (270 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 In the foreground of the painting with the towering waterfall spilling over a distant, lofty ridgeline, the arch of a natural stone bridge emerged from dark woods to either side. A couple faced each other across that bridge, backlit by the setting sun, which had turned the majestic mountains a deep purple. Standing in that light the two people had a nobility about them that was transfixing. Nicci found it interesting to note that so much about the People's Palace was devoted to beauty. From the design of the interior, to the variety of stones used for the floors, stairs, and pillars, to the statues and artwork, the place seemed to be filled with a celebration of the beauty of life. Everything from the structure of the palace itself to its contents seemed intent on displaying the highest accomplishments of man. It was almost a setting dedicated to virtuosity meant to inspire. What was perhaps even more intriguing was that these masterful paintings would be seen by few people. This was a private corridor, down in the depths of the palace on the way to the tombs of past leaders. It would be used almost exclusively by the Lord Rahl. Some might see it as a display of greed, a private show of possessions, but that would be a mistake born of cynicism. Nicci knew that different sorts of men had been the Lord Rahl.

Nicci supposed that all that could be hoped for was for each generation to be raised to be sensible enough to learn from the past, not to lose sight of the things that mattered, and to understand why they mattered. Still, every person had to make choices for themselves. Those who lost sight of the values fought for and won in the past usually came to lose those values, leaving subsequent generations to have to fight to win them back, only for them to be squandered by their heirs, who didn't have to face the struggle to gain them. Nicci saw the paintings along this long walk to visit the dead as messages from past generations meant to remind the latest to become Lord Rahl of the value of life. As he went to visit tombs of those passed away, :his hall was intended to remind him where his attention belonged. In a way, this was the Lord Rahl's reminder of his proper duty: to life. Many who had taken this long walk had lost sight of that, and in so doing, generations of people also lost what their ancestors had enjoyed, and they had taken for granted. That was why the entire palace was created in the form of a spell to give the House of Rahl more power, and why the place was so filled with beauty-to remind him of what was important, and give him the power to keep hold of it for his people.

Torches in iron brackets spaced evenly along the walls cast the solemn corridor in a flickering light. The dead air carried the heavy smell of pitch and a pale haze of acrid smoke. At varying places along the passageway were other halls leading off to tombs. \"It's a dangerous time we are in,\" Ann said, the sounds of their footsteps echoing off the stone. \"We approach the most dangerous place in prophecy that I know of.

She hoped that Ann truly did understand, and that this was not just another strategy, another way to wield her influence over events. Maybe Nathan had actually changed her, as Ann had suggested. To Nicci, it felt sincere. It also felt like this had been a conversation with Ann that she had been waiting her whole life to have. \"Which reminds me,\" Ann said, \"in regard to Nathan and the terrible thing I had intended for him just before he helped me come to my senses.

CHAPTER20 Having been in countless deadly confrontations, Nicci knew that running right then Would be a fatal mistake. Instead, she fell back on instinct and lifted a hand over Ann's shoulder, summoning every bit of dark power she possessed. Nicci fully committed herself to visiting unrestrained violence upon the three women down the hall.

Dark ropes of inky blackness tangled with the flare of lightning, creating a snarling mix that cracked and popped where it touched. Sparks flew. The air burned. So black was the Subtractive element that it seemed like a void in existence. In effect, it was. Marble covering the floor, ceiling, and walls ripped open in ragged rifts at the contact. Stone chips shot through the hall, ricocheting everywhere. Marble dust billowed as the air itself convulsed with the violence of the discharge of power. The concussion snuffed the light of several of the closer torches. Despite her power being so diminished that the commitment of force failed, in that instant of connecting with her Han, Nicci still had enough use of her gift to feel the familiar shift in her perception of time. Her arms and legs felt like lead. The world, within the tunnel of her vision, seemed to slow almost to a stop. She could see every bit of stone tumbling as it flew toward her through the smoky passageway. She would have had ample time to have counted them all while suspended in midair. She could see each chip, flake, and speck rotating as it flew.

The air itself sizzled. As the rope of liquid light twisted unchecked across the passageway, Ann dove in front of Nicci. Nicci knew all too well what was coming. She knew the nature of the three woman facing them. She knew the sort of lethal power they had invoked. With no time to scream a command, Nicci instead stretched out to grab the Prelate and throw her down out of harm's way. She caught the gray dress. Her fingers started the ever so slow labor of closing. It was a race between getting a firm grip and the flickering lightning that seemed to be raging out of control. But Nicci knew that it wasn't really out of control. The crackling discharge of power jumped sideways and slammed squarely into the short woman. The blinding flash ripped right through her, coming out her back. The impact was of such power that it yanked the Prelate from Nicci's tenuous grasp. Ann's squat body crashed into the wall with enough force to crack the marble slab. Such an impact would certainly have broken nearly every bone in her body. Nicci could see, though, that Annalina Aldurren had been dead before she'd hit the wall. The lightning abruptly cut off. The clap of thunder left Nicci's ears ringing.

A pool of blood grew under her, flooding across the white marble. The three woman down the hall, like three vultures perched on a dead limb, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, watching Nicci. Nicci knew how they had just accomplished what she could not: they had linked their power. She herself, when they had first been captured by Jagang, had linked her ability with Sisters of the Dark. The three of them had acted as one and by that means had just managed to use their power inside the palace. What Nicci didn't know was how they had gotten in. She expected that at any second the lightning would again ignite and she would suffer the same fate as Ann. There had been a time when she hadn't cared one way or the other if she died. Now she cared. She cared greatly. She regretted that she would not have the opportunity to fight back before the end. At least it would be swift. Sister Armina smiled a wicked smile. \"Nicci, dear. How good to see you again.\" \"Bad company you keep,\" said Sister Julia, standing close on Sister Armina's right. A stocky Sister Greta, close on her left, glared. All three were Sisters of the Dark. Sister Armina had been free of Jagang, along with Ulicia, Cecilia, and Tovi.

She bolted in the opposite direction-back toward the stairs. She hadn't gone three steps when a rope of compacted air whipped around, sweeping her feet out from under her. She smacked the floor hard. Her shield had proven useless against the power of those three linked. She was somewhat startled that they had not used the same kind of deadly power that they had on Ann. Not waiting to contemplate why, or for what might follow, Nicci rolled to the left and then scrambled to her feet. She dove through an opening into another hallway. Behind, she could hear the three Sisters running toward her. With simple, empty halls made of smooth marble, there was no place to hide. Nicci knew that if she ran they would simply ignite a bolt of power to take her down. She had no real chance to outrun them and escape the reach of their power. But, since they were already running after her, they would probably be expecting her to run, so Nicci instead pressed her back up against the wall just around the corner of the next intersection, on the side closest to the three coming for her.

It was hard to believe that Ann was dead. She had been witness to the rise and fall of kingdoms and the passing of countless generations over a vast march of time. It seemed she had been alive forever. It was numbing to try to imagine a world without Annalina Aldurren. Although the Prelate had not been beloved by Nicci, she still felt a pang of grief for her. The woman had finally seemed to come to terms with some of her mistakes. After all this time, after such a long life, she had finally come to have real love in her life. As Nicci heard the footsteps rushing close she gathered her wits. This was no time to grieve. Nicci was hardly a stranger to violence and death, but she was not at all used to this manner of combat. As Death's Mistress she had been witness to thousands of deaths, and had killed more people than she could count or recall, but she had never done it with her bare hands. Now, without her power, that was her only option. She tried to think of how Richard would do such a thing. As the three Sisters charged around the corner, Nicci used all her strength to ram her elbow into the face of the closest woman. She heard teeth snap. Her heart was pumping so fast she didn't even feel the blow in her elbow. Sister Julia was knocked sprawling on her back.

She screamed curses as she struggled to get free. Nicci pulled her back, while she had the initiative, lifting her by the hair in order to get another swing to bash her face against the wall. Before she could accomplish the task, the stout Sister Greta crashed into Nicci's middle, knocking her to the side, off Sister Armina. The flying weight of the Sister whacked Nicci against the wall with enough force to knock the wind out of her. She blindly clawed at the woman tackling her, trying to get her off. Sister Greta, holding Nicci tightly around the middle, twisted to the side, easily throwing her face-first to the ground. Nicci flipped over to kick Sister Greta away. Sister Armina, blood running down her face, planted a boot on Nicci's chest. Sister Greta rose up next to her, catching her breath. Before Nicci could struggle to get up, a jolt of pain seared up through her body, exploding at the base of her skull. The shock of it drove the air from her lungs. The two of them joining their gift was enough to incapacitate Nicci. \"Not a very gracious way to greet your Sisters,\" Sister Greta said. Nicci tried to ignore the pain. Her arms flailed as she tried to get up, but Sister Armina put more weight on her foot and at the same time expanded the sharp barbs of pain. Nicci's vision blurred down file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (307 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 to a small spot at the center of a dark tunnel of blackness, her back arched as her muscles convulsed into knots. Her fingers clawed at the floor. She thought that she might do anything to make it stop. \"I suggest that you stay where you are,\" Sister Armina said, \"or, if you prefer, we'll remind you just how much more agony we can deliver.\" She arched an eyebrow at Nicci. \"Hmm?\" Nicci couldn't speak. Tears of torment streaming from her eyes, she instead nodded. Sister Julia stumbled close, both hands held tightly over her mouth as she bawled in pain and anger. Blood hung in strings from her chin, covered the front of her faded blue dress, and dripped from her elbows. Sister Armina, her foot still on Nicci's chest, leaned down, resting an arm across her knee. In a voice only partly her own, she said, \"Returned to us at long last, darlin?\" Nicci's blood flashed icy cold. She realized that it was Jagang's gaze looking down at her. Had she not been in such agony, had it not been all she could do just to breath, she surely would have run, even if it would have meant sudden death. Sudden death would be preferable. Unable to run, she instead envisioned gouging out Sister Armina's eyes-Jagang's window. \"I'm going to kick your teeth in for this!\" Sister Julia said in a muffled voice from behind the hands clamped over her mouth. \"I'm going to-\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (308 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Shut up,\" Sister Armina said in that terrible voice only half her own, \"or I'll not allow them to heal you.\" Sister Julia's eyes flashed with terror at recognizing Jagang addressing her. She fell silent. Sister Armina held a hand out to her. \"Give it to me.\" Sister Julia slipped bloody fingers into a pocket and brought out something unexpected, something that made Nicci's breath catch with fright. Sister Julia handed it to Sister Armina. Sister Armina removed her foot and went down on one knee, leaning over a prostrated Nicci. Nicci knew what was coming. She struggled with all her might, all her panic, but she couldn't manage to make her body respond. Her muscles were locked rigid with the tingling power searing through her nerves. Sister Armina bent forward and forced the blood-slicked collar around Nicci's neck. Nicci felt the Rada'Han snap closed. In the same instant, she lost the link to her Han. She had been born with the gift. Most of the time she never gave it any thought. Now she was cut completely off from her ability. Like her eyesight or hearing, it had always been there, always been something she used without thought. Now there was only a terrifyingly unfamiliar void. Such an abrupt separation from her gift stunned her. To be without it was to be without a part of her, without the very core of her, of who she was, of what she was. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (309 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"On your feet,\" Sister Armina said. When the pain at last eased off, Nicci's whole body sagged against the floor. She didn't know if her muscles would work, or if she would have the strength to get up, but she knew Sister Armina well enough not to hesitate. She flopped over and pushed herself up onto her hands and knees. When she didn't move fast enough for Sister Armina, a stunning shock of pain slammed into the small of Nicci's back. She sucked back a scream. Her arms and legs shot out straight involuntarily and she dropped flat to the floor. Sister Greta chuckled. \"Get up,\" Sister Armina said, \"or I will show you some real pain.\" Nicci pushed herself up on her hands and knees again. She gasped, getting her breath. Tears dripped onto the dusty floor. Knowing better than to delay, she struggled to her feet. Her legs wobbled, but she managed to stay upright. \"Just kill me,\" Nicci said. \"I'm not going to cooperate, no matter how much you make it hurt.\" Sister Armina cocked her head, peering closely at Nicci with one eye. \"Oh, darlin, I think you're wrong about that.\" It was once again Jagang speaking. A blinding shimmer of agony, delivered by the collar around her neck, cascaded down through Nicci's core. The pain was so stunning that it dropped her to her knees. She had endured pain from Jagang before, when he had been able to enter her mind, before she learned how to stop him. It was her devotion to Richard-the bond-that had protected her just as it file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (310 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 protected those from D'Hara and those who followed the Lord Rahl. But before that, when he had been able to enter her mind, just as he could enter the minds of these Sisters, now, he had been able to make it feel like he was pushing thin iron spikes deep into Nicci's ears, then send the pain ripping downward through her insides. This was worse. She stared at the floor, fully expecting blood to run from her ears and nose and begin carpeting the stone. She blinked as she gasped in utter agony, but she saw no blood. She wished she did. If she bled enough she would die. She knew Jagang well enough, though, to know that he would not allow her to die. Not yet, anyway. The dream walker didn't like a swift death for people who angered him. Nicci knew that there was probably no one Jagang wanted to make suffer more than her. He would eventually kill her, of course, but he would extract his vengeance first. He would no doubt give her to his men for a time, just to humiliate her, then send her to the torture tents. That part of it, she knew, would last a very long time. When he eventually became bored with her suffering, she would spend her final days having her intestines pulled slowly out of a slit in her belly. He would want to be there to see her finally die, to make sure that the last thing she saw before the end was him smiling in triumph. The one thing that she regretted at that moment, in the realization of what was about to befall her, was that she would never see Richard again. She thought that if she could only see him one more file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (311 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 time she could endure what was to come. Sister Armina stepped closer, close enough to be sure that Nicci could see her superior smile. She was now in control of the collar around Nicci's neck. Jagang, too, could now dominate her through that connection as well. The Rada'Han was meant to control young wizards. It acted on the gift. Though the People's Palace diminished her gift-prevented the projection of power-it would not impede the collar, because the Rada'Han worked internally. The device could cause unimaginable pain-enough pain that a boy would do anything to make it stop. Nicci, on her knees, trembled as she gasped in agony. Her vision went darker and darker until she could hardly see anything. Her ears rang. \"Do you now fully understand what will happen should you disobey us?\" Sister Armina asked. Nicci couldn't answer. She had no voice. She managed a slight nod. Sister Armina leaned down. The blood had finally stopped running from her scalp. \"Then get to your feet, Sister.\" The pain finally lifted enough for Nicci to be able to stand. She didn't want to stand. She wanted them to kill her. Jagang was not going to allow that, though. Jagang wanted to get his hands on her. As her vision began to clear, she saw that Sister Greta was back across the hall, rummaging through Ann's pockets. She pulled something from a pocket hidden under Ann's belt. She looked it over and then held it up. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (312 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Guess what I found,\" she said, waving it for the other two to see. \"Should we take it?\" \"Yes,\" Sister Armina said, \"but be quick about it.\" Sister Greta shoved the small item in her pocket and returned to the other two. \"There's nothing else on her.\" Sister Armina nodded. \"We'd best be quick.\" The three stood shoulder to shoulder, facing back down the hall toward Ann. Nicci could tell that, even with the link, they were still having difficulty using their power. Without the spell of the People's Palace draining their Han, any of the three of them, by herself, could have easily wielded the kind of power that had killed Ann. The air cracked with the ignition of Subtractive Magic. The hallways dimmed as several more torches were blown out by the blast. Inky darkness undulated through the passageway, back toward the Prelate, finally enveloping the dead woman. The hum of power made Nicci again momentarily lose her vision under the oppressive blanket of blackness. When her sight returned, Ann was gone. Even her blood was gone. Every trace of her existence had been wiped away by Subtractive Magic. It seemed impossible that nearly a thousand years of life could be gone in an instant. No one would ever know what had happened to her. While the body and the blood had been eliminated, the shattered marble was not so easily fixed. The Sisters didn't seem to care. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (313 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 To Nicci, it felt as if everything, even all hope, had just died. Sister Armina seized Nicci under the arm and shoved her down the passageway. Nicci stumbled but regained her footing before she fell. She walked woodenly ahead of the three, prodded to keep moving by sharp reminders the collar sent into her tender kidneys. They hadn't gone far before Nicci was directed to turn down a hallway to the left. She numbly followed their orders, making turns and taking several smaller passageways when told to until at the end of a lesser hallway they ended at an entrance to a tomb. Rather simple brass-clad doors stood closed. They weren't nearly as massive, or ornately decorated, as some of the others she'd seen when she'd visited the tomb of Richard's grandfather, Panis Rahl, located in a distant area. Nicci thought that it was odd to be going to a tomb. She wondered if the Sisters were intending to hide until they could think of a way to make good their escape from the heavily guarded palace. Since it was night, perhaps they intended to wait until a busier time of day so they wouldn't be as easily noticed. How they had gotten in, Nicci couldn't imagine. Each door was embossed with a simple circle-within-a-circle motif. Sister Greta pulled one door open and ushered the others in, Nicci in the lead. Inside, the Sisters used a spark of power to light a single torch. An ornately decorated coffin rested on a raised floor in the center of the small room. The walls above the height of the coffin were covered in stone of swirling browns and tans. Black granite that in the torchlight sparkled with copper flakes covered the lower file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (314 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 portion of the walls. It was an odd arrangement, almost making the upper portion, above coffin height, seem like the world of life, while the area below covered in black stone was reminiscent of the underworld. Cut into the upper, lighter stone were the primary invocations in High D'Haran. They ran in bands around the room. Nicci scanned the script, seeing that it appeared to be rather common appeals to the good spirits to welcome this Rahl leader into the ranks of the good spirits along with others who had come before him. It spoke of the man's life and the things he had done for his people. Nothing of any particular significance in the writing stood out to Nicci. It seemed to be the tomb of a Lord Rahl from the distant past who had served his people by ruling during a rather peaceful time in D'Haran history. The words called it a time of \"transition.\" Inscribed in the black granite covering the lower walls was a rather odd admonition to remember the foundation that made all that lay above them possible. That foundation, it said, had been laid by all the countless souls long forgotten. The coffin itself, made of smooth stone in a simple shape, was covered with inscriptions advising those who visited to keep in mind all those who had passed from this life and into the next. Sister Armina, surprisingly, put her weight against one end of the coffin. With a grunt of effort, she pushed, and the coffin moved a few inches, exposing a lever. She reached down into the narrow slot, grasped the lever, and pulled it up until it clicked into place. The coffin pivoted, making only a whisper of sound. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (315 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Once the coffin had turned aside, Nicci was surprised to see a dark opening. This was no tomb. It was a hidden entrance to whatever lay below. When Sister Julia shoved her, Nicci stepped forward onto the raised platform until she saw stairs, roughly hewn from rock, descending into darkness. Sister Greta stepped down into the opening. She lit one of a dozen torches stuck in a row of holes in the rough stone wall and then took it with her as she started down. Sister Julia went next, also taking a torch. \"Well,\" Sister Armina said, \"what are you waiting for? Get going.\" CHAPTER 21 Lifting the skirts of her black dress, Nicci stepped over the raised edge of the pedestal that hejd the coffin. She gripped the edge of the opening to steady herself as she started down the steep run of stairs. The first two Sisters were already making their way down. The wavering glow of their torches showed nothing but a nearly vertical shaft of steps. Once Sister Armina had climbed in after Nicci, she pushed a lever back into the wall, then took a torch for herself. Overhead, the coffin pivoted back into place, sealing them in. It looked to Nicci like they were about to descend into the underworld itself. The stairs wound downward haphazardly. The shaft was only wide enough for one person at a time. Descending at a steep angle, the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (316 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 steps turned at small landings only to continue tunneling downward in what seemed to be random directions. The stairs themselves had been crudely hewn; they were uneven and not all the same size, making the descent treacherous. It appeared that whoever had carved the stairs had followed softer veins in the rock whenever they were available. Such work resulted in a meandering, crooked route. The stairs dropped so sharply that Nicci found herself having to breathe the smoke of the two torches carried by the Sisters right under her. As her mind raced, trying to think out her options, she briefly gave consideration to throwing herself down the precipitous shaft in the hope that she could break her neck, maybe even taking the two below her down as well, but with as narrow as the opening was she expected that she would probably get wedged to a stop before falling far. The landings, too, were numerous, so while the stairs were steep they paused frequently to make turns. She • would probably only break an arm, not her neck. They climbed downward for what began to feel to Nicci like hours. Descending at such a steep angle made her thighs burn. By the way they labored to breathe, the three Sisters were feeling the strain as well. They clearly weren't up to the demanding effort and were tiring. While Nicci was getting tired as well, she wasn't having the trouble the others were. The Sisters had to pause a number of times to take brief rests. When they stopped, they would sit on a step, leaning back against the wall, panting as they caught their breath. They made Nicci stand. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (317 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 None of the three liked Nicci. As she had told Ann, she was different from the rest of the Sisters of the Dark. They'd always thought that they deserved eternal rewards. Nicci always thought that she deserved eternal punishment. It was a grim irony that only after she had finally realized the value of her life, would she have the punishment she'd thought she deserved-Jagang would see to that. When it seemed she could not make it down another flight, they came to a flat spot. At first, Nicci thought that it might only be another landing, but it turned out to be a level passageway. The way ahead burrowed in a wandering course in much the same way the stairs had, only it was flat. In places the tight tunnel was so low that they had to duck down under low hanging rock. The walls had been carved from that same rock, and were irregular, making it almost look like nothing so much as a cave. Some spots were a tight squeeze to get through. In the small places the choking smoke from the torches made Nicci's eyes burn. The narrow tunnel abruptly widened into a proper passageway easily wide enough for two people to walk side by side. The walls, rather than being hewn from bedrock, were made of blocks of stone. The ceiling, made of huge stone blocks spanning the width of the passageway, was low and blackened by soot from torches, but at least it wasn't so low that Nicci had to bend. Before long they began encountering intersections and halls to the sides. It quickly became apparent that there was a warren of passageways branching in every direction. As they passed bisecting intersections, the light of the torches briefly illuminated file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (318 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 long, dark halls. In some of the side openings, though, Nicci saw rooms with low niches carved into the walls to the sides. Her curiosity got the better of her. She glanced back over her shoulder at Sister Armina. \"What is this place?\" \"Catacombs.\" Nicci hadn't known that there were catacombs beneath the People's Palace. She wondered if anyone up above them knew-Nathan, Ann, Verna, the Mord-Sith. At the same time the question came to mind she knew the answer. No one knew. \"Well, what are we doing down here?\" Sister Julia turned back to give Nicci a bloody, toothless grin. \"You'll find out soon enough.\" Now that she knew what the place was, Nicci realized that what she had seen stacked in some of the rooms to the sides were bodies, bodies in the thousands, wrapped in burial shrouds and covered with dust over the dark, still, silent centuries. As they passed other tightly spaced rooms she began to see recesses in the walls that held not individual remains, but mounds of bones. The bones were stacked in staggering numbers, all fit neatly into the recesses, filling them completely. As the torchlight fell into rooms to each side, Nicci saw skulls stacked together from floor to ceiling. The orderly rows of skulls went as far back as the light penetrated. There was no telling how far those rooms of snugly stacked skulls ran into the darkness. Nicci found it appalling to contemplate all the individuals she was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (319 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 seeing. These had all once been living people who had been born, grown up, and lived lives probably filled with family and love. Now there were only bones to say that they had ever existed. Nicci swallowed at the frightening thought that she would soon end up as et another anonymous skull that someone might one day see and wonder about. Just as she didn't know anything about these people, what they dreamed, what they believed, what they loved, or even how they had looked in life, she would be nameless bones slowly crumbling to dust. She had such a short time ago been up among the beauty of the palace, among color and life. Now she found herself among nothing but dust and dirt and death, on her way to her own. The two Sisters in front lead them through a confusing series of intersections. Some of the passageways they took sloped downward. In several places they had to descend yet more flights of stairs to halls even deeper in the ground. Everywhere there were rooms filled with bones, some with skulls, some with other bones stacked neatly in every available space, all bearing silent witness to lives once lived. Some of the passageways they passed through were made of brick but most had been constructed of stone. By the varying sizes of stone and styles of construction it seemed like they were passing from one era to another, each age preferring a different method to add to the ever- growing catacombs for their dead. The next turn took them past a room with a different kind of entrance. Thick stone slabs that had closed off the cavern beyond had been slid aside. Nicci was surprised to see another Sister file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (320 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 standing guard there. Beyond, back inside, in the shadows, there were big Imperial Order guards. Judging by their size, the type of chain mail they wore, the leather straps crossing their chests, along with the tattoos back across their shaved heads, these were some of Jagang's most trusted, and skilled, soldiers. Back behind them Nicci saw that the low room was tightly packed with shelves holding countless books. Beyond, behind the rows in various places, the light from lamps revealed where people were searching through the volumes. Jagang had teams of scholars devoted to scouring caches of books for him. They were specially trained and knew the sorts of things Jagang was looking for. The place reminded Nicci of nothing so much as the catacombs down in Caska. That was where, with the help of Jillian, Richard had discovered the Chainfire book. Nicci realized that these catacombs as well were liable to have a number of rooms with books. \"You,\" Sister Armina said to one of the guards, \"come here.\" When the man came to a stop out in the hall and leaned on his lance, she gestured back the way they had come. \"Get some workmen together and-\" \"What kind of workmen?\" the man interrupted. Men like these were not intimidated by Sisters of the Dark-mere captives, slaves of the emperor. \"Men who know how to work with stone,\" she said, \"with marble slabs.

It was becoming increasingly obvious to the soldier that Sister Armina was operating under the direction of the emperor himself, so he nodded without objection as she went on. \"There is a place right near where we entered up top where the stone has been damaged. It's a small secondary network of halls. You will need to pull some of the undamaged slabs off the walls in the area with the damage and use them to block off that branch of halls. From the other side it needs to look like part of the wall of the main corridor. It needs to fool anyone who goes down that corridor into thinking there is not supposed to be an opening there. It needs to be done immediately.\" She tipped her head toward Nicci. \"Before anyone looking for her discovers the damage.\" \"Won't people who know the place realize that an intersection has been blocked off?\" \"Not if it looks seamless, if it looks like it's always been that way. It's \"he tomb area of the palace. The Lord Rahl uses it to visit his ancestors, but only if he ever wishes to do such a thing.

The Sister seemed indifferent to Nicci's explanation. She turned back to the soldier. \"See? It's mostly an unused area. But before anyone goes down there looking for her, and the woman we killed, it needs to be done. Work as swiftly as possible.\" The man smoothed a hand back over his bald, tattooed head. \"All right. But it seems a lot of work to hide some damage.\" He shrugged. \"After all, if they see it, they won't know why it's damaged. They'll probably think it's from before. There have been battles in the palace in the recent past.\" Sister Armina did not look pleased to have the man second-guess her. \"His Excellency does not want anyone up there to know that we've found a way in. This is of paramount importance to him. Would you like me to tell him that you suggest the work is not worth the effort and he should simply not worry?\" The man cleared his throat. \"No, of course not.\" \"Besides that, it will give us a place to assemble and prepare without anyone knowing that we are all right there, just on the other side of a thin veneer of marble.\" He dipped his head. \"I will see to it at once, Sister.\" Nicci felt sick.

The defending forces within the palace would be caught off guard. A jab of pain started Nicci moving again. Sister Armina guided her with that pain, rather than simply telling her where she needed to turn. They walked down endless corridors, all made of stone block and with barrel ceilings, that seemed to connect clusters of rooms and networks of corridors. As they rounded a corner, Nicci saw a knot of people in the distance lit by torches. As they got closer she saw a ladder ascending into darkness. She had long since understood where they had to be, and where they were going. Royal guards had massed around a place broken open in the barrel ceiling. These men were the elite. They knew their business. At the thought of what was up that ladder, Nicci feared her legs might give out. One of the royal guard, who obviously recognized Nicci, stepped aside, never taking his eyes off her. \"Start climbing,\" Sister Armina said.

The floor of the pit was a confusing maze of various elevations, apparently the result of different gangs of workers laboring to scoop up material for the ramp. Those workers were nowhere to be seen. It had to be that when they were digging in the area where she stood they had discovered the catacombs. While the laborers may have been long gone, there were now soldiers everywhere. The ones she saw weren't regular Imperial Order troops, who were little more than an organized mob of thugs. These were the professional soldiers, the experienced men closest to Jagang. These were the trusted core of men who had fought with him in various campaigns over the years. Because these were men who had always been closest to the emperor, Nicci recognized many of them.

In a movement dedicated to the greater good over individual rights, to ideals of absolute equality of all, he enjoyed making it clear that she was his personal possession. Like the common soldiers, not one of these men ever dared to touch her. Jagang had in the past, however, given her as a favor to some of his inner circle of officers, men such as Commander Kadar Kardeef. Many of these men had been there the day Nicci had ordered Kardeef burned to death. Some of them, at her command, had helped tie their commander to a stake and put him over the fire. Despite their reluctance, they dared not contradict her orders. She kept her previous status in mind as she stood in the frigid night with all eyes upon her. Like a protective cloak, she once again wrapped that former persona around herself. That image of her was her only protection. She held her head erect, her back straight. She was Death's Mistress and she wanted everyone to know it. Rather than wait for Sister Armina to direct her, Nicci started up the ramp. She had surveyed the encampment from up on the observation platform in the palace and knew how it was laid out. She knew where to find the command tents.

Since Jagang was probably watching Nicci through Sister Armina's eyes, the woman did not object to Nicci striking out on her own. There was no use being dragged kicking and screaming to the emperor's feet. It wouldn't change anything. She might as well go to her fate under her own power and with her head held high. More than that, though, Nicci wanted Jagang to see her in the same way as he had always seen her. She wanted him to see what he knew, see her as the same, even if she wasn't. Even if he suspected she might be somehow different, she wanted to present him with the familiar. In the past her safety had been in her indifference to what he might do to her. That indifference gave Jagang pause. It infuriated him, it frustrated him, and it fascinated him. She had been someone who had fought on his side, fought for his goals, and yet she had been someone he could have only by force. Even if she didn't have command of her power, she did have command of her mind, and it was her mind that was her true power- that was what Richard had taught her. With or without her gift, she could still be indifferent to what Jagang might do to her. That indifference gave her power. Once up and out of the pit and past the heavily armed perimeter guards, she began encountering row upon row of workers hauling dirt and rock from other pits. Hundreds of mules, pulling every sort of wagon, plodded along in long lines through the darkness. Torches showed the rows of men the way to the ramp.

Not exactly the glory for which they had gone off to fight. Nicci paid the activity little heed. It no longer mattered to her what they were doing with the ramp-the ramp was only a diversion. She felt sick at the thought of the brutes spread out in the camp getting up inside the palace. She had to think of a way to stop them. For a brief moment the very thought of her stopping them struck her as absurd. What was she going to do to stop them? She stiffened her resolve, along with her back. She would fight them with her last breath if need be. Sisters Armina and Julia both trailed behind as Nicci marched through all the activity of the camp. Sister Armina would only make herself look silly if she pushed her way out front, now. By taking the lead, Nicci had already retaken her place as the Slave Queen. Old patterns were hard to break. Now that they were entering the camp, neither Sister wished to challenge what Nicci was doing, at least not for the moment. She was, after all, stalking off toward where they would have taken her anyway. They would have no way of knowing for sure if Jagang was in her mind or not. They knew, the same as the soldiers knew, that she was Jagang's woman. That gave her unspoken rank over them. Even back at the Palace of the Prophets, she had always been a mystery to them. They had always been resentful and jealous of her-which meant that they feared her. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (328 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 For all they knew, it was possible that the emperor had merely sent them to bring his stubborn and defiant queen back to him. Jagang, no doubt watching Nicci through their eyes, seemed to be making no effort to change that perception in their minds. It could even be that Jagang really did look at it that way, that he really did think that he could have her back. She noticed but didn't acknowledge the large contingent of guards who had formed up into a train behind her. A queen did not acknowledge her attendants. They were beneath her. Fortunately, they couldn't hear her heart hammering. As they entered the camp proper, where the regular soldiers had set up their tents in squalid clusters, men stood mute, looking like beggars watching a royal procession passing before them. Others rushed up from the darkness to see what was happening. Hushed whispers passed through the crowd; Death's Mistress had at long last returned. To many of these men, even though they feared her, she was a heroine of the Order, a powerful weapon for their side. They had seen her rain down death on those who opposed the teachings of the Fellowship of Order. Even though it felt strange to be back, the camp itself was no different than she remembered. It was the usual jumble of men, tents, animals, and equipment. The only difference was that as it sat unmoving for so long it was all beginning to take on the look of rot and decay.

Sloppy midden heaps growing everywhere among the men drew clouds of flies. With so many animals and men in the same place for so long the smell was worse than the usual stench. The crush of unkempt men crowding in all around, which she had never paid a great deal of attention to in the past, was unnerving. They barely looked human. In many ways they weren't. In the past, not caring what happened to her, Nicci had been indifferent to these brutes. Now, since she cared about her life, it was different. More than that, though, in the past she had always known that she had the use of her power if their fear of her for some reason didn't keep them away. Now she could only count on their fear to keep them at arm's length. It was a long walk through hundreds of thousands of men to reach her destination, but because the camp had been in place for so long trails had become established. In places trails had widened into roads that had gradually pushed aside tents and corrals. Now, as Nicci walked those roads, trailed by her entourage, wide-eyed men lined the way, watching. Beyond the immediate silence of the men standing close by staring at her as she passed, the camp was a noisy place, even at this late hour. Behind her was the sound of the work on the ramp, wagons rolling, rock scraping and tumbling, and men calling out in unison as they pulled on heavy lines. In the camp all around the voices of soldiers laughing, talking, and arguing carried through the cold night air. She heard orders being yelled over the rhythmic sound of hammers ringing. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (330 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She could also hear the distant roar of crowds cheering for Ja'La games still going on even at this late hour. Sometimes collective boos of disapproval rose into the night air, only to be drowned out by wild yells of support. During runs with the broc men sometimes chanted shouts for their team to score. As she made her way past a corral filled with huge warhorses, and then a line of empty supply wagons, the command tents came into view. Beneath a starlit sky flags atop the tents fluttered in the cold breeze. The sight of the largest tent, the emperor's tent, threatened to drain her of courage. She wanted to run, but she was not going to be able to run ever again. This was the place where Nicci's whole life caught up with her. This was the place where it all ended. Rather than avoid the inevitable, she marched purposefully toward it. She didn't slow for the first of the checkpoints in the outer rings of protection around the command area. The big men standing watch eyed her as she approached. Their gazes also took in the contingent of the emperor's personal guard marching behind her. She was glad that she happened to be wearing a black dress because that was what she had always worn when these men would have seen her in the past. She wanted them to recognize her. A brief glare insured that none accosted her. Each successive layer of men in closer to the center of the compound was more trusted. Each ring of men around the command tents had their own units, methods, and equipment. Each wanted to be the ones to stop any harm from reaching their emperor. They each had different protocol for entering their area of file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (331 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 responsibility. Nicci ignored those protocols. She was Death's Mistress, the emperor's Slave Queen. She stopped for no one. No one challenged her. Jagang's tent was set back in a grouping of larger tents but, unlike all the other tents in the camp, it had ample space around it. Sisters patrolling the area took note of Nicci, as did the gifted young men she saw, but their gazes fell away when Nicci fixed them in her glare. The guards, too, all watched her but tried to be less obvious about it. Nicci was encouraged to see that none of these people saw her as anything but what she had been when last among them. She saw then a strange sight. Besides a cadre of Jagang's personal guards standing to either side of the heavy hanging covering the opening into his tent, there were other soldiers as well-regular soldiers. Pacing back and forth, they, too, appeared to be guarding the tent. She couldn't imagine why in the world regular soldiers would be inside the emperor's compound, much less guarding his tent. Such men had never before been trusted inside the command area. Ignoring the curiosity of regular soldiers being there in the compound, Nicci headed straight for the heavy hanging over the opening into Jagang's tent. The two Sisters, already lagging behind, reluctantly followed Nicci toward the emperor's tent. Color drained from their faces. No one, least of all a woman, was eager to enter Jagang's private sanctuary.

Two big men, each holding a pike, their faces tattooed with animalistic designs, drew back the hanging. The small silver discs attached to the lambskin made soft metallic ringing sounds, letting the emperor know that someone was entering his tent. She recognized both men holding the hanging out of the way for her but didn't acknowledge them as she lifted her skirts to step over the threshold and into the darkness beyond. Inside, slaves were busy clearing plates and platters from the emperor's table. The aroma of all the food reminded Nicci that she hadn't eaten. The knot of anxiety in her middle masked her hunger. Dozens of candles gave the place a dimly lit, cozy warmth. Thick carpets covered the floor so that footsteps of slaves going about their work would not disturb the emperor. Some of the slaves, all with heads bowed, were new. Some she remembered. Jagang appeared to have already finished his meal and was not in the outer areas. The two Sisters, having entered behind her, edged their way into the shadows toward the far walls of the tent. This was apparently as far as they were to go, and within the outer room they wanted to be as far away as possible. Knowing where Jagang would be, Nicci headed across the room. Slaves scurried to stay out of her way. At the hanging over the opening into the bedroom, she lifted the covering aside and ducked through. Inside the emperor's bedchamber Nicci at last saw him. He was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (333 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 sitting facing away from her on the other side of the plush bed covered with gold-colored silk. Points of light from the candles and oil lamps reflected off his shaved head. His bull neck spread into broad, powerful shoulders. He was wearing a lamb's-wool vest, and his massive arms were bare. He was occupied with thumbing through a book, absorbed in scanning the text. While easily given to violence, Jagang was, in certain areas, an intelligent man who prized the knowledge to be found in books or sifted from the minds he inhabited. Emotionally convinced of the veracity of his beliefs, he never troubled himself to subject those beliefs to reasoning. In fact, he viewed such questioning to be heresy. Instead, his efforts were spent collecting information in narrow areas. He knew that the right kind of knowledge could be a valuable weapon. He was a man who liked to be well armed-with every form of weapon. Something caught Nicci's eye. She looked to her left. That was when she saw her, sitting on the floor, resting on one hip and leaning on an arm. She was the most sublimely beautiful creature Nicci had ever seen. She knew without doubt who this woman was. It was Kahlan, Richard's wife. Their eyes met. The intelligence, the nobility, the life in those green eyes was riveting. This was a woman the equal of Richard. Ann had been wrong.

A tentative look haunted Kahlan's green eyes as they stared at each other. It was a ghost of cautious encouragement brought about by her awareness that Nicci could actually see her. They were instantly sisters in more than one way, sharing more than just having collars around their necks. How lonely and forlorn it must be to exist unseen and forgotten at the center of such a wicked spell. Unseen, anyway, by anyone other than Sisters of the Dark-and, apparently, Jagang. It had to be a cause for hope that another person, even a stranger, could see her. Looking at her now, Nicci could hardly believe that she could ever have forgotten this woman, even with the Chainfire spell. She could clearly see why Richard had never for an instant given up on finding her. This woman, even discounting her exquisite beauty, had a presence about her, an insightful awareness, that Nicci instantly recognized from the statue that Richard had carved. That statue, called Spirit, had not been meant to look like Kahlan, but to represent her abiding strength, her inner courage. It did that in a way that, seeing the real thing, nearly took Nicci's breath. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (335 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She was beginning to see why, even at her relatively young age, Kahlan had been named the Mother Confessor. Now, though, there were no other Confessors. She was the last. At first surprised to find Kahlan there, Nicci realized that it only made sense. Sister Armina had been one of the Sisters who had captured Kahlan and ignited the Chainfire spell. Sister Tovi had told Nicci that they had managed to evade Jagang by using the bond to Richard. While she supposed that Jagang might have somehow managed to get past that bond, Nicci thought that it made more sense that the bond had never actually protected them in the first place. If Jagang had captured Sister Armina he would have Sisters Ulicia and Cecilia as well. That had to be why Kahlan was there; she had been held by those Sisters so she, too, would have been swept up in Jagang's net. Nicci saw that Jillian was there as well. The girl's copper-colored eyes blinked in surprise to see Nicci standing there before her. While it made sense for Kahlan to be there, Nicci couldn't fathom why Jillian was. Jillian leaned in close to Kahlan, cupped a hand to her ear, and whispered something-undoubtedly Nicci's name. Kahlan responded only with a slight nod, but her eyes revealed a great deal more. She had heard Nicci's name before. When Jagang tossed the book he was studying on a bedside table, Nicci quickly pointed with two fingers between Kahlan's eyes and her own, then used one to cross her lips, urging silence.

Without waiting for confirmation, Nicci looked away from Kahlan and Jillian to face Jagang. When he turned around, fixing his black gaze on her, Nicci thought she might faint. It was one thing to remember him, quite another to be standing there before him. To once again find herself under the scrutiny of those nightmare eyes crushed her courage. She knew what lay ahead for her. \"Well, well,\" Jagang said as he made his way around the bed, his gaze fixed on her. \"Look who has returned at long last.\" He smiled broadly. \"You are as beautiful as every dream I've had of you since you were last here with me.\" Nicci wasn't surprised by the approach he'd taken, nor did it indicate anything meaningful. Never knowing how he would react kept those around him in a state of constant dread. His anger could be sparked at any time by the smallest thing, or nothing at all. Nicci had seen him strangle a slave to death for dropping a breadboard, and yet on another occasion she'd seen him pick up a dropped plate of lamb and casually hand it back to the servant who had dropped it without missing a beat in his conversation.

The deadweight of constant tension left people ready to accuse anyone of sedition-even friends or family-if only it would keep the talons of fate at bay. Like any number of other men, Jagang also thought he could win Nicci's affection with a little empty flattery. He liked to imagine that he could be charming. The form his praise took, though, revealed more about his values than hers. Nicci did not bow. She was acutely aware of the metal collar around her neck that prevented her from using her gift. While she had no defense against this man, she wasn't going to pretend respect by bowing, nor would she fawn at his finely framed lust. In the past, despite her ability to use her Han, her real safety had always been her indifference to what he might do to her. During those times when he had been able to enter her mind, and she'd had no collar around her neck, her abilities as a sorceress had been of no help to her, just as his other captive Sisters were now helpless despite the fact that none of them wore a collar. Her protection had always been in her attitude, not her gift. Before, Nicci simply hadn't cared if he hurt her, or even if he might at any time decide to kill her.

Jagang lightly drew the long braided hair growing under his lower lip between his finger and thumb. His gaze took in the length of her. He let out a deep breath, as if considering what he would do with her first. She didn't have long to wait. He abruptly backhanded her hard enough to send her flying. When she landed her head hit the floor but, fortunately, the thick carpets cushioned the impact. It felt as if the muscles of her jaw had been ripped and the bone shattered.

Such preemptive agony was meant to keep her where she was, keep her from interfering. Nicci judged it to be, from Jagang's perspective, a wise decision. As far back as she could remember, Nicci had been able to appraise people and to do so quickly. It had become a valuable talent, since survival in violent encounters often depended on the accurate evaluation of those she faced. Nicci could tell just by looking at Kahlan that she was a dangerous woman, a woman who was used to interfering. Jagang snatched Jillian by the back of her neck and lifted her like a troublesome kitten. She squealed-more in fright than pain-as he held her aloft and marched her across the room.

It was Kah-lan's emotional connection with Richard, not Nicci's, that mattered. \"My feelings have never burdened you before,\" Nicci finally said, irritably. \"What difference could it make to you?\" He turned back to stare at her. \"What difference? How can you ask such a thing? I made you as good as my queen. You asked me to trust you and allow you to go off to eliminate Lord Rahl. I wished you to remain here but instead I let you go. I trusted you.\" \"So you say. If you really trusted me then you would trust me, not interrogate me. It would seem that you have difficulty understanding the concept represented by the word.\" \"That was a year and a half ago. I haven't seen you since.

Nicci fully expected him to suddenly round on her and hit her hard enough to break her skull. She wanted him to. A quick end was far preferable to drawn-out torture on the way to a slow death.

It's never interfered with your ability to rape me.\" \"Why this nonsense about rape all of a sudden!\" he roared as he took a long stride back toward her. \"You know that I have feelings for you! And I know that you have feelings for me!\" Nicci didn't bother to answer. He was right in that she had never presented such objections to him before. She hadn't known how to object. In that past she hadn't believed that her life was her own. How could she object to the Order using her to their ends? Further, how could she object to the leader of the Order using her to his ends?

Unlike Jagang, and most people who embraced the Order's beliefs, Nicci had accepted them because she thought she had to, that it was the only way for her to achieve a moral life. She endured the yoke of servitude to others, all the while hating herself for not being happy about it.

She no longer focused on the man atop her, hitting her. Her gaze drifted to the ceiling of the tent. As his fists pounded her, she hardly felt it. It was only her body, somewhere distant, that was hurting. She had to breathe through a burble of blood. She knew that he was pulling off her dress, knew that his big hands were groping her, but she ignored that, too. Instead-as Jagang beat her, pawed her, climbed on top of her, forced her legs open-she thought about Richard, about how he always treated her with respect. As the nightmare started, she dreamed of other things. CHAPTER 24 With the back of her wrist, Rachel wiped sweat from her forehead. She knew that as soon as she stopped working she would get cold, but at the moment she was sweating. It was hard to stop, because she was in a hurry.

She didn't like to think about what would happen to her if she didn't hurry. The pine boughs she had cut and leaned up against the low rock wall would help block the cold wind. She'd braced them with a support made of dead cedar saplings she had found nearby. Cutting fresh pine branches with a knife wasn't easy. Chase had taught her how to build a shelter. He probably wouldn't think much of this one, but without at least a hatchet it was the best she could do. At least, it was the best she felt like doing. All she really felt like doing was hurrying. She'd picketed the horse close, after letting it drink its fill from a nearby brook. She had been careful to give it enough line to be able to crop at the bunches of grass growing along the bank. Using the flint from the saddlebags, she'd built a fire just inside the protection of the wind block she'd made. It was terrifying being out alone in the countryside at night. There could be bears, or mountain lions, or wolves. A fire helped her to feel safe while she got some sleep waiting for first light. She needed it to be light so that she could start out again. She needed to get going. She needed to hurry.

She put her back to the rock wall so that nothing could sneak up behind her. With it getting darker, she was feeling afraid. Rather than think about being afraid, she pulled the saddlebags closer and retrieved a piece of dried meat. She tore off a small bite with her teeth and sucked on it for a time, letting the taste start to satisfy her gnawing hunger. She didn't have a lot of food left, so she was trying to conserve what she had. It wasn't long, though, until she was chewing and swallowing. She broke off a piece of hard biscuit and, holding it in her palm, dribbled a little water from the waterskin onto it to try to soften it up a bit before she tried to chew it. The biscuits were as hard as rocks. The dried meat was easier to chew than the biscuits, but she had more biscuits. She'd searched for berries as she rode, but it was too late in the year for there to be any left. One day she had spotted a wild apple tree. Even though they were shriveled they had looked like they might make a meal, but she knew better than to eat red fruit. Red fruit was poisonous. As hungry as she was for something other than dried meat and dried biscuits, she didn't want to get poisoned. Rachel sat quietly for a time, chewing on the tough meat as she stared into the fire. She kept listening for things that might be out in the darkness beyond the fire. She didn't want to be surprised by a hungry animal that might think she'd make a good meal. When she looked up, there was a woman standing before her, on the opposite side of the fire. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (364 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Rachel gasped. She tried to back up, but the rock wall was right there behind her. She thought that she might be able to slip away to the side if she had to. She snatched up her knife. \"Please, don't be afraid.\" Rachel thought that it was just about the most pleasing, gentle, kind voice she had ever heard. Still, she knew better than to be taken in by kind-sounding words. She stared up at the woman, trying to decide what to do, as the woman stared down at her. She didn't look threatening. She didn't do anything that seemed unfriendly. She had, though, shown up out in the middle of nowhere. There was something about her that looked faintly familiar. Her pleasant voice still sang in Rachel's mind. The woman was pretty enough, with plain, cropped blond hair. Her arms hung slack, hands joined before her, fingers loosely knitted together. She wore simple flaxen robes that reached all the way to the ground. The shawl around her shoulders looked to be dyed from henna. Her modest dress made her look like she must be a commoner, rather than a woman of noble rank. From having lived at the palace in Tamarang Rachel knew a lot about noble women. Noble women were usually trouble for someone like Rachel. \"Please, may I sit and share your fire?\" the woman asked in that voice that had Rachel hanging on every word. \"No.\" \"No?\" \"No. I don't know you.

Goose bumps tingled up her arms. \"How do you know my name?\" The smile widened a little-not in a cunning way, but in a gentle, kind-hearted manner. The woman's eyes, too, had a softness about them that made it seem like they could never intend harm. Still, that did not do much to diminish Rachel's caution. She'd been fooled by nice looking ladies in the past. \"Would you like something to eat other than that dry traveling food?\" \"No. I'm fine,\" Rachel said. \"I mean, I appreciate your offer, it's very kind of you, but I'm fine, thank you.\" The woman bent and picked up something lying on the ground behind her. When she stood again, Rachel saw that it was a string of small trout. She held them up. \"Would it be all right if I just used your fire to cook these for myself, then?\" Rachel was having trouble trying to think. She had to hurry. That was all she seemed able to focus on-that she had to hurry. But she couldn't hurry at camp. She couldn't leave until it was light. \"I suppose it would be all right if you cooked your fish on the fire.\" The woman smiled again. It was a smile that for some reason lifted Rachel's heart. \"Thank you. I'll not be any trouble to you.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (366 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Quick as a wink, she turned and disappeared into the night. Rachel had no idea where she went, or why. The string of fish still lay nearby. Rachel sat listening into the darkness as the fire hissed and popped. She clutched her knife tightly in her fist as she strained to hear off into the darkness for any sign that the woman might have other people with her. When she returned, the woman had a pile of big moose maple leaves, a number of them covered with a thick layer of mud. The woman said nothing as she squatted down and went about preparing the fish. She rolled each fish in a clean moose maple leaf, then lined them all up in the mud, layered mud on top, and finally wrapped it all in leaves. When she was finished making the rolled up mud oven she carefully placed it on the fire. The whole time, Rachel watched her. It was hard not to. In fact, Rachel couldn't take her eyes off the woman. There was something about her that just kind of made Rachel ache with longing to be closer to her. Still, her sense of caution wouldn't allow it. Besides, she was in a hurry. The woman backed away a few paces, apparently so as not to frighten Rachel, and sat on the ground, folding her legs under her, to wait for her fish to cook. Flames danced in the cold night air, and sparks swirled up whenever the wood popped. From time to time the woman warmed her hands at the fire. Rachel was having a hard time not thinking about the fish. It smelled delicious. She could imagine how good it would taste. But she had said that she didn't want any. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (367 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Rachel realized, then, that she had asked a question before and never gotten an answer. \"How do you know my name?\" The woman shrugged one shoulder. \"The good spirits must have whispered it in my ear.\" Rachel thought that was about the silliest thing she had ever heard. She couldn't help giggling, though. \"In truth,\" the woman said, looking more serious, \"I remember you.\" The goose bumps returned. \"From the castle in Tamarang?\" The woman rolled a finger. \"No. From before then.\" Rachel frowned. \"From the orphanage?\" The woman made a little sound to confirm it. She suddenly looked sad. Together they watched the flames waver and dance, and throw light against the rock wall and lean-to of pine boughs. In the distance coyotes howled in long, lonely wails. Whenever the coyotes started in to howling. Rachel was glad for the fire. She could easily be prey for wolves and such if not for the fire. The bugs nearby chirped and buzzed while moths whirled in circles through the light. Swirling sparks ascended into the night sky, looking as if they were eager to join the stars. It was all making Rachel sleepy. \"I bet the fish are ready,\" the woman said in a bright voice.

Spreading the leaves open on the ground, she finally exposed the fish inside. They were steaming hot, and flaky. She broke off a piece and tasted it, then moaned with delight at how good it tasted. Then she put the rest of the little trout on a moose maple leaf and offered it to Rachel. Rachel sat staring at the hand. She had said that she didn't want any of the woman's fish. \"Thank you, but I have my own things to eat. You should have your fish.\" \"Nonsense, there's more than enough. Please, won't you eat some with me? Just a little? After all, I used the fire you worked to build, so it's the least I can do.\" Rachel stared at the delicious looking fish on the leaf in the palm of the woman's hand. \"Well, if you don't mind, then, I'll have one.\" The woman smiled and the world suddenly seemed a better place. Rachel thought that it must be a smile like a mother would have- filled with simple delight at the wonder of life. She tried not to devour the fish. That it was steaming hot helped to slow her down. That, and the sharp little bones. It felt so good to eat hot food that she almost cried with joy. When she finished the fish, the woman handed her another. Rachel took it without hesitation. She so needed to eat. She told herself that she needed to be strong so that she could hurry. The tender fish warmed the pang of hunger lodged deep in the pit of her stomach, making the ache melt away. Rachel ate four more before she was full. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (369 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Don't push your horse so hard tomorrow,\" the woman said. \"If you do, it will die.\" Rachel blinked. \"How do you know that?\" \"I introduced myself to your animal when I came across your camp.

She had to hurry. \"If I go any slower, they'll get me.\" The woman cocked her head. \"Who will get you?\" \"The ghostie gobblies.\" \"Ah, I see.\" \"The ghostie gobblies are after me. Whenever I slow they start to get closer.\" Tears stung Rachel's eyes. \"I don't want the ghostie gobblies to get me.\" The woman was there, then, right next to her, circling an arm around her, sheltering her. It felt so good that Rachel started to cry in the comfort of that protection. She had to hurry. She was so afraid. \"If you kill the horse,\" the woman said in a soft, gentle voice, \"then the ghostie gobblies will get you, now, won't they? Take it just a little slower. You have time.\" Rachel snuggled in the crook of the woman's arm. \"Are you sure?\" \"I'm sure. You need to let the horse get its strength back. It won't do you any good to kill the animal.

Rachel held it up closer, trying to see it better.

She knew who the woman was. \"You're my mother, aren't you?\" The woman smoothed a hand down Rachel's hair. She had a sad smile. A tear rolled down her cheek. Rachel knew that her mother was dead, or, at least she had been told that she was. Maybe this was her mother's good spirit. Rachel opened her mouth to speak again, but her mother gently shushed her, then tipped Rachel's head against her. \"You need rest. I'll watch over you. Sleep. You're safe with me.\" Rachel was so tired. She listened to the wonderful sound of her mother's heart beating. She stretched her arms around her mother's ribs, and nuzzled against her..

Dark purple clouds looked as if they were trying to hide the approaching light in the eastern sky. She sat up abruptly. All that was left of the fire was cold ashes. She was alone. Before she could think of anything else, before she had time to be sad. she knew that she had to hurry. With frantic effort she quickly gathered up her few things-the blanket, the flint and steel, the waterskin-stuffing them into the saddlebags. She saw the horse not far away, watching her.

Jagang often brought women captives to his bed. He frequently hurt them, either simply by not taking into account his own strength, or because he intended them harm when they failed to cooperate. This was different. With Nicci, he was venting hot jealousy. He had never hurt any of those other women the way he hurt Nicci. In his own mind, Kahlan knew, he was getting even, settling a score, making Nicci pay the price of being unfaithful to him. But, in some ways, Jagang was also showing Kahlan what kind of treatment she could look forward to once her memory was finally restored. Kahlan tried to shut the things she'd seen and heard from her mind lest she be sick. She focused instead on the present, and the future. She let go with one hand and turned to retrieve a waterskin lying on the floor nearby. Nicci lightly caught the remaining hand, apparently fearful of losing the human compassion in that connection. \"Here,\" Kahlan said in little more than a whisper as she lifted the waterskin to Nicci's lips. Splatters of dried blood masked her face and hair. Other than loosely holding on to Kahlan's hand, Nicci didn't respond. \"Drink,\" Kahlan urged. \"It's water.\" Nicci didn't make any effort to drink, so Kahlan let a little of the water trickle across the woman's cracked lips and into her mouth.

His powerful hands had left behind lurid bruises, though, and not just on her neck. Nicci's blue eyes slowly opened, focusing on Kahlan's face. Kahlan was down low, sitting on the floor beside the bed. She was leaning in close to Nicci, trying to keep her voice low so that it wouldn't carry to those outside the bedchamber. She didn't want anyone to hear her talking to Nicci. Nicci hadn't wanted Jagang to know that she could see Kahlan. Kahlan thought it wise to never let an enemy know anything more than was absolutely necessary. Apparently, Nicci thought much the same thing. As awkward as it was leaning over the edge of the bed, Kahlan didn't dare get up off the carpet. She knew the consequences of getting up when Jagang had told her to stay on the floor. A jagged gash at Nicci's scalp line on the right side of her forehead was still bleeding. A glancing blow from Jagang's ringed fist had ripped up a flap of scalp. Kahlan snatched up a small cloth, folded it, and gently pressed it against the wound on Nicci's forehead, fitting the loose chunk of flesh in place as she applied pressure to stop the bleeding. In mere moments the cloth soaked through with blood.

She carefully pulled a lock of blond hair back off Nicci's face. \"I'm so sorry for what he did to you.\" Nicci nodded slightly, her jaw trembling slightly as she held back tears. \"I wanted so much to stop him,\" Kahlan said. With the back of a finger Nicci caught the tear running down Kahlan's cheek. \"There was nothing you could do,\" the woman managed. \"Nothing.\" Her voice was weak but, despite that, it still carried the same silken grace as before. It was a voice that matched the rest of her perfectly. Kahlan would never have guessed that such a lovely voice could also carry such righteous contempt as she'd shown Jagang. \"Nothing any of us can do,\" Nicci whispered as her eyelids slid closed. \"Except maybe Richard.\" Kahlan studied the woman's blue eyes a moment. \"You really think that Richard Rahl can do something?'

She winced as she swallowed, but she drank. \"Well,\" Kahlan said when Nicci finished drinking, \"someone called out for him. He went to the doorway and a man spoke to him in a low voice. I couldn't hear all of it, but it sounded like he said that they'd found something. Jagang came back and put on his clothes.

He told me to stay where I was. \"Then he put one knee on the bed, leaned over you, and whispered to you that he was sorry.\" Nicci huffed a laugh, but it was cut short when she winced in pain. \"He isn't capable of feeling sorry for anyone but himself.\" \"You'll get no argument from me,\" Kahlan said. \"Anyway, he promised to bring back a Sister to heal you.

There was usually at least one of them at hand. \"I've never seen anyone stand up to Jagang the way you did,\" Kahlan said. \"It wouldn't really have mattered if I did or not.\" Nicci paused to get her breath. \"He was going to do what he wanted to do.

I think I'm the one who is going to be killed.\" \"Maybe we can think of something before that happens,\" Kahlan said. \"How did he manage to capture you, anyway?\" \"I was in the palace.\" \"They found a way in?\" \"Yes. Through forgotten catacombs that run underneath the Azrith Plain and under the plateau. The underground chambers and tunnels appear to have been abandoned millennia ago. \"I think it was a reconnaissance expedition that caught me. They haven't begun to invade the palace, yet, but as soon as they have what they need in place I'm sure they will.\" Kahlan realized that that was what had been discovered buried in the pit. With a way in, it was only a matter of time until they stormed the palace and slaughtered everyone up there. She knew that when that happened all hope would be lost. Jagang would have defeated the last holdout against the Imperial Order. He would rule the world. At least, he would if he could get his hands on the third box of Orden. Kahlan didn't doubt his word, though, that he would soon accomplish that as well. It seemed that time was not just running out for Richard Rahl, but for any hope of freedom surviving. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (381 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci, her chin trembling, looked over at Kahlan. \"Please, cover me?\" \"Sorry,\" Kahlan said. \"I should have thought of that.\" Actually, she had, but she had thought that maybe it might be worse if she covered Nicci and the sheet stuck to the wounds. She could certainly understand, though, why Nicci would want to be covered. Kahlan stretched, caught the edge of the gold bedcover and pulled it up. Ever mindful of the collar, she had to be careful not to let herself get up from the floor. \"Thanks,\" Nicci said as she at last was able to pull the silk cover the rest of the way over herself. \"Don't be ashamed,\" Kahlan said. Nicci frowned a little. \"What do you mean?\" \"You should never be ashamed to be a victim. It wasn't through any fault of yours. The only thing you should feel is anger at such a violation. You didn't do anything to encourage it. It was rape, just as you said it was.\" Nicci smiled a little as she touched Kahlan's cheek. \"Thanks.\" Kahlan took a deep breath. \"Jagang has promised to do much the same to me as he did to you.\" Nicci's hand tightened on Kahlan's, offering in turn some solace. Kahlan hesitated, but then went on. \"The only reason he hasn't yet is because he wants it to be worse than it would be if he did it now. He told me that he wants to wait until I know who I am.

Do you know who this 'he' is?\" Nicci's answer was a long moment in coming. \"I'm sorry, but I don't remember you, or your past. All I know is the things I've heard, like your name and that you are the Mother Confessor.\" Kahlan nodded. She didn't think she was getting the whole truth. She felt pretty confident that Nicci knew more than she was admitting. Kahlan thought it best, though, not to press her on the subject. At that moment, forcing her to do anything she didn't want to do seemed too cruel to contemplate. Maybe she had her own reasons for not wanting to say more. Maybe those reasons were strictly personal and none of Kahlan's business. Kahlan smiled, determined to steer away from the gloom of such a dark subject. \"I liked all the things you said about Richard Rahl. This Richard sounds like my kind of man.\" Nicci smiled the slightest bit. \"You are both good people.\" Kahlan rubbed a thumb back and forth on the edge of the bedcover. \"What's he like?

It sounds like he cares a great deal for you.\" Nicci dismissed the suggestion with a flick of a hand. She looked over at Kahlan. \"There are regular soldiers outside Jagang's tent. Do you know why?\" The abrupt change of topic told Kahlan that she was probing into things Nicci didn't want to talk about. Kahlan wondered why not. She turned her attention to Nicci's question. \"The soldiers are there because they can see me. Very few people can. Sister Ulicia told Jagang that she thinks it's just an anomaly. After I killed two of his guards and Sister Cecilia.\" Her expression intense, Nicci lifted her head a little. \"You killed Sister Cecilia?\" \"Yes.\" \"How did you manage to kill a Sister of the Dark?\" \"It was back in Caska, the place where you and Richard saw Jillian.\" \"Who told you that?\" \"Jillian.\" Nicci's head sank back down. \"Oh.\" \"Jillian said she helped Richard find the Chainfire book he was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (384 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 hunting for down in the catacombs of Caska.

They were pretty surprised.\" \"I bet they were,\" Nicci said. \"Like just about everyone else, Jagang's guards couldn't see me, so while the dream walker was busy with the Sisters, arguing over a book, I pulled the guards' knives out of their sheaths. Since they couldn't see me, they had no idea the danger they were in. As they stood silently watching over their emperor I used their own weapons to run them through. \"Before they even hit the floor I pushed Jillian out ahead of me into the maze of tunnels. As everyone came rushing out the doorway behind us I threw a knife. I'd been hoping to get Jagang with the knife but it was Sister Cecilia who came through the doorway first.

He will do it without hesitation.\" \"I know. Do you have any idea why there are a few people who can see me when almost no one can?

Richard again, tied up in my life.\" She shook her head. \"Sometimes I don't know if it's a good thing or not.\" When Nicci said nothing, she urged her to go on. \"So, how did he ever discover the defect?\" \"It's a long story.

The Chainfire spell has tangled us all up in it. If it runs free it could even end life itself.\" Kahlan silently reprimanded herself for even fantasizing that Richard Rahl had actually been trying to save her, that maybe he knew her and she meant something to him. \"I was running a verification web,\" Nicci said. \"Richard saw indications in the spell-unique designs-that told him that it was contaminated. It explained a lot. We need to undo the Chainfire spell because, while it does make everyone forget you, it causes larger problems.\" \"What kind of larger problems?\" Nicci paused to draw a few rattling breaths, wincing in pain, before going on. \"Since it's contaminated, the damaging effects of the spell expanded in unexpected ways. We fear that, unchecked, it will destroy the minds of those it has infected. I think that the contamination may be responsible for the spell not working as intended.

The sounds of the camp outside the tent seemed like they were in another world altogether. \"The Sisters used the spell on you so they could send you into the palace, unseen, to steal the boxes of Orden for them. The key to the boxes is a book called The Book of Counted Shadows. They need a Confessor to confirm if the book they are using is the true key to the boxes.\" \"I've seen the book,\" Kahlan said. She knew that Nicci was telling the truth about that much of it, because Jagang had already demanded that Kahlan confirm if the book was a true copy or a fake. She had proclaimed it a false copy. She knew that there also had to be more to it, but for some reason Nicci was carefully dancing around secrets. Kahlan pulled at a string on the bedcover. \"I wish I could talk to Richard Rahl. I wonder if he might have answers for me.\" \"I wish you could meet him. But that now seems unlikely to ever happen.\" Kahlan wanted to ask if it had actually been likely until recent events. She thought that maybe Nicci had just revealed more than she thought she had, or had intended. \"I hate to say it, but I think that you and I are not ever going to be able to see the outcome of this struggle, but do you really think that Richard Rahl is going to be able to stop this madness?

She turned her face away as a tear leaked out, tracing a slow path through the splotches of dried blood. \"I'm sorry,\" Kahlan said. \"I shouldn't have said anything.

As long as there's life, there's the potential that we can change things for the better.

Even if he was now trying to save others from the effects of the spell, he hadn't discovered the defect that was causing that damage to other people until after he was already trying to figure out how he could restore Kahlan's memory. Having difficulty breathing, Nicci fell to a fit of coughing that was obviously agonizingly painful. She started gasping for air. Kahlan could hear the rattle of fluid in her lungs. Nicci was beginning to panic with the unsuccessful effort to breathe. She gripped the bedcover in her fists and her back arched as she tried desperately to pull a breath. Kahlan quickly pulled the bedcover down a ways and placed a hand directly on Nicci's upper abdomen. \"Nicci, listen to me. Breathe to my hand. Slowly.\" Nicci's confused eyes sought Kahlan's but she couldn't speak through her gasping attempts to get a breath. Tears began to flow. Kahlan gently rubbed her hand around in a small circle, speaking as calmly as she could. \"Slow down, Nicci. Focus your mind on my hand. Feel where it is. Pull your breath slowly and evenly toward it. You're going to be fine. You're trying to breathe too fast, that's all. \"You're not alone. Everything is all right. I promise.

Just think about my hand. Let your breath reach down to my hand. Slower. Slower. That's it, easy . . . easy. That's it. You're doing good. Just think about my hand and keep breathing slowly.\" Nicci's breathing slowed. She seemed like she was at last getting the air she so desperately needed. Kahlan continued to gently rub Nicci's abdomen just below her ribs and to urge her to slow down. The whole time Nicci tightly held Kahlan's other hand. After a short time the crisis passed and Nicci was more comfortably getting her breath. She needed more help, though, than Kahlan could offer her. She wished that a Sister would arrive. \"Look, Nicci, we may not get a chance to talk again, but don't give up. There's a man here who I think is going to do something.\" Nicci swallowed as she regained her equilibrium. \"What are you talking about? What sort of man?\" \"He's a Ja'La player. He's the point man on a team belonging to Commander Karg.\" \"Karg,\" she said with disgust. \"I know him. The things he does to women are more vile in their invention than Jagang.

He doesn't want anyone in the camp to recognize him.\" \"How in the world would you know that?\" \"It's a long story, but he found a way around anyone recognizing him. He painted his face in wild designs-with red paint-along with the faces of all the men on his team.\" Kahlan leaned closer. \"Maybe he's an assassin or something. It could be that he's intending to kill Jagang.\" Nicci closed her eyes again, losing interest. \"I wouldn't get my hopes up about such a thing if I were you.\" \"You would if you saw this man's eyes.\" Kahlan wanted to ask Nicci a thousand questions, but she heard voices beyond the doorway coming closer. Then she heard a woman outside dismiss a slave. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (392 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"I think the Sister is coming.\" Kahlan squeezed Nicci's hand. \"Be strong.\" \"I don't think-\" \"Be strong for Richard.\" Nicci stared, unable to speak.

She just wasn't as vocal about it. The red leather outfit Cara wore stood out like blood against the virtuous white of the marble walls. The Mord-Sith's mood, which seemed to match the color of her outfit, had only gotten worse as the day had worn on and the search had turned up nothing. Several other Mord-Sith followed some distance back, along with a contingent of the First File-the Palace Guard. Adie was not far behind while Nathan was out by himself in the lead. Verna understood Cara's feelings, and in an odd way was cheered by them. Nicci was more than Cara's charge, more than a woman Richard had wanted Cara to protect. Nicci was Cara's friend.

Nicci, like Cara herself, had long been someone lost to a dark purpose. They had both come back from that terrible place because Richard had given them not only the chance to change, but a reason to. It wasn't so much when a Mord-Sith shouted and yelled that alarmed Verna, it was when their questions became quiet and terse. That was what lifted the hackles on the back of her neck-when it was clear that they meant business, and the business of Mord-Sith was not at all pleasant. It was best not to find yourself in the way of a Mord-Sith when she meant to have answers. Verna only wished that she had them. She understood Cara's frustration. She felt no less anxious and bewildered at what could have happened to Nicci and Ann. She knew, though, that repeating the same questions and insisting on answers would not produce those answers any more than it would produce the two missing women. She supposed that Mord-Sith fell back on their training when there seemed no other solution. Cara stopped, hands on hips, and looked back down the marble hallway. Behind them a few hundred men of the First File slowed to a halt so that they wouldn't overrun those in the lead. The echo of boots on stone slowly dwindled to a whisper. Several of the soldiers had crossbows with red fletched arrows at the ready. Those arrows made Verna sweat. She almost wished that Nathan had never found them. Almost. The seemingly endless maze of halls behind the heavily armed soldiers was empty and silent but for the hissing torches.

The two missing women were hardly likely to pop out of the marble walls. \"They had to have gone somewhere else,\" Verna finally said, even though no one had seen them. Cara turned back. \"Like where?\" Verna lifted her arms and finally let them flop back down to her sides. \"I don't know.\" \"It be a big palace,\" Adie said. The torchlight lent the sorceress's completely white eyes a disturbing, translucent quality.

It was always possible, after all, that the two missing women could show up at any moment and wonder what all the fuss was about. \"You said Ann and Nicci had wanted to be alone to have a private conversation,\" Adie said. \"Perhaps they went off somewhere private.\" \"All night?\" Verna asked. \"I can't imagine that. The two of them didn't have much in common. They weren't friends. Dear Creator, I don't think they even liked each other all that much. I can't imagine them chatting the night away.\" \"Me neither,\" Cara said. Verna looked up at the prophet. \"Do you have any idea what Ann might have wanted to talk to Nicci about?\" Nathan's long white hair brushed his shoulders when he shook his head. \"Ann naturally took a dim view of Nicci, considering that she turned to the Sisters of the Dark.

She believes that Nicci, since renouncing the Sisters of the Dark, has no other choice, now, except to return her devotion to the cause of the Sisters of the Light.\" \"What cause? Why does she think Nicci has to be devoted to the Sisters of the Light?\" Cara asked. Nathan leaned a little toward the Mord-Sith. \"She thinks that us wizards need a Sister of the Light to guide our every thought and action. She has always believed that we should not be allowed to think for ourselves.\" Verna's gaze wandered off down the empty passageway. \"I guess that I used to believe much the same thing. But that was before Richard.\" \"Keep in mind, though, that you've spent far more time with Richard than Ann ever did.\" Nathan shook his head sadly. \"While she had to have come to much the same understanding about Richard needing to act on his own as most of us agree he must, she seems lately to be reverting to her old ways, her old beliefs.

I can see with my gift, not my eyes. It be dark last night. Maybe in the dark they had to slip away for some reason. Maybe it be important and they didn't have time to tell us.\" \"You could do that?\" Cara asked. \"You could go out in the dark and make it through the enemy?\" \"Of course.\" Verna was already thumbing through her journey book. As she had expected, it was completely blank. \"There is no message.\" She tucked the small book back behind her belt. \"I'll try your suggestion, though, and write Ann a message. Perhaps she will look in her journey book and reply.\" With a flourish of his cape, Nathan once again started away. \"Before we go off to look elsewhere I want to check the tomb again.\" \"Post a guard up here,\" Cara called back to the soldiers. \"The rest of you come with us.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (401 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Already some distance off down the hall, Nathan turned down a stairway. The rest of them all followed behind, their footsteps echoing as they hurried to catch up. Nathan, Cara, Adie, Verna, and the soldiers bringing up the rear all descended down to the next level. The walls of the lower level were stone block, rather than marble. In places they were stained by centuries of water seeping through. The seepage left behind yellowish formations that made the stone look as if it were melting. They soon enough arrived at stone that really had melted. Nathan came to a halt before the opening to Panis Rahl's tomb. The tall prophet, his face grim and drawn, stared past melted stone into the tomb. It was the fourth time he had returned to look into the tomb and this time it looked no different than on previous visits. Verna was worried about the man. While he was worried and wanted to find answers, there was a kind of rage simmering just below the surface. She had never seen him like this before. The only person she could think of who had same quality of quiet, bottled fury that could make her heart race was Richard. Such focused anger had to be, she thought, a Rahl quality. Whatever doors had once guarded the crypt had been replaced with a kind of white stone intended to seal the large tomb. It appeared to have been hastily constructed, but it hadn't succeeded in halting the strange conditions overcoming Panis Rahl's tomb. Inside, fifty-seven cold torches rested in ornate gold brackets.

Beneath each of the torches was a vase meant to hold flowers. By the fifty-seven torches and vases, Verna guessed that Panis Rahl must have been fifty-seven when he died. A short pillar in the center of the cavernous room supported the coffin itself, making it look as if it floated above the floor of white marble. The gold-enshrouded coffin glowed softly in the wavering, warm light of the four torches. The way the walls were covered in polished crystalline granite that ran up and completely across the vaulting, Verna imagined that when all the torches around the room were lit the coffin must glow in golden glory as it floated all by itself in the center of the room. Words carved in the ancient language of High D'Haran covered the sides of the coffin. Cut into the granite beneath the torches and gold vases. an endless ribbon of words in the same nearly forgotten language ringed the room. The deeply incised letters shimmered in the torchlight, almost making them look as if they were lit from within. Whatever was causing the white stone that had once blocked the entrance to the tomb to melt was beginning to affect the room itself, although not to the same extent. Verna suspected that the white stone used to wall over the entrance was a stopgap, a sacrificial substance deliberately selected to draw and absorb the invisible force responsible for the trouble. Now that the white stone was almost all melted away those forces were beginning to attack the tomb itself. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (403 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The stone slabs of the walls and floor hadn't melted or cracked, but they were just beginning to distort, as if they were being subjected to great neat or pressure.

Whatever was causing such an event, it was obvious that\" it was not a construction defect, but rather some kind of external force. Nicci had said that she wanted to see the tomb because she thought she knew why it was melting. Unfortunately, she hadn't revealed the nature of her suspicion. There was no sign that she and Ann had visited the tomb. Verna was impatient to find both women so that the whole mystery could be solved. She couldn't imagine what the trouble with the tomb of Richard's grandfather could be, or how much worse it would get, but she didn't think it would turn out to be anything good. Nor did she think that there was much time left to answer the riddle-any part of it. \"Lord Rahl,\" a voice called. They all turned back. A messenger came to a halt not far away. All the messengers wore white robes trimmed around the neck and down the front with a design of intertwined purple vines. \"What is it?\" Nathan asked. Verna thought that as long as she lived she would never get used to hearing people call Nathan \"Lord Rahl.\" The man bowed briefly. \"There is a delegation from the Imperial Order waiting on the other side of the drawbridge.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (404 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nathan blinked in surprise. \"What do they want?\" \"They want to speak to Lord Rahl.\" Nathan glanced to Cara and then Verna.

Nathan's face bent into a sour expression. \"Whatever it is, I think I'd better go look into it.\" \"I'm going, too.\" Cara said. \"As am I,\" Verna added. \"We'll all go,\" Nathan said as he started away. Verna and the small clutch of people with her followed Nathan out of the grand entrance of the People's Palace and into the bright late- afternoon sunlight. Long shadows cast by the towering columns cascaded down the hillside of steps before them. In the distance, across the expanse of grounds, the great outer wall stood at the edge of the plateau. Men patrolled a walkway between crenellated battlements along the top of the massive wall. It had been a long journey up from the tombs deep within the palace and they were all winded. Verna shaded her eyes with a hand as they descended the grand stairs in the wake of the long- legged prophet. Guards posted on each of the expansive landings saluted the Lord Rahl with a fist to their hearts. There were greater numbers of soldiers in the distance patrolling the broad sweep of grounds leading to the outer wall. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (405 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The stairs ended in a broad area of bluestone that took them to a roadway winding up from around the side where stables and carriages would be.

Each turn gave the silent company an unbroken view of the Imperial Order spread out far below. The drawbridge was guarded by hundreds of troops of the First File. These were all well-trained, heavily armed soldiers committed to insuring that no one came up the road to assault the People's Palace. There was little chance of that, though. The road was too narrow to mount any kind of meaningful attack. In such tight confines a few dozen good men could hold off an entire army. More than that, though, the drawbridge was up. The sheer drop was dizzying. It was too far across for assault ladders or ropes with grappling hooks. Without the bridge down no one could cross the chasm and approach the palace. Beyond the drawbridge a small delegation waited. By their simple dress they looked to be messengers. Verna did see a few dozen lightly armed soldiers, but they remained well back from the messengers so as not to appear threatening. Nathan, his cloak buttoned back on one shoulder even though it was a cold day, came to a halt at the edge of the chasm, feet spread, fists on his hips, looking imposing and commanding. \"I am Lord Rahl,\" he announced to the party across the drop. \"What do you want?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (406 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 One of the men, a slender fellow wearing a simple tunic of darkly dyed fabric, shared a look with his comrades and then stepped a little closer to his side of the brink. \"His Excellency, Emperor Jagang, has sent me with a message for the D'Haran people.\" Nathan glanced around at the others behind him. \"Well, I'm Lord Rahl, \" so I speak for the D'Haran people.

After all, once the war was over Jagang would need people to rule far-flung conquered lands. She wondered if Nathan was capable of such treason.

CHAPTER 27 Richard was growing ever more concerned. He had expected that at one of the games he would see his chance. But after Jagang and Kahlan had come to the first Ja'La match a dozen days before, the emperor had not again shown up to watch a game. Richard was frantic with worry over the reason. He tried not to think about what Jagang might be doing to Kahlan, and yet he couldn't keep himself from imagining the worst. Sitting chained to the wagon, surrounded by a ring of guards, there was not much Richard could do about it. Despite how desperately he wanted to act. he had to use his head and look for the right opportunity. It had always been a risk that a good opportunity might not come along and then he would be forced to act, but doing something out of frustration alone was not likely to accomplish anything except maybe ruin any chance he would otherwise have of getting the opportunity he needed. Still, waiting was driving him crazy.

He knew, though, that his anxiety was going to keep him from getting much sleep, just as it had kept him from getting sleep for days. He was going to need the sleep, though, because the next day was their most important game yet-a game that he hoped would get him to the opportunity he was looking for. He glanced up when he heard the soldier coming with their evening meal. As hungry as Richard was, even the usual hard- boiled eggs sounded good. The soldier, pulling the small cart he always used to haul their food, made his way through the ring of guards around the captive members of Richard's team. The soldiers gave the man only a cursory look. The wheels of the cart squeaked with a familiar rhythm as the man plodded across the hardscrabble ground. He stopped in front of Richard. \"Hold out your hands,\" he said as he picked up a knife and started sawing away on something in his cart. Richard did as he was told. The man lifted something from the cart and tossed it to Richard. To his surprise, it was a hefty slice of ham. \"What's this? A last good meal before tomorrow's fateful game?\" The man lifted the handles on his cart. \"Supplies came in. Everyone eats.\" Richard stared at the soldier's back as he wheeled his cart up the row to feed the other men.

Up until now they had usually been fed eggs. Sometimes they'd been given stew with precious few chunks of lamb. Once it had been beef stew. Richard wondered how supplies had gotten through to the encampment. The D'Haran army was supposed to stop any supplies from reaching the Order's army. Starving Jagang's men was their only real chance to stop them. If Richard hadn't already been worried enough, the thick slice of ham in his hand represented a grave new concern. He supposed that it only made sense that an occasional supply convoy would get through. With food running low, this resupply had been timely. The Old World was a big place. Richard knew that there was no way that the D'Haran army could cover the whole countryside. On the other hand, he wondered if the ham he was holding could be a sign that things weren't going so well for General Meiffert and the men he had taken south. Johnrock scooted closer, dragging his chain behind. \"Ruben! We get ham! Isn't that wonderful?\" \"Being free would be wonderful. Eating well as a slave is not my idea of wonderful.\" Johnrock's face sagged a little, then brightened. \"But being a slave eating ham is better than being a slave eating eggs, don't you think?\" Richard wasn't in the mood to discuss it. \"I guess you have a point.\" Johnrock grinned. \"I thought so too.\" In the gathering gloom of dusk the two of them ate in silence. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (414 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:13 PM]"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Savoring the ham, Richard had to admit to himself that Johnrock did indeed have a point.

Bruce was the new left wing man, replacing the original man, who had been killed during the game Jagang and Kahlan had been at.

In silence, he went back to eating ham. \"Why would you say that?\" Johnrock finally asked, unable to contain his annoyance. \"I wouldn't hurt a woman.\" Richard glanced over at the man's sour expression. \"What do you think of the camp followers?\" \"The camp followers?\" Johnrock, surprised by the question, scratched his shoulder as he considered. \"Most of them are ugly old hags.\" \"Well, if you aren't interested in them, then that leaves the captive women, the women taken from their homes, their families, their husbands, their children, everything they ever loved.

The ones we hear weeping.\" Johnrock's gaze fell away. He picked at his piece of ham. \"It keeps me awake, sometimes, listening to the sounds of those women sobbing.\" Richard looked out between the wagons and guards at the camp beyond. In the distance the work on the ramp continued. He imagined that the people up in the People's Palace, the last holdout against the Imperial Order, could do nothing but wait for the horde to come. There was nothing they could do. There was nowhere safe left for them to go. The beliefs driving the Imperial Order were swallowing all of mankind. Down in the encampment knots of men were gathering around cook fires. Among the shadows and gloom Richard could see a woman being dragged to a tent. She'd once had her own dreams and hope for her future; now that the Order was prescribing their vision for mankind, she was merely chattel. Already men were lining up outside, the victors waiting for their reward in return for serving the Imperial Order. Ultimately, despite all the grand pretensions, this was all that it was really about: the lust of some to rule over all others, to impose their will, the pretension of a moral licence that they believed gave them the right to take, by any means, what they wanted. In other places Richard could see men were gathered around file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (418 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 drinking and gambling. The supply train must have brought liquor. It was going to be a noisy night. Kahlan was somewhere out in that sea of men. \"Well then,\" Richard said, \"unless you want to be a party to the abuse of those women, that leaves the camp followers, who are willing.\" Johnrock thought in silence for a time as he nibbled at his ham. If quiet anger could cut steel, Richard would have his collar off and he would be doing something to get Kahlan out of this place and to safety-to what safety there was left in a world gone mad over a cause. \"You know, Ruben, you have a way of spoiling things.\" Richard glanced over at the man. \"Would you rather I lie? Make up something just to soothe your conscience?\" Johnrock sighed. \"No. But still...\" Richard realized then that he had better not discourage his right wing man or the man might very well not play his best. If they lost the next game there would be no chance to play the emperor's team and then Richard might not get a chance to see Kahlan again. \"Well, you are getting pretty famous, Johnrock. Men are beginning to cheer when they see you come on the field. It could be that there will be a lot of pretty women who will be eager to be with the big, handsome wing man on the champion team.\" Johnrock finally grinned. \"That's true. We are winning a lot of soldiers over to our side. Men are beginning to cheer for us.\" He waved his ham at Richard. \"You are the point man.

What if she wants nothing to do with you?\" Richard opened his mouth, but then closed it. Kahlan didn't know him. If he did get a chance to try to get her away from Jagang, what was he going to do if she thought he was just another stranger trying to capture her? After all, why wouldn't she? What if she wasn't willing to go along with him? What if she resisted? There would certainly be no time to try to explain things to her. Richard sighed. Now he had another thing to keep him awake with worry. CHAPTER 28 Kahlan sat quietly in the shadows to the side of the outer room in a low, leather chair, her hands nested in her lap. Jillian sat cross- legged on the floor nearby. From time to time Kahlan glanced at Sisters Ulicia and Armina as they worked at their assigned task of comparing the books that were the key to opening the boxes of Orden. They were going through each volume word by word, searching for any variance. Some of Jagang's other captive Sisters had found a third book down in the catacombs below the Palace of the Prophets, so Sisters Ulicia and Armina now had an additional copy they could check against the two books they already had-the one from the Palace of the Prophets, which Jagang had long had in his possession, and the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (420 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 one he'd found in the catacombs in Caska, where he had captured Sisters Ulicia, Armina, and Cecilia, as well as Kahlan. The books were supposed to be The Book of Counted Shadows. The titles on the spines of the latter two, however, didn't say Shadows, but instead said Shadow. There was disagreement between Sisters Ulicia and Armina if that was meaningful or not. From what Kahlan had pieced together from bits and pieces she'd overheard, there was the original of The Book of Counted Shadows, one true copy, and four false copies. Jagang now had in his possession three of those five copies. Getting their hands on all the copies was a top priority. From what Kahlan could gather, there were people whose lives were devoted solely to that task. The mystery had deepened when the book found in the recently discovered catacombs under the People's Palace had turned out to say Shadows in the title on the spine, as it was supposed to say. The titles alone would suggest that the first two were false copies- as Kahlan had said they were-and the latest one was possibly the true copy. As of yet, though, there was no way for them to prove any of it. Kahlan worried about what she would do if Jagang demanded that she rule on whether the latest find was a true copy or not. From what the Sisters had pointed out to Jagang, the books themselves said that a Confessor was needed to verify if the book was a true version or not. Kahlan had overheard that she was this person, a Confessor, but. along with the rest of her forgotten past, she didn't know what a Confessor was. She had no idea how she was supposed to be able to identify the true copy.

With the first two the title being wrong had given her a plausible reason to proclaim them false. With the latest edition, though, she would have nothing to go on, since the title was correct and the text itself could offer her no help because magic prevented her from being able to see it. With his attention focused on Nicci, Jagang hadn't asked for Kahlan's determination on the latest volume's validity. If he did, and Kahlan couldn't give him an answer that satisfied him, Jillian would be the one to pay the price. So far the Sisters had not been able to find any dissimilarities between the three copies. Of course, as they had hesitantly pointed out to the emperor, dissimilarities would prove nothing. All three could be different and still be false copies. How were they to know? There was nothing to say that the newest book, even if it turned out to be different from the other two, was a true copy. Being different, in and of itself, didn't prove anything. As far as Kahlan could see, the only real way to identify the one true copy would be if they had the original and all five copies. Despite his bluster and demands, Jagang had to know that as well. That was undoubtedly why he had people dedicated to locating the other books. Be that as it may, Jagang still wanted the books checked for any discrepancy, so the Sisters were checking-one word at a time. Jagang had given them ample time to go over the books.

Ever since Nicci had been captured he had been obsessed with her. He had not taken another woman to his bed and had even forgone the Ja'La matches. It almost seemed to Kahlan as if he thought that if he could satisfactorily demonstrate to Nicci how profound his lust for her really was, then she would be convinced of his true feelings for her, and her defiance would melt away as she was won over. For her part, Nicci had only become more detached. Her dispassionate, distant attitude strangely attracted Jagang, but her defiance provoked him to violence and only made her ordeal worse. Kahlan couldn't imagine, though, when her turn came, being anything but defiant. Several times, after a fit of wild rage, Jagang's anger had died out when he suddenly realized that he might have gone too far. On those occasions Sisters had been rushed in to try to revive Nicci. All the while as they worked desperately to save her life and heal her, Jagang paced with a worried, guilty look. Later, after she had been healed, he would regain his indignation and blame Nicci for driving him to such violence in the first place. Sometimes, like the night before, he would leave Kahlan and Jillian in the outer room while he took Nicci inside to be alone with her for the night. Kahlan supposed that such privacy was his idea of tender romance. As Nicci had been led to the bedchamber she had shared a brief, covert gaze with Kahlan. It had been a look of shared understanding of the utter madness that gripped the world. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (423 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jagang had been so distracted since having Nicci back that he had ignored just about everything else, from The Book of Counted Shadows to the Ja'La matches. Kahlan didn't like the Ja'La games, but she desperately wanted to see the man everyone called Ruben. She knew from daily reports shared between the guards that Commander Karg's team had so far won all their matches, but Kahlan wanted to see the point man with the strange designs painted on him, the man with the gray eyes, the man who knew her. \"Look here,\" Sister Ulicia said, tapping the page in one of the books. 'This formula is different from those two.\" Kahlan watched their backs as both hunched over the table, comparing the books laid open before them. Jagang's two big bodyguards standing across the room, near the entrance to the tent, also kept an eye on the Sisters. The two regular soldiers-Kahlan's special guards-didn't appear to be interested in the Sisters; they were watching Kahlan. Kahlan, her face going red when she realized what they were looking at, pulled a thick skein of hair over the view provided by the missing top button of her shirt. \"Yes . . .\" Sister Armina said in a drawl. \"The constellation is different. Isn't that odd.\" \"It certainly makes the differences difficult to spot. Not only that, but look here.

Perhaps he will uncover the other copies and then we will at last have a means to be able to tell something for certain.\" The cover over the door abruptly lifted to the side. Jagang shoved Nicci through the opening. She stumbled and fell at Kahlan's feet. The woman's eyes briefly turned up, but she pretended not to see Kahlan right there in front of her. It was a deception that had not changed since Jagang had captured her. Kahlan could see the rage in Nicci's eyes. She could see the pain, too. She could also see the desperate despair. Kahlan wanted to hold her, comfort her, and tell her that it would be all right. But she couldn't do such a thing. And, she certainly. couldn't tell her that it would be all right. \"What have you found out?\" Jagang asked the two Sisters as he stepped up behind them. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (425 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Sister Ulicia tapped one of the books.

Jagang turned his gaze on her for a moment and then, uncharacteristically, merely grunted indifferently. He glanced around, checking that Kahlan was still in the chair where he'd told her to stay. He saw, too, that Jillian was on the floor and guards were watching over all of them. \"Keep studying the books,\" Jagang told the two Sisters. \"I'm going to the Ja'La games. Watch the girl.\" He shoved Nicci out ahead of him and then snapped his fingers at Kahlan, indicating that he expected her to come along as well, and that he expected her to stay close to him. Kahlan snatched up her cloak and followed after him. She was at least glad that Jillian would not have to be anywhere near the mobs of soldiers, or Jagang. Of course, Jagang could exert his control through the Sisters and thus harm Jillian in any way he wished, anywhere he wished, any time he wished.

The girl's copper-colored eyes stared up at Kahlan as she returned a nod. She was afraid to be left alone. Kahlan sympathized, but she could offer no real protection even if Jillian was with her. Outside the tent a few hundred well-armed guards quickly assembled into ranks, ready to escort the emperor. Such big men, with chain-mail armor and gleaming weapons, were an intimidating presence. Half a dozen of Kahlan's special guards, looking somewhat less intimidating but no less brutish, formed up around her. Jagang's meaty hand gripped Nicci's slender white arm, steering her through the spaces that opened in overlapping walls of the men. Most of those men took a good long look at Nicci. She might have been Jagang's woman, but they still wanted a look. They were careful, though, to make sure that the emperor didn't see them leering. Those looks left Kahlan relieved that most of these men couldn't see her. Although it was overcast, the clouds didn't look thick enough to threaten rain. It hadn't rained in quite a while and the ground had turned to dusty hardpan. In the flat, gray light the army camp looked all the darker, all that much grimier. Smoke from cook fires hung in the air, masking the stench to a degree. As they marched through endless, noisy clusters of men and equipment, Jagang asked one of his more trusted personal guards about the Ja'La games. The man filled the emperor in on the various matches that had taken place since the last report, giving Jagang a rundown on each of the teams as he asked about them. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (427 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Karg's team?\" Jagang asked. \"Have they been doing well?\" The guard nodded. \"Undefeated so far.

This is the final game for them. With the way the matches have gone so far, if they win today then they alone will advance to the head of all the teams and you will have your wish, Excellency. If not, then there will have to be elimination games. But your team will play them if they are the winner of this match.\" As they walked, with Jagang conversing with his guard, Nicci cast a brief glance back over her shoulder at Kahlan. Kahlan knew that she was thinking about the man Kahlan had told her about. Kahlan felt a flutter of anxiety. As they took a course through the jumble of the camp in the direction the guard indicated, pushing their way through tightly packed throngs of men as they got ever closer to the Ja'La field, Kahlan could hear soldiers in the distance cheering and shouting encouragement to their favored team. Even this far back, with no chance to see the action, men waited for word on the score to be relayed back to them. There were far more spectators than Kahlan had seen at the previous games. This was obviously an important match and she could see the excitement of the crowd. When a deafening roar file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (428 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 suddenly went up she knew that one of the teams had scored. Men pushed in closer, jostling each other, eager for word on which team had scored. As the guards growled orders or shoved men, the tight press of soldiers looked over their shoulders and then reluctantly parted to let the emperor's party through. With a wedge of big guards opening a pathway, they finally made it to an area that had been roped off for the emperor next to the field. Yet more of Jagang's guards who had gone on ahead had already formed a wall to each side to keep the men back. Through the screen of spectators Kahlan caught flashes of men running across the field. The yells and shouts from the crowd made it hard for her to hear her own thoughts. She caught brief flashes of red paint. With the press of soldiers watching the game, and the wall of royal guards to each side, to say nothing of the bull of an emperor in front of her flanked by his huge personal guards, it was difficult to see anything other than short snatches of the action on the field. Another wild cry rose from the crowd as a team scored. The roar shook the ground beneath Kahlan's feet. Through the small gaps between guards, she spotted something different about this game. All the way around the edge of the field, in front of the spectators, men stood at even intervals, feet spread, hands clasped behind their backs. None wore shirts, apparently to display their powerful builds. Kahlan had rarely seen the likes of such men. Each was a huge specimen. They all looked like statues, as if they had been smelted file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (429 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 from the same iron ore and forged from ingots of white-hot steel. As Jagang moved out in front, going to the edge of the field to see what was happening, Nicci, seeing the grim men Kahlan was looking at, leaned closer. \"Jagang's team,\" she said under her breath. Kahlan understood, then, what they were doing. The winner of this match would play the emperor's team. These men were not merely there to watch the tactics of the team they would face. They were there to intimidate the men before them, the men who would win the chance to play them. It was an open threat of pain to come. Commander Karg spotted the newly arrived emperor and squeezed his way through the wall of guards. Kahlan had come to recognize the man by his unique pattern of snake-scale tattoos. He and Jagang exchanged pleasantries as cheers of encouragement went up for another play on the field. \"Your team seems to be faring well,\" Jagang said when the cheering died down a little. Commander Karg glanced back over his shoulder at Nicci like a snake considering its prey. Her glare was already on the man. His knowing gaze swept over the length of her before his attention returned to Jagang. \"Well, Excellency, despite how good my team is, I'm well aware that your team is not merely good, but unbeaten.

Karg turned once more to the emperor. \"But if they do win against your team-\" \"If they do,\" Jagang interrupted. Karg smiled as he bowed his head. \"If they do, then it would be a great accomplishment for a humble challenger, such as myself.\" Jagang viewed his commander with good-natured suspicion. \"A great accomplishment worthy of a great reward?\" Karg gestured out at the men on the field. \"Well, Excellency, if my team were to win each of them would have a reward. Each would have the woman of his choice.\" He clasped his hands behind his back as he shrugged. \"It seems only right that as the one who handpicked each player and runs such an accomplished team I would have a similar reward.\" Jagang's deep chuckle was so lewd that it gave Kahlan a shiver. \"I suppose you're right,\" Jagang said. \"Name her, then, and if you win, she is yours.\" Karg rocked on his heels a moment, as if considering his choices. \"Excellency, if my team wins\"-Commander Karg turned a sly smile back over his shoulder-\"I would like to have Nicci in my bed.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (431 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci's cold glare could have cut steel.

The spectators, seeing the guards' ill humor, reluctantly moved back. As Jagang and Commander Karg watched the game, becoming completely absorbed by the action of the field, Kahlan checked on her special guards and saw that they, too, were getting caught up in the game. They kept moving up, a little at a time, craning their necks, trying to get a better view. Kahlan edged closer to Nicci. As the royal guards put muscle in their effort and moved the spectators back, it gave Kahlan and Nicci a wider angle of view so that they could see more of both the field and the players. \"The team with the red paint is run by the man I told you about,\" Kahlan whispered. \"I think he painted himself and all his men with the red paint so that no one would recognize him.\" As players ran past they got their first clear view of the wild designs painted on all the men of the red team. When Nicci saw those designs, she looked startled. \"Dear spirits . . .\" She took a step forward to get a better look.

When she saw him, the blood drained from her face. Kahlan had never seen anyone go so ashen so fast. \"Richard...\" The instant Kahlan heard the name she knew it was right. The name fih the man. She didn't know why, but it just fit him. There was no doubt in her mind that Nicci was right. His name was not Ruben, it was Richard. She felt a strange sense of relief just to know his name, to know his real name. Kahlan, fearing that Nicci might faint, put a supporting hand to the small of the woman's back. Beneath that hand she could feel Nicci's whole body trembling. Dodging men as he ran headlong up the field, his wing men to each side, the man she now knew was named Richard saw Jagang out of the corner of his eye. As he ran, his gaze swept behind the emperor and met Kahlan's gaze. The connection, that recognition in his eyes, lifted her heart. When Richard spotted Nicci standing next to her, he missed a step.

As the opponent tumbled down to the side, Richard finally began to move. Seeing men flying past above him, he rolled away from the battle as he caught his breath. In a moment he was on his feet, if somewhat wobbly at first. It was the first mistake Kahlan had ever seen the man make. Nicci's lower lip trembled as she stood frozen, staring at Richard. Tears ud welled up in her blue eyes. Kahlan suddenly wondered if it could be. She discounted the possibility. It simply wasn't possible.

But if it broke Richard's heart to see Nicci with the gold ring of a slave through her lower lip, once again the captive of a man who had abused her so terribly in the past, it made his blood boil to see Kahlan also a captive of that same man.

He would do anything to save her, to return her to who she really was, to give her back her life-to have her back in his. But who she was, was no longer there, within her. Chainfire had taken everything from them both. It didn't really matter how much he wanted to live his own life with Kahlan, or how much he wanted other people to be able to live their own lives. The people of the Imperial Order had their own designs for mankind. Right then, Richard could see only a bleak future. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Johnrock scooting toward him. The heavy chain clattered as the big man pulled it across the hard, rocky ground. \"Ruben, you need to eat.\" \"I did eat.\" Johnrock gestured to the half-eaten piece of ham balancing on Richard's knee. \"Only half. You need your strength for tomorrow's game. You should eat.\" Thinking about what was going to happen the next day only further served to tighten Richard's stomach with anxiety.

After he swallowed, he nudged Richard with an elbow. \"Are you all right, Ruben?\" Richard sighed. \"I'm a prisoner, Johnrock. How could I be fine?\" Johnrock grinned, thinking Richard was just being funny.

I will protect you, Ruben.\" Richard couldn't help smiling with his big wing man. \"Thanks, Johnrock. I know you will. You always do.\" \"Bruce will, too.\" Richard suspected he very well might. The man was an Imperial Order soldier, but he was also a member of a powerful team with a reputation- Ruben's team, as most of his men called it. They didn't call it that in front of Commander Karg, though. The spectators called them the red team, and Commander Karg called it his team, but among themselves the players called it \"Ruben's team.\" He was their point man. They had come to trust him. Bruce, like some of the other soldiers on the team, had at first been reluctant to wear the symbols in red paint, but now he wore them proudly.

Richard tossed the stone away and leaned back on his hands as Commander Karg came to a halt right above him. Dust rose around the man's boots. He glared down at Richard as he planted his fists on his hips. \"What was that all about today, Ruben?\" Richard peered up at the tattoos of snake scales that were just still visible in the fading light. \"You didn't appreciate that we won?\" Instead of answering, the commander turned the glare on Johnrock. Johnrock got the message and scooted away, back past the opposite end of the wagon, until he reached the end of his chain tether and could go no farther.

You lose tomorrow and you will have the death you should have had after you killed all of those men of mine.\" Commander Karg's sly smile returned. \"But if you win, you will have your choice of a woman, as promised.\" Richard met the man's gaze with a glare. \"I already promised that I would do my best tomorrow.

Even in the dead of night the camp was alive with sound and activity. Everywhere, it seemed, there were men yelling, laughing, and swearing. Metal clanged, horses whinnied, and mules brayed. In the distance Richard could see the ramp, along with lines of men and wagons, lit by torches. Even in the middle of the night the construction continued without pause. But none of that was what had awakened him. Something closer in had caught his attention. He saw shadows slipping through the ring of guards and the circle of low supply wagons that marked out his prison. He counted four of the dark figures stealing silently through the darkness. A quick check to the sides revealed another off to the right. He wondered if they had really snuck through unseen or if the guards had allowed them to pass. By their size, Richard knew who they were. After what Commander Karg had told him about his bet with Jagang, Richard had been expecting visitors. It was the last thing he needed, but it wasn't like he had any choice in the matter. What really worried him was that, chained to the wagon, his options were limited. He could hardly hide. He certainly couldn't run. Fighting five men, maybe more, was not something he wanted to have to do before the game the next day. He couldn't afford to be injured-least of all now.

Calling out to his sleeping wing man would cost Richard the only thing he had going for him: surprise. The men coming for him thought he was asleep. For all Richard knew, if he called out to Johnrock the five might first go over and cut Johnrock's throat so that they could go to work on Richard without worry of interruption. The four big men slipped in close, forming a semicircle. They obviously knew that his chain would keep him from escaping, and blocking him would keep him from having room to maneuver. By how quiet they were being, they appeared to still think he was asleep. One of the men, arms straight out to each side for balance, took a long step in and threw a kick at Richard's head as if he were kicking the broc in an effort to keep it away from an opponent. Richard was ready. He rolled to the side and then whipped the length of chain around the man's ankle. With all his might he yanked back the chain. It pulled the man's feet out from under him. He landed on his back with a heavy thud, banging his head on the ground. \"On your feet,\" one of the other men growled now that he knew Richard was awake. Richard gripped a folded length of chain on the ground behind him, keeping it out of sight, but he didn't get up. \"Or?\" he asked. \"Or we kick your head in where you sit.

That tells me a lot. It should tell you something, too-that we're better than you and you can't win in a fair match. Jagang knows it as well, that's why he sent you-because you're not good enough to beat us at Ja'La.\" As another man, cursing under his breath at the delay, reached out to grab him, Richard swung the looped section of chain from behind his back as hard as he could. It caught the man square in the side of his face. He spun away, crying out from the unexpected shock of pain. As a third man charged in, Richard dropped back onto his shoulders. With all his strength he kicked up into the center of the man's gut, using the man's falling weight against him. The blow rammed the man back at the same time as it drove the wind from his lungs. The first man was already on his feet again. The man who had taken the chain across his face was still writhing on the ground. The other, holding an arm across his middle, rolled to his feet, catching his breath, eager for revenge.

There were too many hands grabbing for the chain all at once for Richard to keep them from getting ahold of it. As he tried to whip it out of their reach, one of the men lunged and managed to capture the heavy links in both hands. Richard swung his leg around, knocking one of the remaining men's feet out from under him. He landed heavily on a shoulder. The other two seized the chain and then grunted with mighty effort as they yanked it back. The slack in the chain snapped taut. The sudden jerk felt like it might rip Richard's head off as it flung him sprawling on his face. The choking pain in his throat was so severe that for a second he thought the iron collar might have crushed his windpipe. While Richard was momentarily stunned, fighting the rising sense of panic, one of the men kicked him in the ribs. The blow felt like it might have broken a rib. Richard tried to spin away but they again yanked the chain back from the other direction, twisting the iron collar around his neck and flipping him over backward. The iron burned as it bit into his flesh. The guards in the distance remained where they were, watching. They would not be eager to get involved. After all, these were men from the emperor's team.

A boot came down toward his face. Richard turned his head aside just in time. Dust and dirt flew. Fists and boots came crashing in from all directions. Holding the chain with one hand, Richard used his other to knock one man back. He blocked the punch from another and elbowed a third in the thigh, momentarily dropping the man to a knee. Still, as fast as he could block or escape their blows, yet more rained in. With the men holding tension on the chain he couldn't maneuver and he dared not let go of the chain altogether. Richard pulled himself into a defensive crouch, protecting his midsection, making himself as small a target as he could, getting as much of a lead in the chain as he could. One of the men cocked an arm and threw a punch. Richard let go of the chain and used his left forearm to deflect the blow. At the same time he sprang up inside the man's defenses and rammed an elbow up into the attacker's jaw with bone-cracking force. The man staggered back. Now that he had a little more slack in the chain, Richard ducked under a punch and kicked sideways into the man's knee. The blow did enough damage to draw a cry of pain and cause the man to start to hobble back to get out of danger, but Richard immediately used the opportunity to kick the side of the man's other knee, folding his legs under.

Richard deflected it across, past his face, then, as the man quickly punched with the other fist, Richard deflected the arm in the opposite direction, over the attacker's other arm. With the man's arms crossed and tension on the elbow preventing any escape, Richard used the leverage on the crooked arm to flip the big man over. Even with the success he was having, it was difficult to fight the men off, because the chain around his neck prevented him from moving effectively. He knew, though, that, despite the difficulty, he had no choice but to think of what he could do, not what he couldn't do. It was also difficult for Richard to fight the men because he dared not use the kinds of blows he would have liked to do. If he killed any of the emperor's players it would, in all likelihood, be an excuse for Jagang to charge Richard with murder and have him put to death. Jagang hardly needed an excuse to execute a man, but Richard's team was becoming well known and if Richard was executed the soldiers in the camp would suspect that it was because Jagang knew his team couldn't beat Richard's team. Richard doubted that Jagang cared a great deal about what anyone said, but the excuse of murder would certainly give him justification. If Commander Karg's point man was dead, Jagang wouldn't have to worry about losing Nicci to him. Jagang's team was formidable, and stood a good chance of winning, but without Richard as point man there was no doubt that the emperor's team would be file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (449 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 victorious. At the same time, Jagang might not need to bother having Richard executed. His men seemed intent on accomplishing the task themselves. They wouldn't be punished if they killed Richard in a fight. Who with any authority would ever even know, except Commander Karg, and Richard didn't think that even Karg would dare to make an issue of a captive man dying in a fight. Men in the camp died in fights all the time. Such fights were common enough and, as far as Richard knew, only rarely punished. This would just be passed off as an argument gone bad. Worse, though, if Richard was killed then Kahlan would have no chance. She would be forever lost to the Chainfire spell, a living phantom of her former self. That thought alone made Richard fight with a fury, even if he had to be careful to strike with the intent of stopping rather than killing. Pulling blows wasn't at all easy to do in the heat of a fight for his own life and Richard was taking nearly as much punishment as he was dealing out. When one of the men again threw a punch, Richard seized the man's arm. Grunting with the effort, he ducked under the extended arm, twisting it around, and flipped the man to the ground. As Richard himself was knocked to the ground, he scooped up a length of chain and spun, whipping it across the face of one of the men. The sound of steel against flesh and bone was sickening.

Life and death were the reality that counted, not how someone followed a prescribed set of rules. If you died because you failed to protect yourself, you couldn't cry foul after you were dead. You had to fight for your own life, fight to win, no matter the circumstances. Commander Karg stood. \"Get some rest-both of you. Tomorrow decides if you live or if you die.\" The man headed for the ring of guards, yelling at them as he went. \"Thanks, Johnrock,\" Richard said after the commander had gone. \"You showed up just in time.\" \"I told you that I'd watch out for you.\" \"You did good, Johnrock.\" Johnrock grinned. \"You just do good tomorrow. Eh, Ruben?\" Richard nodded as he gulped air. \"I promise.\" CHAPTER 31 file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (453 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Verna glanced up when the Mord-Sith marched up to the other side of the small desk and came to a halt. \"What is it, Cara?\" \"Any word in the journey book?\" Verna sighed heavily as she set down the watch reports she had been studying. They indicated that there was increasing activity surrounding the Ja'La matches down in the Order's encampment. Verna remembered what seemed like a lifetime ago, back at the Palace of the Prophets, when Warren had first told her all about Ja'La Day, about how Emperor Jagang was bringing Ja'La dh Jin to all of the Old World. Like so many things, Warren had studied Ja'La dh Jin and knew a great deal about it. She supposed that she wasn't so much reading the reports as she was reminiscing about Warren. How she missed him. How she missed so many people who had been lost in this war. \"No, I'm afraid not,\" Verna said. \"I left a message in the journey book in case Ann should happen to take a look in hers, but she hasn't answered, yet.\" Cara tapped an insistent finger on the desktop. \"It's obvious that something has happened to Nicci and Ann.\" \"I don't disagree.\" Verna spread her hands. \"But we can't do anything about it if we don't even know what happened to them.

She mulled over the situation for a moment, then turned back to Verna. \"I still think that whatever happened had to have happened the night they went down to the tomb.\" \"I'm not saying that you're wrong, Cara, but we're not even sure that they ever made it down to the tombs. What if they changed their mind for some reason and went somewhere else first? What if someone brought a message or something to Ann, and they rushed off somewhere else? What if something happened before they even went down to the tomb? \"I don't think so,\" Cara said as she folded her arms and paced. \"I still think something down there is wrong. Something down in the tombs just feels wrong.\" Verna didn't question what could be \"wrong.\" She had already done that to no avail. Cara didn't know what was wrong. She simply had a vague feeling that something was not right down in the tombs. \"Your feeling doesn't give us much to go on.

Darken Rahl had people who took care of the tombs- took care of his father's tomb, anyway.\" \"What's this about the tombs?\" Berdine asked as she strolled into the room. Nyda, a tall, blond, blue-eyed Mord-Sith, was with her. Verna saw Adie bringing up the rear. \"It just occurred to me that the crypt staff would know about the tombs,\" Cara said. Berdine nodded. \"You're probably right. Some of the writing down in the tombs is in High D'Haran, so Darken Rahl sometimes took me with him down there to help him with things he was having difficulty translating. \"Darken Rahl was quite picky about how his father's tomb was cared for.

They had to be pure white. He also demanded that the torches always be kept burning. The crypt staff was not suppose to allow a rose petal to remain on the floor, or a torch that went out to go cold without being replaced with a fresh, burning one. \"If Darken Rahl was visiting his father's crypt and he saw a rose petal on the floor, or if one of the torches burned out, he would get furious. People on the crypt staff were beheaded for such infractions, so, as you can imagine, they were quite attentive to their duties down there. They would be familiar with the place.\" \"Then we need to go have a talk with the crypt staff,\" Verna said. \"You can try,\" Berdine said, \"but I don't think they will have much to say.\" Verna stood. \"Why not?\" \"Darken Rahl feared that they might speak ill of his dead father while down in the crypt\"-Berdine made a snipping motion with two fingers- \"so he had their tongues cut out.\" \"Dear Creator,\" Verna muttered as she touched her fingers to her forehead. \"That man was a monster.\" \"Darken Rahl is long dead,\" Cara said, \"but the crypt staff must still be around.

She will probably be safer than any of us here. When that army down there finally gets in the palace, it's going to be anything but safe in here. It's going to be one long bloody nightmare.\" Adie smiled as she reached out and touched Berdine's cheek. \"The good spirits will watch over you, child, and all those here.\" Verna wished she believed that. She wondered what she was doing being the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light if she didn't. CHAPTER 32 As he finished touching up their red battle paint, Richard tried not to let the men see how painful his injuries really were. He didn't want any-thing to distract them from the job ahead. His ankle throbbed, his left shoulder was sore, and the hits he'd taken to his head had left his neck muscles aching. After the brief but furious fight he hadn't been able to get much sleep. As far as he could tell, though, nothing was broken. He mentally set the pain and weariness aside. It didn't matter if he hurt, or if he was tired. He had a job to do. It only mattered if he did it, if he succeeded. If he failed he would have all eternity to sleep. \"Today we have our chance for glory,\" Johnrock said. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (462 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard, holding Johnrock's chin, turned the man's head to the side a little so that he could see better in the failing light. He didn't say anything. He leaned to the side and dunked his finger in the bucket of red paint and then added a symbol for watchfulness above the one for power that was already there. He wished he knew a symbol for common sense so he could paint it all over Johnrock's skull. \"Don't you think, Ruben?\" Johnrock pressed. \"Today we have our chance for glory?\" The rest of the men all listened quietly for what Richard might say. \"You know better, Johnrock. Get those thoughts out of your head.\" Richard paused in his work and swept the finger, coated in fresh red paint, around at all the eyes watching him. \"All of you know better, or at least you should. Forget thoughts of glory. Those men on the emperor's team aren't thinking of glory right now- they're thinking of killing you. Do you understand that? They want to kill you. \"This is a day we have to fight to stay alive. That's the glory I want: life. That's the glory I want for all of you. I want you to live.\" Johnrock's face twisted in disbelief. \"But Ruben, after those men tried to bash in your head last night you must want to settle the score.\" The men all knew about the attack. Johnrock had told them all about it-told them how their point man had fought off five of the big men all by himself. Richard hadn't disputed the account, but he wasn't letting on as to how much he hurt. He wanted them worrying about their own necks, not wondering if he could hold up file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (463 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 his end. \"Yes, I want to win,\" Richard said, \"but not for glory, or to settle a score. I'm a captive. I was brought here to play. If we win I live- simple as that. That's all that really matters: living. Ja'La players- both captives and soldiers-die in games all the time; in that sense we are equals. The only true glory in winning in these games is the part about living.\" Some of the other captive men nodded their understanding. \"Aren't you just a little worried about defeating the emperor's team?\" Bruce, his left wing man, asked. \"Beating the emperor's team might not be the right thing to do. After all, they represent the power of the Imperial Order, and the emperor. Beating them might be seen as prideful and arrogant, even sacrilegious.\" All eyes turned to Richard. Richard met the man's gaze. \"I thought that under the Order's teachings everyone was equal.\" Bruce stared back a moment. A smile finally spread across his face. \"You have a point, Ruben. They are just men, like us. I guess we ought to win, then.\" \"I guess so,\" Richard said. At that, just as Richard had taught them, the men, as one, let out a collective bellow of agreement, a brief, deep roar of team spirit. It was a small thing, but it served to bond the men, to make them feel that, while they were all very different individuals, they all had a common goal. \"Now,\" Richard went on, \"we haven't seen the emperor's team file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (464 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 play, so we don't know their tactics, but they've watched us play.

That's going to be one of our advantages. \"Remember the new plays we devised for each signal. Don't fall back to the old plays for a signal or it will cross us up. Those new tactics are our best chance to keep them off balance. Concentrate on doing your part in each of those moves.

These men are different. They know that if they lose they will be put to death, just like the emperor's last team was when they lost. They have no incentive to play clean. They have every incentive to try to tear our heads off. \"There is no doubt in my mind that they're going to try to take out our players, so be ready for it.\" \"You're the one they're going to be trying to take down,\" Bruce pointed out. \"You're the point man. You're the one they need to stop. They even tried to eliminate you last night before you could reach the Ja'La field.\" \"That's all true, but as point man I at least have you and Johnrock protecting me.

It sounded like the entire camp was chanting. Richard suspected that every man not forced to work on the ramp, while if not all able to actually see the match, would probably at least be waiting for word to relay back to them. More men than usual were going to be able to see this game because the emperor had directed the work gangs, who needed material for the ramp anyway, to scoop dirt from a large area to create a bowl in the Azrith Plain. The new Ja'La field, with its vast, gently sloped sides, would enable far more men than ever before to be able to watch Ja'La games. Richard had thought that their game with the emperor's team would have been held that afternoon, that it would have already taken place, but the day had worn on as other teams played in games leading up to the match for the championship. The games, after all, were show for the soldiers. The new Ja'La field was the emperor's statement-right below the People's Palace-that the Order was here to stay and now owned the place. Richard glanced up at the iron gray overcast. The last feathery violets of the sunset had vanished. It was going to be a dark night. Richard hadn't counted on it being this late when the game started, but night suited him just fine. In fact, it was the one unexpected bit of good fortune in the face of the monumental obstacles that lay before him. He was used to the dark.

Sometimes it was just stars. Richard was comfortable in darkness. There was more to seeing than just using one's eyes. While in some ways those times in the woods seemed like only days ago, in other ways it also seemed like forever ago, almost like another life. He was a long way from his Hartland woods. A long way from the peace and security he had known. A long way from having the woman he loved back in his arms. As Richard was finishing with Johnrock's paint, he spotted Commander Karg making his way through the ring of guards. After their complicity in the treachery of the night before, the men involved stayed well clear of the scowling officer. There were a few new faces among the guards, no doubt more trusted overseers. Commander Karg was leading an escort of troops, men dedicated to watching over the captive players to make sure that they played Ja'La and nothing more. Mostly, though, the soldiers were there to watch over Richard. They were his special guards. Last in line to be freed from his bonds, Richard was finally able to rub his sore neck after Commander Karg finally unlocked his iron collar. Without the heavy chain weighing him down, Richard felt light, almost as if he might float up into the air. It gave him a feeling of being weightless and inhumanly fast. He embraced the sensation, making it part of him. The chanting of the soldiers in the distance had a primeval feel to it. It was beyond eerie. It gave Richard goose bumps. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (467 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The spectators were expecting blood. This night, they were going to get their wish. As he followed Commander Karg, leading his team toward the Ja'La field, Richard put the growing noise out of his mind. He found a quiet center of focus. As they moved through passages in the encampment lined with throngs of soldiers, hands all around reached out, wanting to touch the members of the team as they passed. Some of the men on Richard's team smiled, waved, and touched the extended hands of the soldiers. Johnrock, being the biggest man and easy to spot, was the center of much of the attention. He grinned, waved, shook hands, and soaked it all in as he marched along. It seemed to Richard that what Johnrock had always wanted more than anything else was the adoration of the crowd. He loved pleasing them. Words of both encouragement and hatred cascaded in from all sides. Richard turned his eyes ahead, ignoring the soldiers and shouting as he passed. \"Are you nervous, Ruben?\" Commander Karg asked over his shoulder. \"Yes.\" Karg gave him a patronizing smile. \"That will go away when it starts.\" \"I know,\" Richard said as he glared out from under his brow.

In time with the chanting the throng stamped a foot. The deep, primordial noise could be not only heard, but felt in the ground beneath Richard's feet, almost like rolling thunder. The effect was deafening and, in a way, intoxicating. It was a primal call to violence. Richard was already lost to those feelings. He let the raw, savage sounds feed those passions he had already unleashed within himself. As he made his way through the seething masses of men, he was in his own private world, lost to inner drives. Commander Karg brought the team to a halt at one end of the field just before the torches. Richard saw archers, with arrows nocked, stationed all around the field. Near midfield, to his right, he spotted the area reserved for the emperor. Jagang wasn't there. Richard's insides tightened with a knot of panic. He had thought that, surely, Jagang would be at this game, that Kahlan would be near. But the roped-off section was vacant. Richard schooled his emotions, setting aside his dismay. Jagang would not miss this game. Sooner or later he would show up. When the emperor's team strode onto the opposite end of the field the crowd erupted in a thunderous roar.

Many regarded the team as a tangible representation of their own power and virility. As Richard and his men waited outside the torches, the other team, looking not merely determined but dangerous, stalked around the perimeter of the field, acknowledging the roar of the crowd with nothing more than bloodthirsty looks. The crowd loved such a visage of hate and menace, of things to come. When the emperor's team finished circling the field and finally gathered toward the other side of the field to wait for the challengers, the archers and other dedicated guards parted. Commander Karg waved Richard and his team through the gap in the line. As Richard passed, the commander whispered a warning to Richard that he had better win. Richard stepped out onto the field. His concern for his plan was eased when the resounding cheers for his team were nearly as deafening as they had been for the emperor's team. In the many games they had played since coming to the Imperial Order's encampment, Richard's team had won every game, and in so doing the respect of many. It didn't hurt that Richard was well known for having killed an opposing point man. Probably even more than that, though, was the sight of the team covered with frightening designs in red paint. It was theater that fit the games. Richard was counting on that support. He was also troubled when he finally got a good look at all of his opponents. They were some of the biggest men Richard had ever seen. They reminded him of Egan and Ulic, the personal guards to file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (470 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 the Lord Rahl. It occurred to Richard that he could use Egan and Ulic right about then. Leaving his men gathered at the end of the field, Richard crossed the empty ground alone to the referee at center field with the fistful of straws. The point man for the emperor's team waiting beside the referee looked to be nearly a foot taller than Richard. His neck started at his ears and just kept getting wider until it met shoulders half again as wide as Richard's. A neat row of red, swollen marks running diagonally up along the side of his face recorded where the links of the chain had caught him. As Richard waited, the towering point man, glaring at Richard the entire time, drew a straw first. When Richard drew, he came up with a shorter straw. The onlookers roared their approval that the emperor's team would have the first chance to score. The man shot Richard a smirk before taking the broc and heading to his side of the field. As Richard returned to his players waiting at their end of the field, his gaze swept over the endless masses of men, fists raised in wild emotion, all wanting the blood of either one side or the other. Men with arrows at the ready watched Richard's solitary walk back to his team. He could feel the fevered emotions of hundreds of thousands of men all pressing in, trying to see what would happen- men who had gotten where they were by trampling over endless corpses of innocent men, women, and children who had only wanted to live their own lives, to better themselves and their families. Richard felt caught up in a world gone mad. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (471 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 His gaze passed over the empty space where the emperor was supposed to be. Where Kahlan was supposed to be. Without Kahlan, even a Kahlan who didn't know him, the world was a cold and empty place. Right then, Richard felt very small and alone. In a numb haze, he took his place in the line with his men. When the horn blew and the enemy, bunched together in a tight formation, started coming, being down in the bowl of the Ja'La field was like standing in a valley, watching an avalanche descending on him. Right then, in that moment of desolation, Richard didn't know what he would do. The collision was brutal. Gritting his teeth with the effort, he tried to turn the men protecting their point man, but they plowed right through Richard and his team. With little ceremony their point man reached the scoring zone and threw the broc. Defenders painted with red symbols leaped to try to deflect the throw, but the attackers rolled over them. The broc landed solidly in the net, scoring the first point. The crowd erupted with a deafening roar of approval. Richard had just learned something. The emperor's team appeared to rely on their superior size and weight to grind their way through their opponents' defense. They had no real need for finesse. He gave his men a stealthy hand signal as the other team formed up for their second charge. When they came, all of Richard's team hooked across the blocking line, using low tackles to take the legs out from under the big men file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (472 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 in the center. It wasn't elegant, but it served the purpose of opening a hole. Before the hole could close, Richard was through. The point man didn't deviate course, confident in his size to smash Richard out of his way. Richard pivoted, abruptly cutting across the front of the man, sweeping a leg at his ankles. As the man stumbled to maintain his balance, Richard snatched the broc out from his arms when they loosened in a natural reaction to falling face-first. Richard dodged and darted his way through a loose line of men. As yet more men converged on him, he tossed the broc to Johnrock, already positioned behind the line of men. To the wild cheers of his supporters, Johnrock briefly held up the broc for all to see as he ran from a clutch of pursuers. Johnrock, enjoying the moment, turned backward as he ran so he could laugh at the men chasing him, then threw the broc over their heads to Richard. Men dove in from every direction as Richard caught the broc. He twisted away from one man, dodged another, and pushed himself away from a third, reversing direction wildly in an effort to keep from the clutches of the big men. Despite his own players tackling men, or blocking them out of Richard's way, the opponents closed in all around. As Richard tried to miss one man, another seized him around his shoulders and, as if he were a small child, tossed him to the ground. Richard knew that he wasn't going to be able to keep the broc from these men, and he didn't want them all piling on top of him and breaking his bones, so as soon as he hit the ground he heaved the broc.

They had scored a point, and Richard was fortunate to have kept them from getting two. As he trotted to his side of the field, he reprimanded himself for letting his feelings get the better of him. He wasn't paying enough attention. His mind wasn't in what he was doing. He was going to get himself killed. He couldn't do anything to help Kahlan unless he shaped up. His men were panting, most resting by leaning over with their hands on their knees. They looked despondent. \"All right,\" Richard said as he reached them, \"we've let them have their moment of glory. Now let's take them down.\" That brought grins all around. All the men brightened at his words. As Richard caught the broc when the referee tossed it his way, he glanced around at his men. \"Let's show them who they're dealing with. Play one-three then reverse it.\" He quickly showed them one finger, then three, in case they couldn't hear him over all the noise. \"Go.\" As one the men broke into a dead ran, immediately clustering into a knot of men around Richard. No blockers went out front, no wing men went to the sides. Instead, all the men compacted together into as tight of a formation as they could and still be able to run at full speed.

Moments from impact, as the defenders reached that spot, Richard's entire team suddenly broke in every direction at once. It was such a startling move that the other players faltered, turning one way, then the other, unsure what to do as the men they were about to clobber were unexpectedly bolting every which way. Each of Richard's men ran in a crazy zigzag course that appeared to have no rhyme or reason. The men on Jagang's team didn't know who to grab, who to chase, or where they were going. In an instant, the massive, focused charge had scattered like so many fireflies. The crowd roared with delighted laughter. Richard ran a wild course the same as the other men, except he was the one with the broc. By the time that fact sank in for the other team, Richard was already around most of them and deep into enemy territory. As two of the blockers went after him he ran for his life. When he reached the scoring zone he heaved the broc. As soon as it left his fingers he was hit from behind, but it was too late to stop the throw. The broc sailed into the goal. Richard hit the ground with a man atop him. It was fortunate that the man had been running at full speed because his momentum tumbled him over Richard's back. Richard scrambled to his feet and trotted back toward his side of the field to the wild cheers of the crowd. The score was tied, but he wasn't interested in a tie. He needed to press the advantage.

He needed to complete it. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (475 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 His men, all smiles, gathered as quickly as possible.

Again, they formed into a tight formation as they charged across the field. This time, though, Jagang's team, as they raced to meet them, scattered at the last minute, ready this time to intercept all the men as they tried to take off in every direction. The crowd cheered and screamed their approval. Rather than break apart, though, Richard's team remained tightly packed together as they charged right up the middle of the field. The few dispersed players left within range to intercept them were mowed down by the full weight of the team. The minor defense of first two, followed by a third defender, didn't slow Richard's men at all. The other team, suddenly realizing what was happening, took up the pursuit. They were too late. Richard steered his men to the right goal. As he reached the scoring zone and his men fell back into a protective shield, Richard threw the broc. He watched it in the torchlight as it arced through the night air and then went in. The crowd erupted in cheering. The horn blew, signaling the end of the play. The referee at center field announced the score, one for the champions-Jagang's team-and two for the challengers.

As everyone waited, the referee went to the sideline and listened to the emperor a moment. He nodded and returned to center field, where he announced that the second score was ruled to have gone in after the horn blew, so it didn't count. The score, the referee announced in a loud voice, was tied. Part of the crowd yelled in anger, while others screamed with joy at their fortune. Richard's men started shouting angry objections, disputing the call. Richard strode in front of them. The noise of the uproar of the crowd was so loud that he feared his men wouldn't be able to hear him, so he pulled a thumb across his throat, cutting off their objections. \"You can't change it!\" he yelled at them. \"Settle down! Focus!\" They stopped protesting but they weren't happy. Richard wasn't, either, but he knew that he couldn't do anything about it. It had been the order of the emperor, after all, that had reversed their goal. Richard was going to have to alter his plans. \"We need to stop these men,\" he said as he paced in front of his team. \"When it's our turn again, go to play two-five.\" He showed them first two fingers, then five.

They were still angry but now they were ready to focus that anger on the other team. The charge by the emperor's team was sloppy. They were still caught up in the jubilation over their reversal of fortune. In a bone- crushing impact their point man was shaken by a coordinated block. Richard was proud of his men for the way they turned their anger around and made use of it. In the furious struggle after the collision Johnrock came up with the broc. He tossed it to Bruce when the men chasing him got close. Bruce in turn passed the broc to Richard. Richard ran up the field and, to the delight of the crowd, used all his strength to throw from the two-point line. The broc went in. It didn't count, of course, but the crowd roared as if it had. The cheers shook the ground. It was vindication for the stolen goal. It was as close to snubbing his nose at Jagang as Richard could come. Their supporters in the crowd started chanting, \"Four to one! Four to one! Four to one!\" The score was still officially one to one, but in the view of those who were cheering it was now four to one. On their next charge, when the point man for the emperor's team ran into the scoring zone and threw the broc, one of Richard's men leaped up high and managed to deflect the broc just enough to cause it to go wide and miss the goal.

The man caught his legs in a viselike grip. As Richard hit the ground, he tossed the broc in Johnrock's direction. Johnrock scooped it up just before a man on the other team was able to grab it. Johnrock reached the scoring zone and threw. From the ground Richard watched as the broc went into the net, scoring a point. Johnrock, overjoyed, waved both hands high in the air as he jumped up and down like a boy. The crowd loved it. Richard couldn't help smiling as he untangled himself from his tackier, who delivered a painful punch in Richard's back just before parting. Richard didn't take the bait. He knew better than to let himself be drawn into a fight when the broc wasn't in play. As he caught up with Johnrock and they ran together back toward the starting zone for their next run, Richard clapped his wing man on the shoulder. \"You did good, Johnrock,\" Richard yelled over the cheering. \"I brought us glory!\" Richard couldn't help laughing. \"Glory,\" he agreed as he again clapped Johnrock on the back. \"And a point that counts.\" As they formed up while waiting for the referee to deliver the broc, all of the men shouted their congratulations to a beaming Johnrock.

As they charged up the field, the emperor's team started going to Richard's left, as he wanted, but at the last moment they hooked and crashed through the center of the heaviest part of the wedge. Such a tactic would not stop Richard or get them the broc. They were after something else. Richard knew there was going to be trouble when tacklers leaped over the forward blockers. \"Johnrock!\" Richard yelled. \"Cut right!\" Johnrock, instead, dropped his big shoulder into the teeth of the attack. Three tacklers dove low. The fourth hooked an arm around Johnrock's neck. A fifth man, racing at full speed, hit him from the side, applying force to the fulcrum at Johnrock's neck. Richard felt like he was in a dream and couldn't make his legs move fast enough. Even as he was running with all his strength, he could hear bone break. CHAPTER 33 Her heart heavy, Kahlan watched as Richard knelt beside his fallen right wing man. The horn blew. The men from Jagang's team quickly left their victim slumped on his side to return to their end of the field to be ready to defend. \"Is he dead?\" Jillian asked.

If he didn't go back to play immediately he would be ejected for delaying the game. Referee's assistants quickly set to work dragging the lifeless form of the big man off the field. Kahlan could hear Jagang, half a dozen paces ahead of her, chuckle. Nicci, at his side, briefly glanced back over her shoulder. Kahlan didn't quite know what to make of the liquid look in her blue eyes. It seemed part sadness for Richard, part bottled rage, and, somehow, part warning to Kahlan. Kahlan hadn't been able to speak with Nicci again since that night after she had been so terribly hurt. Ever since Jagang had made his bet with Commander Karg he had been moody and short-tempered. Last evening, as Nicci waited in the bedchamber and Kahlan waited in the outer room of his tent, he'd met outside with some of the members of his team. Kahlan hadn't heard everything, but it had sounded like he had given them orders that he wanted them to see to it that the point man for Karg's team didn't cause them any trouble. Kahlan had had a sleepless night, worried that Richard might not live to see morning. Whatever had been planned had Jagang in a lusty mood for Nicci. Kahlan and Jillian had been ordered to stay where they were on the floor in the outer room. He wanted to be alone with his Slave Queen, as he called her. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (481 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan hadn't known what Jagang was doing to her. No matter what he was doing to her, Nicci never screamed. In his bed she always seemed to simply go numb, staring unblinking at nothing in this world as he went about his business. Kahlan understood what Nicci was doing. It was the only defense she had. As she drew inward, her outward indifference was her protection for her sanity. It would do her no good to let herself pay attention to everything that the brute was doing to her. On the other hand, her indifference enraged Jagang, often sending him into fits of violence. Kahlan wondered if, when he started in on her, she would have the strength Nicci had. That morning, Kahlan had wondered if the Sisters were going to have to be called yet again to save Nicci, or to heal her at least. When Jagang had emerged from the bedchamber, though, he had Nicci by her hair. He tossed her to the floor in front of him, looking pleased with himself, with her helplessness. Kahlan had been relieved that, while she looked a bit battered and bruised, at least she hadn't appeared grievously injured. Out on the field Richard's team gathered, preparing for the next play. Kahlan glanced around as legions of men still cheered their satisfaction at the man's death. Others, though, yelled in anger, shaking fists at the emperor's team.

It had started to change when Jagang had intervened over the last point Richard had scored. Jagang had overruled the referees, saying the goal had been made after the horn blew. The referees had acquiesced and voided the point, but everyone knew that the broc had clearly gone in before the horn. None of that mattered, though. The emperor had made the call. The red team seemed determined to play on as if they hadn't just lost their biggest man. Out on the field they muscled their way through a line of blockers. Richard deftly sidestepped several attempts to snare him. A number of other men, though, were closing in. Richard abruptly halted on the safe square, a place that was rarely used, preventing the man who had been about to tackle him from doing so. It was the man who had broken the wing man's neck. Kahlan couldn't imagine what Richard was up to. Being on that square prevented him from being attacked as long as he remained there, but it also trapped him on an island that was swiftly being surrounded by opponents. While temporarily safe, he couldn't score from that spot. He would eventually have to move, but with every passing moment the territory all around him was becoming ever more unhealthy. As the man turned to check on his teammates, who were quickly closing in, Richard shouted something to get his attention. The man turned back.

The heavy broc smashed squarely into the man's face so hard that it rebounded back into Richard's hands. The blow had been powerful enough to partially cave in the man's face. With his nose completely driven back into his skull, the man went limp and dropped straight down in a heap. The crowd gasped at the unexpected turn of events. In a rage, another man to Richard's right lunged, even though Richard was on the safe square. The referee didn't look inclined to step in to call a foul. Richard rolled the broc back under his left arm as he ducked to that side a little. Turning all the while to keep faced to the attack, he swung his right arm. The thick bone of his forearm chopped the man across the throat. The man grabbed for his throat as he stumbled back and collapsed. One leg kicked reflexively as he desperately gasped for air. His windpipe apparently crushed, his face began turning from red to blue. Without pause, another towering man charged in from the left with a fist raised. Richard twisted toward him, going inside the punch and the opening in the man's defenses, and used his momentum to help him thrust straight in with lightning speed. The powerful strike focused in the heel of his hand hit he man right over his heart. The blow was enough to stagger him back. The big man clutched his chest, looking dazed and confused, and then, as his eyes began to roll back, he crumpled to the ground. Without any help, Richard had taken out three men who were all considerably bigger than him. She could easily see why there were so many arrows around the field pointed at him at all times. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (484 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan couldn't begin to imagine what would happen if Richard ever got his hands on a blade.

They were already stationed along his route, ready to block the tacklers going after him. Everywhere across the field men crashed together. Kahlan could see all the faces on the entire hillside across on the other side of the field turn in unison as they watched Richard running toward the opponent's goals, dodging some men, his blockers knocking others out of his way. Richard, with no one close enough to bring him down, raced into the scoring zone. In the clear, he heaved the broc into the net, scoring another point. His team was once again ahead. The crowd was swept up in the frenzy of the fast-paced action. Even Jagang had stepped forward, closer to the edge of the field, to watch, one hand fisted in anxiety at his side. His guards, too, all leaned out to watch as Richard's team, still with time on their turn, got the broc from the referee and started another charge.

He dipped and scooped up the broc as it rolled past. In an instant he was in the scoring zone and took the throw. With Richard down, it was a legal play for a wing man to attempt a score. The broc went in the goal, setting off thunderous cheers. The wing man threw his arms up in joy at having scored. It was something that wing men rarely had the chance to attempt, and even more rarely accomplished. While Kahlan knew that it was permitted, she'd never actually seen it done before. As the horn blew, signaling the end of the timed turn, Richard caught up with his left wing man and, with a proud smile, clapped him on the back. Judging by the way the wing man looked at Richard, Kahlan thought that recognition from Richard had meant just as much to the man as the goal. The wing man was an Imperial Order soldier, not a captive like some of the other members of Richard's team. She wondered why Richard would be so amiable with an Order soldier. Every time she started to have hopeful confidence in the man, something would happen that made her caution return. Since the Jast game they had attended, when Nicci had seen the man called Ruben and spoke the name Richard, Kahlan knew that Richard was his real name. She hadn't been able to speak a word with Nicci since then, though, so she couldn't ask, but she suspected that Richard was really Richard Rahl-Lord Rahl.

What really troubled her, though, was that he knew her. He had called out her name that first day he had been in a cage on a wagon in the supply train rolling into camp. She supposed it was possible that the Order had captured him without realizing who they had. The coincidence of it all, though, struck her as pretty far-fetched. She knew, though, there was likely more to it than she realized. Maybe Richard had gotten himself caught, somehow, in order to get close to her. To rescue her. Now, she told herself, she was just being silly. Still, she wondered why she kept finding herself at the center of so many things.

Bunched into a gang, they went straight up the middle, determined to mow down anyone who got in their way. Richard's team parted for them, then from both sides swiftly moved in behind and attacked from the rear, seizing men's legs.

Toward the front, where Jagang was, the royal guards kept the excited crowds to each side back, but even they were caught up in the frantic struggle on the Ja'La field; they weren't paying as much attention behind, where the space was slowly shrinking. Kahlan tightened her left arm protectively around Jillian, keeping her close as the special guards, having less and less space, started to inch forward where there was more room up closer to the action. The ones who had been behind her pressed in close, squeezing past as they slowly, steadily moved toward the front. Nicci, having been forgotten by the emperor as he became completely caught up in the action, took a step back, out of the way. That allowed Kahlan's guards space to move forward. It looked natural, like she was merely trying not to interfere with what they wanted. Jagang, like everyone else, cheered, groaned, cursed, and yelled at the teams on the field. Darkness had long ago settled in, lending an otherworldly mood to the event. Torches lining the edge of the field cast flickering light to the open patch of ground surrounded by a sea of black. Between many of the torches archers watched with arrows nocked. But even they were caught up in the emotions of the game, watching the action more than they seemed to be watching the captives. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (489 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan felt as if she were at the center of a boiling, churning, frenzied ritual dedicated to violence. The crowd not only yelled and cheered, but they began to chant, stamping feet in time to those chants as their team raced across the field. The ground shook under those hundreds of thousands of boots all slamming down together. The night, dark and overcast, felt like it was filled with continuous, booming thunder. The mood was bewitching. It even caught Kahlan up in it. She, along with all those watching, felt as if she were out there, on the field, running with the men. Her heart pounded as she watched Richard dodge tackles, duck under an outstretched arm, and slip between men diving for him. She winced, half turning away when men were hit. Many of the spectators groaned, almost as if they themselves had taken the blow. As the hourglass marked the turns, the score went back and forth. As she watched, though, Kahlan saw Richard fail to make scores that she felt sure he could have made. He would seem to slow just enough so that a man could catch and tackle him. One time he threw and missed. He was falling in the mud again, so to speak. This time, she didn't know why. As the game wore on it became ever more clear to her that he was manipulating the score, keeping it close.

It stood at seven points each. She could tell by the way he moved that he was not merely holding back for some reason, but he was also saving his energy. The other team was wearing themselves out. Richard did what was necessary but no more. Such a close match only served to heat the emotions of the hillsides c: spectators into fevered expectations. Many of them cheered, clapped, whistled, and yelled for the team they favored, while others shook fists and shouted curses at the team they opposed. Here and there fights broke out among the spectators. They ended up being brief because everyone wanted to watch the game. Kahlan, having watched Nicci's slow progress, saw that she had managed to ease herself half a dozen steps behind Jagang. No one was paying any attention to her. Jagang had glanced back twice, only half looking, satisfied that she was close enough at hand. Kahlan could see women camp followers, out near the edge of the field. just as wildly excited as the vast crowd, beginning to bare their breasts as men ran past. While the territory up close to the sidelines was highly prized, and often fought over, women at the matches were freely allowed access right up to the edge of the field. Throngs of men, knowing how worked up the women were, how eager they were to catch the attention of the players, egged them on. The women seemed to crave the attention. Over the deafening noise of the crowd Kahlan could hear some of the nearby women up at sidelines yell lewd promises for the victors as players ran by. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (491 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Ordinarily, women behaving in such a manner among the men of the Order would not be free for long, but the soldiers were far more interested in the game on the field.

When Nicci slipped close enough, Jillian reached out and touched her hand. \"Are you all right?\" she whispered just loud enough to be heard over the noise of the crowd. \"We were so worried for you.\" Cupping the girl's cheek, Nicci smiled briefly as she nodded in answer. \"He's up to something,\" Nicci said under her breath as she leaned a little closer to Kahlan. \"I know.\" \"This may be a chance for you to escape. I'll do all I can to help you. Be ready.\" With the collar around her neck Kahlan didn't know what chance she could possibly have to escape. She was heartened by the sentiment, though, even if she thought it was completely unrealistic. While Kahlan didn't believe that she had any real chance of escape, it might be an opportunity for something else, something that could save others. When Nicci glanced over again, Kahlan lifted out her hand just a little, hiding what was underneath, in her palm. \"Here. Take this.\" When Nicci only frowned, Kahlan turned the hand over briefly, just long enough for Nicci to see the handle of the knife.

Nicci looked up at Kahlan. \"Knives are not my talent.\" \"It's not hard,\" Kahlan said as she pressed the handle into Nicci's hand. \"When the time is right, just stick the pointed end somewhere important in someone you really don't like.\" Nicci's blue eyes stole a glance at Jagang. \"I think I can do that much.\" Kahlan thought that Nicci, standing there in the soft torchlight, her blond hair tumbled down over her strong shoulders, was probably the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. It wasn't just that she was beautiful, though. Despite what Jagang did to her, she remained undaunted. There was an inner strength about her, a nobility. \"Is he Richard Rahl?\" Kahlan asked. Nicci's blue eyes turned back to Kahlan and stared for a moment. \"Yes.\" \"What's he doing here?\" The slightest smile curved Nicci's mouth. \"He's Richard Rahl.\" \"Do you know what he's up to?\" Nicci shook her head the slightest bit as her gaze swept over all the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (493 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 guards, checking to make sure none were paying any attention to either of them.

I mean, with the paint all over them, how can you be sure?

The horde stamped a boot between each of those grunts. Who-ah. Thump. Who-ah. Thump. Who-ah. Thump. It seemed like the whole world moved with each of those Who-ahs. The ground shook with each thump. Even Jagang and his royal guards joined in. It gave the night an eerie, savage, primeval feel, as if everything civilized had been abandoned to the spectacle of raw savagery. The supporters of the emperor's team wanted the men to rip the challengers apart rather than let them score. The supporters of Richard's team wanted their men to crush those trying to stop them. The chanting was a call for blood. With only one timed turn left, Richard's team had to score during this play or they would lose. If they scored only one point during their time at play, though, the game would be tied and go into overtime. Kahlan caught glimpses of Richard, showing no emotion, as he gathered with his men. He gave them a brief, covert hand signal. As he turned, his gaze swept past. For an instant, their eyes met. The power in that connection made Kahlan's heart pound and her knees weak. Just as fast as it had come, Richard's scrutiny moved on. No one but Kahlan would have known that he had looked directly at her or, if they had, they wouldn't have understood why. Kahlan understood.

She couldn't imagine why, but it was for this moment. He abruptly yelled a battle cry and started the charge.

They were experienced players who knew that victory was within their grasp and they didn't intend to let anything change that.

Jagang looked like he wanted to tackle Richard himself as he ran past. Kahlan expected Richard to stop, to wheel on the emperor, and kill the man as he had so efficiently killed others, but he didn't. He didn't even glance to the side as he flew by. Richard had his chance to attempt an assassination and hadn't taken it. Kahlan couldn't imagine why not, if as Nicci thought, he really had intended to do something. Perhaps it was only wishful thinking on Nicci's part. . . and on Kahlan's. In an instant Richard and his men were past and gone, charging up the field. The men of Jagang's team, watching them come and seeing that they were relatively close together in their headlong rush, rather than scattered all over the field as they sometimes had been in the past, converged to form into an impenetrable wall of bone and muscle sure to stop their advance. In past turns at play the emperor's team had kept Richard's team from scoring. They knew that they would win if they merely contained their adversary and kept them from scoring during this turn. They appeared to want more, though. They didn't simply want to win; they wanted to punnish the challengers. They looked fiercely determined to end it in as brutal a fashion as possible.

As the men ran they all stacked in close together, with the largest men in the front. At the same time, each man reached out and fastened a hand on the shoulder of the man in front of him, locking the entire column together. Their long, breakneck strides moved in unison. In an instant, Richard's entire team had connected itself together into a solid, human battering ram. That column, Richard near the back, wasn't moving as fast as each of the men could have run by himself, but they didn't need to be fast, and what they gave up in a little speed was more than offset by their massive collective weight giving them staggering momentum. Even though the individual big men of Jagang's team braced themselves, the runaway line of men crashed through them like a tree trunk through a pauper's door. Jagang's men were all accustomed to their huge size serving them in good stead but, despite how big they were, they were no match for the prodigious weight of Richard's entire team body-slamming into them in such a focused manner. With such overpowering weight, the column punched through without being slowed, transferring the power of the collision to the defending blockers, sending them flying. Some of Richard's men in the front were peeled away by the violence of the contact, but as each broke off it exposed a new man in the lead so that the file itself remained intact as it plunged through the defending wall of men. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (498 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Once they were in the defenders' territory and at the first scoring line, long before they reached the regular scoring zone, the column of men burst apart, crashing into the blockers converging on them. For an instant, it opened a pocket of safety for Richard. He heaved the broc from that rear line. It was a long way to the goal. As the broc arced through the night air, illuminated by torches, the crowd leaned forward as one, all holding their breath, all eyes watching. With a thunk, the broc landed solidly in the net, scoring two points. The crowd exploded with a thunderous roar that made the air tremble and the ground shudder. Richard's team was now ahead by one point. The emperor's team had no more turns of the hourglass; there was no way for them to win. Even though there was time left on the play for Richard's team, they didn't need it. The game was as good as won, even though it wasn't yet over and the sand in the hourglass continued to drizzle down. Emperor Jagang stood stone-faced. His guards, looking grim, put their weight into holding back the excited crowds to each side as the cheering went on unabated. Jagang finally thrust an arm up high. The wild celebration began to die out as attention turned to see what the emperor would do. Jagang signaled for the referee. Kahlan shared a brief look with Nicci.

The entire army watching the game was in turmoil. Richard, though, didn't look at all moved by the ruling. In fact, he was already down at his end along with his men, as if he had expected it. His men, looking all business, didn't seem discouraged, either. As the referee tossed them the broc, they were ready. In Ja'La, play couldn't be interrupted. Jagang's team, however, had been celebrating their sudden turn of fortune and weren't yet formed up to defend their goals. Richard's team, having little time left, didn't waste any and charged away immediately. As they raced up the field they went to their left this time, to the opposite side of the field from where Kahlan stood watching. Again, they formed into the same tight column, the hand of each man resting on the shoulder of the man in front of him. They were running the same play, but reversing it. The other difference was that this time they kept well away from the sideline-far enough away that anyone, especially the crowd on that side of the field, could see that they were nowhere near the side boundary. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (500 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jagang's team saw what was coming but hadn't yet organized a defense to stop the formation bearing down on them.

In that instant, clear of defenders, Richard heaved the broc. It sailed over the outstretched arms of Jagang's team and thunked into the net for two points. The crowd erupted in wild cheering. The horn blew, hardly heard over the thunderous roar. The game was over. Richard's team had won the championship- several times over. Jagang, his face red with rage, took a long step back, reached out, seized Nicci's upper arm, and then yanked her forward to his side. He thrust his other arm into the air to halt the proceedings.

He made no move to retreat to safety. If anything, he looked like he wanted nothing more than to join the battle. His guards did their best to keep that battle as far away from him as possible. Kahlan spotted Richard on the far side of the field. In the torchlight his red paint stood out like a warning that the underworld itself was about to open up and swallow them all. Behind him and the men of his team the entire hillside was in full riot. The drunken rampage, unleashed hatred, and hunger for blood ran unchecked. Kahlan began to worry that the red paint Richard wore would mark him as a target of all the supporters of the emperor's team. All those spectators knew very well who he was and what he had just done.

Jagang's guards were all big, muscular men, yet it was all they could do to try to keep the regular soldiers pushed back. Inch by inch, though, they were beginning to lose ground. Those regular soldiers weren't really interested in battling with Jagang's guards, or with the emperor for that matter-they were fully occupied with fighting one another, lost to the passions of the drunken brawl-but that fight was nonetheless pressing steadily in toward the emperor. Jagang shouted at his guards, angry that they were being too indulgent with men who clearly weren't heeding commands. He ordered the guards to gut the men if they didn't move back. Kahlan didn't think that Jagang was at all worried about his safety. It was more a matter of indignation at their lack of veneration for their emperor. The guards didn't hesitate. Big, experienced men who had been busy pushing soldiers back switched instead to killing those who pressed in toward them.

Jagang stood in the center of his guards, a bloody short sword gripped tightly in a fist hanging at his side as he shouted commands. He glared with black eyes at the soldiers out beyond, a great many of them belligerently drunk, as they fought and died over who had won Ja'La dh Jin. Jagang pointed with his free hand, yelling orders to his guards, directing individuals into gaps in the effort to keep the mob back.

That half step turned out to be enough to save the emperor's life, because the second arrow hit Jagang in the right side of his chest. Had he not moved when the first man was hit, he would have taken the second arrow dead center in his heart. Kahlan couldn't believe that with such clamor, disorder, confusion, furious fighting, rage, fear, pain, and death all around, Richard could make such a shot. At the same time she couldn't imagine him missing. With an arrow buried deep in his chest, Jagang staggered back. As he dropped to his knees, his guards frantically rushed to surround him and form a wall shielding him from the possibility of any more arrows finding their way in. Kahlan lost sight of the emperor behind the tight screen of bodyguards. She used the moment of frozen shock on the faces of her special guards to slam the knife in her right hand into the right kidney of one of these guards as he watched Jagang's fate unfolding.

A third guard turned from the emperor's struggle and charged toward her. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (507 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jillian tripped him as he rushed forward. Kahlan caught his throat with her knife as he fell past, and with one quick pull cut it open from ear to ear. She turned and saw Richard across the field. He had a sword. As another guard stepped in, his hands reaching out to disarm her, Nicci slammed her knife into his back. He twisted around, crying out in shock as he reached back over his shoulder at the wound. She stabbed him twice in the chest-rapid, heavy blows. He stumbled and fell, trying to throw his arms around her to hold himself up, but couldn't and toppled to the ground. For not being an expert in using knives, Nicci appeared to have worked it out. A fifth man grabbed Jillian, intending to use her as a shield as he came for Kahlan. Kahlan slashed the forearm wrapped around Jillian's neck, cutting through muscle and tendons down to bone. When he flinched with a cry of pain, Jillian swiftly pulled away from him. As he lunged at Kahlan, she used his forward momentum to impale him on the knife in her other hand. She jerked the blade upward until it hit ribs. His eyes opened wide in surprise. She stepped aside as he fell past her, his insides spilling out when he hit the cold hard ground. In all the confusion she didn't see the sixth special guard, but she knew there was one.

Because many of the men with the torches had long since been plowed down as well by the battle descending on them, it was getting darker. It was becoming difficult to see. The Ja'La field was being inundated with combatants. Men fought for their lives while others fought to take life. Yet others, drunk after a day of celebrating at Ja'La matches, fought for the sake of fighting. Men grievously injured littered the ground. Everywhere men who had been hurt screamed in pain. No one helped them. There were soon so many men with their faces covered in red that it was becoming difficult to keep track of Richard. What only a brief time ago made him stand out now served to hide him. Only moments ago he was conspicuous; now he was a phantom among the chaos. None of the soldiers appeared to be slowing down or holding back. They were enraged and in the mood to kill anyone and everyone. Men swinging axes took off arms, split skulls, and chopped chests open. Men with swords ran others through. Despite how increasingly difficult it was, Kahlan kept Richard in sight as soldiers attacked him. For many, he was the object of their wrath. He was responsible for the blasphemy against the Imperial Order. He was the one who had dared to think he could defeat the emperor's team. He had accomplished the unthinkable. They hated him for it. They hated him for what they saw as his arrogance. Kahlan supposed that they believed that he should have failed- deliberately if he had to-and then everything would have been fine. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (509 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Failure was a talisman for such men, a grudge they kept close. It brought out their hatred whenever someone succeeded at something, at anything. Success had to be crushed. These were the brutes of the Order, steeped in the Order's teachings, being brutes. The beliefs of the Order, after all, needed brutes to enforce the faith. As Richard steadily crossed the field, coming toward Kahlan, men continually attacked him. He cut them down with summary composure. He was methodical in the way he made his way across the field. Those who tried to stop him died. \"What should we do?\" a frightened Jillian asked. Kahlan glanced around. There was nowhere to escape. The Imperial Order Army was all around them. There was no route out. Kahlan, being invisible to most of them, could escape on her own, but she wasn't about to leave Jillian and Nicci to fend for themselves among such brutes. Even if she wanted to, though, there was the matter of the collar around her neck. \"We need to stay here,\" Nicci said. Kahlan, knowing that there was no real way for them to get away, still puzzled at the woman. \"Why?\" \"Because Richard will have a difficult time finding us if we go far from this spot.\" Kahlan didn't really think there was anything he could do.

For all Kahlan knew, he might have already used his control of their minds to bring them running to his aid. Holding Jillian close, Kahlan glanced around. Nicci protected the girl from the other side. In every direction men were in a frenzy of killing. Kahlan nodded. \"For the moment we're safer here, protected by Jagang's guards. The way things are going, though, that may not last long.\" All around men fought on. Jagang was on his knees, in the center of his guards, clutching his chest. Some of the guards had knelt down beside him to support him in case they had to get him on his feet and fight their way out. Other men shouted urgent orders to get a Sister. Other royal guards savagely slashed at the soldiers who came within range, trying to keep the mob back. The ground all around the emperor's observation area was becoming slick with blood and gore. Kahlan stood transfixed, watching Richard. Men from every side rushed in, trying to kill him. He moved among them as if he really were a phantom.

She now knew that the man could indeed start a war, but she didn't really believe that he could go to the underworld and come back. Watching the perilous turmoil unfolding all around them, though, she knew that this was not the time or place to discuss it. She scanned the confusion of runaway violence, searching for a way out. If Jagang died, or even if he were only to pass out, she might be able to use such an opportunity to get Jillian, Nicci, and herself away from there. She wondered if it mattered if Jagang, being a dream walker, was unconscious or not.

Getting a woman who looked like Nicci and the tempting target of a girl like Jillian through all these men would not be easy. Nicci certainly put a lot of faith in Richard, though. \"Do you really think Richard can get us out of here?\" she asked Nicci. Nicci nodded. \"With my help. I think I know a way.\" Kahlan didn't think that Nicci was the kind of woman who would put her faith in a hope and a prayer. During her ordeal with Jagang she had never tried to latch on to delusions or false hope for salvation. If she said she knew a way, then Kahlan was inclined to think that there was something to it. Off through a gap in the battle, Kahlan spotted Richard. He thrust the sword forward, running a man through before the soldier could complete the swing of his own sword. Richard, covered in the bloodred symbols, immediately pulled the sword back out of the man and on the backswing smashed the pommel into the face of the man coming at him from behind. \"This may be our only chance, then,\" Kahlan said.

If it comes to that, don't you dare waste the opportunity I gain you. Do you understand?\" Kahlan didn't like that Nicci was thinking of sacrificing her life to give them a chance to get away. She also wondered why Nicci would think it more important that Kahlan live than her. \"If you promise that you won't even consider doing such a thing unless there's absolutely no other way. I'd rather find a way to get us all out of this.\" \"It's the only life I have,\" Nicci said. \"I want to keep it, if that's what you're wondering.\" Kahlan smiled at that and put a hand on Jillian's shoulder. \"Stay close, but don't get in the way if I have to use a knife.

Like the men guarding Jagang, these were elite combat soldiers. They were all big, powerfully built, and armed to the teeth-and there looked to be thousands of them. The violence they brought to bear was extraordinary to witness. They poured through the soldiers on a wave of blood. Not far off in the distance behind the royal guards Kahlan saw gouts of flame rise up into the night sky. The harsh red glow lit the straining faces of men fighting for their lives. Who the men were fighting seemed to have lost its importance. The soldiers seemed to have gone mad in a world gone mad. It was every man for himself, except for the royal guard, who did have a very clear idea of who they were fighting- anyone but them. \"Sisters are coming,\" Nicci said as she watched the flames and smoke boiling up into the black sky. \"We don't have much time before it's too late. Try to stay out of sight and out of the way of the guard.\" Kahlan nodded as she eased her way along with Jillian in a direction away from the main force fighting their way in. Nicci had a plan to get them away. Richard would be searching for them, so Kahlan didn't want to get too far away from where he had last seen them. Her aim was to skirt the main confrontation between the regular soldiers and the royal guard while moving toward where she'd last seen Richard, hoping that as they moved off to the side she didn't get too far away from Richard's approach.

Kahlan saw Jagang, then, still on his knees, being supported by a big man squatting down to each side of him. He was pale, but conscious. He was having difficulty breathing, occasionally coughing, leaving little dark spots of blood on his chin and down the front of him. One hand clutched the arrow jutting from the right side of his chest. \"An arrow!\" Karg yelled. \"How in the name of Creation did that happen?\" The officer seized Karg by his chain mail and yanked him close. \"Your man shot him!\" Commander Karg glared as he lifted the officer's chin with the point of a knife. \"Get your hands off me.\" The man released the commander, but returned the glare in kind. \"Now, what are you talking about it being my man?\" Karg asked. \"It was your point man. He shot the emperor with an arrow.\" Karg's expression darkened. \"Then I'll kill him myself.\" \"If we don't kill him first.\" \"Fine. You do it, then.

There are Sisters there who can help him. We can't do anything here.\" No one argued. Guards helped Jagang to his feet. Two men, one to each side, put shoulders under his arms, supporting him. \"Karg,\" Jagang said in a weak voice. The commander stepped close. \"Yes, Excellency?\" A grin spread on Jagang's face. \"Glad to see you. I guess you earned her for a while.\" Commander Karg shared in a brief, sly smile with the emperor before turning and yelling at the guards. \"Let's go!\" Jillian clutched Kahlan tightly on one side, Nicci on the other as they continued to slip away to the side, trying not to be seen. The guards helping Jagang started moving him out. The men Commander Karg had brought with him hacked and slashed their way back through the battle. Kahlan dreaded the thought of being back in Jagang's tent. As she kept an eye on the guards, she looked back over her shoulder, searching, but she didn't see Richard.

Almost all of the torches had long since gone dark in the fighting. The guards had brought some of their own, but they weren't close. As dark as it was with the heavy overcast, Kahlan couldn't even see the Ja'La field anymore. Even the plateau rising up above the Azrith Plain seemed to have vanished in the blackness. She had to use the distant ramp, lit by-torchlight, to get her bearings. With a thud that shook the ground, fire boiled up as Sisters apparently used their power to blast their way through the vast army in order to get to Jagang's rescue. There had been hundreds of thousands of men at the Ja'La match. It didn't seem like any were fleeing. Now the guards protecting the emperor needed to escape that mob. Kahlan, Jillian, and Nicci, too, needed to escape through the mob, but they didn't have thousands of heavily armed guards to help them. They relied, instead, on trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. Hunching to look harmless, they avoided looking directly at the men around them. They kept the hoods of their cloaks up and their heads down as they slowly slipped through pockets of relative calm amid the chaos. It was slow going. They still hadn't managed to get clear of the guards engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with the mob. Somehow, they had to make it through that line of guards, and then through the army beyond.

When Jillian tried to stab the man, he wrenched the blade from her hand. The men couldn't see Kahlan, or they would have grabbed her as well. Kahlan stepped in close behind the man holding Jillian. She started to lift her knife, but a powerful hand grabbed her wrist. It was one of her special guards-the sixth man, whom she'd lost track of. He towered behind her. Kahlan knew him. He was one of the smarter men. He wasn't as careless as the others. He still had all his weapons. As Nicci and a screaming Jillian were being dragged farther and farther away from Kahlan, the man twisted her arm behind her back until her fingers went numb. She cried out in pain. His expression was grim and indifferent to her torment as he stripped the knife out of her hand. She kicked back at his shins, trying to make him let go of her. Rather than let up, the man twisted her arm all the more until the pain made it impossible for her to struggle. He muscled her in the direction the emperor was going. Nicci looked back at Kahlan as Commander Karg dragged her through the confusion of men.

Richard was standing right there instead. The world seemed to stop. His gray eyes were staring into her soul. Up close like this, the strange bloodred designs painted on his face were terrifying. But the smile on his face made him look like the gentlest, kindest man in all the world. He seemed to be unable to do anything but smile as he stared into her eyes. It took Kahlan a moment to remember how to breathe. She finally glanced down and saw the special guard who had been holding her wrist. He was on the ground; his head was twisted around at an unnatural angle. He didn't look to be breathing. With bodies sprawled everywhere, no one paid any attention to one more. After all, he was just a regular soldier, like all the men battling each other. Except that he had been able to see her. Kahlan's thoughts came rushing back in. The thought of that man having Nicci and Jillian made Kahlan feel dizzy and sick. She flicked her hand in a quick gesture. \"We have to help Nicci and Jillian. Commander Karg has them.\" Richard didn't hesitate. His gray eyes turned toward where Nicci had vanished. \"Hurry.

As a man thrust his sword, Richard stepped back, out of the way, and severed the man's arm, catching the sword before it hit the ground. He tossed the sword to Kahlan. She caught it and immediately had to use it to stop a man going for Richard. It felt good to have a sword in her hands. It felt good to be able to defend herself. The two of them cut their way onward through the royal guards. Commander Karg glanced back and saw Richard coming. He let go of Nicci as he turned to his point man, grinning, ready to do battle. The guards all around saw that the commander wanted to handle this himself, so they turned back to their own problems. \"Well, Ruben, it seems-\" Richard swung, decapitating the snake without ceremony. He wasn't interested in anything but what needed to be done. He was a man who didn't need to teach the enemy a lesson. He was only interested in eliminating them.

Men expecting to fight Richard fell to her blade coming from nowhere. Between the two of them, they were slaughtering the guard. Nicci, too, immediately went on the attack. The three of them now had a single purpose-to fight their way out of the midst of the royal guards. \"We need to get to the ramp!\" Nicci shouted at Richard. He pulled his sword out of a man falling past him and frowned at Nicci. \"The ramp? Are you sure?\" \"Yes!\" Richard didn't argue. He changed the direction of the fight, covering Jillian as he battled his way through the endless mass of big men, making sure that none of them could get at her. As they stabbed and hacked their way through, Kahlan knew that she had to stay clear of Richard so that he would have the room he needed. Most of the men were going after him. None could see Kahlan, so she pulled Jillian well back out of Richard's way so that the guards couldn't snatch her to use as a shield to get at Richard.

He was dressed like an Order soldier, but he wasn't one of them. As Jil-lian backed against Kahlan when another man stabbed at her with a sword, the man with the golden eyes spun and with a backhanded swing caught the attacker along the side of the head.

Men yelling battle cries rushed in, swords swinging. Richard fought furiously, but he was forced to fall back. As the wave of men poured in, the space between Richard and Kahlan began to widen. Kahlan started to attack the men swarming in around Richard, but the stranger grabbed her upper arm, pulling her back away. \"We have to go. Now. He can handle those men. He's giving us a chance to get away. We have to take it.\" \"I'm not leaving him to-\" Kahlan suddenly gasped in a breath as the pain came on with full force. The sword fell from her grip. Her hands went to her throat, clawing at the collar. She screamed even though she tried not to. The searing pain was so sharp, so violent, that it was impossible not to scream.

Even as his sword killed with every thrust and men fell dying all around him, more and more men charged in and Richard was driven back. Kahlan fell face-first onto the hard ground. The pain seared down the nerves of her back and then her legs, making them twitch. She had no control over her muscles. The stranger grabbed Kahlan's arm. \"Come on!

His heart hammered in dread as he fought. Despite his frantic attempts to break through the wall of men in leather and chain mail it was proving impossible for him to get to her. In fact, it was all he could do to hold his own against the increasing numbers of men descending on him. A deadly variety of weapons came in at him from every direction- swords, knives, axes, and spears. He had to shift his tactics to fend off each of them.

Time and again he went back on attack with wild fury, cutting into the enemy line, but as he did ever more men appeared to take the place of those who fell to his blade. In those flurries of frantic exertion the best he could do was to hold his ground. Whenever he took a breath he lost ground. Kahlan was so close, but so far. Now, Jagang was taking her from him again. Richard reprimanded himself for not doing more to try to take out Jagang. He should have tried harder. If only that man hadn't stepped in front of Jagang at exactly the wrong moment, Richard's arrow would have done its job. But even as he told himself that he should have done more, should have tried something else, he knew that he couldn't dwell on what he might have done differently. He had to come up with something that he could do now. In all-too-brief glimpses he could see Nicci on the ground as well. Like Kahlan, she was also in desperate distress. Richard knew that it was urgent that he help them. Samuel certainly wasn't doing anything worthwhile. The distraction of Richard's concern was throwing his timing off.

His hands were slick with blood. His grip in his sword kept slipping. A man spun an axe in his fingers as he lifted it, as if to show Richard that he was now up against an expert. The man caught the handle and started to swing the axe down with lethal intent. At the last instant, Richard ducked to the side, then, with a cry of effort, swung his own weapon. The strike took the man's arm off. Richard used his foot to topple the startled man back out of the way, then ducked under a wild swing of a sword at his head and thrust his own weapon into the man's lower abdomen. The sword he was using worked, but it was not his sword. Samuel had his sword. What Samuel was doing there Richard feared to imagine. Seeing him standing over Kahlan, though, he didn't really have to imagine. Richard remembered Zedd telling him, when he had first given him the Sword of Truth, that he couldn't use it against Darken Rahl because he had put the boxes of Orden in play. Zedd said that during that yearlong period the power of Orden protected Darken Rahl from the Sword of Truth. Richard knew that it was foolish to do what he'd just done, but he had to test his theory. He had to know the truth of it if he was to succeed in what lay ahead.

He knew only that when he stopped, he would die. Just then, another man cut his way in from behind Richard, protecting his left side from a trio of men attacking from that direction. Out of the corner of his eye Richard saw red paint. He slashed his blade down across the face of a man as soon as the man made the mistake of cocking back his arm. As he fell to the side with a cry, Richard used the opening to snatch a quick glance to his left. It was Bruce. \"What are you doing here?\" Richard yelled over at the man between the clash of steel. \"What I'm always doing-protecting you!\" Richard could hardly believe that Bruce, a regular Imperial Order soldier, was fighting beside him, fighting off the emperor's royal guard The man was committing treason to fight beside Richard.

With an abrupt flash and heavy thud to the air, the soldiers all around Richard, including Bruce, were blown back as if by a blast. Yet there was no flame, no smoke, no flying debris, no ringing noise from a blast. Standing at the core of the event, Richard was left with his vision blurred and his flesh stinging from the force of the concussion. In every direction, the forest of big royal guards lay felled across the dark ground, like toppled trees. In the distance the roar of battle raged on. but closer in it was eerily quiet. Most of the men looked to be unconscious. A few moaned as they tried to move, but their arms dropped after briefly lifting, as if even that much was an effort too great. A spike of pain suddenly slammed into the base of Richard's skull. It felt like he'd been hit from behind with an iron bar. The stunning pain dropped him to his knees. He recognized the sensation. He hadn't been hit with iron; it was magic. Beside him, Bruce lay facedown on the ground. Still on his knees, Richard saw, off in the distant darkness, a gaunt woman stalking toward him through the downed soldiers. She moved like a vulture watching wounded prey. Her shabby appearance made Richard suspect that she was one of Jagang's Sisters. Unable to endure the ringing pain in his head, Richard toppled over face-first.

He looked across the battlefield scattered with fallen men at Kahlan. Even in obvious pain, she was looking back at him, worried for what was happening to him. The Sister was still some distance off, but Richard knew that he was running out of time to do something. \"Samuel!\" Richard yelled. Samuel, trying to drag Kahlan by her arm, stopped in his tracks and looked back at Richard, his golden eyes blinking. Richard couldn't help Kahlan. At least, not in the way he wanted to help her. \"Samuel, you idiot! Use the sword to cut the collar off her neck.\" Samuel, one hand holding Kahlan's arm, with his other hand lifted the sword he coveted so much, frowning at it. Richard watched as the Sister off through the darkness stalked ever closer. He remembered once, when being taken to the Palace of the Prophets, using the Sword of Truth to cut through an iron collar around Du Chaillu's neck. He also remembered being in Tamarang with Kahlan and using the sword to slash through the prison bars. He knew the Sword of Truth could cut steel. He also knew from when the Sisters had put the collar around his neck that the sword couldn't cut through a Rada'Han. The collar had been locked on and held tight with the power of his own gift.

But the collar around Kahlan's neck was different. Her own gift wasn't what bound it to her. It had simply been locked around her neck and used to control her. Richard also suspected that Six might have provided Samuel with a bit of extra help. It certainly wasn't his wits that had gotten him this far. Any additional ability she'd given him might aid in this as well. Richard wasn't sure that it would work, but he was sure that it was Kahlan's only chance. He had to get Samuel to at least try. \"Hurry!\" Richard screamed. \"Slide the blade under the collar and pull! Hurry!\" Samuel frowned suspiciously at Richard for a moment. He looked down at Kahlan's agony, then dropped to a knee and hurriedly slipped the sword under the collar. Some of the soldiers on the ground looked like they might be starting to come around. They groaned as they held their heads in their hands. Samuel gave the Sword of Truth a mighty pull. The night rang with the sound of steel shattering. Kahlan, free of the collar, collapsed in relief.

Richard, still unable to get up himself, looked to the side and saw the Sister, holding the tattered shawl closed, stepping over downed men as she came ever closer. Kahlan staggered unsteadily, but then recovered enough to bend and snatch up a sword. She intended to come to Richard's aid. Richard couldn't allow that. \"Run!\" he yelled at her. \"Run! There's nothing you can do here! Get away while you still can!\" Samuel stuffed a boot in a stirrup and sprang up into the saddle. Kahlan stood staring at Richard, tears in her beautiful green eyes. \"Hurry!\" Samuel called down to her. She didn't seem to even hear Samuel. She couldn't take her eyes off Richard. She knew she was leaving him there to die. \"Go!\" Richard yelled with all his strength. \"Go!\" Tears stung his own eyes. Despite how much he tried, he couldn't even rise up on his hands and knees.

Apparently, the Sister didn't want them interfering. She had plans of her own. The big warhorse tossed its head as it pawed the ground. Kahlan looked over at Nicci. She was curled up in a ball, shuddering in pain. Jillian lay on the ground beside her, stunned by the same blast of the Sister's magic. Despite her chance to escape, Richard knew that Kahlan was going to throw that chance away to try to help them. He knew that there was nothing Kahlan could do for Nicci. If Kahlan stayed, she would die. It was as simple as that. As much as he hated the thought, at the moment Samuel was her only salvation. \"Run!\" Richard cried out, his voice choked with tears. \"But I have to help Nicci and-\" \"There's nothing you can do for her! You'll die! Run while you still can!\" Samuel reached down and seized her arm, helping to pull her up onto the horse behind him. As soon as she was up, Samuel wasted no time in kicking his heels against the horse. The horse bounded away at a dead gallop, throwing up dirt and rocks in its wake. As the horse disappeared into the darkness, Kahlan looked back over her shoulder.

He felt the level of pain increase, making it difficult to pull each breath. She wanted to make absolutely certain that he wasn't able to lift so much as a finger against her. She peered down at him in surprised wonder. \"Well, well, as I live and breathe, if it isn't Richard Rahl himself.\" Richard didn't remember the Sister. She looked haggard. Her graying hair was unkempt. Her clothes were little more than rags. She looked more like a beggar than a Sister of the Light-or a Sister of the Dark, he didn't know which. \"His Excellency is going to be very pleased with me for bringing him such a prize.

She would still be able to get away on her own. Knowing Kahlan, she would probably use that advantage to annihilate half the camp on her way out. No matter what happened to Richard, now, his relief for Kahlan was what mattered most to him. Kahlan didn't know who she was, and she wouldn't know where to go, but she would be alive and out of immediate danger. Richard had come to the Order's encampment to help free her. He had succeeded in that much of it. Despite the peril he was now in, it was worth it to him to have managed to help her get away. He looked beyond the Sister standing above him to Nicci. It was going very badly for her. He'd had one of those collars around his neck. He knew well the lonely agony she was in. Richard wished that he could help her as well, or at least let her know that she wasn't alone and abandoned. But he could do nothing. He knew that Jillian was not going to fare any better. He reminded himself not to fixate on such terrible thoughts. One problem at a time, he told himself. He had to find some way to help them both. The pain abruptly lifted from his arms and legs. The rest of him still felt on fire. Even though he could at last begin to move, his head was still in so much pain that everything looked blurred and distorted. \"On your feet,\" the Sister above him said. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (535 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She sounded like she was in a vile mood.

She probably thought she had been important, thought the whole world would know her haughty scowl, her condescending attitude, her sharp tongue. Some people thought they could gain prominence, prestige, and renown through pompous arrogance. They mistook fear for respect. Richard really didn't remember the woman, though, and saw no point in humoring her. \"Can't say that I really remember you. Should I, for some reason?\" \"Liar!

Richard used the opportunity to take a quick glance, surveying the weapons on the ground. If she turned her back on him he had to take the chance. Once Jagang had him strapped down in the torture tents Richard knew that he would never see the light of day again. As much as that fate terrified him, a part of him couldn't help feeling lighthearted knowing that Kahlan had gotten away. He swallowed back his anguish at the tears he had seen in her eyes as she had made good her escape. It reminded him of how much she loved him, but she no longer remembered that. \"You don't know how long I've waited for something like this, something that could gain me the emperor's favor.

The powerful blow completely caught her off guard, lifting her feet clear of the ground as it smashed into her. Teeth and blood flew off into the darkness. She landed on her side with a hard thud. The stunning impact of his boot looked to have shattered her jaw. Richard dove for a sword. He knew that he dared not underestimate such a woman. Until she was dead, she could kill him-or make him wish that he was dead. His fingers seized the hilt of a sword. He spun around to plunge it into her. The air exploded with light. Richard landed on his back so hard that it drove the air from his lungs. She was up, blood streaming from the bottom of her face in long strings that whipped around as she lifted both hands. Richard could hardly believe that she was able to stand. She looked like the freshly dead come back to life. He knew that she couldn't last for long, but she could very well last long enough to kill him.

Richard blinked in surprise as he watched her stumble forward another step and topple face-first, slamming hard onto the ground without even trying to break her fall.

Out beyond, though, it was still chaos. The general shifted Jillian's weight a little and pointed with his sword. \"There's a small supply wagon just over there. We can hide Jillian and Nicci inside. With that paint on you two, you're not going to make it far before a few hundred thousand of these men decide to cut you down. No slight intended, Lord Rahl, but those odds are pretty poor.

The gaggle of men and women in white robes shuffled farther down the hall, gazing at the white marble walls, trailing their fingers across it, stopping here and there to peer closely at it as if they were searching for a message from the world of the dead. \"Well?\" Cara asked. An older man, Dario Daraya, laid a finger lightly across his lips. He frowned thoughtfully for another long moment as he watched the cluster of people bobbing and swaying down the corridor like corks in a river, then swiveled toward the Mord-Sith. He ran his fingers down the sky blue silk edging running down the front of his crisp white robes. He frowned at Cara, his features twisting a little as he scratched the fringe of white hair encircling his bald head. \"I'm not sure, Mistress.\" \"Not sure about what? Not sure that I'm right, or not sure of what they think about it?\" \"No, no, Mistress Cara. I agree with you.

There were carpets in a few places, a chair or two in small, side rooms, but other than that there wasn't much of anything to be out of place. Dario watched his people for a moment, then turned back to Cara and Verna. \"I take care of everything surrounding their service. There are quarters to see to, meals, clothes, supplies-all that sort of thing. I run the crypt staff. They are the ones who actually attend to the work down here.\" \"What kind of work, exactly?\" Verna asked. \"Well, in general, sweeping, cleaning, dusting-that sort of thing. There are miles of corridors down here. The staff replaces lamp oil and candles in some places, keeps fresh torches in others. Occasionally a piece of stone will crack and need to be repaired or replaced. The caskets that aren't entombed within walls or in the floor have to be kept in good condition-the metal on some polished, on others kept free of rust, and the carved wooden ones need to be waxed to keep the wood from drying excessively.

He feared that, while they were down here alone, they might speak ill of his dead father.\" \"And what if they did?\" Verna asked. \"What could it hurt?\" The man shrugged. \"I'm sorry, but I wasn't about to question the man. When he was alive there was a constant stream of new staff workers replacing those who had been executed for various reasons. It was unhealthy to be anywhere near the man, and the crypt staff often found themselves the object of his rages. New staff were rounded up from time to time and pressed into service. \"Darken Rahl only left me with my tongue because my work didn't take me down here very often. I oversaw the staff. I need to interact with others on the palace staff, so I need to be able to talk with people. The rest of the staff, in Darken Rahl's view, didn't have anything worthwhile they needed to say, and no need for a tongue.\" \"How do you communicate with them?\" Cara asked. Dario touched his lips again as he glanced at his staff slowly making their way farther on down the hall. \"Well, the way you would imagine. They use signs.

Some of them had their crossbows loaded with the special red-fletched arrows that Nathan had found for them. Verna didn't like being anywhere near those wicked things. Their deadly magic made her sweat. The crypt staff, made up of both women and men, was gathered in a clutch, inspecting the walls and every intersection along the way. They had all been down in the various tomb levels most of the day and Verna was tired. She was usually in bed by this time. That was where she wanted to be. As far as she was concerned, the meticulous inspection of nothing at all could wait until the next day. Cara didn't look tired. She looked intense. She had this \"problem down in the tombs\" bone in her teeth and she wasn't going to let go for anything. Verna would have left Cara to it, except that when they had searched out Dario Daraya, the man in charge of the crypt staff, to ask what he could tell them, he had not dismissed the inquiry, as file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (550 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Verna had expected. He seemed nervous that they had even asked the question. It turned out that he shared Cara's uneasy suspicion but as of yet hadn't mentioned it to anyone. He told Verna and Cara that he strongly suspected that the members of his staff were also aware of something being amiss. Verna had learned that among the vast force that was the palace staff, the members of the crypt staff were considered the lowest of the low. Those with responsibility over important sections of the palace dismissed the work down in the tomb areas as simple, menial work for mutes. The crypt workers were also shunned because they spent their existence working among the dead, thus carrying the invisible taint of superstition. Dario had explained that such attitudes had left them a shy and withdrawn lot. They didn't eat in the common areas with other people on the staff. They kept to themselves and kept their own counsel. Verna watched them down the corridor a ways, conversing among themselves in their strange language of signs. Having developed the language among themselves, no one else understood them except, perhaps, for Dario Daraya. As much as Verna, and especially Cara, wanted to question the staff directly, they were forced to allow Dario to do it. The mere close proximity of an outsider-especially a Mord-Sith-sent the silent group into trembling and even tears.

Verna watched Dario, standing in their midst, quietly asking questions. The people surrounding him became excited at certain points, pointing this way and that, and making signs to him. Dario nodded from time to time and gently asked more questions, which drew more of the silent language from some of the staff. Dario at last returned. \"They say that there is no problem in this corridor. Everything here is fine.\" Cara spoke through gritted teeth. \"Well then if they don't-\" \"But,\" Dario interrupted, \"they say that in that corridor there\"-he pointed ahead to the right-\"there is something wrong.\" Cara studied the man's face for a moment. \"Come on, then, let's have a look.\" Before Verna could hold her back, Cara marched in long strides right up to the knot of a dozen and a half people. Verna thought that several of them might faint of fright as they cringed back, fearful of what she was going to do to them. \"Dario says that you think there is something wrong in that corridor up there.\" Cara gestured to the intersection ahead. \"I think there's something wrong, too.

He tortured me to make me be a Mord-Sith.\" Cara turned a little and lifted the red leather at her waist, showing them a long scar along her side and back. \"He did this to me. See?\" The people all leaned in ogling the scar. One man reached out and tentatively touched it. Cara turned his way to let him. She took a woman's hand and rubbed her finger along the bumpy length of the scar. \"Here, look at this,\" she said, pulling her sleeves up and holding out her wrists for them to see. \"These are left from the shackles when he hung me up-chained to the ceiling.\" The people all leaned in looking. Some of them gently touched the scars on her wrists. \"He hurt you, too, didn't he?\" Cara knew the answer, but she had asked anyway. When they all nodded, she said, \"Show me.\" The people all opened their mouths wide for her to see their missing tongues. Cara looked in each mouth, nodding at what she saw. Some held a cheek aside, turning their heads to be sure she saw their scars. Cara carefully looked at each one until they were satisfied that she had really wanted to see. \"I'm glad that Darken Rahl is dead,\" she finally told them. \"I'm sorry for what he did to all of you.

I want to help a good man for a change instead of being a slave to a bad one. \"I've seen Richard Rahl weep for Mord-Sith who have died.\" She tapped her chest over her heart with a finger. \"Do you understand what that means to me?

The two of them followed after the shuffling group of people who had adopted Cara as a patron sister. A number of the people reached out as they made their way down the corridor to touch her, to run a hand down the red leather of her arm, to rest a hand on her back as if to say that they understood the pain and abuse she had endured and were sorry that they had misjudged her. As they went down the next corridor, Verna realized that she was no longer sure where they were. The tomb area was a confusing maze that occupied several levels. In addition to that, most of the corridors were identical. They were all the same width and height and all made of the same white marble with gray veining through it. She knew that they were down in the lowest level, but other than that, she was depending on the others to know exactly where they were. Behind, keeping their distance so as not to interfere, the soldiers, ever watchful, followed as quietly as possible. The group of people in white robes finally came to a halt along a section of the corridor where there wasn't an intersection. Farther down there were a number of halls going off in both directions, but in this place there were none. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (555 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Several of the staff placed the flats of their hands on the white marble.

Several people, with their hands held uniformly apart, made back and forth gestures toward the wall. Cara didn't understand. Neither did Verna. Dario scratched his fringe of white hair. Even he was puzzling at the strange show. The staff huddled a moment, using their signs, silently discussing the problem among themselves. The people all turned back to Cara. Three of them pointed at the wall, then shook their heads. They all turned and looked at Cara again to gauge her reaction and understanding. \"You don't like the way the wall looks?\" Cara guessed. The people all shook their heads side to side. Cara cast a questioning look back at Verna and Dario. Dario turned his palms up and shrugged. Verna could offer no suggestion either. \"I still don't understand,\" Cara said. \"I know you think something is wrong with the wall\"-heads nodded-\"but I don't know what.\" She sighed. \"I'm sorry.

Cara leaned in a little and frowned as she watched. He looked back over his shoulder. When he saw her frowning in concentration, he went back to tracing the gray swirl. He did it several times, over and over in the same place, to make Cara pay attention. \"It looks like a face,\" Cara said in quiet wonder. The man nodded furiously. Others nodded with him. They all rejoiced silently. A woman reached out and eagerly traced the same gray whorl. Her finger followed a curl, an arc. She then punctuated it the same as the man, by touching the center in two places. Eyes. Cara reached out and traced the same face in the stone, just as they had done, following the gray eddies with a finger, tracing out the mouth, the nose, then the eyes.

One man from the group motioned, then hurried to a spot across and a little farther down the corridor. He quickly traced out something in the gray veining. From where Verna stood she couldn't see it, but she assumed that it was probably another face. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (557 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He rushed to another spot along the corridor and traced out a small face there in the stone looking out at them.

To the crypt staff, who spent their lives down here cleaning and caring for the place, these markings were like street signs. They recognized them all. Comprehension had come onto Cara's face as well. She was also looking more worried. \"Show me again what's wrong,\" she said in a serious but quiet voice. The people, excited that Cara was now following along with what they were telling her, all rushed back over to the section of wall where they had shown her the first face. Standing before the wall, all of them moved both hands back and forth, toward and away from the wall. They paused, the whole group turning to Cara to see if she understood. She watched them. One of the men then pointed at the wall and beyond in an arcing movement, as if indicating something away over a hill in the distance. Verna was confused again. Cara stared at the face in the wall.

Along the way, Cara gathered up Verna and Dario, turning them around and moving them along. The mute crypt staff all followed close on her heels, looking both concerned that Cara was alarmed about something, and proud of themselves at the same time. Cara leaned close to Verna when they had retreated up the corridor and around the corner of the intersection. \"Get Nathan,\" she said in a tone of clear command. Verna's brow twitched. \"Does it need to be tonight? Don't you think that we-\" \"Get him now,\" Cara said in a deadly calm voice of authority. Her blue eyes were cold fire.

Every time a gust of wind buffeted the wagon he had to keep a good hold on the tarp to keep it down. The towering monstrosity of the ramp loomed overhead. Up this close he could see just how immense it had already become.

Regular soldiers wanted nothing to do with the potential trouble offered by a small wagon escorted by what appeared to be a high- ranking royal guard and a Sister. Men mostly ignored them as they passed. The riot, as large as it was, had primarily been confined to the spectators at the Ja'La match. While it seemed that perhaps hundreds of thousands of men were involved in the fight over the outcome of the game, and it was a vast, gruesome bloodbath, the trouble was still limited to a fraction of the encampment. In much of the rest of the camp commanders had rushed armed men in to clamp down on movement and contain the trouble. Despite that effort, the turmoil had spread to a certain extent. Most of these men had not joined a struggle to be cold, hungry, and spend their lives digging dirt. They were becoming resentful of having to work at menial labor rather than being about the business of murder, rape, and plunder. Waiting for the prospect of conquest was one thing, but now the remaining spoils looked rather limited and the work of getting to them was considerable. It seemed that self-sacrifice for the cause of the Order had its limits. The line appeared to have been drawn at actually having to work.

Several times General Meiffert had had to bluff his way through groups of men. Once his bluster had needed to be reinforced by killing a man with a swift slash across the side of his neck. Other times Adie had quietly used her powers to ease their way through potential trouble. Having the soldiers think she was one of Jagang's Sisters ended a lot of questions before they even began. Several times, when she had been stopped and questioned by soldiers foraging for loot, she merely stared at the men without answering. Looking into her completely white eyes as she glared at them, they lost their nerve and vanished back into the darkness. Far behind them at the Ja'La field there were pockets within the riot that were finally being brought under control, but for the most part the night there had been abandoned to chaotic battles between drunken soldiers. The emperor's guard hadn't really cared about restoring order; they had only been interested in saving the life of the emperor. Nicci's trembling pain told Richard that Jagang was still alive and able to exert his influence. That didn't mean he was conscious, though. What Richard didn't know was if Jagang at some point, when unable to force her to return, might decide to kill her through the collar. If he did, there was nothing Richard could do to stop him. Getting the collar off from around her neck was the only solution, and to do that they needed to get to Nathan up in the palace. Peeking out from under the tarp, Richard spotted a confusion of vast pits spread out ahead in the torchlight. Richard could see lines file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (562 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 of men, animals, and wagons leading out of pits where material was being dug up. Clouds of dust streamed away from areas where men were actively digging. The lines of men and wagons coming out of those pits stretched all the way to the ramp. Those lines were all in constant motion as they conveyed the dirt and rock to the construction site. Richard again glanced at Nicci, lying in the low wagon bed right beside him. She had his hand in a death grip. Her whole body trembled. He ached with sympathy for her agony. He knew what it felt like. He had endured the same magic from a collar. His ordeal hadn't lasted as long, though. He didn't know how long she could live through such pain. Jillian lay on the other side of Nicci, holding her other hand. Bruce lay beyond Jillian, carefully peering out from under the tarp on that side from time to time, sword at the ready in case he had to help them fight their way out of trouble. Richard wasn't sure how much he could trust the man. Bruce had more than once stepped in to protect Richard at great risk to his own life. Richard knew that not every single man in the Order's camp would choose the Order, if really given the choice. There had to be some, even if only a few, who would rather have nothing to do with the Order. Richard didn't really know Bruce all that well, so he didn't know what experiences the man had lived through that would cause him to take this chance to side with him, but Richard was glad that he had. In a small way it gave him hope that not the whole world had gone mad.

She glanced over. \"We be here.\" Richard nodded, then leaned close to Nicci. \"We're here. We're near the ramp.\" Her brow was tightly creased in agony. She seemed to be in a faraway world of suffering. With great effort she released some of the pressure on his hand, then squeezed again to let him know that she'd heard him. Despite how cold it was, she was drenched in sweat. Her eyes were closed most of the time. Occasionally they opened wide as she gasped from a terrible twist of pain. It was making Richard crazy that he couldn't help her right then and there, that she had to wait, suffering in her isolated world of torment, enduring the dragging eternity it seemed to be taking to get her to Nathan. \"Nicci, can you tell me what we need to do? We're here, but I don't know why. Why did you want us to go to the ramp?\" He gently pulled back hair that was plastered to her beaded brow. Her eyes opened wide with a stitch of overpowering pain. \"Please . . .\" she whispered. Richard leaned closer yet so he could hear her. \"What is it?\" He put his ear closer to her mouth. \"Please . . . end it.

She started to sob. Richard, terror rising in his throat, clutched her close. \"We're almost there. Hold on. If we can get inside the palace I think Nathan can get that collar off. Just hold on.\" \"Can't,\" she wept. Richard pressed his hand against the side of her face. \"I'll help you get it off. I promise. We just need to get inside. I need to know how do we get in.\" \"Catacombs,\" she said in a gasp as her back arched. Catacombs? Richard blinked at the word. Catacombs? He lifted the flapping canvas tarp a little and peered out again. The ramp stood nearby. Beyond the ramp the black wall of the plateau, only some of the fringe at the bottom visible in the torchlight, soared up into the night. As he looked at the plateau, it made sense. Jillian leaned over Nicci. \"Could she mean catacombs like at my homeland?\" She looked down at Nicci. \"Catacombs like in Caska?\" Nicci nodded. Richard again looked out from under the tarp, searching for anything that looked different, for any sign of where the entrance could be. He went over in his mind everything he could remember about the ancient catacombs in Caska. Deep within those underground rooms was where they'd found the Chainfire book. The maze of ancient tunnels and chambers had run on for miles. Richard had spent nearly the whole night searching through the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (565 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 catacombs and he knew that he'd only seen a fraction of them. Finding the entrance, though, had been difficult. It had been only a small opening that had led him down into the hidden underground world of the catacombs. Finding such an opening out here in the open, with all these men around, was going to be far more than merely difficult. He turned back. \"Nicci, how did you find catacombs down in the palace?\" She shook her head. \"Found us.\" \"They found you?\" Richard peered out again as the realization hit him. \"Dear spirits . . .\" It all started to make sense to him. Jagang's men, digging the pits, had uncovered ancient catacombs. They must have used those tunnels to get up into the palace. \"They got up into the palace and captured you? Is that what you mean?\" Nicci nodded. But if they had gotten up into the palace, then why would they still be working on the ramp? He realized that if the catacombs were anything like the ones in Caska they would need more than those tunnels to get an army up into the People's Palace. It would be like trying to force sand through an hourglass. It could also be that the ramp was a diversion to buy them time to do just that. Diversion or not, Jagang might have gotten spies up into the palace file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (566 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 through the catacombs.

With their powers weakened by the spell of the palace, he knew that it would have taken more than one. \"The crews digging dirt for the ramp discovered catacombs,\" Richard guessed out loud to Nicci. \"Sisters went through the catacombs and found a way to get up into the palace. That's how they captured you.\" Though the trembling and pain, Nicci squeezed his hand in confirmation. Richard leaned close to Nicci. \"Does anyone up there know that Jagang has a way in?\" She rocked her head from side to side. \"Gathering inside,\" she managed. Richard's heart missed a beat. \"They're gathering men inside to attack the palace?\" She nodded again. \"Then we'd better get in there and warn them,\" Bruce said. \"Adie,\" Richard said to the old woman standing right beside the wagon, \"did you hear all that?\" \"Yes.

Look at the way they've halted all digging between there and the plateau.\" \"Why would they do that?\" the general asked. \"The catacombs would be ancient. There's no telling what condition they might be in. They don't want to risk caving in any of the tunnels running in under the palace.\" \"It must be so,\" Adie said. \"How are we going to get down into the pit?\" General Meiffert asked. \"If we had more royal-guard uniforms we might be able to get down in there,\" Bruce suggested. \"Maybe,\" Richard said, \"but what about Nicci and Jillian?\" Bruce didn't have an answer. \"They certainly couldn't walk in there,\" General Meiffert agreed, \"and a wagon going down into a guarded pit would obviously be cause for suspicion.\" \"Maybe,\" Richard said, thinking out loud. \"Maybe not.\" General Meiffert looked back over his shoulder. \"What do you have in mind?\" Richard gently shook Nicci's shoulders. \"Are there books down in the catacombs?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (568 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Yes,\" she managed.

He sent this Sister along to see to getting the books he's concerned about. You tell them that you need them to organize a contingent of guards to escort the wagon back to the compound.\" \"They'll want to know why we didn't bring guards with us.\" \"Because of the trouble,\" Bruce suggested. \"Tell them that with the rioting the officers didn't want to risk any guards taken from the duty of protecting the emperor.\" Richard nodded at the idea. \"While they're busy going off to gather us some men, we slip down into the catacombs.\" \"Not all the guards are going to leave the site to go gathering up men for you,\" Bruce said. \"It would sound awfully suspicious if we even suggested such a thing.

That helps to even the odds.\" \"You have a point,\" General Meiffert said. \"To a certain extent it doesn't matter how many guards are down in there. They can't swarm over us. In such confined spaces they can only have a few men at a time fighting us.\" Richard let out a sigh. \"But that's still trouble we don't need. We'd have to walk over every guard we kill and every one of the men down there will be trying to stop us. As we force our way farther in they can surround us from behind.

Richard glanced quickly to the eastern sky. Dawn was not far off. He and Bruce pulled the tarp down tight as the wagon began to rumble forward. Richard hoped they could get down into the eternal night of the catacombs in time. Next to him, Nicci wept softly, unable to endure the agony, unable to summon death. Her suffering was breaking Richard's heart. All he could do was to squeeze her hand to let her know that she was not alone. Richard listened to the wind howl as General Meiffert spoke in muffled words to the captain of the guard. Richard leaned close to Nicci and whispered to her, \"Hold on.

More important than that, though, Nicci was his friend. He cared deeply for her. He could always find other solutions if it came to that, but he couldn't bear to lose her. Nicci had often been the only person he could turn to, the person who had helped keep him focused, who had reminded him to trust in himself. In many ways she had been his only confidant since Kahlan had been taken. He couldn't stand the thought of losing her. CHAPTER 41 At the northeast bank above the stream, Rachel slipped down off the horse, clutching the reins as she peered all around, watching for any movement. In the early dawn light the dark humps of the barren hills made it look like she was in the midst of a pack of slumbering monsters. She knew better, though. They were just hills. But there were real things that weren't harmless figments of her imagination. The ghostie gobblies were real, they were close, and they were coming for her. White cliffs of twin hills rose up, facing each other across the banks of the stream.

She peeked inside, looking to see if Queen Violet or Six was hiding there. She expected that Violet might leap out and slap her, then laugh in that haughty way of hers. The cave was dark and empty. Rachel twisted her fingers together as she again scanned the round hills. Her heart beat wildly as she looked for any movement. The ghostie gobblies were getting closer. They were coming for her. They were going to get her. Inside the cave she saw the familiar drawings that she had seen so many times before. There were thousands of sketches covering every inch of the walls. Between large drawings, small ones were squeezed into the available space. Each one was different. Most looked like they had been drawn by different people. Some were so simple that they almost looked like they'd been drawn by children. Some were detailed and remarkably realistic-looking. Rachel didn't know how to judge such things, but to her it seemed that the drawings had to represent many generations of people. Considering the many different styles and various levels of refinement, they could easily represent dozens and dozens of generations of artists, maybe hundreds. All the drawings had people in them.

The drawings gave Rachel nightmares. She squatted down and felt the oil lamps. They were cold. No one had been in the caves. She retrieved a flint and steel from a small niche cut into the wall of the cave and used it to strike a spark at the wick of a lamp. She tried a number of times and was able to get a good spark, but not a flame in the wick. She glanced back over her shoulder between tries. She was running out of time. They were coming. They were getting close now. Rachel shook the lamp to get more oil on the wick then frantically struck the flint and steel together. It took half a dozen tries but to her great relief she finally got a flame going. She picked the lamp up by the loop handle and stood. She stared out of the mouth of the cave, looking for any movement, looking for the ghostie gobblies. She didn't see them, but she knew they were coming. She thought she could hear them, out in the scrub brush. She was sure she could feel them looking at her.

Crawling over a jutting outcropping of rock, she could see her breath as she panted not only with effort but with gathering panic. She didn't know how far she had to go to be safe. She only knew that the ghostie gobblies were coming for her and she had to keep going, had to get away. She came to the drawing she remembered all too well. It was a drawing that Rachel had watched Queen Violet make with Six's help. Although they had never mentioned his name, Rachel knew that it was a drawing of Richard. With all the things drawn around the central figure it was the biggest drawing in all of the cave. It was also the most complex. Unlike all the rest of the pictures, Violet's had been done with colored chalk. Rachel remembered all the time Queen Violet had spent on it- back when she had been the queen-all the careful instruction Six had given her, all the careful sequences of lines and angles and elements. Rachel remembered having to stand there for hours at a time, listening as Six explained the why and how of everything Violet was to draw before she had been allowed to put chalk to the stone wall.

Whenever Six had directed Violet in practice drawings, or when they had wanted to draw something new, they had always had to go deeper and deeper back into the cave to find fresh walls to draw on. Rachel remembered all too well that the picture of Richard was the last thing they had drawn, so she knew that beyond it the walls would be barren. As she went past the colored network of lines and symbols radiating out all around Richard, Rachel was startled to see something she had never seen before. She came to a halt. There was a new drawing. She stared in astonishment. It was a drawing of her. All around the picture of her were swirling creatures. Rachel recognized the symbols that forced them in toward her. The awful beasts were like ghosts made of shadow and smoke. Except they had teeth. Sharp teeth. Teeth made to rip and tear. Without any doubt whatsoever, Rachel knew what they were. They were the ghostie gobblies. She stood frozen staring at the picture of the terrible deadly things that had been sicced on her by vicious spells drawn there on the cave wall.

The safety she had thought she was running toward was merely the center where they had been chasing her toward, the center where she would be trapped, unable to ever escape. She heard a sound and looked toward the dim glow of light from the cave's entrance. For the first time she saw the shadows and swirls. They were in the cave. They were gathering, just like in the drawing on the wall. They were coming for her. Rachel stood frozen in terror. She realized that she could no longer get out of the cave. She could only go deeper. But by looking at the drawing she could see that going deeper into the cave would not save her-there were ghostie gobblies back there, too. She was trapped, unable to go deeper, unable to get out. She was at the center of a spell that was designed to continually close in around her. \"Like it?\" someone called out.

She knew why. Violet blamed her for everything bad that ever happened to her. She never blamed herself for the trouble she brought upon herself; she blamed others, blamed Rachel. \"Where is Six?\" Violet gestured dismissively. \"Who knows. She doesn't tell me her business.\" Violet's glare turned as dark as the cave itself. \"She is queen now. No one listens to me anymore. They do what she says. They call her queen.

It's all because of you.\" Violet's glare twisted into the smile that had always given Rachel chills. \"But now you will pay for your disrespect, your evil ways. Now you will pay.\" The smile widened with satisfaction. \"I made them so that they will tear the flesh from your bones. Pick you clean.\" Rachel swallowed in terror.

Get down on a knee and tell your queen that you're sorry for betraying her. Maybe if you do I'll help you.\" Grasping desperately for any hope, Violet quickly went to a knee and bowed her head forward, using the moment it took to think. \"I'm sorry.\" \"You're sorry . . . what?\" \"I'm sorry, Queen Violet.\" \"That's right. I am your queen. While Six is gone, I am the queen around here. The queen! Say it!\" \"You are the queen, Queen Violet.\" Violet smiled in satisfaction. \"Good. I want you to remember that as you die.\" Rachel looked up. \"But you said that you would help me.\" Queen Violet, laughing to herself, retreated farther back into the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (580 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 darkness. \"I only said maybe. I've decided you don't deserve my help. You're a nobody.\" Behind her, rasping little growls were coming closer. Rachel thought she might faint from her clawing fright. She reached into the pocket of her dress and felt something there- the thing her mother had given her. She pulled it out and stared at it in the lamplight. Now she knew what it was. It was a piece of chalk. When her mother had given it to her Rachel had been in such a hurry to get away from the ghostie gobblies that she hadn't really paid attention to what it was. Her mother had told her that when she needed it she would know what to do. Rachel glanced back into the darkness. She could see the back of Violet's head as she retreated farther back into the cave, away from the violent death that she knew was about to take her. Rachel looked back the other way and saw the snarling things swimming through the air, coming closer, their mouths opening wide, their needle-sharp teeth snapping and snapping. She immediately stepped to the drawing Violet had done to trap her. Rachel used the chalk to swiftly add lines and shading, making the figure thicker, rounder. She made the face rounder, and then put a hateful scowl on it. The chalk flew across the stone as she filled in frilly a dress, the kind of dresses that Violet always liked to wear. Finally, remembering what Violet liked to wear in the jewel room, Rachel drew a crown on the head, changing the picture file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (581 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 for good from her, into Queen Violet. Violet claimed to be the queen. Rachel had just crowned her, giving her what she demanded. She heard a scream from the darkness. When she saw them coming from the other side, Rachel pressed her back up against the wall as the creatures floated, wriggled, and swam through the air, making their way back into the darkness. Rachel, her eyes wide, held her breath as the snarling, snapping wispy forms floated past her. Her heart hammering, Rachel listened to Violet scream hysterically. \"What have you done!\" she cried out from the darkness. Violet rushed forward into the light. Rachel could see Violet through the ghostly things going back into the cave toward her. Violet's eyes grew big as she saw them coming for her. \"What have you done!\" Violet screamed again. Rachel didn't answer. She was too terrified as she watched. \"Rachel-help me! I've always loved you! How could you do this to me!\" \"You did it to yourself, Queen Violet.\" \"I've always been a kind and loving person!\" \"Kind and loving?\" Rachel could hardly believe her ears. \"Your life has been devoted to hate, Queen Violet.\" \"I only hated those who did me wrong, who were evil and selfish!

I hate the air you breathe!\" Rachel nodded. \"You made your own choices, Violet. You always chose to embrace hate instead of life. You came down into this cave because you chose to hate. You betrayed yourself with that hate.\" When the ghostie gobblies got closer to Violet, they howled in voices that Rachel could only imagine must sound like the cries of the dead in the underworld. It made her flesh prickle. She pressed her back against the stone wall of the cave and stood frozen in fright as she saw those teeth that had been meant for her rip into a shrieking Queen Violet. Rachel knew that only when they were finished and the bones had been picked clean would their summoning born of hate be complete. Only then would they finally vanish for good. CHAPTER 42 Verna glanced up when she heard the commotion. It was Nathan, at last, his arms swinging in time with his long legs, his l ight cape billowing out behind as he marched briskly toward them.

Cara, pacing impatiently, finally stopped to watch the approaching prophet and cluster of people following in his wake. As vast as the palace complex was, it had taken a considerable length of time to find Nathan and get him and the others down to the tombs. Nathan came to an abrupt halt. \"I'm going to have to bring a horse into this place to get around faster. First I'm wanted here, then I'm wanted there.\" He flourished an arm, indicating the grand scale of the palace. \"I spend most of my day rushing from one end of this sprawling monstrosity to another.\" He scowled at those watching him. \"What's this about, anyway? No one will tell me anything. Have you found something? Is it Ann and Nicci?\" \"Keep your voice down,\" Cara said. \"Why? Afraid I'll wake the dead?\" he snapped. Verna expected Cara to meet his sarcasm with something caustic of her own, but she didn't. \"We don't know what we've found,\" she said, her worry clearly evident in her demeanor. Nathan's brow only bunched all the more at her cryptic answer. \"What do you mean?\" \"We need your ability,\" Verna explained. \"My gift doesn't work very well in this place. We need the use of the gift to help us in this.\" His suspicion growing, he took in General Trimack standing beside him, and then Berdine and Nyda waiting behind Cara.

As you know, I think something is wrong down here.\" \"So you've said, but for all the searching I still don't see anything wrong down here.\" Cara gestured around. \"You don't know this place very well. I've lived here most of my life and even I'm not familiar with the maze of passageways down here. In the past the tombs were usually only visited by the Lord Rahl. The crypt staff, though, spends a great deal of their time down here keeping it always ready for those visits, so they know the place better than anyone.\" Nathan rubbed his chin as he again cast a look over his shoulder, back up the corridor at the white-robed figures huddled in the distance. \"That makes sense.\" He turned back to Cara. \"So, what do they have to say?\" \"They're mute. Darken Rahl selected only illiterate people from the countryside to be members of the crypt staff, so they can't read or write, either.\" \"Selected.

Since they can't read or write, they also can't secretly write anything offensive about the dead leaders.\" Nathan sighed. \"He was a harsh man.\" \"He was an evil man,\" Cara said. Nathan nodded. \"I've never heard anything to dispute it.\" \"Then how do you know what the crypt staff thinks about anything that might be wrong down here?\" General Trimack asked Cara. \"After all. they can't tell you or even write it down.\" \"You use hand signals to direct your men when silence is critical, or when in the heat of battle they can't hear you. These people do similar things. They use signs they've made up over the years to communicate with each other. I've questioned them and to a certain extent they've been able to make themselves understood. As I'm sure you can well imagine, they are very observant.\" \"And wait until you hear what they think,\" Verna said. The whole thing seemed preposterous to her, but the implications were serious enough that she wanted to know for sure.

Still, she didn't have to be happy about it. Nathan's suspicious look returned. \"So, what do they think?\" Cara pointed toward an intersection down the corridor. \"Back around there they found a place that isn't right.\" \"Isn't right?\" In exasperation, Nathan put his hands on his hips. \"Isn't right in what way?\" \"The stone down here all has veining in it.\" Cara turned and pointed out various patterns on the wall behind her. \"See? All the people on the crypt staff recognize the veining. They keep track of where they are down here by those unique patterns.\" Nathan peered closely at the veining. \"It's a language of symbols,\" Cara added. Nathan looked away from the veining and back at Cara. \"That makes sense. Go on.\" \"In that corridor there, down a ways, is a slab of marble wall that belongs somewhere else.\" Nathan's suspicion returned as he viewed her askance, as if playing along but not liking it one bit. \"So, where does it belong, then?\" \"That's just it,\" Cara said. \"They can't find the hall where it belongs. Near as I can understand, what they're trying to tell me is that there is a corridor missing.\" \"Missing?\" Nathan heaved a deep sigh. He scratched his head as he glanced around. \"Where could a corridor be hiding?\" Cara leaned toward him just a little. \"Behind that piece of marble.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (587 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He stared at her silently as he looked to be thinking it through. \"So we want you to use your gift and see if you can sense anyone behind that wall,\" Verna said.

Someone hiding behind the wall.\" Nathan ran his hand over the back of his neck as he looked down the corridor toward the intersection. \"Well, as crazy as that theory sounds at least it's simple enough to test.\" He flicked a hand, indicating General Trimack standing beside him. \"And you think the First File might be necessary?\" Cara shrugged. \"Depends on if there is anything unpleasant on the other side of the wall.\" The general was looking not just concerned, but alarmed. He was responsible for guarding the palace and everyone in it-especially the Lord Rahl. He was dead serious about his job. The general waggled a hand in the direction of the suspected trouble \"And you think there is?\" Cara didn't shy from the general's formidable stare. \"Nicci and Anne disappeared somewhere down here.\" The scar running down the side of the man's face stood out white. He hooked his thumbs behind his weapon belt as he turned to the side. One of his men rushed forward to take his orders. \"I want all of you to stay close, but be very quiet.\" The officer nodded and then trotted silently back to the other men file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (588 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 to relay the orders. \"Just who do you think it is that could be hiding behind the wall?\" the general asked as he looked between all the women. \"Don't look at me,\" Verna said. \"I'm concerned, but I can't imagine who or what could be there, if anyone. I don't know that I believe any of this, but at the Palace of the Prophets I knew people on the staff who would pick up on the strangest things, things that no one else had been aware of. I have no idea what this is about, but I don't dismiss the worries of people who know this place better than I.\" \"That makes sense,\" the general said. Nathan started out. \"Let's go have a look, then.\" As she followed behind, Verna was relieved that she'd been able to convince Nathan of the seriousness of the matter. She didn't necessarily believe it herself, but she wanted to support Cara. Cara was the sort of person who deserved to be given the benefit of the doubt. The Mord-Sith had been frantic with worry for Nicci. She hadn't slept much recently. As far as Cara was concerned, Nicci was not just a friend, but a link to finding Richard. They all moved as silently as possible. Cara led the way, with Nathan following. Verna stayed back a little with Berdine and Nyda. General Trimack, with his large force of men, brought up the rear. Around the corner and down the suspect corridor, a few torches farther down hissed and sputtered. One of them appeared to be about spent. The staff, though, had been kept away. The general file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (589 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 signaled his men. Half a dozen of them collected torches from back up the hall and brought them along. Cara snapped her fingers to get the general's attention. She motioned for half the men to go past and guard the corridor from the other side. She apparently wanted the place sealed off. Cara sent some of the other Mord-Sith with the soldiers. At the marble wall Cara traced a finger along the lines of the face in the stone. By now, even Verna recognized that particular face. \"They say that this face doesn't belong here,\" Cara whispered when Nathan leaned close to her. Nathan nodded and then stood up straight. He waved a hand, urging Cara to stay back out of his way. Cara frowned and gave Verna a puzzled look. She didn't know quite what the old wizard was doing. Verna knew. He was using his ability to sense beyond the stone. He was using his gift to search for life. Verna could do a similar thing, although not with the same level of success as a wizard, but she couldn't do it at all in the palace. In the People's Palace any gift but a Rahl's was suppressed. Verna had tried to sense beyond the wall when they had first been told of the place by the crypt staff, but she hadn't been at all successful. Cara returned to stand beside Verna. She leaned close, speaking in little more than a whisper. \"What do you think?\" \"I think Nathan will tell us when he knows anything.\" General Trimack leaned in. \"How long?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (590 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Not long,\" Verna told him. As Verna watched, Nathan's face suddenly went white. He staggered back a step. Seeing his reaction brought Cara's Agiel up into her fist. Berdine and Nyda spun their weapons up to hand as well. Nathan staggered back another step. His hand went to his face in shock. He turned to them, his mouth agape. In a rush of movement, being as quiet as possible, he raced back to them. \"Dear spirits.\" He ran his fingers back through his hair as he looked back at the face on the wall. \"Dear spirits, what?\" Cara growled. Nathan, his face nearly as white as his hair, turned his azure eyes on the Mord-Sith. \"There are hundreds of people on the other side of that wall.\" Cara was speechless for only an instant. \"Hundreds? Are you sure?\" He nodded vigorously. \"Maybe thousands.\" Verna finally recovered her own voice. \"What people? Who are they?\" \"Don't know,\" Nathan said, his head swiveling back and forth between their faces and the face in the marble wall. \"I can't begin to imagine.

I can't tell who they are, only that they are back there.\" Cara started across the corridor. \"I say we find out.\" The general gave quick hand signals to all his men. They quietly started moving in from both sides. \"Just how do you think you can find out?\" Verna asked, following on Cara's heels. Cara paused and looked back at her a moment. She turned to Nathan. \"Can you use your gift to, to, I don't know-knock the wall down, or something.\" \"Of course.\" \"Then I think we-\" Cara fell silent when Nathan held up his hand.

She knew that he was listening with his gift, not his ears. It was frustrating in the extreme that she couldn't do the same. \"The light went out for them,\" he said in a low voice. \"Their lamps all of a sudden went dark.\" Everyone turned to the wall when muffled voices came from beyond. There was no gift needed to hear them. Men were complaining about not being able to see, wanting to know what was happening. Then they heard a scream. It lasted only an instant before abruptly going silent. Muffled shouts rose in dismay and growing panic. \"Break it down!\" Cara called to Nathan. Suddenly shrieks erupted from the other side of the wall-men crying out now not only in terror but in shock and pain. Nathan lifted his arms to cast a web that would bring down the wall. Before he could act, the white marble exploded out toward them. Fragments of stone blew apart with a deafening noise. A big man, bloody sword in hand, came crashing shoulder-first through the wall at a dead run from the other side. He fell sliding across the floor. Pieces of white stone of every size and shape sailed through the corridor. Large sections of marble broke free and came crashing down. Beyond the chaos of flying stone shards and boiling dust Verna saw snatches of darkly armored men with weapons in hand. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (593 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 They looked to be in a state of bewildered battle, fighting an unseen enemy. Their roar of voices rose in anger, confusion, and terror. Through the cloud of dust and debris Verna could see that there was a dark corridor beyond filled with a massive jumble of Imperial Order soldiers. Through the thundering noise and turmoil, people fell through the breach in the wall. Big tattooed men wearing dark leather armor, straps, studs, and chain mail, several with missing arms, others with their faces cleaved open, crashed heavily to the ground. A head, greasy ropes of hair flailing, tumbled through the chalky stone dust. Men missing a leg toppled out. Others, their middles ripped asunder, stumbled through the mess. Great gouts of crimson blood splashed across the white marble floor. In the middle of all the flying stone, billowing dust, disembodied heads tumbling across shattered marble, men falling, screaming, dyin; and the confusion of blood and bodies spilling out into the corridor Richard, with mortally wounded men toppling away to either side, sweeping his sword with one hand, holding an unconscious-looking Nicci up with his other arm around her waist, plunged through the breach in the dark wall of soldiers.

As Richard slid under the flying blades and blood, he laid Nicci on the floor, letting her limp form, atop a layer of slick stone dust covering the polished stone, slide the rest of the way across the hall and out of harm's way. Richard immediately spun around, bringing his sword to bear on the wall of men descending on him as they spilled out of the dark corridor and into the torchlit halls. He sliced mercilessly into every opening. They fought fiercely to get at him and bring him down. Blade slashed muscle and hit bone. The noise was deafening as men growled, some yelled battle cries, and others screamed in mortal pain. Richard evaded their fierce attacks, and at every opportunity thrust his blade through the onslaught. Every one of his swift strikes found its mark. For every man he killed, though, it seemed three more replaced him. Cara crashed into a big man with a shaved head as he went for Richard. Using both hands, she slammed her Agiel across his throat. For an instant Richard saw the shock of pain in the man's eyes before he went down. Richard used the opening to turn and thrust his sword into another soldier to the side. All the men who had been quietly gathering in the dark corridor appeared to be experienced fighters.

They had believed that as they quietly crept into enemy territory they were safely hidden. In a moment of confusion and alarm when it had gone dark in the corridor they had been gripped by overpowering fear of the unknown. In those brief bewildering moments men had begun dying without understanding how or why. Richard had used that surprise to tear through their ranks as swiftly as possible. The last thing he had wanted to do was get bogged down in hand-to-hand fighting. His purpose had been to get through, not to engage the enemy. With Nicci, Jillian, and Adie to escort, it was all he, Bruce, and General Meiffert could do to cut their way through without slowing when confronted. Within the palace Adie's ability to help them had diminished. That had been trouble. As surprised as the hiding Order troops had been when in the dark, they had quickly recovered and were now in their element: battle.

Already they were trying to back away from Cara, only to have other Mord-Sith spring up and take them down. Richard saw Berdine and Nyda ramming their Agiel to the backs of heads or thrusting and twisting them against big chests to kill instantly. Everywhere men screamed in agony. Not far away the First File charged into the Imperial Order soldiers from both sides at once. Richard saw General Trimack leading his men into the teeth of the battle. The First File were the elite of the elite, more than a match for the Order soldiers not only in size but in ability. The D'Haran troops were all battle-hardened men who were well versed in deadly tactics that gave them a feared and well- deserved reputation. Several men in dark leather armor, their faces twisted in hate and rage, rushed toward Richard. Before he could bring his sword to bear, yet other big men stepped right in front of them, blocking their ability to get to Richard. With lightning strikes from the elbows of the two men, the necks of the Order soldiers were ripped open, severing carotid arteries. Richard blinked when he saw that it was Ulic and Egan, two great blond-headed bodyguards to the Lord Rahl.

Yet other troops pouring out of the breach in the wall were cut down by gifted means cast at them by Nathan. Flashes of explosive light sliced through men in chain mail, sending shards of hot steel ricocheting off the walls, floors, and ceilings.

Egan tossed him aside like a rag doll and immediately went after another Order soldier. \"Get back!\" General Meiffert yelled at Cara when she returned to rush back into the thick of the battle. \"I have to-\" \"Move!\" he yelled at her at the same time he rammed her back with a hand. \"I said move!\" \"Nathan!\" Richard cried out over the roar of noise when he saw the opportunity that General Meiffert had just opened up by forcing Cara back out of the way with him. When the prophet turned to his name, Richard pointed to the dark corridor the general had just cleared. \"That's all of us! Do it!\" Nathan understood and didn't waste an instant. He immediately brought his hands up. Light ignited between his palms. Wizard's fire erupted into life from the gathering light, sending glimmering colors and light flickering over the scene of the pitched battle. Without pause Nathan cast the wizard's fire into the enemy. The deadly sphere of bubbling, boiling, liquid light tumbled away. The white-hot inferno expanded as it hurtled through the air.

The wizard's fire shot down the corridor, casting an orange-red light across the white marble. The sound alone was enough to stiffen men in panic. It was a horrific sight as burning death splattered across living flesh. The growing sphere of liquid fire stayed aloft as it skipped across the heads of the men, all the while spilling death down on them until the tumbling inferno burst into a cascade of molten light and flame splashing down into the terrified mass of men. The shrieks of agony drowned out the clash of steel in the battle. Nathan conjured yet more wizard's fire. In an instant it, too, was away. The sphere of fire tumbled down the dark corridor, careening off walls and men, spilling flames, catching everything ablaze. The liquid flame was so tenacious, so sticky, so fiercely alive with searing heat that it melted its way through tough leather armor and sloshed right through chain mail to cling to flesh as it burned. Men on fire tore at their clothes, trying to get the fire off them, but they couldn't. Wizard's fire, once on a person, would often burn down to bone before it went out. Even as men started to pull off leather armor plates that the sticky, liquid fire was burning through, it was too late. Their clothes were already melted to their skin and they only ended up pulling off their own flesh. Fire enveloped faces.

The men of the First File were already bearing in, rolling them under, spearing men who couldn't move in the crushing weight pressing in from both sides. They had no choice but to fight for their lives. In this battle, there would be no surrender allowed. General Meiffert hacked a man across the shoulder. Bruce used both hands on the hilt of his sword to thrust it down into a man who fell sprawling on the floor at his feet. As another man, his face twisted with rage and hate, went for Richard, Richard swung, burying his sword halfway through the man's head just below his eyes. He yanked his sword back as the man dropped to his knees crying out in unexpected fright. Berdine, in her red leather like all the Mord-Sith, stepped in and pressed her Agiel to the base of his skull, finishing him off. Nathan launched another expanding, tumbling, twisting sphere of wizard's fire down the hall. The relentless inferno of death was sickening to behold as it splashed down through crowds of men who had thus far avoided it. Men on fire frantically tried to escape the growing conflagration. There was no escape. They were trapped not just by the flames, but by their numbers and by the dead all around them. They had no choice but to scream in agony and desperate panic as they burned alive. Whorls of flame curled in the open mouths of those shrieks.

She looked more angry at him than at the man she had just killed. \"What do you think you're doing yelling at me-telling me what to do?\" \"My job. You were in the way of what Lord Rahl was attempting to do.

He had been trying to get the general, Bruce, Jillian, and Adie out of the way so that Nathan could bring wizard's fire to bear. The general had realized Richard's intention.

Richard could only imagine that Jagang was trying to kill her, but the spell around the palace was impeding that effort. It was putting her through a slow and agonizing death. He turned. \"Nathan! We need you!\" Past the fallen forms of dead Imperial Order soldiers, Richard saw Nathan kneeling beside someone. Richard had a terrible feeling that he knew who it was. Nathan looked up, staring sadly, helplessly at Richard. \"Nicci-hold on. Help is coming. I promise I'll get that collar off you. Hold on.\" He seized Cara's arm and pulled her close. \"Stay with her. I don't want her to think she's alone.

Jillian took up Adie's hand and held it to her breast. Nathan stared with tired, watery eyes. \"I'm sorry, Richard, but this may be beyond my ability.\" Richard swallowed back the lump in his throat as he looked down at Adie. She gazed up at him with her completely white eyes, looking very much at peace despite what had to be terrible pain. \"Adie, we made it. Your plan worked. You did it.

He reached out, then, and placed both hands on the smooth metal collar around her neck. He closed his eyes for a moment, his brow drawing down with the effort of using unseen powers.

CHAPTER 44 Cara, sitting on her heels beside him, laid a hand compassionately on Richard's shoulder as he bent over Nicci. He felt dead himself. He wrapped Nicci protectively in his arms, unable to offer her any real protection, any salvation-unable to offer her redemption from Jagang's claim on her life. The totality of the events that had carried him to that point in his life seemed to overwhelm him. No matter what he did, the believers in the Imperial Order advanced their cause steadily onward. In their fanaticism, they were determined to wipe all joy from life, to squeeze any meaning from it, to curdle existence itself into unbearable misery.

Richard hated them. He hated them passionately for all the harm they inflicted on others. He wished he could wipe them all from the world of life. Nicci, despite being largely unresponsive, tightened an arm around his neck as if to comfort him in his grief, as if to tell him that it was all right, that she too, like so many all around who had fought and died to defend their way of life, the right of their loved ones to live safe from violence brought against them for simply desiring to live free, would soon be at eternal peace beyond the reach of pain. Even though he knew that she would at last be free of terrible suffering, and out of Jagang's reach, Richard couldn't bear the thought of her leaving the world of life. At that moment, everything seemed futile to Richard. Everything good in life was being methodically destroyed by people who fervently believed that their pious purpose in life was to murder those who would not bow down and submit to the Order's beliefs. The world was in the grip of utter madness. So many had already died, so many more would die. Richard felt as if he were caught in a whirlpool, forever being sucked down into the depths of despair. There seemed no end to the senseless slaughter, no escape from it but death. And now Nicci was taking that final journey. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (609 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:14 PM]"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He had just wanted to live his life with the woman he loved, the same as so many others. Instead, Kahlan's mind had been stolen from her, leaving her a tool of those with a burning desire to either impose their beliefs on everyone or to destroy them all. While he might have helped Kahlan get away for the moment, Jagang's minions would be hunting her. None of them would ever give up. Unless they were stopped, the Order would have Kahlan just as it would have everyone. Now Nicci was being slowly drained of her life as well. As Richard turned inward, turned away from everyone and everything, he felt a sudden, violent, wrenching jolt within.

He didn't know the source of the inner disorientation, but it suddenly felt as if he had become lost among a million meteors.

He had no idea why or how, but it had returned. The thing that kept him conscious, though, kept his mind focused, was his seething rage at those who through the self-justification of their own twisted beliefs harmed others who didn't think as they did. In that moment as his blinding rage at all those who existed to hate and hurt others again flowed through that integral connection with his gift, he heard a metallic pop. Nicci gasped.

This had not been the first time that he'd been pressed into service as the Lord Rahl, protector of the bond, only to have Richard return to reclaim the title. Before he could really think about it, he heard an odd noise. It soundec like something crackling, possibly burning, followed by a thump. As the men around him parted to let Richard and Nicci through, he saw a mar-moving toward them. At second glance, Richard wasn't sure what he was seeing. It seemed like a soldier of the First File, but then again it didn't. The uniform looked somehow indistinct. General Trimack, concerned with helping Richard, extended an arm. easing some of his men back out of the way to let Richard get past. Richard, though, had paused. He was looking at the soldier not too far away making his way through the carnage. The man didn't have a face.

A soldier of the First File, helping an injured man and seeing only the semblance of a First File uniform approaching from behind and the side, straightened. He turned a little, lifting an arm out as if to ask the man in his peripheral vision to stay back. The faceless man reached up and touched the soldier's arm.

The dissolving mass began to coagulate into a blackened mass. As everyone stood stunned, watching, it burned without flame, drying and cracking and curling until only ashes were left. \"You used your gift,\" Nicci said, her head hanging. \"It found you.\" Richard nodded to no one in particular. \"Berdine, please get Nicci to somewhere where she can get some rest.\" Richard hoped that she could recover, that she would be all right.

She knew that Six could move as silently as a snake, and that she had no difficulty getting around in complete darkness. It wouldn't surprise Rachel in the least if she found out that the woman had a forked tongue as well. Rachel had been so deep in concentration as she'd worked on the drawing of Richard that she had not just lost track of time, but she had, to a degree, forgotten where she was. She had been so absorbed in what she'd been doing that she had forgotten her sense of caution. She didn't know that she could be so absorbed in anything.

Rachel couldn't help glancing over her shoulder in confusion. \"Old queen?\" She looked back at the witch woman. \"Violet wasn't old.\" Six smiled that smile she had that made Rachel nearly wet herself. \"The moment she died she was as old as she would ever be, don't you suppose?\" Rachel didn't try to untangle the riddle. She was too scared to think. Six abruptly stepped into the light. \"How old do you suppose you are at this moment, little one?\" \"I don't know, for sure,\" Rachel said as honestly as she could.

Rachel didn't think that Six had a happy smile, just that clever one, the one that let people know she was thinking dark, witchy things. The witch woman aimed a long bony finger at the drawing of Richard. \"That was a great deal of work, you know.\" Rachel nodded. \"I know. I was here when you and Violet did it.\" \"Yes,\" Six drawled as she watched Rachel the way a spider watched a fly buzzing in its web. \"You certainly were, weren't you?\" The woman stepped closer to the drawing. \"This here\"-she waggled the finger at one of the places Rachel had altered-\"how did you do this?\" \"Well, I remembered what you told Violet about terminal elements.\" Rachel didn't say that she knew what a \"terminal element\" was, but she did. \"I remember you saying how that junction locked it, by means of the azimuth angle, to the person to enable the spell to locate them and then attach the proper parcels.

Six pointed the bony finger. \"This here. Why did you add that line? Why didn't you simply erase the junction?\" \"Because I reasoned that it would only weaken the hold of the spell if I did that.\" Rachel pointed at several other elements. \"These here support the main elements as well, so if I erased that junction it would have still held.

She wasn't feeling very smart herself at the moment, what with being so easily caught and all. Six folded her arms as she paced before the huge drawing, inspecting Rachel's handiwork.

He had some grand plan that involved extracting revenge, and he was not simply going to give up on that plan. As soon as the Sisters healed the emperor, he would no doubt be in an ugly mood and determined to do whatever he had to do in order to get her back. Jagang was not a man who tolerated being denied what he wanted. No doubt the Sisters would be coming after her as well. For all Kahlan knew it was possible they were already on her heels.

Considering what had been at risk, she supposed that she couldn't blame him for wanting to get away as fast as possible. She wondered why she wasn't invisible to Samuel. Like Richard, he appeared to have come to the camp specifically with the intention of helping her to escape. Kahlan felt sick that Richard hadn't been able to get away as well.

It would have rendered everything he'd sacrificed meaningless. She couldn't remember ever being so torn over anything. Kahlan knew that the Sister would not have treated him well.

I will, soon.\" \"What about all the corridors down here?\" Richard asked Nathan. \"We've just finished clearing them all. Found quite a few Order soldiers trying to hide.

The casket had been pushed aside, exposing the stairway down.

He was so tired that the book in front of him was starting to swim in his vision. He had read so many books recently that he had long ago lost track of how many days it had been since returning to the People's Palace. The Ja'La match, the riots, Kahlan escaping with Samuel, getting back into the palace, and the ensuing battle already seemed a lifetime ago. With the help of Verna and several other Sisters, Nathan had been able to heal Adie. After she had rested, though, she insisted on once again setting out on her solitary journey. Because the place diminished her power, she was virtually blind inside the palace. Richard could understand why she would want to leave, but he wondered if, through her powers as a sorceress, she saw no future in staying in the palace. Richard wasn't sure that there would be a future anywhere to worry about.

The people of the Old World had begun to understand the bitter reality of the war they had been eager to set loose on others. Their smug gloating over the way their troops were bringing the heathens to the north to heel had turned to sleepless fear that those heathens might be about to visit vengeance on them. Crowds for those who preached the teachings of the Order were thinner. There were even places where revolts against the rule of the Order had broken out. Jagang, however, did several things to counter that effort. First, he had authorities clamp down swiftly on any hint of insurrection. Towns that were suspected of sympathizing with the cause of freedom were torched, all the people were tortured to extract confessions, and executions by the thousands were ordered. Questioning the rule of the Order brought terrible consequences. Actual guilt was only a minor consideration. Punishment and the exertion of authority were the objectives, so suspicion was enough to bring brutal treatment. People had quickly shrunk into fearful obedience, only too eager to provide anything demanded by the new dictates for supplies. That widespread fear of being suspected of treason to the cause of the Order had dramatically increased the amount of supplies available to be sent north, so the additional supply trains had no difficulty collecting what was needed.

That's what warriors did; they adjusted their plans to fit the circumstances they encountered. The enemy made adjustments, you had to counter.

Richard knew from personal experience that from high in the air it was much easier to locate and spot troops. It was an effective hunting technique. With a witch woman's talent, it was all the more deadly. The tactic had not only reduced the effectiveness of the attacks in the Old World, it had been killing a great many D'Haran troops for nothing gained, making the work for the ones still fighting all that much more difficult. With the increased supplies and the attacks from above, Jagang appeared, despite the greater cost in lives and supplies, to be getting what he needed to continue the siege of the People's Palace. That was all that mattered to him. It now appeared that it would be those in the palace who would not be able to hold out. Once the ramp was completed, and if they discovered other catacombs to also get through, then the Order's legions could attack the palace from both the top and bottom.

Such an attack would be costly to the Imperial Order, but Jagang didn't care about the cost in lives to his army, he only cared about his objective. Sooner or later he would take his objective. When that happened, and Richard knew that it was inevitable, the cause of freedom would be ended. They would be finished. Richard's only hope now was to find a way to use the boxes of Orden. Of course, he didn't have any of the boxes, but even if he did he didn't yet know how to use them. He needed to learn how to do that, first. Knowledge was now his best weapon. He was determined to arm himself well. The room he and Nicci were in was a private library that, according to Berdine, was filled with forbidden volumes-books meant for the Lord Rahl alone. Powerful shields protected the mahogany double doors of the arched entrance. Darken Rahl had sometimes asked Berdine to help him translate High D'Haran, but she said that this room was one she rarely visited. She said that he usually came here alone. Richard and Nicci had decided that this was a good place for them to start. Berdine was searching other libraries, along with Verna and nearly all of her Sisters. Anything deemed to be of possible help was brought to Nicci. She personally checked everything brought in to see if it was something Richard needed to concern himself with. Some of the more experienced Sisters were proving quite valuable at ferreting out important sources of relevant information. Nicci also kept people away from Richard so he could concentrate on reading and on the wide array of things she was teaching him. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (637 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 In some ways he felt like a recluse. But it also left the mood in the quiet retreat focused, which was just what Richard needed. Low bookshelves in the private sanctuary were placed near the richly paneled walls, leaving the center open for couches and chairs. It made the room look more like a quiet study than a library. Small statues decorated the tops of some of the shelves, helping them to appear to be display stands rather than bookshelves. Richard hadn't yet ventured up the narrow, iron spiral stairs to the small balcony on the opposite wall, but Nicci had. As he read, she'd brought books that she thought were important down to add to the stacks awaiting his attention. Although the room didn't have the look of one of the typical libraries filled with row upon row of books, the discreet shelves in the room still had to contain thousands of volumes. The ones they were interested in, though, were somewhat rare, even for this place. Still, the heavy mahogany table he sat before was piled high with books Nicci had laid out. From within the library there was no way to tell if it was day or night. The heavy, dark blue velvet draperies were closed. Opening them wouldn't have helped since there was only wood paneling behind. The curtains were only meant to give the illusion of windows and to quiet the room. There were ample lamps, though, along with a fireplace. They gave the place a warm glow, making it look cozy and inviting. Richard felt neither. They worked without pause as much as possible. Food was brought in so they wouldn't have to stop. When they could keep their eyes open no longer, they slept for a time on the couches. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (638 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci, never far from him, paced through the shadows and shafts of light from the reflector lamps hung on the polished, dark brown, white-veined marble pillars standing at uniform intervals throughout the library. She scanned yet another book, seeing if it was something he needed to read, only to walk back to the shelves and replace it. Richard's burning urge was to act. He desperately wanted to go after Kahlan. He knew, though, that it wasn't that simple. To really go after her he had to learn how to use the power of Orden before it was too late to ever get her back. He knew that it would be impossible for him to do such a thing on his own. Nicci had, without hesitation, agreed to be his teacher. The first thing she had done had been to explain the complexities of sterile fields. She wanted him to fully understand the implications. Richard was no expert in magic, and he certainly didn't know how to use his ability at will, but Nicci had made the principles understandable to him. At first, he found it hard to grasp. He couldn't understand what harm such foreknowledge could really do. Nicci insisted that the wizards who had created Orden to counter a Chainfire event were convinced that foreknowledge of a certain emotional nature would taint the magic they were creating and thus taint Orden itself. Richard had been dubious. She told him how Zedd was the one who had explained to her that foreknowledge tainting magic was no theory, but that it was true. He had told her that Richard himself had proven it by falling in love with Kahlan without her Confessor's power harming him.

While he never revealed the solution to Nicci, Zedd did tell her that Richard had to be totally unaware of a solution even existing, or that solution would not have worked, so she was sworn to secrecy on even that small part of it. Zedd had told Nicci that Richard himself had proven the central question of Ordenic theory-that foreknowledge can affect the functioning of magic. He had proven it with Kahlan. Richard knew all too well what Nicci was talking about, even if she was in the dark about parts of it. Because of experiencing such a thing firsthand, he recognized the true gravity of the situation. He knew that, just as his foreknowledge of a solution to loving a Confessor would have made that solution fail, Kahlan having foreknowledge of his profound emotional connection to her would make Orden fail. It was no theory, as the wizards who created Orden had thought. It was true: foreknowledge tainted a sterile field. Richard, of all people, grasped that concept on a visceral level. To know in his heart, and to also fully comprehend, that he couldn't allow Kahlan to learn about the two of them being in love tied his insides in knots. At the moment, though, that eventuality was only a distant concern. It was one problem that he sincerely hoped to someday have. He had a lot more to learn before he ever reached that point.

It wasn't, in her opinion, so much a matter of Richard not growing up learning about magic that made it difficult for him to control his ability, but that the gift of a war wizard actually functioned differently from a sorceress's or a typical wizard's gift. Richard's power wasn't simply tapped, she'd explained, but worked through intent via his feelings in much the same way that the Sword of Truth functioned. In this sense, the Sword of Truth turned out to be a kind of primer on how his own ability worked. The sword functioned according to what the person wielding it believed. It wouldn't harm a person who they believed to be a friend, but it would destroy anyone they believed was an enemy. The reality didn't matter; it was what the person believed to be true that drove the magic of the sword. That was the critical concept at the center of both the sword and his gift as war wizard. Feelings-emotions-were the internal sums of what one had collected, observed, experienced, and grasped about life all delivered in an instant: an interior life viewpoint thrust forward as emotion. That didn't mean, however, that those concluding judgments, in and of themselves, were correct. Just as with the sword, his gift worked in conjunction with what he valued. It was incumbent upon the intellect to sift out legitimate values and provide well-reasoned justification to make those emotions not only true but moral. That was why it was vital that the right person be selected to wield file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (641 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 the Sword of Truth. That person had to be someone with the ability to make those judgments for sound reasons. Also much like the sword, his gift worked through anger. Anger was actually a projection of his values in that it was a reaction to threats to those values. Thus, his gift was ignited by his anger at whatever threatened what he valued-for example those he loved, or even the ultimate human value of life itself. Nicci had told him that for all she knew he might never learn to control his ability directly, the way other gifted people did. She said that she suspected that the reason for this was that a war wizard's gift was fundamentally different, serving a different purpose than the gift in others, such as the gift to be a healer, or a prophet. The implication in everything she'd learned was that anger was a key element in the ability of a war wizard. After all, war was not properly entered into out of joy or a lust for conquest, but in response to a threat to values. Of more immediate concern to Richard, however, was learning to use the power of Orden to reverse the Chainfire spell. Nicci had been shocked to see the designs and symbols Richard had painted on himself and the other men. She recognized that he had combined familiar elements into completely new forms. But she also wanted to know how he had managed to integrate elements pertaining to Orden. Richard had explained that he had come to learn that some of the parts of the spells Darken Rahl had drawn to open the boxes of Orden were also parts of the dance with death, and he knew the symbols relating to the dance with death quite well. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (642 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 In a way, that association made sense. Zedd had once told him that the power of Orden was the power of life itself. The dance with death, used with the Sword of Truth, was really about preserving life, and Orden was itself drawn from the power of life and centered around preserving it from the rampages of the Chainfire spell. In a way, the Sword of Truth, the ability of a war wizard, and the power of Orden were all inextricably linked. Those links brought to Richard's mind First Wizard Baraccus, the man who had thousands of years before written a book, Secrets of a War Wizard's Power, for Richard. That book was meant to help him in this quest. That book was still hidden in Tamarang, where Richard had stashed it when Six had held him prisoner for a brief time. Richard knew that Zedd had been headed there to see if he could get the spell drawn in the sacred caves removed from Richard. Since Richard's gift had returned, his grandfather had obviously been successful. Now that Richard was reconnected with his gift, he remembered even word of The Book of Counted Shadows. Nicci was convinced, and had convinced Richard, that the book he had memorized could only have been a false copy that could not be used to open the correct box of Orden. She believed, however, that even being a false copy it very likely still contained all, or most all, of the elements necessary to open and use the correct box of Orden. To make the version Richard had memorized a false copy would have required only a single file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (643 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 sequence of necessary elements being out of order, but that didn't mean that the elements themselves weren't valid and therefore important and necessary. To that end, Richard had recited the entire book for her. They had made note of every element from the book. If he learned how to create or draw each of those elements, then when they got their hands on the true copy of The Book of Counted Shadows, he would simply have to use those components that were actually necessary by rearranging them in the proper order as revealed by the true copy of the book. For this reason, Nicci now knew what she needed to teach him. And Richard was farther along this path than she would have thought because he already understood many of the key elements involved. He already knew a vast array of the basic parts used in the spell-forms. He had, in fact, drawn them on his whole team and himself. The dance with death had already taught him the basics of those designs, making them by now seem almost intuitive to him. Richard had discovered that drawing the spell-forms was in fact a natural extension of not just the symbols employed in the depiction of the dance with death, but how he fought with a blade, and how he carved statues. At their base, all of those seemingly different things had basic parts in common. All of them shared movement and flow. For Richard it was astonishing to discover how it all fit together into a larger picture. As he drew the spell-forms Nicci was teaching him it didn't feel awkward or difficult. It felt natural. He already knew the forms. He recognized in those forms not only the file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (644 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 dance with death, but movements with a blade, both from fighting and from carving statues. Nicci, too, was unique as a teacher because she understood not only how much Richard knew about his varied abilities, but how he used his ability. She grasped, unlike anyone else, how he saw the use of magic. She recognized how different it was from the conventional wisdom and wasn't in the least bit stymied by the way he viewed such things. If anything, it energized her. She also comprehended his concept of the the creative aspects of magic itself and so she didn't try to correct what he did, but instead guided him to accomplishing what was needed. She didn't just pile on things to memorize; she instead built on what he already knew and the way he saw things. Because she intuitively sensed what he already grasped on his own, in his own way, she didn't waste time dwelling on lessons covering what he already understood, and instead helped him add things he needed, at the place he needed them, when he needed them. Nicci strolled to the table. \"How are you doing?\" Richard yawned. \"I don't know anymore. It's all running together in my head.\" Nicci nodded absently as she read something in the book she was holding. \"What you think is running together may mean that your interior mind is simply beginning to make associations and connections- organizing what you are adding to your knowledge.\" Richard sighed. \"Could be.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (645 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci closed the book and tossed it on the table to the side. \"There are some useful things in here. You should take a look.\" \"I don't think I can see straight to read any more right now.\" \"Good,\" she said. She gestured to the pen resting in a holder to the side. \"Draw, then. You need to be able to draw those elements from the book you just finished. If the real Book of Counted Shadows has similar elements, you will be ahead of the game.\" Richard wanted to argue with her, to tell her that he was too tired, but then he thought about Kahlan. Weariness became irrelevant in that light. Besides, he had agreed that Nicci was going to teach him and he would not only do as she instructed but put his every effort into it. She was a sorceress with invaluable knowledge, experience, and ability that Zedd had said amazed him. Even Verna had taken him aside and advised him to listen carefully to Nicci, that she was in many areas smarter than any of them. Richard knew that this was his only true opportunity to learn what he needed. He was not about to waste that opportunity. He pulled a piece of paper close and then dunked the pen in the ink. He leaned close and started drawing spell-forms from a book laid open nearby. One big problem they had not yet solved was the issue of sorcerer's sand. According to The Book of Counted Shadows that he'd memorized, the spell-forms needed to open the correct box of Orden had to be drawn in sorcerer's sand. Nicci had told him that even though the book he'd memorized was a false copy, the issue file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (646 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 of needing to draw the spell-forms in sorcerer's sand when the time came was true. Whatever spells turned out to be the ones necessary simply wouldn't work without it.

Up in the garden of life there was no more of that precious commodity. There was only dirt left where the sorcerer's sand had been. Nicci looked up from another book she was thumbing through. \"This has some information about the Temple of the Winds.\" Richard looked up. \"Really?\" She nodded. \"You know, the thing that baffles me about that is how you said you crossed the world of the dead to get to it.\" It had appeared during the lightning and Richard had crossed over on a road while it was visible. \"I'm sorry, Nicci, but I told you everything I know on the subject.\" \"According to this, and to what you told me you learned from studying accounts in old books, the Temple of the Winds was sent to the underworld.

Maybe it's like the island isn't really across the ocean, but just right there, close to the shoreline.\" Nicci shook her head. \"Not according to this, and not according to the things you told me. Every reference says that to banish the temple to safety they sent it across the underworld-rather like sending it across the universe itself.\" \"Lord Rahl,\" Cara called from the doorway.

He needed to learn all of it if he was ever to get Kahlan back. \"It seems to be important,\" Cara added when she saw him hesitating. \"All right, bring them in.\" Cara led a group of six people in pristine white robes into the room. In the somewhat dark library, the white-robed figures almost glowed like good spirits. They all came to a halt on the other side of the massive mahogany table. They looked to Richard more like people fearing they might be executed than like people who wanted to see him. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (648 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard looked from the six nervous people, five men and one woman, to Cara. \"These are some of the crypt staff,\" she said. \"Crypt staff?\" \"Yes, Lord Rahl.

They all looked away from his gaze to stare at the floor as they remained silent. \"Yes, I remember seeing some of you when I first came back-when we had the battle down there with the Imperial Order soldiers.\" He couldn't imagine the horrific mess that would have had to be cleaned up. He had ordered that the bodies of the Order soldiers be thrown over the side of the plateau. They had more important things to worry about than caring for the remains of murderers.

As Richard reached for it, a drop of ink dripped from his pen onto the white cloth. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled as he set the pen aside. He pulled the cloth closer. He looked up at the six. \"So, what is it?\" When they made no attempt to explain, he glanced at Cara. She only shrugged. \"They were insistent that you see it.\" One of them gestured with his hands held out flat, almost as if they were the pages of a book as it opened, then repeated the gesture. \"You want me to open it?\" All six nodded. It didn't really feel like it could contain anything at all, but Richard carefully started opening the folds of cloth back onto the table. Nicci, standing beside the six, leaned over the table watching. When Richard laid back the final fold, there, in the center of the cloth, lay a single grain of white sand. He looked up sharply. \"Where did you get this?\" All six pointed down. \"Dear spirits,\" Nicci whispered. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (650 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"What?\" Cara asked, leaning over to look at the single grain of white sand sitting in the center of the cloth. \"What is it?\" Richard glanced up at the Mord-Sith. \"Sorcerer's sand.\" The people were crypt staff, so that had to mean that they had found it down in the crypt somewhere. The sorcerer's sand shone with prismatic light, but he was still somewhat astonished that they would have found a single grain of it. He also wondered where they had come across it-and if there was more. \"Can you show me where you found this?\" All six nodded vigorously. Richard carefully folded up the cloth back around the grain of sorcerer's sand. He noticed as he did so that the place where the drop of ink had fallen had, because the cloth had been folded at the time, made two identical spots of ink on opposite ends of the cloth. When the cloth had been folded they had been together, touching, but when the cloth was opened the two spots were on opposite sides.

It was the tomb, after all, of his grandfather. These were people who had lived and died by the incomprehensible protocol of the previous Lord Rahl visiting his venerated ancestors. Richard, though, reserved his reverence for those who deserved it. Panis Rahl had been a tyrant with ambitions of conquest little different from those of his son, Darken Rahl. Panis Rahl might not have managed to accomplish the level of evil his son had, but it wasn't for lack of trying. In the war Panis Rahl had started against neighboring lands, Zedd, as a young man, had been the one called upon to lead free people against D'Haran aggression. In the end, Zedd, acting as First Wizard, had killed Panis Rahl and put up the boundaries that had for most of Richard's life walled off D'Hara. Even though many had eagerly supported Panis Rahl's lust for conquest, Zedd had not wanted to kill all of the people of D'Hara. Many of them, after all, were also the victims of that tyranny; having been unfortunate enough to be born under a tyrant was not a willful act on their part. So instead of killing all the D'Haran people, Zedd had put up the boundaries. He said that, in the end, leaving them to suffer the consequences of their own actions was the worst punishment he could inflict upon them.

Kahlan made his life worthwhile. She was his life. Richard remembered years before, shortly after Darken Rahl had opened the box of Orden and been taken by its power, that one of the palace staff had come to tell Zedd that Panis Rahl's crypt was melting. Zedd had told the man to use specific white stone to seal the tomb before the condition spread to the rest of the palace. That stopgap of white stone sealing the entrance of the tomb had since mostly melted and the strange condition was beginning to damage the entire room. The walls were beginning to distort, causing the slabs of pink granite to be pushed out of their former flat plane. In the hallway outside, the joints between the ceiling and walls were coming apart from the deformation within the room. If it wasn't stopped, it looked like it could continue to twist support walls until the structure of the palace eventually started falling in on itself. Richard looked all around, taking appraisal of everything as he crossed the room. The light of fifty-seven torches reflected off his grandfather's gold-enshrouded coffin sitting on a pedestal, making it not only glow in the center of the cavernous room, but almost look as if it were floating above the white marble floor.

I asked Verna if she remembered anything I might have said, but she said that she didn't.\" Richard lightly dragged a finger along his grandfather's casket. \"Chain-fire.\" Nicci looked up, even more concerned. \"Do you really think that's the reason?\" \"You don't remember any of it?\" She shook her head. \"No. I don't remember ever telling Verna that I knew the cause of the problem, but what's worse is that I don't file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (654 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 remember ever knowing why the walls were melting. How could I forget something important like that?\" Richard stared into her troubled blue eyes for a moment. \"I don't think you could, if things were normal.\" \"That can only mean that the damage from Chainfire is spreading beyond the original target of the spell.\" \"It's the contamination,\" Richard said in a quiet voice. \"If that's true, then that means that whatever is going on in here is connected to what we must do to reverse Chainfire. The contamination in the chimes is erasing memory to protect itself.\" Such a frightening concept gave Richard pause. He knew, though, that it made sense. Now he had to worry not only about how Jagang might be one step ahead of him, but about how the contamination with Chainfire might also be acting to defend itself from extermination. It didn't need to be sentient to react to preserve itself and continue its purpose. To the chimes, eliminating magic was a value, and the contamination they left in their wake was their method of accomplishing that value, so such self-defensive measures were probably integral, much as thorns were sometimes a bush or tree's means of self-defense. Having thorns didn't mean the tree was able to think of how to hurt anyone who came near; it was merely its integral means of protecting itself so that it could continue to exist. \"We have to reverse Chainfire or it's only going to continue to grow worse,\" Richard finally said to Nicci. \"It won't be long before we even forget why we have to reverse it.

Somehow we need to get them back.\" \"Since Six is doing Jagang's bidding by attacking our troops down in the Old World, I think we must assume that she intends to give him the third box.\" Richard traced a finger along some of the lettering on Panis Rahl's casket. \"I think you're right. It's only a matter of time before Jagang has all three boxes, if he doesn't already.\" \"We have something they need, though,\" Nicci said. \"We do? What?\" \"The Garden of Life. Since translating The Book of Life I've come to see the Garden of Life in a different way. The book confirmed some of the conclusions I had previously come to, after the last time I saw the garden. \"I now understand the Garden of Life through the context of the magic of Orden. I've studied the position of the room, the amount of light, the angles in relation to various star charts and how the sun and moon traverse the place. I've also analyzed the area within the room where the spells relating to Orden had been invoked-their specific placement in relation to the other elements.\" Richard was intrigued. \"You mean to say that you really think that the Garden of Life is necessary to open one of the boxes?\" \"Yes.

That certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility, but the elements all brought together in that room are very exacting. Re- creating it would be a complex undertaking.\" \"But it would be possible for him to do such a thing?\" \"He would need the original references from which the plans for the Garden of Life were derived. He would also need the aid not only of sorceresses, but wizards. Lacking everything necessary to do it on his own, he would have to study the Garden of Life itself in order to know how to construct a new one. The only practical solution would be to duplicate what was already built here, since all that preliminary work has already been successfully carried out.\" \"Well, if he could get into here to do that, he might as well use this one.\" Nicci leveled a look at him. \"Exactly.\" Richard sighed with grasping just how far behind Jagang's true motives they truly were. \"No wonder he hasn't been worried about opening the boxes before now. He needed to get here, first. Taking the People's Palace has been part of his larger goal all along. He's known all this time what he needed to do.\" \"Seems that way,\" she admitted. Berdine stepped through the melted opening into the tomb. \"Lord file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (657 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Rahl, there you are.\" Richard turned. \"What is it?\" \"I found this book,\" she said, holding it up as she strode across the room, as if waving the book would explain everything. \"It's in High D'Haran. When I translated some if it and realized what it was, Verna told me to get it to you right away.\" Nicci took the book from Berdine when the Mord-Sith held it out to her. She opened the cover and started scanning the text. \"So, what is the book about?\" Richard asked Berdine. \"It's about Jillian's people. Her ancestors from Caska, anyway.\" \"The dreamcasters . . .\" Nicci whispered to herself as she followed along in the book. Richard frowned. \"What?\" \"Nicci's right,\" Berdine said. \"It's about how the people in Caska were able to cast dreams. Verna said to tell you that.\" \"All right, thanks.\" \"Well, I need to get back. There are some other books Verna needs to have translated. And don't forget,\" she said over her shoulder as she started away, \"sometime I need to tell you the things I found out for you before-about Baraccus.\" Richard nodded to the Mord-Sith's quick smile. Nicci tucked the book under her arm. \"Thanks, Berdine. As soon as we're finished here, we'll look into it.\" Richard watched Berdine leaving for a moment, then gestured to the inscriptions on the walls. \"This all looks rather disturbing.

A number of the elements look vaguely familiar.\" \"They should,\" Nicci answered cryptically. She pointed out one of the inscriptions on the far wall. \"See there? It's instructions from a father to a son on the process of going to the underworld and returning.\" \"You mean, Panis Rahl wanted to pass these spells down to Darken Rahl, so they were chiseled in the walls of his tomb?\" \"No,\" Nicci said, shaking her head. \"I believe that these spells have been passed down through the House of Rahl for countless generations- from each father to his gifted offspring who would become the next Lord Rahl. From each father to his son. They are, in a way, your birthright.\" Richard felt rather overwhelmed with the thought of it. \"How old do you think they are? And why pass down spells on going to the underworld?\" \"From the composition of these spells, my guess is that they have existed from the time Orden itself was created.\" Nicci looked over out of the corner of her eye. \"I believe that to use the power of Orden, these spells may be necessary.\" Richard rounded on her. \"What?\" \"Well, from what I read in the books that explained Orden, like The Book of Life, and some of the books on Ordenic theory, I've come to believe that the purpose of such a requirement has to do with the problem of how Subtractive Magic was used in the ignition of a Chainfire event.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (659 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"You mean the problem with memories being eliminated?\" Nicci nodded. \"Why can't the rest of us remember Kahlan? Why can't she remember who she was? Why can't we use our gift to heal people who have forgotten Kahlan, or heal Kahlan? Why can't our gift restore those memories?\" Richard recognized Nicci, the instructor, asking her student to provide the answer on his own. Richard was more than familiar with the technique. Zedd had used it on Richard his whole life. \"Because those memories are gone. There is nothing to restore.\" \"And how were they taken?\" Nicci asked, lifting a questioning eyebrow. Richard thought it was obvious. \"Through Subtractive Magic.\" Nicci only stared at him, as if waiting for more. Understanding dawned on him. \"Dear spirits,\" he said in a whisper. \"Subtractive Magic is the magic of the underworld.\" He stepped closer to her. \"Are you saying that in order to use the power of Orden, going to the underworld is necessary because those things that were taken with Subtractive Magic are only able to be recovered there?\" \"If memories are to be rebuilt, there must be a kernel to grow them from. The memory you have of her is your memory, not Kahlan's missing memory, not Zedd's, not Cara's-not anyone else's. The substance of their missing memory is what is gone from this world. It no longer exists.

So if it still exists at all, it only exists in the underworld.\" Nicci gestured around at the High D'Haran words cut into the granite walls and on the casket. \"The Book of Life, which Darken Rahl had to have read to have put the boxes of Orden in play, says that part of the process of invoking Orden is going to the underworld.\" \"But what memory would Darken Rahl have recovered when he traveled to the underworld?\" \"Invoking Orden requires prescribed steps. Going to the underworld is one of the steps to be performed in the sequence of invoking Orden.\" She gestured to the walls. \"Those steps.\" \"But those references say only that going to the underworld is required. Why don't they lay out the purpose of the journey?\" \"The purpose of that journey is to recover the core of memories, but Orden doesn't know what is necessary, or who the object of Chainfire was going to be, so it only provided for the step to be undertaken. It doesn't say what must be done there. It is just a tool for the person trying to reverse Chainfire. It is up to them to do what is necessary when undertaking that journey. \"Berdine is the one who first showed me The Book of Life. She knew where it was because she had seen Darken Rahl using it. He went to the underworld.

It requires a guide. Not just a guide, but a guide whom the person embarking on such a journey had to win over and who is now absolutely loyal-even in death.\" \"A good spirit I can trust with my life.\" She nodded and then pointed at a place in the inscriptions. \"See here? This is a spell for calling the guide from the underworld to come and take you where you must go.\" Feeling rather sick at the thought, Richard looked around at the writing. He pointed to one of the places in the High D'Haran script, then another place on a different wall. \"Look here, at these references. These spells require sorcerer's sand.\" \"They certainly do. Perhaps we had better ask the crypt staff where they found that grain of it you have in your pocket.\" Overwhelmed by the things he was learning, Richard had almost forgotten why they had come down to the tomb in the first place. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (662 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"You're right,\" Richard said as he signaled Cara to bring the six people in white robes into the tomb. The six hurried to follow after her like chicks following a mother quail. Richard waited for the covey to gather. They all peered up at him expectantly. \"You all did a great service by finding that grain of sand. Thank you for being so attentive.\" By the way they beamed, Richard didn't think that a Lord Rahl had ever thanked them before. He laid a hand gently on the shoulder of the one woman. \"Can you show me where you found the grain of sand you brought me?\" She looked to the others and then knelt down before the gold casket in the center of the room. She pointed at the floor under one corner of the casket resting a few feet up on a pedestal. She crooked the finger at Richard. He knelt down beside her, ducking his head under the casket when she did so. She pointed up at a corner on the bottom of the casket that was separating. Richard rapped on the corner with the heel of his hand. Some sand poured out, the tiny grains bouncing across the white marble floor. Richard stood in a rush. He shared a startled look with Nicci. \"Bring me your axe,\" he called to one of the First File watching from the hallway just outside the room. The man quickly dipped his head through the melted opening and rushed over to hand Richard his axe. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (663 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard forced the razor-sharp edge into the tight joint where the top was fitted to the rest of the casket. He wiggled the blade, forcing it in deeper. As he rocked the handle, the top began to loosen and lift. With Nicci's help, he raised the top off the casket. When he signaled with a tilt of his head, the crypt staff and the soldier took the weight of it from Richard and Nicci and set it aside. The inside of the casket was filled to the brim with sorcerer's sand. Richard stood staring down at it a moment. Light from the torches reflected from the sand in a broad spectrum of tiny sparkles of color. He gently brushed the sand away from the body beneath. There, embedded in the sorcerer's sand, appeared the charred skull of Panis Rahl, his grandfather, still bearing the burns of wizard's fire that Zedd, his other grandfather, used to destroy the tyrant. A few drops of that living fire had splashed onto the young Darken Rahl, engendering in him a burning hatred for Zedd and all who opposed the rule of the House of Rahl. \"Now I know why this place is melting,\" Nicci said. \"It's a sympathetic reaction to the Subtractive Magic that was used to open one of the boxes of Orden up in the Garden of Life.\" Richard looked over at her. \"So it's a harmonic response after having been in the vicinity of that specific power.\" With the edge of a finger Nicci carefully pushed some stray grains back inside the coffin. \"That's right.

He died before ever using this here, so it was left hidden here for the last several years. But it's still hot from the sympathetic reaction. That's why the room started to melt. This place isn't a proper containment field for this.\" \"Don't tell me-the Garden of Life is constructed as a containment field for such things.\" Nicci blinked at him as if he had just suggested that water was wet. \"Of course.\" \"Then we need to get this up to the Garden of Life.\" Nicci nodded. \"Verna and her Sisters can do it, with Nathan's help. They can get this moved for us.\" Nicci took hold of his arm with a fierce urgency. \"Now that we have the sorcerer's sand in which to draw the spells, we need to get back to our studies. We may not have much time left.\" \"I'm not arguing. Let's go.\" CHAPTER 49 I don't feel anything,\" Richard said. Sitting cross-legged on a wedge of white stone set in the otherwise complete ring of grass that swept in a circle around the sorcerer's sand, he looked up at Nicci standing behind him with her arms folded, watching him draw the spells. \"You're not supposed to feel anything. You're constructing spells, not making love to a woman.\" \"Oh. I thought I would ... I don't know ...\" \"Swoon?\" \"No, I mean feel some connection to my gift, some kind of nervous file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (665 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 fervor, or delirium ... or something.\" Her blue eyes slowly surveyed the latest components. \"Some people like to add in emotional elements when they draw spell- forms because they like to feel the rush of their heart pounding, the pit of their stomach tightening, or their skin crawling-that sort of thing-but it's entirely unnecessary. Mere theatrics. They think they should moan and sway when they're doing such things.\" Her eyes turned to him, an eyebrow arching with a taunting expression. \"If you want, I can show you how. It might make a long night a little more entertaining.\" Richard knew she was just trying to teach him something about the reality of what he was doing by making him feel silly for interjecting the remnants of superstition into what she was trying to teach him was an exacting methodology. It was the kind of lesson that Zedd used to use, the kind of lesson that stuck, that wouldn't be forgotten as so often happened with an equivocal response. \"Some people like to be naked every time they draw the spell- forms,\" she added. \"No, thanks.\" Richard cleared his throat. \"I can do without moaning, or my heart racing, or my skin crawling, or being naked as I draw.\" \"I thought you might feel that way. That's why I never suggested such additions to the basics.\" She gestured to the drawings in the sand. \"Whether or not you feel anything, your gift contributes what is essential.

Don't worry, though, there will be things you must draw naked,\" she added. Richard knew about those spell-forms. He didn't like to dwell on them any more than necessary. Nicci cocked her head a little as she gazed down critically at the angled double lines he was drawing. \"Kind of like making bread. If you add the right things, in the right way, the dough does what it's supposed to do. Shivering and shaking doesn't help the dough rise or the bread bake.\" \"Uh-huh,\" Richard said as he went back to dragging a finger through the sorcerer's sand, folding an arc around the angled element. \"Just like bread. Except that if you do it wrong it can kill you.\" \"Well, I've had bread that I thought might kill me,\" she murmured absently as she carefully watched what he was doing, her body leaning almost as if to help him curve the line just so. Nicci had been able to re-create some of the elements he was drawing from the book Berdine had brought to them when they'd been in Panis Rahl's tomb. Some of the spell-forms had been broken down and diagrammed in the book. For others, Nicci's understanding and experience were invaluable, enabling her to infer some of the remaining parts of the spell-forms from the text alone. In that way she had re-created everything necessary. Richard had been worried that the book didn't actually illustrate everything that the process needed, and that Nicci might be inferring wrongly.

For Richard, this was also a practical test, a chance to use the things he had been studying day and night before the challenge that was to come, the one that would take him into the world of the dead. They didn't have the boxes, of course, but once the boxes were in play there were preliminary procedures that could be done without them. Those measures, considering how dangerous they were, were not something that Richard was looking forward to, but he had no choice. If he wanted to get Kahlan back, along with everything else he needed to accomplish, then there were things he was simply going to have to do, no matter how much he feared them. At least his ancient benefactor, First Wizard Baraccus, had left a number of clues to help him. Now that Richard had been reconnected with his gift, he also needed to recover the book that Baraccus had left for him: Secrets of a War Wizard's Power. If there was ever a time that he needed the information that would be contained in that book, now was that time. The book, along with the war wizard outfit, much of which also used to belong to Baraccus, was hidden in the castle down in Tamarang, not far from the wilds. Unfortunately that was also where Richard had last seen Six, just before Commander Karg had captured him and taken him to the Imperial Order encampment. As Richard carefully drew the spell-forms, he was also impatient for the emperor to start losing sleep, start feeling tense and distracted.

It was time for Jagang to start having nightmares. Richard could just hear the harsh croaks coming through the glass above them. He glanced up and saw Jillian's raven, Lokey, perched on the framework of the glass, watching them. From high in the sky the raven had followed his lifelong friend throughout her captivity, feasting on the ample refuse throughout the camp. Lokey had seemed to consider the whole thing, as he considered most things in life, nothing more than a curious holiday. Jillian had known that Lokey was there, but she never let on lest one of Jagang's guards shoot the bird with an arrow. Lokey was a wary bird, though, and seemed to vanish whenever anyone took notice of him. Jillian said that a few times when she came out of Jagang's tent she saw the raven fly high above and do stunts to show off for her. Being a captive of Jagang, though, Jillian hadn't been cheered by the antics of her raven. She had been in a state of constant terror. A few flakes of snow were beginning to collect in the corners of the leaded glass. Against the night sky the inky black bird was mostly invisible. Sometimes only its bill and its eyes reflecting the torchlight could be seen, giving it the appearance of a ghostly apparition watching them. From time to time the raven tilted its head as if it, too, were evaluating Richard's tedious work. As it flapped its wings to animate its raucous caws, moonlight appearing from time to time between the scudding clouds reflected off its glossy black feathers. The raven was impatiently waiting to do its part. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (669 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Are you ready?\" Richard asked, still concentrating as he drew a line in the sorcerer's sand.

Sitting in the center of a place cleared for her in the sorcerer's sand, with spells drawn all around her, she was looking very solemn. She knew that this was the purpose for which her grandfather had selected her, trained her. She was the priestess of the bones, meant to cast dreams to protect her people. Torches ringing the sand in the center of the lawn softly hissed. Their flames slowly wavered in the dead-still air. The dark band painted across Jillian's face, across her copper-colored eyes, was meant to hide her from evil spirits. As the priestess of the bones, she was now Richard's servant. Richard, as the Lord Rahl, was now the one meant to help her cast the dreams. It was an ancient connection between their people, meant for mutual protection. What they were casting, however, was not exactly dreams. They were casting nightmares. Jillian's people were from Caska. She had been learning to be a teller, someone respected for their knowledge of the ancient times and her people's heritage. Her grandfather was the living teller, the one teaching her the old knowledge, the lore of their past. Someday that legacy would be passed to Jillian.

Then, as now, they had cast dreams to repel the horde from the Old World to the south. In that great war they had failed and been all but destroyed. Richard and Nicci had listened carefully to the tellings, to everything Jillian knew about those ancestral times. Between that, the book, and his own knowledge of the relevant history, Richard had pieced together what had happened. Most of Jillian's ancestors had been killed, but a number had been captured and turned over to the wizards from the Old World, who coveted their unique ability. Those people were used by the wizards as the raw material to create human weapons. What those wizards had conjured from the captives had become the dreamwalkers-men used not to cast dreams. but to invade them. Now Jagang was the only living dreamwalker, the living link to the great war from three thousand years before, the war that had reignited. From what Richard had learned, a dreamwalker had been born into the world again because an enemy spy had gotten into the Temple of the Winds and tampered with magic banished there. Wizard Baraccus had found a solution-insuring that Richard would be born with both sides of the gift in order to counter that threat. Jillian's people were descended from the same stock Jagang had come from. His ancestors had once been dreamcasters, like Jillian. And now Jillian was once again, as the priestess of the bones, about to fulfill her ancient calling of casting dreams to repel the invaders . . . with one exception.

I only had dreams.

But I'm only a girl. Are you really sure that I can cast nightmares to all those men?\" Richard looked up into her eyes. \"Those men have come to kill everything you love.

You must only think them; it is I who casts them as needed. It's your thoughts along with my strength that does it.\" \"I can sure enough think of nightmares.\" She smiled a little, then. \"And you're sure enough strong, Lord Rahl. I guess it makes sense when you both put it like that. Now I understand why I've needed you to cast dreams. That's why the priestess of the bones had to wait for you to return to us.\" Richard patted her arm. \"The other thing you need to remember is that after Lokey flies around the camp, you must send him to land on Jagang's tent.

CHAPTER 50 Jennsen winced as the muscular guard twisted her arm and shoved her through the tent's opening. She stumbled but was able to keep herself from falling. After riding through the sprawling camp in the bright winter sunlight, she found it difficult to see in the somber royal quarters. She squinted, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dim light. She could see the hulking shapes of guards to either side. Jennsen turned to a commotion behind her and saw the same big soldiers pushing Anson, Owen, and Marilee, Owen's wife, through the opening and into the tent as if they were herding animals to slaughter. Jennsen hadn't seen much of the others over the course of their swift journey north. All of them had been kept gagged and blindfolded for most of the way to make sure that they were little more trouble to bring along than the rest of the baggage and supplies. It made Jennsen's heart ache to see her friends back in the clutches of such evil people. It felt like a recurring nightmare. In the distance, on the other side of the tent's large outer room, Jennsen saw Emperor Jagang sitting behind a heavy table, eating. Dozens of candles standing to each side of the table gave that end of the room the appearance of an altar in the inner sanctum. Slaves waited in a line against the back wall behind the emperor. The table was spread with an abundance of food, enough for a banquet. Jagang looked to be eating alone. The emperor's black eyes were watching Jennsen as if she were a pheasant he was considering beheading, gutting, and roasting for file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (674 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 the reclusive feast. He lifted a hand and with two fingers glistening with grease signaled her closer. Large rings on his fingers, as well as long jewel-encrusted chains around his neck, glimmered in the candlelight. Followed closely by a frightened Anson, Owen, and Marilee, Jennsen crossed the thick carpets to stand before the emperor's table. The candle stands lit a table spread with ham, fowl, beef, and sauces of every sort. There were nuts and fruits, as well as a variety of cheeses. His terrible gaze never leaving her, Jagang used the fingers of one hand to twist the breast off a small roasted bird. He held a silver goblet in the other hand. He took a big bite, then washed it down with red wine from the goblet. She knew it was red wine because much of it rolled down from the sides of his mouth to drip all over his sleeveless lamb's-wool vest. \"Well, well,\" he said as he plunked the goblet down on the table, \"if it isn't Richard Rahl's little sister come for another visit.\" The last time she had come to the emperor's table she had been with Sebastian. The last time she had been a guest. The last time she had not known that she was being used. She had grown up a lot since that day. \"Hungry, darlin?\" Jennsen was starving. \"No,\" she lied.

Plates jumped. Bottles fell over. Goblets spilled. The three people behind her gasped. Jagang shot to his feet. \"I don't like being lied to!\" Fright flashed through Jennsen at his sudden rage. Veins stood out in his forehead. His whole face had gone red. She thought he might strike her dead where she stood. Before he was able to act on his rage, a shaft of light slashed into the room. Two women ducked through the opening in the tent. The heavy wool flap hanging over the opening lowered, allowing the gloom to settle back in. Jagang turned his attention from Jennsen to the two women. \"Ulicia, Armina, any word of Nicci?\" The two, obviously taken off guard by the question, shared a brief look with each other. \"Answer me, Ulicia! I'm in no mood for games!\" \"No, Excellency, there has been no word about Nicci.\" The woman cleared her throat. \"If I may ask, Excellency, do you have reason to believe she may be alive?\" Jagang cooled visibly. \"Yes.\" He sank down into his elaborately carved chair. \"I've had dreams of her.\" \"But, the link to the Rada'Han went dead. There is no way she could have gotten it off without help. Perhaps they were nothing more than dreams.\" \"She's alive!\" Sister Ulicia dipped her head in a bow. \"Of course, Excellency. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (676 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 You would know better than I about such things.\" He rubbed his forehead with the tips of his fingers. \"I haven't been sleeping well of late.

I thought the executions after the riots would spur them into being more devoted to their duty. This is for our cause, after all. Perhaps if I throw some of the slower workers from the top of the ramp that would hurry the rest of them.\" \"Well, Excellency,\" Sister Ulicia said as she stepped forward, looking eager to turn his attention away from his dark and violent thoughts, \"we have something that we think may make you feel a great deal better about our progress.\" He looked up sharply, then scooped his goblet off the table and took a long drink. He set the goblet back down and squeezed off a fistful of ham from the large platter of it sitting just to his right. After taking a bite from the meat in his hand, he gestured to the two Sisters. \"What is it, then?\" \"A number of books were brought back with Jennsen. One in particular is . . . well, Excellency, we think you should see it for yourself.\" Jagang was looking impatient again. He rolled a hand. Both women rushed forward at the command. Sister Armina held up the book Jennsen remembered seeing brought up from the secret underground room in the graveyard. \"The Book of Counted Shadows,\" she said. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (677 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Jagang looked to each woman's eyes, then held both hands out to the side. A slave immediately stepped forward with a towel and started cleaning the emperor's hands. When Jagang tilted his head toward the table, other slaves stepped in to start clearing platters and bowls away. After they had cleared space on the table a young woman, dressed in an outfit that revealed far more than it concealed, rushed in to wipe the wooden tabletop. As Jagang was still having his hands cleaned, Sister Armina set the book down before the emperor. He slapped the slave's hands away and turned to the book. He leaned over as he opened the cover and began inspecting the text inside. \"Well,\" he finally asked as he turned pages, \"what do you think? Is it the true copy or a false one?\" \"It's not a copy, Excellency.\" He looked up with a frown that seemed like it might turn lethal. \"What do you mean it's not a copy?\" \"It's the original, Excellency.\" Jagang blinked, unsure that he'd heard her right. He leaned back in his chair to stare up at the woman. \"The original?\" Sister Ulicia stepped close. She leaned across the table and turned the pages back to the beginning. \"Look at this, here, Excellency.\" She tapped a place to show him. \"This is the maker's mark. It's his seal containing a spell to signify that this is original.\" \"So what? Maybe the seal is false.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (678 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Sister Ulicia was shaking her head. \"No, Excellency. That's just not the way it works.

Most have no seal at all. Sometimes the man who copies the original makes his own mark so that his work can be identified and to make sure it is recognized as a copy.

It was found hidden behind barriers and shields. This is the original.\" \"What about the others?\" \"None have a seal like this. Not one of the three even has a mark of the man who made the copy. In fact, none have any kind of mark at all. They are simply copies.

This was apparently an argument they'd already had. She shot Sister Armina a murderous scowl before once again turning her attention to the emperor. \"The book says that a Confessor is in essence used to verify the copy, Excellency, not the original.

Jennsen woke suddenly to the strangest sound. As she came out of a dead sleep it seemed like a roaring noise of some sort. At first she thought that it must be Emperor Jagang having another of his nightmares, but the sound was followed by a great commotion outside. Men shouted for others to get out of the way, or in fear. Metal clattered in what sounded like stacked lances being tipped over by scattering men. She heard the roar again, closer, and more shouting. Jennsen saw the guards at the entrance to the tent peek out from the edge of the hanging covering the opening. She feared to get up from her spot on the floor. Jagang had told her to stay there. As violent as the man could become in an instant, she knew better than to test him. Anson looked questioningly to her. Jennsen shrugged. Owen took Marilee's hand. The three of them were obviously frightened. Jennsen shared the feeling. Jagang stormed out of his bedchamber, still buttoning his trousers. He looked tired and groggy. Jennsen knew that with the nightmares file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (681 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 tormenting him he was not getting much sleep. He was about to speak when the flap over the opening pulled to the side. The noise of the pandemonium flooded into the tent. A thin woman stepped through the opening. In the noise and confusion, she moved with the cool, deliberate demeanor of a snake. Just from the sight of her alone, Jennsen wished she could crawl under a carpet and hide. The woman's pale eyes took in the four people on the floor before looking up at the emperor. She ignored the guards. Her pallid skin stood out white against her black dress. \"Six!\" Jagang said. \"What are you doing here in the middle of the night!\" She regarded him almost contemptuously. \"Your bidding.\" Jagang glared at her. \"Well, what is it, then?\" \"A matter of something I agreed to obtain for you.\" She lifted out something that she'd had under her arm. Jennsen hadn't seen it because it was so black that it was almost impossible to see in the dimly lit tent, to say nothing of being held against her black dress. As he stared at the thing she held out, his mood began to brighten. Jagang's eyes were black. Six's dress was black. Midnight on a moonless night in a cave in a thick forest was black. None of those things, though, could compare to the black of what the woman was holding. It was black beyond anything Jennsen had ever seen file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (682 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 before.

I have eliminated patrols when I found them.

He recovered the book and handed it to her. Six held it between the flats of her hands for a long moment. \"Let me see the others.\" Jagang went to a different drawer in the chest and pulled out three more books, all looking to be the same size. He laid them side by side on a marble-topped table, then set an oil lamp beside them. Six glided close, her arms folded, peering down at the three books one at a time. She placed the tips of her long, thin fingers on one of them. Her hand moved to a second book, pausing on it before finally going on to the third. She gestured to the books on the table. \"These three came after.\" She pulled the original book he'd given her out from where she was holding it under an arm and waggled it before setting it down atop the other three. \"This one came first.\" \"Came first-as in original?

She didn't want to do it, didn't want to make pictures that she knew would hurt innocent people, but she knew that a witch woman would have ways to make her do those things. Rachel was afraid of Six, afraid of the woman hurting her. There was no more awful feeling in the whole world than being all alone with someone who wanted to hurt you and knowing that you could do nothing to stop them. She was starting to get tears just thinking about what might be coming, imagining what Six would do to her. She wiped away the tears, trying to think of something, anything, that could help her. It had been a while since she'd seen the witch woman. It might not even be Six-it might be some of the guards bringing her a meal. A couple of the guards were men from before, from when Queen Milena had been alive. Rachel didn't know their names, but she remembered seeing them in the past. There were other men, though, that she didn't recognize. They were soldiers from the Imperial Order. The old guards were never mean to her on purpose, but the new soldiers were different. They were wild-looking men. When they looked at her, Rachel just knew that they were thinking of doing unimaginably vile things to her.

Rachel worried about them catching her alone like this, without Six to keep them away. But the thought of Six coming to hurt her wasn't much better. Rachel had always hated it when she had lived at the castle before, when Queen Milena had been alive. She had lived in fear most of the time. She was hungry most of the time. But this was different. This was worse-and she had never thought it could be worse. She listened carefully to the footsteps outside as they came closer. She realized that it wasn't the sound of a man's boots she heard, but a lighter step. It was a woman's footsteps. That meant that it would be Six. That meant that it was the day she had been dreading. Six had promised that when she returned she would start having Rachel draw for her. The lock clanged as the key turned. Rachel pushed back against the wall, wanting to run but knowing she couldn't. The heavy iron door squeaked as it opened. Light from a lantern flooded into Rachel's stone prison. A form glided in, carrying the lantern. Rachel blinked when she saw the smile. It was her mother. Rachel jumped up in a rush.

You know Richard?\" Her mother glanced down. \"You know him, that's what matters. You know that he is trying to help everyone.\" Rachel nodded. \"I know.\" \"Well, he is going to need some help. I need you to carry a message for me to see if we can get him the help he will need.\" \"All right,\" Rachel said. \"I'd like to help him. I love Richard.\" Her mother nodded. \"Good. He is a man worthy of your love.\" She paused before a heavy door to the side, then squeezed Rachel's hand. \"Don't be afraid, now.

Her mother pushed the door open out into the cold night air. Rachel could see out through the doorway that the moon was up. Because Rachel had been in a dark cell, and there had only been the lamplight, she could see everything outside pretty well. It looked like a courtyard, with stone walls surrounding it. The courtyard appeared to be big enough not only for bushes, but for trees. Together they stepped out into the chilly darkness. Rachel froze stiff when she saw the glowing green eyes staring down at her. Her breath caught in her throat, preventing the scream locked inside her from escaping. Huge wings snapped open, spreading wide. With the moon behind those wings, Rachel could see veins pulsing in the skin stretched across the wings. It was a gar. Rachel just knew that in an instant the beast was going to tear both of them apart. \"Rachel, don't be afraid,\" her mother said in a gentle voice. Rachel couldn't move her legs. \"What?\" \"This is Gratch.

The vapor of its breath hissed out between those fangs up into the cold air. \"Grrratch luuug Raaaach aaarg,\" the creature growled. Rachel blinked. It wasn't a growl, exactly. It sounded like it had actually been words. \"Did it just say that it loved Richard?\" Gratch nodded earnestly. Rachel's mother nodded. \"That's right. Gratch loves Richard. The same as you.\" \"Grrratch luuug Raaaach aaarg,\" the beast repeated. This time, Rachel could recognize better what Gratch had said. \"Gratch is here to help Richard. But we need you, too.\" Rachel finally took her eyes off the huge beast to look over at her mother. \"What can I do? I'm not big, like Gratch.\" \"No, you aren't. That's why Gratch can carry you. And you, in turn, can carry a message.\" CHAPTER 52 Updrafts buffeted Richard as he stood on the narrow road leading from the People's Palace down the side of the plateau. Nathan, standing to his left, leaned over the edge to take a look down the precipitous drop. Even at a time like this the prophet had the curiosity of a child. A thousand-year-old child, no less. Richard supposed that being kept as a prisoner one's whole life could do that to a person. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (693 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Nicci, to Richard's right, was in a quiet mood. Richard couldn't say that he blamed her. Cara and Verna waited behind him. Both looked to be in a mood to throw someone off the side of the cliff. Richard knew, despite appearances, that it was really Nathan who was in the mood to do such a thing. Since he'd found out that Ann had been killed he had been quietly seething. Richard could easily understand such silent rage. Gears squeaked and the heavy catch clattered as the guards worked to turn the crank to lower the bridge. As the heavy beams and planks slowly descended, Richard could finally begin to see the face of the solitary soldier standing on the other side, waiting. The first thing he saw were the dark eyes, glaring across the abyss. The young man was big, just coming into his prime, with a massive chest and arms. Greasy strands of hair hung down to his powerful shoulders. He didn't look to have bathed in his life. Richard could smell him from across the chasm. The young man looked to be developing into a fine brute for the Imperial Order. He was an excellent example of a common Order soldier: a contemptuous, undisciplined thug, a young man governed by his lusts and emotions, and not in the least bit interested in the damage and suffering he caused in order to have what he wanted. He would be without mercy, compassion, or empathy for those he hurt. Their suffering would mean nothing to him. He was completely self-absorbed and devoted entirely to his own wants, not caring what he had to do to satisfy his desires. He was typical of the regular Imperial Order soldiers Richard had seen. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (694 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Unaccustomed to consequences, he was a youth whose muscles had developed far in advance of his intellect, and so he would be only vaguely familiar with what it meant to be a civilized man.

He was a reminder-in all his savage glory-of just what sort of men waited below on the Azrith Plain. Still, the individual standing there by himself, in his dark leather armor plates, straps, studs, tattoos, and belts laden with crude weapons, really meant nothing. It was the mind of the man that mattered. And that mind was infused, possessed, and commanded by a dream-walker, Emperor Jagang. The emperor had made contact with them through the journey book that Verna still carried. Ann had for many years carried the twin of that journey book, but it was now in the possession of Sister Ulicia and, therefore, Jagang. Verna had been been totally surprised by the contact. Richard had not. He had been expecting it. In fact, he was the one who had asked Verna to check in her journey book for a message. Jagang had wanted a meeting. He said he would come alone, but for his own safety in the mind of one of his men. He said that Richard could bring whoever he wanted to the meeting-as many as he wanted, a whole army if he wanted.

Despite the talented people with Richard, he did not delude himself that any of them might just be able to catch the dreamwalker. Of course, the soldier would be dead. But that was just the sacrifice the man would have to make for the cause, as far as Jagang was concerned. No, the people Richard had with him had not been brought to try to kill Jagang through the mind of the surrogate; Richard knew better. They each had been brought for other reasons. The bridge finally thudded down in place. Richard had already given the bridge crew and guards their instructions, so once the bridge had been lowered he gave them the signal and they all started back up the road. Once the crew and guards were out of hearing distance, Richard started across. His entourage was quick to stay close to him. The man on the^other side stood for a moment, his thumbs hooked in his weapon belt, before casually advancing to the middle of the bridge and striking an arrogant pose.

The man's eyes-Jagang's vision-turned to Richard, but then went back to Nicci. \"Well, darlin',\" the deep voice said, \"I see you have managed once again to betray me.\" Nicci returned only an indifferent expression. \"You said that you wanted to meet with me,\" Richard said, keeping his voice calm. \"What's so important to you?\" The contemptuous gaze slid to Richard. \"Not so important to me, boy. To you.\" Richard shrugged. \"All right, to me, then.\" \"Do you care about all those people back there behind you?\" \"You know I do,\" Richard said with a sigh. \"What of it?\" \"Well, I am going to give you a chance to prove it.

He knew from the things he'd studied, and the things that Nicci had told him, that Jagang wasn't bluffing about being able to open the boxes without the Garden of Life. He also knew how dangerous it would be. Unfortunately, he also knew that the Order didn't really care if all life ended. They valued death, not life. Even if they could somehow eliminate Jagang it would make no difference, really. He represented the beliefs of the Order, he did not shape them. In the end, he was hardly the most dangerous part of the Order. It was the evil beliefs the Fellowship of Order taught that were dangerous. Jagang was merely the brute who enforced those beliefs. \"I don't know that I can make such a decision immediately.\" \"I understand. I will give you some time to think it over. Some time to walk the halls of the palace and look into the eyes of those women and children under your care.\" Richard nodded. \"This is the kind of thing I will have to think about. There is much to consider. It will take time.\" The man smiled. \"Of course. Take your time. I give you a few weeks. I will give you until the new moon.\" The man started to turn away, but then turned back. \"Oh, one other thing.\" His dark gaze slid to Nicci. \"You will have to surrender Nicci to me as part of the bargain.

You have until the new moon to surrender the palace- and Nicci.\" The man turned to gaze out at the army spread out below; then he walked woodenly to the edge of the planks and, without a word, stepped out into space. He didn't even scream as he tumbled down through the buffeting updrafts. Jagang wanted Richard to understand just how little he cared about life, and how easily he was willing to take it. Verna and Cara started shouting objections and angry arguments. Richard held up a hand. \"Not now. I have things I must do.\" He signaled to the bridge crew. \"Raise the bridge,\" he called out on his way up the road as he met them on their way back down. Fists clapped to hearts in salute.

Only the day before, Jagang had given him until the new moon to surrender the palace. That moonlight would day by day continue to dwindle until they were enveloped in complete darkness. Richard had listened to Verna, General Meiffert, and Cara's strong sentiment that they should not surrender. Verna thought that surrender would be giving moral sanction to criminal beliefs and they should fight such evil to the death; General Meiffert thought that it was little more than a trick and it would be foolish to believe Jagang would keep his word, so they should never surrender; Cara thought that they were going to die one way or the other, so they might as well fight to the death and in the process kill as many of the enemy as possible. Nathan and Nicci had only listened to the arguments, undecided on whether it would be best to surrender or fight. Richard had pointed out that they were only offering ideas on how they should die, not on how they could prevail. They were thinking of the problem, not the solution. He knew that there was only one realistic way he could ever expect to get close to the boxes of Orden, but it was not something that the others had wanted to hear. Moment by moment time was slipping through his fingers. He knew that he would not be granted more. Richard felt the crushing weight of the responsibility he alone had to bear. He had decided that he could wait no longer; ready or not he had to begin. He felt nothing as he spoke the proper incantations, just as he felt nothing when he drew the spell-forms.

While he didn't have access to the boxes of Orden, or the true copy or original of The Book of Counted Shadows, he knew from the books Nicci had studied, especially The Book of Life, which explained how to initiate the use of the boxes of Orden, that this ritual was a necessary component to using Orden to counter Chainfire. Countering Chainfire was central. If Richard ever did get the chance to use the boxes, he had to be ready to use that opportunity. This was one of those things that he had no choice about. Either he did it, or he could never open the boxes-simple as that. The sooner he made the attempt, the sooner they would know if it would work. Either he lived or he died. If he didn't survive then it was better to let Nicci, Nathan, and Verna have as much time as possible to try to think of another way to avoid the inevitable. The emperor had a variety of options. Richard didn't. Jagang, since he would be opening the boxes through Sister Ulicia, wouldn't have to travel to the underworld. Sister Ulicia was a Sister of the Dark. She already had all the connection with the underworld that she would need to make Orden function for them.

His gift would add what was needed to the elements as he brought those elements into being in the sorcerer's sand. Cause and effect, Nicci had assured him. There was no need for him to feel anything. He was counting on her being right. They were all counting on her being right. Nathan, too, was more than concerned about her being right. The prophet was more worried than ever about the great void and how close they were to it. Richard remembered how Warren had always referred to the boxes of Orden as the \"gateway.\" At the time, when Richard had been at the Palace of the Prophets, Warren had said that the danger was that the boxes, the gateway, had breached the veil and would allow the Keeper of the underworld through into the world of life. Because the boxes were a gateway into the world of life for the Keeper, a way through the veil, they were also a gateway going in the other direction-into the world of the dead. It had occurred to Richard that the boxes might very well be the gateway to the great void that so concerned Nathan. Since the powers Richard was invoking were an integral part of Orden itself, Richard was aware that in attempting to journey to the underworld he very well might be about to be swallowed up into his own great void. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (708 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Richard thought again about the long talk he had had with Nathan.

He began to draw the complex enchantments radiating out from the center axis of the larger spell-form. Each of those elements branched into intricate symbols of its own that he had spent countless hours practicing on paper. Nicci had stood over his shoulder as he'd drawn those symbols, guiding his every movement. Nicci could not help him now, though. This, he had to do by himself, without any help.

Since he was, after all, now conjuring things from the underworld itself, each spell contained elements of the dance with death. It not only had to be the right element at the right time but had to be carried out with precision. In many ways, drawing the spells was the dance with death. In much the way he fought with the sword to stay alive, bringing death to those he battled, the spells were bringing him closer to that cusp between life and death. When he fought with the sword, he knew that any error would result in his swift death. The moves he made with the sword not only had to be the right moves, but they had to be done at precisely the right time and done properly. Drawing the spell-forms was no different. Each move had to be executed properly. Any error would result in swift death. At the same time, it was an exhilarating experience. He had practiced long hours. He knew the forms. He had painted them on himself and his team. Now he lost himself in the movement of drawing those forms, the strokes, slashes, and points, all the while moving with the constant flow of coming close to death but avoiding annihilation. He existed on the cusp of life, the very outer edge of existence. He moved among the forms as if moving among an enemy, moving among death stalking him. It was an all-consuming experience that felt to him just like using the Sword of Truth. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (710 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 In fact, it was all one and the same. From that first day when Zedd had handed Richard the sword across the table outside his house, Richard had in reality been preparing for this. He could feel sweat dripping off his face as he worked. As he drew each form, worked each element to completion without allowing anything to distract him into making a mistake, he lost all sense of time. He was part of the drawings. He was, in a very real sense, in the drawings just as he was in a sword fight when he used the Sword of Truth. His brow wrinkled with the intensity of it. He added each element, laid down each stroke and curve with the precision of a cut with his sword-or with the precision of his chisel when he had sculpted. It was the same skill he applied when using a blade. He was destroying and creating all at the same time. When he at last realized that he had drawn every symbol, completed every spell-form, connected every element, he sat up straighter. His gaze swept over the sorcerer's sand and he at last realized the full horror of what lay ahead. He looked around at the Garden of Life. He wanted to see beauty before he faced the world of the dead. At last, he sat cross-legged and rested his hands palm-up on his knees. His eyes slid closed. He took deep breaths. This was his last chance to stop. In another moment it would be too late to change the course of events. Richard raised his head and opened his eyes. In High D'Haran, he whispered, \"Come to me.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (711 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 There was a moment of dead silence in which he could hear only the soft burning of the torches all around the sorcerer's sand, and then the air itself shook with a sudden wailing roar. The ground shook. From the center of the sparkling white sand, from the center of the spell-forms, a white shape, like white smoke, began to rise. It spiraled around itself in tumbling swirls and eddies as it slowly ascended through the sand, as if drawing itself upward out of the spells themselves. As it came, as it lifted ever upward, the sorcerer's sand beneath it was rent open, allowing the blackness of death to establish a void in the world of life. Richard watched as the white form ascended out of that void, forming into the shape of a figure in flowing white robes. The figure opened its arms, the way a flower would open itself to the world of life and light, until the gossamer robes hung in flowing folds from those widespread arms. The figure floated, suspended above the black void in the white sand. Richard rose up before the figure. \"Thank you for coming, Denna.\" She smiled a beautiful, radiant, and yet longingly sad smile. As Richard gazed at the spirit, she reached out and touched his cheek. It was as loving a touch as Richard had ever felt. In that touch he knew that he would be safe with her... as safe as he could be in the world of the dead.

It filled her with joy, and at the same time terror for Richard, for where that spirit would be taking him. As \\the glowing figure in white robes circled a sheltering arm around Richard, closing him off from the world of life, Nicci stepped forward into the light of the torches. Her forehead beaded with sweat as she watched the gossamer glow gently spiral down into the darkness with her charge. \"Safe journey, my friend,\" she whispered, \"safe journey.\" And then, before the opening had completely closed, before the sparkling white sorcerer's sand had healed itself over again, a dark form came together in the air above. The thing whirled itself into a tight funnel as it followed them down into darkness. The beast had been attracted to Richard through the use of his gift, and now it was pursuing him down into its own realm. CHAPTER 54 Kahlan added another stick to the fire. Sparks swirled up into the late-evening air as if eager to follow after the departing vestiges of red-orange just visible through the bare branches in the western sky.

Lying on the cold ground made for a miserable, sleepless night. Spruce trees were plentiful, though, so she had cut a number of boughs for bedding. Even as thick as the woods were they wouldn't have offered good protection from any wind, but since the clear night was dead calm at least they wouldn't need to build a shelter. Kahlan just wanted to have something to eat and then get some sleep. Before they had built the fire she had taken the opportunity to set a couple of snares, hoping to catch a rabbit, if not to eat that night then maybe in the morning before they started out again. Samuel had collected a good supply of firewood to last the night, then built the fire. After finishing with that he had gone off to a nearby stream down a rocky bank to collect water. Kahlan was bone-weary as well as hungry. They were nearly out of the food they'd brought from the Imperial Order's camp-not that they'd stopped all that often to eat, or rest. Unless they caught a rabbit it would be dried biscuits and dried meat again. At least they had that. It wasn't going to last much longer, though. Samuel hadn't wanted to stop to try to see if they could get more food. He seemed in a frantic urgency to get somewhere. They had a few coins they'd found in the bottom of the saddlebags, but rather than venturing-inta one of the several small towns they had passed near in order to try to get more supplies, Samuel had insisted that they stay well clear of any people._ He was convinced that Imperial Order soldiers would be hunting them.

For all she knew soldiers might be hot on her heels. The thought added an uneasy edge to her chill. When Kahlan asked Samuel where they were going he was vague about it, simply pointing west-southwest. He assured her, though, that they were going someplace where they would be safe. He was proving to be a strange traveling companion. He spoke very little when they rode and even less at camp. Whenever they stopped he rarely ventured far from her. She imagined that he simply wanted to protect her, to keep her safe, but she wondered if it was more that he was watching over his prize. While he had come into the Order's camp to rescue her, he never wanted to talk about his reasons for doing so. One time when she had pressed him he said it had been because he wanted to help her. On the surface it seemed a nice sentiment, yet he never explained how he knew her, or how he knew that she had been held captive. By the way that he was always glancing at her when he didn't think she was watching she thought that maybe he was just bashful. If she pressed him about anything he would typically pull his head down between his shoulders and shrug. She sometimes came to feel that she was torturing the poor man with her questions, and so she would stop and let him be. It was only then that he would seem to relax. Still, all of the unanswered questions gave her pause. Despite everything he had done, and how he helped her at every turn, she didn't trust him. She didn't like that he wouldn't answer such simple questions-such important questions.

She knew, too, that Samuel was fascinated by her. He often seemed eager to do things to please her. He would cut pieces of sausage, giving her one slice at a time until she had to stop him, telling him that she'd had enough, and that he should eat, too. At other times, though, like when he was distracted by his own hunger, he would forget to offer her anything until she asked. Sometimes she would glance over and see him staring at her with those strange golden eyes. In those moments, she thought that she saw the cunning countenance of a thief. She tried to keep a hand on the handle of her knife when she went to sleep. At other times, when she would try to ask questions, he seemed too shy even to look her in the eye, much less answer her, and would hunch back toward the fire as if hoping he could be invisible. Most of the time she had trouble getting more than a yes or no out of him. His reticence never seemed to be out of cruelty, arrogance, or indifference, though. In the end, since it was so difficult getting him to talk and the answers she did get were virtually useless, she had stopped trying. He was either painfully shy, or he was hiding something. In those long periods of silence, Kahlan's mind would turn to thoughts about Richard. She wondered if he was alive or dead. She feared that she knew the answer but was reluctant to accept the finality of his death. She was still astonished recalling the sight of him using weapons, the way his blade moved, the way he moved. He had done so much to help her escape. She feared that he had paid the ultimate price for it. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (716 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 In the still air, thinking about Richard, Kahlan felt a chill that was not from the cold. It was a strange night. Something about it felt out-of-sorts and empty. The world felt like an even more lonely place than usual. That was the thing that bothered her the most-the constant, gnawing emptiness she felt, the terrible loneliness of being isolated from almost everyone else in the world. A part of her life was missing, too, and she didn't know what it was. She didn't even know who she was, other than her name and that she was the Mother Confessor. When she had asked Samuel what a Confessor was he had stared a long moment and then shrugged. She got the clear impression that he knew but didn't want to say. Kahlan felt cut off not only from the world, but from herself. She wanted her life back. In the fading light she made her way over to the exhausted horse as he cropped at the clumps of long grass. There was no currycomb to brush out his coat, so she stroked her hand over the huge animal, cleaning it as best she could, checking for any injuries or burrs. She used her fingers to pry off dried clumps of mud from his legs and then the side of his belly. The horse turned his head back, watching her cleaning off the caked mud. The horse liked her care and gentle touch. He was an animal kept by men who were little more than animals themselves and wasn't used to being treated with kindness and respect, so he knew the value of both.

He neighed softly, nuzzling his head against her. Kahlan smiled and scratched some more, which pleased the horse just fine. His big eyes closed as he soaked in the attention. She felt closer to the horse than to Samuel. To Samuel, the horse was just a horse. He wanted to hurry, and the horse was his means of covering ground. Kahlan wasn't sure if it was so much that he had somewhere to go, or if he simply wanted to put as much distance between them and the Imperial Order as possible. Since he kept to a steady course she supposed that he must have a real destination. If that was the case, then he had some reason to get there in a hurry. If he had a destination, and was eager to get there, then why wouldn't he at least tell her where they were going? As she rubbed behind the horse's ears, he pressed his head a little tighter against her in appreciation. She smiled at the nudge the horse gave her when she paused, urging her to continue. She thought that he was falling in love with her. Kahlan wondered if she was being less kind to Samuel. She didn't mean to be deliberately cold toward him, but since he was being less than candid-and likely evasive-she had decided to trust her instincts and remain businesslike with him. Back at the fire, as Kahlan, sitting on her heels, fed another stick into the flames, she heard Samuel rushing back. She checked the knife at her belt. \"Got one!\" he called as he came into the light of the campfire. He held up a rabbit by its hind legs.

He had to be hungry. She sat back, smiling. \"I guess we get a hot meal tonight.\" Samuel, grasping the hind legs in both hands, hastily ripped the rabbit apart. Kahlan sat up in surprise as he laid a bleeding half of a rabbit before her. Samuel squatted not far away, hunched down facing the fire, and began devouring the other half of the rabbit. Kahlan stared in shock as she watched him eating the raw catch. He tore off a bite of fur with his teeth and swallowed it down. He crunched right through bones. As blood ran down his chin he even ate the entrails. The sight was making her sick. Kahlan looked away to stare into the fire. \"Eat,\" Samuel said. \"It's good.\" Kahlan picked up the hind leg and tossed her half to him. \"I'm not very hungry.\" Samuel didn't argue. He tore into her half. Kahlan lay back, resting her head against the saddle, and watched the stars. To take her mind off Samuel she thought again about Richard, wondering who he really was, and what his connection to her was. She thought about how he fought with a blade. In many ways it reminded her of the way she fought. She didn't know where she had learned what she knew. As she wandered through an internal landscape of shadowy uncertainties, she watched the moon slowly rise. She began wondering why she should continue to stay with file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (719 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Samuel. He had saved her life, after a fashion, after Richard told him how. She supposed that she did owe him some gratitude. But why stay with him? He wasn't providing her any answers or real solutions. She didn't owe him her dogged allegiance. She wondered if she should strike out on her own. She realized that even if she left Samuel and struck out on her own, without knowing who she was where would she go? She saw trees and mountains as they rode past, but she didn't know where she was. She didn't know where she grew up, where she lived, where she belonged. She didn't recognize the land or even remember any towns or cities, other than the places of the dead that she'd gone through after the Sisters had captured her. She was lost in a world that didn't know her and she didn't remember. When she realized that the moon had risen above the trees, she looked over at Samuel. He had long ago finished his meal. He was polishing his sword as it lay in his lap. \"Samuel,\" she called. He looked up as if being yanked out of a trance. \"Samuel, I need to know where we're going.\" \"To a place where we will be safe.\" \"You've told me that before.

He ran adoring fingers over its curves. \"I am the Seeker of Truth. You have a spell that has taken your memory. I have a friend who can help you recover your past, recover yourself.\" Kahlan's heart pounded with the abruptly unexpected prospect of having her memory back. All of her other questions seemed suddenly insignificant. Samuel had never told her that he was the Seeker of Truth. She didn't know what the Seeker of Truth was, but she had seen the word truth in gold wire woven through the silver wire of the hilt. It seemed an odd title for someone so reluctant to offer any information about anything. \"When will I meet this person?\" \"Soon.

She wanted to know her connection to that man with the gray eyes. Richard knew that it was his only chance. Darkness unlike anything he had ever known pressed in all around him. It was suffocating, terrifying, crushing. Denna tried to protect him, but even she had no power to stop such a thing. No one did. \"You can't,\" came Denna's whispering voice in his mind. \"This is a place of nothing.

You will not be able to be here any longer.\" \"I've done what I must.\" \"But you will not be able to find your way back.\" Richard cried out in agony.

His connection to the entry point was gone, broken away by the beast as it tore apart the fabric of the protective spells. There was no way back to the Garden of Life, no way to find something in the middle of nothing. Now escape was all that mattered. The beast was a thing created of Subtractive Magic and it was in a Sub-tractive world. Richard was caught in its lair. In this place there was no help to be had. Denna could do nothing against a conjured creature of this sort, a creature in its own element.

She was his protector in this world, but only in the sense of being his guide to help him find what he needed while keeping him from straying into dangers that would suck him forever downward into darker places yet. She was not his guardian from what might come out of that darkness, and she had no ability to stop a conjured creature that did not exist. \"I have to!\" he cried out, knowing that there was nothing else to try.

When she vanished, and Richard was suddenly alone, enveloped in incomparable solitude and darkness, in the absence of everything, he released Additive Magic into the beast in a world where it could not exist. In that instant, as the concussion of the Additive came into being in the heart of nowhere, the beast, unable to endure such an irreconcilable clash between what was and what was not, between the world of life and the world of the dead, between suddenly containing without any protective buffers an element of Additive in a world of Subtractive, disintegrated out of existence in both worlds. At the same time, Richard felt a stunning blow from every direction at once. There was suddenly ground under his feet. Unable to stand, he collapsed among skulls. Naked men, painted in wild designs, sat in a circle all around him. Shaking with pain and shock, he felt comforting, calming hands on him. From all around he heard words he didn't understand.

It was probably the prophet who had known of the problem he would face, and she must have figured a way to help him by providing a way for him to step back into the world of life.

When he looked up, Chase was standing there as well. Chase made the largest among the Mud People look the size of children. \"Chase, what are you doing here?\" He folded his arms, looking unhappy. \"It's too incredible. You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" Richard gave him a look. \"I just came back from the underworld. I think I have you beat for incredible.\" Chase thought it over. \"Maybe. I was at camp. I'd been searching for Rachel. My mother visited me.\" \"Your mother? Your mother passed away years ago.\" Chase made a face as if to say he knew that better than Richard. \"That kind of thing gets your attention.\" \"Well,\" Richard said, trying to grasp what was going on, \"it obviously wasn't your mother. Didn't you think to ask who she really was?\" Chase, his arms still folded, shrugged. \"No.\" He glanced off into the darkness. \"It was a rather emotional experience. You would have had to have been there.\" \"I imagine you're right,\" Richard said. \"Did she tell you why she had come to visit you?\" \"She told me that I had to come here as fast as I could. She said that Rachel would be here, and that you needed help.\" Richard was dumbfounded. \"Did she tell you what sort of help I file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (729 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 needed?\" Chase nodded. \"Horses.

My mother who gave birth to me.\" Richard didn't quite know what to say. \"What did she want with you?\" \"She told me that I had to help you by coming here. She said that I needed to tell these people that you were in the spirit world and they had to have a gathering so that you would have a way to get back.\" \"Really\" was all Richard could think to say. Rachel nodded. \"She said I had to hurry, that there was little time, so she had a gar fly me here. His name was Gratch. He was real nice. Gratch told me that he loves you. But he had to go home after we came here.\" Richard could only stare. \"That was a few days back,\" Chase said. \"We've been waiting for you. The Mud People had to prepare for the gathering.

The book that Baraccus had written for Richard and then hidden for him three thousand years before was in Tamarang. Richard had found the book but then been captured by Six. The book, Secrets of a War Wizard's Power, was hidden in a stone cell in Tamarang. He needed that book now more than ever. Baraccus had already provided invaluable help. If Richard was to open the boxes of Orden, though, that book might well provide the things he needed. \"Tamarang,\" Richard said again in thought. \"There was a spell there that cut me off from my gift.\" Rachel nodded. \"I fixed it.\" Richard stared down at her. \"You fixed it?\" Chase gave Richard a look. \"Like I said, there are some things we need to talk about, but now is not the time. As I hear it told, you're in a big hurry. You only have until the new moon.\" With a feeling of sinking dread, Richard glanced at the sliver of a moon. \"I can't get back to the People's Palace by the new moon.

He heard someone calling his name again. The voice sounded like it was drifting into him from some distant world. He didn't want to answer the call, didn't want to open his eyes, didn't want to be fully conscious and have to feel the full brunt of awareness. \"Zedd,\" the voice called again. A big hand shook him, gently rocking his body back and forth. Zedd forced his eyes open just a little, squinting with the full dread of consciousness. Rikka and Tom, hunched over him, were both looking down with intent worry. Zedd saw that the side of Tom's blond hair was matted with blood. \"Zedd, are you all right?\" It was Rikka's voice, he realized. He blinked, trying to tell if every bone in his body was broken or if it only felt that way. Fear lurking in the shadows of his mind whispered that this might be the end of everything. His middle hurt. That was where Six's spell had caught him. He felt like a fool. Having taken the measure of her before, he had been prepared. He had been sure that he could counter the woman's ability- and he would have been able to, except that she had caught him off guard with a form of constructed spell, a little surprise that she'd had drawn in the caves, patiently waiting for his arrival should he ever enter her domain.

He should have been ready for a trick. She was a witch woman, not a sorceress or wizard, and she knew that, while she had considerable talents of her own, she was vulnerable to certain things Zedd could do. He had revealed some of those things back at the Wizard's Keep by preventing her from killing him and the others when she tried. She had learned from that experience and found a way to construct a counter-something that was simply out of character for a witch woman. It was quite brilliant, actually, but right then he wasn't exactly in the mood to marvel at her accomplishment. \"Zedd,\" Rikka said, \"are you all right?\" \"I think so,\" he managed. \"You?\" Rikka grunted with a note of displeasure. \"They were certainly ready for us. Whatever she did kept me from being able to stop her.\" \"Well, don't feel bad, she did the same to me.\" \"With you unconscious all those soldiers were more than I could handle,\" Tom added. \"Sorry, Zedd, but I let you down when you needed me the most. I should have been the steel against steel for you.\" Zedd squinted up at the man. \"Don't be silly. Steel has its limits. It was I who shouldn't have allowed us to be taken in such a way.

The hallway outside is filled with guards.\" It wasn't especially large. A lantern burned on a small table. There was a single chair. Other than that the room was barren. \"The ceiling is beams and planks,\" Zedd observed. \"I wonder if I could breach them with my power, enough for us to sneak out of here.\" With their help he staggered to his feet. Rikka steadied him as he lifted an arm to use his gift to probe the ceiling. \"Bags,\" he muttered. \"When she used that constructed spell she also put some kind of barrier around this room. It keeps me from breaching it with my gift. We're sealed in.\" \"Something else,\" Tom said. \"The guards are mostly Imperial Order soldiers.

Zedd squinted as he looked up at the ceiling. He pointed. \"What's that?\" \"What?\" Tom said, looking up. \"That there. At the edge of the ceiling, up against the wall. There is something wedged between that last beam and the top of the wall.\" Tom pulled the chair over and used it to reach the dark bundle hidden in the shadow of the beam. He tugged on it until it suddenly fell to the floor. Some of the things inside tumbled out. \"Dear spirits,\" Zedd said, \"that's Richard's pack.\" He recognized some of the things that had fallen out. He bent to right the pack, inspecting the clothes briefly before stuffing them back inside the pack. When he lifted the black shirt trimmed in gold and returned it to the pack, he spotted a book lying on the floor. He picked it up, squinting in the dim light of the lantern. \"What sort of book is it?\" Rikka asked. Tom leaned closer to see. \"What does it say?\" Zedd could hardly believe what he was seeing. \"The title says Secrets of a War Wizard's Power.\" Rikka let out a low whistle. \"My sentiment as well,\" Zedd muttered as he inspected the front file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (735 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 and back covers. \"Where in the world would Richard have gotten such a thing?

He blinked in surprise. \"Dear spirits . . .\" he murmured in astonishment. Nicci looked up when she saw a shadow fill the doorway. It was Cara. \"How are you doing?\" the Mord-Sith asked in a quiet voice that seemed to get lost in the somber room. Nicci's gaze wandered off to stare into space. She couldn't really see the relevance of the question. She supposed that Cara was just trying to find something to say, something that reflected her genuine concern. It struck Nicci as tragic that a Mord-Sith would come to finally possess such simple, decent qualities when it was too late to matter. \"I don't know anymore, Cara.\" \"Have you figured out what went wrong?\" Nicci looked up from the padded leather chair she was in. \"What went wrong? Isn't it pretty obvious?\" Cara stepped closer and idly stroked a finger along the other side of the mahogany table. In the dimly lit library her red leather stood out like a splash of blood. \"But Lord Rahl will find a way back.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (736 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 It sounded to Nicci like a plea rather than a statement. \"Cara, if Richard was coming back he would have been back ten days ago,\" Nicci said in a dejected voice, unable to summon a lie.

She shook her head. \"He should have been back by the next morning. Since he never returned that means he didn't survive what he-\" \"But he has to come back!\" Cara shouted as she leaned over the table, unwilling to allow Nicci to finish such a thought. Nicci watched the anxiety on Cara's face for a moment. What was there to say? How could she explain such a thing to a person who didn't really understand the things that were involved? \"Believe me, Cara,\" Nicci said at last. \"I want him to return just as much as you do, but if he was able to survive the spell and the journey to the underworld, he would have been back long ago. He couldn't stay there this long.\" \"Why not?\" \"You might say that it's a little like diving to the bottom of a lake. You can hold your breath for a time, but you need to come back out of the water within a certain amount of time. If you get your foot caught under a log at the bottom of the water, you will drown.

The underworld is just emptiness.\" She knew she was getting tangled up trying to make it understandable to Cara. Nicci didn't even fully grasp the nature of the underworld herself. \"Let's just say that if he tried to come up somewhere else under the ice of the frozen lake, he couldn't break through. He needs to come back through that hole he cut, the hole he created into the underworld, through the gateway. Does that make any sense?\" \"In a way, but it should have worked.\" She gestured to all the books lying open all over the table. \"The two of you had it all figured out. Darken Rahl did it.

I'm no expert on such things.\" \"Neither is Richard. In the underworld it would be different than here. In the past he used his sword or the shields to stop it. When the beast appeared the last time, he was able to shoot it with one of those special arrows. What was he going to do to fight it in the underworld? He had to go naked. He had no weapons, no way to fight it.\" Cara's expression tipped toward enraged. \"Then why would you allow him to go?\" \"He had already gone into the underworld when I saw the beast. It went down after him. There was simply no way to stop the beast or even to warn Richard.\" \"There had to be some way you could have stopped him.\" Nicci stood. \"Going to the underworld is something he had to do if he was to have had a chance to use the power of Orden. Without going he can't counter Chainfire and if he can't counter Chainfire we're all lost. Besides, I couldn't have stopped him if I wanted to.\" Cara paced before the table. \"But it's going to be the new moon in a few days. We're running out of time.

Still, she felt like she needed to do something or she would go mad, and it would at least make Cara feel better until the end came. Besides, what else was there to do, now. \"Good idea,\" Cara said. \"Do some calling spells until you pull Lord Rahl back.\" Out in the hallway, Nicci saw that in both directions it was blocked off by men of the First File. They each had a crossbow armed with a red-fletched bolt. It looked like the men were deliberately sealing off the library area. Nicci saw the top of Nathan's head of white hair as he made his way through the dense wall of men. The prophet finally stepped through all the soldiers. Spotting Nicci, he immediately headed toward her. His face looked more than grim. Just seeing the look on his face made Nicci's mouth go dry. \"Nathan, what is it?\" she asked as he came to an abrupt halt before her. His azure eyes looked tired. \"I'm sorry, Nicci, but this is the only way.\" Nicci blinked in confusion. She glanced briefly to the soldiers standing shoulder-to-shoulder across the hallway.

The thing is, I've studied the methods Richard used.\" Cara appeared hopeful that the prophet could offer an answer that Nicci couldn't provide. \"Good. Have you figured out a way to get him back from the underworld? Nicci's going to cast calling webs. Maybe you could help her. The two of you together ...\" Her voice trailed off.

She took a careful peek through the narrow slits of her eyelids. The overcast was just blushing with a hint of the approaching dawn. While she hadn't known why she'd awakened so abruptly, she soon realized the reason. Out of the corner of her eye she could see that Samuel was right above her-hovering over her. He was still and silent, mere inches away, like a mountain lion poised over prey. He was completely naked. Kahlan was so startled that for an instant she lay frozen in confusion, wondering if she really was awake or if she was having some kind of bizarre nightmare. Her disorientation evaporated in urgent alarm as her instincts took charge. Without letting on that she was awake, she inched her hand downward toward her belt to get at her knife. Since she was turned to the right the sheath for her knife was somewhat under her. She had to squirm her fingers under her to get at the knife, trying not to betray the fact that she was awake. She counted on her blanket to help hide the movement of her hand. The knife wasn't there. She glanced down a little, hoping it had fallen out somehow and that it would be on the ground nearby. It wasn't. As she was feeling around under the blanket, trying to find her knife, she saw the pile of Samuel's clothes not far away. Then she saw the knife. It had been tossed beyond his clothes, well out of reach.

She was appalled by the thought that he had been so close to her, watching her, taking her knife, preparing for the obscene things he wanted to do to her, and that she hadn't even been aware of it. Besides being appalled, she was angry at herself for letting him get this far. While Samuel had always seemed timid and shy, and sometimes eager to curry favor, this didn't entirely surprise her. She remembered all too well the times she'd caught him staring at her. Those looks had always seemed to contain a sneaky craving that he never otherwise betrayed. She controlled her outrage, focusing instead on survival. Being hesitant and indecisive, Samuel was moving ever so slowly, inching into position, skulking in close rather than boldly pouncing. He apparently wanted to get completely over her, and then when he felt he was close enough to be sure that she couldn't get away, he would muscle her under control and then live out the dark thoughts that had always been hidden behind his golden- yellow eyes. Samuel wasn't a big man, but he was muscular. He was certainly stronger than she was. There was no way she could escape without a fight, and she was in a poor position to grapple with him. From this close she couldn't even punch effectively. In this close, without a knife, without anyone to help her, she had little hope of fending him off.

Her only edge at that moment was that he hadn't acted swiftly and he didn't know she was awake. She didn't want to squander that advantage. When she acted, that surprise would help even the equation and give her an opportunity she would not get again. Her mind raced through a list of options. She Would have only one chance to strike first. She would have to make it count. Her first thought was to bring her knee up where it would hurt him most, but the way she was lying, turned to her right, her legs trapped under a blanket, and with the way he was positioned over her pinning that blanket down, she deemed it a poor choice for a first strike. Her left hand was free, though, just outside the blanket. That seemed her best choice. Without further delay, before it was too late, she struck hard and fast, as quick as a viper, trying to gouge out his eye with her thumb. She pressed with all her strength into the soft tissue of his eye. He cried out in fright, immediately jerking his face back and away.

She was no match for his strength and weight, especially not in the vulnerable position she was in. She had no leverage to push him away and no effective way to strike. Kahlan twisted her head more to the right to get her windpipe out from the direct weight his forearm was putting across her throat. Her straining neck muscles at least took the full load off her throat long enough for her to get a breath. As she gasped in that needed breath, her sight was focused on his clothes lying not far away. She spotted the hilt of the sword just sticking out from under his trousers. She could see the early- morning light glinting off the gold word truth on the silver wire of the hilt. Kahlan desperately grasped for the hilt of the sword. It was just beyond the reach of her fingers. She knew that, since she was on the ground and didn't have full use of her arm, even if she could get ahold of it she had no chance to draw the blade from its scabbard in order to stab Samuel or even slash at him. Her aim was simply to get her hand around the hilt and then bash the point of the pommel into his face or skull. A sword was heavy enough to do substantial damage in that manner. A good hit in the right place, such as his temple, could even kill her attacker. But the hilt of the sword was just out of reach. At the same time she was desperately stretching, trying to reach the sword, Samuel was having difficulty having his way with her. The blanket was interfering with his lust to get at her.

As if reading her mind, she saw his right arm cock back. She could see his big fist tighten.

Her fingers found the gold wire spelling out truth on the hilt of the sword. The world seemed to come to an abrupt halt. In an instant, she was flooded with understanding. Things within her that had been entirely lost were suddenly right there. She didn't remember who she was, but she instantly remembered what she was. A Confessor. It was far from a complete joining with her past, but in that thread of linkage she knew what being a Confessor meant. It had been a complete mystery for so long, but now she not only remembered all that it meant, she felt that birthright within her, felt its bond to her. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (747 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She still didn't know who she was, who Kahlan Amnell was, and she didn't remember anything of her past, but she remembered what it meant to be a Confessor.

She no longer struggled. She felt as if she were as light as a breath of air and that he no longer had any power over her. There was no longer any frantic rush, any sense of desperation. Time was hers. She didn't need to consider, evaluate, or decide. She knew with complete certainty what to do. She didn't even have to think it through. It was not necessary for Kahlan to invoke her birthright, but merely to withdraw her restraint of it. She could see his furious, focused expression frozen above her. His fist remained poised unmoving in an ever-expanding spark of time, as it would until this was finished. She had no need to hope, or expect, or act. She knew that time was hers.

In the twist of that instant, his mind, who he was, who he had been, was already gone. Trees all around in the frigid early-morning air shook from the violent blow of the concussion. Small twigs and dry bark dropped from branches and boughs. The profound shock to the air lifted a ring of dust and dirt all around that raced away in an ever- expanding circle. Samuel's strange eyes went wide. \"Mistress,\" he whispered, \"command me.\" \"Get off me.\" He immediately rolled away to end up on his knees, his hands pressed together in supplication as his gaze remained fixed on her. As Kahlan sat up, she realized that the sword was still gripped in her right hand. She let go of it. She needed no sword to deal with Samuel. Deeply distressed as he waited, Samuel looked on the verge of tears. \"Please . . . how may I serve you?\" Kahlan tossed the blanket aside. \"Who am I?\" \"Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor,\" he answered immediately.

Their only concern was their constant, torturous dread that they might not please the woman who had touched them with her power. Their mind's only remaining purpose was to do her bidding. \"Have you murdered other people?\" Samuel looked up sharply with the sudden joy of having a question he could fully answer. His face beamed with a smile. \"Oh, yes, Mistress. Many. Please, may I kill someone for you? Anyone. Just name them. Just tell me who I am to kill. I will do it as quickly as possible.

She blinked, her thoughts suddenly scattered in every direction at once. \"What?\" \"Richard Rahl is your husband.\" She stood staring for a long moment, unable to reconcile it all in her mind. In one way it was a stunning shock. At the same time, it made sense in a way she couldn't begin to fathom. Kahlan stood struck speechless. Finding that she was married to Richard Rahl was a terrifying revelation. In another way ... it made her heart swell with profound joy. She thought of his gray eyes, thought of the way he looked at her, and the frightening aspect of it seemed to evaporate. It was if all the dreams she had not dared to dream had just come true. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. With her fingers she wiped it away, but it was quickly followed by another.

She had only just learned her connection to him, and now he was lost to her. She felt a tear roll down her cheek, but this time there was no joy behind it, only horror. She finally collected herself and focused her attention on the man on his knees before her. \"Where were you taking me?\" \"To Tamarang. To my .. . my other mistress.\" \"Other mistress?\" He nodded hurriedly. \"Six.\" She recalled Jagang talking about her. Kahlan frowned. \"The witch woman?\" Samuel looked terrified to answer, but he did. \"Yes, Mistress.

She knew without doubt that she had to get out of the area or she might be located without the benefit of Samuel dragging her right up to Six's feet. \"And since you were to turn me over tomorrow, you knew that your time with me was running out.

Without delay, Kahlan began gathering up her things. With the witch woman this close she had to get away as fast as possible. She didn't know where she would go, but she knew where she couldn't go. She suddenly realized that she should have thought more about it and asked Samuel a great many more questions. She had let those many answers slip through her fingers. The news about Richard-about Richard being her husband-had so scrambled her thoughts that she simply hadn't considered asking Samuel anything else. She suddenly felt like a monumental fool for missing such an invaluable opportunity. Done was done. She had to concentrate on what to do now.

CHAPTER 57 In crushing loneliness, Kahlan plodded northeast. She began to wonder why she bothered. What was the point of fighting for her life if there could be no future? What could there be to a life without her own mind in a world dominated by the fanatical beliefs of the Imperial Order, by people who defined their existence through a filter of hatred for those who wanted to live and accomplish for themselves? They didn't want to accomplish anything; they simply wanted to murder anyone else who did, as if by destroying productive accomplishment they could revoke reality and live a life made of wishes. All those who denned their existence by that burning hatred of others were smothering all joy out of life, and in the process suffocating life itself out of existence. It would be easy to simply give up. No one would care. No one would know. But she would care. She would know. Reality was what it was. It was the only life she would ever have. In the end, that precious life was all she had, all anyone had. It had been up to Samuel to decide how he would live his life, and he had made his choices. It was no less true for her. She had to make the most of what she had in life, even if her choices were limited, and even if that life itself was to be cut short. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (757 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She had walked for less than an hour when she began to hear the distant ramble of galloping hooves. She paused as she saw horses break from a line of trees ahead. They were coming right toward her. She glanced around the bottomland she was crossing. In the gloomy light of a leaden sky she could see that the trees covering the foothills to each side were too far for her to reach their cover in time. The grass, long since brown as winter closed in, had been flattened by wind and weather. It didn't provide anywhere for her to hide. Besides, it looked like she might have been spotted. Even if she hadn't, at the speed the horses were closing they soon would catch up to her, and she had no hope of running across their line of sight and not being seen. She tossed the saddlebag on the ground. The gentle breeze lifted her hair back off her shoulders as she gripped the scabbard of the sword in her left hand. Her only choice was to stand and fight. She realized, then, that she was invisible to most everyone. She almost laughed aloud with relief. This was one of those rare times when she was thankful to be invisible. She stood her ground, remaining quiet, hoping the riders wouldn't see her and would simply ride by and be gone.

She recalled thinking at the time that it reminded her somewhat of the way in which she fought with a blade. She wondered if it had been Richard-her husband- who had taught her to use a sword the way she did. She noticed then that while there were three horses, only one had a rider. That was good news. It cut the odds to even. As the galloping horses bore down on her, she was astonished to recognize the rider. \"Richard!\" He leaped off the horse before it had skidded to a halt.

She remembered the way the blade had seemed to be a part of him, almost an extension of his body, an extension of his mind. She had been spellbound that day as she'd watched him fighting his way toward her. It had been like watching a dance with death, and death had not been able to touch him.

The nearly new moon would have come up at sunset but the narrow crescent didn't provide enough illumination to brighten the inky cloud cover in the least. Even the light that would have been provided by meager starlight was hidden by the thick clouds. The darkness was so complete that it was simply impossible to go on. Kahlan was tired, but as Richard started a fire in the fluff of cattails he'd broken open for tinder, she could see that he was in far worse condition. She wondered if he'd slept in recent days.

He had his wife, Magda Searus, who he loved very much, take that book away and hide it for me. He was very careful to make sure that no one but me would get ahold of the book. \"While Magda Searus was on that journey to hide Secrets of a War Wizard's Power, Baraccus killed himself.\" Kahlan was astonished to hear this news. \"But why would he do such a thing? If he loved Magda Searus, why would he do that and leave her all alone?\" Richard looked over in the flickering firelight. \"I think that he had just seen so much pain and suffering in the war, as well as treason and betrayal, to say nothing of the experience of traveling through the underworld, that he just couldn't stand it any longer.\" His eyes looked haunted. \"I've been through the veil. I can understand what he did.\" Kahlan rested her chin on her knees. \"After spending time in the Order's camp, I guess I know how disheartened a person can get about everything.\" She looked over at him. \"So, you need this book to help stop the Imperial Order?\" \"I do.

Now she could see why it was so important. She stared into the flames, thinking about Baraccus. \"Do you know what ever happened to Magda Searus?\" Richard used a stick to drag a wrapped fish out of the fire. He opened it and tested it with his knife. When he saw that it was flaky and done, he set it beside her. \"Careful, it's hot.\" He dragged out the other baking bundle. \"Well, Magda Searus was heartbroken. After the war they needed to get the truth out of Lothain, the traitor who had betrayed them. A wizard at the time, Merritt, came up with a way to do that.\" Richard stared into the flames for a moment before he went on. \"He created a Confessor to get the truth.\" Kahlan paused at nibbling at the fish. \"Really? That was where the Confessors came from?\" When he nodded, she asked, \"Do you know who she was?\" \"Magda Searus. She was so heartbroken about her husband being dead that she volunteered for the experiment. It was extremely dangerous, but it worked. The Confessors were created. She was the first. Eventually she fell in love with Merritt and they married.\" Being a Confessor was the only part of her past to which Kahlan felt connected. Now she knew where Confessors had come from. They had come from a woman who had lost the man she loved. Richard picked up a fat piece of wood and was about to toss it into the fire, but instead he paused and held it in a hand, turning it around, staring at it. He finally set it aside and tossed a different file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (768 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 piece in the fire. \"You'd better get some sleep,\" he said when they'd finished. \"I want to be out of here as soon as it's light enough to see.\" Kahlan could tell that he was more exhausted than she was, but she could also tell that something was deeply troubling him, so she didn't argue. She wrapped herself in her blanket close enough to the fire to stay warm. As she glanced up at Richard, she saw him still sitting before the fire, staring at the piece of firewood he'd set beside before. She had thought that he would be more interested in looking at his sword now that he finally had it back. Kahlan woke softly. It was a good feeling not to wake the way she had the day before with Samuel on top of her. She rubbed her eyes and saw that Richard was still sitting before the fire. He looked terrible. She couldn't imagine what must be going through his head with the responsibilities on his shoulders, with all the people depending on him. \"I have something I'd like to give you,\" he said in a quiet voice that felt so soothing to hear when she first woke. Kahlan sat up, stretching for a moment. She saw that there was just a hint of light in the sky. They would need to be on their way soon. \"What is it?\" she asked as she folded her blanket and set it aside. \"You don't have to take it, but it would mean a great deal to me if you would.\" He finally looked away from the flames and into her eyes. \"I know that you don't know what's going on, or even who you are, much file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (769 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 less what you're doing here with me.

I'm asking you to trust me.\" She looked away from his eyes. She couldn't bear to look into those eyes of his. \"In the meantime, I'd like you to have something.\" Kahlan swallowed. \"What is it?\" Richard reached around on the other side of him and pulled something out. He held it out to her in the dim firelight. It was the statue she had before, the statue she had left in the Garden of Life when she had taken the boxes for the Sisters. It was a carving of a woman with her back arched, her head thrown back, and her hands fisted at her sides. It was the embodiment of the spirit of defiance against forces that would subdue her. It was a carving of nobility and strength. It was the statue she had before. It had been the most precious thing she had, and she'd had to leave it behind. This was not the same one, yet it was. She remembered every curve and turn of that one. This one was the same, but a little smaller. She saw then the wood shavings all over the ground. He had spent the night carving it for her. \"It's called Spirit,\" he said in a voice that broke with emotion. \"Would you accept it from me?\" Kahlan reverently lifted it from his hands and clutched it to her heart as she broke down in tears. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (770 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 CHAPTER 58 Before we start a war,\" Richard said in a near whisper, \"I need to get into the place where I hid the book.

It just feels like a trap. Once we get in there we're liable to be snared. We may have to fight a war to get out.\" \"If we have to, we will.\" Kahlan remembered the way Richard fought with a sword-or with a broc, for that matter. But this was different. \"And if we get caught in here do you think that sword of yours is going to be any good against a witch woman who could be lurking anywhere?\" He looked away from her eyes to check the hallway again. \"The world is about to end for a great many good people who love life and just want to live it. That includes you, and me. I don't have any choice. I have to get that book.\" He leaned out to check the other direction down the dimly lit hallway. Kahlan could hear the approaching echo of boots as soldiers patrolled. So far they had been able to evade a number of them. Richard was very good at moving in dark passages and hiding in plain sight.

Kahlan, holding her breath, could hardly believe that they hadn't been spotted. She kept a tight grip on the handle of her knife. As soon as the guards turned the far corner Richard grabbed her hand and pulled her after him into the hallway. Down another dark corridor he came to an abrupt halt before a heavy door. The hasp had a lock in it. Richard, his sword already in his hand, slipped the blade through the bar. Pressing his lips tight, he strained to twist the sword. With a muffled metallic pop the lock broke. Pieces of steel bounced across the stone floor. Kahlan winced at the sound, sure that it would bring guards running. They heard nothing. Richard slipped in through the doorway. \"Zedd!\" she heard him call in a loud whisper. Kahlan stuck her head into the room. There were three people inside the small stone cell: an old man with disheveled white hair, a big blond-headed man, and a woman with her blond hair in the single braid of a Mord-Sith. \"Richard!\" the old man shouted. \"Dear spirits-you're alive!\" Richard crossed his lips with a finger as he pulled Kahlan in behind him. He quietly shut the door. The three people looked tired and bedraggled. It looked to have been a harsh confinement. \"Keep your voice down,\" Richard whispered. \"There are guards all over this place.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (772 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"How in the world did you know we were here?\" the old man asked. \"I didn't,\" Richard said. \"Well, I can tell you, my boy, that we have a great many things to-\" \"Zedd, be quiet and listen to me.\" The old man's mouth snapped shut. Then he pointed. \"How did you get your sword back?\" \"Kahlan gave it back to me.\" Zedd's bushy brow drew down. \"You saw her?\" Richard nodded. He held out his sword. \"Put your hand around the hilt.\" Zedd's frown grew. \"Why? Richard, there are a great many more important-\" \"Do it!\" Richard growled. Zedd blinked at the command. He straightened and he did as Richard had told him to do. Zedd's gaze shot to Kahlan. A light seemed to come on in his hazel eyes as they went wide. \"Dear spirits . . . Kahlan.\" As Zedd stood frozen in shock, Richard held the sword out to the woman. She touched the handle. Recognition dawned in her eyes as she stared at Kahlan, who had just suddenly seemed to magically appear before her. The big man, when he touched the hilt, was no less astonished. \"I know you,\" Zedd said to her. \"I can see you.\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (773 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Do you remember me?\" Kahlan asked.

I recognize who you are. I don't recall you, but I know you. It's rather like seeing a face you know but not being able to place it.\" \"Same with me,\" the big man said. The woman nodded her agreement. Zedd grabbed Richard's sleeve. \"We have to get out of here. Six will be back. We dare not get caught here and have to tangle with her. She's more than a handful.\" Richard started across the room. \"I have to get something first.\" \"The book?\" Zedd asked. Richard stopped and turned back. \"You saw it?\" \"I should say I did. Where in the world did you ever come across such a thing?\" Richard climbed up on the chair and pulled down a pack stuffed up behind a beam. \"First Wizard Baraccus-\" \"From the great war? That Baraccus?\" \"That's right.\" Richard hopped down from the chair. \"He wrote the book and then had it hidden for me to find. He is responsible for me being born with both sides of the gift, so he wanted to help me with my abilities. He had his wife, Magda Searus, hide it after he came back from the Temple of the Winds.

They gathered around the table as Richard dug around in the pack until he found the book and pulled it out. He held up the book for Zedd to see. \"The problem was, at the time I was cut off from my gift, so I couldn't read it. It just looked like blank pages. I don't know what Baraccus wanted to tell me about my ability.\" Zedd shared a look with the other two captives. \"Richard, I need to talk to you about what Baraccus left for you.\" \"Yes, in a moment.\" A frown grew on Richard's face as he thumbed through the book. \"It's still blank.\" He looked up in confusion. \"Zedd, it's still blank. The block on my gift was broken-I know it was. Why would this still appear blank to me?\" Zedd laid a hand on Richard's shoulder. \"Because it is blank.\" \"To me. But you can read it.\" He held the book open before the old man. \"What does it say?\" \"It's blank,\" Zedd repeated. \"There is no writing at all in the book- only the title on the cover.\" Richard puzzled at the old man. \"What do you mean it's blank? It can't be blank. It's supposed to be the Secrets of a War Wizard's Power!\" \"It is,\" Zedd said in a grave tone.

What is the rule!\" Zedd shrugged. \"I don't know. It's never been spoken, and has never been written. \"But Baraccus wanted you to know that it's the secret to using a war wizard's power. The only way to express it, to make sure that you would grasp what he was intending to tell you, was to give you a book unwritten to signify the rule unwritten.\" \"How am I supposed to use it if I don't know what it is?\" \"That's a question for yourself, Richard. If you are the one Baraccus thought you were, then you will know how to use what he left for you. He obviously thought it was exceptionally important and worth all the trouble he went to, so I would say that it must be what you need.\" Richard took a deep breath to steady himself. Kahlan felt so sorry for him. He looked at his wits' end. He looked on the verge of tears. \"My, my, my,\" came a voice from behind. They all spun around. A reed-thin woman in black smiled a sly smile. Her hair was a tangled nest of black. Her bloodless flesh and blanched eyes made her look ca-daverous. \"Six . . .\" Zedd said. \"What do you know, if it isn't the Mother Confessor.

He stag-gered back and crumpled to the ground. Richard's sword made a ringing sound as he drew it. He charged the woman but was stopped short and driven back by forces Kahlan couldn't see. His sword clattered across the stone floor. The woman held out a thin finger toward Kahlan. \"Not a good idea, Mother Confessor. Not that I care if you fry your own brain trying to turn mine to mush, but you are much more valuable to me alive.\" Kahlan felt the pain of the unseen power forcing her back, just as Richard had been forced back. The debilitating agony was something like the pain from the collar, but sharper, deeper down in her ears. It made the back of her jaw hurt so much that she had to open her mouth. All five of them were cringing back, holding their ears with the pain of it. \"This is going to make things so much easier,\" Six said in a self- satisfied manner as she glided toward them, like death itself. \"Six,\" a stern voice called from the doorway. Six spun to a voice she obviously recognized. The pain lifted from Kahlan's head. She saw the others recovering as well. \"Mother . . . ?\" Six said in emotional confusion. \"You have disappointed me, Six,\" the old woman said as she stepped forward into the room. \"Disappointed me greatly.\" She was slender, much like Six, but stooped with age.

Her eyes, too, were a blanched blue. Six backed up a couple of steps. \"But I, I. . .\" \"You what?\" the old woman demanded in a venomous tone of displea-sure. This woman was a commanding presence who feared nothing, least of all Six. Six cowered back a step. \"I don't understand . . .\" Kahlan's jaw dropped as she saw the tight, pale flesh of Six's face and hands begin to move, as if bubbling from beneath. Six started screaming in pain, her bony hands groping the crawling flesh of her face. \"Mother, what do you want!\" \"It's quite simple,\" the old woman said, stepping closer yet to the witch woman as she shrank away. \"I want you to die.\" At that, Six's whole body jerked about violently as her skin convulsed and churned, looking like it was separating from the turbulent muscle and sinew beneath. She almost looked like she was boiling from within. The old woman grabbed the suddenly slack skin at the back of Six's neck. As Six began to crumple downward the old woman gave a mighty pull. The skin, mostly in one piece, pulled right off the stricken witch woman. She collapsed, a bloody, unrecognizable mess barely contained by the sack of a black dress, to the stone floor. It was about as sickening a sight as Kahlan could imagine. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (778 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 The old woman, holding the sagging remains of Six's skin, smiled at them.

Points of the airy fabric floated as if in a gentle breeze. \"Shota . . .\" Richard said, a grin splitting his face. She dropped the bloody hide in a sloppy pile, then smiled a coy, teasing smile as she stepped forward and tenderly cupped his cheek with her other hand. Kahlan could feel her own face going red. \"Shota, what are you doing here?\" Richard asked. \"Saving your hide, obviously.\" She smiled even wider as she glanced down to the remains in the black dress. \"I guess it cost Six hers.\" \"But, but I don't understand.\" \"Neither did Six,\" Shota said. \"She expected me to scurry away with my tail between my legs to forever hide in trembling fear that she might find me, so she never expected a visit from her mother.

When he emerged, Kahlan's breath was taken by what she saw. Over a black shirt he wore a black, open-sided tunic decorated with strange symbols snaking along a wide gold band running all the way around its squared edges. A wide, multilayered leather belt bearing more of the emblems cinched the magnificent tunic at his waist. The ancient, tooled-leather baldric holding the gold- and silver-wrought scabbard for the Sword of Truth crossed over his right shoulder. At each wrist was a wide, leather-padded silver band bearing linked rings encompassing more of the strange symbols. Black boots over his black trousers also had pins with yet more of the rounded designs. His broad shoulders bore a cape that appeared to be made of spun gold. He looked like Kahlan's idea of what a war wizard should look like. He looked like a commander of kings. He looked like Lord Rahl. Kahlan had no trouble at all understanding why Nicci was in love with him. She was just about the luckiest woman in the world. She was also a woman worthy of this man. \"Let's hurry,\" he said to Shota.

They all paused behind the witch woman when she finally stopped at a heavy oak door. She gave them all a look as if to ask if they were ready, then threw open the heavy oak door. When they went through the doorway into the overcast day, Richard's cape billowed out behind. Out on the rampart they were confronted by a huge beast with glossy red scales and a forest of black-tipped spikes on its back. Flame roared across the rampart, kicking dirt and gravel in every direction. They all shrank back. \"That's not Scarlet,\" Richard said. \"I thought it might be Scarlet.\" \"You know a dragon?\" Kahlan asked. \"Yes, so do you, but not this one. This one is bigger, and a whole lot meaner-looking.'' The heat from rolling flames again drove them back. Shota, unconcerned, singing a soft song, casually walked forward. The flames stopped. The dragon brought its head floating downward toward her, tilting it to the side, as if curious. As Shota whispered things Kahlan couldn't hear, the dragon snorted softly in a contented manner. Shota, stroking her fingers under the dragon's chin, turned back to them. \"Richard, come speak with this handsome fellow.\" The dragon almost sounded like it was purring at her words.

The lips drew back in a snarl to reveal wicked-looking fangs. \"Scarlet is my mother,\" the dragon growled. Richard looked pleasantly surprised. \"Scarlet is your mother? Are you Gregory?\" The dragon drew closer yet, sniffing at Richard as it frowned. Richard's cape billowed up with each puff of air. \"Who are you, little man?\" \"I'm Richard Rahl. The last time I saw you, you were an egg.\" Richard, as if talking to an old friend, made a half circle with his arms. \"You were this big.\" \"Richard Rahl.\" Gregory grinned, its hostility evaporating. \"My mother has told me of you.\" Richard laid a hand on Gregory's snout. His voice turned gentle with concern. \"Is she all right? Magic is failing. I've been worried how it might harm her.\" Gregory snorted a puff of smoke. \"She is very sick.

I do know that I need to get to the People's Palace if I am to try.\" \"The People's Palace? Where the dark army waits?\" Richard nodded. \"That's right. I may be the only one who can stop that taint. Will you take us there?\" \"I am free, now. A free dragon does not serve man.\" \"I'm not asking you to be my servant, only to fly us to D'Hara so that I can try to save all of us who want to live free, including you and your mother.\" Gregory's head glided closer to Zedd, Tom, and Rikka. He thought it over briefly, looking back at Richard. \"All of you?\" \"All of us,\" Richard said. \"I need the help of my friends, here. It's our only chance to stop all the terrible things that are about to happen.\" Gregory's head came down close until his snout nudged Richard's chest, pushing him back a half step. \"My mother told me the story of how you saved me when I was but an egg.

He went up first, settling himself astride the dragon's back at the base of its long neck, then helped pull Zedd, Tom, and Rikka up behind him. Zedd muttered under his breath the whole time. Richard told him to stop cursing. Kahlan was last. Richard leaned down, took her hand, and pulled her up behind him. As she adjusted herself on the dragon's back behind him, she saw him pull a white cloth out of his pocket, looking at it. Kahlan, her arms around him, whispered in his ear. \"I'm afraid.\" He smiled over his shoulder. \"You get dizzy flying on dragons, but you don't get sick. Just hold on tight and close your eyes if you want.\" It struck her how easy it was being close to him, and how gentle and natural he was with her. He seemed to come alive when she was near him. \"What's that you have?\" she asked, tilting her head toward the white cloth. It had an ink spot on one side and another just like it on the opposite side. \"Something from before,\" he said in a distracted sort of way. He was obviously not thinking about her question. He was thinking about the white cloth with the two ink spots. He stuffed the cloth back in his pocket and looked down at the rampart. \"Shota, are you coming?\" file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (786 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"No. I'm returning to Agaden Reach, to my home.

Richard patted the dragon's glossy red scales. \"Gregory, let's get going. We don't have much time.\" Gregory let out a brief blast of flame. As it curled away into black smoke, the dragon's immense wings lifted and then snapped down with tremendous yet graceful force. Kahlan felt them lift into the air. It felt like her stomach turned upside down. CHAPTER 59 As they marched through the empty, magnificent marble halls of the People's Palace, Richard knew where everyone had gone because he could hear the soft chanting echoing through the passageways. \"Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us. In your light we thrive. In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve.

In your mercy we are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve. Our lives are yours.\" Richard put his feelings about the devotion out of his mind. He felt like he was juggling a thousand thoughts all at once. He didn't know what to do. There were so many different questions overwhelming him all at once that he just couldn't seem to organize the mountain of problems into meaningful order. He didn't know where to start that arduous climb. He felt inadequate to be the Master Rahl. He did believe, though, that the seemingly endless problems were connected, that they were all pieces of the same puzzle, and that if he could just figure out what was at the core of what was bothering him, it would all begin to fit together. He just needed a few years to figure it out. He would be lucky to have a few hours. Once again he forced his mind back to the relevant issues. Baraccus had left him a message in a three-thousand-year-old book, a rule unwritten, and Richard didn't know what it meant. Now that he once again had access to his gift, he did at least now recall all of The Book of Counted Shadows, but it was most likely file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (788 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 a false copy. Jagang had the original. Jagang had the boxes. Why was a Confessor central in it all? Was it because a Confessor was central to the boxes of Orden if one of the copies of The Book of Counted Shadows was used? Or was he just imagining it? Was he just thinking that a Confessor was central because Kahlan was a Confessor and she was central in his life? Just the thought of Kahlan sent his mind off track and racked him with anguish. Having to keep from telling her all the things he so desperately wanted to tell her was crushing his heart. Having to keep from taking her in his arms and kissing her was killing him. He just wanted to hold her tight. But he knew that if he destroyed the sterile field of her mind, then there was no chance for the power of Orden to restore her to who she was. He had to remain distant and vague. What terrified him the most was the thought that it was too late, that Samuel had already tainted that sterile field. He could feel Kahlan walking beside him. He recognized the sound of her footsteps, the scent of her, the presence of her. One instant he was overjoyed that he had her back, and the next he was panicked that he was going to lose her. He had to stop letting his mind drift to the problem and focus instead on the solution. He had to find the answer. If there really was an answer. \"Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us.

But how in the world was he to do that? He returned to what he thought had to be the heart of the solution. He would need to open the boxes of Orden if he was to reverse all the damage done-that was all there was to it. Unless he did that the world of life, damaged by the Chainfire event and its subsequent taint, would spiral out of control. Unless he opened the right box Jagang's Sisters would. But he didn't know how to open the boxes and besides he didn't have control of them, Jagang did. Richard reminded himself that at least he had accomplished a number of the steps he had to accomplish if he was to have a chance to open the right box. At least he had been successful in his journey through the veil. And he had been successful in returning what he had brought back in the manner required. That in itself had been a puzzle, but he had found the solution. Now Orden was needed to actually restore it. Kahlan had accepted the carving he did of Spirit. He reminded himself that he also had the Confessor that was needed. Confessor. Something was wrong about that, but he couldn't figure out what it could be. But he did know that there was only one way to get close to the boxes of Orden. That was his only chance-if he could figure it out before Sister Ulicia opened one of them.

The people below were all on their knees, bent forward with their foreheads to the tile as they chanted. They were unaware of what he was about to do. \"Richard!\" Verna gasped, catching her breath. \"Glad to see you back,\" Nathan said to Richard with an additional nod to Zedd. \"Six will no longer be a problem,\" Zedd told the prophet. Nathan let out a sigh. \"One less hornet, but I'm afraid that there's no shortage of them.\" Verna, ignoring the tall wizard beside her, waved her journey book urgently at Richard. \"Jagang says that it's the new moon. He demands your answer. He says that if he doesn't get that answer then you know the consequences.\" Richard glanced at Nathan. The prophet looked more than grim.

Richard was distantly heartened to hear the tone of awakened authority in her voice. But he ignored her and directed himself to Verna. With great effort, Richard controlled his voice. \"Tell him that I have decided to give them what they want. I agree to his terms.\" \"Are you serious?\" Verna was bottled rage. \"You want me to tell him that we surrender?\" \"Yes.\" \"What!\" Kahlan said, seizing a fistful of his shirtsleeve to pull him around toward her. \"You can't surrender to him.\" \"I have to. It's the only way I have to keep all those people down there from being tortured and killed. If I surrender the palace he will allow them to live.\" \"And you're going to take Jagang's word for that?\" Kahlan demanded. \"I have no choice.

He would have given just about anything to tell her how much he really loved her. If he was to go to his death, he at least would want her to know his true feelings and not think that he had married her out of a duty to an arrangement and was now using her as treasure to be turned over in a surrender. It was crushing his heart that she thought that. But he had no choice. If he corrupted the sterile field then the Kahlan that he knew would be forever lost-if it hadn't already been corrupted by Samuel, if she wasn't already lost to him. Richard turned his attention elsewhere. \"Where's Nicci?\" he asked Nathan. \"Locked up like you told me to do until Jagang can collect her.\" Kahlan rounded on him. \"And now you're also giving the woman you love over to-\" Richard lifted a hand, commanding silence. He unclenched his jaw as he turned to Verna. \"Do as I say.\" His tone of voice made it clear that it was an order not to be discussed, much less defied. As everyone stood in stunned silence, Richard started away. \"I will be in the Garden of Life, waiting.\" He needed to think. Only Kahlan followed him.

Richard had heard it said that such darkness brought the world of life closer to the underworld. In the hours waiting for Jagang to make it up the plateau and to the Garden of Life, Richard had paced the whole time, deep in thought, thinking about those two worlds-the world of life and the world of the dead. There was something about the whole thing that didn't make sense to him. He went through The Book of Counted Shadows that he had memorized, knowing that there was probably some flaw in it that would make it impossible to use it to open the power of Orden, but also knowing that the elements would still be largely true, if out of order. It would take nothing more than changing a single detail to have made it a false copy. He knew that there was a flaw in the copy he had memorized, but he didn't know how to identify the specific deviation from the original. Jagang had the original. He wouldn't have to worry about there being errors in his book. Sister Ulicia, with Jagang in her mind the whole time, would be reading the original directly, so they would be using the actual, true version of the book. Therefore, they wouldn't need a Confessor. He came to a halt before Kahlan. \"Copies of The Book of Counted Shadows have to be verified through the use of a Confessor. If you had the text to The Book of Counted Shadows, if I recited it for you, do you think you would be able to verify the true parts?\" Kahlan, deep in her own thoughts, looked up. \"I've asked myself that same question countless times.

Richard let out a despondent sigh and went back to pacing. He turned his thoughts back to the book that Baraccus had so desperately wanted him to have: Secrets of a War Wizard's Power. Baraccus had thought that it was vital that Richard have that book with the rule unwritten. The whole thing was so bizarre that Richard was left stunned and not knowing what to think. It had been a monumental effort to recover that book. It had to have also been a great effort on the part of Baraccus to see to it that only Richard would eventually be able to find it. Why leave him a book that said nothing? Unless it actually said everything. Richard glanced to his silent grandfather sitting on the short, vine- covered wall nearby. Zedd met his gaze but his sadness at not being able to help Richard was evident. \"I'm sorry,\" Kahlan said. Richard glanced over. \"What?\" \"I'm sorry. It had to be a terrible decision.

He had given Richard the rule unspoken, the rule unwritten, since the dawn of time. In that instant, as he grasped the Secrets of a War Wizard's Power, Richard was able to fit the other pieces together and understand it all. He grasped the totality of it, how it all worked, why they had done what they had done, why they had done everything. With trembling fingers, he pulled out the piece of white cloth with the two ink stains. He unfolded it and stared at the two spots on opposite sides. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Dear spirits, I understand what I have to do.\" Kahlan leaned close, looking down at the cloth. \"Understand what?\" Richard understood it all.

They all looked up at the sudden clamor of people entering the garden. The few men of the First File present, as instructed, fell back out of the way without offering any resistance. Richard saw Jagang at the head of the wave of people pouring in the doors. Sister Ulicia was right beside him. Other Sisters followed behind carrying the three boxes of Orden. Heavily armed guards, their boots all striking in unison, marched in the double doors, spreading into the garden like a dark flood. Jagang's presence, his burning, enduring hate, not only defiled the Garden of Life but defined him. Richard smiled inwardly. The gaze of Jagang's completely black eyes was fixed on Richard as the emperor marched down the path between the trees, past beds of long-dead flowers and past the short vine-covered walls. His royal guards were spread out behind, pouring through the shrubs as they established a defensive perimeter. Jagang wore a condescending smile as he passed the sorcerer's sand and crossed the sweep of lawn. His hate defined him. The Sisters set the three inky black boxes on the broad granite slab that was supported by two short, fluted pedestals. Sister Ulicia ignored the people in the garden. Focused on the job at hand, she only glanced briefly at Richard before setting the book on the granite altar in front of the boxes.

Jagang strode right up to stand close in front of Richard, as if challenging him to a fight. Richard stood his ground. \"Glad you came to your senses.\" His gaze slid to Kahlan. He regarded her with a lecherous look. \"And I'm glad you brought me your woman. I'll deal with her later.\" He looked back into Richard's eyes. \"I'm sure you aren't going to like what I have in mind.\" Richard returned a glare but said nothing. There was nothing to say, really. Jagang, for all his intimidating presence, his completely black eyes, his shaved head, the way he displayed his muscles as well as his plundered jewels, looked more than tired. He looked frazzled. Richard knew that the emperor was having nightmares and even more than that, haunting dreams about Nicci. Richard knew because they were nightmares and dreams that Richard had given him, through Jillian, the priestess of the bones, the dreamcaster who was descended from the same people as Jagang. The emperor stormed over to where Sister Ulicia stood waiting before the sorcerer's sand. \"What are you waiting for? Get started.

Richard couldn't afford to be distracted right then. He returned his attention to the Sisters. He still had a few things he needed to reason out. He needed to make sure it all made sense, or else they would all die-by his hand. Several Sisters knelt before the sorcerer's sand, smoothing it out in preparation. By the way they were working as a team, Richard figured that they had already studied the original of The Book of Counted Shadows in preparation and had all the procedures and enchantments memorized. He was surprised to see them all starting to draw the required elements. He recognized them from The Book of Counted Shadows that he'd memorized as a young man. He had expected Sister Ulicia, the one who had put the boxes in play, to be the one to draw those elements, but as they worked, Sister Ulicia instead went from one symbol to the next, finishing the final part that completed it. Richard realized that it made sense; it was only necessary that the elements be done, and this saved a great deal of time. Since Sister Ulicia was the one finishing each element, Richard guessed that the book had some requirement that the player be involved, probably requiring that they be the one to complete the spell-forms. She was the one invoking Orden. She was the player.

Richard remembered well how long it had taken Darken Rahl to run through all the procedures. The way they were doing it the Sisters were not going to take anywhere near that long. By working together they were able to divide the work into simpler components. Jagang paced back to Richard. \"Where's Nicci?\" he growled as his black eyes glared. Richard had been wondering how long it would be before he asked that question. It was even sooner than Richard expected. \"She is being held for you, as promised.\" Jagang's heated expression turned to a grin. \"Too bad you don't really know how to play Ja'La dh Jin.\" \"I beat you.\" Jagang's grin only widened. \"Not in the end.\" As the emperor went back to his impatient pacing, Sister Ulicia directed the elements from the book, reading pertinent parts when necessary. Richard understood the things they were drawing. Parts were the dance with death. When Darken Rahl had first drawn them they had seemed so mysterious, but now the language of them all made sense.

There were only a few of the First File present, all having waited with Richard for the Imperial Order to arrive. They were there to guard him until the bitter end. \"Take the emperor down to Nicci's cell,\" Richard told the officer. The man saluted with a fist to his heart. Before leading Jagang away, the contented-looking emperor turned back to Richard. \"Looks like you lose at the final turn at Ja'La dh Jin this time as well.\" Richard wanted to say that the time had not run out and the game was not yet over, but instead he simply watched the man leaving as he waited for the nightmare to begin in earnest. Kahlan stood silently at his side. The way she glanced up at him made him uneasy. Zedd and Nathan looked lost in their own thoughts. Verna looked angry and bitter that it had come to this. Richard couldn't blame her. Cara, standing beside Benjamin, took hold of his hand. Along with the rest of his party, Jagang had brought Jennsen into the Garden of Life. The royal guards kept her on the other side of the room. Tom's gaze was fixed on her. She stared back at him, unable to say all the things she obviously wanted to say. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (801 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Cara inched closer. \"Whatever happens now, Lord Rahl, I'm with you until my last breath.\" Richard returned a smile of appreciation.

Kahlan, close at his side, whispered, \"Would it be all right if you just held my hand?\" Richard could not imagine how alone she must feel at that moment. With a heavy heart that he couldn't say anything, he took her hand. CHAPTER 60 Nicci sat in the near darkness on the bench carved out of the same stone as the walls. The outer room, a second layer of protection guarding the room hollowed out of solid rock, was shielded. The only way in or out was through the double set of iron doors with the shielded room between them. This was where the most dangerous of prisoners were held, prisoners who could command magic. There was no telling how many people had sat in this very room as they awaited their appointment with death, or worse. Nicci could hear footsteps in the outer passageway beyond the two iron doors. Someone was coming. She had known that it was only a matter of time until he came. Nicci was in a state of utter calm. She knew why she was there. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (802 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 She knew why Richard had told Nathan to have her locked in this cell. She heard the lock in the outer door clang open, the metallic sound echoing through the network of low corridors. She could hear someone grunting as they tugged in a series of muscular pulls, forcing the door bound up on rusty hinges to open enough to get through. When she saw shadows through the small opening in the door to her inner cell, Nicci blew out the flame on the lamp beside her on the stone bench that was the room's bed and only furnishing. A key scraped and then the lock to her cell sprang open. After being in complete silence for so long, she found the strident sound exceptionally loud. As the door grated open the light from a lantern flooded in. Dust from the rusty door floated up in that harsh yellow light. Emperor Jagang ducked down as he stepped over the high sill to squeeze in through the doorway. Nicci stood. He was wearing his sleeveless vest so as to display his muscular bulk. His shaved head reflected the single flame of the lantern he'd brought. His black eyes looked entirely at home in the depths of the dark hole in the rock.

To Nicci it only served to prove that he was an unprincipled savage. Nicci stood tall, saying nothing, refusing to shy away as Jagang moved in close. He circled his muscular arm around her waist, pulling her tight against his powerful bulk, demonstrating his command of her, his virility, his unchallenged authority. Nicci had no desire to drag it out. She casually reached her arms up around him and snapped the Rada'Han closed around his bull neck. He staggered back a step in confusion. She knew that he would feel the power of the collar piercing into every fiber of his being. \"What have you done?\" he asked in a tone of anger bordering on a kind of horror she had never heard out of him before. She had no desire to discuss the matter, so she simply exerted her control through the collar to prevent him from talking. If she knew Jagang, and she did, then Sister Ulicia would be up in the Garden of Life working to open the right box of Orden. She didn't want Ulicia to realize what had just happened. Jagang would have been impatient to get at Nicci. The nightmares Richard had sent had plagued him, but the dreams Richard had given him of Nicci had turned his obsession for her into a passion, a mania, that had slowly grown to the point where it was nearly intolerable. Jagang had always desired her, but after the dreams Richard had crafted, Jagang could think of little else but possessing her. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (804 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He had even been willing to leave Sister Ulicia to her work to come down to the dungeon and personally recover her.

Richard knew that they would have to surrender the palace. He knew that they were all going to die. The one thing he could give Nicci was Jagang. The Rada'Han had been in the cell. It was the collar that Ann had left there when she had been imprisoned by Nathan for a time. That was what had been so important that Ann had been trying to tell Nicci before she had been killed. Nathan had known that the Rada'Han was in the cell, behind the shields of the room. Richard wanted Nicci to have it, and to have a way to bring final justice to Jagang the Just. Richard had no illusions that it defeated the Imperial Order. The corrupt beliefs of the Order tainted the minds of millions. Jagang was not its architect. That communal hatred would burn on without one man. Nicci understood that as well. She had grown up with the teachings of the Order. She knew how they attempted to perform the alchemy turning suffering into virtue, wrongdoing into righteousness, death into salvation.

Nor would killing Jagang stop those who had put the boxes of Orden in play, or the Chainfire spell, or the taint from the chimes, or the vast army who lay in wait, surrounding the palace, so eager for blood and plunder. This would not change any of that. But Richard had wanted to give her the last gift of being able to see this small bit of justice done before her own life was snuffed out, along with the rest of them, by the Sisters invoking the power of Orden in service to the army devoted to the beliefs of the Fellowship of Order. It was Richard's only way to thank her for all she had done, to allow her this one small bit of final salvation from the man who had so terribly abused her. Nicci stepped over the high sill. Her prisoner, unable to protest, followed. While her gift was limited within the People's Palace, it was enough to easily use the unique nature of the Rada'Han. She could have dropped Jagang to the ground in overwhelming agony, but she used only the power necessary to overcome his unwillingness to follow her silent directives.

The man had been kind to her, offering to bring her anything she wanted. She now had what she wanted. \"Captain Lerner,\" she said, \"if you would be so kind as to show us out of this maze?\" He gazed at the muscular man behind her in a collar and then smiled at her. \"I would be only too happy to do so.\" Once up into the immense halls of the palace, Nicci made Jagang lead the way. She followed close behind him, making sure that he kept going, that he talked to no one, that he acknowledged no one. He tried mightily to overcome the power of the collar. It was ridiculously easy for Nicci to overwhelm all of his resistance, all of his might and fury. He was as helpless as a puppet. Throughout the palace, men of the Imperial Order bowed to him as he passed. Nicci didn't allow Jagang to acknowledge them. The men of the Order were used to his superior arrogance, his indifference to them, so they thought nothing of seeing him march past without so much as a look. There was no easy way to get to the Garden of Life.

The major lines of the form were the vast corridors. The subordinate elements were formed by smaller halls. The entire palace was a maze of corridors with columns and halls guarded by rows of statues. Much of the interior of the palace was done in stone beautifully crafted in extravagant designs. The whole palace, while being a spell-form, was also a city, with streets made of the spell's corridors and halls. But getting anywhere required maneuvering through the complex lines of that spell-form. That made getting anywhere time- consuming. The journey from the dungeons up to the Garden of Life was a long one. As they made their way past places with skylights, Nicci saw that the sky was just beginning to take on a hint of blue. By the time they reached the garden level of the palace, the sun was just up. The first warm rays coming in through the east windows were touching the white marble on the opposite walls. Nicci's intention was to go into the garden with Jagang to see Richard one last time. She had found out from brief questions that Richard had somehow made it back. Jagang didn't know how. Nicci supposed that it didn't really matter, now. He was back, and she wanted to see him one last time before the end. She wanted to let him see Jagang so that he would know that at least the emperor would not enjoy the terrible fruit of the long war he had carried into the new world.

The sunlight did nothing to illuminate the boxes. They, instead, looked like they were pulling that sunlight in, taking it down to where it would never be seen again. Jagang struggled mightily to move closer, to fight off the control of the collar, but he couldn't. Nicci kept him in place, in the back, where his guards thought he was merely watching and didn't want to be disturbed. Nicci knew that she could end Jagang's Me in an instant. When the time came, she would. No one had any chance to rescue their emperor, even if they had known that he was in mortal trouble. He was hers now. Nicci could see Richard in his magnificent war wizard's outfit. The sight of him made her heart ache. Kahlan stood quietly beside him. If Richard had preserved the sterile field in order to have a chance to counter Chainfire, she wouldn't even know his true feelings for her. Now it looked like Richard would never get that chance, and she would die without ever knowing the truth. Richard spotted Nicci.

Golden light flowed from within, almost as if it were liquid. It enveloped the Sisters standing before the stone altar. They all smiled with exhilaration at what they had accomplished, even if it was to be put into service of the Imperial Order, and not themselves. Of course, they would put it to that service without even realizing that Jagang was no longer controlling their minds. If Nicci made them aware of that, though, then the Sisters would use the gateway to free the Keeper of the underworld. Nicci's choice was to allow them to give the world over to the Order, or to the Keeper. She knew that was no real choice. At least life under the Imperial Order would be life. If Sisters of the Dark were allowed to do as they would prefer, there would be no real life. Nicci did not want to live to see what was going to come of the new world brought into being by hate. She supposed that she would not have to worry about it. She expected that she had mere moments to live. But Jagang would die before she did. She would make sure of that.

Richard glanced at Nicci. Even she was transfixed by the sparkling light that swirled around the Sisters. Jagang, standing beside her, was smiling. Richard could just see the metal of the collar peeking through the front of the vest. Jagang knew that his cause would have the power of Orden, even if he didn't live to see it.

She smiled up at her husband as she hugged him with one arm. \"Yes, but only good thoughts.\" \"I miss Lord Rahl, too.\" He pulled out his own knife to gaze at it. It was the twin of Jennsen's.

That was how he had earned the right to carry that knife. Jennsen leaned a shoulder against the doorframe. \"It seems you only just got a Lord Rahl worth serving when you gave it all up to come here with me.\" \"You know,\" he said, smiling as he slipped his knife back in its sheath, \"I rather like my new life with my new wife.\" She hugged her arms around the bear of a man. \"You do, do you?\" she asked in a teasing way. \"I like my new name, too,\" he added. \"I'm finally used to it. You know, comfortable with it.\" When they married, Tom had taken her name, Rahl, so that they could carry it on in the new world. It seemed only fitting that the man who had given them their new life should be remembered in some fashion. In every other way he was vanishing from memory. It was surprising to Jennsen how so many people no longer even remembered the place they came from, their old world. It was just as Richard said: the Chainfire spell was taking their memory and those blank places were being rebuilt with new memories, new beliefs, about who they were. Since the Chainfire spell and the taint within it were both Subtractive magic, it had affected even the pristinely ungifted, so even they were con-tinuing to lose track of who and what they had been. For the most part, magic had become no more than superstition. Wiz-ards and sorceresses were even less important.

Dragons were becoming only folklore. In this world there were no dragons. Any who possessed magic were fading away. Their ability was dying out, smothered by the taint from the chimes. Day by day they became more powerless. Eventually they would merely be old hags living by themselves in swampy places and considered crazy by most folk. Any trace of the gift that survived, if not withered away by the taint of the chimes they'd brought with them into their world, would eventually be completely eliminated by descendants of the pristinely ungifted. It would be only a matter of generations before there was no trace of the gift left in mankind-just the way the Order had once said they wanted it. Everyone was concerned with more important things now. Their lives now revolved around the hard work of survival when there was no one who accomplished anything worthwhile. People had forgotten how to do things, how to create things. Even what had once seemed the most com-mon of things, such as construction methods, was being lost. The people here never knew how to create-they had depended on others to build and create. It would take future generations to discover them all over again. Those from the old life, those who created, who invented, who made life easier for everyone, and who were the object of such hatred, were not in this world to help make life better. The people left, for the most part, were left to eke out an existence as best they could. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (843 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 For most, living in such a dark age, sickness and death were their con-stant companion. As they had in the world they had been banished from, they turned to superstition and a grim, fatalistic acceptance of the misery of life and its accompanying devotion to their faith. It seemed that everywhere Tom and Jennsen traveled to trade for sup-plies, they saw churches going up as the hope for mankind's salvation from misery. Men of God traveled the countryside to spread the word, and demand devotion to Him. Jennsen and her people kept mostly to themselves, enjoying the fruits of their own labor and the simple joy of being left alone by tyrants and brutes. Some of them, though, had started keeping the symbols of the religious beliefs pressed on them. It seemed easier for them to go along than to question, to accept prepackaged beliefs than to think for themselves. Jennsen knew that their world was going to be one that sank into a very dark age, but she also knew that within that dark world, she and those with her could carve out their own small place of happiness, joy, and laughter. The rest of the world was too busy suffering to bother with the remote area of a few quiet people. Some of the pristinely ungifted, though, as their memories of the old world vanished, had left to go out among the cities and far-off places. Unknowingly, they carried the pristinely ungifted trait. It would continue to spread to the far corners of the world. \"How is the garden coming?\" she asked Tom as he knocked mud off his boots. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (844 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 He scratched his head of blond hair as he grinned. \"Things are coming up, Jenn.

The way her tail is wagging, I have the feeling that she thinks the piglets are going to be hers.\" Betty, Jennsen's brown goat, loved her new home. She got to be near Tom and Jennsen all the time and she could rule the roost. Betty had a couple of horses she was in love with, a mule she tolerated, and chickens that were beneath her. She would soon have her own kids. Tom leaned his shoulders back against the wall and folded his arms as he gazed out appreciatively at the beautiful spring countryside. \"I think we'll do just fine, Jenn.\" She rose up on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek. \"Good, because I'm going to have a baby.\" He looked thunderstruck for a moment; then he leaped in the air with a wild hoot. \"You are! Jennsen, that's wonderful! We're bringing a new little Rahl into the new world? Really?\" Jennsen laughed, nodding at his enthusiasm. She wished that Richard and Kahlan knew, that they could come visit once she eventually had her baby. But Richard and Kahlan were in another world. She had come to love the broad sunlit fields, the trees, the beautiful mountains beyond, and the cozy house they had built. It was home. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (845 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 A home filled with love and life.

Jennsen knew that Richard was real, but to the rest of her friends in the new world, Richard and all that he embodied, all that he represented, everything they once had known . . . was passing into the shrouded realm of legend and myth. CHAPTER 65 Kahlan stopped every step, it seemed, to greet people. She rose up on her toes to gaze out over the crowd, trying to see people she was looking for, people she was excited about seeing again. It seemed like the entire world was assembled in the expansive corridors of the People's Palace. She couldn't ever recall seeing so many people come out for anything. But then, this was a special event, something no one had ever seen before. No one wanted to miss it. The world was a different place. With so many people devoted to hatred vanished out of this world and into their own, there was a rebirth, it seemed, of spirit. With fewer people to produce by the toil of labor, the need for food and other goods had spurred labor- saving innovation and inventions. Every day she heard of accomplishments, of new things being developed. The opportunities for individuals to create and prosper were no longer restrained. It seemed the world was in flower. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (846 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 Kahlan stopped when someone caught her arm. She turned to see Jillian, with her grandfather. Kahlan hugged the girl tightly and told her grandfather what a brave young woman she had been, and how she had helped to save them all by casting dreams. Her grandfather beamed with pride. Kahlan was besieged by people all wanting to take her hand, to tell her how beautiful she looked, to ask if she and Richard were well. The crowds seemed to float her along. It was a delight to see such celebration, such joy and goodwill come together like this. Several members of the crypt staff stopped her to express their excitement at being invited. She hugged one of the women to stop her from talking. Since Richard had unleashed the power of Orden and grown them their tongues back, Kahlan didn't think that any of the crypt staff had stopped talking. Kahlan spotted Nathan strolling through the hallway. His full head of straight white hair hung to broad shoulders holding a blue velvet cape over a ruffled white shirt. He was wearing an elegant sword at his hip-he said that it made him look dashing. He had an attractive woman on each arm, so she guessed that it worked. Kahlan hoped that Richard was as ruggedly handsome wearing his sword when he was a thousand years old. She waved at Nathan across a sea of people. He pointed, to signify that he would see her with Richard. She headed in that direction. When she spotted Verna, Kahlan caught the prelate's arm. \"Verna, you came!\" Verna smiled like the sunshine. \"I wouldn't think of missing such a file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (847 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 thing.\" \"How is life at the Wizard's Keep?

It's so much different than before, so much better. It's all so new and exciting with a First Wizard to help. Seeing such young boys coming to know their gift is wondrous.\" \"And life with Zedd at the Keep?\" \"Zedd has never seemed so happy. With a Keep full of people you would think he would be grumpy, but I tell you, Kahlan, the man has come alive. He's like a child himself again to have Chase and Emma living there now, with all their children, and the boys learning their gift. The place is full of life again.\" Kahlan was getting choked up just hearing about it. \"That sounds wonderful, Verna.\" \"When are you coming for a visit? Everyone wants to see you and Richard again. Zedd has seen to it that people have come in to repair the damage to the Confessors' Palace. It's looking majestic again. It's ready for you to come back to visit your home whenever you wish. You won't believe all the staff who have returned and are hoping you and Richard will spend some time there.\" It was such a joy for Kahlan to know that so many people were sincere in their desire to have her around. She had grown up a Confessor, a woman feared by all. Now, because of Richard and all that had happened, she was loved as herself, and as the Mother Confessor. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (848 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Soon, Verna, soon.

She had gone only a short distance when the square-jawed Captain Zimmer saw her and tapped his fist to his chest in salute. \"Have any ears to show me, Captain?\" He smiled knowingly. \"Sorry, Mother Confessor. Haven't needed to collect any, lately-thanks to you and Lord Rahl.\" She gave his shoulder a squeeze as she moved on. She finally spotted Richard through the crowd. He turned to look at her, almost as if he could sense her presence. She didn't doubt that he could. The sight of him, as it always did, made her weak with joy. He looked magnificent in his black war-wizard outfit, fitting attire for the occasion. When she reached him, and he circled an arm gently around her waist, drawing her close to kiss her, the rest of the world, the thousands of people, most of them no doubt watching, vanished from her mind. \"I love you,\" he whispered in her ear. \"You are the most beautiful woman here.\" \"I don't know, Lord Rahl,\" she said with a playful smile, \"some more might show up.

Have you had anything to eat?\" \"I would be enjoying it more if Richard would leave me be so I could sample a few of the delightful-looking treats.\" Richard made a face. \"Zedd, the kitchen staff run when they see you.\" \"Well, if they don't like to cook, they shouldn't have become cooks.\" Kahlan felt someone grab her hand. \"Rachel!\" She bent and hugged the girl. \"How are you?\" \"Wonderful.

Someday, she was going to make a grand queen and draw wonderful things. \"Zedd,\" Kahlan said, \"have you seen Adie?\" \"Yes.\" Zedd smiled to himself. \"Friedrich Gilder makes her happy. If ever there was a woman who deserved to find happiness, I think it's Adie. Lucky for her she traveled to the Keep back when the palace was under siege and ran into Friedrich.

I can hardly get him to do any work for us at the Keep.\" \"And you're all right?\" Kahlan asked. His brows lifted. \"Well I will be when you and Richard come and stay for a while.\" He shook a finger at Richard. \"I tell you, Richard, sometimes I feel like you've gone off to the underworld, to live at the Temple of the Winds.\" Richard leveled an even look at his grandfather. \"The Temple of the Winds isn't in the underworld.\" \"Of course it is.

I made sure that for now no one but me can get in. I figured that when you're not busy, you and I can go visit it. It's quite a remarkable place, actually.

I'd love to be the one to show you a place that no one else has seen in three thousand years.\" Zedd's jaw was hanging. He held up a finger. \"Richard, did you do anything else while the gateway of Orden was open?\" Richard shrugged. \"A few things.\" \"Like what?\" \"Well, for one thing, I fixed it so that red fruit in the Midlands is no longer poison, just like I promised you I would a long time ago.\" \"What else?\" \"Well, I-oh, look, it's time to start. I have to go. We'll talk later.\" Zedd's brow drew down. \"You had better believe we will.\" Taking Kahlan's hand, Richard ascended the steps to the platform of the devotion square.

When Kahlan finally saw her coming, she smiled so broadly that it made her cheeks hurt. The crowd parted along the seemingly endless red carpet for the couple approaching the platform. The escorts followed in a long trail. Cara, looking positively radiant, ascended the steps with Benjamin at her side, holding his arm. He looked magnificent in his dress uniform. Benjamin was now General Meiffert, Commander of the First File at the People's Palace. Cara, like all the Mord-Sith following behind, was wearing her white leather. With Benjamin's dark uniform they made a stunning couple. In a way it reminded Kahlan of her in her white Confessor's dress and Richard in his black war-wizard outfit. Nicci, as beautiful as ever, smiled as she stood among the Mord- Sith to represent Cara as her official witness. \"Are you ready?\" Richard asked. Cara and Benjamin nodded, too giddy to answer, Kahlan thought. Richard leaned down a little, fixing Benjamin in his raptor glare. \"Ben, don't you ever hurt her, do you hear me?\" \"Lord Rahl, I don't think I could hurt her if I wanted to.\" \"You know what I mean.\" Benjamin smiled broadly. \"I know what you mean, Lord Rahl.\" \"Good,\" Richard said with a smile as he straightened. \"But I can still hurt him if I want, right?\" Cara asked.

They wish to share that life with each other.\" Richard's voice broke just a bit. \"No one in this room is more proud of that, or them, than I am. \"Cara, Benjamin, both of you are bound not by these words spoken before us all, but by your own hearts. These are simple words, but in simple things there is great power.\" Kahlan recognized the words from their own wedding. She thought that he could offer no greater respect for them than to use some of those same words for Cara and Benjamin. Richard cleared his throat and paused for a moment to compose himself. \"Cara, will you have Benjamin as your husband, and will you love and honor him for all time?\" \"I will,\" Cara said in a clear voice that carried over the crowd. \"Benjamin,\" Kahlan said, \"will you have Cara as your wife, and will you love and honor her for all time?\" \"I will,\" he said in an equally clear voice. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/paul%20hodnett/Desktop/book11/ENG_11%20-%20Confessor.html (854 of 856) [11/22/2007 8:53:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"Confessor: Sword of Truth 11 \"Then before your friends and loved ones, your people,\" Richard said, \"you are now wedded for all time.\" Cara and Benjamin came together in an embrace, kissing, as the Mord-Sith behind them cried and the crowd went wild.

Kahlan saw that Rikka, tears brimming, wore a pink ribbon in her hair that Nicci had given her. Richard stood tall and proud as he looked out over all the faces watching him. If Kahlan didn't see all the thousands gathered, she would have thought the halls were empty, it was that quiet. Richard spoke, then, in a voice that all could hear. \"To exist in this vast universe for a speck of time is the great gift of life. Our tiny sliver of time is our gift of life. It is our only life. The universe will go on, indifferent to our brief existence, but while we are here we touch not just part of that vastness, but also the lives around us. Life is the gift each of us has been given.
